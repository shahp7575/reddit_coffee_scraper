Occasionally, someone wants to get dinner instead, but then they don't want to go to the spots I suggest, and want to go to a specific spot.

What's the etiquette here - am I still expected to pay?

It rubs me the wrong way if I didn't choose the spot I'm paying for, especially in NY when the bill easily tops 100+ for dinner.

I generally decline the date at that point, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the dating etiquette as I'm new to NY.

I've always assumed that whoever's asking out pays, but that's with the assumption that you chose a spot you're willing to pay for.

1ggi5pn,https://www.reddit.com/r/michaelkummer/comments/1ggi5pn/the_6_scariest_autumn_foods_october_2024/,The 6 Scariest Autumn Foods (October 2024 Newsletter & Update),"With fall in full swing, I wanted to spotlight some of the most unhealthy seasonal treats out there. These popular “festive” foods may seem harmless, but they’re packed with ingredients that can wreak havoc on your health thanks to additives, sugars and oils that your body simply doesn’t need. 

Before we get to the list, I’d like to thank [OneSkin](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=2258549&u=1044653&m=102446&urllink=&afftrack=) for sponsoring this month’s newsletter.

[A Kummer favorite: Bananas stuffed with homemade marshmallows \(gelatin and honey from our bees\) and unsweetened chocolate chips. Wrap them in parchment paper and then in aluminum foil before roasting them in the oven \(or better yet, over open fire\) until the marshmallows have melted. ](https://preview.redd.it/suhfet8m74yd1.jpg?width=1999&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23e31fca6819d538b0ec071e8e8c189ff755781f)

# 1. Pumpkin Spice Lattes

They smell and taste like a cozy autumn day, but most pumpkin spice lattes are hiding frightening ingredients (like sugar, seed oil and artificial pumpkin flavors) beneath the foam. In fact, one 16-ounce Starbucks PSL packs a ghastly 50 grams of sugar! Skip the junk and avoid this dietary horror show. 

**What to try instead:** Brew quality coffee at home, add real pumpkin purée, cinnamon and nutmeg, and stir in some grass-fed cream or ghee for a pumpkin spice latte without the junk!

# 2. Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups

While not strictly a fall-only treat, Reese’s are consistently rated the #1 Halloween candy. Sadly, they’re packed with sugars, hydrogenated oils and creepy additives that make them far from a healthy indulgence.

**What to try instead:** For a healthier take, make your own “nut butter cups” with dark chocolate (90% or higher), grass-fed butter and macadamia nut butter sweetened with monk fruit. It’s an easy recipe that lets you enjoy the chocolatey flavor without the junk.

# 3. Candy Corn

This Halloween classic is a real nightmare, loaded with corn syrup, artificial colors and artificial flavors — a total sugar bomb that offers nothing for your health. Plus, the dyes used in these sweets (Yellow 6, Yellow 5, Red 3) have been linked to behavioral issues in kids, and many of them are known endocrine disruptors.

**What to try instead:** Conjure up some homemade gummies with grass-fed gelatin and natural colorings like beet or turmeric. 

# 4. Caramel Apples

Apples are nutritious on their own, but store-bought caramel apples are a scary story, since they’re almost always coated in corn syrup, hydrogenated oils and artificial flavorings. This sugary coating nullifies the health benefits of the apple and can lead to major blood sugar spikes.

**What to try instead:** For a similar treat that won’t haunt you later, make your own caramel sauce using grass-fed butter, heavy cream, and a bit of honey. Dip apple slices, sprinkle with sea salt, and enjoy a cleaner version at home.

# 5. Pumpkin Spice Granola Bars

Marketed as “healthy” snacks, these autumn staples are wolves in sheeps’ clothing because they’re packed with glyphosate-laden oats, refined sugars, seed oils, and artificial pumpkin flavors. They offer a quick carb rush but little nutritional benefit. 

**What to try instead:** For an animal-based twist, snack on a beef or bison bar (like [Epic Provisions](https://amzn.to/4e8VGYr) or [Carnivore Bar](https://the-carnivore-bar.myshopify.com/?sca_ref=6440795.BqMA1fGiuf)). If you’re craving pumpkin flavor, try mixing pumpkin purée with collagen powder and a touch of honey for homemade bites.

# 6. Butternut Squash Soup (Store-Bought)

A cozy bowl of butternut squash soup sounds innocent enough, but store-bought versions are often filled with seed oils, added sugars, and artificial thickeners. Instead of nourishment, this nefarious concoction might leave you cursed with inflammation.

**What to try instead:** Roast butternut squash at home, blend it with bone broth, and add a bit of grass-fed cream or ghee. This homemade version offers true warmth without the inflammatory ingredients!

# Our Family’s Approach to the Holidays

As a family, we make an effort to enjoy the holiday season without compromising our health. For Halloween, we bake a decadent pecan chocolate tart from scratch and cozy up with a scary movie. If the kids decide to go trick-or-treating, they know we don’t eat junk food and actually throw away the candy themselves without us having to mention it. And yes — the candy goes straight into the trash, which might seem a bit harsh… but we’re definitely not eating it, and we’d rather avoid giving it to anyone else.

Moving into the holiday season, we also embrace traditions that focus on meaningful, health-based moments. For Christmas, we continue a tradition I grew up with by giving our kids an advent calendar. Each day, they open a door to find a healthy treat or an activity, like crafting a snow globe, volunteering at a food shelter, or making a gingerbread house from scratch. These small moments build anticipation and keep the holidays focused on experiences and creativity rather than sugar.

And of course, Thanksgiving is all about family and homegrown food. We enjoy a homestead-raised turkey with stuffing made from double-fermented sourdough bread, and we bake a sweet potato casserole using potatoes from our own garden. With every holiday meal, we prioritize real food prepared at home — it’s part of what makes the season so memorable for us.

The bottom line? While seasonal treats may seem festive, they’re often loaded with harmful ingredients that can derail your health. This fall, I challenge you to skip the processed snacks and try some homemade alternatives instead. Not only are they healthier, but they’re also surprisingly easy to make and infinitely more satisfying – especially if you get to recruit other family members to help in the kitchen!

# Kummer Homestead Updates

[There’s something incredibly special about knowing that the animals you’ve tended to each day with care and respect will one day come full circle to nourish you and your family, providing the sustenance that only a close connection to your food can bring.](https://preview.redd.it/93oboes984yd1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8b206862d4043f56358d1afc1bf7beb2ae665c6c)

We discovered that great horned owls recently moved into our area after one injured, and another killed, one of our guinea fowl. I managed to deter the first owl with a flashlight after running outside in my underwear early one morning, but I wasn’t as lucky the next night. Fortunately, we were able to patch up the injured guinea hen, even though she suffered a deep wound on her neck.

The good news is that the guinea flock learned their lesson and are now staying close to the turkeys at night. 

Speaking of turkeys: they’ve reached their target weight and we’ll butcher them over the next few days so they’re ready for Thanksgiving. 

Our meat birds are also growing nicely and will be ready for freezer camp early December.

This is quite a long story, and I am using a throwaway account for privacy. I guess these things have been piling up for quite some time and I feel like I am stuck with how I should handle the situation for my own good and I'd like to get some external opinion - you know, sometimes you like someone else so much that you'd be willing to give anything and everything and especially ignore lots of red flags, while still holding on to those 2-3 green flags.

Right, so here goes; grab your popcorn bucket and pour yourself a beer (or juice if that's your thing).

I have known this girl since high-school. I am now 28, she turns 30 very soon, and we were like 13 and 15 when we met. We were classmates. Nothing particular with her at first, just another classmate. I must say that I started school like 2 years earlier than normal, so I was much younger than the rest.

Some day, we went on a school trip with the class, somewhere in the mountains. Obviously, we got some booze (not exaggerated eh ;) ) and we played some games, and at some point most girls and guys just started hooking up - you know how it is, hormones screaming and all that. I was sort of left out since well, who looks at the young guy at this age, and she was the only one that didn't really feel like hooking up with someone else, so we just went downstairs to play some card games with the teacher and a couple of other persons, I don't exactly remember. During this game, everybody received a role (healer, police, robber, etc) and everybody closed their eyes. The healer needed to open their eyes to heal someone, the robber had to eliminate someone, the police needed to try to catch the robber and I was the game master, so I kept my eyes open. Again, nothing very special with her so far.

Yet, that's when it happened. She was the healer (I think, don't remember) and she just crossed her eyes with mine when looking for the target to heal. And I don't know man, I never felt like that - felt like I dropped from my chair, my stomach dropped and everything. I had a couple of crushes before that but NEVER felt like that before and never since with someone else. She has this brown hair and these electric blue eyes, damn, I felt like I was looking directly at an angel.

I was still young at the time, and you know, talking to girls was kinda hard. Anyway. This feeling sort of scared me, so I never really tried to ask her out or anything for the next months. However, every time I saw her I just felt that. This.. thing.

Anyway. She started dating some other classmate, a old friend of mine that I have known for a long time. Things got really difficult then, seeing her with this dude while I just kept my feelings for me. We were still chatting a lot on an IM app that was quite used at the time, every day for hours on end, about anything and everything, but I never really got the guts to ask her out, even when her relationship was off for a few months. Anyway, a couple of years later inside this dynamic, I told her how I felt, got her some flowers for Valentine's day and created something with my own hands, a small letter with a few kind words and crafted this small flower from plastics, some grass, etc on the first page of the letter. I guess it was nice, she liked it at the time she said.

But nothing really changed. We went out a couple of times but while I really loved her, it sort of made it hard for me to kiss her or hold her hands or anything, this feeling was so intense that I just did not know what to with it. She slowly started going out with these ""popular"" guys that, to be honest, today did not really make it far in life, their highlight was their high-school years. She was well aware of my feelings for her and yet at every chance she got she crushed them. I remember a particularly painful episode, when she and her ex were still separated and we climbed a mountain nearby (yes, we live in a mountainous area) - I thought well, maybe now's the time to act, but how? I don't know what to do. He was this ""mysterious"" guitarist type with long hair. We rented a cabin at the top of the mountain where there were like 10 beds for everyone, and the entire night I could just hear them kissing and doing stuff. Really hard for me to go back there, I will skip the details.

I remember an episode someday where a girl liked me, we were in a bar after school, getting a coffee (this was the time when she was seeing someone else and already rejected me a couple of times) and I just kissed this girl that liked me in front of her, to see how she'd react. She seemed dissapointed. Later that night we met at school for a reunion, I asked her something randomly and she was like ""go ask that \*\*\*\*\* you were kissing!!"" - bro, come on. I really tried and tried to see if you'd like to give us a shot or something and you always rejected me.

After that, things slowly went downhill, she changed the class, etc. When we finished high school, contact was lost. She went abroad with her ex, and I went also abroad in another country. It was hard for me to get over her, took me a year or two but I guess I managed. I tried to replicate this feeling with someone else, but nothing measured up. I was never one with the girls, so I didn't really have relationships during uni or anything. Was mostly focused on building myself up, studying, building a business etc. I still thought of her every once in a while but these feelings sort of went away, finally.

That is, until 2019 or 2020 around the time Corona hit. I signed up for Instagram and just went on with my life. That is until a few months later, guess who popped up in my recommendations. And out of nowhere, there it was. That feeling again. ""What's she up to?"", ""How is she?"", ""What became of her?"". After building up the courage to click that follow request button for a couple of months and thinking of her, I followed her and she followed me back after a couple of hours. I felt SUUUUUUUPER happy - finally, a shot to try to slowly build something. Ok, let's calm down - let's not rush things. I asked around and apparently she separated from this guy of hers (yes, the high school sweethearts after 7 years of relationship) because he was lazy, didn't give her attention, didn't really finish his studies and most of the time he was just smoking the green stuff, laying around in bed, ignoring her, and didn't really have any ambitions in life (she said this herself as well to confirm).

So yeah, we followed each other. She had someone else at the time, this party-dude but again, was for a few months and they separated. She told me sometime later that she sort of used him to get over her ex, but she didn't see any sort of a future with him either, he was too busy partying, wasn't really anything deep, mostly superficial and transactional.

Right, so, first ""reconnection"": during new year in 2019 I think, with my friends abroad (I did not return in my home country yet) and after one too many beers we decided to sign up for a skydiving experience. I was in it for the fun but somehow deep inside I thought maybe it could be something that could get her to reach out. It took like 6 months to get to the skydive, I was busy with other things, work, etc so things went quite fast. I posted every once in a while on Insta, either stories or posts and she always checked my stories relatively fast. She even liked my posts at some point with a rollercoaster and some friends on a boat. I thought, well I can't go wrong. So I went for the skydive, and the next thing you know, my gut feeling was right. She did reach out. I was so happy she did, especially since I was absolutely terrified of the dive. I also have vertigo so that made things worse. But her reaching out and us talking again, jokingly, made me go ahead and do it.

After that again, we didn't really write, on-off sort of thing. She started a clothing business that never really took off, I congratulated her on that, etc. Sometimes she liked my stuff, I liked hers, but we always checked each other's stories, so I just went ahead with that.

In my mind, I was like... right. What can I do that I like and that could perhaps spark something in her too on the side? So I put my mind that some day I will become a pilot for fun. Planned everything, etc. But that's for later. At some point, I came back with my friends from abroad in my home country in the city she was in as well (capital city) to visit, so I thought, why not reach out to her? She was really happy I reached out and we met at some club/bar sort of place, all of us. I was with my friends, she brought hers. This was around summer 2020. That evening, we were all super chatty, she was even a bit flirty, so we went ahead and drank a bit etc and went to a friends' place. Was a really great evening and all, but she got so drunk that she could barely stand. I didn't want to take advantage of that. I asked her if she is well, she fell in my arms, I placed her on the sofa, and when I asked her if I can bring her a glass of water, she just hugged me and fell asleep there. Sometime later that evening, this friend showed her the room to go to sleep and she went. Did I act well? I took care of her, she was really sick at some point. So anyway, the evening ended and I went back abroad a couple of days later. I tried to ask her out again but she was busy.

Anyway, I just couldn't drop it at that, plus with Corona and everything there was no point in me staying abroad so I went back home. I found an apartment (most friends were in the capital too) and asked if she could check it since I was still away - she agreed instantly but cancelled last minute, so I had to find another way. I asked her if something happened that night or anything, and she said she just blacked out and doesn't remember anything. She doesn't know if she'd be happy with me or not, nothing special, didn't really insist on it. I moved in, and a few months later I asked her if she'd like to join the ""new home"" party; she said she had something else planned but it'd be nice to meet someday.

Again, ""officially"" she was not with anyone else so I didn't see a reason not to keep her close. A few months passed, had to go to Spain for my research, posted things from over there and saw she randomly checked my LinkedIn profile, kept checking my stories instantly almost but then... she vanished. Deleted her insta and everything. So I messaged her out of the blue the next day with a ""good morning sunshine"" text and selfie with me and a coffee in spain. We talked for a bit, etc, and I got her a couple of things, a flamenco scarf and a hand-made wooden fan, the ones the flamenco dancers have. When I came back home, we did meet at my place.

We had a great evening, cooked dinner, drank some wine, played some games, danced together, she seemed to reaaaaallly enjoy my company but again, she got super drunk. Around 2AM or so, she said she can't go home and would like to sleep, so I showed her my bed and told I'll just sleep on the sofa. She said ""come here, we're adults"" so I just went ahead. She kissed me - finally kissed me after so much time. She laughed when I said something like ""finally"" and turned around and went to sleep. Nothing more, nothing less.

Right, so the next weeks or so I wrote to her, we laughed a lot until some day out of the blue she said something like ""If you give too much attention to a girl she loses interest"". This was around 2021 I think, around November 2021. We met again for some outings, we went to fire some weapons at the range (cool date idea I guess, she reaaalllly liked it!), and we went back home to decorate the Christmas tree, but she seemed glued to her phone. I told her I'd like to start to learn to fly a plane and see the world and she said something like ""Take me with you"" with some really cute eyes. I promised I will sometime. At some point she said she has to go, we kissed again and I asked her ""what's going on between us?"" to which she replied ""you waited for 10 years, you can wait some more"". Damn, so close.

So yeah, I tried to speak again a few days later, especially since I saw she was in party-mode a lot in her stories, getting super drunk all the time. And at some point she just said ""I met someone else"", etc. We went back and forth, asked her since when, ""recently"", ""well, what about us? we never really tried nothing serious"", ""i'm scared of commitment, etc"" she replied and she said ""we should just each move on with our lives"", ""don't reach out again"", etc and I said ""I can't... I just really love you and hope you are well"" - stupid move. Anyway. I told her to just block me then if that's how she feels, because I can't stay here like that. And she did. Immediately. Damn, the next two weeks were the hardest two weeks of my life.

Thing is, I met someone else, my current girlfriend a couple of months later. I needed to give someone these feelings I had, I just couldn't hold them in. So I dated her and still am with my girlfriend now. This was around March 2022. Yeah so, she kept me blocked for the next 6 months or so I guess.

Until around June 2022, I randomly saw she unblocked me. And she put her profile in public also (she always kept it private) for a week or so. Don't ask me how I saw this, insta just recommended her to me again. So yeah, I checked what she was up to with an anonymous profile viewer, she seemed to be with some other random dude (not the same) and she was with him for a couple of months it seems. Didn't really look more than that into it. A few months later, four or five, I texted her on an evening around 11PM that I got my license and that if she's up for it, let's go fly! She replied instantly that yes. So yeah, we were back in the dynamic it seems.

We met a couple of times to reassure her what's going on, explain her what we do. She started a business with a house for child events, birthday parties etc. Some day she asked me if I want to come and see the place, I said yes. It was the first time we met again after the block period. Some other people were there working on the house, it was still being built at the time. So I asked her directly ""what's up? why did you unblock me, what do you feel?"" to which she replied ""well, I am sorry for how things turned out, I don't know exactly what I feel for you, but you're someone I care about"" and then we kissed........ and then she asked for 5 grand to help her with the house (HUGE RED FLAG RIGHT?). And me, I said yes obviously. I had the money, 5 grand was nothing, so if I could help her, why not I guess.

She paid me back over time, we went out a few times to some nice restaurants, we went to drive some sport cars on a track, went flying etc but it was always leading to nothing. She was always like ""i'm not looking for commitment, not looking for relationships"" but she had someone at the time again.... so what to make of this? Anyway. This went for like a year or so, until March 2024. I always took her out for fun stuff to do, always out of the ordinary.

And yeah, in March we met for a dinner and then went clubbing for a bit. We got a bit tipsy and I told her I love her to which she replied too. I told her that together we could rule the world. I know my stuff and she knows her and I am sure we can accomplish great things. I noticed that she was chatting with a friend of hers and saw ""his dad works at (insert soda company name here)"" - that's not my case so I didn't look too much into it. So after that we didn't really catch up, we remained in this story checking dynamic, etc. I was still with my gf, remember.

And in April we met with this other girl, her business partner and her to discuss a possible business. We were talking in the car about some old high school colleague, that she's always travelling and I joked she probably found a millionaire or something but I didn't see anyone in her posts. To which they both replied ""well, that's the whole point"" - sorry, what? point of hiding?? anyway. Another red flag. And later that day she said ""your dad works at (soda company), no?"". So, what? I have money and am fun and you tell your friends about it? Meh, tried to ignore that too.

I saw she was colder, so I asked what's wrong. What happened that night in March. And again, she replied with ""I met someone.."" - even though for a full year I always took her out and she was hot and cold, kissing and hugging and then silence. And it seems that for a full 7 MONTHS while we were ""going out"" and I was damn clear on my intentions and feelings, she was with another girl. Just went back to the old ""well, block me then. you hurt me so many times, I don't want to be part of this anymore"". And she said no - I did nothing wrong, she won't block me. I insisted and insisted and insisted, remembered the good times together, etc. She got much colder, I told her if I could change things I would, but that she never said what she feels for me directly. I asked her if I should just stick around or something, she said she doesn't want me to leave (in other words than this but this was the main message). Anyway. There were some other discussions going on, like ""I really care about this person, I usually kiss most friends, etc."". I just told her that my bday is coming up in three months and if she'd like to come fly with me somewhere nice, I know a very nice spot and I'd like to give her the best day of her life - she said she'll probably be busy and she prefers to say no. I said ""just tell me a week before my bday so I can organize things"". Fine. I just unfollowed her but she didn't unfollow me. So for the next 3 months I just ignored her completely - I was still checking whether she checked my stories etc and most of the time she did. Unless I posted something with my gf, to which she would avoid my content for a day or two.

So anyway. Three months later - A week or so before my bday came up she started engaging much more with my contents. My bday came up and she reached out with ""Very happy birthday!! Hope you're doing well"". I tried to play the cold card, just replied with ""thanks"". She ignored the message, but she kept checking my stories again, until at some point she stopped for a few days. I reached out with ""hey, how about that coffee and plane ride sometime?"", to which she happily replied. We didn't really discuss much more, I didn't refollow or anything.

I heard from a common friend that actually, during this time, she cheated on her ex-gf with another girl, that she doesn't see a future with but is only there for fun and for clout - she is like this advertising manager and has all sorts of two-bit celebrities she works with. Her, this girl I like, is still in ultra party mode, getting drunk every day, abusing drugs, she lost like 10kg. She is in this relationship with the girl in question, but nothing serious. Some friends told me she saw her with a random 70-year old dude that looked rich at the same time holding hands, she posted with a singer and apparently they slept together etc, all while she is in this relationship with this advertiser.

Randomly, in our hometown, I was out with some friends and she popped out of the blue with another girl I know and her friend - just a friendly outing I guess. She didn't see me but oh damn, did I see her. She was in a very drunken state, fell of her chair twice, and my name came up ""oh, him? well, he really helped me out, my business works because of him. He is so madly in love with me! I'll marry him someday"" but that's it. In other cases, she talks about her exes, her friends very openly but when someone mentions my name, she closes the convo very quickly and avoids the subject. This common friend of mine said that she's just looking for fun, superficiality, and that ""people that seem to be in control actually aren't at all"" - referring to her, and that she ""seems to drink to just forget"". This common friend said that most of her friends are superficial, and that I'm sort of the only stable figure in her life in a way, even if it's on/off.

Yeah, so I followed up with my plan. I really organized but fate made it so that the day before the owner of the plane told me that his insurance for solo flights expired so we can't fly. I wrote to her explaining this, but I said, ""well, I'm still up for a fun day if you want. Took the day off so let's just enjoy it, I know some nice places we can go to by car"" - she replied just with ""ahah, well, let's just postpone to when the plane works then"". I said ""well, I don't know when it will work again, depends on paperwork, but I'd like to take you out on a date sometime. Don't worry, I won't marry you from day one, so relax"" - I thought this might work since she perhaps thought I'd ask her to commit or anything, but at the same time I wanted to make my intentions clear. She just left me on seen for the past couple of days, but again, she checks my stuff...

I'm not trying to be the judge here, or say my lifestyle is right or hers is wrong. To each his own I guess. Everybody wants to have fun. But objectively speaking, I'm not sure how drugs, booze and superficiality will be good for her in the long run. I always just wanted the best for her. I mean, if I didn't care I could have just listened to everybody else telling me to leave the sinking ship and leave what's for the streets for the streets. But, it's really hard. I don't want to be pushy or ""show her the way"", it's not my place. If she's happy with someone else, fine, we're all free here. But I worry for her.

What's been going on these years then? Did she just use me? Why bother reach out after 3 months? I was clear also three months ago and for these years that ""just friends"" won't work, because I have feelings for her and if we stay in touch I can't focus on my current relationship, and that we should probably just disappear from each other's lives. And when I was finally getting out - she reached out. Should I just give up on her like that?",1,1730390549.0,dating,0,1.0,False

After testing a bunch of YouTube to MP3 converters, I noticed that most tools fall into two main categories. Here’s my experience with each if you’re also converting regularly:

# 1. Ad-Supported Tools  💸

These are super common and usually free to use, but beware—you’re in for a wall of ads. Many of these sites are notorious for pop-ups, hidden redirects, and even malware risks. So yeah, they’re free, but it’s a trade-off.

Pros:

* Free to use
* Easy to access

Cons:

* Tons of ads (some super intrusive)
* Potential for malware or unwanted downloads

# 2. Clean, Donation-Supported Tools ♻️

These ad-free options rely on donations from users (think “Buy Me a Coffee”). Examples like Y2Mate, Y2Mic, and EzMP3 fall into this category, offering a much cleaner and safer experience. While they may not have all the features of premium tools, they’re a solid middle ground if you want something safe and user-friendly.

Pros:

* No ads; super clean interface
* Safer, more reliable experience

Cons:

* Limited features without donations
* Might have slower speeds or usage caps

# Final Thoughts

If you’re after a trustworthy and hassle-free experience, donation-supported tools are definitely the way to go. They’re cleaner, safer, and way less frustrating to use. I highly recommend these for a better, stress-free experience with YouTube to MP3 conversions!

Hope this helps anyone else looking for a reliable converter!",1,1730390506.0,editing,0,1.0,False

They gave whatever you wanted for free, and I needed a grinder. I've been giving this love and care as it has such a diverse range of grinding, from so course it is basically cut beans, to so fine water cannot get out. I wanted to look up maintenance and potentially parts (the coffee bean holder on the top is way too big for my needs so I wanted to see if there is a smaller one that would fit).

I looked identifiers everywhere on it, google'd Moka d'Oro, and even did reverse image search, but no luck.

If it helps, it is heavy as a truck. To adjust the grind, you rotate this part and it can rotate a lot. It does get tough to rotate and I think it needs maintenance like something to make the rotating easier, but I'd prefer a manual to do it.

I hope someone can help me out!

I've had GP unknowingly for years now and got officially diagnosed last October. I can't tolerate any red meat, lard, grease, most dairy products depending on the fat content and most American breads. Chicken and fish are more tolerable but for the most part I just avoid all meat because just a little bit of protein makes me feel like I've eaten an entire Thanksgiving turkey and it's super painful. 

Super dry cheeses in low amounts is alright,  like parmesan. I can also handle skim milk in lowamounts. Just a little bit if it's in coffee or something.
It's weird and I don't understand it.
Anyway, lately I've been having this issue where my nails have become super duper brittle and my hair is also falling out a little bit.  I have to be careful when my hands are wet or else my nails will scale, crack and split apart. My hair is not falling out that much but it's enough to bother me, I can tell that it's slightly more than average. 
I'm wondering if the inability to eat meat is connected to my nails falling apart and if any one else has had similar issues?

1gghuv0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1gghuv0/cold_plunge_helps_my_28f_ibsc/,Cold Plunge Helps My (28F) IBS-C! ,"
Background: 

(28F) I’ve dealt with IBS-C since at least 18 years old. I’ve never been formally diagnosed, but I became vilified when at 20 when my doctor during a physical said that I need to be taking more probiotics to address the unusual bloating I have for someone my size. 

When I experience a flare up (usually triggered by stress, traveling, lack of movement) it can sometimes lead to me not having a BM for a week. Laxatives have never helped me for some reason but sometimes coffee does. 

The worst year I ever had was 2021 which lead to horrible self esteem issues. I suspect this is because I stopped lifting weights due to gym closures during the pandemic. 


WHAT’S HELPED ME:

I started having a BM once a day 😭🥳! I had a horrible flare up when I was extremely stressed from a recent move and healing from a muscle strain while trying out a Lyra class. 

Over the last month I began weight lifting 4-5x a week again, ensuring a have a heigh protein diet, and I joined a cold plunge studio! 

The first time I did a cold plunge I had a BM the next day without a coffee for the first time in years. 

Cold plunges can help reduce inflammation by constricting blood vessels, which limits blood flow to inflamed areas, reducing swelling. They also stimulate the release of anti inflammatory molecules, which can aid in recovery and alleviate pain! It’s been wonderful for me. 

I rarely get sick and suspect that my body is triggered by stress and it responds through (chronic?) inflammation. 

When I actively work to incorporate anti inflammatory practices I have a BM! 

Maybe this will help someone out there. I know how it feels to be in the middle of an ongoing flare up and it’s something I’ll likely have to work on forever. 

TLDR
(28F IBS-C) 
Addressing inflammation has lead to a BM everyday. Weight lifting 4-5x a week + cold plunge + high protein diet. ",1,1730390072.0,ibs,0,1.0,False

I steam milk using the machine and get a good texture going. But my espresso shots seem flavor-less. I would like to get thicker espressos with crema that smell great. I use Nespresso at work with disk pods and I've used oval bullet shaped nespresso's elsewhere, and that seems like a better espresso shot to me.

I do have a Keurig and a French press that I use very rarely when I want a gas station style coffee with milk (I add hot milk because I like my coffee hot). For these I use Starbucks grounds - with refillable k-cup and a paper filter. Again, the coffee comes out barely acceptable.

Sleep has been heavenly, so much that I look forward to it, lol. Very vivid dreams as well.

I used to drink equaling of 2 cups per day, so I’m no way a heavy user, though very very sensitive to caffeine.

But now on day 3, I already feel great. Except from a mild headache. I’m literally blown away about all the positive effects I’m already feeling. Excited about life and have a way more positive outlook of the future ahead.

Also I’ve been going to work, exercising and eating clean. Meaning I’ve still been performing without substitutes.

Just felt like sharing this positive message, since I see a lot of posts about people struggling for months.

I also have ADHD, maybe that influences it, I don’t know. ",3,1730389282.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

It mainly started when i was under lots of stress around 2020 and at the same time i wanted to lose weight. I would vomit like 5-6 times per DAY, and i think it was more of a psychological issue because of school stress and wanting to lose weight fast. I got tested, and told i was close to having bulimia and tbat if i didnt try and stop this habit and took some meds i'd end up bad. Although i did take some meds for some time and easend up, i never stopped completely vomiting.

I have also been tested for hiatal hernia, as i often felt burns around the heart before vomiting, or acidic-like taste in my mouth. Though that turned out negative.

Now i vomit much less, mainly from stress or consuming milk/coffee containing milk (like cappuccino) after eating any kind of meal. I dont have a problem with any other dairy products except milk. For the past year or two ive been vomiting 2-3 times per week, (mainy because its exam season and i vomit a lot when under stress).

I only remember seeing it on television once, airing in a late afternoon. It features an old woman on a white porch swing held up by dark chains in front of a yellow house. There's a window into the house behind her, and there's a grassy area (and maybe a road?) in the background of the shot as it was filmed off to one side. I think it's just one quick shot of her on that swing, maybe sipping a cup of Speedway coffee, before it cuts to generic gas station footage. I believe this was during the time when the company was using the jingle ""we're on your way, the convenient stores of Speedway."" My family has been looking for this commercial for over a decade; the white porch swing was hand-built by my late father, and the house is my childhood home.

Is the following too much, too little, or just right for a single day, with of course overlapping timing?

* **Experiment 1:** Developing four Western blot membranes (primary antibody incubation, washes, secondary antibodies, washes, and exposure)
* **Experiment 2:** Preparing gels, loading and running, blotting, and blocking for a Western blot (different experiment than above)
* **Experiment 3:** Perturbing cells (and controls), harvesting, and preparing for immunofluorescence (fixing, blocking, and washes)
* **Experiment 4:** Harvesting cells for Western blot
* **Experiment 5:** siRNA transfections
* **Experiment 6:** Medium and drug changes

Overall, six experiments, which coincidentally corresponds to five hours of bench work and an hour of documentation—six hours total.

This information is then transferred to the lab book at the end of the day or the next morning (yeah, well, shoot me). The rest of the day was filled with a tutoring session for an MSc course, providing feedback to an MSc student on their thesis, and more menial lab tasks like showing someone how to start an autoclave and resolving a conflict about instrument time after a breakdown.

One person told me that if I can't handle this, I should become a garbage man; they'd happily take my position. Others opined that two to three experiments per day should be the maximum.

For context, Raphael had a five year long relationship with her from when he was 20-25, and it was the only other serious relationship aside from me that he's had. They broke up because she told him that she'd lost feelings for him and it just wasn't the same anymore.

It's been comments like, 'Oh, Jo always used to make the best lasagne', or 'Jo always dressed so well'. I shrugged it off at first because it wasn't frequent and I know that she liked Jo a lot when they were dating. But it's getting worse. Last weekend, she came over after dinner and spent a lot of the time (at least while I was present) talking about how Jo would have done anything that I did differently. I felt uncomfortable & Raph did as well, but when he told her to stop she just kind of brushed him off. 

I talked to him after everything and he agreed that it was weird and disrespectful. I decided to organise to speak to her. We went for coffee and I explained that the comparisons were hurtful and that I'd appreciate it if she could stop mentioning Jo. She was taken aback and told me that I was being overly sensitive and trying to drive a wedge between her and her son. Now I'm wondering if I went to far and should have just left it. AITA?

1ggh3hr,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1ggh3hr/the_backroads_the_masked_lurker/,The Backroads: The Masked Lurker,"Thinking about things you shouldn’t is an established trait among humans, whether we developed that horrid trait through evolution or it just being a part of us that we always had I don’t know but I hate it. It sucks and it sucks more when you need just to let go of those certain events however on the road trapped in the Evernight it’s an impossibility. One does not simply erase horrors from the mind no matter how hard they try but luckily you can distract yourself, you can let your mind wander while driving for hours in the dark. My routine would consist of podcasts blasting music like a sane person, the one thing I’d recommend is to not fuel that burning desire to dwell on those bad thoughts or memories. Don’t be stupid and listen to horror videos or true crime podcasts. Don’t listen to that conspiracy theorist who has his radio station and has the southern voice that draws you in for it will only bring you to contemplate the strange happenings in your neck of the woods, along with the healthy dose distrust with the government staples of the country. Not that his points aren't entirely wrong but most people rather live in bliss. Don’t listen and think about the creepy shit on the radio, podcast, whatever just leave it as background noise believe me when I say the allure of horror should be kept to fiction as inviting into your life is never a clever idea. And for the love of God and all that is holy don’t fucking text and drive.

Now you might be wondering ‘Why can’t I think about the creepy shit or bad memories in my life?’ and my answer should be obvious, it’s creepy shit at night I don’t care about how brave or edgy you think you are. Out in the dark, that type of vibe can invite things to you, things that look human but well aren’t. This was made clear to me that my thoughts out at night can both influence and attract certain entities to someone’s location, some of these beings may be beneficial and can be extremely dangerous. You might ask how some can be beneficial to you. Well from what I’ve heard there are helpful entities that grant people who might come across them with money, treasures, or a sense of peace. Others don’t do anything remotely close to beneficial but aren’t exactly out to cause chaos to unfold they just more or less linger in the limbo of the Evernight. The best description I can utilize for them is in the simplest terms, weird. Events that occur be it creepy or riding on the side of weird stupid shit, for instance, there are odd occurrences, like a clown car honking its horn three times, where one of the passengers grants you a sight of a full moon on a clouded night - a peculiar incident, to say the least.

You may think to yourself ‘Oh I’m fine, it’s just creepy clowns at night.’ Yeah, many people thought the same thing back in the late 2010s and that ended up with people dead so good luck with that mentality. See in the Evernight you should have at least two rules with you encounter horrifying shit. The first option is to run like hell, or rather drive like a bat out of hell. The second and the riskier is to grab your gat and hold it sideways and explain why this bitch done fucked up. That’s assuming you have a Glock lying about inside of your car and you can hit while holding sideways. If not plan three seems to work best for some of my fellow contracted coworkers from the various parts of the great United States. Shoot and drive.

I listed the options above as such because when it comes down to it you must either fight or run. And I always say when you choose to run there is no shame in that. You’re a regular person after all not the protagonist in a novel. When it comes down to decisions you need to value your life and not play stupid games. I also give out these options because you want to learn from others, or you can be like my coworker. He told me about his time driving in the Evernight while I was still under his tutelage, he spoke to me often of his crazy experiences, and although he was extremely inebriated along with smoking way more pot than a den dedicated to growing marijuana. I listened and took away lessons from him. And before you question why he was, I don’t know why he decided to info dump his hellish stories unto me but there were plenty of bat shit tales that he experienced which most likely led to his current state however being the kind person I am, I leant him my ear. Besides when driving for nearly 12 hours a night having someone ramble about their time working the job you are taking over helps immensely for the first weeks on the job. I’m more than positive he was a sober great individual, but that person was long gone and the man I had sitting next to me was nothing more than a shell who only functioned from strong booze and somehow managed to drive sober enough to get to his destination. It was enough to keep his employment but of course, it wasn’t for long.

I made mistakes of dwelling on the terrible memories I made throughout my trips, and I allowed myself to let the supernatural influence my mind while driving and it caused stress like no other. By this point in my life, I learned that the supernatural is very much real and you should at the bare minimum give it the respect it deserves. Don’t misinterpret what I say next. When you do night drives for as long as I have, no matter the main road, or the backroads you will have an experience that will be seared into your mind or several, and you should treat it with some kind of respect. Not saying you should give a supernatural entity polite speech or anything like that. What I mean is if you encounter a monster, you treat the situation with some actual brain power and deal with it accordingly. For example, if you see a creature that resembles a human stand up screeching in the road within your headlights. You shouldn’t pull your phone out and film it and hope the cameraman rule applies to you, life is not a movie, and it may not send a saving grace to protect you in the moment that does happen.

Oh yeah, I forgot my old coworker's story, this one isn't necessarily supernatural at least I don't think it is true, but you can consider it an example of what I told you above, you should not put bad thoughts into the world, because the world may respond equally.

I remember he told me a story, on one of his travels he spotted a woman running from the wilderness into the main road and he stopped for her. Her face was that of a gorgeous model and she wore a beautiful white dress. He thought “Score.” At first and rolled his window down asking where she needed to go. He was told she needed just to get to the next town as fast as possible so that her husband wouldn’t find her and to at least take her to the hospital.

He was asking what happened to her as she got into his vehicle, and she explained to him that she was beaten by him countless times and she finally mustered up the courage to leave him. She fled with a friend who she trusted and when her husband found her, he beat her and the friend up and shot his friend. She ran away and got a ride from an Uber, but the Uber wouldn’t take her that far after they were shot at, so she fled down the road and into the wilderness. Feeling horrible for her he sped off telling her she’d be fine and that she would be taken to the hospital and the police notified.

During this trip she was asking questions and began to get sexual with him, she was being overly flirtatious and despite his better judgment, he let his little brain get the better of him. While they started getting a little busy, he had undone her dress only to discover that she had bullet wounds and stab wounds in her stomach. When he saw this the woman grew angry, she began screeching while grasping at his throat. Screaming he tried getting her off and out of the vehicle only to wake up in the truck alone on the side of the road parked. The only thing he had was the scent of her lingering and the blood still all over his clothes, driving away he shuddered in fear.

That was the story I remembered on one of my trips it was a Friday night. I got my coffee and grabbed my keys to pack up the vehicle they provided me at this old military building that was repurposed for whatever the company uses it for now. I was told to take the supplies they had ready to another contractor in a city a few hours up and come back with some supplies they had in their vehicle. The job was simple, swap the goods and get back down. If anything, else was required they would inform me through text and send me. Simple enough, normal stuff everything that this company takes always goes back to this lab up in a big city and we are sent to collect the items or trade whatever essentially, we are mostly contract couriers. The job was as simple as they come and so I made my way to grab what I needed to form the hospital as directed.

I soon began my long drive into the endless blackness of the Evernight with nothing but the destination in mind. I drove on with music playing and thoughts of ‘what horrors may come to play tonight’. That was the wrong thought because that was the day, I witnessed the first untimely deaths on the road. My mind was racing at the story my coworker told me before I was a free man doing these jobs on my own. It wasn't creepy but I wouldn't know what to do in that situation, not the horny woman in the car. But if someone was riding with me and suddenly attacked me or met someone on the side of the road who needed my help.

As for my story, I vividly remember that night—it was 2337 I was going about 87 miles an hour on the empty backroads. They were considered to be the new long toll roads however due to the pricing no one ever took them, eventually, they became free however still due to being so far out no one took them. There was a bend in the road with overgrown grass alongside a hill which was the reason I didn't see the hazard lights on the road and they weren't far at all, slamming on the brakes I came to a halt a little way from the vehicle, and my adrenaline spiked at the sudden action I had to take as I contemplated what could have happened had my reaction been a second slower. I would have collided with the vehicle and at best very injured or worse – a direct collision with the car. Illuminating the area with my high beams, I discerned a lone white Toyota Camry obstructing the road. Inside, there were figures slumped in their seats, with red stains on the window.

My instincts took over as I unbuckled my seat belt, opened the passenger storage compartment for first aid, and quickly placed it in the center console. Picking up my head and turning for my door I looked out into the night through the window and there briefly illuminated by the hazard lights was a dark figure hidden slightly in the brush. I paused my movement and stared waiting for the lights to flicker on again. As they did, I saw the figure looking at me tilt its head slightly, curious if it was spotted. It was pure luck I noticed; the figure crouched in the grass divider tucked by some of that thick brush. But it was close enough to notice.

My mind raced with thoughts. “*What should I do? Should I drive off? Open the door and scream at him to leave? No, I don’t know what he has. If I don’t do something now, he’s going to make the first move.”*

A few moments went by, and I decided to open the door, I steadied my breathing while cursing myself for doing something that could get me killed. The moment I opened the door and exited I pulled out my gun from its holster and turned my weapon light to expose the figure locking in with my red dot sight. During the few seconds I had opened my door and stepped out the figure had stood up but froze the moment, I turned that beam on and placed a hand up blocking the light in his other hand I took full notice of his still dripping red liquid-stained large knife. I held my position and demanded what he wanted from me.

No verbal response was given however his actions did give a response; he made a slicing motion on his neck as he took a step forward toward me. He must have thought I had a regular flashlight because he continued to step towards me as I yelled for him to stop. I shouted as loud as I could for him to stop moving. Even though he was a decent distance away from where I was a dead sprint from his distance is still dangerous because bullets don’t stop someone immediately. When he continued to move to me slowly, methodically this was something he was well versed in doing many, many times. I shouted for him to drop the knife and by his fourth step he stopped. I think he finally took notice that what was in my hand wasn't a normal light.

The moment he ceased all movement and that granted me precious seconds of planning. From the looks of it, I could shoot this hooded figure dead and be cleared of any wrongdoing, or I could get back into the vehicle and run away and never think about this again. Another part of me just screamed for me to shoot him and end his life. Whatever bravery the hooded figure showed earlier, he certainly lost it all as the gun was reason enough to not pick this would-be prey tonight and that was good enough for me. He took a few steps back and gave me a small wave as he casually walked away. After he got further into the grass, he gently removed the hood to show a blank mask, one of those party masks you get at a party store. The white mask had noticeable red stains scattered all over the left cheek and to contrast the messy left side was just one long bloody tear coming down from the right eye slit.

After fading into the darkness, I called the police and waited for them to get there, during that time I inspected the body that was in the car, staring up into the car was a handsome young man who was holding his neck, blood splayed across his shirt and fear painted on his face. The multiple stab wounds in his chest indicated the cause of death. In the passenger’s seat was a beautiful woman who was coughing up blood reaching for the door handle gurgling still and crying in pain, whimpering at the sight of me. I heard her cries as I ran to my car and grabbed a first aid bag. I ran to the side of the car put on the emergency gloves and pulled out gauze and other first aid equipment. I opened the door and assisted her out of the car hearing her cry holding onto me as her blood pooled onto me.

I pulled her to the light of the vehicle and began first aid. She was trying to tell me something however I didn’t understand her at all. She pointed to her stomach and told me, “It hurts. Scared.” She said in gurgled breaths. I tried to do everything I could to prevent the bleeding from continuing however I didn’t know how long she may have. I cut her shirt with the emergency scissors and looked at her body, the source of her bleeding was the three stab wounds to her stomach, I grabbed some of the clotting gauze and began putting it onto the knife wounds and wrapping them around her stomach as her cries of pain echoed into the night. Minutes felt like hours, and I held her there in the night as she kept crying out for help. She was holding onto my blood stand jacket as I kept her other hand on her wound putting pressure on it.

Occasionally the sound of a crunch echoed in the grassy patches to which my response was a sweep with my pistol with the light on and ready to shoot. My fear grew not only for me but the woman I now held in my arms, I was scared, not just for her as horrible as it sounds. I didn’t want to get stabbed by the masked man because that would mean certain death for both of us. My attention was stretched thin from both the sounds of the grass on the other side of the road and the young girl's moans of pain. The bleeding wouldn't stop so I had to help her the best way I knew how. Pulling more of the first aid out applying more of the gauze on her wound and pushing her into the recovery position.

I did my best to tell her to keep talking, fight through the pain, and keep telling me random facts about anything. My goal was to keep her away from death for as long as I could. The growing fear that I would be the last person on this planet to see her before she died was becoming a reality the longer I waited for the police.

All the while I kept on the lookout for the police. Finally, after what felt like a lifetime both law enforcement came alongside an ambulance, the relief of seeing those red and blue lights was unlike any other. I put my gun quickly away as I exclaimed to the woman she would be okay. I saw one of the medical personnel get out of the vehicle one quickly walk over to her, while I moved aside for them I didn't take note of who it was but one of the people grabbed me and promptly shoved me into the Camry.

It then hit me as the cold steel of the handcuffs placed on me, my mind registered it was a police officer who was now reading me my rights. As he was shouting at me, I could only stare into the shocked expression of the young man who lifelessly sat in the car in front of me. I could only recall being shoved into the car twice over and the cop screaming at me demanding 'What happened to him!? Tell me damn it.'

Finally, after what felt like what would have been another bashing, the man’s motion abruptly stopped, and a female voice asked me to explain myself as I felt the strong grip of the man loosen and drop away from my arms.

Turning my head to her I looked at the man who cuffed and slammed my head into the car, the startling realization that he looked remarkably like the young boy in the car. With tears rolling down his cheek I understood his frustration. The female officer took me and guided me to her car where we spoke of my encounter. I told her what had happened mentioning how I just saw a hooded figure walk away from me waving goodbye. She shook her head in disbelief however even if my brief explanation didn’t give them much to work it did seem to clear me of any involvement other than being the unlucky individual who stumbled upon the scene.

She said to me, “You know she might make it, and it's thanks to you. You’re a hero.” I looked at her almost disgusted by the word, I was not a hero that is for sure. A hero would have done more, I did not even shoot the man responsible for it.

She wrote down my information and said she would contact me if anything came up for whatever reason they would need me. But as far as they were concerned and needed. I was free to go after an hour. I thanked them and her turning I made my way to my vehicle. Driving off I looked back at the eerie sight of the red and blue flashing lights of the EMS swallowing the hazard lights which were losing their power and fading into small faint orange lights by now.

I felt regret hit me a sort of heaviness in my chest, the thing I noticed when I was there was how in the car I noticed their phones, purses, and even his backpack inside the car were not messed with just those two individuals who were murdered. They were just prey to a monster in human skin within the Evernight, it was not a robbery gone wrong, it was just murder for the sake of murder. That experience gave me a rush I didn’t want to feel, the cold feeling of adrenaline flowing through my body as I was thrust into a fight or flight response coincided with the painful guilt. The guilt of not pulling the trigger and ending his life. That unhealthy guilt of knowing I let a monster get away into the darkness of the Evernight.",1,1730388116.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

1ggh221,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ggh221/stripped_shower_screen_screw_alternate_solution/,Stripped shower screen screw - alternate solution [Rancilio Silvia v1],"This solution may also work for other machines, and is not specific to the Silvia necessarily.

I've had this unit for many years, and among the upgrades was a replacement shower screen, which was shaped to allow for a flush-fit screw, which has a recessed hex head.  At some point, almost a year ago, I stripped this screw head, and none of my attempts to remove it were successful. Short of welding on a nut or post, the last documented option I'd read about was the ""taco"" - folding the shower screen in the hopes of it grabbing the bolt, and then using pliers to turn the screen and screw together.

Well, I had the original screen (along with a spare flush hex screw), so while I would gladly sacrifice the screen to be able to get the screw out, it didn't seem like a great option if it failed, as I know it has for at least one person. Also, this particular shower screen is no longer available, and I'd rather keep it if possible (in case it's relevant, I'll mention it was the ""flat shower screen upgrade kit"" sold by Fruition Tamp & Coffee).

So, I got the idea to try turning the shower screen by the edges. Got my largest pliers, and got to work. Once I was able to get the right angle (tricky without disassembling the whole unit) it came right off with minimal damage to the outer edge of the shower screen. Once I had backed the screen out enough that it wasn't ""grabbing"" the screw any longer, I was able to turn the screw by hand the rest of the way out.

Suffice it to say, the head was in dire need of a scrub, along with the screen itself.  But, after I got the gunk off, and 1 tablet of cafiza later, it was all gleaming again.  I'm getting much better flow through the puck, and I can see that the backflush output is much peppier.

1gggz06,https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/federal-employee-washington-dc-salary-money-diary,Throwback Thursday: Oh What  A Week! High Spending in Washington D.C. (lite),"Well hello Commanders of the comment section, this week we take a trip to our nation’s capital to check in with this 2019 diarist who had a lot to buy. 

This diary is another where I didn’t quite remember details from the title alone but by the time I got to having two roommates in a two-bed apartment I said “oh.” I’m trying not to pass judgment but I feel like OOP has a decent salary but not much to show for it. Except for two bags she might hate. 

Obviously this diary is before the background questions but I feel pretty confident in saying OOP likely has some credit card debt that is covered under the “other loans” category in her monthly expenses. I’m not going to assign a diagnosis to OOP but to me, this reads as though she doesn’t just have a shopping problem. She has a spending problem. She spends money for any problem or inconvenience she may encounter and justifies her purchases by the “What Ifs.” Seeing her spend money on coffee all week only to be find out she has a Nespresso at the very end of the diary? Agatha Christie wishes she could have written a twist like that. 

My final thoughts - I feel like this diary doesn’t give me any sense of who OOP is because everything is related to a purchase. I very much doubt that spending money can be her entire personality but there’s no insight to be gained from her entries. Just a mental calculation of what type of credit card debt she might have. 

Also - I spent $25 on two salads from Cava in one day. I regret nothing and if given the opportunity to go back and do it again, I would.

Question of the Day: What are your Halloween plans? I’m finishing up my “scary” book, eating leftovers and not handing out candy. I bought candy one year and no one came to my house so never again!  ",17,1730387801.0,MoneyDiariesACTIVE,9,1.0,False

It might just become your most prized possession.","There was a good thread about [making email addresses](https://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/1ggbnwa/lpt_make_email_addresses_for_your_kids_and_write/) for your kids and sending them regular notes. I posted in there about having a ""family log book"" and someone suggested I make a thread about it.

When my kids were very young I bought a large, leather bound notebook and started adding little details to help us remember the little things that are easily forgotten. I tend to write a short sentence or two about the big events, and the mundane events equally. Birthday parties, Halloween Costumes, Weekend Roadtrips, lost teeth, school teachers, doctor visits, dance recitals etc

When the house is quiet and the kids are still sleeping, I'll sit with a cup of coffee and add a couple notes about what happened in the last week. I'll add the date in the margin and the month on the top of the page. Then I'll flip back a year, two years, five years and see what the family was doing. Today I had a great reminisce about Halloween costumes!

I tend to fill about a page per month, so it's not a lot of work. It's different than a scrap book or a photo album and I find that it's the quirky little details that might not mean much that REALLY stick out. Like when my daughter could only say ""runny"" instead of ""funny"", so I got a lot of ""Daddy Runny"". Sometimes the kids and I will sit in the big comfy chair and flip back to see what we were up to. It's a literal way-back machine.

Anyway, it might not be for everyone, but if writing things down is your vibe, I highly suggest starting a log book. Mine has become my most prized possession.",11,1730387759.0,daddit,5,1.0,False

Their both slobs. So many times my mom has left coffee in cups until it gets moldy, my dad ruining one of my waterbottles from the amount of mold. Unless I do the dishes, they are left in the sink until they grow mold, get a film on them, or there is a dish mountain and even then my mom only does half of them.

My dad doesnt clean around the house, he doesn't even clean his shaved hair from his bathroom sink. Their bathroom garbage is over flowing so much that its almost as tall as the counter, all they do when their home is sit on their phone. The only normal hygiene habits they have is that they shower and use deodorant. We don't eat healthy very often, most of the time its just ramen

I can see myself developing their habits and that is the last thing I want. I know that I'm overweight, i can feel myself getting addicted to my phone just like my mom. They never taught me basic hygiene, the importance of exercise or good habits. My education has been my top priority ever since middle school, they tell me im crazy for caring so much, or ""It's not that important, just use ChatGBT and chill the f out.""

I can't bring this up to anyone in my family because they tell me I'm being rude or ""Once you get your own house then you can control it.""

My point is that I need help, I don't want to be like my parents but I haven't been taught anything different. I have two years before i graduate and turn into an adult, & I want to reverse this as much as possible becuase I don't want my home to be like theirs",1,1730387746.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

Life as a busy entrepreneur can get hectic, so I’m looking to meet new friends nearby who also enjoy meaningful conversations, exploring Dubai, or just relaxing over a cup of coffee. I’d especially love to meet some new female friends, as I find I usually get along well with different perspectives and enjoy a balanced mix of personalities around me.

I'm considering a Grand Rapids 80X30 setup but had a few questions:

*  Are there plans to do a Black Friday/Anniversary Sale?  If I buy today--am I going to regret this in a month? 
* I see that rubber mats are not recommended on the surface.  Is there a recommended mouse pad to prevent damage to the top? 
* I'm going to need a CPU attachment and likely cable management solutions.  Are there any recommended by DeskHaus?  
* I feel like I always have coffee/water on my desk.  Are coasters typically recommended?  Are there solutions to protect the surface that you would recommend? 
   * Is this a concern with all wood surfaces?  Is there anything that makes DeskHaus better/worse than others?

  
I was about to pull the trigger on the Uplift 4 leg to save a few bucks, but have concerns removing the back support to allow me to mount monitors.  The quality of the desk top appears to be better with DeskHaus, but I guess I'm looking for anything else to help convince me that it's worth spending an extra \~1500-2000 to go DeskHaus over Uplift.  

Hope this isn't offensive--but another key concern with DeskHaus is the fact that they're a smaller company and I'm unsure if they'll be around in 10 years.  I'm happy to spend 4K on a desk if I know it's a lifetime purchase.  I'm scared about happens if my desk breaks and DeskHaus was no longer in business.  For what it's worth, customer service with DeskHaus seems to be better than Uplift.  As a tech nerd--customer service is huge for me and easily worth an extra 10% upcharge, which is another reason DeskHaus is high on my list but I'm assuming the 20 year warranty is voided if DeskHaus is no longer around.

I know there's a lot of information out there, but it's a big purchase so I guess I'm just looking for someone to call something out that I'm not considering or reassure me this is the right decision.

""You don't believe me when I tell you that I like the noises you make when you sleep,  
And I don't believe you when you tell me that my voice is your favorite sound,  
Not when you can sing like that.

One of your exes names tastes like stale coffee in my mouth,  
And the other one burns as if I've swallowed a scalding pot.  
You don't understand why I don't discuss my first love with you,  
But how am I supposed to tell the Sun that i once fell for the moon?

If I could, I'd pay rent for the spaces between your fingers,  
So if anyone else tried to intertwine their hands with yours,  
They would be trespassing.

I'm very good at useless metaphors,  
And very bad at telling people how I feel,  
But on our worst nights, you're snow in the month of March  
and even though I'm sick of winter,  
I will never stop appreciating the beauty of a blizzard.""

Totoo bang manager to o oportunista lang riding on someone else's fame for clout in hopes of making a name for himself? Pag manager ka kasi, dapat may connections ka para mabigyan mo ng projects alaga mo.

Handler ba talaga to ni JM o promoter ni Fyang? Gatas na gatas niya kasi si Fyang eh palibhasa malakas engagement nung bata sa FB. Mauumay cvs and fans sa ginagawa niya. Hindi na nabuild up yung ""sense of exclusivity"" or nabigyan ng chance yunb management irebuild yung image nung big winner kasi bira siya nang bira para lang sa FB engagements. Useless naman ng mga posts niya. Pakialamero siya masyado.

Yung posts niya noon is encouraging hate towards Jas na wala namang ginagawang masama sa alaga niya. Sobranv mysoginist pa. Walang ka-class class. Hindi naman magkakaroon ng ganun kalaking pag-asa yung fandom kung hindi dahil sa 🚩 niyang alaga. (See other posts about him dito sa thread.)

Ngayon naman na-u-undermine niya yung ABS-CBN management & Ms. Portia kasi gamit na gamit niya si Fyang. Panay dikit dun sa red flag niyang alaga para maambunan ng clout nung pagiging big winner.

Adults with behavior like this 🤮 di nila hayaan mag shine yung tao. Akala ko ba JM can shine on his own daw at di kailangan ng loveteam? Kailangan talaga i-drag back? Nakikipiggy back sa fame eh ambigat niya buhatin kasi hindi naman famous tsaka wala siyang media training. Hindi din naman part ng ABS at ng PBB. Sino ba to?

I'm so happy for Jas at nakalayo and nailayo siya dito.

She blocked me on everything and I was forced to move on. Every couple weeks she would unblock me and then block me. Recently she unblocked me and told me she’s gonna keep me unblocked and wants to be friends. We’ve been texting here and there and hanging out. We usually hang out for like an hour or two get a coffee or something. The other day we got a coffee together and someone with contact name of a guy kept calling her like 8 times. I didn’t question it I kept looking to the side and trying to ignore it. Seeing it hurt so bad. He spammed her so many times so it got me thinking they obviously called or talk before cause he’s spamming her. After we got done hanging out she asked if I still wanted to get ice cream with her tmr and I said yes but I was actually hurt. I got jealous and looked up the name on her insta when I got home I saw someone by that same name likes all her photos. I’m so confused on why she’s still talking to me and still wants to hang out even tho she’s talking to someone else. I love her so much and waited 3 months for her to come back. Everything seemed like it was going good but I don’t know if she’s dating this person but they obviously call a lot because he spammed her so many times. Should I make plans with her and tell her how I really feel. Should I block her and never talk to her again? I want her back so bad but I feel like this might hurt me even more. We dated for two years and I don’t want to ruin more years of my life chasing her but i genuinely wanted to spend the rest of my life with her. I’m pretty sure she’s bipolar or has borderline personality disorder she just recently turned 18 so she was never officially diagnosed. She’s been taking medicine ever since we met I don’t know if it has anything to do with that but she still does or used to take pills called lithium. I just want her back what do I do.  ,1,1730386905.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1gggmkj,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1gggmkj/what_happened_to_creating_positive_relationships/,What happened to creating positive relationships in tech recruiting?,"I just saw a post by a university recruiter in big tech discussing how they do not want to have a 'coffee chat' with any candidates, and that if they have questions they can look online.

I understand the repetitive nature of university recruiting (especially these days) with a massive influx of candidates, I can only imagine what the inboxes of these recruiters looks like.  
  
On the contrary, roles focused in consulting, sales, and finance all encourage the exact opposite while still encountering large volume. Candidates are encouraged to meet with professionals at the company, recruiters, managers, and anyone to establish a relationship. Coffee chats are normalized for anyone interested in the role.

I feel that tech used to be built upon interacting on the up and up. Recruiters and engineers at big companies used to encourage proper networking, not gatekeep their connection unless your resume was seen fit. 

I understand that there will never be time to connect with everyone (especially from a recruiter standpoint) but being completely closed off to any sort of to informal meetings limits the candidates ability to find out more about the companies and make relationships within the company even when not working there. I feel being open to meet with more candidates prior to the application/interview process would help streamline your applicants to ensure that they are qualified for the process and the role itself, especially for early talent.

I am curious as to why so many recruiters/companies have stopped having informal chats with students.",1,1730386902.0,cscareerquestions,4,0.67,False

1gggk2i,https://www.reddit.com/r/wedding/comments/1gggk2i/family_making_their_own_event/,Family making their own event,"My fiance's extended family lives in our town and they are lovely. His grandmother is 90 and she is rightfully doted on by the rest of us. We are always going out of our way to make her happy and she is a wonderful person. However...

We've been engaged for 1.5 years and planning our wedding for a year. It's in a week (eep)! It's a Sunday wedding so we have a family dinner with both families on Friday, a welcome party on Saturday, and wedding Sunday afternoon. We planned the weekend's schedule very carefully and intentionally, trying to balance the hosting duties/honors of both families, respect people's time, create a manageable weekend we can both handle running (it's a very DIY wedding,) and many other factors.

Last WEEK, his grandma decided she wants to host a brunch for both families at her house on the wedding morning. With two weeks to go to the wedding, she suddenly has this idea. 

She goes to my fiance, who has strong boundaries, to tell him her idea. He tells her very firmly we are not adding another two-family event to the weekend and especially not the wedding day. But of course, he can't stop her from having her own kids and grandkids over to her own home, so he says go ahead and plan to just have her own family over.

But she's upset, because she thinks it will be rude to host a family brunch and not invite my family. She worries she'll offend my family. Which I can see her point.

She emails me the next day to tell me she ""very much"" wants to invite my family to this brunch she is planning, and to let her know by the next DAY because she's going shopping.

I emailed back and said no. With my fiance's support (he's the best).

Then I started having second thoughts. The last thing I want is to piss off my fiance's grandma before our wedding. Maybe I'm being too harsh and overthinking. It's just some coffee and bagels. Whatever.

I went over and said on second thought, okay I'll invite my family. They all burst out laughing and basically told me they thought it was so weird how I was keeping my family from coming.

Of course this brunch is already becoming my problem. We had to go buy food for it. We're also borrowing the family's folding chairs to set up at our house for the whole weekend (arranged this months ago) as we are having pre and post wedding hangouts there. When they realized (because I told them) that their folding chairs weren't going to be available for their big brunch, they suggested that WE rent chairs because they will need the chairs for the brunch.

Yes, because two weeks before my wedding I want to be calling around to rental companies to rent 12 chairs, and then dealing with their flaky assess (I work in local events, there is no such thing as a reliable rental company in my area, they're all terrible). We are NOT renting anything for our wedding, not one single thing. I have gone to great lengths, borrowing and buying and planning for months now, to ensure this as it was very important to me.

When we went to drop off the food, the whole family was outside pruning, mowing, etc. getting the place ready for brunch. This brunch has become grandmother's main focus and now the whole family is all running around for the next week getting ready for the brunch. Like, um, hi... We also have a pretty big event that same day and have asked you all for this same exact help at our place. No pressure, we can do it all ourselves (and already mostly have) and it's on us for not asking, but seeing everyone launch into gear to get ready for this damn brunch, well, I'm just wondering if they'll have time or energy to help us with wedding prep this week.

Honestly, the thing that really makes this situation tough is the timeline. Had all these conversations happened months ago, no problem. I'm sure we could have all talked it out and made a decision. But now we're two weeks out planning a DAY OF wedding event?!? 

I've literally already sent the weekend schedule to all my family members. Months ago.

Also, I can't even go to this brunch. I'll be getting ready with my friends with my own brunch, which has been planned for months.

I recently started at a hardware store, I’ve had one shift of shadowing and work Fri-Sun. It seemed very boring. The probably 4.5 hours of shadowing were awful, I know it’s worse when you aren’t doing anything but there was lots of down time. I’m used to working fast paced jobs. A job I applied for in addition to the hardware store was a new coffee place (7brew), coming to my area. I got the job but I don’t know if I should stay at the hardware store, or let them know I found something better suited for me. there is most definitely pros and cons but I don’t want to hate a job when I have to spend time away from my child.

I've lost 5lbs this past week! Waking up to being out of the 200 club was euphoric LOL

Little to no nausea, still able to workout at Orangetheory and do my adult gymnastics class. I had to take it a little easier but I still worked my butt off!

I definitely watch how fast I eat, if I eat to fast I get a solid “icky” feeling but I wouldn’t even call it nausea. I haven't had a food make me sick yet. I had Chick-fil-A yesterday and finished my sandwich, but barely touched my fries. It's weird it's like I don't *want* the fries? And I ordered a cherry coke out of habit..but then a few sips in I changed it to half sweet/unsweet tea bc the cherry coke just..wasn't good to me. I feel like I eat pretty normally, I just definitely can tell I have to eat slower. I drink coffee every morning and that never fails to make me poop so little to no constipation either. 

Overall 9/10 experience, can’t wait to see what happens in week 2! 

Just did my second shot this morning because I want to see how I feel during the day. Last week I did my shot at night so I figured I’d try it the other way.

A little about me:
- I love 80's aesthetic and music, but I love WAY too many different genres of music, like metal, rock, indie, and even stuff like hyperpop and phonk!
- I absolutely love anything nature or anything outdoor related, nature is one of the only things that keeps me grounded and going, which also means I'm super passionate about the climate crisis and will rant about it :')
- I also like plants, reading, video games, hiking, tea, coffee, researching about my current hyperfixation, movies/shows, yapping, etc. when I have free time which is.. not often recently 😭😭
- I've got ADHD and say random shit, but it just makes me funny I swear!
- I am short :3 usually wearing 80's aesthetic but I also like some femme clothing I just can't wear it irl, oh also I'm a furry sooo yeah :33

Anywayyyyy if you're looking for friends, I'd love to have someone to just text and talk to about random stuff, and also someone who can relate to deep topics like having a constant existential crisis and trying not to explode thinking about the current state of the environment!!

And hooooo boy what a place to stay! 

First off, this property is perfectly placed in the Catskills. The leaves were turning their brilliant shades of fall colors and our room had a balcony with full view of it. The property itself is very well maintained and resembles a classic mountain chateau. There are some primitive architectural choices in parts (unfinished wood on the walkway that still has its branding visible, painted Home Depot poles as the handrails), but once you look past that you'll find the property is a beautiful place to spend and fall weekend at.

It is also chock-full of things to do. There are saunas outside each building. There is a heated outdoor pool that was perfect for the (somehow) 78 degrees weather. Fire pits are lit every night for making s'mores. The cellar is a game room with a billiards table, a couple arcade cabinets, and more. But above all, the property has free scheduled events to shake things up. During our stay, there was axe throwing and Dia de los Muertos sugar skull painting. 

The attached restaurant, the Babbler, had some wonderful choices for brunch and dinner. At the time of our stay there were a couple of weddings going on so the property was chock full of people, which meant the restaurant was also packed, but the service was still top-notch and without delay. Additionally, there is a smaller coffee shop attached to that sells their hot drinks and coffees along with great slices of pie. 

And I would be remiss to leave out the service. We were taking care of extremely well with not only great guest and lobby services, but tiny little add-ons that made our stay that much better. Our room was gifted a bag of their apple cider donuts and chocolate-covered strawberries. They had hot cider free for guests in the lobby, and as I was pouring a cup for myself, a staff member offered to spike mine with a little Jim Bean.

Overall, this was a fantastic Catskills stay that I'm strongly considering coming back to for the Winter.",12,1730386466.0,hyatt,4,1.0,False

It's newly renovated and in a prime location. However, the previous homeowners left the house a mess; apparently, they were in a rush and left a lot of their crap behind. While tossing out their stuff, some notebooks, scraps of paper, and other junk fell out of a box, and you can say curiosity got the best of me. I decided to read through some of it. The first couple of notepads were filled with notes and electrical stuff—I guess the previous owner was an electrician or something. However, right before I was ready to call it quits and toss it all out, I came across a notebook with a short story in it. I noticed that throughout all the notebooks and pads, there were random jots and blurbs. Some of the writing is rushed and hard to read, but as I piece this story together, I decided I'd share it here! It’s all a mess though; a lot of writing was probably done in the spur of the moment. Sadly, we never got to meet the sellers at closing, so we won't be able to give this back; they apparently had already left the state before we closed.

Anyway, I'll be releasing the story as I compile it. Let me know what you think, and if you think you know the authors, please let me know! I’d love to return their work. Anyway, here it is!

Chapter 1: The Dream

My cheeks twitched slightly as the black haze of sleep started to lift. A soft groan left my throat as I stretched my neck to a more comfortable position. I heard my wife moving as well—the comfortable shuffling sound that bed sheets make. She just couldn't seem to get comfortable though, as the grogginess cleared up and sleep was leaving me entirely. “Are you okay?” I mumbled, putting my arm around her, annoyed that my sleep was ruined. My waking ears kept twitching as they focused in on the sound. It was a soft shuffling sound—swish-pull-step-swish-pull-step. Maybe my wife Selene was going to the bathroom, I thought, as I gently tightened my arms around her warm, tender frame.

My eyes jutted open, and my body tensed; I felt my skin crawl as my brain shocked itself awake. My mind began spinning with realization—even if she was shuffling to the bathroom, our master bathroom is right here. Right in front of the bed. That isn't much of a walk. And she's lying right next to me. In my arms. Gently snoring. Not moving a single inch. My ears zoned in. Was this a mouse? An animal? No... No, this wasn't a mouse—it wasn't any kind of small animal! I don't have to be an audio expert with perfect hearing to know that this noise is not animalistic at all.

After a few seconds, I realized we were being burglarized. Someone was in my home right now at this very moment. My home is a ranch—everything is one floor. Selene and I are first-time homeowners and have been living here in perfect suburbia for five months—a stark contrast to our chaotic environment in the city. The house is practically open-concept, with a hallway from the living room leading straight to our master bedroom. Admittedly, most sounds breaking the silence tend to scare us in our newfound environment. Our refrigerator loves popping out random ice cubes like mini gunshots, and Selene's been having it the hardest with random noises. This wouldn't be the first time something crazy has happened to us.

And now I heard what sounded like shuffling in the living room.

The creak and groan of our wood floors matched with the constant slow footsteps. It sounded like someone was searching around for something in short distances—an item that kept eluding them. I heard the pillows on the couch bump around and the coffee table move as my ears continued to zone in. My heart started to pound heavily, and I felt a tightness around my chest.

Slowly, and as quietly as possible, I leaned over to my nightstand and opened it to grab my handgun. As panic continued to swell in my chest, my wife started shifting and waking up, whether due to me or the intruder I don't know, and I quickly shushed her with my hand over her mouth. She's feisty and immediately gave me an angry look, probably more upset to be jarred awake. Selene tends to jump to conclusions without thinking— a headstrong woman with a strong personality, but she's also an amazing partner and knows exactly what to do when I'm serious. She motions to speak, but stays quiet once she notices the gun in my hand.

""There's someone in our living room, or at least I think,"" I whisper as lowly as I can, slowly and quietly heading over to unlock the bedroom door. I carefully opened the door, leaving it slightly ajar to avoid making noise, and made my way down the hallway. My wife was sitting on the bed with her phone in hand, probably calling the police.

In hindsight, I should have stayed in the bedroom and let the police handle this situation; however, I can be quite a brave idiot.

My heart was pounding hard as the warm sensation of blood rushed to my face. Growing up in the city, I found myself in many dangerous situations, but I never could have realized how much more terrifying it was to have an intruder in your home in the early morning. As I crept closer, I saw the hunched back of a figure wearing a black tank top and baggy black shorts. My coffee table blocked the view from his calves down. The figure had pale white skin—seemingly Caucasian, maybe even albino—and its bent-over frame had its hands in the crevices of my couch. It wore either a tight black beanie or maybe it had a thick buzzcut; the distance was too far to be certain. I wondered what it expected to find in my couch; certainly it wasn't looking for dust bunnies or loose change.

Slowly walking closer, I aimed my firearm at the intruder; the floor creaked under me. He stood up quickly, startled, his head whipping in my direction to look directly at me as the rest of him slowly turned around. As he turned, everything about him seemed to shift, almost shimmering in the light streaming through the bay window blinds, as if he was made out of fine silver-colored sand. His pale skin tone shimmered to a tan tone, and a tattoo morphed on his chest and arms, mimicking the same tattoos on my upper body. I froze, staring at my doppelganger. His body was no longer albino in a black outfit but instead was shirtless, wearing sweatpants, with my messy bed head and hairline—and holding something...

I faced myself. I was holding a firearm, and he was holding what I perceived to be a firearm, but something about it looked off. I took a step. He—I?—took a step. I walked toward him. He did the same. I stopped a short distance away, and he mimicked me. My chest pounded as my reflection's face grew slightly red. I can only imagine that was how I looked. My breathing was calm yet heavy. So was his, but without the sound of breaths being taken. I took a step backward, aimed at him, and he mimicked each movement until he backed into the coffee table and fell.

I took this opportunity and fired off six bullets into him, five making their mark. I almost feared I might feel the pain myself.

My wife ran down the hall to see the scene unfolding. “Please tell me you're seeing what I'm seeing,” I pleaded. My wife confirmed my sanity. “Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, what the hell is that? What the hell is this? What is going on?”

“CALM DOWN,” my mirror image screamed, and I fired two more rounds into him.

The silence stood heavy in the air.

“That was not your voice,” my wife stated as we watched blood pour out of him—more like sand flowing out of a vial than liquid. My body lurched forward as my name, “CASSIAN!” screamed out. My neck was punctured by two rows of teeth, and my doppelganger was standing back up.

Fear immediately struck my heart as I went to grab the being behind me and—BEEP BEEP BEEP—my morning alarm was going off. My heart was pounding, my body soaked in sweat. My wife groaned, “Turn off the alarm, Cassian.” I turned off the alarm and stood up—the pounding in my chest dissipating as I realized that all I went through was a vivid dream. I checked the magazine to my firearm and counted fifteen bullets. All was well… Just a horrible dream. I went to the bathroom, washed my face, and wrote every detail I remembered down as my wife woke up. I began telling Selene about the dream as I jotted it down in my brown notepad. Reliving it through speech actually helped with jotting everything down.

“That's got to mean something; maybe we should play the lottery?” Selene joked as she went to shower.

Ahh, Selene. She believes in astrology, mythical things, and that rocks and essential oils can influence a person or put them to sleep, but she won’t believe me.

We got prepared for work. I normally work remotely, but today I was heading down to Philadelphia for a survey. As I put my coat on and made my way toward the kitchen to make my morning coffee before heading to my car, I decided to take a moment and stare into the living room. Everything looked utterly normal. Nothing changed. No evidence of an attack.

Nothing.

Until something shiny caught my eye…

And that, my friends, is what he has written down on the first page of this notebook. The next pages seem to be notes jotted down for an office in 16th and Market Street; no idea where that’s at though. If you'd like to hear more of this story, let me know; I think it's kind of creepy because I can personally visualize it a bit since, ya know, I live here and obviously this house was his inspiration.

Edit: Hey, I decided to peek around the living room, and I noticed a hole in the floor—it looks to be patched by some wood putty and revarnished.. refinished? I don't know. Maybe I’m being paranoid, but could bullet holes be that easy to fix? I never owned a gun before, I only know about them from movies. Maybe it’s actually just a knot in the wood, and I’m being paranoid. I don't know; let me know what you think.

A local donut/coffee shop closed recently due to stop selling donuts and people stopped going and it couldn’t survive as a coffee shop alone.

I never got a complete answer to there demise but it sounded very much like a lockdown business which initially thrived, took on too many staff etc and didn’t price correctly. The donuts were too cheap apparently.

If done correctly should there be money in the concept or would it be better suited to a market stall type business?

Andy thoughts would be appreciated.

Overwhelmed by my sudden rush of emotions, I hurried downstairs before he could leave the closet, trying to appear busy. I grabbed a cloth and began wiping the kitchen counter, even though it was spotless.

 

A minute passed, and I heard him come down the stairs. Keeping my back to him, I continued cleaning, hoping to avoid any interaction. Relief washed over me when I heard the front door open and close. He didn’t say anything.

 

I needed a job—something to save up for law school in Seattle. I remembered a café just down the street. Maybe it was time to venture out and try my luck there.

 

I pulled on a light purple sleeveless top with thin straps, paired it with my favorite jeans, and tied my hair into a high ponytail. Grabbing my phone, I stepped outside for the first time since I arrived.

 

The fresh air was a welcome change, and a gentle breeze tickled my skin as I walked down the street. The overcast sky mirrored my mood, but for a moment, I found comfort in the simple beauty of it all. Soon, I arrived at the café: Love & Coffee.

 

Suppressing the urge to judge the name, I took a deep breath and pushed the glass door open. The warm scent of coffee and pastries enveloped me, instantly soothing my nerves. The café’s simple elegance, with its white and brown décor, felt inviting.

 

The counter was busy, but I managed to squeeze into the line. When it was my turn, I approached the girl taking orders. “Excuse me,” I stammered, “I’m...looking for a part-time job. Could I...speak to the manager?”

Her understanding smile eased my anxiety. “Hang on, I’ll get the owner for you.”

 

A minute later, she returned with a man following behind her. He appeared to be in his mid-twenties, with messy dark curls and striking green eyes. Dressed in black from head to toe, he wore a warm smile.

 

He led me to a table and gestured for me to sit. “So, you’re looking for a job?” His voice was friendly, his tone casual.

 

“Yes,” I replied, struggling to steady my nerves. “I really need one. I don’t have much experience, but I’m a fast learner and willing to do anything.”

 

A waiter appeared with two glasses of water, and he slid one toward me with a soft chuckle. “Relax. Drink some water first. You look nervous.”

1ggg3vl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ggg3vl,Here's a few pics from the last 3 day public camping trip I guided in Okefenokee! (Floyd's Island and Mixons Hammock),"Hi to any new folks here reading this! I'm the owner and lead guide of Okefenokee & Satilla Expeditions LLC, and I started this subreddit to bring together redditors who love the great Okefenokee Swamp as much as I do. It makes me so happy to share it with people, that's why I made it my career! I am Federally licensed to guide in the Swamp. 

On this past trip, we set out from Stephen C. Foster State Park, entered Billy's Lake (at which point you are no longer in the state park, you are now solely in Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge, which the park is within), and made our way 9 miles upstream to Floyd's Island in the heart of the Swamp. One of my absolute favorite places to be. It's filled with history and just being there is a special accomplishment that many never do.

The next morning, we set out downstream on the Middle Fork Run to head back to Billy's Lake, and then to the island called Mixons Hammock. A few trees had fallen recently there but it didn't affect our camping much. The raccoons were relentless!

The next morning, spirits high from 2 nights in the swamp, we made our way back to Stephen C. Foster State Park, unloaded, packed up, and said our goodbyes. I had a fabulous group of 3 people and the camaraderie during the trip was terrific.

Our next guided 3 day canoe camping trip in Okefenokee open for public registration is coming up on November 15th-17th! We'll be heading to Monkey Lake and Coffee Bay on the east side of the Swamp.

(Intense adventurous things, usually surrounding a common interest, not necessarily like…hey let’s go get coffee. I hate “dates.”) I make it very clear that I like who they are as a person when most people don’t really even cross my radar. I also make it very clear that I do not *need* them. But I want them, which, in my opinion, is better honestly. (They’re not filling a niche in my life or being used for anything, I just like who they are and want to be around them. They’re adding to my life by just existing.)

That’s usually met with some hesitation from guys, which I hate, because I’m so impatient. So whenever they’re wishy-washy, they tend to fall to the periphery and I pursue something else for the time being while they make up their mind. I don’t mind the chase as long as we’re playing tag. Or at least if I’m getting somewhere every time I make a move.

Commitment is scary, but if I really love someone I’ll do it. When I’m in love, I try to heal all of their little emotional wounds. I share every thought I have with them because I’m so happy I finally found someone who’s willing to “join me on my planet.”

1ggg0ki,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladviceofftopic/comments/1ggg0ki/guilty_with_widely_known_suppressed_proof_the/,Guilty with widely known suppressed proof? [The Practice S3 spoilers],"I was just watching the practice and I got to the episode with the nun killer. 

The episode in question revolves around the following situation: 

A guy with previous convictions for violent crimes is arrested because the police found, in a closet in his house, a nun cut up into pieces, along with the murder weapon with his fingerprints on it. He says she was not kidnapped as she went to his house willingly. The other nuns at the covenant confirm this. 

The reason the police were in his house is because after killing the nun, he lured another girl to his apartment (willingly), they had sex (consensual), but the morning after he left to get coffee before this other girl woke up, and he locked her in his apartment while he went out. 

Other girl wakes up, panicks, calls the police, police come and bust down the door, girl is free. However girl says ""the guy said he has guns in his closet"". Police use a crowbar to open the closet and the finely chopped nun falls out along with the murder weapon. 

Meanwhile they arrest the guy while he is outside the building, heading back from the coffee shop, with 2 coffees (for him and the girl he locked in the apartment). 

The conclusion of the episode was that the guy had to be set free because the protagonists joined the case and argued that the police had no warrant for the closet, and once they had freed the girl who had been locked in the apartment, they should have waited for a warrant. 

Now, my questions are:

1) what would be realistic to happen here, where the guy is very, very likely guilty, but all evidence is suppressed? Half the nation knows his face and what he allegedly did and the very clear (but inadmissible) evidence. Does he have a claim *with reasonable chances of winning* against the police or state because he is now in danger? (in the episode one of the protagonists was hit with eggs thrown at her) 

2) Is the police out of luck unless they can find another way to implicate him? The other nuns know that the dead nun was friendly with the killer and they know she went to his house. Can the police do something with this? Like get a ""retroactive warrant"" to get the suppressed chopped up nun back into evidence? My gut says 'no' because the rules of evidence are designed to punish an attitude of ""get evidence now and find a way to apologize for it later"" but I am not sure.

3) Any other likely outcomes from this situation?

The afternoon drifted into a quiet hum of activity as the café began to fill up. Atlas sent me out to serve water to the new arrivals, and I was so focused on not spilling a single drop that I didn’t even glance up at the table.

As I placed the glasses down, a voice broke through my concentration—one I hadn’t heard in years. ""Drea?""

My heart stuttered. There, standing before me, was Adrian. After all these years. Alive. My throat tightened as emotion surged. ""Adrian?""

Tears stung my eyes as we stared at each other, neither of us daring to move, still trying to grasp the reality that he was standing there, whole and unharmed.

“Drea!"" He quickly stepped forward, gripping my hand as if afraid I might vanish. ""I can't believe you're here!""

He was back. After three long years of wondering, worrying, and sleepless nights, he was really here. My mind raced with a thousand questions, emotions twisting inside me.

""You should be saying that to me! You disappeared without a word!"" My voice wavered, an odd mix of anger, relief, and disbelief. ""I didn't have your number, I didn't know if you were okay. I thought—""

He cut me off, guilt written all over his face. ""I know, I know. I'm sorry. I left without saying anything because I didn’t want to drag you into my mess.”

“Messed up?” I scoffed, hurt and frustration boiling over. ""I lost my best friend, Adrian. I was alone!""

His head dropped, and he whispered, ""I’m so sorry, Drea. I promise, I’m not going anywhere again.""

The soft clearing of a throat interrupted us, and I realized we weren’t alone. A woman sat nearby, cradling a baby boy in her arms, and a little girl perched next to her, wide-eyed and curious. They all watched us with mild curiosity.

Adrian looked over and rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly. “Oh, right. Drea, this is my wife, Darcy. And these are my kids—Isla and Josh.”

I blinked, trying to process the words. His wife? Kids? “Oh... hi,” I managed, giving them an awkward wave. Darcy smiled warmly, while Isla waved back with the enthusiasm only a child could muster.

“It’s Isla’s third birthday today,” Adrian added with a soft chuckle.

“Happy Birthday, Isla,” I said gently, though my mind was racing.

Isla’s face lit up. “Thank you! Are you Aunt Drea? Daddy told us all about you!”

I shot Adrian a confused glance. Aunt Drea?

Adrian grinned. “Yes, Isla. This is Aunt Drea.”

Before I could react further, I heard Atlas calling me back to the kitchen, pulling me away from the whirlwind of emotions I was feeling.

“I’ll catch up with you later, Adrian,” I said hurriedly, dashing back inside.

The rest of the afternoon passed in a blur, with Adrian’s family lingering for Isla’s birthday cake. We exchanged polite smiles, but I knew we needed more time to really talk about everything that had happened. There was too much to say, too many questions I still had.

Hours later, after my shift had ended, I stepped out of the café and mentally kicked myself. I’d forgotten to get Adrian’s number. Again. How could I be so ridiculous? After all these years, I still hadn’t managed to ask for his contact details.

Just as I was internally scolding myself, I collided with someone outside.

“Drea,” a familiar voice called out, and I looked up to see Adrian standing in front of me, his expression soft and warm. “I was just coming to see you.”

“Adrian?” I blinked, surprised. “I thought you left hours ago.”

He shrugged, that boyish smile of his spreading across his face. “I did. But I came back because we still have a lot to talk about.”

I nodded, my heart pounding. “Yeah, we do.”

“Want to take a walk?”

Without thinking, I agreed. We strolled through the streets, avoiding any route near my house. I didn’t want Sorin to know about this. Not yet.

“So…” Adrian’s voice cut through the silence, a teasing note in his tone. “You got married.”

I shot him a sideways glance. “How do you know?”

“Really? It was all over the news. Didn’t you see it?”

I fiddled with my fingers, nerves bubbling to the surface. “Oh…”

He laughed softly, shaking his head. “Yeah. To Sorin Zaveri, no less. I was shocked but also happy for you. You’ve always loved him, Drea. Seems like your dream came true.”

His excitement was palpable, but his words only made my chest tighten. I couldn’t lie to him. Not after everything we’d been through.

I swallowed hard and stopped walking, staring down at my feet. “It’s not real, Adrian.”

His brow furrowed as he halted beside me. “What do you mean?”

“It’s just… a business deal,” I whispered, feeling the weight of the truth crash down. “My parents married me off to save their company. Sorin hates me.”

Adrian’s expression darkened, his hands balling into fists. “Drea…”

I wiped at my eyes, fighting back the tears. “I’m okay, Adrian. I am. I’ve learned to deal with it.”

His jaw clenched. “If I’d been here, I would have taken you away. I wouldn’t have let this happen.”

I placed a gentle hand on his arm. “It’s not your fault. You couldn’t have known.”

After a long silence, Adrian offered to walk me home, but I declined. The last thing I needed was Sorin seeing us together and making assumptions.

When I finally reached the house, I tried to unlock the door, but the code wouldn’t work. Sorin had changed it. I knocked several times, but there was no response. Defeated, I sat down on the doorstep, scrolling through old photos of him. His smile in those pictures always made my heart ache.

Suddenly, his voice startled me. “What are you doing out here?”

I jumped, my phone slipping from my grasp. Sorin stood over me, his face unreadable as he bent to pick it up. He glanced at the screen, which displayed a picture of him, and his expression changed—though I couldn’t quite tell how.

Without a word, he handed my phone back. “Why didn’t you just come inside?”

“The door… it wouldn’t open,” I stammered.

Sorin frowned, stepping forward to test the lock. After a moment, he sighed in frustration. “Did you try using your fingerprint?”

I bit my lip, guilt written all over my face.

He sighed. “Unbelievable. Now we’re locked out.” He pulled out his phone, pacing away to make a call for help.

When he returned, he sat down beside me, though he made sure to keep some distance. The silence between us stretched on as we waited for someone to fix the lock, and I couldn’t help but sneak a glance at him.

I wished, just for once, he’d let me in—both literally and figuratively.

I hate my phone right now. Yes, I'm aware that I am using it to type this. Thank you in advance to the Captain Obvious-es out there. I hate how I was sobbing just a few minutes ago bc I'm just tired and overwhelmed right now, then my son texted me and it was funny as hell...so I was laughing my ass off. I felt nothing otherwise, just a brief moment of hilarity...

After I'd finished texting with him, I put my head back down on the table...and it was tears all over.

I hate how the phone pulls me out of my head for a short time, and it's like the emotions (real) shut off and I just feel the emotion I'm ""supposed"" to feel in that moment. It's hard to explain. Whenever I'm done with whatever it was I was doing on the phone, I'm right back up into my head ... Depression just overtakes me again.

I'm not clever enough (nor do I have the energy) to figure out how to stop this from happening bc I can't be on my phone the whole day...as much fun as thst seems to be, im sure i would get tired of it quickly anyhow. I'm too tired mentally and physically to do anything, work on any mental health stuff, nothing. I literally am a vegetable today...and I feel so guilty about that.

I was crying bc I was thinking of how healthy I was just a few years ago. I was robust, heavier than I am now so I had a good body weight (albeit a slightly overweight one) ... I had energy, vitality...I was depressed and a drunk, but I had some happiness in things I was doing. I could at least get around easily. My kids knew the healthy me. I am starting to have this all sinking in just a little bit now. I am sick. I have a disease. I don't want my kids to see me like this, all pale as milk, exhausted and sickly looking all the time, so I put more and more fancy and normal masks on...and each one gets tighter and tighter to wear until I feel like I'm trapped and I can't move or scream...

Sorry for that word salad. 

They see the act I put on. Everyone does, except maybe at my Group Therapy Program. The masks come off there--just a couple of them, though...they (the people at my Group) see more of the pain than anyone besides my bird (my cockatiel Coffee) and my many stuffies. My bird sees it at night when I cry myself to sleep. My stuffies see the panic attacks and anxiety and then medicating and being ok again.

I dunno where I am going with this or what I want. I'm done whining. Back to work for me...putting on that mask again (how ironic that I actually DO have to wear a mask in real life?) and making as if I am fine and dandy. Here I go. Wish me luck!😭",17,1730384920.0,cancer,1,1.0,False

I started indexing from the first video onwards. While the videos were certainly useful, my indexing was actually from the notes under each slide on the book. I indexed anything that looks like a keyword and write a short explanation in the index. My aim was to minimise flipping the books and to have the answer on my index to save time. 

For the indexing I chose to group many of the terms by theme. What this means is that I grouped the different persistence mechanisms as Persistence: Service Creation, Persistence: WMI Subscription and so on. I find this easier for me to quickly flip to the right page in my index.

I went through the lightning labs and the labs. I indexed all commands that were used and provided a short description of what the command does. I also made sure to put a small explanation of any flags that were used for the commands. I did the same for the Power shell and Linux Olympics. 

I did the labs three times at which point I felt comfortable with the commands and what they do.

Practice Exams

My first practice exam was solely used to gauge the strength of my index and to see how much time I needed for the exam. I used solely my index for the practice without referring to any of the books. I scored 89% and completed everything in 1.5 hours with full marks for the Cyberlive. At this point I knew I could afford to slow down and use the time to do book flipping. Cyberlive questions were surprisingly easy and took me anywhere from 20 seconds for the easiest question to maybe two minutes for the more tedious ones. The practice exams will provide an explanation if you get a question wrong so I used the explanation to further strengthen my index.

My second practice exam took me under 2 hours but I only managed to score 93% due to some careless mistakes on my part and what I thought was a poorly phrased question for one of the Cyberlive questions. The questions were for the most part similar to my first exam though there were a few new ones which I then updated in my index.

Afterwards I did not study the SEC504 materials at all till the exam itself because I was confident in my index and I had no issues with time management.

Actual Exam

I made sure to choose a good time after lunch. I had a nice cup of coffee and then went in with my index and all the books for the course including the labs. 

I actually found the actual exam trickier than the two practice exams but this time I took the time to confirm any questions that I had even the slightest doubts on the answers by flipping the books. I skipped three questions as they involved some additional flipping and I wanted to finish my Cyberlive questions before heading back. My Cyberlive VM was not stable at all and restarted at least two times while I was keying commands. It was also very laggy and I had to slow down my keystrokes. That said the Cyberlive questions were fairly straightforward thankfully.

Finished the exam in 2.5 hours and was really honestly surprised by the score. I find the exam to be on the easy side compared to some of the other cyber exams that I have done.

TLDR

Start indexing from the first video. Think like an examiner and think about what kind of questions can be asked from the notes.

Make sure you understand each command and what the flags do. Practice the labs until you are really comfortable with it. 

Make your index work for you and not the other way round. You need to make sure you have at least 1.5 hours for the Cyberlive questions just in case you have weird VM issues. The Cyberlive questions have bigger weightage than your MCQ and is not much harder. ",18,1730384577.0,GIAC,3,1.0,False

1ggfnql,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vermiculture/comments/1ggfnql/tray_of_shredded_cardboard_on_top_of_to_keep/,Tray of shredded cardboard on top of to keep worms warmer? + adding coffee?,"I have a tray tower system. It is placed in the shade behind the shed, kind of sheltered. It is getting cooler here and I have layers of thick bubble wrap that my paper shredder was delivered with lots of (win win) draped over the system. I measured the inside with a soil tester probe and it read 13 degrees celsius. It’s only going to get colder outside now, so as this is the first year I am wondering what is best.

I have more bubble wrap which should help keep any warmth in if needed. I could put it in the shed, but I don’t think that will benefit much with temperature.

There is a finished tray in the middle which I was going to collect when the top feeding tray has filled up, worms still like to hang around in there, maybe it is warmer there for them. I will take a reading, but maybe this should stay in place until winter is over to give some volume to the system.

I was wondering though, if I filled up a spare tray with dry shredded cardboard and placed this on top of the feeding tray would this add some extra insulation.

I also got some coffee from a garden centre cafe, I am going to start adding this, will this add a little more warmth.

tl;dr 

Trying to keep my outdoor worm tray system warm as it gets colder. Currently using bubble wrap and considering adding a layer of dry shredded cardboard on top. Wondering if coffee grounds will also help with warmth.",2,1730384398.0,Vermiculture,0,1.0,False

The caveat here is that we need constant access to the doors at all times due to bringing in logs for the fire. The woodstove needs clearance for safety reasons.

1ggfmbb,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1ggfmbb/almond_croissant_vl/,Almond Croissant VL,"Just tried the Vertuo Almond Croissant. I had high hopes for it, as I really enjoyed the Sunny Almond Vanilla capsules. 

The almond croissant has a way stronger almond taste than the summer edition. The coffee itself had a strong artificial almond smell after brewing it. Tasted fine after adding some milk and sirup. 

Would recommend this if you like strong almond flavor - be careful if you enjoyed the hint of almond that the Sunny Almond Vanilla capsules had. ",1,1730384290.0,nespresso,0,1.0,False
1ggflqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1ggflqy/low_dose_recipe_experimentation/,Low Dose Recipe Experimentation ,"I consistently buy light roasts for the flavor, finish, and the excitement of drinking something unconventional. I also like the fact that I can use boiling water for brewing light roasts and I don't have to faff around with a thermometer or temp monitoring at all. When I use a Metal Mesh V60, I preheat it. Life is good.

 I drink mostly for the taste and experience but caffeine also helps. I am noticing these days that the rate at which I go through bags of coffee has become kind of a problem. My average dose is 11gm with AP or 12gm with Metal Mesh V60. Whenever I have new bags I cup them with old bags to compare, around 3-4 times a month. 

The amount of coffee I end up buying (3-4 250gm bags) is kinda expensive, and I was thinking if I could come up with a recipe for a 9gm dose for AP, or a small 200ml cup recipe for a pourover, I could stretch my bags over the same amount of cups per day, and not feel guilty about brewing an additional cup or two in a day. 

I drink high extraction light roasts any way, so ratios bigger than even 1:17 might work. I have brewed some pourovers with 9gm and found them to be a little watery but with high body coffees it works okay. 

Do you guys have any low dose recipes that I can try?

Sometimes I wonder what there is to celebrate about this day, at least for myself. I wish I could remember being surrounded by loving parents or friends on a day like this. All my past memories are either faded or gone. Enough reminiscing on the past though. To think you remembered my birthday and came all the way here fills me with a joy I haven’t felt in a long time. I don’t need a fancy party or expensive gifts on a day like this, just knowing that you cared enough to remember a day like this is more than enough for me. So, shall I prepare you something to drink? Maybe some tea? Or coffee if you prefer that instead? Huh, what about me? Oh don’t be silly, you know I can’t consume human refreshments.

Comrades, It’s Ambrose’s birthday!
First Genshin bday art! I’m excited to do Runihura’s in December :)
