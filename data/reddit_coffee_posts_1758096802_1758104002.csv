I want to set the record straight: the doll is 100% authentic. Throbbing Instant recently switched factories, and all new batches now have the slightly faded/blurred face style. The body has also been improved a bit with the change. The reason of the change was also straight forward: there was too many quality issues with the previous factory.
I honestly thought this was public knowledge in the BJD community, but it seems many people haven’t seen the update yet. It feels frustrating to be called a scammer for selling something genuine.
Really adding on this, all bjd/mjd blind boxes are just so niche that it is too costly to make fakes. So you don’t really need to worry about getting fakes when buying them.

The date was pretty basic, just got some coffee and talked etc, nothing crazy. I haven’t gone on a date since my last girlfriend broke up with me a few years ago (just wanted to make sure I wasn’t rushing into anything) so I figured I would be a little out of practice but I was so confused on this whole thing while I was talking to her and I wanted to make sure that I am not crazy:

We got to the date, I showed up a lil early, bought her coffee, and we chatted, and she asked what I liked to do for fun, and I told her that I enjoy going to the gym, and hanging out with friends, and playing games and what not, typical guy response. She kinda got icked out by that?  And she asked me why I play video games as a grown man? What? I told her it’s a just a hobby of mine that I enjoy doing. In which she kinda began questioning almost trying to interrogate me on my interests, I tried to sway the conversation to something we both might like to talk about, tried to get her to talk about herself a bit, to no avail, and then when the date ended she said she wanted to date a “man” and not a “boy”?

Keep in mind i’m not a person who just plays video games, i’m in reasonable shape, I have a job, I pay my own bills, live in a decently nice apartment, by no means am I a NEET or a Shut in. In what way do my interests make me less than a man? Is this what dating is like now? If so, this is gonna be a long and winding road.

Now added context i am a total nerd, I do play games, watch anime, play DnD, but not to an extent of where my life solely revolves around those things. I just don’t understand why that having interests and doing things I enjoy is a bad thing?",1,1758103655.0,offmychest,0,0.99,False

We wish to miss as less as possible and to see as much as possible 😀

A lot of questions come up. Therefore I need advice from the well experienced people in this group.
What trails/tracks are easy doable and should we absolutely add to our itinerary. Besides that, is it advisable to book an organised trip to the pinguïns from Punta Arenas or can we go there on our own and book a boat to Isla Magdalena? And what about the Torres del Paine parc (which entrance is best, which trails are doable for all of us) and what about the Perito Moreno glacier? Can we use our car to go there and walk an easy trail or is a tour a better idea?

Of course, I don’t mind if the other two people in our group do a more difficult trail while I can wait with a cup of coffee somewhere or drop them off. Just need to know how to fit it in our schedule the .

The US Government is negotiating with Orion Resource Partners to establish a multibillion-dollar fund for overseas mining projects.

The Trump administration has prioritised access to critical minerals like copper, cobalt and rare earths. [*Bloomberg*](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwiluaroht-PAxWWxTgGHSkaAQEQvOMEKAB6BAgYEAE&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bloomberg.com%2Fnews%2Farticles%2F2025-09-16%2Fus-in-talks-to-set-up-5-billion-fund-for-critical-mineral-deals&usg=AOvVaw1HnOInlM-7dSc0pGVrDRBi&opi=89978449) reports that the collaboration between the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) and Orion stems from concerns about supply, particularly China’s processing dominance and acquisition of overseas mining assets.

The DFC and New York-based Orion are expected to each invest $600m or more in the fund.

Other sovereign investors and US agencies may also participate, reported the [*Financial Times*](https://www.ft.com/content/8d47a239-92e9-43b2-a75f-b2e2df7e7099) (FT), citing sources familiar with the discussions. The fund aims to invest in projects extracting critical minerals that are crucial for various industries.

Center for Strategic and International Studies director of the Critical Minerals Security Programme Gracelin Baskaran was quoted by the *FT* as saying: “These talks really show that the \[Donald\] Trump administration is trying to align its financial tools with its broader mineral ambitions.”

She added that the public-private partnership could catalyse significant capital.

Talks between Orion and the DFC began last year but faced delays due to questions from Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. These concerns have mostly been addressed.

The US plans to invest $600m, with $100m for equity stakes in mining projects and $500m for debt.

The DFC, which is required only to invest outside the US, faces limitations on equity stakes due to its mandate.

The DFC told the *FT* that it “actively pursues investments that are aligned with administration priorities, including diversifying critical mineral supply chains”. A source indicated that the deal is proceeding.

The White House is prioritising securing critical mineral supplies, rapidly expanding investments in mining and supply chains. Under Ben Black’s leadership, pending Senate confirmation, the DFC is expected to collaborate more with the private sector. It has already invested in mining, including $105m for start-up TechMet and $50m in a South African rare earths project. The Orion deal would be its largest.

Orion, led by chief executive Oskar Lewnowski, is a specialist investor in mining and commodities, managing $8bn. It provides equity and debt funding to mining projects through its private capital arm and operates a hedge fund arm specializing in commodities.

*Seeking to counter China’s dominance and secure clean energy minerals, the US readies its biggest mineral venture.*

The United States government is in advanced talks to establish a $5 billion investment vehicle aimed at securing critical minerals, marking Washington’s largest-ever venture into strategic mineral dealmaking.

The proposed fund would be structured as a joint venture between the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) and New York-based investment firm Orion Resource Partners, with each contributing up to $2.5 billion. Funding would scale over time, positioning the initiative as the DFC’s biggest commitment in its history, according to government data.

The partnership mirrors Orion’s $1.2 billion venture with Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund ADQ earlier this year. With around $8 billion in assets under management across mining finance, private equity, and commodity trading, Orion brings substantial expertise to the effort.

At its core, the fund seeks to reduce US dependence on foreign mineral processing, particularly in China, while ensuring long-term supplies of copper, cobalt, rare earth elements and other materials vital for clean energy and defence. Washington aims to build more resilient supply chains as a counterweight to Beijing’s decades-long campaign of securing mineral assets worldwide through state-backed enterprises.

Industry analysts warn that traditional market forces have failed to generate sufficient investment in new mining projects, citing declining ore grades and long permitting timelines in Western markets. Meanwhile, demand for critical materials is accelerating, with copper consumption alone expected to nearly double by 2035.

Officials say the initiative underscores a recognition that mineral security is now a strategic imperative, both for the energy transition and for safeguarding US national security interests.

# SEPT. 16th 2025~The U.S. hopes to break China's grip on rare earth metals, which are crucial in modern technology

[The U.S. hopes to break China's grip on rare earth metals, which are crucial in modern technology | WUNC](https://www.wunc.org/term/news/2025-09-16/rare-earth-metals-us-military)

[Vulcan Elements CEO John Maslin stands on the company's factory floor in Research Triangle Park, N.C. The two year old company has signed more than $10 million in deals with every branch of the military for its rare earth magnets.](https://preview.redd.it/g580z0gw1ppf1.png?width=1760&format=png&auto=webp&s=bbe73a7d5a101c84be8f0d489f50fd7d898b1c2e)

A flurry of public and private sector dealmaking in recent weeks has raised the profile of a family of minerals that are crucial for much of modern technology. And for national security — which is a big reason for all the deals.

Most of the world's supply of processed rare earth elements and the rare earth-enhanced magnets used in powerful electric motors now comes from China. In recent years, China has weaponized its advantage by slapping on trade restrictions.

The U.S. government urgently is trying to develop a homegrown American supply chain so that it’s not reliant on one of its biggest geopolitical rivals.

The 17 metals are found in everything from cell phones, cars, and MRI machines in the civilian world to fighter jets, warships, missiles, tanks, and drones. 

Several of the recent deals have involved a small startup company in Research Triangle Park called Vulcan Elements. It hopes to grow much larger.

""We just announced a $65 million round of Series A,"" said Vulcan CEO John Maslin on a recent day, showing a visitor around the factory floor.

Series A is startup lingo for a significant injection of money from investors. In this case, it's money that will help the company build a full-scale factory. 

Vulcan is two years old and has been producing its rare earth magnets for less than six months. But already it has signed more than $10 million in deals with every branch of the military. In the past few weeks, it's also signed two contracts with mining and processing companies to supply it with the rare earth elements it needs.

Everything it uses — the ingredients, the machinery, the software — is free of any connection with China.

Maslin, a former Navy officer, said he's trying to help build not just a company but an industrial sector that’s crucial for national security, in terms of both the military and U.S. industry as a whole.

A broad array of products use rare earth elements and rare earth magnets. An F-35 fighter has about 900 pounds of them in things like its sophisticated targeting systems and various electric motors. A submarine can use more than 9,000 pounds.

Demand may jump even more with the rise of robots, wind power, electric vehicles, and AI, which all need the elements for various reasons. 

Maslin said the only way to build the necessary supply chain is if government and industry work together.

""And if we do that in partnership with industry and continuing to work with the government, I think that this industry can go and solve the problem in the United States and in the West,"" he said.

Maslin said the company can make only about 10 tons of magnets a year, but hopes to raise its capacity to several hundred tons annually over the next couple of years and several thousand tons by the end of this decade.

Vulcan isn't the only rare earth elements-related company the government is bolstering. 

The Trump Administration has aggressively cut deals to create a U.S.-centric supply chain, including a multibillion arrangement with a California company called MP Materials that runs the nation’s only major rare earth mining and processing operation.

The federal government made waves in the industry — and in U.S. business and political circles — by taking a major ownership stake in the company, which also received tens of millions of dollars from the Biden Administration.

Officials in the office of Assistant Secretary of Defense for Industrial Base Policy, which has spearheaded the Pentagon’s push to build the rare earth supply chain, didn’t respond to a request for an interview or to emailed questions.

But Laura Taylor-Kale, who served in that post during the Biden Administration and is now with the Council on Foreign Relations, said creating a reliable, domestic supply chain has long been a bipartisan priority in Washington.

She said the Biden Administration built on some of the executive orders that the first Trump administration put out about critical minerals, and similarly Trump’s second administration has used tools created under Biden.

""I think we've been on a continuum over the last eight years or so and really sharpening the toolkit that we have within the U.S. government to address strategic and critical materials,"" she said.

She said the Biden Administration created the first ever national defense industrial strategy and implementation plan, and it did crucial work with Congress to boost funding for critical minerals.

Other experts agree that the focus on rare earths has been bipartisan.

Gracelyn Baskaran is director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at Center for Strategic and International Studies.

She was interviewed from California, where she was visiting MP Materials to get a first hand look at the progress the company — and the nation — is making toward building a crucial part of the supply chain.

""If you come look at this mine, it's an incredible operation,"" she said.

She credited the Biden Administration for helping build out the infrastructure of the facility, as well as the Trump Administration for significantly accelerating the development of the industry.

""It has really been a team effort from both sides to get to where we are,"" Baskaran said.

One challenge for the supply chain effort is that some types of rare earth elements can’t be commercially mined domestically. So the U.S. has begun working with allies such as Australia, Brazil, and Saudi Arabia to source some of them elsewhere.

""It's about 'where is the geology,'"" Baskaran said. ""Critical minerals are quite a unique industry in that you can only work along the lines of the geology that God gave you.""

**Rare earths aren't actually rare, she said.**

# SEPT. 16th, 2025~America needs a rare earth industrial policy to end reliance on China

[America needs a rare earth industrial policy to end reliance on China](https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/5503873-trump-administration-rare-earth-strategy/)

[Samples of rare-earth minerals from Baiyun’ebo or Bayan Obo mining district are on display at the Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences \(IGGCAS\) on May 17, 2025 in Beijing, China. \(Photo by VCG\/VCG via Getty Images\)](https://preview.redd.it/zpqwv1ym2ppf1.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4eb303ee7a376794ab5647e3fe4183d5bd1aa2c)

This summer, President [Donald Trump ](https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump/)announced crippling tariffs on imports from the People’s Republic of China, a laudable effort to end the Chinese Communist Party’s exploitation of America’s market economy. 

Beijing, however, levied a painful retaliation, [restricting](https://www.wsj.com/world/asia/china-western-defense-industry-critical-minerals-3971ec51) the flow of rare earth minerals to U.S. defense companies.

China controls [85 percent](https://www.forbes.com/sites/miltonezrati/2023/12/11/how-much-control-does-china-have-over-rare-earth-elements/) of rare earth processing, and an estimated [78 percent](https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2025/04/chinas-rare-earth-mineral-squeeze-will-hit-pentagon-hard/404776/) of Department of Defense weapons systems depend on critical minerals, meaning defense contractors are scrambling to acquire minerals used in everything from infrared sensors in missiles to rare earth metals in drones while emergency stockpiles dwindle.

Resurrecting domestic rare earth mining and refining is a national security imperative that requires robust federal action now before our defense systems are further compromised.

Looking ahead for solutions, however, will require policymakers to examine the past. For the second half of the 20th century, America was the only major global supplier of rare earth minerals.

The story of how we lost that dominance can help us act wisely today.

The Mountain Pass mine in California was a global powerhouse until it shut down in 2002, unable to remain financially solvent in the face of stringent environmental regulations in the U.S.

At that time, China stepped in and began to accumulate a larger and larger share of the rare earth market. 

Ironically, for the sake of environmental protection, the U.S. sacrificed its domestic rare earth production capacity to the [worst polluter in the world](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2022/11/23/china-climate-finance-cop27/).

Private investors and the Pentagon attempted to bring Mountain Pass back online in later years through a business called Molycorp, but the new owners were unable to stay above water. By 2015, Molycorp [went bankrupt](https://cases.ra.kroll.com/molycorp/).

Today, America is reaping the fruits of this failure as U.S. security is dependent on the good graces of the Chinese Communist Party.

To end this vulnerability, policymakers must rapidly develop an entire domestic rare earth ecosystem, including everything from extracting raw material to bringing final products to market.

The Trump administration took a heartening first step a few months ago by inking a [multi-billion-dollar deal](https://www.reuters.com/business/mp-materials-partners-with-department-defense-boost-us-rare-earth-magnet-supply-2025-07-10/) with MP Materials, which now operates Mountain Pass. 

But unlike the previous attempt to revive America’s only rare earth mine, this time the Department of Defense is guaranteeing a minimum price floor and has agreed to a [10-year purchasing agreement](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/10/pentagon-to-become-largest-shareholder-in-rare-earth-magnet-maker-mp-materials.html) to protect this vital project from Chinese price manipulation. 

China doesn’t play by market rules, and we cannot afford to let American producers lose in an unfair global fight.

Likewise, it was later [reported](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/land-use-biodiversity/trump-administration-expand-price-support-us-rare-earths-projects-sources-say-2025-07-31/) that the Trump administration is working to expand the price floors to other U.S. rare earth companies.

These moves are a great start, but they will mean nothing without similarly rebuilding America’s rare earth refining capabilities. Like mining, U.S. rare earth refining was also undercut by low-cost Chinese operations. 

Increasing domestic refining is a part of the White House’s [rare earth strategy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/immediate-measures-to-increase-american-mineral-production/), and the administration has reportedly explored novel approaches like [conducting refining on military bases](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-seeks-minerals-refining-pentagon-bases-boost-us-output-sources-say-2025-03-10/) to boost production. 

But just like with the MP Materials agreement, a domestic rare earth ecosystem requires certainty, which means government support to keep facilities online no matter what tricks China tries to pull.

Efforts to strengthen U.S. mining and refining will also benefit from a bipartisan Biden-era [policy](https://rareearthexchanges.com/news/rare-earths-and-the-u-s-defense-supply-chain-from-bidens-ban-to-trumps-trade-gambit/) that requires removing Chinese rare earths from U.S. weapons systems by 2027. 

The Pentagon is far from the only purchaser of rare earth minerals but guaranteeing that non-Chinese producers have a monumental consumer will buttress an alternative ecosystem.

The final puzzle piece is bolstering U.S. manufacturing of final products that rely on critical minerals, especially clean energy technology. Solar, electric vehicles, batteries and other clean tech markets are growing exponentially. 

It would be a pyrrhic victory if U.S. rare earth miners and refiners helped our defense industry on the one hand while being driven by an unfair market to enrich Chinese manufacturers on the other, because we don’t have an adequate U.S. manufacturing base. 

Right now, China controls more than [80 percent](https://e360.yale.edu/features/china-renewable-energy) of the world’s solar manufacturing capacity and accounts for [more than ](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualizing-chinese-ev-market-share-overseas/)[70 percent](https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iea.org%2Freports%2Fglobal-ev-outlook-2025%2Ftrends-in-the-electric-car-industry-3&data=05%7C02%7CDTodd%40thehill.com%7Ce956359f89544bad29e408ddf491499b%7C9e5488e2e83844f6886cc7608242767e%7C1%7C0%7C638935627030327136%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=RTBKvoB34G1rpnLxLGqUZRun1vi4d%2BUbDK9lWs%2FrNrs%3D&reserved=0) of global electric vehicle sales. 

Beijing has a vertically integrated near monopoly from raw resource extraction to the final consumer product — made possible in large party by [slave](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ilab/shining-light-exploitation-solar-supply-chain) [labor](https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/media/press-releases/moolenaar-rubio-lawmakers-uncover-shocking-new-evidence-slave-labor-links) in China, particularly in Xinjiang where China is carrying out a genocide against Uyghurs.

China’s dominance in clean energy technology is not only morally offensive but deeply ironic. China portrays itself as an environmental champion by producing clean tech even while building [more coal power plants](https://www.npr.org/2023/03/02/1160441919/china-is-building-six-times-more-new-coal-plants-than-other-countries-report-fin) than the rest of the world combined. 

***The leading countries in clean energy technology should actually respect the environment. For these reasons, America needs domestic producers of clean tech that will purchase critical minerals from U.S. refiners.*** 

***U.S. national security demands nothing less. In the face of Chinese rare earth export restrictions, restoring Mountain Pass is a good start, but not enough. Washington must build a comprehensive domestic marketplace of miners, refiners, and manufacturers that can break China’s monopoly and keep America safe.***

# RECAP of ""The real signals & Bombshell"" that came out of Mark’s Wainwright talk:

[MUST WATCH EVENT @@!! IF YOU HAVE NOT DONE SO..](https://preview.redd.it/2sswraec5ppf1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a150c65f5cc6ecec10244e7981f0c4963b278ec)

# 🛑 1. Titanium

* **Confirmed:** talks with *three* U.S. majors. That’s the supply chain gap (aerospace, defense coatings, alloys).
* **Read-through:** Niocorp is positioning itself as a domestic TiCl₄/TiO₂ anchor, and that’s squarely in the **DoD/DOE wheelhouse**. A major U.S. titanium producer (think **TIMET/ATI** or even **Chemours** for TiCl₄) could lock in here.

# 🛑 2. Rare Earths / Stellantis

* **Stellantis drama** → slowed by management reshuffles, but “back on track.”
* **Read-through:** Stellantis is *still live*. They want *all* REEs. If the DFS proves scale and recovery, Stellantis could come in with a **multi-metal anchor offtake.**

# 🛑 3. Scandium Metal Demonstration

* DoD involved → using two different methods to produce scandium metal.
* NanoScale-like tech strongly suggests collaboration with Ames Lab / Nanoscale Powders type pathways.
* First Metal Nov 2025. That’s basically a demo milestone that could trigger direct DoD procurement & validation.

[Gen VI Fighters & Drones will fly on ScAl alloys now in development with DoD Defense Prime!](https://reddit.com/link/1nj8zga/video/f4w209yk5ppf1/player)

# 🚨 Game-changer alert for Niocorp 🚨 ~BELOW~

# 🛑 4. ScAl Alloy + Gen VI Fighters (**🔥 HUGE)

* Direct quote: Working with a DoD prime contractor on Sc-Al alloy integration.
* Gen VI fighter → 360° view, doubled threat detection, range boost.
* This is an operational security tell — ScAl alloys are already in classified development pathways for NGAD (Next Gen Air Dominance).

# ****Mark teased a partnership soon. That’s your strategic bombshell!!!!

# NioCorp: The Strategic Basket

NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project isn’t just another mine — it’s a **national industrial base reset button**. With the U.S. defense and aerospace sector exposed to foreign choke points, Elk Creek’s mix of critical minerals lines up squarely with Pentagon and DOE priorities.

# 🔑 The Mineral Arsenal

* **Niobium (Nb)** – The *quiet giant*. From jet engines to superconductors, SMRs, and quantum systems, niobium is the alloy enabler. Elk Creek could supply a good portion — potentially all — of U.S. needs, ending dependence on Brazil.
* **Titanium (Ti & TiCl₄)** – Backbone of airframes, missiles, and armor plating. TiCl₄ doubles as a coatings precursor and is integral to stealth systems and chemical defense. A secure U.S. feedstock is essential.
* **Scandium (Sc & Sc-Al alloys)** – *The game-changer. Sc-Al alloys cut aircraft weight, extend combat radius, and enable Gen VI fighter designs. First scandium metal is targeted for November, with a DoD prime already working alongside NioCorp.*
* **Rare Earths (Nd/Pr, Dy, Tb)** – The permanent magnet core for F-35s, drones, EVs, and Navy ships. *Without them, electrification and defense propulsion grind to a halt. Elk Creek adds a U.S. stream for the most critical magnet REEs.*

# ⚡ Why It Matters Now

* **Defense Assurance** → Elk Creek minerals map directly to DFARS compliance, reducing single-source risk from China (REEs), Brazil (Nb), and Russia/Ukraine (Ti).
* **Industrial Transition** → Aerospace, EVs, quantum, and clean energy all converge on the same supply gaps. Elk Creek is positioned as a multi-sector keystone.
* **Near-Term Catalysts** → 2025 drilling added **9 infill boreholes (+64% more core)** plus 6 step-outs. Assays in mid-to-late October could confirm a resource uplift across all minerals, raising production profiles before the Q4 Definitive Feasibility Study.

# [NioCorp\_Presentation.pdf](https://www.niocorp.com/wp-content/uploads/NioCorp_Presentation.pdf)

[Niocorp is Engaged & Rolling....on EXIM!!!!](https://reddit.com/link/1nj8zga/video/wnt2t5ov6ppf1/player)

**IMHO \~ Following Monday (Sept. 8th) Wainwright presentation, NioCorp has entered its most critical phase yet.** Mark Smith confirmed Phase 1 drilling is complete with assays due mid-to-late October, paving the way for a resource update and a Q4 Definitive Feasibility Study that could reset the scale across scandium, niobium, titanium, and rare e**arths. Titanium negotiations with three U.S. majors are advancing, Stellantis remains engaged on REEs, and two scandium metal demonstration paths with DoD are moving forward — with first scandium metal targeted by November. Most significant: confirmation that a DoD prime is working directly with NioCorp on Sc-Al alloys for Gen VI fighters, marking Elk Creek as a true defense cornerstone.**

Strategically, the project now carries momentum few peers can match. Backing includes a $10M DoD Title III award, ongoing EXIM Bank financing engagement, and recognition across the CHIPS Act, DOE’s $1B critical minerals program, and DPA mandates. **On Tuesday, Mark Smith underscored how Elk Creek’s niobium could help free the U.S. from reliance on Brazil, where supply represents a “Sword of Damocles” over American industry. Pending drill results, NioCorp may be in a position to supply a substantial portion — if not all — of U.S. niobium needs, while scandium cements Elk Creek as the “Saudi Arabia” of next-gen alloys.**

**\*\*\*Now layered on top: the Sept. 15–16 policy backdrop. Washington is moving fast with a new $5B U.S.** critical minerals fund, Trump Admin support for price floors and national security framing, and clear precedent in MP Materials’ Pentagon-backed magnet contracts. **This is exactly the lane where NioCorp fits: Scandium has no commercial market until DoD makes one; Niobium and Titanium are already stable and strategic, and together they sweeten the package for U.S. defense and aerospace.\*\*\*\***

**Looking ahead, the RedChip presentation — now rescheduled to Sept. 24th at 4:15 PM EST** — is raising eyebrows. Why the delay? In context, it suggests management wants maximum visibility to align with key catalysts: ***DoD price-support news, a defense prime partnership, or even a land/utility buildout announcement.*** With offtakes and defense ties already in motion, Elk Creek is no longer “just a mine-in-the-making” — it is fast becoming the flagship U.S. critical minerals project, uniquely positioned to deliver Sc, Nb, Ti, and REEs at scale. By 2028, NioCorp could redefine America’s resource independence.

# — and it’s clear: NioCorp isn’t just about magnets. It’s part of the U.S. Critical Minerals Solution!

# — A game-changer for American Resource Independence by 2028 and beyond.

These aren't just ideas; they are market gaps with a built-in audience, begging for someone to build a solution. Here are 20 untapped startup ideas you can build in 2025.



# Software & SaaS Goldmines



**1. The Digital Legacy Manager**

* **The Reddit Problem:** ""My dad passed away, and we're locked out of all his accounts. It's a logistical nightmare on top of our grief.""
* **The Startup Idea:** A secure digital vault (SaaS) where users can store passwords, important documents, and final wishes. Upon their passing, a designated, verified person is granted access. It’s end-of-life planning for the digital age.

**2. The ""Body Double"" Focus App**

* **The Reddit Problem:** (From `r/ADHD`) ""I can't focus on my work unless someone else is in the room, even if they're also just working silently.""
* **The Startup Idea:** An app that facilitates ""body doubling"" by connecting users for timed, silent, virtual co-working sessions. It’s accountability and focus without the pressure of collaboration.

**3. The Subscription ""Kill Switch""**

* **The Reddit Problem:** ""I just checked my bank statement and I'm paying for three streaming services I forgot I even had.""
* **The Startup Idea:** A service that securely links to your bank accounts, automatically detects recurring subscriptions, and allows you to ""kill"" any of them with a single click.

**4. The ""What's in My Fridge?"" Recipe AI**

* **The Reddit Problem:** ""I have chicken, half a lemon, and some sad-looking spinach. What on earth can I make besides another boring salad?""
* **The Startup Idea:** A *genuinely good* AI-powered recipe app. Users take a photo of the ingredients they have, and the AI generates creative, high-quality recipes, not just a list of things that contain those items.

**5. The Local Government ""Translator""**

* **The Reddit Problem:** ""My city council just passed a new zoning law that affects my neighborhood, and I only found out after the fact by reading a 300-page PDF.""
* **The Startup Idea:** A hyperlocal newsletter service that scrapes dull, dense public records and translates them into a plain-English email digest for your specific zip code.



# Niche E-commerce & Products



**6. Durable, Repairable ""Buy It For Life"" Gadgets**

* **The Reddit Problem:** (From `r/buyitforlife`) ""My new smart toaster with a touchscreen died in 13 months. My grandma's simple metal toaster from 1970 still works.""
* **The Startup Idea:** A brand of simple, elegant, over-engineered home appliances (blenders, coffee makers, toasters) with mechanical parts, standard screws, and available repair guides.

**7. High-Quality Sensory & Focus Tools for Adults**

* **The Reddit Problem:** ""All the 'fidget' tools are cheap plastic toys for kids. I need something professional I can have on my desk at work without looking like a child.""
* **The Startup Idea:** An e-commerce store selling beautifully designed, high-quality focus aids for adults. Think machined metal sliders, elegant kinetic sand desk toys, and silent, satisfying fidget tools.

**8. Modular Furniture for Renters**

* **The Reddit Problem:** ""My couch doesn't fit in my new apartment. Again.""
* **The Startup Idea:** A furniture brand focused on high-quality, modular pieces (sofas, shelving, desks) that can be easily reconfigured, expanded, or shrunk to fit different spaces as people move.

**9. The Hyper-Niche Hobbyist Box**

* **The Reddit Problem:** ""I'm obsessed with my \[niche hobby\], but finding high-quality, unique supplies is a constant, time-consuming hunt.""
* **The Startup Idea:** A subscription box for *serious* hobbyists. Not generic snacks, but curated, high-end materials for niches like fountain pen collecting, advanced 3D printing, watchmaking, or bonsai cultivation.

**10. The ""Ugly Produce"" Local Marketplace**

* **The Reddit Problem:** ""It's insane how much perfectly good food farms have to throw away just because it's misshapen.""
* **The Startup Idea:** A platform that directly connects local farms' ""ugly"" or surplus produce with consumers in the area for a significant discount. It’s a win for farmers, consumers, and the planet.



# Hyper-Local & Service Businesses



**11. The ""Third Place"" for Adults (No Booze Required)**

* **The Reddit Problem:** ""I want to go out and meet people, but I'm tired of bars. Where can adults just... exist?""
* **The Startup Idea:** A physical space focused on community and hobbies. Think a board game cafe, a maker space, a quiet reading lounge with a tea bar, or a hobby shop with ample seating.

**12. A Trusted Tech & Task Service for Seniors**

* **The Reddit Problem:** ""My parents keep getting scammed by tech support pop-ups, and I live three states away.""
* **The Startup Idea:** A vetted, subscription-based service for seniors that provides on-call tech help, small home repairs, and assistance with errands. It’s peace of mind for their adult children.

**13. The Indoor Plant Care Service**

* **The Reddit Problem:** ""I've killed my fifth fiddle-leaf fig. I love having plants, but I'm a terrible plant parent.""
* **The Startup Idea:** A ""gardener for your houseplants."" A service that makes scheduled visits to homes and offices to water, prune, repot, and care for indoor plants.

**14. The ""Secondhand Style"" Personal Shopper**

* **The Reddit Problem:** ""I want to build a stylish wardrobe from thrift stores, but I don't have the time or patience to sift through racks of junk.""
* **The Startup Idea:** A personal styling service that specializes in sourcing high-quality, secondhand clothing from thrift and consignment shops based on a client's style profile.

**15. A Local ""De-Influencing"" Product Testing Service**

* **The Reddit Problem:** ""I'm so tired of sponsored reviews. I just want to know if the viral vacuum cleaner *actually* works.""
* **The Startup Idea:** A local, subscription-based newsletter or service that independently buys and rigorously tests trending products, providing brutally honest, unbiased reviews for its community.



# Creator & Community Platforms



**16. A ""Goodreads for Podcasts""**

* **The Reddit Problem:** ""Podcast discovery is broken. I've listened to all the big ones and can't find anything new I like.""
* **The Startup Idea:** A dedicated platform for discovering, rating, and reviewing podcasts. The key would be a powerful recommendation algorithm based on user taste, not just what's on the top of the charts.

**17. The Creator ""Business in a Box""**

* **The Reddit Problem:** ""I'm a great writer/video editor, but I have no idea how to handle sponsorships, taxes, or merchandise.""
* **The Startup Idea:** An all-in-one platform for creators that handles the boring but crucial business-side tasks: contract templates, invoicing, tax estimation, and connections to vetted merch suppliers.

**18. A Marketplace for ""Micro-Internships""**

* **The Reddit Problem:** ""I need real-world experience for my resume, but I can't commit to a full-time, unpaid summer internship.""
* **The Startup Idea:** A platform connecting students and career-changers with companies for short-term, paid, remote projects. Think 1-2 week ""micro-internships"" focused on a single, specific task.

**19. The ""Unbiased News"" Aggregator**

* **The Reddit Problem:** ""Every news source feels biased. I have to read five different sites just to get a semblance of the real story.""
* **The Startup Idea:** A news platform that uses AI to aggregate reports on the same story from multiple sources (left, center, and right), highlighting the common facts and clearly labeling the differences in spin and opinion.

**20. A Platform for Paid, High-Quality Beta Testing**

* **The Reddit Problem:** ""I love testing new apps, but most 'beta testing' programs are unpaid and don't provide real feedback channels.""
* **The Startup Idea:** A platform connecting software companies with vetted, skilled beta testers who are paid for their time to provide detailed, structured feedback and bug reports. It's quality assurance as a service.

The ideas are there. The market is practically shouting for them. It's time to build.",1,1758102820.0,u_Playful_Rub3656,0,1.0,False
1nj8tje,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyShine/comments/1nj8tje/explore_if_la_girl_lip_plumper_glp529_lives_up_to/,Explore if L.A. Girl Lip Plumper GLP529 Lives Up to the Hype,"The first time I heard about the L.A. Girl GLP529 Tinted Lip Plumper, I was intrigued by its promises. Its description boasted a moisturizing formula enriched with aloe, shea butter, and vitamin E, all packed into a sleek and holographic component. Naturally, as someone who uses lip products daily, I felt compelled to test it out myself. What stood out immediately was its lightweight feel. It barely felt like I was wearing anything, which made it a refreshing change from other lipsticks that often feel cakey or heavy.

**Design and Packaging**  
The holographic packaging is what first caught my eye. It has a chic and playful vibe, which adds a touch of fun to your makeup routine. This is not a product you would shy away from pulling out in public; it’s that aesthetically pleasing. The slant top design wasn’t just for looks—it’s practical. It allows for controlled and precise application, reducing the chances of smearing or uneven coverage. Even during quick touch-ups, the lipstick didn’t feel awkward in hand or on lips. It’s clear to me that thought went into balancing form and function.  

**Moisturizing and Comfort Levels**  
With a formula boasting aloe, shea butter, and vitamin E, I anticipated solid hydration—and it delivered. Even after hours of wear, my lips didn’t feel parched or cracked, which happens with some products I’ve used previously. Unlike certain tinted plumpers that feel sticky, this one sits lightly on the lips. My friend noticed it too; borrowing it during an outing, she commented on how smooth it went on, which showcases its universal performance.  

**Good Aspects**  
- Lightweight and non-sticky formula  
- Hydrating ingredients that genuinely work  
- Practical and stylish slant-top design  
- Smooth, effortless application for all lip shapes  

[Check L.A. Girl GLP529 price on Amazon.](https://paulahansen.com/p/b0dhfjbjy6/)

**Performance and Longevity**  
The pigmentation ensured bold color in a single swipe, and I was impressed by how long it lasted. Cups of coffee, multiple conversations, and even a light snack didn’t wear it down completely. Of course, like nearly all lip products, it faded a bit with heavier meals. A quick swipe was enough to refresh the look. Overall, for a product emphasized as moisturizing and lightweight, it exceeded expectations in staying power.  

**Versatile Finishes for Every Occasion**  
Choices matter a lot to me, and with this lipstick, variety isn’t lacking. The availability of both matte and glossy finishes made it fun to tailor my look. On a casual day, I opted for a simple gloss finish to keep it natural, while for a dinner date, the matte finish added a touch of elegance and drama. It’s nice to see products catering to different moods and events without requiring an entirely separate purchase.  

**Limitations**  
- Slight fading during heavy meals  
- May not suit those looking for ultra-matte, no-transfer formulas  

**Shortcomings**  
- Slightly limited shade range for darker complexions  
- Hydration may wane faster in colder conditions  

**Competing Products**  
Compared to other brands, particularly those at a similar price point, this tinted lip plumper holds its ground quite well. A peer product like Maybelline’s Superstay Matte Ink might have unmatched longevity, but it lacks the hydrating benefits present here. Meanwhile, NYX Butter Gloss offers great hydration but falls short in color payoff and versatility. For anyone prioritizing moisture without compromising on pigmentation and lightweight comfort, this outshines them both.  

**Financial Value**  
Even without mentioning exact prices, I’d say this offers excellent financial value. It combines the benefits of a lip balm, the gloss of a plumper, and the pigmentation of a lipstick into a single product. From my perspective, this multi-functionality more than justifies its cost. It feels like a smart purchase, especially for those who want dependable daily use with adaptability for special occasions.

1nj8rhn,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1nj8rhn/i_31f_dont_know_if_im_seriously_incompatible_with/,I (31F) don't know if I'm seriously incompatible with my partner (33M) or if I am being abused,"My partner and I have been together for three years. He is autistic (not formally diagnosed) and as the relationship has progressed we've had a lot of issues which we've talked about but never seem to be able to resolve.

First are his anger and mood issues. By his own admission he will randomly be triggered by something small that annoys him - a bad driver on the road, a song he doesn't like, a comment I might make, or nothing at all - and it will plunge him into a terrible mood for hours or days. When he has had these bad moods in the past he has had violent outbursts like punching walls and furniture, or snapping (verbally) at me. Our washing machine control panel is broken because he punched it in anger when it was beeping because the wiring is faulty (but he refuses to replace it because it's an unnecessary expense). Occasionally he gets angry when playing video games and punches the coffee table and then goes into a foul mood. Following these outbursts he refuses to speak or gives me one word answers until he's managed to calm down which can take a long time. When he does this it scares me and I've sometimes left the house to get away from his bad moods, which he says just infuriates him even more - from his point of view I just have to let him be angry and act completely normal. He's accepted that the outbursts aren't OK and they occur much less often now, but he still randomly stonewalls me and it makes me feel awful. I've lost count of the number of times I've been looking forward to Christmas, a holiday, or just a weekend and he has randomly gone into one of his moods and the entire event has been spoiled. I don't feel like this stems from actual anger directed at me but from his inability to regulate his emotions and his refusal to see a therapist to deal with them.

I'm very isolated where we live as I moved across country to live with him where neither of us have a support network or friends. He has increasingly struggled with leaving the house and making plans to do stuff together other than playing video games in our free time. He does not like going on dates or doing social things and usually turns down invitations to do things with me and my friends and family when I travel back home. He is very resistant against the idea of moving closer to where we have family and friends because he sees his job as the most important thing in his life and would need to look for a different one if we moved.

Since I moved in with him (about 6 months into the relationship) he has also been controlling - not with things like visiting my family or friends or jealous behaviour, but with things like what we eat for dinner, groceries we can buy, when I am allowed to put the heating on and how long for, when I can do laundry, not being permitted to use the tumble drier or dishwasher, etc. I contribute to half of all our bills and half of his mortgage but he is extremely anxious about spending money on 'unnecessary' things to the point that it makes my life miserable. I have repeatedly asked to be added to his mortgage since I've been paying into it for two years but he has been really resistant to do so because of his anxieties around money. Like his anger issues, I don't feel like these behaviours stem from a need to control me specifically but his rigid view of the way his daily life must be organised, his food aversion issues, and his sense of comfort with strict routine. However, he doesn't see how unreasonable it is to expect another person to have to follow that routine too. He has admitted he thinks he suffers with agoraphobia and OCD as well as clinical depression but has repeatedly said that it is 'just the person he is' and I have to accept him and 'cut him some slack.'

He briefly went to a free counselling service for a handful of sessions but wrote off therapy entirely when he decided he didn't 'respect' the counsellor enough for therapy to work. He has now, after me threatening to leave, started on antidepressant medication but the early side effects have only made things worse.

I feel like I'm at the end of my tether and I don't know what to do now. I love him and he is great with many other things in the relationship like household management, being responsible and organised, reliability etc. It doesn't help matters that I was in a (much more obviously) abusive relationship for most of my twenties with someone who ultimately had an affair, so my partner's behaviour seems much less serious compared to that. I want to support my partner with the things he struggles with but I feel like he has dragged his feet for far too long knowing how much these issues were affecting me and not doing anything about them. When I finally heard him admit to the GP, during a phone appointment, that he'd had angry outbursts where he'd punched walls etc it finally hit home to me that I'd been spending a significant part of this relationship feeling scared, confused, and unhappy, and that despite his mental health difficulties/autism, it might be time to prioritise my own sanity.",1,1758102599.0,abusiverelationships,4,1.0,False
1nj8ra8,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoberCurious/comments/1nj8ra8/substance_counter_culture_what_do_we_call/,substance counter culture - what do we call ourselves?,"the word “sober” seems to have a lot of stigma  attached to it.

and scc is more than just alcohol. it also includes the trend towards curbing caffeine/sugar intake through beverages (coffee energy drinks and soda), not smoking/vaping, and getting nutrition through food rather than multi vitamins. 

i’m curious if there’s a more generalized label we can use to encompasses the shift in market trends towards more substance free lifestyles. ie the rise of people who want to do shit for fun with friends and be healthy without paying big alc big pharma or big bev.

this would include people who are substance free by choice but not necessarily with a background in addiction or people who aren’t interested in building a community through recovery. something with a little more anonymity and deemphasis on the without substances part. 

just a lifestyle choice and preference.

The way I get around ADHD is by paying to be somewhere. Sometimes I buy a 5 pack for a local coworking space (15/day) or I go to a cafe and drink a very fancy coffee (I've been trying to choose espresso instead, for 3-3.50 or so). this is really the only thing that works for me. I simply can't work from home. Even when my partner is around (body doubling), I just get up and start doing other stuff. I'm currently only taking 5mg of medikanet (ritalin)  and been trying to cycle up, but at 10 mg i feel pretty psycho and with the coffee habit, my head feels numb and I feel a little crazy. Does anyone have any hacks for this? Unfortunately, I'm very broke and I can't afford this daily coffee habit anymore. I added it up and it's been destroying my finances.   
  
Even for tasks I like to do - right now i'm designing a book which normally I would love - while I'm at home, I have to eat chocolate and things like that to keep myself entertained to keep working.

1nj8pt0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpotlessSecrets/comments/1nj8pt0/investigate_if_green_manatee_laundry_detergent/,Investigate if Green Manatee laundry detergent strips really work,"The Green Manatee B087CDX5VS laundry detergent caught my eye because of its eco-friendly promise and compact form factor, which seemed perfect for my small apartment and frequent travels. Being an ultra-concentrated laundry detergent strip, it immediately intrigued me as a sustainable alternative to bulky liquid detergents or heavily packaged powders. Testing this product over the past month has been an enlightening experience, particularly for someone keen on reducing plastic waste without compromising cleaning capabilities. While the product delivered on many of its claims, a few aspects deserve closer scrutiny.

**Eco-Friendly Design**  
One of the most appealing features is its environmentally conscious design. The packaging is entirely plastic-free, made of 100% recyclable cardboard, which complements its biodegradable laundry strips. I appreciated how Green Manatee cut down on waste not only in the detergent itself but also in the shipping process, given the thin, lightweight form factor. These traits make it an excellent choice for anyone wanting to reduce their carbon footprint while keeping laundry day manageable.

**Performance**  
As skeptical as I was about how well a small strip could clean a full load of laundry, this little product exceeded expectations. Powered by coconut soap, it managed to remove tough dirt, odors, and even minor stains with ease. To test its mettle, I washed post-gym clothes and a coffee-stained white shirt, and both came out fresh and spotless. Using it with warm and cold water yielded equally stellar results, which is a big plus for clothing requiring different wash temperatures. However, don’t expect it to handle deeply ingrained stains like a specialized stain remover might—it’s effective, but there are limits.

[Check Green Manatee B087CDX5VS price on Amazon.](https://blog.senaar.com/p/b087cdx5vs/)

**Convenience for Travel**  
This product is clearly designed with travelers in mind. Its concentrated strips are lightweight and compact, making them easy to stash in a toiletry bag or backpack when heading to a vacation or work trip. On one occasion, I took it along for a weekend getaway and used it for handwashing items in a hotel sink. Not only was it effective, but there was no hassle of liquid spillage or digging through hotel-provided alternatives. I could see frequent travelers and campers finding this feature invaluable.

**Positives**  
The list of advantages for this laundry detergent is long.  
- Plastic-free, biodegradable formulation helps reduce environmental impact.  
- Compact and lightweight design is highly convenient for travel or storage.  
- Versatile performance for both machine and handwashing fabrics.  
- Free from harmful chemicals like parabens, phthalates, and dyes, ensuring safe use for sensitive skin.  

**Areas of Concern**  
No product is perfect, and the Green Manatee laundry strips have a few drawbacks.  
- The minimal packaging, while eco-friendly, doesn’t include resealable options, leaving the strips exposed unless sealed separately.  
- Heavily stained or high-volume loads might require additional strips, which could diminish the product’s value over time.  
- Fragrance-free may not satisfy users who prefer laundry with a lingering fresh scent.  

**Other Options**  
When considering alternatives, the Tru Earth Eco-Strips and ECOS Hypoallergenic Free & Clear Laundry Detergent often come up as competitors. Tru Earth’s strips match the compact and biodegradable features but have limited availability in some regions, making it harder to stock up regularly. On the other hand, ECOS provides a liquid option that’s plant-based and offers additional scent varieties. However, liquids can’t rival the space efficiency of Green Manatee’s packaging, especially for on-the-go users.  

**True Value**  
The value of this product lies in its thoughtful combination of eco-consciousness and practical usability. Although it might be slightly pricier than traditional detergents on a per-load basis, the reduced environmental impact and convenience more than justify the cost for anyone prioritizing sustainability. The lack of waste alone feels worth the expense, especially in an age where reducing plastic consumption is paramount.

Drink min of 2 litres of water a day, read, exercise regularly, nutritional balanced diet, take my vitamins. I can't say I have issues actually sleeping but my natural energy and rhythms indicate being a night owl but I seem to actively fight going to sleep too. Consciously / unconsciously if that makes sense. It's not like I am like ""I refuse to go to bed"" but my body won't comply and gets bursts of energy in response to me wanting to put myself to bed and go to bed on time. I haven't tried supplements and haven't gone to the GP yet. Just after some insight and advice because it's ruining me! ",1,1758102101.0,ADHDUK,0,1.0,False

1nj8jp2,https://i.redd.it/4j9ra1y93ppf1.jpeg,GTA SA True 100%+ on PS2 Project.,"At 4:54pm today I decided to set up my PS2 and watched “The Introduction” for GTA SA before starting my game. For this particular play through I’ll be doing whats known as either a Starter Save or Master Save. This is Version One as in the “Hot Coffee” version and the only unfortunate thing is I cannot obtain the San Fierro Tattoo’s sadly without cheats which is strictly forbidden.. On the plus side playing through this version allows me to expand Gang Territories using a glitch by simply flying out of the map for hours, which will be done after the 100% journey is complete and that can be apart of the + for the project.

Since starting I’ve Maxed out Cycling Skill and stored the very BMX you start a New Game, mine has always been red so I guess that’s the cannon bike colour unless you start another save game. It only appears red if you don’t have existing save data and it boots into a Game or you get lucky by constantly starting a New Game until one appears.

I’ve collected weapons around the map and looking to max all their skills out and ammunition count to 9999-xx

What is a Starter / Master Save?

Pretty much accomplish the max percentage before starting the first story mission. This consists of tasks that contribute to 100% or not, the max percentage possible on PS2 In the beginning is 13.90% and (15.51% for Mobile, PS3, X360 and possibly DE)


Anything I should do right away? Do keep in mind even if its trivial things like “Don’t save at Mad-Dog’s Mansion because it despawns basket ball and also never pick up the two body armour’s in there because its a one time spawn”.

(5 daily cost of coffee * year = thousands).    

My counter to that, that I use everyday is comparing it to my hourly wage, if my hourly wage is 25, would I work for two hours to pay for something worth 50?     
If doing some housework (painting) is 800, would I work 32 hours (almost a week!) to not do this myself that could take me 5 hours?     
I think it helps alot as it ties it to this idea of retiring, every hour you spend now, is an hour you're not able to spend when you retire.     
Sometimes it makes sense positively too. would you work two hours to take your wife out for a meal, a date, probably! I hope... Get help...    
It also scales with your wage/age, when I was young, my hourly was low but I was fit and able to do things quickly.  now my wage is more, cleaning the gutters/windows costs me only 20 minutes of wage work, but would take me 2 hours plus to do myself.    ",101,1758101692.0,LifeProTips,10,0.94,False

   * Link to the video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5tjtPPEiPw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5tjtPPEiPw)

**Day 1 – PR4: Rota do Carvão**

Expectations:

I began the day with a three-and-a-half-hour drive to Serra da Estrela, dropping the kids off in the morning and then heading to Manteigas to start the PR4 trail. My plan was to hike up, find a camping spot, and spend the night there, expecting to find water sources nearby.

Reality:

As I made my way up the trail, it quickly became clear that the conditions were tougher than I’d anticipated. The water sources I counted on were absent, and I found myself having to speed up the pace to make progress. Because I had to speed up the pace to reach my destination, I ended up skipping meals. The night was tough, and I had just enough water to get with less than a 1L of water. The stream nearby camp had dried and I could not fill up water, clean myself or brush my teeth.

\---

**Day 2 – PR5: Maciço Central**

Morning & Expectations:

After descending from PR4, which took about three hours, I reached Manteigas around 11.30 AM. There, I took a break, had a sandwich, and some coffee and water, and then drove to started the PR5 trail, which started at 1 PM. My plan was to tackle this more technical trail and camp in a valley along the route.

Reality:

The PR5 trail was far more demanding than I had calculated. It was like a vertical obstacle course, and the pace I expected was far too optimistic. It was a fight that went on for every minute of the trail.  Every climb and descent took much longer, and by the time I reached the valley, the conditions were unsafe due to tall grass and snakes. I almost hadn't eaten but I had water. With no safe camping option to camp, I decided to push on 4km to the car. This meant an even longer day and a late return, reaching the car around 8 PM, completely drained.

Challenges: Fatigue from the previous day compounded the difficulty. I was expecting it to be technical, but not all the times. My bad. That meant again I did not account for time stop to eat.

Outcome: Finished the trail, but with clear recognition that the preparation and pacing strategy needed improvement.

\--

**Lessons Learned**

1. Hydration: Expect streams and some smaller ponds to have dried up in summer.
2. Nutrition: Carry more bars, as they are faster to eaten than making a sanwich or a wrap.
3. I have adjusted the formula for calculating time that I take to hike. The Original formula was (KM + (D+\*8))/4.2 . The new formula is now (Km+(D+\*9)+(D-\*7))/4.

\*D+ and D- are expressed in thousands of meeters

✅ Both trails were completed successfully, marking the trip as an achievement in persistence and resilience. The experience highlighted the beauty of Seera Da Estrela.

**Gear Positives:**

* Coros Pace 3 was absolutely vital for 2 reasons: Navigation and managing my effort so I wouldn't burn myself out. I would not have finished the trail without this. Navigation is more accurate than with cellphone and easier to consult.
* Katadyne Befree Due to lack of water sources I had to opt for less optimal water sources and it performed beautifully
* Lanshan 1 pro Small and can fit anywhere. Easy to set up

**Gear Negatives:**

* Food: Too much, and too complex and too big. Need simpler and smaller solutions to have it in the outside and can eat without stopping.
* Foam Pad: Although I felt that I slept I register really poor sleep quality and I atribute that mostly to the pad. Getting older and might need to opt for a more confortable option.
* Rain Jacket: Not that it miss performed, but I last it. I had it strapped to the outside of the backpack and lost it.

I went on a Wednesday around 2pm and the cafe was completely empty - I’ve seen photos of queues on a weekend so recommend! More suitable for a coffee/drink over eating.

I wanted to purchase the special Coach coffee shop T-shirt as you can’t get it elsewhere however you’re not allowed to try it on. I never purchase clothing without trying it first as I find t shirts tricky when you have a larger chest, at £50 I didn’t want to risk it so bought the mug instead! 

The sales associate was lovely however didn’t let me take my bag after purchasing, instead followed me around with it while I browsed. I understand this is because it’s deemed as good customer service however I actually found it really awkward being followed around the store and left quite quickly.

I’ve not seen much online about Coach in Cat Street - price wise for the coffee shop merch:
- T-shirt - £70
- Mug - £30
- Sweatshirt - £150
- Water bottle - £30

Would recommend going but wouldn’t centre it in your day, just go if you’re in Cat Street/Shibuya anyway!

(Long post sorry),"Me and a buddy from high school moved into the same apartment, we are both in our mid twenties and initially it was great because we are such good friends so we eat each others food and occasionally leave messes about and its all good between us because we know each other so well. Well lately I feel he has very little respect for me after a month and a half of living in the same apartment. I noticed that when i clean up after him he rarely is appreciative but if he has to clean up after me (which i try to usually be very careful about not letting happen) he is extremely bothered by it even though its usually a minor error on my part. Earlier this week he dumped coffee grounds all over the floor on accident and just left which is so ridiculous i had to text him to clean it as soon as possible as i would refuse to clean something that egregious. When he gets back he completely ignores me grabs some stuff and tries to leave again but before he leaves i make sure to politely ask him if he could clean it and he does but before he leaves he makes sure to remark about how my gym bag is so stinky and calls it disgusting (its not I disinfectant it regularly but who knows maybe i acclimated to its smell so whatever). He sleeps odd hours which i knew before we moved in together but i figured it wouldn’t be a problem and it really hasn’t been until right now. I am sitting open eyed in my bed at 3:54 am and have to wake up at 5:30 am which he knows. The reason i am wide awake is because at 11:30 this guy gets the crazy idea to clean the entire apartment without telling me beforehand of course. So at midnight i hear this guy vacuuming, moving furniture and rattling pots and pans. I try to give him the benefit of the doubt before i realize what hes doing. I go in there at 12:30 to tell him to stop and he says “im almost finished” i say whatever and go back in my room and again i try to give the guy the benefit of the doubt because maybe he was good intentioned and not thinking clearly. So i text him that I appreciate his efforts to be productive which he ignored like all of my text this week and try to go back to sleep thinking he will quit soon. He continues until 1:30 and i was just about to go in there and yell at him but thankfully he stopped. I probably wasnt able to go to sleep until 2ish and i woke up at 3:00 am probably from the stress he is causing me. Now i am so upset i cannot go back to sleep. He also does little things like leave trash in my car and also always wants to go in my car when we go out and when i ask why cant we take his car he always gives an excuse that hes been driving too much or hes been drinking. The way he talks to me sometimes recently is so condescending too, like I’m an idiot or something. An example is the first two weeks when he kept locking me out of the apartment and insisting that he wasn’t. I got into an argument with him where i forced him to demonstrate how he locks the door. I had to prove to him that he was deadbolting the door. After he realized he was wrong he just dropped it immediately despite giving me hell about it for the last two weeks. I told him he left the coffee maker on when he had been away for the last four hours (i dont drink coffee) he insisted that i dont know how coffee machines work and was mad that i turned it off. He didnt act like this before and i dont know why hes acting like this now that weve moved into the same apartment. Ive known this guy like 8 years and he hasn’t done this stuff before i just found out he takes antidepressants regularly which may or may not be related idk.

The exhaustion and strain this disease brings along with it has been tricky to cope with. I frequently fall asleep right after work or shortly after dinner (usually in all my clothes with the lights on, yep I am that tired). Then I wake up for a few hours after midnight and get everything done that I should have completed that evening. This has gone on and on for 3 years (2 before diagnosis but having DED, OR, and this year since being diagnosed in January). 

My screen heavy, WFH job does me no favors. My eyes are sleepy and make me sleepy. I can drink two shots of espresso and be out like a light 4 minutes later because my eyes feel so heavy and exhausted I feel like I need to close them. I take my dog out 4 times a day in this sunny, dry, windy, dusty, debilitating desert which never helps but I can't skip it (but I know it is really the screen work hurting me the most). 

In between work calls and meetings, I am setting up doctor appointments, attending appts,  paying doc bills, etc. Etc. It is hard to juggle with an already stressful job.

I make smoothie packs to use during the week (spinach, greek yogurt, banana, blueberries, turmeric, etc), try to stick to anti inflammatory cooking/meal prep for the week, try to keep up on my eye routines and cleaning, meds, etc., research and read in my free time to find things that might help (FL 41 glasses were my most recent win for light sensitivity!).

But I am having such a hard time sticking to routines and not getting thrown off (usually by weird sleeping patterns/exhaustion from screen use/outside environmental factors that I have to be in). Sometimes I don't feel so bad because I know rest is so uber important for us, but sometimes I just want to have a normal routine and I want to feel like I can upkeep the things that I need to upkeep. There is always something I can't get to, something that stacks up (like laundry, etc.). I try to be gentle with myself but sometimes I am just so frustrated like I am always playing catch up or behind or thrown off or can't get to important things.

It's 2 am, I passed out after having coffee early this evening to try to stay awake because I had a lot to do and once again didn't make it. I'll be up for two hours to try to make up for it all, eye routine, dishes, showering, topical meds, etc. After a few more hours of sleep, work will hit strong at 8 am and won't stop till 5 and I will be groggy as heck from messing up my sleep again. 

I am looking at a lot of things to help like location change, career change, on and on. How do you all find the time to manage this disease and still upkeep your lives???? I got my stress levels pretty well under control so I can't even say it is that really, moreso just the nature of the beast I guess. I was always good about routines before this hit so it is hard to digest that I constantly feel like I am flailing!

TL;DR - This is a lot to manage!!! How are you guys making it work?",1,1758100874.0,Dryeyes,0,1.0,False

One of my roommates is really on my nerves. I’ve had to ask her multiple times to clean up after herself which progressively get worse. The first time it was just garbage (which she left on the floor instead of taking it out until the bag leaked which I had to clean up because she wasn’t doing anything about it) then it was food splashed around the oven, and the other day she blew her nose without a tissue apparently and apparently free shot her snot all over the sink in the bathroom and left it. I was like hey I left Clorox wipes in the bathroom please clean this up & I’m getting frustrated that I have to keep asking you to clean up after yourself. 2 days after that sink incident I got sick (unsure with what, I’ll be going to the doctor tomorrow). It’s disgusting and a conversation I never thought I’d have (telling someone not to leave biohazards everywhere). I can be messy too but my messes are all contained to my room and it’s only clothes being out of place. 
Everyday she bothers me asking to hang out with me. I understand maybe she’s lonely but I also have things to do (I’m in school and also work from home). And we don’t have much in common so I don’t really enjoy hanging out with her, not to be rude. She doesn’t understand I can be home and still be busy. When I say I can’t hang out she’s passive aggressive and slamming doors and stuff. She also has bpd, which I don’t want to hold against her but I just want her to leave me alone. I brought expensive appliances from home like air fryer coffee machine etc & she will use my stuff and then not clean it properly. And then the other day was freaking out that someone used her spoon and I was like look on the drying rack & if u don’t want someone using it keep it in ur own cupboard not in a shared drawer. And she still is coming to me again and again like have you seen my spoon, I don’t give a fuck about your spoon, and it’s not my job to keep track of your stuff! How am I sharing stuff that’s 10x as expensive and not complaining & she’s making drama over a freaking spoon like are you kidding me. 
I’m honestly really annoyed about the snot I think that was the nail in the coffin for me. Just the mental image of her free spraying snot around my tooth brush and then leaving it in the bathroom, I can’t deal with it anymore. I know there’s lots of things that can get you sick but the timeline leads me to believe that that was what contaminated me. I don’t care if I sound like an asshole right now, what do I do to make this stop.

I'm a 40-year-old guy from Bombay – well-settled, single, and at a point in life where I truly value meaningful connections and shared experiences. 

I'm hoping to find some like-minded female friends who are open to real conversations, spontaneous hangouts, and maybe even planning some trips together down the line.

A bit about me:
🚗 Love road trips – from weekend getaways to spontaneous drives to nowhere

🎵 Music is always on – from indie to retro, mood decides the playlist

📺 I’m a total OTT buff – always up for movie nights or binge sessions (recommend me something?)

🍜 Big-time foodie – exploring new cafés, street food joints, or just whipping up something fun
I’m easygoing, respectful, and someone who believes friendships don’t have to come with pressure or expectations. Just looking for good vibes, good company, and people who enjoy the lighter side of life.

If you’re someone who loves conversations, coffee, or crazy food trails – hit me up! Let’s see where the friendship road takes us. 😊",1,1758100528.0,RelationshipIndia,2,1.0,False

1nj86vp,https://www.reddit.com/r/gebinah/comments/1nj86vp/significant_otherness/,Significant otherness,"*Gebura sat down on the sofa in front of her coffee table. She lit a cigarette, savoring its flavor for but a moment, before blowing out the smoke. The Patron of Language leaned back into the couch, her mind lost in thought. Something, or rather someone was troubling her heart.*


*Anytime she stumbled into Binah, things got embarrassing. Her heart would inexplicably flutter in the presence of that otherworldly woman, clad in black and feather. She was like a raven to her; a thing she cherished, but only deep down. In reality, she knew the answer, but she was too inexperienced and too scared to puzzle it out.*


*Her mind wandered, and she quickly discarded the thought. She could only think of her in increasingly awkward scenarios, so she decided to shelve it... she wanted to approach Binah regarding this, but Gebura was unsure how. Maybe.... maybe Roland knew something? She had to ask him, and she departed to do so, albeit begrudgingly.*


*Little did Gebura know that she was not alone.*


*Binah poured herself a glass of earl grey tea, sipping it for a moment and studying its flavor. Her mind wandered as well.. the way her heart races, her body heated up, all at the sight of Gebura. Binah had never felt this way before; Sure, she knew what that thrill she got from violence was, but... this was different. It was alien, unknown, and scary... but she liked it as well. She couldn't describe it, but she only knew that Gebura made her feel this way. She needed to confront her about it, but... she was scared. Scared she'd embarrass herself again, scared she'd give Gebura the wrong idea.. but she needed advice. She heard Malkuth had a book on this stuff, so she departed for the floor of history on short notice.*


*The two unknowingly had been pointed to the same place. They found the bookshelf, completely unaware of each other's presence, and began to scan the shelves for that fated book that would give them the advice they needed.*


*They only realized it too late. Upon locating the book, their hands touched at the spine of that lovey-dovey tome. Turning to face who had so gingerly grasped their hand, they saw that it was each other. Gebura was dumbfounded. She nearly gasped as her face grew red with embarrassment, and Binah turned around, chewing on her thumb as the temperature in the room rose. Both of them refused to look one another in the eye, too caught up in their own thoughts. Things like ""Oh god, what is she going to think of me now?"" or ""What do I do? She's right there."" ran through their heads like clockwork. Malkuth spotted Gebura burying her face into her hands, and she peered around, noticing Binah was beside herself, swaying side to side, trying to shake something off.*


""What seems to be the problem?"" *Malkuth inquired, practically skipping over. She noticed the section of the bookshelf the were at. One of the books was loose. She looked at the title, studying the faded lettering on the book's spine, before chuckling.*


""How to approach your crush? You can't be serious..."" *Malkuth giggled, finding great amusement in their jest.. only for her to realize that the duo were blushing. Occasionally shooting longing glances over each other's shoulders, refusing to even breathe in each other's presence.* ""Oh my god... you're serious."" *Malkuth was finally reading the room, and a big grin formed on her face.* ""Who knew you two would become a thing?"" ""**WE'RE NOT A THING!!**"" *Both of the wheeled around, missing the humor in Malkuth suggestion, only to realize that they were looking at eachother again, before sulking to themselves once more.* ""Look, just... don't get the wrong idea, ya hear?"" *Gebura stammered, before stamping her foot into the wooden floorboards and storming off in a huff. You could practically see the words ""doki-doki"" following her as her poor little heart tied itself into knots. Meanwhile, Binah stood frozen, lost to her own ruminations, before getting dizzy.*


*She collapsed to the floor, a trickle of a nosebleed dripping down her face. This was too much for her to process. This bizarre feeling was overtaking the two of them. Malkuth simply left her there, and the former arbiter departed shortly after.*


*Later in the week, the two decided to confide in someone. Someone who would take their thoughts and prayers with a lot of weight, and someone they knew they could trust: Hokma.*


*Unfortunately, they had the same idea, and they arrived at the same time. Hokma wandered out from his study, and saw something.. peculiar unfolding before him.* ""Can I help you?"" *He inquired with a bewildered expression. Hokma raised his eyebrow, seeing the tension between the two. It was palpable enough to be cut with a knife. He could glean what was going on between The Red Mist and her rival. He shut the book he was carrying, setting it down on an empty shelf, and simply sighed.*


""I see what's going on here."" *He stated simply, adjusting his monocle and gesturing for them to have a seat. However, he had not intention of sharing the table with them, much to their dismay.* ""I think it'd be best if you talk this out with each other. Would you like anything to drink?"" *Hokma asked. Gebura ended up speaking first.* ""Uhm... t-tea... black tea would be... fine... I think.."" *Gebura's hardened demeanor had completely melted, and Binah's own oppressiveness held a new hue, stained by emotional tension.* ""What... she's getting... yes.. that.. that would be... nice...""


*Hokma went to prepare tea, and after around ten minutes, he returned, but he could tell they were about to open up to one another. Placing their cups onto the table would cut into this moment, so he decided to wait until they were more comfortable conversing with each other.* ""H-hey... Binah, I-"" *Gebura paused, waiting for the words to reach her lips.* ""Do you... have you been getting this weird... uhm... fleeting feeling around me? It's like... its kinda what I felt when Xiao was here, but more... personal.""

*Binah was processing those words, before building a response. She wanted to lie, she really did. Maybe this would be over with if she lied, but... Gebura would see through that. She decided to try anyway.* ""W-what do you mean? No... I... I'd never felt- I mean... I don't understand what you're... trying to say."" *Binah stammered, with little bullets of sweat rolling down her temples. She was now refusing to make eye contact, practically hiding within her own cloak.* ""Y-you're... such a bad liar... you know that?"" *Gebura spoke shakily.* ""Y-yeah.."" *Binah agreed. She couldn't help but enjoy this new feeling, as scary as it was. Then, Hokma placed the tea onto the table, and poured it into their cups from the kettle. Gebura took a sip.. it tasted better than.. well, when she normally drank tea. Something inexplicable enriched its flavor, and Binah also noticed. She shared that sentiment. Somehow... being with one another seemed to brighten up all the colors in their world. It made food taste better... but they shook away those thoughts. They simply savored the tea.*


""So... do... do you.."" *Gebura began, unable to finish.* ""I... I get the feeling that... we're more than just... friends.."" *Gebura spoke, pressing her fingers into one another.* ""Do you want to be... more than friends?""


*Binah slowly nodded.* ""Y-yes, I... I wouldn't mind that..."" ""That's.... great to.. hear."" *Gebura slowly began to process what she proposed, and Binah did as well, and soon, the air grew hot, snuffing out their words. They just sat there, red in the face, enjoying the tea. After they finished, they thanked Hokma for the drinks, stood still for a very awkward five seconds, and hurriedly left. When they returned to their respective floors, they clutched at their heart; It ached... but... they didn't mind it. Gebura slouched down on the sofa, exasperated with herself, while Binah curled up in her bed, trying to get some shuteye.*


*Both of them failed to get proper sleep... for this new light; it kept their minds racing. Binah was like a dark angel for Gebura, and Gebura was like a maiden of war for Binah. They couldn't sleep... not.. not without each other. As Binah tossed and turned under the covers, a knock was heard at her door. Binah crept out of bed, and slowly opened the door. Gebura stood before her. She was wearing her pajamas. Night was falling over the Library, and she couldn't sleep.*


""Do... do ya mind if I doze off here with ya?"" *Gebura asked bluntly, apparently allergic to eye-contact. Binah invited her inside, and the two nuzzled up into bed with each other. Their eyes met as the weight of the comforters bore down on them... and they began to relax... and shortly afterwards, they drifted off into the realm of the dreaming... together.*

I never imagined growing up I would be single at this age, but that's how it's turned out sadly.

I'm 5'11, light brown hair, dark blue eyes. I'm looking for somebody like minded to me, which is somebody that is a bit of a home body, likes staying in rather than going out to clubs. Somebody that likes going for a hike in nature rather than a shopping spree in a busy place.

I'm into psychology, religion, weightlifting, science and philosophy.

I have not watched TV in 20 years and rarely watch movies but wouldn't mind. I like to game but in moderation.

I'm very into nutrition and keeping fit, but I don't look like a bodybuilder or something, just a regular guy that tries and sometimes succeeds taking care of himself.

I've currently returned to college for a year, looking at management jobs.

I'm looking for somebody that is not focused on ambition or ""success"", that is content in life and does not feel that something is missing in them that they need to fix by validation from the outside world.

I'm very easy going and laidback, I love life, love to laugh and have fun and would not do well with people that are high strung, argumentative or  that always needs to be occupying themselves in twenty different ways. I would not do well with a woman with ADHD for example. If you're the kind of woman that is content just sipping a cup of coffee while reading a book, you would be perfect for me.

# Read Link: [**https://writers.juegofree.com/cobblestone-1/**](https://writers.juegofree.com/cobblestone-1/) 

I dragged myself down the cobblestone path. My body ached. My feet hurt. But my heart was singing. 

“Just a few more hours,” I whispered. “Until tonight.” 

Tonight was everything. No more going back to that house. No more pretending they were family. 

I’d already asked for time off work. My boss spat at me. Called me lazy. Typical. Omegas always got the worst treatment. 

But I didn’t care tonight. 

I was going to Gabriel’s. My boyfriend. Soon-to-be fiancé. 

Tomorrow was the Lunar Assembly. Sacred ceremony. Wolves finding their mates under the Moon Goddess. Tomorrow was also my 

eighteenth birthday. Finally old enough. 

Gabriel promised we’d bond tomorrow. I could escape forever. 

Gabriel. Rich. Gorgeous. An Alpha’s brother. Sure, I was just an omega. But Gabriel said bloodlines didn’t matter. Love mattered. 

I practically skipped toward his house. My heart hammered with excitement. Beautiful stone building in the center of town. So much 

better than our pathetic wooden shack. Soon I’d live here. With Gabriel. Forever. 

I knocked eagerly. 

Nothing. 

My smile faltered. That’s… odd. Gabriel said he’d be waiting. He promised. 

I tried the handle. Unlocked. Relief flooded through me. He must be inside. Maybe preparing a surprise? 

“Gabriel? It’s me!” I called out cheerfully. 

Silence. 

Wait. What was that? Sounds from upstairs. My heart lifted again. He was home after all. 

Then I heard it clearly. 

Laughter. 

Female laughter. 

Moaning. 

My world stopped spinning. No. No, that couldn’t be- 

1/5 

The sounds grew louder. Clearer. Destroying me with every breath. 

Gasps. Bed springs creaking. A voice that made my soul shatter. 

“Oh God, Gabriel… right there…” 

Valerie. My stepsister. 

My brain refused to process it. This wasn’t happening. This was a nightmare. I’d wake up any second. 

The bedroom door hung slightly open. Like a cruel invitation to witness my destruction. I saw them. 

Gabriel’s muscled back. Moving. Valerie’s pale body beneath him. Her golden hair fanned across his pillow like a victory flag. 

No no no no no. 

“You feel so much better than I imagined,” Gabriel panted. 

My heart exploded into a thousand pieces. Each word was a dagger. 

Valerie laughed. That cruel, sharp sound I knew so well. “Better than that pathetic omega sister of mine, I bet. Poor little Sera probably 

doesn’t even know what to do with a real man.” 

The air left my lungs. I couldn’t breathe. Couldn’t think. Could only feel the agony ripping through my chest. 

“Don’t.” Gabriel’s voice was rough. “Don’t mention her when we’re like this.” 

“Why not?” Valerie’s fingers traced his spine like she owned him. “After tomorrow, she’ll know exactly where she stands. An omega like 

her could never satisfy you.” 

Each word was a physical blow. I stumbled backward, gasping for air. My shoulder slammed into the wall. The sound echoed like a 

gunshot. 

“What was that?” Valerie hissed. 

My wolf surged forward. Rage I’d never felt before. My foot connected with the door. It crashed against the wall. 

“WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?” 

They jumped apart. Gabriel nearly fell off the bed scrambling for his pants. Valerie just sat up. Didn’t even cover herself. 

“Seraphina!” Gabriel went white. “I can explain-” 

“Explain?” My voice cracked. “Explain how you’re screwing my sister?” 

“It’s not what you 

think-” 

“IT’S EXACTLY WHAT I THINK!” Tears streamed down my face. “You lying, cheating bastard!” 

Valerie stretched. Finally reached for Gabriel’s shirt. “Oh, sister dear. You really thought he’d choose you?” She tilted her head. Mock 

sympathy. “How cute.”

“Valerie, don’t,” Gabriel warned. But his voice was weak. 

“Don’t what? Tell her the truth?” Valerie stood up slowly. “That Mom and Dad have known about us for months? That they practically threw me at Gabriel because they were embarrassed by their precious Alpha family being tied to an omega reject?” 

The world spun. “You’re lying.” 

“Am I?” Valerie moved to the mirror. Ran her fingers through her hair. “Why don’t you go home and ask them? I’m sure they’re waiting. 

Probably with our engagement announcement.” 

“Sera, listen-” Gabriel finally got his pants on. “This doesn’t have to change anything between us. We can still be friends-” 

“FRIENDS?” I lunged toward him. He caught my wrists. 

“You need to calm down,” he said. His grip was tight. Bruising. “Think about your position. Your family. You don’t want to make this 

worse.” 

I stared into his eyes. Eyes that had whispered promises just days ago. Now they were cold. Calculating. 

“Let go of me,” I whispered. 

“Sera-” 

“LET GO OF ME!” 

I wrenched free and ran. I burst through our front door. Victor and Elizabeth sat calmly in the living room. An elegant invitation lay on 

the coffee table between them. 

They showed no surprise at my tear-stained face. 

“You already knew?” My voice was barely a whisper. 

“Seraphina, sit down.” Victor’s voice was ice. “Yes, we know about Gabriel and Valerie. We fully support it.” 

Elizabeth picked up the invitation. Held it out. “This is their engagement announcement. Tomorrow at the Lunar Assembly, Gabriel will 

propose to Valerie. They hope you’ll attend as Valerie’s sister.” 

I stared at the beautiful invitation. Gabriel and Valerie’s names in gold. The silver Nightshadow crest. It was all real. 

“Why?” My voice cracked. “Why would you do this to me?” 

“Enough!” Victor shot to his feet. Backhanded me across the face. Hard. I crashed to the floor. My cheek burned. 

“You’re nothing but an abandoned child we took in out of pity. What right do you have to insult our daughter?” 

“You should be grateful we raised you.” Elizabeth’s voice was cold. “Now you know your place. Tomorrow you’ll bless your sister’s 

engagement. Then find yourself a suitable omega mate.” 

“I won’t!” I struggled to my feet. Tasted blood. “I’ll never bless this betrayal!” 

Victor raised his hand again. This time I was ready. I dodged and ran for the door.

“Get out of our house!” Elizabeth shrieked behind me. “Ungrateful little brat!” 

I fled into the night. Running blindly. Tears falling like broken pearls. 

I didn’t know where I was going; I only knew I couldn’t stop moving or the crushing pain would swallow me whole. I didn’t know how 

long I ran, but eventually I found myself on Main Street when a familiar voice made me stop. 

“Sera!” 

I spun around to see Ophelia running toward me, her dark hair flying behind her. 

“I saw you run in-what happened? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.” 

“Worse.” I collapsed into her arms. “I’ve seen the truth.” 

“Tell me.” 

So I did. Every horrible detail, every cruel word. Ophelia held me while I shook. 

“Those bastards,” she hissed when I finished. “All of them. Gabriel, Valerie, your so-called parents.” 

“What am I going to do?” I cried against her shoulder. “Tomorrow is the Lunar Assembly. Everyone will see Gabriel and Valerie’s 

engagement. I’ll be the laughingstock of the entire pack.” 

“Listen to me, Sera.” Ophelia stroked my hair gently. “We’re not waiting for that damned ceremony. Tonight, we’re going to Silver Moon 

Harbor!” 

“What?” I pulled back to look at her, still having tears on my face. 

“I heard there’s a huge party in Silver Moon Harbor tonight. Lots of wolves from other packs who are here for tomorrow’s ceremony will be there.” Ophelia’s eyes sparkled with excitement. “We’re going to have some fun and forget all about these bastards and your heartless 

family!” 

“But… but I…” I hesitated. As an omega, Silver Moon Harbor was completely foreign territory to me. 

“But what?” Ophelia gripped my hands. “Sera, you’ve lost everything here. Instead of staying to be humiliated tomorrow, let’s go to Silver 

Moon Harbor and try our luck. Maybe you’ll meet your real destined mate-someone who won’t give a damn about your bloodline.” 

I looked into Ophelia’s determined eyes, thinking about the cruel words I’d heard in Gabriel’s bedroom, remembering my parents’ cold 

faces, imagining the humiliation I’d face tomorrow… 

“Okay.” I wiped away my tears, feeling a fierce courage I’d never experienced before. “Let’s go to Silver Moon Harbor tonight. Let all those 

people go to hell!” 

Ophelia grinned with delight. “Now that’s my Seraphina! Come on, let’s go back to my place and get ready. Tonight, we’re going to show the most beautiful girl!”

I've learnt a lot from the posts on this group. 
I was recently diagnosed with LPR after a long sore throat episode that wasn't improving after several vists they did a laryngoscopy and evidence of inflammation and fluid build up. 

I have a history of chronic sinusitis and nasal polyps so I thought that is what caused the thoat clearing and choking feeling at night but turns out it was my gut. After laryngoscopy and PPI throat pain persisted and I saw a gastroenterologists who did an upper endoscopy. Evidence of gastritis and reflux eosaphagitis was found by luckily no H pylori. Regimen was Vonoprazan and itopride. Also have a recommended diet avoiding coffee, spiced foods, tomatoes as well as eating at least 2 hours before bed. 

I've also got a wedge pillow at home but I travel a lot and use extra pillows at hotels. The throat inflammation still persists but not my neck hurts too. I use one pillow with the wedge at home which is about 7 inches high. 
What is the best way to reduce strain on my neck? I don't want to have to resort to pain meds all the time!

1nj82bg,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeineDummenFragen/comments/1nj82bg/die_eröffnung_einer_neuen_kette_lässt_mich_fragen/,Die Eröffnung einer neuen Kette lässt mich fragen - warum ist der deutsche Kaffeemarkt so unfassbar beschissen?,"Natürlich geht es um LAP Coffee, die ja grade überall Filialen mit VC Money aufmachen. Dass das sofort die Antikapitalisten auf den Platz ruft ist mir klar, aber darum soll es hier nicht gehen. **Eigentlich will ich eher verstehen, warum der deutsche Kaffeemarkt generell so beschissen ist.** Sonst würde es ja gar keine Nische für LAP Coffee geben.

Es gibt ja irgendwie gefühlt 3 Varianten hierzulande: 

* **Hipster Tempel:** Irgendein prätentiöser Laden namens ""Kaffeegeschwister"" oder sowas, in dem Barista-Markus (der 10 Jahre in Bolivien gelebt hat, um die Seele der Bohne zu verstehen) dir nen Espresso für 4€ serviert. Der ist dann meistens so sauer, dass Center-Shock keinen USP mehr hat, aber hey, er hat die letzten 0,01% Geschmack aus der handgestreichelten Bio-Bohne rausgeholt.
* **Die Tankstellenplörre:** Für 2€ bekommst du an der Tanke oder beim Billig-Bäcker eine braune Brühe, die primär nach Spülwasser mit Kaffeeresten schmeckt. Man trinkt es, um nicht am Steuer einzuschlafen, nicht für den Genuss.
* **Die Ketten-Verbrennung:** Starbucks, Espresso House und Co. Hier kriegst du maximal zerröstete Bohnen, die nur noch nach Teer schmecken. Der Espresso kostet dann vielleicht 3,70 € statt 4€ um sich irgendwie vom Bolivien-Markus abzuheben.

Und jetzt kommt LAP Coffee und sagt: ""Pass auf, wir geben dir für 2,50€ nen Espresso aus einem guten Vollautomaten.

1nj821d,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1nj821d/should_you_choose_aqua_crest_fxhtc_water_filter/,Should You Choose AQUA CREST FXHTC Water Filter Review for Reliable Home Filtration?,"**Aqua Crest FXHTC Whole House Water Filter: A Daily User’s Perspective**

The Aqua Crest FXHTC Whole House Water Filter, boasting compatibility with an array of models like the GE FXHTC and Culligan WH-HD200-C, quickly caught my eye while browsing for a reliable water filtration solution. Living in an area notorious for hard water and sediment issues, this pack of three filters claimed to tackle the challenges head-on. After several months of daily use, I have a lot to share about both its highlights and areas where it falls short.

**Daily Performance and Filtration Quality**

One of the standout strengths of this water filter is its efficient multi-layer filtration system. The combination of food-grade polypropylene and granular activated coconut carbon truly delivers cleaner and fresher water. I noticed an immediate difference in the water clarity and taste, especially since it significantly reduces chlorine, lead, and rust. The granular structure also excels at filtering out particles larger than 5 microns, which means sediments don’t stand a chance. Even my coffee started tasting better, free from any lingering metallic undertones.

**Ease of Installation for Busy People**

Installing the filters was pleasantly straightforward. I’m not exactly a DIY enthusiast, but the entire process took me no more than ten minutes. The three-step installation requires minimal tools, which made it a no-brainer. For someone who values time as much as I do, this was a big selling point. I’ve even had my 16-year-old son help me replace the second filter, and he managed it without asking for assistance. That simplicity earned some cool points in our household.

[Check Aqua Crest FXHTC price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b0b4nn8rct/)

**An Investment in Longevity**

These filters are designed to last between 3 to 6 months or 30,000 gallons, depending on water quality. My family of five runs through quite a bit of water daily, yet I’ve observed minimal pressure drops since installing these. Compared to other filters I’ve used, the consistent water flow of 4 GPM was a game-changer. It even helped me extend the lifespan of my appliances, particularly the dishwasher and washing machine, which suffered frequent issues due to sediment buildup in the past.

**Strengths**

- Effectively removes a wide range of contaminants like chlorine, lead, benzene, rust, and odors.
- Installation is quick and user-friendly for people of all experience levels.
- Extended filter life ensures consistent performance over several months.
- Multi-layer filtration delivers not just clean but great-tasting water.
- Compatible with a variety of water filter systems, offering versatility.

**Areas for Improvement**

- Bulkiness of the filters could be a concern for tight installation spaces.
- Coconut shell carbon sometimes emits a faint odorous residue during initial use, though this dissipates after flushing.
- Packaging could be sturdier, as one of my filters arrived with slight dents (though it didn’t affect performance).

**Product Rivals**

I’ve previously tried a few competing water filters, such as the Culligan RFC-BBSA and Pentek RFC-BB models. While both of these alternatives are competent and compatible, they fall short in terms of ease of installation. Culligan’s model, for instance, requires more frequent replacements due to its shorter lifespan, making Aqua Crest a cost-effective alternative. On the other hand, Pentek filters tend to offer comparable performance but come at a slightly higher price point. Where this product excels is in its attention to user convenience and its focus on both efficiency and affordability.

**Affordable Quality**

Given its ability to provide effective filtration and steady water flow without a significant price tag, I’d say this water filter scores highly in terms of value. It’s an affordable way to improve water quality in your home while protecting your appliances from sediment buildup. This isn’t a flashy or high-tech product, but for straightforward functionality, it offers more than you’d expect for the investment. Would I buy it again? Absolutely.

1nj81u5,https://www.reddit.com/r/pigeons/comments/1nj81u5/rejected_eggs/,Rejected eggs?,"Hi guys, I've had some visitors on my balcony during summer so I put out a water bowl for them to drink. Turns out it got empty at some point and they used it as a nesting spot. Best pigeon's nest I've seen so far. I was very proud and checked on them regularly. At some point between the day and night shift switch between mom&dad, I saw that they had 2 eggs in total.

Yesterday morning I caught another glimpse and egg #2 was nowhere to be found, but mom came to sit in for her shift anyway.
By the evening I saw that the nest was empty and egg #1 had been kicked out of the bowl too. It was cracked too and I checked it with a lamp, the inside was watery too, so nothing to save.

This morning no pigeons, and I was having my coffee closeby. Heard momma come in for her shift. Spilled coffee all over myself out of excitement. Once that was solved I checked and saw the egg still discarded to the side and momma sitting proudly on the empty nest. I gently approached her as if to pet her (never done anything like it, so she gently freaked out and fled the scene). I took the bowl away so she wouldn't attempt to lay again, since I have to move within a month and I don't want other people to throw out a possible new egg.

I still have the nest, intact and all, it's on my other balcony. Should I return it, do they need a grieving period?

TLDR: had 2 pigeon eggs, they got rejected (?) by the parents and I took the empty nest away bcs I have to move out soon. Should I put the nest back to allow a grieving period?",2,1758099893.0,pigeons,1,1.0,False

Then, *stab.* A toothpick pierced its skin with a muffled, almost obscene pop, splitting the green flesh so its fragments drifted like wreckage.

Elisabeth tipped the glass and drank it down in one gulp. Then she set the empty vessel beside two others already lined up on the polished counter, a silent tally of her unraveling evening.

The bar exhaled a different kind of darkness than her apartment. Black-velvet walls muffled sound, jazz slinked through the air, and pools of lamplight exposed couples tucked into alcoves, whispering into each other's ears. Lovers, confidants, predators. She watched them with a kind of dull envy, her gaze moving from one pair of clasped hands to another.

Her reflection shimmered faintly in the mirrored back wall, her face a little too pale, her smile long gone, eyes rimmed with fatigue. Once, she would have been the center of the room's gravity. Now she was just another woman hiding in its shadows.

The bartender, young and slick-haired, caught her signal. He wordlessly began the ritual of shaking and pouring. Elisabeth didn't thank him. The drink wasn't a gift; it was an anesthetic.

She folded her hands together on the bar, pressing hard enough for her knuckles to whiten, and waited.

\---

The apartment lay in darkness, its only witness the oversized photograph of Elisabeth Sparkle, forever smiling. That glossy, conquering grin watched over the room like a cruel joke while, from deeper inside, the sound of retching echoed down the hallway.

The roses on the table had withered in their cellophane coffin, their petals limp, their fragrance gone.

In the bathroom, Elisabeth clung to the toilet, her body shuddering with the violence of it. When she finally staggered upright, she leaned heavily against the sink and let the cold water run. She splashed her face again and again, as if drowning out the taste of bile, as if scrubbing away the memory of the evening. The towel she grabbed caught only half the water, smearing her makeup into black streaks. In the mirror, she didn't see herself so much as a caricature, a grotesque mask, eyes swollen, mascara dripping like greasepaint. A sad clown staring back at her.

She left the light behind and drifted into the living room. Beyond the glass, the city burned with indifferent brilliance. Billions of lights glimmered, moving and living. The world spun on without her.

Her gaze landed on the window ledge, crowded with the artifacts of her own mythology: framed photographs with famous smiles around her, little golden statues, mementos from premieres and parties, the impossible night she held the Oscar aloft. Proof she had existed, once.

She picked up a snow globe. Inside, a tiny doll-version of herself stood atop a pink star, her very own piece of the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Elisabeth shook it, and golden flakes spiraled through the water like magic dust, drifting around the plastic figurine that had once been her dream. The glitter fell in slow motion, too beautiful to be real, too mocking to endure.

Her hand clenched. She spun, hurled the globe across the room. It exploded against the giant framed poster of herself. *BAM!*

Glass shattered. Liquid sprayed across the image, trailing down the bright smile frozen on the poster. A jagged crack split across one glossy eye, as though someone had punched her doppelgänger in the face.

Breathing hard, Elisabeth marched to the table, grabbed the bouquet of wilted flowers, their stems slimy in her grip, and stalked toward the kitchen.

She flung the wilted bouquet into the kitchen trash. Plastic stems crunched against coffee grounds and eggshells.

Then silence ensued.

A black silence that seemed to press in on her from all sides.

*Clack.*

The lid opened again. From the darkness of the bin, her own face hovered above like a pale apparition. Elisabeth hesitated, then reached in. Her fingers pushed through sticky refuse, slippery food scraps clinging to her skin, until she found it: the USB stick. She drew it out, slick with residue, as though it had been dredged from a swamp.

That night she sat on the edge of her bed, the lamp's weak glow carving a circle around her. The rest of the room was all shadow. The phone rested heavy in her hand, its dial tone steady, insistent. She pressed the number, and the line began to ring, slow, methodical, each crackle pulling her deeper into a place she wasn't sure she wanted to go.

Ring. Ring.

At last: a voice. Masculine. Low. A cavern more than a sound.

""Yes?""

The breathing on the other end was heavy and uneven. Elisabeth swallowed. Her voice came out softer than she intended:

""I'd like to… order?""

A pause. Then, flat and mechanical:

""Address?""

Panic. She hadn't prepared for this. She grabbed the nearest pen and scribbled as fast as she could, the numbers bleeding into the skin of her palm.

""1057 North Beverly Drive. Please note: 35 North Byron Alley.""

The line went dead.

Elisabeth sat still, staring at the ink crawling across her hand. The silence of the room expanded around her until there was nothing left but the sound of her own breathing.

The next thing she knew, a mechanical whirring dragged her awake. Sunlight stabbed through the curtains. She was still in her dress, crumpled on top of the bedspread, her mouth dry as dust. Her skull felt too small for her brain.

She pushed herself upright, each movement stabbing into her temples, and stumbled toward the hall.

The hum grew louder. At the far end of the corridor, Maria, the cleaning lady, was pushing a vacuum, methodically sweeping up invisible dust.

Elisabeth managed a hoarse:

""Hello, Maria.""

The woman straightened and smiled politely.

""Hello, ma'am.""

The world had moved on without her, again.

\---

The water pummeled her like a punishment. A white roar filled the shower stall, beating down on her scalp, flattening her hair until it clung to her skin in dark strands. She tilted her face upward, and the jet stripped away the smeared traces of last night, the mascara bleeding down the drain like ink, the foundation dissolving until there was nothing left but her bare, naked skin.

She let it wash over her until she felt nothing at all.

At the kitchen table, Elisabeth hunched in her bathrobe, steam still rising faintly from her damp hair. A glass hissed in front of her, a single aspirin fizzing and dissolving into cloudy water.

Across the room, Maria pushed the vacuum in perfect, mechanical lines—left to right, right to left—like a figurine locked into its groove, immune to chaos.

Elisabeth reached for the newspaper. She wasn't looking for anything in particular, only distraction. But her eyes caught the classifieds. She froze.

There it was. A casting call. The role of *herself.* Or rather, the role she had once embodied, already being offered to someone younger and fresher.

She forced herself to turn the page. To breathe and to regroup.

The paper went into the wastebasket with a crumple that felt final.

She sifted through the rest of the mail: glossy fliers, bills, envelopes she didn't care to open. And then, one that stopped her. White, handwritten. No stamp. No postmark. Someone had placed it there, directly into her life.

The seal on the back: a single, embossed *S.*

She tore it open. Inside, a plastic card. White and minimal. Only a number printed on the front: **503.**

She flipped it over and there was nothing.

Her eyes flicked from the card to her palm. The inked address from last night had blurred under the shower, a ghost of letters and numbers, almost gone.

The vacuum droned on, unbearable now, chewing up silence with its endless, nasal insistence.

She gripped the card tighter, as if it were a lifeline.",1,1758099372.0,demonhatstories,0,1.0,False

You, repeatedly, say that I need mental help. Okay. Thanks to all of you for caring, and for commenting. Here’s what happened next. My friend went to a mental health camp. You didn’t know he had his mental health to do, did you? He wanted to see me before he left, and I didn’t get the chance to reply to his text. My friend trusts me, and I have been tested as mentally well; so, I had to figure this one out…. Breathe…. When he returned from his camp, he connected with me once more. I agreed to meet him. We went for coffee and tried to buy some new pink drinks on the menu. We like bubble tea. The drinks came back nothing like the pictures, and yet, I decided to let this go this time to stop complaints. Pink milk on ice isn’t so bad, anyway… Breathe ….When we were finished he wanted to walk me home. There was a bus out in front of the café that would get him closer to his home. I had wanted to bring him to a comedy club night at a nearby venue, but he had declined my offer. That’s alright. The bus ride detoured and I walked home and cooked some dinner…. Later that night after some good dreams this “brain takeover” dream began again. Then I realized what was happening…. I have to thank you all for advising help, and yet, psychiatric help is a big and arduous undertaking. For a woman like me with family, babies, grand babies, even prenatal ones, at scattered addresses, involving strangers in sorting out thoughts and feelings that won’t make any sense to them anyway isn’t what we deserve or need.

- Built on the Extended Isolation Forest algorithm, ExIFFI adds a lightweight post‑processing step that quantifies each variable’s contribution to a flagged observation.
- Optimized for real‑time deployment: it extracts the most influential features, assembles a concise narrative, and incurs minimal computational overhead.
- Evaluated on three industrial datasets, including the newly released CoffeeData benchmark, delivering clearer explanations and lower compute cost compared with other state‑of‑the‑art explainable anomaly detection methods.
- Engineers reported that feature‑level summaries helped pinpoint faulty sensors and enabled quicker corrective actions.
- Supports Industry 5.0 objectives and emerging AI‑explainability regulations, improving operator trust in automated alerts.

Why it matters: Transparent diagnostics can reduce unplanned downtime and satisfy regulatory expectations for explainable AI in safety‑critical processes.

We're nearly done putting up the netting on our catio (don't worry, I'll post pics once she's allowed in there :) )

I'm not thinking about furniture; we have a relatively big space, so I want to get a coffee table and chairs for us humans, but I'm also thinking about cat furniture.

We'll attach some to the frame in the long run, but for now, does anyone have recommendations for where to buy outdoor safe cat trees in the UK? For a bit of context:

* We're based in the UK
* We'd hope to leave it out most/all of the time
* The catio doesn't have a roof; it's just netted on all sides

Any thoughts? Thanks!

It was cold and rainy, and I had zero plans except to stay in, watch Netflix, and maybe do laundry if I felt ambitious. The only reason I left my apartment was because I ran out of coffee. And if there’s one thing I can’t survive without, it’s coffee.

There’s a small café down the street I go to all the time. Nothing fancy just a cozy spot where they know your order if you go often enough. I wasn’t even fully awake when I walked in, standing in line and scrolling on my phone, when I heard someone behind me laugh.

Not a polite laugh. A real, unfiltered laugh.

I turned around without thinking.

She was standing there in a bright yellow raincoat, holding a broken umbrella like it had just lost a battle. She caught me staring and grinned.  
“Guess my umbrella gave up before I did,” she said.

I laughed, and just like that, we started talking.

It was small talk at first the weather, how the café always smelled like burnt toast, how neither of us could function without caffeine. But there was something about her. She made even boring conversation feel… fun.

When I got my coffee, I almost just left. But instead, I said, “Hey, if you’re not in a rush, want to sit for a bit?”

She didn’t hesitate. “Sure.”

We sat by the window, talking while rain streaked down the glass. Thirty minutes passed like five. Before I knew it, she had to leave, and I was working up the nerve to ask for her number.

“Can I… maybe text you sometime?” I asked.

She smiled. “Yeah. I’d like that.”

I walked home grinning like an idiot, clutching a damp napkin with her number scribbled on it.

Over the next few weeks, we started meeting up sometimes for coffee, sometimes for dinner, sometimes just to walk around the city. It wasn’t dramatic or movie like. It was easy. Natural.

One night, months later, it started raining while we were walking home. I joked about her cursed umbrella, and she laughed. Then she said, “You know, I almost didn’t go to the café that day.”

I stopped walking. “Wait… I almost didn’t go either.”

We both stood there, realizing how easily we could’ve missed each other.

Fast forward to now: we’ve been together for over a year. That little café? It’s *our place* now. The barista even teases us about it when we walk in.

It’s crazy to think all of this her, us, everything started because I ran out of coffee on a rainy morning.

**A Follow-Up to The Recent Discussion about Clove** *(Syzygium aromaticum)*

Greeting my friends, 

After the discussion about clove recently, I wanted to dive into another antifungal powerhouse spice, this time: **cinnamon**. This spice isn’t just a sweet, warming flavour for your coffee or baked treat—it’s actually quite a potent medicinal spice with some serious health benefits, especially when it comes to Candida overgrowth.

This post represents just a little bit of information about cinnamon. I condensed a post I put up on [candida.com](http://candida.com), it's from a series of 13 in-depth articles all about the best natural antifungals . If you to like to dive deeper into topics like me and want to know a lot more about cinnamon (and the best natural antifungals) - visit this page: [https://candida.com/cinnamon-antifungal-antibacterial-anticandida/](https://candida.com/cinnamon-antifungal-antibacterial-anticandida/)

# Why Cinnamon Matters

Cinnamon has been used medicinally for thousands of years. Modern research confirms what traditional medicine has known: it’s **antifungal, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant-rich**. That means it can help support immune health, balance blood sugar, and even fight infections caused by harmful microbes—including Candida albicans.

# True Cinnamon vs. Cassia

There are two main types:

* **Ceylon (“true”) cinnamon** – sweeter, milder, and contains **cinnamaldehyde, cinnamyl alcohol, and cinnamyl acetate**, which are linked to stronger antifungal and antibacterial effects.
* **Cassia cinnamon** – the common supermarket variety, stronger taste, higher coumarin content (can be harmful in large doses). Most people will be consuming cassia, not true cinnamon.

If you’re focusing on Candida or long-term health benefits, Ceylon cinnamon is the way to go. It's the one I use and recommend, but it's a bit pricier.

# Cinnamon vs. Candida

Research shows cinnamon can:

* **Prevent Candida growth** in the gut and mouth
* **Support immune function** by protecting intestinal lining and reducing dysbiosis
* **Regulate blood sugar**, which is crucial because high blood sugar can fuel Candida overgrowth
* **Combat inflammation**, reducing joint pain, digestive discomfort, and Candida-related inflammation

Some studies even suggest **oral cinnamon capsules outperform prescribed cream** in managing vaginal Candida infections. Pretty impressive for a humble spice.

# Antimicrobial Power

Cinnamon isn’t just antifungal—it’s **broad-spectrum antimicrobial**. Its essential oils can help fight bacteria and viruses, and historically it’s been used across cultures to manage infections naturally.

**How to Use Cinnamon on a Candida-Friendly Diet**

* Sprinkle into **coffee, tea, or turmeric lattes**
* Mix into **yogurt, smoothies, or oatmeal**
* Roast fresh nuts with cinnamon
* Add to **baking** (low-sugar recipes) or savoury dishes like **curries and stew**

* Use **Ceylon cinnamon sticks or powder** for maximum benefit

**Moderation Is Key**

Cinnamon is safe in reasonable amounts. Stick to **Ceylon cinnamon** for medicinal use, for regular use, use cassia, and don’t overdo cassia due to **coumarin**, which can harm the liver in large amounts.

Cinnamon is one of those rare spices that tastes amazing **and** packs real medicinal value. If you’re working on Candida overgrowth or just want to boost your gut and immune health naturally, adding Ceylon cinnamon to your routine is a smart, tasty step.

This page is **Cosmic Coffee,** a space to sit with the stars like old friends. Not prophecy, not fortune-telling. Just reflection.

For me, astrology works like a mirror.  
It shows us three things:

* **Our hunger** → what we’re restlessly chasing.
* **Our blind spots** → the loops we fall into.
* **Our clean path forward** → how to move awake, not on autopilot.

Every week, I’ll share reflections - short and strong, like sips of coffee:

1. **Career & Growth** → your work identity, timing, and opportunities.
2. **Addiction & Loops** → the patterns that drain you, and how to notice them.
3. **Awareness** → the practice of living awake through your chart.

I’m not a guru, I’m a student. This page is my practice. Sharing helps me learn, and maybe it gives you clarity too.

If what I share resonates, you can:

* Join in the weekly reflections.
* DM for a structured **Career SWOT + Awareness Alignment session.**
* Or, if you’d simply like to support, there’s a link in my bio. Never expected, always appreciated. You can also support me by contributing for the courses I take from reputed astrologers to learn more and offer better insights ( Details in the link shared )

That time, Shinichi was playing football and broke a pipe, causing it to leak, Hagiwara stuffed a baseball there to stop the leaking. Matsuda told Shinichi and Ran that if there is any problem, they can tell him, where Matsuda referred himself as ""police."" This caused Shinichi to said that Matsuda isn't technically a police yet.

Then Furuya came, and Matsuda asked again, so Shinichi finally confessed that there is a haunted house. After solving the case and blah blah blah, they found out that there are people illegally growing drugs/cannabis in the house, which led to Furuya and his friends featured in a report, and on the news. Now in this scene, there is a picture of Hiromitsu wearing a bag that is very similar to the one he wear while he was in the organization (the sniper one)

So this might be a problem, since Rum's left eye can remember everything about one person, Rum mights have seen Hiro like that and compare it to Hiro in the organization, despite that Hiro grew a beard, which might eventually be the cause of Hiro's exposure of identity.

Like he didn’t want to be there with me anymore. So I just felt down. I expressed this and we talked it over. But idk my vibe was just really down and quiet rest of the ride. 

When we got home, he was helping me just load stuff into my car. He told me “you really need to control your emotions” so I kinda got upset about how he has no idea how hard it is to maintain a good mood allllll the time. 95% of the time I’m super positive and happy. I always try to find at least one positive thing in every situation. It has really helped my mindset. 

There is still that 5% of the time tho that I just can’t. So i was trying to express that to him. Felt like vacay was over because all the stress from life settled back in before we even had to leave. 

We were supposed to sign a short term lease together at my current apartment after we got back. He handed me his keys to the place and I was just like “is this really how you want to leave it?” And he didn’t say anything so I said ok. 


He immediately was regretting it after I left. But I saw this as him dumping me. My previous relationship was very back and forth so that a tender subject for me. 


I really have respect for myself and know what i deserve to be treated better than previously… I’ve never had such a great connection and felt so secure in a relationship. Until he did that. 

I love him so much and really see this being it… so that did blindside me a bit. I think his last relationship was also back and forth a lot. 

How should I proceed with this. I want to make it clear this cannot be a thing…. Will it always be that way???

He saw a therapist that same day. Which he never does. So it clearly bothered him. Last things I texted him were

“ I’m independent af. I care about you but I care about myself more…”

“I refuse to be dumped and let you have me back immediately. You can fucking wait you did this shit. “

I’m sad. I want to be with him… but there is no way this can be a thing… help",2,1758097721.0,Breakupadvice,0,1.0,False

Seraphina’s POV 1

I dragged myself down the cobblestone path. My body ached. My feet hurt. But my heart was singing.

“Just a few more hours,” I whispered. “Until tonight.”

Tonight was everything. No more going back to that house. No more pretending they were family.

I’d already asked for time off work. My boss spat at me. Called me lazy. Typical. Omegas always got the worst treatment.

But I didn’t care tonight.

I was going to Gabriel’s. My boyfriend. Soon-to-be fiancé.

Tomorrow was the Lunar Assembly. Sacred ceremony. Wolves finding their mates under the Moon Goddess. Tomorrow was also my

eighteenth birthday. Finally old enough.

Gabriel promised we’d bond tomorrow. I could escape forever.

Gabriel. Rich. Gorgeous. An Alpha’s brother. Sure, I was just an omega. But Gabriel said bloodlines didn’t matter. Love mattered.

I practically skipped toward his house. My heart hammered with excitement. Beautiful stone building in the center of town. So much

better than our pathetic wooden shack. Soon I’d live here. With Gabriel. Forever.

I knocked eagerly.

Nothing.

My smile faltered. That’s… odd. Gabriel said he’d be waiting. He promised.

I tried the handle. Unlocked. Relief flooded through me. He must be inside. Maybe preparing a surprise?

“Gabriel? It’s me!” I called out cheerfully.

Silence.

Wait. What was that? Sounds from upstairs. My heart lifted again. He was home after all.

Then I heard it clearly.

Laughter.

Female laughter.

Moaning.

My world stopped spinning. No. No, that couldn’t be-

The sounds grew louder. Clearer. Destroying me with every breath.

Gasps. Bed springs creaking. A voice that made my soul shatter.

“Oh God, Gabriel… right there…”

Valerie. My stepsister.

My brain refused to process it. This wasn’t happening. This was a nightmare. I’d wake up any second.

The bedroom door hung slightly open. Like a cruel invitation to witness my destruction. I saw them.

Gabriel’s muscled back. Moving. Valerie’s pale body beneath him. Her golden hair fanned across his pillow like a victory flag.

No no no no no.

“You feel so much better than I imagined,” Gabriel panted.

My heart exploded into a thousand pieces. Each word was a dagger.

Valerie laughed. That cruel, sharp sound I knew so well. “Better than that pathetic omega sister of mine, I bet. Poor little Sera probably

doesn’t even know what to do with a real man.”

The air left my lungs. I couldn’t breathe. Couldn’t think. Could only feel the agony ripping through my chest.

“Don’t.” Gabriel’s voice was rough. “Don’t mention her when we’re like this.”

“Why not?” Valerie’s fingers traced his spine like she owned him. “After tomorrow, she’ll know exactly where she stands. An omega like

her could never satisfy you.”

Each word was a physical blow. I stumbled backward, gasping for air. My shoulder slammed into the wall. The sound echoed like a

gunshot.

“What was that?” Valerie hissed.

My wolf surged forward. Rage I’d never felt before. My foot connected with the door. It crashed against the wall.

“WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?”

They jumped apart. Gabriel nearly fell off the bed scrambling for his pants. Valerie just sat up. Didn’t even cover herself.

“Seraphina!” Gabriel went white. “I can explain-”

“Explain?” My voice cracked. “Explain how you’re screwing my sister?”

“It’s not what you

think-”

“IT’S EXACTLY WHAT I THINK!” Tears streamed down my face. “You lying, cheating bastard!”

Valerie stretched. Finally reached for Gabriel’s shirt. “Oh, sister dear. You really thought he’d choose you?” She tilted her head. Mock

sympathy. “How cute.”

“Valerie, don’t,” Gabriel warned. But his voice was weak.

“Don’t what? Tell her the truth?” Valerie stood up slowly. “That Mom and Dad have known about us for months? That they practically threw me at Gabriel because they were embarrassed by their precious Alpha family being tied to an omega reject?”

The world spun. “You’re lying.”

“Am I?” Valerie moved to the mirror. Ran her fingers through her hair. “Why don’t you go home and ask them? I’m sure they’re waiting.

Probably with our engagement announcement.”

“Sera, listen-” Gabriel finally got his pants on. “This doesn’t have to change anything between us. We can still be friends-”

“FRIENDS?” I lunged toward him. He caught my wrists.

“You need to calm down,” he said. His grip was tight. Bruising. “Think about your position. Your family. You don’t want to make this

worse.”

I stared into his eyes. Eyes that had whispered promises just days ago. Now they were cold. Calculating.

“Let go of me,” I whispered.

“Sera-”

“LET GO OF ME!”

I wrenched free and ran. I burst through our front door. Victor and Elizabeth sat calmly in the living room. An elegant invitation lay on

the coffee table between them.

They showed no surprise at my tear-stained face.

“You already knew?” My voice was barely a whisper.

“Seraphina, sit down.” Victor’s voice was ice. “Yes, we know about Gabriel and Valerie. We fully support it.”

Elizabeth picked up the invitation. Held it out. “This is their engagement announcement. Tomorrow at the Lunar Assembly, Gabriel will

propose to Valerie. They hope you’ll attend as Valerie’s sister.”

I stared at the beautiful invitation. Gabriel and Valerie’s names in gold. The silver Nightshadow crest. It was all real.

“Why?” My voice cracked. “Why would you do this to me?”

“Enough!” Victor shot to his feet. Backhanded me across the face. Hard. I crashed to the floor. My cheek burned.

“You’re nothing but an abandoned child we took in out of pity. What right do you have to insult our daughter?”

“You should be grateful we raised you.” Elizabeth’s voice was cold. “Now you know your place. Tomorrow you’ll bless your sister’s

engagement. Then find yourself a suitable omega mate.”

“I won’t!” I struggled to my feet. Tasted blood. “I’ll never bless this betrayal!”

Victor raised his hand again. This time I was ready. I dodged and ran for the door.

“Get out of our house!” Elizabeth shrieked behind me. “Ungrateful little brat!”

I fled into the night. Running blindly. Tears falling like broken pearls.

I didn’t know where I was going; I only knew I couldn’t stop moving or the crushing pain would swallow me whole. I didn’t know how

long I ran, but eventually I found myself on Main Street when a familiar voice made me stop.

“Sera!”

I spun around to see Ophelia running toward me, her dark hair flying behind her.

“I saw you run in-what happened? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

“Worse.” I collapsed into her arms. “I’ve seen the truth.”

“Tell me.”

So I did. Every horrible detail, every cruel word. Ophelia held me while I shook.

“Those bastards,” she hissed when I finished. “All of them. Gabriel, Valerie, your so-called parents.”

“What am I going to do?” I cried against her shoulder. “Tomorrow is the Lunar Assembly. Everyone will see Gabriel and Valerie’s

engagement. I’ll be the laughingstock of the entire pack.”

“Listen to me, Sera.” Ophelia stroked my hair gently. “We’re not waiting for that damned ceremony. Tonight, we’re going to Silver Moon

Harbor!”

“What?” I pulled back to look at her, still having tears on my face.

“I heard there’s a huge party in Silver Moon Harbor tonight. Lots of wolves from other packs who are here for tomorrow’s ceremony will be there.” Ophelia’s eyes sparkled with excitement. “We’re going to have some fun and forget all about these bastards and your heartless

family!”

“But… but I…” I hesitated. As an omega, Silver Moon Harbor was completely foreign territory to me.

“But what?” Ophelia gripped my hands. “Sera, you’ve lost everything here. Instead of staying to be humiliated tomorrow, let’s go to Silver

Moon Harbor and try our luck. Maybe you’ll meet your real destined mate-someone who won’t give a damn about your bloodline.”

I looked into Ophelia’s determined eyes, thinking about the cruel words I’d heard in Gabriel’s bedroom, remembering my parents’ cold

faces, imagining the humiliation I’d face tomorrow…

“Okay.” I wiped away my tears, feeling a fierce courage I’d never experienced before. “Let’s go to Silver Moon Harbor tonight. Let all those

people go to hell!”

Ophelia grinned with delight. “Now that’s my Seraphina! Come on, let’s go back to my place and get ready. Tonight, we’re going to show the most beautiful girl!”",1,1758097465.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

1nj7ega,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1nj7ega/mil_asking_to_see_newborn/,MIL asking to see newborn,"More details are in my post history, but in summary a year ago Mil threw her toys out the pram because DH tried to explain to her that for now we were not comfortable with her babysitting/taking our toddler off unsupervised. Her response was she wouldn't bother having a relationship with our LO if she can't take them off on her own. 
She also questioned whether we were decent parents and has admitted that she believes she can do whatever she likes when it comes to her grandchildren.
I decided I wouldn't be in contact with Mil until she apologised and agreed to be respectful of our parenting choices, which she will not do, she'd rather rug sweep.

LO2 was born four weeks ago. DH tells me his mother is asking to meet our newborn. I asked what his reply was & he told her he'd ask me (eye roll). I said ""why does she want to meet the new baby when she hasn't made an effort with our old baby"" (as in our now 3yo).
I told him if he really wants to do that he can take the baby & meet Mil at the local coffee shop as I dont want her in our home. 

DH's granddad recently passed away so eventhough he was LC with his mother & then eventually NC with her for the last few month they had been communicating in regards to the funeral arrangements.

I know DH has a lot to figure out & I'm sure the passing of his grandad has altered his perspective a bit. But I know Mil is likely thinking this is a great chance to rug sweep and also get her photo op with her new grandchild so she doesn't look bad to family and friends when they ask about the new arrival.
 
I wish DH would have more conviction and tell his mother no, as she doesn't respect him and is not supportive of him at all.  Her entitlement & the way she has spoken to him in the past year has been disgusting. 

Ive told DH he can have whatever relationship he wants with his mother but I will not engage with her & our children wont be around her unless the issues are discussed and she apologises.

I do feel like i've maybe given in too easily, But I'm pissed off and tired because sometimes it feels like im the only one holding the line when it comes to Mil because DH has been conditioned to just accept her behaviour and move on without question.",33,1758097307.0,JUSTNOMIL,12,0.87,False

“It’s not what you

think-”

“IT’S EXACTLY WHAT I THINK!” Tears streamed down my face. “You lying, cheating bastard!”

Valerie stretched. Finally reached for Gabriel’s shirt. “Oh, sister dear. You really thought he’d choose you?” She tilted her head. Mock

sympathy. “How cute.”

“Valerie, don’t,” Gabriel warned. But his voice was weak.

“Don’t what? Tell her the truth?” Valerie stood up slowly. “That Mom and Dad have known about us for months? That they practically threw me at Gabriel because they were embarrassed by their precious Alpha family being tied to an omega reject?”

The world spun. “You’re lying.”

“Am I?” Valerie moved to the mirror. Ran her fingers through her hair. “Why don’t you go home and ask them? I’m sure they’re waiting.

Probably with our engagement announcement.”

“Sera, listen-” Gabriel finally got his pants on. “This doesn’t have to change anything between us. We can still be friends-”

“FRIENDS?” I lunged toward him. He caught my wrists.

“You need to calm down,” he said. His grip was tight. Bruising. “Think about your position. Your family. You don’t want to make this

worse.”

I stared into his eyes. Eyes that had whispered promises just days ago. Now they were cold. Calculating.

“Let go of me,” I whispered.

“Sera-”

“LET GO OF ME!”

I wrenched free and ran. I burst through our front door. Victor and Elizabeth sat calmly in the living room. An elegant invitation lay on

the coffee table between them.

They showed no surprise at my tear-stained face.

“You already knew?” My voice was barely a whisper.

“Seraphina, sit down.” Victor’s voice was ice. “Yes, we know about Gabriel and Valerie. We fully support it.”

Elizabeth picked up the invitation. Held it out. “This is their engagement announcement. Tomorrow at the Lunar Assembly, Gabriel will

propose to Valerie. They hope you’ll attend as Valerie’s sister.”

I stared at the beautiful invitation. Gabriel and Valerie’s names in gold. The silver Nightshadow crest. It was all real.

“Why?” My voice cracked. “Why would you do this to me?”

“Enough!” Victor shot to his feet. Backhanded me across the face. Hard. I crashed to the floor. My cheek burned.

“You’re nothing but an abandoned child we took in out of pity. What right do you have to insult our daughter?”

“You should be grateful we raised you.” Elizabeth’s voice was cold. “Now you know your place. Tomorrow you’ll bless your sister’s

engagement. Then find yourself a suitable omega mate.”

“I won’t!” I struggled to my feet. Tasted blood. “I’ll never bless this betrayal!”

Victor raised his hand again. This time I was ready. I dodged and ran for the door.

“Get out of our house!” Elizabeth shrieked behind me. “Ungrateful little brat!”

I fled into the night. Running blindly. Tears falling like broken pearls.

I didn’t know where I was going; I only knew I couldn’t stop moving or the crushing pain would swallow me whole. I didn’t know how

long I ran, but eventually I found myself on Main Street when a familiar voice made me stop.

“Sera!”

I spun around to see Ophelia running toward me, her dark hair flying behind her.

“I saw you run in-what happened? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

“Worse.” I collapsed into her arms. “I’ve seen the truth.”

“Tell me.”

So I did. Every horrible detail, every cruel word. Ophelia held me while I shook.

“Those bastards,” she hissed when I finished. “All of them. Gabriel, Valerie, your so-called parents.”

“What am I going to do?” I cried against her shoulder. “Tomorrow is the Lunar Assembly. Everyone will see Gabriel and Valerie’s

engagement. I’ll be the laughingstock of the entire pack.”

“Listen to me, Sera.” Ophelia stroked my hair gently. “We’re not waiting for that damned ceremony. Tonight, we’re going to Silver Moon

Harbor!”

“What?” I pulled back to look at her, still having tears on my face.

“I heard there’s a huge party in Silver Moon Harbor tonight. Lots of wolves from other packs who are here for tomorrow’s ceremony will be there.” Ophelia’s eyes sparkled with excitement. “We’re going to have some fun and forget all about these bastards and your heartless

family!”

“But… but I…” I hesitated. As an omega, Silver Moon Harbor was completely foreign territory to me.

“But what?” Ophelia gripped my hands. “Sera, you’ve lost everything here. Instead of staying to be humiliated tomorrow, let’s go to Silver

Moon Harbor and try our luck. Maybe you’ll meet your real destined mate-someone who won’t give a damn about your bloodline.”

I looked into Ophelia’s determined eyes, thinking about the cruel words I’d heard in Gabriel’s bedroom, remembering my parents’ cold

faces, imagining the humiliation I’d face tomorrow…

“Okay.” I wiped away my tears, feeling a fierce courage I’d never experienced before. “Let’s go to Silver Moon Harbor tonight. Let all those

people go to hell!”

Ophelia grinned with delight. “Now that’s my Seraphina! Come on, let’s go back to my place and get ready. Tonight, we’re going to show the most beautiful girl!”",1,1758097287.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

Seraphina’s POV 1

I dragged myself down the cobblestone path. My body ached. My feet hurt. But my heart was singing.

“Just a few more hours,” I whispered. “Until tonight.”

Tonight was everything. No more going back to that house. No more pretending they were family.

I’d already asked for time off work. My boss spat at me. Called me lazy. Typical. Omegas always got the worst treatment.

But I didn’t care tonight.

I was going to Gabriel’s. My boyfriend. Soon-to-be fiancé.

Tomorrow was the Lunar Assembly. Sacred ceremony. Wolves finding their mates under the Moon Goddess. Tomorrow was also my

eighteenth birthday. Finally old enough.

Gabriel promised we’d bond tomorrow. I could escape forever.

Gabriel. Rich. Gorgeous. An Alpha’s brother. Sure, I was just an omega. But Gabriel said bloodlines didn’t matter. Love mattered.

I practically skipped toward his house. My heart hammered with excitement. Beautiful stone building in the center of town. So much

better than our pathetic wooden shack. Soon I’d live here. With Gabriel. Forever.

I knocked eagerly.

Nothing.

My smile faltered. That’s… odd. Gabriel said he’d be waiting. He promised.

I tried the handle. Unlocked. Relief flooded through me. He must be inside. Maybe preparing a surprise?

“Gabriel? It’s me!” I called out cheerfully.

Silence.

Wait. What was that? Sounds from upstairs. My heart lifted again. He was home after all.

Then I heard it clearly.

Laughter.

Female laughter.

Moaning.

My world stopped spinning. No. No, that couldn’t be-

The sounds grew louder. Clearer. Destroying me with every breath.

Gasps. Bed springs creaking. A voice that made my soul shatter.

“Oh God, Gabriel… right there…”

Valerie. My stepsister.

My brain refused to process it. This wasn’t happening. This was a nightmare. I’d wake up any second.

The bedroom door hung slightly open. Like a cruel invitation to witness my destruction. I saw them.

Gabriel’s muscled back. Moving. Valerie’s pale body beneath him. Her golden hair fanned across his pillow like a victory flag.

No no no no no.

“You feel so much better than I imagined,” Gabriel panted.

My heart exploded into a thousand pieces. Each word was a dagger.

Valerie laughed. That cruel, sharp sound I knew so well. “Better than that pathetic omega sister of mine, I bet. Poor little Sera probably

doesn’t even know what to do with a real man.”

The air left my lungs. I couldn’t breathe. Couldn’t think. Could only feel the agony ripping through my chest.

“Don’t.” Gabriel’s voice was rough. “Don’t mention her when we’re like this.”

“Why not?” Valerie’s fingers traced his spine like she owned him. “After tomorrow, she’ll know exactly where she stands. An omega like

her could never satisfy you.”

Each word was a physical blow. I stumbled backward, gasping for air. My shoulder slammed into the wall. The sound echoed like a

gunshot.

“What was that?” Valerie hissed.

My wolf surged forward. Rage I’d never felt before. My foot connected with the door. It crashed against the wall.

“WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?”

They jumped apart. Gabriel nearly fell off the bed scrambling for his pants. Valerie just sat up. Didn’t even cover herself.

“Seraphina!” Gabriel went white. “I can explain-”

“Explain?” My voice cracked. “Explain how you’re screwing my sister?”

“It’s not what you

think-”

“IT’S EXACTLY WHAT I THINK!” Tears streamed down my face. “You lying, cheating bastard!”

1nj7dan,https://www.reddit.com/r/GOPayments/comments/1nj7dan/hey_everyone_gopayments_is_launching_a_new/,Hey everyone — GOPayments is launching a new Donation feature + how it can help creators & nonprofits 💡,"Hi Redditors,

I’m excited to share something cool: GOPayments is rolling out a **Donation feature** designed to make giving easier — whether you’re a content creator, nonprofit, streamer, church, or anyone wanting to accept support from followers.

  
Here’s what the Donation feature is, what you get, and why it might matter to you.



# What is GOPayments Donation

The Donation feature is an add-on that lets people accept **donations** through GOPayments with simple tools (links, buttons etc.). No heavy tech setup, no needing to build custom payment flows. It’s built for anyone who wants to receive financial support online in a clean & user-friendly way.



# Key Features / Benefits

Here are some of the things you’d get with GOPayments Donation:

* **Custom donation links / buttons** — Embed on websites/social media; personalize with your name/logo/description.
* **Auto-withdraw / payout options** — Donations move to your wallet (depending on how GOPayments does it), so you don’t have to manually pull them each time.
* **Notifications / webhooks** — Get real-time alerts when someone donates. Useful if you want to build dashboards or automate thank you messages.
* **Transparent fees** — Clear transaction fees, so donors and you know how much of the donation goes through.
* **Reporting / history** — Track who donated, when, how much, for what campaign etc.



# Why this matters

* **Lower friction** — People are more likely to donate if it’s simple. A button + a few taps beats lots of forms.
* **Global reach** — Donations can come from anywhere, depending on supported payment methods / currencies.
* **Support communities & creators** — For streamers, artists, open source devs, nonprofits: a way to monetize goodwill.
* **Better tracking** — No guessing; you can see what works, what doesn’t, how donations are flowing.



# Things to consider / possible limitations

* **Fees and delays** — Even though GOPayments handles most of it, payment-processor fees and delays in settlement can eat into the proceeds.
* **Compliance & local laws** — Depending on your country, accepting donations may involve tax, disclosure, or accounting rules.
* **Currency conversion** — If donations come in non-local currency, the rate / conversion fee may matter.
* **Trust & transparency** — Especially for nonprofits, people want to see proof of where the money goes. Good receipts, clear messaging help.

# 

# Who this is good for

* Nonprofits / charities wanting to diversify donation channels
* Creators (YouTube, Twitch, blogs, social media) who have fans or audience willing to contribute
* Community projects / meetups / open source devs etc.
* Anyone wanting a simpler way to raise funds without going through big fundraising platforms



If you’re interested, I’d be happy to share how to set it up, share tips for maximizing donations, or compare this feature with others like Patreon / PayPal / Buy Me a Coffee.",1,1758097184.0,GOPayments,0,1.0,False

**What I’m looking for:**

Honestly, someone a little feminine (as society sees femininity). Empathetic, soft, friendly, maybe a bit talkative. I love listening to people yap about random shit. Someone who's not cold, nonchalant, or “mysterious.” That type seems cool in theory, but in reality, it’s the worst. I like genuinely good people who want better for themselves and the world. Like, if you got superpowers, you’d want to be Superman, not some cocky piece of shit. (And no, I’m not talking about Injustice Superman.)

---

**A little about me:**

I read. Mostly literature and deep, weird fiction (The Little Prince is wholesome chaos). I don’t read loads because my brain’s a mess sometimes.

I game.

I love music. Not just “my genre,” I actually dig good music across the board.

I like flowers, butterflies, pink skies, trees, grass, coffee, bikes, rain, poetry and literally everything pretty. Pretty architecture and all pretty shit.

I want to travel but I’m not rich yet.

I like baking/cooking in theory; no time to actually learn properly yet. 

Superheroes, psych-horror, mind-bending shows/games are my jam.

I follow chess even if I haven’t played in a while.

I love cats and normal stray dogs (big dangerous dogs freak me out). I like birds. I don’t like insects.

I’m very empathetic but also witty and chaotic. I flirt a lot (sorry not sorry). I had kinda wavy hair, but after my cat passed away last week, I shaved it into a buzzcut because I felt like shit. **I’m 19.**

---

Anyway, hit me up if you think we’d click. Worst case, we talk once and ghost each other like everyone else. Best case, I finally find someone who doesn’t make me wanna disappear mid-convo.

1nj7bpz,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThevariaRP/comments/1nj7bpz/the_next_grand_duke_of_waiddenz/,The Next Grand Duke of Waiddenz?,"**The Grand Duchy of Waiddenz**

The Grand Duchy of Waiddenz has the dubious distinction of having fought on both sides of the revolutionary wars, changing sides as the winds turned. For the early years they remained neutral, then nominally fought alongside the revolutionaries before later siding with the coalition against the lord protector.

Every Grand Duke of Waiddenz since 871 has been a descendent of Wenceslas III but it has not always been hereditary. Over the past two centuries the throne has been passed between several feuding houses back and forth. The remote and underdeveloped nature of Waiddenz only strengthened the power of local elites and made long term foreign occupation impractical. 


**The Old General**

Count Kubrat sipped his black coffee while sitting in his favourite chair. After returning from his spirited walk through the winding foothill paths of his estate, he liked to sit and read. His latest literary obsession was the Thevarian Emperor Augustus XV, otherwise known as Augustus the Great. 

His victory in the Thevarian War of Succession set Thevaria down the path of centralization and reform, doing away with many of the weaknesses that came with squabbling noble houses. A weakness he found most apparent in Waiddenz.

Kubrat had even gotten to know his distant successor, the late emperor Augustus XVI personally, or at very least through letters. Within a few months of Augustus’ passing, so too did his cousin, the Grand Duke of Waiddenz, presenting an opportunity.

With the election in the Council of Lords well underway, Kubrat knew one truth of his nation’s history, *Every Grand Duke had either risen to that rank through spineless appeasement of the houses or by being ruthless enough that all the others would fall in line…*

In his own time far more had been the former than the latter. *While I opposed the Lord Protector, they dithered and made excuses…* The next Grand Duke as he saw it, would likely be more of the same. Another weak monarch who would accomplish nothing. *Only with a strong leader does Waiddenz have any chance of survival…*

His train of thought was interrupted when he felt a little hand tug on his. 

“Grandpa?”

He looked down to see his four year old granddaughter, Dagmara. 

She continued with, “Can you play with me?”

After a lifetime of patriotic service, Kubrat knew what Waiddenz needed, but perhaps he was needed elsewhere? Closer to home. Maybe this was best left to a younger man?

Most people give AI a destination without an address. They ask it to ""write about marketing"" and then get angry when the result is a useless, generic NewsLesson. They are acting like a passenger, not a driver.

Follow me on [Substack ](https://jtnovelo2131.substack.com/)where I will continue my deep dives.

The frustration: ""The AI's answer is correct, but it's completely useless for my project.""

Think of it like a GPS. You wouldn't just type ""New York"" and expect it to navigate you to a specific coffee shop in Brooklyn. You provide the exact address. Your context—the who, what, where, why, and how of your request—is the address for your prompt. Without it, the AI is just guessing.

First course: ""Seeing Red""

- Traditionally known as ""Nicotine & Caffeine"" was served with black coffee. However the cold , crisp , and slightly chemical taste of Red Bull when paired alongside the smokey somber richness of a Marlboro Red is noticeably more contrasting and complex. Meant to stimulate the palate and mind, without leaving you to full-filled. Foreshadowing aside , we hope you enjoy ""Seeing Red"" as much as we do.


 Please feel free to add your courses/dishes /etc!  Would love to see what our collective fiendish brains can come up with. 

 Remember, this is just for kicks. Let's have a bit of fun, at our own expense!
