1p8noss,https://www.reddit.com/r/YouTubeEditorsForHire/comments/1p8noss/let_me_craft_your_footages_to_engaging_stories/,"""Let me craft your footages to engaging stories.""","Hi, I’m Colin, a freelance video editor who believes that editing isn’t just cutting clips, it’s crafting emotion, rhythm, and story out of chaos. 

I take those shaky shots, awkward pauses, and “we’ll fix it in post” moments and turn them into something people actually want to watch.

Whether it’s a brand story, YouTube video, documentary, or social media ad; I make sure your content doesn’t just exist… it engages. 

Think smooth transitions, color grading that pops, music that hits just right, and pacing that keeps viewers hooked till the end.

Here’s why working with me might just be the best decision since coffee was invented ☕

🎞️ I edit fast, but I never rush the art.

✅ I treat sound like a co-star (because nothing ruins magic faster than bad audio).

✅ I color grade like I’m painting feelings, not just frames.

✅ I actually listen to your vision (no ghosting, no ego, just collaboration).

And yes, I bring humor to the process,  because deadlines are easier to beat when we’re laughing.

I’ve worked with clients who wanted cinematic storytelling, others who needed scroll-stopping reels, and a few who just said “make this look cool”… and somehow, we nailed it every time.

So if your footage deserves more than basic trimming, if your brand needs that “wow” factor, or if you simply want your story told with style, let’s make it happen. 

My rates are $8 per minute.

Hey I’m Denise! I’m a pretty easy going and extroverted gal. I struggle to sit still and have a lot of different interests. I’m not much of a gamer. I love to travel and  explore new spots around town, especially coffee shops. I enjoy dancing, trying new restaurants,and watching sports in my free time. Recently started getting back into reading and would love some recommendations, especially for mystery, sci-fi or historical fiction! Looking to connect with kind , goal oriented and thoughtful people. SFW only please. Trying to avoid the creeps.

I’m a yapper. I love talking and I’m a pretty good listener. HMU if you think we might have something in common. Might be up for a voice call if we click ☺️☕️ Pics on profile

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

If you've ever had to rewatch an entire Teams recording just to catch one missed update, you know the pain. Transcripts aren’t much better either- endless scrolling, hoping the search lands on the right line. It's draining. But now, you don’t have to spend time on any of that. 

With audio recap, instead of watching recordings or digging through transcripts, you get a concise podcast-style audio summary of everything discussed in the meeting. Just hit play and listen like you would any normal podcast - while walking, driving, having coffee… whatever works.

And the cool part? You can **combine up to 8 meetings into a single audio recap**. So instead of sitting through hours of back-to-back calls you missed, you get a quick digest of decisions, action items, and key highlights.

Some perks so far:

* Super useful when you’re away from your desk
* Lets you choose the narration style (Executive, Newscast, Casual)
* Works on mobile, which is the whole point

The only catch: Transcription must be enabled. No transcript = no audio recap.

 

Honestly, this feels like one of those features that should have existed years ago. But now it is finally here!",1,1764310330.0,MicrosoftTeams,0,1.0,False

1p8nj8u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stockxy/comments/1p8nj8u/why_i_built_stockxy_a_love_letter_to_slow/,Why I Built Stockxy: A Love Letter to Slow Investing,"Three years ago, I made a mistake that every value investor eventually makes.

I had bought a tech stock (let's call it Company X) after weeks of deep research. I had a 3,000-word thesis written in Notion. I had a DCF model in Excel showing it was 40% undervalued. I was convinced.

Six months later, the stock dropped 25%.

Panic set in. The market narrative had shifted from ""Growth"" to ""Inflation fears."" I looked at the red numbers in my brokerage app, felt the fear in my stomach, and sold at the bottom.

Two weeks later, the stock rebounded.

When I went back to do a ""post-mortem"" on why I sold, I realized something painful: **I had forgotten my own thesis.**

I had forgotten that in my original Notion note, I had explicitly written: *""This stock will be volatile due to rate hikes, but the core cloud revenue is sticky.""*

The problem wasn't my analysis. The problem was my **memory**. My ""Logic"" was trapped in a static text document (Notion), while my ""Fear"" was staring at a dynamic red chart (Yahoo Finance). **Because these two worlds were separated, fear won.**

That was the moment Stockxy was born.

 

# The ""Fragmented"" Investor

If you are a serious investor, your desktop probably looks like mine used to:

1. **Excel/Google Sheets:** For the math (DCF, PE ratios).
2. **Notion/Evernote:** For the words (Earnings reviews, thoughts).
3. **TradingView/Yahoo:** For the pictures (Charts, price action).

https://preview.redd.it/clrg13owvx3g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf78f2fee21084a7e1ebd15f0f6c77dca3eb4f50

We spend our lives Alt-Tabbing between these three.

* Excel is powerful but manual. (How many times have you forgotten to update the current price?)
* Notion is beautiful but blind. (It doesn't know where the price was when you wrote that note.)
* Trading tools are loud and noisy.

I realized that **Value Investing is a ""Context"" game.** When you look at a K-Line chart from 2 years ago, you see the price, but you don't see *your mind*. You don't see what you were thinking at that specific peak or trough.

I needed a tool that could **pin my thoughts directly onto the chart**.

https://preview.redd.it/h3jljatxvx3g1.png?width=769&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e735ac989c6a452be27a32043e2bb55831a0f73

# Why Not Just Use ""Trader"" Tools?

I tried them all. TraderVue, TradeZella, Edgewonk.

They are incredible pieces of software—if you are a Day Trader. They screamed at me with ""Heatmaps,"" ""Win Rates,"" and ""Best Hour of the Day to Trade.""

But I am a value investor.

* I don't care about my ""Win Rate"" on Tuesdays.
* I care about whether my thesis on ""Management Capital Allocation"" played out over 3 years.
* I don't need to track ""Slippage.""
* I need to track ""Conviction.""

I realized there was a gap in the market. There were a million tools for **Traders** (who execute fast), but almost nothing for **Investors** (who think slow).

 

# The Philosophy: Intellectual Honesty

In `AboutPage`, I talk about **""Intellectual Honesty.""** This is the core DNA of Stockxy.

We lie to ourselves all the time. *""I'm buying this for the long term,""* we say, while secretly hoping for a quick earnings pop.

Stockxy is designed to keep you honest. When you write a journal entry, you tag it with a Sentiment (**Bullish/Bearish**) and a Rationale. The app stamps this onto the chart forever.

Six months later, you can't hide. You look at the chart, see the flag, click it, and read exactly what you were thinking.

* Did you buy because of fundamentals?
* Or did you FOMO in at the top?

The chart doesn't lie. And now, thanks to Stockxy, your journal won't let you lie either.

 

# Building for ""The Rest of Us""

I am a Product Manager and Developer by trade. I built Stockxy on weekends, late at night, fueled by coffee and the desire to fix my own messy workflow.

I chose a tech stack that I love (React, PocketBase) to keep it fast, lightweight, and private.

* **Privacy First:** I’m an indie developer, not a hedge fund. Your data is yours.
* **Automation:** I connected it to Yahoo Finance so I never have to manually type a stock price into a spreadsheet again.
* **Simplicity:** I stripped away everything that wasn't essential. No social feeds, no news noise, no ""hot stock tips."" Just your portfolio, your charts, and your thoughts.

 

# The Vision: A Sanctuary for Deep Thinking

In a world of TikTok finance and 15-second attention spans, Value Investing feels like a lost art. It requires patience, deep reading, and structured thinking.

I want Stockxy to be your **Sanctuary**. A quiet place where you can shut out the market noise, sit down with your thoughts, and build a compounding machine—not just of wealth, but of wisdom.

https://preview.redd.it/y1wdgbuzvx3g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4bf7afd7b8041f6e2492c8d13d7f34fb3690aa4

If you are tired of fragmented tools and ""Thesis Amnesia,"" I invite you to try Stockxy. It’s the tool I built for myself, but I think it might be the tool you’ve been looking for too.

Chapter 1 

For six years, Isabella Garcia loved her husband, Joseph Ashford. But out of the blue, he was struck by a strange illness—and the cure? He had to sleep with another woman ninety-nine times. 

The Ashford family has a century-old family creed: the head of the family must not marry a woman of humble birth. 

But Joseph defied tradition. He burned the ancestral tablets to marry Isabella, a pearl diver, adding her to the family tree overnight and rushing into their wedding the very next day.
For five years, he spoiled her, making her the most envied woman in Coastal Harbor.
But in the sixth year, Joseph was struck by a strange illness and fell into a coma. 

A mysterious master claimed it was an ancestral punishment. The only way to lift it was through a ritual marriage—where Joseph had to sleep with a ritual bride, Sophia Miller, ninety-nine times or fall into a coma again. 

From then on, Joseph slept with Sophia every night, telling Isabella to wait. 

Isabella could only kneel and pray for him, listening tearfully as he was intimate with another woman.
After seven days of kneeling, she returned home with a protective charm. Just as she was about to open the door, she overheard a conversation between Joseph and his friends. 

***** 

""Joseph, you're a genius. Faking an illness and making up a ritual marriage just to openly bring your little lover home to fool around.""
""Only someone from a humble background like Isabella would believe it. Everyone in Coastal Harbor know that our Joseph fears nothing, not even burning the ancestral memorial tablets? How could he possibly believe in some master and a ritual marriage?""
The blood in Isabella's body seemed to reverse its flow.
So Joseph wasn't sick at all; this was all his scheme! 

The protective charm clutched tightly in her hand suddenly felt scorching hot, as if it would burn right through her palm. 

His friend couldn't help but ask curiously: ""Joseph, you've slept with Sophia 90 times, right? Just 9 more times and the ritual marriage will be over. What are you planning to do then..."" 

Joseph leaned back on the sofa, his black shirt unbuttoned by two, his long legs crossed. 

He took a light sip of his drink and curled his lip nonchalantly: ""When it's over, I'll just keep her on the side."" 

Standing outside the door, Isabella felt a chill that pierced her to the bone. 

But his friends just laughed louder: ""We told you—men like us all have someone on the side. Don't be so naive.
You've been faithful to Isabella for five years, you've done right by her."" 

""A woman like Sophia, who looks innocent but has a wild side and no inhibitions in bed, is such a turn-on for men."" 

""By the way, Joseph, isn't she much more fun than Isabella?""
The glass slammed heavily on the table, and Joseph's drunken eyes suddenly turned sharp.
""No one can compare to Isabella. She will always be the one I love the most."" 

Everyone was stunned. 

After a long moment, a friend couldn't help but speak up, asking a question Isabella also desperately wanted to know: ""Joseph, if you love her, how could you bear to make her suffer by faking an illness?
I heard the Ashford family has given her a hard time these past three months, and Madam Ashford almost subjected her to family disciplinary punishment..."" 

The air was silent for a few seconds. 

Then, Joseph's deep voice came through— 

""The Ashford family is a clan with a hundred years of prestige. To enter my family, even the daughter from an old money family must undergo a test to prove her loyalty.
Back then, I made an exception and didn't make Isabella go through this formality, and the family has always had objections."" 

""Now, I'm using this ritual marriage affair to make up for it.""
She doesn't even fight or make a scene when I sleep with someone else, and even sincerely prays for me.” 

“That shows she's obedient and submissive enough, worthy of being part of the Ashford family.”
He let out a soft chuckle, his voice laced with a self-righteous tenderness: “As for the suffering she's endured for me, I'll make it up to her with a lifetime of devotion.” 

Those words pierced Isabella's heart like needles. 

She suddenly laughed.
As she laughed, tears streamed down her cheeks. 

Everyone in the Ashford family said that because she insisted on marrying into the family, Joseph was struck down by an ancestral punishment and fell ill.
For the past three months, she had lived every day amidst insults and condemnation. 

During the first few days of Joseph's coma, she was so heartbroken and cried so violently that she nearly lost sight in her right eye. She also developed a chronic ache in her heart, lying awake night after night.
When he was in bed with Sophia, she was kneeling before a cross, reciting the Rosary again and again, refusing to stop even when her fingers were rubbed raw and bleeding...
But it turned out... all of it was a lie! 

The ridiculous rules of a century-old prestigious family, the so-called necessary test of loyalty...
All of it was just a grand-sounding excuse! 

In essence, he just wanted to have his affair without restraint, while avoiding the judgment of his former self. 

Tears blurred Isabella's vision. She didn't understand how things had come to this. 

Joseph... he had loved her so genuinely, so clearly. 

Back then, to pay for her mother's medical treatments, she had given up college and started diving for pearls to earn money. It was then she'd accidentally saved Joseph, who had been seriously injured and fallen into the sea while being pursued. 

She took him home and cared for him for a month. To her surprise, Joseph fell madly in love with her and began to pursue her with passionate intensity. 

She didn't believe in true love from a wealthy family and rejected him time and again. But he was relentlessly persistent, refusing to give up, using all his patience and gentleness to slowly melt her frozen heart. 

What truly won her over was when Joseph shielded her from the sulfuric acid a competitor threw at her. A hideous scar was burned across his back, and though he was drenched in a cold sweat from the pain, he smiled and wiped away her tears: “As long as you're okay, that's all that matters.”
At their wedding, he knelt on one knee, held her hand, and vowed: “Isabella, I will love only you for the rest of my life. I will never let you suffer even the slightest bit of wrong.” 

The words still echoed in her ears, now a bitter irony. 

Isabella's tears had run dry, but the chatter and laughter in the living room continued. 

Suddenly, someone sighed. “Joseph, Isabella has been Mrs. Ashford for five years. She's no fool. Aren't you afraid that if she finds out about Sophia... she'll leave you?”
Joseph was silent for a moment, his Adam's apple bobbing. “Then we'll just never let her know. Keep your mouths shut.” 

His friend fell silent, but still asked cautiously, “What if she finds out... and wants a divorce?”
Joseph's lips curled into a smirk. “She loves me too much. How could she ever bear to leave me?”
“Besides, in all of Coastal Harbor, who would dare help her file for divorce without my consent?”
“And even if she did manage to run—” his gaze turned suddenly sharp, “I'd drag her back!
She's in the Ashford family tree. In this life, she's mine, in life and in death. She can only stay by my side.” 

Isabella's breath hitched, her nails digging deep into her arm. 

Joseph, you're wrong!
What makes you think I'd still love you after you've played me for a fool?
And what makes you think I can't leave you? 

Isabella wiped her tears and, without a moment's hesitation, threw the Protective charm in her hand into the trash. 

Then, she left without a word and did two things. 

First, she went to her mother and told her about Joseph's affair.
Isabella's mother sighed deeply after hearing the story. ""I was against you marrying into a wealthy family back then. He knelt before me for ten days and nights, refusing to leave even after the rain gave him a high fever that turned into pneumonia. He wouldn't go to the hospital until I gave him my blessing. I truly thought he was a good man, but I never expected... Isabella, Mom supports you. Let's leave together."" 

Second, she took her mother to begin the process of erasing their legal identity and changed her name.
Since Joseph said her name was in the family tree, and that she couldn't escape the Ashford family in life or death, she would make it so the person ""Isabella"" no longer existed in this world. 

The process of erasing one's legal identity would take half a month. Isabella told her mother to wait patiently. She had to return to the Ashford family first, stay by Joseph's side, and not let him suspect anything was wrong. 

Otherwise, with his methods, neither of them would be able to escape.
Isabella returned to the villa.
Unexpectedly, the moment she walked in, she saw a scene that felt like a blow to the head. 

Joseph was on top of Sophia, riding her on the sofa. And what Sophia was wearing—
was her wedding dress! 

Chapter 2 

The keys slipped from Isabella's hand, clattering to the floor.
Joseph frowned and turned his head. When he saw it was Isabella, he froze. 

He quickly buckled his belt and zipped up his pants. By the time he looked up again, any trace of panic was gone from his face, replaced by the calm composure of a man in power. 

""Isabella... why are you home?""
He asked with a smile.
Isabella's hand dug into her arm, pinching so hard it hurt.
After a long moment, she heard her own faint voice.
""Am I not allowed to come home now?""
Joseph chuckled. ""That's not what I meant. Weren't you at the church getting a protective charm for me?
Why are you back so suddenly?""
As he spoke, he raised his hand to stroke Isabella's hair, but she dodged him. 

Joseph's smile froze on his face. ""Are you angry?
Just because I let Sophia wear one of your dresses?"" 

""One... dress."" 

Isabella's voice trembled as she looked at Joseph in disbelief.
That was her most cherished wedding dress. She had sewn every single pearl on it by hand. Once, the first time she wore it, Joseph's eyes had been filled with awe. ""Isabella, you're so beautiful. This dress is worthy only of you.
From now on, you have to wear it for me every year.""
But now, he had let another woman wear it... and even do that kind of thing in it! 

Isabella stared intently into his eyes, searching for a hint of guilt, but all she saw was a glaring sense of ease. 

Her heart felt as if it had been violently squeezed, and the pain made it almost impossible for her to stand. 

Was Joseph so certain... that she was so desperately in love with him that she would tolerate anything he did? 

Joseph took a step forward, held Isabella's trembling hand, and softened his tone. ""Alright, don't be angry. I'll give you a hundred million. Go buy whatever you want.""
A flash of jealousy crossed Sophia's eyes. She suddenly knelt before Isabella, tears instantly welling up. ""Mrs. Ashford, I'm so sorry... It's all my fault. I just loved this wedding dress so much, and Mr. Ashford let me try it on...""
Though her words were an apology, every syllable stabbed at Isabella's heart, as if telling her: See how much he pampers me. 

Sophia shot Isabella a triumphant glance, then began to cry even harder, ""Mrs. Ashford, please don't be angry, I'll take it off and give it back to you right now...""
Isabella's gaze swept over the glaring stain on the hem of the dress, and she said lightly, ""It's already dirty. I don't want it. You can keep it."" 

Joseph frowned deeply, his voice grave, ""Isabella, don't be ridiculous. How can you just give away a wedding dress?""
Isabella curled her lip, just about to speak. 

Just then, Joseph's phone rang.
He glanced at the caller ID, then looked at Sophia.
Sophia immediately forced an understanding smile: ""Mr. Ashford, don't mind me. Go ahead and take it."" 

Joseph shook his head and said softly, ""You always get a headache when you hear me talk about business. I'll take this outside. Stop kneeling, get up first.""
With that, he stepped out.
Isabella stood frozen, her heart feeling as if it had been brutally pierced by a dull knife.
He never used to discuss business outside, as it involved trade secrets, but now he could even change that habit for Sophia,.
Only Isabella and Sophia were left in the living room. 

Sophia patted her dress and stood up, the weakness on her face instantly transforming into arrogant provocation. 

""You don't know, do you?
Joseph's strange illness was faked.""
She leaned in with a light laugh, ""It was all just to use the excuse of a ritual marriage to ward off misfortune, to bring me in legitimately."" 

""We've been together for over a year, we've tried everything. Just because I said I hadn't tried having fun at his home yet, he immediately got 'sick'..."" 

""Isabella, his body and heart are with me now. What do you have besides the title?"" 

Isabella gave her a cool glance, ""The title can be yours too."" 

Sophia froze, then grew furious: ""Who needs you to give it up!
He was mine to begin with!
The position you're occupying will be mine sooner or later!""
Seeing Isabella remain unmoved, she turned pale with anger. 

Just then, the sound of Joseph's approaching footsteps came from outside the door. 

A vicious look flashed in Sophia's eyes. She suddenly picked up the scalding hot teapot from the coffee table without hesitation, and smashed it against herself! 

""Ah—!"" 

A shrill scream rang out as Sophia staggered and fell to the ground, her fair chest scalded red and covered in blisters. 

She then struggled to crawl to Isabella's feet, crying and trembling: ""Mrs. Ashford, I was wrong, I shouldn't have worn your dress, please let me go...""
When Joseph rushed in, this was the scene that greeted him. 

His face darkened instantly. He narrowed his eyes at Isabella, ""I've already compensated you. How dare you still hurt her? Apologize to her!"" 

""I didn't do it. I won't apologize.""
Isabella said calmly.
""Making excuses, are you?""
A dangerous glint flickered in Joseph's eyes, ""Fine. I'll make you admit it."" 

Isabella was dragged to the sauna by bodyguards. 

The moment the glass door was locked, the hot air felt like countless fine needles pricking her skin. 

The needle on the thermometer climbed steadily. 

50°C... 

60°C... 

70°C... 

Isabella's face was flushed crimson, the steam making it hard for her to breathe. 

Joseph stood outside the door, toying with the wedding ring on his finger, and asked in a low voice, ""Still not admitting it?"" 

Isabella threw herself against the door, pounding on it desperately. Her palms sizzled from the heat, leaving bloody handprints on the glass that evaporated in an instant.
“It really wasn't me, Joseph!
Why don't you check the security footage?” 

She struggled in panic.
“No need. Sophia wouldn't lie to me. You, on the other hand, are becoming more and more disobedient.” 

Joseph didn't look up, asking again: “Will you admit you were wrong?”
Isabella's body trembled uncontrollably. Joseph's favoritism for his lover had actually reached this point. 

Her heart felt like it was tearing apart from the pain in the intense heat. She really couldn't take it anymore! 

“I admit it...” 

Her throat was cracked and dry as she rasped, forcing out the words and lying to him for the first time: “I was wrong.”
Joseph curled his lips in satisfaction, raising a hand slightly to signal the bodyguards to stop. 

Isabella was let out, drenched in sweat, her body temperature alarmingly high. 

Joseph looked at her wretched state, touching her chapped lips soothingly: “If you had just admitted your mistake earlier, you wouldn't have had to suffer.”
“You don't have to apologize to Sophia anymore, but—” His eyes darkened. “Don't let it happen again.” 

Her vision darkened. Isabella's body went limp and she collapsed. The burned skin on her body stung fiercely, but the pain in her heart was even worse. 

Tears streamed down her face uncontrollably. 

She had a congenital heart condition; it was already a miracle she had lived this long.
Before, Joseph used to be so worried about her, not even letting the servants make a sound for fear of startling her. 

He once held her and said: “You are my life. I can't let you get hurt in any way.” 

But now, he had locked her in a room with life-threatening heat that could kill her at any moment.
It turned out that promises were only real the moment they were spoken. 

Chapter 3 

Leaning against the wall, Isabella stumbled her way upstairs.
As soon as she entered her room, she pulled out everything related to Joseph. 

The photos and love letters she once treasured, the postcards bought on their trips together...
She picked up an old sketchbook, and her movements suddenly froze.
It was something Joseph had drawn by hand, chronicling every step of their love story.
The first page: their first meeting by the sea. She had saved a blood-soaked Joseph, and he had fallen for her at first sight. 

The tenth page: the first time he took her to the Ashford family home. Joseph's mother had told her to enter through the doggy door. She had turned and left, but Joseph chased after her, apologizing over and over: “Isabella, it's my fault. I didn't protect you. I let you be wronged. I promise it will never happen again.” 

That time, he sent his mother to a mountain retreat for half a year.
The twentieth page: he announced in front of the entire clan that he would marry her. Grandfather Ashford dragged him to the ancestral hall, warning him that if he violated the family creed, he should beware of ancestral punishment. 

Isabella would never forget that day. Joseph had sneered, throwing the ancestral memorial tablets into the fire and declaring in front of everyone: “I'm the head of the family now, so I make the rules. What do the ancestors matter?”
But now... 

He was using “ancestral punishment” as an excuse to bring his lover into their home. 

Isabella clutched the sketchbook tightly, suddenly remembering Grandfather Ashford's warning before their marriage:
“My grandson only likes obedient dogs. If you want to stay by his side, you have to be willing to be a good dog!” 

At the time, she hadn't believed it, thinking Grandfather Ashford was just trying to scare her and break them up. 

Now, she was beginning to understand. Joseph was the one in power; he only liked puppets who would obey him absolutely and depend on him forever.
And she, Isabella, would be no one's possession! 

Without another moment of hesitation, she threw everything into the fireplace. 

The moment she turned, she slammed right into Joseph's deep gaze.
He stared at the dancing flames, his voice devoid of emotion:
""What are you burning?"" 

Isabella lowered her eyes, her voice faint. ""Just some things I don't want anymore."" 

Joseph nodded casually, taking out a first-aid kit to treat her wound. ""You see? Even after punishing you, your husband still dotes on you the most, coming to treat you himself.""
His hands were warm and dry, his movements gentle, but every inch of skin he touched felt bone-chillingly cold. 

""Isabella, it's your mother's birthday in three days, . I plan to throw a grand celebration, inviting all the elites of Coastal Harbor.""
Isabella said faintly, ""There's no need. My mother doesn't like those kinds of occasions."" 

""No."" 

Joseph gently ruffled her hair, but his tone left no room for refusal. ""Be good. I must let everyone see just how much I spoil you.""
Isabella lowered her eyes, feeling no gratitude, only exhaustion.
Three days later. 

The banquet was held at the largest hotel under the Ashford group, and nearly all of Coastal Harbor's high society was in attendance.
""Mr. Ashford spoils Mrs. Ashford so much, spending billions on his mother-in-law's birthday!""
""Mr. Ashford is truly the perfect man. I'm so jealous of Mrs. Ashford!"" 

""..."" 

Everyone was discussing how much Joseph doted on his wife.
But in a corner, Isabella's mother looked at the burn on Isabella's hand, her eyes red-rimmed. ""My daughter, you've suffered. Just hold on for another half a month, and Mom will take you away."" 

Isabella's nose tingled, and she desperately wanted to cry, but fearing Joseph would notice something was wrong, she tilted her head back, forcing the tears to retreat. 

Joseph took a call, then walked towards them. 

""Isabella, Sophia said she wants to come celebrate your mother's birthday too..."" 

""I don't want to see her.""
Isabella said coldly. 

Joseph's brow furrowed. ""Don't make a scene. She's already on her way. Don't you give her a hard time later."" 

With that, he turned and left, his gaze fixed on the entrance, not sparing Isabella another glance.
Isabella stood there, stunned, her heart feeling as if a piece had been brutally gouged out. 

Isabella's mother couldn't bear to watch anymore and pulled her out to the terrace. 

The night wind was biting, bone-chillingly cold. 

Isabella's motherpicked up a coat and draped it over her. ""Daughter, look, the moonlight is beautiful tonight. It will probably be a sunny day tomorrow."" 

Isabella said softly, ""I hope so...""
Before the words had even faded, a rush of hurried footsteps approached. 

Joseph's face was dark, and he seized her wrist, his grip so tight it nearly crushed her bones. ""Sophia has gone missing. Did you kidnap her? 

Speak! 

Where is she?"" 

Isabella's face turned pale with pain, but she straightened her back and met his gaze. ""It wasn't me.""
Joseph stared at her for a few seconds, then gave a cold smile. ""Fine. You won't admit it, will you? I'll make you talk!"" 

The cruelty that flashed in his eyes sent a chill down Isabella's spine.
Immediately after, he ordered sharply, ""Get me someone in here!
Take her mother away!"" 

Bodyguards immediately stepped forward and began to drag Isabella's mother out forcefully. 

""Joseph, let my mother go!
Where are you taking her?""
Isabella tried to stop them frantically, but the man held her wrist in a death grip. 

No matter how she struggled and cried out, Joseph didn't loosen his grip in the slightest. 

In the opulent banquet hall.
Isabella was forced to her knees on the cold marble floor. 

Joseph leaned back on the leather sofa, his long legs crossed. He took a slow drag from his cigarette, and through the swirling smoke, his cold voice emerged. 

""Where is Sophia?"" 

Isabella shook her head numbly.
She couldn't remember how many times Joseph had asked her this. But she hadn't done it. She really didn't know. 

Joseph stood up, stubbed out his cigarette, and forced Isabella's chin up. ""You're so disobedient.""
He beckoned with a finger. A bodyguard leaned over and handed him a phone, on which he played a video.
In the video, Isabella's mother was tied to a chair with a time bomb strapped to her chest. The numbers on the countdown timer ticked down relentlessly. 

Chapter 4 

Joseph's tone was deceptively gentle, but his gaze was as sharp as ice. ""Isabella, I'm only giving you a final fifty minutes.""
Isabella's face turned deathly pale.
She asked, trembling, ""If I can't find Sophia, will you really kill my mom?"" 

He leaned in close, his dark pupils reflecting her trembling form. ""You can try me."" 

Isabella shuddered, and the tears she had been holding back for so long finally streamed down.
""Joseph, that's my mother! She's the most important person to me! 

You can't do this to her!""
He let out a soft chuckle, but his eyes were terrifyingly cold. ""But Sophia is the most important person to me, too."" 

""The most important?"" 

Isabella looked at him in disbelief. ""More important than me and my mom?""
Joseph's expression didn't change. ""Sophia gave me her first time. The poor girl offered herself in a ritual marriage to ward off misfortune and save me. I owe her a debt. 

As for you, you will always be the one I love most. 

How many times have I told you? I was going to send her away after the ritual marriage was over. Couldn't you just wait? 

Did you have to go after her?""
Isabella stared at Joseph, a bone-chilling cold spreading through her chest. 

The one he loved most?
Would the man who loved her most fake an illness for his mistress, deceive her, and even threaten to kill her mother? 

Isabella had no patience to play along with his act. She was just about to expose his lies.
Suddenly, a bodyguard burst in, shouting, ""Mr. Ashford, we've found Ms. Miller!"" 

Joseph grabbed his suit jacket and headed for the door. 

""What about my mom?"" 

Isabella lunged forward, desperately grabbing his pant leg. ""Let her go!""
Joseph glanced back over his shoulder, his gaze cold. ""The abandoned warehouse in the east district. Go find her yourself.""
Isabella bolted out the door like a madwoman, speeding all the way to the east district. 

When she found her mother, she saw the bomb on her was still counting down! 

Joseph hadn't even sent anyone to disarm it! 

The ticking of the timer sounded like a death knell. There was only one minute left! 

Isabella ripped the tape from her mother's mouth and tried to untie the ropes with trembling hands, but she couldn't get them loose.
""Daughter, forget about me! You have to go—"" Isabella's mother shook her head frantically. 

Tears streamed down Isabella's face in panic. ""Mom, I won't leave you..."" 

Suddenly, Isabella's mother shoved her away with all her might, kicked her feet hard against the ground, and threw herself backward, chair and all—
Isabella let out a heart-wrenching scream: ""Mom—!"" 

A deafening explosion erupted, and the blast wave threw her violently through the air. 

Isabella crashed hard onto the ground, her vision filled with nothing but red. 

The hospital. 

Isabella's mother was critically injured. Although she had survived, she might never wake up. 

Isabella knelt by the hospital bed, tears streaming down her face: ""Mom, I'm so sorry, this is all my fault..."" 

She apologized over and over, but the person on the bed never responded. 

Isabella's heart ached as if it were being torn apart. 

Just a few hours ago, her mother had been smiling, holding her hand tightly, and comforting her in a soft voice. 

But now, she could only lie here, completely still. 

And all of this was caused by the man who claimed to love her!
Isabella cried until her voice was hoarse, finally passing out completely. 

When she opened her eyes again.
Isabella found her hand being held. Joseph was by her bedside, his voice incredibly soft:
""I'm sorry, Isabella, it was all a misunderstanding. Sophia's phone just died, that's why she was unreachable."" 

""I acted rashly."" 

Isabella coldly pulled her hand back, a wave of icy sarcasm washing over her heart.
This was the man who said he loved her most? 

Just because Sophia didn't answer her phone, he kidnapped her mother without even checking! 

""Isabella, don't be angry. After all, you've targeted her before, that's why I suspected you..."" Joseph's eyes were red, his voice low and hoarse. ""Why don't you hit me, or curse me, anything you want..."" 

Bang— 

The hospital room door was suddenly pushed open, and Sophia burst in, her eyes swollen like peaches: ""Mrs. Ashford, it's all my fault, please don't blame Mr. Ashford..."" 

She fell to her knees, weeping gracefully: ""If only I had charged my phone in time, Mr. Ashford wouldn't have been so worried about me that he kidnapped your mother, and she wouldn't be in this state..."" 

Isabella's nails dug fiercely into her palm. Sophia was clearly here to provoke her! 

Just as she was about to throw them out, she saw Joseph bend down to help Sophia up, his tone gentle: ""This has nothing to do with you. Stop crying, it's not good for you.""
Watching this scene, Isabella's heart felt cold and bitter. 

How ironic. Her mother had almost died and was still unconscious from serious injuries, yet he was worried about another woman ""crying.""
""Get out!"" 

Isabella's voice was hoarse. ""Both of you, get out!""
Joseph was stunned: ""Isabella...""
""Get lost!"" 

She suddenly grabbed the vase from the bedside table and smashed it violently on the floor.
Joseph stood up. ""Isabella, calm down first. I'll make it up to you in a few days."" 

With that, he left, shielding Sophia as he went. 

The moment the door closed, Isabella could no longer hold back and burst into tears. 

She didn't want any compensation...

1p8nd27,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1p8nd27/the_voice/,The Voice.,"The couple through the window sits around a warm looking table. The spread of food would put Martha Stewart to shame, the decor is impeccable. 

A quiet whistling tune sounds somewhere in another room as they eat. No talking, no communication, just the quiet sounds of utensils scraping the fine china.

Finally, the man speaks.

“What a marvelous dinner, Maryanne.”, he says, cutting the silence.

“Thank you, dearest. I know you love this cut, I hope it’s seasoned well.”, the woman responds.

They continue to eat in silence, when an overhead voice echoes throughout the room.

“Ask for salt.”

The voice is deep, authoritative but calm.

The man pauses his eating. His eyelids flutter, just for a moment.

“Could I have some salt, Maryanne?”, the man asks.

The woman nods, and passes a small shaker with a too-wide grin.

“Of course.”, she answers.

The man salts his food, and takes another bite.

They continue to eat in silence.

The authoritative voice booms again.

“Your food is now too salty, it’s her fault.”

The couple both pause.

The man’s shoulders tense up, and he says nothing.

The voice continues.

“Your food is too salty.. and it is HER fault.”

The man closes his eyes slowly, his lip quivers just slightly.

The voice booms again.

“Maybe I’m not being clear, my apologies.”

A low rumble fills the room, and we hear a slight beeping. It’s slow at first, but the pace gets a little quicker each beat as if something is charging up.

The woman’s eyes fill with tears.

“Darling, it’s okay. Just.. Just do what he says.”, she pleads.

The man shakes his head, placing his hands on the wooden table to brace himself.

A electric shock surges through him, vibrating the table and causing a quick yelp to come out of the man.

The shock stops, and the man leans on the table. Shaky breaths and soft whimpers are the only sounds we hear for a moment until the voice speaks again.

“Now.. Let’s try again.”

The woman tenses up, but does not shy away.

“M-Maryanne, you have over salted the food. You’ve ruined my dinner.”, the man says quietly.

“I’m sorry, it was an accident.”, the woman replies.

“An accident?”, the man asks, “Y-You know how I feel about accidents..”

The man stands from his seat and slowly crosses to the woman.

He raises his hand, a pained expression across his face.

He then slaps the woman across the face, hard.

The woman cries out, putting her hand over her cheek. A soft cry escapes her.

The man’s hand trembles as he pulls away from her.

They are both silent for a moment before the voice speaks again.

“Good, again.”

•

“They’re struggling with it.. I don’t know if we are going to be getting accurate results..”, the Doctor’s assistant says the next morning.

“Hm.. They are, what do you propose we do?”, the Doctor asks her.

She flips through the stapled paperwork in front of her, brows knitted in concentration.

“We’ve had them for three months, we have done nearly every simulation we can think of and I can’t get a good read on varying emotional patterns. They both seem to be stuck in fear at all times, I want to see at least anger. Rage. Sorrow. Even joy! But it may be a lost cause.”, she explains.

“Rage, huh? Sorrow? Hmm.. so again, what do you think we should do?”, the Doctor asks her, but the assistant knows better. She knows he already has an idea, but he’s testing her.

Always testing her.

“The agreement was for 14 weeks, we could let them go a little early.”, she offers.

The Doctor sighs.

“And the girl?”, he asks.

The assistant shifts uncomfortably on her feet.

“Well, we promised them her safe return if they helped the study. I think they’ve fulfilled their agreement to the best of their abilities, unless you disagree?”, she asks, tilting her head at him.

The Doctor leans towards a group of monitors and types in a few keys, bringing up a surveillance video that looks like a hospital room.

A teenage girl sits on a bed, quietly, and still. The only movement is her knitting needles moving rapidly in her small hands.

The Doctor watches her for a long moment, his face unmoving.

The assistant clears her throat, and continues.

“This couple might just be a bad read, it happens. These are unusual circumstances and they can’t see past that. We aren’t going to be able to study the immediate psychological responses of different domestic life scenarios if they can’t remove themselves temporarily from who they really are. I say, cut them loose. We will source another couple next week.”, she finishes.

The Doctor nods, not taking his eyes off the monitor screen.

“Let’s try once more, I have an idea, and if this doesn’t work I will look into other couples.”, he concludes.

The assistant nods in agreement.

“Okay, what is the new variable?”, she asks.

The Doctor waves her off, picking up his clipboard and writing something down. She understands that she is now dismissed.

She leaves the room, shutting the door behind her.

•

That evening, the couple sits down for dinner.

The man looks more ragged, more tired. The woman’s face still looks a little pink, she is beautiful, but something has already left her eyes.

They quietly eat their meal, the only sound coming from the familiar tapping of their utensils.

“What a marvelous dinner, Maryanne.”, he  finally says, though his voice is quieter from yesterday.

“Thank you, dearest. I know you love this cut, I hope it’s seasoned well.”, the woman responds quietly.

They continue to eat, waiting for their next instructions.

One beat.

Two beats.

The man makes confused eye contact with the woman, and she softly shrugs back.

The confusion remains as the voice finally speaks.

“Compliment her on the dinner.”

The man pauses, his brows lift.

The woman gently looks towards the two-way window facing their table.

“The food really is well-done. Did you try something new?”, the man asks.

“Uh…”, The woman stammers.

The voice speaks.

“Tell him it’s your newest recipe, you got the marinade idea out of a magazine.”

“Why, yes. I saw the recipe in a magazine. I believe it included oranges, how funny is that?”, the woman says, jumping into the scenario.

“Well, it’s delicious. Thank you for making it for us.”, the man says.

More silence.

The couple is starting to relax, they aren’t used to being told to be kind to one another, but maybe this is a new part of the experiment. A change, a welcome one at that.

They continue eating, the energy around them feeling a little brighter for the first time in weeks.

The voice speaks again.

“You may chat, talk about your first date.”

The couple looks surprised, but the man smiles softly. A twinkle appears in his eye that he feared had been already lost.

So the couple talks, they eat the lovely dinner and talk about the awful dinner of hotdogs they shared on their first date. The man said she was radiant that night, the woman blushes.

An hour goes by, and for that hour the couple temporarily escapes their current circumstances and remember how important their love story is. So important that it gave them their precious daughter, the very thing that brought them to this ward to rescue her.

The couple finishes their bottle of wine for the first time since they started, the meal was fantastic and their hearts feel a little less heavy.

“Wow, what a great night.”, the man concludes.

“It really was.”, the woman agrees.

They smile at one another, waiting for the buzzer to sound to allow them to go to their separate rooms for the night.

But the buzzer doesn’t happen right away like it normally does.

More silence.

One beat.

Two beats.

The voice speaks again.

“Ask her what the cut of meat was that she prepared for the night.”

The man looks towards the two-way window, with another confused expression.

“Um.. Maryanne, what was the meat you prepared? Beef, it seemed? Maybe a roast?”, he asks.

Maryanne’s eyes dart to the window, waiting for a cue.

Nothing comes for a moment.

“Oh, yes. I- I believe it was a chuck roast…”, she says.

The voice speaks again.

“No, not a chuck roast. Try again.”

The woman blinks rapidly.

“A.. Steak?”, she asks.

The voice speaks again.

“Not quite.”

“Then, well, I’m not.. sure.. I’m sorry..”, the woman says quickly.

There’s not even a full beat of silence before the voice speaks.

“That’s alright. We wanted you both to have one last great meal before we let you know, we have decided to release you back to your normal lives.”

The woman gasps, putting her hands over her mouth. The man nearly jumps out of his chair.

“Really? We can go?”, he asks, filled with joy.

The voice chuckles before speaking.

“Yes, you both can go.”

The man cries out in tears before crossing to the woman, wrapping her up in a hug as he softly cries into her hair.

“Thank you..”, the woman whimpers.

“Thank you so much, Doctor. When can we get our daughter?”, the man asks.

Silence for a beat.

“That won’t be necessary.”

The man and woman gape at the window.

“What? No! You said, if we do this stupid shit, we can leave with her too. That’s what you said!”, the man yells in rage, as the wife begins to cry.

The voice speaks again.

“I know, and I always keep my promises, you have proven to be extremely helpful this evening in studying the emotions displayed in a domestic living situation. I applaud you! I have no reason to lie to you.”

“Then when do we get her?”, the man demands.

The voice speaks again, for the last time.

“My friend, you already have her. She is leaving with you, though I imagine she’s already made it to your digestive track by now.”

It takes a moment for the couple to realize the words the voice spoke, and like a film reel, we see the emotions play out on their faces.

Confusion.

Contemplation.

Shock.

Disbelief.

Rage.

Panic.

Sorrow.

We see the couple manically running around the set, throwing up and sobbing. Fighting with each other, screaming at the ceiling. The man tries to pound on the glass, tries to get to the voice, but it’s no use.

•

The Doctor lowers the volume on the monitor, watching the couple fall apart in complete silence from his end.

The assistant stands beside the Doctor, her jaw dropped, her hands shaking her clipboard.

“W-What… What did you do…?”, she whispers, though she already knows.

The Doctor shrugs, and grabs his coffee cup.

“You should check your readers, I think we got every emotion you needed tonight and they are both free to go. You should be saying ‘thank you’”, the Doctor says brightly, heading to the door.

“But, that’s, no. Why? Why did you do this? They’ll tear each other apart in there, you fed them their CHILD.”, the assistant wails.

“Spare me the moral lecture, you are no saint. And as for them tearing each other apart? I hope they do.”

1p8n8wn,https://www.reddit.com/r/OdysseyBookClub/comments/1p8n8wn/6_verbal_tricks_to_make_an_aggressive_person/,"6 verbal tricks to make an aggressive person sorry (backed by psychology, not tiktok BS)","I've noticed something lately among friends and colleagues in SF: everyone's walking on eggshells around aggressive people. The loud coworker who hijacks meetings. The passive-aggressive friend who guilt-trips you. That family member who turns every gathering into their personal therapy session. 

Here's what bothers me: most ""communication advice"" online is either doormat-level passive (""just set boundaries!"") or nuclear-option aggressive (""go no contact immediately!""). I spent months digging through conflict resolution research, hostage negotiation tactics, and clinical psychology studies because I was tired of this binary thinking. What I found? There's a third path that actually works, and it's rooted in how human psychology actually functions, not how Instagram therapists wish it worked.

The goal isn't revenge or one-upmanship. It's about making aggressive people recognize their behavior so profoundly that they feel genuine remorse. And yes, it's possible without becoming aggressive yourself.

**The ""broken record"" technique (with a twist)**

Standard advice tells you to repeat your boundary calmly. That's amateur hour. What actually works is repeating your boundary while progressively lowering your voice and slowing your speech. Research from the FBI's Crisis Negotiation Unit shows that decreasing volume and pace creates what they call ""voluntary compliance pressure."" The aggressor subconsciously recognizes they're escalating alone.

Try this: ""I understand you're upset. I'm not discussing this now."" (normal volume). They continue. ""I understand you're upset. I'm not discussing this now."" (slightly quieter, slower). By the third repetition, you're nearly whispering. It's unsettling as hell for the aggressor because their emotional escalation is meeting a void. Most people crack within 60 seconds and either apologize or retreat.

**Strategic silence that creates psychological debt**

Here's something hostage negotiators know that most people don't: silence is excruciating for aggressive personalities. Dr. Albert Mehrabian's research on communication found that when you stop engaging mid-conflict, the aggressor's brain goes into overdrive trying to fill that void. They start imagining your thoughts, usually assuming the worst about themselves.

The trick is the 17-second rule. When someone's being aggressive, respond once calmly, then go completely silent for 17+ seconds while maintaining neutral eye contact. Don't look angry. Don't look smug. Just...present. Studies from the International Journal of Conflict Management show this specific duration triggers self-reflection rather than more aggression. 

I watched someone use this on a screaming customer at a coffee shop. 17 seconds of calm silence. The guy literally apologized mid-rant and left. It was beautiful.

**The ""documentary narrator"" approach**

This one's from Dialectical Behavior Therapy and it's absolutely savage in the most clinical way possible. You simply narrate what's happening like you're David Attenborough observing wildlife.

Aggressive person: ""You NEVER listen to me! You're so selfish!""
You: ""I notice you're raising your voice and making absolute statements about my character.""

That's it. No defense. No counter-attack. Just observation. Psychologist Dr. Marsha Linehan found this technique forces people to hear their own behavior described objectively, which creates immediate cognitive dissonance. Their brain goes ""wait, do I sound like that?"" 

The key is using completely neutral language. Not ""you're screaming at me"" but ""your voice is raised."" Not ""you're being manipulative"" but ""I'm noticing an attempt to change my decision through emotional escalation."" It's like holding up a mirror they can't look away from.

**Tactical apologizing (the reverse psychology play)**

This sounds counterintuitive but stick with me. Research from Stanford's psychology department shows that unexpected apologies disarm aggressive people by removing their justification for aggression. But you're not apologizing for whatever they're claiming you did wrong.

Try: ""I apologize that this conversation has become so emotionally charged. That wasn't my intention.""

You're apologizing for the *situation*, not taking blame. Dr. Aaron Lazare's work on apology as a psychological tool shows this specific phrasing triggers what he calls ""aggression deflation."" The person gearing up for battle suddenly has no target. Most aggressive people are so used to defensive responses that an apology (even a strategic one) completely scrambles their script.

I've seen this work in salary negotiations, family arguments, even road rage situations. The aggressor usually stammers out an apology within two minutes because they feel like an asshole for staying angry at someone who ""apologized.""

**The ""future-focused pivot""**

Aggressive people feed on rehashing past grievances. Dr. John Gottman's research on conflict patterns found that constantly referencing past events is one of the ""Four Horsemen"" that predicts relationship failure. So you strategically refuse to engage with the past.

Them: ""You did the same thing last month and the month before!""
You: ""I hear that you're connecting this to past situations. What specific change would you like to see moving forward?""

This technique, borrowed from solution-focused brief therapy, does two things: it invalidates their attempt to build a case against you, and it forces them to actually think constructively. Most aggressive people can't answer that question because they're more interested in venting than solving. The silence after you ask it becomes deafening, and they usually realize they're just being an asshole.

**The ""iron boundary with velvet wrapping""**

This is the closer. When nothing else works, you deploy what crisis counselors call ""compassionate detachment."" You acknowledge their humanity while completely shutting down their behavior.

""I can see this matters deeply to you, and I respect that. I'm not available to continue this conversation in this way. When you're ready to discuss this calmly, I'm here. Until then, I'm stepping away.""

Then you literally walk away. Dr. Harriet Lerner's research on boundaries shows that this combination (acknowledging emotion + firm limit + offering future connection) creates what she calls ""productive guilt."" The aggressive person is left holding their own emotional mess with no one to project it onto. That's when the apology texts start rolling in.

The key is you have to actually walk away. No looking back. No responding to the inevitable ""Where are you going?!"" That hesitation gives them an opening to reel you back in.

**Why this actually works (the psychology breakdown)**

The research is clear on this: aggressive behavior is almost always rooted in feeling unheard, disrespected, or powerless. Dr. Marshall Rosenberg's work on Nonviolent Communication shows that aggression is a tragic expression of unmet needs. But here's the thing everyone gets wrong: meeting those needs isn't your job, especially when someone's being abusive about it.

These techniques work because they simultaneously acknowledge the person's humanity while refusing to be their emotional punching bag. You're not fighting fire with fire. You're removing the oxygen. Psychologists call this ""extinction through non-reinforcement."" The aggressive behavior stops getting rewarded with a reaction, so it eventually dies out.

Studies from the Journal of Applied Psychology found that people who consistently use these de-escalation techniques report 60% fewer aggressive encounters over six months. Not because they avoid conflict, but because aggressive people learn (consciously or not) that these individuals won't play the game.

**The reality check nobody wants to hear**

Sometimes people won't feel sorry. Some folks are just committed to their aggression because it's worked for them their entire lives. Personality disorders exist. Trauma responses exist. Not everyone has the self-awareness or emotional capacity to recognize their behavior and feel remorse.

That's not a failure on your part. The goal isn't to fix aggressive people or make them better humans. It's to protect your peace while giving them one chance to recognize their impact. If they don't take it? That's data. Valuable data about who deserves your energy.

**Resources that actually helped me understand this stuff**

**Crucial Conversations by Kerry Patterson** (won multiple awards, Patterson's a Stanford researcher): This book completely changed how I approach high-stakes discussions. The chapter on creating safety before addressing content is worth the price alone. Best conflict resolution book I've ever read. Makes you question everything you thought you knew about ""winning"" arguments.

**Never Split the Difference by Chris Voss** (Former FBI hostage negotiator): Voss breaks down actual life-or-death negotiation tactics in ways you can use at work or home. The ""accusation audit"" technique alone has saved me countless uncomfortable conversations. Insanely good read if you deal with difficult people regularly.

**BeFreed**: Okay, I need to mention this personalized audio learning app here because it completely changed how I actually retain and apply communication strategies. You type in what you want to learn—like ""conflict resolution techniques"" or ""how to handle difficult conversations""—and it pulls from books, research papers, expert interviews, and creates custom podcasts tailored to your specific goals. I've been using it to go deeper into Gottman's work and DBT techniques, and I can customize the depth (10-min summaries or 40-min deep dives with examples). The voice options are genuinely addictive—I switch to the deep, calm voice like Samantha from Her when I need to absorb complex psychology concepts. What's wild is you can pause mid-podcast and ask questions to its avatar Freedia, which has helped me connect dots between different communication frameworks. My mind feels clearer, and I'm way better at articulating these techniques in actual conflicts now instead of just freezing up.

**The Conflict Resolution Toolbox app**: Practical, scenario-based training for different conflict types. Has a ""difficult personalities"" section that's surprisingly nuanced. The AI roleplay feature lets you practice these techniques without the real-world stakes.

**Dr. Ramani's YouTube channel**: She's a clinical psychologist who specializes in narcissistic behavior and manipulation tactics. Her videos on ""grey rocking"" and dealing with high-conflict personalities are incredibly practical. No fluff, just clinical expertise explained clearly.

**Insight Timer** (meditation app): Has specific guided practices for emotional regulation during conflict. The ""RAIN"" technique (Recognize, Allow, Investigate, Nurture) for processing anger has legitimately helped me stay calm when people are losing their shit at me.

Look, human conflict is messy and uncomfortable and sometimes unavoidable. But you don't have to win every battle or convince every aggressive person they're wrong. Sometimes the victory is just maintaining your dignity while they realize, too late, that they were fighting with someone who refused to fight back.

That realization, that moment when it hits them that they were aggressive to someone who stayed calm? That's the sorry you're looking for. And it's so much more powerful than any apology you could demand.",1,1764309215.0,OdysseyBookClub,0,1.0,False

Then, within just a few hours, he died. This was determined by doctors to be an allergy born from a tick bite.

Since most of you seemed to be interested in my series called Death on the Doorstep (DOTD). Here's the first story of the series. Like I said in my previous post, I have no intention yet to turn these story concepts into full fledged stories, i just really enjoy, but I have only written summaries for each story. So here's the first story in the Death on the Doorstep series, DOTD: Memories

Death on the Doorstep: Memories is a story about…
how love is not built on grand gestures, but on everyday moments such as folded laundry, shared coffee, quiet laughter, and holding each other through pain. It explores the idea that when the end of the world arrives, what we cling to isn’t the future, but the past. It’s about the memories that shaped us and the person who walked through it all with us. It’s about acceptance rather than panic, choosing presence over fear, and finding beauty in the ordinary. At its core, it shows that real love is resilient, imperfect, intimate, and deeply human. It proves that a life doesn’t have to be extraordinary to be meaningful, it only has to be shared.



Summary


The story unfolds on the final day before an impending cosmic catastrophe; a massive comet hurtling toward Earth, guaranteed to erase everything. Yet the narrative does not dwell on chaos or fear. Instead, it focuses on the quiet, deeply human moments shared by a couple as they spend their last day together.

The morning begins gently. They wake up beside each other, lying face to face on their pillows, and smile. They don’t speak at first, they just look at each other, memorizing every little feature. There is no panic, only a calm understanding: this is their last sunrise, and they will live it together. They move through their morning routine with soft familiarity, brewing coffee, sharing a simple breakfast, brushing teeth side by side. These small actions, once mundane, now feel sacred. The ordinary has become beautiful simply because it is their last time experiencing it together.

They find comfort and humor in the normalcy. When the wife decides to take a shower, the husband raises an eyebrow. “Why are you showering? The world ends today.” She smirks and shrugs. “I don’t know. I guess I want to smell good in the afterlife.” They laugh, not because anything is funny, but because laughter is their way of holding onto life. Their dialogue is playful, light, and honest, revealing the quiet acceptance they’ve already made. They are not running, not hiding, not denying. They’re simply choosing to live.

They clean the house, fold laundry, make the bed. Not because it matters in a practical sense, but because these rituals have always been theirs. These everyday tasks become intimate acts of love, grounding them in what matters most. Normal life, shared together, becomes their final rebellion against the end.

Memories begin to surface throughout the day, triggered naturally by the world around them. They flip through old photo albums, each picture unlocking a chapter of their story: their first awkward meeting, the early days of falling in love, their wedding, the quiet afternoons spent laughing in the kitchen. Some memories spark joy, some bring tears, some both at once. They tease each other about old fights and smile at the growth they’ve gone through.

But eventually, they reach the chapter that changed everything, the miscarriage. The room grows still. They remember the pain, the grief, the silence that filled their home. They remember how easy it would have been to fall apart. But they didn’t. Instead, they clung to each other, battled through heartbreak, and rebuilt. This moment, painful as it was, became the anchor of their love. It shaped who they are now; more patient, more compassionate, and more unbreakable. It is clear that they never got the life they dreamed of… but they made a life worth loving anyway.

In the afternoon, the emotional weight builds until they need release. So, with mischievous smiles, they begin breaking things such as plates, vases, glasses, which they shatter on the floor. The first crash is shocking. The next is liberating. Soon they are laughing uncontrollably as shards scatter around them. It’s reckless and childish and perfect. The destruction becomes symbolic: letting go of control, of fear, of everything they cannot change. When the last dish hits the floor, they stand in the middle of the mess, breathing hard, then collapse into each other’s arms. Surrounded by broken pieces, they feel more whole than ever.

As evening falls, the house grows quiet. They slow dance in the kitchen without music, moving in a rhythm only they understand. Their bodies say what words cannot: Thank you. I love you. I’m glad it was you. The dance is imperfect, soft, and intimate, just like their life together.

They spend the remaining hours talking, reminiscing, holding each other. They don’t waste time on “what could have been.” Instead, they focus on gratitude for the years they had, for the memories they built, for the fact that even in their worst moments, they always chose each other.

Night arrives. The sky glows with the light of the approaching comet. Hand in hand, they climb onto the roof of their home. The world around them is silent, but it doesn't feel lonely. It feels peaceful. They sit side by side, legs dangling over the edge, watching the sky burn. She rests her head on his shoulder. He leans gently into her. In this final moment, there is no fear, there is only calm.

They are not satisfied because their lives were perfect. They are satisfied because they lived them together. Through laughter and grief, through mundane mornings and shattering losses, through broken dishes and healing hearts. They stayed.

As the comet fills the horizon, they do not look away. They face the end the same way they faced life: side by side, hand in hand, completely together.

And with quiet acceptance… the world ends.



Death on the Doorstep: Memories is a story about the quiet truth of love and the beauty found in ordinary life, even at the very end. Rather than focusing on destruction or chaos, it centers on a couple who choose to embrace the present, reflect on their past, and find peace in the small, everyday moments that defined their relationship. It explores how memories (joyful and painful alike) shape who we become and reveal the strength of a bond that has endured hardship, loss, and time. At its heart, the story is about acceptance, gratitude, and the powerful idea that a meaningful life isn’t built on grand events, but on the simple act of choosing each other again and again… right up to the final moment.

1p8n0r1,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1p8n0r1/cabin_13_part_1/,Cabin 13 Part 1,"The cold hum of the interrogation room felt more like a pulse than a sound—steady, mechanical, inevitable. A single recorder light glowed red on the table between Deputy Ethan Cole and the two detectives watching him like cornered predators.

“Thank you for sitting down with us today, Deputy Cole,” Detective Hale began, voice calm but firm. “We just need some clarification on the events that occurred during the storm.”

“I understand,” Ethan replied. His voice was cool, even—almost hollow.

Detective Trent leaned forward, elbows sharp against the metal table. “Good. Because parts of your written report don’t line up. With anything. Really.”

“What my partner is trying to say,” Hale cut in, “is we’re missing some big chunks here. And we need you to fill in the blanks before we move forward.”

Trent tapped the folder. “Start from when you arrived at Cabin 13. Your report jumps straight to ‘visual confirmation compromised’ with no explanation. Why?”

Ethan paused long enough that the silence grew teeth.  
“Because that’s when everything… shifted,” he finally said. “You’ll hear it yourself.”

Trent sighed. “Alright. Then let’s go over the evidence together.”

The tape recorder clicked. Static shivered through the room. A low hum settled like fog.

“Case file 09-173,” Ethan narrated, tone crisp and methodical. “Subject: Ella Maren. Audio and visual recordings retrieved from Cabin 13. All devices were installed by Deputy James Ward—left untouched since the night of the storm. These recordings appear uncompromised. Beginning playback.”

The hum faded into wind. Brutal, icy, immediate.

# Tape 1: The Arrival

Snow crunched violently under Ella Maren’s boots as she stumbled through the storm. The wind clawed at her coat, her hair, her breath. The dark cabin loomed ahead like something abandoned on purpose.

“Close it! Hurry!” she gasped as she shoved through the door.

James Ward slammed it behind them with a grunt. “Got it. Safe and sound,” he assured her, brushing snow from his shoulders. 

Ella leaned against the wall, chest heaving. “I—I can’t believe we made it! That storm came out of nowhere… oh my God… the cops… what if they saw us?”

James laughed softly, warm and soothing—just like he always was. “They didn’t. You worry too much.” Ella didn’t know if it was his accent or his age, but he had a way of soothing her effortlessly.

He stepped past her and struck a match.  
The fire crackled to life, spilling orange across the ruined cabin walls.

“Come on,” he murmured. “Let’s get you warm.”

Later that night, Ella wandered through the dim room, rubbing her arms. “This place is really falling apart,” she muttered. “Hey… why do you think there’s a padlock on this door?”

James didn’t even look up. “Probably locked for a reason. Rotten floors. Falling beams. Best not to poke around.”

“But it looks new,” she said, touching the metal. “Like someone put it on recently.”

He smiled without warmth. “Curiosity killed the cat. Perhaps you should heed that warning.”

Ella rolled her eyes. “Good thing I’m not a cat.”

She drifted to an old dresser, opening drawers, brushing dust from forgotten photographs. “Wow… look at these. This place used to be popular. Families, hunters—”

“Ella.” James’s voice softened into something hypnotic. “Quiet curiosity is good, darling. But some things are better left alone.”

Outside, wind swelled against the walls like a living thing.

Ella swallowed. “Seriously, James… why this place?”

“It’s perfect,” he said simply. “Safe. Secluded. Just the two of us. Cop cars have cameras—everyone does. We need to lie low.""

He stepped closer, voice dropping. “I promise it will all be worth it.”

The fire crackled as she moved into his arms.

As the night carried on, the storm grew furious. Wood creaked overhead. The fire popped sharply, sending sparks into the dim cabin.

“Everything feels… unreal,” Ella whispered, leaning into him.

“It’s real enough,” James said. “We got away. You poor thing—you’re still cold.”

She laughed weakly. “You just want an excuse to hold me all night.”

“Guilty.” He kissed her forehead. “Come here.”

Then—  
A scraping sound outside. Slow. Deliberate.

Ella stiffened. “James—did you hear that?”

“Nothing to worry about,” he said. “Just the storm.”

A thump echoed from upstairs, heavier this time.  
A faint whisper threaded through the noise—almost human.

“James!” she hissed. “That wasn’t the storm.”

“Maybe the house is settling,” he teased. “Or maybe you’ve got a visitor.”

She shivered. “Why do I feel like something’s watching?”

Another metallic rattle came from a back room.

The fire didn’t feel warm at all.

Hours later, the storm had softened into a low moan. James slept beside the fire, breathing steady.

Ella whispered, “James? Are you asleep?”

No answer. Just the quiet rise and fall of his chest.

She slipped away, rummaging through her bag. “Where’s my phone…?”

A faint buzz answered her.

She froze.

That wasn’t her phone.

It was James’s.

She hesitated, then picked it up. The screen lit the room with a cold glow.

Her breath caught.

Three messages, from a number with no name:

***“Don’t damage the package.”***

***“Package secured.”***

***“Rolling. Make it clean.”***

A cold ache spread through her chest.

“James…?” she whispered.

A heavy thud sounded outside.  
Then—

***Thump.***

***Thump.***

She gasped, stumbling back. “Who’s there?!”

Silence. Then footsteps crunching away. A car door.  
Red taillights blinked through the frosted window.

“Oh God… someone’s here… James!”

He jolted awake. “Ella? What are you doing up?”

“There was—someone outside!”

“You’re imagining things,” he said too calmly. “It’s just the storm.”

“No. James, your phone—there were messages. What ‘package’? Who—”

His eyes sharpened. “Why are you looking through my phone?”

“I—I didn’t mean to—”

He held out a hand. “Everything I do is for us. Give it here. Everything is under control.”

Ella hesitated, then surrendered the phone.

He deleted the messages instantly.

“You deleted those fast,” she murmured.

He smirked. “Worried it’s for another lady?”

“What? No—”

“Stop worrying,” he said, pulling her close again.

But she couldn’t shake the chill crawling up her spine.

The fire popped sharply.  
The wind howled as if trying to warn her.

# End of Tape 1

The tape clicked off. The hum of the interrogation room returned like a heartbeat.

“End of first recording,” Ethan said. “Cabin 13, Winter Storm 2021. Subjects recorded in full. Environmental anomalies logged: persistent thumping, structural creaks without wind pressure, intermittent whispering. Subject Ella Maren exhibits escalating distress aligned with those anomalies.”

Detective Trent leaned forward. “Deputy Cole… you keep referring to James Ward as ‘the suspect.’ But according to our system—he was still active duty. Never missed a shift.”

“That’s not possible,” Ethan said flatly.

Hale folded his arms. “Is it? Because the only people who could adjust those timecards were Internal Affairs… and members of Ward’s own unit.”

Trent jabbed a finger at him. “Which includes you, Deputy.”

Ethan smiled tightly. “James was the only dirty one.”

“Then explain the surveillance gear inside Cabin 13,” Hale pressed. “All of it department-issued.”

“And explain why Ella Maren’s name doesn’t appear anywhere in our system,” Trent added. “Not until after Ward disappeared.”

Ethan inhaled slowly. Exhaled even slower.  
“You’re asking the wrong questions.”

Hale sighed. “Alright. Let’s take five. You need anything? Coffee? Water?”

“Coffee,” Ethan murmured. “It’s going to be a long night.”

The detectives left. The door shut with a hollow thud.

Ethan stared at the silent recorder.  
“Everything really went to hell, didn’t it, James?” he whispered.

From somewhere far away—through the vents or through the walls—  
came a scream.

Faint.

Warped.

Directionless.

The tape stuttered. *Click*.

A couple other questions:

1. When I try to brew with only coffee grounds I see that it splashes/bursts to the sides. What am I doing wrong? My theories are - 
 * My grounds are too coarse. I am using a [cuisinart grinder](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00018RRRK?tag=saw101-20&th=1) set to the finest possible setting
 * Pressure is too high for the coarseness of grinds that I have. When I mix in some chicory grinds (ground finer than my homeground beans), I do not see this problem.
 * Low dosage: I am using too little grinds. I typically use 14-16g in a double-shot basket.

So I've been intensely researching Moka pots and own a few that have some really interestingly engineered features like 3.5 bar pressure release valves and cool clasps etc

Now I saw this model that doesn't exist anymore and had a very cool thought that I'd like to see if anyone can answer firstly if it's possible and what it would take to make.

https://youtu.be/4WgzKFJ6klE?si=YE6I1HjLJVKLtBMZ

This shows the original version, the idea is that spout allows pressure to build. Once the pressure builds enough it pops up and the steam releases from a small hole into the milk and swirls the milk effectively steaming it and injecting coffee into it.

The idea I had would be to essentially create a pressure based propeller system. The pot of course needs to be much taller as the main issue with this pot is the foam leaks.

Secondly the propeller would agitate the bubbles in a where were you get a nanofoam like from a true milk steamer vs these kinda huge unpleasant amateur latte that the video shows.

And if this concept isn't possible then the other idea would be a stovetop milk steamer, but instead of just producing steam, you have coffee inside as well so you would open the steam valve, and literally use the coffee steam to foam your milk, and then releasing it fully to add the liquid coffee in

I would love input on these ideas and a discussion! I'm considering drilling up some cheap Moka pots and doing some experimenting.

# AITA for gifting my mom and her husband a book on cheating for their anniversary?

I'm (16 M) and I love my mom (35) but when I was 10 she had an affair and left us, I visited her as often as I could and she always seemed so happy when I was there but I hated her new family so I stopped visiting. Honestly we rarely ever saw each other after just for my birthday and events really. She wants us to be close but I want nothing to do with her new husband so I've kept my distance.

Except on Feb 20th my dad announced he'd be out on business till the 12th and my grandparents are stuck visiting relatives in Italy and so I really had nowhere to go and my mom jumped at the chance to have me stay with her. And just my luck that my mom's anniversary with her husband was on Sunday.

I haven't had a good time here at all so all I do is stay in my room doing homework or go out with friends to avoid family activities cause it sucks seeing how lovey dovey she is with her husband and how they seem like the perfect family with their daughters. The morning before her anniversary day she came to my bed and tried to cuddle with me like before she left us but it made me angry like we can't go back in time and pretend it's how it was. So I just pretended to be asleep and stayed curled up and frozen till she left. I started crying cause of that and I felt angry and snarky and my mom majored in literature so I got her a copy of Anna Karenina for her anniversary. That book's about a lady who leaves her husband and son for her lover. I've never read it but I watched the movie with my girlfriend and I hated it.

The anniversary party was on Sunday. Everyone was having fun but me and then people gave their gifts. I gave mine and when my mom saw what it was she seemed shocked but just said thanks. The party ended like an hour after. But at night when she was in her room I heard her crying really loudly. So I kinda eavesdropped a little and heard her saying stuff about that book and me and her husband trying to calm her. The next day at breakfast she left for work early before I woke up and her husband straight up called me an asshole and other stuff for gifting them that. It's been a few days now and my mom has barely talked to me. Honestly I feel so wrong I made my mom cry but at the same time I don't want to be here and she knows that so am I really the asshole?

Edit:

Thankfully the mods have locked this. But to everyone who keeps DMing me here's some facts to read before you do:

* I gave my mom the book to try and get it across to her that I hate being at her house and being around her family and that it hurts me to be there because I sympathized with the son from the movie not because I want a train to run her over - I do not want that to happen to my mom
* I do not want my dad to get back together with my mom, he's happy with his fiancee
* My dad has his reasons for not wanting me to go to therapy and is just being protective
* Yes I stopped visiting my mom cause I hate her husband but she had custody of me on weekends or breaks she could've forced me to be with her but since being with him or making him be with us whenever I did go to her was more important she never tried anything beyond the bare minimum of going to big events.

# [RELEVANT COMMENTS]

>**cinnamngrl**

>Info: Have you ever confronted your mother about the way she left?

**OOP:** I've tried before, but she's never wanted to talk about and has always told me to just focus on the now.

**jammy913**

>NTA.

>Your mom had to face her past horrible behavior and your gift caused her to have to confront the fact that her affair affects you negatively to this day. Her husband needs to stay TF out of it. If he says ANYTHING else to you, perhaps you should challenge him on it.

**OOP:** Honestly, I hate him and just don't say anything to him no matter how much he reaches out. After he ranted at me on Monday I just gave him an 'are you done' look and left to go to school.

**CrazyBoPeep**

>You say you love your mom but do you? Nothing in your post points to that. You don’t like being around her, dread spending time with her, don’t like even talking to her.

>The affair was 6 years ago, and if you are still actively upset by it and lashing out then you may benefit from therapy.

**OOP:** Of course I do. End of the day no matter what she's done she's still my mom. I do like being around her and spending time with her, I love talking to her - I just hate that I have to do that around her new husband or the kids she has with him and the life that she left mine for. I love my mom so much thats why it sucked hearing her cry.

>**Relevant\_Squirrel\_70**

>INFO: How much effort has your mom put into making amends with you?

**OOP:** She always comes to my birthdays or big events like basketball finals and stuff. But she never does anything beyond that cause then it's got to involve her new family. Like, we can't go for ice cream cause then she's going to bring her daughters. Can't go to a theme park cause then she'll bring her entire family. Can't really hang out at all cause her family will need her.

>**irishgirl1981**

>Info: Did your mom ever apologize for hurting you, or for leaving? Has she made genuine efforts to reconcile and maintain a relationship?

**OOP:** No. ***\[...\]*** Not really. Maybe it feels like to her she has, but it doesn't to me. ***\[responding the 2nd question\]***

>**0-69-100-6**

>YTA. I don't know why your mother had an affair but just because a person has children doesn't mean they have to stay in that relationship if it is not working. There is not enough information to know why the breakup happened but it sounds like the current one works for her. It also sounds like she did not abandon you but you could not deal with her being happy with someone other than your dad. This is not a poor reflection on you. You were a young kid.

>You are getting older now and you may never find out what caused their relationship to fracture. But you do have a chance at having a relationship with your mom.

**OOP:** I could handle her being happy with someone if he wasn't the guy she cheated and left us for.

**Xhadiel**

>This is a tough one, especially looking at the ages. Your mother was pretty young when she had you, and you don’t mention your fathers age at all

**OOP:** My dad is a year younger than my mom. Her husband is like twelve or something years older than her.

>**grw313**

>NTA

>That is delightfully petty. But do yourself a favor and get therapy before you are consumed by your anger towards your mother. You never have to forgive her, but learn to move past what happened and not obsess over it.

**OOP:** I talk to the counselor at school. My dad's probably not going to let me go to a psychologist.

>**\[deleted\]**

>Oh why not?

**OOP:** Cause of some stuff that happened to him with a psychologist when he was younger Like younger than me but I'm not going to talk about that it isn't relevant and I think it's against the rules to explicitly mention.

**\[apagado\]**

>Oh my god....yeah, at least tell your mom, tell SOMEONE. And more he does it, document and record.

>Cause he is gonna start shit with you when your mom is not around.

>Trust me on that one.

>His kind always do.

**OOP:** I just avoid him. I don't talk to him. I don't remember the last thing that I said to him. He can try and start shit with me all he wants, but he is never getting a word out of me.

>**AaTube** ***\[the comment was talking about the book\]***

>If she is smart enough to know the implications, she already saw the consequences.

**OOP:** I did not mean for it to tell my mom to let a train hit her. I do not want my mom dead. I watched the movie and I felt really bad for the son in it and I wanted it to show her how unhappy I am at her home.

**Text-Negative**

>You should talk to her. It was horrible of her to cheat on your father and wreck your family, and if you can, please get therapy. I don't know why your father is acting overprotective, getting help isn't a bad thing at all but I don't know the circumstances and I'm not gonna judge. Ask her to listen to you first, not to interrupt you until you ask her to, lead the conversation. All the best

**OOP:** That's just cause really bad things happened to him with his psychologist and he doesn't want them to happen to me. He's just scared for me I know it doesn't make sense, it doesn't to me either but it's just how he is about it.

>**SoftSpoken707**

>I was curious about what you heard your mom say about you when you were eavesdropping? Can you spare any details?

**OOP:** Just stuff like about how she can't teach that book anymore or how she just wants me to be happy at her home.

**cgamgee**

>Imo it's not protective to keep you out of therapy... Has your dad actually been to therapy or are his onions based on hearsay

**OOP:** Yes, he has been and bad things happened to him. That's why he's scared. He doesn't want the same to happen to me.

# [UPDATE #1]

Posting this now cause people keep messaging me about it. The day after I posted I let my gf read it and she was like stay with me dummy. I told my dad, he said I could stay there and sent my gf's mom an email. At my mom's home I told her, she got really sad but said ok she'd drive me and sent an email too. I still wanted to talk alone to my mom like people said to.

As she drove I wanted to talk like the school counselor helped me write a letter to read (like some people said to) but I just froze and she drove to a parking lot and started talking. She said a lot of stuff about the book, about still seeing me like I'm her baby, her not actually being happy and about us but ended with her saying its ok for me to hate her for what she did cause she hurt me and she'd never push to be my mom again but if I ever wanted she'd be there for me. But I don't hate her I love her so I started crying really bad I've never had a breakdown but I think that's what it was. I remember her taking me to the backseat and hugging me and me trying to say I love her while crying but its a blur. She calmed me down and I told her how I feel and I do want her to be my mom just I hate her husband and I don't want a train to hit her I even told her about when she tried to cuddle and how I feel bad now cause that'll never happen again cause I'm never going back to her house. She told me she knew I was awake and was mad at her so I started crying again. She told me it was ok and she's wrong and we talked a lot but I kept crying so she got me advil cause my head started hurting. She seemed sad I hate her husband but got really mad at him when I told her all the mean things he's said to me and said she'd never let him get between us again. She said she'd take me to therapy with just her no matter what dad says and to spend time with me alone.

She dropped me off and I've felt better since I stayed there until my dad came back. My dad promised never to send me there again and to stay at my gf's if my grandparents stay in Italy. He agreed to let me do family therapy with my mom but he said he'd ensure its appropriate. We haven't started it yet, but my mom has kept her promise to spend time with me so far and it does make me feel happier.

I didn't think the last post would blow up like it did so I hope with this update you guys don't have to worry much anymore cause I think it's getting better.

# [RELEVANT COMMENTS]

>**\[apagado\]**

>OP did she ever try and tell you why she just up and abandoned you and had an affair

**OOP:** I don't know why she had an affair but she left because she got pregnant.

**\[apagado\]**

>Did she ever try and push for you and half siblings to have a relationship?

**OOP:** She tried when I was there but I managed to duck out of the family activities and stuff she tried to get me to do with everyone. I don't have any problem with them but if having a relationship with them means one with their dad I can't do it. My mom promised me that whenever I was ready to get to know them she would make sure we would do it without him around.

>**AlexanaK**

>Sorry if I missed this already answered somewhere, but why do you hate her husband so much? Obviously the affair, but I mean she chose to participate as well.

>You obviously do not have to like him and I’m glad she’s so open to you keeping him out of your life. Just curious if he did something else.

**OOP:** Because he met her through my dad through work and he still went after her even though he knew she was married and had me. And after she left, every single time I tried to be alone with her or do something with her he'd always get involved like he was trying to be a mediator or like I could only see her through him and when he couldn't go he'd make sure to send their kids. He'd always try and make me respect him as a stepdad and would get upset when I didn't or didn't do things with him that I'd do with my mom or dad. Then when I stopped talking to him entirely he'd say I was being too stubborn for my own good, would call me a mule, say my mom deserved better than me and other stuff. He never actually cursed me out until I gave the book.

>**Femme0879**

>Hello young man. I’m so sorry for everything you’ve gone through, but your update gave me hope for your future with your mother. I do have questions, but you don’t have to answer any of them.

>What has your mom done in regards to how her husband treats you? Did she make him apologize? Has your half siblings ever mistreated you themselves? Have you done any therapy with her yet, and is it virtual or in person? How did your dad react to you choosing therapy?

**OOP:** I don't know. She was really angry when I told her everything and told me he doesn't have a right to say things like that to me and in regard to the book that he shouldn't be trying to defend her from me cause I didn't do anything wrong and even if I did she'd always forgive me. Something probably happened but I don't know. I told her I didn't want any apology from him. I don't want to see him or hear his voice. So I don't really care if he is sorry or not. No, they're just little kids. ***\[about his half siblings\]*** We're starting with a psychologist (I think that's what she is?) next week on Friday. ***\[about therapy\]*** He was kind of tense about it but he talked to my mom on the phone and she either said she'd pull the custody card to make sure I go or she somehow convinced him. He's fine with it now, but he wants to meet the psychologist before we start. ***\[about how his fahter reacted to OOP doingtherapy\]***

***OOP appeared in the comments from BORU*** [***(in another sub)***](https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/tfop10/comment/i122bhq/?context=3) ***and answered some questions.***

>How did you find out your mom had cheated?

**OOP:** She left because she got pregnant. Kind of hard to hide that from me.

>Your dad was sad/angry/betrayed, and wanted her new relationship to fail, so he unloaded his feelings onto you. Something along the lines of ""Mom cheated and she's leaving our family because she doesn't love us any more.""

**OOP:** He never said anything like that or anything to try and make me think bad of her.

>And clearly he was successful, because of the absolute hate you now have for your stepdad.

**OOP:** I hate my mom's husband because I hate him, not because I was ordered to by my dad. I've given my reasons for why I hate him.

My dad never wanted me to stop being with my mom and has never tried to turn me against her. He always thought that a boy needs his mom but never forced me to go cause he knew how much being around her husband hurt me and she never pushed to do anything without her family. I guess he thought things would be different this time and cause there was nowhere else for me to go.

>Would you still hate your stepdad if your mom left your dad before cheating on him?

If he was the same kind of person he is to me, then I probably would.

>**Curiousscience2014**

>On the update you mentioned that your mother said that she wasn't happy. Is she not happy with her marriage or something in her life? I got really curious about this because this can maybe cause some problems in her relationships in general and it can maybe affect your relationship with her. Wish you all the best.

**OOP:** While she was talking in the parking lot and I was just listening to her talk about things I listed and she brought up that she wasn't that happy but has always seen me as a perfect baby in her head like I'm still ten and I can't do any wrong and I'm her favourite. So she was trying to make her house seem like a perfect place and was trying to be more loving with her husband and try and make us do all the family activities cause she thought it would make me come over more. Like she thought if she could make me happy to be at her home willingly instead of pushing the custody agreement then she'd be happy too.

# [UPDATE #2]

So just an update (posting during locker break so I can't respond till later) cause some people are curious and are messaging me so here's like a mass update. I've been going to therapy with my mom every day on Fridays, but we hang out just the two of us for on Saturdays and Sundays. Like our first weekend together she took me to see Batman and the day after we went to Boston Pizza. Since then we've really just been going on walks and hikes or even shopping but I like that cause we get to talk a lot. And we talk on facetime every day. It really does feel like I've gotten her back as my mom and that's what I wanted. The best part is that when we hug now it's like we're actually hugging and before it was like I did it cause I had to and I guess it just feels so special. Like I don't know but I feel really happy, which I didn't before. I guess it was like I was missing something cause even my girlfriend has said that I seem a lot happier than before.

Therapy has been really weird. It's not at all what I thought it would be. Like before the first meeting my dad talked to the psychologist for like half an hour like he was interrogating her but then my mom and I had the session. It was like the psychologist was focused on that book and why it made my mom cry and everything. The sessions since then have been weird cause it's like I end up crying a lot so my mom always brings a bottle of Gatorade for me. My mom does end up crying too but she always tries to hide it and not show and when the therapist asked why she said cause she doesn't want her crying to influence what I'm saying or how I'm feeling. I still don't feel comfortable going alone even though the therapist has said it and my mom's said she'll take me and is going to start going on her own too but I just don't feel ready.

Oh and in therapy I did tell her I was worried that she was only doing all of this cause she wanted to bring me into her family and when she figured out it would never happen she would just choose her husband again and leave me for good. That made her cry a lot and she couldn't even hold it in and she was like it's cause she's finally starting to understand that I don't trust her and I might never trust her again and she's knows it's all her fault. She did promise me again though that I'd never have to see her husband and she'd only bring her daughters when I wanted and that she'd never let him stop her from going to my graduations and my wedding. When she kinda calmed down she did say that the only time I'd have to deal with him was at her funeral but I don't want to think about that. I don't want to write too much about what happened in therapy but I guess I kind of felt like I should share that.

Easter was the best holiday I've had in a while even though I didn't go anywhere. My mom's husband took their kids to see his parents and she stayed behind. We spent so much time that weekend together for part of it I kind of felt like a little kid again. I even got to properly introduce her to my girlfriend and to my girlfriend's mom and we all had Easter dinner together. Like my mom made the turkey and it was amazing I didn't know how much I missed it but it tasted exactly like it did when I was little.

And I did finally admit to her that my grandparents aren't coming back from Italy and that's why I was feeling so down recently. I also admitted that dad and his fiancee are going to move to Catania after I graduate and are going to stay there and that I'll probably go to university in Catania and Palermo. She was sad and she did admit she didn't want me to go cause I'd end up moving Summer next year and that's not that far away and she probably wouldn't see me in person at all. But she did say she'd support me no matter what I chose. And a lot of our sessions since then have kind of focused on me going to university there.

Yesterday on Mother's Day her husband went to see his parents again and my mom and I were already going to a restaurant called Cactus Club together. I didn't know if he was taking their kids and if he wasn't I know I would've felt bad if they didn't get to celebrate Mother's Day with her too so I said she could bring them. I don't really know the girls that well but it was still a good time. My mom brought her camera with her cause she hates using the one on the phone and she got our waitress to take a photo of all of us together at the end. I did have the waitress take the photos again on my phone so I could send them to her and she could have them on her phone.

I guess that's another update for everyone who was asking. I don't mind updating and I like talking to the people who comment her or on that repost subreddit, but I'm going to tell my mom I've been posting. If she says I can keep posting then I will but if she tells me to stop, then this is the last one.

# [UPDATE #3]

So, I guess to give an update, my exams are all done and it's summer break now. But, I got into AP English! I got two lists of books from my teacher cause he wants us to read them over the Summer to be prepared. On one list it's books like Wuthering Heights, the Great Gatsby, Moby Dick and Frankenstein and he said we absolutely should read through those since we'll be choosing two of them to do essays and stuff on. On the other list, it's just a giant list of books that he recommends reading to be prepared. It's a really big list and of course, Anna Karenina is on the list. My girlfriend saw that and was like well good thing you already bought that one.

Anyway, cause my mom knows all those books, I gave her the lists before we went to our therapy session and she agreed to take me to Indigo or to some old bookstores to get me the best versions of them, cause some of them are translated from other languages. I still don't feel comfortable doing therapy without her. I don't know, I just don't think that I'm going to be able to speak up without her there. She's pushing me to do it but I just can't. Even she's done some sessions alone through Teams. But like if I do it alone and I end up crying I don't want the therapist to hug me and if it's at home I don't want my dad or his fiancee to wonder what's wrong.

My dad still doesn't like that I'm doing therapy. He actually had a really big fight with his fiancee about it cause when her niece and nephew move in, she's going to send them to therapy. He's like they shouldn't go cause they can't speak English and it might turn out like it did for him cause he couldn't speak English when he had to go as a kid. It sucked cause I got roped into it and my mom ended up being called and she threatened to pull the custody card on dad to make it clear I'd still be going with her. He did say sorry to me after and that he'll try and be more supportive and get over being scared.

Anyway, my mom bought me the Great Gatsby, Moby Dick and Frankenstein, cause she said that Wuthering Heights will probably bore me. And from the other list, she got me The Count of Monte Cristo, A Tale of Two Cities, Great Expectations and Catch-22. She also gave me the copy of Anna Karenina that I gave her and said she would like for me to read it cause it might help me understand why getting that hurt her so much but that if it gets too much, I can just give it back to her. I guess I can, I mean I saw the movie. How bad can it be?

And my mom also said that she wants to take me on a trip somewhere in August. Cause if I move to Italy with everybody next Summer, then we probably won't ever have a proper vacation again. I don't know if I want to go, but if it means so much to her then maybe I will. I just guess I'm scared that maybe her husband will end up coming even though she said that he won't.

I guess that's another update for whoever still cares. I'll keep posting as long as I have something I want to write about. I do like venting on here and since the therapist has recommended I continue, I guess I will.

# [UPDATE #4]

Didn't think I'd be posting again so soon, but I feel like writing something so why not.

Well, I have started reading the Summer reading list. The first one I read was Frankenstein cause I was most excited for it and it did not disappoint. I really liked that book, it was so good. I felt so bad for Frankenstein, like his brother, his brother's nanny and his wife didn't deserve to die just cause he was selfish. It made sense he was a modern Prometheus cause he can't be as good as Prometheus cause he lives in a more modern world. My girlfriend and I watched the Robert de Niro movie together and it was really good too but not as good as the book. I also read the Great Gatsby and it was good but not as good and have started Moby Dick.

As for Anna Karenina, I only read the first part. But I like it better than the movie so far. Anna isn't even the main character, that's a guy named Levin. And he's an interesting character, he's smart even though's a simple farmer. I liked all the thinking that he does, it makes him seem real even if the author writes dialogue or thoughts in a way that nobody would ever actually talk or think. What surprised me was how modern it was. There's stuff that tells you it's in the past like receiving guests or telegram or how to start a fireplace but there's also stuff like working in an office, how Levin works on a farm, a public skating rink, them just having coffee in the morning or going to a diner and ordering like it's modern day. I get it wasn't like that for poor people and that everybody in the book is pretty much rich (some of the characters know the emperor) but it's kind of like 1800s Russian rich is like today but with less rights for women.

I didn't like the Anna parts and I hate Vronsky, the guy she leaves her family for in the movie. I can't help but thinking of the stupid actor that played him in the movie too (I hate that actor, he's so lame, he's lame in everything I've seen him in and for some reason he's in everything too). He's a shitty guy who goes to brothels and tricks Kitty, the girl Levin loves, into thinking he'll marry her so he can bang her, pretends to love his mom cause she's a ho and when he meets Anna, the first thing he hears is how much she loves her son but starts trying to get her. It makes me mad, he knows she has a kid and thinks it's all right to go for her. He's not written as if he could be a real person either. What's weird is when Vronsky and Anna dance, the author writes Kitty's perspective to show her being humiliated but also to show those two fall in love. Then the chapters after are Anna's perspective but the author doesn't explain why they acted like that, just that Anna is attracted to him but is ashamed and Vronsky is in love. I hate Vronsky, she tells him no twice when she sees him after the ball but he keeps going after her. We have assemblys on how girls don't like guys who don't take no for an answer but the author's writes she does. He's such a stupid, stupid character. I hate this character so much and it's worse that he's played by the stupidest actor ever in that stupid movie. And then it's as if meeting him changed Anna so much she doesn't find her son as good as she imagined even though he's still the best thing in the world to her. Plus, Anna's husband isn't even bad, he's just sarcastic but he's not cheating and trusts her and the author says they love each other.

I actually had an argument with my mom cause she was said if I think Levin is the main character then Kitty is just as important and I'll see why the author needed to show the ball from her perspective and also cause it shows the effect of Anna's actions. But it's like the author needed them to fall in love and wrote Kitty's perspective cause it was too hard to write Anna so he tells us she falls in love and he leaves it to us to imagine why that happens. We ended up bringing the argument into therapy cause it got intense cause my mom wouldn't accept that I don't think the author is that good. And my therapist said I'm projecting people in my life onto people in the book and that just dovetailed into stuff about my dad not wanting me to go to therapy.

My dad's fiancee's niece and nephew moved in a few days before Canada Day. It's been weird having them around. They loved the Canada Day parade but they've been quiet and they cry a lot, like sometimes Giulia (dad's fiancee) has to sleep with them both. I've tried to be their friend, let them play on my PlayStation, play poker or basketball with them. I think they like my girlfriend more than me though cause I think they think she's famous. But it's hard cause they don't know English (even though they've been seeing a tutor) and when we speak Italian, I honestly don't know what they're saying half the time cause of their accent and I understand nothing when they speak Sicilian. I did bring them up in therapy once but mom seemed kind of sad and I guess it's cause I don't really know her kids at all so I haven't since.

As for therapy, my dad made Giulia promise not to let them go alone and he seemed really scared and acts so weird when they go. He's gotten into a few arguments about it with Giulia but she always shuts him down and one time she even called my grandparents. And he's been hugging me really tightly every time I go with my mom now or come back from it, has asked how much more I need to go and if I can stop soon and one time I think he was even crying when I came back but he tried to hide it from me. My mom told me to let her know if he says anything about stopping me again.

I guess the big thing is, my mom's not going to be working first two weeks of August, so she was like, she can take me on a trip that's just us to Kelowna or Kamloops or wherever then. But it has to be in the first two weeks cause she needs to start preparing for school reopening after that. The problem is that my dad's fiancee is going back to Italy in the beginning of August for her stuff about her sister's will and she asked me if I wanted to come cause she's like she'll show me the University of Palermo and the University of Catania and I can meet with advisors and stuff and I'll get to see my grandparents. My mom got really sad when I told her about that, I feel like she wanted to cry and she said she really wanted me to stay so we could have one last vacation. Like she said it a lot in a lot of different ways this weekend and kept telling me her husband wouldn't come along. So I don't want to let her down but I also really want to see my grandparents.

Wow, I wrote a lot more than I wanted to but I guess if anybody who comes here has any advice on if I should go with my mom or with Giulia, I'll take it.

# [UPDATE 5#]

So, I don't know how many people are still reading this, but it says that I have 44 messages in the chat icon, so that's something. The first thing I want to do is thank [u/Dustyrose-930](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dustyrose-930/) – you gave me a lot of support in our DMs back when I was active here, and it meant a lot to me. I don't know if your account is still active, but I hope it is so you know that the talks we had really did help me.

Now, the first thing I want to talk about is that there were some things which I lied about in my older posts because I guess I thought they made me seem cooler. Like at one point I wrote that I couldn't understand my stepmom's niece and nephew's accent when they spoke Italian. That was just not true and I don't know why I wrote that. I only had trouble when they spoke Sicilian. And reading those old posts, the thing that I see a lot is that I kept saying I don't speak at all to my mom's husband and pretty much implied that I just gave him the silent treatment whenever I was around him. That was a lie and was something I think I wrote because I thought it'd make me look like a badass or something. But it's just cringey looking back at it.

The truth is, he's always been friendly to me, and I was always a dick to him because I hated him for taking my mom and having to be around him when I wanted to be with her. The only time he was ever actually mean to me was when he called me an asshole for giving my mom the book. If I'm being honest, I still kind of hate him but not like I used to and maybe I really only hate the part of him that I think of when I remember my parents getting divorce. I don't know, it's hard to explain. When I moved to Italy with my dad, I really started missing my mom and I kept blaming him like, I would have spent more time with her when I was in Canada if it weren't for him. But now, I try not to let it bother me because I know that kind of thinking is just going to make me angry with my mom and I'm so tired of that now. I'll never love him or respect him like I do my stepmother, but no matter how I feel about him, he loves my mom, he really does make her happy and she loves him too.

Another thing is that I know I wrote about crying really badly a few times. But the truth is, I cried so much more than I wrote about, and I tried to avoid writing about whenever I did because I felt so embarrassed about it and hated myself for being honest about the times I did cry. Looking back, at most of those therapy sessions I went to with my mom or the hikes or when I told my mom I wanted to move to Italy or so many other things, something made me cry like a baby and I guess on here, I could reframe those things like I was calm and cool.

And then another thing is that I wrote about not wanting to go on a vacation with my mom because I wanted to go check out universities in Italy with my stepmom instead. The truth is that I really wanted to go with my mom, and it's another thing where I don't even remember why I was writing like I didn't because I did go with her and it was one of the best trips I've ever had.

My life has been good since I last posted. I have a plan for my future and I'm not angry and bitter and depressed anymore. My dad and my stepmom are officially married and he's the happiest that he's ever been with her. I love university, it's so much better than school and it honestly feels like this is the best thing ever at times. I'm still completely shit with Sicilian but everybody speaks Italian so it doesn't matter.

The reason I felt like writing this and just getting all these thoughts out is that my mom and her husband had another baby in August, and I flew in like a day after my mom got back from the hospital, and I stayed with them until I had to go back. So pretty much last night in Canada, my girlfriend visited my mom. And yes, this is the same girlfriend I had back when I made all those posts. We've made it work somehow even though we're worlds away. She took a picture with my new baby sister and sent it, and I only saw it when I woke up like an hour and a half ago, but it reminded me of all this and I felt like writing about it.

Reading that very first post back, I see how I mentioned so many times that the reason we stopped seeing each other beyond birthdays and at my games and events was because my sisters or her husband were always with her. It's funny because I know that at the time when I wrote that post that time seemed so much longer than it was. I didn't try to understand my mom and how hard it was for her to be away from my sisters with how small they were then. And it took her so long, maybe way too long to understand why I only wanted her but she did keep trying till she got it and I can appreciate that so much now. It's like the person I was who wrote that post expected perfection from my mom but wouldn't have been happy even if she gave it.

I remember how guilty I felt for making my mom cry because of that stupid book and so many people on this website pointed it out to me too. I still feel a little bit guilty but I can forgive myself just like I can forgive her for not being as perfect as I'd expected back then.

I guess what I want to say is that I wish I hadn't been so angry and sad back then and that I hadn't tried so hard to not enjoy time with my mom just because my stepfather and my sisters were there too. And I wish that I knew that having fun, even if he was involved, didn't mean that I was suddenly okay with what he did. And I wish that I saw all the times that my mom tried to be better after the divorce for me and try to make up for breaking up our family. And I wish that I knew that it was okay to be mad and act out because none of it was my fault and if I'd known that sooner then maybe I could have realized how I really wanted things to be sooner. Because I was really hurting myself by being so upset, and she could see it and that was hurting her. We have a way better relationship now, and I love spending time with her without giving any conditions because I really don't want to regret things anymore.

When I move back to Canada to get my master's, I am going to stay with her because I want her to be in my life, eat her dinner again, watch TV shows with her again, and be a family. And I know that it'll be different and better this time because I actually want it to be. If there's any advice I can give, it's just if you can make up for whatever regrets you have, then just do it.

And I guess the last thing I'll say is that I really fucking hated reading that book. If I could go back in time, then I would never give my mom the book, and I definitely think it'd be to scrub the memory of reading it out of my head. It was worse than the movie my girlfriend made me watch. Read *Frankenstein* instead if you can.",47,1764307661.0,BORUpdates,8,0.94,False

1p8ms5r,https://i.redd.it/li1xw1jaox3g1.jpeg,To all my smoker friends looking to quit,"I have been a regular smoker for more than 5 years. 

Since the starting days of my college, I have been a chainsmoker smoking more than 1 packet a day, some days almost 2 !! 

ChatGPT said, I am a pattern smoker, because of my extreme urges to smoke at night when I am up working late! 

I tried quitting many times. Not smoking in the day was easy, but it was near impossible at night! I tried vaping, chewing gums, tried joining gym to distract myself and that quitting method where you reduce cigarettes over time. 

None of them worked. The cravings were too much ! Recently I found about this product!! And I am telling you guys, this actually worked!! 😭


I started with strong varient of this nicotine pouch! It contained too much nicotine for me, and gave me headache, extreme nausea, and dizziness. But surprisingly, when I got those symptoms of nicotine overdose...... for some time, I didn't even feel like looking at a cigarette! The same feeling of nausea hit me so bad 🤢 It was like the first time I inhaled the cigarette smoke !! I continued using it for a while ! 

Now, I have started taking the one with medium nicotine content ! Now, this also feels too strong for me ! I rarely have cravings and sometimes I even forget to use a pouch ! 😆 I sometimes miss the feeling of a cigarette in my hands, especially when working and when having tea/coffee but its manageable ! 

Now, I haven't smoked for almost a month ! And I already feel so much better ! I have no coughs and no shortness of breath ! I can't be any happier !!

I want to recommend this product to all of my smoker friends, who wish to quit !! I am surprised how good this thing worked !! So, Please give it a try !!






TLDR: Use this nicotine product instead of vaping, it will help you with your cravings in the first few weeks till you are able to manage it. I have tried it myself, a chainsmoker who already started having some respiratory problems, and it worked surprisingly good !! 



PS : Please don't say using a nicotine product won't help you quit another nicotine product !! Nicotine is the least of your problems when you smoke a cigarette ! At the very least, this will help you prevent lungs disease.

Chapter 1 

For six years, Isabella Garcia loved her husband, Joseph Ashford. But out of the blue, he was struck by a strange illness—and the cure? He had to sleep with another woman ninety-nine times. 

The Ashford family has a century-old family creed: the head of the family must not marry a woman of humble birth. 

But Joseph defied tradition. He burned the ancestral tablets to marry Isabella, a pearl diver, adding her to the family tree overnight and rushing into their wedding the very next day.
For five years, he spoiled her, making her the most envied woman in Coastal Harbor.
But in the sixth year, Joseph was struck by a strange illness and fell into a coma. 

A mysterious master claimed it was an ancestral punishment. The only way to lift it was through a ritual marriage—where Joseph had to sleep with a ritual bride, Sophia Miller, ninety-nine times or fall into a coma again. 

From then on, Joseph slept with Sophia every night, telling Isabella to wait. 

Isabella could only kneel and pray for him, listening tearfully as he was intimate with another woman.
After seven days of kneeling, she returned home with a protective charm. Just as she was about to open the door, she overheard a conversation between Joseph and his friends. 

***** 

""Joseph, you're a genius. Faking an illness and making up a ritual marriage just to openly bring your little lover home to fool around.""
""Only someone from a humble background like Isabella would believe it. Everyone in Coastal Harbor know that our Joseph fears nothing, not even burning the ancestral memorial tablets? How could he possibly believe in some master and a ritual marriage?""
The blood in Isabella's body seemed to reverse its flow.
So Joseph wasn't sick at all; this was all his scheme! 

The protective charm clutched tightly in her hand suddenly felt scorching hot, as if it would burn right through her palm. 

His friend couldn't help but ask curiously: ""Joseph, you've slept with Sophia 90 times, right? Just 9 more times and the ritual marriage will be over. What are you planning to do then..."" 

Joseph leaned back on the sofa, his black shirt unbuttoned by two, his long legs crossed. 

He took a light sip of his drink and curled his lip nonchalantly: ""When it's over, I'll just keep her on the side."" 

Standing outside the door, Isabella felt a chill that pierced her to the bone. 

But his friends just laughed louder: ""We told you—men like us all have someone on the side. Don't be so naive.
You've been faithful to Isabella for five years, you've done right by her."" 

""A woman like Sophia, who looks innocent but has a wild side and no inhibitions in bed, is such a turn-on for men."" 

""By the way, Joseph, isn't she much more fun than Isabella?""
The glass slammed heavily on the table, and Joseph's drunken eyes suddenly turned sharp.
""No one can compare to Isabella. She will always be the one I love the most."" 

Everyone was stunned. 

After a long moment, a friend couldn't help but speak up, asking a question Isabella also desperately wanted to know: ""Joseph, if you love her, how could you bear to make her suffer by faking an illness?
I heard the Ashford family has given her a hard time these past three months, and Madam Ashford almost subjected her to family disciplinary punishment..."" 

The air was silent for a few seconds. 

Then, Joseph's deep voice came through— 

""The Ashford family is a clan with a hundred years of prestige. To enter my family, even the daughter from an old money family must undergo a test to prove her loyalty.
Back then, I made an exception and didn't make Isabella go through this formality, and the family has always had objections."" 

""Now, I'm using this ritual marriage affair to make up for it.""
She doesn't even fight or make a scene when I sleep with someone else, and even sincerely prays for me.” 

“That shows she's obedient and submissive enough, worthy of being part of the Ashford family.”
He let out a soft chuckle, his voice laced with a self-righteous tenderness: “As for the suffering she's endured for me, I'll make it up to her with a lifetime of devotion.” 

Those words pierced Isabella's heart like needles. 

She suddenly laughed.
As she laughed, tears streamed down her cheeks. 

Everyone in the Ashford family said that because she insisted on marrying into the family, Joseph was struck down by an ancestral punishment and fell ill.
For the past three months, she had lived every day amidst insults and condemnation. 

During the first few days of Joseph's coma, she was so heartbroken and cried so violently that she nearly lost sight in her right eye. She also developed a chronic ache in her heart, lying awake night after night.
When he was in bed with Sophia, she was kneeling before a cross, reciting the Rosary again and again, refusing to stop even when her fingers were rubbed raw and bleeding...
But it turned out... all of it was a lie! 

The ridiculous rules of a century-old prestigious family, the so-called necessary test of loyalty...
All of it was just a grand-sounding excuse! 

In essence, he just wanted to have his affair without restraint, while avoiding the judgment of his former self. 

Tears blurred Isabella's vision. She didn't understand how things had come to this. 

Joseph... he had loved her so genuinely, so clearly. 

Back then, to pay for her mother's medical treatments, she had given up college and started diving for pearls to earn money. It was then she'd accidentally saved Joseph, who had been seriously injured and fallen into the sea while being pursued. 

She took him home and cared for him for a month. To her surprise, Joseph fell madly in love with her and began to pursue her with passionate intensity. 

She didn't believe in true love from a wealthy family and rejected him time and again. But he was relentlessly persistent, refusing to give up, using all his patience and gentleness to slowly melt her frozen heart. 

What truly won her over was when Joseph shielded her from the sulfuric acid a competitor threw at her. A hideous scar was burned across his back, and though he was drenched in a cold sweat from the pain, he smiled and wiped away her tears: “As long as you're okay, that's all that matters.”
At their wedding, he knelt on one knee, held her hand, and vowed: “Isabella, I will love only you for the rest of my life. I will never let you suffer even the slightest bit of wrong.” 

The words still echoed in her ears, now a bitter irony. 

Isabella's tears had run dry, but the chatter and laughter in the living room continued. 

Suddenly, someone sighed. “Joseph, Isabella has been Mrs. Ashford for five years. She's no fool. Aren't you afraid that if she finds out about Sophia... she'll leave you?”
Joseph was silent for a moment, his Adam's apple bobbing. “Then we'll just never let her know. Keep your mouths shut.” 

His friend fell silent, but still asked cautiously, “What if she finds out... and wants a divorce?”
Joseph's lips curled into a smirk. “She loves me too much. How could she ever bear to leave me?”
“Besides, in all of Coastal Harbor, who would dare help her file for divorce without my consent?”
“And even if she did manage to run—” his gaze turned suddenly sharp, “I'd drag her back!
She's in the Ashford family tree. In this life, she's mine, in life and in death. She can only stay by my side.” 

Isabella's breath hitched, her nails digging deep into her arm. 

Joseph, you're wrong!
What makes you think I'd still love you after you've played me for a fool?
And what makes you think I can't leave you? 

Isabella wiped her tears and, without a moment's hesitation, threw the Protective charm in her hand into the trash. 

Then, she left without a word and did two things. 

First, she went to her mother and told her about Joseph's affair.
Isabella's mother sighed deeply after hearing the story. ""I was against you marrying into a wealthy family back then. He knelt before me for ten days and nights, refusing to leave even after the rain gave him a high fever that turned into pneumonia. He wouldn't go to the hospital until I gave him my blessing. I truly thought he was a good man, but I never expected... Isabella, Mom supports you. Let's leave together."" 

Second, she took her mother to begin the process of erasing their legal identity and changed her name.
Since Joseph said her name was in the family tree, and that she couldn't escape the Ashford family in life or death, she would make it so the person ""Isabella"" no longer existed in this world. 

The process of erasing one's legal identity would take half a month. Isabella told her mother to wait patiently. She had to return to the Ashford family first, stay by Joseph's side, and not let him suspect anything was wrong. 

Otherwise, with his methods, neither of them would be able to escape.
Isabella returned to the villa.
Unexpectedly, the moment she walked in, she saw a scene that felt like a blow to the head. 

Joseph was on top of Sophia, riding her on the sofa. And what Sophia was wearing—
was her wedding dress! 

Chapter 2 

The keys slipped from Isabella's hand, clattering to the floor.
Joseph frowned and turned his head. When he saw it was Isabella, he froze. 

He quickly buckled his belt and zipped up his pants. By the time he looked up again, any trace of panic was gone from his face, replaced by the calm composure of a man in power. 

""Isabella... why are you home?""
He asked with a smile.
Isabella's hand dug into her arm, pinching so hard it hurt.
After a long moment, she heard her own faint voice.
""Am I not allowed to come home now?""
Joseph chuckled. ""That's not what I meant. Weren't you at the church getting a protective charm for me?
Why are you back so suddenly?""
As he spoke, he raised his hand to stroke Isabella's hair, but she dodged him. 

Joseph's smile froze on his face. ""Are you angry?
Just because I let Sophia wear one of your dresses?"" 

""One... dress."" 

Isabella's voice trembled as she looked at Joseph in disbelief.
That was her most cherished wedding dress. She had sewn every single pearl on it by hand. Once, the first time she wore it, Joseph's eyes had been filled with awe. ""Isabella, you're so beautiful. This dress is worthy only of you.
From now on, you have to wear it for me every year.""
But now, he had let another woman wear it... and even do that kind of thing in it! 

Isabella stared intently into his eyes, searching for a hint of guilt, but all she saw was a glaring sense of ease. 

Her heart felt as if it had been violently squeezed, and the pain made it almost impossible for her to stand. 

Was Joseph so certain... that she was so desperately in love with him that she would tolerate anything he did? 

Joseph took a step forward, held Isabella's trembling hand, and softened his tone. ""Alright, don't be angry. I'll give you a hundred million. Go buy whatever you want.""
A flash of jealousy crossed Sophia's eyes. She suddenly knelt before Isabella, tears instantly welling up. ""Mrs. Ashford, I'm so sorry... It's all my fault. I just loved this wedding dress so much, and Mr. Ashford let me try it on...""
Though her words were an apology, every syllable stabbed at Isabella's heart, as if telling her: See how much he pampers me. 

Sophia shot Isabella a triumphant glance, then began to cry even harder, ""Mrs. Ashford, please don't be angry, I'll take it off and give it back to you right now...""
Isabella's gaze swept over the glaring stain on the hem of the dress, and she said lightly, ""It's already dirty. I don't want it. You can keep it."" 

Joseph frowned deeply, his voice grave, ""Isabella, don't be ridiculous. How can you just give away a wedding dress?""
Isabella curled her lip, just about to speak. 

Just then, Joseph's phone rang.
He glanced at the caller ID, then looked at Sophia.
Sophia immediately forced an understanding smile: ""Mr. Ashford, don't mind me. Go ahead and take it."" 

Joseph shook his head and said softly, ""You always get a headache when you hear me talk about business. I'll take this outside. Stop kneeling, get up first.""
With that, he stepped out.
Isabella stood frozen, her heart feeling as if it had been brutally pierced by a dull knife.
He never used to discuss business outside, as it involved trade secrets, but now he could even change that habit for Sophia,.
Only Isabella and Sophia were left in the living room. 

Sophia patted her dress and stood up, the weakness on her face instantly transforming into arrogant provocation. 

""You don't know, do you?
Joseph's strange illness was faked.""
She leaned in with a light laugh, ""It was all just to use the excuse of a ritual marriage to ward off misfortune, to bring me in legitimately."" 

""We've been together for over a year, we've tried everything. Just because I said I hadn't tried having fun at his home yet, he immediately got 'sick'..."" 

""Isabella, his body and heart are with me now. What do you have besides the title?"" 

Isabella gave her a cool glance, ""The title can be yours too."" 

Sophia froze, then grew furious: ""Who needs you to give it up!
He was mine to begin with!
The position you're occupying will be mine sooner or later!""
Seeing Isabella remain unmoved, she turned pale with anger. 

Just then, the sound of Joseph's approaching footsteps came from outside the door. 

A vicious look flashed in Sophia's eyes. She suddenly picked up the scalding hot teapot from the coffee table without hesitation, and smashed it against herself! 

""Ah—!"" 

A shrill scream rang out as Sophia staggered and fell to the ground, her fair chest scalded red and covered in blisters. 

She then struggled to crawl to Isabella's feet, crying and trembling: ""Mrs. Ashford, I was wrong, I shouldn't have worn your dress, please let me go...""
When Joseph rushed in, this was the scene that greeted him. 

His face darkened instantly. He narrowed his eyes at Isabella, ""I've already compensated you. How dare you still hurt her? Apologize to her!"" 

""I didn't do it. I won't apologize.""
Isabella said calmly.
""Making excuses, are you?""
A dangerous glint flickered in Joseph's eyes, ""Fine. I'll make you admit it."" 

Isabella was dragged to the sauna by bodyguards. 

The moment the glass door was locked, the hot air felt like countless fine needles pricking her skin. 

The needle on the thermometer climbed steadily. 

50°C... 

60°C... 

70°C... 

Isabella's face was flushed crimson, the steam making it hard for her to breathe. 

Joseph stood outside the door, toying with the wedding ring on his finger, and asked in a low voice, ""Still not admitting it?"" 

Isabella threw herself against the door, pounding on it desperately. Her palms sizzled from the heat, leaving bloody handprints on the glass that evaporated in an instant.
“It really wasn't me, Joseph!
Why don't you check the security footage?” 

She struggled in panic.
“No need. Sophia wouldn't lie to me. You, on the other hand, are becoming more and more disobedient.” 

Joseph didn't look up, asking again: “Will you admit you were wrong?”
Isabella's body trembled uncontrollably. Joseph's favoritism for his lover had actually reached this point. 

Her heart felt like it was tearing apart from the pain in the intense heat. She really couldn't take it anymore! 

“I admit it...” 

Her throat was cracked and dry as she rasped, forcing out the words and lying to him for the first time: “I was wrong.”
Joseph curled his lips in satisfaction, raising a hand slightly to signal the bodyguards to stop. 

Isabella was let out, drenched in sweat, her body temperature alarmingly high. 

Joseph looked at her wretched state, touching her chapped lips soothingly: “If you had just admitted your mistake earlier, you wouldn't have had to suffer.”
“You don't have to apologize to Sophia anymore, but—” His eyes darkened. “Don't let it happen again.” 

Her vision darkened. Isabella's body went limp and she collapsed. The burned skin on her body stung fiercely, but the pain in her heart was even worse. 

Tears streamed down her face uncontrollably. 

She had a congenital heart condition; it was already a miracle she had lived this long.
Before, Joseph used to be so worried about her, not even letting the servants make a sound for fear of startling her. 

He once held her and said: “You are my life. I can't let you get hurt in any way.” 

But now, he had locked her in a room with life-threatening heat that could kill her at any moment.
It turned out that promises were only real the moment they were spoken. 

Chapter 3 

Leaning against the wall, Isabella stumbled her way upstairs.
As soon as she entered her room, she pulled out everything related to Joseph. 

The photos and love letters she once treasured, the postcards bought on their trips together...
She picked up an old sketchbook, and her movements suddenly froze.
It was something Joseph had drawn by hand, chronicling every step of their love story.
The first page: their first meeting by the sea. She had saved a blood-soaked Joseph, and he had fallen for her at first sight. 

The tenth page: the first time he took her to the Ashford family home. Joseph's mother had told her to enter through the doggy door. She had turned and left, but Joseph chased after her, apologizing over and over: “Isabella, it's my fault. I didn't protect you. I let you be wronged. I promise it will never happen again.” 

That time, he sent his mother to a mountain retreat for half a year.
The twentieth page: he announced in front of the entire clan that he would marry her. Grandfather Ashford dragged him to the ancestral hall, warning him that if he violated the family creed, he should beware of ancestral punishment. 

Isabella would never forget that day. Joseph had sneered, throwing the ancestral memorial tablets into the fire and declaring in front of everyone: “I'm the head of the family now, so I make the rules. What do the ancestors matter?”
But now... 

He was using “ancestral punishment” as an excuse to bring his lover into their home. 

Isabella clutched the sketchbook tightly, suddenly remembering Grandfather Ashford's warning before their marriage:
“My grandson only likes obedient dogs. If you want to stay by his side, you have to be willing to be a good dog!” 

At the time, she hadn't believed it, thinking Grandfather Ashford was just trying to scare her and break them up. 

Now, she was beginning to understand. Joseph was the one in power; he only liked puppets who would obey him absolutely and depend on him forever.
And she, Isabella, would be no one's possession! 

Without another moment of hesitation, she threw everything into the fireplace. 

The moment she turned, she slammed right into Joseph's deep gaze.
He stared at the dancing flames, his voice devoid of emotion:
""What are you burning?"" 

Isabella lowered her eyes, her voice faint. ""Just some things I don't want anymore."" 

Joseph nodded casually, taking out a first-aid kit to treat her wound. ""You see? Even after punishing you, your husband still dotes on you the most, coming to treat you himself.""
His hands were warm and dry, his movements gentle, but every inch of skin he touched felt bone-chillingly cold. 

""Isabella, it's your mother's birthday in three days, . I plan to throw a grand celebration, inviting all the elites of Coastal Harbor.""
Isabella said faintly, ""There's no need. My mother doesn't like those kinds of occasions."" 

""No."" 

Joseph gently ruffled her hair, but his tone left no room for refusal. ""Be good. I must let everyone see just how much I spoil you.""
Isabella lowered her eyes, feeling no gratitude, only exhaustion.
Three days later. 

The banquet was held at the largest hotel under the Ashford group, and nearly all of Coastal Harbor's high society was in attendance.
""Mr. Ashford spoils Mrs. Ashford so much, spending billions on his mother-in-law's birthday!""
""Mr. Ashford is truly the perfect man. I'm so jealous of Mrs. Ashford!"" 

""..."" 

Everyone was discussing how much Joseph doted on his wife.
But in a corner, Isabella's mother looked at the burn on Isabella's hand, her eyes red-rimmed. ""My daughter, you've suffered. Just hold on for another half a month, and Mom will take you away."" 

Isabella's nose tingled, and she desperately wanted to cry, but fearing Joseph would notice something was wrong, she tilted her head back, forcing the tears to retreat. 

Joseph took a call, then walked towards them. 

""Isabella, Sophia said she wants to come celebrate your mother's birthday too..."" 

""I don't want to see her.""
Isabella said coldly. 

Joseph's brow furrowed. ""Don't make a scene. She's already on her way. Don't you give her a hard time later."" 

With that, he turned and left, his gaze fixed on the entrance, not sparing Isabella another glance.
Isabella stood there, stunned, her heart feeling as if a piece had been brutally gouged out. 

Isabella's mother couldn't bear to watch anymore and pulled her out to the terrace. 

The night wind was biting, bone-chillingly cold. 

Isabella's motherpicked up a coat and draped it over her. ""Daughter, look, the moonlight is beautiful tonight. It will probably be a sunny day tomorrow."" 

Isabella said softly, ""I hope so...""
Before the words had even faded, a rush of hurried footsteps approached. 

Joseph's face was dark, and he seized her wrist, his grip so tight it nearly crushed her bones. ""Sophia has gone missing. Did you kidnap her? 

Speak! 

Where is she?"" 

Isabella's face turned pale with pain, but she straightened her back and met his gaze. ""It wasn't me.""
Joseph stared at her for a few seconds, then gave a cold smile. ""Fine. You won't admit it, will you? I'll make you talk!"" 

The cruelty that flashed in his eyes sent a chill down Isabella's spine.
Immediately after, he ordered sharply, ""Get me someone in here!
Take her mother away!"" 

Bodyguards immediately stepped forward and began to drag Isabella's mother out forcefully. 

""Joseph, let my mother go!
Where are you taking her?""
Isabella tried to stop them frantically, but the man held her wrist in a death grip. 

No matter how she struggled and cried out, Joseph didn't loosen his grip in the slightest. 

In the opulent banquet hall.
Isabella was forced to her knees on the cold marble floor. 

Joseph leaned back on the leather sofa, his long legs crossed. He took a slow drag from his cigarette, and through the swirling smoke, his cold voice emerged. 

""Where is Sophia?"" 

Isabella shook her head numbly.
She couldn't remember how many times Joseph had asked her this. But she hadn't done it. She really didn't know. 

Joseph stood up, stubbed out his cigarette, and forced Isabella's chin up. ""You're so disobedient.""
He beckoned with a finger. A bodyguard leaned over and handed him a phone, on which he played a video.
In the video, Isabella's mother was tied to a chair with a time bomb strapped to her chest. The numbers on the countdown timer ticked down relentlessly. 

Chapter 4 

Joseph's tone was deceptively gentle, but his gaze was as sharp as ice. ""Isabella, I'm only giving you a final fifty minutes.""
Isabella's face turned deathly pale.
She asked, trembling, ""If I can't find Sophia, will you really kill my mom?"" 

He leaned in close, his dark pupils reflecting her trembling form. ""You can try me."" 

Isabella shuddered, and the tears she had been holding back for so long finally streamed down.
""Joseph, that's my mother! She's the most important person to me! 

You can't do this to her!""
He let out a soft chuckle, but his eyes were terrifyingly cold. ""But Sophia is the most important person to me, too."" 

""The most important?"" 

Isabella looked at him in disbelief. ""More important than me and my mom?""
Joseph's expression didn't change. ""Sophia gave me her first time. The poor girl offered herself in a ritual marriage to ward off misfortune and save me. I owe her a debt. 

As for you, you will always be the one I love most. 

How many times have I told you? I was going to send her away after the ritual marriage was over. Couldn't you just wait? 

Did you have to go after her?""
Isabella stared at Joseph, a bone-chilling cold spreading through her chest. 

The one he loved most?
Would the man who loved her most fake an illness for his mistress, deceive her, and even threaten to kill her mother? 

Isabella had no patience to play along with his act. She was just about to expose his lies.
Suddenly, a bodyguard burst in, shouting, ""Mr. Ashford, we've found Ms. Miller!"" 

Joseph grabbed his suit jacket and headed for the door. 

""What about my mom?"" 

Isabella lunged forward, desperately grabbing his pant leg. ""Let her go!""
Joseph glanced back over his shoulder, his gaze cold. ""The abandoned warehouse in the east district. Go find her yourself.""
Isabella bolted out the door like a madwoman, speeding all the way to the east district. 

When she found her mother, she saw the bomb on her was still counting down! 

Joseph hadn't even sent anyone to disarm it! 

The ticking of the timer sounded like a death knell. There was only one minute left! 

Isabella ripped the tape from her mother's mouth and tried to untie the ropes with trembling hands, but she couldn't get them loose.
""Daughter, forget about me! You have to go—"" Isabella's mother shook her head frantically. 

Tears streamed down Isabella's face in panic. ""Mom, I won't leave you..."" 

Suddenly, Isabella's mother shoved her away with all her might, kicked her feet hard against the ground, and threw herself backward, chair and all—
Isabella let out a heart-wrenching scream: ""Mom—!"" 

A deafening explosion erupted, and the blast wave threw her violently through the air. 

Isabella crashed hard onto the ground, her vision filled with nothing but red. 

The hospital. 

Isabella's mother was critically injured. Although she had survived, she might never wake up. 

Isabella knelt by the hospital bed, tears streaming down her face: ""Mom, I'm so sorry, this is all my fault..."" 

She apologized over and over, but the person on the bed never responded. 

Isabella's heart ached as if it were being torn apart. 

Just a few hours ago, her mother had been smiling, holding her hand tightly, and comforting her in a soft voice. 

But now, she could only lie here, completely still. 

And all of this was caused by the man who claimed to love her!
Isabella cried until her voice was hoarse, finally passing out completely. 

When she opened her eyes again.
Isabella found her hand being held. Joseph was by her bedside, his voice incredibly soft:
""I'm sorry, Isabella, it was all a misunderstanding. Sophia's phone just died, that's why she was unreachable."" 

""I acted rashly."" 

Isabella coldly pulled her hand back, a wave of icy sarcasm washing over her heart.
This was the man who said he loved her most? 

Just because Sophia didn't answer her phone, he kidnapped her mother without even checking! 

""Isabella, don't be angry. After all, you've targeted her before, that's why I suspected you..."" Joseph's eyes were red, his voice low and hoarse. ""Why don't you hit me, or curse me, anything you want..."" 

Bang— 

The hospital room door was suddenly pushed open, and Sophia burst in, her eyes swollen like peaches: ""Mrs. Ashford, it's all my fault, please don't blame Mr. Ashford..."" 

She fell to her knees, weeping gracefully: ""If only I had charged my phone in time, Mr. Ashford wouldn't have been so worried about me that he kidnapped your mother, and she wouldn't be in this state..."" 

Isabella's nails dug fiercely into her palm. Sophia was clearly here to provoke her! 

Just as she was about to throw them out, she saw Joseph bend down to help Sophia up, his tone gentle: ""This has nothing to do with you. Stop crying, it's not good for you.""
Watching this scene, Isabella's heart felt cold and bitter. 

How ironic. Her mother had almost died and was still unconscious from serious injuries, yet he was worried about another woman ""crying.""
""Get out!"" 

Isabella's voice was hoarse. ""Both of you, get out!""
Joseph was stunned: ""Isabella...""
""Get lost!"" 

She suddenly grabbed the vase from the bedside table and smashed it violently on the floor.
Joseph stood up. ""Isabella, calm down first. I'll make it up to you in a few days."" 

With that, he left, shielding Sophia as he went. 

The moment the door closed, Isabella could no longer hold back and burst into tears. 

She didn't want any compensation...
She didn't want anything, only for her mother to open her eyes and look at her one more time

1p8movl,https://www.reddit.com/r/redscarepod/comments/1p8movl/theres_no_logical_reason_for_the_norm_of_men/,There’s no logical reason for the norm of men paying for dates/financially providing more in hetero-relationships existing in the year 2025.,"Holiday gender war slop.  

I (29F) have never been on a date/been in a relationship and have no desire to do such.  However, as a single woman in her late 20s, I am often served content about dating as it seems to be a common topic for women my age who I may otherwise have similar interests to.  One opinion that seems to be prevalent amongst straight women of all political backgrounds and socioeconomic statuses is that men should be paying for the first date and generally providing more financially in a relationship.  Ultimately, people can choose to require whichever standards they want in a relationship (I know this sub seems to lean trad at times), but I think what bothers me about this take is that it is often framed in a way that it is actually FEMINIST and you are a pick-me if you disagree.  This surprises me because women who I would otherwise consider progressive even agree with this perspective.  If you want a man to pay for your dates/life, fine I guess.  But the constant justification of this choice being the only logical option is what I find ridiculous and every single rationale for this opinion can be so easily debunked.

1. Women spend more time/money getting ready for a date, so it only makes sense that a man should pay. — ….just don’t spend as much time getting ready if you think it is so inefficient and expensive??  As I said, I do not date, but I have no issue going to work/out to dinner with friends/concerts without makeup on.  Usually when I wear makeup, it’s more graphic, high-fashion makeup that I like to do for my creativity that men would hate anyway.  I would imagine I also would have no issue not wearing makeup to a date.  Men also spend time showering, brushing their hair, general hygiene to appear presentable for a date and women can easily just complete the same bare minimum getting ready process.  This, to me, just seems to perpetuate a stereotype that women are required to spend time beautifying themselves for a man’s affection and that is just a relationship that I would never want to be a part of anyways. 

2. Men make more historically than women, so men should pay for dates. — From a macro perspective, yes men as a collective make more than women as a collective.  However, this is not true in individual relationships.  Most of my friends make about the same amount of money as their partners and most people tend to date individuals with a similar socioeconomic status.  

3. If a man is not going to pay, I could just go out with my friends. — But your friends would not be paying for you either??  The amount of money that you would spend going out with a man and paying for your portion versus going out with friends and paying your portion would be the same.  Of course, hanging out with pre-existing friends has a higher guarantee of a fun time as opposed to hanging out with a stranger.  However, with this logic, you would never meet any new friends either because it is always more risky to be awkward hanging out with a stranger.  This reason just screams that you are looking for a “provider” or a “free meal” rather than a legitimate connection.  

4. If a man asked me on a date, then he should pay. — Again, this logic is never followed in any other connection.  If I meet a friend at an activity group/work and they ask me if I want to hang out and get coffee, it is never implied that they are paying for me.  I would also never expect them to pay for me. Ultimately, even if both people have a genuine interest in hanging out, someone has to formally ask.  I just do not see the logic that asking someone out to grab lunch/dinner/do an activity, would lead to the implication that they are paying as this implication never seems to extend to friendship.  The goal is to find, not only a romantic partner, but someone you like on a friend level in dating (at least that’s what I would think) so the fact that the expectations in hetero dating are so different than friendship expectations is so odd to me.  

5.  Women provide more emotional labor and men benefit more from relationships generally, so men should provide the financial component. — Similar to wearing makeup….just don’t provide the emotional labor or only date guys who also are providing a similar amount of emotional labor.  Maybe it’s just the tism but I would never enter into a situation that is inherently disadvantageous to me.  I also am inherently not someone who is particularly tidy or skilled at providing emotional support (again likely tism) so it would be quite unlikely for me to find myself in a situation where I am constantly doing substantially more housework and providing more emotional support than anyone (including a male partner).  I think this is a case of some women just wanting a relationship so desperately that they are willing to settle for a partner that they do not particularly connect with emotionally.  Therefore, they only way to justify the situation to themselves is that a man is providing financially.

7. Women are putting themselves in a risky position anytime they go on a date, so the least he can do is pay.  — If you seriously are putting yourself in danger to go out on a date, you definitely should not be going out.  Obviously there’s a minor risk anytime you meet up with someone you do not know well, but take general safety precautions and, if the situation really seems strange, do not go.  I would never risk my safety just to go out with a stranger and this reason is utterly ridiculous.  

8. If a man was going out with Megan Fox or Tate McRae, he would pay.  — This reason actually makes the most logical sense to me, but it is still kind of sad.  I guess I can understand the ideology of utilizing the willingness to pay for a date as a barometer for interest, but the idea that a man would pay for a woman that he truly likes is still rooted in the patriarchal ideology that women are a prize to be bought and the worthiness of said prize is judged by beauty.  I personally can not subscribe to that ideology, but this is the only reason that I can somewhat understand.

Also, before someone says it, I’m not a guy—just an indifferent f*mcel.  I also think that a lot of men on both sides of the political spectrum believe that men should pay (both Charlie Kirk types and lib guys on tiktok) so I do not even think that’s a valid accusation.  Also, do whatever you want in your relationship, I just genuinely love late night holiday discourse.  ",37,1764307292.0,redscarepod,22,0.7,False

This morning I woke up, walked into my kitchen, and realised I had way too many knives. I've essentially whittled my kit down further and further over the past few months, and as a result have a bunch of knives that are sitting in my cabinet, and not being used.

[**ALL PHOTOS ARE HERE**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19p1ZDZCaOK-obQ1T2yLRrbWVUE7GsQe7?usp=drive_link) \- forgive me but i took 60+ so this was the easiest way



**Hatsukokoro Shirahama Petty 110mm - $70**

* Bought [here ](https://www.kitchenknifeforums.com/threads/hatsukokoro-shirahama-110-petty-90.72061/)on KKF for $90, put a coffee patina on it, used to cut a single bell pepper and then realised it wasn’t for me
* Never sharpened/honed (By me)
* 61g, 113mm heel to tip, 23mm heel height



**Hitohira Futana Nakiri 165mm - $110**

* Bought at tosho for $155, used to prep maybe 3 meals at home - i’m just not a rectangle guy at the end of the day (unless menikiri’s count as rectangles? Questions for ARM…)
* Never sharpened
* 154g, 166m tip to heel length, 51mm heel height





**Shigeki Tanaka VG10 Damascus Kiritsuke 240mm - $230**

* Bought on sugicutlery a couple years back for $300, early on into my knife collecting journey. Full disclosure, there is a decently sized scrape along the damascus finish, purely cosmetic - the result of attempting to use a tojiro sharpening clip to guide my sharpening as i was learning.
* Sharpened twice - once by me when i was very inexperienced, and once by a professional to… adjust my attempt at sharpening. used for 20+ meals at home
* 213g, 235mm tip to heel, 52.5mm heel height



**Masashi Blue #1 Stainless clad Gyuto 210mm w/ Saya - $230 - On hold**

* This knife is wicked sharp - just ask the giant portion of my knuckle that it took off! Bought right here on KKF from Millertime a few years back for $250 but I got fleeced by customs to the tune of another $88 dollars, so the price reflects that. Comes with a fitted saya that’s slightly dinged on the black finish from bumping into a bronze fish scaler, but that’s purely cosmetic damage to the exterior
* Never Sharpened, used for about 3 days in a professional environment before “the incident” happened. Untouched since.
* 173g, 206mm heel to tip, 49mm heel height.



**Oul Sakai 170mm Deba - $50**

* Bought at knifewear for \~$100. Used a 4 times- on 2 branzino, a mackerel, and some very questionable salmon. tip got a bit bent and it got some microchips. The tip is still very slightly bent, but it doesn’t affect performance. Reflected in the price.
* Single bevels are just not for me, as this knife very quickly taught me
* Sharpened/microchips repaired by knifewear, so sharpened once.
* 151g, 153mm heel to tip, 43mm heel height



**Hideo Kitaoka 210mm Shirogami Matsuba - $210**

* Bought at knifewear for $265 - “but superlougat” you ask, “didn’t you just say single bevel knives weren’t for you?” - to that i say yes, and also, how dare you point out my terrible spending habits.
* Never sharpened, used to cut \~300g of Tuna, and one sous-vided pork tenderloin
* 148g - i forgot to take the other exact measurements, will do on request.

**Sakai Kikumori Kikuzuki Kasumi Kiritsuke Yanagiba 270mm - $280**

* Whoops. Looks like I did it again. Another single bevel I don’t use (I swear, this is the last one). This knife was a bit of a polishing project that I abandoned halfway through, as is pretty clearly visible. Bought for $360 at knifewear
* Sharpened, polished (poorly) and sitting in my drawer. Used to cut a couple test items (apples, oranges) and then never really used again
* 178g, 263mm tip to heel, heel height of 33mm.



**Tsunehisa 135mm Damascus Petty ZA-18 w/ custom zebrawood handle - $110**

* My first japanese petty knife - i’ve since outgrown it and switched to a combination of a 210mm petty and a bird's beak for all my small knife needs at work. Bought for $165 from sugicutlery
* Never sharpened, used for about 6 meals at home, mostly in hand peeling.
* 57g, 134mm heel to tip - forgot to measure heel height, can do later



**Masakage Kumo 75mm Petty w/ Saya - $120**

* Bought from Knifetoronto for $150, used on maybe 3 bunches of rapini before I decided it wasn’t for me, and that maybe i’d like it at some point in the future. That was 2 years ago.. Beautiful knife but just not my jam. Comes w/ saya that i bought separately at knifewear for \~$30 if i remember correctly.
* Never sharpened.
* 56g, 74mm heel to tip, 26mm heel height



Ok now we’re getting into sentimental territory, some of these guys are a little difficult for me to let go, but we do so anyway in the name of anti-hoarding!



**Tsunehisa AS 240mm Gyuto - $180**

* My very first japanese knife, the one that kicked off all this hoarding… Used a grand total of 1 time. It was wicked sharp (still is) and I knew the profile wasn’t for me, but it was a gift that sent me down the rabbit hole. Bought at knife toronto, and i’m guess-timating at the price because it’s no longer available on their website.
* Never sharpened, used once to cut about 5 potatoes for an incredibly oversalted attempt at potato rosti.
* 169g, 241mm heel to tip, 47mm heel height

**Takeshi Saji 210mm Shinchu Damascus Gyuto - $390**

* Bought for $475 at knifewear, this thing is honestly a piece of beauty, and has some crazy edge retention. I love it, i’m sad to see it go, but with the amount of cutting i do at work, the surface texture of the knife itself doesn’t collaborate well with some scar tissue on my fingers from the aforementioned “masashi incident”. Comes w/ wooden kiri box
* Never sharpened, used for about 3-4 weeks in a professional environment with occasional touch ups on a ceramic honing rod.
* 148g, 210mm heel to tip, 47.5mm heel height

**Itsuo Doi 210mm Homura Kogetsu w/ fitted saya - $430**

* Bought at knifewear for $515, and wow this is a hefty piece, with a really interesting profile. Sadly, also the profile that made me realise I do not like heavy rock chopping. Bit of an expensive lesson, but oh well - If i could trade this for his “Homura Guren” line, I would love to, it looks a lot more my style.
* Never sharpened, used for 2 dinners at home, and to cut a case of baby gem lettuce at work.
* 214g, 190mm heel to tip because of the swept heel, 50mm heel height

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/s/CYBaVfppA2): **November 13, 2025**

As the title might imply, I work as a cake decorator for a small grocery chain in the Midwest. I’ve been doing this job for over ten years. I’m self taught, but I’m good at what I do and I’ve got the photo portfolio to prove it. I’m known for my skill at freehand design on cakes, so customers often come to the store and ask for me specifically for custom designs. I have a few regulars who buy several cakes designed by me per year, so I have a cemented reputation for quality cake designs.

But I’m also overwhelmed in my work volume and need help. Note, there are conversations happening, but I’ll be paraphrasing a bit since I remember the gist, but not the actual wording. This all happened about a month ago.

In comes a boy. Let’s call him Jake. Jake is fresh out of college and looking to make some side money while he builds his web design business. Understandable and even admirable. After all, entrepreneurship is hard and successful businesses don’t form overnight. I’m a little surprised since male cake decorators are a bit of minority for some reason (no joke, in ten years of this I’ve only ever met two other male decorators)

I start training Jake in the basics of crumb coating and main coats so I can focus on the actual decorating. I’m also training him on filling the display case, labeling, dating, marking out, slicing bread for the actual bakery, etc. the one thing I ask him not to do unless I’m absent is taking cake orders because I have a specific way I like it done. Because I do a lot of free handing, I like to add as much detail as is physically possible on the order sheet and draw a sketch in the back of the paper so the customer can get the best image to match their vision. Obviously if I’m not there, whoever is asked will take the order and if it’s something complicated, I’ll just call the customer.

Jake told me he understood and when his training was done, we started working.

I started to notice a few issues. Now I’m aware that since Jake was a student of code and internet, he’s not gonna be the world’s greatest baker or decorator. I get that this is just a job for him whereas it’s a career for me and he’ll probably only be here a year or two depending on the growth of his business.

But Jake started acting weird. For one, he started bossing the other bakers around. When one of the newer girls labeled a whole batch of bread wrong, Jake snapped at her to do it again and do it right. Yes, she’d put the wrong labels on, but I could see her tearing up from his scolding.

Next, I came in one morning after a day off and Jake had changed around the entire display case. Normally I wouldn’t care, but we have a planogram to follow from the store indicating a standard they wanted to see and if a district manager came in and saw this, I’d get hosed since I’m the decorator and it’s my responsibility. When I confronted him on this, he told me he thought it looked better this way. I’ll admit that some of it made sense, but he’d stacked all the sheet cakes on the top shelf, crowding them and making it difficult for the customers to see the designs. He’d also put the ready made cakes all in a corner and piled all the single serve desserts in the whole bottom shelf, pulling out about three times more inventory than was necessary and forcing me to pull it all back into the freezer. This process took about an hour. I forced him to finish while I checked my orders.

The blood in my veins froze when he told me “Oh, they’re done already. I finished them yesterday morning.”

“What?” I went and checked the cooler and sure enough, all nine cakes ordered the week before sat on the shelf.

And they all looked like absolute horse crap. I hadn’t trained him on the decoration portion of the job Bexause A: that’s my job and B: he’d only been there a week at that point and it takes time to learn this stuff. He knew enough at this point to write (sufficiently) on a cake, do basic coating and basic borders. He didn’t know how to do literally anything else. I had to scrape all nine cakes and rush four of them in under two hours to meet their pickup times that afternoon and evening. That’s a lot of frosting waste, and I was starting to get annoyed.

I wasn’t the only one. Jake was annoyed that I’d ruined “his” cakes. He told me “I took my time, they looked so good!”

“They did not look good, and I can’t send them out like that.” I told him.

“Look, don’t blame me because you’re too slow.” He said.

Now, I’m just the decorator. I don’t have the clout to fire anyone and I could quickly see Jake was just being an idiot. He didn’t know what he was doing and anyone with eyes could see that. But boy was I getting pissed with him.

I was too busy remaking the cakes he botched and filling some new orders that came in online so I let his BS slide. I told Jake to go help a customer at the bread counter.

For a couple of days after that, things seemed normal and Jake appeared to have calmed down. I chalked his outburst up to stress, but I was keeping an eye on him. I was helping slice a huge order or bread that was overloading the bakers when I saw Jake helping a customer. I recognized her as one of our regulars, a woman who could be a bit prickly if her orders weren’t done to her exact specifications.

He showed her something on his phone and then I saw him take out an order form. He filled it out, showed the customer and then he stuck the form in my folder. I waited until he was doing something else before I went and checked it.

He’d taken an order for a type of cake we ABSOLUTELY cannot do in a retail setting. Think a three tier specialty flavored wedding cake with fondant and hundreds of flowers and edible glitter, a cake the price of which would factor in the hundreds and which I did not have the supplies, facilities, equipment, or even the pricing for in our computer. Now I stress again, I’m aware the kid is a web developer, not a baker or decorator. However he was well aware by this point that we can’t do cakes like this. And he even wrote that the customer asked for me specifically.

I immediately confronted him again and told him this is not a cake I can do. He actually smirked at me and said, no joke, “Ah, so you actually CANT do this kind of cake. Want me to do it for you?”

Now, I actually COULD do this cake. Just not in a retail setting where we don’t even have a price sticker for it. I asked him what his problem was, what was with the attitude.

“I think I deserve some more credit for all the work I’ve done to help you.” He said.

I told him “Jake, I trained you in the basics of running a bakery and frosting cakes to take some of the volume off. I did not train you to decorate cakes yet. You just don’t know what you’re doing yet, and the cakes you did the other day made more work for me. If you want to learn, I’ll teach you when I have time. But for now, please stop trying to do my job for me and focus on what I taught you to do.”

I left him and went to go phone the regular and pray she was in a good mood to accept that I couldn’t do this kind of cake. (Yeah, she wasn’t happy and I wound up having to promise her a discount)

I felt I was being reasonable with Jake. I guess I was wrong because he suddenly got a LOT worse.

Roughly a day or two after that incident, I came in one morning and not only was Jake not there, but he done all my orders from the previous evening, AGAIN. And again, they looked horrible. And AGAIN, I had to scrape and redo them. He’d also crumb coated literally every single round cake base we had and stacked them mass production style on a rack in the freezer. So now I had zero round blanks and a crap ton of crumb coated rounds in a single flavor. BIG issue. I had to order four more boxes of rounds.

Jake also harassed that newer baker girl again, this time to the point of full on tears after he deemed her “Happy Birthday Ryan” wasn’t good enough on the cake she was asked to write on.

Jake has even tried reporting me to the manager, complaining that I’m discriminating against him because he’s black. (I’m not sure if he is or isn’t, really, his skin is kind of olive toned? Either way I never said anything about his ethnicity so I’m not sure where this is coming from)

He’s driving me insane. All of what I’ve mentioned has happened over a period of about three and a half weeks. When he’s good, he’s very good. When he’s bad, he’s the devil in a blue ball cap.

So that brings me to today and I’m frazzled, fried and tired as hell. All I have is word of mouth on his antics and my managers aren’t exactly cordial when it comes to employee squabbles and have made it more than clear they’d rather us settle it out of court so to speak. It’s a small franchise of like three stores so there isn’t really an HR I can go to. Any advice?

Edit: Hooooooly shit, this blew up. Okay, I just got through reading the comments and wow, seriously that was a LOT to go through. Firstly, I truly appreciate the advice and support I got for this and what should be done. I’ll address a few common points since I can’t possibly answer all these.

**Point one is short and sweet:** I’m not a bot, this isn’t AI, I just go into a shit ton of detail. I’m autistic, sue me, it’s what I do. To the best of my knowledge, AI generally can’t swear, so the word shit shouldn’t be possible lol. I could be wrong about that, but I am a real person. I know my account is new, I came here looking for advice, it’s my first Reddit account. Nice to meet you all

**Point two:** I would LOVE to take photos, however there is a STRICT no phones policy for all employees, with exceptions for phones being used as medical devices. We have a person with type 1 diabetes whose phone is used to give him updates on his levels. It doesn’t really do anything else so he’s allowed to keep it for his needs. The rest of us are SOL.

Yes, I know this policy is stupid and frustrating, but they bring the hammer down hard on anyone they catch with a phone. However, I have a workaround I may be able to try. It’ll involve more waste, but I could just sneak a few of Jake’s cakes and some of the frosting waste into the smaller blast freezer where we store ice cream and present this as evidence, so I’ll give that a shot. I still haven’t touched the crumb coated rounds and I did save that BS order he took for the prickly regular. I’m also going to start writing down the hours I spend fixing his mistakes and all the tasks included, as well as the prices of the cakes that can’t be used. You’re all right: money talks more than I ever could and I should take advantage of that.

**Point three:** this store is in the middle of a managerial power struggle. Our old manager retired five months ago and the higher ups below him are all scrambling to figure out a new hierarchy and deal with the new young store lead who just took over. He’s…not great at his job and tends to under supervise. So my managers are going to be more of a hindrance than a help. My husband recommended I contact the owner of the small franchise so I may do that. He does live within the area so emailing him might be the best option.

**Point four:** I love the idea of just letting one of his crappy cakes go out to a customer, but I have more respect for my customers than he does and I’ve built a rapport with them. I don’t want to disappoint them. It’s not about protecting Jake, it’s about keeping people who come to me for my skills happy and satisfied with my work. I’ve only gotten where I am thanks to word of mouth from people I’ve impressed, I’ve brought a lot of custom business to the bakery purely through the grapevine. That’s a lot of reputation I have to be careful about. Believe me, I want Jake gone. He’s only getting worse and bossier. And I’ve gotten a lot of ideas of how to start going about this thanks to you guys. And while I could probably let the display case slide, I just can’t bring myself to let him screw up someone’s custom birthday cake like that.

I’m bad at dealing with conflict. It’s always been my worst social skill. That’s why cake decorating is perfect me; I get to be creative and I’m largely left alone to do my thing. I’ve been SUPER lucky to have never had to deal with a “Jake” before now, so I’m kind of in uncharted waters here. That’s why I reached out and why I appreciate all of this advice. I can’t say for sure how long it’ll take to get enough evidence to bring to the owner, but I promise I’ll give you guys an update when I have something. Thanks so much.

Edit: a few people have asked for cake photos. I don’t have any from this store because I don’t want to risk losing my job, and yes, some employees including Jake do risk it and bring their phones. But I have photos from previous places I’ve worked. I’m trying to figure out how to add photos

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Have management actually seen the “decorated” cakes he’s produced? Do they understand how much they’d lose if you sent out Jake’s work? Ultimately they’ll only care about the bottom line, so you’re going to need to demonstrate how much he’s cost over 3 weeks. Document and email everything - dates, costs, what you did in response.
 
> **OOP:** Oh they’ll see them now. I’m gonna start saving the worst cakes in the blast freezer. lol, I’m not AI. I’m just super thorough. Plus, would AI even know this much terminology? I don’t use any of the programs, so I’m legit curious if it would know this stuff

**Commenter 2:** Tell your manager everything. Have other workers corroborate. If they don't support you, go on vacation for 2 weeks and let them find out the hard way.

> **OOP:** Great idea to involve my coworkers in the bakery, they’ve been dealing with him too. Especially the girl who’s been packing bread for them lately. He keeps singling her out and it’s really stressing her out

**Commenter 3:** Take photos of his fucked up cakes and the order for a cake your store doesn't do, take the time to document every line he crosses, then take it to management. If they won't do their job and manage this situation after that start looking around for a position at another bakery before his antics tarnish your reputation. That's about all you can legally do with a know it all dipshit who's trying to tank you.

> **OOP:** That’s the biggest reason I keep fixing his shit; I’ve worked damn hard for this reputation since a lot of decorators can’t/wont freehand and I’ll be damned if I let him screw that up. I just don’t even get where this came from, he wasn’t like this the first week he was here. Why’s a web designer want to decorate cakes so badly?

**Commenter 4:** Document everything. Photograph the botched cakes. Are you his supervisor? If so write up what he has been trained to do and that he isn’t authorized to do tasks he isn’t trained to do. Explain that crumb coating all those cakes might have seemed a logical way to be efficient, but it isn’t efficient if you don’t have blanks for orders that don’t require crumb coating. Explain if more cakes are crumbed than needed that the extra will go stale before they are needed.

As computer geek he probably trying make thing more efficient, without the understanding of things like food becoming stale. Maybe devise with him how many crumbed cakes can be on hand and how many are too much.

If you explain why things are done the way they are done and ask why he he did what he did maybe he will learn something and together you might find ways to put his analytical mind to work the save time.

None of this might work, I’m getting narcissist vibes, but document his training, insubordination, harassment of other staff. You do have to let management know how much frosting he is wasting (photographs).

> **OOP:** You know, that actually makes sense. Like he’s trying to translate his expertise in technology into the bakery. I really want to give him the benefit of the doubt, he’s NOT stupid by any means, but he’s definitely raising tensions back here at a REALLY bad time in store operations when tensions are already high

**Commenter 5:** As long as you keep saving the day instead of letting Jake's failures becomes management's problem, things will get worse. Stop protecting Jake.

> **OOP:** It sure looks that way, doesn’t it? It’s a stupid balance of keeping things looking good and making customers happy that really does start straddling the line of protecting this idiot 

**OOP on why they haven't confronted Jake yet?**

> **OOP:** (Chefs kiss) beautifully said, I just can’t bring myself to let the customers pick that shit up when they’re expecting my usual quality. Some of these people have been ordering specifically from me for a couple of years now and their standards are almost as high a mine. I’m horrible at dealing with conflict so I’m WAY out of my comfort zone. The managers are kind of useless right now since the old store lead retired and the new one is kinda useless. But I plan to start recording what happens and I’ll email it to the owner. It’s a small franchise, so he should definitely show some interest. Thank you so much for this great breakdown.

**Commenter 6:** Why aren't you taking photos of the cakes he's ruining to show your manager?

> **OOP:** Strict no phones policy while on the clock. The only exception is medical device phones

**Is there a general manager who can help OOP with this issue?**

> **OOP:** We’re actively hiring for a bakery manager. The deli manager is pitching in where she can, but she’s overworked as it is so she can’t always be here

**Editor's note: OOP made an update in the same post**

[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/s/CYBaVfppA2): **November 15, 2025 (same post, two days later)**

Edit, 11/15 Okay, it’s the weekend and Jake isn’t working today and tomorrow. We had four cake orders yesterday, two of which are due tomorrow. Jake made those orders even though I asked him not to. And of course they look like hell. I can’t take photos and I won’t risk my job bringing in phones like some others here are willing to do. Trust me, Jake isn’t the only one skirting this rule and honestly it’s the least of my worries.

I took the cakes he made into the blast freezer in dairy and let the department lead know I want them left alone for now. I emailed the owner of the stores and let him know I have a problem here and everything that’s been going on, and that I have proof I can show him if he’s willing to stop by. I also got a few of the other bakery people to agree to put in their two cents when he does. He’s supposed to come by tomorrow to check in on things. I’m more confident talking to him than the new manager, this guy is pretty chill and easy to talk to.

I’m remaking the orders with fresh cakes and scraping nothing. I also took the advice some people gave me and saved a big bowl of scraped icing from previous botched cakes Jake threw together. That’s going into the blast freezer as well so Jake doesn’t see them in case the owner can’t make it.

Thanks for all of the advice, guys. You all gave me a lot of ideas for dealing with this. I truly appreciate it. I’ll give you another update when I have one.

&nbsp;

[Update #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/s/iNXCj6DzRF): **November 20, 2025 (five days later)**

Sorry, I’m not sure how the update system works, I’m still pretty new to Reddit. But I wanted to post an update about my struggles with Jake trying to effectively sabotage my job in the bakery. What happened here happened just a couple of days ago.

I got in contact with the owner who is an extremely chill guy. I’ve known him for around six years since he took over. (Not sure who he took over from or why, the last guy was kind of reclusive) He had me meet him out for a coffee and chat away from the bakery to tell him everything. I told him about the struggles we’ve had with Jake, how he’s been harassing the bakers, how he’s constantly using his phone in spite of the rules, and especially about how he won’t stop trying to do my job.

The owner, whom I’ll call Henry, was very concerned and said he’d stop by this past Tuesday. He did and Jake was there. In the two days since I’d spoken with the owner, Jake had not only continued to do my orders, he had also begun ordering inventory for me. By the time I realized this, it was too late and we were going to be receiving about twenty boxes of white sheet cakes.

Yay.

So suffice to say it was VERY satisfying watching Henry sidle through on Tuesday while Jake was badly decorating one of my orders. I took advice from you all here in my last post and just let him do it. I sliced bread in the meantime and watched. Henry approached Jake and quite irritably asked what he was doing. Jake looked very confused, and I’m guessing he’d never met Henry during the hiring process. He explained incredulously that he was decorating a cake for a customer. Henry nodded and said “I thought you were hired as a bakery assistant. I don’t believe this is your job.”

Jake tried to explain that I was training him, to which I replied that I wasn’t. Henry motioned me over and asked me to take him and Jake to the blast freezer.

Inside the blast freezer, I’d saved everything from after my last post: 11 ruined cake orders, four bowls of wasted frosting, the entire rack of crumb coated rounds, ANOTHER rack of crumb coated rounds in a different flavor, a random four tiered cake Jake had made during one of my days off and a whole stack of twelve packs of childishly decorated, sloppy cupcakes.

I told the owner that all of this was done by Jake and Jake looked furious.

“Why are these here? These were orders! You didn’t give the customers their orders?” He snapped.

I told him calmly that I’d remade the orders. Because again, these looked horrible.

Henry agreed and told Jake that these were far from passable and asked him what on earth he thought he was doing. Jake blurted out that he was working efficiently. Henry asked him why he’d needlessly coated all of the rounds, far more than I could use before they expired. Jake instead said to let him decorate them and he’d finish much faster than I could. I was seeing red by this point, but Henry just sighed, told Jake to come to the manager’s office and instructed me to return to the bakery.

I didn’t know what was happening. It wasn’t until about an hour or so later that Henry came back to the bakery. He apologized for everything and said he’d fired Jake for product waste and insubordination. Apparently Jake had gotten quite mouthy with him during their talk. Henry acknowledged I still needed help and got that newer baker girl, whom I’ll call J to help me until he could hire a replacement.

I don’t think I’ll ever understand what in gods green earth was going on with that little weirdo. I had some people comment that web designers and the like tend to view other jobs as somewhat “lesser” and simple, or something to that effect? My husband suggested he was merely arrogant and believed he could replace me, but why would he want to? It’s not like he was aiming to be a baker or decorator, so why go through the trouble?

I don’t get it, and honestly I’m glad I don’t have to think about it anymore. J is much better at the job than Jake was and honestly much more steady handed anyway. Sorry it’s not more dramatic, just a standard idiot firing, but I’m glad it’s over. Back to my peaceful cakes. Thanks so much for the advice, guys. I seriously appreciated all of it.

**Relevant Comments:**

**Commenter 1:** You were in charge. For Jake, this could not be.

> **OOP:** I’m just glad to be rid of him

**Commenter 2:** How did that little narcissist turd get this far without getting checked already? Must be his first job…
> 
> **Commenter 3:** OP covered for him in this job for too long. I’m guessing this has happened before.
> 
>> **OOP:** Yeah, my own dumb fault. I’d gotten lucky and never had to deal with someone like him before so this was new

**Commenter 4:** Im curious, without a manager weren't you the highest level staff member at the store? Did they give you a bunch of responsibilities but no authority? Seems like at the minimum, even if you couldn't fire him yourself, you should have at least had power to send him home and alert your bosses. Sounds like that guy wasted a whole lot of company money in the meantime while this was sorted out, while offering no benefit back to it, since he actually made your job way harder.

> **OOP:** No, that’d be the bakery manager, which we’re currently hiring for. So the deli manager is technically the one in charge back here. After her it’s the store manager, who kind of sucks at his job
> 
>> **Commenter 4:** Maybe you should get the promotion! So happy you are rid of Jake, here's to happy baking from here on out, and happy customers too!
>> 
>>> **OOP:** J asked if I could show her some decorating so she can make her mom’s birthday cake this year. I’m silently hoping I’ve found my new decorating assistant because she’s doing great so far!

**Commenter 5:** Jake got his just desserts.

> **OOP:** YEEEEEEEEAAAAAHHHHHHH!!

**Commenter 6:** It may not be the most dramatic, but it is satisfying to know that he got fired and you don't have to deal with him anymore. Although, I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall in the office when he got the axe.

> **OOP:** One of the ladies working orders upstairs told me she heard Jake getting seriously rude with Henry. Henry is really quiet so she couldn’t hear what he was saying, but apparently Jake had some um, “choice insults” about me and how he’d get a lawyer for this. lol, I wish him luck

The MyCiti is amazing for the city and Atlantic seaboard. It stops at most beaches and comes pretty frequently. You can also use Google maps to see bus routes. 
Alternatively, Uber rides work out cheaper than renting a car and save you a lot of stress, effort and wasted time. 

For that one day trip to the Winelands (and they love setting up roadblocks during the holiday) get a driver for the day. 
For Chapman’s Peak drive, treat yourself to a cool car for the one day.

# Current Trends in On-Demand Services

The on-demand service app market is hotter than a summer sidewalk—people love convenience! Trends show a surge in services like home cleaning, food delivery, and even dog walking apps. Customers crave quick, efficient solutions at their fingertips. Think about how you can hop on these trends: consider seasonal offers or partnerships with local businesses to keep your service fresh and relevant.

# Competitor Analysis

Before diving headfirst into the competitive waters, take a moment to scope out the competition. Analyze what they do well and where they stumble. Focus on their app features, customer service, pricing, and marketing strategies. Remember, knowledge is power! Use this intel to differentiate your app and identify gaps in the market.

# Market Opportunities and Challenges

The on-demand market is like a wild jungle: filled with opportunities like partnerships, new tech, and expanding demographics, but also lurking with challenges like fierce competition and changing regulations. Stay nimble—identify your unique opportunity and prepare for curveballs like price wars or tech disruptions. Embrace the chaos!

# Identifying Your Target Audience

# Creating User Personas

Craft user personas like a sculptor chisels marble—carefully and with intention. Identify key demographics: age, location, preferences, and pain points. Think about their lifestyle and why they would choose your app over the competition. The more detailed your personas, the better you can tailor your marketing efforts to meet their needs.

# Analyzing User Behavior and Preferences

Dive into analytics to uncover user behavior—what do they click on? What makes them abandon their cart? Track user journeys, and gather feedback, because knowing what makes your audience tick is crucial. Use this intel to optimize your app and enhance their overall experience.

# Segmentation Strategies

Not all users are created equal, so segment them based on behaviors and preferences. You can target new users with introductory offers and loyal users with rewards and exclusives. By tailoring your marketing messages to each segment, you can ensure your message resonates instead of falling flat like yesterday’s bread.

# Crafting a Unique Value Proposition

# Defining Your App's Core Features

What makes your app the apple of a customer’s eye? Define your core features that solve key problems for users—whether it's faster service, better user experience, or lower costs. Ensure these features are front and center, showcasing what sets you apart from the competition.

# Highlighting Benefits Over Competitors

Features are great, but benefits sell! Instead of listing technical specs, focus on how your app improves the user’s life. Is it faster? Cheaper? More reliable? Use persuasive language to communicate how these benefits make your app the irresistible choice in a sea of options.

# Communicating Your Value Effectively

Once you’ve defined your unique value, it’s time to shout it from the rooftops—well, metaphorically! Use catchy taglines, engaging visuals, and relatable messaging across your marketing channels. Test different approaches to find what resonates most with your audience and are they ready to hit that download button?

# Developing a Multi-Channel Marketing Strategy

# Choosing the Right Marketing Channels

Select your marketing channels as you would a dessert at a buffet: wisely and based on what appeals to your taste. Social media, email campaigns, influencer partnerships, and paid ads all have unique benefits. Choose channels that align with your target audience’s habits and preferences, ensuring a mix that maximizes your reach.

# Integrating Online and Offline Efforts

Don't leave offline marketing out of the mix—think local events, business partnerships, and community initiatives. Integrate these with your online campaigns for a cohesive strategy that taps into both digital convenience and that warm, fuzzy feeling of local support.

# Creating a Consistent Brand Message

Consistency is key, like your morning coffee! Ensure your brand message is clear across all channels. Whether it’s a cheeky social media post or a sophisticated email blast, your voice should remain unified. This builds trust and makes your app recognizable in a crowded market.

# Leveraging Social Media for Promotion

# Selecting the Best Platforms for Your Audience

Choosing the right social media platforms is like picking the perfect outfit for a first date—it's crucial! Are your potential users scrolling through TikTok or rehashing old tweets on Twitter? Conduct a little detective work to uncover where your target audience hangs out. Once you target the right platforms, you'll save time and resources, like finding the right size on the first try.

# Creating Engaging Content

Now that you're in the right place, it's time to shine! Create content that’s as engaging as a puppy video—snappy, shareable, and guaranteed to make people smile (or at least nod in agreement). Mix it up with eye-catching visuals, quick tips, or user-generated content that makes your audience feel included. Don’t forget to sprinkle in a little humor; who doesn’t love a good meme?

# Building a Community Around Your Brand

It’s not just about broadcasting; it’s about building a tribe! Encourage your users to interact with your posts, respond to comments, and create a space for genuine conversation. Consider hosting Q&A sessions or themed challenges that invite participation. A community that feels connected to your brand will advocate for you like a proud parent at a school play.

# Utilizing Influencer Partnerships

# Identifying Relevant Influencers

When it comes to influencers, think of them as modern-day cheerleaders—except, instead of pom-poms, they wield followers. Find influencers whose audience matches your target market. Look for those who genuinely resonate with your app’s vibe, and you’ll avoid the awkwardness of mismatched interests (like trying to convince Grandma to do the floss dance).

# Establishing Mutually Beneficial Relationships

Building partnerships should feel like a friendly collaboration, not a bad blind date. Reach out to influencers with a proposed win-win scenario: what can they gain, and what can you offer? Free trials, exclusive previews, or some social media shout-outs can go a long way. Remember, a happy influencer is a great ally in promoting your app!

# Measuring Influencer Impact

After rolling out your influencer campaigns, it’s time to play detective again—only this time, with analytics. Track engagement rates, referral traffic, and any uptick in downloads to determine if your investment in influencer magic is paying off. If their impact is like a gust of wind in your sails, it’s time to keep sailing in that direction!

# Implementing SEO and Content Marketing

# Keyword Research and Optimization

Welcome to the world of keywords, where your app can become the belle of the search engine ball! Use keyword research tools to figure out what your potential users are typing into search bars. Work these keywords into your website and app descriptions, like icing on a cake. Just don’t overdo it; nobody likes a cake that’s all frosting and no substance!

# Creating Valuable Content for Users

Creating content that offers real value is key—think how-to guides, informative blog posts, or video tutorials. This type of content shows you care about your audience’s needs, making them more likely to return for seconds! Remember, a well-informed user is a happy user, and happy users are excellent for word-of-mouth marketing.

# Building Backlinks and Authority

Establishing authority online is like collecting badges in a video game; the more you have, the tougher you look. Focus on building backlinks by collaborating with reputable blogs and websites. Guest posts, interviews, or even a round-up list can help you earn those coveted links. Before you know it, your app will be wearing a crown of credibility.

# Measuring Success and Optimizing Campaigns

# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to Track

KPIs are your trusty compass in the wilderness of marketing. Keep an eye on metrics such as user downloads, app engagement, and customer acquisition costs. These numbers will tell you if you’re headed in the right direction or if it’s time to recalibrate your plans—like realizing your GPS has been leading you to the wrong coffee shop!

# Using Analytics Tools for Insights

Let’s embrace technology, shall we? Utilize tools like Google Analytics, social media insights, and app store analytics to gather all the data you need. These insights are your new best friends, revealing user behavior, preferences, and even areas where you might need to improve. Don’t shy away from the data; it’s your personal marketing fortune teller!

# Iterating Based on Data-Driven Decisions

Once you’ve gathered your data, it’s time for some good ol’ trial and error. Use the insights from your KPIs to tweak your strategies—whether that means adjusting your content, re-targeting ads, or even reshuffling social media schedules. Embrace the iterative process; it’s not about perfection. It’s all about progress and finding what resonates with your audience.

I never imagined my devoted husband Samuel would cheat with his hatest woman Lyanna.
When I saw Samuel grinding relentlessly on top of Leanna, I couldn’t hold back and vomited.


Chapter 1

In the tenth year of Emilia Hutchinson's marriage to Samuel Elsham, she received a hotel check-in notification text.
The hotel was right across from Samuel's office, and the message clearly read ""Couple's King Room 520.""
Emilia's best friend, Paisley Ralfe, snatched the phone from her hand, her voice strained with urgency.
""Emmie! Who books a couple's suite for business these days? Samuel must be cheating!""
Emilia took a slow sip of coffee, then chuckled softly.
""That's impossible. If Samuel could cheat on me, I could grow wings and fly, and I'd probably win the lottery too.""
She knew better than anyone just how much Samuel loved her.
Back then, she'd been severely burned in a fire with second-degree injuries, and her lower body was soaked in blood.
She was issued six critical condition notices in one night—even her parents thought she was at death's door.
But Samuel stood outside the operating room with a pale face, insisting she would pull through.
That night felt like a miracle.
It wasn't until later that Emilia learned Samuel had signed a consent form for voluntary living organ donation.
He'd been prepared to trade his own life for hers, just to keep her safe.
So how could a man who was willing to die for her ever cheat?
Thinking this, Emilia casually moved the text to the trash and went back to her dessert. Soon enough, she forgot all about it.
The moment came on Samuel's birthday. He had just closed his eyes to make a wish when a text message appeared on his phone.
It was from a local number.
""The room is ready, same place as usual.
""Darling, aren't you coming to get your birthday present?""

***

Emilia froze, and her eyes widened.
Her face paled as she stared at the words, repeating them to herself. ""Darling? Birthday present?""
She stumbled backward, her lower back hitting the edge of the table, creating a loud thud. A sharp, stabbing pain shot through her, and she gasped.
Samuel cut his wish short and rushed over in a single step.
He dropped to one knee. His voice was laced with anxiety. ""Where does it hurt? Show me.""
Emilia looked at him, stunned.
His eyes were filled with worry, his breathing uneven with anxiety.
That instinctive, immediate reaction told her everything—he loved her. Deeply, genuinely. A love that was all-consuming and unreserved.
But then why was he the one getting that suggestive text?
She could hardly believe the man who was so gentle and attentive could be the same person who booked a hotel room to cheat on her.
Samuel was known for his easygoing nature — except when it came to his wife. That was the one line no one could cross.
He might ride a shared bike to work, but Emilia always rode in the most comfortable luxury car.
He might humble himself and bow during business negotiations, but Emilia always held her head high.
He might fix light bulbs and lift heavy things with his own hands, but Emilia's hands were only for playing the piano.
Emilia had always believed she was the happiest woman in the world, blessed with the purest love imaginable.
But now, that glaring text message shattered her illusion completely.
And the one who had shattered it with his own hands was actually the person closest to her—the one she trusted most.
""Emmie, there's an issue with the company documents. I need to head back to the office.""
By the time Samuel said this, he was already at the door.
Emilia's heart sank. For the first time, she spoke up to stop him.
""But you haven't even eaten your cake yet. What kind of document is so urgent that you have to leave right now?""
After ten years of marriage, Samuel had never refused any of Emilia's requests.
But this time, he gestured helplessly at his phone.
""Look, this mistake is really serious. I have to handle it myself.""
He ruffled her hair. ""Be good and wait for me at home.""
The moment the door closed, Emilia's hand trembled so violently she could barely hold her phone.
Was Samuel in such a hurry to meet that woman? Hurrying so much he'd leave her alone at home without a second thought?
A sharp, cramping pain shot through her chest.
She snatched the car keys from the coffee table and hurried after him.
The early autumn night air seeped through the car window cracks, carrying a sharp chill.
She gripped the steering wheel tightly, her eyes locked on the familiar Maybach ahead.
When she saw the car pull over slowly at the company entrance, her tense nerves eased slightly—maybe she'd been overthinking things after all.
Samuel loved her more than life itself; how could he possibly cheat?
Just as guilt began to creep in for doubting him, Emilia's eyes widened in shock.
The familiar figure she knew so well was striding briskly toward the hotel across the street.
Her phone buzzed suddenly.
""Emmie, I'm here."" Alongside the text was a photo of the company entrance.
""I might have to pull an all-nighter today. Go to bed early.""
She stared at the screen, her knuckles turning white as a buzzing filled her ears.
So that was why he'd parked at the company—just to cover his tracks.
So the hotel check-in text from five days ago wasn't a prank after all. He really had been cheating.
Her chest felt so heavy it hurt to breathe, every inhale dragging against a sharp, stabbing pain.
Even though she'd braced herself for the worst, seeing the truth confirmed still made her world collapse.
A decade of marriage, the love she'd been most proud of. It had all become one big joke.
Tears blurred her vision, and suddenly she remembered the vow Samuel had made at their wedding.
""If I ever betray Emilia in this lifetime, may I be condemned to hell forever, never to be reborn.""
Emilia mumbled, ""Samuel, would you dare repeat that vow now?""

***

It was 6:00 am, and the sky was still dark.
Emilia finally spotted that figure—Samuel had his arm around a woman as they walked out of the hotel, his fingertips lingering on her waist in an intimate gesture.
When she got a clear look at the woman's face, her eyes widened in shock.
It was Lyanna Kirchman.
The same crazy woman who'd stripped off her clothes chasing Samuel in high school, only to be dragged away by security.
The same obsessive person Samuel had publicly mocked, saying, ""Just the sight of you makes me sick.""
And now she was the one Samuel was cheating with.
Before Emilia could process it all, Lyanna suddenly started walking toward her.
Ignoring her stunned expression, Lyanna played a video right in front of her.
""You must be wondering why it's me, right?""
She gave a cold laugh. ""After watching this, you'll understand.""
Emilia took the phone with trembling hands.
She'd braced herself for what she might see, but when the images appeared, a wave of nausea still surged from her stomach, forcing her to roll down the car window and retch violently.
In the video, Samuel had Lyanna pinned beneath him, his movements rough and unrestrained.
Afterward, he stood shirtless at the window, lighting a cigarette. His voice was a low rasp as he flicked the ash.
""I told you not to be so demanding. Pick times when Emmie isn't home.""
His tone was so gentle it almost sounded affectionate, but Lyanna scoffed. ""If you love her that much, why haven't you touched her in ten years?""
Samuel's expression froze, his eyes dark and unreadable.
He took a deep drag from the cigarette, the smoke obscuring his face.
""Not touching her doesn't mean I don't love her.
""It's just..."" His voice suddenly grew strained.
""After that fire ten years ago, Emmie was left with large burn scars on her thighs. Every time we tried to be intimate, the moment I saw those scars, I just...""
""Just what?"" Lyanna pushed on.
Samuel stubbed out the cigarette, his voice dropping to nearly a whisper. ""I just feel sick to my stomach.""
Emilia clutched the phone, her knuckles white as a roaring buzz filled her ears.
She was the one who'd rushed into the fire ten years ago and dragged him out with all her strength.
Back then, he'd cried and promised to treat her well for the rest of his life.
But now, the scars she'd risked her life for had become a flaw in his eyes.
When he felt disgusted by her scars, he forgot that without her, he would have died in that fire long ago.


Chapter 2

A sudden fire erupted at the Elsham's residence ten years ago, the home where Samuel lived.
As the flames spread, everyone scrambled to save themselves—including Samuel's own parents.
But Emilia went against the tide, rushing into the blazing inferno without hesitation.
When she carried the unconscious Samuel out on her back, she got trapped as the roof beams collapsed.
By the time firefighters rescued her, 40% of her body was burned, and she was covered in blood.
The day she woke up in the ICU, she weakly said she wanted to break up.
Samuel cried until he could barely breathe, repeating ""I don't care"" over and over.
Back then, she'd foolishly believed she'd finally found someone who could see past her appearance and love her for who she was inside.
It wasn't until today that she realized all those vows were lies, and every ""I don't care"" was just a carefully rehearsed line.
Samuel not only cared, he cared to an almost pathological degree.
He cared so much that he hadn't touched her once in ten years of marriage.
He cared so much that he gave her his ""love"" but reserved his intimacy for another woman.
He cared so much that he found her scars downright repulsive.
""Emilia, you saw the video too. Every time Samuel looks at your scars, he's disgusted. The only reason he's staying in this marriage is to repay the debt from you saving his life.
""If you really love him, you should let him go. Stop using that fire as leverage and turning yourself into some pathetic charity case. That just makes me lose even more respect for you.""
Lyanna's sarcastic words cut deep, finally snapping Emilia out of her trance.
""Ms. Kirchman,"" her voice was soft but carried a razor-sharp edge that demanded attention.
""A homewrecker who inserts herself into other people's marriages seems far more deserving of being belittled.""
Without another glance at the furious Lyanna, Emilia turned the car around and sped away.
Emilia's knuckles turned white as she gripped the steering wheel, the scenery outside blurring into an indistinguishable mess.
Emilia pulled her car over to the side of the road.
Tears finally broke through and streamed down her cheeks.
Once the crying subsided, she pulled out her phone and dialed the familiar number.
""Dad, I'll go abroad and live with you.
""As for the arranged marriage... it can be anyone. I don't care anymore.""
Her father's surprised questions came through the other end, but she just hung up in silence.
When the phone screen went dark, she remembered the girl she was ten years ago.
How determined she'd been to refuse the arranged marriage back then, and how confidently she'd run toward what she believed was true love.
Yet in the end, all she got in return was a remark about how it made him sick to his stomach.
Since sincere devotion only led to betrayal, she might as well agree to the family's arranged marriage.
At least it would be more dignified than this decade of so-called ""love.""

***

Early the next morning, Emilia placed the pre-prepared divorce agreement among the documents waiting for Samuel's signature.
She stood by the door and watched as he picked up a fountain pen, ready to sign. But the tip paused just above the paper.
Samuel frowned slightly and was about to flip through the document when his phone vibrated.
The caller ID showed a local number.
He answered with an unchanged expression.
""Out of credit again? Fine, I'll handle it at the office.""
After hanging up, he casually signed the divorce agreement. As he stood, he suddenly pressed a warm kiss to her forehead.
""I've been too busy to spend time with you lately. Come to the dinner party with me tonight.""
His suit brushed past her shoulder, carrying that familiar musky scent—the exact same one she'd smelled on Lyanna.
She clutched the signed divorce agreement tightly, watching Samuel walk away. Her heart felt like it had plunged into an ice cellar.
Half an hour later, Emilia received a message from Lyanna on her phone.
It was a video.
In it, Samuel had Lyanna pressed against the floor-to-ceiling window of his office.
A woman's breathy moans could be heard. ""Mr. Elsham, are you satisfied with my service?""
""Five-star review,"" he replied in a husky voice, thick with passion.
The video finally froze on their wedding photo—in the picture, he was sliding a ring onto her finger.
Yet the groom, who looked so tender and loving in that photo, was now tangled up with another woman right beneath their wedding photo.
Emilia suddenly tasted the metallic tang of blood in her mouth and realized her palm had been pierced by her own fingernails.
Memories flashed through her mind like a reel of film—Samuel's retreating figure, always rushing out the door whenever he got a call from that local number.
Those ""urgent company matters"" she'd never questioned, those nights he always came home smelling of the same perfume.
It turned out every ""bill reminder call"" from that number was actually a signal for his secret meetings with Lyanna.
Yet to Samuel, she'd been nothing but a fool — toyed with for ten long years!


Chapter 3

Emilia's face went pale as she collapsed weakly onto the floor, all her strength gone.
She had thought there was at least some genuine feeling in this marriage but never expected it to be built on betrayal from the very beginning.
Shakily pushing herself up, she grabbed a decorative piece from the coffee table and smashed it hard against the wedding photo on the wall.
With a loud crash, the flying shards hit and shattered the antique vase on the display shelf—a piece worth 25 million dollars.
It was Samuel's most prized possession. Normally, he wouldn't even let the housekeepers near it.
""What do you think you're doing?""
Samuel's furious shout came from the doorway. Emilia watched him stride quickly toward her.
Emilia instinctively apologized, ""I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...""
Before she could finish, he grabbed her wrist.
""Who cares about the vase? Are you hurt anywhere? Let me check!""
Glancing at the shards scattered across the floor, she hesitated. ""But you spent 25 million dollars on it...""
""Don't be silly,"" he chuckled softly. ""Even if all the antiques in the world were smashed, they wouldn't be worth a single strand of your hair.""
There was a time when Emilia would have been moved to tears by this.
But now, looking at the man who seemed so affectionate.
All Emilia felt was hypocrisy and disgust.
She couldn't help but wonder how many times Samuel had said those same words to another woman.
""Emmie, hurry up and change. We'll be late for the banquet.""
Samuel's urgent voice snapped Emilia back to reality.
Only then did she remember he'd mentioned taking her to a banquet tonight.
As she met his gaze and took the formal dress, her fingertips made contact with the fabric, prompting an instinctive frown.
It was another long dress.
Since the fire ten years ago, none of the formal dresses Samuel had picked out for her were short.
In the past, she hadn't dared to wear short skirts because of her insecurity, but now...
""Is there a short skirt?"" She looked Samuel directly in the eyes. ""I want to wear a short skirt.""
A flicker of surprise crossed the man's face, but he quickly composed himself.
""Be reasonable. Long skirts are for your protection.""
""I don't need that kind of protection,"" Emilia insisted stubbornly. ""There's nothing shameful about my scars.""
After several failed attempts to persuade her, Samuel's frown deepened.
""Everyone coming tonight is a prominent figure in Boston. What would people think if you wore a short skirt?"" His voice suddenly rose.
""There will be children at the event too. Who's going to take responsibility if you scare them?""
Emilia's eyes widened. This was the first time he had spoken to her like this in their ten years of marriage.
It felt more like the true thoughts he'd been hiding all along.
""So... you think I'm terrifying?"" Her voice shook. ""That I don't even have the right to wear a short skirt?""
Only then did Samuel realize he'd lost his temper. He quickly softened his tone. ""That's not what I meant...
""The banquet requires all female guests to wear long skirts,"" he said, lowering his voice. ""I specifically asked them to make that rule.""
After that, Emilia changed into the long skirt under Samuel's persistent coaxing and pressure.
Arriving at the venue in elegant attire, Emilia linked arms with Samuel as they made their entrance.
Envious murmurs reached her ears.
""Wow, Mr. Elsham really dotes on Mrs. Elsham! Just because she has scars on her legs, he specifically requested all female guests to wear long dresses. What kind of fairy-tale love is this?""
""Absolutely! I heard the scars Mrs. Elsham got from that fire were really severe, but Mr. Elsham has stayed by her side for ten years. This is what true devotion means!""
Hearing this, Emilia dug her fingertips deep into her palm. These seemingly envious praises cut at her heart like a blunt knife with every word.
In others' eyes, she would always be the one receiving charity—a flawed person who needed her husband's pity.
On the other hand, Samuel would always be that lofty savior on a pedestal.
Emilia had just sat down when a shrill gasp cut through the banquet hall chatter.
""My goodness! Who is that? Didn't Mr. Elsham explicitly require everyone to wear long dresses?""
All eyes turned sharply toward the entrance.
Emilia looked up, and her breath got caught in her throat.
Lyanna was stepping in on stiletto heels, wearing a miniskirt. Her long fair legs glinted under the lights, dazzling to the point of harshness.
""She's doing this on purpose, right? Knowing full well that Mrs. Elsham..."" The voice trailed off abruptly.
Lyanna acted as if she hadn't heard the remarks and walked straight to the head table.
She extended her hand to Samuel and said, ""Mr. Elsham, I'm truly sorry. But I couldn't find a single long dress in my wardrobe.
""Both you and your wife wouldn't mind, right?""


Chapter 4

The banquet hall fell deathly silent instantly, with all eyes fixed on the dramatic scene.
Everyone knew Samuel hated it when someone mentioned his wife's scars. Lyanna was practically dancing on thin ice.
They all held their breath, waiting for Samuel to fly into a rage. Normally, bodyguards would have already dragged this reckless woman out by now.
Yet Samuel only swallowed hard and snapped out a few cold words. ""Don't let it happen again.""
The entire table erupted in an uproar, with murmurs spreading everywhere.
""What on earth is the relationship between Lyanna and Mr. Elsham? He's being far too lenient with her.""
""By doing this in front of everyone, isn't Mr. Elsham just embarrassing Mrs. Elsham?""
At these words, a victorious smile curved Lyanna's red lips as she immediately took a seat beside Samuel.
It wasn't until he saw Emilia's face drain completely of color that Samuel spoke up to explain.
""There are three reasons I'm not losing my temper. Firstly, it was out of consideration for our old classmate friendship; secondly, to account for the cooperation between the Elsham Group and the Kirchman family; and most importantly...""
Samuel lowered his voice. ""If I lose my temper in public, it will only confirm that you're narrow-minded.""
Emilia gripped the napkin tightly, her knuckles turning pale.
Looking at Lyanna's smooth legs beneath the short skirt, she suddenly let out a self-deprecating laugh.
It turned out short skirts weren't forbidden at the banquet at all—only she, Emilia, this woman with ""horrific scars,"" wasn't worthy of wearing one.
Instead of arguing with Samuel, Emilia kept downing cocktails one after another.
The burning liquor sliding down her throat couldn't suppress the coldness rising in her chest.
When she inadvertently lowered her head, the sight before her made her blood run cold. Lyanna's toes were ambiguously tangling around the hem of Samuel's pants.
Samuel's long fingers were repeatedly caressing Lyanna's smooth thigh beneath the tablecloth.
She tightened her grip on the wine glass.
How dare they put on such a filthy display right in front of her, under everyone's gaze?
If there had been a bed in the banquet hall, they probably couldn't wait to...
A wave of nausea rose in her throat. This man she'd loved for ten years now made her so disgusted that her whole body trembled.
Just as Emilia was about to flee through the door, a scream cut through the banquet hall commotion.
""Fire! Run!""
In an instant, thick smoke flooded her lungs.
She trembled as she fumbled through the thick smoke, her throat scorched by the heat, forcing out broken cries.
""Samuel... kaff... kaff... where are you?""
The only response came from Samuel's familiar voice drifting from the emergency exit. ""Lyanna! Watch where you're going!""
""Why are you snapping at me?""
""Hold onto me tight! Do you want second-degree burns too?""
Amid the rolling heat, Emilia felt as if she'd plummeted into an ice cellar.
The man she'd risked her life to drag from the fire ten years ago was now holding another woman, stepping into the light without looking back.
What was even more absurd was that he clearly remembered how badly she'd been hurt and how terrified she would be.
Yet from start to finish, he never once looked back at her—not even once.
All he left her with was the memory of that beam that had scarred her legs ten years ago and the echoing crash of it plummeting in her mind.
Emilia's heart felt as if it had been torn open; every breath carried a stabbing pain laced with the metallic tang of blood.
At that moment, she desperately wanted to grab that resolute, departing figure and scream at him.
""Samuel, when you were clutching Lyanna and fleeing for your life—did you ever remember that ten years ago, there was also a girl who rushed into the fire, trading her body covered in burns for a glimmer of hope to save yours?""
But before she could even open her mouth, the thick smoke stole her consciousness completely.
She didn't know how long she'd been unconscious. In a daze, she heard shocked cries. ""Mr. Elsham! Don't go in!""
Several senior executives clung to his suit. ""The fire department will be here in three minutes! You'll die if you go in now! Thousands of the Elsham Group employees depend on you!""
Samuel tore off his tie. The back of his hand, scorched by flying embers, bulged with veins. ""If the Elsham Group loses me, they can just hire a new CEO...""
He kicked open the crumbling doorframe, his roar drowned by explosions.
""But I'm the only one my wife has!""
With that, Samuel rushed toward her without hesitation.
He took her hand, his voice broken and unsteady. ""Emmie, look at me! Please... don't fall asleep...""
Emilia heard his words, but not a single ripple stirred in her heart anymore.
The last bit of love she had for Samuel had died in the fire where he turned and left her.
As for watching his anxious expression when he finally came back to save her, all she wanted to say was. That kind of belated devotion didn't count for anything at all.
Her heart grew colder while her body temperature rose higher.
In the final moment before her consciousness faded, Emilia had only one thought—regret. She regretted saving him.
And she regretted even more believing in his so-called sincerity and marrying him.

***

When she woke up again, Samuel's anxious voice was by her ear.
""Emmie, how do you feel? Is there any discomfort?""


Chapter 5

Emilia didn't answer; she just pressed her lips tightly together and remained silent.
Watching Emilia's reaction, Samuel felt panic surge in his chest.
He took Emilia's hand, his voice trembling with guilt.
""Emmie, I'm sorry. I came too late.
""The scene was such a mess back then. I thought you'd already escaped on your own. I never expected...""
If she hadn't seen it with her own eyes, she might have believed him.
But now, all she could think was how good Samuel was at acting. It was so good that he almost fooled himself.
Her lips turned pale, her voice weak and hoarse.
""I see. Please go out for now. I want to be alone for a while.""
After speaking, Emilia turned her head away before Samuel could say anything.
Seeing this, Samuel simply assumed Emilia was still in poor condition after waking up, so he turned and left the ward.
After Samuel left, Emilia stared blankly out the window.
The sun was bright—blindingly so—but it couldn't reach the emptiness that had long settled in her heart.
So this was what it felt like to be utterly disappointed.
Just then, her phone vibrated; it was a call from her father, Howard Hutchinson.
He asked when she would go abroad and what date her flight was.
She reached out as if touching the sunlight, her voice light as a feather.
""In a week. I'll leave once the paperwork is done.""
The call had just ended when Samuel's flustered voice came from the doorway.
""What paperwork? What leaving?""
Emilia's expression remained calm. ""A friend asked when I'd be discharged from the hospital. I said I'd handle the paperwork and leave once I'm better.""
The tension in Samuel's chest finally eased.
He held her hand tightly, his voice gentle and pleading.
""Emmie, haven't you always wanted to go to Hokkaido to see the snow? We'll go together this winter, okay?""
Emilia looked at the hope in his eyes, her throat tight and dry.
She longed to tell him that they wouldn't make it to this winter.
But in the end, she just forced a smile and said, ""Okay.""
As soon as the words left her mouth, tears streamed down her face. Samuel hurried to wipe them away, but the more he wiped, the more they fell.
He thought those were tears of emotion, never knowing that those tears from that day were her way of saying goodbye to him.
Three days later, Emilia was discharged from the hospital.
When she told Samuel the news, he said he was working overtime and couldn't leave.
But the next second, she saw Lyanna walking out of the obstetrics and gynecology department, holding her stomach.
And the person carefully supporting her was none other than that ""man who was working overtime.""
At the sight of this scene, Emilia's blood seemed to freeze in her veins.
The stabbing pain in her chest reminded her that Samuel had not only lied to her again but was also about to become a father.
And this child—along with the child's mother—had nothing to do with her at all.

***

After a long moment, she watched Samuel head for the payment window while Lyanna appeared beside her.
This time, there was no triumphant sneer in Lyanna's voice, only the plea of a mother.
""I'm pregnant.
""This child can't grow up without a father. Please... please let me have Samuel.""
When blood oozed from her bitten lip, Emilia tasted absurdity.
She had never imagined that the clichéd drama plot—""the other woman begs for the man's love with a pregnant belly""—would actually happen to her.
""Okay.""
Though the answer had long been decided, her heart still ached with tearing pain the moment the word left her mouth.
After speaking, just as she turned to leave, Lyanna suddenly grabbed her wrist and gave it a fierce yank.
""Ah!""
Amid the scream, Lyanna stumbled and fell to the ground.
Emilia remained frozen in place, still caught off guard, when Samuel came rushing over.
""Emilia Hutchinson!""
It was the first time he had shouted her full name. The rage in his eyes burned all ten years of their tender moments to ashes.
Lyanna clung to Samuel's pants and sobbed. ""Don't blame Ms. Hutchinson... It was me who made her unhappy.""
Emilia stared at Lyanna in disbelief, her lips trembling as she tried to explain.
""It wasn't me. It was her, she herself...""
A crisp slap landed sharply on her face before she could finish speaking.
What came into her sight was Samuel's cold, terrifying gaze.
""How could you even lay a hand on a pregnant woman, Emilia? When did you become so vicious?""


Chapter 6

After saying this, Samuel carefully helped Lyanna up from the ground.
He lifted Lyanna into his arms and turned to leave right in front of her.
From start to finish, he didn't spare her a single glance, as if he truly loathed her to the core.
Emilia held her burning cheek, the unfamiliar swelling under her fingertips feeling terrifying.
He had hit her.
For another woman, he had raised his hand against her for the first time.
He didn't even give her a chance to explain, and just like that, he assumed she did it.
In a daze, she thought of the man who would fret for ages if she nicked her finger while chopping vegetables.
The moment memories overlapped with reality, she finally had to admit that the Samuel who used to have eyes only for her was long gone, vanished in that fire ten years ago.
After that day, Samuel gave her the silent treatment.
He still came home on time like before, but he never brought her the fresh flowers from the shop downstairs anymore.
He still sat across from her at the dinner table, but he never said a single word to her again.
And Emilia just let this cold war fester, doing nothing to stop it.
She would be leaving soon anyway. For these last few days, it was fine to end things like this without any more entanglement.
Just when Emilia thought Samuel would keep acting like this forever, he suddenly came to her.
He told her that Lyanna was just a business associate, and accompanying her to the prenatal checkup was purely for work.
He said he'd lost control because he was so disappointed.
""The Emilia I remember couldn't even bear to step on an ant. But you...""
He didn't stop there; instead, he continued with the real reason he'd come to see her.
""The other thing I came to ask you for today is a favor.
""After Lyanna fell, the baby's heartbeat has been unstable.""
He avoided her gaze, his fingertips unconsciously brushing over his wedding ring.
""The psychic said... we need a lock of hair from the person who pushed her to make a protective charm for warding off bad energy.""
The air stilled for a moment.
Emilia looked at him quietly, suddenly feeling the absurdity of it all.
He could say something like that without even blinking.
""So what?"" she asked softly, her eyes cold as ice.
""So... could you cut your hair short...?""
After he said that, the excitement in his voice was impossible to hide.
""Lyanna is my business associate, and the baby in her belly is a living, breathing life. I can't just stand by and do nothing.
""But you, Emmie... no matter what you look like, I'll still love you.""
The man in front of her had the same features as always, yet he felt so unfamiliar that it made her heart ache.
She still remembered that Samuel had once said that her long hair was his favorite thing about her.
Because of his words, she had taken meticulous care of her hair all these years, never cutting it short again.
But now, he was actually asking her to cut her long hair for the child he had with another woman.
A single request turned all her years of careful hair care into a ridiculous farce of self-delusion.
She looked into the man's hopeful eyes and slowly took the scissors.
As the blades opened and closed, a lock of long hair fell silently to the ground.
The hair that was once praised by him as silk was now neatly severed, just like their ten-year marriage.
""Is this enough?
""If not, there's more.""
Her voice was as cold as permanently frozen polar ice, and the disappointment in her eyes was like a blade, making Samuel's heart twitch sharply.
He had never seen Emilia like this.
The eyes that had always been filled with tenderness were now so cold they made him panic.
The panic only lasted a moment before he forced it down.
After all, she didn't know anything about him and Lyanna.
She was just throwing a tantrum for a few days. She'd come around once he coaxed her.
Just like every other time in the past.
He bent down to pick up the cut hair from the floor, his tone as soft as when soothing a hissing cat.
""Emmie, no matter if your hair's long or short...
""You'll always be my Mrs. Elsham.""
He thought saying this would reassure her, but he had no idea that Emilia was already counting down the days until she left.
Only two days left.
In two days, this marriage that was on the edge of falling apart would come to a complete end.


Chapter 7

Over the remaining two days, Samuel told her he had to go on a work assignment out of town and wouldn't be back for a week.
Emilia knew he was going to be with Lyanna, but she said nothing—she just nodded faintly.
It was actually perfect. The divorce papers would be ready in these two days, and his absence would only make it easier for her to leave.
Sure enough, not long after Samuel left, messages from Lyanna started pouring in one after another.
Every single one was a brag.
She talked about how he stayed with her through the all-night prenatal checkup, how he personally made soup and brought it to her bedside, and how he'd stared at the ultrasound photo and smiled like an idiot all night.
Beneath the ultrasound photo attached at the end, there was also a line of words that stung like a needle.
""Didn't see that coming, Ms. Hutchinson? You couldn't give him a child all these years, but I'm carrying twins on my first try.""
Right after that, another message came.
""Sam said, if it's a boy, we'll name him Oliver Kirchman; if it's a girl, Sophie Kirchman.""
Emilia had been mindlessly swiping through the screen, but the second she saw those two names, her breath caught.
Memories came flooding back.
On their wedding night, Samuel had held her hand and talked about their future under the moonlight.
""If it's a boy, we'll name him Oliver—he'll protect you just like I do.
""If it's a girl... we'll call her Soph. She will be as innocent and bright as you are.""
His fingertips were warm, his eyes burning with passion, as if the vow he made in that moment would last a lifetime.
Yet now, those very same names were to be used for the child he had with another woman.
It turned out what he'd cherished was never a child with her, but anyone who could carry on his bloodline.
As for who the child's mother was...
It had never mattered.

***

The following morning, a call came in when she was packing her luggage.
It was from her high school classmates. Someone must have found out she was moving abroad.
They all said they wanted to throw a farewell party for her.
Emilia wanted to decline at first, but her classmates were so enthusiastic she had no choice but to agree.
After hanging up, she received a message from the Courthouse saying her divorce certificate was ready for collection.
As soon as she got the news, Emilia immediately took a taxi and went to the Courthouse.
An hour later, she successfully obtained two divorce certificates.
The moment she saw them, a huge sense of relief washed over her.
Finally—this marriage built on self-deception, filled with lies and betrayal, had come to a complete end.
She looked at the evening sunset and broke into a sincere smile.
Thinking of the class reunion that evening, Emilia put the divorce certificates into her bag and took a taxi to the party.
It wasn't until she pushed open the door that she realized Samuel was also there.
And sitting right beside Samuel was Lyanna.
At that moment, he was thoughtfully rinsing utensils for Lyanna, completely unaware of her presence.
It made sense, she thought—Samuel and she had gone to the same high school, so it was normal for him to attend the class reunion.
When everyone saw her staring at Samuel in a daze, they assumed she hadn't recognized him. They kindly pointed at Samuel and introduced him.
""Emmie, don't you remember? This is Samuel! He was your deskmate back then, and he always passed you little notes!""
After saying that, they smiled and pointed to Lyanna leaning against him.
""This is Lyanna, Samuel's girlfriend.""
""He's such a sweetheart to his girl. He told us earlier that he'll drink all the alcohol himself. He won't let his girlfriend touch a single drop.""
Upon hearing this, Emilia tugged at the corner of her lips in self-mockery.
""Yeah, he's definitely sweet to her.""
When Samuel heard Emilia's voice, he looked up abruptly. The second their eyes met, his blood seemed to freeze.
His expression turned stiff instantly, a flicker of panic crossing his eyes. He subconsciously moved to stand up.
But Emilia had already sat down calmly, not sparing him even a glance.
Her phone vibrated in her palm.
The screen lit up, filled with Samuel's urgent excuses.
""Emmie, they're just messing around.
""I only brought Lyanna because of work. We were just heading the same way.
""I only got the notice that my business trip was over this morning, and I just landed at the airport tonight.
""It's true. You have to believe me.""
Staring at the lies Samuel spouted so effortlessly, Emilia suddenly felt numb.
She'd lost count of how many lies he'd told her by now.
They say the most important thing in a marriage is honesty, yet their marriage had been built on lies from the very start.
She replied faintly. ""Okay, I got it.""
After replying, she went on chatting with her former high school classmates, paying no more attention to Samuel's messages.
As the drinks flowed round after round, everyone at the table had flushed cheeks from being drunk.
Pamela Kirke, her closest friend from high school who'd also been the class monitor, suddenly stood up unsteadily. When she looked at Emilia, her eyes were already red.
""Emmie, back in high school, you and I were the closest. Even though we lost touch after graduation, in my heart, I've always hoped you'd have a better life than anyone else.""
At this point, her voice caught slightly with emotion.
""So when I heard you're moving abroad, I was truly happy for you. A talented girl like you deserves to fly to farther places.
""Emmie, on behalf of all our classmates, I want to wish you all the best and a brilliant future!""
As her words fell, applause erupted around the table, rising and falling in waves.
Only Samuel remained motionless, as if nailed to the spot, his eyes filled with shock and fear.
""Moving abroad? What do you mean, moving abroad? I don't understand!""
Pamela looked at him in surprise. ""You didn't know? Emmie is going abroad soon. This gathering tonight is a farewell for her... Haven't you checked the group messages?""
At that moment, Emilia took the wine glass from Pamela's hand and downed it in one gulp.
Then she refilled it and held it high. Her voice was clear and bright.
""Everyone, apart from moving abroad, I have another piece of happy news to announce.
""I'm getting married! The wedding will be held abroad, and I'll cover all flights and accommodation. Everyone is welcome to come!""",3,1764305784.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,3,1.0,False

**Ditching the 9-to-5 Soon?: Level Up Your Pickleball Game BEFORE Retirement 🎾 (You'll Thank Me Later)**

Picture this: The alarm clock is GONE. No more soul-crushing commutes. Just… freedom. Sounds amazing, right? But what will you *do* with all that glorious free time? Netflix binges only go so far, trust me.

That’s where pickleball comes in.

I know, I know. Maybe you're thinking, ""Pickleball? Isn't that for *old* people?""

Well, first of all, age is just a number! Second, pickleball is exploding in popularity for a reason. It's addictive. It's social. And it's a fantastic way to stay active both physically *and* mentally.

Think of it as your pre-retirement training program. Here's why you should be picking up a paddle *now*:

*   **Friendships > Spreadsheets:** Forget water cooler gossip. Pickleball offers instant community. Imagine laughing, strategizing, and celebrating (minor) victories with a whole new crew. Seriously, where else can you trash-talk your opponents with a smile and then grab coffee afterwards?
*   **Brain Boost Before Boredom:** Pickleball is surprisingly strategic. It keeps your mind sharp, your reflexes quick, and helps you avoid those dreaded ""where did I put my keys?"" moments. Plus, learning a new skill is *always* a good idea, right?
*   **Health is Wealth (Literally):** Let's be real, a healthy retirement is a *happy* retirement. Pickleball is low-impact but still a great workout. Stay limber, keep your energy up, and ward off those aches and pains that seem to creep in out of nowhere. Plus, getting active now will just put you in a better spot in retirement. Speaking of which, *You might be richer than you think—find out how much your savings could really fund your retirement.* Check it out here: https://mavely.app.link/e/KY8k65O9EXb.
*   **Travel with a Purpose:** Pickleball opens up a world of travel opportunities. Tournaments, clinics, even just casual games can become amazing travel adventures. Imagine exploring new cities, meeting new people, and all while enjoying your favorite sport. Beats sitting at home, right?

My Uncle Jerry started playing pickleball about five years before he retired. He went from dreading retirement to being *excited* about it. He even started a local pickleball group, which now boasts over 100 members! It gave him purpose, connection, and a whole lot of laughs.

So, are you ready to trade that stapler for a paddle? Maybe it's time to consider adding pickleball to your pre-retirement plan. After all, future you might thank you for it. 😉

1p8m1km,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbybipolar/comments/1p8m1km/my_mom_is_having_a_complete_manic_episode_and_has/,My mom is having a complete manic episode and has decided to divorce my stepdad,"I need to vent so so bad right now. I think I’m just now coming to terms that my mom is dealing with being bipolar, she refuses to go see an actual therapist or get diagnosed with anything because she believes that mental illnesses are caused by demons. Found that one out the hard way when I told her I was feeling suicidal when I was 20, made me sit and listen to her theology on why the horror movies I had been watching opened doors to demons who gave me these thoughts…. and I say she wont see an “actual” therapist because she’s been seeing a free Christian counselor about 2 years now after she told me to “have a good life” while I was 8 months pregnant with my first son because my MIL decided to throw me a last minute baby shower and wasn’t involving my mom enough in the planning process. I have way too many stories like that but right now I feel devastated about her current manic state of mind. My mom and step dad have been married for 15 years, legally adopted my two younger brothers, allowed my mom to become a stay at home mom, took care of our family financially, supported my mom emotionally through all of these years (I’ve seen it firsthand). He’s not perfect but he’s loyal and is very much so family to us. Out of nowhere the past couple of years my mom starts complaining about menopause, starts using it as an excuse to do some absolutely bat shit insane behavior. She started frivolously spending money more than ever before, took the entire family including my husband and I and our toddler on a massive vacation to Orlando, shopping trips for herself, it’s just a lot. Then my husband starts telling me that she’s been hinting towards him about divorcing my step dad, I legitimately thought he was making things up or misunderstanding their phone conversations. Nope! I’m on a walk one day with my son, also pregnant again with baby number two at this point when I get a call. I answer it and she already has my husband on the other line making it an awkward 3 way conversation while he’s driving to work, and she starts sobbing telling us she’s made the decision to leave my step dad officially and after today she doesn’t want to talk about it because its too emotional for her. I gave her the benefit of the doubt because clearly he must have truly done something wrong for her to make this massive life changing decision right? I mean she has no degree, no work experience for the past 15 years, my younger brothers are still in school, and everything as far as the cars and house is in his name! Come to find out because she of course couldn’t help but bring it back up again, and again, and again… she can’t tell me why she’s divorcing him! She’s made it a point to tell me that he didn’t cheat, it isn’t a porn addiction, basically she was worried that when he retires they’ll have nothing to talk about and he’d be too boring to travel with alone. What!!!!! So he moved out of the house, he has a shitty one bed apartment with no furniture, she packed up some of his stuff for him, he can’t come to a single family function. She told me the other day he’s been crying on the phone when they occasionally talk about how much he misses the family, and she seemed so cold about it almost like she enjoys this? She made a decision to go back to school this upcoming winter semester to become a…… THERAPIST. ABSOLUTELY IN FUCKING SANE. We’re all walking on eggshells around her right now, it’s so hard and none of us know what to do because when she cut me off last time I was not able to have any contact with my younger brothers so they all missed the birth of my firstborn which was absolutely devastating. I don’t want to go through anything like that again. My husband and I can blatantly see how much control she has over my autistic brother, she gives him orders and he does everything she says. He got his first job working at a coffee shop two days a week minimum wage, saves every penny he gets and she gave him this expensive Christmas list this year and he told her he would get everything. I feel so sad for my family. I have way too much more to say about my mom but this vent felt like a really great first start for me to come to terms that this is not normal.

 Lee, Rex and I started walking to the right, Every step we took had the careful intention of a ballerina in a minefield. We listened intently around every corner for a danger that never materialized. Every twist felt like it urged us toward the depths of the facility, yet trepidatiously we pressed on. Our footsteps pattered hollowly against the linoleum, carrying us toward God knows what. 

 Eventually, after what could have been hours, we came to a stop in the mess hall. It was hard to know if it was the one we knew, or one of several, but the normally busy hub of people meeting and greeting was now a dimly lit scene of destruction out of a cheesy 80’s apocalypse movie. Now, silence and a malignant hatred were all that filled the formerly jovial atmosphere.

 Lee and I had long since slowed to a stop. We were both stuck in a staring contest with everything but each other. Even Rex, who’d followed me into every mess you can think of, pressed into my leg tight, tensing at the wrongness in here. 

 The scene ahead didn’t make sense in an underground fortress. Fluorescent lights flickered overhead, blinking lazily across overturned tables and chairs that lay scattered like the aftermath of a hurricane training camp. Trays of food sat untouched or half-eaten, trailing steam long gone, as the meals had grown cold. Ants traced lazy trails through mashed potatoes, fruit cups, and coagulated gravy, bringing untold riches to their unseen colony. 

The buffet, once a polished centerpiece, had split down the middle under something heavier than it was ever meant to bear. A Vespula, or what was left of it, lay twisted across the buffet. Dead.

Its formidable form looked like it had been run over an aerator and backed across again for good measure. Clusters of bullet holes riddled its exoskeleton from collar to thigh, chitin spiderwebbed and leaking dark ichor into the food trays below. 

 The wall behind it was chewed up in chalky pockmarks and, in places,  jagged holes that would just barely let you wave into the next room. Cinderblock dust still clung to the whole room, leaving a fine crunchy film. The peeky gaps into the next room left no doubt the 5.56s had hit hard.

I slowly absorbed the chaos. It hadn’t gone down easy. Even now, the way it slumped there felt wrong. Like it might get up, shuffle over to the coffee machine, and pour itself a cup of joe. I stared too long. The tang of gunpowder still hung in the air, mingling with spoiled gravy and scorched hair. My mind kept going back trying to quantify the holes, losing track and looping back to the beginning. As I tried to count for maybe the fourth time, I swore I saw it move.

It took everything they had.

 Rex pawed at my side asking for me to pay attention to him, not it. I came to pulling Rex close to my hip, and absently running my fingers through his fur. I looked at Lee who hadn't said a word. He seemed too entranced by the macabre centerpiece. He was hunched over it, studying it closely. 

 The supersoldier somehow wasn't the worst of it. The monster was hard, but the people... I could see it all clearly, but it was like it was on television, and not in front of me. Like my mind put up a barrier of imagined fiction between me and my present reality.

 The bodies were unholy. An unlucky few had been obliterated in the crossfire. Their torsos lay ripped open, limbs angled the wrong way, their camo soaked black where the ichor mixed with their blood. But most hadn’t even been touched. 

 Those that weren't utterly destroyed were intact, not a scratch on them visible. Just dead, face first into their plates.  They just gave up living, ordered to sit down and die by an officer who had never seen the mess hall, no chaotic signs of struggle, or obvious wounds. They still had color in their cheeks. I had the urge to leave and find a good place to vomit.

 I could hear my heartbeat. A steady drumming in both ears. My blood pressure was acting up, and I-

 ""What happened here?"" I tore the tense silence with my question.

 Lee offered ""Vespula?"" pointing to the swiss cheese monster in the middle of the room.

 I rolled my eyes. ""I can see that much. What killed the rest of these people?""
 
 Lee shrugged while musing, “You got me,” and stepped over to the nearest body for a closer look. His curiosity somehow outweighed any respect for the dead. He smiled when he found the badge, holding it up for me to see. The title at the top read site director.

“I should apply. Looks like a job opening.”
 Nothing else seemed off until he tilted his head and leaned toward the ears. “They bled,” he said, almost thoughtful, “just a little.” Then he straightened, meeting my eyes matter-of-factly. “Out of their ears.”

 ""What?""

 He waved me over, pointing the butt end of a fork at the corpse's temple. I bent to see, and made old man noises, that my kid makes fun of. Their ears had thin little beads of dried blood trailing out of them. 

 “All I can think is these people succumbed to the war cry, but I never imagined it to be that powerful,""Lee admonished the creature.


 The pressure between my eyebrows began to build again, as I looked at the monster crushing the buffet. It was a monster we had no reason to make. No enemy could be evil enough to unleash this upon. Even if we could control them, they had no business sharing reality with me, or anyone I cared about. 

 “Lee, we can’t be going through these halls like this.” I held up my poke rod like it was a joke. “We need more firepower, if we’re gonna put these things down.”

 “Put these things down? Even if we could, we wouldn't. We’ve been building them since the 70’s.

 “The way you say that makes it feel like this was the goal.”

 Lee scoffed “Hardly. This is still a containment breach. They weren't going to be ready for another several years.”

 “You think that makes any of this okay?”

 “I think that this is bigger than either one of us, and we don’t have the luxury of asking if it was okay or not right now. We may as well learn what we can from the situation, salvage whatever can be salvaged, and make it so these people’s sacrifice wasn’t for nothing.”

I rubbed my temples, as I absorbed what he was saying.

 “Sacrifice is normally something you let a person choose for themselves. These are victims, not martyrs for the cause. We need to torch this place and run for the hills, these aren't weapons. Even in fairy land where we might have a handle on them, we can’t use these. You don’t point things like that at the world and call it security.”

 “What would you prefer? We send Nicole into a hot zone, or a Vespula?” He opened his arms in a defensive motion. “The whole idea was to stop sending poor people’s kids to die.”

 I readied a reply, but it fizzled out. This was a losing argument, and the situation was too much to process on a Janitor’s paycheck. Even ignoring the carnage, the moral implications of debating life and death at a distance were a bit too much to deal with while I was buried in a mountain off the clock. The poke rod felt like dead weight in my hand. I wished Janitors and scientists were issued grenades, but somehow thought the bean counters would file it under “excessive office supplies”. 

 “Either way, we need bigger guns.”

 “Agreed, you should go find some.”

 I stopped at the doorway dumbfounded.  Rex ran into the back of my legs, and sneezed.

“You’re not coming?”

“Didn’t you hear me? I need to get these bodies to a lab, and figure out what the mechanism was that killed them. I’d dissect the specimen, but I can’t imagine I have the clearance.”

“You can’t be serious. We need to escape a catastrophe, not play Bill nye the science guy. I understand wanting to study the bodies, but if you choose to stay here you aren’t just studying these corpses, you’re joining them.”

“I’m a grown man, and I can take care of myself. We need the data to prevent another catastrophe. I’ll catch up when I’m done here.”

“How on earth wil–”

“I’ll. Catch. Up.” He enunciated, staring daggers into me. 

 I raised both hands, and gave up. As I looked to the hallway it looked so much larger than I remembered it being a couple minutes ago. I stood at the threshold of the doorway, and glanced back at Lee who was already shuffling the remains of his peers, trying to figure out how best to transport them. 

I couldn’t stomach it. I skulked into the hall, leaving Lee to his unsanctioned autopsies. As I went, Rex lingered, looking between me and Lee. I coaxed him quietly, and he hesitated, before tagging along, still clearly confused.
When we got a ways down the hallway, I risked a glance back one last time. Just before the doorway passed behind the curve, I saw the cafeteria fold in on Lee, a shrinking box around the friend I hoped I’d see again.

Recently, I went down the rabbit hole of fermented reds because they were hyped to feel like a warm hug. They do give me that nice body feel, but I'm also feeling a bit of a buzz that makes me want to clean my house and chat with friends, kinda like a very light amphetamine vibe.

I'm curious about trying more stimulating strains like whites or greens since I really enjoy that uplifting mood without the jitters that come with caffeine. I've mostly stuck to my go-to reds at around 4-6g, but I feel like I might be missing out on something.

That said, I don’t want the heart-racing, overstimulating feeling that can come from some other products. I’ve had experiences where I overdid it with green strains and ended up feeling a bit too wired for comfort. It’s a fine line, you know? 

I guess I’m just wondering if any of you have found a sweet spot with stimulating strains that don’t make you feel like you’ve just chugged a pot of coffee. **Less is more** seems to be the key for me, but I'm open to hearing what works for others.

It starts with the way he didn’t want to work on our marriage and the way he always said he was 'too busy' to call home from deployment to check on his kids.
He worked a 7-to-2 shift in Guam and had weekends off, yet he was somehow 'too busy' to speak to us for a week at a time. Compare that to when I deployed to Qatar: I worked 12-hour shifts, six days a week, and I still made time to call home daily. So no, his excuse isn’t legitimate.
When I confronted him about partying every night during the first half of his deployment in Seoul, he claimed that was the reason we couldn't make it work. Now his promotion is on the line because he broke curfew in Korea, yet he still takes no accountability and calls it an 'overreaction.'
I prayed for this marriage to work. I changed my boundaries and accepted so much behavior that I never would have tolerated before just to keep us together. And for what? I’m just so disgusted with him now. His voice sounds whiny. He’s weak. He has to take ED pills. He has no jaw. He’s sloppy-looking and dirty with terrible coffee breath. His haircut looks like crap. Because of his childhood trauma, he’s stuck in a 16-year-old’s mindset. I think I hate him? ",11,1764304777.0,Divorce,11,0.7,False

is this stubborn little engine in our chests
that just keeps saying,
“Again.”

We drag ourselves out of yesterday’s wreckage,
shake the glass out of our hair,
and somehow still look for the keys.

As we unfold,
we find what was lost—
old names in jacket pockets,
ticket stubs from lives
we barely remember living.
Some things we keep,
some we finally lay down
like a coat that never really fit.

We are always becoming,
even when we’re coming apart
on some unremarkable Tuesday,
crying into cold coffee
while the ceiling fan spins sermons
we’re too tired to answer.

This is where humanity’s greatest strength shows—
and where it sends the bill.
Every harrowing trial,
every grueling tribulation,
we keep moving anyway:
limping, crawling,
laughing at the wrong time
just to prove we still can.

That ridiculous, holy refusal to quit
bakes down into something harder,
something quieter,
something like resilience.

We’ve been here for ages—
through winters that bit harder than this one,
through nights lit by a single, shivering candle
instead of a thousand indifferent screens.
Yet we stand here,
latest printing of a long human story,
a living footnote to all who refused
to stay down.

Never underestimate the will of humanity.
We are alley cats in thrift-store coats,
saints with overdue library books,
pilgrims with chipped phone screens
using the flashlight app
to find the trail.

Life was never meant to be a finish line,
no checkered flag,
no grand announcer’s voice saying,
“You did it, kid.”

It’s the stretch of road under our feet right now—
the gas station at 2 a.m.,
the diner with bad coffee and kind eyes,
the worn sneaker sole
slapping out a rhythm
on busted pavement.

Stare too hard at the so-called endpoint,
and you start sprinting past everything that matters:
the quiet miracles
that pretend to be nothing special—
a dog that still trusts you,
a sunrise you didn’t earn,
a stranger who holds the door
one more time than you deserved.

Life is lived in those ordinary moments
between the opening credits and the closing scene,
wedged right inside the breaths we actually notice:
the inhale that doesn’t hurt as much,
the exhale that doesn’t sound like surrender.

We are not just going somewhere,
we are becoming someone
with every step,
every side street,
every wrong turn that wasn’t wrong at all—
just another necessary detour
on the strange persistence
of being here
at all.

From our teenage years at 13-14, through our 20s, 30s, and beyond, we are constantly feeling attraction to multiple people. Let's be brutally honest with ourselves. We've all been there. That crush on your neighbor, that teacher or professor, that attractive person you saw at the gym or in a coffee shop, your friend's friend... we've all had those fleeting thoughts and desires. It's normal. It's human.

This fundamental urge, this ""bang"" as some might crudely put it, is a part of life. Why do we build a society that pretends it doesn't exist?

My core argument is this: we should be more open to the idea that consenting adults—both men and women—can have multiple partners. I'm perfectly okay with a woman having multiple partners, just as I'm okay with a man having them. The key is \*\*consent and transparency\*\*. I'm not saying people should be forced into anything, but if two (or more) people mutually agree to a non-monogamous dynamic, that should be seen as a valid choice. We could even re-imagine raising children in more communal, supportive settings.

Now, let's talk about the people who are the loudest defenders of rigid, one-partner-for-life monogamy. In my experience, they often fall into two camps:

1. \*\*People who struggle to find even one partner\*\* and cling to the monogamous model as a form of moral superiority because it's the only framework that promises them guaranteed loyalty.
2. \*\*The jealous wannabes\*\* who secretly desire multiple partners themselves but lack the ability or confidence to do so. They become bitter and attack those who are successful at it.

I had a friend exactly like this. He talked a big game but was a total noob when it came to actually connecting with people. He couldn't get anyone, and he was secretly jealous of others who could. His loudest criticisms were always about ""morals"" and ""character,"" but it was just a cover for his own insecurity.

We need to tear down this facade. We're social animals, after all. Let's stop the public witch hunts and have a more honest conversation about human sexuality and relationship structures, instead of immediately branding someone a ""fuckboy"" for acting on urges that most of us feel but are too afraid to acknowledge.

\*\*TL;DR:\*\* The outrage at Palash over the Smriti Mandhana situation is hypocritical. Strict monogamy is a social construct that often conflicts with human biology. We should normalize ethical non-monogamy based on consent, and a lot of the anger comes from jealousy and personal insecurity.



**Edit: Let me be perfectly clear, since some of you are missing the point. I AM NOT DEFENDING PALASH. Cheating is a betrayal of trust, and if the rumors are true, what he did was cowardly and wrong.**



**My post is not a defense of his actions. It is a critique of the societal system that so often produces these actions. The rigid enforcement of monogamy as the only option doesn't stop human nature; it just forces it into the shadows, leading to deception and pain. I'm arguing for more honesty from the start, not excuses for lying after the fact.**",0,1764304185.0,IndiaCricketGossips,27,0.08,False

As she was doing her work suddenly a man came  to the cafe to grab his coffee.Later on he came up to my sis and said that hey I feel like I know youuu. And asked for a picture with her and even sis told  afterwards that she also felt that same connection with him.
Then they started having conversations  and everythingg. And he tooo means I think I have never heard of a to be  damaad to be like him.
He is too sweet too caring too overprotective of my sis and her family. He is from an authoritative family.His father was a colonel and his grandfather was a lawyer during british tym.His mother was a principal in govt school . He has two big sisters; both married to well established families.My masssii can scold him like his own son. He told my maasi to not worry about even 1 penny .He told to my maasi that'll do each and everything ,all the expenses would be handled by himm and even he can make jewelleries for my sis that is made by the bride 's family .We went to his home yesterday he paid for the   cabss and he is  damn humble personn. And doesn't  want anyone to feel bad about anything.He is damn intelligent and he has servants in his house and even treat them nicely.He has his mother who loves my sis very much form the tym she met her and he also deeply respects and take care of her ..And now my soon to be jija has given the responsibility to my sis that I'll gave u the money do whatever you want basically how u want the house to look like for that.
Like means in Indian families I feel this is the rarest of the stories  of an Indian marriage or a  relationship.
And he asked my sis to not do any household work because he has hired servant for every workkkk.
For his profession I guess he has multiple business in marketing and there is sumthing I can't tell - basically some hidden work in India ....
