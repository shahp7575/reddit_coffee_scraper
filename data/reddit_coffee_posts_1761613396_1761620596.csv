I never really watched TV shows before, but now I do because it helps distract me from thinking about the hospital whenever I come home.

Here are some little things that I do outside of work that make me happy! Sometimes a few little things combined can make a really good day overall~

Watching a show with my cat
Playing a cozy video game for 20 minutes (ex. animal crossing)
FaceTiming my partner or a friend
Doing my makeup (more on days off)
Eating a good cookie or other sweet
Making my own iced coffee
Cuddling with the cat
Decorating my home, or planning decorations
Calling family
Read on the kindle for 10 minutes
Paint my nails (if the current rotation allows)
Choosing my earrings for the next day

Nothing seems to shift it. I‚Äôve also had a lot of nausea and have thrown up what looks like coffee  grounds but not black, more of a medium/dark. 
I have a very strict diet of none triggering foods only, I don‚Äôt drink alcohol or use street drugs. I do vape.

1ohydj2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pitt/comments/1ohydj2/where_to_go_on_a_date_anyone_have_any_cool_places/,Where to Go on a Date? Anyone Have any Cool Places?,"This campus is huge and has a ton of little cafes and restaurants, somebody on here has to know some cool ones. I need a place that is allergy friendly *and* budget friendly *and* clean *AND* where the customers and staff have passable hygiene.

First off, I refuse to go to Divvy's. I know it's a popular location but I just can't bring myself to financially support the guy in any way after what he did to those people. The thought of my money going to fund one of his depraved parties makes me feel sick. What the fuck did he need all of that oil for?

Also I don't drink coffee and Divvy's offers little else. They do have Nesquik chocolate milk, which is nice, but buying one on a date feels a little bit juvenile, you know? I might as well bring a silly straw and propeller hat, and wear my 'Mom's Biggest Special Boy' shirt at that point. They also sell orange juice but I hate orange juice too, it gives me heartburn. I need to find a location that can sell me a drink that I can look like a dignified adult while drinking.

Another issue is the budget. I currently have an impressive total salary of zero ($0.00) dollars, so these places need to be cheap. If my date orders a $15.00+ item or items I'm not paying for that shit, at that point I'm going to strategically fake a medical emergency and bail the fuck out. Have you seen this economy? Do I look like a fucking charity to you? 

And lastly, this place needs to be a reasonable distance from the center of the main campus. I do have a car but I like to conserve gas. Again, have you seen this economy? And I need get my steps in, so I'd prefer somewhere I can walk to, preferably within 20 minutes. This is mostly due to time, but honestly the further away, the better. Having to walk a far distance helps me filter out the weak, if I'm taking someone on a date I don't want to hear any of this ""that's too far"" and ""can we rest for a second?"" shit. Call me harsh but god forbid I want to date someone who can walk at the same pace as me, can't have shit these days.

Anyway thank you in advance for your suggestions!

1ohyd2f,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ohyd2f/i_left_heaven_last_month_but_now_heaven_wants_me/,"I Left Heaven Last Month, but Now Heaven Wants Me Back.","Hey everyone.  
It‚Äôs Matteo again.  
Or what‚Äôs left of me, anyway.

If you read my last post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1oeq6sj/i_was_sent_by_the_vatican_to_help_a_group_of/) about the ‚Äúresearch mission‚Äù in Sweden, you know most of my story already.  
You know what I saw under the ice. You know about the thing that, at minimum, remembers being an angel. I thought the worst part was over when I got back to Rome. I was wrong.

\---

Three days ago, shortly after I made my previous post, I received a hand-delivered letter.

Same red wax seal, same Vatican crest, except this time there was another mark pressed beneath it, as if it had been stamped before the Vatican crest was stamped over it: a faint triangle inside a circle.

***‚ÄúReturn immediately for debriefing regarding the disappearance of Sister Lucia.‚Äù***

No signature.  
When I arrived, they didn‚Äôt take me to any office; I was led through a maze of corridors I had never seen before, and down a spiral staircase that delved deep beneath the city. I was brought into a dimly lit room. Within the room were two other people, one whom I recognized as my Bishop, and another man, whom I did not recognize, but seemed to be wearing a lab coat. My blood froze in my veins when I noticed the now familiar insignia emblazoned on the left breast pocket of the lab coat-wearing man. A triangle, with a circle surrounding it, touching at the three points.

""Sit, Matteo. We have much to discuss,"" my Bishop began, a grave look on his face, ""This is Dr. Kruger, he oversees the facility where you were sent recently, and has brought some disturbing allegations against you."" He finished.

Dr. Kruger smiled slyly and turned a laptop to face me.  ""We have evidence to suggest that you were directly involved in Lucia's disappearance,"" he said, poison dripping from every word.

They showed me camera footage, presumably from the morning of my departure from Sweden. It showed the van that had picked us up from and dropped us back off at the airport, dropping *three* people back off, instead of just two. The camera feed switched to show another angle. This time, I could see the three figures walking down an otherwise empty terminal before the two on the outside grabbed the one in the middle and pulled them into a maintenance service door. The footage fast-forwarded, showing only two figures walking out.

In the video, it looked like Father Gabriel and I were responsible for Lucia‚Äôs disappearance.

I was unable to speak. The rage building in me had almost reached a fever pitch when the doctor continued.

""The other person of interest, whom you may know as Father Gabriel, has already agreed to cooperate with us in this 'investigation,'‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúIt would be in your best interest to do the same. If you refuse, your Church will denounce you publicly. You‚Äôll spend the rest of your life in a prison cell. Or worse, in one of ours.‚Äù

I looked to my Bishop for any sign of understanding; instead, I saw him looking at the floor, seemingly unable to make eye contact with me.

Then Dr. Kruger slid a folder across the table. Inside: a plane ticket north, and a single phrase typed on Vatican letterhead, with a wall of blacked-out text beneath it.

***‚ÄúTheta-7 - Reactivation phase.‚Äù***

The doctor took my phone, and he and I departed that night.

\---

***""It looks like I'm headed back to Heaven.""***

I thought to myself. I told myself I accepted because I wanted answers, but the truth is, I accepted because I was afraid; I had no doubt that they would be capable of framing me with the disappearance, and even less doubt that they would dispose of me at a moment's notice, if I didn't comply.

They flew me in under the same gray sky and drove me down the same road back to that same blasphemous mountain.

The sign on the road was still there, but this time it read slightly differently:

***‚ÄúWelcome to Heaven, permanent population: 3.‚Äù***

The gate, which had already looked foreboding, now had a guard stationed on either side of it. Each guard was holding a rifle, and at their hip hung something that looked similar to the small metal detectors that one would see in an airport, being used by security, only these were seemingly coated in a shiny silver paint.

Inside, the chapel was rebuilt. The ice beneath the glass had been fully refrozen, and additional metal rings and wiring were installed within it. The observation deck around the chapel had been removed, and instead, a command center was placed just outside of the chapel doors, with line of sight and vocal access to the chapel. In the center of the chapel, surrounding the podiums where Gabriel, Lucia, and I once stood, was a snake of thick black wires, trailing out into the center of each wall of the room except the one on which the entrance was. Beyond the glass, I could see what appeared to be three metallic spheres, pulsating gently in a familiar pattern... Three pulses, a pause, then three pulses.

Erik met me in the hallway, thermos in hand. He looked thinner than before, eyes sunken, movements slower, as if the air itself weighed down upon him.

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt think you'd come back,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt think I had a choice,‚Äù I replied.

A familiar voice came from behind me. ‚ÄúNone of us did, kid.‚Äù

I turned and saw that Father Gabriel was standing at the end of the corridor, wearing the same threadbare coat as before, chewing away at his gum as usual. He looked worse than I remembered; hair gone gray, eyes sharp but hollow.

‚ÄúThey brought you back, too?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúApparently, the prodigal sons get round-trip tickets now, but I'm sure you know it wasn't a first-class seat,‚Äù he said with a bitter laugh.

Erik sighed. ‚ÄúBoth of you, keep your voices down. The mountains have ears, you know, and we just so happen to be standing inside of one right now.‚Äù

He led us deeper into the facility, towards what I knew would be our new homes.

\---

Our quarters were in the same wing as before, though locks on the outside of the doors had been installed since our last visit. I guess what Gabriel said the first time we saw this place wasn't as far off as we had originally thought. Like before, the wing had three doors. Our two doors were open, but the third one was closed.

We were locked in our *cells* for the night. A lone guard patrolled outside our rooms, carrying an identical loadout to the ones guarding the front gate. My mind lingered on the strange silver device slung similar to how a nightstick would be on a police officer's belt. I thought to ask, but I doubt I would have received a proper answer.

That night, a folded slip of paper appeared under both our doors. No signature, just a symbol drawn in graphite: three concentric circles crossed vertically to the middle by a single line, with a solid circle in the very center.

And four words written beneath it:

***‚ÄúThe First Has Heard.""***

\---

The next morning, Dr. Kruger assembled everyone in the rebuilt chapel. He stood at the command center like a general surveying a battlefield. Erik watched from a console nearby, expression unreadable. A sphere, similar to the ones embedded in the walls but smaller, sat alongside us in the center of the floor, pulsing the same pattern as the others.

‚ÄúToday we resume resonance testing,‚Äù Kruger announced. ‚ÄúFathers Matteo and Gabriel, as well as a modified RDC, designated RDC-L-1, will serve as focal conduits.‚Äù

Gabriel muttered, ‚ÄúGuess that‚Äôs our fancy new job title. Could have just labeled us 'bait.'‚Äù

They handed us printed sheets of meaningless syllables; vocal tones arranged like chants with no language.

Kruger called it a ‚ÄúPhase-Lock Chant.‚Äù

Gabriel squinted at the page. ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ we're speaking in tongues for science now?‚Äù

Kruger smiled thinly. ‚ÄúI suppose, if you prefer that terminology.‚Äù

They dimmed the lights, and we began to recite. The hum beneath the floor shifted with each line, syncing to our voices. Then a whisper surfaced under the noise:

***""Be not afraid.""***

It wasn't the same voice from before. It was a feminine voice, soft, far away, as if I were hearing it from underwater. Gabriel stopped reading, visibly trembling.

""Keep cadence!‚Äù Kruger snapped.

We continued to recite from the page, but nothing else happened. It was as if the facility itself held its breath after that whisper.

Even Kruger looked uneasy, though he tried to hide it behind a professional scowl. Erik avoided my gaze, typing something rapidly into his console before shutting it off.

We were dismissed for ‚Äúobservation rest,‚Äù while the scientist poured over their data.

Back in the corridor, Gabriel leaned against the wall, his usual sarcasm gone.

‚ÄúYou heard it too, didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù he asked.

I nodded.

‚ÄúFemale voice. Calm, like she was teaching, not warning?‚Äù he continued the question.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said quietly. ‚ÄúAnd it didn‚Äôt feel quite as‚Ä¶ judgemental.‚Äù

Gabriel laughed once, bitterly. ‚ÄúGood. Maybe our guardian angel finally showed up to apologize.‚Äù

Before I could answer, Erik appeared at the end of the hall, thermos in hand, face pale.

He motioned for us to follow him to a maintenance room.

Once the door shut, he locked it from the inside and leaned against a panel.

‚ÄúYou two need to forget that voice,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúPretend it never happened.‚Äù

Gabriel frowned. ‚ÄúYou heard it too, didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù

Erik didn‚Äôt answer right away. He took a slow sip of coffee, staring at the floor.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù he said finally. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard her before. Most of us who‚Äôve been here long enough have. We just don‚Äôt talk about it.‚Äù

He rubbed his eyes, looking suddenly old.

‚ÄúWe call her the First Witness. The name isn‚Äôt official. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ Purist folklore, really. They say she was the first person ever to be assimilated into the Field, long before Theta-7 was even built. Before the schism, even. Some think she‚Äôs still in there, a permanent part of it now.‚Äù

Gabriel crossed his arms. ‚ÄúAnd you believe that?‚Äù

Erik looked at him. ‚ÄúSome part of me wants to. The alternative is even more terrifying... That it *is* *her* voice, but it isn't *her* speaking with it.‚Äù

Later that night, I found a small notebook slid under my door. There was no symbol on it this time, but someone had written one sentence in English, with careful handwriting:

***‚ÄúHer name is Anja.‚Äù***

Inside were dozens of entries, scrawled in different inks and styles. Half were impossible to read; just equations, sketches of circles, triangles, or strings of numbers.

But one line, four words repeated over and over, stood out:

***""The Second Has Answered.""***

I showed it to Gabriel the next morning.

He flipped through a few pages and sighed. ‚ÄúLooks like we‚Äôre officially prophets in the  madhouse now, they've even given us pamphlets.‚Äù

\---

Kruger called us to the chapel again before lunch. He didn‚Äôt mention yesterday‚Äôs voice. No one did. This time, the sphere in the center glowed brighter, the rhythm faster; three pulses, pause, three again, like before.

I could feel it in my chest.

We began the chant. Halfway through, Erik‚Äôs monitor emitted a shrill tone. He shouted something to the technicians, but they didn‚Äôt move fast enough. The hum deepened, vibrating through the floor, the walls, the marrow in my bones.

Then I heard it again. Not the soft, feminine voice from yesterday, but the booming, thunderous voice from our first stay in Sweden.

***‚ÄúThe light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.‚Äù***

Everyone froze.

Kruger screamed, ‚ÄúMaintain cadence!‚Äù but his voice was drowned out by the thundering of the entity's, and the screaming of alarms. The glass under our feet rippled like water. A figure took shape in the reflection; six wings of light and shadow, eyes scattered across them like stars.

Gabriel whispered, ‚ÄúChrist have mercy‚Ä¶‚Äù

The moment he spoke, the reflection looked up.

\---

The alarms blared, every light turned blood-red. Erik grabbed Kruger by the collar.

‚ÄúShut it down! It's feeding on the resonance decay from L-1!""

Kruger gasped, ‚ÄúWe're prepared this time, the lattice will hold!‚Äù

‚ÄúWe weren't prepared for it to consume a near *infinite* source of resonant energy!‚Äù Erik shouted, throwing Kruger aside and running for the emergency panel.

The hum fractured into words again. Two voices, spoken as if they were two members of the same choir; the woman‚Äôs voice, soft but powerful, and the voice of a man that I did not recognize, deep and sincere, filled the room:

***‚ÄúWe await His arrival.‚Äù***

At that moment, the visages of a man and woman appeared above the sphere in the center of the room. The figures floated through the air above the sphere.

The reflection of the entity in the glass below us vanished, and, in an instant, a third human-shaped form appeared alongside the man and woman, similar to them but bright. Brighter than the sun. Brighter than anything I'd ever seen. I could vaguely make out the form of a single halo now encircling the heads of all three figures.

There was a flash of green, and all three began to *unravel* into strings of light. The strings of the two human visages, dim in comparison to the angelic glow of the third who had joined them, wound around each other and descended toward the sphere below.

Shortly after, the string from the entity joined the newly helical structure, weaving in between the two and binding them together. The sphere continued to pulse, but when the helix met with it, the color changed instantly; it pulsed a deep, forest green instead of the usual red.

Erik threw the switch on the emergency panel, immediately darkening every light source except for the bright green sphere in the center of the room, which had now left the tripod it was sitting on and drifted upwards between the figures, unraveling into it.

""I was too late!"" Erik shouted from the emergency panel, ""It's self-sustaining, and the entity has gained full control of L-1's energy output!""

""This is unprecedented,"" Erik gasped, ""no entity has ever attempted to interface with an RDC directly before... they're literally designed to *nullify* Field resonance...""

""That's because it's not *just* an RDC, it's a *synth...""* Kruger started, but was cut off by another choir of voices, this time the *combination of all three of the voices from before*: 

***""For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the¬†Lord; and the¬†Lord¬†hath sent us to destroy it.""*** 

***---***

The air split open.

Light erupted from the sphere, no longer green but shifting through every color at once. Radiant, fluid, impossibly alive. It wasn‚Äôt brightness so much as structure: columns of illumination spiraling upward, intertwining, unspooling, and reforming into impossible geometry that my eyes refused to hold.

For a heartbeat, I could see them; the two human visages from before, still suspended above the sphere, their forms no longer made of flesh or flame, but of vibrating matter and energy. Their outlines folded inward on themselves, weaving together, their luminous strands twisting in perfect mirrored motion.

The light didn‚Äôt just rise, it climbed, self-replicating in infinite recursion, folding in on itself like hands folding in the sincerest prayer. Each movement of one line was echoed by the other, creating a lattice of living brilliance that seemed to hum with intelligence.

Somewhere between those two converging threads, a third form began to grow; not emerging from, but being born out of the sphere that their essences wound into. Wings unfolded in fractal patterns. Each feather refracting the light of a thousand collapsing novae, edges rippling with translucent fire. It was beautiful in the way that an erupting volcano might be: inescapable, inevitable, and deeply unsettling.

The figure stabilized in mid-air, the combination of all three previous figures, green sphere shimmering in the center of it where a heart would it. Six wings fully extended, its body a convergence of reflection and void; half blinding, half shadow. Every surface shimmered with shifting symbols that glowed, then vanished, then returned again in different sequences, as if the air itself were writing and erasing scripture faster than it could be read.

It looked alive, but it didn‚Äôt breathe. Instead, the whole room seemed to inhale and exhale for it, every pulse of resonance feeding its existence.

The air grew heavy, and I could feel the pattern of its heartbeat inside my chest.

Three pulses. Pause. Three again.

Behind the radiance, I caught the faintest glimpse of its face or what passed for one. Eyes, infinite in number, turned outward, as if gazing not at us, but through us. And for a moment, *just a moment*, I thought I *recognized* that face.



***""Lucia?""*** Gabriel and I asked in unison.



The entity spoke, not with a voice, but with vibration; an all-consuming resonance that shaped itself into words older than language.



***""Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in this place; escape from the mountain, lest thou be consumed.""***



That was when the world began to tremble.

\---

The hum became deafening. The entire chamber pulsed with blinding green-white light as the entity‚Äôs wings folded inward, then snapped open again as if attempting to crack the firmament itself.

Erik‚Äôs voice cut through the chaos.

‚ÄúThe lattice is feeding it! The whole mountain is coming apart! If we don‚Äôt move now, we‚Äôll be part of the next testament!‚Äù

He yanked a manual override lever on the wall. A series of klaxons screamed to life, and the containment doors around the chapel began to slam shut one by one as pressure built beneath the floor.

‚ÄúMove!‚Äù Erik shouted. ‚ÄúSublevel access hatch, now!‚Äù

Gabriel and I ran first, half-blinded by the light, Kruger close behind us, cursing in German between gasps for air. The steel grates beneath our feet glowed red-hot, warping from the energy. The hum had turned into a heartbeat you could feel in your skull.

We reached the narrow sublevel corridor. Erik dove through last, slamming the hatch behind him as the final seal above failed with a thunderous crack.

A sound like tearing fabric echoed through the mountain; a sound so loud and low it felt like the earth itself was screaming.



Then it happened.



The mountain burst open.



The entire upper structure of Theta-7 erupted in a column of molten light that tore through the stone, splitting it cleanly down the middle. 

Rock, steel, and decades of secrecy were obliterated in an instant, vaporized in a flash of green and white.

The shockwave hit us like an invisible truck. Shrapnel from the supports embedded itself in my back, and I felt a searing pain where flames had just licked at my ankle. The tunnel we were in collapsed behind us in slow motion, stone turning to vapor before it even touched the floor. We stumbled out through a maintenance shaft, barely able to see. The air was a haze of fire and snow. From the exit at the base of the mountain, we could see open sky, quickly being covered by a cloud of debris, with flashes of lightning following shortly behind it.

A figure, vast, radiant, and terrible, rose from the fissure, its six wings unfurled like curtains of light stretching across the storm. Every wingbeat sent sheets of snow and debris cascading down the slopes. Around it, the clouds turned to gold, the sky split open, and the air turned electric with the taste of copper.

We ran. The mountain behind us groaned, the snow beneath our boots glowing from the reflected light. The hum followed us: three pulses, pause, three again. Steady, relentless. We looked back, and a wall of fire was close behind, and gaining on us by the second.

Kruger lagged behind, clutching his briefcase to his chest. Erik pulled him over the edge of a ridge where we had taken cover from the blast coming our way, and tried to hold him to the ground, but Kruger tore himself free, stumbling to the ridge and turning toward the mountain. The words tore from his throat, half prayer, half disbelief.

***‚ÄúMy God... it‚Äôs beautiful‚Ä¶‚Äù***

The fire swallowed him.

For a second, I thought he had been simply annihilated in the blast, but, as the fire passed, we looked up and saw what had become of him. Standing there, rigid and glittering in the radiant green of the pillar of fire, was a Kruger-shaped pillar of salt. Only his briefcase remained, which Erik promptly grabbed.

We got up after the fire had passed and started back running. We sprinted through the storm until our lungs burned, until the ground stopped shaking and the light behind us began to fade. Only when the sound of collapsing stone gave way to silence did we finally stop.

The wind carried a faint hum, softer now, distant. The mountain was gone. In its place stood a crater rimmed with glowing glass.

Gabriel fell to his knees. ‚ÄúWas that‚Ä¶ judgment?‚Äù

None of us could speak to comment, but I think we all felt the same.

The clouds above us began to close, the auroras fading, leaving only the faint green shimmer dancing across the sky.

Erik turned to face the crater one last time, thermos still clutched in his hand. His voice trembled as he spoke.

‚ÄúIf that was judgment, then I have my own sins to atone for.‚Äù

He dropped the thermos onto the snow, steam hissing where it landed.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go,‚Äù he said quietly. ‚ÄúI know somewhere we will be safe.""

\---

I'm posting this now from my own cellphone, which, thankfully, was inside of Kruger's briefcase. There were other things in the briefcase that Erik is still trying to make sense of. Things that, according to him, are *far* worse than just what happened to Father Gabriel and me. 

Erik led us to the main road, where we managed to hitchhike back to a city; we told the terrified driver who picked us up that we were involved in a lab explosion out in the mountains... which wasn't *entirely* false, in our defense. We were dropped off at the hospital, where my ankle and back, as well as various injuries to Father Gabriel and Erik, were treated.

From the city, we made our way back towards the mountains in a minivan purchased with Kruger's organization credit card. ""They won't miss a few this much money, not after a literal mountain *full* of cutting-edge tech worth *billions* just exploded."" He had said, in an attempt to justify the action. Honestly, neither Father Gabriel nor I felt the need to justify it after today.

Instead of going back to Heaven, Erik took us to a cave, tucked deep into a ravine between two mountains. A sign outside of it read, in hand-painted letters:

***""SALVETE AD PURGATORIUM""***

And, in smaller letters below,

""**Quod purgatur, vivet.""**

I could hear an audible sigh from Father Gabriel as we entered the cave, then his usual humor broke the tension: 

***""Well, Lucia is a prophet, confirmed.""*** 

I don't think I'll be going back to Rome. Erik has agreed to answer a *long* list of questions I have about this whole experience, but let's save that for another day- it's well into the witching hour here, and I'm sure we could all use some rest.

Until next time,

I keep thinking about how much money I spent on our anniversary, how I was basically robbed of $700‚Äì$800, and how she broke up with me right after I spent all that money on her. Then she still took that $70 charge for the oura ring subscription a few weeks ago about 3 weeks after our breakup but I don‚Äôt say anything about it. It‚Äôs unbelievable. I wish I could get that money ‚Äî and the time, the energy ‚Äî back.

And what did I get in return? A coffee machine and cologne. I want so badly to direct my anger at her instead of turning it inward, but I can‚Äôt seem to. I still have her on this mountaintop, still believing she‚Äôs the best when she doesn‚Äôt deserve that place anymore. Her family has to see how messed up she is ‚Äî how could they not? You‚Äôd have to be blind not to.

I stood by her through everything ‚Äî even as she went through her dad‚Äôs cancer, something that mirrored my own trauma with my mom‚Äôs death. That was never acknowledged or appreciated. I was constantly made to feel not good enough, like I had to impress her every single day ‚Äî by the person who was supposed to love me. I was never loved for who I truly am, only for who she wanted me to be.

And I keep asking myself ‚Äî what‚Äôs wrong with me? Am I too kind? Too good? Too successful? Too willing to give? Because I gave everything. I dropped everything ‚Äî my time, my energy, my early adulthood ‚Äî all for her. And what do I have to show for it? Diamond earrings she never wore, a Coach backpack she barely used and gave to her mom half the time, a $300 cooking class, birthday dinners, gifts that actually meant something to me.

Meanwhile, I‚Äôm left with a few things ‚Äî colognes, an Apple Watch, a Devils game, a gold chain I‚Äôve worn twice in two years. That‚Äôs what I get from this relationship. Oh, and I guess I got food cooked for me ‚Äî maybe that‚Äôs the consolation prize.

And still, somehow, I‚Äôm made to feel like the loser. Like I‚Äôm the one who‚Äôs nothing, who won‚Äôt amount to anything. And the worst part? She truly believes she‚Äôs in the right. That her feelings are just‚Ä¶ gone.

I'm embarrassed that I haven't left yet and that it happened at all.

We both had been drinking a little but not too much.  It was Saturday night and we had not seen each other in person for 4 days.  I told him I was unhappy he didn't want to be intimate and that so much distance was making me sad.
  We were laying in bed at night.  I knew he had recently gone for coffee with a woman who is flirtatious and I told him I knew about her.  I saw her posting about his work on facebook.  I told him he should put more effort into our relationship instead of emotionally cheating on coffee dates. He was mad I found out and jumped on top of me, striking me in the face/holding my face down on the pillow.  I said he was hurting me, i was pinned down until he stopped.  The next day my neck hurt, there were faint bruises on my chin and forehead and the skin above my lip was scratched red.

I've not really felt like myself since my divorce 2 years ago.  My ex husband was also physically violent and had hit me or been physically abusive on several occasions before I finally left.  
I keep choosing abusive men.  Why do men hit me like this? How does this keep happening?  This boyfriend is the third partner I've experienced physical violence with. I am a depressed, small woman and I live alone now.  I am never violent. I can't believe I'm having problems like this. What personality trait leads to violence?  What am I doing to prevoke this?  I really dont think its my fault but after three people I'm wondering.

He is great and the family is so great. Here‚Äôs the problem, I moved to a more family centered town coming from a town that had too bougie of people. The parents I‚Äôm used to nannying for have huge playrooms with TONS of toys to rotate, backyards with water tables, chalk, bubbles, trampolines, kiddie pools, and sometimes putting ranges or more. Im also used to BUSY BUSY BUSY. normally even at this age with past nanny jobs I‚Äôm immediately flung into packed schedules with grocery shopping, running errands, taking babies to story time at the library, baby gymnastic classes, swim classes, outings to coffee shops, shopping for new toys or baby clothes, or just random target trips. 

With this new family, although their house is lovely, they have all of NK‚Äôs toys in a small wooden playpen and after 3 days of playing with him I‚Äôm already so bored. There‚Äôs a park nearby that we walk to once a day, but it‚Äôs a bit hot still (live in Arizona) and honestly still boring since he isn‚Äôt super mobile yet. I push him on swings, tell him about trees and birds, let him play with tan bark‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs pretty much it.  To make things more interesting for us both, I brought in some letter magnets one day and it was a huge hit with him, but now that‚Äôs all he wants to play with since it‚Äôs new lol. I also brought in some finger paints and did mess free painting so he wasn‚Äôt tempted to eat it (put a paper and paint in a ziploc and let him squish it). 

The mom works from home, my vehicle is in the shop (it will be there for a few weeks) plus they told me that they don‚Äôt take the baby anywhere really and he‚Äôs a stay at home baby for now PLUS have a small swing for him in the backyard, but he‚Äôs not allowed to play back there unless in the swing since they have a pool that‚Äôs not gated. He also doesn‚Äôt like being guided. When I went to paint with him he pulled his hands away and got upset a few times and his mom let me know he‚Äôs super independent and likes to do his own thing‚Ä¶.so I feel kinda stuck right now on what to do with him. I want to keep him and myself entertained and keep him educated. I want to bring in more things like the pikler triangle and some Melissa and Doug food toys that I have in storage sometimes to spice it up, but I know those will also get boring soon. They‚Äôre a no electronics household which I completely stand behind. 

What do you guys do to keep yourself from falling asleep or staring at the clock too much? What kinds of activities can I come up with for super cheap or free (don‚Äôt want to ask for an activity budget right out of the gate) for a one year old who wants to do his own thing and doesn‚Äôt want to be guided?

Maybe I shouldn‚Äôt have taken on this nanny job and searched for something more immediately exciting, but I love this baby and his family so far. I just need more excitement for us both. ",1,1761618999.0,Nanny,6,1.0,False

HI guys, been lurking around the sub for sometime and the tips have been useful. Pretty common CPPS case here, used to sitting all day and long-range cycling. Daily 0.5-1 hour masturbation with edging. Often clinching the pelvis, very tight pelvis muscles and bad habit of holding pee. Going to bed late with under 7 hours of sleep. **Urine frequency and perineal/penis pain are my major concerns**.

I started out having a UTI in early August, intense bladder/urethra pain and peeing 20 times a day, which was fully cured with antibiotics. Second flare-up came in Sept after an intense masturbation. Probably caused by clinching muscle during the 1 hour session. Went to urologist in early Oct for urine and semen cultures, all came back negative. He did find calcification in the prostate and minor inflammation. He did not recommend using antibiotics and gave me painkillers/valium instead to help with sleep. Glan gets irriated by urine, I apply Cerave cream daily and dry to tip with tissue after pee, which helps.

I started stretching, taking supplements (the usual prostate stuff plus cranberry which seems to help with peeing), cutting back coffee and alcohol. Masturbate only around 1-2 time a week without edging. Limited cycling to short communtes, picked up jogging instead (2-3 times 5km weekly). Did a whole bunch of stretches, ""Happy Baby"" seems to help the most, as did jogging at moderate pace. Also tried the pain reprocessing, which helps (I was taught at school in childhood to hold pee), as did spreading my legs more on the work chair. It did flare up a few times after masturbation, eating something spicy or drinking (just one beer, but still...) but I saw improvements every week.

Now the pain in perineal area is 99% gone. No more balloon feeling. Peeing 6-8 times a day which seems normal (I drink around 2.5L). But recently hard flaccid has either flared up or become more noticeable after other symtoms have been subdued. Lost of morning wood, penis sore and stiff balls. Usually goes away after sitting down. Erection seems normal in hardness and size, but sore worsens afterwards. **Is there something I should do instead to fix this issue? Or should I keep doing the same stretches and exercise pattern? Thank you very much.**

\------------------------------------------  
**TL;DR: Got rid of 70% of CPPS symptoms through suggestions on this sub. Hard flaccid (gone after sitting down) with pain on the penis seems to be the only major issue remaining. Any suggestion to fix it?**",1,1761618920.0,Prostatitis,0,1.0,False

Freshman year, I met a really nice guy. We‚Äôll call him J. We became friends and saw each other a lot because we have similar majors. Third week of classes is a cappella auditions. I meet this girl, T, who is super awesome. She and I find out we have tons of classes and become really close really fast. She joins J‚Äôs a cappella group. Almost immediately, they get together. She falls in love with him. However, because she wasn‚Äôt sure if she could handle long distance for 6 months because he was going abroad for fall quarter of the next year, she breaks up with him (despite me telling her not to). J is distraught. A week later, she regrets it (I didn‚Äôt say I told you so, but I was thinking it). However, he doesn‚Äôt take her back. T forbids me from being friends with J (he was actually going to visit me over the summer because he happened to have an internship where I live, and I had to turn him down).

Over the summer and during his quarter abroad they have phone sex even though they‚Äôre not together. He comes back and they start hooking up again. She then tells me that he‚Äôs been saying that I‚Äôm hot since freshman year. She asks me if I feel anything for him and obviously I say no. They hurt each other over this time, and they finally go no contact. 

Fast forward, it‚Äôs currently junior year. T is studying abroad. So J and I are able to be friends again, which is still a little odd because I can‚Äôt tell her. But also, it‚Äôs not her place to tell me who I can and can‚Äôt be friends with. But here‚Äôs where it gets problematic. We are getting really close. Every day we see each other I find out something new about him that matches me. We make each other laugh, we love the same music, we have the same dating values, even the same religious values. Hell, he even wants to be a Rabbi. The closer we get the more I realize how incredibly compatible we are. 

One event changes things. We both go to a mutual friend‚Äôs party. We were talking and some really drunk guy comes up to us and asks if we‚Äôre a thing. I say no, and J acts really weird about it. He then stays until I leave. Then he texts me if I got home okay. Then he asks me out for coffee. Fuck. I turn it into a business thing and say like oh I‚Äôd love to talk about an a cappella collab sure.

It‚Äôs so obviously a date. We‚Äôre just chatting and having a good time together. In order to lightly turn him down, I say that I‚Äôm talking to someone. His face drops. He leaves 15 minutes later. And for some reason, my heart sank.

A week goes by, and I did some soul searching. I think I‚Äôve actually been in love with him since the beginning. One of those slow, friendship to lovers kind of love. Except, if I were to make it a thing, my best friend, T, would never speak to me again. I realized that we are basically made for each other. My heart hurts so much and I just don‚Äôt know what to do. It feels like if I choose my friendship with T I prevent the world from falling apart and keep my integrity, but then I feel like I‚Äôm betraying myself. I hate how my life has come to this. And because I basically turned him down, I have to figure out whether or not I tell him the truth before it‚Äôs too late and he moves on. I‚Äôve been in denial for two years and I just can‚Äôt hide it anymore. I hate lying to myself and to everyone around me. I‚Äôve been asked how I feel about J, and I always lie and say I don‚Äôt like him that way. But deep down, I always have. 

Anyone have any suggestions for my fucked up love life? I feel like the villain in my best friend‚Äôs life but at the same time I feel like I won‚Äôt get the chance to be with someone who was so clearly made for me ever again.",1,1761618483.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

1ohxwfi,https://www.reddit.com/r/JoinKudos/comments/1ohxwfi/sams_club_membership_is_15_right_now_normally_50/,Sam's Club Membership is $15 Right Now (Normally $50) - Here's the Math on Whether It's Actually Worth It,"Sam's Club is running a great promotion through October 31st - Club membership for $15 (70% off) and Plus for $50 (normally $110). 

**TL;DR:** At $15, it's basically risk-free. You only need to save $15 total to break even, which is like 2-3 bulk purchases. Plus has a 100% money-back guarantee, so you can try it and cancel if it doesn't work out.

**The Two Membership Tiers:**

**Club ($15 with promo, normally $50):**

* Access to all 600+ locations
* Scan & Go mobile checkout (skip lines entirely)
* Gas discounts
* Free curbside pickup (no minimum as of Oct 2025)
* 2 membership cards (you + household member)

**Plus ($50 with promo, normally $110):**

* Everything above, PLUS:
* 2% cash back on purchases (up to $500/year = need to spend $25,000 to max out)
* Early shopping hours (8 am-10 am vs 10 am opening)
* Free shipping on $50+ orders
* Free same-day delivery on $50+
* Up to 10 FREE generic prescriptions per month (this alone is huge if you take meds)

**Break-Even Math:**

**Club at $15:** You literally need to spend $60 total to save $15 back (assuming 25% savings vs regular stores). That's like one pack of paper towels + one bulk coffee. Done.

**Plus at $50:** This requires more thought. To break even on the 2% cash back alone, you need to spend $2,500/year ($208/month). BUT there are exclusions - no cash back on alcohol, gas, dairy, gift cards, etc.

However, if you use the free prescriptions, that's easily $12-36/month saved ($144-432/year), which makes Plus worth it by itself if you take meds.

**Who Should Get What:**

**Singles/Couples ‚Üí Club ($15)**

* You probably can't consume bulk quantities fast enough
* Limited storage space
* Just grab toiletries, cleaning supplies, and non-perishables occasionally
* Expected savings: $100-200/year after the $15 fee

**Families of 3-4 ‚Üí Club at $15,** ***maybe*** **Plus at $50**

* Sweet spot for warehouse clubs
* You'll actually use bulk items before they expire
* Expected savings: $400-600/year (Club) or $600-850/year (Plus if using early hours + delivery)

**Families of 5+ ‚Üí Plus ($50)**

* You'll max out the 2% cash back faster
* Early hours = avoid weekend crowds with kids
* Free prescriptions for multiple family members = $$$
* Expected savings: $900-1,400/year after the $50 fee

**Small Business Owners ‚Üí Plus (100%)**

* Office supplies, break room stuff, cleaning products
* 2% back on $25k = $500 annual cash back
* Expected savings: $1,200-2,500/year

**Final Thoughts**

Even if you only go 3-4 times a year for paper towels, toilet paper, and coffee, you'll save way more than $15. The Plus membership at $50 is worth it if you shop weekly, have kids, or take regular prescriptions. The free meds alone pay for the membership. Hope this helps someone!

1ohxv5x,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ohxv5x/aita_over_this_fight_with_my_mom_over_moving_in/,AITA over this fight with my mom over moving in with my girlfriend?,"sorry in advance for this being kind of long
for context: im 19f, turning 20 in literally two hours, and i live with my aunt because my mom had to move in to a two bedroom with her and my two siblings and didnt have space for me. my mom also has bpd.

i went to college for a year before dropping out and moving back home due to mental health stuff, and i‚Äôve gotten a lot better. i‚Äôm a barista, i have a wonderful gf who for this story we‚Äôll call kayla, i adopted a dog, got my drivers license and fixed my car up. i pay rent and insurance and gas and everything on my own. recently my girlfriend and i decided to move in together down where i used to go to school because she still goes there, and we‚Äôre both really excited about it! rents pretty cheap and i think i can transfer down there when it‚Äôs time to move in may (i work for the big coffee corporation.. you know the one.) 

so anyways. my mom got it into her head that on top of my share of the rent, i‚Äôd also be buying all the groceries and utilities (i don‚Äôt know where she got that from) and some other crazy stuff and texted my aunt and siblings saying ‚Äúwe are a team‚Äù and saying that they needed to talk to me and ‚Äúuncover lies i‚Äôve been telling‚Äù (i still have no idea what she‚Äôs talking about.) she called me to tell me we (her, my siblings, and i) were going to have a family meeting over the phone. she said ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not okay with you moving in with kayla‚Äù and went on to say that she doesnt think its going to work out and that she doesn‚Äôt want me locked into a lease, which i‚Äôve already signed. i got upset and told her that she doesnt get to dictate what i do with my life and that she doesnt pay for anything for me, and she started crying and hung up before calling me back. my aunt was in the room when this was all happening and told me that what i said wasn‚Äôt okay and i apologized to my mom, saying that she did do a lot for me and i appreciated it, but she does not get to choose how i live my life. my mom then went on to say that i was basically useless and a fuck-up, said that i wasn‚Äôt going to school (which im going to go to school for free through my job), diminished my job (that i actually really love), said that i have an unreliable car (which is true, but im in the process of getting her fixed up little by little) and said ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt do anything‚Äù. i understand i said this to her too, but to hear her say it to me made me really upset as she never reaches out to me, so she doesn‚Äôt know how well im actually doing. she texts my aunt to spy on me and asks how im doing through her, so she has no clue how hard im working and how im trying my hardest. i hung up on her, and we haven‚Äôt spoken in probably a week. i texted my brother afterwards and asked him wtf was going on, and he said that mom made him sit down with her and my sister to grill me and try to get me to back down from moving. i understand why he did what he did, because my mom is also an abusive alcoholic who will get upset at the smallest things, so he‚Äôs just trying to stay safe, which i understand. i called kayla afterwards and she told me my mom was being crazy. my grandma also called me to let me know she got a lot of texts from my mom and said she was being crazy as well.
i guess the problem is that as much as my mom and i have a difficult relationship and even with her making my childhood a living hell until i moved out, i do still love her because she‚Äôs my mom and im upset that she‚Äôs acting this way. i don‚Äôt think im in the wrong, but im scared that the way she is acting is going to permanently damage our relationship.
i took a nap after work today and had a dream (which i never have) where she was mad at me in the dream for moving in with kayla and locked me in a car with her and my siblings, while i had my dog in my lap. in the dream, i genuinely had to jump out of the car onto a freeway to get away from her and the rest of the dream was me hiding from her. i looked it up afterwards, and it said that jumping out of a car can means wanting to escape a situation in your life. i feel like it‚Äôs my subconscious telling me that if i want to be happy with kayla and in my life, i can‚Äôt be associated with my mom, which i don‚Äôt love.
my birthday is tomorrow, and my brother texted me saying my mom didn‚Äôt get me a gift because ‚Äúi don‚Äôt do anything for her, so what‚Äôs the point?‚Äù and i‚Äôm upset that she‚Äôs not even going to text me happy birthday tomorrow. AITA? and would i potentially BTA if tomorrow she potentially doesn‚Äôt text me and i go no contact with her?",2,1761618195.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

1ohxu0d,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ohxu0d/the_what_if_trap_that_almost_drowned_me_how_i/,"The ""What If"" Trap That Almost Drowned Me ‚Äì How I Broke Free After 8 Years","54M here again ‚Äì yeah, the same guy who chased his ex into oblivion last time. If you caught that post, cool; if not, quick recap: 8 years down the drain with a quiet ""I need space"" that hit like a freight train. But chasing was just phase one. Phase two? The endless ""what if"" spiral that turned nights into torture sessions.

You know the drill: What if I'd said less that one fight? What if she saw how much I changed? What if her new thing crashes and she crawls back? I'd replay our best days like a bad rom-com on loop, convincing myself one more text could rewrite the ending. Spoiler from the guy who tried: It doesn't. It just carves deeper grooves in your brain, making every quiet moment a battlefield.

Rock bottom was month 2 ‚Äì staring at the ceiling at 3 AM, heart racing like I'd run a marathon, wondering if I'd ever feel steady again. That's when I decided enough. No more mental reruns. Here's what yanked me out ‚Äì raw, no BS, and it might for you too if those ""ifs"" are whispering (or screaming) right now.

Name the Beast: First, call it out loud. Grab a notebook (or voice memo if writing feels too much) and dump every ""what if."" Mine filled three pages: ""What if she was the one?"" ""What if I'm unlovable now?"" No editing ‚Äì just purge. Then, next to each, slap a reality check: ""She chose out ‚Äì that's her loss, not my flaw."" Sounds simple? It was the first crack in the wall. Did it for 10 mins a night; by week 3, the list shrank.

Swap the Script with Proof: Those thoughts thrive on fantasy, so starve 'em with facts. I started a ""win jar"" ‚Äì scraps of paper with real stuff: ""Crushed that work project solo,"" ""Laughed hard at that dumb comedy special,"" ""Walked 5 miles without the ache."" Pull one out when the spiral hits. Pro tip: Add one daily, even tiny (brushed teeth? Counts). Turned my brain from critic to cheerleader over time.

Body Over Brain: Mind's a liar post-breakup, so boss it with sweat. I wasn't gym-rat material, but daily 20-min walks (podcast on, no phone doom-scroll) rewired the wiring. Science backs it ‚Äì endorphins kick dopamine's ass for mood lifts. Bonus: Fresh air makes ""what ifs"" feel smaller, like problems for yesterday's you.

Borrow Eyes: Solo healing's tough; I looped in a therapist (online, low-key start) who called my ""ifs"" grief in disguise. Not magic, but hearing ""This is normal, and temporary"" from a pro? Gold. If therapy's not your jam yet, hit up a trusted buddy ‚Äì ""Hey, mind if I bounce this loop off you?"" ‚Äì turns echo chamber into echo of support.

Flash forward 7 months: She did ping me once (rebound blues, go figure), but the ""what if"" didn't own me anymore. I wished her well and kept walking ‚Äì toward hikes with my dog, random coffee chats that spark joy, and yeah, feeling like the prize, not the consolation.

That trap? It's sneaky, but breakable. You're not stuck in hypotheticals; you're mid-plot twist to a better story. What's one ""what if"" that's got you tonight, and what's your first swing back at it? Drop it below ‚Äì sharing lightens the load for all of us.

TL;DR: 54M shares how ""what if"" thoughts after 8-year breakup nearly broke him, but journaling realities, win-tracking, walks, and therapy flipped the script. You're not defined by the ifs ‚Äì break free. Your story?

Grateful for this sub ‚Äì one less spiral at a time.

P.S. If these stories hit home and you're craving more no-fluff tools for ditching the breakup brain fog, I've started spilling deeper dives on Medium. Real-talk pieces on rebuilding that magnetic vibe you lost sight of ‚Äì think attraction signals that pull the right energy your way, not the ghosts.

 Swing by and grab a read; one's already up that might just click for where you're at: https://medium.com/@theattractionsignal

Worth the click if you're ready to level up ‚Äì your future self will thank you.

But what if your winter wear could do more than just keep you warm? That‚Äôs where custom beanies step in‚Äîblending comfort with character, style with self-expression. Whether you're trekking through snowy trails or grabbing coffee downtown, a custom beanie is a quiet nod to your individuality.

First off, let‚Äôs talk style. Mass-produced winter hats? They‚Äôre fine. But they rarely speak to who you are. Custom beanies, on the other hand, let you showcase your personality in ways big and small. You can choose colors that reflect your vibe, add quirky or meaningful designs, and even throw in a personal message or logo. It‚Äôs more than a hat‚Äîit‚Äôs a conversation starter.

Then there‚Äôs comfort. With custom options, you're not stuck with scratchy fabrics or awkward fits. You can choose the material that works best for your climate and your comfort level‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs a chunky knit for serious warmth or a lighter ribbed style for crisp fall days. Plus, they‚Äôre made to fit *you*, not the average head. That means no more slipping, squeezing, or readjusting every five minutes.

Functionality also gets a major upgrade. Custom beanies can be designed with lifestyle in mind. Need extra insulation for skiing? Done. Prefer a fold-over cuff for a more secure fit? Easy. Want something breathable for running errands or hitting the gym? You‚Äôve got it. When you‚Äôre the one calling the shots, you get exactly what you need‚Äîand nothing you don‚Äôt.

And let‚Äôs not forget the emotional impact. A beanie designed by you or gifted to someone else feels personal and thoughtful. It tells a story‚Äîof your creativity, your memories, or the people you care about. That kind of value can‚Äôt be bought off a shelf.

**Custom beanies** don‚Äôt just keep your head warm‚Äîthey warm hearts, too. They‚Äôre a symbol of uniqueness in a season often blanketed in sameness. In a world full of fast fashion and fleeting trends, they give you the chance to slow down, choose quality, and wear something that‚Äôs unmistakably *you*. So this winter, don‚Äôt just blend in with the crowd. Stitch your identity into something that travels with you‚Äîwherever the cold takes you.",1,1761618019.0,u_theonlineforyou,0,1.0,False

Do you think they were violating labor/ health and safety laws?

Last week I saw two live rats when working the closing shift alone and reported it to my bosses. They told me that they would call pest control to fix the issue. However, my coworkers and I continued to smell rat and find a few dead rats over the next couple of days. 

Today, I was working the closing shift again and the smell was worse than ever. The stench was coming from under the espresso bar, behind the fridges that are bolted to the ground. So all shift I was pushing through nausea while working, making coffees while breathing in rotting rat air. After a few hours the smell was getting to be too much so I went outside to get fresh air for a few minutes. I was light headed and at risk of vomiting on a customer. When I came back inside and walked behind the counter I saw a huge rat out in the open. The rat was so big it had its foot stuck in a glue trap and was just towing the thing behind it with no problem. I jumped in fear and the rat ran back behind the fridge to safety. 

I called the district manager and told him I needed help and that the conditions were making me uncomfortable to work. He told me he would come to my location to help. I continued to serve customers, stomping my feet with everything I did as to keep the rat from coming back out. After a hour, he showed up and this point I was shaking from anxiety and actively fighting the urge to puke. I asked if I could leave and he said no. I had tears in my eyes as I told him I couldn‚Äôt work under these conditions. My asthma was getting triggered and I was out of breath just from talking to him. He said he would watch the store while I went outside for air and that they would be sending people to move the fridge ‚Äòsoon‚Äô (as in not today). He said they had nobody else to close and I could not leave. So I quit, leaving him there to deal with it. 

I actually liked working here until this point and don‚Äôt know if I am overreacting. I‚Äôm from nyc and I‚Äôm used to rats out in the city, but having them run by my feet while I serve food and beverages was just disgusting and scary. ",6,1761617948.0,AskNYC,8,0.71,False
1ohxrqm,https://www.reddit.com/r/OdysseyBookClub/comments/1ohxrqm/your_life_changed_when_you_relied_less_on/,"Your life changed when you relied less on motivation, and more on discipline: the real glow-up no one talks about","Let‚Äôs be honest. Most of us aren‚Äôt lazy, we‚Äôre just tired of chasing that elusive thing called ‚Äúmotivation.‚Äù You know, waiting around till you magically feel like going to the gym, writing that paper, fixing your resume, or cleaning your disaster of an apartment. And if your algorithm looks anything like mine, TikTok and IG are flooded with influencers yelling ‚ÄúJust manifest it!‚Äù or ‚ÄúIf you wanted it bad enough, you‚Äôd do it.‚Äù  

That‚Äôs not just wrong. It‚Äôs dangerous.  

As someone who studied psychology and behavioral science at Harvard, I can confidently say this: motivation is a mood. Discipline is a system.  

We‚Äôve been set up to believe that change and improvement require feeling inspired first. But the science says otherwise. In fact, the most successful people build their lives around systems, habits, and consistency, not fleeting emotion.  

Here‚Äôs the no BS guide that helped me and many others break the toxic motivation loop, and it‚Äôs all backed by real research, not just some dude in a hoodie screaming at his phone.

---

**Useful mindset shifts to break up with motivation addiction:**

- **Action creates emotion, not the other way around.** Behavioral scientist Dr. BJ Fogg found in his Stanford research that ‚Äútiny habits‚Äù lead to long-term transformation. Waiting to feel inspired before taking action is backwards. Start small, then momentum builds motivation.

- **Discipline is a muscle, not a personality trait.** Neuroscientist Dr. Andrew Huberman (Stanford) explains on his podcast that willpower is trainable. Cold exposure, delayed gratification, and specific routines literally rewire the prefrontal cortex, your brain's control center.

- **You don‚Äôt need to feel like it. You just need to do it.** That‚Äôs not toxic hustle culture. That‚Äôs how habits get automated. According to James Clear‚Äôs bestseller *Atomic Habits*, the key to long-term behavior change is identity-based habits. You act like the person you want to become, before you feel like them.

---

**Actual tools that make discipline easier (not harder):**

- **Use implementation intentions.** Instead of ""I‚Äôll work out tomorrow,"" say: ""After I drink my morning coffee at 8am, I‚Äôll do 20 minutes of bodyweight exercises."" This hack from Dr. Peter Gollwitzer‚Äôs psychology research boosts follow-through by up to 91%.

- **Habit stacking.** Pair a new habit with an existing one. Example: right after brushing teeth, do 2 minutes of journaling. It‚Äôs from *Atomic Habits* and helps anchor your routines.

- **Track streaks, not time.** Apps like Streaks, Finch, or even a calendar with red Xs (like Jerry Seinfeld used) reinforce consistency. You want to make breaking the streak feel harder than sticking to it.

- **Design friction.** Put your phone in another room before bed. Lay out gym clothes the night before. Environment > willpower. Behavioral economist Dan Ariely found that most decision-making is shaped by context, not intention.

**Best books that made me rethink everything about motivation and discipline:**

- **""The War of Art"" by Steven Pressfield**  
  This cult classic is short, punchy, and brutal. It slaps down every excuse you‚Äôve ever had. Pressfield calls procrastination ‚ÄúResistance‚Äù and treats it like a living enemy. It‚Äôs the best book I‚Äôve ever read on creative discipline. You‚Äôll finish it ready to destroy your inner laziness.

- **""Deep Work"" by Cal Newport**  
  A Wall Street Journal bestseller by a Georgetown professor. This book changed how I think about attention. Newport argues that focus is a rare and valuable skill most people have lost. He backs it with research and gives a full system for getting into flow. If you‚Äôve ever felt foggy, distracted, or like your brain is fried, this is your reset button.

- **""Can‚Äôt Hurt Me"" by David Goggins**  
  Not your typical self-help read. Goggins is a former Navy SEAL who went from obese to elite athlete. He‚Äôs extreme, but the message is real: discipline builds a bulletproof mind. This book will make you uncomfortable in the best way possible. You‚Äôll walk away feeling like you‚Äôve been lied to about your limits.

---

**Free and low-lift apps that help you build discipline (and actually stick to it):**

- **BeFreed**  
  This one‚Äôs next level. It‚Äôs an AI-powered learning app built by a team from Columbia University. It takes books, podcasts, expert research, and real-world success stories and turns them into a podcast-style learning plan based on your interests. It‚Äôs perfect for people working on self-discipline, habit building, or mental strength. You even get to pick your host‚Äôs voice and mood, I picked a dry, sarcastic one that feels like a no-nonsense coach. It adapts to what you listen to and builds a learning plan over time. It also covers all the books I mentioned above in its massive audio library. Great if you want science-backed knowledge without doomscrolling for hours.

- **Insight Timer**  
  Guided meditations, focus music, and time tracking. It‚Äôs not just woo-woo stuff. They have meditations specifically for building consistency and reducing procrastination. Also great for winding down without screen time.

- **Finch**  
  This is for people who need a cute dopamine hit. It gamifies self-care with a digital pet that grows as you check off goals and routines. Surprisingly effective if you‚Äôre motivated by visuals and small wins.

---

**Podcasts and YouTubes that go way deeper than ‚Äújust hustle harder‚Äù:**

- **The Huberman Lab Podcast**  
  Dr. Andrew Huberman shares neuroscience-backed tips for increasing motivation, managing dopamine, and rewiring habits. It‚Äôs long-form but worth it. His deep dive on discipline and goal setting is a must-listen.

- **Matt D‚ÄôAvella on YouTube**  
  Minimalist filmmaker who explores discipline, habit change, and lifestyle design. It‚Äôs aesthetically soothing and packed with practical advice. Not preachy. Just honest.

- **The Tim Ferriss Show**  
  He interviews top performers from all industries and always drills into routines, systems, and discipline. Tons of gold here.

---

Discipline isn‚Äôt about being strict or joyless. It‚Äôs about doing what matters, especially when you don‚Äôt feel like it. You don‚Äôt need to wait for a wave of motivation to hit. You just need tools, habits, and systems that make doing the hard things easier.

Motivation is a spark. Discipline is the engine.

For the past couple years I have been running a side gig mostly dealing with remnants I have been getting from another business.

I also do some full slab gigs and previously had another partnership where I could bring full slabs for usage of there bridge saw to complete.

Idea two would be finalize the deals and try to ‚Äúsell them‚Äù to another fabricator a few towns over but feel like that would be a crummy way to do it.

1ohxoxm,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/1ohxoxm/dental_assistant_scared_me/,Dental assistant scared me,"Sorry if this is too much info!!! But all of this contributes to why I am now terrified to go to the dentist. 
I never understood people who were scared of dentists when I was younger. That‚Äôs probably good because I ended up having to go to the dentist a lot growing up. I was told it was probably bad genetics. Despite brushing twice a day and flossing I have had multiple root canals, a cracked molar and what feels like fillings on every tooth. 
I go to the dentist regularly because of this. I go every 6 months for my cleaning but always end up having to get a filling. 
I went to get my permanent crown fitting for a back molar about a year ago. My dental assistant did the drilling of the temporary. There was trouble having it line up with my bite. I grind my teeth so and was told there was not much teeth left to work with, my dentist specifically told me I should be very careful because there is a big chance it could pop off. 
Anyways the assistant took a while (to no fault of her own) and when her hands weren‚Äôt drilling inside of my mouth I was asking her about school, we were both in college and talked about it regularly. I asked her when she was going to be a dentist, I guess I wrongly assumed what she was in school for because she said ‚ÄúMe, absolutely not I could never be a dentist it‚Äôs just not ethical‚Äù. 
Idk if I was shocked or just felt awkward but I didn‚Äôt ask her why she said that. It was already kind of tense because of how frustrated she was over my crown being to big, and I just wanted to get out of there at that point. 
When I got home I felt weird about it. I guess it triggered something in me. My partner thought it was weird as well, but he has beef with my dentist. One time I got 5 cavities filled in one day, it took hours as my dentist saw patients in between doing them. When I got home my mouth was sore and so was my body from just being in the chair for so long. My partner said this was messed up but I didn‚Äôt think so, she suggested knocking them out in one day or coming back in a couple days, I didn‚Äôt want to take another day off work. 
When I went back to get my permanent filling my dentist saw 2 new cavities. She said they were small but we could get them done. Idk why but I felt weird about it. I think I‚Äôm just exhausted from getting so many cavities filled despite doing everything I can. I literally have floss and a tooth brush in my purse in case I drink coffee or eat something. 
It doesn‚Äôt help that my algorithm is pushing ‚Äúdentist that accept Medicade bill unnecessary cavity fillings‚Äù narrative that I used to think was dumb.
Now I‚Äôm looking back at all my dental work, and (I‚Äôm serious even my front teeth have multiple fillings), and wondering if the dentist I have gone to for years, and gotten really close with is looking at me like a vending machine. 
Don‚Äôt get me wrong I am fully covered my medicade thankfully, which is why I always go, but it is still taxing to get so much dental work done.
So sorry for the novel but this is essentially why I am scared to go back. I have been ignoring their calls and avoiding it. I‚Äôm also scared that my teeth are rotting and I‚Äôm not doing anything.
Is this crazy are there really dentists who will unnecessarily fill cavities, or is it possible that I will just be getting cavities filled every 6 months for the rest of my life.",0,1761617698.0,askdentists,4,0.5,False

Went  during lunch time and opted to get the Papi Skillet instead. Also got a ""side"" of biscuits & gravy. Friend had something delicious but don't remember which item it was.  Oh well.


**Papi Skillet**. When I see chicken tinga on the menu, I almost always order it even though I generally don't order chicken based dishes when dining out.  While not quite the tinga I was expecting (very faint with the chipotle) the overall flavor combo of ingredients (I skipped the sour cream), and seasoning of the dish was quite perfectly delicious. A very generous portion for under $20.


**Biscuits and Gravy**. This is another item that I ""have"" to order if I see it on the menu. Don't know why I'm obsessed with trying them all since most of the time it's not very good or just not memorable. And today, I was rewarded for my diligence. This is in their ""appetizer "" section.  I asked if I could have it as a ""side"" instead with just one biscuit and some gravy and the chef obliged. Most restaurants that serve this as a main almost always let me order as a side when I ask. The biscuit is made with chopped bacon in it.  It was very tasty, perfectly seasoned. They accounted for the bacon really well.  Not the typical crumbly biscuit. More moist. But the star of this dish is 10000000% the gravy.  Like the biscuit, not traditional in that it's not a gloopy, thick gravy.  It's more of a thick soup - sticks to the spoon but pourable. I was told they don't add flour so inadvertently, the gravy is gluten free.  So if you are gluten free you can eat the gravy. It would taste amazing on rice, eggs,  roasted vegetables,  etc. The head chef/owner makes the biscuit and his brother makes the gravy.  They need to bottle this gravy.  It was so delicious. 


Their coffee was really well brewed that I could drink it black.  Very smooth.  


Definitely going back to try the chorizo avocado toast the guy next to us was eating.  It looked amazing.  And obviously going back for a full order of biscuits and gravy.  Worth the commitment.  ü§§


New to me info I learned from the owner/chef: They've been open for three years.  He used to be a chef at Marmalade in Wicker Park. They closed due to the pandemic.

1ohxb7v,https://i.redd.it/yh59jrulerxf1.jpeg,"Review #1: Rare Character PLT, 10y 7m","I have never posted here before, but I have yet to find a review of a RC PLT barrel online, so I figured I had to put in my due diligence. Honestly, I can‚Äôt really find ANYTHING about PLT online. 

PLT is allegedly Bookers juice. I cannot confirm nor deny this fact. It isn‚Äôt necessarily ‚Äúnew‚Äù, to my understanding, but seems to be a less common (or less offered?) selection. On their page, rare character notes that PLT Stan‚Äôs for Platinum, and that these were especially good barrels, or something of the sort. Let‚Äôs see if that‚Äôs the case.

Mash: 78/15/9

Age: 10y7m

Proof: 131.52

MSRP: $129.99

NCF?: No

Fresh crack?: Yes

Nose: Light coffee bean. Very light. Almost no ethanol. Maybe some oak as well. Slight baking spice if you take a whiff.

Front: Surprisingly mild for a 131. Initial dark chocolate that transitions somewhat into a dried oak toward the end. 

Middle/Finish: Stays dry. Coates the mouth like that semi-sweet chocolate your mom would buy to make ‚Äúhealthier‚Äù chocolate chip cookies. Or some people like them that way. Who knows. Finish is long and powerful. Follows through on the big flavor promises.

Overall: Is this Beam? Probably? It‚Äôs more reminiscent of the older bookers than anything new they‚Äôve put out. But the juice isn‚Äôt old enough to support that. I‚Äôll leave that up to you.

Is it good? Phenomenal. With all the NDP bottles dropping weekly, this selection rises above the 3-7y MGP bourbon. It IS better. And at the same cost as other RC store picks, I would definitely wait for something like this. After all, their brook hill bottles only carry 11-12 year statements on average.

Is it worth it? I‚Äôm not sure. It‚Äôs not the store‚Äôs fault rare character is charging insane prices for their barrels. And me want to support store. But I can‚Äôt keep buying $100+ bottles. $100 used to be a figuratively nice bottle, something you might save. Now it‚Äôs EVERY store pick. Anything beyond the standard minimum age juice is considered ‚Äúquality‚Äù when there‚Äôs a constant production of non-quality whiskey. Not every pick is a banger. While this one is, I‚Äôm hard pressed to support RC‚Äôs ability to charge this much for an 11 year bottle going forward.

My score is noninclusve of my person opinion towards RC.

Score: 7.5

My husband (40M) and I (35F) are in couples therapy. For a lot of reasons but the catalyst was definitely last Mother‚Äôs Day. It‚Äôs in my post history but tl;dr the night before, we got in an argument and he was still mad at me the next morning so he woke up late, poured coffee, and sat outside without saying one word to me. He ignored me for most of the day, including in front of my family visiting. At the end of the night, he half heartedly said he hoped my day was fun (after it very obviously was not). It was not his first time doing that in an argument and the second in front of my family. 

We have talked that into the ground and he has recognized he has been cruel at times to me. We are in couples therapy and he is in his own therapy around intimacy and I hope emotions. He is doing everything right and genuinely wants to change. I think, at least. It‚Äôs hard to tell when we‚Äôre still in couples therapy and accountable to the couples therapy. 

The thing is despite all his progress, I cannot forget Mother‚Äôs Day. Today I found myself crying at the memory even though it has long passed. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôll stomach any future mother‚Äôs days thinking about this past one. 

On the flip side, it would be wonderful to watch the man I fell in love with grow past what got us into couples therapy.

We‚Äôve technically known each other since kindergarten, however my first actual interactions with him were in 9th grade (currently we‚Äôre in the 11th) . Importantly at this time I came out to that group. We would eat lunch together along with 2 of our mutual friends, we all weren‚Äôt that close but we also didn‚Äôt really know anyone else. Anyways flash forward to 10th grade (for some context). My friend 16F who we‚Äôll be calling Alice asks me about him in our Math class because she developed a crush on him and imma be so for real I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs more than just an acquaintance with anyone at this time so I was her best bet. So anyways I tell her to try to become friends with him first, and from there I give her more advice on her crush and she gives me updates for most of the year.



Now here‚Äôs where the plot thickens: Francis is gay, as I am. Now that doesn‚Äôt mean I fall head over heels but I have a terrible thing where I will always develop a crush on brown haired stoners. Now finally to the present day, I have gym as a trimester 1 elective with him. At this point I do not have a crush on him, however I do feel a kinship with him as he‚Äôs one of the only gay boys I‚Äôm interested to get to know. (I already have a rapport with him and all my friends are either straight, lesbian, or bi). We became acquainted again and also importantly he comes out to me during this time in a casual manner, I should also mention we hang out with one other straight boy in gym. I did develop an off and on crush after he joked about marrying me and leaving for Germany. Now, even from the beginning of the elective I had set out with the goal of becoming friends with him. The issue is the elective is only 1 trimester so I do have a time limit before I no longer see it as a valuable thing to pursue as it‚Äôll be too difficult.



So things are business as usual and the monthly small pot luck I host with some of my friends is approaching. I invited him and figured he‚Äôd likely not be a good cook so made two dishes, however the day of he cancels citing wisdom teeth pain (he didn‚Äôt get them removed they were just hurting). He then misses 2 days of school so I buy his reason, and don‚Äôt see him as a flake though my crush mostly fades here and would take a while to come back. Now Francis suffice to say isn‚Äôt the smartest in the bunch, he‚Äôd probably be a lot smarter (if he wasn‚Äôt constantly high to get through the day but I‚Äôm getting ahead of myself). However, I am pretty good at teaching. I'm a tutor after all and offer to help him while I stay after Wednesdays with one of my friends to get work done (though we rarely actually do work). He says he should do that and I tell him to tell me the day of if he was or not. Day of comes radio silence though to be fair he didn‚Äôt come to school that day, so I tell him I stay after every Wednesday if he ever needs help.¬†



This is honestly the best place I can think to put this though not really chronological, the first time I saw him while he wasn‚Äôt high he reminded me of myself in like 6th grade. He seemed deeply depressed which made my savior complex come up, though it mostly just makes me feel bad about not being able to fix his problems. Also, as I touched on earlier he is addicted to weed like actually addicted the first time i saw him without being high he just seemed so defeated. Our mutual friend Alice helps me with my feelings towards him, I asked her how he even gets his weed seeing as he has no job she said it was from his dad. I asked him how he even started using weed and he said he started in the 7th grade and that the last time he went more than an extended period without being high (which I specified as 2 weeks) was probably in 9th grade. I also asked him how he got his weed, and he avoided the question but when I mentioned how he didn‚Äôt have a job he said he dealt weed at concerts. And I know from one of my friends that he also sells shrooms.



Back to me inviting him to events, now it‚Äôs October. I started making peanut butter cookies especially for him (I usually bake one thing a week to bring in for my friends but I started making that + the cookies I tried making him other things but he hates everything I like coffee, chocolate, pumpkin spice, ect. However he loves peanut butter above all). I also invite him to the next monthly pot luck, he insists multiple times he will come. The day of arrives I send him a reminder text (he doesn‚Äôt usually check his phone except for the beginning of school days) but he just no shows no message no nothing. Then Monday during lunch he comes up to me. I was hoping to apologize as I had made a promise to myself that unless he gave me an apology without me asking and had a good reason I would stop pursuing a friendship with him. However he opens his mouth and asks ‚ÄúHey, you got any food for me.‚Äù This absolute bum forgot and worse thing is I know it was a genuine mistake, but the thing is he put so little consideration to me that he didn‚Äôt even remember when I asked if he realized what yesterday was and what he missed. He then proceeded to not apologize just say he forgot and kinda just stood around.¬†



Then I had told him the week before that I was gonna make monkey bread next week as he said he liked caramel and was okay with cinnamon rolls. This inconsiderate imbecile comes up to me the next day and the day after that to ask me for some/ when was I gonna make it. Finally one of the friends I eat lunch with blesses their heart grills him for it calling him a bum and that I had put so much consideration into the potluck only for him to no-show, which stopped him from coming up to me at lunch at least for now. The thing is I kinda don‚Äôt like him as a person at this point, but I still feel drawn towards him. I find him incredibly attractive, but I‚Äôm quite certain that‚Äôs not it. I want to still give him another chance, my friends are all unanimously against the notion. But even if I was to give him another chance, what would I even do? I think it‚Äôd be odd to invite him to the next potluck after all that, and I don‚Äôt want to do a 1 on 1 invite in case he doesn't show and I‚Äôm on my own.

He‚Äôs confident, a little old-school masculine. He‚Äôs intelligent, has an amazing sense of humor and very motivating and supportive with every I have going on. Chemistry was amazing. 

We‚Äôd go on very long dates. Every date we‚Äôd spend hours together. Every date ended with us making out for like an hour (we never had sex though). He‚Äôs building a business, so I‚Äôve been really intentional about giving him space and not pushing for labels. For some of our dates we would meet at coffee shops or lounges, and work side by side. The chemistry and emotional intimacy felt strong. 

I did notice some red flags but I chalked it up to us having different backgrounds. Some of the red flags were him not inviting me to his house the whole time we were dating, us never talking about ‚Äúnext steps‚Äù together (we would of course talk about our own individual goals), and he would be unavailable during the day sometimes. But I thought that he‚Äôs just busy. 

Here‚Äôs where things fell apart:

He was recently traveling for work. We talked the night before he left and talked about planning something for when he gets back. While he was traveling, I would check up on him every couple of days. It would just be short check in conversations. 

A few nights ago, I sent him a voice note saying I wanted to take things to the next level. He didn‚Äôt open it for a couple days, then just responded with a generic ‚Äúhey how are you‚Äù text and completely ignoring what I‚Äôd said.

I sat with that for a bit, but it really hurt. So last night I sent this:

‚ÄúI opened up to you and you didn‚Äôt acknowledge it. It makes me feel like you don‚Äôt care about it.‚Äù

He still hasn‚Äôt even *opened* the message. It‚Äôs been over 24 hours. 

I keep spiraling between ‚ÄúI was too vulnerable‚Äù and ‚Äúwhy would he say all those things about the future and act so affectionate if he was just going to disappear when it got real?‚Äù Part of me feels like I‚Äôm being dramatic, but another part feels like‚Ä¶ if someone cares, don‚Äôt they at least *respond*?

I‚Äôm not planning to double-text or chase. But I can‚Äôt shake this feeling that I scared him off by asking for more, or that maybe I was just convenient until I wanted something deeper.

Was my message too much? Or is his silence telling me everything I need to know? Or should I give him more time since he is still traveling? I need some thoughts. ",1,1761615795.0,Advice,7,1.0,False

I‚Äôd tried everything: brushing twice a day, flossing like a maniac, even those ‚Äúmiracle‚Äù mouthwashes, but nothing works. These methods merely temporarily masked the bad taste. Before long, the taste returned again. Then my dentist recommended a water flosser.

I want a device that is fully functional and has a reasonable price. So I went with the h2ofloss one, and honestly? It‚Äôs been a total win. The best part? It came with these little Breath Freshening tablets you pop in the water tank. After using it every night for two weeks, I noticed a huge difference! No more mid conversation panic about my breath, and even my morning breath is way milder. Turns out all the food bits stuck between my teeth (that floss missed!) were the main culprit, and the water flosser blasts them right out.

But here‚Äôs the thing: I want to make this improvement permanent. I still catch a faint odor sometimes, especially after eating garlic or coffee. So I‚Äôm turning to this community, what else works for you? Do you swear by a specific toothpaste? A tongue scraper (I‚Äôve heard mixed things!)? Or maybe dietary tweaks?

Here‚Äôs my conundrum:
The golden ratio (1:16) gives me great flavor ‚Äî but wow, that‚Äôs a lot of coffee. My wife and I usually have about two cups each (roughly 1L of water total, up to line 8 on the Moccamaster), and that ends up being around 62g of beans. It feels like I‚Äôm burning through bags way too fast.

To stretch things out, I started using about half that (around 35g) but grinding much finer ‚Äî around 4.5‚Äì4.75 on the Fellow Opus. The crazy part? It actually tasted really good. Balanced, full-bodied, not bitter.

But then I saw most people recommending 5‚Äì6 for the Moccamaster, so I tried that this morning ‚Äî and it was basically weak tea. No body, no flavor.

The weird part is that at 3.75‚Äì4 I get solid espresso shots on my Bambino Plus, so it just feels wrong that my Moccamaster sweet spot is flirting with espresso territory.

I get that the Moccamaster brews super fast, so a finer grind helps with extraction‚Ä¶ but man, it just feels off grinding that fine for drip.

Anyone else run into this? Is the 1:16 ratio just too heavy for most people, or am I overthinking it and should just stick to the golden ratio with a 5‚Äì6 grind? Anyone with the same setup (Moccamaster + Fellow Opus) having similar results?

Or am I just way too addicted to coffee at this point?

1ohwy7x,https://www.reddit.com/r/startup/comments/1ohwy7x/i_had_no_idea_what_i_was_doing_now_the_platform/,I had no idea what I was doing. Now the platform makes me real money.,"Late last year, I was sitting in a coffee shop somewhere in Brooklyn, staring at my screen, genuinely questioning what the hell I was doing with my life.


I had spent months building ""SaaS ideas"" that went nowhere. I'd launch, push a few tweets, get 10 signups, and then watch everything flatline. I kept telling myself maybe I'm just not cut out for this. Everyone else seemed to ""get it"" except me.


I almost quit. Like actually quit.


But I couldn't shake the feeling that I was close to something. Not in terms of the idea, but in terms of finally understanding how to build something people actually want.


So I tried again.


This time, I built the most unsexy thing I could think of: a tool to validate ideas before wasting months coding them. No VC buzzwords. Just solving the exact pain I had in my own failed launches.


I worked on it daily, not in huge heroic sprints, just small improvements, every day. Fixing onboarding. Tweaking landing pages. Improving data sources. Answering emails. Making the output 5% better each week.


For a long time, nothing happened.


Then slowly:


Solo devs started using it to validate before building


Indie founders started using it for market research


My inbox stopped being quiet


Fast forward to today:


The platform just passed thousands of users


I don't have investors, employees, or a cofounder


It's just me, my laptop, and a ridiculous amount of iteration


It still doesn't feel ""real.""


Especially because for so long it felt like I was failing in silence.


The part no one tells you:


You don't need a ""big idea.""


You don't need a 12 slide deck or a growth plan.


You don't need to be loud on Twitter.


You just need:


One real problem


One real user who experiences it


The willingness to keep improving when no one is watching


The biggest lessons this time around:


Onboarding matters more than features


Charging earlier is not rude, it's clarity


Small daily iteration beats ""big launches"" every time


Most people quit right before things start compounding


If you're in the phase where it feels like nothing is working, don't assume that means it's not working.


Sometimes the difference between $0 MRR and $5K MRR is just staying in the game long enough for compounding to show up.


My platform is [BigIdeasDB](https://bigideasdb.com), but the name doesn't matter. What matters is I didn't quit this time.


Next milestone: $3K‚Äì$10K MRR.

1ohwwqr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AusPublicService/comments/1ohwwqr/struggling_to_move_roles/,Struggling to move roles,"Hi all, hoping for some perspective (and trying to keep this neutral, not a rant).

I‚Äôve been looking for a new role for almost a year. I‚Äôm an ongoing APS5 and have been applying internally within my agency and externally across other agencies. I‚Äôve also applied for APS5 contract roles and a few private sector roles. I‚Äôve had multiple interviews, good referee feedback, and ‚Äúyou interviewed well‚Äù comments ‚Äî but I haven‚Äôt had a single offer.

For context:
	‚Ä¢	~5 years experience in government
	‚Ä¢	Bachelor‚Äôs degree in technology. 
	‚Ä¢	No performance issues on appraisal
	‚Ä¢	Strong references who are actively supporting me
	‚Ä¢	Doing all the usual things (coffee catch ups, approaching different areas, putting myself on temp registers / internal mobility registers, etc.)

Every time I ask for feedback, I‚Äôm told there was nothing wrong, just ‚Äúanother candidate was a slightly better fit.‚Äù Recruiters I‚Äôve spoken to say the market is really tight, and friends in other departments have said their areas have basically reduced hiring.

I‚Äôve now been in my current role (Exec Assistant) for much longer than I ever planned, and I‚Äôm honestly not coping anymore. The environment has become pretty unhealthy and it‚Äôs affecting me to the point that I‚Äôve started to dread going in. It‚Äôs had such a big impact on my mental and physical health that I‚Äôm struggling to even bring myself into the office, and I feel like I‚Äôve fallen into a depressive spiral. I have raised this with my manager and HR, but nothing seems to be changing in a positive way.

I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm perfect, but I am genuinely trying. This whole process has started to really mess with my physical and mental health to the point I struggle to get out of bed. I‚Äôve burned through my leave and I‚Äôm now basically relying on savings just to get by.

Is this just what the APS market is like right now? Is it normal for APS5s to be stuck even when they‚Äôre actively applying and interviewing? Any practical advice on how to actually move, or areas that are still hiring?",1,1761615449.0,AusPublicService,1,1.0,False
1ohwwpx,https://i.redd.it/v0n9jiw2brxf1.jpeg,Married to His First Love‚Äôs Shadow,"Six years into her marriage to Sebastian Mendoza, the city's richest man, Gwendolyn Farrell wanted to set up a trust fund for her twin children.
After reviewing the documents, the staff member shook their head. ""I'm sorry, but this fund can only be established by parents for their children.""
Gwendolyn froze for a moment and explained, ""I have provided the birth certificates. I am the mother of both children.""
The staff member looked at her strangely. ""Ms. Farrell, now that all records are online, fake documents won't pass the review. The system confirms Sebastian as the father, but it clearly identifies the mother as Francesca Dixon‚Äînot you.
""These two children have nothing to do with you.""
Gwendolyn went rigid, her mind blank.
Francesca was her husband's first love, the woman he would never forget.
They had been estranged for years due to the deep-seated feud between the Mendoza and Dixon families.
But now, the children Gwendolyn had carried for nine months and brought into the world at the risk of her life had become her husband's and Francesca's...
How was that possible?
Gwendolyn decided to find Sebastian and get to the bottom of it.
She rushed to the Mendoza Group, using her fingerprint to access the CEO's office on the top floor.
The door was slightly ajar, allowing her to hear Sebastian talking with a friend inside.
""Seb, Fran is returning tonight. Are you sure you want to hold a welcoming party for her? Don't forget‚Äîyour families are sworn enemies.""
""I haven't forgotten."" Sebastian's deep-set eyes lowered slightly, his voice tight with pain. ""Our family rule is clear: no one marries a Dixon. I'm married, and Fran's just a friend to me.""
""A friend? When Fran broke up with you and went abroad, didn't you weep‚Äîthe first time in years‚Äîand say you'd never fall for another woman?
""Besides, you never truly considered Gwendolyn your wife! You only married her because she looks like Fran. You made her carry your and Fran's children through IVF. So even though the kids look like Fran, Gwendolyn will never suspect a thing and will pour her whole heart into them her entire life.
""To be honest, I even feel a little sorry for this stand-in. She loves you so much. She'll go crazy if she knows she's just a surrogate and a free nanny!""
Sebastian's voice was low and thick with suppressed agony. ""I can't marry Fran, and having children with her is the only way to ease that regret. As for Gwen...""
A complex look flashed across his face, but his voice gradually turned cold.
""I won't let her find out. In return, she'll be my wife for life‚Äîliving in comfort and envied by everyone.""
Outside the door, Gwendolyn was paralyzed, struck dumb by a searing pain that ripped through her chest.
Staggering down the stairs, she burst into the heavy rain, and memories surged back.
Six years ago, Gwendolyn had just graduated from college when her family tricked her into a blind date.
The man was old and fat, trying to kiss her with his stinky mouth.
Life with him would be miserable, but her parents, desperate for the 30,000 dollars he promised for her brother, drugged her and handed her over to him.
Luckily, Gwendolyn managed to escape. She stumbled into a private room, falling right into the arms of a man.
Overwhelmed by burning desire, she surrendered all control, frantically tearing at her clothes while pressing herself against the man's chest.
""Please... help me...""
The man frowned and tried to push her away, but as he saw her face, a scheming look flashed in his eyes.
""I can help you, but you'll repay me.""
He held her hand, his voice a little hoarse.
""I'm deeply in love with a woman, but I can't be with her. You look a little like her. I'll help you, and you'll be her stand-in and marry me. How does that sound?""
Gwendolyn was jolted back to reality, as if a bucket of cold water had been thrown over her.
Even though she was not from a wealthy background, she had her pride and didn't want to be anyone's stand-in.
But just as she was about to refuse, she suddenly realized that the handsome, well-dressed, and dignified man before her was Sebastian, her secret crush for seven years.
She had always thought she'd never stand a chance with this golden boy. But now, his eyes were only for her.
Gwendolyn's reason shattered instantly. She said in a trembling voice, ""Deal.""
Sebastian instantly held the back of her head and kissed her, sending a tingling sensation through her.
Even though she knew she was just a stand-in, Gwendolyn got lost in the moment‚Äîsimply because she loved Sebastian.
Soon, Sebastian gave her a grand wedding.
Throughout their six years of marriage, he had proved himself a wonderful husband, never showing interest in another woman.
She had everything‚Äîand more‚Äîthan the other wealthy wives. The most expensive item at every auction was always hers.
When she became pregnant with the twins, he‚Äîwhose hands had only ever signed contracts‚Äîpersonally prepared nutritious meals for her.
He never missed a single prenatal checkup, even if it meant turning down projects worth tens of millions, and he patiently read stories to her belly.
After the children were born, no matter how busy he was every day, he would go home to be with them.
They say love reaches everything tied to the one you love. Gwendolyn thought his devotion to the children came from his love for the kids‚Äô mother.
She assumed that over the years, he had fallen for her and no longer saw her as a stand-in.
So he did love the children's mother, and it was Francesca.
And Gwendolyn was nothing more than a stand-in, a surrogate, utterly disposable!
Gwendolyn sobbed in the downpour, but she still called the butler and asked him to pick up the children from their preschool.
She had cared for the twins meticulously for five years, and they meant everything to her.
Now that she knew the truth, she didn't know how to face them.
When Gwendolyn returned home, heartbroken and lost, she was soaked to the skin.
""Mommy is home!""
""Mommy, you are all wet. Go take a bath, or you'll get sick.""
Timothy Mendoza and Elowyn Mendoza toddled over, each holding one of her hands, and led her upstairs.
Gwendolyn's eyes welled up. ""Don't worry... Ah!""
She never expected the two children to suddenly push her hard.
She tumbled down the stairs. Blood flowed from her forehead, and the pain made her close her eyes.
""Yay! Mommy is bleeding a lot and passed out, so she won't stop us from going to Fran's party!"" Timothy said.
""Daddy, let's go. I really like Fran and want to see her right now,"" Elowyn chimed in.
Gwendolyn's blood-stained eyelashes trembled, and her heart shattered.
She forced her eyes open a little and saw Sebastian frown slightly before his face quickly became impassive again.
""Take care of her,"" he instructed the maids.
Then he took the hands of Timothy and Elowyn and left.
""I did say that between Fran and your mother, you should choose Fran unconditionally. But from now on, you should do it more gently.""
Timothy shook his head. ""No way. Mommy is just a housewife, and she's super stupid. We play tricks on her all the time. We can just make up an excuse, and she'll be fooled.""
""Yeah, don't worry about her,"" Elowyn said in her sweet voice. ""It was just a shove. If she dies, we can make Fran our mommy!""
Sebastian and the two kids walked away, never looking back.
Gwendolyn's heart was aching, and her face was covered in blood and tears, but she gave a faint smile.
This was the husband she had loved with all her heart.
These were the children she had risked her life to give birth to!
Since they never belonged to her, she didn't want them anymore.
She was done with them!
Chapter 2
After the family doctor treated Gwendolyn's injuries, she pushed open the study door, wanting to print a divorce agreement.
She would find a way to get Sebastian to sign it, and from then on, leave this life that never truly belonged to her.
The computer screen lit up, and Gwendolyn's fingers paused, her gaze fixed.
The wallpaper was a family photo.
It was taken on Timothy and Elowyn's first birthday. At the time, they were extremely attached to her, tightly hugging her with their chubby arms.
The photographer repeatedly tried to coax them to look at the camera, but even with their favorite toys, the two children would only look at her.
Their round, plump faces were tilted up, their big eyes full of love.
And Sebastian, with a gentle smile on his face, gently held her and the children.
Gwendolyn vaguely remembered that Sebastian's expression was just as gentle when he persuaded her to do in vitro fertilization.
He said, ""I want to have a son and a daughter with you, but getting pregnant twice is too tiring. I worry about you, so why not do in vitro fertilization and get it done all at once?""
She believed him. The moment she found out she was pregnant, thinking that these were Sebastian and her children, she was overjoyed and cried tears of happiness.
Even when morning sickness made her constantly nauseous and the late stages of pregnancy felt endless.
After the children were born, they had only wanted her, so she hadn't slept a full night for two whole years.
She remained full of warmth and love.
Her childhood home had been terrible, and she only wanted to give her own children the love she never received.
The two children were nurtured by her love, and the most common things they said were ""Mommy is amazing,"" and ""I love Mommy so much.""
But when Timothy and Elowyn were three, Sebastian hired a French teacher for them.
The children changed little by little.
They complained that she was just a housewife and thought she was stupid, but after each complaint, they would try to make her happy.
Gwendolyn thought the children were still young and didn't hold it against them. It wasn't until she was pushed down the stairs today that she finally understood.
The children she cherished like the apple of her eye, the children she raised day and night, looked down on her.
The heartwarming photo and the loving bond were nothing but a mirage.
Gwendolyn quickly printed the divorce agreement. Just as she was about to close the computer, she noticed the icon in the lower right corner flashing repeatedly.
Sebastian had left in a hurry and forgot to log out of his account.
It was a secondary account she had never known about.
Gwendolyn instinctively clicked on it and found that everything recorded inside was related to Francesca.
It turned out that Francesca was Timothy and Elowyn's online French teacher.
It turned out that Sebastian had been constantly feeding the children the idea that Francesca was outstanding and that she was stupid.
In the latest video, he booked the entire St. Regis New York and invited their best friends to welcome Francesca.
Timothy and Elowyn affectionately hugged Francesca.
""Fran, you're even prettier than you are in the video!""
""Yeah, Fran, you're better than Mommy in every way. I like you so much!""
Sebastian showed no intention of stopping them. His hand lingered behind Francesca's waist for a long time, and finally, as if he had made up his mind, he gently rested it there.
Gwendolyn watched the video for a long time in a self-torturing manner before she trembled and closed it.
The four of them were finally complete, leaving her as nothing more than an outsider.
In the evening, Sebastian returned with the two children.
""Mommy, I didn't push you on purpose.""
""Yeah, I didn't mean to either. Don't be mad!""
The two children looked well-behaved, thinking that by saying this, their mother would be coaxed just like usual.
But Gwendolyn just nodded coldly, not giving them a single smile.
The children were stunned, and Sebastian raised an eyebrow slightly, reaching out to stroke her face.
""Does it still hurt?""
Gwendolyn couldn't dodge in time. The moment he touched her, she remembered his hand wrapped around Francesca's waist and felt sick. She couldn't help but gag.
Seeing this, Sebastian's expression darkened.
""Are you pregnant again?
""This is the second time you've gotten pregnant by accident. We took precautions, so how can there be so many coincidences? Did you do it on purpose?""
Sebastian's tone was accusing.
""I already said that having another child will surely be distracting, and you won't be able to give all your love to Tim and Elo.""
He pulled Gwendolyn and anxiously wanted to drag her for a pregnancy test.
Gwendolyn stumbled, knocking over a vase. The vase shattered and cut her leg, which was already bruised from the fall.
She gasped in pain, but he didn't even notice.
The intense pain was like a tightening net, leaving Gwendolyn with nowhere to run, but what hurt more was her heart.
When Timothy and Elowyn were three years old, she had an accidental pregnancy.
She loved children and was overjoyed at the thought of welcoming a new life.
But Sebastian didn't want it. He said, ""You went through so much pain during your last delivery. I'm really worried about you. Listen to me, we won't have this one.""
Coupled with Timothy and Elowyn's constant tantrums and protests, she ultimately had an abortion with tears in her eyes.
At the time, Sebastian had even taken time off work to care for her, gently comforting, ""We already have a son and a daughter. Don't be sad.""
But it turned out that all the gentleness was a lie. He didn't feel bad for her. He was afraid that his children would be neglected.
In the end, he and Francesca had a son and a daughter, but she had lost her only flesh and blood!
The past was like a dull knife, slicing back and forth across Gwendolyn's heart.
And the result was already displayed on the pregnancy test stick.
Chapter 3
Gwendolyn stared at the single line on the pregnancy test stick and laughed at herself.
Now Sebastian could rest assured that she wouldn't give birth to their child.
It was a good thing, too, because now, she didn't want one either.
Sebastian sighed with relief, his tone softening. ""Gwen, I just don't want you to suffer. We already have Tim and Elo. That's enough.""
How hypocritical.
But Gwendolyn just said flatly, ""Thank you for your concern.""
Sebastian was taken aback. ""Why are you acting like a stranger?""
A stranger?
In this family, she had always been the outsider. How could she not act like a stranger?
Gwendolyn thought for a moment, then turned around and took out the divorce agreement. ""Okay, I won't be a stranger. I want to buy a commercial property.""
This was the first time she had ever asked for anything. Sebastian felt something was off. Just as he was about to take a closer look at the contract, he heard Gwendolyn's cold voice.
""Are you unwilling?""
At her words, Sebastian signed without hesitation.
He would get his wife whatever she desired.
Holding the divorce agreement, Gwendolyn felt a weight lift from her shoulders.
Outside the door, Timothy and Elowyn's whispers drifted in.
""Mommy isn't really going to have a baby, is she? She's so stupid. What if she has another stupid kid just like her?""
""Yeah, she just got lucky that she could give birth to such great kids like us. I really don't want a mommy like this. It's so annoying!""
Gwendolyn's fingers gripping the document turned white. They would get what they wanted soon.
When the divorce agreement took effect, she would no longer be their mother.
The next day, Gwendolyn didn't get up at 6:00 a.m. as usual. She left the care of the children and Sebastian to the maids.
She didn't expect everything to fall apart.
Timothy was a picky eater and had only eaten her cooking since he was little. The maids worked hard to prepare over a dozen breakfast dishes, but he didn't eat a single bite.
Elowyn was also unhappy with the pigtails the maids braided for her, but due to time constraints, she had to go to preschool in a huff.
""Mrs. Mendoza...""
Another maid came to Gwendolyn for help.
""How should I match Mr. Mendoza's new Armani suit? I've tried several times, but he's not satisfied.""
Gwendolyn pursed her lips and replied skillfully.
""Match it with the tie in the second box of the left cabinet in the third walk-in closet.
""And the dark silver cufflinks in the third drawer of the right side of the fifth walk-in closet.""
A moment later, Sebastian walked into the bedroom. He was already tall and handsome, and wearing a well-matched suit made him look even more impressive.
He leaned against the door, his eyes a little displeased. ""Why did you stop working?""
Gwendolyn didn't look at him, only saying, ""I don't feel well.""
Sebastian instantly remembered that she had had a lot of injuries yesterday, and they were all caused by him and their two children.
A flash of guilt and an unidentifiable emotion passed, and he gave in. ""Get some rest.""
After Gwendolyn ""stopped working,"" everything became a mess.
Even when the maids cooked according to the recipes she gave them, Timothy still said the taste was wrong and lost a lot of weight in just a few days.
The maids tried to braid Elowyn's hair, but Elowyn either complained that it hurt or it came undone soon after she left, making her cry.
As for Sebastian, all the daily life details he had never worried about suddenly emerged, frustrating him.
He was usually not harsh on the maids, but he got angry. ""You can't even do a small thing right!""
The maids were on edge, but Gwendolyn only found it ironic.
Small things?
Maybe to Sebastian, she was just a housewife living off his money, doing chores anyone could replace.
But she had tried so many times to get her son to eat a little more.
She had collected nearly a thousand videos on braiding hair and practiced repeatedly to make them both pretty and secure without damaging the hair.
As for Sebastian, he had always had a picky taste. She had studied design, art, and many other courses just to have a better aesthetic and be his capable assistant.
These unnoticed little things, when put together, were the measure of her boundless love.
They took it for granted but never saw it for what it was.
They never thought that, besides being a wife and a mother, she was a complete individual.
Fortunately, this life was about to end, and she could soon be herself again.
After a few days of chaos, Sebastian finally felt something was wrong.
""We need to talk.""
In the morning, he looked at Gwendolyn, his fingers lightly tapping the nightstand. ""Have you heard any rumors?""
Yes, the wealthy circle was so small, it was hard not to hear anything.
Things might've been chaotic around the house, but the outside world was a different story.
Sebastian took Francesca to various events. The expensive items that had always belonged to Mrs. Mendoza now belonged to Francesca.
She said she wasn't used to American architecture, and he immediately gave her the French estate under his name.
She said she wanted to start a business, and he immediately bought a top-tier private elementary school in the city and made her the principal.
He did so much, but he told Gwendolyn, ""Don't overthink it. Francesca and I are just friends.""
Gwendolyn found it absurd and didn't want to respond.
Sebastian frowned. ""Even if you're jealous and mad at me, the children are innocent. This will affect their quality of life. Don't you want to be a mother anymore?""
Gwendolyn pinched her palm, no longer able to suppress the anger in her eyes.
She looked straight at him. ""Fine. I won't be their mother anymore.""
Chapter 4
The air turned cold and still.
Then, Sebastian laughed. ""So you're worried about your position being threatened. I already said Francesca, and I can never be. You will always be Mrs. Mendoza and the mother of my two children.""
He thought that by being straightforward, Gwendolyn wouldn't be angry anymore.
So, he gave an order as if it were the most natural thing in the world. ""Stop making a fuss. Tim and Elo are almost five years old. Make sure you plan their birthday party properly.""
A wave of bitterness surged in Gwendolyn's heart.
Every year, she meticulously planned the children's birthday party herself. The trust fund she tried to set up a few days ago was originally intended to be their birthday gift.
It's just that she wasn't their mother, so she couldn't give them that gift.
Seeing that Gwendolyn remained silent, Sebastian assumed she agreed and said casually, ""Francesca and the children share the same birthday. It's such a rare coincidence. Prepare for her, too. It will be more lively with an extra person.""
Gwendolyn's mind went blank with a loud 'boom', and her entire body trembled with rage.
When she was pregnant with twins, her belly was especially large in the late stages of pregnancy. The doctor had already suggested a Cesarean section, but Sebastian insisted on waiting a little longer.
He said that the longer the children stayed in the womb, the better it was for them.
As soon as Gwendolyn heard that it was good for the children, she agreed without complaint.
In the last half month, she had trouble sleeping every day, and stretch marks appeared uncontrollably on her stomach.
She cared about her looks and cried in secret, but kept telling herself a mother had to stay strong.
She endured for a long time until Sebastian's scheduled Cesarean section date finally arrived.
But it turned out that all the hardship she endured was just so that the real mother and her two children could share the same birthday, making their bond even deeper.
It was absolutely ridiculous!
The day of the birthday party arrived quickly.
The party was held at the residence, so Gwendolyn had nowhere to hide and could only stand in the crowd.
Francesca was undoubtedly the center of attention.
She wore a pink diamond mermaid dress that accentuated her exquisite figure. All the jewelry she wore was a globally limited edition that Sebastian had recently bought for her at an auction.
Timothy, wearing a small tuxedo, and Elowyn, wearing a pink floral dress, entered the venue hand-in-hand with Francesca.
A guest who didn't know the situation exclaimed, ""I really envy Mrs. Mendoza. Her husband is handsome, wealthy, and devoted, and they have a son and a daughter. Look how much the children look like her.""
Someone next to her immediately tugged at her arm. ""Shh, this lady is just Mr. Mendoza's ex-girlfriend who recently returned to the country. They say they're friends, but it looks like she's his true love.""
""No wonder Mr. Mendoza married such an ordinary wife, just because she looks like his ex-girlfriend. That being said, not having given birth means she doesn't have to worry, which keeps her looking young, and her figure is great. She looks beautiful in pink.""
Gwendolyn couldn't listen anymore. She turned and went to the balcony for some fresh air, silently counting how much longer she had until she could leave.
""How dare you stay here when you know you're just a stand-in?""
Francesca suddenly appeared beside her, her tone sharp and condescending.
""I'm back this time to overcome all difficulties and be with Seb. You'll be swept out the door soon.""
She expected Gwendolyn to lose control and panic.
After all, Sebastian had said she was just a housewife who knew nothing.
To Francesca's surprise, Gwendolyn was unfazed. ""You can certainly try.""
It was always difficult to change Sebastian's decisions.
No matter how much he loved Francesca, he couldn't marry her because of the family feud and the ancestral rule.
""How dare you challenge me?"" Francesca's eyes darkened. ""Don't think your position is secure just because you gave birth to those two little brats. I'll show you right now who's more important, me or you, the stand-in!""
She quickly took off her bracelet, and with an arc, it flew off the second-floor balcony and landed in the lake below.
Francesca raised her voice and questioned angrily, ""Seb and I are just friends. Even if you don't believe me, you shouldn't have thrown my bracelet into the lake. Go and get it back for me!""
Everyone's eyes turned to them.
Sebastian quickly walked over.
He hesitated. ""Fran, she hasn't been feeling well lately. Maybe it was just an accident. The water is too cold at night to retrieve it. How about I buy you a few better bracelets?""
Francesca's voice was tinged with a sob.
""There's no better one! The one she threw was the one you gave me back then!""
Her eyes were filled with pain.
Sebastian's expression changed, too.
Gwendolyn knew why. His secondary account had mentioned it was a pink diamond bracelet.
Pink diamonds were very precious, with a single one being priceless, but he had managed to collect a whole strand for her.
Most importantly, it was the gift he gave Francesca when he confessed his love to her back then. It was their token of love.
Francesca was really going all out to frame her.
But Gwendolyn wasn't flustered. ""Ms. Dixon threw it herself. We can check the surveillance footage.""
Worried about potential trouble, she had installed a few extra security cameras beforehand, and they had indeed come in handy.
Francesca clearly hadn't expected her to be so prepared, and a look of panic flashed in her eyes.
Sebastian noticed, and suspicion began to grow in his eyes.
Just then, Timothy and Elowyn, like little cubs, shielded Francesca.
Their sweet voices were incredibly firm.
""No need to check the surveillance footage! We saw who threw it.""
""It was Mommy!""
Chapter 5
The entire banquet hall fell silent.
Gwendolyn thought she had misheard, but the two children repeated themselves, their voices firm and definite.
""Mommy was the one who threw it!""
""Yeah, I saw it clearly.""
They spoke in their childish voices, uttering the most cruel lie.
And with that, they completely extinguished the last bit of love left in Gwendolyn's heart.
She tried to defend herself. ""I didn't. You can check the security camera if you don't believe me...""
""That's enough,"" Sebastian said, cutting her off with a light reprimand.
""Tim and Elo are just children. Why would they lie? And what reason would Francesca have to use her most precious item to frame you? You made one mistake after another today and refuse to admit it. You should pay the price for what you've done.""
His voice was icy.
""Gwendolyn, go get the bracelet. You can come up when you find it.""
There was no room for negotiation once Sebastian made a decision.
The bodyguards dragged Gwendolyn downstairs and pushed her into the lake.
The bottom of the lake was full of weeds and broken rocks. Her wounds, which had just started to heal, were torn open again, making her body tremble with pain.
She didn't know how long she had been searching, but her hands were pale. She finally found the bracelet.
Sebastian immediately took it and ran toward Francesca without even a glance at her.
Gwendolyn lay on the bank of the lake with her eyes closed, looking a complete mess.
Above her, she heard the innocent voices of her children.
""Tim, Mommy looks so miserable. Don't you think we went too far?""
""No, Dad said to help Fran unconditionally. We were just listening to him.""
""You're right. Anyway, Mommy loves us a lot, so she'll be fine. Let's go find Fran...""
The voices faded into the distance, and Gwendolyn fell into darkness.
When she woke up, she was alone in a hospital.
Two nurses were cleaning her wounds and chatting with each other.
""People often say marriage is like being reborn. It's true. Look at this one, all bruised up, with a high fever, and not a soul to care for her.""
""Mrs. Mendoza is different. I heard that Mr. Mendoza rented an entire VIP floor and brought in experts from all over the country just because a beloved bracelet got wet and her eyes were a little swollen.""
""Yeah, her husband loves her, and her children are well-behaved. The kids are so young, but one peeled an orange for her and the other told her a story. It made my heart melt. Having well-behaved children is really a blessing!""
Seeing Gwendolyn open her eyes, they fell silent.
In the silence, Gwendolyn's phone vibrated.
It was a message from Sebastian.
""You'll stay here for a while and reflect on what you did.""
The difference between being loved and unloved was a cruel realization, but Gwendolyn's heart only gave a slight pang.
There was no sadness left, not even anger‚Äîjust emptiness and the faint hope of leaving soon.
On the day she was discharged, Tobias Fraser, the driver, came to pick her up.
He parked the car outside a high-end club. ""Mrs. Mendoza, Mr. Mendoza is waiting for you inside.""
Gwendolyn didn't doubt him. Over the years, she had attended all sorts of social events with him.
When she arrived at the designated private room, Gwendolyn heard a strange sound.
She thought she had made a mistake, but through the crack in the door, she saw Francesca and an unfamiliar man sitting inside.
The man unbuttoned his shirt, touching himself and making heavy breathing sounds.
Francesca, meanwhile, sat calmly next to him, casually messing up her hair and pinching her neck, making some red marks.
Gwendolyn found the scene strange and unsettling.
Her instincts told her she was in danger, and she immediately turned to leave.
But it was too late.
Chapter 6
The man in the private room reached out and dragged Gwendolyn inside.
The next second, Sebastian rushed in anxiously with the two children.
""Seb!""
Francesca burst into tears and threw herself into his arms.
""Ms. Farrell didn't believe we were just friends, so she drugged me and said she wouldn't be at ease until she saw me ruined by another man.""
She pointed to her messy hair and the red marks on her neck. ""Luckily, you arrived in time, or else I...""
""I didn't do it,"" Gwendolyn quickly said. ""Tobias brought me here, saying there was a business dinner.""
Tobias immediately walked in from outside. ""Watch what you say, Mrs. Mendoza. You were the one who asked me to drive here and said there was a good show coming up.""
The man in the private room also shouted, ""Mrs. Mendoza clearly told me she was getting me an escort. If I knew this was your woman, Mr. Mendoza, I wouldn't dare to do anything even if you killed me. Please spare my life!""
Sebastian stared at Gwendolyn, disbelief hardening into bitter disappointment.
""Even if you want to fight for my affection, you shouldn't stoop so low. You were drugged once, and now you want to use the same method to ruin Francesca's reputation. You're too vicious.""
His voice grew colder.
""Today, I will teach you a lesson. Those who harm others will eventually harm themselves.""
He looked at the man begging on his knees. ""I'll give you a chance to redeem yourself.""
Gwendolyn's heart sank drastically. ""What are you going to do? Sebastian, you can't do this to me!""
Sebastian sneered. ""I'm not as filthy as you. You want to ruin her reputation, then I'll ruin your face.""
He instructed the man, ""Slap her face hard.""
The man immediately got up and slapped Gwendolyn's face, one stinging slap after another.
After a full one hundred slaps, her face was swollen, and blood flowed from the corner of her mouth, like someone's bloody tears.
It hurt so much, but aside from her pain, everyone else in the private room was either cold or gloating.
Sebastian didn't spare her a glance, only comforting Francesca. ""Let's go to the hospital. The effects of the drug will wear off soon.""
""No!"" Francesca cried and hugged him tightly. ""I feel so unwell. I only want you.""
She kissed him recklessly.
Sebastian knew he should push her away rationally, but his body couldn't fight back.
Her tears and the warmth of her lips made him lose control.
Finally, Sebastian no longer suppressed his restraint. He picked Francesca up around the waist and carried her to the next private room, kicking the door shut.
The tightly closed door couldn't block the escalating sounds of their passion.
""Yay!"" Behind her, Timothy excitedly spoke in French. ""Fran is so amazing! We listened to her and put the drug in Daddy's coffee. They're kissing now!""
""Yeah, we'll have a smart little brother or sister soon!""
Gwendolyn stiffly turned around.
The children had become quite disrespectful to her since they started learning French, so she had also secretly started learning it.
She didn't expect that Sebastian was the one who was actually drugged.
She was even more shocked that Francesca would use such young children to achieve her goal.
Seeing her gaze fall on them, Timothy said casually, ""Mommy, don't be sad. We believe you didn't do it.""
Elowyn also said, ""Yeah, don't be mad about the bracelet thing last time. We were wrong!""
Gwendolyn suddenly found it laughable. ""I'm not angry anymore.""
It wasn't worth being angry at people who didn't matter.
Seeing that they had coaxed her again, the children proudly switched back to French.
""Mommy is really stupid. We fooled her again!""
""She loves us. She's our dog, so of course she won't stay mad at us.""
""No, no. Fran said that only men are called dogs. Women are called sluts.""
""That's right! Mommy is a slut! Fran is so much better. She taught us so much useful stuff.""
Gwendolyn didn't speak again.
French was a beautiful language, yet it sounded vile when used to hurl such words.
So this was how Francesca was teaching the children. But if she knew Timothy and Elowyn were her biological children, would she still be like this?
Chapter 7
That night, as soon as Sebastian returned, he told the maids to pack the luggage.
""What happened today is a one-time thing. I'm helping you clean up your mess."" He frowned at Gwendolyn. ""Stop being jealous and don't make trouble again.""
After a pause, he added, ""Francesca is traumatized and needs comforting. I'll stay with her for the next few days. Don't worry, I won't marry her or be alone with her. I'll bring the children with me.""
Gwendolyn found it extremely ironic.
He didn't marry her, yet he had a pair of children with her.
He wasn't going to be alone with her, but the four of them were going to enjoy a family reunion!
Fortunately, she was happy to have some peace and quiet.
The day the agreement took effect arrived quickly. Gwendolyn held the official divorce certificate, feeling like she had just woken up from a dream.
She was about to leave, but Francesca rushed in with bodyguards.
""Are you playing hard to get and running away from home?"" She sneered, looking at the luggage. ""Sluts always have so many tricks!""
Francesca's eyes gleamed with calculation, but Gwendolyn didn't want to get involved anymore and simply took out the divorce certificate.
""Please give this to Sebastian for me. Mrs. Mendoza's position is now vacant. I won't be coming back.""
Francesca opened it and looked at it repeatedly, her eyes filled with wild joy.
Then, her expression twisted as she looked up. ""I'm sorry, in my opinion, only dead people pose no threat!
""Don't worry, I will definitely become Mrs. Mendoza, and your two little brats, I will definitely ruin them!""
It turned out that Sebastian hadn't told her the truth until now.
It was laughable that Timothy and Elowyn defended her and liked her so much.
Gwendolyn was about to speak when she felt a dull impact on her head and lost consciousness.
When she regained consciousness, she found herself tied to the edge of a cliff, explosives strapped tightly around her.
Behind her was a bottomless abyss, sending shivers down her spine.
On the other side of the kidnapper was Francesca, also tied up.
Francesca was full of resentment. ""The thought of you getting the chance to have children with Seb just because you look like me makes me so angry! I want you to watch Seb and your biological children choose me. I want you to be blown to pieces so I can finally have peace of mind!""
Suddenly, her expression changed, and her eyes were filled with pity and struggle.
It turned out that Sebastian had arrived with the two children.
The kidnapper said fiercely, ""If you pay the ransom, I can let one of them go. You choose!""
The wind whipped through Gwendolyn's hair as she heard Sebastian's trembling voice. ""I want both of them. Let them go now!""
But the kidnapper smirked. ""You don't get off that easy. You can only choose one, or both of them will die!""
The two children immediately became anxious.
""Daddy, choose Fran. I only want her!"" urged Timothy.
Elowyn said, ""Mommy is unnecessary anyway. If she dies, she won't embarrass us anymore. I want Fran to be my new mommy.""
Sebastian was about to scold them when his assistant reported in his ear.
""Mr. Mendoza, we found out that this kidnapper is the younger brother of the man from the club last time.""
Sebastian was astonished, and anger flashed in his eyes.
It was Gwendolyn's doing again. She still hadn't repented.
He and Francesca hadn't crossed any lines these past few days. Did Gwendolyn really not trust him?
Sebastian felt annoyed and irritated, and he no longer hesitated. ""I choose Francesca.""
""What about the one next to her? I heard she's your wife.""
Sebastian's eyes held only indifference. ""Her fate is none of my concern.""
So the kidnapper untied the rope on Francesca and shoved her.
Sebastian opened his arms and caught her. Timothy and Elowyn also gathered around her, full of concern.
The family of four walked away.
But the explosives on Gwendolyn were still counting down. She couldn't break free and trembled. ""I'll pay double whatever Francesca is paying.""
A hint of interest flashed in the kidnapper's eyes, but he remained silent.
""I'll pay ten times the amount!""
The countdown finally stopped. Having survived the ordeal, Gwendolyn's legs gave out, and she collapsed on the edge of the cliff.
She gritted her teeth, crawled up, and retrieved all her documents.
On the computer screen, the family photo was still displayed.
But at the brink of death, Sebastian and the two children all chose Francesca.
Thinking of Francesca calling them little brats, Gwendolyn dismissed the idea of telling the truth.
She wouldn't interfere with other people's karma.
She coldly deleted the ""family photo"" and changed the desktop to a blue sky with white clouds.
As the car drove toward the airport, Gwendolyn knew‚Äî
She had survived those dark years and was finally ready to embrace an open, limitless future. ",2,1761615447.0,Contemporary_Romance,1,1.0,False

Everytime I touched myself, I closed my eyes and imagined my hands were my father‚Äôs.
""Are you okay?""
When I pinched my niples, I heard my stepfather calling me.
Then I made a bold decision.
I climbed into my father's bed.
I placed my legs against his. It was then I realized he was only wearing boxer briefs.
My father wrapped his arm around me, his fingers caressing my shoulder.
I ran my fingers across his stomach, feeling the tight muscles of his abdoman.

Chapter 1
My stepfather clicked off the television and turned to look at me. As always, when his piercing blue eyes fell on mine, I couldn‚Äôt help but shudder with excitement. John, my stepfather, smiled and spread his hands out in a helpless shrug.
‚ÄúWeatherman says it‚Äôs going to stay cruddy like this until tomorrow morning. The state has put a warning out not to go out on the roads.
Supposed to be the storm of the century. Looks like we‚Äôre hunkering down tonight. Just you and me, kiddo.‚Äù
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs okay, Daddy. I‚Äôve got some mac and cheese we can eat for dinner.‚Äù
My stepfather laughed and walked over to me. He wrapped his arms around me and squeezed me into him and I nuzzled my head into his chest, breathing in deep and enjoying his musk and the warmth of his body against mine.
He released me and held me out in front of him. I was wearing a pair of tight jean shorts and a white tank top and I noticed his eyes travel down and linger on my cleavage for a moment. I smiled sweetly up at him. He cleared his throat and met my gaze.
‚ÄúSo, honey,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúwhat do you think of your new place?‚Äù
I looked around at my new apartment, not quite believing that I was finally on my own. After eighteen years of living at home, having my own space in a new town was an odd feeling. Mostly I missed the idea of being away from my stepfather. I could tell from the way he had been acting all weekend as we settled me in that he was feeling the same thing. He had been reluctant to see me off to college, and though he hadn‚Äôt said anything about it, his voice had had a wistful quality to it since we‚Äôd left the house the day before with a trailer full of my stuff.
‚ÄúI love it, Daddy. Though I‚Äôm a little nervous to start college.‚Äù My father smiled.
‚ÄúYou are going to have such a good time, sweetie. College is one of the best times of life. Just be sure to study hard, but also make room for fun. Oh,
and be careful about the boys.‚Äù ‚ÄúDad!‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôm serious,‚Äù he said, grinning. ‚ÄúYou are going to meet a lot of them, and being the beautiful woman you are, they are going to want to do things to you. Just make sure you only do what you‚Äôre comfortable with and make sure to use protection.‚Äù
‚ÄúDaddy!‚Äù I repeated. ‚ÄúEverything is going to be okay. I‚Äôm not interested in those types of boys anyway.‚Äù
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what you say now. But I still need to warn you. Even though I‚Äôm sure you are already sexually active, it makes me feel better as a father to warn you‚Äî‚Äú
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sexually active,‚Äù I interjected.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not?‚Äù From his eagerness, I could tell that he was pleased by the news.
‚ÄúNo, Daddy,‚Äù I cooed, sidling up to him and wrapping my arms around his large frame, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm saving myself for someone special. I don‚Äôt want to just give myself away to anyone, you know?‚Äù
My father bent down and kissed the top of my head, some strands of my curly brown hair sticking to his stubble as he straightened back up and squeezed me tight.
‚ÄúGood for you, honey. I know the man that you finally give yourself is going to be very lucky. Even though I‚Äôm your father, I have no problem telling you that you are absolutely beautiful.‚Äù
‚ÄúThanks, Daddy.‚Äù
‚ÄúI love you, sweetheart.‚Äù ‚ÄúI love you, too.‚Äù
‚ÄúNow,‚Äù my father said, pushing me away from him once more. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs say we build that new coffee table of yours before the lights go out and we drown?‚Äù
Chapter 2
The storm moved in not long after. As a light rain began to whisper outside the window, my father gave one final turn of the screwdriver in his hand and dropped it onto the carpet. He sat back and looked at the coffee table in front of him. I was sitting across the room on the couch, watching with a bowl of ice cream in my hand. I enjoyed seeing the strong muscles of his arms tense as he assembled the various pieces, his face scrunched in concentration, his tongue absentmindedly sticking out of the corner of his mouth. I had always enjoyed watching him work. He had a special ability to lose himself to whatever he was doing, and being the extremely handsome man he was, the effect was intoxicating.
‚ÄúWhat do you think?‚Äù he said, wiping his hands. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice, ehh?‚Äù ‚ÄúI love it, Daddy. Thanks for putting it together.‚Äù
‚ÄúMy pleasure, sweetheart. Of course, my favorite part is having you watch me,‚Äù he said, winking.
I grinned.
‚ÄúI like seeing you work. You get so involved.‚Äù
Just then a giant peal of thunder shook the windows of the house. I jumped, causing my father to laugh.
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing to worry about, Leah,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúJust a storm.‚Äù ‚ÄúSounds like a scary storm.‚Äù
Another peal of thunder cracked the sky. The light rain roared into a downpour, the wind lashing the windows and rattling the panes.
My father stood up and walked over to the window to look out at the sky. ‚ÄúAlthough I will admit, it looks like it‚Äôs going to be one hell of a storm.‚Äù
He walked over to the couch and sat down beside me. He placed a hand on my knee, my heart fluttering at his touch.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôll just have to play some board games. What do you think, daughter of mine?‚Äù
‚ÄúAs long as you promise that we aren‚Äôt going to wash away.‚Äù
My father chuckled and patted my knee. His fingers caressed my thigh as he looked into my green eyes.
‚ÄúI promise, love.‚Äù
Even though he was only my stepfather, John was the only parent I had ever known. My real father had deserted my mother before I had been born, and my mother had run out not long after. In the interim, she had met John at
an entrepreneur convention and gotten remarried a few months later. I think she had been planning to leave all along and had been looking for someone to trick into taking care of her daughter. Being the man he was, my stepfather had had no qualms deciding to keep me and raise me singlehandedly once my mother had fled. As he had told me more than once, despite not being technically related, he had known from the moment he had seen me that I was the love of his life.
A man in his late thirties, my stepfather was quite the catch. He was tall, about 6‚Äô2‚Äù, and overwhelmingly handsome, with a penetrating gaze and an aura of confidence and kindness that inevitably made every woman he met swoon. Growing up, I had been the playmate of choice for many of the kids in class just so their mothers would have a chance to talk to John whenever he came to pick me up or drop me off. It wasn‚Äôt unusual for women to slyly hand them their phone numbers in the grocery store or to interrupt us at restaurants to flirt. And it had never failed to amaze me how my stepfather had handled each of these situations, graciously turning down the women.
Because in all the years I had been cognizant enough to notice the world around me, I couldn‚Äôt ever remember him dating. A self-made millionaire who had retired after my mother left, his sole task had been to take care of me, always giving me the best and making sure that I was happy in every way. I had asked him once or twice why he wasn‚Äôt interested in the women he met, some of them stunningly beautiful, but he had always just shrugged in that adorable way of his.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs because you‚Äôre all I need,‚Äù he would say.
Chapter 3
So it was only natural for me to grow up loving him as much as I did. And somewhere along the way, what had been a girlish attachment on my part to my father had suddenly blossomed into a romantic love for him.
Not that I ever planned on telling him that. I was smart enough to know that most people would consider my feelings for my stepfather to be wrong. Though I didn‚Äôt think my stepfather would be one of those people, I still didn‚Äôt want to chance it. Still, in some corner of my heart I had been holding out the hope that he felt the same way about me, and this was why I had never been interested in any of the boys in my classes, and why, when all the other girls were talking about blowjobs and sex and getting fingered for the first time, I had shied away and not participated in their discussions. Truth be told, I was saving myself, my virginity, for the man I wasn‚Äôt sure would ever take it.
‚ÄúLeah? Leah!‚Äù My father‚Äôs sharp voice broke through my thoughts, snapping me back to the present. Another roll of thunder shook the windows. I turned to look at my father. My hand went down to his on my bared knee, and I smiled.
‚ÄúSorry, Daddy,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWas lost in thought.‚Äù ‚ÄúI can tell. You doing okay?‚Äù
I sighed and laid my head against his shoulder. My father leaned his head down against mine and our fingers interlocked.
‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm doing okay, Daddy. Just feeling overwhelmed with this whole growing up thing.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou and me both,‚Äù he said, his wistful voice lost to the thunder.
BOOM!
A giant seemed to stomp on the roof of the apartment building and the lights flickered and went out. Suddenly, it was eerily quiet, even the background noises of little electronics whirring in their boxes extinguished.
‚ÄúWell, I guess that‚Äôs that,‚Äù my stepfather said, tossing his cards onto the new coffee table. ‚ÄúHow are you feeling? Do you want to keep playing? We can get the flashlights and hold them between our teeth.‚Äù
I yawned.
‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôm pretty tired, Daddy. It‚Äôs been a long day. Maybe we should just go to bed.‚Äù
Alright. Let‚Äôs do it, baby.‚Äù
I felt a hand touch my leg in the dark and I reached down and grabbed it. ‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù my stepfather said, pushing himself up from the couch and
pulling me up to my feet. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go brush our teeth.‚Äù
After we had gotten ready for bed, using our phones in the dark to navigate our way to the bathroom, we returned to the living room, standing close to one another in the dark.
‚ÄúOkay, Daddy. I‚Äôll take the couch and you can have my bed.‚Äù ‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù
‚ÄúYes, silly. You‚Äôre too tall for the couch.‚Äù
‚ÄúWell, thank you. Are you going to be okay out here?‚Äù ‚ÄúI think so.‚Äù
‚ÄúWell, just wake me up if you need anything.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay. I love you.‚Äù
‚ÄúI love you, too. Goodnight.‚Äù
I heard my father move across the room, his footsteps disappearing into my bedroom. Sighing, I unbuttoned my pants and slipped them off. It was too dark and I was too tired to rummage through one of my packed boxes for a pair of pajamas. I would just have to sleep in my underwear. I reached behind my back and unsnapped my bra. I pulled the straps over my arms one at a time and then pulled out my bra from the top of my tank top. In the darkness, I ran my hands up under my shirt, feeling my smooth, flat belly. I gently stroked the underside of my breasts. Cupping them, I began to massage them slowly. This was a game I liked to play; As I touched myself, I closed my eyes and imagined my hands were my father‚Äôs. I bit my lip and pinched my
nipples with my thumbs and forefingers and rolled them back and forth. ‚ÄúAre you okay out there?‚Äù my father called from the bedroom
I froze, my erect nipples between my fingers. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm good,‚Äù I called back.
Chapter 4
‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need any more blankets?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, I should be good.‚Äù
‚ÄúOkay. Goodnight! I‚Äôll see you in the morning.‚Äù
I let go of my breasts and sat down on the couch. I rummaged around for the pillow I had been sitting on earlier and positioned it at one end of the sofa. I stretched out and pulled a blanket over me. As my eyes adjusted to the darkness, I looked around the apartment, taking in all of the unfamiliar shapes that now constituted my home. It was such a strange feeling to know that this was my new life. No more lazy Saturday mornings watching cartoons with my father. No more daily hugs. No more dinners or lunches or breakfasts. I had known this day was coming, but with all the fantasies I had harbored, I had never truly believed it.
Another loud crack of thunder broke the deafening silence of the room, making me shiver under the blanket. Soon my stepfather would be gone and it would be just me who would have to face these storms alone. Having him here I felt safe from the rain lashing the windows and the wind howling amongst the unfamiliar trees. How was I going to live without him?
On the next crack of thunder, I broke. Standing up cautiously, I moved across the living room, shuffling my feet to avoid tripping on the various knickknacks scattered about the floor. At the door to the bedroom I paused to listen. My father‚Äôs breathing was even; he seemed to be asleep. I stood there for a moment, undecided. Then lightning flashed again and the weird shadows cast about the apartment returned and I gave in.
‚ÄúDaddy?‚Äù I whispered.
My father‚Äôs breathing remained unchanged. I spoke again, the second time a little louder.
‚ÄúDaddy?‚Äù
My father shifted in the dark, and I saw the dim outline of him shift and rise up off the bed.
‚ÄúLeah, what is it?‚Äù ‚ÄúDaddy, I‚Äôm scared.‚Äù ‚ÄúOf the storm?‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù
‚ÄúOh, baby. It‚Äôs okay. There‚Äôs nothing to worry about.‚Äù ‚ÄúDo you mind if I sleep with you?‚Äù
‚ÄúOf course not. There‚Äôs plenty of room. Here,‚Äù my father moved aside and patted the bed beside him, ‚Äúclimb on in.‚Äù
I moved across the room and cautiously climbed into bed. I stretched my feet under the sheets and my toes touched my father‚Äôs bare calf. I nestled in further, lying down and pulling a blanket above my shoulders.
Thunder boomed again and I flinched and scooted closer to my father. His arms were behind his head, and I laid my head gently on his chest. He was not wearing a shirt; my cheek was pressed against his warm skin. I draped a hand over his stomach, squeezing my hand around his waist. I placed my legs against his. It was then I realized he was only wearing boxer briefs.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, honey,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think you‚Äôd be in bed with me. If you want, you can hand me my shirt and pants from the ground and I‚Äôll put them on.‚Äù
I squeezed his waist and snuggled my head into his chest.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mind, Daddy,‚Äù I breathed softly. ‚ÄúI like your warmth. I feel so safe in your arms.‚Äù
My father wrapped his arm around me, his fingers caressing my shoulder. I mewled a bit and slid my leg against his.
‚ÄúThank you, Daddy,‚Äù I whispered.
‚ÄúAnytime, sweetheart.‚Äù From his tone, I could tell he was smiling. ‚ÄúI need to soak it in while I can. Soon you are going to be gone away for good. I‚Äôm going to miss you.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to miss you, too. You‚Äôll have to come visit me. You promise?‚Äù ‚ÄúI promise. But I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre going to forget about your old father soon
enough.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not old.‚Äù
‚ÄúOlder than you,‚Äù he laughed.
‚ÄúBut not old. If anything, you‚Äôre perfect.‚Äù He laughed again and squeezed me tight. ‚ÄúThanks, love. It‚Äôs good to hear that.‚Äù
We lay there listening to the sound of the rain beat on the roof above us. It was my dream come true. I was in bed with my father, my face against his chest, his arm around me. Absentmindedly, I ran my fingers across his stomach, feeling the tight muscles of his abdomen.

I (24ftm) have been learning sign language for a couple of years now and am minoring in it at college. My goal is to become a therapist who is also fluent in ASL so I can take on deaf clients. The more I‚Äôve been going to deaf coffee chats, the more I get asked why I‚Äôm learning sign language, and the real answer is very personal. I usually just say that I didn‚Äôt want to learn a spoken language because I have auditory processing disorder, or that I took ASL as an elective and fell in love. They‚Äôre sort of true, but I started learning sign language when I was a little kid. Probably around age 6 or 7, I‚Äôm not really sure. At the time, I was being trafficked by my dad and some other family members, and I began learning ASL as a way to try and get help without putting myself in danger. My parents told me they had put a microchip in my brain (obviously not true, but at the time I had no clue due to my age), and that they could see and hear everything I did. It was a way for them to be sure that I wouldn‚Äôt tell anyone. I assumed I couldn‚Äôt speak English and I couldn‚Äôt write down what was happening either, so I started learning ASL so I could try and tell a teacher or a cop what was happening. Unfortunately, nobody I tried to talk to understood what I was saying, and I didn‚Äôt tell anybody about being trafficked until like‚Ä¶ last year? Maybe two years ago. Somewhere around there.

I did find that I loved the language, and that‚Äôs what made me want to learn it. My experiences also led me to doing research into access issues in mental health spaces, hence where I‚Äôm at now.

I guess I‚Äôm just posting this because it‚Äôs not something I really tell people, but sometimes I really want to say something. Although, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs appropriate at all for a casual conversation, which is also part of why I don‚Äôt say it even if I want to open up to that person.",3,1761615190.0,TrueOffMyChest,6,0.72,False

1ohwpbc,https://i.redd.it/k4iio1wg9rxf1.jpeg,Troubleshooting inconsistent pressure and discovered possible damage? [Breville Barista Express],"I recently bought my first real espresso machine with a used Breville Barista Express. The guy who sold it to me claimed to have taken good care of it and pulled a beautiful shot before I paid him, so I was feeling good. Pretty quickly after getting it home, it started to act up on me with inconsistent pressure. I tried a bunch of grind settings and played with the amount of grounds with no success - sometimes I would get a great shot and sometimes the same settings would have coffee and steam spraying out the side.

From a little troubleshooting online, it seemed to me that the issue was probably with either the gasket being worn or stuck grounds in the shower screen. I took them off to wash and was kind of surprised to see clear damage to the plastic head under the screen (I don't know what it's called). I don't know if you can tell from the picture, but it looks like the hard plastuc has been damaged, possibly slightly melted. It doesn't look like it would affect the seal, but I know these things can be fickle.

Can anyone help me with what this is, and how serious of a problem it is? Any other tips or suggestions in terms of how to troubleshoot the pressure issues I've been having? As of now my plan is to backflush the machine, replace the gasket (even though it doesn't seem that worn), and start over.

I started my zepbound journey about 3.5 months ago. I was 167 lbs at 5""3 after gaining happiness weight and having PCOS. I steadily lost 1 lb a week. Some weeks I lost a bit more some weeks I lost a bit less. Right now on the scale I'm sitting at about 152 lbs and some change depending on when I've eaten and how much water I drank. I was on the 2.5mg shot and I was mostly okay on it. When starting the medication I was nauseated the first week but after that I was normal. 

  
Two weeks ago I started having stomach issues. I will admit, sometimes I would forget to eat a meal in the morning and just have coffee or a bit of toast. I did eat during lunch and dinner times and ensured I made a decent effort to go to the gym and get my protein in. I was at a 200 calorie deficit and while I did go to the gym, I don't think it was ever more than an hour of activity.

I ended up being misdiagnosed for the past week. First it was the stomach flu, then it was stomach ulcers, then it was gastritis. Was being treated for ""Gastritis"" for 3 days when finally I began projectile vomiting up yellow bile and uncontrollably retching at anything entering my stomach. 

BP was 160/120 in triage and I was feverish and overall not doing well. Ended up in the emergency room where they poked me in the upper right side and ow. Ultrasound found some sludge in my gallbladder along with some inflammation.

Now I have a surgery scheduled for tomorrow morning to get my gallbladder removed and I can honestly say I never thought I'd see this coming. I'm a relatively healthy individual who lost weight at a normal rate in my opinion. I still really appreciate zepbound as a drug and it's helped so many people. My biggest piece of advice is really monitor your cholesterol levels and work on eating more fiber if you can. 

Much love to all of you on your journey. I'm afraid mine is ending here.",2,1761614699.0,Zepbound,14,0.67,False

1ohwmgg,https://www.reddit.com/r/FATTravel/comments/1ohwmgg/four_seasons_minneapolis_review/,Four Seasons Minneapolis Review,"I recently stayed at the Four Seasons in Minneapolis for a football game that I was attending with a few friends. I rented three rooms, all with great views, and I have to say that although the hard product was great and the service was good at times, the overall stay was very mixed. I‚Äôm fully aware that this hotel is not a premier property for Four Seasons, and that it‚Äôs common to have a mixed experience, but I wanted to give an update. So here's my review. I'll start with the arrival.

**Arrival & Check-In**  
We were dropped off at the front of the hotel and were promptly greeted by the valet service before the vehicle had even come to a full stop. Our bags were taken care of, and everything felt smooth and polished‚Äîan excellent first impression. As we walked into the beautiful lobby, we were greeted at the front desk, offered cold water (which we accepted), and I asked about the possibility of early check-in (it was 11:00 AM).

I had booked the rooms under the Amex Fine Hotels & Resorts program, which includes the possibility of early check-in starting at noon. I wasn‚Äôt expecting much since we were early for even the early check-in, but they exceeded expectations: all three rooms were made available to us immediately. The front desk associate was fantastic‚Äîwarm, knowledgeable, and thorough in reviewing our Amex benefits and answering our questions.

NOTE: I booked these rooms months ago, but more recently, I began working with Sarah and her team for travel, and I‚Äôm sure this experience would have been better with their involvement!

**Room Quality**  
Walking into my room, I was immediately impressed. It felt like a proper Four Seasons experience‚Äîtastefully decorated, well-lit, with a beautiful bathroom and a stunning view of both Target Field and the Mississippi River. The bed and pillows were comfortable, and overall, the room met the high standards I expect from the brand. My only note here was that the toilet seat was kind of loose, causing it to shift unexpectedly when you sit down. That wasn‚Äôt a big deal to me though, and I didn‚Äôt bring it up to anyone.

**Engineering Team & Concierge**

Shortly after, one of my friends in the other room discovered that his minibar/fridge was broken. He used the in-app chat to request assistance, and the engineer who arrived was actually one of the highlights of the trip. Not only was he helpful, but he also ended up having a personal connection to one of our group members from years ago. He fixed the fridge while we were out to lunch, and later sent up a surprise s‚Äômores spread‚Äîwith the smores treats shaped like the state of Minnesota. It was a thoughtful and memorable gesture that we were all blown away by!

Separately, the concierge gave a spot-on lunch recommendation to a local burger spot that ended up being a huge hit with the group. We really appreciated the local insight.

**Service Issues Begin**  
This is where some of the cracks started to show. Later in the afternoon, while waiting for dinner, I ordered coffee and tea service to one of our three rooms where we were all hanging out. It took nearly 50 minutes to arrive. When I followed up through the app, I was told it had already been delivered‚Äîexcept it hadn‚Äôt. Turns out it had been mistakenly delivered to one of our other rooms.

Rather than fixing the issue themselves, the staff told me it would be ‚Äúfastest‚Äù if I just went over and grabbed it myself. This didn‚Äôt feel very Four Seasons‚Äìlike. For a five-star property, that response felt a little off-brand‚Äîlike we were being asked to do the job of the staff. That being said, the coffee and tea were still hot and of good quality.

***Mara*** **Restaurant**

I had made reservations for breakfast at the in-hotel restaurant *Mara* for our whole group for the morning of the game. The host looked up our reservation and informed me it had been cancelled the day before. What? I told him that can‚Äôt be right, and I even have an email confirmation from the other day. He was apologetic and said he could still get us in‚Äîgreat!

After being seated, no one came over for at least 10 minutes. Finally, waters were brought over and the waiter arrived to take our order. We ordered drinks and breakfast. As the drinks were brought out, they were all given to the wrong person. Then, the food was brought out, and every plate went to the wrong person. We played musical plates, but then noticed some of us didn‚Äôt have silverware, there was no butter on the table, and no salt and pepper. We asked, and those things were delivered shortly thereafter. We also need to flag someone down to have our water and coffee topped off. These are all service miscues that I just don‚Äôt expect at a place like *Mara*. Frankly, I‚Äôve been to Waffle Houses with better service.

That being said, the food was very good. I would 10/10 recommend the food, and it did somewhat make up for the lackluster service.

The next day, we returned for breakfast before departing the hotel, this time without reservations because I rightly assumed we wouldn‚Äôt need them on a Monday morning. The service was somewhat better, our waiter definitely felt more professional, and our drinks were topped off without asking. Also, there was salt and pepper on the table. That being said, although the second breakfast was an improvement, some of the themes from the day prior persisted (I think we waited even longer for the first person to show up at our table after being seated!).

**Turndown Service**  
Turndown service was just *okay* on both nights. There were no thoughtful touches like cord wraps, lens wipes, or personalized notes‚Äîthings I‚Äôve seen at other Four Seasons properties. They didn‚Äôt even draw the curtains or dim the lights. It felt like a missed opportunity to elevate the experience.

**What Really Pissed Me Off**

The morning of checkout, I set an alarm for 8:00 AM. At approximately 7:00 AM, I was woken up by the sound of the room‚Äôs doorbell. I initially ignored it, thinking it must be a mistake by another guest going to the wrong room. Then, the ringing didn‚Äôt stop. It kept being rang over and over again, until I finally got out of bed and stomped over to answer the door, thinking that one of my friends was messing with me‚Äîbeing woken up an hour before your alarm is set to go off is not fun! It was not another guest or one of my friends; it was room service that I did not order.¬†

Like the day before, this order was placed by one of the other rooms on our reservation and was being delivered to my room by accident. The staff member looked surprised and apologized, and I was probably a little abrupt with my response and frustration (nothing that crossed the line into being rude, but I couldn‚Äôt even focus my eyes, going from a completely dark room to a bright hallway).

Later that morning, I talked to my friend who had actually made the order, and he said the staff member mentioned I was not happy and that he would be letting management know about the mistake so they could do right by me/us. No one ever reached out.¬†

**Overall Impressions:**  
The hard product is beautiful. The rooms are great. The front desk, engineering staff, and concierge stood out in a good way. But service inconsistencies left a mixed impression. I wouldn‚Äôt say it was a bad stay, but I also wouldn‚Äôt call it particularly good either, especially given the brand and price point. Looking at other reviews of this hotel in this and other subs, it doesn‚Äôt look like I‚Äôm the only one who has had a sub-optimal experience at this hotel.¬†

NOTE: For those who may be concerned about a zero-karma account writing a review, I‚Äôve been in the sub for a few years now, but wanted to create a separate account to maintain anonymity and be honest in my reviews. I‚Äôll be interacting more regularly in the various travel subs from this account, from now on. My next review will be on a recent family trip to Costa Rica, where we stayed at both Nekajui and Origins Lodge.

It mostly happens in the morning if she's fussy and doesn't want to be put down even after I feed her change her and even put ms rachel on briefly. When I'm just waking up and she's like that I get so overstimulated and i start huffing and puffing. I don't want her to fear being upset because I'm audibly frustrated. I have schizoaffective disorder so I need extra time to regulate myself when I get overwhelmed and I fear I may yell or something. It hasn't happened yet fortunately. But I'll set her in her playpen get coffee and have a cigarette (please don't judge im trying to quit) to try and get woken up and calmed down. ",1,1761614284.0,AttachmentParenting,4,0.6,False

1ohwf87,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeschoolRecovery/comments/1ohwf87/ive_grown_to_resent_my_parents_and_the_way_they/,"I've grown to resent my parents, and the way they ""homeschooled"" me.","I am a 22 year old neurodivergent person. I was basically ""homeschooled"" my entire life, and did not go to a single public school or hold any bit of intuition. As I got older, the more I realized just how bad this choice my parents made has caused me, and how I feel I am having to pick up so many of my own pieces to feel remotely functional in this world, especially at the state it's in.

My parents both grew up going to public schools (no college) all while growing up. My parents both come from backgrounds of poor mental/physical health, but both have managed to scrape by. My dad was in the military, now a very respected salesman and my mother works in the hotel industry. They were travelling and being rather adventourous as adults in their 20's before they had us. Meanwhile, my brother and I (I'm 22, he just turnt 24), are struggling mentally, physically, and have been set up for failure since the very start, and my parents don't seem to care whatsoever.

For context, I began ""homeschooling"" at the age of 7 years old. Prior to that, I didn't do much of anything (didn't even own curriculum books).. despite starting to late, my parents had the ***genius idea*** to put my brother and I in 6th grade work. Of course when you do this, my brother and I struggled a LOT with our curriculum, and any attempts we tried to learn, our parents were not equipped to handle two (at the time) unrecognized neurodivergent kids, who needed serious help in learning their work. I would endure a lot of verbal abuse from my parents for getting math wrong, *especially.* Flash cards thrown at me, verbal lashings, and they also most of the time barely were hands on with us. They left us to our books and expected us to learn the material. By the age of 9, we became homeless due to an eviction that had impacted our credit, and we weren't able to qualify for an apartment for about 3-4 years. Our parents got us new curriculum books while we lived in hotels, but I'd argue with how close in proximity my brother and I always were to our parents, the emotional and verbal abuse worsened, ontop of us still struggling with our curriculums. My dad would sling a lot of ableist language at me for getting my work wrong, especially language arts and math. I didn't learn how to properly write until I was about 14, which I learnt how to do overtime by using the internet, not a single bit from them. Eventually, they became even more hands-off, and would barely supervise us or check in with us when we'd be doing our work. It's like they gave up. At 16 I fantasized the idea of working in a coffee shop, but that would be shut down quickly by my dad saying I needed to ""do my school work first""... but of course, I was still basically learning nothing and with no help, and my attention span could not bother with any of it, and math would give me so much anxiety, that I'd be scared to show my work if my parents even asked for it. They'd always suggest places I could work (they still do) but would put no effort in making sure I'd be able to handle my own. They made finding work sound incredibly difficult, all the while not helping my brother and I get to a point where we could.

My parents would frequently tell us to not go outside, especially before 3:00PM, because they didn't want us to get them caught for having truant kids. Despite their worries of truancy, they still basically educated us. We were isolated basically the majority of our lives. And I didn't really hold many IRL friends due to my poor social skills as a teenager, especially. I stopped going outside due to worsening mental health around 15. Most of my social interactions were online. My parents hated the idea of me talking to people online and that I should be doing my work, but again; they payed not much attention at all or didn't push, expected us to focus when we didn't have the tools to do so, or care. I had to get sneaky just to talk to my friends, because otherwise home life was so debilitatingly lonely that I didn't know where else I could go. I credit the internet for helping me find resources, articles, and forums discussing this type of educational and emotional abuse. 

As an adult now, I can strongly say that homeschooling (or in my case, the severe lack thereof) has devastated my self esteem and confidence, as well as made it difficult for me to ever get work (even if I wanted to). My parents don't seem to care about how we feel in this, and has even boasted before in front of me that they're ""proud"" of how they raised us and that they did their jobs. BUT my dad has simultaneously said before that he has given up on my brother (for having a hard time socializing or being inside all the time... despite being disabled and not given the proper spaces to actually LEARN how to do this either). It's all incredibly humiliating and I would have days where I mourn the fact I will never get to experience what it's like to graduate, or to of been to real classes, or make friends, go to homecoming, etc. None of that. My life feels like a major waste, and it feels unfair that my parents got to experience the lives they did in some way before we came around, while my brother and I are left unsure of what to do anymore and we're having to pick up ourselves just to survive now. The emotional neglect has only worsened on my parents end too, as they seem to be checked out. Even when we were kids they never took us to get medical checked, dentist, nothing. None of that. Even when we found stability again and have an apartment, my dad making good money at work and my mom working too, and still none of that. My parents are enjoying their lives now, going to disney multiple times in a few years, constantly flying, going to concerts, etc. While my brother and I remain inside, barely functional and very mentally ill.

I have plans to get out of here as soon as I am able, but until the plan is finalized and can be realized, too. I am having to survive around them while grappling with the fear and humility of lacking an education has done on me.

I have grown to resent my parents and what they have done to my brother and I, and I refuse to forgive them for it. Especially since even CURRENTLY they're excited about going to disney next week, while I spent a better part of a few months trying to raise concerns about my health to my mom. Nothing, stonewalled. They're checked out. It feels like my life is at a dead end when I should be happy and experiencing life the way a lot of people my age get too.

I've been wanting to air this off of my chest somewhere for a long time. I felt like here would of been the best place to do it. It has been reassuring and validating to see others just like me going through very similar experiences. Makes me not feel alone despite the horrible cards I've been dealt. I know I deserve better, and I am trying to seek my way to it, but the scars they left me will not heal for a very long time, and it's the fact I know they don't really care too much or blame us for being ""lazy slackers"" and deadbeats, and other degrading labels. Our education was a major after thought, and they were not one bit prepared to teach us. Public school may of not been perfect, but I would of rather had it than homeschooling.

This is a bit of a messy vent, and there's so much more I could say. But it feels good to let a lot of this out. I didn't want to feel alone in this, anymore.",7,1761614095.0,HomeschoolRecovery,0,0.9,False

1ohwdza,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ohwdza,"I Came Back Cold, But I'm the One Burning Them Down","When my stepsister Jade and I both got caught in an avalanche, the rescue team finally reached us.


But there was only one stretcher. Only room for one person to make it down.


My father grabbed my hand, his grip tight.


""Vivian, sweetheart, you know Jade's always been delicate. Be a good girl and let her go first. Just wait here‚Äîthe next team will be here soon.""


In my past life, I believed him. I gave Jade my chance to survive.


But then the storm picked back up. The rescue was called off. And I froze to death on that mountain.


Meanwhile, Jade inherited everything I owned.


She and my fianc√©‚Äîwho she'd been sleeping with behind my back all along‚Äîlived happily ever after on my fortune.


My spirit hovered above my own memorial service, and I heard my father tell the guests:


""That girl was always so difficult. At least dying to save Jade gave her life some meaning.""


When I woke up again, I was back at that exact moment‚Äîmy father's hand gripping mine on the frozen slope.


This time, I nodded through my tears and gently helped Jade onto the stretcher myself.


They want a sacrifice? Well. I'll get them one. Just not the one they planned.


...


The storm was picking up fast. Within seconds, the rescue team vanished into a wall of white.


I dragged my ass through the snow, every muscle screaming in protest.


Finally, I found a slope sheltered from the wind and carved out a makeshift snow cave, cramming myself inside and curling into a ball.


Cut off from the howling wind, my body temperature slowly started climbing back up.


I fished the satellite phone out of my inner jacket pocket and powered it on.


The screen lit up, casting an eerie glow on my ghostly white face.


Full bars.


I dialed. He picked up on the first ring.


""Well, look who it is. Finally grace me with a call, your highness? Thought you were off conquering Everest without us peasants cramping your style.""


Zeke. My ride-or-die from back in my extreme sports days.


An absolute maniac who'd choose life over a paycheck any day‚Äîand who didn't give a damn about anyone except me.


""Zeke,"" I said quietly. ""I'm stuck in an avalanche zone.""


Dead silence.


Then‚ÄîCRASH‚Äîa chair hitting the floor, followed by his voice exploding through the speaker.


""WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK?! Viv, where are you?!""


""Chill."" I rattled off my coordinates, my voice flat and cold. ""I'm okay for now. But I need you to pull me out.""


""What about search and rescue?""


""They airlifted Jade out."" I might as well have been reading off a grocery list. ""Dad told me to wait my turn.""


Beat.


Zeke knew exactly what kind of circus my family was.


""Wait your turn? Wait your fucking turn?! Like hell you will!""


He was losing it now.


""I checked the forecast‚Äîthere's a monster blizzard rolling in within twelve hours. They'll ground everything. No flights, no rescues, nothing!


""He's basically signing your death warrant!""


""Yeah,"" I said flatly. ""I know.""


""Sit tight, Viv. I don't care if I have to steal a goddamn helicopter‚ÄîI'm getting you off that mountain.""


Call ended.


I slumped against the icy wall and closed my eyes, rationing what little energy I had left.


Meanwhile, down in civilization? Oh, I knew what was happening.


My devoted father was probably standing in front of a news crew right now, playing the heartbroken dad forced to be brave after ""losing"" his beloved daughter.


And my sweet, fragile stepsister?


Definitely tucked into some luxury hospital suite, soaking up five-star medical treatment while everyone fawned over her with sympathy.


Oh, and my fianc√©?


Yeah. He was probably right there at her bedside, holding her delicate little hand, murmuring that none of this was her fault.


Because that's EXACTLY how it played out last time.


Bored out of my mind, I opened the satellite phone's browser.


The signal crawled, but it was just enough to load a few headlines.


""Heroic sister: Heiress Missing After Avalanche While Saving Stepsister""


""Sisterly Love Moves Nation: Vivian Montgomery Sacrifices Herself to Save Stepsister""


""Devastated Father Vows: 'We Won't Stop Searching'""


I almost laughed.


""Heroic sister."" ""Sisterly love.""


Whoever wrote this garbage deserved an award for creative fiction.


I clicked on one article. The photo made my stomach turn.


There was Dad‚Äîred-rimmed eyes, looking like death warmed over, practically collapsing into his assistant's arms.


Jade was propped up in a hospital bed, pale as a ghost, IV in her arm.


And my darling fianc√©? Perched on the edge of her bed, carefully peeling an apple for her.


What a touching tableau. Father and daughter. Star-crossed lovers.


I saved the photo. Then shut the damn thing off.


Time dragged.


I wrapped myself tighter in the emergency blanket, curling into the smallest ball possible.


Even with the cave blocking the wind, the cold burrowed deep into my bones.


I lost track of how long I'd been sitting there when the satellite phone finally buzzed again.


Zeke.


""Viv, you there? We're in the mountain range now. Can't land the chopper‚Äîwe're hiking up. Just hold on a little longer, okay?""


""Relax. I'm not dying yet."" I licked my cracked lips. ""Do me a favor though.""


""Shoot.""


""Check flight records in and out of Manhattan over the past week. See if there's a passenger named Julian Bradford.""


Julian Bradford. My CHARMING fianc√©.


In my past life, I didn't find out until after I was dead‚Äîhe'd been screwing Jade the entire time.


This whole ""arranged engagement"" thing? Just a scam. The three of them plotting together to swallow up everything my mother left me.


He played the perfect fianc√© to my face. Behind my back? He and Jade were inseparable.


Zeke went quiet for a second. Then I heard furious typing.


""Got it. He flew back from Paris three days ago. First class.""


Three days ago.


The day before the avalanche.


My heart dropped into my stomach.


So that's how it is.


Couldn't even wait, huh?


Chapter 2


""Zeke, one more thing."" My voice was ice-cold.


""Get photos of Julian and Jade together in that hospital room. Then send them to every gossip site in Manhattan. Anonymously.""


I paused.


""Subject line: 'Heiress Still Missing, Fianc√© Already Cozy with Stepsister in Hospital Suite.'""


Zeke let out a low whistle.


""Damn. Remind me never to cross you.""


""Finally playing dirty, huh? About time. Those bastards deserve it.""


""This is just the appetizer,"" I said quietly.


After hanging up, I forced down the last energy bar. I needed to conserve my strength.


The real fight was waiting for me below.


---


Eventually, darkness swallowed everything. Inside the snow cave, I couldn't see my own hand.


Just when my body started shutting down, I heard it‚Äîboots crunching through snow, voices cutting through the wind.


""Vivian!""


""Miss Montgomery!""


Zeke and his people!


I summoned every ounce of strength left and dragged myself out of the cave.


Through the blizzard, I spotted them‚Äîfigures moving toward me with flashlights cutting through the white.


Zeke was leading the pack.


The second he saw me, he rushed over and pulled me into a tight hug.


""Holy shit, you're actually alive!""


His voice shook.


I patted his shoulder weakly. ""Told you I wouldn't die.""


""Yeah, yeah. Save the tough talk. Let's get the hell out of here before we all turn into popsicles.""


Immediately, one of his guys threw a heavy parka over my shoulders. Another handed me a thermos.


Hot coffee burned down my throat. First real warmth I'd felt in hours.


---


The climb down was brutal.


Zeke's team strapped me into a harness and kept me sandwiched between them for safety.


Even then, I nearly slipped and fell more times than I could count.


""Vivian, hold ON!"" Zeke yelled over his shoulder.


I gritted my teeth and forced myself to keep moving, one step at a time.


I couldn't die here.


Not before I got to watch my loving father and darling sister go down in flames.


---


After what felt like an eternity, we finally made it to base camp.


Instead of heading to the main rescue site, Zeke steered me around back where a black SUV sat waiting in the shadows.


""Get in. We'll sort everything out once we're back in the city.""


The heat slammed into me the second I climbed inside. My frozen muscles started to unthaw.


Zeke pulled a first aid kit from the back and started checking me over.


""Could be worse,"" he muttered while wrapping gauze around my fingers. ""Frostbite, exhaustion, some cuts. Nothing life-threatening.""


As he worked, he kept up a steady stream of curses under his breath.


""Richard Montgomery, that son of a bitch‚Äîwhen we get back, I'm gonna have someone break both his legs!""


""Don't."" I caught his wrist. ""Assault lands you in prison. I want him destroyed in ways that hurt way worse than broken bones.""


Zeke went still and stared at me.


""Viv... you're different.""


""Yeah, well."" I leaned back against the seat, exhausted. ""Dying has a way of changing you.""


---


The SUV tore through the night, mile after mile, until finally the city lights blazed into view.


Zeke brought me straight to a penthouse suite at the Waldorf in Midtown.


""Stay here for now. Whatever you do, don't go home. That place is a viper's nest.""


I didn't argue.


""What about my dad‚Äî""


""Already handled,"" he cut me off. ""Got people watching him round the clock. He breathes wrong, I'll know.""


Then Zeke tossed me a brand new phone.


""Your number's already ported over. Anything comes up, call me immediately.""


---


I took a long, scalding shower and changed into clean clothes. Finally felt like a human being again.


Standing at the floor-to-ceiling windows, I stared out at the glittering Manhattan skyline. Inside, though, I felt nothing but cold emptiness.


After Mom died, I'd completely fallen apart. The depression nearly killed me.


Dad and Jade were the ones who ""saved"" me‚Äîwrapped me up in all that warmth, all that concern, all that picture-perfect family love.


But now I understood the truth. They never wanted to save me.


They just needed me alive long enough to slowly bleed my inheritance dry.


My phone buzzed. A text from Zeke.


[Photos sent. All the outlets bit. Tomorrow morning's gonna be a circus.]


I typed back: [Perfect.]


Then I scrolled through my contacts and dialed another number.


Uncle Chen. Mom's lawyer. The only person she'd ever truly trusted.


""Uncle Chen. It's me, Vivian.""


A sharp intake of breath on the other end.


""Vivian? But I thought‚Äîweren't you stuck on that mountain‚Äî""


""I made it back,"" I said evenly. ""And I need your help with something. I need a complete inventory of everything Mom left me‚Äîevery stock, every account, every single asset. After that, I need you to draft an emergency freeze on all of it.""


Long silence.


""Vivian... what's going on?""


I stared at my pale reflection in the dark glass.


""Someone just tried to leave me for DEAD on that mountain,"" I said quietly. ""And now they're coming for everything Mom left me.""


Chapter 3


The next morning, my phone went off like a bomb.


Notifications flooded the screen, one after another, until I could barely see straight.


**#MontgomeryHeiressFianc√©CaughtCheating**


**#HighSocietyScandal: Was It Murder?**


**#JadeMontgomeryExposed: Victim or Manipulator?**


The media had plastered yesterday's cozy hospital photo right next to my headline.


The irony was chef's kiss.


And the comments section? Absolute chaos.


*""Wait, WHAT? Vivian's still missing and these two are already hooking up?""*


*""I KNEW Jade looked sketchy. Total fake bitch vibes.""*


*""Poor Vivian. She literally sacrificed herself to save a snake.""*


*""And the fianc√©'s no better. His girl's not even COLD yet and he's moved on? Disgusting.""*


Just like that, public opinion flipped overnight.


Jade and Julian‚Äîyesterday's tragic heroes‚Äîwere now getting absolutely torn apart online.


I smiled.


This was only step one.


---


A few hours later, Montgomery Group scrambled to issue an emergency statement.


In it, my father condemned the ""vicious slander"" from ""unethical media outlets"" and threatened legal action against anyone spreading ""baseless rumors.""


Then he announced a press conference scheduled for 3 p.m. at Montgomery Tower to ""set the record straight once and for all.""


I texted Zeke immediately.


[3 PM. Montgomery Tower. I need you to set up my grand entrance.]


His reply came back instantly.


[Say less. It's gonna be EPIC.]


---


By 2:50 p.m., the plaza outside Montgomery Tower was already swarming with reporters.


I sat in the back of Zeke's SUV, sunglasses and mask firmly in place, watching the feeding frenzy unfold through tinted windows.


""Everything's set,"" Zeke said, glancing back at me. ""You'll slip in through the side entrance. My guy will get you backstage without anyone spotting you.""


""Perfect.""


At exactly 3 p.m., the press conference began.


I stood backstage, watching the whole thing unfold on a monitor.


Three people sat at the long table in front of a wall of cameras.


My father, Richard Montgomery, sat front and center‚Äîlooking haggard, grief-stricken, every inch the devastated parent.


Jade and Julian flanked him on either side, both with their heads bowed in perfect synchronized misery.


Dad leaned forward into the microphone, his voice thick with emotion.


""First, I want to thank all of you for coming during this incredibly difficult time.""


He paused, letting the weight of his words settle.


""The lies circulating online have caused my family immeasurable pain. My daughter Vivian remains missing‚Äîher fate still unknown‚Äîand yet, instead of support, we've been met with vicious attacks on my other daughter, Jade, and my future son-in-law, Julian.""


Another pause. Perfectly timed.


""Jade and Vivian grew up together. They were inseparable. Vivian risked her LIFE to save Jade on that mountain. And now? Jade blames herself more than anyone. She's barely eaten. Barely slept. She's only holding on by sheer willpower.""


His voice wavered just slightly.


""As for Julian‚Äîhe and Vivian were like family. The MOMENT he heard what happened, he dropped everything and flew back from abroad. He's been at the hospital around the clock, taking care of Jade because that's what Vivian would have wanted. He's been there because Jade needs to survive‚Äîfor Vivian's sake.""


Then came the crescendo.


""What they share is pure, familial love. And yet these VULTURES have twisted it into something filthy and disgusting.""


He looked straight into the camera, eyes blazing with righteous anger.


""I have to ask‚Äîdo any of you even have a CONSCIENCE?""


The performance was flawless.


Several of the female reporters were already tearing up.


Then it was Jade's turn.


She reached for the microphone with trembling hands, her eyes red and puffy.


""I'm so sorry...This is all my fault. If Vivian hadn't tried to save me, she wouldn't have‚Äî""


She couldn't finish. She pressed both hands over her face, shoulders shaking with sobs.


Right on cue, Julian leaned over and gently took her hand in his.


""Jade, don't,"" he murmured softly. ""None of this is your fault.""


Then he lifted his head and looked directly into the cameras, his eyes glistening with unshed tears.


""Jade and I are INNOCENT. And I truly believe‚Äîwherever Vivian is right now‚Äîshe wouldn't want to see us destroyed like this.""


God, the ACTING.


I stood there watching them through the monitor, and my smile grew colder with every passing second.


Alright then.


Show's over.


Time for MY entrance.


I pulled out my phone and sent Zeke the signal.


Let's deliver my little gift.

TLDR: I am 21F and was in a nearly two-year relationship with a 21M. He repeatedly lied, crossed boundaries, and ghosted me while I was going through a mental health crisis and a pregnancy. I have been no contact for almost two months and finally feel like I can breathe.


Has anyone else gone through something similar? 

How did you cope and start feeling like yourself again?

I know I shouldn‚Äôt cling on to wishing for someone‚Äôs downfall but I hope he gets his karma.




Full story, sorry for typos etc I‚Äôm on mobile atm.

I‚Äôm 21F. Was in a relationship for nearly two years. It is unclear as this man (21M) had me on a string before he labelled it formally in the summer of 2024. The amount of times I walked away and he told me he had reconsidered and then kept me waiting was something I for some reason ignored. 

We had started arguing more around February of this year - because he had lied to me about small things. I set a boundary, told him if he can‚Äôt do that then it would be best to not continue. He agreed to it and I did not speak about it ever again until I had found out in June from his friend that he had signed a lease ages ago to live with them. Initially I was excited and happy for him. Then I realised this was news that I wasn‚Äôt getting from him and started crying. It was honestly so embarrassing that I was the last to know. His friend reassured me and told me I was above him? 

I got home that night and waited for him to come home after work. I calmly asked him after he had settled down ‚Äúhey (friends name) told me you had signed a lease and are moving into your new house in September. Why did you not say anything?‚Äù

Just excuses. ‚ÄúI never tell my parents anything‚Äù ‚ÄúI felt pressured to do it‚Äù ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want you to be upset‚Äù 

I just told him it was okay and that I would rather he told me first. But deep down I knew he was planning a future with out me, I was just heavily in denial.

I couldn‚Äôt sleep that night. Something was not right. I checked his phone: lo and behold snapping a girl from his work for three weeks straight. At the top of his friends list. Sounds so childish but that was the one boundary that I had asked of him. It had made me deeply uncomfortable and I had made him aware of that months back. 

I think I overreacted but I threw his phone at him and told him to get out of my bed.

Some how reconciled but I knew he had resented me for this. He ended up stonewalling me towards the end of June. I was mentally unstable at this point. He kept saying he would see me or talk to me in person or on the phone for a whole week but never did. 

I was miserable. Would not stop crying. I would cry the whole day. Even in work. It was so bad. I was not used to feeling like this, my friends weren‚Äôt used to seeing me this way.

Ended up trying to kill myself. Didn‚Äôt hear from him for three weeks. Saw him again and after I left I tried to overdose on my medication. It was horrible. 

I lost 15kgs, I couldn‚Äôt go outside, couldn‚Äôt bring myself to go to the gym, passed on activities that had to do with friends and took sick leave from work for five weeks. The only time I felt like going out was to see my doctor/psychiatrist/therapist/pharmacist. I spent the majority of July in my room crying.

My friend came back from holiday and suggested we hang out. She really helped me ground my thoughts and helped me detach a lot. I felt better but something was still off; after all the grief and pain I had been feeling I had seemed to forget that I hadn‚Äôt had my period in about two months. When I had visited my doctor when this all kicked off, I told my doctor I missed a period but she wrote it off as adjusting to my medication and stress that I was under. I was suicidal and highly emotional. 

It was because l was pregnant from May onwards. 

I made my ex known to this. On the day of the surgery I was highly emotional. It is so hard to go through something like this especially when the person you envisioned a future with had told you two months back they don‚Äôt see one with you anymore and you are in the middle of processing that whilst being exposed to them again. 

He kept making conversation to calm me down. I just could not stop crying. He would ask to hold my hand or to rest my head on his shoulder and I would be hesitant to at first but it was hard to say no because the whole thing was a scary experience. We talked like nothing had happened and it was comforting. 

Before I went in for surgery he asked to hug me. I said I love you to him and he said it back.

The nurse woke me up and I was in shock and started crying in a panic. I realised where I was and what had happened. Ex was there. He looked stressed. Said he had never been so stressed in his life. I definitely felt some clarity after the surgery. We spoke and I told him I was sorry for everything, I forgive him for everything, that I wished him well and that I can move on fully now.

Took me to my friends to look after me and continued to message me to make sure I was okay. He then suggested to meet up in person the following week. I was skeptical. Told him it wouldn‚Äôt be good if he met out of guilt and what I said in person was how I truly felt. He then said it would be good for the both of us to get closure. I agreed. Called him three days before the suggested day to confirm, and to ask why he wanted to meet. He said ever since he broke up with me he felt like he was stuck in a hole and couldn‚Äôt move on.

He proceeded to ghost me. So I confronted him in person. It wasn‚Äôt planned, I was actually out with my work friends and they happened to go to the place he worked at. I didn‚Äôt know he was working but when I saw him I was disgusted. I asked him why he hadn‚Äôt said anything when we were supposed to see each other tomorrow. He said he has been working so much. Another stupid fucking excuse. I called him pathetic.

He messaged me later that night apologising and then blaming me for calling him pathetic in front of his work mates. 

Funny way of taking accountability. 

Then went on to say he still wanted to see me and I told him I don‚Äôt need closure. I asked him not to contact me again unless it had to do with the remains. He tried to further the conversation after that.

I haven‚Äôt spoken to him for I think nearly two months now. I feel amazing. Since I had done so, he has unprivated his instagram account, posted gym videos (ones with sad deep music) and reposted a few notable posts; one being a Dexter edit where he says he ‚Äúdestroys everything he loves‚Äù and another with a girl singing a song about a person who stops talking to them which is helping her move on. 

I have not done anything. I have not posted anything strange and out of character and I am quite private with my online presence. 

His mother reached out to me before his birthday asking how I was and I told her I was fine and I hoped she was well. His friend saw me getting coffee with my friend two weeks ago and initiated a conversation and it was a really nice interaction. That evening his dad reached out and asked how I was. 

I felt the need to remove his family off my social media. I know his parents care for me but it also felt as if it  was bypassing my no contact boundaries.

I think the last bit of information that I unwillingly found out through someone that was connected to him was that since he broke up with me he had slept with 6-7 people, one being his manager from work.

He is honestly so pathetic that he can‚Äôt even sit in silence to process being alone. And despite this nightmare humiliation ritual that I have went through, I am glad that I am taking the time to be alone, see my friends and get therapy while I heal. 

So please go into no contact especially if you were dumped. Delete everything. You don‚Äôt need the unnecessary space on your phone. Even try to detox from social media, and block wherever you can. I feel horrible about removing his family because I was really close to them but I‚Äôm sure they can understand that the only thing that will help me is to move on. Delete messages. Delete calendar dates. Even songs connected to them has to go until you have truly and fully detached. Until a week goes by and they have bot crossed your mind.

I‚Äôm still healing but I haven‚Äôt gotten emotional about it anymore and instead of anger or sadness it is just ambivalence now.

So basically my train got cancelled so I had to wait for another one 25 minutes later, I could've walked through a crowded, busy, and overstimulating street to grab some food for cheap but I decided I'd rather pay more to avoid that so I went to a coffee shop in the train station.

When I got to the front of the queue I held no eye contact and felt my mind and body almost separate entirely, I was whatever the polar opposite of in command is, and I said ""can I have... what do you call it... what do you call it... [the wrong thing]"" and ordered the wrong thing. It wasn't that or that I didn't ask for a new one that made me feel bad, it was the fact both the server and everyone in the queue behind me was looking at me like they thought I was stoned out my mind (I was not, I had had a 30mg CBD gummy, no weed).

1ohw832,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDarkArchive/comments/1ohw832/cold_carry/,Cold Carry.,"We pulled a man out of snowmelt below a slide path in central Idaho. Storm had just come off the ridge and left the creek high, cloudy, and cold enough to sting through rubber. He was in to his waist. Pants in ribbons. No boots. Lips the wrong color. He was trying to walk crosscurrent like the bank existed where he wanted it, not where it was.

We figured he slipped. He hadn‚Äôt.

We got him into spike. A meadow with tents knotted together by guyline, a stove that coughed more than it heated, gear laid on tarps to pretend it would dry. He wouldn‚Äôt give a name. He sat where we told him and watched the tent wall. He kept saying the same line: it spared me. Same tone every time, like reciting a policy he didn‚Äôt write.

We tried food. Jerky first. Then a tin mug of stew. He shoved the crate hard enough to rattle the lantern pole and yelled at the steam, not at us. Said if he ate, the ridge would hear.

Our EMT put a hand on his wrist and counted while the rest of us watched the zipper because watching anything felt better than listening. Pulse fast, steady. Skin cold, chest warm on the cheap thermometer. We blamed the lantern heat for the lack of breath fog. We blamed a lot of things on the lantern.

When the crew hiked to flag a new line, I stayed. Med tent. Lantern turned down. Rain ticking on the mesh like a clock you don‚Äôt want to own. The stove snapped once and went quiet.

He talked.

He said he and two friends went up for a high lake that sits in a rock bowl. Three nights. Fishing when the wind let them. Quiet when it didn‚Äôt. They sang old songs low the third night because the fire made a circle and quiet made a bigger one outside it.

Something answered.

Not echo. Echo comes back the same shape. This didn‚Äôt. It waited. Then returned the tune bent the wrong way, like it learned it while it was gone and preferred its version.

He wouldn‚Äôt call it anything except ‚Äúthe Hushed One.‚Äù

He said it learned their steps. Who unzipped which tent. Who left to piss and how long it took. Who opened the bear can and how quiet he tried to be. It didn‚Äôt rush. It took them when the dark felt thicker than canvas.

Mark went first. They followed a drag through needles to some whitebark and found his call whistle hanging from a twig. When he blew it, the note pulled inward. He tried again and felt the air come back at his face.

Javier went the next night. He swore he heard humming while it carried him across broken rock. Not Javier‚Äôs tune. The notes backward on purpose.

By morning he was alone. No insects, no birds. The lake lay flat like metal. He said even the small ripples near shore looked printed there, not moving with the rest.

He ran. Cut his hands on talus. Sliced a knee open bad enough he could see white and wrapped it in a shirt. Drank snowmelt until his stomach cramped. Food hurt his teeth like someone pressed on them from inside. He stuffed tissue in his ears and still felt a thought push at him from the back of his mouth: stop moving, kneel, let the cold finish it.

Then it spared him.

Dawn at the skyline. He said something unfolded out of stone. Not big. Just wrong where it should have been right. Shoulders under a hide that didn‚Äôt sit like a hide. A mouth that opened in the throat. No sound. A thought placed inside his head like a stamp pressed down hard:

You‚Äôre already carrying me.

He watched me to see if I‚Äôd laugh. I didn‚Äôt.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt get it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt have to follow anymore.‚Äù He pressed his palm to his chest like he was trying to stop a leak. ‚ÄúIt sits here.‚Äù

We set a cot. We zipped the tent and pinned the sliders with a safety pin the way we do when we really don‚Äôt want porcupines getting into someone‚Äôs snacks. We left him with water and a blanket.

Before dawn, he was gone.

No cut guyline. No torn mesh. Zipper still pinned through both sliders. No prints inside. Blanket damp like fog had been poured into it. On the canvas there was a darker body shape that wasn‚Äôt quite his shape. Under the cot: eight pebbles in two neat rows of four. He hadn‚Äôt had pockets to carry them in.

We searched. Wind wiped most sign. In places the ground was soft enough to hold small things. There we found lines where fingertips had dragged like a brush. Four marks. A pause. Four more. The spacing wrong for hands. The stride wrong for feet. Those marks ran upslope onto old, polished rock and ended where the rock ended. Not a place so much as a feeling: as if the hill had already made up its mind and didn‚Äôt need to show work.

We broke the meadow into a clock. Each of us took a slice to the timber. Twice I heard my name from the wrong place, in my voice. The radio coughed and returned the end of an hour-old call: ‚Äú‚Äîopy.‚Äù The second time it added ‚Äúcopy‚Äù before I said it, like I was late to my own sentence.

At dusk, fog came down off the ridge in a straight line and laid across camp like someone rolling carpet. The chow fly snapped once. The stove popped and then went quiet. The lantern hissed and kept hissing after we turned it down.

I checked the area around mess and found two things.

One: a coil of paracord half unwound and frayed as if worked by dull teeth or nails.

Two: wet handprints on the cooler lid. Not full palms‚Äîjust five cold ovals, spaced too wide. Bare. The marks went thirty steps into brush and quit like the ground forgot how to take impressions.

We raised the trail cams to nine feet, set the sensitivity up, turned off sound to save cards, then turned it back on because silence didn‚Äôt seem like a good plan. We doubled watch. Logged times.

Two nights later we lost a sawyer.

Walt stepped out to piss. He didn‚Äôt come back.

We found him strung in a dead snag like laundry. Chest hollowed. Jaw intact. Tongue gone. No drag marks. No spray where there should have been. The ground under him looked undisturbed except for what we disturbed by standing there trying to make our faces do the work our hands couldn‚Äôt.

We radioed the district and the sheriff. We didn‚Äôt say theories. We said location and what we could verify. They told us to shut it down, mark the approach closed, and we could come in the morning. It was not said like a question.

The cameras showed gray bars from 2:07 to 2:14 AM. Audio sounded like breath through a tube. Those seven minutes matched the gap between the time Walt left and when we realized he was gone. On the frame after, the thermal picked up a tall cold column just outside the sensor range.

Behind it, almost touching its wrong shadow, stood the river man.

Smiling too wide. Shoulder blades lifted under the skin like something had grown sideways.

We broke camp fast. No speeches. No guesses we‚Äôd have to explain in daylight. Packed and moved while the fog stood in the lanes looking like distance.

I stayed to collapse the last cache. Last person in the meadow. Quiet in that heavy way ground gets after people leave, when the shape of the noise we made still hangs there without us.

I opened the bear box because you open it when you leave. You check, then you latch it so the next person doesn‚Äôt think you were lazy.

He was inside.

Not hiding. Folded into the corner like he had seen someone else do it first. Both hands in his mouth to the knuckles. Working the webbing like he could pull a seam and let something through. Fingers chewed raw. Skin lifting around the nails.

His lips moved. No words. A tune taken apart and fed back in. He paused on the same bent note each time, like waiting for a second voice.

I didn‚Äôt move.

He looked up once.

The message didn‚Äôt come by sound. It arrived in the head-bone spaces: ear, teeth, the little shelves behind the nose where weather settles.

You don‚Äôt have to be outside anymore.

Then he wasn‚Äôt there.

No step. No zipper. No air shift. Just a box again. Metal. Wet hide smell. My breath didn‚Äôt fog. The metal under my hand felt warm for a moment and then remembered to be cold.

That night I scrubbed my hands and black silt came out from under each nail. Fine stuff. River slow. I hadn‚Äôt been in the river since morning.

Next day I pulled the hinge pin and let the lid drop because doing something felt safer than doing nothing. On the walk out, the trail had one extra bend. I‚Äôve hiked that drainage a dozen times. The bend was new to me and not to anyone else.

I wrote the report simple. Dates. Times. Weather. Who was on what task. I left out the line about hearing my name in my voice because it looks like a joke when you see it on paper. I left out the part where we counted eight pebbles in two rows because I couldn‚Äôt write a reason an adult would do that. I left out the smell in the bear box that wasn‚Äôt quite meat and wasn‚Äôt quite rot because it won‚Äôt print.

Since then, nights run different.

Around three‚Äîthe clock on the stove is wrong, so it might be two-fifty-eight or three-twelve, but it feels like three‚Äîit puts weight on the porch boards. Not a knock. Not steps. Just weight. The wood answers. Long. Low. It doesn‚Äôt try the knob. It stands and listens to the house list what hurts.

First time, I held my breath and counted. Twenty. Thirty. The boards kept talking. Air still moved in my chest when I stopped pulling it. The part that scared me came later, when I realized I had matched the slow rhythm without meaning to.

I leave the radio on low now. Static between stations. For three nights the static braided into a shape that wasn‚Äôt quite a tune and wasn‚Äôt wind either. My name sat in it. My voice, after I‚Äôd already stopped speaking. I turned the dial and found nothing but the same shape on other numbers.

The bathroom mirror fogs when the heat is off. Five long ovals track down the glass like someone reminding me how to count to a number that matters only to them. In the morning there‚Äôs grit under my nails and a thin mineral track under the window where wet air pooled.

Food goes down easier if it‚Äôs cold. Coffee too, once the steam is gone. Heat sounds loud now. I know that sentence doesn‚Äôt make sense unless you‚Äôve noticed it yourself. When I hold my hand near the kettle, it feels like I‚Äôm waving at someone who lives at a distance.

Neighbors‚Äô dog won‚Äôt come up my stairs. Hair up, mouth shut. He looks past me at nothing and backs into the truck with his nails skittering on the liner. His owner laughs like it‚Äôs a trick the dog learned from YouTube. The laugh stutters on itself for half a second and then snaps back into place. I don‚Äôt mention it. People hear what they‚Äôre looking for.

I tried packing to move. Books first. Then the box of things from fire seasons that makes you feel like your life fits in a bin: maps, a compass you trust more than your phone, a whistle that means ‚Äúcome to me now‚Äù because it‚Äôs the only command that matters. Tape came off the roll with that dry sticky sound and turned into a single bent note that lodged behind my nose. I set down the knife and realized I had dragged four parallel scratches into the cardboard. Four. Pause. Four. The same two rows as the pebbles.

The kitchen window is old and wavy. At night it shows the porch like a memory. Sometimes the glass shows height where there isn‚Äôt any outside. A hanging-coat shape with shoulders wrong. The inside of the glass fogs. I wipe a circle. For a breath the air tastes like snow. When the fog comes back there are five cold ovals in it. A hint of a sixth where no heel should land. I leave it. In the morning, white drip lines dry along the sill like chalk.

Pipes sing in the walls when the house cools. They always have, but now there‚Äôs a single note that holds until I answer it under my breath. It stops when I do. It starts again if I don‚Äôt notice fast enough. I tested this three nights in a row. I don‚Äôt recommend doing that.

I went back to the station once to sign off a box of Walt‚Äôs things for the district to deliver. I thought that was the right thing to do. The cardboard was new. It still had that dust that makes your hands feel like you‚Äôre wearing someone else‚Äôs skin. I signed what I had to sign. On the way out I looked at the dry board where someone had written NOTES in big letters and underlined it twice. No one had written anything under it. The room felt like it was waiting for someone to set a metronome.

Two rangers drove out with me the next week to pull the cams so they wouldn‚Äôt get snowed under. We had to log it. We had to show we‚Äôd done the work. We parked at the closure and hiked in on a cold day that didn‚Äôt look like weather but was. The fog sat lower than our mouths. The cameras came down easy. The cards went into a Pelican case because that‚Äôs what you do with things that have to arrive unchanged.

On the way back we passed the place where the fingertip marks had run out. I didn‚Äôt point. The rangers didn‚Äôt ask. We all stared at the ground like there was something there to be found and didn‚Äôt find it. The trail felt shorter in, longer out. The Pelican case knocked my hip every third step. The cadence synced with my breath even though I tried to make it not.

I sleep worse at home now and somehow wake up with more energy than I should have. I don‚Äôt like how that sentence reads. I don‚Äôt like saying it out loud. People think you‚Äôre bragging when you say you need less sleep. I‚Äôm not.

My mouth is dry in the morning like I‚Äôve been talking all night without words. The inside of my cheeks have small raw places where teeth have pressed. I keep biting my tongue gently, checking it‚Äôs still there. It is. I know that‚Äôs not the part that matters.

Once, around three, I thought I heard the hinge in the bear box. I live a long way from that box. Sound travels stupid in mountains, but it doesn‚Äôt travel through memory. I stood up anyway and went to the window. The porch boards had that slight bow I can spot now. Not a person‚Äôs bow. Weight more spread out than feet. The porch jittered in the glass like heat coming off a road.

I left the house one night and walked the lane to the stop sign and back to hear how gravel sounds when you aren‚Äôt trying to be quiet. It rained a little. The rain made its own timing. I matched it without thinking and stopped when I noticed. I stood still a long time in the drizzle wondering whether stillness is even my decision anymore.

Every once in a while the fridge motor stops and I can hear my own swallow. There‚Äôs a hitch in it now. I listen too closely and hear some other swallow answer in the same room, just not in air.

I haven‚Äôt seen the river man again. Not standing where people stand. But the few pictures I still have from that spike on my phone‚Äînot the cams, the casual pictures‚Äîsometimes flicker when I open them. The flicker is small. A change in the grain. I screen-recorded it to see if it would catch. It didn‚Äôt. The screen recording plays normal. The phone knows what to ignore.

I leave one light on at night because it makes the rest of the dark pick a side. The bulb hums if I listen. I try not to listen. It‚Äôs the only advice I can write down that looks like a thing a person would say. Don‚Äôt listen. Keep your hands busy. Keep your mouth empty. Heat your food or don‚Äôt; picking is the trap. Drink water. If you hear your name, ignore it, even if it sounds like you. Especially then.

I don‚Äôt keep the whistle on a hook anymore. It‚Äôs in a drawer. When I opened the drawer last week, the air in there felt cold in a way that hurt my teeth, and the whistle had a film on it like it had been breathed on and left shut.

I went to the lake on a map one day and stared at the contour lines until they blurred. The bowl has a name you can find if you want to walk long enough. I‚Äôm not writing it. Maps are only helpful until they aren‚Äôt.

You can tell yourself this is stress. You can tell yourself losing someone you shared meals with puts sounds in your head that don‚Äôt belong there. Both are true. Both are useful. You can make coffee at midnight and hold the mug with two hands and blow on it like it keeps you in the category you‚Äôve always been in: person, alone, house, inside the weather, not the other way around.

There‚Äôs a section of porch rail I keep sanding smooth and it never stays that way. Every week or so it‚Äôs rough again in a pattern that looks like an elbow leaned there too long. I haven‚Äôt leaned there. I don‚Äôt let anyone else onto the porch. The rail remembers anyway.

I changed the screws in the door strike so they bite deeper into the stud. I installed a deadbolt you can turn without a key because you should be able to lock and unlock something without asking permission. These are human solutions and they matter for human problems. They help until they don‚Äôt.

I thought about leaving a plate of food once. Cold meat, because that‚Äôs what it seems to like. I didn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs a line I can keep. It‚Äôs a small line, but small lines count when the big ones feel like they belong to a different job.

When I get out of bed at night and put my feet on the floor, the boards talk back. They always have. Now they say more than I want to know. The timing the house keeps on its own matches what waits outside. I have stopped standing exactly on the seams.

I still don‚Äôt know what to do with the sentence he gave me: you don‚Äôt have to be outside anymore. It reads like comfort. It is not. It‚Äôs a trade. Outside wears your clothes for a while. Inside learns to wait.

At three, the boards take weight again. No knock. No voice. Just the house answering and the slow count that happens whether I decide to count or not.

It does not ask to be let in.

It waits until my breathing matches.

And I hold still long enough to hear that it already has.",1,1761613543.0,TheDarkArchive,0,1.0,False

1ohw7rs,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ohw7rs,Five Years as Your Secret Lover? Fine. Your Rival's Ring Looks PERFECT on Me!.,"Five years as Nathan Pierce's secret, and I was finally ready to leave.


That night changed everything.


Right in the heat of the moment, just as we were about to climax, he casually dropped: ""Jade, I'm getting married.""


My 30th birthday was in five days‚Äîthe day Nathan had promised he'd marry me.


My heart literally stopped. Finally! I thought this was him keeping his promise: ""Nathan, I've been waiting for‚Äî""


""Isabella's back from London. She's pregnant."" he cut me off, his voice still breathless from what we'd just done. ""Tonight's our last time.""


The smile froze on my face instantly.


I stared at my reflection in the mirror‚Äîpale as death, like all the blood in my body had turned to ice.


Even though he'd just brought me to the heights of ecstasy, now my heart felt nothing but cold emptiness.


Afterward, he acted like nothing happened, methodically buttoning his white shirt.


I kept my head down, pulling on my stockings with trembling hands: ""Nathan... are you forgetting something?""


He didn't even look up, voice flat: ""I promised you twenty percent of company shares once we stabilized. Don't worry‚ÄîI'll have legal draft the paperwork tomorrow.""


My hands froze mid-motion. My eyes filled with tears I couldn't control.


So he really had forgotten everything he'd ever said to me.


Had he never actually planned to marry me?


""Shares?"" I laughed bitterly, voice breaking. ""Nathan, these five years I've been with you‚Äîis that all I'm worth? Twenty percent?""


He finally turned to look at me, still buttoning his shirt: ""What else? Jade, you know what the company's worth now. You should be grateful.""


Looking at that face that once made my heart race, now it just felt like staring at a stranger.


""Nathan, what have I meant to you all these years‚Äî""


His phone buzzed before I could finish.


Seeing the name on screen, Nathan's voice instantly went soft as honey: ""What's wrong, baby?""


Isabella's sweet voice drifted through the speaker: ""Nathan, why aren't you home yet? The baby and I are getting hungry. I want you to cook for us.""


""Of course, I'll be right there. Wait for me.""


He hung up, grabbed his jacket, and walked out. Didn't even pause as he passed me.


Watching him rush away, my heart felt like someone was squeezing it in a fist. I couldn't breathe.


Five years ago, Nathan's white moonlight Isabella had dumped his useless ass and jetted off to London to find her happiness.


Nathan fell apart completely‚Äîgetting wasted at dive bars, starting fights, coming home beaten bloody.


I was the one who found him on my way home from work, took him in, and nursed him back to health bit by bit.


Later, we fell for each other and made it official.


When the company was just starting out, Nathan had hustle during negotiations but didn't know jack about anything else.


All the tedious document sorting, process coordination‚ÄîI taught myself everything from scratch to make it work.


The day he blew our first major deal, all he did was hide in the stairwell chain-smoking.


I pulled three all-nighters, showed up at the client's office with a new proposal, and literally stole the contract back from our competitors.


Even the core team members he relies on now‚ÄîI was the one who talked them into staying when they wanted to quit.


These past years, I've worn the ""secretary"" title while secretly analyzing real estate markets, avoiding risks, quietly securing properties he can't even count.


Industry headhunters never stopped trying to poach me, each offer more tempting than the last. But I never even hesitated.


Because Nathan once held my hands and said: ""Jade, I really can't live without you. Once I get established, I swear I'll give you the wedding of your dreams on your 30th birthday.""


People at the office gossiped about us constantly. It's not like I never wanted to go public.


But every time I brought it up, he'd frown and brush me off: ""Jade, the company's still growing. I don't want everyone knowing about us yet. I promise you‚Äîwhen you turn thirty, I'll marry you. I'll make you the most envied Mrs. Pierce in the city!""


One sentence. I believed it for five whole years.


I stood by him from cramped studio apartments to corner offices, from nobody to industry success.


I always believed that at thirty, I'd get that fairy-tale wedding he promised.


But his white moonlight came back, and he dove headfirst into her arms without hesitation‚Äîeven got her pregnant.


He threw away every promise he'd made me like garbage.


Fine. Then I didn't need to waste another second on him either.


Reality check time. I dialed Mr. Stone's number: ""Mr. Stone, this is Jade Rivers. I accept your job offer.""


""Excellent news. When can you start?""


I used to joke with Nathan: ""If you don't marry me by thirty, I'm leaving. I'll go work for your biggest competitor. Don't say I didn't warn you!""


He'd pull me close and swear: ""I'll never let you leave me, Jade. Without you, I'm dead. The company's dead too.""


I hung up and wiped away my last tear.


Nathan Pierce, go marry your precious white moonlight. I won't stop you.


In five days you'll be saying ""I do,"" and I'll be saying ""I quit.""


We're done.


Chapter 2


Next morning, I walked into Pierce Holdings to submit my resignation letter.


The second I stepped off the elevator, chaos hit me like a wall of sound.


Isabella Hayes, stood in the center of the office wearing a pink sundress, surrounded by a crowd of ass-kissers.


""Everyone's been working so hard! These are homemade pastries I brought to show my appreciation. Please, try some!""


Her voice was honey-sweet, that practiced smile never wavering. ""I'd really appreciate your support going forward!""


""Mrs. Pierce, you're too kind!""


""Mr. Pierce is so lucky to have a wife like you!""


""Five years long-distance with Mr. Pierce‚Äîthat's true love! Congratulations on finally being together!""


Seeing this, I wanted to laugh at the irony.


Five years long-distance? Come on, I was the one who'd been by Nathan's side this whole time!


Without me, Isabella probably never would've made it to the Mrs. Pierce throne.


I tried to slip past the lovefest and head straight to Nathan's office, but her cold voice stopped me dead.


""So you're Secretary Rivers?""


Isabella approached me, eyes scanning me like I was something she'd scraped off her shoe. ""Nathan mentions you all the time. Says you're very... helpful around here.""


I forced a smile. ""Thank you, Ms. Hayes.""


""Ms. Hayes? Everyone calls me Mrs. Pierce. You're calling me Ms. Hayes?""


She laughed coldly. ""I heard some interesting things‚Äîapparently you don't see yourself as an employee here, but as the boss's wife. Is that right?""


I could feel the trap closing around me.


""Those are just rumors. I hope Mrs. Pierce won't misunderstand.""


""Good. I'm a little thirsty‚Äîcould you make me some coffee? Hand-brewed, please.""


As soon as she said this, the employees around her lowered their heads and began to whisper.


Everyone knew that despite my secretary title, I never did menial tasks.


Nathan had always protected me from that stuff. I never had to move files, let alone serve coffee.


""Mrs. Pierce, you're pregnant‚Äîcoffee really isn't good for the baby,"" I said calmly. ""I'm Mr. Pierce's secretary. I handle business affairs, not coffee service‚Äî""


""Shut up! Who do you think you are to lecture me?""


SLAP!


Isabella's palm connected with my face so hard my right cheek went numb instantly.


I stood there stunned. Just as I raised my hand to hit back‚Äî


""Jade, what the hell are you doing?""


Nathan's voice.


His fingers wrapped around my wrist like a vise, face dark as a storm cloud.


""Didn't you see? She hit me!""


""Nathan, your secretary was bullying me first! I just wanted her to make me coffee, but she refused and said I had no right to ask her to do these things. All your employees saw it‚ÄîI was just upset!""


Nathan's eyes swept over the staff, who immediately nodded like bobbleheads.


""That's right, Secretary Rivers refused and told Mrs. Pierce to find someone else.""


""Jade, how dare you!""


Nathan shoved me backward hard. I couldn't keep my balance and hit the floor.


My knee scraped raw against the ground, it really hurts!


But Nathan didn't spare me a single glance. Instead, he crouched down to comfort Isabella.


""Baby, don't be upset. You're pregnant‚Äîgetting angry isn't good for you or the baby. My secretary was out of line. I'll discipline her for you.""


Then he looked up at me, eyes cold as ice.


""One slap wasn't enough. Isabella, hit her again.""


""Nathan, what are you saying?""


My brain went blank. What was he saying? He wanted Isabella to slap me AGAIN?


""It's okay, Nathan. I was just angry. You said Secretary Rivers really helps you‚ÄîI wouldn't want to offend her...""


Before Isabella could finish her fake protest, Nathan grabbed her hand. ""Don't be afraid. I'll show you how to do it properly. Focus the force in your palm, strike clean and fast!""


SLAP!


The slap echoed through the office like a gunshot. Before I could even process it, I was on the floor again.


Chapter 3


The burning pain spread through my nerves like fire. I bit down hard on my lip and slowly dragged myself up from the floor.


Before I could even steady myself, Nathan's voice cut through the air: ""Harder. This is how you teach someone a lesson‚Äîmake sure she knows who's really in charge!""


The second slap hit even harder than the first.


Blood immediately trickled from the corner of my mouth, the metallic taste flooding my senses.


The third slap snapped my head to the side, hair flying everywhere. I must have looked completely pathetic.


""Perfect! See how it's done? Isabella, remember‚Äînever let anyone push you around!""


After the beating, Nathan looked at Isabella with pure satisfaction, voice dripping with affection: ""In this company, it's just you and me at the top. If Jade doesn't obey you, this is exactly how you handle it. I've got your back‚Äîdon't be afraid!""


""I know, Nathan. Sorry for causing such a scene on my first day. Everyone's staring now. Let's go to your office‚ÄîI'm exhausted, and so is the baby.""


Isabella pouted prettily as Nathan helped her toward his office.


""Jade, make fresh coffee and bring it in. If you don't listen to Isabella again, this is what happens. I've been too soft on you all these years‚Äîmade you forget your place, didn't I?""


The office door slammed shut with a bang. I stood there, numb to the physical pain.


Because the pain in my body was nothing compared to the agony in my chest.


Five years of promises had just turned to ash in a single moment.


All the hardships I'd endured with him, the sleepless nights, the sacrifices‚Äîit was all a fucking joke.


""Oh my God, what's gotten into Mr. Pierce? He never treated Secretary Rivers like this before.""


""I know, right? So brutal. Honestly, I always thought he and Secretary Rivers were a couple! Never saw this coming.""


""Guess we really can't fantasize about the boss. Someone like him would never notice ordinary girls like us anyway.""


The other employees whispered and pointed at me like I was some kind of spectacle. I ignored them all, wiped the blood from my mouth, and headed to the break room to make coffee.


""Mrs. Pierce, your coffee.""


I placed the cup on her desk. Isabella lifted it to her lips and immediately winced.


""It's scalding! Secretary Rivers, are you doing this on purpose? Getting revenge for me slapping you?""


""I'll make another one.""


I brought her a fresh cup. This time Isabella barely touched it before setting it down.


""Now it's too cold. No sincerity at all! Secretary Rivers, I know you're upset about earlier, but that was your boss's orders. As his personal secretary, you can't even make proper coffee?""


Before the words were fully out of her mouth, Nathan suddenly grabbed the coffee cup and hurled it directly at me.


""Jade, can't you handle one simple task?""


I dodged just in time, watching the cup shatter against the wall in an explosion of glass and coffee.


Fragments and hot liquid splattered across my clothes and legs. A shard sliced into my calf, bright red blood immediately welling up.


It hurt like hell.


I took a deep breath and said quietly: ""I'll make Mrs. Pierce another cup.""


It took until the fifth cup before Isabella was finally satisfied.


Back at my desk, I looked down at the resignation letter I still hadn't turned in and laughed softly to myself.


Turns out, leaving Nathan Pierce was definitely the smartest decision I'd ever made.

I wanted to share my experience with the ‚Äúsweeps casino‚Äù side hustle that‚Äôs been circulating online lately, specifically from the perspective of a Canadian.

There are far fewer sweepstakes-style casinos available to Canadians compared to Americans, which made the setup a bit trickier. Still, after going through the hassle of getting everything figured out, it‚Äôs been worth it.

I‚Äôve been doing this for a few months now, and I‚Äôve made a couple thousand dollars in total. It‚Äôs not life-changing money, but it‚Äôs a solid, low-effort side hustle that fits nicely into my routine. I usually just collect the daily free tokens while having my morning coffee. It takes maybe five minutes. Then, once or twice a month on a Friday night, I‚Äôll play through those free tokens and try to convert them into redeemable tokens.

The nice thing is that there‚Äôs no real ‚Äúbuy-in‚Äù required if you‚Äôre patient. It‚Äôs all about consistency ‚Äî collecting your daily bonuses, playing smart, and cashing out when you hit something worthwhile.

If anyone else here is doing this from Canada, I‚Äôd be curious to hear which sites you‚Äôve had success with or how your experience compares. I can also share a few of the ones I‚Äôve found that actually work here.",1,1761613478.0,MakeMoney,3,1.0,False

Much in the same way you might sacrifice a steak in order to escape a bear with your own meat in tact, I have roped off the pool, workout, and party rooms on hockey weekends. The parents spend their time within; neglecting their offspring, reminiscing on when they were relevant, and slowly pickling their organs. They congregate their coolers, bring food and drink and changes of attire, they spend hours sweating into our cabana chairs. All of this to say, they claim this land in the name of Douchery, and become entirely too comfortable. Largely, in this way, the damage is inflicted solely on one area, and can be more easily recovered once the affliction subsides. 

Unfortunately, I never thought that passively permitting this mistaken sense of ownership would lead to butts. 

Cue me, sitting haplessly in my office, scratching at this and that paperwork, while occasionally sparing a glance to the security monitor. There is not an inch of public area that is not covered by my spying digital ear and eye, and I pay especially close attention when the heathens are underfoot. After recovering from a particularly rewarding stretch after a particularly perplexing invoice, my weary eye travels back to the screen. I freeze, as on my screen, is a veritable sea of butts. I take a series of deep breaths with my eyes closed, and am profoundly disappointed that the landscape has not changed once I am done. 

The hockey wives. A gaggle of them have turned the workout room into a changing room. They face the walls while they shed their swimsuits, lest the other shrieking suburban harpies get an eyeful, and have thus exposed my unwilling eyes to a tableau of cheeks. I sigh, rub my temples, and decide that it is time to go home. 

The morning sun slips between the blinds and lands upon a missive, newly posted upon the wall in the workout room. A reminder, or perhaps a conveyance of brand new information, that nudity is prohibited in this area. I slide my finger smartly across the tape, affixing the notice at eye level, mere feet below the obvious camera lurking above. I can only hope that sobriety prevails long enough for my notice (and my digital eye) to be perceived by any would-be nudists. 

Good luck to you, my fellow hoteliers, when the plague comes a‚Äôvisiting your town. May the Innkeepers of Days Gone By bless you with a short season, strong coffee, and a workout room free of butts.

- Descale message - kept continuing after multiple descales - factory reset got rid of this one 

- Add water message - would go away after every 5-6 brew attempts 

- Reached out to Fellow - was told to flush, clean shower head (was already clean, but did it again). Flush failed multiple times at 3.3-3.7 ml/s 

- Add water message continues so I reached back out on my open ticket - no response

- today - got it to brew twice at 3 cup single pour and it overflowed the coffee mugs (same mugs my wife and I use daily) and it tasted like water

Fellow will not respond to any of my follow up emails

Any advice on how to get help? I can‚Äôt get a hold of anyone on their ‚Äúlive chat‚Äù. 

Just really frustrated with this.

1ohw6af,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1ohw6af/what_would_heaven_look_like_for_you/,What would heaven look like for you?,"Hi all,

As a Christian, I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about heaven lately‚Äîespecially with all the hell that seems to swirl around us these days.

But when I close my eyes, heaven doesn‚Äôt look like gold streets or marble gates. For me, it looks like autumn in a city‚ÄîNew York, maybe Philadelphia. The air crisp, the trees blazing with color.

I‚Äôd walk into a small, quiet coffee shop. The kind tucked between two old buildings, where the barista knows your name without asking. And at the very back table, there He‚Äôd be‚ÄîChrist.

Not radiant or glowing. Just a man. Handsome, kind, and human in the best way. He‚Äôd smile, take my hand, and say, ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôve been waiting for you. I love you‚Äîjust as you are.‚Äù

We‚Äôd sit and drink coffee. We‚Äôd talk and laugh. Then we‚Äôd wander through the city streets, the leaves shimmering in colors I‚Äôd never seen before, the birds singing melodies that don‚Äôt exist on Earth.

As the sun began to sink behind the skyline, He‚Äôd turn to me and say, ‚ÄúCome on. I want to take you to my Father‚Äôs house.‚Äù

We‚Äôd walk up to a cozy brownstone. The door would open, and there He‚Äôd be‚ÄîGod Himself. A presence so big and warm it could hold the whole world. He‚Äôd pull me into His arms and whisper, ‚ÄúWelcome home. It‚Äôs okay now. You‚Äôre home.‚Äù

Mary and Joseph would be there too‚Äîdivine step-parents, smiling, setting the table. We‚Äôd sit together, share a meal, and talk as though we‚Äôd known each other forever.

And in that moment, I‚Äôd finally understand joy. Love. Peace. No questions. No fear. No need to prove or perform. Just belonging. Just being. Maybe that‚Äôs where it starts, my heaven‚Äîand maybe that‚Äôs all it is (at least in my version).

So I wonder‚Ä¶ what would¬†*heaven*¬†look like for you? What would you want God to say? What would you hope to feel‚Äîif anything at all?
