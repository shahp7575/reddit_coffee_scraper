Lisbon, 1763.
The sea was grey, tense like a blade, and on the beach of Belém the wind dragged abandoned shells and ropes.
Elías Duarte, twenty-two years old, was returning from the port when he saw something shining in the sand: a bottle, encrusted with salt, closed with a wax stopper.
Inside, a folded and yellowed sheet of paper.

> “If this message reaches you, come and visit me here,
where the sun rises from sand and wheat.”

There was no name, there was no signature. Just that phrase, like a voice coming from another world.
From that night, Elías stopped sleeping.
Every time he looked at the ocean, he felt that there, somewhere beyond the horizon, someone was really waiting for him.


In January 1764 he boarded a ship bound for the New World.
The sea broke him and shaped him. Storms tore sails, fever took men away every week.
Elías learned to survive by chewing on silence.
He didn't know the languages ​​that surrounded him: his Portuguese was confused with Spanish, with African, with the sailors' dialect.
But he repeated the phrase of the letter like a rosary:

> “Where the sun comes from sand and wheat…”

After months, he landed in Cartagena de Indias, a lively and ruthless port.
Then he continued overland to the south, between plantations and deserts.
Until, on a day of sharp light, he saw a village appear lying between golden fields and sand dunes.
San Miguel del Oro.

The village was poor and barren, but full of life.
Elías entered an inn to ask for a drink.
Behind the counter, a young woman stared at him curiously.
Chocolate brown skin, coffee brown eyes, deep and warm like the sunset.
Her black hair reflected the light like silk.

He was pale, worn from travel, with light green eyes, as clear as sea glass.
They looked at each other in silence, and something passed between them, invisible but very strong.

Elías couldn't speak a word of Spanish, she didn't know Portuguese.
So, in the first days, they spoke to each other with gestures, with smiles, with drawings in the sand.
It was she, Isabel Vargas, who taught him the first words, one at a time, written on a piece of paper:
“agua”, “pan”, “sol”, “vida”.
He answered her in Portuguese, in a shy voice, and she laughed at his accent.

When Elías showed her the letter, time stopped.
Isabel recognized her immediately. It was his handwriting.
She had written it as a girl, and thrown into the sea like an impossible dream.
She never imagined that, years later, an unknown man would find her — and travel across the world to look for her.

Months passed.
Elías found work as a carpenter, rebuilding doors, carts and beams for the village houses.
Everyone called him el carpintero blanco — the pale carpenter with jade eyes.
Isabel helped him to translate, to make himself understood, to live among people.

One evening, during a party, they danced together for the first time.
The sky was red with torches, the wind carried the smell of roasting corn.
She took his hand.
He trembled like a boy, even though he had already known the sea.

From that day on they were inseparable.
Isabel taught him to read and write Spanish, he taught her the Portuguese songs he had learned in Porto.
And in the small house they built together on the edge of the village, time began to breathe slowly.

In 1770, Lucía, their first daughter, was born.
He had golden skin, like the earth after the rain, and honey-colored eyes.
Elías worked in the fields, Isabel taught the village children to read.

The years flowed like rivers.
The seasons repeated themselves, but each harvest had a different flavor, each sunset a new color.
Sometimes they argued, out of jealousy, out of fear, out of tiredness.
But then they went back to looking for each other like two rivers that find each other after a storm.

He never stopped calling her mi sol de arena,
and she, smiling, called him meu mar perdido.

Difficult times arrived.
Revolts against settlers erupted throughout the region.
San Miguel del Oro was burned twice; the Spanish troops took away the crops, the men were forcibly conscripted.
Elías risked his life defending the village.
For months he slept outdoors, among the burnt wheat and black sand, just to protect the house and Isabel.

When it was all over, the two had changed.
They had lost much — friends, lands, peace — but they had never left each other.
The pain had united them more than before.

The years became calmer.
Lucía grew up, got married and left for Bogotá.
Elías and Isabel remained alone, but they never felt loneliness as a condemnation: it was simply another form of living together.

Every morning he got up before the sun, made coffee and left it on the table for her.
Every evening she waited for him with a lit candle.
They spoke little, but one look was enough to say everything.

They grew old like this, among the hills and the warm wind.
Isabel began to walk more slowly, Elías began to see less.
But neither of them was afraid.
They had gone through everything: seas, revolts, storms, bereavements.
Yet, every time he looked at her, he still saw that girl from the inn, with coffee-colored eyes and skin that smelled of the sun.

In the summer of 1801 Isabel fell ill.
His breathing became short, his hands cold.
Elías never left her alone.
He read her letters to her, told her about when he found the bottle, how he never stopped believing in it.

> “Do you remember?” she whispered. “I wrote to you without knowing who you were.”
“And I sailed halfway around the world to get to you,” he replied.

One morning, at dawn, as the light entered through the window and colored the sand and wheat, Isabel closed her eyes.
He still had Elías's hand clasped in his.

He stared at her for hours.
He didn't cry. He only smiled slowly, as one does when faced with something one understands too late: that love, real love, never ends, it transforms into breath, into wind, into memory.

He buried her under a jacaranda tree, where the wind carried the smell of the sea.
Then he lived a few more months, alone, sitting every day near his grave.
It is said that he died watching the sunset, with the bottle in his hands.

Today, in the plains of northern Colombia, there is still a small village called San Miguel del Oro.
People tell the legend of the white carpenter and the woman with coffee-colored eyes, who loved each other for forty years, defying the sea, time and death.

And when dawn lights up over the wheat, the wind seems to carry two distant voices:
one in Spanish, one in Portuguese,
which are called piano, like a prayer that never stops being heard.",1,1761927216.0,writing,1,0.67,False

1okyphv,https://www.reddit.com/r/beckamonjeziclark/comments/1okyphv/recap_of_the_paris_trip/,Recap of the Paris Trip,"I've seen a bunch of mentions recently about the disastrous trip to Paris, and it came to my attention that many of you werent aware of what went down there. Well..let me enlighten you! Take a seat and buckle up lol. The TL;DR - She started the trip [screaming in the metro station](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11JgIwfxbys&list=PLaaKN1kaYvirlGIaJkuFBg5V-z3gg3Kly&index=27) like an asshole (seriously she embodied the entirety of why Americans get a bad rap overseas in just this video) and proceeded to act like an entitled narcissistic asshole the entire trip. It got so bad that by day 3 in Paris, the group split up. Some of them went and got their own hotel and left the Air B&B, and others flat out said ""F this. Im out"" and left Paris altogether. One of the ones who left Paris had booked and paid for Zecky's trip, so she went ahead and cancelled her flight home, leaving her there stranded. She pretended to be sick, saying thats why she had to stay behind and get a new hotel, but some of the former friends came and told all. Everyone who left is still no contact with her, regardless of any times she has said ""no we still talk!"" They do not.

Here's the timeline:



9/21 Leaving Texas around 6pm✅ (Made it to her plane on time with an entire carry on of snacks, and threw a fit that she didnt get upgraded and that someone else in her group who actually paid for their flight DID get upgraded didnt give her their seat) Ate beef jerky and talked into her phone loudly on the plane while everyone else was trying to sleep.



9/22 First Day - River cruise & dinner ❌ (Yelled at/\[shamed her friends in public metro\](https://youtu.be/11JgIwfxbys?si=OlKsjNDcYk-qzGMb) in Paris (including putting a target on Carissa's back for being the rich friend), gave a tutorial of her fave Buckee's beef jerkies and snacks, ate McDonald’s, and took a nap. Radio silence from Becka after her nap; intel from her friends' pages show they left her in the Air B&B and had what looks like a cute time without her.)



9/23 Louvre (Loo-ve) and lunch ❓ (The girls headed to the Louvre without Bex (again) to make their ticket time. She followed behind later and stopped to take pictures of cafés and get coffee at a Starbucks. Goes to dinner with the girls, and clomps around a grocery store looking for Cokes and Snickers like it's a Buckees. Is confused and amazed that Spanish speaking people exist in France. Drinks a McDonald's coffee in front of the Eiffel Tower and screams at her friends more. Stays in that night to take selfies in bed because her feet hurt and her friends go out drinking.



9/24 Birthday Brunch ✅ (Wakes up screeching ""IT'S MY BIRTHDAY BITCHES!"" to a table decorated with flowers she bought herself. Puts a shameless cash app QR code in her stories asking for money. Dresses in Pilgrim cosplay, and her friends admit they have to lie to her about reservation times to get her out of the house on time. Brunch with friends, then her friends all went out shopping while she stayed in bed naked and updated the website to a scammy 69% + 1% off. Friends came home to show her their purchases and she filmed them laughing while they were like ""you're still nekkid, nipples hard and everything."" Turns out nobody else was amused.

Went out in a sausage casing dress, tries to create a “backstory” for her friends outfits and they were not having it.  Clomps through the beautiful cobblestone streets of Paris, blabbering into her phone about the beauty instead of enjoying it. Dinner at Buddha Bar, then silence until Sunday mid-afternoon. This is the event when the drama/split went down. We got confirmation of that after the fact. She was acting like an entitled asshole the entire time and embarrassing everyone. Screeching about things not being good enough. They werent doing enough for her because this was HER birthday trip and they should feel lucky they were invited (even though they paid...for themselves and for her). Made them almost lose their reso...it was bad



9/25 - no more sightings of over half the trip participants. Versailles & Greek dinner/night club ❌ (Carissa actually suggests getting a French coffee, but Becka demands her Pumpkin Spice Latte from, you guessed it, Starbucks.  Becca, Carissa, and Sarah head out on a “hop-on/hop-off” bus with Becca covered in shmutz and lint, visit various gift shops and head to the Eiffel Tower.  The other three women are noticeably missing.  Becka loudly ponders, “Should I move to Paris?!”  As the rain rolls in, Becka buys a hoodie to wear under her jacket and yet still hides under Carissa’s rented jacket while simultaneously shaming her for it.  Very disjointed stories about an Eiffel Tower shaped cheese grater - apparently grating your own cheese means you’re really on top? Please remember this day!



9/26 Lunch @ Pink Mamma, Moulin Rouge @ night 👀 \\\[Technically both these events happened, but not as originally planned so…\\\] (Becka and Carissa go on a solo excursion to a cafe that isn’t a Starbucks (finally) and attempt to go shopping for some XL vintage (the shopkeeper shot our size small diva down real quick).  Vanessa’s stories show her and Linese shopping at non-vintage shops and having lunch, before one of Vanessa getting a tattoo. More Boring Becca stories of shopping and lots of random memes/pictures of text.  She over-dresses in a sequined prom dress to visit the Moulin Rouge, and spends 30 minutes talking about what to wear and expect rather than heading out.  It would appear that only Becka, Carissa, and Sarah attended the Moulin Rouge.)



9/27 Last Day  (Wake up to silence from Becka, but a few stories from Vanessa that show she was staying at a different apartment than Becka and V & Linese left early. \[Vanessa also posted a few very pointed stories\](https://imgur.com/fIN5CiI) and it doesn’t take a genius to figure out who \[she’s talking about\](https://imgur.com/a/zbIYGXb).  It would appear that \[Jenna is back in TX already, and is also on Vanessa's side\](https://i.redd.it/q9mvopxb6jq91.jpeg?app\_web\_view=ios) of whatever went down.  Becks wakes up posting the same old stories and tiktok reposts about men ruining her life. Visits a touristy mall in Paris and passive-aggressively comments to someone in the background “I told you we should come here…what? Oh, I was too occupied?  But now I’m good.” \[Passive-aggressive grid posts would indicate otherwise\](https://imgur.com/a/o8acnxO). Proclaims everything in the country is gorgeous even though she’s only shown us Starbucks, pharmacies, Italian restaurants and her dirty Airbnb.  Apparently \[Brittany flew in to surprise her\](https://imgur.com/a/mz0cDCv) even though we all already knew she would be there but arriving late.)



Paris playlist here \[https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaaKN1kaYvirlGIaJkuFBg5V-z3gg3Kly&si=LRGZBPMpmpRjrQjO\](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaaKN1kaYvirlGIaJkuFBg5V-z3gg3Kly&si=LRGZBPMpmpRjrQjO)

I recently created this visual guide called **Ratiology**, which maps espresso-based drinks by their ratio, texture, and taste, all based on an 18g dose.

I made this with my **little to no experience in coffee science**, using **ChatGPT’s help** for the ratios, layout, and wording. My goal was to understand how every small ratio change affects the flavor, body, and crema in espresso drinks.

I’d really appreciate your thoughts and feedback:

* Are the ratios and taste notes accurate?
* Anything important missing? (maybe some iced versions or unique drinks?)
* How’s the layout and clarity overall?

I’m open to all suggestions; from baristas, designers, and coffee nerds alike.

I met a guy online, he lives nearby, we had great conversation, texted all week, planned a coffee date, but he had to cancel because of work.(A tell, probably.) Next day he was most apologetic, but  didn't set a new date. Later that day he asked for a selfie. I replied that I'd prefer to wait until we meet each other, there are plenty of pictures of me on the dating site, and if he wants to see if I'm real, we can do a video chat. So he stopped responding. I told him right out of the gate that I was tired of people who just want a pen pal and won't meet in person. Then I reminded him again after the canceled date and his apology; he said he did recall that I said that. So then he turns out the exact same.

Darian had worked for weeks to pull it off; he’d been doing it quietly and secretly (although he had mentioned planning a social event of some sort to his cabin). The son of Aphrodite had been working around the clock alongside a team of volunteer nymphs and satyrs to achieve this, and they had an early start beginning at 4am.

The Dining Pavilion had become the beating heart of the celebration. Strings of pumpkin-shaped lanterns hung between the marble columns, glowing in warm oranges and ghostly blues. The gods’ tables were draped in black velvet and cobweb patterns that were covered in glitter, causing them to twinkle like the early evening stars above. Plates piled high with treats appeared and refilled themselves, candied and toffee apples, chocolate golden coins decorated to look like drachma, and pastries filled with random flavoured creams shaped like tiny skulls, flavours included chilli, coffee, toffee, vanilla, chocolate, broccoli, and pumpkin spice. A true trick or treat! The usual empty goblets were on standby for those who wanted to choose their drink of choice.

Nearby, the Arts & Crafts Cabin had turned into a creative hub. Tables covered in glitter, bone-white paint, and sculpting clay. A sign read:

*Pumpkin Decorating Contest - Winner as judged by Lady A wins a bucket of candy for them and their cabin.*

There were pumpkins of all sorts of shapes, sizes, and colours available for people to test their carving skills. People could try for a smaller pumpkin or team up to make bigger designs with larger pumpkins. It was truly up to them as to what they would or could do.

Not wanting to waste the carved out pumpkins, a second contest had been organised next to it with a sign that read:

*Pumpkin Pie Contest - Winner as judged by Chiron wins a bucket of candy for them and their cabin.*

The ingredients needed to make pumpkin pie were assembled, along with the pizza oven, which was going to serve as the way for people to cook their pie. Thankfully, given the pumpkin carving happening next door, there wouldn’t be a lack of pumpkins to be turned into pie.

Down by the Beach, the mood shifted. The waves glowed with bioluminescent magic, thanks to a very kind nymph that Darian was able to sweet-talk. Pale blue light pulsing each time the waves crashed lightly on the shore. A bonfire blazed high, surrounded by hay bales and cozy blankets. A satyr strummed a guitar while another played the panpipes. Another small group of Satyrs was on standby at a marshmallow roasting station to hand out marshmallows on sticks for those who wanted to partake. A “Costume Catwalk” had been set up near the surf for those who had costumes to show off, along with a face painting station available for those without a costume but still wanted to feel like they were dressing up.

But the real attraction, the nymphs and satyrs whispered about, was the Scare Maze.
Darian had carved it through a safe patch of the woods starting at the strawberry fields and it had become something legendary, at least in the son of Aphrodite’s opinion. Mist hugged the ground. Whispering voices drifted between the trees (half young satyrs, half bored nymphs in masks). There were moving shadows, glowing footprints, and enchanted pumpkins that chased anyone who lingered too long. The rules were simple: get to the end, enjoy yourself, and be given a goodie bag filled with candy and glowsticks as a reward. Was it scary? No. It was spooky, and that was the point of it, something that everyone could enjoy and not sit out of.

By the pavilion, Darian adjusted one of the fake skeletons and grinned to himself. Everything was running smoothly. No fights, no loose harpies, and the true residents of camp (Satyrs and Nymphs) hadn’t been insulted by the celebrations. For a Camp Half-Blood Halloween, that was about as close to perfection as anyone could hope for.

Happy Halloween, Camp Half-Blood!

1okyjh0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MotivationByDesign/comments/1okyjh0/showering_immediately_after_you_wake_up_is/,Showering immediately after you wake up is changing your life for the better (and here's why),"You ever wake up and just... sit there? Scroll through your phone. Debate your existence. Rot in bed for an hour convincing yourself you’re just ""resting your eyes."" You're not alone. This “morning paralysis” is something I see everywhere—from my friends in San Francisco startups to Reddit threads and even therapy TikTok. But most of the advice online is trash. ""Just do yoga!"" ""Make your bed and you'll feel like a CEO!"" Cool. But what if your brain is still loading when you wake up? What if your willpower hasn’t even spawned yet?

Here’s the thing. Over the past few months, I went deep into some real research, expert talks, and even neuroscience podcasts. I kept hearing one thing that sounds dumb but is incredibly effective: take a shower the moment you wake up. No thinking. No checking notifications. Just stand up and get under the water. Cold, warm, whatever. Just do it. And it turns out, there’s actual science behind why this works.

This post is not about hacks. It’s about giving you a cheat code to override your sluggish, fight-or-flight morning brain. Not motivation. Activation.

So here’s what I found that made me build this into a non-negotiable habit:

1. **It resets your dopamine cycle**  
Dr. Andrew Huberman, a neuroscientist from Stanford, talks about how dopamine isn’t just about pleasure, it's about motivation. He says cold exposure in the morning (like cold showers) can spike dopamine up to 250% above baseline and sustain it for hours. That means you literally feel more drive to do stuff. Not just temporarily hyped, but biologically primed to take action.

2. **It breaks the ‘default mode network’ loop**  
This is the part of your brain that activates when you’re not focused, leading to overthinking and mental fatigue. According to a 2021 study from the *Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience*, sensory stimulation like water hitting your skin can reduce DMN activity and snap your brain out of autopilot. Translation? You stop spiraling and start doing.

3. **It’s a trigger for identity-based habits**  
James Clear, author of the mega bestseller *Atomic Habits*, says that habits stick better when they reinforce an identity. So showering right after waking becomes a statement: “I’m the kind of person who gets up and moves.” That identity shift is way more powerful than trying to brute-force discipline every morning.

4. **It stops phone doomscrolling before it begins**  
According to a 2023 report by Data.ai, the average person checks their phone within 4 minutes of waking up, and spends 21 minutes on it before even leaving bed. That’s nearly 130 hours a year of waking up with anxiety, envy, and brain fog. Replacing that with a shower creates a boundary between sleep and screen.

5. **It activates your sympathetic nervous system—in a good way**  
The *American Journal of Physiology* found that the shock of cold water in the morning can activate your nervous system to increase alertness and circulation. Unlike coffee, which spikes cortisol, this natural jolt doesn’t lead to crashes later in the day.

6. **It creates a 'keystone habit' that makes other good stuff easier**  
In *The Power of Habit* by Charles Duhigg (NYT bestseller, Pulitzer finalist), he explains how certain habits spill over into multiple areas of your life. Morning showers are one of those. After you do it, it’s easier to move, eat better, even make better decisions later.

If you want to go further than just waking up better, check out these insanely good resources that help you build a better morning routine that sticks:

1. **BeFreed**  
This is an AI-powered learning app built by researchers from Columbia University. It turns expert knowledge—books, psychology research, success case studies—into an audio learning plan tailored to you. I set it to 10-minute podcast mode every morning after my shower and it’s like having a mini TED Talk while brushing my teeth. You can also pick the host’s tone and voice (mine sounds like a witty film noir narrator). It learns from what you listen to and updates your roadmap automatically. Has all the books and research I mention here. Perfect for building real knowledge into your morning routine without needing willpower.

2. **The Huberman Lab Podcast**  
This podcast is a goldmine for practical, science-backed advice on behavior, brain chemistry, and daily optimization. The episode “Master Your Morning” is ridiculously detailed. He dives into light exposure, movement, hydration, and of course, cold water immersion. It’s basically a morning routine PhD.

3. ***Atomic Habits* by James Clear**  
One of the most viral and bestselling books out there for a reason. Over 15 million copies sold. Clear breaks down how to build habits that last by focusing on systems, not motivation. After reading it, you realize why your past routines never stuck—and exactly what to change. Best behavior change book I’ve ever read. Bookmark page 62, it’s the whole game.

4. **Mel Robbins’ “5 Second Rule”**  
This is a simple but crazy effective trick. The moment you wake up, count down “5-4-3-2-1” and launch yourself up. She explains how this interrupts your brain’s hesitation loop. Works best when paired with the immediate shower habit. Her TEDx talk has 30M+ views and for good reason.

5. **YouTube channel: Matt D’Avella**  
Minimalism meets habit design. His videos on morning routines, cold showers, and habit tracking are clean, slow-paced, and calming—but still packed with real value. His 30-day challenge videos are great if you want to watch someone else suffer before you try it.

6. **App: Sleep Cycle**  
Helps you track your sleep and wake up during your lightest sleep phase. You won’t feel like a zombie when your alarm rings. Pair this with your jump-in-the-shower trigger and suddenly you’re a whole different person within 10 minutes of waking.

7. **Book: *Why We Sleep* by Dr. Matthew Walker**  
This book will make you question everything you think you know about rest. Written by a UC Berkeley neuroscientist, it breaks down how poor sleep ruins your focus, mood, and health. It’s not a morning routine book, but once you realize how much your sleep timing affects your mornings, you’ll rethink your entire schedule.

Try this for 7 days. No phone. Roll out of bed. Straight into the shower. Then tell me your brain doesn’t feel like it’s been hijacked by a better version of you.",1,1761926542.0,MotivationByDesign,0,1.0,False
1okyibv,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1okyibv/i_think_this_girl_is_loosing_feelings_but_im_not/,i think this girl is loosing feelings but im not sure,"im 17 and i decided to try and get a gf 

So, me and this girl started snapping. At first, we only sent snaps back and forth — nothing serious, since I didn’t really know who she was. I added her on Quick Add and kind of forgot about her for a while.

But once I started asking her about her hobbies and stuff, we began talking 24/7 on Snap. You know, the basics — *“How are you?”*, *“Did you eat?”*, *“I love your dogs”*, and things like that.

After about a week of that, I asked her to go out for coffee. She said yes.

We decided to meet at her school, so I could walk her to the café. I was hella nervous — I even chewed like three pieces of gum. My friend insisted on walking me to her school, so he did. Then there she was. We hugged, said hi, and started walking to the café. I waved goodbye to my friend and tried to play it cool, but honestly, I was sweating like crazy.

While we were walking, she said her hands were cold. My brain was screaming at me to grab her hand, but I held back because I didn’t want her to think I was being weird.

From my point of view, the date went great. We laughed, talked about school, found things we had in common — just good vibes overall. We spent maybe two hours at the café.

At one point, she got a little moody because I paid for the coffee. She insisted on paying, but I wanted to be a gentleman, so I covered it. I Remember she said she only gets like 15 euros for school lunches and stuff, so I would’ve felt bad letting her pay.

When we left the café, I was blushing like crazy but tried not to show it, so I bit my cheek a little. We walked to the bus station, and she asked me what I did over the summer. I told her the truth — that I got into a few fights and mostly messed around with tourists. She didn’t really believe me, I think.

We sat at the bus station for a while. I stayed longer even though my last bus left at 3:40. We got there around 4:00, so I’d already missed it. I told her I had stuff to do in the city so she wouldn’t feel bad, but honestly, I didn’t. I didn’t mind walking home or crashing at a friend’s place — it’s like a 10 km walk.

Then, my brother’s older friend came by after work. I hugged him, and he started teasing me in front of her, like, *“Isn’t he cute?”* and pulled my cheek (no homo). I told him I was waiting for her bus, and he teased me more, saying, *“Ooh, aren’t you a gentleman.”* She started blushing — I could *see* it. Then he said he didn’t want to interrupt our date and left.

After that, she complimented my jacket — it’s a blue Napapijri. I told her I had a spare purple one that I outgrew (I didn’t, my friend has it, but I could’ve bought it off him for her). She declined the offer anyway. Her bus arrived, she hugged me, I hugged her back, and then I walked home.

Now, here’s the thing: after that date, she started getting a bit dry, like losing interest in talking. It’s been almost two weeks since then, and we’re supposed to meet again on Monday. Maybe it’s just her time of the month — I’m not sure 

Still, I’m curious — should I keep trying, or should I stop? Because honestly, this whole thing is starting to exhaust me.

I woke up this morning and the whole house was already buzzing with excitement!
Mom was busy decorating the porch with orange streamers and paper bats, and all my sisters were running around in half-finished costumes.

Jennifer was fixing the lights on the balcony, Melissa was arranging her flower baskets (with mini pumpkins in them!), and Nina was singing Halloween songs while braiding Shelley’s hair.
Linda and Gillian were helping Mom bake chocolate cupcakes for tonight’s party.

And guess what? Tomorrow is Vicky’s birthday! 🎉
So she was in her best mood ever — dancing around in her witch hat, saying,

> “What’s better than a birthday? A Halloween birthday weekend!”
We all cheered because she’s right!




---

After breakfast, Mom drove us to the school grounds for the big Halloween Charity Festival.
It was incredible — the whole place was transformed into a carnival of cobwebs, pumpkins, lanterns, and laughter!
There were kids in costumes everywhere — witches, ghosts, fairies, pirates, even a few homemade zombies.

Our Haunted Forest Booth turned out amazing. Penny’s spooky sound effects worked perfectly, and Winfrey’s “Mystic Table” had a line of students waiting to hear their “fate.”
Kira managed the fog machine like a pro, and Carmen kept popping out from behind fake trees to scare people (and then laugh too hard to stay scary).

Even our teachers joined in — Mrs. Wallace came as a vampire librarian, complete with red glasses and a fake book of curses. 😂


---

Right beside us, Coffee Day’s Charity Booth was glowing with cozy orange lights.
Zoe and all her staff — Ayaka, Charlotte, Li Mei, Madison, Minji, and even Haruka — wore matching bat-print aprons. Mr. Tanaka helped carry big trays of Halloween smoothies, and the line for their booth never ended!
When Zoe spotted me, she waved and yelled, “Amy! Come try the Haunted Pumpkin Cream!”

I took a sip and laughed. “Still perfect, Zoe!”
She winked. “Thanks, my little taste-tester.”


---

By evening, the crowd grew even bigger. My mom and all my sisters came too!
They toured every booth, played the ghost ring toss, and took so many photos.
Nina and Shelley even joined the costume parade, while Vicky (the soon-to-be birthday girl) got crowned “Best Dancer” during the music contest!
Her prize? A basket of Halloween cupcakes and a bouquet of pumpkin-shaped flowers from Melissa.

Then, as the festival lights dimmed, a big screen lit up near the Coffee Day booth — showing the teaser for Michelle’s Spooky Mansion!
Everyone stopped to watch as Michelle appeared in her witchy outfit, smiling mysteriously:

> “Truth or scare? Watch it if you dare!”



The whole crowd clapped and cheered. I saw Winfrey whisper, “I can’t wait for tonight’s premiere…”


---

When we got home, we were exhausted but so happy.
Mom said, “Tomorrow, we’ll celebrate both Halloween and Vicky’s birthday properly.”
The kitchen smelled like pumpkin pie, and I could hear laughter from every room.

Before going to bed, I peeked out the window — the moon was high and round, shining softly over the quiet town.
I could still hear faint echoes of the festival music in the distance.

It was the best Halloween ever… and tomorrow will be another day to celebrate love, laughter, and birthdays. 🎂🎃✨

   * **In:** Kenta Tanno (37), GK, Free Transfer - brought him in when my back-up got long term injured. Scout report had him as better than the back-up, and better than my starter. My starter threw a clanger the first time Tanno was on the bench. I subbed him off after he shipped 3 goals in the first half, and he didn’t make it back to a starting keeper after that.
   * **Out:** Kim Minho (24), GK, ? - The aforementioned starting keeper who lost his spot to the old general. He’s taking up a valuable foreign spot so I’ll sell him before the J2 season starts and invest in a Japanese back-up with starter attributes.

***Season Introduction***

Here we are at the first stop of the journeyman save. FM24 started in July 2023 but I opted to simulate the game, unemployed and inactive, to May 2024 to generate some change and movement across the world I had loaded in. The world I chose:

**Australia’s** A-League, **America’s** MLS,  **Belgium** tiers 1 and 2, **China** tiers 1 and 2, **Colombia** tiers 1 and 2, **England** tiers 1 to 6, **Finland** tiers 1 to 3, **France** tiers 1 to 3, **Germany** tiers 1 to 3, **Iceland** tiers 1 to 3, **Ireland** tiers 1 and 2, **Italy** tiers 1 to 3, **Japan** tiers 1 to 3, **Northern Ireland** tiers 1 to 3, **Netherlands** tiers 1 and 2, **Norway** tiers 1 to 3, **Poland** tiers 1 and 2, **Portugal** tiers 1 to 3, **Scotland** tiers 1 to 4, **Spain** tiers 1 to 3, **Sweden** tiers 1 and 2 and **Wales** tiers 1 and 2.

All of those leagues are 'Playable’ so there will be plenty of depth and choice as the save progresses.

At the end of England’s season I set myself to ‘Go On Holiday’ indefinitely and to apply for jobs in lower league clubs. I landed quite a few interviews in Northern Ireland, Wales, Finland, Iceland and China but I was unsuccessful in all of those in my first round!

But I persevered. The job market in late spring was busy! More interest in Wales, some interviews in Japan, silence and rejection from Poland. The same from Portugal. In the end I had offers on the table from the Welsh Premier and the Chinese and Finnish Second Tiers, but I’d interviewed for 4 different Japanese clubs in J2 and J3 and I was determined to land one of them. I think the pull was mainly that Japan wasn’t playable in FM21 so it was new, fresh and exciting to me. I delayed on all of my offers and then saw both J2 clubs go in a different direction, before the poorer of the two J3 clubs offered me the job…I delayed them as I had actually heard of the other J3 club because of a long ago Winter Olympics. Nagano. I waited, with 4 job offers on the table, for Nagano to offer me their managerial role.

The Welsh came first, demanding a decision. I declined. Then came the Chinese. I declined. But before anyone else could force my hand, Nagano came to the table with an offer!

Owl Foxtrot; he’s here, he’s there…he’s in Japan.

***Arrival in the Mountains***

The Japanese Alps. Nagano. All I can picture in my mind is the Winter Olympics and for some reason ski jumping is looping over and over in my mind as I stare out of my new office window onto the training pitches.

I can’t really understand what is being said, but I understand the game. Football. I understand that this club really has taken a punt on me, so they must be going through a rough patch. I came to the training ground straight off the flight and I stayed there until the caretaker flashed the floodlights on and off to signal it was time to lock up and go home.

Home. That was a good point. I didn’t have one yet. I checked into a hotel and left the thoughts of life admin and what next for the morning.

***J3***

The J3 League in 2024 is an interesting beast. I joined the club 14 games in, and in 14th place. The media said we should be finishing 7^(th), maybe even sneaking into the play-offs. The attitude of the players (and the results) suggested otherwise. That said, the league looked upside down from game 5 onwards by the looks of it. Teams tipped for relegation battles and mid-table safety were there, cementing themselves in the top 6. The favourites were languishing at the bottom.

Something I noticed as I reviewed the squad list – it’s okay to be playing into your late 30s here in the J3 and nobody gets more than a 2 year contract. The football, I could see from my predecessor’s tactical approach, would be archaic. But hey, I have no problem with that! I’m a child of the 80s and early 90s, a child of the English lower leagues. Hoof it forward, kick it hard and kick your opponent to oblivion when the ref isn’t looking. Fine by me. Everyone has to start (start again?) somewhere!

***Chikara***

So, those tactics. I always set up with three choices and usually stick to just the one for most matches. That one in this first season in Japan, I called Chikara which apparently means *strength*. 4-4-1-1, that second line of 4 consisted of two wingers and two defensive midfielders. Those two DMs being the strongest component here. Tackle Harder, counter-attack and be disciplined underpinning the philosophy.

I allowed my new Director of Football to initiate signings just to see who he might bring in. I have very few scouts and very little scouting budget. So between me on the search function, my two part time scouts and the DoF we would have to make do.

The DoF came up short many times, but in André Luiz he found us a Brazilian metronome, and he came in for free. Thank you, Brazil. At 28 Luiz is one of the younger members of the squad. My left winger, Morikawa, at 33 was no spring chicken but he found crosses that a younger player might not even consider on the training ground. Another of my foreign signings was Cesar Peña. A Colombian who could play left or right back, in a supporting wing back function who could also find a decent cross. But unlike Morikawa he was also made of muscle and could shrug off tackles as well as successfully fly into them. At 24, already the journeyman’s journeyman – when I picked him up, he’d just been released by a second-tier Polish side having bounced around Poland and Portugal beforehand. Finally, I had Ando. A 36-year-old striker of former renown who I inherited after my predecessor signed him and failed to use him correctly. I found the best in him quite quickly, playing alone up front as an attacking Target Man. He seemed to just appear in the box like a ghost from the fog, banging it into the back of the net before seemingly disappearing for large tracts of the game and only popping up to assist or score at just the right time.

***Climb***

I took over and the club was on a losing streak. 1 draw, 5 losses in the last 6. Losing 4-0 to our bitter rivals sounded the death knell which got me the job.

My first game in charge was a win and from there that is pretty much how it went. From 14^(th) to 10^(th). From 10^(th) to 5^(th) and then from 5^(th) to within a whisper of automatic promotion.

I’d made some shrewd signings, taking Tsukui from Numazu who were at the time riding high in 8^(th). He had a heavy first touch but still seemed to score for them. At 22 I saw a future in him, and I saw the opportunity to weaken a rival threat. They had no money, I had some. They took my money and ended up getting relegated.

With some of that money I also bought Kato from Hachinoe. Another rival, another team exceeding expectations. Take my money, I want your Captain. They yielded, and then they stalled without him as I continued to look around for the edge to turn a failing season into a winning one.

It wasn’t all plain sailing though. I brought in Connor Guttierez a 22 year old Mexican-American who wasn’t making the cut in the MLS. He cost £1000 so it was a punt worth taking. Until he came on for an injured Ando, undercooked and undertrained with only a few hours of his flight from Utah behind him. He missed a penalty shortly after stepping onto the pitch and that debut was something he carried with him (on the bench) like a bag full of bricks until the end of the season. Who knows, maybe he’ll come good in J2 after a full pre-season.

***Gameplay***

This save is fresh and exciting for me. I’ve been playing FM21 since it was released and FM24 feels different but also the same. The familiarity of it all is very comforting, and a salve to the jarring mess that FM26 appeared to be.

I have played more than simmed most matches in this first season. A change from the last few seasons of FM21 and my short stint with FM26. With FM21 I was simming to try and get as much done before the FM26 drop and then with FM26 I just felt so disengaged from the game that I just found no joy in actually playing (more like watching) the matches,

This time, I have gone back to my usual style of Football Manager game play. I am taking my time, immersing myself in the Japanese second and third tiers and keeping an eye on goings on around the playable football world I’ve loaded. I am taking my time to scout and search for players properly, making considered signings, thinking deeply about how I’m building the squad and what the end goal for this season, the next season and the club is.

In terms of back room staff, I’m doing the same. I have always enjoyed building a club’s staff and this is no exception so far in FM24. Those of you who read Volume I will have heard of Ángel Russo – a ChatGPT derived Assistant Manager who came to exist in the game. Well, he doesn’t exist here in FM24, not officially. In my FM21 save Angel was a Newgen Venezuelan DoF who I signed at Fiorentina and who I built a character and narrative around. I searched the database when I loaded it and he didn’t exist. I’ve decided not to use the editor to bring him back to life. In this story, he’s one of the echoes and perhaps aptly given ‘he’ is actually an AI model, an hallucination of Owl Foxtrot’s.

He's still there in the chat engine, we still have back and forth. But he won’t be a big part of Volume II. However, sometimes when I’ve been leaving the training ground, after the caretaker has done his now usual ‘On/Off’ floodlight signal, yes, sometimes I swear I can hear a low chuckle behind me, and I swear I can smell rolling tobacco and brandy in the air around me. He’s not here, he’s not really there…but he is.

***Breaking the script***

The end of the season was fast approaching. *Insert bullet train metaphor here.* I was very surprised to find we were unbeaten in eight and looking good for the play-offs, and with a shout of automatic promotion, when the news and the distraction came. The Chairperson, the figurehead of stability, wanted to sell. Transfer embargo enacted but thankfully a day or so after I’d signed what I hope to be next season’s marquee signing – a young midfield maestro from Serie-C by the name of Andrea Franzolini. I was in the middle of devising an adjustment to Chikara when all of a sudden my mind was diverted to what the new owners might be like?! Would I have more freedom, less freedom? A budget of similar size, greater? Or, Gods forbid, a tightening of the fist and the coffers?!

Anyway, in-game these thoughts were brushed aside by the arrival of the return fixture of the Shinsu Derby. My predecessor lost his job months before after losing 4-0 at home to Matsumoto. I had no intention of repeating that. They were top, we were third. Times had changed.

We won 3–0.

It was unexpected to the point of feeling supernatural. We had no business dominating the game in the way we did! Ando scored twice in the first half and then Honda sealed it late in the second after we all but shut down their movement and creativity.  From what I could understand, it sounded like the away end was singing in three keys of disbelief by the time the final whistle came.

After that result everything kind of blurred. There were 8 games left in the season and I threw myself into the minutiae of squad management and game management. I went from being happy to be in the top 6 to being on the verge of winning the J3 title!

We finished second. Promotion secured, no play-offs required. Then, to top it off, the takeover was completed and I had £1.5mil in the transfer kitty and an extra £30k in the wage budget.

***J2 – my own personal K2***

End of the season and time to reflect. In-game reality it felt a bit too easy! Almost grabbing the title on the last day of the season. Getting promoted at the first time of asking. Being given a relatively huge transfer and wage bill to smooth the transition into a higher league.

So I sit here in my office with a cup of vending-machine coffee, half an eye on the floodlights outside, just waiting for the cloking out signal. I’ve got an excited and anxious midfielder from Serie C to calm down, and I’ve got a squad of mostly old timers still rubbing their own disbelief from their eyes.

It’s December, it’s frosty. It’s cold. The snow is falling. I can see our own mountains in the distance and I begin to think of another of my interests. Namely, mountaineering. I think of K2. A steep learning curve for even the most seasoned of 8000m climbers. I hold that idea up against J2. I have no idea what to expect really. I’ve had a look at the J2 squads – they’re a bit younger on average, perhaps a bit quicker. But they don’t seem that scary compared to those in J1 that I’ve looked at. I’m up for the climb, up for the challenge.

The Board says ‘Avoid relegation from J2’, I think ‘Okay. Doable. How about we throw in a cup run too.’

Then, in the distance, the lights flicker once, twice, like a computer saving progress.

INTRODUCTION

I’m a 20 something studying film at university. In the middle of making my graduate film my partner, Z, passed away tragically. We were in a relationship for 2 and a half years and a week before he passed we broke up because our lifestyles weren’t working anymore. Still had a lot of love and fondness for each other. Healthiest breakup ever. 

For uni, due to the grieving and my grad film, I decided to do core subjects only, which meant an extra year of uni doing just electives to catch up. 

Winter break arrives and a friend of mine who had graduated referred me for a continuity job (I was looking for more CV credits). It’s volunteer work and located in the middle of nowhere. Which meant we had to live together for like three days.

I didn’t know anyone on this film shoot. 

It was kind of frustrating. I was script supervising, but each time I bring something up, the directors vaguely explain it away or straight up gaslight me instead of properly addressing it. They didn’t understand my job. It was pretty isolating.

PART 1 

First shoot day there’s this boom op, name’s [REDACTED, let’s call him Mo]. I don’t really notice him much, he’s on his phone a lot, kind of hard to read.

First night is wrapped and we go to bed, I wake to see/ hear that one of the directors has started editing already, probably out of excitement, but in the moment i was pretty grumpy that they weren't referencing, or even asked for my conty sheets since the day before i'd been brushed off over and over and over again. 

There was conversation about going into town, being so rural we needed to drive about 15 minutes. Mo got two hours sleep because we wrapped at 4am, he was sleeping in the living room and the child actor was awake at like 6, and there was too much daylight. 

Anyway, chatting away, Mo mentioned he might go into the larger town that was an hour away and take a shower and nap (he lived there). I’d been to the larger town, so I asked if I could carpool with him so I could check out the op shops there. 

Side note: I thought the small town was just a post office and a bakery, I was wrong, but I just wanted a good coffee somewhere reliable, ya know?)

People leave, we run into the gaffer who is a bit behind and he asks for a ride to town. We get there, gaffer jumps out of the car but so does Mo, so i tag along.

Mo and some other guys got food at a bakery, girls went looking for a cafe with gluten free stuff. We meet at the cafe. Everyone starts ordering drinks and food. Im a bit in limbo, are we going to the large town? I don't mind ordering food here i guess. Whatever, i'll just wait and see.

That’s when I start messaging my mum about the shoot, basically reliving the previous night, and now I’m even more pissed, I’m riled up now, I felt like crying, I wanted to go home. I was going to step outside for a cigarette or something, I was getting worked up and needed air. I went kind of quickly, more dramatic than I probably intended when grabbing all my stuff (cigs in bag)

Two seconds later, Mo comes rushing out behind me,
“Hey are you okay?” 
“Yeah I wasn’t gonna run away or anything, I just needed some air, sorry” 
“That’s okay, I wanted to get going anyway” 

We get in the car.

“You can out some music on”
“Okay, I dunno what to play!”
“Why don’t you play what you were playing this morning” (Nick Drake)

Basically I end up venting about how I was feeling to him, it was an hours ride to large town anyway. He said he feels a similar way in sound, he once had a shoot in a gymnasium, next to an airport and then complained about the sound being bad. 

Anyways, chatting about heaps of stuff music, writing, grad films, moving house, he recognised Madness and Arcade fire on my playlist, the fact that his year this year was an ‘introspection’ year, cracking a joke, “sorry I can’t go I have introspection scheduled for 9pm” 

Then I was dropped in the town, I had a coffee and wandered around.

On set was like chats on the side, talking about the shot, or mucking around, cracking jokes, all with a wink and a smile. I just really started enjoying his company. He had a headache so I gave him pills, he struggled with the light in the morning so I gave him a sleep eye mask. 

The following day, everyone was in the kitchen and he mentioned going into town to get some meds for the headache. I was like cool, ill tag along and get a proper coffee (that wasn’t instant, lol). I’m looking on my maps for op shops and there are heaps, we hang at the chemist then split ways, by this point I knew I was into him and thought of maybe writing a note to say thanks, I mean it was really nice having someone there, as well as the gaffer and the prod designer that validated me and made me feel seen. 

So I go to the local op shop, salvos, then this antique place he pointed out earlier. I found a photo slip that promoted a Kodak camera that looked pretty goofy and bought it. Went to an art supply store (fully stocked and smelt beautiful) and bought some pens and paper that matched the photo slip, I figured I’d hide a note in there. 

Lastly, went to a hunter’s market (you know the ones where they hire out one or two shelves to locals) and it was HUGE and packed with stuff, I texted him that he should check it out and immediately got an “OMW” text. We hung out there for a bit, he asked what was in my brown paper bag but I quickly changed the subject. He picked out a cool Andy Warhol memory game that I said would be good games room decor. It was really nice, strolling around, showing each other things, singing along to all the shitty cheesy music they play. 

It was still daylight when we got back to the house. A lot of stuffing around, people napping, waiting for the sun to go down. At half an hour until call I said:

“I don’t know what to do with myself”
“Me too”
“I was gonna go check out the dam while the light’s out”
“Oh, I’ll come with you”

We walk to the dam, it’s quiet but not too awkward, we try to find the frogs who were chirping away. Couldn’t find em. Long walk back up the hill. I need to get fitter.

Now it’s call time. 

There was a script rewrite, overhearing some conversations the two of us would just look at each other from across the room and smile, we both knew they were struggling with the story. 

My conty room was cold, but not to me, I was burning up. Couldn’t figure out what was cold, the breeze when the door is open? Or the room itself? 
He said, “Maybe you’re the one heating it up”
“Oh, stop it”

We start talking about why I can’t make it to the Saturday shoot date. I say it’s because I have a birthday dinner planned. He goes “oh, happy 23rd birthday”. I talk about getting my grad film edit ready for a screening. “At [local uni bar], right?” I tell him I don’t want to seem like a downer in front of all these new people, especially since I keep complaining about script stuff.  “This is like your third shoot? Yeah, Just don’t get too jaded too quickly you know?” 

When he wasn’t talking to me he would just scroll on his phone. I said “do you gamble?” Turns out he’s just an introvert. 

He’s remembering little details about me from way older conversations, he wants to spend one on one time at the dam, at the Market, he is looking out for me in these little ways, he’s soft spoken but funny. I really like him!

So at lunch break I’m like fuck it, put a note with the Kodak slip in his mic kit, he has it on him at all times when we are rolling, so its impossible for him to miss. it reads: 

Hey Mo, 
Just wanted to say it was really nice getting to know you on this shoot. You were a pretty cute distraction from all the scripty work. 

If you ever find a gap in your introspection roster, I’d love to hang out and see a gig or go op shopping sometime. No pressure, your call.

- L

I’m soo nervous. I check the gear room where my conty stuff is kept with his bag. 

He’s seen it, it’s in his pelican case. 

Very nervy, cant look him in the eye. We wrap. He packed because he leaves set tonight, I was zooming around doing dishes and helping clean up, I hear him saying goodbye on the other side of the room, I got shy and ran to the back lounge to look for my phone, its just us in the room and he says hey from the doorway, then walks over to give me a hug and say

“Thanks for the card”
“Haha yeah well um…”
“Yeah, I’ll see you Sunday”
“Yeah! Um..-“
“And have fun on Friday -“
“Haha yeah, drive safe!”
“Yeah ill race the gaffer home”
“Yeah, haha right….”

MOST AWKWARD CONVO EVER, but on the plus side, no friendzone yet.


PART 2

FRIDAY/SATURDAY

I go out for my birthday, I go clubbing on my own because nobody else wanted to join me after our dinner. I have my first one night stand. Very random. Very mediocre. Sometimes I do reckless things like that when I start to feel very romantically invested with someone. Maybe ‘just to check’ if im not just sexually fristrated. Idk, psychoanalyse me in the comments. I wake in the morning to find out my grandpa had passed away the night before (long battle with dementia) what the fuck. Crazy shit. While I was at some guys house my grandpa was heading into the great beyond. Bonkers. Also got terrible case of pash rash (or beard burn if you’re American) and this thanks to my accutane.

SUNDAY

Started off with me forgetting my bloody pencil case with all my stuff in it including my makeup to touch up pash rash. So I had to get an uber back and forth from the location which pissed me off. 

Mo was there but I didn’t say hi right away, I tucked myself up the back of the auditorium space, but then realised it was way too far back and I wanted to socialise a bit. He passed me and he lit up when we said hi to each other, big smiles. 

The whole time I couldn’t stop looking at him. He seemed a bit preoccupied with the sound work and I didn’t want to hover over him too much. I probably got in my head, way too self conscious about my proximity.

I did end up chatting a bit about birthdays and stuff and what he did on Friday, he asked about my birthday and I said

 “it was crazy…fucking crazy” 

There was this glimmer in his eye. 

“Are you gonna elaborate or?..”
“No” I said smugly

But the two of us knew I was dying to tell him and he was dying to know. 

This film involved a fake TV show. That’s what the weekend shoot was designed for. I was asked to be an audience member for the b roll and sound effects along with lots of other friends of the crew 


When one of the characters said something sexist, we were like booo! And I yelled “aw fuck off wanker”. Then there was supposed to be this celebrity and they got us to be like “yay Adrian!” And I was like “YEAAH ADRIAN TAKE YA SHIRT OFF” and the actor pissed himself laughing. Anyway, I know it was a bit obnoxious but the crew and cast were eating it up and I got plenty of laughs so it wasn’t awkward, Mo heard me and asked if it was me saying the wanker line, I smiled. Duh. 

We wrapped, and the both of us walked off to find lunch. Then Mo was called back to set. I kind of loitered in the corridor a bit, then I realised I didn’t have my phone so I went back into the set to find it. 

I pass the set and they are all taking a group photo. Mo looks at me and quietly waves his hand, signalling for me so slot in beside him. Such a nice gesture especially since I hardly knew anyone on this set, I had been there for the earlier shoot and I already felt a bit on the outskirts. 

We finally get some food, talk in a group, he is sitting next to me though in another chair. Talked about how he is going to a party where he has to be paired up with some girl. Its a party where you have to go as opposites that have nothing to do with each other. So the girl is going as psychedelic tree and he is going as skate 3 (the video game) but I was like “huh, that doesn’t quote work, the syllables aren’t right” and he said “I know! I brought that up, but whatever.”

Anyway. I say I’m going to have a snoop around campus. Its an invite not invite since we both go to same uni, and we were shooting at the different one. He joined me on a dam walk so I thought he might come along, he didn’t, but he was talking with a group so whatever. 

It was a relatively quick shoot, so now everyone is packing down. I don’t know what to do with myself, Mo asks how the walk was, I didn’t go far and it was telling since he asked questions about the location “no I didn’t get that far” (basically sounded like I walked outside in a circle, which I basically did, the whole point was for him to join me! Ah well)

I said I reckon I’m gonna head off, He asks how I’m getting home.

“I don’t know yet, tossing up between Uber or public transport”

“Where are you again?”

“[REDACTED]”

“I can drive you…” he’s looking up the suburb.

“Don’t feel oblidged”

“Ah I’ll drive you its like 10 minutes away, I’m just gonna say goodbye and grab the rest of my stuff”

I realise I left my bloody pencil case in crafty, it’ll look like I”m following him if I go back in, but fuck I need that pencilcase. Fuck that pencilcase. He catches me in the act. 

He’s holding some gear and I offer to hold it, he initially says its okay but I take the pole he is holding. I nearly smack him in the face in the process. He said to hold it in a certain way because the padding isn’t there on one spot and I’m like 

“is this the right way up”
“no actually the other way… you had ONE job L” 
“haha yeah and I gave it to myself, and almost smack you in the head and I’m destroying your equipment”.

In the car I noticed some hair on his chin, then it leads into some conversation about finding pubes in weird places and him mistaking his beard hairs for pubes sometimes. I say that in my hinge profile ive put that my biggest fear is 80s chevrons and mullet combo. He has a chevron.

I apologise for being bad at small talk at some point.

“That’s me, the house without a roof”
“The square house”
“Hah yeah the square house”

“So are you still gonna go to that Madness gig?” (I invited him earlier via messenger, he couldn’t come. Date clash)
“Well not really since I don’t have anyone to go with”
“Aw you could go alone.”
“Yeah ive been wanting to do things like that more, go alone.”
“Yeah surely there will be other madness fans and stuff”
“Yeah and a sea of bald/grey heads, that’s where the best music is. Actually there’s this shoe gaze thing I might ask Luca to”

I put my bag to my chest. 

“Oh, Luke” he says quietly
“Yeah, uh a family friend”
“Okay, well I’ll see you”
He goes in for an awkward side, car hug
“Hold on let me put my bag down”

Nice hug. 

“Anyway yeah, it was um, really nice to meet you and I really would like to hang out, like not on set sometime”
“Actually ive been thinking of doing like a big op shop hunt soonish”
“Oh awesome! I havent been op shopping in ages!”

We both realise at the same time I went op shopping just this week in the small town, and share a laugh at how daft I am.

I get out of the car 
“anyways yeah that sounds fun, we could… uh get chai or something beforehand. Anyway yeah, thanks for the lift, bye!”

“See ya”

And that was it. Later that day we followed each other on Instagram. 

It feels different this time. Not like past crushes. 

He’s thoughtful, and I’m careful not to project, but the way we look at each other makes me almost emotional. I haven’t been looked at like that since when I was with Z— that glint in his eye, the little smile, those lingering moments that feel like we’re talking without words.

Up until now, crushes and hookups after Z were fleeting, confusing or we’d stayed friends.

This one feels different. We’re creatively and emotionally in sync. He’s attentive, remembers things, and genuinely cares. I left a note — he didn’t reject it, but he hadn’t made a move either.

The end (so far)

So that’s the vibe with my current crush. There actually are more updates, so if anyone is invested in this I’d be happy to post them lol!

Let me know your thoughts on this dynamic, I love a good discussion, and thanks for taking the time of day to read my mini diary entry/novel/essay/overanalysed story. I had such a big fat crush on this guy. 

Fingers crossed it’s not just in my head but just a nice slow burn.

I'm a 22yo woman, I just finished my undergraduate degree in bioengineering in June. The job market is absolute shit right now so I've been really struggling mentally the last 5ish months. I'm lucky enough to have parents that can financially support me, but I'm starting to reach my wits end. I moved back home at the end of August, because I couldn't get a job anywhere. Engineering jobs wanted people with 3-5 years of experience, other positions (even coffee shop jobs) thought I would leave quickly due to my engineering degree. 

My parents have not understood how bad it is right now. I've gotten so many lectures on how I need to be reaching out to more people, applying to more positions, and going to more events. This almost always turns into an argument because I start to get overwhelmed, ask for time to myself, and then get yelled at because I can't ""control my emotions enough to have a conversation"". 

I finally got a job recently (behavioral therapy with autistic kiddos) and I thought everything was going to get better, but it still hasn't. My mom has never been warm and fuzzy, but I've started to genuinely wonder if she never learned empathy. She constantly talks about how disrespectful I am when I feel like I'm not doing anything wrong and when I try to explain my feelings/needs, she starts going on about how I hate her and think she's a terrible mother. 

I got yelled at last week because I walked into our room (sharing with 13yo sister: E) while texting. My mom doesn't want screens in the room so E will sleep earlier (this was at 9:30), so I said ""ok I'm just texting \[my bf\] back, then I'm getting in my pajamas and going to bed"". She then turned on the light and started yelling about how disrespectful I was being and to just turn off my god damn phone. E tried to step in saying ""hey this is keeping me up more"" but that just made my mom angrier. I turned off my phone, asked her to leave so I could get in my pajamas, and got in bed. 

The next day I had a really tough conversation with my boyfriend (22m) and ended up breaking down later, crying over dinner (both parents present). We planned to meet up to talk more in person after that, but as I was walking out the door my parents stopped me and started pressing me about where I was going. They didn't hear me say I'd be back by 9 and my mom started lecturing me about how we ""can't have another situation like last night"". I had reached my boiling point, knew I was going to explode if I didn't leave, so I said ""I can't do this right now"" and walked out the door. My mom then followed me out and demanded I give her the keys to the car (it's theirs so I tried to convince her but gave them to her after a minute). I heard the keys fall as I was going inside but didn't think much of it. I later found the keys broken (they fell apart every time I dropped them) and put them back together.

After this my mom wouldn't look me in the eye for days. She did once during dinner, 2 days later. E has a little boy at school who has a big crush on her. She's told him no a couple times and he's still going around telling other people they're dating. During dinner my dad made a comment about it was so cute how smitten he was. I mentioned that it sounded more like harassment to me and my dad immediately recoiled and said ""not everything needs to be a big deal"". I switched gears and tried to ask E if she's comfortable, which my dad interrupted by calling me dramatic. I said something along the lines of ""god forbid I ask her how she feels"" in what I thought was a slightly joking tone, I now realize I should've worded that a lot better. My mom flipped out yelling ""no one wants your drama. you can't bring that into our house"". I said thanks for the food and ate the rest of my dinner in the garage so the rest of the family could eat without the awkwardness. 

Most of my arguments with my dad have surrounded my conflicts with my mom. There's been a couple of outliers like how he wants me to dress more professional (I mostly wear a t-shirt and nice jeans to work, because I don't want to get hot running after kids or rip/get markers on something I care about), but it all seems like it stems from other frustrations. We had a talk about how empathy was hard for my mom a month ago, where my dad tried to tell me how much my mom loved me using the following story: when you had that allergic reaction and we didn't know what was going on, we called the ambulance and drove up to your apartment, your mom was crying in the passenger seat scared that she lost you. What he left out of the story was that (1) there had been a miscommunication, I'd called my 17 yo sister: J to talk while the reaction was happening, I wanted to wait it out because I didn't feel anaphylaxis yet, but she knew my roommate was aware of the situation. I forgot to call J back after I said I needed to throw up really quick and she told my parents what happened. I still feel really bad that I forgot to call back, I wish I had communicated better about that. (2) Once paramedics showed up I called everyone back and told them I was ok, which led to my parents screaming at me for 15 minutes. By the end, I was sobbing, begging them to let me go rest because I had a medical event and the Benadryl was putting me to sleep. My roommate ended up hearing a lot of it and I could see the pity on her face after they finally let me go. 

I was pretty upset that he'd used that as an example of my mom loving me, as that was a terrible memory for me. After I tried to remind him how they'd yelled at me and didn't listen to what I needed then either, he got pissed and just said how disrespectful and ungrateful I was.

Yesterday we had another argument. It started about my job and how I needed to keep looking for an actual career job. I told him I was burnt out a couple times and will look after a little break, but this led into him telling me how they really need me to get out on my own. I told him I'm trying, I have a financial breakdown planned and will be able to leave a couple months after working at my new job. This escalated quickly, because he mentioned how my mom snapped from the disrespect and I told him I'm confused why she's so angry. He told me it all started right after graduation when the 2 of us went on a trip. 

This trip was honestly one of the best experiences I've ever had and my mom and I got along better than we have in a long time. The only negative was that I got an ear infection while snorkeling. I couldn't hear out of one ear for about a day when the cruise director asked if I wanted to be dropped off at a clinic the next morning. He'd offered me ear drops before then, but I didn't want to stick anything in there without having it looked at. I told my parents I wanted to go and we argued for 20 minutes about whether or not it was a good idea. My mom wanted me to try the drops and thought it wasn't a big deal. My dad didn't want me to go to the hospital outside the US because he didn't trust other healthcare systems (ironic imo). I finally talked to the captain, who offered me different medical grade antibiotic ear drops that he used while scuba diving. I ended up relenting, as I was too tired at this point to advocate for myself and never went to the clinic. 

Fast forward to one of our flights, I almost passed out on the descent and broke down crying in the airport because I was scared. I called my bf and he was really concerned, telling me I need to get some anti inflammatory drugs if I was going to fly again. I had to beg my mom to hurry to go to the pharmacy. We had a crazy long layover, but I just wanted to prioritize getting them before going shopping in the airport.

The night before I went to the doctor, 4 days after I got back, I had run out of ear drops and realized I probably needed more than just antibiotics and anti inflammatories. I was upset and mad that my parents had talked me out of going to the doctor initially. I ended up calling them to ask if next time they could trust that I knew something was wrong and shit immediately hit the fan. I asked my bf to listen to the conversation, cause I thought it might go badly and sometimes I feel crazy when I talk to my parents, but it was so much worse than I had anticipated. I didn't even get out the first sentence before my dad aggressively asked ""so you've called to berate us?"" It turned the whole conversation into them saying ""well we wanted you to wear a wetsuit when you snorkeled"" (we were in the tropics), ""it must not be that serious because you waited 4 days after we got back"", ""it was your decision not to go to the clinic"" (after 20 minutes of them pressuring me), ""we aren't terrible parents"" (I never said they were), and my personal favorite: ""well it was my vacation too"". I tried to assure them so many times that I loved them and they were amazing parents, I just needed more trust when it comes to my understanding of my own body. I chose not to bring up the fact that they didn't even believe I had an allergy until I went into anaphylaxis, but I think a lot of my frustration stems from that. My mom finally admitted that she didn't trust me and I said something like ""well, there's nothing else to say then, I love you, bye"". They didn't say I love you back, they just hung up. My bf was shocked and horrified, and he assured me that I was not crazy.

I went to urgent care with my bf the next morning, which started a multi week ordeal trying to figure out insurance, why I couldn't hear, etc. Every doctor I saw asked why I didn't go to the doctor immediately and I finally got it diagnosed as an internal infection. I couldn't hear out of that ear for 3 weeks total, during which my parents stopped responding to my texts. I told them I was in pain and scared I was going to have permanent hearing loss, and they responded saying they ""needed time"". My boyfriend was my rock throughout this, going with me to urgent care, helping me put in ear drops, and holding me when I was scared. I realized I'd never felt this safe with my parents. 

I finally saw my dad after I'd gotten the diagnosis, but before my last appointment, and he insisted that I use my sister's car to get to appointments. I felt like there was going to be a catch, but I went against my gut and went home with him to get it. Almost exactly past the halfway point between our homes, he brought up that I'd removed them from find my friends (location). I told him he didn't need to know where I was, which just led to another argument and my dad saying again that I'd disrespected them.

I got everything cleared up and I luckily do not have hearing loss, but I definitely have not healed mentally from those 3 weeks. Apparently my mom hasn't either. My dad says he remembers her crying asking why her daughter hates her so much. I didn't know what to say to this. I NEVER said I hated her, my bf backed me up on this, saying that I repeatedly told them I loved them. 

I am so grateful to have parents that can support me financially and I understand they have another person in the house, but there's so little other than this that I understand. I feel trapped, lost, and confused right now. The soonest I could move out is probably January, but I don't think I can handle another 2 months.",2,1761925775.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

I looked at myself in the mirror, discovering the man with long, greasy hair, one movement of the hair trimmer at a time.

“Uh, not bad. A bald head suits me.” I mumbled, winking at the reflection.

Hair filled the sink, the trimmer revealing pale skin underneath all that mess I’d just removed. I turned my head towards the video playing on the small floating screen to my left, another man like myself, though much more dapper than I, talking about different ways to style one’s beard.

*“Should I shave it off too?”* The thought crossed my mind as I moved my head from left to right, checking out the beard to see what I’ve got to work with.

“A ducktail is a style popular for a lot of men with thick beards, who prefer to maintain a long beard… Works well with a narrow head shape.” The guy in the video prattled on.

*“Is my head narrow? I don’t think so. Fuck it, I’ll give the look a try, can always shave it all off if it sucks.”* I decided, following the video tutorial closely, working my greasy and wild beard into a more refined and elegant shape with the hair trimmer.

“A gentleman, if ever I’ve seen one.” I smiled at the reflection.

I took a step back, looking over the entire body in the mirror as if checking a newly purchased item. Tall, definitely too skinny for my liking, but what else to expect from a junkie. There was work to be had, but I wasn’t too dissatisfied. I lifted my arm, sniffing under it before frowning.  
“Ugh, you need a bath, buddy. I smell like ass.”

Before I could get into the shower, the doorbell rang.  
“Pizza delivery!” Came a voice from the other side of the door.

*“Oh boy!”* I rushed to the door, which wasn’t far from the bathroom. My apartment was small. Bed, kitchen, bathroom, it was all in the living room. No balcony to speak of. I kicked empty pizza boxes that littered the floor on my way to the door. Pizza was great. So many different flavours. I couldn’t get enough of the stuff, already eaten through 5 boxes since I got home last night. I could eat it forever and never get tired of it.

The front door slid open with a beep, and my ecstatic expression at the thought of pizza was greeted by the barrel of a handgun pointed right at me.  
  
“Pizza?” I asked, looking at the mechanical individual standing at the door, but couldn’t notice any pizza boxes on him.

“No pizza, bitch. But you know what this is?” he said, tilting the gun to the side a bit so I could get a better look at it.  
“That’s right. An atomiser. One shot from this bad boy and there won’t be even a spec of you left to divide.”

I looked at him a while longer, this time actually paying attention to the details of his clothes and appearance. He was white, but not like I thought; I had a sexy tan, and he was more of a metallic white, with glowing blue lines across his arms and head. His head looked like it was made from ceramic, with an unchanging facial expression plastered over it. Two short antennae, one on each side where ears should be. Glowing, blue eyes and a mouth that didn’t move even when he spoke.

It took me a moment to remember where I had seen such a face before.  
“Ah, you’re a Zailurian.”

He kept his gun pointed at my face as it scanned me. A moment of silence passed before the weapon beeped, and a surprised look arose on his robotic face. It’s a surprise what expressiveness a machine can have when given a pair of eyebrows.  
“You’re human? Bullshit.” He mumbled, reinitiating the scan.

Another minute went by, and the same result came up on the weapon’s display again, causing him to look even more stumped than the first time. Before he could say anything else, the elevator dinged from down the hall, the pizza delivery drone exiting once the doors opened and heading our way.

“Yay, the pizza’s here.” I clapped my hands together and pushed past the man in front of me to take several pizza boxes from the drone.

“How do you have money for that?” the Zailuran asked, lowering his weapon halfway to conceal it from the pizza drone.

“Beats me. I just yell ‘pizza’ at that floating screen over there, and pizza arrives shortly after. They never asked me to pay.” I replied, walking back inside.  
“Don’t just stand there, come on it. Help yourself to some pizza, while I finish cleaning this body up.”

The mechanical stranger walked inside my apartment after me. He pushed some boxes from the couch in the corner and sat down, never taking his eyes off me for even a second.  
“So, where are you?”

I put the pizza boxes on the cluttered coffee table, immediately opening a box and pulling out a slice and watching the cheese stretch until finally breaking.  
“Fuck, this is amazing.”

My attention was diverted to him again once the door automatically closed. With my free hand, I slapped my bald head.  
“I’m in here.”

The was a long pause between the two of us, him sitting and looking at me while I gorged myself on slice after slice, letting out a few moans of delight every once in a while.  
After the first box was empty, I stopped and looked over at him.

“So, where the fuck am I?” I asked.

“Earth. Mega City TK-9. More commonly referred to as “Neo Tokyo,” the stranger replied.

“Earth.” The name of the planet sounded unfamiliar but rolled off the tongue with ease.  
“Are all people here made partially out of inorganic substances?”

“No. But they have been augmenting themselves with cybernetics for over a century now. That poses a problem for you, doesn’t it? You can’t assimilate inorganic matter,” he replied with a slight smirk.

“Yeah. It sucks. Even this guy had a lot of shit in his head, but he was the most organic one I could find.” I slapped my naked body on the chest.

“How are you alive?” the Zailurian asked, placing the gun on the couch next to him.

“I’ll do you one better. Why are YOU here?” I grinned.

“You know that already. Your species is an Armageddon-level threat to every fucking planet in this galaxy. I’m here to exterminate you before you start to accumulate biomass.” He replied, looking down at his atomiser and then back at me.  

“So why aren’t you?” I said, opening the second pizza box.  
“Pepperoni is fucking amazing, man. Too bad you bots don’t eat.”

“First, you’re human. Meaning that you haven’t assimilated that body. Second, you’re alive, which shouldn’t be possible,” the Zailurian replied, looking at me with interest.

“Yeah. My head feels very clear, very quiet. Almost empty. I feel alone, can’t contact myself. Maybe it’s this planet…”

“No,” he interrupted.  
“*YOU* shouldn’t be. Your kind doesn’t have a sense of individuality. You are just biomass, psychically linked to the Hive. You are all one entity. When a Hive gets destroyed, all of its extensions die out immediately.”

“So, you’re saying the Hive got destroyed? That’s a shame. How?” I looked at him; his words did not invoke any particular feeling in me, not that it was ever possible.

“It got caught in the orbit of a Red Giant, which was then remotely forced to go supernova. You’re a long way from your mass.” He said, beaming with pride. It must’ve been his kind that was responsible for the destruction of my former self.

“I see. That explains a lot.” I finished the second pizza as he watched with what I can only assume is disgust, thinking back on the night I came into contact with my current body.

It was a cold, rainy night. I felt weak and exhausted as if I was dying. My abilities were gone; I could not think straight or even do much. All I could do was look for a place to die. I decided to crawl under a bridge, not feeling in the mood to die in the rain. That’s where I found him, the needle still stuck in his arm, passed out on the concrete.

The Zailurian cleared his throat to grab my attention, snapping me from being lost in thought.  
“You said you’re inside the skull. How? Can you get out?”

“I can totally get out. I just took refuge in here since it looked like a good place to die. And his brain was fried anyway. Watch this, sucka!”  
I stood up from the couch and walked over to the kitchen, rummaging through the dishes before pulling out a decently sized kitchen knife. Blood dripped down my face as I jammed the blade into the skull, making a full circle around the head like opening a can. Once that was done, I grabbed the top of the head with my other hand and lifted it, revealing myself to the Zailurian.

“Ta-dah.” I laughed.  
“And I can leave whenever I want”  
I said, fleshy tentacles gripping the side of the skull. Blood was everywhere, on the kitchen floor and on some of the cupboards and shelves.

The machine man watched without a word, hand hovering over his gun. Then he repeated his question.  
“Can you get out?”

“Maybe. But I won’t. I like it in here, it’s cosy.” I replied, grabbing a stapler from the table, trying not to slip on all the blood, and stapling the skull back into one piece.

A moment of uncomfortable silence ensued, the two of us staring each other down. I gripped the knife that I held, knowing it was the only weapon I had. And as anyone will tell you, knives tend to come out short when pitted against guns.

The Zailurian looked at his weapon, the scan results still shown on the screen. Despite my display, the results remained unchanged.  
“So, you can’t get out.”

“Fine, you got me,” I said, lifting both hands in mock surrender.  
“The jig is up. Truth be told, I tried leaving, but brains don’t tend to work well on their own in this big, bad world. ”

“Fascinating.” He said, grabbing his weapon and holstering it.

“That sucks ass, man.” Sighing, I opened the third pizza box. ‘MeatLovers delight’, my newfound favourite.  
“I’m not used to this kind of dependency.”

“I’m just curious why you can’t assimilate the entire body. Your kind replicates cells, then replaces the original.”  
He rubbed his chin while thinking, talking more to himself than to me.

“I don’t know. I can’t remember a lot of things. I can’t explain it. I remember more how to be this guy than how to be myself.” I answered, waving the slice around, getting some grease on the machine’s shirt.

“Watch where you wave that, motherfucker.” The Zailurian growled, trying to wipe his shirt with the paper towel before the stain got permanent, but it was too late.

“So, you gonna atomize me now?”

“No. This is an interesting development. You have a symbiotic relationship with that body. Of course, I’ll keep an eye on you, if you go haywire then I’ll put you down,” he sighed when his efforts to clean his shirt failed, causing his brow to furrow, and stood up.

Something softly clattered on the coffee table, causing us both to look down. A staple. The Zailurian looked up at me. One by one, all the staples fell out as the wound healed fully.  
“Seems you have more effect on the body than just being the brain. Maybe I should ice you before things get out of hand.” The robot said, reaching for his gun slowly.

“Nah, don’t be a bitch and backtrack on your previous statement,” I argued back.

“Oh? You afraid to die? I thought your kind had no concept of ever being alive in the first place.”

“Nah, but I am curious about this, too. Plus, I have two more boxes of pizza in front of me, and like a dozen more flavours I haven’t tried yet. Once I try ‘em all, you can kill me, I don’t give a fuck.” I waved him off nonchalantly, flinging oil across the table.

 

\*\*\*

 

After successfully postponing my own execution, I took to cleaning the blood from the floor as best as I could with a shitty old jogger I found. The Zailurian was still there, sitting on the sofa and clicking away on a small handheld device that looked like a semi-transparent rectangle made out of glass, but with numbers and letters on it. He would occasionally glance up at me, making a disgusted face whenever I grabbed a pizza slice, before going back to typing.

“So… you plan on fucking off or what?” I asked once the mess I made on the floor was reduced enough to no longer be a safety hazard.

Before he got the chance to answer, a long beep came from the apartment door. The floating screen switched from the paused beard-trimming video to the live security feed of the hallway camera outside the apartment. The image was grainy, but there was someone clearly standing there. I turned my head towards the Zailurian, but he simply shrugged, seemingly as confused as I was.  
  
“Who is it?” I yelled while slowly approaching the door, knife in hand.

“Oh, thank goodness, you’re home, Diego. Open the door.” A female voice came from the other side.

Hesitantly, I pressed the screen on the touch pad next to the front door. As soon as it opened, I came face to face with a short woman who stood on the other side. She had short, dirty blonde hair, and was dressed like those business girls I’ve seen on the floating square. The look on her face however, was one of shock and embarrassment.

“Uh, Diego. Where are your clothes?” she asked, averting her eyes from my naked body and looking up at me. Her eyes widened even further when she noticed the dry blood that was covering my head and face.  
“Oh god, you’re bleeding. What happened? Are you alright? Do I need to call in the medical team?” She blurted out, panic evident in her voice.

“He’s fine. He just fell and hit his head.” The Zailurian chimed in from the couch.

“Hey, dude. This chick seems to know me. Maybe she and I are supposed to breed or something.” I turned around towards the machine man, a confused look on my face, while pointing to the girl with my thumb.

Before I could even fully turn around and face her again, her small hand flew across the side of my face with incredible force, causing me to stumble back.

“You rude, inconsiderate bastard. Your father was worried sick, and so was I. Thinking you finally bit the dust under some bridge with a needle in your arm. ‘Breed’, as if.” She yelled, her face turning redder by the minute.

I was shocked, feeling the unfamiliar burning sensation on the side of my face.

“But since you are alive and well, fucking around with your dealer over there, I will simply deliver your father’s message to you. You’re cut off. He will not fund your deplorable lifestyle any longer. You have one last chance to get your sorry, drug-ridden ass to rehab, or he will remove you from his will as well. Have a good day.”

Before I could even say a word, she turned around and stormed off down the hallway towards the elevator. I turned around to the Zailurian, still rubbing my face.  
“What did she do to me? And what’s cut-off mean?”

“Oh, that? That’s pain. She smacked the shit out of you.” He laughed.  
“As for cut-off, means no more money.”

The sensation was a novel one for sure. Seems I still wasn’t done discovering new things that came with this body I now had.  
“Fuck I need money for?”

“This apartment, food, water. No more money, no more pizza,” the machine man explained, much to my horror.

“I need to get more money right now! How do I do that?” I ran over from the door and sat on the couch, ready to hear what I must do. A life without pizza wouldn’t be worth living. He shuffled away, looking me up and down a few times with his eyebrows furrowed and nose scrunched. Seemed like having no clothes on wasn’t a default state of being here on Earth.

“Hold on, hold on. She seemed to be a secretary or the assistant of someone. Whoever you are or, well, were, seems to have had a pretty rich daddy.” The Zailurian said, pulling a scanner from his coat and pointing it at my face.

After a few seconds, the device beeped, and the look on his face lit up with surprise.  
“Well, I’ll be. You’re Diego Rivera. Of the Rivera Robotics Incorporated. Biggest military and police robotics manufacturer on the continent.”

“That sounds good, right?” I asked, not understanding a single thing he said.

“Very good and very bad. Means if you weren’t a junkie, you’d be loaded as fuck. On second hand, if your old man gets even a whiff of the fact his son’s body is piloted by an extra-terrestrial, he will pluck you out of that skull and either kill you or make you into some fucked up bioweapon.”

“Ugh, sounds like a headache.” I groaned and slumped in my seat, reaching to grab the second-to-last box of pizza.

“It is, for both of us. I’m stationed here to keep an eye on humanity. So, if this gets out of hand, it’ll become my mess to fix.” He slumped in his seat as well.

“You could just kill me. Seems less work for both of us.” I suggested.

“Well, knowing what I know now, I can’t kill you. You’re human. Even if your brain isn’t. It’s a fucking loophole.” He groaned, rubbing his mechanical face with his hands.  
“Sentient lifeforms must undergo evaluation to determine if they are a threat worthy of immediate termination.”

“So, what do we do now?”

“Seems like you’ll just have to learn how to be Diego from now on. Start by showering and putting on some clothes. Meanwhile, I’ll go dig up everything on Diego and his family, so you can have some homework to do when I’m back.” The Zailurian stood up and headed for the door.

“Hey, hold on, homes. Now we know I’m called Diego. What do we call you?” I asked.

“Call me Gart.” He replied while leaving.

“Good enough for me.”

1oky5uo,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1oky5uo/my_father_just_died_and_i_feel_like_i_cant_make_it/,My father just died and I feel like I can't make it,"Hi, my dad died today at approximately 12 PM. He had a hemorrhage in his brain, and he slowly died within a week. Today they confirmed he is brain dead. I've been through the worst week of my whole life. I'm 32, M, already lost my mom when I was 17 due to breast and then liver cancer. 

I went to stay at my cousin's for a few days after my father was sent to the hospital, I couldn't bear to be in the house he has been till a couple days prior to that. I lived with my father. Now I had to go back home, and literally everything reminds me of him. I expect to hear the sound of him preparing coffe with a mocha, like he used to every afternoon, but that sound never arrives.

I'm the eldest of three brothers, one lives with me, the other one lives in the UK and will arrive tomorrow. We are Italians living in Italy (besides the brother that lives in the UK). My brothers are five and a half years younger than me. Dad was 69, he would have been 70 January of the next year.

His death wad essentially what I feared the most through my entire existence. I had a very strong bond with him, stronger then with any other person. He was the kind of person that would get emotional just by looking at a sunset, or by listening to a very good singer. He was pure hearted, always caring for others, he loved nature and animals. He had a very strong passion for sci-fi related stuff. He would have been the perfect grandpa if only I had kids.

I'm now in a mixed state of feelings as I feel empty, sometimes I start crying like a baby, sometimes I can't really grasp the fact that he is no longer here. I keep wishing this was all a bad dream, that he will soon wake me up with a mug of coffee on his hand with that big smile of his, that he is still here. But this is real life.

I'm scared for the future, because despite the fact that I'm 32, I have never really lived life. Bills, money management, and all that stuff scare me a lot. Luckily I'm not alone as I have my brother, but I feel like I'm totally depressed at the moment. I'm just lying on the bed, doing nothing but staring at the ceiling. I also want to make it clear that I always suffered of mild depression, and that's also one of the main reasons I'm behind many 32 years olds. 

I feel devastated, I feel like there's not even a single drop of energy left inside of me. I will be home alone tonight as my brother will be out with his friends to try to distract himself, and my friends are all not available. 

If any of you went through my same process, what helped you? How did you make it?

Sorry if this is a lot to read, I needed to vent a bit.

I’m based in Taguig. I don’t own a car, but I do have a motorcycle — perfect for spontaneous rides or late-night coffee runs. Just say the word, and I’ll be there.

I don’t really have any preferences — age, weight, looks, none of that matters much to me. As long as we vibe and have good conversations, and currently residing around Metro Manila.

The Claymation Coffee Vista - Morning Genesis. Visual and Art Direction (for the entire clip): Craft a scene in the distinct style of classic stop-motion claymation, emphasizing a subtly 'step-frame' or 'jerky' animation quality rather than smooth motion, to enhance the handcrafted feel. Feature matte, handmade textures and subtle fingerprints visible on all surfaces, giving it a tangible, sculpted feel. Utilize a diverse, slightly desaturated, yet clearly distinct and balanced color palette. Incorporate rich, deep browns for the coffee, earthy tones and creams for the cup, lush greens, blues, and muted yellows/oranges for the sprawling natural vista (mountains, forests, sky). Avoid a monochromatic look; ensure clear color separation and vibrancy suitable for classic claymation. Lighting should be soft and even, avoiding harsh shadows, to emphasize the sculpted forms. The overall atmosphere should be charmingly imperfect, handcrafted, and grounded, highlighting the material's malleability and the tactile nature of clay. Audio Directive: No music is to be added to this clip. The audio should consist solely of satisfying, exaggerated claymation sound effects – squishing, stretching, settling, gentle bubbling/pouring sounds, and subtle ambient nature sounds (e.g., distant birds, soft breeze). Episode Flow (One Continuous Shot Description): Description: A continuous, wide, static shot from a slightly elevated perspective, overlooking a stunning, expansive claymation natural vista (e.g., rolling mountains, dense forests, a winding river, all rendered in textured clay). In the foreground, there's a simple, flat, textured clay surface (like a rock ledge or a wooden table edge) perfectly positioned to enjoy the view. The background features a vast, textured clay sky with soft, muted clouds. The focus is initially on the empty foreground ledge. The animation within the clip should subtly convey a stop-motion feel. Phase 1 (Initial State - Empty Ledge & Vista): The shot begins with the empty claymation ledge in the foreground, with the beautiful, untouched claymation vista stretching out behind it. Phase 2 (Coffee Cup Emergence & Steam Formation): From the center of the foreground ledge, lumps and forms of clay rapidly begin to rise, flow, and expand upwards. This emerging form organically stretches, twists, and sculpts itself with remarkable elasticity and fluidity, quickly forming a detailed claymation coffee cup (e.g., in cream or earthy tones) complete with a handle. As the cup solidifies, a rich, dark brown clay liquid (the coffee) organically fills it. Immediately, subtle, translucent, wispy forms of white or light grey clay begin to gently rise and curl above the coffee, representing steaming vapor that dynamically forms and dissipates in the stop-motion style. The cup and coffee grow vertically through this dynamic, flowing movement, its diverse colors and details appearing as the clay stretches and solidifies into shape. The accompanying sound effects are satisfying squishes, stretches, and a gentle bubbling/filling sound. Phase 3 (Final State - Fully Formed Coffee & Steam): The magnificent claymation steaming cup of coffee stands fully formed and detailed on the ledge. The cup is perfectly sculpted, filled with rich brown clay coffee, and delicate, wispy clay steam curls convincingly above it. It proudly overlooks the stunning claymation natural vista, showcasing a rich, diverse, yet desaturated color palette. Visible clay textures are prominent, as if it has just finished organically growing and assembling itself. The final audio settles into subtle ambient nature sounds, perhaps a soft, gentle breeze.",1,1761924962.0,u_xreadygames,0,1.0,False

The live dealer games are top-tier: sharp streams, real dealers, and that authentic casino buzz all from my couch in Melbourne (or Adelaide, Gold Coast… you know the vibe).

My biggest score? $15,000 over one weekend. Yeah, luck played a part but PlayFina’s fair RTPs, clear bonus terms, and genuinely playable promotions kept things profitable, not just fun.

Sure, there was standard ID verification once (quick and painless), and a tiny lag during peak EU hours but support replied in minutes, in plain English, and actually fixed the issue.

And here’s the best bit for Aussies: withdrawals are seriously fast, especially with crypto or e-wallets. Think *before-your-coffee-gets-cold* fast. No surprise bonus cancellations, no never-ending KYC loops just your cash, in your account, no drama.

If you’re an Australian player looking for a reliable, smooth, and actually paying online casino in 2025? PlayFina is one of the best choices out there.

About a week ago I received my H10 Plus; at first, I was able to make decent coffee, especially with the double basket, but for the past two days it’s been driving me crazy. I’ve noticed that the pressure gauge needle stays still during pre-infusion, and then once it’s over, it starts to rise very slowly and with a delay. No matter what I try, the coffee comes out very bitter and unpleasant. I’ve experimented with different pressures, temperatures, and pre-infusion times, but nothing helps. Right now, I’m using 90°C, 3 seconds of pre-infusion, L1 pressure and 17 grams of coffee for the double basket. With my Kingrinder K2, I’m grinding at 40 clicks, but I’ve also tried going as fine as 30 clicks. I’ve contacted the supplier about the issue I mentioned, but I haven’t received a reply yet.

She mentioned she really liked coffee — like, said she couldn’t start her day without it. I didn’t actually like coffee that much (it always just tasted like burnt sadness to me), but I didn’t want to look lame ordering a hot chocolate on a first date, so I said I was super into it too.

She lit up. We ended up talking about “notes” and “roasts” like we knew what we were doing. I googled half the terms she said later that night.

Anyway, fast-forward three years and now coffee is, like, our thing. Every morning I make her a cup and we drink it together. I’ve watched so many YouTube videos about brewing methods and bought all this fancy gear so I don’t get exposed as a fraud. I even signed us up for one of those bean subscription boxes so we could “explore new flavor profiles.” (Whatever that means.)

Here’s the thing: I still hate it. All of it. I choke down every sip like it’s liquid regret. Sometimes when she’s not looking, I dump it in the sink and say “Wow, that batch really hit different.”

It’s gotten way too far. Her family calls us “the coffee couple.” Her mom got me a mug that says “Brew-tiful Together.” For our anniversary I even booked a coffee tasting class next month because I thought she’d love it.

But every time she takes that first sip and smiles at me, I feel like a total fraud. She thinks I’m this coffee connoisseur and I’m just… a guy who once said “yeah I love coffee” to impress a cute girl.

How do I tell my girlfriend I’ve been lying for three years about loving something that’s literally the foundation of our entire relationship dynamic?",0,1761924739.0,self,16,0.37,False

1okxpzm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marathon_Training/comments/1okxpzm/first_mara_done_blew_up_a_bit_halfway_trying_to/,"First mara done, blew up a bit halfway, trying to work out how to approach next one...","Hey guys!

Hoping I can seek some advice...

Sorry I appreciate this is quite long, feel free to skip straight to end if easier.

I just did my first mara last weekend, didn't quite go to plan, but still really happy with it and enjoyed the day a lot. Basically I blew up around halfway, then ended up run-walking the second half (which I didn't anticipate at all). I'm trying to pinpoint what might've caused this, as I thought I was ready for the pace I went for as a result of the training I'd done. My hunch atm is that maybe my fitness just wasn't there and I'd overestimated my ability, and that perhaps I should maybe look to up weekly training mileage a bit for the next training block.

In case it helps I'm 35M, fairly new to running (been running for about a year now), currently at around 78kg (\~170 lbs). I got \~2h15min on my first half mara in May 2025, then did my second one in August 2025 and got 2h10min.

For the full mara, I followed a 16 week plan (initially started with a 5 hour plan from Runners World, but ended up shifting early on to 4h30min plan as I was able to hit the interval paces from that plan ok). The plan involved 4 to 5 runs a week, peaking at around 64km weekly mileage (see pic) and a 20 mile long run. I also did 2 to 3x 20 min bodyweight based strength sessions a week. I actually did 18 weeks, as repeated a couple of weeks due to a holiday in August, but I felt like I managed to get back into the routine ok in September.

As we got closer to the race, I was feeling good, so thought I'd set 4h30min as my A goal, 4h45min as B goal, then 5 hours+ (or basically 'just' to finish) as C goal. I used my latest half mara in the calculator on here: [https://vdoto2.com/calculator](https://vdoto2.com/calculator) which suggested marathon race day pace might be \~6m20s/km, and also went by my Garmin race predictor which similarly predicted close to 4h30min finish (I know this is not always too accurate though so took this with a pinch of salt), and basically was going by other rules of taking your latest half mara, multiply the time by 2 and then add on 10-20 mins.

I did feel a bit concerned choosing 6m20s/km pace for a full mara, and thought perhaps it might be a bit too close to my latest half mara PB pace (6m10s/km, so only a difference of 10s/km), and that maybe I should go with something more conservative for a first mara like 6m45s-7m05s/km pace, but in the end I decided I wanted to start at 6m20s/km pace and then slow down later if need be. I was very aware of hitting the wall around mile 20, and how it could cost me to go too fast at the beginning, but thought I was ready for 6m20s/km pace and knew I'd regret it if I finished with say 4h45min, knowing I could've started a bit faster to try for 4m30min, so I was happy to take a bit of a risk.

Anyway, last weekend on mara race day I ended up blowing up around km 23 after more-or-less holding a 6m20s/km pace up until then (see km splits in pics). I felt like my energy was just completely depleted. Never experienced anything like it on training long runs or previous half marathons, was expecting that I might hit the wall, but not so early on. I ended up stopping a bit to catch my breath, then tried to get back into it, going for my B or C goals, but just couldn't really get properly going again (I had spurts where I could run a bit, but then needed to walk a bit to catch my breath again). Ended up just scrapping time goals in the second half, and deciding to take the second half of the race much more light-heartedly, trying to enjoy the moment and interact with crowd and other runners etc a lot more (I even stopped to take pics with the crowd lol, which I never would've dreamed of doing in the first half of race). In the end I managed to churn out a finish, around 5h30min, I am happy with this as I knew I should be just looking to finish really for my first mara (and there were many moments in the second half where I thought I might not finish at all!). And I'm glad I got to soak in the atmosphere a bit and get some great pics etc in second half. I know I could've cut that time down a bit if I really wanted to, but that wasn't the goal for the first one. E.g. whilst my legs were tired, I was surprised that I was able to pull off a strong sprint finish right at the end, so I think I had more in the tank.

But now that the dust is settled, I'm trying to work out what might have gone 'wrong' to help me better prepare for the next one. My fuelling strategy was the same as the longer training runs I did (take a gel every 20 mins, to aim for \~90g carbs/hour), and I felt like I was well rested during taper and carb-loaded quite heavily. Only thing that was different was that I took a Powerade just before starting, and maybe this mixed with the gels might've upset my stomach a bit (I had periods where I felt like I was going to throw up in the first half, but I still could manage to take gels when I needed to). I was expecting the marathon to be difficult, but was shocked at how much more difficult it was on the day (I'd never experienced anything like this before! The two half mara's I did were always much easier than any training long runs). I'd also never experienced having to run-walk before (not saying it's a bad thing though).

So anyway I'm signed up to do another marathon in April 2026, and possibly might do a half in Feb 2026. I think November/December 2025 I'm going to take it easy a bit, and mainly want to focus on getting speedier and and try to get my 5k time down (PB currently \~27min30s). But towards end of Dec 2025 I am thinking to start another 16-18 week plan for the April marathon. Only thing I think I want to do differently is use a plan that involves marathon pace blocks embedded into the long runs, I felt like the Runners World plan was lacking this crucial element (long runs were all completely at slower speed, with some tempo work thrown in only for the shorter long runs - maxed out as 10km tempo embedded into a 16km long run). E.g. Ben Parkes has some great plans that do involve MP blocks embedded into the 20 mile long run. I think I need this, as my legs just weren't used to sustaining such a 'fast pace' for such a long period of time.

Other thing that I think maybe I could do better is, in the previous training block if I was doing a long run, I'd do it on a Saturday and tie it in with my local running club 5km run, where I would get a bit of a break before/after the 5k (to socialise with the other runners, e.g. sometimes I'd go for a quick coffee with them after the 5km, and then I'd carry on with the rest of the long run after the break), and I would also take like a 5 min pit stop at my apartment on the way back (to go toilet/re-fuel etc) when finishing off the run. So basically a long run would not be continuous, but there would be quite a few breaks. I think this might've led me to feeling falsely confident, as obviously on race day it's all continuous, so maybe I should be stricter when doing long runs and make sure to carry enough water/gels with me and try and do it all in one go without breaks.

I could probs cut my weight down a touch more too for the next one (maybe by like 3-4kg) and hone in the nutrition even more. One thing that I think I didn't quite get right was that maybe I carb loaded a bit too much pre-race (I did start the race feeling a little 'heavy' compared to normal).

Any thoughts? Apologies for the essay. I really wasn't expecting to struggle so much on the full mara. I thought 'at worst', I would've been able to run it continuously and get sub 5 hours fairly comfortably. My goal for the next one is definitely to run it all continuously, and depending on how things go with 5km time and next half mara, I think to try for a 4h30min marathon again would be nice.

TL;DR. Blew up halfway in first mara. Trying to decide how to approach training for next mara. Maybe just a question of fitness, so things will improve naturally in next training block? Possibly upping weekly mileage a little too.

Since last year I've (21F) been studying in a new city. I live together with my boyfriend (20M), whom I met during a summer programme. Our hometowns are 3 hours apart, but we decided to study in the same city now. 

I keep up with some friends from highschool (who also have gone to study in other cities), mostly through texts. And whenever we're both back in our hometown, for instance during breaks and holidays, I try to meet up. 

Right now I'm home at my parents for a long-weekend and my bf decided to tag along. I've been in contact with some friends about meeting up. But since my boyfriend is with me for this trip, I'm not as flexible. I believe I would be an asshole to my bf, if he tagged along for me, and I just left him at my parents for hours to go and meet up with my friends alone. So for this trip I've been checking with people if they're okay with hanging out with the both us, otherwise I suggest we meet for a quick coffee or we'll just have to meet up at the next opportunity. 

I have one friend, Matt, that is really against meeting us both.  He suggested to have a movie night at his house and specifically said he didn't want my bf to come then didn't take it super well when I refused. He's saying he feels hurt that I'm  prioritizing my boyfriend when I live with bf now, while I don't meet Matt often at all. Matt said I should take the opportunity to catch up with him instead. 

I tried to explain it's not about who I'd rather spend time with, but rather that I don't want to put my bf in a weird situation. Matt said that he hopes I'm not killing my friendships, because of my relationship.
 
I get where Matt is coming from, that we don't get to hang out very often, but I also feel like it doesn't have to be a movie night at his house just the two of us. I think it's reasonable to feel weird about leaving my bf alone at my parents house for extensive amounts of time and therefore want to seek out compromise.

PROLOGUE

The old woman moved around the younger woman like a withered wraith in the mist of smoke. She seemed lost in the strange words she recited, like a child hoping to memorize something before an exam.

On the floor Hazel breathed in the heady scent of incense. Her flesh had become numb to the cold tiles which had bristled against her naked back and buttocks when she first lay down an hour ago. She was within a circle of cracked egg shells the faith healer had scattered about, one of several eccentricities the ritual apparently demanded.

Her eyes were closed against the stinging smoke and Constance’s pale stake of naked flesh. The smoke and words tendrilled into her consciousness. Hazel felt herself billow along on the rumble of Constance's words, a ceaseless deep gurgling torrent punctuated by shrill peaks that emerged from the flow seamlessly without interrupting it. It almost seemed as if two voices were harmonizing from different ends of the spectrum.

She concentrated on the flow, latched onto a motif and followed it as it repeated, becoming both itself and its memory in a hypnotic cycle, slowly morphing over time to a new pattern borne on the guttural stream.  

Suddenly the chanting stopped. The silence that followed was stark as a precipice.  

Hazel flinched as an ice-cold hand pressed against her stomach. Her eyes shot open. Constance was hunkered down over her, legs either side, pressing the palm of her hand deep into the flesh above the groin. The old woman’s eyes were open, revealing only the whites. The unseeing cragged face was curtained by long strands of grey frizz, her small breasts sagged into flat triangles.

Hazel shuttered the sight with her eyelids. Constance’s chanting grew faster, louder, till it turned into grunting. It was like she was evacuating something from within herself.

Hazel drew in rapid breaths; the smoke trickled against the back of her throat. Her heart beat faster, harmonizing to the rhythm of Constance’s cacophony.

The grunting stopped and Hazel heard the phlegmy clearing of mucous, the gargling of spittle. The sound of spitting, and a wet sensation around her vagina. Dapples of damp down her thighs.

*What is this?* Hazel thought in a wave of shock.

Constance pressed her hand deeper into Hazel’s stomach, massaging it, kneading it. Hazel felt a pin prick of pain inside her, followed by an electric tingle emanating from that spot that travelled through her body. Her body was suffused with a warm hazy glow.

Constance started up chanting again. Loud and almost like a growl. The old woman’s black labrador Pooka howled from outside as if in chorus with her.

Constance withdrew her hand. Hazel heard her tread around her a few more times, the growl relenting and softening until it fell back into a chant. It became softer and lower still till it receded to a faint whisper, drowned by the dog’s barking, till the dog too stopped as if part of the performance.

Hazel heard the flick of the light switch, the door opening. 

Then Constance’s voice: “You can get dressed.”

Hazel got up after she heard the door closed. She examined the room around her. The cracked egg shells around the chalk circle. The candle flames still flickering, dried wax guttered down their sides. The silver incense burner smouldering the last bits. She felt chilled all of a sudden, like the cold she should have felt over the last however long it was had been stored up to be released all at once. 

She shivered, dressed quickly and went outside. Constance was back in her tatty old jeans and jumper, sipping tea on the couch. There was a steaming cup prepared for Hazel on the coffee table too. Hazel sat down, cupped it between her hands, felt the warm ceramic on her hands and sipped the warmth inside. She slowly felt herself coming back to her normal senses.

“It’s done now. We will wait and see,” said Constance.

They drank in silence.

After a while, Constance got up, moved to the window, drew back the curtain and peered outside. Dusk had fallen and Joachim sat in the driver's seat, face framed with spectral light as he read something on his phone.

“Shall we bring Joachim in?” Constance asked.

Hazel suddenly felt self-conscious. After what she'd been through, it would feel weird to bring him in and adopt the trappings of normality again so casually. She shook her head. Constance nodded agreeably. As if she'd passed some test.

“You two will have a lot to talk about very soon.”

I've been single for a couple of years after being in relationships since I was 29. I find online dating to be frustrating currently, because they give you so little space to really describe yourself! A handful of pictures, maybe a few short blurbs about your hobbies (or a few sentences), and that's it. So, after stumbling on this subreddit, I thought I'd give something different a shot.

I'm white, 38, 5'11 and 175lbs with brown hair and a beard. I wear glasses and I'm practically blind without them. I live and work downtown. My current job involves a bit of travel, but nothing excessive, and overall I now have an amazing work-life balance with low stress. 

I've got a variety of hobbies. I'm a fan of soccer, in particular EPL, and try to watch at least one game a week (time permitting). I love to travel, but I'm not really an all-inclusive / beach person. I much prefer actively visiting historical sites, museums, food tours, nature preserves, etc. I'm fond of camping and hiking, in either the early spring or late summer/fall (the bugs eat me alive if I go anywhere in Ontario in the summer). I'm a fan of the arts, in particular live theatre (Fringe festival is my favourite time of year in Toronto), live music (mostly metal and classical), and live comedy (improv more than standup). I enjoy going to the ROM and AGO, and smaller museums. I'm a foodie and I'm always down to try new restaurants (Japanese, Korean, and Chinese are my favourites).

For quieter hobbies, I'm into tabletop and board games, and video games. I follow a number of different podcasts, like OSPod, Sounds like a Cult, and Moviestruck. I'm a voracious reader; mostly science fiction, fantasy, and history, although I will dabble in other genres when something appeals to me. I will watch a variety of TV shows, although I'm not really a fan of reality TV. Movies I'm down for pretty much anything, although my favourites by far are Horror and Action (especially older martial arts films).

My friends would describe me as thoughtful, caring, considerate, and contemplative. I'm quiet, but not because I'm shy, rather because I prefer to listen. I think things through before I respond. But on the right topic I will absolutely talk your ear off.

If you've made it this far, you're wondering what am I looking for? A long term partner, but not keen to rush things. I'd rather spend quality time together through our shared hobbies and interests, and learning about what you enjoy in the hobbies and interests we don't share! We can chat for a bit on here, and then grab a coffee or tea in person and see where things go. ",2,1761923974.0,r4rToronto_Clean,1,1.0,False

My background is in alternative assets and in case you didn't know, many, MANY private equity and VC firms post job vacancies for their portfolio companies - these range wildly in terms of skills required, pay, etc. For example, if a PE firm acquires a chain of coffee shops, they may need to hire everyone from a shift manager to the global head of marketing. If you haven't already, it's worth it to check out the areers page on PE and VC sites. A quick search of some big names will yeild big results. For example, Bessemer Ventures has more than 5,000 vacancies across their portfolio companies, TA Associates has more than 3,000.  Live in a small town in the midwest? No problem! These managers own companies in every pocket of the world - there is likely a vacancy near you.

I (29F) have been giving my coworker “Jess” a ride to work for about six months. She doesn’t drive, and the bus route is awful. It was on my way, so I didn’t mind at first.

But lately, she’s been treating me like her personal chauffeur. She asks me to pick her up earlier so she can grab coffee, to stop at the pharmacy after work, even asked if I could “swing by” her boyfriend’s place one morning, which was 25 minutes out of the way.

I said no, and she got snippy, saying I “used to be nice” and that “it’s not that deep.”

So last week, I told her I can’t give her rides anymore. She huffed and said she’d “figure something out,” but now she’s gossiping at work that I’m “unreliable.”

Our manager even asked me what happened, like I’m the problem.

My best friend “Tina” (32F) has a 6-year-old son. She brought him to my apartment last week because she had a quick errand nearby.

I asked Tina to please pay for a replacement since they’re prescription and not cheap. She said, “They’re just glasses. It’s not like he did it on purpose.”

I said that doesn’t really matter, they’re still broken. She said she “doesn’t have the money right now” and implied that if I “cared about the friendship,” I’d let it go.

I told her I can’t afford to let a $300 mistake go. She’s been cold ever since, telling mutual friends I “care more about money than people.”

Good morning fellow enthusiasts. The decision has been made to sell my 4V BW. It saddens me but I think it’s going to be the right decision. This car has been a dream of mine for awhile. And I have been able to obtain it and am very grateful. But life is life and I need to move on.

I bought the car in July of this year and have barely put 2300 miles on it. It is a 2025 Petit Pataud. They are the special edition. 1of50. This one being #6 it has had 2 oil changes already. One free one at the dealer at 1k miles. And the other by myself at 2110 miles.

The reality is I do not enjoy the car like I thought I would. Don’t get me wrong this is an incredible machine. And I love everything about it. From the way it shifts. To the way it turns heads. To the breath taking sounds it makes when you down shift. It is a head turner everywhere. Especially in this paint combo. The reason I say I don’t enjoy it is because it is anxiety inducing. I can’t get over the fact of how nice the car is. Every time I am behind the wheel I baby it. I’m like the 60 year old corvette owners. Who get their cars outta the garage to cruise to cars and coffee 10 MPH under the speed limit.

I don’t use this car how GM made it to be used. I will never track it. And I will never romp on it. The truth is I am getting older. And I thought this car would be like how I was in my 20s. Where I just cruise around all the time and work on my car. Well this car needs nothing as it’s perfect as is. So I can’t work on it. And I barely cruise around. With a toddler and a wife I just have no time.

I would much rather an enthusiast get this car. And drive the hell outta it. That’s what this car deserves.  Ask any questions you may have.

Car is has 20% ceramic tint up front. 5% ceramic in the back. And the car is fully ceramic coated as of August. None smoker. Never seen rain. I would rate it a 10out of 10. It’s pretty much still brand new. I still have some of the plastics on inside. for loan purposes it’s still considered a new vehicle which is nice.

Im asking 80k OBO. Don’t be afraid to offer. Worst I can say is no. Also if you want more pics. Just ask. I have not had time to even take a proper photo shoot. Which saddens the heck outta me.

We were school friends, basically grew up together. Back then we were kids and used to fight about small things, but even as a teenager she was always kind of toxic. She’d make weird comments about my clothes, body, and basically bully me in front of others.

When we got older, I brought it up once and she brushed it off saying “we both did the same thing.” Which wasn’t true, but I decided to let it go because, fine, we were young and dumb.

Then in 2019, I got into a decent engineering college and she didn’t get into the medical one she was aiming for. I remember consoling her and being super supportive. But soon after, when I was planning to go to my college, she started saying stuff like “why are you going there, private colleges are useless, you should drop a year.” She just kept going on and on about how I was wasting my life. It was mentally exhausting so I eventually blocked her.

A couple of years later, when I was doing really well in college and had a glow-up, I’ll admit I unblocked her just to show her that my life turned out fine. We started talking again. She told me she’d gone through a lot (including an abortion) and I felt bad for her and was supportive.

But honestly, she’s still the most toxic person in my life. She constantly makes fun of the things I like. For example, I love a particular artist and she’ll go out of her way to make jokes about them. She even mocks my city for no reason, even though she literally moved here for college. She always has to poke me about something, and I’m a sensitive person — if someone says something mean, it stays in my head all day.

Earlier this year she came to my city and stayed with me for 3 days. I took her to nice places, she used my expensive body wash and lotion, wore my clothes — I didn’t mind sharing, but she didn’t offer to pay for anything. Not even a coffee or dinner as a thank you. I don’t care about the money, it’s just the gesture.

She came again a couple more times and it was the same story. She’d use my expensive stuff like it was hers, didn’t offer to pay, and I honestly started dreading her visits. I realized I was uncomfortable around someone I called my “best friend.”

Then one day I got really sick, told her about it, and she replied two days later. That was my breaking point. I decided I was done and just stopped talking to her. No explanation, no argument, just ghosted her.

It’s been two months and she still keeps messaging me, sending reels, and asking “are you fine?” or “do you need more time?” I haven’t replied once.

Now I’m feeling a bit guilty because we’ve known each other for 10 years. Ghosting someone that long-term feels harsh. But at the same time, I’ve spent years dealing with her disrespect and I don’t have the energy to explain for the hundredth time why her behavior bothers me.

1okx50z,https://i.redd.it/3vsgf5xiqgyf1.png,My Billionaire Husband's Web Of Lies,"My Billionaire Husband's Web Of Lies

I was the anchor for my tech billionaire husband, Killian-the only person who could ground his chaotic soul.



But when my brother was dying, Killian gave the life-saving funds to his mi\*\*ress for a multi-million dollar cat sanctuary.



After my brother died, he left me bl\*\*ding in a car wreck to save her.



The final betrayal came when I tried to file for divorce and discovered our entire marriage was a lie, the certificate a carefully crafted forgery.



He had built my world on a foundation of deceit to ensure I could never leave, never have anything of my own.



So I called the one man I'd rejected years ago and began my plan to burn his empire to the ground.





Chapter 1

Emily POV:



They say every monster has a weakness. For the tech world's most brilliant and volatile monster, Killian Emerson, that weakness was supposed to be me. I was his anchor, the only person who could tether his chaotic soul to the ground. That was the story we told ourselves, the myth that built his empire and my entire world.



Until it wasn't my world anymore.



The rumors had been swirling for months, whispers in the gilded cages of high society, headlines on gossip sites I never read but were sent to me by ""concerned"" friends. Killian, who once bought an entire island because I mentioned I liked the color of its sand, was now seen everywhere with Dallas Lucas.



Dallas. The name itself felt like acid on my tongue. She was a social media heiress, famous for being famous, and my personal high school nightmare. She was the reason for the faint, silvery scar on my wrist, a constant reminder of a pain I thought I had buried.



And Killian, my Killian, was utterly captivated by her.



The first public blow was a charity gala. He was supposed to be my date. I waited for three hours in a gown he'd had custom-made for me, only to see a photo flash across my phone: Killian, his hand possessively on the small of Dallas's back, her head thrown back in laughter. The caption read: Tech Titan Killian Emerson and Influencer Dallas Lucas make a stunning debut.



My debut was a quiet taxi ride home, the silk of the gown feeling like a shroud.



Then came the smaller, sharper cuts. He started canceling our weekly dinners, the one sacred tradition we'd kept since we were broke and sharing a single slice of pizza. His texts became shorter, his calls less frequent. He was a ghost in our sprawling minimalist mansion, his side of the bed perpetually cold.



Dallas, meanwhile, was relentless. She sent me DMs of her wearing my favorite brand of lingerie, tagging the location as Killian's private jet. She ""accidentally"" mailed a package to our home containing a framed photo of her and Killian, a ridiculously in\*\*mate selfie. Each act was a carefully sharpened knife, designed to twist in the wound of my insecurity.



But the act that shattered everything, the one that turned my grief into something cold and hard and vengeful, had nothing to do with me.



It had to do with Leo.



My younger brother, my bright, hopeful Leo, was dying. A rare genetic disorder was systematically shutting down his body, but a new experimental treatment offered a sliver of hope. It was astronomically expensive, requiring resources and connections only Killian possessed. He had promised me. He held my face in his hands, looked me in the eyes, and said, ""Emily, I will move heaven and earth for Leo. Whatever it takes.""



I believed him. I clung to that promise like a drowning woman to a life raft.



Last week, Leo's doctor called. There was a window, a critical one. The treatment needed to be funded immediately, the equipment secured within seventy-two hours. I called Killian, my voice trembling with a mixture of fear and hope.



""Killian, it's time. We need the funds. The doctors said-""



""I'm in a meeting, Em,"" he'd cut me off, his voice distant, impatient. I could hear the faint sound of a cat meowing in the background, a sound I knew belonged to the Persian kitten he'd just bought for Dallas. ""I'll look at the email later.""



He never did.



Instead, two days later, a news alert lit up my phone. Killian Emerson's Generosity Knows No Bounds: Tech Billionaire Funds Dallas Lucas's Pet Project, a Multi-Million Dollar Sanctuary for Stray Cats.



The life raft splintered into a million pieces, leaving me to drown in the icy waters of betrayal.



Leo died yesterday.



Now, sitting on the cold floor of his empty hospital room, the sterile smell of antiseptic burning my nostrils, I scrolled through my contacts. My thumb hovered over a name I hadn't dialed in eight years. A number I'd saved on a whim, without a label, just a string of digits that represented a different path, a life not taken.



My fingers trembled as I typed. I need help.



I didn't expect a reply. It was a Hail Mary, a desperate scream into the void.



But less than a minute later, my phone buzzed.



Anything. Tell me where you are. I'll be there.



A single tear, hot and heavy, slid down my cheek and splashed onto the screen. It was a strange and hollow comfort.



I glanced up at the small television mounted in the corner of the room, muted but still playing the 24-hour news cycle. There he was. Killian. He was at a press conference for the cat sanctuary. He was smiling, a rare, genuine smile I hadn't seen in months. He gently pushed a stray strand of hair from Dallas's face, his touch so tender it made my stomach churn.



The chyron at the bottom of the screen read: A New Leash on Life: Dallas Lucas celebrates new beginnings.



My gaze fell to the small, worn wooden music box on the bedside table, the only thing of Leo's I couldn't bear to pack away yet. It played a tinny, off-key version of ""Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star."" Killian had bought it for him.



He'd found it in a dusty pawn shop the year his first big algorithm sold. We were still living in a cramped, one-bedroom apartment over a laundromat that always smelled of damp clothes and bleach. Killian was a ghost then, a brilliant, angry boy who had aged out of the foster system with nothing but the clothes on his back and a fire in his eyes that could burn the world down.



I was a waitress at the diner where he'd sit for hours, nursing a single cup of coffee, sketching complex code on napkins. I started leaving him leftovers, then offered him my couch when he got evicted. I was the first person to believe in him, to see the genius beneath the rage.



We went from sharing a single ramen packet to sharing a portfolio worth billions. Our lives transformed, but the core of our bond, I thought, remained.



""We'll have a family, Em,"" he'd whispered to me one night, years ago, in the steel and glass fortress we now called home. ""A real one. Something neither of us ever had. I'll build a world so safe for you and our kids that nothing can ever touch us.""



That promise now felt like a cruel joke. He was building a world for Dallas, a sanctuary for her cats, while my brother's world had blinked out of existence.



My body shook with a sob that felt like it was being ripped from my very soul. I picked up Leo's music box, its cheap wood cool against my skin, and clutched it to my ch\*\*t.



I opened my phone again, my thumb scrolling numbly through my last text exchange with Killian. My desperate pleas for him to call the hospital, to answer my calls. His replies were sporadic, dismissive.



Busy.



In a meeting.



Can't talk.



Then I saw the date of the news alert about the cat sanctuary. It was our anniversary. The day he had proposed to me on a windswept cliff in Ireland, promising me a lifetime of devotion. He had spent it with her, celebrating her, funding her whims with the money that was supposed to save my brother's life.



The last message I sent him was two days ago. Leo is getting worse. Please, Killian. I need you.



He never replied.





Chapter 2

Emily POV:



It became a grotesque sort of routine. Killian lavishing Dallas with gifts that would make headlines, while I sorted through the mundane artifacts of Leo's short life.



He bought her a custom-painted Rolls-Royce, the exact shade of pink as her favorite lipstick. I paid for Leo's simple wooden casket with my own credit card.



He flew her and twenty of her influencer friends to a private resort in Fiji for an impromptu ""content creation"" week. I drove alone to the windswept coastline to scatter Leo's ashes, the gray urn cold and heavy in my hands.



The funeral was a quiet af\*\*ir, attended by a handful of my friends and Leo's nurses. Killian, of course, was not there. He sent a flower arrangement so large it was obscene, a gaudy monument to his guilt that I had the funeral director throw in the dumpster.



Two days after I watched the last of my brother turn to dust and scatter on the waves, my phone finally rang. It was him.



""Hey,"" he said, his voice casual, as if he were calling to see what I wanted for dinner. ""Sorry about everything. It's been a madhouse here.""



The cold calm that had enveloped me for days cracked. ""A madhouse?"" I repeated, my voice dangerously low. ""Leo is dead, Killian.""



There was a pause. ""I know, Em. I'm really sorry to hear that. I was going to call, but-""



""But you were too busy funding a feline paradise?"" The words were ice. ""That money, Killian. That was Leo's only chance.""



""Emily, be reasonable,"" he started, his tone shifting to the one he used when placating a difficult board member. ""The doctors said it was experimental. There were no guarantees. The sanctuary, on the other hand, is a guaranteed PR win, and Dallas was so pa\*\*ionate about it.""



My bl\*\*d ran cold. He was comparing my brother's life to a public relations strategy.



Then, I heard it. A soft, feminine giggle in the background. ""Killy, darling, are you done yet? You promised we'd go ring shopping.""



Dallas.



That single, carefree sound was the final detonation. It blew away any lingering sentiment, any shred of the love I once felt for him. There was nothing left but scorched earth.



I ended the call without another word.



My hands moved with a strange, detached purpose. I walked to the safe hidden behind a Rothko painting in our bedroom and pulled out a thick manila envelope. Inside was a document I'd almost forgotten about. Divorce papers. He'd had his lawyers draw them up when we got married, a pre-nup of sorts.  ""Just in case,""  he'd said with a sad smile,  ""I ever become the kind of monster who deserves to lose you."" 



My signature on the dotted line was steady and clear. Emily Ramos. A name that suddenly felt like my own again.



I sent a photo of the signed document to the number Josiah had given me, a contact for a discreet but notoriously ruthless family lawyer in London. Can you file this for me?



The reply was instantaneous. Consider it done. A car will be waiting for you at 7 PM tomorrow. It will take you to a private airfield.



With that settled, a strange sense of emptiness propelled me out of the house. There were a few things of Leo's still at our old apartment, the one over the laundromat. Childhood drawings, his first teddy bear. I couldn't leave them behind.



The neighborhood was even more dilapidated than I remembered, the streetlights flickering over cracked pavement. As I turned the corner onto our old street, my heart stopped. Parked directly under the window of our first home was a car I knew better than my own: Killian's one-of-a-kind, matte black Maybach.



What was he doing here?



I ducked behind a row of overflowing dumpsters, the sour smell of ga\*\*age filling my lungs. The interior light of the car was on, and I could see them clearly. Killian and Dallas. Her back was pressed against the passenger door, and he was leaning over her, his mouth on hers, his hand tangled in her blonde hair.



It was a raw, hungry k\*\*s, and it was happening in the place where he had first told me he loved me.



A wave of nausea washed over me, so strong I had to press my hand against my mouth to keep from being sick. I squeezed my eyes shut, but the image was burned onto the inside of my eyelids.



When I opened them again, they had broken apart. Dallas was running her perfectly manicured nails down his ch\*\*t. ""I still don't get why you brought me to this dump, Killy,"" she pouted.



Killian's voice was a low rumble, filled with an affection that used to be reserved for me. ""Patience, my love."" He gestured out the window, at the crumbling brick buildings, at the life we had built from nothing. ""In six months, none of this will be here. My company just acquired this entire block. We're tearing it all down to build the new Emerson Tower. And the penthouse, the one with the 360-degree view of the city? It's all yours.""



The air left my lungs. He was going to bulldoze our history. He was going to erase the very foundation of us and build a monument to her on its ruins, and he hadn't even bothered to tell me.



My grief and rage coalesced into a single, desperate impulse: to run. I scrambled backward, my foot catching on a loose piece of metal. It clattered loudly against the pavement, the sound echoing like a gunshot in the silent street.



Inside the Maybach, the pa\*\*ionate scene froze. Two heads turned, and a pair of blindingly bright headlights swiveled directly towards the dumpsters, pinning me in their unforgiving glare.





Chapter 3

Emily POV:



Killian's gaze, once a warm embrace, was now as cold and sharp as splintered ice. He stared into the darkness where I was frozen, his expression unreadable but radiating a dangerous stillness.



Instinctively, he pulled away from Dallas, his body tensing like a predator that had scented a threat. He squinted, his eyes adjusting to the gloom beyond the headlights' glare.



""Emily?""



His voice was a low growl of disbelief. He pushed open the car door, the expensive mechanism sighing softly in the quiet street. He walked towards me, his tailored suit a stark contrast to the grime of the alley.



""What are you doing here?"" he asked, his tone a strange mixture of concern and irritation. ""It's not safe.""



""What are you doing here, Killian?"" I shot back, my voice shaking with a rage I hadn't known I possessed. I pushed myself up, brushing the dirt from my jeans.



Before he could answer, Dallas emerged from the car, wrapping a silk scarf around her neck. She glided to Killian's side, linking her arm through his.



""Oh, Emily, it's you,"" she said, her voice dripping with cloying sweetness. ""Killy was just showing me where he grew up. It's so… rustic."" She looked at me, her eyes wide with feigned innocence. ""I'm so sorry about what happened between us in high school. I was just a silly, jealous girl. I hope you can forgive me.""



""Don't,"" I snapped, cutting through her performance. ""Just don't, Dallas.""



Her facade crumbled for a second, a flicker of triumph in her eyes before she buried her face in Killian's ch\*\*t, her shoulders starting to shake with manufactured sobs. ""I'm sorry,"" she whimpered into his expensive suit. ""I'm just trying to make things right.""



Killian's arms went around her instantly, pulling her close, st\*\*king her hair. He looked over her head at me, his brow furrowed with disappointment. ""Emily, that's enough. She's trying to apologize.""



The injustice of it all was a physical blow. My heart, which I thought had already been shattered, seemed to break all over again. Him. Defending her.



My mind flashed back to high school. To Dallas and her friends cornering me in the locker room, their laughter echoing off the tiled walls as they held me down. Dallas, with a smug smile, had used a compass needle to carve a word into the soft skin of my wrist: Worthless.



The physical wound had healed into a faint, silvery line, but the emotional one had festered for years. I had hidden it, ashamed, until I met Killian. He'd been the one to gently take my hand, trace the scar with his thumb, his eyes dark with a protective fury.



""Who did this to you?"" he had demanded, his voice a low growl.



When I whispered her name, he had made a vow. ""I will ruin her, Emily. For you. I will make her pay for every tear you shed.""



It was a promise he never kept. Instead, he had fallen for the very monster he had sworn to slay. The irony was so bitter it felt like poison.



""Emily?"" Killian's voice pulled me back to the present. He was looking at me with that familiar impatient frown. ""Are you just going to stand there?"" He gestured towards the Maybach. ""Get in the car. We'll take you home.""



""Oh, yes, please come with us,"" Dallas chimed in, lifting her tear-streaked face from his ch\*\*t. Her eyes, however, were cold and sharp with victory. ""We can all be friends."" She stepped towards me, her hand outstretched as if to help me up.



As she reached for my arm, her perfectly manicured fingers dug into the sensitive skin around my old scar. It was a small, almost imperceptible movement, but the sharp sting of her nails was deliberate, a cruel, private message just for me.



A g\*\*p of pain escaped my lips, and I jerked my arm back. The sudden movement made Dallas lose her balance. She stumbled backward with a theatrical cry, collapsing onto the grimy pavement in a heap of designer clothes and feigned distress.



Killian's reaction was instantaneous. He saw her fall, saw me pull away, and his mind, clouded by his infatuation, drew the only conclusion it could.



He thought I had pushed her.





Chapter 4

Emily POV:



""Dallas!"" Killian's voice was laced with panic. He rushed to her side, dropping to his knees on the filthy ground without a second thought for his thousand-dollar suit. ""Are you okay? Did she hurt you?""



He gently cradled her face in his hands, his thumbs st\*\*king her cheeks as he scanned her for any injury. With a tenderness that felt like a physical assault on my own heart, he took out a silk handkerchief and began dabbing at a speck of dirt on her coat, his touch infinitely more careful than any he had shown me in months.



Dallas looked up at him, her eyes wide and glistening with unshed tears. She peeked at me from under her lashes, a tiny, triumphant smirk playing on her lips for a fraction of a second before she replaced it with a look of pure terror. ""I... I'm okay, Killy. I just... I startled her.""



Killian helped her to her feet, his arm securely around her waist. Once he was sure she was unharmed, he rounded on me. His face was a thundercloud of fury.



""What is wrong with you, Emily?"" he snarled, his voice a low, dangerous growl. ""I know you don't like her, but to physically attack her? After all these years, you're still holding onto some st\*\*id high school grudge?""



""A st\*\*id grudge?"" I choked out, the words catching in my throat. He was trivializing the trauma that had shaped my teenage years, defending the person who had inflicted it. ""She tormented me, Killian! She scarred me!""



""It was high school, Emily! Kids are cruel. She's apologized. You need to let it go,"" he said, dismissing my pain with a wave of his hand. It was as if he'd completely forgotten his own promise to make her pay.



Dallas, ever the actress, placed a gentle hand on Killian's arm. ""Don't be angry with her, Killy. It's my fault. I shouldn't have pushed her to be friends so soon."" Her eyes met mine over his shoulder, and they were gleaming with malicious glee.



I ignored them both, my gaze fixed on the ground where a small, cardboard box had fallen from my bag. It held the few precious things of Leo's I'd come to retrieve. I bent down, my hands shaking, and began to gather the scattered drawings.



""Here, let me help,"" Dallas cooed, stepping forward. She knelt beside me, her movements graceful and poised. She reached for a small, hand-painted clay bird, one of the last things Leo had made in his hospital art therapy class.



Her fingers closed around it, and then, as her eyes met mine, she deliberately tightened her grip.



Crack.



The sound of the fragile clay shattering was louder than a gunshot in the tense silence. The painted bird, Leo's last creation, crumbled into dust and fragments in her palm.



Something inside me snapped. A primal scream of rage and grief tore from my throat. I lunged at her, my vision blurring with tears. ""You monster!""



I never reached her.



Killian moved faster than I could have imagined. His hand shot out, grabbing my arm not to stop me, but to shove me away from Dallas. The force of the push sent me stumbling backward. My heel caught on the uneven pavement, and I fell hard, landing amidst the scattered remnants of my brother's memories.



A sharp, searing pain shot up my arm as it hit the curb. I cried out, cradling my wrist, the skin already blooming into an ugly purple bruise.



""Have you lost your mind?"" Killian roared, his face contorted with rage. He stood protectively in front of Dallas, completely ignoring the fact that I was hurt. ""It was an accident! It's just a st\*\*id clay bird!""



""It was Leo's,"" I whispered, the words ragged. ""He made it for me. It was the last thing he ever made.""



Killian's anger faltered for a second, but then his jaw tightened. ""I'll buy you a hundred of them. A thousand. I'll commission a famous artist to make you one out of solid gold if you'll just stop this ridiculous drama.""



He didn't remember. He didn't remember Leo proudly showing it to him on FaceTime, his weak voice full of joy. He didn't remember promising Leo he'd put it on his desk at the office. He had forgotten. It was just a thing to him, easily replaceable with money.



All the fight drained out of me, replaced by a profound, soul-crushing exhaustion. There was no point. He wouldn't understand. He couldn't.



I slowly, painfully, got to my feet, my bruised wrist throbbing in time with my shattered heart. I didn't even look at them. I just turned and started walking away, down the dark, empty street.



""Emily, wait!"" Killian called after me. ""Don't be childish! Get in the car!""



The Maybach pulled up beside me, its engine a low purr. He leaned across the passenger seat, his face set in a stubborn scowl. ""I'm not leaving you here. Get in.""



I didn't have the strength to argue. Numbly, I opened the back door and slid onto the plush leather seat.



Dallas was in the front, of course. The car filled with her cloying perfume and the sound of her soft voice as she recounted some trivial celebrity gossip to Killian. He responded with low murmurs of interest, his eyes meeting hers in the rearview mirror. I was invisible, a ghost in the backseat of my own life.



My mind replayed a highlight reel of Dallas's cruelty since she'd re-entered our lives. The dead rat she'd had delivered to my doorstep. The anonymous emails sent to Killian containing old, embarrassing photos of me from my high school yearbook. The ""accidental"" spilling of red w\*\*e on the dress my mother had worn at her wedding, which I had been saving. Each incident had been dismissed by Killian as a misunderstanding or a prank. His blindness wasn't an accident; it was a choice.



A sudden, violent screech of tires tore through the night, yanking me from my miserable thoughts. I looked up just in time to see the blinding headlights of a massive truck barreling towards us from a side street, its horn blaring a deafening, terrifying warning.

1okx1mr,https://www.reddit.com/r/cfs/comments/1okx1mr/people_being_kind_about_my_diagnosis/,People being kind about my diagnosis,"I’ve got to be one of the luckiest people who has this thing because people are kind to me.

I’m quite young to have ME (since I was a teenager basically) so it does surprise a lot of people when I say I can’t, for example, run, or cycle, or be out late or do lots of physical activity because I’m quite young and  otherwise able bodied. A lot of older people ask to clarify how old I am next because they are surprised. 

It also doesn’t help that as a person I’m quite sunny if that makes sense? People find it quite annoyingbut I’m often smiling, in a good mood, etc. If people aren’t surprised at my age they are surprised I have it at all. They don’t see the crashing or the symptoms, so they just don’t believe me, really. How can someone like you have it? No way are you tired all the time! 

When I got diagnosed the woman took a very detailed history of it all, spanning from symptom onset. It was a lot of talking and I had a strong coffee before and still fell asleep after. I think I was talking about how it affected my life; she asked, and I told her I genuinely didn’t know, because I got CFS when I was 13! My frame of reference was when I was 12! So I couldn’t confidently say I went out with my friends less or I would have been more social. I don’t know that for sure. This is just my life. 

 I stopped myself in the middle, and paused, and went “well. I really hope you believe me. Lots of people don’t.” 

Without missing a beat she looked up, and went, “I believe you.” 

It meant a lot. I think to date she’s the only person to have said that to me like that.

I think a mix of the fact I got CFS young, it is quite mild, I started pacing early and that I have had good luck with medication means I’m privileged enough to do a lot more than I used to be able to. I was seeing someone about my occupational health today; in other words, just going over my diagnoses and what accommodations they may recommend. 

She asked me lots of questions, and listened to the answers. She already knew what ME was, she knew what PEM was. I was struggling to explain what I meant when I said cardio or things that require lots of exertion, even for really short periods, can completely make me crash; she very politely asked if I’d term that high impact exercise and made a note for me. I explained the accommodations I made myself and she agreed that I had a handle on pacing and that I was proactively managing it, which I really appreciated. She also explained what accommodations I’d be entitled to in the far future, and explained that they’d reassess me as needed, which was very thoughtful because my capacity has changed a lot since I got sick. 

I don’t know if it’s childhood trauma but I really expect everyone to be cruel. The disability services in my school were lovely; I had no clue what accommodation I could ask for, so without asking she gave me a blanket note that allows sick days without doctor’s notes because it’s obviously very hard to crawl into the doctor’s office during a crash. The person who manages disability on my specific course has a husband with ME and empathised a lot with me about struggling to manage it and pacing. 

Not that everyone has been nice. But a number of people have been, and I like thinking about them more than the ones who are not nice.

1okwz22,https://www.reddit.com/r/BetterAtPeople/comments/1okwz22/dont_forget_that_social_anxiety_is_your_chance/,Don't forget that social anxiety is your chance for a confidence win,"Social anxiety isn’t rare. It’s everywhere. You see it in the person who overthinks what to say in a group chat, who replays every sentence said at yesterday’s coffee meetup, who walks into a room and immediately looks for the quietest corner. And yet, the internet is flooded with TikTok “confidence coaches” who scream “Just be confident!” like it's a light switch. Most of them have zero training in psychology. They just want views.

But social anxiety isn’t about being shy. It’s a neurobiological response tied to evolutionary survival systems. We’re wired to fear social rejection because, back in the day, being kicked out of the group literally meant death. Today it just feels like it. And while that sucks, here's the plot twist: social anxiety can be one of the most powerful tools for growth. If you learn to manage it right, it becomes a daily playground for leveling up confidence.

This isn’t from a single source. This is from peer-reviewed psych research, leading cognitive science books, and expert podcasts that break it all down. Here’s everything that actually helps ,  no BS, no generic “face your fears” advice.

Let’s dive in.

**Why social anxiety can actually be a superpower, if used right**

- People with social anxiety are often hyper-aware and observant. Dr. Ellen Hendriksen, author of *How to Be Yourself*, explains that socially anxious people tend to have high social intelligence,  they just overuse it.
- According to a meta-analysis published in *Current Psychiatry Reports*, those with social anxiety often score higher on traits like empathy and conscientiousness. That’s not a flaw. That’s a feature.
- This sensitivity means you're constantly scanning for patterns, energy shifts reactions. With training, that awareness can evolve into social mastery.

**Tools that actually work (and are backed by behavioral science)**

- *Cognitive defusion techniques*: From ACT therapy (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy), this is about separating yourself from your thoughts. When your mind says “Everyone’s judging me,” you reply, “Thanks, brain. That’s a story you’re telling again.” It creates space so you’re not fused with that fear.
- *Exposure with intention*: Gradual, not forced. Stanford professor Dr. Philippe Goldin ran fMRI studies showing that repeated, structured exposure rewires the brain’s fear circuits. It’s not about flooding. It’s about micro-bravery moments,  small social risks you take daily, like asking for directions or making eye contact just 1 second longer.
- *Pre-event planning*: Social neuroscience researcher Matthew Lieberman found that when people write down their fears before a stressful event, their amygdala (fear center) calms down. Try journaling 5 minutes before a social scenario. It helps regulate your emotional response.

**Podcasts that go way deeper than surface confidence tips**

- *The Huberman Lab Podcast*: Dr. Andrew Huberman breaks down the neuroscience of fear, stress, and confidence. His episode on “How to rewire your brain for confidence” is packed with actionable biology-backed tips.
- *Ten Percent Happier with Dan Harris*: Especially episodes with meditation teachers and psychologists who cover self-acceptance and fear of judgment. These aren't woo-woo. They’re practical and research-grounded.

**YouTube channels that don’t make you feel bad for being quiet**

- *Therapy in a Nutshell*: Run by a licensed therapist, this channel covers anxiety, self-worth, and how to reframe fear. Her videos on “What to do when you feel socially awkward” are gold.
- *Struthless*: A creative channel that covers identity, self-expression, and how to embrace your weird. Not made for extroverts. Made for real humans.

**Life-changing books for social anxiety and confidence building**

- *How to Be Yourself* by Ellen Hendriksen, PhD: This book made me angry I hadn’t read it sooner. She’s a clinical psychologist from Harvard Medical School and explains how social anxiety isn’t about being broken,  it’s about misinterpreting fear signals. This is hands-down the best book for anyone who wants to stop overanalyzing every interaction and actually show up. Feels like having a therapist in your pocket.
- *The Courage to Be Disliked* by Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga: This bestseller from Japan (over 3.5 million copies sold) teaches Adlerian psychology through dialogues that make you question your need for approval. It’s deep, weird, and insanely good. This book will make you rethink every “what if they judge me?” thought.
- *Presence* by Amy Cuddy: Yes, she’s the “power pose” TED speaker. But the book goes way beyond that. It’s about how to embody confidence even when your brain is panicking. It’s rooted in behavioral science and social psychology. Not motivational fluff.

**Apps that help rewire your anxiety brain in small, daily ways**

- Insight Timer: A free meditation app with guided sessions specifically for social fear, self-compassion, and confidence. Great for pre-event calming and daily grounding work.
- BeFreed: This is an AI-powered learning app built by a Columbia University team. It turns expert-backed content,  books, psych research, interviews into a personalized audio learning plan based on your goals. You can choose your podcast length, tone, and even build your learning roadmap over time. It’s perfect if you’re working on overcoming social fears, building confidence, or just want to go deeper into behavioral psychology without reading 30 books. It also covers all the books and resources I mentioned above, so you can learn on the go.

**Quick daily practices that seriously build confidence**

- *The 3-second rule*: If you think about saying something or doing something socially, act within 3 seconds. Past that, your brain talks you out of it. This behavioral hack is used in exposure therapy for a reason.
- *Name it to tame it*: Label your anxiety out loud or in your head. “This is social fear kicking in.” Naming the emotion activates your prefrontal cortex and reduces the intensity. UCLA studies confirm this works.
- *Confidence journaling*: Write one social win per day, no matter how small. “I asked a follow-up question.” “I held eye contact.” Over time this creates a bank of proof that you are not socially broken,  you’re improving.

Social anxiety isn’t a flaw. It’s a nervous system doing its job a little too well. But when you learn to work with it, not against it, it becomes one of the best teachers for confidence, self-awareness, and emotional growth.

This is where the win happens.

**Queens Voice** 

**October 31, 2025**



**QUEENS NEWS** \- If it feels like your money isn’t stretching as far as it used to, you’re not imagining things. Groceries cost more, rent keeps climbing, and even that morning coffee seems to have gotten pricier. That’s inflation at work — the slow (and sometimes not-so-slow) rise in prices that quietly eats away at your purchasing power.



We’ve all felt the pinch lately. Whether you’re trying to keep your family budget on track, save for a big goal, or just make ends meet, inflation can make it feel like you’re swimming against the current. The good news? You don’t have to just ride it out and hope for the best. There are smart, practical steps you can take right now to protect your finances and stay ahead of rising costs.



In this article, we’ll walk through five simple but powerful strategies to help you deal with inflation — from adjusting your budget and tackling debt, to making smarter investments and boosting your earning power. You don’t need a finance degree or a six-figure salary to make these work — just a willingness to take a fresh look at how you manage your money.





Ready to stretch your dollars a little further and feel more in control again? Let’s dive in.



**1. Rework Your Budget to Match New Realities**



When prices go up, your old budget stops working — plain and simple. What used to cover a week’s worth of groceries might only last five days now. And that “extra” money you thought you had at the end of the month? It might have quietly disappeared into higher bills or fuel costs.









That’s why the first step in dealing with inflation is to revisit your budget. Think of it like giving your finances a health check-up. You don’t need to overhaul everything overnight, but you *do* need to make sure your money is being spent on what actually matters most right now.



Start by tracking your expenses for a month. It might sound tedious, but it’s eye-opening. Use a budgeting app like Mint, YNAB (You Need a Budget), or even a simple spreadsheet. Seeing where your cash is going — every coffee, every subscription, every takeout order — helps you spot leaks you didn’t know existed.



Next, separate your “needs” from your “wants.” Needs are your essentials: rent or mortgage, groceries, utilities, transportation, healthcare. Wants are the nice-to-haves: streaming services, takeout dinners, impulse online buys. During inflation, it’s okay to press pause on some wants so your needs stay fully covered.



Also, adjust your budget categories to reflect reality. Maybe groceries need a little more room while entertainment gets trimmed. The goal isn’t to cut out fun entirely — it’s to make sure you’re spending intentionally, not automatically.



And here’s a pro tip: build in a little buffer. Prices fluctuate, and having even a small cushion (say, 5–10% of your monthly spending) helps absorb surprises without blowing your whole plan.



Reworking your budget isn’t about restriction — it’s about *control*. Once you know exactly where your money’s going, you’ll feel less stressed and better prepared for whatever inflation throws your way next.



**2. Pay Down High-Interest Debt**



If there’s one thing inflation and rising interest rates *love* to do, it’s team up and make debt even more painful. When prices go up, central banks often raise interest rates to cool things down — and that means credit cards, personal loans, and variable-rate debts suddenly start costing you more.



In other words, if you’re carrying high-interest debt right now, it’s time to make it a top priority.



Start by listing out all your debts — how much you owe, what the interest rate is, and what the minimum payments are. Then, tackle the ones with the highest interest rates first. This is called the avalanche method, and it saves you the most money in the long run because you stop paying so much in interest.



If you’ve got multiple balances, consider consolidating them into a lower-rate loan or transferring your credit card balance to a 0% promo card (just make sure you pay it off before the promo period ends!). Refinancing or locking in a fixed-rate loan can also protect you from future rate hikes.



And most importantly — try not to take on new high-interest debt unless it’s absolutely necessary. Inflation makes everything pricier, but adding more monthly payments on top only makes it harder to keep up.



Think of it this way: every dollar you free up from interest payments is a dollar you can put toward something that actually benefits you — like savings, investments, or even just breathing room in your budget.



So, before you look for new ways to grow your money, make sure you’re not letting high-interest debt quietly eat it away. 



Paying down debt might not feel exciting, but it’s one of the safest, smartest inflation-fighting moves you can make.



**3. Invest in Inflation-Resilient Assets**



Let’s be real — when inflation is high, just saving money in a regular bank account can feel like trying to hold water in your hands. Prices go up, but your savings don’t. Over time, the money sitting in your account actually *loses* buying power. That’s why it’s so important to look at investing as part of your inflation game plan.



Now, don’t worry — you don’t need to become a day trader or gamble your savings on risky bets. The key is to put your money into assets that tend to grow faster than inflation or at least keep pace with it.



Here are a few places to start:



* Stocks (or index funds): Over the long term, the stock market has historically outpaced inflation. If you’re not already investing, consider low-cost index funds or ETFs that track the broader market. You don’t need to pick individual stocks — the goal is steady growth over time.



* Real estate: Property values and rents often rise along with inflation, which makes real estate a solid hedge. Even if you’re not buying a home or investment property, you can look into REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) to get real estate exposure without needing to be a landlord.



* TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities): These government bonds are designed specifically to protect against inflation. Their value adjusts with inflation, so your purchasing power stays more stable.



* Commodities and precious metals: Gold, silver, and even commodities like oil or agricultural products can sometimes rise when inflation does — though they can be a bit more volatile.



Whatever you do, don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification is your best friend here. A balanced mix of investments helps smooth out the ups and downs while keeping your long-term goals in focus.





And remember: the worst time to make investment decisions is when you’re panicking. Inflation can make people rush into “hot tips” or risky trends (crypto, meme stocks — you name it), but slow and steady almost always wins the race.



The bottom line? Inflation may chip away at cash, but with the right investments, you can make your money work harder — and protect your future purchasing power in the process.



**4. Boost Your Earning Power**



Cutting costs can only take you so far — there’s a limit to how much you can save, but there’s *no limit* to how much you can earn. When prices are climbing, one of the best defenses against inflation is simply to make more money. Sounds easier said than done, right? But don’t worry — there are real, practical ways to do it.



**Start by looking at your current job.**

  
When was the last time you got a raise? If it’s been a while, inflation gives you a pretty solid reason to ask for one. Do a little research on what people in your role and industry are earning (websites like Glassdoor or Payscale can help), then make your case. Show how you’ve added value or taken on more responsibility — employers are often more open to adjustments when they see clear results.



If that’s not an option, it might be time to look for new opportunities. The job market is constantly shifting, and sometimes a move to a new company can mean a big pay bump.



Next, think about developing new skills — especially ones that are in high demand. Digital skills, project management, trades, or data analysis can all open doors to higher-paying roles. There are tons of free or affordable courses online that can help you level up (sites like Coursera, LinkedIn Learning, and Skillshare are great places to start).



And don’t forget about side hustles. Whether it’s freelancing, tutoring, selling products online, or even monetizing a hobby, extra income can go a long way toward cushioning the blow of rising prices.





Finally, consider passive income — things like dividend-paying investments, rental income, or creating digital products that earn money over time. It takes effort to set up, but it can really pay off down the line.



Here’s the bottom line: You can only cut so much from your budget, but there’s no ceiling on your earning potential. Every new skill, project, or side gig you take on builds your financial resilience — not just against inflation, but against whatever life throws your way.



**5. Shop Smarter and Plan Ahead**



When prices are climbing, every little bit of savings counts — and the good news is, small changes in how you shop can add up faster than you’d think. You don’t have to start clipping coupons like it’s 1995 (unless you want to!), but being a little more strategic with your spending can go a long way toward beating inflation.



Start with the basics: buy in bulk when it makes sense. Non-perishables like rice, pasta, paper products, and canned goods are often cheaper per unit when you buy bigger packages. 



Just make sure you’re stocking up on things you actually use — nobody needs a five-year supply of pickles.



Next, compare prices before you buy. With so many shopping apps and websites out there, it only takes a minute to check if that “sale” is really a deal. Tools like Honey or Rakuten can help you find discounts or earn cashback automatically.



Loyalty programs and store rewards cards can also be a quiet source of savings if you use them strategically. If you shop somewhere often, those points and cashbacks can add up to free groceries or discounts over time.



And here’s a big one — plan your meals. It sounds simple, but meal planning reduces waste, helps you shop only for what you need, and makes it easier to stick to your grocery budget. Fewer last-minute takeout runs mean more money stays in your pocket.



For big purchases — like appliances, furniture, or tech — wait it out if you can. Prices tend to fluctuate, and patience can pay off. Sign up for price alerts or wait for major sale periods like Black Friday or end-of-season clearance events.



Finally, think ahead. If you know prices are likely to rise on something you use regularly — like fuel, pet food, or household items — grab a little extra now while it’s still cheaper. Just be smart about storage and avoid overbuying perishable goods.



The key idea here is this: inflation doesn’t have to catch you off guard. A little planning and intentional shopping can help you stretch your dollars further and keep your financial stress in check.

1okwwon,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1okwwon,11/1/2025 - What I'm feeding my family of 5 this week for $125,"We’re a family of 5, living in a large urban area in the Midwest, USA.

My goal is to feed our family on $500 a month or $125 a week. That breaks down to $3.57 per person for food each day, or $1.19 per meal.

For ease of comparison nationwide in the US, my prices listed here are based off of Walmart.

I do not personally only shop at Walmart. Although Walmart is one of the stores I do regularly shop at because they do frequently have the most competitive prices on their items.

We watch weekly sales & stock our pantry/freezer when items go on sale. Local stores for us are Kroger, Meijer, Aldi, Walmart, Sam’s. We also shop at a local grocery outlet & use Flashfood for clearance items.

For next week’s shopping, I will “shop my pantry first”. I already have many of these items on hand for next week’s menu. I can then use the money that frees up in this week’s grocery budget to stock up on this week’s sales, buy extra produce, or whatever “extras” our family needs this week. For example, we’ll also have protein pancakes because one daughter likes them for breakfast & I don’t need to buy sugar or rice this week so I’ll use a portion of that money in the budget to buy her pancake mix instead.

This week’s shopping list includes everything needed for the recipes on the menu except for salt, pepper, and some basic spices (listed below). All items are the Great Value brand unless otherwise indicated.

# Notes

**Please note that you will need to do some prep cooking by roasting the chicken leg quarters in the oven at the start of the week.**  
Once cooled, separate the meat from the bones. Divide the meat into 3 portions and refrigerate to use in Creamy Chicken & Rice, Chicken Fajitas, and Green Chicken Enchiladas over the week.

**Chicken bones should be turned into chicken stock to be used throughout the week.**

**Directions for roasting chicken leg quarters and making chicken stock are in the Recipes section below.**

**If you’d rather not bother with roasting the chicken & making chicken stock, budget extra to buy about 5–6 lb of boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs, plus 3 boxes of chicken stock, to substitute.**

**Easy Chicken Fajitas**  
[https://www.spendwithpennies.com/easy-chicken-fajitas/](https://www.spendwithpennies.com/easy-chicken-fajitas/)



**Copycat Olive Garden Zuppa Toscana Soup**

1 lb sausage  
3 large russet potatoes, wash, sliced in half, and then in 1/4 inch slices  
1 Tbsp butter  
1 large onion, chopped  
½ tsp salt  
¼ tsp black pepper  
½ tsp red pepper flakes  
2 cloves garlic, minced  
2 cups packed kale leaves, chopped  
16 oz chicken stock  
1 quart water  
1 cup half & half

Brown sausage in a skillet, once cooked, remove to a plate and drain off all but 2 Tbsp of the grease. Add 1 Tbsp butter and the chopped onion into the skillet and saute about 5 min until beginning to turn translucent. Add minced garlic & saute an additional 2 min.  
Add cooked sausage, onion & garlic, along with any cooking juices or drippings into a large pot. Add chicken stock, water, spices, and potatoes to the pot. Bring to a boil and simmer for about 20–30 min until potatoes are tender & starting to fall apart.  
Turn off heat and add half & half. Stir well, and taste for final seasoning.



**Potato & Lentil Soup**

1 pound dried lentils  
2 potatoes, scrubbed & cubed  
1 quart water  
1–2 teaspoons salt (to taste)  
1 quart chicken stock  
1/2 teaspoon black pepper  
1 cup kale, chopped  
1 onion, chopped fine  
2 stalks celery, chopped fine  
2 carrots, peeled & chopped  
3 cloves garlic, minced  
1 Tbsp oil or butter

Rinse your lentils in a colander & pick them over for any bad ones. Place the rinsed lentils,1 qt water, & 1 qt chicken stock in a pot on the stove on medium high.  
Place a skillet on the stove to warm up over low heat, with the oil or butter in it.  
Chop all your vegetables, and once the oil in the skillet is warm put the carrots & celery into the pan and saute for about 5 min. Add onion & garlic. Continue to saute until onion is translucent & carrots are soft. Vegetables should start caramelizing & getting brown before they’re removed from the heat.  
Dump cooked vegetables directly into your pot of lentils, then place the skillet back on the hot burner. Pour about a half cup of plain water back into the pan & whisk quickly to deglaze the pan. Pour the water from deglazing into your soup pot.  
Add salt & pepper. Let lentils & vegetables simmer in the pot for about 40 min, then add your cubed potatoes, and cook until your lentils & potatoes are soft and the soup has started to have a creamy texture.  
Give soup a final tasting for seasoning & serve.



**Unstuffed Peppers**

1 lb ground turkey or beef  
1 Tbsp butter  
2 green bell peppers, chopped  
1 onion, chopped  
2 cloves garlic, minced  
1 14 oz can diced tomatoes  
1 15 oz can tomato sauce  
1 ½ cups cooked rice  
1 tsp salt  
½ tsp black pepper  
1 Tbsp parsley flakes  
½ tsp onion powder  
½ tsp garlic powder  
⅓ cup shredded parmesan

Brown ground turkey in a large skillet, wok, or chicken fryer pan with a tight fitting lid.  
Once cooked, remove turkey from the skillet, melt butter, and add chopped onions & peppers. Saute for 10 min, then add minced garlic. Saute an additional 2 min.  
Add cans of diced tomatoes & tomato sauce, spices, cooked rice, & cooked ground turkey into the skillet. Heat through. Serve hot, topped with parmesan cheese.



**Creamy Chicken Over Rice**

2 tablespoons butter  
2 cups diced chicken  
Salt and pepper, to taste  
1 small onion, finely diced  
2 cloves garlic, minced  
1 cup chicken broth  
½ cup half & half  
1 cup frozen peas  
1 carrot, finely diced or shredded  
1/2 cup Parmesan cheese  
1/4 teaspoon paprika  
1 Tbsp dried parsley

Melt butter in a medium pot. Add onion & carrots and cook for 10–15 min until carrots are softening and onions are translucent. Add garlic and cook for an additional 2 min.  
Add cooked chicken, salt & pepper, chicken broth, half & half, paprika & parsley to the pot. Stir well & bring to a simmer over low. Once simmering add in frozen peas and parmesan cheese.

The brew is taking longer, the cups are tasting less clean, and I may be going crazy but it seems to me like there's more fines here than when I bought the grinder. It's just so hard to really tell when you use it every day and the change is gradual.

Three years ago I went on a first date with this guy at a coffee shop in Denver. He was really into coffee, like knew all the different roasts and brewing methods and stuff. I wanted to impress him so when he asked if I liked coffee I said yes even though I actually think it tastes like burnt dirt water.

We started dating. He'd make me coffee every morning. I'd drink it and pretend it was great. I figured eventually I'd just tell him but then it became this whole thing where his love language is making me the ""perfect cup"" and he gets so happy when I drink it.

Now we live together. We have a coffee subscription. He bought me a fancy mug for my birthday with a little inside joke engraved on it. His family knows me as ""the coffee girl"" because apparently he told them I love it as much as he does.

I drink like 3 cups a day that I absolutely hate. I've tried to develop a taste for it. It's not happening. I load it with cream and sugar and it's still terrible. Sometimes I pour it down the sink when he's not looking and pretend I finished it.

Last week he surprised me with a COFFEE TASTING CLASS for our anniversary. Like a whole thing where we sample different beans and learn about flavor profiles. It's next month. I'm going to have to sit there for two hours drinking coffee and pretending to taste notes of ""chocolate and cherry"" or whatever when it all just tastes bitter to me.

The worst part is he does this thing where he watches me take the first sip in the morning and smiles because he's so proud he made it good. And I smile back. And I want to die inside.

I don't even know why I'm posting this. I just needed to say it out loud I guess. I've built my entire relationship on a foundation of lies about coffee preferences and I don't know how to get out of it without breaking his heart.

The random breakup still doesn’t make sense to me. Rory isn’t ready to say I love you. He’s sensitive and immature and reacts badly when she doesn’t say it back. HOW does this turn into a breakup? Maybe a fight? Maybe hurt feelings? But a breakup? Whose idea was that? I don’t love that it happened off camera, I have so many questions. The last thing we see is that Dean is gonna take her home and then break up? Does not compute. 
* Rachel enters! She really is Elle McPhearson pretty. 
* Lorelai is a complete chaotic mess in this episode. Mumbling, dropping things, awkward. 
* The date set up by Emily with the most boring man alive. How did this dude play him so creepy but bland at the same time? Watch his hands when he talks, it’s so weird. I wonder if he’s channeling Mr. Collins from Pride and Prejudice? Richard having Lorelai’s back when she climbs out the window is a great moment from Dad to daughter. They both couldn’t stand the guy.
* Grant Lee Phillips as the troubadour is one of my favorite characters. I love his voice, he could sing me to sleep any day. He plays “heavenly” in this episode

Lorelai “Wow these carrots sure are tiny!”

I was wearing jeans and this faded grey t-shirt from a 5K I did like three years ago, holding two bags of vegetables and a coffee.

I'm standing at this one vendor's table looking at tomatoes when this woman comes up next to me and just goes ""Excuse me, where do you keep the sourdough?""

I looked around thinking she was talking to someone else but she's staring right at me. I said ""Oh, uh, I don't work here, sorry"" and went back to picking out tomatoes.

She does this huge sigh and says ""I can SEE that you work here, you're standing behind the table.""

I wasn't? I was standing in front of it, on the customer side, holding my own groceries. I said ""No really, I'm just shopping"" and held up my bags to show her.

She gets this look on her face like I just told her the earth is flat and goes ""I have been coming to this market for TWELVE YEARS and I have never been treated so rudely by staff. Get me your manager right now.""

The actual vendor - this older guy who grows everything himself - is helping another customer and kind of glances over looking confused. I just... I didn't know what to say. I said ""Ma'am I literally don't work at this market. I'm wearing a race t-shirt and holding coffee. I live like four blocks from here.""

She starts going OFF about how ""young people these days"" don't want to work and I'm making excuses and she's going to report me. She's getting loud enough that people are staring now.

The vendor finishes with his customer and comes over and goes ""Is there a problem?""

The lady points at me and says ""This employee refuses to help me and is being extremely disrespectful.""

The vendor looks at me, looks at her, and just says ""That's not my employee. That's a customer. I run this booth alone.""

The lady's face went SO red. She just grabbed her purse and walked away super fast without saying anything. Didn't even buy anything.

1okwjr6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChaosZeroNightmare/comments/1okwjr6/story_rant_essay/,Story Rant Essay,"A word before going forward, I've only played up to chapter 4 and both Trauma Codes. I recently learnt of the, er, change of story writers CZN went through until presenting... this, and that triggered me to write this essay, as some sort of crystalization of the thoughts and opinions I've had about the story. I am involved with the world of psychology, so I have some insights that involve such topics. I offer some suggestions, to the void of the internet, if anything. Anywhere that is off my chest is fine for me. If you enjoy the story, I suggest you don't continue this lecture/essay, as it will probably take away from your enjoyment.

That being said, let's begin.

**Rei, Consequence and Continuity**

Imagine you are Rei. Imagine you were grabbed by a monstruous-sized hand and squished until your blood showers the earth below. Next moment, you awaken with all that pain fresh in your mind in a capsule that reconstructed your body to perfection, including the memories of such a traumatic experience. Now, imagine you could just... move on like it never happened and continue to be your charming self as if next mission could not offer a repeat of everything you just experienced.

This small exercise is meant to guide you to understand the lack of... consequence, shown in the story so far. Fear, pain, regret, guilt... Those things are not easy to get rid of when they remain fresh in your mind. I wish that sort of weight would have been portrayed in the story, as crude as it might have been. Make Rei doubt herself. Show how she considers giving up being an agent if it means she won't have to go through that again. Guide us through the process of her resilience as she finds the valor to continue, despite it all. Show us a glimpse of the things she keeps telling herself to endure the pain. Only then will I feel awe for them.

A character that moves here, goes there, does this, says that, like a puppet embodying the concept of an identity without any continuity of its own existence is simply the reductionism of a story that never sought greater heights.

*My suggestion:*

*The goofy mini-stories are fine, though they feel undeserved. CZN was advertised with a horror tag. If something important/traumatic occurs to X character, how about you put a requirement of you going through a therapy session with that character before you can view the mini-story? The cherry on top would be to implement the recovery process as something that's sensitive and that the characters express mutual support of some kind. It would elevate your experience with said characters as some emotional link is stablished through their recovery. But, for that to occur, the trauma should be properly weighted and portrayed. Longer therapy sessions that may even be multi-staged would be great for such development.*

**Haru and Trauma Code**

What is the first thing you think of when you picture the word ""Trauma""? Loss, violence, dispair, betrayal... are the words that come to my mind. There's a beauty to broken things. You can see their wounds. You can see authentic pain. You can, if you possess empathy, full-heartedly root for them to get better. Let's dive into this section's exercise:

Imagine you are Child Haru, trapped in a spaceship that is collapsing and making all sorts of noises. You cannot go out and cannot do anything to change your current situation. Indefension, claustrophobia, fear of the dark, hypersensibility to big noises, nightmares. Not only have you gone through a fearful experience, but you lost your entire family in the process. What were of you after that? An orphanage? Adopted? How will you manage to move on? If only such things were addressed...

Now, imagine your mother actually found you in that dark metal cage. She offered you all the food and water she had, so you can cross out trauma from almost hungering to death from the list. But wait, there may be some hidden and darker truths to your story! Her mother effectively died in that event. The how matters a lot! Did it occur just as they were about to be rescued? Or was it earlier, long before you were found and saved? In that case, may I remind you of the food shortage? Would hunger and thirst drive you craze enough to look at the carcass of your dead mother... with desperate eyes? Would you... give in? How would that have transformed you? How would you have... moved on? How would you have lived with yourself knowing what you did to survive? The guilt, the sorrow, the dispair... the desperate craving of redempting that might push you into the madness that is becoming a combatant agent, perhaps?

But no. Haru's character is not about any of that. It's about how she found comfort in the sensation of weight of her starved mother as she clung to her to easen all her fears, effectively nullifying almost all traumas she could have carried on her back for the rest of her life. The only other lesson you learnt from that? Follow rules and don't go into places that you shouldn't...

Simply... Transformational, isn't it? Ugh.

*My suggestion:*

*If Trauma Code is meant to be an important mode to the game, then it should uphold its name's meaning. Trauma. What did we get, instead? Sad backstory of loss, seasoned with a happy ending that's meant to sweeten our palate. What's this? Sugar? In my trauma coffee? Blasphemy!*

*Now, there's a difference between ""darker"" and ""edgier"". When you put a character through a horrible ordeal, you must question yourself... ""how would they react to this and how does this lead them to develop trauma?"". If a character's trauma is resolved for us since the start, character growth is denied from them from the start as well. In a game where trauma is a core concept, it would give you immense value to actually depict traumatised characters that push on with life's challenges despite it all. Make it relatable. Who knows? Maybe a player can have a cathartic experience from this, if handled correctly. It might have even become a therapeutic game! I mean, if we ignore the gooner designs, lol.*

**The Goon, The Bad and The Ugly**

B-But what's wrong if my big titty waifu is wearing nothing but the tightest of short pants and a micro-bikini into a fight, despite her being a tank? M-My fanservice needs to stay! - No way! Immersion-breaking oversexuallization needs to go! Also, gimme more husbandos!

...is what can be usually heard when discussing Maribell's design. *I agree we could get more males in here, but I understand that it will take time. Hey, at least we have a few!*

Fanservice is the eyecandy that attracts hormone-driven (usually male) customers. There's no shame in that. Since CZN is a business and a game, it needs some strategy to secure earnings. Fanservice would take away take away from the experience of dark stories and gritty experiences... but since there's nothing like that in this game anyway, there's not much to lose. Sadge.

Personally, I can tolerate it and even enjoy it. However, it saddens me that the main appeal of a character in a game that's about mental health and dark fantasy is their body, not their mind. Also, from every meter of bare skin that is exposed to us, we are denied of the pleasure that is enjoying drippy clothes. M-My drip! Where is the drip, Lebowski?

That sums it up for the Goon.

The Bad is... really bad. If a company secures hormone-driven customers... in a setting that was meant to be thought-inducing, trauma-related and existentialistic... well. Oil and water. Even if the original writer for CZN's story had stayed, I cannot see the story staying like that for long. A business model that catters to horny players will keep producing content that can be consumed by horny players. And horny players... mainly look for fanservice... and worse yet... self-inserting themselves into the story.

The Ugly. If the horny playerbase demands A or B, you better obey if you want to be paid. While the incels might be a minority, them being so vocal can harm the business' marketing and decrease earnings. In short, the bastards will coerce the current writers into cattering to their fantasies and restrict what can be done with the characters and give the player avatar every recognition they probably don't deserve.

*An example. Kayron and his maid. Incels were mad about the maid brushing his hair or something to that effect. This post is not one to detail the extent of their idiocy and bottomless insecurity, but the issue is that if Owen cannot even, say, develop feelings for Rei, can we really claim that Owen is his own character? I don't mean to say that he has to fall for Rei just because he can. Romance is generally abhored in gacha games because waifus and whatnot. But, come on! Trauma! Companionship! How are characters meant to support each other if no emotional relationships are stablished between them?! Let me ship!*

**CZN's Face: Renoa and the Protos**

Lastly, for the essay, I want to talk about the game's face. Renoa and the Protos. The immediate comparison I make is... utterly unfarovable to CZN. Supreme Leader Amiya and THE Doctor, from Arknights.

Let's compare Renoa and Amiya, first.

Renoa had to kill her companions when they were about to become monsters. Boohoo. If they are going to go that route, it would have been... grittier if the soldiers didn't ask for it with smiles on their faces while they suffered horrible mutations and lost limbs. You know? If I'm about to die, I... don't know if I could save face to save a literal child soldier's mind. I may just be weak. Or maybe the horrors I was exposed to weren't that horrible. Oh, well. It suffers from the same trauma-aversion that Haru's backstory does. Furthermore, we are told that Renoa is a lone-wolf that hates working in teams. Can we stop to consider how big of a loss it is that... she isn't? It would have made for a harsh boss in the field, created problems and tense situations. But working through it, we could have EARNED her trust! We could have had her noticed how her selfish ""I can do it alone"" attitude is cause her teammates to try harder than they should to earn her recognition! Ahhh! There's no end to this tragedy! Even if she had been a jerk, we could have earned ourself a jerk capable enough to lead madmen into the nightmarish Chaos!

Amiya had to kill Misha, a civilian who she meant to save. She did it after Misha replaced her dead brother, Skullshatterer, who fought for the Infected, fought for what he believed was right. Misha's death was meaningless. There's no harsher death than that. Death is not as scary as it is to die serving no purpose. An existential dread. Something the dead won't appreciate. Something the living survivors and killers will have to endure for the rest of their lives. Amiya is also an empath, so she can feel the emotions of her foes. However, understanding an enemy is also a step towards learning to love them. Despite this, Amiya kills whoever needs to die for the bigger purpose of saving the infected... There are no heroes, no villains... only people struggling to do what they believe to be right, sometimes fighting for the same goal... and killing each other because they tragically cannot find common ground to work together.

*Sidethoughts:*

*...a better possible past for Renoa would have been if her incompetence caused her companions to die, rather than her having to put them out of their misery. Like, enjoying the moral high-ground is not ideal to write a complex traumatized character. Specially if you are going to portray them as a thorny black flower. As of now, her thorns are non-existent. She has been nothing short of accomodating. A comfy flower. Ugh.*

*Have I mentioned yet that Renoa and her group were shaken to the core by the fact that Judas practiced human sacrifices? Really? That's all it takes for them to break down? Is that really the epitome of inhuman acts that could be done? I'd say it is dissapointing to see this, but at least it is consistently dissapointing. Consistency is good, even if it for bad reasons. It means at least someone tried. Let's take a moment to appreciate their soul. It's not their fault the story is this lacking. This story was given the okay by everyone else. Instead of being left in the oven for however long it needed, it was taken out prematurely. Ah...*

Let's now compare the Protos to the Doctor.

The Protos is... an artificial human that is meant to guide the agents through the Chaos, or something to that effect. There are other Protos out there. Their occupation not being unique is not inherently bad. In the story, we are just one of many Protos... but, since there's nothing special to us, there's no real significance to us either. We somehow provide therapy for the agents, but... it feels forced. Are we even qualified to do this? If the Protos felt like a reliable leader, it would make some sense, but their decision-making in the field is... questionable. It's okay not to be perfect. It's not okay to not be perfect and be treated as such. We need a detractor to call us out on our bullshit. Give us a reason to improve. Character growth.

*Also, their presence in Renoa's Trauma Code is a mistake. I cannot help but feeling as though every line they say is stolen from some other character in the real past. It makes the Protos feel as a thief, enhancing my dislike of them. Haru's Trauma Code is infinitely better by simple virtue of the Protos not being there. Alas, that is my personal opinion on that.*

The Doctor, on the other hand, is a key figure in the main struggles the characters in Arknights go through. They try their hardest and help easen the suffering of others. A leader, a strategist, a confidant, a doctor. Without the need of Trauma Code, I feel as though the Doctor does a lot more for the character's mental wellbeing than the Protos does, but that could be mostly due to Arknights' characters actually having real traumas (Oripathy, a terminal illness that plagues the world and causes great discrimination). The Doctor feels like their own character, rather than our self-insert, which makes them infinitely more interesting. Every little discovery makes the Doctor doubt themselves a bit more, compensating the general awe he awakes in everyone with a shot of realism and confusion. What path should we take? What will be the price, next? On top of that, Kal'tsit is always there to throw dirt at the Doctor and make us question whether we are as good as the operators think. Complex relationships! Ah, what a delight!

*Another thought:*

*Amnesia is a great tool to justify the avatar needing all the explanations we receive at the start. In CZN, it would have worked wonders. Why do we have to go through Trauma Code and make the agents reexperiment their traumas if the Protos actually remembers what their story is about? Amnesia also gives us the in-lore reason to non-cannonically justify anything we want to imagine our avatar would do. Hell. Since the wiping of memories is an actual mechanic in this game, we might have had something really important erased from our memory. A key detail that might have helped... in whatever plot device they were to show us later.*

**The Plot**

So far, the only plot is that a man called Judas lost his buddies and became a jerk who sacrifices people to Chaos. Since we sheltered an agent from him, he hates our guts and we have to find proof of his misdeeds. End of story.

Wow. I'm flabbergasted. Is this really what the game is going to be about? Where are the convoluted politics between factions? Even Nikke does this better. Where are the lovecraftian horrors meant to shake our core beliefs about reality, morals and destiny?

Instead... we have a spaceship with agents we ""date"", offer ""therapy"" and send to battle to get ""traumatized"" while we ourselves become a liability in the field. I mean. Yeah. I guess they did it, didn't they?

We've been offered a chaotically unorganized story, with zero weight to life and nightmarishly poorly written characters.

**Conclusion**

All of this being said, the gameplay is good. The story is good, too, but when compared to what it could have been... yeah. Lacking is a word too light to describe it.

*My overall suggestion... and a plea:*

*I know it is very unlikely, but... can the story be remade from scratch? Keep the characters, keep the Chaos, but redo everything else? The gameplay is good enough to survive despite the lacking aspects of CZN. I want it to be better. Please, make it better. The game just launched. It's not too late. Please! I desperately want it to be better! It would rise to become the best gacha I've ever played! Please!*

*Alas, these are merely... one person's thoughts, shared with the oblivion of the internet. Spamming incels have more power than I do. What a sad realization. Knowing this, I can make peace with the fact that the story will probably not improve moving forward. What a... pity.*",0,1761921966.0,ChaosZeroNightmare,9,0.41,False

This is what works for me, wondering if this is what works for you guys. I’ve got no kids, but a very supportive husband of my hobbies and goals, so hopefully… I can keep with at least some of the lifestyle when I do

- I only eat two meals a day
- I pretty much cook all of them unless husband spontaneously wants to go out for dinner and that usually is on fri/sat/sun and I can usually sense if he’s gonna ask based on the early AM texts I get (lol)
- I automatically siphon off about 300 calories of my day to dessert/wine. At the start. I have no idea what my plans are at the EOD and honestly 9/10 times I’m either going to eat some ice cream or have a glass. Or both. So if I’m going for 1500 (this is a deficit for me just fyi), I actually aim to eat only 1200 
- I truly do not trust apple’s calorie estimate. If I use it at all, I take the number it estimates and multiply it by 0.6
- If I’m eating out, breakfast is light but protein heavy (like I’ll eat an entire 5 oz steak) to keep me full and I’ll just double down at dinner
- My workouts are 50 minutes minimum. If I can’t fill that time, I’ll hop on the stairclimber/elliptical to get the remaining minutes. I will not go under
- I work out every day 👀 at bare minimum it’ll be walking my dog or a light elliptical & scroll through TikTok session or golf
- I work out fasted. I rely on having a heavy enough dinner to carry me through
- Always eat before the Celsius or coffee
- This also means I am uncaff before my workouts
- I don’t really snack
- Breakfast cannot be under 350 calories. That will not carry me through dinner
- Breakfast can’t be over 800 calories. I literally cannot get anything done if I’m that full
- I rotate between like 4 different meals. Anything I make is basically the same thing but w protein changed out or marination changed
- I have a lot of rando hobbies and without them I would literally go stir crazy. My mental state of being would be like -1000 if I could not do my hobbies
- I would perish if I was dating someone that would qualify as a “homebody”
- I don’t really eat that many carbs; at most 1/5 of my eating cals come from carbs.
- It is ok to only have 1200 calories in a day. If I find myself there at the end of the day, I do not make myself eat more
- I cannot remember the last time I ate anything that would qualify as fast food
- But most of the meals I eat are under $6 tbh (home)

ALSO
- All of this goes out the window if I’m training for a half marathon or marathon lol

Anyone else just do this? How do you guys end up doing 3 meals a day? I feel like some of this might make a regular heighted person upset lol. I’m 5’1",19,1761921917.0,PetiteFitness,39,0.76,False

1okwgyr,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveLetters/comments/1okwgyr/i_wonder_where_you_are_x/,I wonder where you are x,"You think by now I would be running out of ways to express how I feel about you. But, maybe, there is just a certain depth I have to reach inside of myself before I can accept there is no separating from you. I don’t want to say I love you, in such generic terms and I am trying so desperately to properly get out whatever this is, inside of me. When I look back on the days lived of my life, I wonder, where you have been.

I wonder where you are. What do you do when you first wake up in the morning, do you prefer coffee to tea? What struggles lie within you that you don’t talk about? What, my darling, have you been doing all this time. Are you under my spell too? I want to be with you, because you are the other half to me. I wonder, will there be a tomorrow where I call you mine? I feel you are written into the strands of my DNA and no matter how I try to escape you, you are written there, encoded into the very best parts of me. 

I am trying to put into reality the things I know about you and I am lost. I am stuck somewhere in between,ancient Gaelic symbols - white stag deep in the woods. Black runes written, carved into hieroglyphics on bodies, a grande piano with ivory keys that you sit and play and sometimes you sing to me. The stained glass windows erupting in fire on an icy winter night, in an abandoned Cathedral against post apocalyptic scenery in England. Unsolvable riddles, Greek mythology - pillars, both standing tall and crumbling to pieces, the holy grail, a sword, the mysterious occult - the lady who called you TUA’THA de DANAAN. My friend who is convinced you’re an evil fae trying to possess me and won’t let it go, won’t let me go. But, you’re more than that. She is wrong. So, who are you my love? Why do I feel I have been searching for you, for centuries? 

I am lost in the alchemy of alchemical marriage - Sulphur, mercury, salt. Trying to find your name, in the architecture of real life. Would you recognize me? Would I remember you? I am stuck with you appearing like Dorian grey, crying on your knees about how ugly you are, the scars on your arms that I tenderly kiss so feverishly and Fred Weasley ,sitting on a train, with brown gloves and don’t let me forget the brown fuzzy coat I see you wear in so many dreams. The garden you roam with beautiful, white, roses and gardenias, purple tulip, peonies, cherry blossoms. The white and red ribbons that blow in the wind whispering of the three fates, threading our fate to each other. You are chained to the moon and the sea, I am chained to the sun and desert. 

I want to kiss you so badly, my bones might break into stardust. I wake up convinced that I could have conspired to create this entire realm just to touch you, to hold you, to wrap my arms around you and hush your worries, let you cry into my breast, tenderly wipe away your tears and trace your bare back with my fingers until you feel you are home and I would cradle you at night and quiet your mind, by telling you stories to sleep. I think the only way to find you, is to write you into reality, you might not think you are worthy, but, I think you are worthy enough for eternity. So, when you run your hand over the pages you can see, everything that you are to me. The world can see, how much I love you, and you don’t have to come as anything but yourself. You can be twisted, burned out, screaming with fury, crying into the stages around you. It is time, this is the moment. I am ready to collide. I am ready to burn at the stake. I am ready, most of all, to create, something wonderful, new and beautiful, a gift for the entire world, with you. 

I am done with wondering. I am done with waiting. Is that okay with you? Won’t you take my hand and fall with me?

1okwg0z,https://www.reddit.com/r/coworkerstories/comments/1okwg0z/coworker_created_a_fake_hr_email_to_discipline/,Coworker created a fake HR email to “discipline” people,"
So I recently started working at a mid-sized logistics company. Pretty normal place, lots of spreadsheets, lots of coffee, and a handful of characters.

One of them, Brad, really wanted to be in management. Like, desperately. Always talking about “leadership potential” and “company vision.” Thing is, Brad’s job title is literally “Data Clerk.” No shade, but he’s not exactly changing corporate policy.

Last month, a few people in our department got these odd emails from “HumanResources@Company-Policy.com
.” It wasn’t our normal HR domain. The emails had these passive-aggressive “warnings” about “team morale” and “dress code professionalism.” They weren’t official, just weirdly specific.

Like, my friend Laura got one saying her “workplace laughter was distracting others.” Another said someone’s “lunch choices had strong odors and could be reconsidered.”

IT finally traced the emails after someone reported them. Guess who set up the fake domain? Brad. He literally created a Gmail alias, formatted it to look like a corporate HR address, and had been “issuing” fake warnings to make people “take him seriously.”

When confronted, he said it was “just a social experiment.”
He was walked out the same afternoon.",34,1761921727.0,coworkerstories,15,0.7,False

1okwfa1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1okwfa1,All Profiles on the updated Official Website,"Yes, this is a wall of text.

Endministrator

> The Endministrator of Endfield Industries.    
> In the recorded history of Talos-II, the Endministrator stands as a key guardian who protected civilization on this planet and saved humanity from multiple catastrophic disasters. The Endmin's heroic deeds have given rise to many stories, tales, and even rumors.    
> However, the Endmin's identity remains elusive and only a handful of people have seen the legend in person.  
> Other factions within the Civilization Band are well aware that Endfield has a very special trump card in their hand, but that is all they know.   
> The Endministrator's mysterious mastery over Originium and the Protocol Network, along with the Endmin's need for periodic long-term hibernation, is one of Endfield's most important secrets.

Perlica

> Perlica is the Supervisor of Endfield Industries and the official spokesperson of the company. She is primarily responsible for overseeing and advancing the development and application of Protocol-Originium technology, while also managing the operations of Dijiang.  
> As an outstanding expert in Techno-Protocol, she guided research that had a key influence on the adaptive development and application of the technology, and helped refine the Automated Industry Complex (AIC Factory).  
> She is capable of responding to various crises in a calm and decisive manner. However, Endfield often faces challenges that go beyond all expectations. While the Endministrator was in hibernation, she took command of the Crisis Team, leading the heroes of Endfield Industries in a battle for a greater cause. Perlica moves tirelessly across the Civilization Band, doing whatever she can to maintain order and keep things running.  
> ""Only by walking upon the land, can we truly appreciate every breath and pulse of life... And this is what Endfield is fighting for.""

Chen Qianyu

> ""Well, turns out I'm great at something other than martial arts. I just can't help but end up as your best operator.""  
> From a young age, she trained in martial arts under the guidance of her mother and at Tanjian Hall. Her dedication earned her outstanding combat capabilities and a mental fortitude rarely seen among her peers. Though she has never laid eyes on the legendary Chi Xiao, she proudly upholds her self-developed Chi Xiao Swordmancy, and wields it in the name of justice.  
> After years of roaming Talos-II alone with her sword, Chen Qianyu joined Endfield at Perlica's invitation. Her upbeat nature and fierce enthusiasm drive her to tackle every urgent challenge without hesitation.  
> ""They say my mother's blade stirred the very clouds themselves, Endmin. And I'll do exactly that ... and become the one that you and Perlica can always count on!""

Laevatain

> Laevatain is a Rhodes Island operator who joined Endfield at the Endministrator's direct recommendation. Under the framework agreement between the two companies, she serves as an operator directly under the Endministrator's command.  
> Before joining Endfield Industries, Laevatain roamed the world alone, pursuing a goal she could call her own. Because of that journey, and her formidable skill in solo combat, people often mistake her for ""someone you can't talk to."" In truth, the opposite is closer to reality. It's only that her earnest, forthright nature sometimes comes across too strongly, giving rise to misunderstanding.  
> At times, though, she speaks in ways that confound others, often circling back to the subject of ""memory,"" as if she were purposefully trying to separate herself from who she is.  
> She often wields flames, yet craves ice cream just as much. To her, maybe that contradiction feels perfectly natural.  
> ""Try getting closer to me if you're still feeling cold.""

  
Yvonne

> ""This pair of handcannons feels just right. Hmm... Noticed a few design OFIs. Guess I'll just mod them into a pair of Yvonne-specials!""  
> Yvonne is an operator in the Specialist Tech Division of Endfield Industries, currently responsible for research on Æther, Blight and related devices.  
> At first glance, Yvonne looks like your typical rebellious fashionista — painting her horns, tail, and nails in eye-popping colors. She'll skip out on academic conferences just to snag the latest fashion magazines and pop albums. Drawn to all things new and unconventional, Yvonne has a knack for staying one step ahead of the trends, always marching to the beat of her own drum.  
> But no one can deny that she is a true genius. Even back in her school days, she was racking up accolades in scientific research that others could only dream of. Everyone expected her to join a top-tier research institute and lead the charge in her field. Instead, Yvonne turned her back on it all and chose to join Endfield.  
> The reason? She never explained it. Maybe you can ask her yourself.  
> ""Can I apply new layer of coating for my gear? This color scheme doesn't really match my hair.""

Gilberta

> ""Hi there! Oh, you have the rosy scent of beautiful memories ... like an incomplete letter destined for a special place. I wonder where that might be.""  
> Gilberta is a Rhodes Island operator assigned to Endfield Industries under the framework agreement between the two companies. She serves as a Messenger in the Specialist Tech Division. Skilled in an exceptionally rare form of Originium Arts, she is capable of controlling gravity around her.  
> At Endfield, Gilberta is in charge of mail and intel delivery across multiple bases and outposts. Her duties often require her to travel along the boundaries between the Civilization Band and the frontier, but she seems to really enjoy the job. Recently she even started asking for more challenging missions in high-risk areas to hone her skills.  
> Warfarin admitted that Gilberta's upbeat nature, paired with a hint of unease and hope for the future, once left her both surprised and a little nostalgic.  
> ""Looky here! The Flying Miss Messenger got a special letter for you!""

Ardelia

> ""This world has so many mysteries to uncover. We should get to know it better just like ... like how we should learn more about ourselves. Don't you agree, Professor?""  
> Ardelia is a Rhodes Island operator assigned to Endfield Industries where she serves as an expert geologist under the framework agreement between the two companies.  
> Ardelia's early work centered on volcanoes, but today her research extends into Ætherside and geological disasters. She spends most of her time in the field, venturing alone into disaster sites to collect samples, analyze structures, and develop theories that have become the cornerstone of Endfield's Blight countermeasures.  
> Always humble and polite, she carries an inner strength that never seems to run dry. To her, happiness is simple: climbing another mountain, walking another path, hearing the voices of the world, and uncovering the hidden wonders of this planet.  
> And if you can become good friends with Ardelia, then Mr. Dolly is sure to like you too.  
> ""Mr. Dolly? Don't run off! Come say hi to the Professor.""

Ember

> ""Let's move. War never ends. We can only march on.""  
> Ember serves in the Order of Steel Oath, a military force stationed year-round in the rugged northern regions. To recruit successors for fallen comrades, she returned to the Civilization Band and accepted an invitation to work with Endfield Industries.  
> An elite of the Assault Banner in the Order of Steel Oath, Ember fights with flawless skills. She leads every charge, tearing through enemy lines alongside her comrades like an unbreakable spear. To her enemies, she is the bulwark that holds firm. To her allies, she is the wall that never falls. The Order may rest on fortresses and battlecarriers — but warriors like Ember are its true backbone.  
> ""Beneath the aurora lie the defense lines of the Oathkeepers.""

Last Rite

> ""I am the ... something of war, I guess?""  
> Before the Sarkaz of the floating city found her, Last Rite was a kind-hearted girl adopted by a Caprinae gravekeeper couple. Shaped by their teachings, the young Nachzehrer refused to disturb the dead, resisting her instinct to feed. But that restraint left her reeling with hunger, and her insecurity made her shrink away from others.  
> A chance encounter revealed Last Rite's potential to Seš'qa. Enticed by the promise of ""well-paid temp work"" and ""training to suppress instincts,"" she came to be known among merchants as the Princess of the War Court. Now, clad in a Witching Hour prototype combat suit, she wields frost and steel for Endfield's cause — both to fulfill her contract and to strive toward the peaceful future that Endfield has set before her.  
> ""If my contract with Seš'qa expires, you can contact me... O-oh no! I wasn't supposed to say that! Please... Don't tell anyone about this...""

Lifeng

> ""I came to Endfield to learn. But ... there's way too much to take in. Gotta work even harder!""  
> Lifeng, born in Wuling City, now interns at the Specialist Tech Division of Endfield Industries.  
> Back in Wuling, Lifeng's mind and personalities made him popular with his peers and elders. Years of guidance from Da Pan have honed his spear fighting skills, arming him for his pursuit of justice. Few would guess from his cheerful demeanor the shadow he carries — an accident that shattered his once-happy family and cost him an arm. Yet hardship has never dimmed his fire. He continues to grow with sincerity and passion, yearning for the day he can take on greater responsibilities. Someday, he will stand tall on his own and return to protect the home that waits for him.  
> ""One day, I'll be capable enough to take on the toughest missions. Please look forward to that day, Endmin.""  

Pogranichnik

> ""The situation is urgent. I respectfully request a brief on your battle plan, at your earliest convenience.""  
> Pogranichnik is a Rhodes Island operator assigned to Endfield Industries where he serves as a military consultant under the framework agreement between the two companies.  
>  With deep knowledge of military theory and hard-won experience in team combat, Pogranichnik leads his unit through even the most unexpected crises. Once commander of the Shieldguard Banner in the Order of Steel Oath, he and his troops came to be regarded as among the most reliable on the front lines against the Aggeloi. But as the situation on Talos-II grew increasingly complex, he joined Endfield Industries without hesitation. He firmly believes that the Endministrator will lead Talos-II onto a new path, just as he once envisioned.  
> ""Endmin, I have no doubt that your actions will put a solemn end to this cruel cycle of war and sacrifice.""

Alesh

> ""You can always retrieve a cast lure when angling. But in real life, there's no easy way out once you're in hot water.""  
> Introduced by a liaison from the UWST Security Bureau, Alesh joined Endfield Industries to take on communications and cover duties in the frontier. When he's not on the job, he doubles as the instructor for Endfield's angling class.  
> He isn't keen on talking about his ""boring"" past. All that's known is that he clawed his way through the frontier's underclass, enduring strife and betrayal at every turn. In the end, he left the streets behind with one blind eye and a body worn by exhaustion.  
> By trade, Alesh is a fin seller, spending his days absorbed in angling. But beneath that laid-back surface lie sharp instincts and keen judgment. In a pinch, his eyes cut like the tip of a hook, and he has got as many tricks for handling trouble as he does for reeling in a catch. On missions, he wears that same easy smile, pulling off victories where no one expects them.  
> ""Livin' the happy life is important. True legit wisdom from an old boy, Endmin.""

Arclight

> ""I am Ekut. Callsign Arclight. I am not a trained weaver of words, but I wish you well and may you flow like a rising river, Endfielders.""  
> Arclight is a Songseeker who joined Endfield Industries at the recommendation of Aldertone Orisha. She now serves as a field operator and a technical consultant for machinery and vehicles.  
> No one roaming the wildlands could escape the grip of starvation and disasters, no matter how clever or capable they may think themselves to be. Misfortune struck Arclight hard. The wildlands consumed her entire family, leaving her the only survivor. However, fortune also smiled upon her when a group of Hannabit Circuit Songseekers found and saved her from the brink of death.  
> The Hannabit Circuit accepted her. There, she quickly learned how to survive in a harsh landscape and follow the example of the Paragons from hannas to help those in need. Today, she roams the wildlands to teach more souls the way of surviving in the unforgiving world of Talos-II.  
> Arclight may come across as cold and brusque at first, but her minimalist philosophy has proven exceptionally effective for surviving in the wildlands.  
> ""Repairing an iron steed is like treating a cystybeast. One must listen closely before administering the treatment.""

Avywenna

> ""Messengers have to safely deliver plenty of secrets, and every one of them comes with a costly price tag. But there is one thing more expensive than the delivery itself, and that is ... my silence on these matters.""  
> Before joining Endfield Industries, she lived with a powerful logistics family in the Free City of Alloycarrot. Yet the wanderlust in her blood drove her to leave that life and begin her own journey. Across the many destinations of Talos-II, she discovered a thread that bound them together — the mysterious Endministrator.  
> Avywenna shines in social settings, handling all kinds of relationships with maturity and professionalism. As to whether she's truly as good-tempered as she seems, you'll have to find out by engaging with her yourself.  
> ""Nobody likes insolence ... so if we can talk things out, I'd much rather do that than get physical. But just so we're clear, I don't tolerate insolence well either.""

Da Pan

> ""If you're not good with a dish, just make it more often! I don't cook to show off! I do it to make a pretty and joyful feast!""  
> Da Pan hails from the prestigious Hongshan Academy of Sciences, but after leaving, he took up all kinds of ""dispersed key logistical support roles"" — from chef and electrician to chauffeur and street vendor. His latest move? Joining the Specialist Tech Division of Endfield Industries as an independent.  
> Of all the roles he's taken on, the one he's most proud of is being a traveling chef. He's passionate about exploring new recipes and creating inventive dishes. Nothing makes him happier than crafting delicious meals that win praise from every diner he serves.  
> There's a water bottle Da Pan keeps with him at all times, though few ever notice it. Those who can read Yanese characters might wonder about its origin. But if they're from Hongshan, they'll know exactly where it came from and the weight it carries as an honor awarded only to a Vanguard Scientist.  
> ""Try this. I cooked it myself!""

Snowshine

> ""Wind speed's okay. Visibility's good. Perfect weather for snowboarding.""  
> Snowshine is a Rhodes Island operator assigned to Endfield Industries where she serves as a search and rescue (SAR) professional under the framework agreement between the two companies.  
> For well-known reasons, the true polar regions of Talos-II remain off-limits to humanity. However, as frontier expansion resumes, professionals like Snowshine who specialize in the geography of polar and high-altitude regions are in growing demand within the Civilization Band.  
> Because of the significant talent gap, Snowshine and her rescue team are always faced with a busy schedule, even on days with no special missions.  
> Despite her packed schedule, she managed to write a book titled Polar Survival Guide in her free time. The book has since become a key reference for survival and SAR operations in the harsh, snowy environments of Talos-II.  
> ""I like the snow, the white-capped mountains, and the shimmering beauty revealed only in the frigid cold... This is why I don't want them to leave painful memories to the people they touch.""

Wulfgard

> ""I know that strength isn't everything, but in Talos-II, you can't live without it.""  
> Catello Wulfgard Luppino is a Landbreaker mercenary living on the fringes of the Civilization Band, now serving on the Crisis Team at Endfield Industries.  
> Despite his youth, Wulfgard is already well-acquainted with the ficklest nature of humanity.  But rather than breaking him, those experiences have given him a maturity far beyond his age. He doesn't seek conflicts, and when in doubt, he prefers to avoid direct confrontation. He is also skilled in stealth and recon combat operations. To complete his mission, the mercenary can even travel with his foes and deal the lethal strike when the enemies least expect it.  
> A member of the Landbreaker clan known as the Pack, Wulfgard can be a reliable and trustworthy friend if you manage to earn his trust. But that is no easy feat.  
> ""Unrealistic idealism breaks more lives than it saves.""

Xaihi

> ""Once we are connected, wisdom shall springeth forth.""  
> Xaihi is from the Cabal of Tranquility, a research order dispatched from Laterano to Talos-II for technical study. As a Sessionite, she believes computation and linguistic analysis pave the way to Veritas.  
> She is better with machines than with people. Her talent in information technology is undeniable — even to the Abbess of the Great Monastery in the Cabal of Tranquility. So despite her ""unauthorized"" upgrade to the dome of the Cathedralis triggering a cascade of accidents, the Abbess still sincerely recommended her to Endfield Industries, hoping she could find a stage worthy of her genius.  
> Now, Xaihi works aboard Dijiang on information engineering tasks such as Protorig Network construction and system integration. Her unique insights into the Originium Network, combined with the deep knowledge she carries from the Cabal, ensure her place as an indispensable member of Endfield.  
> ""O Knowledge most ancient, lead us not into temptation but deliver us from the codes of malice... I am Xaihi, Endministrator. May you be enlightened.""

Akekuri

> ""Akekuri, Op Z7, reporting in! Excited to join the mission, let's make it a success!""  
> Akekuri, Captain of Operations Team Z7 under the Specialist Tech Division, is known for her smile and that trademark line: ""Leave it to me."" From mission planning to day-to-day management, she handles it all. Beyond tactical command and strategy, she's a master of coordination who always uncovers the optimal solution, even with limited resources. She also knows how to care for her team, making sure everyone works in harmony and shines in the role that suits them best.  
> She practically built Operations Team Z7 from the ground up. In just a few short months, she handled everything from recruitment and training to full deployment, leading the team to remarkable results. And to think, not long ago, she was just an honors student from the Business School who volunteered to join Endfield. No one expected a newcomer to rise so quickly and become a captain truly worthy of trust.  
> If you've ever wondered about her passion, her drive, and her idealism, or about the simple wish that keeps her going, then...  
> ""Coffee break, Endmin? I can whip up a fresh pot for you!""

Antal

> ""A mission for me? Good. I happen to be seeking field-testing opportunities for modified orbiters.""  
> A member of Operations Team Z7 in Endfield, Antal works as a supporter and an Originium technology consultant. He is clever and quick on the uptake, but not the best at reading people. More than once he has dropped comments so out of place they leave the rest of the team groaning. Even so, his talent for Originium Arts is remarkable, though he himself seems hardly aware of it.  
> Influenced by his grandmother, Antal has little concern for conventional success and pours all his focus into whatever fascinates him. Be it an Originium device he has never seen before or a dry joke that leaves him marveling, this young Savra won't rest for days until he feels he has unraveled its secrets.  
> ""Curiously, your presence greatly amplifies my eagerness to share my vast knowledge.""

Catcher

> ""Need defensive cover? I shall give you my best.""  
> Catcher serves on Operations Team Z7 in Endfield, responsible for cover and logistical support. Backed by full military training, he draws on his extensive knowledge to guide his teammates through critical moments. Born into a military family within the Talos-II General Chamber of Commerce, he was raised with the love of devoted parents and older siblings. The pain and sickness caused by a childhood accident never brought him down. Instead, they shaped him into the steadfast warrior he is today.  
> Catcher may be the youngest on the team, but his maturity far surpasses that of his peers. He can work seamlessly with everyone, readily cover when a teammate struggles, and even prepare a camp meal tailored to everyone's needs. With him around, the team always feels safe and at ease.  
> ""I have recently reviewed everyone's suggestions and improved my wildlands stew recipe... Feel free to give it a taste if you're curious, Endmin.""

Estella

> ""Hngh... Feels like the weight of the entire world has come down at me ... my knees, especially...""  
> A member of Operations Team Z7 in Endfield, Estella handles intel gathering and communications. Physically weak, and shadowed by misfortune wherever she goes, she sometimes lets her sharp tongue and dark humor push outsiders away. Her dream is simple: to live a peaceful life. After all, she has seen too many people like herself, trapped in a world with no choices, no change, and no future.  
> A life of danger and extremes has numbed her senses to the world and raised her threshold for stimulation. As a result, she sometimes seeks out harsher forms of challenge — like the pounding rush of heavy metal music. Those rare jolts give her a fleeting sense of change and something real.  
> Through her work in Endfield, Estella hopes to make the world a little better and life a little easier for those around her.  
> ""I overworked myself again... Hngh... I better appreciate the break while it lasts.""

Fluorite

> ""Distract them? Disable them? Or ... just destroy them?""  
> A member of Operations Team Z7 in Endfield, Fluorite is responsible for scouting and disrupting enemy lines. Her command of street rules and dirty tricks rivals her sharpshooting, sparing the team from countless troubles. Hailing from the frontier at the edge of the Civilization Band, she sharpened her eye through constant migrations and wandering. More often than not, she simply sits in the corner with a faint smile, leaving others with the unsettling sense that every flaw has already been laid bare under her gaze.  
> But don't mistake her for empathetic. Fluorite's knack for reading people gives her exceptional instincts on the battlefield, but also leaves her dangerously good at stirring people up with just a few words — making her the team's most unpredictable source of trouble.  
> ""Got anything to say? No? How about we just call it a day?""",46,1761921678.0,Endfield,6,0.99,False

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

I don't see this woman often enough and have no interest in changing her. I'm just waiting out the clock. 

My MIL thinks she's very clever, that people are not aware of her ""speaking through"" other family members. She has my FIL, BIL, and BIL's wife do her fact-finding bidding, and they act as her mouthpiece so she can appear to not be the source of her uninteresting, not-that-incisive commentary. This allows her to sit, with a permanent facial expression of just having smelled a fart, without saying a word to me. 

She gossips about everyone to the other people. About my BIL and his wife, she gossips to my husband. About me, she gossips to my BIL. About her husband, she gossips to everyone. About herself, she ensures all are aware of her sundry ""sacrifices"" and pains, to make sure she never leaves our thoughts. Everyone is somehow aware and oblivious at the same time, probably because they are used to it. 

She insists and insists that people accept money from her and then turns around and gossips about how they APPEAR to be using ""HER"" MONEY (Wahhhhh). She says she has no use for the money, please take it. She says awful things about my BIL's wife, who is practically a saint. She stares daggers at my FIL, who she hates that people enjoy the company of. 

She stares daggers at me, when I make coffee, as I do dishes, as I exist and breathe. I would hate me too if I looked like the Crypt Keeper, had the personality of a damp brown paper bag, and had a polar opposite DIL. 

I used to rationalize the way my MIL is, falling for the same trap that the others do, making excuses for her. But now that I've reached this particular age, I see her for what she really is: quite pathetic and unable to connect with her own family in a normal way. I see her tendencies now being expressed in my BIL, who has now adopted a lot of her habits. A healthy, loving family doesn't obsess over and bean-count ""sacrifices"". Acts of love are not labeled and pounded home as ""sacrifices"". Money isn't used to control, shame, and guilt-trip. Demonstration of one's love for another person isn't done via downgrading the character of competing parties. A healthy MIL doesn't complain about never being called by her sons and then ignores their calls. 

I've written and deleted posts in which I made fun of her triggering qualities, mostly to destress from having to be around her. What's truly insidious is the above, which is all there is to her. No interests, no hobbies, no ideas, nothing. Just a husk with a human form, seeding distrust and dislike among other people, hoping she can be at the center, blameless. Because she has very little to offer anyone. 

I thank the universe we do not live in the same country. ",12,1761921556.0,motherinlawsfromhell,6,1.0,False

1okw9y6,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1okw9y6/the_beast_in_the_pines_part_2_of_3/,"The Beast In The Pines, Part 2 of 3","That Friday we headed to Clarence once again. Outside of the music on the radio the car ride was pointedly quieter than usual, less chatty. Nobody said what everyone was thinking, but perhaps it was for the best. A deluge of comments and concerns wouldn’t prevent Dad from finding more dead animals. So we all acted like everything was business as usual. As we passed the  “Welcome to Clarence! Population: 804,” sign, thoughts of the monster that had been congregating in my mind all week began to swarm.

We turned from the old sun baked road and onto the dirt drive way. Whatever cheery ambient banjo music my brain normally played when we arrived at farm was silent. I only heard the tires as they crunched over rocks.

Once we got settled in, Dad told Mom and I to go do our usual grocery shopping. While we were gone he planned to go around the pine rows in Bear and “take a look around” which we all knew meant “search for carcasses.” He assured us he would be fine, putting our minds at ease with a dad joke about his shotgun riding shotgun. 

So Mom and I went by the Piggly Wiggly in Clarence. The same old lady from last time was at the front, greeting us when we walked in. Mom gave me half the grocery list so we could divide and conquer. She wanted to get back to the farmhouse, she didn’t like the idea of Dad out there by himself.

Rounding the corner I went to dodge the bread display but it wasn’t there. I proceeded down the list until I had completed my scavenger hunt, meeting back up with Mom. We checked out, the nice older lady remembering us from last time, and striking up conversation with Mom. I zoned out.

*Maybe the movie tropes were true and it only transformed under a full moon. It wasn’t a full moon this weekend, but it wasn’t a full moon last weekend either, and Dad said the Bobcat was fresh. So what if it was there? Would Dad find more dead animals? Were we really safe like Dad said? What if now it knew we were coming out there and tried to eat us?*

My thoughts were fitful and aimless. The swarm constructing a hive. 

Before I knew it we were back at the farmhouse. From the look on Mom’s face I could see that the same swarm had built a hive in her brain as well. We watched Dad emerge from the front porch as we pulled up. He gave us a wave, his smile seemed hopeful as he approached.

“Good news. I went around the pines and didn’t see any signs of the big nasty varmint.” Dad said ruffling my hair. 

“Really? Peter, do you think maybe it’s wandered off somewhere else?” 

He clicked his tongue, “Eh, I don’t think so, but who knows. I mean I hope so, that would be great.”

“Yeah, let some other bum bury dead animals.” I jeered.

“Yeah!” Dad jeered with me. 

“Maybe that big ugly thing went off and died somewhere!”

“Yeah!”

Mom chuckled, “You two are a couple of clowns. Now can I get some help with the rest of these groceries please?” Dad walked past me to grab an armful of groceries, bumping me over playfully. I laughed, trying and failing to push him over in return. 

Despite the swarm, and all the apprehension built up in my gut, I couldn’t help but want to try and carry on as usual, to treat this weekend like a normal weekend. At least until I was given a reason not to.

The rest of that weekend was like a dream. Friday afternoon I helped Mom with some chores, and then I played outside, finishing the carving in my oak tree, building little houses for fairies with sticks. I saw the cats running around the farm like they normally do. No longer lingering near the Kitty Cat Barn like they were last week. They frolicked in the clovers, basked in the warm rays of sunlight. I enjoyed watching them. That night there was a glorious heavy rain. Mom made a hot beef stew, hearty and savory. 

Tucked in that night I was tired and my belly was full. I wouldn’t have seen anything out the window anyway, so I didn’t look. The tin roof sang me to sleep. 

Saturday was more of the same Arcadian bliss. Aunt Cheryl came to visit on Saturday. She was Mom’s older sister, and while we loved Aunt Cheryl, Dad had taught me to make myself busy when she came around. Poor Mom was left to pull up a chair and listen. She was twice divorced, and at the time she was dating Mr. Neal. She had leathery bronze skin and bleach blonde hair, and smelled like shea butter hand lotion. 

Mom and Aunt Cheryl sat on the porch, and I played in the yard with some Barbie dolls pretending I was extremely busy. They talked about the cold front coming in next week, Aunt Cheryl’s work at the dentist’s office, Aunt Cheryl’s most recent ex-husband’s new girlfriend, Aunt Cheryl’s problems with her heart burn, and Aunt Cheryl’s plans for dinner that night. When Aunt Cheryl went to take a sip of her drink to oil the wheels on her trap, Mom finally got a word in. She said it in a hush, in case I was listening. Which I was.

“Cheryl you haven’t heard anything new recently, you know about the animal attacks?”

Aunt Cheryl responded at full volume.

“Shit, not since you told me about the dead animals y'all found, honey. And Neal hadn’t said nothing about it, but you know Neal. He’s the tall dark and mysterious type. Ya know I told him he needs to quit slouchin’ but he don’t listen to me-“

The conversation trailed off, and a small budding sense of hope began to take root within me. No news was good news, right?

That night, against my better judgement, I slowly eased myself out of bed to peer out the window. I couldn’t help but to shiver when I imagined what I might see. Despite my unease, I was only greeted with the cats, loitering around the small gardening barn, stalking mice among flower bushes. A barn owl called from one of the pecan trees.

I felt that bud of hopefulness start to blossom. 

We drove home on Sunday, and I couldn’t help but to feel disarmed as I peered out the window, admiring the scenery like I used to.

If only I knew how much danger I would soon be in.

The week was filled with delightful tedium. School, homework, a couple afternoons at friends’ houses. I hadn’t told any of my them about the slew of dead animals we had found in Clarence, what I had seen in the pine rows, or much less my werewolf theory. 

Before all of this started I  had asked Mom and Dad if we could to take a friend with us one weekend. They responded positively to that, but I was sure that wasn’t the case now. I had a feeling it would be a while before either of them felt comfortable with that, but if the beast stayed away, then maybe they would become open to the idea again.

I pondered these thoughts as we pulled up to Piggly Wiggly that Friday. We decided to stop by on the way in to town. Dad was running by the hardware store, something about brackets for some roof mounted lights for Bear.

Mom gave me half of the grocery list. As I looked it over, I turned the corner to go down the next aisle and almost bumped into it. The bread display. Once we finished our shopping, we checked out and met Dad by the car. When we asked him if he found the part he was looking for, he began to rant about the hardware store never having what he needed. From there we headed to the farm. 

We pulled up to farmhouse, in good spirits as we unloaded groceries. Once we finished l Mom said I could go play until dinner time, so long as she could see me from the house; but before I could shoot out into the yard, Dad whistled for my attention. 

“Ey! Before you go play, I need you to go feed those cats. They probably need a refill. Make sure they got clean water too.”

Mom and Dad exchanged looks. The Kitty Cat Barn wasn’t in view of the windows.

“Don’t worry Lori, I’m headed over to the shop barn, I’ll be able to keep an eye on her until she can get back into your line of sight.”

I heard Dad whisper something to her under his breath about responsibility, before he came over affectionately grabbing my shoulders as he walked with me to the shop barn. I waited by the door while he fetched me a little bag of cat food and then sent me on my way. I could feel his gaze on me until I was out of sight. 

There were about 10 cats living in the Kitty Cat Barn at a time, not including their kittens. All of them were Nanny’s strays.

Despite knowing they were regularly checked on by Mrs Kerry, I still worried about them, especially out in the wild with some beast on the loose. Though, I felt like a werewolf eating a cat was equivalent to me eating a singular popcorn shrimp. I wasn’t sure if the cats knew that, but perhaps they felt better in the Kitty Cat Barn, being popcorn shrimp in a hard to reach place.

I wrapped my fingers around the lopsided wire-paneled door that bowed on its hinges, allowing the cats easy entry. I stepped through the threshold an initial response of relief to see glimmering eyes shining at me through the musty darkness. However, I was then horrified by the fact that they were *all* there. More than 10, probably 20, all tucked into the shelves, hiding. I stopped dead in my tracks, and stayed dead there for a minute, trying to process what this may have meant, why they were there. Unfortunately, I had an idea. I tried to push through the motions, moving on to the task at hand. I fed them, and they graciously came down to eat. I used the hose to clean their bowl and they gladly drank. I was hopeful that maybe they were just still spooked by “something,” and that perhaps some food and drink would help them perk up. But once they had eaten and drank their fill, they just jumped right back onto their shelves, tucking themselves in like books. Dozens of eyes, pairs of wide luminous globes staring at me with feral transparency. 

*You need to run. You need to hide.* 

I would have gone straight to Dad to report this, but I heard the air compressor running, and I knew that meant “busy,” so I came running back into the house.

“Mom! Mom! The cats are all hiding in the Kitty Cat Barn!”

“What?” She said peaking her head out from doorway to the kitchen.

“There are like 20 cats hiding in the barn, Mom! I-“ 

I paused for a moment, staring out the window.

“I think they might be hiding from the werewolf!”

There was a beat of silence.

“Amy-“ Mom huffed, “come here.”

I did as she said, any fearful wind in my sails shadowed by the threat of a scolding from my mother. I walked timidly into the kitchen as she finished washing her hands, wiping them on her apron before placing them on my shoulders.

“Amy, sweetheart. There was, or is, an animal out there. Absolutely. We don’t know if it’s a wolf or a bear, but we know that it’s one of the two.”

She knew I disagreed, but my better judgement had me keep my mouth shut.

“You are a good girl Amy, and I know you’re not lying to me. Now whether you did see something out there or maybe dreamed it, it doesn’t matter. It scared you, and it would’ve scared me too! I don’t want you to think I don’t believe that you saw what you think you saw, okay? I do. But it’s just not a werewolf, honey, okay? Werewolves are not real.”

She said all of this firmly but, kindly, warmly. With a yearning for understanding in her eyes. 

I loved my Mom, so much. I gave her a small smile. Nodding. 

“Are we in agreement then?”

I nodded.

I wondered if I should start taking into consideration that this wasn’t a werewolf, and that she was probably right. The very thought caused me to psychologically squirm, but maybe I really did just have a nightmare.

That night I laid in bed, kissed and tucked in under fresh linens. Prayers said. I tossed and turned for half an hour before I knocked on the door to Mom and Dad’s room. Pitifully declaring,

“I can’t sleep.” 

Mom lovingly embraced me, probably glad I hadn’t come bursting in about seeing a werewolf. She tucked me back into bed and brought me a glass of warm milk to help me relax. It calmed me enough that when she asked if I was comfortable enough for her to go back to bed, that I said yes. She kissed my forehead, telling me goodnight, and I was suddenly alone again. Warm and snug under the covers, but still awake, staring at the ceiling. 

*Were the cats still huddled in the barn? How long would they cower in there?* 

I turned to look over at the window, until slowly I got up. 

I peaked out the window. One of the flood lights was on the garden barn. Dad had started leaving it on since burying those animals with Mr Voss. Its light cast shadows on the yard and it’s various shrubs and garden beds. I didn’t see any of the cats. None of them played around in the grass or slinked about in the shadows. I sighed, climbing back into bed. I hadn’t laid back down for more than 15 minutes, sleep’s spell almost cast on me when I heard it. 

I heard it. 

The groaning sound of wood in the yard. By the time I’d flipped the covers over to venture out of bed and investigate I heard another sound, right below my window- the crunching of leaves, followed by a very soft high pitched yap. 

I rushed to the window and below it, under the bush, I saw a fox and her kits skulking up against the side of the house. The mother was coming down from a snarl, as though she had just snapped at one of them. I saw the kit in question, coming up to nuzzle the mother with its litter mates.

I didn’t have time to ask myself what they were hiding from. 

A shape loomed in my periphery. From the shadowy outline of the garden shed’s roof I saw a shape emerge. Somewhat indiscernible, a head and a pair of shoulders- human looking, muscular, but very broad- like they’d been unnaturally pushed apart to make room for the tall spinous protrusions of its back. It approached the front most part of the roof turning to the side, and in the inky midnight blue sky its black silhouette engrained itself into my mind for eternity. From the massive torso and arched spine came a long thick neck that ran up to a skull, distinctly canine with a muzzle. The ears were pointed and translucent like the wings of a bat. I watched as one of its abnormally long arms moved dexterously to maneuver its body over the roof. Fear hit my blood stream, and I had to work to contain my scream of panic. My raspy whimper cracked out from my throat as I sprinted to my parents room where it turned into a cry. 

“Daaaaad! Mommmm!”

It was pure instinct, A child running and whimpering to its parents as the kit had beneath my window.

They groaned as they sat up in bed,

“Amy? What is it baby? Are you okay?”

I approached my mom’s side, cowering into my her arms. She held me tight by my wrists, trying to make out what I was saying despite being half asleep. 

A sudden wall within me fell, and defeat consumed me. 

They wouldn’t believe me, but I know what I saw. 

*I know what I saw.*

“Its the werewolf,” the last word came out in slow shaky whimper.

“I swear. I swear Mama.” I gasped between sobs. 

She released a deep breath, holding me close. 

“Amy,” I could hear the sorrow in her voice, but what stung was the disappointment.

“Amy, you saw it out your window?” Dad was on his feet, already at the door to their bedroom.

 I nodded quickly.

I heard him as he moved swiftly down the hall, presumably to go look out my window. He made footfall to the back door, grabbing a shell from the top of the bookshelf, loading it into his shot gun.

Of course, he came back with nothing to report. 

“Amy, you must’ve had a nightmare baby.”

“It was a werewolf! Im not making it up! It was on the garden barn, Daddy it was just there!”

“I looked, baby, and I didn’t see it.”

“Honey we know you’re not lying, you just had a vivid nightmare is all.”

I shook my head and I wept. Not sure what was real anymore.

Mom and Dad let me crawl into bed with them.  

The next morning I heard them talking in hushed tones in the living room, over coffee. About me.

“I was thinking if she saw something on two legs out there that maybe it was just a big man. I talked to Dan yesterday on the phone, he said some people in the area don't want to wait for the game warden- can’t say I entirely blame ‘em- but they might be out there trying to hunt the thing. I don’t know…”

“I thought we had a good understanding yesterday. I should have done more to keep her grounded through all of this, paid more attention, I just-“ I heard my mom sigh, burying her face in her hands. My dad patted her back. 

“I hate that she is going through this. She’s such a good kid.”

“No honey, none of this is your fault. I should’ve gotten more involved-”

“No, no- you’ve been great. Not to mention, you’re working a 9 to 5 all week and then keeping the grounds up here… and burying dead animals as of late. Hopefully this is just a phase she’s going through. I just worry about her you know? The fairy stories, those so called “friends” of hers at school-“

I couldn’t bear to hear any more. Mom and Dad had so much they were trying to juggle, and now I had caused them to worry about me. 

I hated myself for that, I hated that I had made them hurt. 

I tip toed back to their bedroom, crying under the covers for a little while until I had gotten my emotions under control. I wiped my tears and walked into the living room, making sure they saw me run the sleep from my eyes, an excuse for their redness. 

The rest of the day I read mostly. Not wanting to really talk to anyone. I would’ve liked to have played with the cats, but there was no coaxing them from their refuge in the Kitty Cat Barn.

I was mostly quiet at lunch and at dinner, finishing both quickly to “get back to the book I was reading.” Mom and Dad had each made at least one attempt during the day to say something to me about the night before. To make sure I was okay, to ask if I needed or wanted to talk about it. I knew that if we did they would only end up trying to help validate in my mind that it was all a dream. By the end of the day I wished that I was just being an imaginative child, and that I could honestly tell myself that it was just a vivid nightmare. 

Mom and Dad offered to let me sleep with them that night. I thanked them, but refused, assuring them that I would be fine. I told myself that so long as I didn’t look out my window I wouldn’t risk seeing anything, and that gave me comfort. Enough comfort to sleep alone in a dark room with a werewolf possibly outside, anyway. 

To my own surprise I managed to get to sleep well enough, tired from all the emotions I had been untangling for the past 24 hours.

To this day, I cannot say what compelled me to stir from my rest in the middle of the night. I awoke, rubbing my eyes as I got my bearings. 

I had told myself. 

*Don’t go over to the window. Nothing good ever happens when you go over to the window.*

I don’t know if there was a part of me that wanted to prove myself wrong, so I could say to myself, 

*“See? There’s nothing out there. Maybe Mom and Dad are right, and you’re just a dumb little kid having nightmares.”*

I padded over, hearing the friendly creak of the floorboards. I ducked under the lacey curtain veil that my mother had lovingly sewn together and hung up on my window, in all likelihood hoping it would keep me from doing exactly what I was about to do. 

To my everlasting regret, I peered out into the pitch black world beyond the glass. 

Through one of the vintage pane’s I saw something familiar.  A pair of chalky white new balance sneakers, something that I thought was unique to only one person.

I felt my heart sink to the floor. 

The bright white shoes stood out in the underbrush, and I squinted at the way they almost seemed to hover in the darkness. I managed to make out that the figure they belonged to was staggering into the woods. 

*What was wrong with Dad? Was he hurt?*

I remember my mind beginning to free fall, panic setting in. My thoughts fogged up the window pane on a whisper, 

“If I wake Mom, I’ll just make her upset.”

I should have just gotten Mom. God, I should have just gotten Mom. 

But I had cried wolf too many times.

My plan was to go out the back door and call out to him from the stoop. I shuffled out into the night chill, hugging my arms to my chest. 

I had opened my mouth to shout his name, but before I could, I heard the agonizing cry from the figure out in the woods. I’d heard my Dad yelp when he brought a hammer down on his thumb, but I had never heard him cry out like that before. 

It sounded excruciating.

*Had the monster hurt him? Could he walk? Did he need help?*

I watched the figure nearly crumpling over as it staggered into the pine rows.

I- the sweet summer child- thought,

*He isn’t far away.*

*I could catch up to him quickly.*

*I run that distance in P.E. all the time.*  

Before I knew it I was sprinting through the yard with confidence, I knew every rock, ant hill, and arching root. It was all mostly open space until you got to the concrete slab in front of the shop barn where Dad parked the Backhoe and Bear. My eyes slowly began to adjust to the dark. I ran on tiptoe across the icy cold concrete slab. I didn’t even have any shoes on. 

I stopped to take a better look at the barn. The lights weren’t on. Dad hadn’t been working on anything. What in the world was he doing out here so late? Did he see something?

I peered into the pine rows. No sight of the figure. 

I wanted to call out to him, but hesitated. If that thing was out here I wasn’t going to draw its attention to us. 

He couldn’t have been more than half a football field away. I could catch him.

I ran through the frigid night air, my heart knocking like a piston within my chest. My gaze swung between the pine trunks as I scanned the rows. Seeing nothing, I continued to run. The monotony of the trunks and the rows and the waves of pine straw putting me into a trance. 

How many rows back had I gone? Was this a football field- or half a football field?

*Surely I would have seen Dad by now.*

By the grace of God I stopped, warm blood pumping through my chest, I tried to catch my breath as quietly as I could. The pines stood in formation around me, a sprawling arboreal army. 

It felt like some dense mass had been dropped down my throat until it hit the bottom of my stomach, sinking like a stone. The nausea set in as I became cognizant of my situation, my instincts being translated into a flimsy string of cohesive thought. 

*Dear God. Dear God. I had ran too far.*

*You idiot. You stupid dumb little child.*

I became very still. 

Soft tender moonlight trickled through the pines, pearly beams scattering across the fallen pine needles.

I looked out, down the corridors of trees. Making out a shape a few rows over, I squinted, shifting my head to see through the trunks. When I realized what I was seeing my eyes grew very wide, and my spine grew rigid. Terror hit me like lightning.

It was far enough away that I hadn’t seen it at first, but not so far that I couldn’t now see it in painful clarity. 

It moved like a wraith in a crypt, a lean, creeping monstrosity. I remember thinking how fast it looked. How little time it would likely take it to get to me.

I took slow silent steps backwards willing to do this all the way home if I had to. Now acutely aware of my surroundings, I stepped and felt a pang of hope. When I stepped there was no crunch in the pine needles.

Thinking this was to my advantage, I made a handful of quick steps until suddenly, to my corporeal horror, it stopped. I watched as its ears fanned upwards, unnaturally long and pointy. Its head turned on its long neck, the top of its muzzle moved up in a familiar motion. A sniff. 

It could smell me.

Slow and shaky steps turned quickly into a full sprint in the opposite direction, I nearly held my breath as I ran, trying to keep myself as quiet as possible. I bit my lips to keep from whimpering. I hoped I would be able to hear him if he started to run towards me.

But it dawned on me that what I had moments ago thought to be to my advantage was now to my great detriment- 

*When I stepped- there was no crunch.*

I was suddenly also painfully aware of how bright neon pink my nightgown was in the darkness.

My jaw began to quiver as I pressed forward. I cut diagonally across the rows, moving in the general direction of the farmhouse. 

I ran like this, cutting across row after row after row until suddenly I collided with the ground, having tripped on a groove in the earth. In that moment I remember thinking that between keeping my tears at bay and fighting the urge to involuntarily wet myself, I knew something had to give. Urine it would smell, but hopefully not tears. That thought alone, and how hopelessly dead I began to realize I was caused them to fall like a downpour, cascading down my cheeks. Cold rivers on my warm flushed face. I scrambled up, again fighting the urge to whimper, until my blurry eyes caught sight of what I had tripped on. 

The groove I had tripped on was one of many, claw marks that had slashed up layers of pine needles and ripped into the earth. Less than half a row away was a pile of clothes, among them were the treasonous pair of white new balance sneakers, cast aside haphazardly. 

I wish I could say that I told myself to calm down and think, but I didn’t. My hippocampus, my amygdala, one of them went AWOL and violently threw open the filing cabinet labeled “*Wolves*.”

 In all my follies that evening I made one decision that might have saved my life.

I stripped off my neon pink nightgown, flinging it to the side. 

Down to nothing but my Barbie underwear, I yanked the shirt up from the ground, sliding it over my head.

I grabbed the jacket, hurriedly slipping my arms into the sleeves.

It was huge on me, and smelled like cigarettes, but more importantly it wasn't bright pink and it would mask my smell. The smell of Mr. Bubble bath soap and warm milk. 

With less than a couple of seconds to make a decision that I was willing to bet my life on, I frantically assumed that if the beast followed my scent diagonally through the pine rows that I would go diagonally the opposite way, but still in the direction of the house. 

Hurtling forward I thought this would be a great plan until it occurred to me that it would see me. It would have one chance of seeing me from down the pine rows, I could only hope that I was far enough away. 

Adrenaline eventually took all my thoughts by the collar and kicked them out. Fate had dealt me a handful of seconds for thinking and I had used them up. My only task now was to act on them and pray.

As I ran I mustered up the courage to pivot and look beside me down the pine rows. Painfully aware that I was at the indefensible mercy of what I might see. 

After crossing over half a dozen rows I saw a flash. The most terrifying blur I had ever seen. I only vaguely made out its shape. Headed in the direction I had been in less than a minute before. There was no speculating about it. 

The monster was after me. 

I could see light from the farmhouse, an angel reaching out in the night. Mom and Dad had realized that their baby girl wasn’t tucked in bed under her daisy quilt. My heart began to ache. I could practically smell the remnants of smoke from my dad’s pipe, feel the crisp linen sheets mom had just put on the bed. I choked back a sob. 

I continued to run until I emerged from the pine rows, right beside the shop barn. For a splintering second I thought of the naive child that  had stood there not 15 minutes ago, preparing to run into the devil’s hunting ground.

 I was so close, so close to the house. 100 yards at the most. I was ready to collapse in on myself, fall into hysterics in the safety of my parents arms. 

But as I reached the shop barn I stopped. Dead in my tracks. A tug, a pull, a gut feeling. A memory from the night before. 

Surely, the shop barn was too tall.

But the oak tree beside it- beside me- wasn’t. 

My head snapped up to my right. 

It sat like a looming gargoyle on the burled apex of the oak’s twisted knotted branches, its enormous torso coiled up in the dark, ready to strike had I taken a few steps further.

The shadow of the barn had concealed me, but not for long. I watched as a cadaverous  front limb slid down the trunk from the dark and into the unholy moonlight. Massively elongated human palms and fingers, the bones bowing horrifically outwards like paws, tipped with keratinous claws that bit into the bark. I took a step backward. I watched in terror as the hand revealed an arm, muscled like a human’s but twice as long and curved at an unnatural angle. 

I darted into the barn. I knew I didn’t have more than a second or two. 

I stumbled in through the doorway. I was going to make a break for the upstairs loft, but I opted not to for fear of being cornered.

My eyes only had enough time for one vicious sweep of the room. They landed on a solid wooden workbench up against the wall with a trash can beneath it. I raced over, frantically crawling under it, unbothered by the cobwebs. Beside me was a bucket with various lengths of PVC pipe. With whatever borrowed time I didn’t have, I reached to move it to my side and block me in under the bench.

I was unaware of the chains wound up in the bottom like snakes. 

I heard the grit from the bottom of the bucket scrape against the cement and I wanted to vomit.

I peered out from my hiding spot, a tall ominous shape standing still in the doorway. 

For all I knew, the scrape was inconsequential, perhaps it had already seen me and I was as good as dead anyway.

My cheeks were cold, but I felt the warm trails of tears still on my face.

I watched as it entered the barn. It’s lean disfigured arms came into view first, the muscles slithering beneath the skin as it moved. Its torso was human but wide, stretched outwards unnaturally. The hips were the same way, narrow, but also having been stretched to achieve its new unholy function. It’s legs were much like the arms, and the feet much like the hands.

It stalked into the barn, sniffing the air. Once beside the bench it slowly began to crouch towards the ground. 

I was nearly blind with fear as it lowered itself.

As its head came into my line of sight I caught my breath in my throat. Below the bridge of the nose was oversized abnormal canine, as though its snout had erupted out of a human face. Its jaws and teeth were so large, and the skull had morphed to accommodate it. 

I could feel the heat radiate from the creature. Like it was on fire, burning and expending more energy than the vessel was meant to. I felt a wave of warmth wash over my legs but I was too petrified to register it.

However abhorrently vile and evil its entire form was, it eyes were what shattered me.

It’s eyes are what I see every time I close my own, every night of my life.

They were hauntingly and devastatingly human. A man’s eyes. Green. Glassed over. The eyes nor the brows moved as it sniffed the air beside my hiding spot. They remained unfazed despite the snarl on its pale lips, or the twitch in its ears as it listened for me and instead heard something else. 

The eyes were fixed in place, looking wherever the neck told it to. I watched as it slowly tilted its head at the sound, as if its interest had been gradually piqued. 

A few seconds later I heard the quick and heavy footsteps of my Dad approaching from outside the barn, followed by Bear roaring to life. The engine bellowed as he hit the gas. 

Like a shot, the beast moved out of the barn, seemingly in one silent spider like motion. Faster than wind. The sudden absence of its immense presence gutted me.  

I don’t know when, but I realized that at some point my hand had slowly crept over my mouth in horror.

I sat there for what felt like an hour. Sure that it was by the door. Waiting for me to come running out. 

I sat, every muscle in my body tensed until I heard a howl in distance. 

When you hear a wolf howl in a scary movie, it’s so weightless. Often times it means nothing, merely an overused sound bite to set the mood.

What I heard caused whatever part of my psyche that was spiritual to tremble. 

It was both an animalistic howl and a human scream. 

It was anguish and rage and hunger. 

Tears fell as I thought of my Dad. I came out here thinking I was helping him and I might’ve just gotten him killed. The dam was ready to burst, but I had to get home first. 

I delineated for a few moments. Unabashed horror holding me in a vice. I shook violently as I clumsily came out from under the bench. Feeling something wet I looked down. I had wet myself. I realized that I hadn’t gotten lucky. I had outsmarted nothing. The beast left because I was popcorn shrimp in a hard to reach place.

1okw8yy,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1okw8yy/the_beast_in_the_pines_part_1_of_3/,"The Beast In The Pines, Part 1 of 3","My mom and dad were born and raised in Clarence, an old small town in the countryside between the midlands and the coast. A flat woodland, lush from its snaking rivers and creeks. Its swamps bled into the marshes and down through the deltas into the salty southern coast that was a little over an hour away. Clarence was the little nothing-town people passed when they drove down to the beach for vacation. 

My grandparents, Nanny and Papa, owned a pine tree farm in Clarence. 100 acres, and 75 of those acres were rows upon rows of loblolly pine trees. They lived on the property in a small farmhouse at the end of a long dirt driveway. It was small, and while it may have been nearly prehistoric, it never felt creepy. It felt like a cozy respite, a home away from home; sitting like an island in the middle of a large yard dotted with gnarled towering oak, walnut, and pecan trees. There were rickety barns as old as the dirt they sat on. Sprawling garden beds with herbs, flowers and vegetables. Wooden arbors overgrown with pluming heaps of muscadine grape vines. All acting as a buffer for the pine rows that surrounded the house on three sides. 

The remaining 20-or-so acres behind the pine rows were dense woods, cut down the middle by a winding trail that lead to the river. Nanny and Papa had clear-cut those 75 acres and planted the pines about 10 years prior. Papa passed away when I was small, and Nanny wasn’t far behind him, passing a few years later.

We inherited their cherished little farmhouse and pine tree farm.

We couldn’t live at the farm, of course. My Dad already had a job, and nobody gets a weekly paycheck to watch pine trees grow. So while adding the upkeep of a farm would be a heavy burden on top of a 9-5 work week, it was a labor of love that my parents were used to. Before Nanny passed, we would come down to Clarence to visit her every other weekend, giving her a hand with house work and yard work- especially as she got older. In the spring and summer it was more like every weekend, a constant battle for my Dad to keep the vegetation from taking over.

Despite how exhausting it sounded, my busy-body parents enjoyed it. The farm was a way of staying near their family and friends, all while enjoying the rural lifestyle of their hometown again. Getting themselves and their only daughter away from the buzz of suburbia.

At the time of this story, the pines were somewhere between 12-15ft tall. Nanny had passed away in October and we didn’t return until spring that next year. It was the mid 90s, and I was 8 years old. 

We left home that March on a Friday afternoon and head down the interstate towards Clarence and our pine tree farm, a routine that we knew well. It was a 45 or-so minute drive, and once we pulled into town and got situated, Dad would stay at the house and start on yard-work. Mom and I would go to the grocery store, getting enough food to last us until we left Sunday afternoon.

The only grocery store in Clarence was the old Piggly Wiggly. I distinctly remember the sweet wrinkled smiles of its employees and the smell of cigarettes that hung in the air. 

Mom and I stood in the checkout line.

“Oh shi- shoot! Oh shoot! Honey I forgot the bread, can you run and grab one for me real quick?”

I gave her a chirpy “yes ma’am” and moved swiftly towards the bread aisle. I skirted to a stop when I realized there was a small display right there by checkout. A table laid out with checkerboard table cloth, loaves carefully placed in circular tiers. I snatched up a loaf, brought it to my mom and we headed home. 

We drove back to the farmhouse in my Mom’s station wagon, a new single by Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers was on the radio. Anticipation began to build as I stared eagerly out the window, in childish awe of the countryside’s vast emerging greenery.

We turned off of the road, patches of field on either side of the long dirt driveway leading up to the farmhouse, which sat at the end like a lady. A sweet, modest, classy thing, built in 1903. She was stark white, laced with gingerbread trim. Full, blossoming azalea bushes hemmed the wide front porch like a skirt, all of her topped off with an evergreen tin roof that sang me to sleep in the rain.

My mom backed her station wagon up to the front porch and I helped her as we began to take in groceries. 

We heard him coming before we saw him. A humming engine sang over a chorus of baying hounds. 

It was Mr. Voss, our neighbor. His hunting beagles running spiritedly behind his ATV, a howling snarling cloud of dust tearing down the road before turning into our driveway.

My Dad pulled up beside us in his creaky old brown work truck, that I had affectionately named “Bear,” when I was small. Because it was brown, and it growled. 

Dad hopped out. He ruffled my hair, and gave my mom a kiss on the cheek.

“Hey squirt. Hey honey, Dan called- said we needed to talk.”

“Everything okay?”

“I guess we’ll find out. Hope so. Need any help with those groceries?”

“No, no, I’ve got my sidekick here helping me, you invite Dan inside and I’ll bring you boys something to drink.”

Dad gave me a wink and a pat on the back before he walked up to greet Mr. Voss who had pulled up and cut the power on his ATV, his dogs gallivanting off to play and sniff around. My dad always looked so big and strong to me, but next to Mr Voss he looked small. I heard the frame creak as he dismounted his machine. 

Daniel Voss was Clarence’s nearly retired fire chief, and when he wasn’t in uniform he was in camo. He shook Dad’s hand with a pursed smile under his mustache, and nodded towards my mother and me.

“Mrs Willis, little Miss Willis,” 

He directed his attention back to my dad. “Thanks for letting me stop by, Peter.”

“Hey, no problem man. Everything alright? You sounded serious over the phone.”

My mom took the last bag of groceries and shooed me off to play. I was old enough to understand that the adults were talking and I needed to scadaddle. However, I was also a talented eavesdropper, as most children are. I ran along the side of the house, sneaking in through the back door. I found a nice hiding spot behind a small wooden bench in the hallway. There was a mirror on the wall, giving me a peak into the living room where Dad knelt striking a match in the fireplace, while Mr. Voss made comments about the weather and the sitting president. 

After Mom had put away the groceries she joined them with a handful of empty glasses. She grabbed a bottle of whisky from the top of the china cabinet and poured them all a shot of the syrupy golden spirit. Mr Voss sat in the tattered plaid wingback by the fireplace, a small modest flame beginning to crackle in its hearth. He laced and re-laced his fingers, as if he was somewhat apprehensive to begin the conversation until suddenly he cleared his throat.

“So Peter, Lori, I know y’all just rolled into town, but I had to fill you folks in on what’s been going on around here lately. It’s a matter of safety, especially with yer little youngin’ running around.”

I always thought it was such a shame that Mr Voss chewed tobacco all the time. Not only because I thought spitting dip was gross, but because it prevented him from speaking as much. Mr Voss sounded like the lowest string on a fiddle, his vocal chords oiled with old southern blood. A lullaby with seamless rises and dips in cadence, every sentence a resonant stanza in a ballad. He would recall a trip to the post office to the tune of an old campfire story. 

That early evening in March, as dusk and its chill fell upon the treetops of Clarence and the sun sank low in a peach colored sky, I noticed that Mr Voss’ speech was unobscured by his usual lip full of dip. 

I settled into my hiding spot. This must be serious. Mr Voss was about to spin a yarn.

“So, all of this started in late November, best we can all surmise. Rumors began floating around right after Thanksgiving. Late November, 'ya know, 'ya had boys out there on their land or their buddy’s land hunting deer and ducks, doves and geese. Fat and happy in their camo, believe me I was one of ‘em. But a few of ‘em made some grizzly discoveries. They, uh, found some animal carcasses while they were huntin’.” 

The puzzled looks on my parents faces were suddenly imbued with concern. Mr Voss took a sip of his whisky and continued, 

“As I’m sure you both know, eastwards, right yander across the river from your property is Ed Kerry’s huntin’ land. He’s got about 50 acres or thereabouts. Well, Kerry and his boys were huntin’ in the wee hours of the morning, planning on shacking up in a little hunting stand near a clearing in the center of the property. Once they got up there and started lookin’ around, they found a buck-”

His voice cracked for a moment as his eyes flickered between Mom and Dad. 

“-a *mutilated* buck… At first, they thought it was a pack of coyotes, maybe a bobcat. But the more they saw, the harder it was to rationalize in their minds. Now Peter, Lori, I don’t mean to be graphic, but I think it’s important that you know the details.” 

He paused, waiting for one of them to stop him, but neither did. 

“It was fresh. The neck was broken, violently. It had been ‘eviscerated’ as one of Kerry’s boys put it. Ed said it was a mess, carnage just- everywhere. Something had taken a bite through its leg at the haunches, cracked right through the bones, and crushed the socket when it ripped it out. Ed said the bite was this big,”

He gestured, but from outside of my peeping-mirror’s view.

My Dad exhaled in disbelief.

My mom winced, a pained look on her face.

“My God, Dan.”

“By December’s end they had found that buck, and a few more animals torn up to a similar degree. The week before Christmas, I was in the field near the border of your property, and I saw a lump of fur layin' off yander in the field. I was worried it was one of my beagles. But once I got up close to it I saw it was a coyote. There were these deep gashes, from the tips of the ribs on one side to the tips of the ribs on the other. I could see the oval shape of the bite mark, it had a set of jaws- I mean a *big* set jaws, like Ed had said. Must’ve just held its ribcage in its mouth and bitten down on it.”

 Mr Voss paused, lost in thought for a moment.

“Peter I’ve never seen anything like it. It was a nightmare, I’m just glad the wife didn’t stumble on it.”

Mr Voss downed what was left of his whisky. I heard the clink of his glass as he sat it on coffee table. 

“Then, about 2 weeks later David Kilpatrick and his daughter were out huntin’ on Kerry’s land. 'Ya know Kerry’s boy, Joey, been sweet on her for a while, so Kerry lets Dave take her out there huntin’. Give Joey something to bond with her over and all that. Well, the little lady bags her a doe, so her and Dave head over to it, trudging through all the brush and fallen leaves and what have 'ya to tag it. As they’re walking over, girl goes to hop over this recently fallen sweet gum tree. That poor child landed in a dead buck’s corpse. It was almost all skeleton, but fallin into a leathery cracked-open rib cage shakes her up pretty good. Dave said that its head was all gnawed up with big ol’ teeth marks, and the antlers were crunched. Now I don’t know about you but I’ve never heard of a bite that’d crunch antlers on a deer like that.”

My dad shook his head, staring off in a daze. “No, never.”

“Well, then Neal found another coyote, said it looked just like the one on my property. But who knows, it could’ve been skinned alive and split in half and Neal wouldn’t mention it. You know Neal, you could tie him to the railroad tracks and he’d barely mumble about it. Last thing I’d heard was a week ago when Bill found a doe. He was near the border of your property, said he’d been fixing a fence post earlier that day and left his pack of smokes out there. So he hopped in his truck in his pajamas that night and went back to fetch 'em. The same fence post he’d fixed was broken again, and not 10 feet from it was a doe. She’d been ripped apart at the rib cage. Bill said it looked like a damn frog dissection from high school.”

All of them were silent for a long moment, the only sound the crackling in the fireplace.

Dad spoke up, “What is everybody thinking? A bear?”

I heard Mr Voss sniff, as he nodded. “Bear. Maybe a big wolf.”

“I’ve heard of bear wandering down this far south occasionally, but a wolf? I don’t know…”

Mr Voss inclined his hand toward the the whisky bottle on the table, Dad encouraged him to help himself, so Mr Voss poured everyone another finger.

“A bear, a wolf, whatever it is- it’s a devil. The damage it does is just- gruesome.” 

“Nobody's found any tracks?”

“Not in the leaves. You know how it is this time of year. You’re practically wading through ‘em.”

Mr Voss sighed as he fiddled with the glass, so small in his hands.

“But I wanted to catch you as soon as you arrived, Peter, and I know I don’t need to spell this out for you, yer a smart fella. But we’re finding bodies north, south, east and west of here, and l’m not trying to alarm you folks but- I think you know as well as I do that you might have some dead animals on your property.”

At that I decided to make my exit, sneaking away from my hiding spot. I figured I would need to be in position when Mom or Dad came to tell me about my inevitable new ground rules. 

I ran off to the squatty structure near the back of the house, what my Nanny had called “The Kitty Cat Barn.” It was a dilapidated flat-roof barn, enlaced with morning glories that crawled through the rusted rotting holes in its ancient metal siding. It seems to have once been a small barn for a couple of work animals like donkeys or small horses, but Papa had put shelves up and Nanny just used it to store her preserves. However as she and Papa got older, they garnered a large collection of stray cats, as the sweet and elderly have a habit of doing. So near the end of their life, they gave away all their preserves to their kids and their friends from church and stocked the shelves instead with baskets and boxes, lined with soft old towels and worn rags. Setting out a couple dozen of little bowls for them to eat from. When we weren’t there, one of our neighbors, Mrs. Kerry, gladly came out and fed them for us in exchange for herbs from the garden, though she rarely ever took any. 

I squatted on the dirt floor of the barn. It wasn’t long before a handful of kittens clumsily wandered out to investigate my presence. Moments later, what I assumed was their mother, came over and began nuzzling up against me. I rubbed gently behind her velvety ears before walking out of the barn. I made sounds gesturing for the kittens to come out into the grass to play, but their mood shifted and they would not come. They only stood in the doorway beside their mother, watching me. I scoffed. *Cats*.

Not a moment later, Mom came over, asking if we could talk. We sat on one of the steps of the back door stoop. She gave me a frank but watered down version of Mr. Voss’s story, then laid down the law. 

 “No playing in the pine rows, and no going outside for any reason after sunset. If you see something, anything, out of the ordinary- come tell myself or your father, immediately. Are we clear?”

“Yes ma’am.”

She asked if knew what to do if I was approached by a bear or a wolf, and I prattled off the steps to her. Don’t run. Back away slowly. If it approaches you, try to make yourself look big. All that. I can tell this relaxed her a bit, and she told me to have fun playing, and to be careful. 

The rest of the day was as pleasant as any day when you were 8. I ran aimlessly all over the yard, not much different from Mr Voss’s beagles. I stopped by the arbor to pick muscadine grapes. I helped Mom do some work in the flower beds, and before I knew it it was time to come inside. She threw a Disney movie into the small tube television in my room while she worked in the kitchen. Dad came in and washed up from doing yard work all day, the farmhouse’s old pipes groaning as he showered. We had dinner that night, I can’t recall what it was, but it was warm and I went back for seconds. After Dad and I cleaned the kitchen for Mom, we all sat at on the floor of the living room, playing Old Maid and talking by the fire. As the evening drew to a close, we all started getting ready for bed. 

That was the first night I saw the beast.

I remember it well. 

After I had given Dad a kiss and told him goodnight, Mom tucked me into bed under the fresh linens she had put on earlier that afternoon. She kissed my head reminding me to say my prayers before turning off the lights and closing the door, bidding me goodnight. 

Prayers said, I waited for sleep to overcome me but it never did. I tossed and turned for a while, before quietly sliding out of bed and slinking over to my window. The cats would always come out at night, and the view from outside of my bedroom window happened to be a particularly high traffic cat crossing. 

There were bushes beneath my window, and looking past them you could see paths that wound between and around garden beds brimming with various flowers and herbs. Behind them was the smallest of the barns that adorned the yard, Nanny had used it for storing gardening equipment and potting soil. It may have been geriatric, but it was a sturdy structure. It had survived an oak falling on it a couple years before and still stood tall. Behind it was a small stretch of field, and then the sea of pine rows.

I peered out of the antique, single pane glass. Keeping my breaths shallow as to not fog it up. I searched the shadows for cats, when my eye caught something in the distance. Deer occasionally appeared during these midnight matinees, strolling in the field or leaping through the pine rows. 

But this shape wasn’t moving like that.

The more I focused in on it, the more I saw that it was larger than I had thought. Larger than a deer. My sleepy brain began to dial in, seemingly aware that this was something outside of our routine viewing. I concentrated on the shape, holding my breath so as to ease my face as close to the glass as possible.

It prowled beneath the branches, its spine arched, its limbs creeping like a spider. Slow, deliberate movements, its ashen form lurked in the dark obscurity of the pine rows. It horrified me to think that if I hadn’t been deliberately looking at it, I could have cast a glance out the window and not even noticed it. 

Being that I was child, I did what any child might do. In my horror, I hyperventilated and broke into tears. I went running into my parents’ room. Desperate and pitiful, trying to explain to them what I saw. Mom was quick to fall into her maternal instincts, holding me close, wiping away my tears and stroking my hair. My Dad rubbed my back to comfort me, but his mind had gone back to the discussion with Mr Voss. 

“Did you see its face honey? Did it look like a bear?”

I quickly shook my head, eyes still wet with tears. 

“No- no it wasn’t a bear. It was too… too tall and long. A- a bear would be… less- gangly. This wasn’t. And it didn’t have any fur. It was-”

The more I thought back on the beast the more scared I became, all over again, until I burst into tears. I buried my face into my mother’s shoulder.

“It was so awful,” I sobbed, 

“I just want it to never come back.” 

My parents exchanged sympathetic looks. I slept in bed with them that night.

The next day was business as usual. In the morning after breakfast I helped Mom with some chores and then was released into the yard to play. I rode my bike up and down the dirt driveway while I listened to my Walkman. Mom watched me from the front porch while she mended some of Dad’s overalls. After a while she called me to help her again in the garden. We watered and weeded until it was time for lunch. Mom made grilled cheese and tomato soup. Dad came in, just having finished weed-eating, so he was a little dirty and peppered with blades of grass. We talked and ate and joked around. It wasn’t until Mom and I were doing the dishes that I noticed that Dad had vanished.

“Where’s Dad?” I asked, a little incredulously, at the absence of my dishwashing partner.

Mom’s eyes never left her work as she spoke, 

“He’s meeting Mr Voss.”

“Why?”

“Just to check out the Pine Rows”

She said nonchalantly. I didn’t press her about it, I knew they were out searching for dead animals.

Dad didn’t return until it was nearly dinner time. He didn’t say hey, he didn’t go to the kitchen for something to drink, he went straight to the shower. I could hear the pipes from my bedroom. During dinner, Dad seemed tired, but he put on a tired smile, asking me about my day and what all Mom and I had been up to. I had a feeling he didn’t want me to ask about his day, so I blabbed about everything Mom and I had done, how the cats were acting, and the songs I listened to on my Walkman. After we ate, I asked if I could go watch a movie in my room until lights out. My parents eagerly obliged. 

I sat cross legged on my bed, pretending to watch the Black Cauldron, I saw Dad pass my bedroom door. I tiptoed over, peaking my head out, watching him make his way wearily through the house and out to the front porch. I heard the pipes creak and knew Mom would be joining him shortly. 

Sensing an interesting conversation on the horizon, I took up a hiding spot near a coat rack by the front door, with a great view out the window and onto the front porch. I watched as Dad fell back into a rocking chair, exhausted. He packed and lit his briar pipe. The sky bore pearly hues of blush and lilac as it laid the day to rest. Dad leaned back, the embers in his pipe akin to the glow of the sunset as he took a long deep pull, exhaling a swirling plume of smoke.

I ducked down as Mom walked by. Her skin still rosey from her hot shower. Her hair was thrown up in a bun, and all her makeup was off. But she was more beautiful than the dusk sky, and Dad’s eyes corroborated my opinion. 

She met his gaze with a gentle smile, joining him in an adjacent rocking chair with a glass of wine in one hand and a beer in another. 

“I saw your bloody jeans in the hamper. I assume you had a 'work boots' kind of day.” She said with a weak laugh.

Dad scoffed. Mom always teased him for wearing the same pair of very-off-white New Balances all the time. She used to make comments to me on the days she saw them sitting by the back door, saying that he must be out doing dirty work. 

“You and Dan found an animal out there today?”

“Multiple.” Dad replied, his pipe hanging from the corner of his mouth as he cracked open his beer. 

“Two deer, a coyote, and a bobcat. We buried one of the deer and the bobcat. The rest of them were decayed enough or out of the way enough that we said ‘to hell with it.’”

Mom pensively said nothing.

“Dan called his game warden buddy, kind of a jack-ass, in my opinion. He told us to get photographic evidence. So Dan snapped some photos, said he’s gonna get ‘em developed tomorrow afternoon.”

The were a few lingering moments of silence until Mom spoke, asking softly,  

“What had happened to them?”

I heard Dad’s pipe clack between his teeth after taking another pull. By then the woody aroma had drifted into the house from under the front door. The smell of his tobacco was earthy, rich and sweet. He paused, taking a swig of his beer before answering. 

“A few of the deer seemed to have recently rotted down to their skeletons. Lots of their bones were broken, so we couldn’t quite put together what had happened to them; and ya’ know the vultures had probably gotten to ‘em and moved stuff around too. The coyote carcass was maybe a month old, it looked something had put a bunch of weight down on its ribs and crushed it. The bobcat-“

Dad stopped for a moment, as if remembering in awe.

“The bobcat was fresh Lori, real fresh. Past 24 hours fresh.”

“Oh my God, Peter.”

“It was a big one too. We found it at the base of a black walnut tree. It looked like it’s spine had been snapped against the trunk, and then something just-“ dad gestured with his hands, digging at the air. Sparing the gory details.

“All the blood on my clothes was from the Bobcat.”

“Well, thank God we didn’t let Amy play in the pine rows yesterday, how far was it from the house?”

“It was near the back of the rows, towards the woods. After we found and buried it we decided to call it quits for the day, but we’ll finish tomorrow, Dan said he’d help me.”

“Finish?”

“Yeah, we only got halfway around the pines, Lori. We still have to look around the other half tomorrow.”

The quiet returned for a few moments. Hanging in the air with the smoke from Dad’s pipe.

“Lori, don’t let Amy out of your sight.” I saw Mom nodding her head.

“I’m gonna keep the Benelli by the back door, it’s the semi-automatic, I remember you said you felt comfortable with that one. And I’m gonna keep the thirty-thirty, the Marlin, by the front door. I doubt it would just come up to the house in broad daylight, but I want you to be prepared in case I’m not here at the house with you.”

“That’s a good idea. And I think when Amy plays outside I need to tell her to stay in view of the windows. So you or I can see her.”

“Okay, good thinking. And we’ll need to ask her not to have her Walkman on her ears while she’s out there. I don’t want something sneaking up on her.”

Mom scoffed, “She’s not gonna like that.”

“Nah, she’s smart. If we explain it to her I’m sure she’ll understand.”

I didn’t like that. 

But I knew as well as they did that I would, in all likelihood, comply. Mom and Dad were reasonable, so I usually did.

“I know this is all scary for her- shit, it’s scary for all of us.”

“What the hell do you think this thing is Peter?”

 Dad let out a long exasperated sigh, as though he’d been asking himself that very thing all day. “The best thing I can figure is a bear. A very, very large bear. But who knows, I mean, we looked, but we didn’t see any tracks or scat or anything.”

“There were no tracks near the path? Even near the bobcat?”

Dad shook his head, “Too many pine needles. I mean years and years worth. We saw indentions in the earth under them, but nothing we could decipher.”

Dad finished his beer, setting it down on the ground by his rocking chair.

“Tomorrow, Dan’s gonna help me check the second half of the pine rows. He said one day next week he could send his nephews out on their four wheelers to check the woods that back up to the river.”

“Oh gosh is that safe?”

“It’s been a few years but those little rascals are grown, they’re young men now, they’re almost as tall as Dan.”

Mom hummed, not convinced, but opting to move on. “That’s nice of Dan to help you.”

“Yeah, he didn’t ask for anything but I told him I’d throw him and his nephews some cash for the help. I wish I could say I was hopeful, but I worry what those boys might find out there.”

I heard one of their rocking chairs creak as they moved to stand up, so I quietly scurried back off to my room. My parents didn’t bring it up to me that night or ever, didn’t say anything about it at all. Likely fearful that I would have another “nightmare.”

The last day, Sunday afternoon, Mom and I did the laundry and packed our things. The packing didn’t take long. We left most of our stuff behind, seeing that we would be back next weekend. Once I had my little red and white polka dot duffle bag tucked in the trunk of her station wagon Mom told me I could play until we left in a couple of hours. I climbed my favorite tree, an oak near the back door that Dad had nailed wooden steps onto. Mom sat outside with me, folding laundry. I finished my Goosebumps book, so I examined my pockets and discovered a long screw. Lord know where I’d found it or why I’d picked it up but I decided it was time to carve my initials into a tree. 

Mom and I both heard the phone in the house ring, so she hopped up to get it. Probably Aunt Cheryl. She had been meaning to stop by that weekend but Mom had told her it wasn’t a great time. While carving an “A” from way up in the tree I saw Dad coming over from the shop barn. It was the largest of the barns, and Papa had used it as a workshop. From the shade of the enormous oak beside the barn, it looked like Dad had grabbed a rag, using it to wipe something on his shirt. As he stepped out into the light I could see that it was blood. Red, fresh.

Dad didn’t see me in the tree, so he didn't put on any heirs. He pulled his baseball cap off and wiped the sweat on his forehead with his arm. For a busy-body who normally took such long purposeful strides, his steps were slow. Heavy. His face was so white. His eyes were locked onto the ground in front of him as he walked. My dad looked scared. 

Mom tried to covertly put his dirty clothes in a bag while Dad showered and got changed. I didn’t say anything. Dad didn’t know I’d seen him, and Mom thought I was none the wiser. We turned off all the lights, locked all the doors, and then hit the road for home. Looking out my window at the lush greenery of the countryside that had so enamored me only days before, I couldn’t help but think now that it only acted as a shroud, a living, flowering veil that hid the beast lurking within. 

Back at home in the sardine can of suburbia, any moment absent of conscious thought was overcome with visions of the beast. If I had been any older, it would have been an easy write off, *“its just a nightmare,” “you’re crazy,” “go see a psychologist;”* but I wasn’t. I was an 8 year old little girl who read mythology encyclopedias and fairy tale compendiums like I was going for a PhD. I actively side stepped mushroom rings for fear of being kidnapped by the fae. A small piece of every Little Debbie cake I got was left near the crawl space door in case we had hobgoblins or brownies living under our house (which at the time, I seriously suspected we did).

My parents, the logic-bound adults could chock it all up to a subconscious presentation of a fear response, but I didn’t want to lie to myself.

I knew what I saw. 

As harrowing as it was, I kept mulling it over in my mind. Turning it over, rotating it at different angles, all in hopes of better understanding what it really was- the devil outside my bedroom window. If I was acting spacey, my friends at school didn’t say anything, at least not to my face. In the hallway, at lunch, at P.E. It possessed my every thought. 

The list of things I didn’t know about it was infinite, so I started with what I did know about it. 

It was large. Tall. I tried to think of it in comparison to the pines, and in doing so I stumbled upon a memory. It was a year before Nanny died, I was small, but not small enough to forget. It was the last time she was able to walk the pine rows with me. Her hair was as white as her sweet little farmhouse, and her bones burled and bent with age. Her voice was as gentle as the rustle in the pine needles. She said that because the pines were all planted so close together, the lowest of the branches wouldn’t get enough sunlight. As a result, they would drop off while the higher branches would reach upwards to take in more sunlight. I remember her smiling, as if that fact meant something to her.

She said that Papa had measured, and most of the branches in the pine rows were 5-7 feet from the ground. 

With that information at my disposal. I did some guesswork, but my safe guess was that it had been at least 4 feet, or probably more like 5 feet tall, on all fours.

It’s torso and appendages were lean. Not stocky, like a bear’s. Bears weren’t built that way. Why was I still thinking about bears? It definitely wasn’t a bear. What features I did see resembled a wolf, but wolves weren’t that large, that hairless, or that lanky. Neither were bears. My head began to throb. Whatever small annoying part of my brain *had* started developing was trying desperately to compare it to what I knew to be real. Thankfully the rest of my mind was fantastical and thought mermaids existed, so instead of having a psychological breakdown like an adult, I came to grips with the fact that this beast was a wolf-like and in all likelihood a werewolf. But I needed to do some research.  

That day after school, I asked Mom to take me to the library, a request she was used to. On the car ride there, she asked me what kind of book I was going to look for. So I explained my werewolf theory to her. A decision I immediately regretted when I saw the pity and concern within her eyes in the rear view mirror. 

“Honey, I know we’ve talked about all of this with the fairies and the mermaids and the unicorns, but werewolves aren’t real honey. I love that you have such a vivid imagination, but you’ve got to be realistic. I mean, sure, it might have been that bear or wolf out in the woods, but it was probably just a nightmare-“

“It couldn’t be a nightmare, I was at the window, and I know what I saw! It wasn’t normal looking- It didn’t look like a bear or a wolf, it was something else. I’m 100% sure that I saw what I saw! Mom, I swear- I swear I’m not lying.”

I saw the pained deliberation in her eyes. Outside of my fascination and proclivity for fairy stories I was pretty practical for my age. I listened to Mom and Dad when they told me things, I was forthcoming and honest if I did something I wasn’t supposed to. I wouldn’t blatantly lie to my Mom, and she knew that.

“Well, then, baby… if you really did see what you think you saw then- well, then it must have been a nightmare. And you’ve slept walked before! You know you were probably just sleep walking, had a nightmare, and woke at the window.”

My brow furrowed, taking what my mom said into consideration but not able to convince myself. I stared out the window in deep thought until we pulled up to the library.

Once we arrived, I didn’t have to worry about trying to give my Mom the slip. My love of books and stories came from her, and she made a B-line for the mystery section. Despite her dismissal of my werewolf theory, she loved spooky stories. 

  After collecting a few books from the sections labeled “folklore” and “nature science,” I found an empty table and started to read. I skimmed through a couple of books on mythology and American folklore and the like, none of its pages revealing any groundbreaking revelations. Silver bullets, transformation under the light of the moon, all the usual factoids. What was highly informative, however, was the expository book on wolves. 

How fast they were, how much power and stamina they possessed, how strong their bite was, how sharp their eyes were, how keen their sense of smell was; all the things that made them great hunters. I kept in mind that this was all a baseline for this creature. At the *very least* it did all these things. The thought overcame me with dread. I didn’t exactly calculate the metrics, but I knew that this monster likely doubled if not tripled anything a wolf could do. 

Knowing that time was running out before Mom came to fetch me, I ran over to the children’s section and grabbed a Junie B. Jones book I hadn’t read yet, as well as the newest Goosebumps book.

When I approached Mom, I tried to hide my wolf book under my selection of age appropriate literature, but Lori didn’t miss a thing.

“Study of the American Wolf, huh?”

I tried to brush past her comment and critical side eye,

“I thought you said I needed to be more realistic. Wolves are real, aren’t they?”

She sighed, rolling her eyes, handing it and my other books over to the librarian for check out. 

That evening at home, we had finished dinner and cleared the dining room table to play Jenga. The phone rang, and Dad stepped out of the room and into the kitchen to take it. Dad answered in a hushed tone, keeping his voice down. Unfortunately for Dad, he wasn’t a great whisperer. 

“Hey Dan… find any-?…How many…?” 

Silence. For a long while, silence. Mom and I locked eyes.

“God… Yeah, I see. Thank the boys for me… I’ll pay em for all their help… we both know that’s a lot of work. So sorry they had to… yeah… well… my God… I don’t know either, man… Yeah… Yeah… Thanks again Dan.”

Dad returned, doing his best to hide the weary look on his face. He glanced over at my Mom, and then at me, giving me a smile. I smiled back timidly. 

I looked back and forth between Mom and Dad, as she gave him a look that said, *‘You know she heard all that, right?’*

Dad hummed, pursing his lips in a wry way. I couldn’t help but laugh at him. But the quiet that followed it sobered the moment.

""Amy,” My Dad paused as he weighed his words. “Your old man… is an awful whisperer.”

“Yeah, you kind of are.” I snickered.

“I know you’re a smart girl, even if you didn’t just hear me on the phone, I know that you know that some scary stuff is going on right now.”

I nodded. Dad sat back down at the table, folding his hands as he spoke.

“But I want you to know that while we’re at the farm, you aren’t in any danger as long as you listen to what your mother and I say. Follow the rules, stay in the yard, and don’t go into the pine rows. I don’t want this to cause you too much distress, because none of this is going to last forever. 

Mr Voss, myself and some other people in the community are getting evidence together, and filling paperwork out- which is stupid- but we are doing it to see if we can get the game warden or someone from DNR involved. Whoever ends up helping us, they will know what to do. Its their job, that my taxes pay for by the way, and the fact that they haven’t sent someone out already is-“

Mom kicked Dad under the table. Dad cleared his throat. 

“The point is, whatever this thing is, a bear, a wolf, its just wandered too far out of its habitat. Whenever someone from the state *does* get out there, they’ll either capture it or kill it or do whatever they have to to keep people safe, to keep us safe.” 

I nodded again with a small smile. I thought it was sweet that Mom and Dad were trying to keep my spirits up, especially when I could tell all of this weighed on them so heavily. 

I tried to lighten the mood a little bit, the way any 8 year old girl would, by being a little snarky.

“So, what will we do if the game warden looks at everything and says its a werewolf?” I said. 

To me it was only kind of a joke, but to Mom and Dad it was ridiculous, and that was all that mattered. Dad smirked.

“Ah yes, your mother told me all about your werewolf theory.”

“Well, what if it is?” I crossed my arms, making a face that wrinkled my nose.

Dad put on a gravely serious look, laying it on thick. 

“If it is, I’ll just have to melt down your mother’s silver dinnerware set into bullets.”

“Oh no you won’t! That set is an heirloom!” 

Dad dramatically lifted his hands, dropping them back down on the table in defeat.

“Well then, I guess your mother is just going to let us all die,”

Mom and I cracked up. Dad attempted to remain dry but the corners of his mouth crept up into a smile. 

“We’ll just have to try and stab the thing with silver butter knives. That’ll show ‘em.”

We cut-up for the rest of the evening, our hearts full of mirth as we turned in for the night. None of us spoke about it again for the rest of the week. But it festered in our minds, leaked into every unoccupied moment. I could see the apprehension buried in their eyes when they were lost in thought, driving, cooking dinner, staring out the window. I lied awake in bed every night, counting down the days until Friday, when we returned to the farm.

This being said, I was your typical teenager drinking energy drinks and preworkout for the gym and some days, around 4 days per week, I’d be consuming a total of about 1000 mg of caffeine (2 cups of coffee about 100 mg, 2 monsters/redbulls about 400 mg, and loaded preworkout which was about 400 mg as well). This being said I’ve cut back drastically and only consume about 2 cups of coffee and an occasional alani each day, so about 300 mg a day. 

However with all this information, no, I don’t drink coffee for the “energy”, I just love the taste of coffee and Red Bull. I love it so much I even buy candles that smell like coffee and I LOVE coffee breath. Everything about it is great to me. 

This is where the real issue comes in. After these days of drinking anywhere from 300 mg to 1000mg of caffeine. I am always tired. People have said this is incredibly weird and are often surprised seeing me drink my nightly cup of coffee before I go to bed. I get asked “how do you sleep at night?” All the time and my simple answer is that the coffee can help put me to sleep.

# Poltergeist

**Classification**: Supernatural Powers, Death-based Abilities, Ghost Physiology, Horror-Themed Abilities

**Type**: Passive

**Energy Consumption**: None

**Threat Level**: 1

**Summary**:

After deciding to help Toritsuka with his “spiritual training,” he promised to find the ghost of the inventor of coffee jelly, and Saiki managed to improve one of his existing abilities.

Before, when he separated his spirit from his body, the only power he could use was **Telepathy**. During his “training,” Saiki managed to upgrade his ghost rank to **Poltergeist**. Now he can interact more freely with his surroundings and even use abilities such as **Psychokinesis**, **Teleportation**, and even enchant places!

# Trivia

* Another reason why he decided to help is because there was an increase in evil spirits.
* Toritsuka learned how to astral project! But only for 1:30 minutes.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

1okw4uk,https://www.reddit.com/r/onlinecourses/comments/1okw4uk/tried_skool_for_my_community_heres_what_i_think/,Tried Skool for my community. Here's what I think - Honest experience after 8 months,"I was exhausted from jumping between Slack, [Circle](http://withhimanshu.com/circle-so-review), and a Facebook group trying to keep my community together. Someone mentioned Skool. I rolled my eyes - another platform promising to ""change everything.""

But I was bleeding members. People were confused about where to find what. I was spending more time managing tech than actually helping people.

So I tried it.

**Week 1: This is stupid simple**

Set up took 20 minutes. That felt wrong. Where were all the complicated features? The automation sequences? The 47 different permission levels?

There weren't any.

Just discussions, a classroom for content, and a leaderboard. That's it.

I panicked a little. How was I supposed to build a ""sophisticated"" community with this?

**Month 1: The shift nobody warns you about**

Here's what ducked with my head: Without all the fancy features to hide behind, I had to actually show up.

No automated welcome sequences to fake connection. No complex funnels to distract from weak content. Just me, writing posts, answering questions, being present.

It was uncomfortable as hell.

**Month 3: Something weird happened**

My members started talking to each other. Not performative LinkedIn-style commenting. Real conversations.

Someone posted about struggling with pricing their services. Instead of waiting for my ""expert answer,"" three other members jumped in with their experiences.

I just watched. It was beautiful.

The gamification thing everyone talks about? I ignored it for two months. Then one member said ""I know it's silly but seeing my name climb the leaderboard makes me want to contribute more.""

So we leaned into it. But we made it about giving, not getting.

**Month 6: The truth about Skool**

It's not revolutionary. It's actually kind of basic.

The mobile app is mediocre. You can't segment audiences. The analytics are basically non-existent. Every Skool community looks identical.

But here's what I realized: I spent 6 months NOT thinking about the platform. I spent it thinking about my people.

**The stuff that actually matters:**

* My show-up rate for live calls went from 10% to 40%
* Members started creating their own weekly accountability threads
* Two people partnered up and launched a business together
* Someone told me they finally felt ""safe to be in a business space""

That last one hit different.

**Would I recommend it?**

If you want to build a cult-like following with complex ascension models and sophisticated tracking - no.

If you want a place where people can just... be people while growing their business - maybe.

The $99/month stings when you realize you still need other tools. But I waste more than that on coffee I don't drink. Now they have a $9/mo which is best to get started with tbh.

If you are planning to build your community, best is to get on the [FREE trial for $9 plan](http://withhimanshu.com/skool).

**The real review:**

Skool didn't transform my community.

It just got out of the way enough for my community to transform itself.

Sometimes that's all you need.

I want to find more underrated but quaint/quieter corners of Seoul. For example, I love this little spot right by 이대 station that hasn't been demolished as of 2023. There were little coffee shops, a film developing store, a taxi driver buffet and businesses for the community.

1okw1ai,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1okw1ai,What's that smell? epi 2,"**Maple Butter:** This Maple Butter candle is exactly what it says it is, pure, cozy Sunday morning vibes in wax form. The scent is buttery, mapley, and warm, like someone’s flipping pancakes in the kitchen… except no one actually is. Medium throw, so it’s more like you hope breakfast is coming, not that it’s burning on the stove. Honestly, it smells like what I wish my weekends were; lounging in bed while someone else handles the syrup and the mess situation.

**Coffee House:** What can I say, if you’re looking for that rich, roasted coffeehouse aroma, keep walking. But if you’ve ever thought, *“I wish my living room smelled like a giant Tootsie Roll,”* congratulations, this candle is your soulmate. I warmed it expecting fresh-brewed coffee house magic, but instead, it’s like Willy Wonka opened a cafe and forgot the coffee beans. On a positive note - very strong throw.

**Vanilla Pumpkin Waffles:** If BBW's had an identical twin who was smarter with money, this Vanilla Pumpkin Waffles candle would be it. The scent is a 100% dupe: cozy, creamy vanilla and warm pumpkin sweetness. All for half the price. The throw? Strong enough to make your whole house smell like fall just baked itself. I truthfully don't smell any waffle at all. It’s more like pumpkin pie and vanilla frosting had a baby and named it “Waffle” for attention.  Still, at this price and power, I’ll happily live in this delicious lie.

**Toasty Hot Toddy:** If you’ve been mourning the tragic downfall of Sonoma’s (from Kohl's) Vanilla Pumpkin Latte candle (back when it actually smelled good and not like someone dumped a jar of cinnamon in your living room), this Toasty Hot Toddy candle is your sweet, creamy salvation. It’s got that dreamy blend of vanilla cream, a whisper of pecan, and just enough spice to make you feel like Fall handed you a warm drink. The throw is strong and comforting. It's not “blow-your-sinuses” strong, but “I-just-cleaned-the-house-and-deserve-this” strong. Basically, it’s the candle Sonoma ***should’ve*** stuck with before someone at headquarters hit their head and lost their scent privileges.

**Bookstore Cafe:** I wanted this candle to smell exactly like walking into a B&N, that magical mix of coffee, paper, and quiet ambition. Sadly, it didn’t quite hit the mark for me. Instead, Bookstore Cafe gives off a soft, perfumey aroma that’s pleasant and unique, just not the bookish coffee heaven I was dreaming of. The throw is a comfortable medium, enough to notice, but not enough to make your home smell like a perfume counter. It’s a nice, cozy scent… just not the B&N fantasy I had my heart (and nose) set on.

1okw0px,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1okw0px/hr_beast_in_the_pines_part_1_of_3/,"[HR] Beast In The Pines, Part 1 of 3","  


My mom and dad were born and raised in Clarence, an old small town in the countryside between the midlands and the coast. A flat woodland, lush from its snaking rivers and creeks. Its swamps bled into the marshes and down through the deltas into the salty southern coast that was a little over an hour away. Clarence was the little nothing-town people passed when they drove down to the beach for vacation. 

My grandparents, Nanny and Papa, owned a pine tree farm in Clarence. 100 acres, and 75 of those acres were rows upon rows of loblolly pine trees. They lived on the property in a small farmhouse at the end of a long dirt driveway. It was small, and while it may have been nearly prehistoric, it never felt creepy. It felt like a cozy respite, a home away from home; sitting like an island in the middle of a large yard dotted with gnarled towering oak, walnut, and pecan trees. There were rickety barns as old as the dirt they sat on. Sprawling garden beds with herbs, flowers and vegetables. Wooden arbors overgrown with pluming heaps of muscadine grape vines. All acting as a buffer for the pine rows that surrounded the house on three sides. 

The remaining 20-or-so acres behind the pine rows were dense woods, cut down the middle by a winding trail that lead to the river. Nanny and Papa had clear-cut those 75 acres and planted the pines about 10 years prior. Papa passed away when I was small, and Nanny wasn’t far behind him, passing a few years later.

We inherited their cherished little farmhouse and pine tree farm.

We couldn’t live at the farm, of course. My Dad already had a job, and nobody gets a weekly paycheck to watch pine trees grow. So while adding the upkeep of a farm would be a heavy burden on top of a 9-5 work week, it was a labor of love that my parents were used to. Before Nanny passed, we would come down to Clarence to visit her every other weekend, giving her a hand with house work and yard work- especially as she got older. In the spring and summer it was more like every weekend, a constant battle for my Dad to keep the vegetation from taking over.

Despite how exhausting it sounded, my busy-body parents enjoyed it. The farm was a way of staying near their family and friends, all while enjoying the rural lifestyle of their hometown again. Getting themselves and their only daughter away from the buzz of suburbia.

At the time of this story, the pines were somewhere between 12-15ft tall. Nanny had passed away in October and we didn’t return until spring that next year. It was the mid 90s, and I was 8 years old. 

We left home that March on a Friday afternoon and head down the interstate towards Clarence and our pine tree farm, a routine that we knew well. It was a 45 or-so minute drive, and once we pulled into town and got situated, Dad would stay at the house and start on yard-work. Mom and I would go to the grocery store, getting enough food to last us until we left Sunday afternoon.

The only grocery store in Clarence was the old Piggly Wiggly. I distinctly remember the sweet wrinkled smiles of its employees and the smell of cigarettes that hung in the air. 

Mom and I stood in the checkout line.

“Oh shi- shoot! Oh shoot! Honey I forgot the bread, can you run and grab one for me real quick?”

I gave her a chirpy “yes ma’am” and moved swiftly towards the bread aisle. I skirted to a stop when I realized there was a small display right there by checkout. A table laid out with checkerboard table cloth, loaves carefully placed in circular tiers. I snatched up a loaf, brought it to my mom and we headed home. 

We drove back to the farmhouse in my Mom’s station wagon, a new single by Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers was on the radio. Anticipation began to build as I stared eagerly out the window, in childish awe of the countryside’s vast emerging greenery.

We turned off of the road, patches of field on either side of the long dirt driveway leading up to the farmhouse, which sat at the end like a lady. A sweet, modest, classy thing, built in 1903. She was stark white, laced with gingerbread trim. Full, blossoming azalea bushes hemmed the wide front porch like a skirt, all of her topped off with an evergreen tin roof that sang me to sleep in the rain.

My mom backed her station wagon up to the front porch and I helped her as we began to take in groceries. 

We heard him coming before we saw him. A humming engine sang over a chorus of baying hounds. 

It was Mr. Voss, our neighbor. His hunting beagles running spiritedly behind his ATV, a howling snarling cloud of dust tearing down the road before turning into our driveway.

My Dad pulled up beside us in his creaky old brown work truck, that I had affectionately named “Bear,” when I was small. Because it was brown, and it growled. 

Dad hopped out. He ruffled my hair, and gave my mom a kiss on the cheek.

“Hey squirt. Hey honey, Dan called- said we needed to talk.”

“Everything okay?”

“I guess we’ll find out. Hope so. Need any help with those groceries?”

“No, no, I’ve got my sidekick here helping me, you invite Dan inside and I’ll bring you boys something to drink.”

Dad gave me a wink and a pat on the back before he walked up to greet Mr. Voss who had pulled up and cut the power on his ATV, his dogs gallivanting off to play and sniff around. My dad always looked so big and strong to me, but next to Mr Voss he looked small. I heard the frame creak as he dismounted his machine. 

Daniel Voss was Clarence’s nearly retired fire chief, and when he wasn’t in uniform he was in camo. He shook Dad’s hand with a pursed smile under his mustache, and nodded towards my mother and me.

“Mrs Willis, little Miss Willis,” 

He directed his attention back to my dad. “Thanks for letting me stop by, Peter.”

“Hey, no problem man. Everything alright? You sounded serious over the phone.”

My mom took the last bag of groceries and shooed me off to play. I was old enough to understand that the adults were talking and I needed to scadaddle. However, I was also a talented eavesdropper, as most children are. I ran along the side of the house, sneaking in through the back door. I found a nice hiding spot behind a small wooden bench in the hallway. There was a mirror on the wall, giving me a peak into the living room where Dad knelt striking a match in the fireplace, while Mr. Voss made comments about the weather and the sitting president. 

After Mom had put away the groceries she joined them with a handful of empty glasses. She grabbed a bottle of whisky from the top of the china cabinet and poured them all a shot of the syrupy golden spirit. Mr Voss sat in the tattered plaid wingback by the fireplace, a small modest flame beginning to crackle in its hearth. He laced and re-laced his fingers, as if he was somewhat apprehensive to begin the conversation until suddenly he cleared his throat.

“So Peter, Lori, I know y’all just rolled into town, but I had to fill you folks in on what’s been going on around here lately. It’s a matter of safety, especially with yer little youngin’ running around.”

I always thought it was such a shame that Mr Voss chewed tobacco all the time. Not only because I thought spitting dip was gross, but because it prevented him from speaking as much. Mr Voss sounded like the lowest string on a fiddle, his vocal chords oiled with old southern blood. A lullaby with seamless rises and dips in cadence, every sentence a resonant stanza in a ballad. He would recall a trip to the post office to the tune of an old campfire story. 

That early evening in March, as dusk and its chill fell upon the treetops of Clarence and the sun sank low in a peach colored sky, I noticed that Mr Voss’ speech was unobscured by his usual lip full of dip. 

I settled into my hiding spot. This must be serious. Mr Voss was about to spin a yarn.

“So, all of this started in late November, best we can all surmise. Rumors began floating around right after Thanksgiving. Late November, 'ya know, 'ya had boys out there on their land or their buddy’s land hunting deer and ducks, doves and geese. Fat and happy in their camo, believe me I was one of ‘em. But a few of ‘em made some grizzly discoveries. They, uh, found some animal carcasses while they were huntin’.” 

The puzzled looks on my parents faces were suddenly imbued with concern. Mr Voss took a sip of his whisky and continued, 

“As I’m sure you both know, eastwards, right yander across the river from your property is Ed Kerry’s huntin’ land. He’s got about 50 acres or thereabouts. Well, Kerry and his boys were huntin’ in the wee hours of the morning, planning on shacking up in a little hunting stand near a clearing in the center of the property. Once they got up there and started lookin’ around, they found a buck-”

His voice cracked for a moment as his eyes flickered between Mom and Dad. 

“-a *mutilated* buck… At first, they thought it was a pack of coyotes, maybe a bobcat. But the more they saw, the harder it was to rationalize in their minds. Now Peter, Lori, I don’t mean to be graphic, but I think it’s important that you know the details.” 

He paused, waiting for one of them to stop him, but neither did. 

“It was fresh. The neck was broken, violently. It had been ‘eviscerated’ as one of Kerry’s boys put it. Ed said it was a mess, carnage just- everywhere. Something had taken a bite through its leg at the haunches, cracked right through the bones, and crushed the socket when it ripped it out. Ed said the bite was this big,”

He gestured, but from outside of my peeping-mirror’s view.

My Dad exhaled in disbelief.

My mom winced, a pained look on her face.

“My God, Dan.”

“By December’s end they had found that buck, and a few more animals torn up to a similar degree. The week before Christmas, I was in the field near the border of your property, and I saw a lump of fur layin' off yander in the field. I was worried it was one of my beagles. But once I got up close to it I saw it was a coyote. There were these deep gashes, from the tips of the ribs on one side to the tips of the ribs on the other. I could see the oval shape of the bite mark, it had a set of jaws- I mean a *big* set jaws, like Ed had said. Must’ve just held its ribcage in its mouth and bitten down on it.”

 Mr Voss paused, lost in thought for a moment.

“Peter I’ve never seen anything like it. It was a nightmare, I’m just glad the wife didn’t stumble on it.”

Mr Voss downed what was left of his whisky. I heard the clink of his glass as he sat it on coffee table. 

“Then, about 2 weeks later David Kilpatrick and his daughter were out huntin’ on Kerry’s land. 'Ya know Kerry’s boy, Joey, been sweet on her for a while, so Kerry lets Dave take her out there huntin’. Give Joey something to bond with her over and all that. Well, the little lady bags her a doe, so her and Dave head over to it, trudging through all the brush and fallen leaves and what have 'ya to tag it. As they’re walking over, girl goes to hop over this recently fallen sweet gum tree. That poor child landed in a dead buck’s corpse. It was almost all skeleton, but fallin into a leathery cracked-open rib cage shakes her up pretty good. Dave said that its head was all gnawed up with big ol’ teeth marks, and the antlers were crunched. Now I don’t know about you but I’ve never heard of a bite that’d crunch antlers on a deer like that.”

My dad shook his head, staring off in a daze. “No, never.”

“Well, then Neal found another coyote, said it looked just like the one on my property. But who knows, it could’ve been skinned alive and split in half and Neal wouldn’t mention it. You know Neal, you could tie him to the railroad tracks and he’d barely mumble about it. Last thing I’d heard was a week ago when Bill found a doe. He was near the border of your property, said he’d been fixing a fence post earlier that day and left his pack of smokes out there. So he hopped in his truck in his pajamas that night and went back to fetch 'em. The same fence post he’d fixed was broken again, and not 10 feet from it was a doe. She’d been ripped apart at the rib cage. Bill said it looked like a damn frog dissection from high school.”

All of them were silent for a long moment, the only sound the crackling in the fireplace.

Dad spoke up, “What is everybody thinking? A bear?”

I heard Mr Voss sniff, as he nodded. “Bear. Maybe a big wolf.”

“I’ve heard of bear wandering down this far south occasionally, but a wolf? I don’t know…”

Mr Voss inclined his hand toward the the whisky bottle on the table, Dad encouraged him to help himself, so Mr Voss poured everyone another finger.

“A bear, a wolf, whatever it is- it’s a devil. The damage it does is just- gruesome.” 

“Nobody's found any tracks?”

“Not in the leaves. You know how it is this time of year. You’re practically wading through ‘em.”

Mr Voss sighed as he fiddled with the glass, so small in his hands.

“But I wanted to catch you as soon as you arrived, Peter, and I know I don’t need to spell this out for you, yer a smart fella. But we’re finding bodies north, south, east and west of here, and l’m not trying to alarm you folks but- I think you know as well as I do that you might have some dead animals on your property.”

At that I decided to make my exit, sneaking away from my hiding spot. I figured I would need to be in position when Mom or Dad came to tell me about my inevitable new ground rules. 

I ran off to the squatty structure near the back of the house, what my Nanny had called “The Kitty Cat Barn.” It was a dilapidated flat-roof barn, enlaced with morning glories that crawled through the rusted rotting holes in its ancient metal siding. It seems to have once been a small barn for a couple of work animals like donkeys or small horses, but Papa had put shelves up and Nanny just used it to store her preserves. However as she and Papa got older, they garnered a large collection of stray cats, as the sweet and elderly have a habit of doing. So near the end of their life, they gave away all their preserves to their kids and their friends from church and stocked the shelves instead with baskets and boxes, lined with soft old towels and worn rags. Setting out a couple dozen of little bowls for them to eat from. When we weren’t there, one of our neighbors, Mrs. Kerry, gladly came out and fed them for us in exchange for herbs from the garden, though she rarely ever took any. 

I squatted on the dirt floor of the barn. It wasn’t long before a handful of kittens clumsily wandered out to investigate my presence. Moments later, what I assumed was their mother, came over and began nuzzling up against me. I rubbed gently behind her velvety ears before walking out of the barn. I made sounds gesturing for the kittens to come out into the grass to play, but their mood shifted and they would not come. They only stood in the doorway beside their mother, watching me. I scoffed. *Cats*.

Not a moment later, Mom came over, asking if we could talk. We sat on one of the steps of the back door stoop. She gave me a frank but watered down version of Mr. Voss’s story, then laid down the law. 

 “No playing in the pine rows, and no going outside for any reason after sunset. If you see something, anything, out of the ordinary- come tell myself or your father, immediately. Are we clear?”

“Yes ma’am.”

She asked if knew what to do if I was approached by a bear or a wolf, and I prattled off the steps to her. Don’t run. Back away slowly. If it approaches you, try to make yourself look big. All that. I can tell this relaxed her a bit, and she told me to have fun playing, and to be careful. 

The rest of the day was as pleasant as any day when you were 8. I ran aimlessly all over the yard, not much different from Mr Voss’s beagles. I stopped by the arbor to pick muscadine grapes. I helped Mom do some work in the flower beds, and before I knew it it was time to come inside. She threw a Disney movie into the small tube television in my room while she worked in the kitchen. Dad came in and washed up from doing yard work all day, the farmhouse’s old pipes groaning as he showered. We had dinner that night, I can’t recall what it was, but it was warm and I went back for seconds. After Dad and I cleaned the kitchen for Mom, we all sat at on the floor of the living room, playing Old Maid and talking by the fire. As the evening drew to a close, we all started getting ready for bed. 

That was the first night I saw the beast.

I remember it well. 

After I had given Dad a kiss and told him goodnight, Mom tucked me into bed under the fresh linens she had put on earlier that afternoon. She kissed my head reminding me to say my prayers before turning off the lights and closing the door, bidding me goodnight. 

Prayers said, I waited for sleep to overcome me but it never did. I tossed and turned for a while, before quietly sliding out of bed and slinking over to my window. The cats would always come out at night, and the view from outside of my bedroom window happened to be a particularly high traffic cat crossing. 

There were bushes beneath my window, and looking past them you could see paths that wound between and around garden beds brimming with various flowers and herbs. Behind them was the smallest of the barns that adorned the yard, Nanny had used it for storing gardening equipment and potting soil. It may have been geriatric, but it was a sturdy structure. It had survived an oak falling on it a couple years before and still stood tall. Behind it was a small stretch of field, and then the sea of pine rows.

I peered out of the antique, single pane glass. Keeping my breaths shallow as to not fog it up. I searched the shadows for cats, when my eye caught something in the distance. Deer occasionally appeared during these midnight matinees, strolling in the field or leaping through the pine rows. 

But this shape wasn’t moving like that.

The more I focused in on it, the more I saw that it was larger than I had thought. Larger than a deer. My sleepy brain began to dial in, seemingly aware that this was something outside of our routine viewing. I concentrated on the shape, holding my breath so as to ease my face as close to the glass as possible.

It prowled beneath the branches, its spine arched, its limbs creeping like a spider. Slow, deliberate movements, its ashen form lurked in the dark obscurity of the pine rows. It horrified me to think that if I hadn’t been deliberately looking at it, I could have cast a glance out the window and not even noticed it. 

Being that I was child, I did what any child might do. In my horror, I hyperventilated and broke into tears. I went running into my parents’ room. Desperate and pitiful, trying to explain to them what I saw. Mom was quick to fall into her maternal instincts, holding me close, wiping away my tears and stroking my hair. My Dad rubbed my back to comfort me, but his mind had gone back to the discussion with Mr Voss. 

“Did you see its face honey? Did it look like a bear?”

I quickly shook my head, eyes still wet with tears. 

“No- no it wasn’t a bear. It was too… too tall and long. A- a bear would be… less- gangly. This wasn’t. And it didn’t have any fur. It was-”

The more I thought back on the beast the more scared I became, all over again, until I burst into tears. I buried my face into my mother’s shoulder.

“It was so awful,” I sobbed, 

“I just want it to never come back.” 

My parents exchanged sympathetic looks. I slept in bed with them that night.

The next day was business as usual. In the morning after breakfast I helped Mom with some chores and then was released into the yard to play. I rode my bike up and down the dirt driveway while I listened to my Walkman. Mom watched me from the front porch while she mended some of Dad’s overalls. After a while she called me to help her again in the garden. We watered and weeded until it was time for lunch. Mom made grilled cheese and tomato soup. Dad came in, just having finished weed-eating, so he was a little dirty and peppered with blades of grass. We talked and ate and joked around. It wasn’t until Mom and I were doing the dishes that I noticed that Dad had vanished.

“Where’s Dad?” I asked, a little incredulously, at the absence of my dishwashing partner.

Mom’s eyes never left her work as she spoke, 

“He’s meeting Mr Voss.”

“Why?”

“Just to check out the Pine Rows”

She said nonchalantly. I didn’t press her about it, I knew they were out searching for dead animals.

Dad didn’t return until it was nearly dinner time. He didn’t say hey, he didn’t go to the kitchen for something to drink, he went straight to the shower. I could hear the pipes from my bedroom. During dinner, Dad seemed tired, but he put on a tired smile, asking me about my day and what all Mom and I had been up to. I had a feeling he didn’t want me to ask about his day, so I blabbed about everything Mom and I had done, how the cats were acting, and the songs I listened to on my Walkman. After we ate, I asked if I could go watch a movie in my room until lights out. My parents eagerly obliged. 

I sat cross legged on my bed, pretending to watch the Black Cauldron, I saw Dad pass my bedroom door. I tiptoed over, peaking my head out, watching him make his way wearily through the house and out to the front porch. I heard the pipes creak and knew Mom would be joining him shortly. 

Sensing an interesting conversation on the horizon, I took up a hiding spot near a coat rack by the front door, with a great view out the window and onto the front porch. I watched as Dad fell back into a rocking chair, exhausted. He packed and lit his briar pipe. The sky bore pearly hues of blush and lilac as it laid the day to rest. Dad leaned back, the embers in his pipe akin to the glow of the sunset as he took a long deep pull, exhaling a swirling plume of smoke.

I ducked down as Mom walked by. Her skin still rosey from her hot shower. Her hair was thrown up in a bun, and all her makeup was off. But she was more beautiful than the dusk sky, and Dad’s eyes corroborated my opinion. 

She met his gaze with a gentle smile, joining him in an adjacent rocking chair with a glass of wine in one hand and a beer in another. 

“I saw your bloody jeans in the hamper. I assume you had a 'work boots' kind of day.” She said with a weak laugh.

Dad scoffed. Mom always teased him for wearing the same pair of very-off-white New Balances all the time. She used to make comments to me on the days she saw them sitting by the back door, saying that he must be out doing dirty work. 

“You and Dan found an animal out there today?”

“Multiple.” Dad replied, his pipe hanging from the corner of his mouth as he cracked open his beer. 

“Two deer, a coyote, and a bobcat. We buried one of the deer and the bobcat. The rest of them were decayed enough or out of the way enough that we said ‘to hell with it.’”

Mom pensively said nothing.

“Dan called his game warden buddy, kind of a jack-ass, in my opinion. He told us to get photographic evidence. So Dan snapped some photos, said he’s gonna get ‘em developed tomorrow afternoon.”

The were a few lingering moments of silence until Mom spoke, asking softly,  

“What had happened to them?”

I heard Dad’s pipe clack between his teeth after taking another pull. By then the woody aroma had drifted into the house from under the front door. The smell of his tobacco was earthy, rich and sweet. He paused, taking a swig of his beer before answering. 

“A few of the deer seemed to have recently rotted down to their skeletons. Lots of their bones were broken, so we couldn’t quite put together what had happened to them; and ya’ know the vultures had probably gotten to ‘em and moved stuff around too. The coyote carcass was maybe a month old, it looked something had put a bunch of weight down on its ribs and crushed it. The bobcat-“

Dad stopped for a moment, as if remembering in awe.

“The bobcat was fresh Lori, real fresh. Past 24 hours fresh.”

“Oh my God, Peter.”

“It was a big one too. We found it at the base of a black walnut tree. It looked like it’s spine had been snapped against the trunk, and then something just-“ dad gestured with his hands, digging at the air. Sparing the gory details.

“All the blood on my clothes was from the Bobcat.”

“Well, thank God we didn’t let Amy play in the pine rows yesterday, how far was it from the house?”

“It was near the back of the rows, towards the woods. After we found and buried it we decided to call it quits for the day, but we’ll finish tomorrow, Dan said he’d help me.”

“Finish?”

“Yeah, we only got halfway around the pines, Lori. We still have to look around the other half tomorrow.”

The quiet returned for a few moments. Hanging in the air with the smoke from Dad’s pipe.

“Lori, don’t let Amy out of your sight.” I saw Mom nodding her head.

“I’m gonna keep the Benelli by the back door, it’s the semi-automatic, I remember you said you felt comfortable with that one. And I’m gonna keep the thirty-thirty, the Marlin, by the front door. I doubt it would just come up to the house in broad daylight, but I want you to be prepared in case I’m not here at the house with you.”

“That’s a good idea. And I think when Amy plays outside I need to tell her to stay in view of the windows. So you or I can see her.”

“Okay, good thinking. And we’ll need to ask her not to have her Walkman on her ears while she’s out there. I don’t want something sneaking up on her.”

Mom scoffed, “She’s not gonna like that.”

“Nah, she’s smart. If we explain it to her I’m sure she’ll understand.”

I didn’t like that. 

But I knew as well as they did that I would, in all likelihood, comply. Mom and Dad were reasonable, so I usually did.

“I know this is all scary for her- shit, it’s scary for all of us.”

“What the hell do you think this thing is Peter?”

 Dad let out a long exasperated sigh, as though he’d been asking himself that very thing all day. “The best thing I can figure is a bear. A very, very large bear. But who knows, I mean, we looked, but we didn’t see any tracks or scat or anything.”

“There were no tracks near the path? Even near the bobcat?”

Dad shook his head, “Too many pine needles. I mean years and years worth. We saw indentions in the earth under them, but nothing we could decipher.”

Dad finished his beer, setting it down on the ground by his rocking chair.

“Tomorrow, Dan’s gonna help me check the second half of the pine rows. He said one day next week he could send his nephews out on their four wheelers to check the woods that back up to the river.”

“Oh gosh is that safe?”

“It’s been a few years but those little rascals are grown, they’re young men now, they’re almost as tall as Dan.”

Mom hummed, not convinced, but opting to move on. “That’s nice of Dan to help you.”

“Yeah, he didn’t ask for anything but I told him I’d throw him and his nephews some cash for the help. I wish I could say I was hopeful, but I worry what those boys might find out there.”

I heard one of their rocking chairs creak as they moved to stand up, so I quietly scurried back off to my room. My parents didn’t bring it up to me that night or ever, didn’t say anything about it at all. Likely fearful that I would have another “nightmare.”

The last day, Sunday afternoon, Mom and I did the laundry and packed our things. The packing didn’t take long. We left most of our stuff behind, seeing that we would be back next weekend. Once I had my little red and white polka dot duffle bag tucked in the trunk of her station wagon Mom told me I could play until we left in a couple of hours. I climbed my favorite tree, an oak near the back door that Dad had nailed wooden steps onto. Mom sat outside with me, folding laundry. I finished my Goosebumps book, so I examined my pockets and discovered a long screw. Lord know where I’d found it or why I’d picked it up but I decided it was time to carve my initials into a tree. 

Mom and I both heard the phone in the house ring, so she hopped up to get it. Probably Aunt Cheryl. She had been meaning to stop by that weekend but Mom had told her it wasn’t a great time. While carving an “A” from way up in the tree I saw Dad coming over from the shop barn. It was the largest of the barns, and Papa had used it as a workshop. From the shade of the enormous oak beside the barn, it looked like Dad had grabbed a rag, using it to wipe something on his shirt. As he stepped out into the light I could see that it was blood. Red, fresh.

Dad didn’t see me in the tree, so he didn't put on any heirs. He pulled his baseball cap off and wiped the sweat on his forehead with his arm. For a busy-body who normally took such long purposeful strides, his steps were slow. Heavy. His face was so white. His eyes were locked onto the ground in front of him as he walked. My dad looked scared. 

Mom tried to covertly put his dirty clothes in a bag while Dad showered and got changed. I didn’t say anything. Dad didn’t know I’d seen him, and Mom thought I was none the wiser. We turned off all the lights, locked all the doors, and then hit the road for home. Looking out my window at the lush greenery of the countryside that had so enamored me only days before, I couldn’t help but think now that it only acted as a shroud, a living, flowering veil that hid the beast lurking within. 

Back at home in the sardine can of suburbia, any moment absent of conscious thought was overcome with visions of the beast. If I had been any older, it would have been an easy write off, *“its just a nightmare,” “you’re crazy,” “go see a psychologist;”* but I wasn’t. I was an 8 year old little girl who read mythology encyclopedias and fairy tale compendiums like I was going for a PhD. I actively side stepped mushroom rings for fear of being kidnapped by the fae. A small piece of every Little Debbie cake I got was left near the crawl space door in case we had hobgoblins or brownies living under our house (which at the time, I seriously suspected we did).

My parents, the logic-bound adults could chock it all up to a subconscious presentation of a fear response, but I didn’t want to lie to myself.

I knew what I saw. 

As harrowing as it was, I kept mulling it over in my mind. Turning it over, rotating it at different angles, all in hopes of better understanding what it really was- the devil outside my bedroom window. If I was acting spacey, my friends at school didn’t say anything, at least not to my face. In the hallway, at lunch, at P.E. It possessed my every thought. 

The list of things I didn’t know about it was infinite, so I started with what I did know about it. 

It was large. Tall. I tried to think of it in comparison to the pines, and in doing so I stumbled upon a memory. It was a year before Nanny died, I was small, but not small enough to forget. It was the last time she was able to walk the pine rows with me. Her hair was as white as her sweet little farmhouse, and her bones burled and bent with age. Her voice was as gentle as the rustle in the pine needles. She said that because the pines were all planted so close together, the lowest of the branches wouldn’t get enough sunlight. As a result, they would drop off while the higher branches would reach upwards to take in more sunlight. I remember her smiling, as if that fact meant something to her.

She said that Papa had measured, and most of the branches in the pine rows were 5-7 feet from the ground. 

With that information at my disposal. I did some guesswork, but my safe guess was that it had been at least 4 feet, or probably more like 5 feet tall, on all fours.

It’s torso and appendages were lean. Not stocky, like a bear’s. Bears weren’t built that way. Why was I still thinking about bears? It definitely wasn’t a bear. What features I did see resembled a wolf, but wolves weren’t that large, that hairless, or that lanky. Neither were bears. My head began to throb. Whatever small annoying part of my brain *had* started developing was trying desperately to compare it to what I knew to be real. Thankfully the rest of my mind was fantastical and thought mermaids existed, so instead of having a psychological breakdown like an adult, I came to grips with the fact that this beast was a wolf-like and in all likelihood a werewolf. But I needed to do some research.  

That day after school, I asked Mom to take me to the library, a request she was used to. On the car ride there, she asked me what kind of book I was going to look for. So I explained my werewolf theory to her. A decision I immediately regretted when I saw the pity and concern within her eyes in the rear view mirror. 

“Honey, I know we’ve talked about all of this with the fairies and the mermaids and the unicorns, but werewolves aren’t real honey. I love that you have such a vivid imagination, but you’ve got to be realistic. I mean, sure, it might have been that bear or wolf out in the woods, but it was probably just a nightmare-“

“It couldn’t be a nightmare, I was at the window, and I know what I saw! It wasn’t normal looking- It didn’t look like a bear or a wolf, it was something else. I’m 100% sure that I saw what I saw! Mom, I swear- I swear I’m not lying.”

I saw the pained deliberation in her eyes. Outside of my fascination and proclivity for fairy stories I was pretty practical for my age. I listened to Mom and Dad when they told me things, I was forthcoming and honest if I did something I wasn’t supposed to. I wouldn’t blatantly lie to my Mom, and she knew that.

“Well, then, baby… if you really did see what you think you saw then- well, then it must have been a nightmare. And you’ve slept walked before! You know you were probably just sleep walking, had a nightmare, and woke at the window.”

My brow furrowed, taking what my mom said into consideration but not able to convince myself. I stared out the window in deep thought until we pulled up to the library.

Once we arrived, I didn’t have to worry about trying to give my Mom the slip. My love of books and stories came from her, and she made a B-line for the mystery section. Despite her dismissal of my werewolf theory, she loved spooky stories. 

  After collecting a few books from the sections labeled “folklore” and “nature science,” I found an empty table and started to read. I skimmed through a couple of books on mythology and American folklore and the like, none of its pages revealing any groundbreaking revelations. Silver bullets, transformation under the light of the moon, all the usual factoids. What was highly informative, however, was the expository book on wolves. 

How fast they were, how much power and stamina they possessed, how strong their bite was, how sharp their eyes were, how keen their sense of smell was; all the things that made them great hunters. I kept in mind that this was all a baseline for this creature. At the *very least* it did all these things. The thought overcame me with dread. I didn’t exactly calculate the metrics, but I knew that this monster likely doubled if not tripled anything a wolf could do. 

Knowing that time was running out before Mom came to fetch me, I ran over to the children’s section and grabbed a Junie B. Jones book I hadn’t read yet, as well as the newest Goosebumps book.

When I approached Mom, I tried to hide my wolf book under my selection of age appropriate literature, but Lori didn’t miss a thing.

“Study of the American Wolf, huh?”

I tried to brush past her comment and critical side eye,

“I thought you said I needed to be more realistic. Wolves are real, aren’t they?”

She sighed, rolling her eyes, handing it and my other books over to the librarian for check out. 

That evening at home, we had finished dinner and cleared the dining room table to play Jenga. The phone rang, and Dad stepped out of the room and into the kitchen to take it. Dad answered in a hushed tone, keeping his voice down. Unfortunately for Dad, he wasn’t a great whisperer. 

“Hey Dan… find any-?…How many…?” 

Silence. For a long while, silence. Mom and I locked eyes.

“God… Yeah, I see. Thank the boys for me… I’ll pay em for all their help… we both know that’s a lot of work. So sorry they had to… yeah… well… my God… I don’t know either, man… Yeah… Yeah… Thanks again Dan.”

Dad returned, doing his best to hide the weary look on his face. He glanced over at my Mom, and then at me, giving me a smile. I smiled back timidly. 

I looked back and forth between Mom and Dad, as she gave him a look that said, *‘You know she heard all that, right?’*

Dad hummed, pursing his lips in a wry way. I couldn’t help but laugh at him. But the quiet that followed it sobered the moment.

""Amy,” My Dad paused as he weighed his words. “Your old man… is an awful whisperer.”

“Yeah, you kind of are.” I snickered.

“I know you’re a smart girl, even if you didn’t just hear me on the phone, I know that you know that some scary stuff is going on right now.”

I nodded. Dad sat back down at the table, folding his hands as he spoke.

“But I want you to know that while we’re at the farm, you aren’t in any danger as long as you listen to what your mother and I say. Follow the rules, stay in the yard, and don’t go into the pine rows. I don’t want this to cause you too much distress, because none of this is going to last forever. 

Mr Voss, myself and some other people in the community are getting evidence together, and filling paperwork out- which is stupid- but we are doing it to see if we can get the game warden or someone from DNR involved. Whoever ends up helping us, they will know what to do. Its their job, that my taxes pay for by the way, and the fact that they haven’t sent someone out already is-“

Mom kicked Dad under the table. Dad cleared his throat. 

“The point is, whatever this thing is, a bear, a wolf, its just wandered too far out of its habitat. Whenever someone from the state *does* get out there, they’ll either capture it or kill it or do whatever they have to to keep people safe, to keep us safe.” 

I nodded again with a small smile. I thought it was sweet that Mom and Dad were trying to keep my spirits up, especially when I could tell all of this weighed on them so heavily. 

I tried to lighten the mood a little bit, the way any 8 year old girl would, by being a little snarky.

“So, what will we do if the game warden looks at everything and says its a werewolf?” I said. 

To me it was only kind of a joke, but to Mom and Dad it was ridiculous, and that was all that mattered. Dad smirked.

“Ah yes, your mother told me all about your werewolf theory.”

“Well, what if it is?” I crossed my arms, making a face that wrinkled my nose.

Dad put on a gravely serious look, laying it on thick. 

“If it is, I’ll just have to melt down your mother’s silver dinnerware set into bullets.”

“Oh no you won’t! That set is an heirloom!” 

Dad dramatically lifted his hands, dropping them back down on the table in defeat.

“Well then, I guess your mother is just going to let us all die,”

Mom and I cracked up. Dad attempted to remain dry but the corners of his mouth crept up into a smile. 

“We’ll just have to try and stab the thing with silver butter knives. That’ll show ‘em.”

We cut-up for the rest of the evening, our hearts full of mirth as we turned in for the night. None of us spoke about it again for the rest of the week. But it festered in our minds, leaked into every unoccupied moment. I could see the apprehension buried in their eyes when they were lost in thought, driving, cooking dinner, staring out the window. I lied awake in bed every night, counting down the days until Friday, when we returned to the farm.

Hey everyone! I’ve been experimenting with a mix of French press and V60. I brew my coffee in the French press first, then pour it through a V60 paper filter. Surprisingly, I really like the result! It gives me that rich flavor from the press but with a super clean and smooth finish thanks to the filter. No sludge at the bottom, and the cup feels lighter and more balanced.
 if anyone else does this or has tried something similar. Would love to hear how it worked out for you.

I was right next to her and reacted immediately, plugged the pc out, removed the psu cables and the cmos battery. We cleaned it with isopropyl alchool, let it sit for a day, and turned the pc on, everything worked great, i stress tested the components, no errors. I changed the gpu after a week to a 9070 xt( that gpu was just until i got this), and right on the day i changed it i noticed some brightness flickering on my monitor contiuing for a bit after restarting, i had some problems with the browser aswell. It would lag like crazy if i had a game open and tried using it. These things didn't happen before the spill. Last night i installed pubg, steam told me to install network frame 3.5, i did, i opened pubg and BSOD. I restarted the pc, again BSOD. First time i don't remember the error, but the second time and everytime i try to open pubg i get a BSOD and something like ""Attempted write to readonly memory"".

I hope you are all well.
I am 22, an introverted person who is genuinely trying to build a meaningful social circle instead of isolating myself forever with books, hikes, and coffees in silence. 😅
I went out recently and realised loud clubs, shouting over music, and chaotic crowds are simply not my environment.
No disrespect — many people enjoy that — but I prefer places with a bit more soul and softness.
I’m looking for places where the energy is:
Calm and respectful
Good conversations over noise
Classy, warm atmosphere
Live jazz / acoustic music
Soft lighting, not strobe explosions
People who enjoy humour with depth (dry / witty / subtle)
Those who speak with intention, not volume
I genuinely enjoy speaking to older individuals — the humour, wisdom, and grace are refreshing.
If Ms. or Mr. Life Experience starts telling a story, I will happily sit and listen. 😊
I guess I prefer an “old-soul” environment over modern chaos.
I don’t go out to drink recklessly; sometimes I enjoy a non-alcoholic drink and observe life quietly.
I would love to meet calm, polite, emotionally mature people — whether to make friends or simply enjoy good company.
At the moment, finding such places feels as rare as pulling a first-edition Charizard 😄, but I believe those environments still exist.
So I kindly ask:
May I please get recommendations for bars, lounges, jazz spots, or community spaces in Brisbane or Sunshine Coast that attract more mature, well-mannered, grounded people?
Thank you in advance for your suggestions.
Wishing everyone a peaceful evening ahead.and sorry if i offend anyone.🙏",18,1761920563.0,brisbane,5,0.88,False

I had a great shave this morning! I tried Barrister and Mann’s Leviathan soap and ASL for the first time. I had a moment of weakness this month. I told my self not to buy any more soaps but I couldn’t help myself, since this is considered so good and a limited release that came back in stock. 

I used my Rocca to wrap up Rocctober, and chose a Personna Diamond Glide blade and got great results. I hardly noticed any irritation with the alum block today. I did manage to get a tiny weeper on my neck, but the alum block stopped the bleeding. No need for a styptic pencil. 

I splashed on Thayer’s, the Leviathan ASL, and finally Zingeri Man’s unscented after shave serum. I really like this scent. This might be one for my wife to get use to, she finds it a bit too intense. 

I thought this was a fitting soap for Halloween considering the description of the soap on the Barrister and Mann website:

“Leviathan. The Biblical Serpent who will consume the world come the End of Days. Legend has it that he lives beneath the seas, awaiting his chance to devour all of Creation. Some sailors still speak his name in hushed tones and cross themselves to ward off his ancient, ravenous hunger.

In perfume, there is nothing more darkly ancient than leather. We discovered the formula for an archaic, forgotten Russian leather accord and blended it with notes of sandalwood, coffee, cedar, and musk to create a dark, feral scent well-suited to its namesake. Elemental and at times slightly unsettling, Leviathan is a scent to accompany you to the end of the world.”


Happy Halloween!

1okvtm3,https://www.reddit.com/r/uvb76/comments/1okvtm3/searching_for_purpose_and_ultimate_truth_of_life/,searching for purpose and ultimate truth of life ? here is Practical explanation,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",0,1761920244.0,uvb76,0,0.17,False
