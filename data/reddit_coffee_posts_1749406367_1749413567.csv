My son is a student at UCSD and has been trying to find a job for a while now. He doesn't have an extensive work history, as we always allowed him to focus on school. He has done a good deal of house sitting and pet sitting and did an internship at a vet clinic in high school.

Now he is trying to live off campus with roommates and cannot seem to find an entry level job for the life of him. He finally found something at a new coffee shack and then the owner decided she wasn't ready to hire staff after all and he was let go before he even started. He's a hard worker and a good student. 

Anyway, he needs to be able to make rent on July 1 and is desperate for any LEGAL pathways. He does not have a car, so he needs to be able to take public transportation. I thought I would turn to other locals for ideas.

He's looking for summer work and something to continue during the school year. He's definitely willing to work more than one job. Any leads or ideas are appreciated.",1,1749413362.0,sandiego,0,1.0,False

 today was her 3rd day being trained on drinks. i gave her a quick rundown of everything to do in the morning plus showed her where to find the recipe/steps for each drink then told her if she had any questions at all to just ask me. it was early so we weren't busy yet, i was making sure everything was stocked up, we get an online order for a cold brew, i look over and she's steaming the half n half.

it continued like that all day. putting ice before the espresso and milk, using a hot cup for a cold drink, not putting the right amount of shots, forgetting the flavoring. just absolutely helpless and basically refusing any offer for help. i get making mistakes when you're new because i've done the same thing. everyone has, but hot milk for a cold drink? just no semblance of common sense? really? it's like babysitting but worse.

i didn't yell at her but around noon i told my manager i was going crazy and asked to just go do dishes the rest of the day.

Here are 6 Holistic Strategies That Actually Work,"Depression feels overwhelming, but there are real, evidence-based ways to manage it. As a licensed mental health professional, I wanted to share some holistic approaches that can make a genuine difference:

**üéØ Behavioral Activation** \- Start small with activities you used to enjoy. Even a 15-minute walk or coffee with a friend can kickstart those feel-good brain chemicals.

**ü•ó Nutrition Matters** \- Low vitamin D, B12, and magnesium can worsen depression. Focus on whole foods, fruits, and vegetables instead of processed options.

**üí™ Move Your Body** \- Moderate aerobic exercise (even brisk walking 3-5x/week) is as effective as some medications for mild to moderate depression.

**üò¥ Sleep Hygiene** \- Depression disrupts sleep, which worsens symptoms. Create a consistent bedtime routine and limit screens before bed.

**üßò Mindfulness Practice** \- Yoga, meditation, or even gratitude journaling can help you observe difficult thoughts without getting trapped by them.

**üíÜ Self-Care Routine** \- Not bubble baths (though those are nice too), but genuine wellness activities that restore your energy.

Depression is treatable, and you don't have to face it alone. If you're struggling, please reach out to a mental health professional.

1l6lie8,https://www.reddit.com/r/floxies/comments/1l6lie8/floxed_mid_april/,Floxed mid April,"Hello everyone, I (28 M) was diagnosed with epididymitis with a hydrocele on April 17 and prescribed Levofloxacin 500mg and stopped after taking 7 doses (April 24th) due to tendon pain and a burning tingling pins-and-needles feeling in my legs below the knee. They said the infection was likely caused by enteric organisms though my UA(s) came back clean with only elevated ketones, protein and specific gravity. I also went to the ER a few days later to rule out a torsion and hernia due to the intense pain and was then given an injection of ketorolac 30mg/ml, 1 ml inj and prescribed ibuprofen 800mg followed by a Doppler ultrasound and a CT scan without contrast of my groin. The doctor that originally prescribed the levo told me to call her if I experience any tendon pain, so that's exactly what I did and received a 7 day dosage of doxycycline instead. The doxy went by without a hitch, but I'm still suffering from some slight blurry vision, a vertigo or bobbing sensation, a helmet-like head pressure on top of my head that remains painless most of the time and a buzzing or vibrating sensation I feel inside my head on a few occasions. I do get some burning and coldness from time to time, but they're much less frequent now and localized to my ankles so I'm not that concerned. I'm just a bit concerned about how long this could potentially last, it's been 6 weeks since my last dose.

Currently, I have a painless pressure feeling on my scalp, minor vertigo, and slight blurred vision with focus issues, though all of these have improved some with time. The vertigo isn't the spinning type, instead it involves up or down elevator like motion or bobbing, a floatiness if you will. Leaning forward can trigger it and yawning can reset it at times. It's similar to the sensation felt when you spin around just before everything calms down. It also reminds me of being on a boat. Speaking of which, spinning around in circles makes me dizzy as it's suppose to. I did notice that resting my legs and reducing the tendon inflammation seems to reduce this floaty feeling as does fixing my vision on an object while walking. Moving in a vehicle also improves the feeling. My ears will often feel ever so slightly full and will become irritated with a twitchy feeling deep inside them. The head pressure is localized to my scalp region and touching it can sometimes cause it to get irritated and twitchy. Sometimes I feel the pressure more intensely on the top of my head, behind my nose and the roof of my mouth. The pressure improved if I lied down and worsened if I lean forward. This pressure has greatly improved after I laid down most of the day sometime mid-May, though I still feel pressure when leaning forward. It is worth noting that I had not had a stuffy or runny nose in all that time. I have tight muscles in the front of my neck that come and go, likely due to stress. For a while I had a focusing lag in my vision where changing from near to far viewing caused a noticeable delay. It feels like it has improved though the visual clarity is still lacking. I've also noticed when viewing through each eye individually they wobble more rather than steadying my vision, although filming myself with my phone the effect wasn't noticeable externally. I will also often mistake my hear beat and breathing for movement or a bobbing motion now when I didn't use to. I also experience a strange vibrating in my head and throughout my body at times. Sometimes I feel like my heart is fluttering only for a check of my pulse at the wrist to feel normal, making me believe it's those vibrations. I also have some muscle lag/ weakness feeling, It's not real weakness though. My limbs feel floppy and imprecise presumable as a result of tendon swelling. The effect fluctuates in strength depending on how much I exert the muscles. I had insomnia that resolved quickly after stopping, though my sleep wasn't great to begin with due to school and I still feel I haven't fully recovered now. I also often get nauseous, which I think might me more so a side effect of the vertigo-motion weirdness and vision issues (especially with my glasses on) than a direct symptom itself. I did eventually go for another walk in mid-May for the head pressure and they prescribed me flonase and though it was my Eustachian tubes, though admitted it could also be CNS side effect that could ""take several weeks"" to resolve. She inspected my nose and ears with a otoscope but didn't really find anything. She advised me to take CoQ10 for the tendon inflammation and I bought Goli's naturals beets cardio gummies (contains 100 mg coq10 +12 mcg b12, take 2 daily). I also got a referral to a nutritionist to help reduce inflammation and speed up healing.

Some back ground medical info: as of May 12 I am 69.25 inches (5ft-9.25) tall and weighed 193.4 lbs, my bp was 124/80 and respiratory rate was 20/minute, pulse 66, oximetry 97%, but during the original April 15 visit I was 200lbs. I have ADD & autism. I'm a community college student that lives in the California Central Valley (hence my user name) and haven't had a great diet for a while now and I'll admit my posture isn't always that great either. I'm poor and on Medi-Cal but I do have access to free Teladoc. I am not very active other than strolls through town or around campus (the former I have not done since epididymitis ). I should specify, I eat lots of protein, though most of it is processed cheap stuff. I also eat a lot of probiotics, especially Kefir and greek yogurt, most of which contains fruit. I also have the occasional fried egg for breakfast or some oatmeal with bananas and other fruits. I do like to eat sushi, which sometimes contains cucumber and avocado. I have preexisting myopia and astigmatism in my right eye that add a slight double vision ghosting effect. It also adds some minor binocular vision alignment issues and my right eye in general is blurrier. Sometimes my left eye completely takes over, especially when reading or other up close tasks. While I have a normal eye pressure, I do have an unusual C/D ratio but it does not appear to change after monitoring from my doctor, though my grandmother has glaucoma in one eye and a cataract. I also have preexisting visual snow and eye floaters. My medical documents also note slightly thicker than average central corneal thickness. My prescriptions are outdated, though I have some updated ones from Lens Crafters that I haven't gotten made yet. I have 2 pairs of my old prescription, a high quality one with an AR coat and transition lenses and a cheap Medi-Cal pair I got free with no extra features. I avoided getting my allergy shot (which were started in January) while I was on antibiotics to prevent overloaded my immune system. As a result, I got a shot the beginning of the week I had epididymitis and did not get my next shot until May 12. I had 45 days to get my next shot else I risk having to repeat them. They chose to only take me down one dosage as a result of this. I have only missed one injection since then. I use to take Zyrtec prior to shots and am now taking AllerClear/Loratadine with Flonase. I wear braces which I'm almost done with. I have had sleeping issues in the past, which my school work likely contributed to. I often felt burned out and low energy. For a while I used coffee as a crutch until it caused stomach issues and I discontinued it last year. I had a sleep study lined up that the insurance approved just at the end of March, but I never scheduled due to this chaos. My mattress also sucks. I have also had difficulty urinating in the past, often having to bear down to pee. I suspect this was the cause of the epididymitis as I had pain in my groin around the spermatic tubes in prior month before all this went down. I am also not sexually active. It is probably also worth mentioning that my right ear has always been ever so slightly full feeling since I was a kid and both my Eustachian tube frequently pop when swallowing, with the right being more often and noisier. I also frequently have my left ear plug slightly after showering and not unplugging until a day or two later. I also have preexisting tinnitus which occasionally changes intensity/volume and pitch and is slightly worse in my right ear. I also had a rare interaction with Prilosec which caused insomnia several years ago. I was on Lexapro for five years from 2015 to early 2020. My brother has marfan's syndrome and has had heart palpitations and my sisters have hypermobility disorders, with one of them having tremors. High blood pressure also runs in our family and most of us have flat feet. My grandfather had a pacemaker. My dad had sleep apnea and asthma. My dad also had prostate cancer at one point. My mom has scoliosis. I think I have pectus excavatum as my chest is somewhat concave. Not sure if it matters much but if you want a genetic profile I'm of Scottish, Irish, German, Norwegian and Hispanic ancestry.

I was studying to major in CS or CE and hoping to transfer to a UC, full IGETC and all, and had a really high GPA (3.7+), was part of the college honors society, MESA and even got into a semi-prestigious STEM scholarship as well as a few past scholarships. All of that seems to have unraveled as I had to medically withdrawal from all my spring semester classes due to the debilitating side effects. I've been using ChatGPT 4o to track my symptoms and get a rough diagnosis, through I'm aware that's probably a really dumb idea. I'm not really sure what I'm going to do. I'm not even sure if I'm just venting or want advice to be honest. Sorry if this is a long post or a complete mess, I don't usually use reddit beyond specific issues.

1l6libp,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1l6libp/the_fall_of_yorut/,The Fall of Yorut,"When I was a kid, my mother told me stories every night. As I lay snug and warm, she would regale me with tales of spirits who wander the forests of Bar Island. There were small ones which she called ""Fork Flyers"", and larger ones known as the ""Sledgestones"", but the biggest of them all was Yorut. He was a massive turtle with a head and face like that of a snail. Seven large horns formed a mane around his neck, preventing him from ever withdrawing into his shell. My mother would tell me that this is what led him to become the protector of the other spirits. Because Yorut could never withdraw, his only option when threatened was to fight to the end. She would weave fantastical tales of the twenty foot tall beast batting away bulldozers, and leering at corporate lawyers in a threatening manner.  I had figured out by the age of 12 that most of my mother's stories were just that, stories. She had spent her college years among the environmentalists, and that was very much reflected in the tall tales she created. I guess I had inherited a bit of that drive from her, as I elected to join the Forestry Service. It was during my career there that I learned that Yorut was very real.


Tuesday, February 9th, 1994 


It started as a day like any other, and quickly took a turn for the bizarre. I stopped in at Henry's coffee shop as I did every morning. Henry and I exchanged our usual pleasantries and he set right to work preparing my drink. By the time he turned back around to hand it to me there had been a dramatic shift in demeanor. Henry had always been amicable, even friendly, but this was different. His eyes were as wide as dinner plates. His usually charming smile was just a bit more rigid than usual. It looked as if making my coffee had electrified Henry with happiness. 


""Uh, hey man are you okay?"" I asked

""Oh you betcha, I just feel so good all of a sudden it's impossible not to smile."" Henry replied, beginning to rub his own face as if his skin were velvet. 

""Well let's hope you put some of that sunshine into my drink"" I laughed and asked Henry how much I owed him. 

""It's on the house!"" Henry shouted, before adding ""IN FACT, FREE COFFEE FOR EVERYONE"" 


Henry's grand showing of goodwill had brought light into the hearts of everybody there. It's amazing sometimes how something so small can make people so happy. I was even more amazed to see the ripple effect it had caused. As I drove out of the town on my way to work, I passed John's used car lot where he was putting up crudely made cardboard signs which read ""Zero money down? Zero money EVER!"" People were filing out of the local Walmart with cart after cart full of unpurchased goods. Everybody involved, be they customer or staff, was grinning from ear to ear. I heard people on the streets shouting greetings to one another. I watched the town mayor, Jonah Newport, climb into a car with a perfect stranger just because he had asked. For all intents and purposes it appeared to be a new revolution of love and brotherhood unfolding before my eyes. The reality of the situation was much more... complex. 


After the chaotic charity and fraternity of the morning I was excited to get out into the forest and enjoy the stillness of nature. I spent most of the day walking the trails checking for litter and signs of wildlife. By the time I had nearly finished my rounds the sun had begun to sink in the western sky. If it weren't for the encroaching darkness of the evening I may never have seen the streaks of glowing purple light darting around the trees. As I approached the area where I had seen them, I began to hear noises. Wet, popping thumps followed by small screeches. The sound of rock striking against rock, each time accompanied by a breathy ""kuh"". Another twenty feet and I could see the purple streaks a little bit better. Leathery wings held their slight frames aloft, bodies no more than two inches across at their widest, with long drifting tails which ended in a two-pronged pitchfork. My eyes widened as the implications of what I was seeing began to dawn on me. ""Flying Forks"" I thought ""no, wait. It was 'Fork Flyers'."" 


Creatures straight from my bedtime stories now danced before me, each taking its place in a great ring which made its orbit around some unseen object. I was rooted in place as I watched their silent parade. I noticed after a time that not all of the Fork Flyers were glowing with that unearthly shade of purple. The ones who had lost their shine peeled off from the rest and flew inward. In the stories my mother had told me, Fork Flyers were never mean, unless they were hungry. That little tidbit is what drove me to make the unfathomably stupid decision to try and slip past the ring. I waited, taking care to identify a portion of the ring where the Flyers glowed brightest. I surmised that the brightest of them might have been the most satiated, so I counted the seconds it took for my group to come around, and when it did I ran like hell. 


Diving under the ring of Flyers I scrambled to my feet and ran for cover as fast as I could. The foolishness of my decision loomed over me, growing in size with each passing second, until I had made it far enough to feel safe hiding once more. I moved between the trees, ears alert for any sign of hungry Forks flying my way. When I finally saw him I was stunned. It was Yorut. He was everything the stories said he was. Easily 40 feet from head to tail. His seven horns protruded high into the sky. Each leg a mighty trunk like that of a Redwood. He was magnificent. He was awe-inspiring, and he was dead. The Fork Flyers covered every inch of exposed flesh. Hundreds upon hundreds of pitchforks stabbing into Yorut's increasingly mangled body. More stood in wait, perched along each of the seven horns which crowned his head. As they fed, the tails of the flyers began pulsing with a faint light which suffused their bodies. My earlier suspicions were confirmed when a flyer, the most luminous of his cohort, flew away to rejoin the great ring. 


I could see groups of blue humanoid figures sitting in tightly knit circles. Each one had a large, rough patch on their forehead. They took turns bashing these patches against Yorut's shell, attempting to break it open. When their efforts were successful the peaceful, cooperative circles turned into violent feeding frenzies. Elbows flew with wild abandon as each of the Sledgestones fought to rip away chunks of the Grand turtle's flesh. Unlike the Fork Flyers, the Sledgestones did not seem to ever reach satiety. 


I was so engrossed in watching the beasts of my imagination devouring the hero of all my favorite stories that I had failed to hear the sound of leathery wings slipping through the night air. The Fork Flyer must have been making its way to Yorut when it spotted me and decided I might be easy prey. As it approached me the Flyer's tail stretched impossibly far, impossibly fast. The twin prongs of its tail planted themselves on both sides of my neck, narrowly missing a fatal blow. The prongs atop its head were the next to come. Another miss, with the creature's vicious face held mere inches away from me by its own tools. Teeth lined its oval mouth, gnashing and screeching in its struggle to reach me. I would love to say I took action.  That I dislodged the creature's tail to make my escape, but I didn't. I didn't even scream. I just stared at the Flyer as it snapped and screeched at me, knowing I was trapped. 


A streak of blue obliterated the winged devil before colliding with a tree in its path. The Flyer had been destroyed, but the tail remained lodged in the tree holding me still. Its severed head continued to gnaw uselessly at the distance between us. A Sledgestone, late to the party, had arrived just in time to save my life. It got up, shaking the concussion out of its head, and locked its eyes on mine. The blue giant was easily 9 feet tall. It was covered in hair, like the fur of an animal, and it was beginning its charge. I moved as much as I could manage, only just avoiding my right leg being turned to paste. The vibrations from the impact loosened the Flyer's abandoned extremities. I pushed with all the strength of desperation and I was made free, but not yet safe. The Sledgestone was recovering quickly. I ran like hell through the forest, all the while made aware of my pursuer by the thunderous slam of its skull against tree after tree. I drove straight home and didn't come out of my bedroom for two days. 


Tuesday February 10th


I had thought that isolation would be good. That it would help me sort out my thoughts, but in reality I was only spinning in circles. I had a long list of questions to answer and I had gotten stumped by the very first: How was any of this real? These were supposed to be nothing more than legends that teach kids lessons. Like the legend of Yehankaru, a shapeshifter who would lurk in the shadows of prosperous civilizations, stealing away anyone who allowed it to lure them to a secluded area. Easily the most heavy-handed metaphor for ""stranger danger"" I had ever seen. 


Wednesday, February 11th


I made my way into town for a coffee and a bit of normalcy. As he made my drink for me, I noticed that Henry's lunatic grin now needed to be frequently reapplied. Whatever ecstasy had overcome the town seemed to be fading. The signs at John's now half-empty car lot had been changed to say ""TWO DOLLARS DOWN?! Get outta town!"" The employees of the depleted Walmart shrugged at customers perusing barren shelves. The same vehicle that had picked up the mayor was now offering Harvey Potler a steak dinner if he got in the car. Harvey accepted the offer in the end. On the surface it was all still friendly, but the cracks were beginning to show. 


I arrived at the Ranger's station to find my superior, Terrence Howard (not that one), with his head in his hands. People had been going missing along trails in record numbers, and not just near our station. All across the island, men and women were failing to return from things as mundane as trips to the grocery store. I tried to tell him what I had seen in the woods, but I couldn't find the words. In the end, I only irritated him further with my stammering.


""Damn it, Brantley, either spit it out or get the hell out of my office. I don't have time to play charades when half the fucking town is missing."" He glared at me as he spat out the words. I couldn't find a way to explain without landing myself in a straitjacket. I thought maybe it would be easier if I showed him. 

""Will you come with me?"" I asked timidly, ""I can't find the words."" 

Terrence Howard's expression softened. Terrence was a good man, albeit a good man under an extreme amount of stress. He sighed. ""Fine,"" He said ""but we need to be back before noon."" 


We stared at the churning festival of consumption for what felt like days. The Flyers continued their skewering of the great beast. Sledgestones crowded in larger groups as the available real estate on Yorut's back dwindled. New species of creature had turned up to the feast. A face set in a flat area about the size of a beach ball with five appendages reaching toward the sky. They resembled human hands sprouting from the ground. Using their ""fingers"" to climb, they made their way to one of the Sledgestones' abandoned portholes before setting their rat-like faces down in the entryway. Wolves the size of moose stalked around the corpse, slipping in to tear away chunks of destroyed flesh before retreating to their pack. Their jet black fur danced with greens and blues as they ran. It was one forty five when Terrence turned to me and asked the question that had been burning in my mind since I found Yorut. 


 ""What the fuck?"" 

""...Yeah..."" was all I could offer. 

""Why didn't you say anything when you found it?"" Terrence asked. 

""Respectfully, sir, I had no idea how to explain this."" I replied. 

""That's...fair..."" he said. ""What the hell are we supposed to do about this, Brantley?"" 


I was relieved beyond measure to hear that. ""We."" If I were going to be grappling with the impossible, at least I wouldn't be doing it alone. Easy come easy go, I guess. 


We were halfway back to the station, walking together in stunned silence, when we first saw them. Dark shadows in the depths of the forest. Terrence must have noticed them first. He spoke quietly. 

""Keep your eyes trained forward and do not slow down. I don't know what they'll do if they know that we're aware of them. It's just a quarter mile to the station now."" 


The small sign signifying the first set of guest restrooms verified his words. I did as I was told. Never letting my attention wander too close to the many lights of unblinking eyes. Through my peripherals I could see that not every figure was whole. Some only had a single glowing ember set deep into the skull. Others had tiny twin stars blazing in their ocular cavities. The figures were of different sizes. Some big, some small. Some thin, some more rotund. Their unified gaze followed us all the while. Quiet. Patient. Hunters waiting for a chance to strike. 


We reached the station after fifteen minutes which each felt like seven. The feeling of elation from safely completing our journey hit me like a truck. I felt that as long as we could reach the station, everything would be alright. It wasn't until we had shut the door behind us that I remembered what we were doing. Noting had changed. We had made no progress. We were only seeking a shelter from which to wonder about what the hell was happening. We were every bit as lost as when we had set out. We sat together in total silence for an hour or two. 

""My mother used to tell me about these things."" I said. ""In stories when I was a kid. I never thought any of it was real. Half of the time she would make Yorut, that's the dead guy, into a pseudo-Captain Planet figure."" I continued, ""the ones with points at each end are called Fork Flyers. She called the blue ones 'Sledgestones'. She never mentioned the wolves or the hands."" 

""Perhaps it's related to some old folklore. Your mother had to get these stories from somewhere, right?"" Terrence Howard posited. 

I had been thinking much the same. I was ready to look up information on the town's legends when Terrence told me there was no need. 

""I keep a book of old tales in my truck."" And his face fell as if he were ashamed to say, ""I...I use the stories to scare hikers sometimes."" 


I laughed at the admission, as Terrence walked outside to retrieve the book. The mistake was revealed to me immediately. Terrence had been gone for just under a minute when the silence of the night was suddenly broke by the sound of a hundred footfalls. In the middle of the cacophony I could hear a single voice crying out. 


""Waitwaitwait NO. Brantley! Help...help...help"" the voice of my only companion in this crisis faded meekly into the distance, drowned out by the whooping cries of his captors. 


Thursday, February 12th 


I filed a missing persons report. The clerk told me that Terrence would mark the 237th person to disappear. She informed me of this with an air that said ""don't get your hopes up"". I should have taken that bit of unspoken advice. 


The air in Henry's coffee shop seemed different today. He, along with his customers, had all adopted a slight scowl. The overall mood felt...melancholic. Henry grumbled at my coffee as he poured it, and gave it to me with his other hand outstretched. 


""What, no more free coffee?"" I asked, unserious. 

""PLEASE. Just stop. I'm not in the mood for this kind of crap today."" He bristled all over as I noticed the empty glass cases which usually held a variety of food items. ""The city says I didn't have the proper permits for giving away coffee. If you ask me, they've got it out for me."" 

""Oh geez, I'm sorry to hear that."" I replied. I meant it, Henry had always been kind. The town had come to view him as a staple. After all, what is the linchpin of society if not the local coffee shop? I put a five dollar bill in the tip jar and went on my way. 

John's signs had changed once again. This time, they read: ""I like money too, yknow!"" I could see John through the window to his office. He seemed to be hard at work crafting tomorrow's message. Elizabeth Stoltz, an older woman with a fiery temper, was in a one-sided shouting match with the vehicle which had been collecting townsfolk. 

""How dare you proposition me, sir? I am a lady. I will not be getting into a car full of strange me-"" her sentence cut off as a wiry arm reached out in a flash and dragged her into the vehicle through the window. I tried to catch the car's license plate number, but the letters appeared to be shifting constantly. If anybody else on the street had noticed, they didn't give any indication. I decided I would go and try to retrieve the book Terrence had mentioned. The journey was largely uneventful. Once or twice during the drive I caught sight of people hiding (poorly) behind trees. You know that thing kids do where they hide behind something that barely obscures your vision of them? It was like that. 


The book was not worth the uneventful drive. Aside from a passing mention of Yorut, I found absolutely nothing. No Fork Flyers, no Sledgestones, nada. If my mother were still with us I could ask her directly where her old stories came from. In that moment, I missed her more than usual. I sat back, drinking in the silence of the Ranger's station, thinking of the woman who had raised me. 


Bereft of answers. Still. I found myself curious about the state of Yorut. After what had happened to Terrence, I was taking no chances. I fired up the drone we use to scout for missing hikers and sent it on its way. 


Shards of shell littered the clearing. Every inch of ground not covered by the fragments lay soaked in a viscous purple fluid. The Fork Flyers had disappeared from the immediate area,  seemingly all moving to the great ring which still made its orbit around the corpse of Yorut. The Sledgestones were standing in a massive huddle, desperately beating back the titanic wolves which had appeared. The hands had grown additional appendages which slithered their way across the bloodied ground looking to grab up anything it found. One of the hands, which had used its newfound tentacle to snatch up a Sledgestone, was pierced from within by a coalition of crimson worms. Their slender bodies tapered into points that looked sharp enough to pierce Kevlar. I turned the drone around to bring it home, only for it to be chased down and knocked out of the sky by a curious Fork. 


It seemed to me that the feast was reaching its end. There wasn't enough of Yorut left to sustain the creatures, and they had begun to turn on one another. Perhaps this problem would solve itself. If I could just wait a few days, the corpse would be fully depleted and all this craziness might finally end. 

So of course, shit hit the fan the next day. 


Friday, February 13th 


Bedlam had come to town. Henry stood outside of his coffee shop yelling at passersby. 


""MY BUSINESS IS FAILING BECAUSE YOU GREEDY FUCKS DON'T PAY FOR YOUR COFFEE"" he raged, stopping himself for a moment to say hello to me, before launching further into his tirade. I stopped in at the police station to check for any sign of Terrence, and I found more than I had bargained for. Two hundred and fifty missing persons had all shown up to the station that morning, and among them were Harvey Potler, and Terrence. I was elated. 

""TERRENCE"" I shouted, causing him to stumble slightly in surprise. ""I'm so glad you're okay, what the hell happened?""


""Huh?"" Was his initial reply, hastily adding ""Oh, that. Yeah I got loose about an hour after they took me. Ran all night. Thank goodness I found a trail. I could have died out there, Brantley."" 


""Dude, I know!"" I finally took a good look at him. Terrence looked like shit. His clothes hung loosely off his body. Occasionally a rib would show through the shirt as he moved. He was emaciated, as if he had been starving for days when no more than 36 hours had passed. In fact, all of the returning vanished looked brutally thin. I brushed it off, making a mental note to get this man a cheeseburger ASAP. 


As we drove aimlessly through town, the relationship between Terrence and I was flipped on its head. Usually I'm the one making impractical suggestions to irritate Terrence. Today, apparently, it was his turn. 


""Maybe we should go scope out the corpse again"" he said. 


""I don't see much point in that."" I replied. The scene had remained, at its core, largely the same since I had discovered it. With the feast tapering off, I didn't know what information we could possibly glean from another look. Terrence, to his credit, dropped that particular suggestion. However, it was immediately followed up with another. 


""Well, there's all these old sewer tunnels. Maybe there's something to investigate down there."" He sounded desperate. I understood exactly how that felt. I just wanted an answer. I would have gone down into those sewers, had I seen anything at all to suggest they held clues for us. 


""The sewers? Are you feeling okay, man?"" I was worried about my friend/boss. He had been abducted by creatures of the forest. Who knows what that's like, other than him? I could forgive him for being in a bit of a fog. 


""Yeah, I'm totally fine I just think we should go somewhere that nobody else goes. If there was something to see where people go, then somebody would have seen it. We should be checking the areas where there are no other peo-"" his words were cut off by the shattering of the passenger side rear window. John stood at the edge of his empty lot, shotgun in hand. He had a look on his face of bewildered animalistic rage. He racked another shell and took aim once more. The pellets punched dozens of tiny holes in the passenger side door. They tore around Terrence's legs, some even leaving holes in his pants. Miraculously, he was unharmed. I sped away as fast as the vehicle would allow. 


Everywhere we went, there was chaos. Walmart was completely engulfed in flames. People shouted obscenities at one another. Fights to the death were breaking out over every minor disagreement. Terrence and I had been watching Jane Turnbull giving Gabe Trund a beatdown over ""the good cart"" at Aldi. Suddenly, Terrence stiffened before saying ""too late"" and sprinting away into the streets. I gave chase, but he was impossibly fast. I didn't catch up until we had made it to the town square. What I saw there made my next decision extremely simple. 


The formerly missing had converged on the area. They all stood around, slack jawed and staring at the clock tower in the center of town. A straggler, who I recognized to be  Jonah Newport, arrived on the scene and it was as if a switch had been flipped. Two hundred and sixty seven bodies simultaneously disrobed. Their heads sat atop bodies devoid of flesh. Held aloft and upright by nothing more than bones which had been brutally marred. Looking closely at Terrence, who was nearest to me, I could see the marks of gnawing teeth along every inch of exposed bone. The missing climbed over top of one another until they formed a massive human pyramid. Jonah Newport climbed to its apex and proceeded to dive  directly into the mouth of Lane Pommson. As Jonah made his way toward the ground, the rest of the pyramid followed suit. Those standing on the ground were flung high into the air. The pyramid stood inverted as Jonah slid into the dry earth with a squelch. The others did not follow Jonah on his subterranean journey. Instead their bodies smashed against the earth, their skeletons scattering in all directions, leaving only a pile of still animated heads surrounded by thousands upon thousands of bones. Each head was spewing a word salad the likes of which has never been seen. The cacophony of their pointless vocalizations was nearly as disturbing as what had led them there.


That was when I made the best decision I had made all week. I left. As my battle scarred Corolla rolled away from the town of Bar Harbor, I could just barely see a long line of purple streaks flying away from the clearing which had become Yorut's grave.",1,1749413162.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm writing here because for the past couple of years I‚Äôve been dealing with something that limits me quite a lot, especially during the day, and I can‚Äôt really figure out what‚Äôs causing it.

Basically, when I go out and walk (even just to grab a coffee or take a walk), I start sweating a lot from my back and stomach (especially when I stop). I‚Äôm not talking about light sweating: I literally feel my shirt getting soaked, like my back is a raging river. This happens even when it‚Äôs not that hot outside, though of course it gets worse in the summer. And it makes me feel very uncomfortable, because I‚Äôm afraid others will notice, or that I‚Äôll have visible sweat stains on my clothes.

Strangely, when I‚Äôve had a bit of alcohol, all of this completely goes away. I don‚Äôt sweat as much and I feel much more relaxed.

Sometimes I think it might be some form of anxiety or stress, maybe tied to some insecurity or obsessive thoughts. Maybe it‚Äôs a vicious cycle: I‚Äôm afraid of sweating ‚Üí I sweat ‚Üí I get nervous ‚Üí I sweat even more.

I‚Äôve never had any specific tests done for thyroid or circulation issues, although I do wonder if it could be related (honestly, I don‚Äôt even know where to go for those ‚Äî whether to start with my GP or go to a specialist).

Has anyone experienced something similar? Do you have any advice on how to deal with this or what kind of doctor I should talk to in order to start figuring it out?

1l6lhde,https://www.reddit.com/r/airbnb_hosts/comments/1l6lhde/husband_uses_wife_account_to_leave_negative/,Husband uses wife account to leave negative review - can I get it removed?,"I‚Äôve been going through the review policy and content policy this morning on Airbnb after receiving a negative review. I‚Äôm seeking advice on how I might get it removed. 

Backstory: A recent guest left a two star review based on really trivial and mostly untrue issues. Not only that but the wife who booked the place told me during their stay that they had a lovely time and never reported any issues. I always reach out to my guests the morning after check in to let them know they can be in touch if there are any issues. With this guest in particular I went above and beyond receiving packages for them before their stay so that they would be there for them when they came. 

I also offered to stock anything in the kitchen that they might need after said grumpy Husband sent me some rude messages about the inventory of our kitchen. We stock very basic necessities in the kitchen, pots pans, knives and utensils you might need to cook a meal, but he wanted to host a brunch For guests not on the reservation and seemed appalled that we don‚Äôt stock spices beyond salt and pepper (we also have EVOO, sugar, coffee, tea and honey plus snacks and water).

Anyway the husband uses his wife‚Äôs account to leave a 2-star and imo totally unfair review. 4 stars, fine, but I know for a fact many of the things that he complains about  are untrue (like our place smelled like smoke and that the place is dark due to bulbs being out). And he complains about the spices üòÇ 

My co-host told me that since the person whose name is on the review didn‚Äôt actually write it, that I can get it removed. He admitted this in the messages when I reached out after the review was posted, so I have that in writing.

Has anyone had luck removing a review like this? I‚Äôm fine just responding and moving on; at the same time we are still recovering from Hurricane Helene, lost A LOT of income, and our rates are much lower than usual. This review could really hurt us.

1l6lg42,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1l6lg42/manual_grinder_for_espresso_any_budget/,Manual grinder for espresso [any budget],"Tl;dr: my current pick is the Kinu M47 Classic, after considering it against the 1Zpresso K-Ultra, Comandante C40 and C60. 

*** 

Hi all, I recently got into espresso (after years of brewing with Aeropress, V60 and moka pot). I am using a Flair Pro 3, and I‚Äôve been loving the journey. 

My grinder for the past five years has been a Timemore Slim, I‚Äôve been very happy with it, but ‚Äî while it can grind for espresso ‚Äî there are two key aspects that i am starting to feel the need for: 

- more precise grind size adjustment, and 
- faster grinding. 

Additional considerations: 

- budget is not a concern, and 
- made in Europe is a plus. 

***

After eliminating the following runner ups, my current pick is the Kinu M47 Classic. I‚Äôm ready to press the ‚Äúbuy‚Äù button, but I‚Äôd be curious to hear your input: 

- 1Zpresso K-Ultra: I see it often recommended, but I don‚Äôt like the design as much as the other options. A bit of a superficial reason, I know. 

- Comandante C40: not enough of an upgrade from Timemore Slim as the burrs are similar sized (so grinding speed won‚Äôt improve much) and grind adjustment is not that precise without upgrading parts. 

- Comandante C60: end-game grinder vibes, almost unreasonable (in a fun way), quite expensive, but I‚Äôm ok with that ‚Äî and more precise than C40 ‚Äî, however it seems to be made not specifically for espresso and more for people who have to grind a lot, while I‚Äôm just having 1-2 coffees per day, most days. 

- Kinu M47 Classic: most precise grind adjustment, and burrs that are big enough to grind fast and smoothly. Seems to be designed with a focus on espresso. Premium and will last a lifetime. The perfect fit for me? 

Thanks for reading till the end.

So I need a reality check. I‚Äôm a woman in the U.S., an international student from Iraq. A few months ago, another Iraqi international student ‚Äî a guy ‚Äî emailed me saying people had told him I‚Äôm also from Iraq and that he‚Äôd like to meet up for coffee. I was polite and said I had COVID at the time and maybe once I got better. I never followed up.

Later, he found me on LinkedIn, connected with me, and messaged again about meeting. I replied with something like ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been really busy, I‚Äôll let you know when I‚Äôm free.‚Äù His response was friendly, saying ‚Äútotally understand, let me know.‚Äù Then a few weeks later, I got another message from him saying something like ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just keep reaching out if you ever want to meet up.‚Äù I already felt uneasy by then.

Fast forward to a couple nights ago ‚Äî I was walking outside and he approached me out of nowhere. He said ‚ÄúHey! I saw you yesterday, I‚Äôve been chasing you for 4 months!‚Äù I was clearly uncomfortable, but I stayed polite and said I‚Äôd been busy. He asked for my number, I said ‚Äúno, LinkedIn is enough.‚Äù Then he said ‚Äúyou were on LinkedIn yesterday,‚Äù which honestly creeped me out. Why is he watching my online activity?

What made me feel even more uneasy is this: he said he had seen me the day before, and then conveniently messaged me, and then showed up at the exact same spot the next day and called it ‚Äúwhat are the odds!‚Äù Like‚Ä¶ it doesn‚Äôt feel like coincidence. It feels like tracking.

Before I blocked him, I saw that he had sent two LinkedIn messages again. First one was like:

> ‚ÄúJust thought I‚Äôd check in one last time ‚Äî totally understand if things got busy or plans changed. I enjoyed our brief exchange and would still be glad to meet if you‚Äôre ever up for it. If not, no worries at all. Wishing you the best.‚Äù



And the next one right after seeing me in person:

> ‚ÄúIt was really nice running into you yesterday ‚Äî what are the odds! I enjoyed our chat and would still love to get together sometime soon. Let me know what works best for you.‚Äù



I never replied to either.

It might sound harmless at first glance, but combined with everything ‚Äî the way he kept reaching out across platforms, tracked my online activity, approached me randomly in person, and kept pushing after I gave polite non-responses ‚Äî I started feeling unsafe. I ended up blocking him and I‚Äôm considering sending a final email through the university email for the record and in case he keeps approaching me.

I was really struggling with my mental health and at a point where my medication costs were spiralling, my bank account dwindling, my meds were in short supply countrywide leading to huge levels of anxiety (and the spirally costs). My dad called one day, said he‚Äôs 20 mins down the road and offered to meet me for coffee. I said I couldn‚Äôt come as had to work. When he asked how I was, I said ‚ÄòI‚Äôm okay‚Äô at first - then admitted I‚Äôm doing pretty shit. I asked him for help towards my medical bills.

For the record, he is a banker with two homes. The two kids he raised with his current wife both have bought homes. I was forever told, growing up, that I couldn‚Äôt talk to my dad about periods, ask my dad to help me in my career. He never asked about school work or sat with me to do it. He paid the minimum child support and threatened my mum that he‚Äôd fight for full custody if she asked for more so she didn‚Äôt - the fund didn‚Äôt cover our transport to school. We had second hand furniture, struggled to get new clothes, didn‚Äôt go away unless my grandparents paid for it. He wouldn‚Äôt show up when he said he was going to come see my full sibling and I a lot. When I did see him, he would scope for dirt on my mum. She was a functioning alcoholic so there was a lot of dirt to scope, but he didn‚Äôt do anything to change our living situation - even when, as a child, I disclosed to him that my mum‚Äôs then husband was hitting us. As an adult, I was diagnosed with a genetic disease - growing up, whenever I was in pain from this disease, he would tell me that I was just overweight, unfit, lazy. I developed an eating disorder at 16 as a result. He is very appearance focused - has been nicest to me when I am at my skinniest, have a boyfriend he liked (who was actually very horrible to me). As a child he would get upset if he would see me and I would be dressed in anything other than my ‚ÄòSunday best‚Äô, such as a football kit - meanwhile my half brother would be allowed to wear the football kit. 

Meanwhile, he and my siblings had a very different lifestyle - multiple big holidays a year, new cars, a big house, etc. 

As an adult I hadn‚Äôt asked him for money outside of him asking me what I wanted for Christmas (the previous Christmas he had offered to buy me a bike rack for my van ‚Äúfor Christmas and birthday gift‚Äù - I had said, actually if you are willing to spend that kind of money I really could use it to go towards the cost of my meds - but it didn‚Äôt materialise then, either. 

This was the first time, age 31, that I‚Äôve asked a parent to help me financially.

His response was:

‚ÄúWell what happens if you don‚Äôt have your meds‚Äù (I can‚Äôt function and had even lost my job to this mental illness before I was diagnosed and put on the meds. He would‚Äôve known all this if he had actually listened to what I had been saying to him, the few times we had met since 2020).

‚ÄúWhat happened to your savings?‚Äù (‚Ä¶ I had ankle surgeries and had to pay three months of rent to recover in 2016, and 2018, then mental health costs relating to my ED in 2020, then lost my job in February 2023 ‚Ä¶ and medication that was supposed to be ¬£150 a month was creeping up to ¬£300 a month due to the shortage, plus ¬£250 psych fees. Again, he would‚Äôve known all this if he had actually been listening to me when we spoke.)

And ‚Äú‚Ä¶ maybe it can be your birthday present as I haven‚Äôt given you one this year‚Ä¶ ‚Äú. 

There was also mention of a potential loan, which sucked given that he knew I was struggling for money and had lots of money, had clearly given my half siblings thousands towards their deposits - and had my parents been a little more competent and aware when I was a child, this condition would‚Äôve been diagnosed and medicated free on the NHS. 

But this is a reoccurring theme - I used to call his work when I was a teenager to talk to him to find out he was on holiday. When I was 10, I was told he wouldn‚Äôt buy my the gift I had requested for Christmas as ‚ÄòI‚Äôd only break it‚Äô, yet that same gift was given to two of his other, younger children, who had a much worse track record with belongings (I‚Äôve actually only broken anything other than drinking glasses or mugs since being an adult - I was a clumsy kid but tended to hurt myself more than break things). He has money, but he hates sharing it. He has time but didn‚Äôt choose to spend it with me and my sibling. 

My birthday is March so it was very weird to me that he would be mentioning this in July, esp in connection to medical bills. It made me feel like he had deliberately not given me a gift that year, for some reason. He‚Äôs always been weird about gifts and money (complained in 2024 that he went to visit my sibling up North and my sibling didn‚Äôt buy his family wine for a BYOB restaurant ‚Ä¶ this man who withheld money from us as children ‚Ä¶ ). I hadn‚Äôt given his family Christmas gifts that year on account of not having had a job, but had taken him to the theatre for Father‚Äôs Day the year before when I had had some money - I had just assumed that the lack of a birthday gift was just some kind of weird non-agreement that we didn‚Äôt need to do gifts now, so hadn‚Äôt thought it would come back up ever. The call ended without any real agreement for lending or giving money, but gave me a really weird feeling. 

The same evening, my mental health was such a mess that I was even using mental health emergency phone lines. If life was going to continue to be so hard, why keep trying? I was genuinely wishing I could just die than have to deal with it all. 

Four days later he contacts me, and asks me to talk. I agreed and asked for a day to meet. That weird feeling worsened. If he was happy to help, he would‚Äôve asked me how much money I needed - whether that was by asking for proof of the medical costs that month, or by just asking me - but he hadn‚Äôt asked for that. 

A week passed and no response. Luckily my meds situation had been temporarily sorted and it didn‚Äôt seem so desperate to me. I was just a bit sad and embarrassed that I had asked my dad to help in a horrible moment in my life, and he hadn‚Äôt even driven an extra 20 mins to give me a hug that day. 

Finally, I get a text to meet the following Saturday, and asking whether I would mind if his wife came because ‚Äòhe is not good with emotional conversations‚Äô.

He knows I am not good with his wife. 

She has no empathy and has been incredibly ignorant and rude regarding my muscle disease and surgeries, mistaking her role as a receptionist in a private physiotherapist‚Äôs office as though that gave her any medical expertise whatsoever and definitely more medical expertise than my NHS Surgeon who also owns a private clinic and at the time, was a professor at multiple medical schools. As a result of comments she made when I was getting some surgeries to lengthen my Achilles tendons, I have only met her twice since 2016.

Worst of all, when I told my dad I was seeking treatment for my ED in 2021, he disclosed to me that he had bulimia (his teeth are brown so everyone knows something is up) and no one else knew this. He didn‚Äôt want to tell his wife (he convinced her that it was caused by chlorine from their pool ‚Ä¶). 

So the next two years when we would occasionally meet, he would treat me like a therapist, as I was the only person aware of his bulimia. When I told him about my diagnosis, he share that he thought he had the same thing, and even then acknowledged that the trauma caused by my unstable childhood couldn‚Äôt have helped the situation. I thought we had kind of reached a turning point then. I was wrong. He confided in me that him and his wife were going to couples‚Äô therapy but he quit after the therapist told him that he was selfish! (I tried, during these meetings, to explain my mental health troubles with him, but his questions on that call told me that he just hadn‚Äôt actually been listening.)

The audacity of this man, to claim he ‚Äòcan‚Äôt handle emotional conversations‚Äô, yet seemed to handle them fine when he wanted to treat me like a therapist, and expected me to explain my mental health issues to his wife when he hasn‚Äôt been honest with her in 30 years about his bulimia. 

I snapped. 

I knew that after more than a week of hearing nothing, having told him that I was struggling with my mental health, and that I was struggling with funding the bills relating to my medical care, this conversation was going to not end well for me. 

It seemed like ‚Äì at best ‚Äì he thought I should pitch my bad mental health to him and his wife - which would wholly affect my dignity and the small amount of self esteem that I had managed to rebuild by getting back into employment and since being on meds. Even if that did end up with a loan, the cost wouldn‚Äôt have been worth it. It wouldn‚Äôt have been worth that to have had an extra ¬£5k security in my pocket. He had taught me how little he actually cared. 


I told him (via text) I wasn‚Äôt surprised by his request but I was disappointed by it. 

That if he couldn‚Äôt be a parent for me without needing his wife there, I wasn‚Äôt interested in having the talk or the help. That I didn‚Äôt want to talk to him anytime soon as a result of his inaction in my time of need. 



I changed my number but due to iMessage being linked to my email, I did see some text messages from him a couple of months later on my laptop, asking me to meet for a coffee. 

I text back, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need coffee. What I needed back when we last spoke was a bit of support from a parent. You were only 20 mins down the road that day and didn‚Äôt bother to just come and see me and talk in person though you knew I was struggling.‚Äù

He replied, ‚ÄúI do want to help but understanding help requires a conversation.‚Äù

My final contact to him was, ‚Äúand there‚Äôs the problem - I thought we had been having conversations every time we met up. I‚Äôm not interested in going through the same things again when you clearly have not been listening. We‚Äôve been having these kinds of conversations since I was 14 - I do not believe this one will change anything.‚Äù

Then I deleted the link between my email and iMessage. 

He‚Äôs made a couple of shallow attempts to reach out since - a card at Christmas was the first. However it also got back to me that he let his wife complain about me to family (my sibling was in attendance at this event, and even though they explained ‚Äòit‚Äôs between my Father and ChunkyCasper and nothing to do with you‚Äô, she still believes its wholly about her‚Ä¶). So he can‚Äôt have emotional conversations, but he can let his wife attempt to smear his daughter when she‚Äôs not there to defend herself. 

The next attempt was a truly awful bouquet of roses and a box of three long chocolates on my birthday (March) with a computer printed card that said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been thinking and you were right, I could‚Äôve been better.‚Äù

‚ÄúCould‚Äôve been better‚Äù is not a promise to be better in the future, or to even try. It‚Äôs not an apology for being shit , either. Just an acknowledgement that he was shit, and has no intention to change that. 

As an aside - Anyone who actually knows me would know not to send me flowers because I am not someone interested in objects with no real utility that need to be paid attention to. Especially if they‚Äôre ugly, generic flowers. These looked like the kind of bouquet you begrudgingly buy when you go to visit a racist aunt in hospital to stop your gran banging on about her.

Being as bitter as I was, I looked up the brand and bouquet online - total was ¬£21.99 and the chocolate was free. This man has been making hundreds of thousands a year for as long as I can remember. My pain, apparently, is worth ¬£21.99. The cost of the bouquet doesn‚Äôt really matter of course, because the real lack of that damn hug and a listening ear is the real issue - and that would‚Äôve been free.  

I didn‚Äôt want to look at them. I have the flowers to someone passing the house, saying that I was going on holiday and couldn‚Äôt look after them, so at least maybe they may have made someone else happy. I just cried. The lack of real thought was very obvious to me. It takes nothing to spend 3 mins on a flower website and check out the cheapest bunch. It just means he can mentally tick off a ‚Äúmust be seen to care about ChunkyCasper‚Äù box in his emotionally deficient mind. Plus it proves that he still knows my address - if he had really wanted to mend things, he still could‚Äôve come over. 

I know I do not miss him, but I mourn the father-daughter relationship that I never had. My Dad‚Äôs semi-presence prevented me from being able to find a real alternative to that. 

I‚Äôm very luckily that my step dad is a very supportive man, and that the NHS managed to sort my care out to prevent me needing to pay for meds privately. 

This happened very quickly after I had cracked and asked my dad for help, so the irony of this all is that - if he‚Äôd just said yes and agreed to lend me or offered me some money, I actually ended up not needing it but wouldn‚Äôt have realised that he is a spineless, shallow individual who doesn‚Äôt actually care about me, just remembers every now and then that he should try to appear like he should. 

It hurts that I carry his last name, and it invites questions as these days I work with my mum, my step dad and my step sister and colleagues have asked how I have a different surname than them. My stepdad has offered to adopt me, but my stepsister has previously accused him of favouring me to her and I don‚Äôt want to upset her by going ahead with that or by changing my name to theirs, and that wouldn‚Äôt feel like mine, either. 

That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs the post, really.  I saw a meme on Facebook that said, ‚Äúwhoever abandoned you in the middle of the ocean has no right to know what the sharks did to you or how you managed to make it to shore‚Äù, and it did hit home. I was in that ocean, I asked for help, I was pretty much left to sink. I am very fortunate that luck played my way and other help became available. But it makes me extremely bitter at the thought of my Father, and Father‚Äôs Day coming up doesn‚Äôt help. I will try to think of a great gift for my stepdad, at least, to thank him for all the support he has given me over the past 20 years and particularly in the last year.

Breakfast was 2 jimmy dean sausage patties with scrambled eggs (2 eggs and 4tbps of egg whites) and a side of greens, spinach and baby kale. Eggs were cooked with the fat from the sausage and a tiny bit of butter. 

Snack was just a protein shake with whole milk and protein powder and cold brew coffee 

Lunch was oatmeal and chia seeds with coconut flakes and blueberries 

Dinner was a little bit of beef chorizo (mostly for flavor) with a lot of lean ground beef. Mixed with the same scrambled egg mixture from earlier in the day.

About 25 years ago I bought a Timber Creek red LED hat clip flashlight, [\(one of these, but red instead of blue\)](https://www.ebay.com/itm/186689462678) and its been with me ever since.  I've had to replace the batter maybe two or three times in that time but its been perfect for my needs, it doesn't weigh much, it doesn't put out much light, and because its red it doesn't wake the wife or cats up if I use it in the middle of the night.  


The years have caught up to it, and it seems its about time for me to part with this flashlight as the on/off switch doesn't always stay engaged, so I'm looking for a new hat clip and I can't seem to find anything like it.

What I want: 

* Red only
* On/Off only
* Battery powered, not rechargeable
* Not too bright
* Hat Clip
* Small/Light/Low profile

I also have a Baratza Sette 30 grinder that works beautifully. 

However, since a couple of months coffee has started coming out watery and sour. The weird thing is that I really didn‚Äôt change anything from the usual routine, and before it was easy to find a sweet spot that yielded good coffee. The pump sounds normal while operating.

I have tested:
- many different combinations of grinding and tamping strength
- different coffee brands (those that I always used)
- both a pressurized and unpressurized filter
- I have also tried descaling the machine, and cleaned both the portafilter basket and group head screen
No success.

I am starting to suspect some internal issue, like a weakened pump, but I have no skills to fix it (watched some videos online, but the steps looked quite risky and time consuming, especially since I am not sure that‚Äôs the issue) nor I am aware of shops that may service it in my area. Shipping it unfortunately would cost way more than the machine‚Äôs worth. I wanted to just ask if someone here thought I may have missed something, or if they are aware of services that may fix it for cheaper. You guys are my last resort!

Need emotional support from this group.,"I do not have a good relationship with my father. I do not get along with him for a very long time because we argue a lot and he thinks he's right when he's actually wrong. He tries to put me down too. I am so fed up with him that I stop talking to him anymore and move on with my life. My mother knows that I can't get along with him but she doesn't really bother to know why.

December 21, 2021 is the final straw, the day that changed my life and my mother's life forever. I remember that day, my father suddenly flared up at home and wanted to talk to me because I had lost my job at that time during COVID and I only told my mother that I wanted to start a business. I didn't want to talk to him because he was hot tempered at that time. I was upstairs in my bedroom one time when I heard my father was in the garage to grab something. He walked up the stairs and I heard my mom was calling someone on the phone as if this is an emergency or 911. Then I heard my father was banging on my bedroom door and I also heard my mom was talking to my aunt (dad's sister) over the phone to calm him down. Both my parents fought each other verbally and I stayed in my room as to not escalate the situation. I realized at that moment my father used a crowbar and a hammer to hit my bedroom door. My mom was trying to get my aunt to calm him down. But, my aunt was siding with my dad as my mom got into a heated exchange with my dad while I stayed in my bedroom. True colors were starting to come out from my aunt who randomly said to sell the house, which had nothing to do with this problem. I had decided to cut off all ties with my aunt. So when things calm down after about an hour, we all met downstairs to talk about my life. At one point, he told me ""Do you know why we have these two houses?"" This question had nothing to do with the bad relationship I've had with my dad. My dad claimed that his sister helped him buy the two houses about 30 years ago, when I was around 4 years old. My mom and I were not sure if his claims were true. So after we had a serious talk, I went back to my room. I told my mom that night that she needed to protect herself because I believe my father was getting mentally unstable. She didn't take my word seriously.

The next morning, we go about our daily routine. My father at that time was putting seeds on the grass. He angrily threw the bucket on the lawn then he drove out of the house. My mom at that time checked their bank joint account and found out that my dad withdrew almost all of the cash. My mom immediately called him and my father had lost his temper and blaming all kinds of things to my mom and threatening for a divorce. He claimed that he was sending the money back to his sister, the money that his sister helped him buy the two houses 30 years ago. My mom talked to his sister over the phone and his sister claimed that she received the money. That was when I realized I needed to do an investigation. This was the worst week of my life during the time when we were about to celebrate Christmas and New Year. This wasn't normal at all. My mom and I immediately put down all of the Christmas lights in the house right before Christmas holidays. My mom and I were talking about this money issue every single night until around 4am. The damage has been done.

I found out that my dad invited his relatives for lunch and paid for the bill on two separate occasions about a month after he withdrew almost all of the cash in the bank joint account. I wasn't sure what the two occasions were all about but my mom thought that my dad was there to celebrate with his relatives for withdrawing the money and maybe had a conversation about what happened on December 21, 2021.

When I investigated two months after my dad withdrew the money, I found out that my dad didn't pay the money to his sister. He manipulated me and my mom. My dad and his sister lied to my mom. My dad was using the money to buy stocks. He had lost a lot of money in stocks. He has been buying stocks since January 2020. I tried to figure out where he got the money from back then. I found out that he had been receiving money from workers' compensation since January 2020 and used that money to buy stocks. I also found out that he pretended to get injured at work and was telling his workers' compensation lawyer's doctor, that he falsely injured his back. He had been lying to the doctor for two years until his workers' compensation ran out. Two full years of receiving compensation from January 2020 to December 2021. I realized that he had received his last workers' compensation payment on the week of December 21, 2021 and that he had hit rock bottom when he had no cash left to purchase stocks. This explains why he was so heated up and started a fight with me and my mom on that day. I also figured out how he got this idea of buying a bunch of stocks in his brokerage accounts. Basically, he was being scammed online and had been paying for subscriptions every month to receive information on which stocks to buy. He also talked to his cousin about stocks and how to make money. His cousin was so impressed that the cousin gave some money to my dad to invest in stocks. My dad used his cousin's money to buy stocks and now the stocks went downhill.

It took me about 6 months to fully investigate him. Five months later after the fight, I was planning to celebrate my birthday. During my birthday, my mom took my dad's name off from the beneficiary in her personal bank account/will. Several minutes later, my mom and I caught him at the post office. We later found out that he had been hiding all of the workers' compensation payments in the PO box. This is the reason why my mom didn't know anything about my dad receiving workers' compensation for two years.

4 months later, my dad needed to go to the hospital emergency room but my mom brought him to urgent care. The doctor found out that my dad had a minor heart attack a few hours before so he ended up in the hospital for a month to do the bypass heart surgery. My mother thinks that he got bad karma after all he has done. He was about 79 years old at that time when he had the surgery. Why would someone that age gamble so much money in stocks when he is suppose to take care of his health? Imagine the hospital bill he would have to pay. When he saw the dentist, he even told the front office that he couldn't afford to pay for the dentist bill which only cost a few hundred dollars when in reality, he has been putting hundreds of thousands of dollars in stocks and lost so much money. He even made a big deal out of the 40 cents difference in the coffee creamer when it's not on sale. His life went downhill totally.

I finished my investigation. He doesn't know that I know what's going on with him. He will never stop buying stocks and I have no idea when this will end. What if he reaches rock bottom? Because of the bad relationships I've had with him, I stopped communicating with him. He is the type of person who would never admit fault, never admit he is wrong, and never admit he is losing money. I'm not sure if this is an addiction problem or an ego problem. I am sick and tired of him.

Every time when he talks to his friends or relatives, he just pretends that he knows everything including stocks and giving a false impression that he is making money. He is talking bad about my mom to his relatives when it's not even true. He cares about his image so much that nobody knows his true color. He's not a religious person at all but goes to church on Sundays just to wear something nice and talk to his church friends while observing what other people wear to church. And his personality changes with different people. I'm not sure if he is a narcissist or a psychopath. But I know he is very pretentious to the highest level. He's also a kleptomaniac because he stole a meat from the grocery store claiming that he and my mom left the grocery together but in reality, my mom was waiting for him inside the car in the parking lot. He takes free stuff in other places too. He goes to Costco just to eat all the free food samples and goes to a car dealership to get free coffee. Since my mom separated from him physically, he has been living in his bedroom and all the free stuff he accumulated in his room, tells me that he has a hoarding disorder. He looks what's in the trash can or trash bin to see what we've thrown away. He has an impulse control disorder because he takes free stuff, gambles in stocks, and he has food cravings. He needs to know what I'm eating or what my mom is eating. When he makes a mistake, he blames it on my mom. He is also delusional and cannot separate what is reality and what is fantasy. He is out of this world and living in fantasy. He is living in his own bubble. He shows no empathy to others and only feels happy when he sees other people suffer. He is sick in the head and the most disgusting person I've ever known. He's the type of person who would never admit fault, would never go to a psychiatrist, a psychologist or a therapist. His problems will eventually be my mom's problem and my problem.

For now, there are things that I can control and other things that I cannot control. I am setting boundaries around him to protect myself and my mom. If he continues to have a self destructive behavior and he drags my mom down and file a divorce, then this leads to financial destruction. People like my father don't change. I have proof that his health records from his primary doctor show that he doesn't have any back injuries two weeks after he saw his workers' compensation lawyer's doctor, when my dad said that he injured his back. This is a workers' compensation fraud.

He is dangerous and the biggest threat to the household finances. My mom and I discussed a plan to separate all bank joint accounts and to file taxes separately away from him. I suggested her to keep investments separate from him. She decided not to divorce him because this will lead to financial destruction and we are waiting for my dad to pass away. If he runs out of money before he passes away, we are at risk of losing the two houses. I consider him incompetent and unable to make his own decisions because he is reckless and has a dangerous behavior when he handles big amount of money. My mom should have seen this problem long time ago. Many of his friends and relatives are also blinded. Leaving a trail of lies and hiding his problems for a long time have left me and my mom being hurt and be in a vulnerable position.

I come to this conclusion that this problem did not start on December 21, 2021. This problem started way before that before things have exploded on December 21, 2021. My mom and I did not know my father at all after all these years. We did not see this problem back then.

the anti glare film on my 335i's CiC screen has been all scratched up and looked really bad. That's why I decided to remove the film off the screen with glass cleaner and a towel.

I‚Äôm planning to upgrade my system by installing a Coffee Lake R0 stepping CPU (QTJ1 ‚Äì similar to an i9-9900K ES/QS) on a Gigabyte GA-Z170-Gaming K3 rev 1.1 motherboard. I want to make sure I understand the risks and requirements before flashing anything or touching the hardware. üòÖ
In Russian we call ES cpu mutants ü§£

‚öôÔ∏è Current Setup:
Motherboard: Gigabyte GA-Z170-Gaming K3 rev 1.1 (UEFI)

BIOS: F2c (custom mod based on original F2, from 2016)

CPU: Intel i5-6400 (running with BCLK overclock, which I‚Äôd like to keep as a fallback option)

üéØ Goal:
To get a QTJ1 (Coffee Lake R0, 9th gen-like chip) running on this Z170 board with minimal risk, and ideally without any physical pin mods.

‚ùì Questions:
Pin modding: Is it required? Or is it enough to just mod the BIOS with CoffeeTime, assuming the board already supports custom firmware?

Intel ME version:

What ME version should I install for compatibility?

Does it matter if I plan to disable ME afterward (as many guides suggest)?

Should I update ME before flashing BIOS, or after?

BIOS modding base:

Can I safely use my already-modded F2c BIOS as a base for CoffeeTime patching?

Or should I revert to a clean official F2 BIOS before starting the modding process?

Avoiding newer BIOS versions:

F22 and newer don‚Äôt add 9th gen support anyway

They might remove BCLK overclocking support

Include performance-hitting security patches (e.g., Spectre/Meltdown)

May prevent rollback to earlier versions like F2c

‚úÖ What I want to keep:
The ability to fall back to i5-6400 with BCLK OC in case the QTJ1 doesn't boot or is unstable

Avoid flashing anything irreversible or bricking the board

üí¨ TL;DR:
Has anyone successfully run QTJ1 or similar R0 Coffee Lake CPUs on a Z170 Gaming K3? Any advice on:

BIOS version

ME firmware version

Stability

Rollback safety

Any first-hand experience, links to guides, or CoffeeTime configs would be really appreciated. Thanks in advance!",1,1749412395.0,overclocking,0,1.0,False

I will be moving back to the city this fall after spending some time living with my mom in New Jersey for the past six months. I am looking for another female roommate to go apartment hunting with in early September to October. I would like to look for two bedroom apartments in East and Central Harlem, the UES, LIC, Williamsburg, Bushwick, and BedStudy. My budget is $1500, but I am willing to go up to $1750 if needed. 

Some features I would love to have but are not necessary are a dishwasher, bathtub, outdoor space, fire escape, lots of natural light, at least a third floor walk up, in building laundry, gas stove, pre-war with hardwood floors, and pet friendly. 

I work in the bar and nightlife industry, and will be job hunting for a bartending job before I move back to the city. I usually work at night from Wednesday to Sunday, and am usually sleeping until about noon. I am a night owl, but don‚Äôt mind early birds if you are mostly quiet and considerate. I also try to be quiet at night and stay to my room after coming back from work. I also have plans to attend community college part time at some point, so living with another student would be great! 

I am not very organized and neat, but like to keep common spaces clean. I tend to be cluttered in my bedroom, but like to keep food mess in the kitchen and floors clear to prevent pests. I would prefer someone who is the same, but do not mind someone very neat as long as we are compatible. I am sober, but do not mind if you drink. I do not smoke tobacco, but I am a weed smoker so I prefer 420 friendly. I am happy to discuss boundaries around smoking and what we are both okay with (inside ok/not ok, fire escape, not at all, etc). I do not host large parties, but do like to have a few friends over sometimes either for hangouts or sleepovers. I also have a boyfriend, we are long distance but he does visit me every few months. I don‚Äôt have a cat but I love cats so if you have one or are open to me getting one that would be great!

I would love a roommate who is happy to hang out once in a while but who doesn‚Äôt need to be best friends as I prefer to keep to myself sometimes. I love going to the movies, live music, going to bookstores, thrift shopping, coffee, smoking üçÉ, making collages, photography, walking, hiking, camping, running, and collecting books and music. If you like having music on in the living room at all times, talking about books and movies, and discovering new places, we would get along!

I graduated from uni in 2017 with a Textiles Degree, UK. I only did that by changing degree course after hating the one I was originally on (photography) because my house mates work at the time looked funner than what I was doing. Graduated and moved home with family, ended up in retail not really pursuing anything because of crippling depression, which turned out to be severe depression, anxiety and undiagnosed ADHD. 

Worked in retail year and a half, then as a production assistant at a coffee roastery, all the while berating myself that I'm not achieving anything with my life, useless, loser, shit at everything. All still while living at home. 

2020 Covid then happened and while still in mental turmoil and now a never ending life sentence at home (mental spaceat the time did not enjoy it as much as i should have), I hired a Creative coach on some course she was running and painstakingly, crying everyday, worked on my portfolio. After a long time and 100+ job applications I got a job as a ""studio assistant"" for a textiles manufacturing b2b company near north London, I moved out and rented a flat with my boyfriend for the time we were there too. 

Turned out this studio assistant role was actually a maternity cover for their sole in-house graphic designer who'd been there for 10+ years. At this point i was beginning to think i may be more interested in the graphic side of things as opposed to becoming a print pattern designer; this theoretically sounded like a win. I worked there for 2.5/3years and it was a baptism of fire, truly. No previous experience flung into a ""senior"" role with no organisation, no process, no support, just expectation to do things at a speed that, once the original designer was back, I realised was sloppy, lazy, cutting corners kinda work - i always wondered how they managed to churn out what they did - 

I digress, since that job we made a financial decision to move back in with family to save for a deposit because I was on minimum wage and my partner was paying for most of everything so he didn't have a hope in hell. I quit that job, thankfully my mental health is so much better now, I currently work part time at a garden centre and wanting to continue to build up experience in graphic design. However, I feel too sad and stuck like I'll never make anything of my life, too stuck to try to design anything and overwhelmed. That's why I'm thinking I shouldn't be one because I lack the motivation to do it or the ability to do it off my own back and there's SO SO many more talented designers already out there. Who am I to get a job with a cool studio when there's people living for this? Who've studied it? 
I start thinking ill never be good enough and somedays I want to do it and I'm totally frozen by how and what to start. I want to earn decent money i want to be good at something but my lack of self confidence, inability to actually create and do, my questioning is killing me off. I don't want to be stuck in my life I want to make something of it. So does anyone else, in a way, have a similar experience?

There‚Äôs something in here with me, I first saw it a week ago. I was up late when out the corner of my eye a figure moved to my open bedroom door, or maybe it was there the whole time and that was just the first I noticed it, either way I panicked and went for my gun. After turning to grab it and rack the slide the looming figure hadn‚Äôt moved from just inside my doorway. You gotta understand, I live alone in a rough city so some stranger coming into my room at night is worst case scenario. The muzzle flash lit up my room and for just a brief moment I saw a vague silhouette of a man where the figure stood, it looked like an upright shadow with muted features cast on the air itself, not the wall or door behind it. I turned on the lights but it was gone, the hole in my drywall wasn‚Äôt and I could hear my upstairs neighbors freaking out over the ringing in my ears.¬†

I couldn‚Äôt tell the cops the truth since they‚Äôd throw me in a ward, if I left out some details they‚Äôd probably still throw me in a box for reckless endangerment or something since there obviously wouldn‚Äôt be any signs of a break in. So I lied, played dumb and said that my hand slipped as I was checking if it was loaded when I was moving it to a case. I don‚Äôt know if any of you have ever had to call in a ND on yourself but it is humiliating. The cops take it very seriously as you‚Äôre assumed to be an ‚Äúactive shooter‚Äù, which I guess is understandable but it still meant I had to walk backwards in front of every apartment window until they had me on the ground and in cuffs, then they walk through your rooms looking at everything while their guys at the station dig into every slight and stumble you made since the fourth grade and relay them to the silently judgmental cops to question you on it. If you stay calm and answer all their questions they won‚Äôt say to your face that they think you‚Äôre too incompetent to handle scissors unsupervised, but it‚Äôs very clear that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre thinking. This goes on for over an hour while you‚Äôre totally powerless and just want them to leave but nothing you say can make this happen until they‚Äôre done with their probing and indignant glances. When they were finally done with me I only had a few hours until I had to get ready for work.

It was three days later when I saw it again, this time partially obscured by the half opened closet door. I instinctively reached for my gun again but stopped as the experience of reporting my first attempt at such an action overpowered the fear of that stranger in my closet, pretty sure they wouldn‚Äôt let me walk free a second time not to mention all I accomplished for that sacrifice was a new hole by the bedroom door. So I just sat back and looked at it. It didn‚Äôt appear to be doing anything besides blocking my view of fancy clothes I haven‚Äôt worn in years. I waited as fear settled to unease and finally to boredom. When I turned on the light there was a moment that the faintest of shadows still stood in that closet before disappearing but that was probably just my mind connecting pieces that weren‚Äôt there.¬†

And thats been my life for the last few days, I leave the lights on at night and I‚Äôm allowed to be alone. I still see it sometimes in dark rooms before entering or poorly lit corners of basements at work but shining some light is enough to keep it away. I‚Äôm writing this here because if you guys think I‚Äôm lying or crazy it won‚Äôt carry the same consequences of a cop or doctor thinking the same, and I do feel the need to tell someone about this. I think I‚Äôll use this as a sort of public journal and update it if things change.

It was in my van today. A job went late due to ‚Äúunexpected‚Äù leaks, the building is older than anyone alive to read this and I doubt the pipes are any newer, not that the customers maintenance department had done anything to preserve them or even know where they lead. Long story short I spent far too much time above ceiling tiles and in storage rooms trying to find and repair all the leaks, which meant by the time I left the sun had set hours ago. It was a long day and I was tired so my new problem wasn‚Äôt on my mind when I went to my van in the dark lot, or as I was leaving the commercial park. It wasn‚Äôt until I was merging onto the freeway and checked my mirrors that I was suddenly reminded of what was waiting for me.¬†

You know that feeling you get when someone is staring at you? Eyes burning into the back of your head? This was different, it didn‚Äôt feel like something was watching me, it felt more like I had my back to a burning car. A car isn‚Äôt malicious, not hateful, not threatening, but can hurt you all the same. The immediate swerve as I flinched snapped me out of it and I returned my focus to the road. It never moved, just a black void silhouette in my rearview mirror keeping me company. I left my bag in the back of the van for now, I‚Äôll grab it in the morning.

Caught another mouse in a bucket trap today, I don‚Äôt know when it fell in but when I saw it this morning it tried jumping out. The sides are way too tall for it to jump over and it must‚Äôve already tried that when it first fell in but I guess seeing me looming motivated it to try again despite knowing it wouldn‚Äôt work. Poor little guy looked exhausted but it ate some of the peanut butter I dropped in before driving it to the marsh for release.

The figure is showing up with the lights on now, still in darker areas and faded but it‚Äôs there. When I was doing a job at a plant it was in an active loading dock and a forklift drove right through it, the cracked concrete barriers lead me to believe sobriety isn't required for operators but it‚Äôs safe to say no one else can see my shadow.¬†

Since it doesn‚Äôt matter anymore I‚Äôm turning the lights off when I sleep. Not the worst roommate I‚Äôve had.

12Apr25

I touched it. Not the smartest thing I‚Äôve ever done, maybe it was the Pabst, maybe I was curious, but I got my arm up to the elbow in the thing. At first I thought nothing happened but when I focused on it I could feel nothing. You can feel your tongue in your mouth, your shirt on your skin, the temperature on your palms. I could feel my hoodie weigh down on my bicep but nothing past that, not hot, not cold, weightless, just nothing. Nothing when I clenched my fist, nothing when I swung around, only when I pulled it back out did everything rush back. It felt heavy.

I‚Äôve been thinking about that a lot lately, what nothing would feel like, nothing isn‚Äôt right, absence is better, the absence of things, feeling, no weight or tension or stress, a complete blank, void. It‚Äôs still there, here, even as I‚Äôm typing this. Even if I don‚Äôt do it today, or tomorrow, I know I will at some point so why delay things. I‚Äôm going for a walk.

Photographic memory is a myth, the mind isn‚Äôt like a computer with billions of data points saved and organized ready to pull up at any moment, the mind is fluid and flexible, better with recognition and concepts, filling in gaps from ideas half remembered and memories twisted by emotion. My memory has always been very good, I have a natural talent for organizing and documenting what I see with only the faintest distortions, this has helped me quite a bit with my chosen career path where tying data points from shipping to component testing to customer contracts need to be organized into a readable document. I pride myself on my reliability and memory, and I lost my favorite pen.

A Pilot G2 fine tip gel pen, I picked it up four years ago to sign the contract for my current employer and has been the only pen I‚Äôve used ever since. It survived a near miss with a particularly bad tropical storm and has gone through several replacement cartridges, its housing is faded but there‚Äôs no bite marks or broken clip like I see from its less fortunate brothers in the office. When I woke up one morning it was missing from my drawer in the bedside table.

I almost missed my bus looking for it, it wasn‚Äôt at the office either and I had to borrow a Bic with a white stress mark where someone almost took the clip off the cap. Getting a replacement G2 was a disaster since I somehow misplaced my bus pass and had to spend far more than was reasonable to get an uber ride back home. Then my lip balm, a sock, and my purse. This sort of thing doesn‚Äôt happen to me. Then one morning there was a pen in my bedside table.¬†

It was a Pilot G2 fine tip gel pen, the words were faded and the cartridge was new, it looked like my pen but it wasn‚Äôt my pen. I don‚Äôt know how I know but I do, it was an exact copy but it wasn‚Äôt mine and it was exactly where I left it. Other items started ‚Äúreturning‚Äù, I threw them all away. On a Friday I was working late as several of my documents had been copied or altered in very minor but impactful ways and they had to be fixed in order to prevent inaccuracies. Because I was at the office I was almost an hour late for my weekly call to my mother, but when I opened my recent calls it said that I had an outgoing call to Mom 47 minutes ago.¬†

She didn‚Äôt understand why I called her back so quickly and was worried when I asked what we spoke about, I tried to convince her that I was ok but I don‚Äôt think she believed me. I‚Äôm not ok. Things keep disappearing and something wrong comes back, my social media and subscription accounts lock me out for changed passwords, my coworkers reference conversations that we‚Äôve never had.¬†

It‚Äôs been getting harder to breath and I‚Äôve been coughing more and more, I figured it was just stress but it got bad enough that I went to get a doctors opinion on it. I haven‚Äôt been in a hospital since Dad but even I know that when doctors gather around your test results that‚Äôs a bad sign. I‚Äôve been diagnosed with Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome. They want to run more tests but they started to forget where my room is. I just want to go home, my home, not a home that looks like mine, stolen, replaced. How long until I am stolen.

There‚Äôs power in dreams. When I was six I saw myself walking with my friend at night to his house, I was carrying a blanket and crying, his porchlight was so bright I could see the shadows of each blade of grass painted onto the concrete of the driveway. That dream stuck with me until I was nine and my brother didn‚Äôt come home from walking the dog, I had a sleepover planned that night and the porch light stared at me with disgust.

Dreams are thoughts without structure, the brain picks concepts with no regard as to their construction. Scared of heights? You‚Äôre in a blimp, but also it‚Äôs a hotdog factory and you‚Äôre late for your shift in the coal mine. Dreams are ideas not fully formed, fears not overcome, concepts not understood. Sometimes dreams are memories, happy moments with family, exciting times of fun, or trauma you'd rather forget. Memories shift in dreams to highlight that key feature, alter to more fully represent the meaning of the thing. I have dreams like these, silly, scary, personal, but I also have other dreams, so mundane that they stand out in the dreamscape, so complete that they couldn‚Äôt be made up in the moment by chemical reactions, so impactful that I remember them for months or years without a detail forgotten.¬†

Twelve years old I saw myself at a gas station sitting on the curb with sirens lighting up the windows, I looked taller but not an adult. This time I had more to go off of and was desperate not to repeat the past. I biked around town until I found a 7-11 that matched my dream, it was a block from the highschool which gave me at least a couple years to prepare. I begged my parents to sign me up for Karate, joined the scouts to learn first aid, and even got a hold of a taser by saving up allowance and cutting a deal with the older kids. I didn‚Äôt tell my parents why of course, they were just happy I was getting out of the house and talking to people, they did occasionally hint at improving my grades for med school.

Fifteen years old and someones grandmother collapsed by the coffee machines, I called 911 with the memorized address, checked her vitals, and started CPR. My response was immediate, I was trained, and it didn‚Äôt matter. I dropped out of Karate and scouts after that. I dropped out of a lot of things really, my grades, my hobbies, most of my friends. I wasn‚Äôt in a good place for a very long time, my parents tried to help but I wasn‚Äôt ready to be helped.

Seventeen years old I saw my best friend drowning in his own vomit to the flashing colors of a flatscreen tv. I wasn‚Äôt in this dream but it was so vivid, so real, I even recognized the episode playing to his soon to be corpse was season seven of his ‚Äúcomfort series‚Äù, most importantly, and I don‚Äôt know how I knew this, but this dream was from that very night.

I ran across the asphalt road in a mixture of dread and blind panic, the porch light pleading for me to open the door but it was locked and my banging and screams went unanswered. The glass back door left deep cuts in my arm and bare feet but it hardly registered. I found him in the basement convulsing with the needle still in his leg and the episode credits lighting up the clear bottle. The emergency operator was very patient considering how difficult it must‚Äôve been to understand my blubbering speech and gave me instructions and assurances that an ambulance was coming as quickly as it could.

Both of us spent the night in the ER. He had to be intubated and I needed what felt like an unreasonable amount of stitches, but both of us would be going home. It took a month for me to get clean and the next six to squeeze out enough credits to graduate with my class, I wasn‚Äôt going to be a doctor any time soon but you wouldn‚Äôt know that if you just saw the looks on my parents faces during the ceremony. Some community college and the wonderful world of employment is enough for me.

The dreams come and go, sometimes so vague that I don‚Äôt understand what they could possibly mean until after they‚Äôve come to pass, like my poor head gasket. Once it was so specific that I introduced myself to a coworker with their favorite coffee, two sugar, one cream, hazelnut. Sometimes they‚Äôre not even about me or anyone I know. But that‚Äôs not why I‚Äôm writing this, all of that is to emphasize that dreams are not new to me, they no longer scare me or hold power over me and I can understand the difference between silly nothings and something real.¬†

I‚Äôm writing this because the dreams I‚Äôve been having lately are different. A man stepping through a door to the void, a woman having their life stolen piece by piece, a voyeur watching things that shouldn‚Äôt be, the birth of a hunter, and a sea of light and eyes. That last one is spilling over.

\[USER 4\]

I promise I‚Äôm not a pervert, I just like watching people. I know that sounds bad and I admit it‚Äôs weird but I‚Äôm not a creep. I bought a camera off facebook marketplace from some college student that used it twice for a class they didn‚Äôt care about and wanted some extra cash for spring break, I didn‚Äôt know what I was going to use it for but I needed a fresh hobby and I figured this would spice up my hiking. Hills and trees digitally captured quickly lost their appeal, squirrels and deer were more interesting as there was suddenly a time limit as to how long they‚Äôd stay in one place and those photos became something of a sport. I settled on birdwatching for a while as a happy medium, they are very active so timing was important but if you miss your shot they are much more comfortable with returning and giving you a second chance.

It was when I was photographing some crows that I first saw one of them. It was some sort of social worker or pastor or something, whatever it was pretending to be it was talking to the homeless and passing out food and pamphlets. Something about it just didn‚Äôt look right, maybe it was just that I wasn‚Äôt used to seeing people interact with the locals or the uniform looking green tee but something about it was wrong.¬†

It stuck with me for the next few days and I found I was paying more attention to the people around me than the birds I was there for. As I was eating dinner and sorting my photos I needed to organize a new folder for all the fishermen, pedestrians, drivers, and homeless that I saw. Each person fit a different role, if they fit into a category (driver), then I could divide them into a subcategory (professional), and further divide them into attitude (impatient). Much like how birds travel in flocks or pairs or alone, or how they are scavengers or gatherers or hunters or a mix, people can be categorized the same way.¬†

The biggest difference between birds and people is that birds don‚Äôt act differently if they know they‚Äôre being watched. People will act guarded, mute their traits and behaviours, when they think they‚Äôre alone they become real. Drivers will pick their nose, pedestrians will scratch their butts, homeless will play on their phones. Some people believe they‚Äôre alone just because there‚Äôs no one else in their home, they‚Äôll leave their blinds open for me to see the grandmother eat mayonnaise with a spoon, the cute jogger strip her workout clothes directly into the washing machine, and the burly mechanic fall asleep to MLP. My folders continued to expand and divide, each time it dropped a layer of assumed privacy their guards would drop and give more truthful behavior.¬†

It was a few months until I spotted the creature again, speaking to the homeless and passing out food. I had learned a lot more about people since I first saw it and was able to recognize behaviours I‚Äôve been documenting and organizing. The homeless man was more guarded and distrusting than when they normally accept items from pedestrians and drivers, the creature wasn‚Äôt as much guarded as they were mimicking, putting on a face of emotion, but the underlying behaviour is easily spotted if you practice looking for it. I‚Äôve found the stationary variant of homeless is adept at spotting these behaviours as well and this one likely saw what I did in the creature, anticipation, hunger.

I followed it for the rest of my lunch break, it didn‚Äôt go far, after leaving the park it entered a townhouse at the end of the road. The connected buildings were all long abandoned and boarded up, the creatures den had shut blinds on every window. This one would not allow me to view it without the mask.¬†

I really enjoy this new hobby and invested in some extra equipment so I can continue to watch the den and its inhabitants' schedule and behavior. It was fascinating. It had a windowless van with the same logo it wore on its shirt that would be parked behind the dwelling and be driven at any time of day and return after as little as 15 minutes or as long as 12 hours, it would go on walks in either direction for minutes or hours or just stand by the front door for just as long. Everything I saw seemed completely random and without structure except every ten days a whole pack of these creatures would converge on the den and would all leave at once far after sunset.¬†

I followed a few of these creatures after their communion, the way they traveled was confident, they never scanned for threats or looked behind them, which was lucky for me as I must‚Äôve been displaying very noticeable behavior, as much as I learned the habits of others I never thought to learn to mask my own. I found they had dens of their own, just as impervious to my eyes as the first. I had to see inside.

My chance finally came four days after a communion. Two days earlier the van had left and didn‚Äôt return, this is the longest the den had been empty and was the best opportunity I was going to get to see what this creature was hiding from me. The front door was locked but there was a back door that shared a blindspot from the remote camera with where the van was normally parked, that door was left open, lucky for me. The inside of the house was normal enough from a glance but just inside the open back door was another open door leading to a basement. The inside of the door and walls of the stairwell were covered in that foam stuff you see in recording booths.

The creature was in the basement, chest and head torn open. The lighting wasn‚Äôt very good but I did manage to get a good angle shot that draws the eye to the depth. The next communion lasted much longer and only ended after a series of vans with the same logo were filled with boxes and bags from the original den. I was worried that my new hobby was over and they‚Äôd all scamper off to find new dens but it seems the death of their matriarch wasn‚Äôt enough to get them to relocate just yet.¬†

I found nine dens, I don‚Äôt have the funds or the time to monitor them all but I did find that several of them go to the same place during their outings, some old warehouse near the waterfront in the industrial district, same logo as on all the trucks. I‚Äôm sure if I was smarter I could‚Äôve searched for what charity uses that logo and found the warehouse sooner but honestly I don‚Äôt care that much about researching stuff, I just want to see. I‚Äôm monitoring the warehouse and things are getting interesting, they‚Äôre moving boxes and spending more time here and not their dens, more importantly I‚Äôm not the only one watching, whoever these new things are they are clearly not the same as the creatures I‚Äôve been seeing, but I need to keep watching to pin down why.

I can tell something exciting is going to happen, I‚Äôve been spending more time watching in person so I can be there to see it. Obviously the longer I do this the more I risk being seen and there‚Äôs already one dead body that I know of, I should probably be scared, I should probably stop. Anyway I decided to post this here so someone else will see. It‚Äôs a fun hobby.

\[USER 5\]

I‚Äôve killed someone and I‚Äôm going to do it again. I‚Äôve been magnet fishing for the last couple years, it‚Äôs fun even if most times all I find are fishing hooks and bottle caps. Pulled out an electric scooter once, that was cool. Standard metal doesn‚Äôt really do anything when submerged, in fact retired warships are intentionally sunk to act as a platform for reefs to grow on, the lithium battery though will leak poison when compromised. Magnet fishing is fun but it really isn‚Äôt helpful outside of the rare occasions like that when I can remove a source of damage, and it‚Äôs kinda lonely being on a bridge by yourself, so I started looking into volunteer groups so my free time can have some sort of impact.

I bounced between a few groups cleaning parks and fixing trails, even did landscaping to an old graveyard once, some clearing revealed what was thought to be just a rock was actually the corner of a headstone that even the church that kept the grounds didn‚Äôt know about, kinda sad if you think about it. I wasn‚Äôt a regular with any of these groups because they were either college kids that cared too much about interpersonal drama and feeling morally superior or older people that were straight laced and out of touch. That led me to a sort of soup kitchen.

‚ÄúSort of‚Äù is key, lots of sandwiches and pastas, clothes and soaps were also on the menu. I did my normal thing by making myself useful moving heavy objects as needed and letting the petty people do the feel good work. One of the ladies passing out clothes started pulling jackets out of a box I was moving and said something along the lines of ‚ÄúYou know you wouldn‚Äôt need to be moving so many boxes if we passed out fentanyl with the spaghetti.‚Äù I was taken aback, of course that‚Äôs a terrible thing to say but honestly I was just happy that someone working here didn‚Äôt have their head up their ass. Besides, it was pretty funny.¬†

I became a regular at that kitchen, moving boxes and crates while making the occasional dark joke about our clientele with the lady in the green shirt, we even started carpooling. She was an odd one, the other volunteers gave her the cold shoulder which made me like her more, yeah we might be rude and crude but we were there to do the work that helps people as opposed to the social club that dilly dallies and dramas. The lady, I‚Äôll call her Martha, did this volunteer stuff all the time and much longer than me, that green shirt she always wore was from some charity group she was in that helped distribute supplies to kitchens and the like but was too remote to open their own kitchen, which is why Martha was volunteering with these other groups.

I joined Martha on other charity stuff after some of my shifts, instead of moving boxes and getting ignored by all the gossiping paragons of virtue we would walk around to pass out food and pamphlets to the homeless that either avoided or didn‚Äôt know where the kitchens were. Martha got some of the same looks and responses as the kitchen volunteers gave her, some seemed hesitant to say anything to her while giving me looks of suspicion and curiosity. I thought that was odd but as long as they took the food and pamphlets it wasn't my problem.

Neither of us were particularly talkative but we did chat between clients. Martha had a very harsh and blunt sense of humor, but notably it wasn‚Äôt all jokes. She really did look down on the people we were helping, I just didn‚Äôt believe they should be treated like children. From the outside it looks very similar but believe me there is a very big difference between making jokes about someone for their odor and insinuating that someone is a disease infecting the city. Still,¬†Martha was helping these people more than I was and dark honesty is preferable over moral grandstanding. I never really gave her any pushback on her statements about the world in general and the homeless in particular, it was fun conversation and in theory I agreed with most of it.

I have a feeling Martha didn‚Äôt have many friends which is why despite our limited conversations when she invited me into her house to show me something I wasn‚Äôt that surprised, I accepted the invitation since to be honest I didn‚Äôt have many friends either. She lived in some shit hole townhouse in the slums, which at least explained why she had such a passion for her field, this place was lousy with them and I was glad it was her turn to drive since I wouldn‚Äôt feel comfortable parking my car on the street here.

Martha poured some wine and spoke about her charity, or club maybe, lots of vague terms that honestly I don‚Äôt remember too well, but the way she was talking was much bigger picture than a local charity really warranted. I‚Äôm fuzzy on the details and figured the grandiose language was just being used because she felt a personal attachment to her main charity, anyway it sounded like she was inviting me to join her and I agreed because fuck it why not. She smiled at that, which I then realized was probably the first time I‚Äôve seen her face do that, then she led me into the basement.

There was some homeless guy chained to the wall. Not great. She pushed me in the back, nearly throwing me into the man on the wall with far more force than I thought her capable of, when I turned she still wore that smile but her eyes started pooling red, filling in the whites and invading the black pupils, her veins bulged, whatever ‚ÄúMartha‚Äù was it wasn‚Äôt human.

It spoke again, inviting me to the family, like minded people that saw the big picture unclouded by the emotion and morality of the masses, progress and security requires sacrifice and longevity. The blood of man can be utilized to extend the lives of those willing to take it and change themselves to accept it. She spoke of the weakness of man, ego and emotion and weakness lead to self destruction and is inevitable as long as man is left to govern themselves. The family will step in after man ravages itself and lead the new world, I was looking for purpose and the family will give it to me.

I had to use one of the knives laying around to dig the metal out of its chest and head, in retrospect I should‚Äôve also burned the place but at the time I was only thinking the rounds could be tied to my daily carry, also the concussion and wailing about light made it hard to think. After a lot of crying and thanks and promises not to tell anyone the homeless man left the van and I torched it before a very quiet ride home in my own car. If my rib isn‚Äôt broken it‚Äôs at least bruised. I‚Äôll give it another week before heading out again, I need the prep time anyway.

\[UPDATE\]

My doctor prescribed sleeping pills but if anything they only make it worse, the eyedrops help though. The dreams come every night now, I‚Äôm trying to understand them but the blinding light and eyes flood over everything. I know where it‚Äôs going to happen, even if I don‚Äôt know what ‚Äúit‚Äù is. I have to go, I need these dreams to stop.

Chapter 1 

I was finally able to fall asleep after cleaning the house, washing the dishes, doing the laundry, making dinner, and getting my brothers and sister to bed, not to mention getting my homework done. I have a major paper due tomorrow, and I just finished it. Getting it done with three three-year-old toddlers running around is not the easiest thing to do. I had just finally fallen into a deep slumber when I was ripped out of bed and dragged down the stairs. Damn that is going to leave a mark or two. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck is this shit?‚Äù My mother yelled at me. ‚ÄúYour father will be home soon, get this shit cleaned up!‚Äù She shouted, throwing me in the kitchen. ‚ÄúFirst of all, you made this mess, I had everything spotless, so you need to clean up after yourself and secondly, he‚Äôs NOT my FATHER!‚Äù I spat back. My mother reared back and slapped me so hard that she drew blood and making me fall back to the floor. I shook my head slightly trying to get my bearings back. ‚ÄúHe IS your FATHER! Now get this shit cleaned up before he gets home.‚Äù She shrieked at and stormed out of the kitchen to her room. This isn‚Äôt the first time she has done this; she would come home and make a mess and tell him that I didn‚Äôt do any of my chores. My mom‚Äôs not as bad as he can be, he can be downright evil. He beat me so badly once that I could hardly move and of course that meant I couldn‚Äôt clean, cook, or take care of the triplets and that made things worse, and it led to another beating. I had to force myself up to get things done. Eventually I fell into a routine and was able to get everything done, even on the days when my mom came home in a bitchy mood.



I was in the middle of cleaning up the mess my mom made when HE walked into the kitchen. ‚ÄúWhat is this shit? Why is nothing clean!‚Äù I heard him bellow. I was already pissed at mom, so this was not going to be good for me in the end. ‚ÄúIt was clean until your wife got home and decided that her day wasn‚Äôt complete until she made mine into shit!‚Äù I spat; my words laced with venom. ‚ÄúWhat did you say?!‚Äù He snarled. I saw his eyes shift back and forth between his brown color to pitch black. He always did that when he got angry. ‚ÄúYou heard me; I didn‚Äôt stutter.‚Äù I yelled at him as I finished cleaning up after my mom. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you ever speak about your mother like that!‚Äù He yelled, the next thing I knew pain was shooting down my neck. I fell to my knees grabbing the back of my head. I tried to stand but his fist cracked against the right side of my face. ‚ÄúYou will show us some respect!‚Äù He growled out standing over me. ‚ÄúI told you he wouldn‚Äôt be happy.‚Äù Mom sneered. ‚ÄúC‚Äômon Freddy dear, I‚Äôm tired, it‚Äôs been a long day.‚Äù She told him rubbing herself against him, that is so gross. He pulled her to his chest as she purred in his arms. She gave him her, what she calls, her sexy smile and walked out of the kitchen, swaying her hips. ‚ÄúI better not find any blood here in the morning. You understand?‚Äù He yelled. I didn‚Äôt answer so he repeated himself and he hated to repeat himself. ‚ÄúDO. YOU. UNDERSTAND.‚Äù He gritted out. ‚ÄúDO NOT MAKE ME REPEAT MYSELF.‚Äù He growled as he towered over me, and I nodded my head.

Once I was finally finished cleaning the kitchen, again, I went to bed, praying I could get a few hours of sleep before my alarm went off. My alarm clock went off at five a.m., I groaned and shut it off. I went to my bathroom as quietly as I could since the triplets slept in my room. I did my business, showered, brushed my teeth, and got started on trying to hide the bruises on my face. They were a little darker than usual, so I wasn‚Äôt able to cover them all the way. I did the best I could. I walked out of the bathroom to find my little ones wide awake and sitting quietly waiting for me. Fred has them trained and so scared not to cry, yell, or throw temper tantrums. He beat me in front of them when they misbehaved and told them that if they keep it up, he will do the same thing to them. It only took for them to see him beat me once and they never made a peep again. I would take a beating for them anytime; the slightest squeal of joy would throw both of into a fit of rage. Imagine that the squeal of happiness from their children makes them angry.

‚ÄúStowme.‚Äù I heard Ryder call out softly. ‚ÄúGood morning my little loves. Did you sleep well?‚Äù I asked, helping them from their bed and placed them on the floor. They nodded their heads with yawns. ‚ÄúC‚Äômon, we need to get you cleaned up and outta your jammies.‚Äù I told them as they waddled to the bathroom. Nancy never took care of them, except for the first six months after they were born she was a good mom and I thought that maybe she would change but when they turned six-month-old, she started back to work and would stay out late. Fred moved their stuff into my room and told me that they are now my problem and responsibility and that they are my kids now. By the time I got the four of us ready it was six thirty. I took them downstairs, packed their snack bags, their sippy cups, grabbed our backpacks and quietly made our way out the door. Fred and Nancy were still asleep, they slept until whenever they decided to get up. They both worked in the evening until sometime in the early morning hours, it usually worked out because we hardly ever had to see each other, unless Nancy was in one of her moods or I accidentally came face to face with one of them.

Chapter 2

My first class started at eight fifteen, giving me a little over an hour to drop them off at daycare, which was on campus, run by the child development department. Since I didn‚Äôt have money to pay I explained my situation to them, well except the beatings. They were able to find a scholarship to help pay for the triplets fees, they even offered me a job to help me make some money to take care of my siblings. ‚ÄúGood morning, Stormie.‚Äù Mrs. Black, the director of the center, greeted. ‚ÄúMorning.‚Äù I chirped back. ‚ÄúMowny.‚Äù The triplets greeted in unison. ‚ÄúWhy good morning little ones. Are you ready to get your day started?‚Äù She asked them, bending down to their level. ‚ÄúYesh ma‚Äôam.‚Äù They smiled. ‚ÄúWell come along, you can help me get things ready. Get your bags and say goodbye to mom.‚Äù They walked over to me, who they call mama, I put their backpacks on them, and they each gave me a hug and kiss and waddled off with Mrs. Black. Mrs. Black turned to me and mouthed, See ya later. I waved at Mrs. Black and made my way out. The weather was starting to change, it was getting cooler, the leaves were changing colors and that means winter break is around the corner. I hate winter break; the beatings always got worse.

‚ÄúHi, what would you like?‚Äù The girl behind the counter asked with boredom. ‚ÄúA large hot mocha please.‚Äù I was digging through my bag looking for my wallet when the girl said, ‚Äúfour dollars and twenty-five cents, please.‚Äù She huffed at me. ‚ÄúSorry, sorry, sorry, I have my wallet in here somewhere.‚Äù I smiled at her. ‚ÄúLook lady, if you can‚Äôt pay, why did you order?‚Äù ‚ÄúI can pay, I just can‚Äôt find my wallet.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre holding up the line.‚Äù She snapped. I turned around and saw that there were six people behind me. ‚ÄúC‚Äômon lady, hurry up!‚Äù Someone grunted. ‚ÄúYeah, we‚Äôre gonna be late for class.‚Äù I blushed in embarrassment. ‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù I said one more time and ran out. I couldn‚Äôt help it, but I started crying. As I was hurrying out, I bumped into a wall, well it felt like a wall, but it turned out to be a person a very HUGE person, a male person. I bumped into him so hard that we both dropped our things. I quickly picked up my things. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry.‚Äù I muttered looking at the stranger. We made eye contact and wholly shitzu, I felt like I was hit by a lightning bolt. Who is this Greek God looking back at me? He has the deepest gray eyes, shoulder length black hair and his lips, his oh so plump kissable lips. What is wrong with me? I don‚Äôt even know him, and my lower region is on fire. I heard him say, ‚ÄúMATE - MINE.‚Äù I gave him a confused look and then he shook his head lightly. ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù His voice sent chills down my spine. ‚ÄúUmm‚Ä¶Yeah, I‚Äôm fine.‚Äù I answered him softly as he extended his hand to help me up. I reluctantly put my hand in his. I had no idea what happened, but I felt jolts of electricity flow through my body. He felt it also because he inhaled sharply. I pulled my hand away from his and thought I heard a low growl from him. The way he looked at me made me wish I had a change of panties. ‚ÄúUh, again, sorry. I need to go. I‚Äôm gonna be late for class.‚Äù I said backing away from him. I wasn‚Äôt anywhere from being late for class, I still had at least an hour, but I couldn‚Äôt chance letting him get any ideas that I was interested in him, even though I wouldn‚Äôt mind climbing that mountain. He opened his mouth to say something, but I turned tail and ran off. What did he mean by saying, MATE MINE? I knew I could never belong to anyone, except of course to Fred, he would never let me go. Although I‚Äôm sure my mom wouldn‚Äôt mind, she wouldn‚Äôt miss us, she would be free to live her life like she wants, not that she doesn‚Äôt already. 

I was deep in thought when I heard someone clear their throat and ask, ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù I looked up and saw a pretty blue eyed, perky blonde smiling at me. ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm fine.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt even realize I was on the ground. I grumbled in embarrassment. ‚ÄúIt happens, here let me help you up.‚Äù She said, extending her hand. ‚ÄúOh my! What happened to your face? Did someone here hurt you?‚Äù She gasped. ‚ÄúWhat?! Oooh, nothing. I‚Äôm just very clumsy, as you can see, I wasn‚Äôt paying attention and got hit by a door.‚Äù I tried to explain but the look on her face told her that she didn‚Äôt believe me. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôll excuse me‚Ä¶"""" I started to say. ‚ÄúHere, try this.‚Äù She said handing me a bottle of cover up. ‚ÄúC‚Äômon, let's see if we can get this covered.‚Äù She offered. ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù I sighed as we walked into the lady‚Äôs room, and the girl applied the cover up. ‚ÄúBy the way my name is Stormie.‚Äù I smiled faintly. ‚ÄúNice to meet you, Stormie.‚Äù She smiled back at me. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Summer SilverMoon, I just transferred, so today is my first day.‚Äù She replied, stood back, and admired her work. ‚ÄúThere all covered up.‚Äù She turned me to look in the mirror. ‚ÄúWhoa!‚Äù I gasped. Whatever she did, she was able to cover every single bruise and cut. I need to ask her how to do that. ‚ÄúThank you. I really appreciate it.‚Äù I softly said. ‚ÄúNo problem. Would you tell me who did this to you?‚Äù She asked. I stood there in silence, no one ever asked me about my bruises. They always walked by and ignored me. ‚ÄúI know we just met but if you ask for help, I can help you.‚Äù Summer offered. I wanted to ask for help, but I was scared. I knew that Fred would never let me go, he would follow me to the end of the world if he had to.

Chapter 3

When Summer realized that I wasn‚Äôt going to answer her she changed the subject. ‚ÄúSo, what class are you going to? Ethics with Mr. Sheridan.‚Äù ‚ÄúHey me too!‚Äù She said with excitement. ‚ÄúBut he‚Äôs not the instructor anymore.‚Äù She said as we walked into the classroom. ‚ÄúWhat? He‚Äôs been teaching since the semester started.‚Äù I frowned. ‚ÄúYeah, rumor is that he was in a car accident over the weekend, so there‚Äôs a new instructor.‚Äù She explained. How did I not know this? I asked myself. Oh yeah, three 3-year-old little terrors, my little terrors. I have no time for anything else outside of them, right now, they are my life. We walked into the classroom, and I started making my way to my normal seat at the top of the room. Summer tugged at my arm and led me to the second-row corner seats. I shook my head no. I didn‚Äôt like sitting so close, it was easier for me to stay invisible, especially when I had bruises to hide. ‚ÄúSummer, I‚Äôm gonna go sit up there, these seats are just too close to the front.‚Äù I said pointing to my regular seat and lowering my head. ‚ÄúNo, please sit with me. I can‚Äôt see the board from way up there and you‚Äôre the only person I know.‚Äù Summer pouted. I groaned, I hate pouting, the triplets do it all the time, Summer reminded me of them. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt pout!‚Äù I groaned at her. She kept her pout going and gave puppy dog eyes. ‚ÄúUuggg‚Ä¶fine, okay.‚Äù I grumbled and Summer squealed in delight. I shook my head and settled into my seat as the rest of the class started making their way in. I got a few glances and stares, but I just kept my head down and chatted with Summer.

‚ÄúOh, my Goddess!‚Äù A shrill voice came from behind us. Have you seen our new instructor?! She excitedly asked her friend. I rolled my eyes. ‚ÄúI got a peek at him and the other guy as I passed by his office on my way here.‚Äù She smirked. ‚ÄúThey are both beyond hot and they don‚Äôt even look that much older than us. I am so going to love getting into his pants.‚Äù She smirked as she adjusted her boobs. ‚ÄúSuch whores.‚Äù Summer snorted and I snorted out a laugh. ‚ÄúExcuse you! No one was talking to you or asked for your opinion. You and the invisible girl need to mind your own business.‚Äù She spit back at us. ‚ÄúI can say whatever I want.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the one telling the whole class what you‚Äôre THINKING will happen. I‚Äôm not here to listen to your wanna be conquests. This is not a dating service; this is a place of higher education. If you‚Äôre just here to find your mate, then I think you‚Äôre in the wrong place.‚Äù Summer coolly said. Wait?! Did Summer just say mate? This is the second time I‚Äôve heard that word MATE, is it like the Australian people use the word MATE. I‚Äôll have to remember to ask her about that later. ‚ÄúOh puh-lease, you‚Äôre just jealous.‚Äù The girl said looking at her manicured fingers. ‚ÄúWe can get any guy we want anytime we want.‚Äù She bragged. Summer snorted so hard that she blew her coffee out her nose. ‚ÄúMe jealous? Of you?‚Äù Summer snorted wiping her face. Storm couldn‚Äôt help but laugh at the whole situation and when she finally got herself together she said, ‚ÄúYeah sure, keep telling yourself that Barbie doll. The only guys you will get are little boys, not MEN.‚Äù Summer said.

I was still giggling when the most amazing scent hit my nose, sandalwood, and fresh cut grass. A small, low whimper escaped my lips, OH DAMN. I hoped that no one heard that. I looked towards the door where the scent was coming from. Oh, my dear heavenly skittles, it‚Äôs him, the Greek God I bumped into this morning. He lifted his nose like he is sniffing the air and looked around, his eyes shifted to pitch black as we locked eyes. We stared at each other for a few seconds before he broke eye contact licking his bottom lip. All I could feel was a shiver run down my spine. Why didn‚Äôt his scent hit me earlier? I have no idea what‚Äôs going on but whatever it is, I can‚Äôt‚Ä¶ let myself have feelings for anyone. Fred will kill him and me. ‚ÄúHey. you, okay?‚Äù Summer nudged me. ‚ÄúHuh? Yeah, I‚Äôm good.‚Äù I said, feeling my face blush. ‚ÄúLooks like someone has the hots for the teacher.‚Äù Summer sniggered. The girl behind us leaned into my ear and said, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt even think about it, he‚Äôs mine. Besides, why would he want a nobody like you? He‚Äôs not gonna want to be stuck with a single mom with three little monsters.‚Äù I could feel my anger rising, my jaw clenched, and my hands balled into tight fists. I was ready to beat the shit outta this skank, she needs to stay away from him. Before I could do anything else, I felt a presence next to me. ‚ÄúIs there a problem, ladies?‚Äù He asked in his smooth and husky voice, for some reason, just the sound of his voice helped calm and soothe me. How is that even possible? ‚ÄúNo, no problem prof.‚Äù Summer commented glaring at the girls behind her. ‚ÄúWell, please be respectful in my class ladies. This classroom will be treated as a professional work atmosphere just as if you are in an actual business setting.‚Äù He said but more to the skanks sitting behind us. ‚ÄúI would hate to hafta treat you like children but I‚Äôm going to ask you two to take seats on the other side of the room.‚Äù I started to gather my things. ‚ÄúNo, not you two but the two behind you.‚Äù He said motioning to the skanks. ‚ÄúWhat?! Why?!‚Äù Skank number one asked with surprise. ‚ÄúBut, but‚Ä¶‚Äù She stammered out. ‚ÄúPlease, go take your new seats, we need to get class started. And those will be your regular seats from now on.‚Äù He announced. ‚ÄúThe seats you are in will be your assigned seats and the person to your right will be your assigned partner. If no one is sitting next to you or you don‚Äôt have a partner by the end of class, see me during my office hours.‚Äù He said as he made his way down to the podium. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve never had assigned seats!‚Äù Skank one grumbled. ‚ÄúWell, this is my class now, and I assign seats.‚Äù He told her raising an eyebrow at her. 

Chapter 4

Summer chuckled and sent a small wave bye to them. I took my seat, and I could feel him watching me from the corner of his eye. I would steal a few glances at him and the last time I did, he caught me, he smiled and threw a quick wink at me. Oh, cheese and crackers, my panties are in trouble. I can‚Äôt let this happen! Fred would kill me; he‚Äôs never going to let me go. He‚Äôs already told me, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve NEVER been on a date. I don‚Äôt even want to think about what would happen, who would take care of the triplets. I have to stay away from him, somehow. I just don‚Äôt know how or if I can do that, I‚Äôm drawn to him, but I have no idea why? He started his lecture, but I wasn‚Äôt really listening, I‚Äôm glad that I had a small recorder set up. I was so caught up in my own thoughts, the what if‚Äôs, the can not‚Äôs, the why can‚Äôt my life be different, why couldn‚Äôt I have a normal family life. Am I ever going to be happy? Am I ever going to fall in love and have a family of my own? What about my siblings, will they grow up happy? Or will they be condemned to a life of hell with Fred and our mom.

Yeah, some mother she is. After my dad died, she lost it. I was ten when my dad died, my world fell apart and I thought that my mom and me would get through it together, but she would go out and be gone for hours and then eventually she‚Äôd be gone for days at a time. I knew right then and there that I was on my own. Nancy packed us up the day after dad‚Äôs funeral and we moved to some decrepit house across the country so, I had no other family to turn to, I had to grow up quickly. A few months later mom came home and told me that she‚Äôs pregnant and the father of the baby would be living with them. He just had to be near his child and his female, as he called her. Mom was never the same after she got together with Fred, it‚Äôs like she was under some spell of his that wouldn‚Äôt let her go. We had no idea that she was having triplets until the day they were born. They were squishy little things, but I fell in love with them immediately. They were my family, and I was never going to let anything happen to them.

‚ÄúStorm. Hey hello. Earth to Stormie.‚Äù I heard Summer as she snapped her fingers in front of my face. ‚ÄúHuh, what?‚Äù I said coming out of my daze. ‚ÄúWhere did you go?‚Äù She chuckled. ‚ÄúSorry. Just getting lost in my own thoughts.‚Äù I shrugged. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been told that I‚Äôm a pretty good listener.‚Äù She says with a comforting smile. ‚ÄúThanks, but I don‚Äôt want to burden you with my problems.‚Äù I shrugged my shoulders. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a bother. It‚Äôll be good to let it all out. If you let it sit and fester, you may end up snapping and then you will be committed, and I would have to break you out and we would be on the run with your three little monsters. Way too much drama so, let‚Äôs just grab lunch at the caf√© and talk.‚Äù She suggested with a chuckle. I let out a small snort. I know she meant nothing bad when she called the triplets little monsters. ‚ÄúUh, no, not the caf√©. I had a rather embarrassing moment there.‚Äù I scrunch my nose. Summer giggled. ‚ÄúWhen and where do you not have an embarrassing moment?‚Äù She snickered. ‚ÄúHey.‚Äù I laughed, nudging Summer with my elbow. ‚ÄúExcuse me, Miss‚Ä¶‚Äù I looked up and low and behold it‚Äôs my Greek God. I was at a loss of words, ‚Äúwholly shitzu! What‚Äôs my name? I can‚Äôt remember my name!‚Äù I heard muffled laughing in the back of mind. After a few seconds, I finally remembered my name and found my voice, maybe. ‚ÄúS-Storm, m-my n-name is S-St-Storm Hawk.‚Äù I stuttered out as Summer continued to cover her mouth trying not to laugh at me as I shoot her a death glare. ‚ÄúWell, Storm, please give me a few minutes, I would like to speak with you.‚Äù He said, giving me a small smile. I swallowed the big lump that formed in my throat. ‚ÄúUuumm...o-okay.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know what to say, all I wanted to do was run and hide. ‚ÄúOkay then, I will go grab our lunch and meet you in the quad.‚Äù Summer said flashing me a mischievous grin, giving me two thumbs up and wiggling her brows. I shook my head and rolled my eyes at her as she made her way out of the room. ‚ÄúExcuse me, Mr.‚Ä¶, I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt get your name.‚Äù Her shrill voice brought me back to attention making me cringe. ‚ÄúActually, I don‚Äôt think I gave my name.‚Äù He said keeping a close eye on me. ‚ÄúOh, well anyway, I wanted to invite you for a drink to apologize for my earlier behavior.‚Äù Skank said, giving me a snide smile. ‚ÄúActually, I think you owe Ms. Hawk and the rest of the class an apology for your behavior and taking up their class time. Not to mention for calling her children‚Ä¶‚Äù he looked at me and squinted ‚Äú‚Ä¶little monsters. Do you know them? Do you know for a fact that they are little monsters?‚Äù He scolded her like I would the triplets. I couldn‚Äôt help myself, but I threw a smirk at the skank. I couldn‚Äôt believe I just did that; I‚Äôve never done that before; it would usually end up with me being slapped across the face. Fred would definitely punish me if he found out. So as quickly as the smirk appeared, it disappeared.""

Chapter 5

Besides she‚Äôs just the invisible girl, it‚Äôs not like she matters. She‚Äôs just a stupid, weak human.‚Äù She said standing closer to him rubbing his arm. I don‚Äôt know why but there was something in me that made me wanted to rip skanks arms off. I was jealous. No way! How can I be jealous over someone I doesn‚Äôt even know? I don‚Äôt even know his name. I narrowed my eyes at the skank. I wanted to say something, but I kept my mouth shut. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name?‚Äù He asked the skank sweetly. I want to vomit; this is disgusting. Skank gives him what I assume is supposed to be a seductive smile. ‚ÄúGwen Lloyd.‚Äù Skank said running her finger across her collar bone. Blahhhhhh, I just vomited in my mouth. ‚ÄúMs. Lloyd, first of all, dating a student is strictly forbidden, so that is going to be a NO to the drink. Second, you need to remove your hand from me, my mate will not appreciate the unwanted touching.‚Äù He said removing her hand from his arm. ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you just reject her and let me be the one to please you in ways she never could. I can drive you wild.‚Äù She whispered, well not really whisper because I heard her. She was as quiet as a bullhorn. I wished I hadn‚Äôt heard her though, whoever his mate is, she is one lucky girl. I assume, at this point, that mate means girlfriend, boyfriend, significant other. I‚Äôm so confused. I have no idea what alternate world I‚Äôve been thrown into.

I didn‚Äôt want to stay and continue to watch this, so I slowly turned and started to walk out of the room. ‚ÄúMs. Hawk, I need you to stay please. We have a few matters to discuss. Ms. Lloyd, please exit the room and I suggest that you drop this class and perhaps even find a new major that is more suited to your abilities.‚Äù Oh, crap! He didn‚Äôt just say that. She was angry, I could see it in her eyes. I guess no one has ever spoken to her like that. ‚ÄúHow dare you!!‚Äù She yelled. ‚ÄúYou will pay for this!‚Äù She said, slapping him and then stomping out. I wanted to run and soothe the spot she slapped but I had to stop myself. I felt bad, this was, after all, my fault. Now he‚Äôs going to get in trouble. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. I didn‚Äôt mean for any of this to happen.‚Äù I whispered. He gave me a confused look. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have anything to apologize for, you did nothing wrong, none of this is your fault. Besides, I won‚Äôt get in trouble.‚Äù He tried to assure me. ‚ÄúI have you as my witness that she was the one who threw herself at me and I politely declined.‚Äù He smiled. I shrugged. ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶yeah, just let me know if anyone needs to talk to me.‚Äù I told him. We were quiet for a few minutes. ‚ÄúMaybe I should go.‚Äù I walked to the door, before I could even put my hand on the doorknob, I was swiftly turned to face him and he had me caged in between his arms. He lowered his face to mine, his warm minty breath fanning against my lips. He leaned in close to my ear and I heard him inhale. ‚ÄúMmmmm, such a sweet scent, vanilla, and honeysuckle.‚Äù He whispered as he kissed the flesh in the crook of my neck. I had to bite my bottom lip to keep myself from releasing the moan that had built up. All I could do at this point was fist his shirt in my hands and close my eyes. I couldn‚Äôt move, I couldn‚Äôt run, not that I wanted to, all this felt so good and so right for some reason. As much as this felt right, I had to get away from him, I can‚Äôt get involved with anyone, especially not my instructor. ‚ÄúS-s-sir, p-p-please, l-l-l-let m-me g-g-go.‚Äù I was finally able to shutter out. 

Before I could say anything else, a male voice yelled from the top of the lecture hall, ‚ÄúBlas√©, c‚Äômon let‚Äôs‚Ä¶ Silas, you shit, get out!‚Äù My instructor, who I know now, his name is Blas√©. This Silas guy came bouncing down the stairs. ‚ÄúDude‚Ä¶oh shit! Sorry, didn‚Äôt know you were giving private tutoring.‚Äù He grinned. ‚ÄúSilas! If you don‚Äôt get outta here, you‚Äôre not walking out of here on your own.‚Äù Blas√© said sounding angry. He released his grip enough for me to open the door and I high tailed it outta there. ‚ÄúStorm! Wait, please come back.‚Äù He shouted at me for me to stop. There was no way I was going to stop. I ran out of there making my way to the quad, I needed to find Summer. ‚ÄúHey Stormie! Over here.‚Äù Summer call out. I made my way over to where she was sitting. ‚ÄúHey Summer.‚Äù I said still trying to catch my breath. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about time, I thought you forgot about me.‚Äù She frowned at me. ‚ÄúSorry, I got held up.‚Äù I told her. ‚ÄúI bet you did.‚Äù She giggled and winked at me. ‚ÄúHere eat, you look a little pale.‚Äù She said handing me my lunch. I took the bag that held a roast beef sandwich, chips, and tea. I was actually pretty hungry; I didn‚Äôt get a chance to have breakfast because of my little fiasco this morning. We sat in silence for a while, I was lost in my thoughts over the events of earlier. ‚ÄúHow could this be happening? I‚Äôm so confused.‚Äù I whispered to myself thinking no one could hear me. ‚ÄúHow could what happen? What are you confused about Mimi?‚Äù She asked looking at me with true concern.

‚ÄúWait? What?‚Äù I stared at her. ‚ÄúDid you just call me Mimi?‚Äù She shrugged her shoulders. ‚ÄúYeah. I like it, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù She asked a little sad. ‚ÄúNo one has ever given me a nickname before.‚Äù I smiled. ‚ÄúWell, you have one now. So, tell me what happened that had you running here like your ass was on fire?‚Äù She asked giving me a warm concerned smile. 

Chapter 6

The skank huffed. ‚ÄúThat is not going to happen. I do not apologize to anyone for anything. I took a deep breath. ‚ÄúThis is going to sound absolutely crazy but what is a mate?‚Äù Her eyes went a little wide. ‚ÄúI heard you mention it earlier and well‚Ä¶‚Äù I paused; Summer motioned for me to continue. ‚ÄúI bumped into our instructor this morning when I was running out of the caf√©. When he looked at me, he said, Mate - Mine.‚Äù I explained. ‚ÄúAnd what did you do?‚Äù She asked biting into her food. ‚ÄúI freaked out and ran, then you found me on the ground.‚Äù I stopped again taking a drink of my tea and then looking around. I wanted to make sure that no one was listening. Summer sat quietly waiting for me to continue. ‚ÄúAfter you left, Gwen the skank.‚Äù I said her name with disgust. ‚ÄúBasically, threw herself at him, it was, she was gross. He told her it was against school policy and that she needed to stop touching him because his mate wouldn‚Äôt appreciate her touching him. He told her to leave, find another major. After she left, pretty pissed off, I might add. I tried to leave but he pinned me to the door and he‚Ä¶he sniffed me. He said I smelled like vanilla and honeysuckle and then he started kissing my neck. I finished scrunching my face. I have no idea what is happening, as freaked out as I was, it felt good and so right. Like I‚Äôm supposed to be with him, but I have no idea what a mate is, and I have NO idea who he is. He said his mate wouldn‚Äôt appreciate her touching him but yet he pinned me to the door and was kissing on me!‚Äù I whisper-yelled. ‚ÄúSo, how was the kiss?‚Äù Summer asked with a huge grin. ‚ÄúSummer!!! That‚Äôs all you got outta what I just said?‚Äù I scolded her. ‚ÄúOh, and what the hell is a MATE?‚Äù I whispered-yelled glaring at her.

‚ÄúStorm!! Get your fat ass over here NOW!‚Äù I froze in fear as his familiar voice filled my ears. ‚ÄúFred? What are you doing here?‚Äù I asked him with my eyes wide with fear as he stalked towards me. Summer stood closer to me. ‚ÄúMimi, are you okay? Who is he?‚Äù She asked. ‚ÄúYou were supposed to be home for lunch! Did you forget we were having guests over? Do you have any idea the embarrassment you caused your mother having to order take out?‚Äù He yelled grabbing my wrist tightly, his nails digging into my skin. I winced in pain. ‚ÄúI left the food in the fridge, all she had to do was put it in the oven for twenty minutes.‚Äù I told him trying to free my now bleeding wrist trying not to make eye contact with him. ‚ÄúThat wasn‚Äôt good enough! Your mother threw it out! She said it wasn‚Äôt even worthy of feeding to a wild animal.‚Äù He was now holding me by my collar. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not my problem! I made what she asked for, if she wanted something different then she should have made it herself!‚Äù I gritted out. I knew the second those words left my mouth, punishment was going to rain down hard on me and of all places, here at school for everyone to see. Next thing I know the side of my face was stinging. I could hear Summer yelling at him. ‚ÄúGet away from her asshole. Don‚Äôt touch her again!‚Äù She growled as his fist came down on me again and again, I fell to the ground, and he started kicking me in the ribs, stomach and anywhere else he could get to. ‚ÄúMind your own business bitch or you‚Äôll be next!‚Äù He growled at her. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to see you try and she is my business!‚Äù Summer snarled back. ‚ÄúSummer, please stop, it‚Äôs okay.‚Äù I whimpered to her.

‚ÄúGET YOUR HANDS OFF HER!!‚Äù I heard someone roar. I tried to crawl away from Fred, but he stomped on my shoulder bring me to a stop as I heard a popping sound. I looked up trying to see what was happening. I heard scuffling, yelps, growls, and grunts. What was going on? I saw Fred thrown to the ground a few feet away from me. He was covered in blood and was a crumpled mess lying next to me. Who did that to him? My vision was starting to blur but I could see a bunch of feet circling around Fred. I just want to curl up in my bed and not come out. ‚ÄúOh, my Goddess, Mimi. What did he do to you?‚Äù Summer gasped. ‚ÄúBlas√©! Get over here, NOW!‚Äù She yelled out. Why is she calling for him? How does she know his name? Does she know him? ‚ÄúMy head is killing me.‚Äù I mumbled. I tried to get up. ‚ÄúI have to get my little ones. They‚Äôre going to be so worried about me.‚Äù I said but I felt myself stumble and before I hit the ground again, a pair of warm arms caught me. I could feel sparks where his fingers touched me. I couldn‚Äôt help but nuzzle closer to him. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay my love. I got you. You‚Äôre safe. He will never hurt you again, no one will hurt you.‚Äù He whispered. Before I faded into darkness, I said, ‚ÄúTriplets.‚Äù

‚ÄúTriplets?‚Äù I repeated looking at Summer. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right, that skank referred to some little monsters.‚Äù Summer said turning towards me. ‚ÄúShe has kids. Three of them?‚Äù I said out loud cradling her in my arms. ‚ÄúSummer go check the day care, maybe they go there. If so, take them back to the pack house, maybe they‚Äôll know what‚Äôs going on and what happened to their mom.‚Äù Summer nodded and sprinted to the daycare center. ‚ÄúBlas√©, what do we do with him? The human authorities are leaving him to us.‚Äù Silas informed. ‚ÄúTake him to the cells, have doc ready also, see what you can find out about my mate and her family.‚Äù I ordered him getting into the back seat of my car still holding my mate. Yes, I have personal driver. ‚ÄúRobbie, get us back to the pack house quickly.‚Äù I demanded. ‚ÄúYou got it boss.‚Äù He quickly but carefully got us to the pack hospital.

‚ÄúAlpha, this way, I have a room ready for her.‚Äù The doctor in charge stated. I followed the doctor into one of the private rooms. 

Chapter 7

‚ÄúWhat happened to her?‚Äù The doc asked examining Storm. ‚ÄúShe has bruises upon bruises!‚Äù She exclaimed. ‚ÄúPoor child who would do this to her?‚Äù She looked at me with tears in her eyes. ‚ÄúIt was her so-called father.‚Äù I told her grinding my teeth. I felt the doctor put her hand on my shoulder. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôll be okay. I‚Äôll run some tests, get some scans, give her fluids, pain medicine, some antibiotics and let her rest; she must be a strong one for her to endure all these injuries.‚Äù She tried to assure me. ‚ÄúBlas√©, I have the triplets.‚Äù Summer mind linked. ‚ÄúThey are scared and are crying for Storm. Also, she‚Äôs their sister not mom. She‚Äôs the one who has cares for them, her mom and Fred, well I think you can figure it out.‚Äù She sighed. ‚ÄúWhere are you?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúI need to make sure they‚Äôre okay, siblings or kids, it‚Äôs all the same to me, I will protect her and them. They are my family now. I‚Äôll be there in a few minutes.‚Äù I told her. I looked over at my still sleeping, well, unconscious mate. How could anyone treat her like this. I could feel the anger and rage build. I moved closer to her, kneeled down, and inhaled her scent, her scent calmed me and my beast. ‚ÄúBlas√©, son.‚Äù My mom‚Äôs voice sounded in the room. She was standing next to me with a frown on her face. My mom is the best, she‚Äôs always been there for me and my siblings, the twins, Silas, and Summer. ‚ÄúSon, you need to come to the house and eat.‚Äù She softly said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been here for over four hours; her little ones are so worried about her.‚Äù ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt leave her mom. Every time I try to get up to leave, my legs get heavy and won‚Äôt move. She needs me. She doesn‚Äôt even know me mom! He never presented her to the pack! I don‚Äôt even know how long she‚Äôs been here.‚Äù I growled. ‚ÄúShe does need you and always will, but you need to keep your strength up or you won‚Äôt be any good to her or those cute little pups of hers.‚Äù She smiled as she said the last part. ‚ÄúYou met them?‚Äù I looked up at her. ‚ÄúYes, they are such sweet little angels. They are also very worried about her, she‚Äôs very important to them. It seems that her love is all they‚Äôve ever had. You should spend some time with them, they could use your assurance.‚Äù She said patting my shoulder. 

‚ÄúAs soon as the doctor comes back with news, I‚Äôll go check on them.‚Äù She kissed the top of my head and left me alone with my mate. I traced my fingers along her jawline, gently rubbing each black and blue mark on her face with each touch, sparks tickled the tips of my fingers. I think she felt the sparks also because her heart rate would spike a little bit and she would softly sigh. ‚ÄúAlpha.‚Äù The doctor called getting my attention. ‚ÄúWhat did you find?‚Äù I was able to croak out. She sighed. ‚ÄúShe has a lot of healed fractures; her ribs have been broken on several occasions. She also has a small fracture along her left cheek, I may have to wire it shut for a week or so. I will need to keep an eye on it and see how it looks over the next day or two. Hopefully it should heal with no problem just make sure on one hit‚Äôs her again.‚Äù I snorted. ‚ÄúNo one will ever touch her like that again!‚Äù I growled. ‚ÄúI know, please try to stay calm. I‚Äôm sorry. I didn‚Äôt mean‚Ä¶‚Äù He started to say. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay. I understand.‚Äù She smiled at me. ‚ÄúHow long does she need to stay here?‚Äù I asked still watching my mate. ‚ÄúAs soon as she wakes, I want to make sure there are no other unseen issues.‚Äù She advised. ‚ÄúAlpha, you should go eat and get some rest. I‚Äôll call you if there are changes.‚Äù Dr. Reese told me. ‚ÄúThe second she opens her eyes, no matter what time or what I am doing.‚Äù I demanded of her. ‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù She agreed. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôll also need for you to check her three siblings.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhere are they?‚Äù ‚ÄúThey are at the pack house, my mom has been looking after them, so you‚Äôll need to get by her.‚Äù I chuckled. ‚ÄúOh dear.‚Äù She mumbled to herself. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll bring them by to visit there sister and you can give them a checkup then.‚Äù I suggested to her. ‚ÄúThank you, that will work.‚Äù She said a little relieved. ‚ÄúMom is very protective of those she considers her babies and I think these three new little ones are falling into that category.‚Äù I sighed and rubbed my face. I want her with me, by my side, in my bed, our bed. I‚Äôve been searching for her since I was sixteen. ‚ÄúFather must die for hurting little mate!‚Äù My wolf grumbled. ‚ÄúI will deal with him.‚Äù I told him. My wolf was ready to tear Fred apart earlier, if Summer hadn‚Äôt called me over, Fred would be dead. ‚ÄúHe should be dead.‚Äù My wolf growled at me. I leaned down and placed a kiss on her cheek. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be back later, my love. I promise. I‚Äôm going to go check on our pups, they‚Äôre worried about you. You need to come back to them, to me, please. I‚Äôve finally found you; I can‚Äôt lose you the same day I found you.‚Äù I whispered in her ear. I felt her shiver a little. I smiled and kissed her again before I walked out."" ",1,1749411675.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False
1l6kwu9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1l6kwu9/rusty_rangers_fantastica_action_platformer_and/,Rusty Rangers - Fantastica!- Action platformer and roguelike with elements of metroidvania in which I dream to honor the retro games of the 80's. Development has been done for over 5 years by one person,"I‚Äôve been working on this project solo for over 5 years now - mostly at night, after my day job. What‚Äôs kept me going is a mix of stubbornness, coffee, and a deep love for old-school action games. Today, I‚Äôm finally ready to show what I‚Äôve been building all this time.

Steam: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/1599420/Rusty\_Rangers/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1599420/Rusty_Rangers/)  
Trailer: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNpbGiLk0A8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNpbGiLk0A8) 

The story takes place in a world no one remembers anymore. Reality has changed - consumed by chaos and madness. Creatures that were once harmless now bring destruction, and the land itself constantly shifts, erasing everything familiar and stable.

You play as one of the few remaining rangers - each with their own combat style and unique abilities. Your goal is to track down the source of the madness, face terrifying enemies, and try to restore balance to a world on the edge.

I‚Äôve tried to combine dynamic, classic 2D gameplay (run, jump, shoot) with modern elements and a story that unfolds with each new run. You‚Äôll meet characters, take on quests, and make choices that can affect how things play out.

The visuals are all done in pixel art, drawn by hand. Every background, animation, and creature was crafted frame by frame - I wanted the art style to feel personal and just a little strange (in the best way possible).

There‚Äôs a free demo available now, and it would mean a lot to me if you gave it a try. Any feedback - positive, critical, or just honest - is incredibly valuable.

Also, one question - what‚Äôs the most memorable boss fight you‚Äôve ever played? I‚Äôm obsessed with boss design and would love to hear your stories.

If you enjoy the demo, adding it to your wishlist would be a huge help. But honestly, even just a comment here is already amazing support.

BEYOND THE HORIZON

Most kids are scared of monsters under the bed or ghosts in the closet. I was scared of something else‚Äîsomething bigger. Death.
Not the kind you see in cartoons or hear about in bedtime stories. The real kind. The kind that makes people cry in kitchens and whisper behind closed doors.
But even though I didn‚Äôt understand everything yet, I knew one thing: you can‚Äôt run from it.
So why does everyone act like you can?

That morning, the sunlight spilled through the car window, warming my knees as we drove. I leaned my head against the glass, watching the trees blur into smudges of green and gold. The wind outside whooshed like a secret.

‚ÄúKavanna, you know how I feel about seatbelts. Buckle up, please,‚Äù Mama said gently, though I could hear the worry hiding in her voice.

‚ÄúYes, ma‚Äôam,‚Äù I said, my fingers fumbling with the buckle. The strap clicked into place across my chest. It always felt too big on me, like the world.

‚ÄúWill we see Daddy before we leave for Nookum‚Äôs?‚Äù I asked, keeping my eyes on the road ahead.

‚ÄúYes, my love,‚Äù Mama smiled. ‚ÄúNani is waiting for us. We‚Äôll stop at home first.‚Äù

My parents had known each other forever. They were kids together, teenagers in love, the kind of couple that grew up side by side like vines twisting up the same fence. Sometimes, I felt like I was chasing a piece of that love I hadn‚Äôt caught yet.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad he‚Äôll see us off,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWill Aunty Gauri and Anshka be there already?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre about thirty minutes behind us. We‚Äôll have time to finish packing before they arrive.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sad Daddy‚Äôs not coming this time. Nookum misses him.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe promises to come next year,‚Äù Mama said, her voice light but not entirely convincing. ‚ÄúThis trip is just us girls.‚Äù

We pulled into our driveway. The house sat under a canopy of maple trees, its shutters blinking in the sunlight. Koko, our housekeeper and nanny, opened the front door before we even got out of the car. Her wide arms stretched out like wings.

‚ÄúGood evening, Mrs. Flee. And good evening to you, little Flee,‚Äù she said, scooping me up with a laugh.

‚ÄúGood evening, Koko! Will you miss us while we‚Äôre gone? I wish you could come,‚Äù I said, nuzzling into her shoulder.

‚ÄúIf I left, who would keep Mr. Flee from walking out the door with mismatched socks and no breakfast?‚Äù she grinned.

‚ÄúKeep his head on straight? What does that mean?‚Äù I asked.

Mama chuckled. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a saying, my love.‚Äù

‚ÄúKoko, would you mind helping Vanna finish her packing? I need a word with Micah.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course, Mrs. Flee,‚Äù she said, taking my hand as we made our way up the wooden stairs.

Mama called out softly as she passed the library, ‚ÄúChu‚Äôa, where are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúIn here, my dear,‚Äù came my father‚Äôs voice.

They embraced in the doorframe, like puzzle pieces slipping back into place.

‚ÄúI wish you were coming with us,‚Äù Mama whispered.

‚ÄúI wish I could too. But these new clients are important.‚Äù

‚ÄúMore important than your daughter and your mother-in-law?‚Äù she asked, arching an eyebrow.

He laughed gently. ‚ÄúNothing is more important. But these clients might finally give us the financial security I promised you.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe already have what we need. Family is the real wealth.‚Äù

He cupped her cheek. ‚ÄúI want to give you the world. And Vanna, too. You both deserve it on a silver platter.‚Äù

Before she could respond, a car door slammed outside. Mama glanced out the window.

‚ÄúGauri‚Äôs early,‚Äù she said, half amused.

‚ÄúHello, sister! How are you today?‚Äù Aunt Gauri called out as she stepped inside with Cousin Anshka close behind.

‚ÄúI‚Äôd be better if my husband hadn‚Äôt gotten our mother all worked up this morning,‚Äù Mama said dryly.

‚ÄúAnshka, say hello to Tete and find Vanna upstairs,‚Äù Aunt Gauri said.

‚ÄúHi, Tete! VANNA! Wanna play?!‚Äù Anshka called, her voice bouncing up the staircase.

She burst into my room with all the energy of a summer storm.

‚ÄúHey Anshka, how are you?‚Äù I smiled.

‚ÄúGood! Your toys are so cool,‚Äù she said, already pulling a doll from the shelf.

Koko smiled. ‚ÄúMiss Vanna will play shortly. We‚Äôre almost done packing.‚Äù

While she spoke, I watched Anshka twirl through my room. I had everything‚Äîa dollhouse, tents, a pretend kitchen, a mountain of stuffed animals. But no siblings. No other kids to share it with.

Except once a year, when we went to the reservation.

I hugged a plush bear to my chest as Daddy walked in.

‚ÄúVanna, do you really need all these stuffed animals?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúYes, sir. It‚Äôs only six,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúOne of them is the size of a small car. Where did that Sonic even come from?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe fair,‚Äù I giggled. ‚ÄúI won him. He‚Äôs like my roommate.‚Äù

The sun was beginning to dip behind the trees as Daddy zipped the final bag and carried it out to the RV parked along the side of the house. He wasn‚Äôt coming with us, but he helped load everything anyway, making sure it was all just right. From the open window, our laughter drifted down, mingling with birdsong and breeze.

Inside, Mama‚Äôs voice floated through the house: ‚ÄúDinner‚Äôs ready!‚Äù

That evening, we all gathered in the dining room. The golden light of the setting sun filtered through the windows, casting long shadows on the table. The air smelled like sage and home. Mama had made *siksik√°√≠ttsisskim* again‚ÄîBlackfoot stew with bison, carrots, and prairie herbs. Flatbread warmed in a basket beside us, filling the space with the scent of flour and warmth.

Daddy sat at the head of the table, quietly listening as we chatted about tomorrow‚Äôs trip. He wouldn‚Äôt be coming with us, but he looked content just being there, watching us plan and dream.

Anshka and I were already arguing over where we‚Äôd sleep in the RV.

‚ÄúI want the top bunk,‚Äù she said, reaching for a piece of flatbread.

‚ÄúYou had it last year,‚Äù I countered. ‚ÄúAnd I get carsick if I sleep near the back.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe could take turns,‚Äù Mama suggested gently, her eyes smiling.

‚ÄúFine,‚Äù Anshka mumbled. ‚ÄúBut I get first pick of snacks.‚Äù

‚ÄúDeal,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm in charge of music. We‚Äôre starting with Fleetwood Mac.‚Äù

‚ÄúEw, why? I was going to play Dua Lipa!‚Äù

‚ÄúTake turns,‚Äù Mama said, passing the bread. ‚ÄúWe have twelve hours to drive.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll even have time for your dad‚Äôs old people music,‚Äù Daddy teased.

We laughed and passed bowls and shared stories we‚Äôd heard a dozen times. I memorized every piece of it‚ÄîMama‚Äôs voice, Daddy‚Äôs grin, Anshka‚Äôs fire.

I didn‚Äôt know it then, but that dinner was a forever kind of moment. One that would echo long after the plates were cleared.

That night, the house was quiet in the way only night could make it. The dishes were done, lights were dimmed, and the air held that stillness just before sleep settles over everything. Mama and Daddy tucked me into bed, fluffing my pillow and tucking my favorite blanket beneath my chin.

‚ÄúCan I hear the story again?‚Äù I asked sleepily.

Daddy smiled and sat beside me, while Mama curled up at the edge of the bed. ‚ÄúJust once more,‚Äù she said, brushing a strand of hair from my forehead.

I closed my eyes and listened to the soft, warm voices of my parents as they told the story of how they met‚Äîtwo kids playing tag behind school buildings, growing up together, and falling in love under starlit skies. I never got tired of hearing it.

As their voices faded into the rhythm of memory, my eyelids grew heavy. The last thing I felt was Daddy kissing my forehead, and Mama whispering, ‚ÄúSweet dreams, my little bird.‚Äù

Down the hall, Aunt Gauri and Anshka curled up together in the guest room, sharing quiet laughter and whispers before falling asleep. Koko retreated to her nanny suite for the night, her footsteps soft as feathers on the hardwood.

And Mama and Daddy, hand in hand, slipped quietly into their room‚Äîthe door closing gently behind them like the end of a chapter.

Morning waited on the other side of sleep. The road, the reservation, and everything that came after.

But for now, the house held still. And the night held us all.

As I fell asleep to the hush of cicadas and the distant hoot of an owl. The world around me faded into the soft pulse of my own heartbeat‚Äîsteady, insistent, alive. Then the ordinary darkness melted away.

I found myself hovering above my sleeping form, weightless and untethered. The ceiling fan spun lazily beneath me, but my gaze was drawn upward, beyond walls and rooftops, into the vault of night. There, stars throbbed like drummers gathering for a ceremony, veins of starlight weaving constellations I half-recognized from stories.

A wind‚Äîneither hot nor cold‚Äîswept me over the trees, carrying whispers in a language I felt rather than heard. Leaves rustled encouragement; the moon carved a silver path across the sky. Soon, I was drifting down into a vast meadow, dew-patched grass caressing my bare feet, droplets like thousands of tiny bells.

In the center stood a circle of fire, ancient and welcoming. Flames danced up to kiss the sky, sending embers spiraling into constellations of their own. Around it, women formed a ring‚Äîeach a reflection of strength and tenderness. Their braided hair cascaded to the ground, adorned with feathers, beads, and strips of leather etched with symbols of journeys past.

Nookum emerged first, younger and wilder than I‚Äôd ever seen. Her eyes were embers themselves, fierce with remembrance. She extended a hand, calloused from decades of card games and storytelling.

‚ÄúCome home,‚Äù she whispered, and the words rippled through the air like a sacred drumbeat.

I approached, heart drumming in reply. As my foot touched the earth, the fire‚Äôs heat grounded me, a pulse through the soles of my feet. The circle shivered in greeting, and each woman nodded, inviting me into their dance.

The beat began softly‚Äîthump‚Ä¶ thump‚Ä¶ thump‚Äîrippling through the grass to my bones. Then louder, a collective heartbeat that rose with every step. I joined Nookum in the dance: heels and toes tapping, arms outstretched, bodies weaving patterns older than memory.

We circled the fire, then flung ourselves outward and back in, bodies arcing like comets drawn to the hearth. With every revolution, images flickered at the edge of my vision: a child‚Äôs laughter carried on the wind, a father‚Äôs warm hand on my shoulder, ancestors walking beside buffalo herds beneath endless skies.

By the final cadence, the world shattered into light. I was lifted again, hovering above the field, watching the circle burn down to embers that drifted back into the stars. Then, in a hush as deep as creation, I sank back into my body.

When I awoke, my chest hummed with the echo of a thousand drums, and my hair smelled of sweetgrass and cedar smoke. The real world crept back in‚Äîpillows, quilts, the gentle fluttering of curtains in the dawn breeze‚Äîbut I carried the fire within me.

I didn‚Äôt open my eyes. I didn‚Äôt need to.

I had been somewhere sacred.

And tomorrow, I would return.

When morning arrived, golden light spilled softly through the sheer curtains of my bedroom. I stirred slowly, still wrapped in the warmth of the dream. For a moment, I stayed perfectly still, holding onto the last echoes of Nookum‚Äôs voice and the drumbeat that had filled my heart.

I blinked at the ceiling, remembering how her hand had felt in mine. How the earth had hummed beneath my feet. It didn‚Äôt feel like just a dream‚Äîit felt like a calling, like I had already begun the journey before we‚Äôd even left.

Downstairs, the scent of fresh bread and brewed tea drifted upward, pulling me gently from bed. Mama was already packing a cooler, humming softly to herself as the morning sun lit up the kitchen. Aunt Gauri was organizing snacks into tidy little piles, and Anshka danced barefoot across the floor, still in her pajamas.

‚ÄúI had the weirdest dream,‚Äù I said, joining them.

‚ÄúOh?‚Äù Mama asked, glancing over her shoulder with a smile.

‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt weird-bad, just... old. Like I was somewhere I‚Äôd always known, even if I‚Äôd never been there before.‚Äù

Mama looked at me for a long, quiet moment, her eyes soft. ‚ÄúSometimes our spirits go ahead of us to prepare the path.‚Äù

I nodded. I believed her.

Outside, the RV waited, parked along the drive like a resting giant. Its windows reflected the rising sun. Today, it would carry us to the reservation‚Äîour sacred place. To the land where stories were still alive in the wind. To the arms of Nookum and the familiar rhythms of a life I only touched once a year.

My heart stirred, not with fear, but with readiness.

We were going home.

The sun had sunk low enough to turn the maple leaves into lanterns of gold and crimson before we finally climbed into the RV. But inside the house, time seemed to have slowed, as though it, too, was reluctant to let us go.

Mama‚Äôs footsteps were soft on the hardwood as she led us into the foyer. The cedar-scented hall hung heavy with memories‚Äîthe worn runner rug where I‚Äôd skidded on Christmas morning, the coat hooks where Daddy once hung my first-year backpack, the carved cedar bench where Koko had soothed my tears after my first solo recital. Each echo in that hallway tugged at my heart.

Anshka wore her travel hoodie‚Äîthe same one from last year, covered in patches and pins‚Äîand clutched her travel pillow like it was a teddy bear. I had my Sonic plush, my dream still echoing quietly in my chest like a heartbeat.

Daddy stood by the front door, arms crossed but shoulders squared, the flannel shirt he always wore crisp and familiar. His gaze drifted over each of us as though memorizing the curve of my mother‚Äôs cheek, the spark in Anshka‚Äôs eye, the way Koko held my hand.

‚ÄúAlright, girls,‚Äù Mama called, snapping the RV‚Äôs side door open, ‚Äúsay your goodbyes to the house.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúVanna,‚Äù he said, voice catching for just a heartbeat. He crouched to my eye level. ‚ÄúPromise me you‚Äôll look for beauty on this trip. Not just in places, but in moments‚Äîlike this one.‚Äù

I studied his face: the gentle furrow of his brow, the tiny scar above his right eyebrow from when he fell off his bike at six. ‚ÄúI promise,‚Äù I whispered, pressing my gaze into his.

He tucked a loose strand of my hair behind my ear. ‚ÄúAnd remember, home is a story we carry inside us, no matter how far the road takes us.‚Äù

Above us, a lone wind chime tinkled, as if punctuating his words. Behind him, Mama‚Äôs breath caught. She stepped forward then, wrapping both of us in a silent embrace that lingered until the chime finished its gentle song.

Mama kissed his cheek, her hand lingering at the back of his neck like she didn‚Äôt want to let go.

Koko hovered at the edge, her eyes bright, as she handed Anshka a pouch of snacks and kissed me on the forehead, then hugged me. Her apron smelled of ginger and peppermint‚Äîthe scents of every morning she greeted me with breakfast. ‚ÄúBring me back a piece of sky,‚Äù she murmured, pressing a small pouch of dried lavender into my hand. ‚ÄúTo dream with.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe always do,‚Äù I promised.

I nodded, tears stinging my own eyes. Anshka grasped my other hand, bouncing on her toes. ‚ÄúHurry back!‚Äù she called, then bounded up the RV steps before her words could settle.

With one last look at the porch swing‚Äîits cushion worn from years of summer evenings‚ÄîI climbed aboard. Mama followed, slamming the door shut behind her. The engine‚Äôs rumble was a promise and a farewell all at once.

Then the RV doors closed, the engine rumbled to life, and the driveway slipped away behind us. The trees waved gently like old friends, and the horizon stretched forward in dusty gold.

We were on our way.

The drive from Maine to West Virginia spanned miles and moods. We followed long stretches of pine-flanked roads, winding highways, and misty mountains that felt like sleeping giants. The scenery shifted from the cool, rugged coastline of home to rolling hills and green valleys as we made our way south. The trees grew taller, thicker, and richer in color the farther we traveled, their canopies painting shadows across the RV‚Äôs windows.

Our first stop was a little gas station just outside of Concord, New Hampshire. Mama let us stretch our legs while she fueled up and cleaned the windshield. Anshka and I ran laps around a patch of grass, giggling and pretending we were wild horses.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go too far!‚Äù Mama called from the RV, wiping her hands on a napkin. ‚ÄúBathroom in ten!‚Äù

Inside, the gas station smelled like old coffee and cinnamon buns. Anshka begged for a plastic-wrapped muffin and I picked out apple juice. Mama bought us a pack of gum and a fresh thermos of coffee for herself.

Back on the road, I watched the clouds roll like slow-moving waves overhead. We crossed into Massachusetts with the sound of Stevie Nicks playing from the RV speakers.

‚ÄúShe sounds like a ghost,‚Äù Anshka said, chewing gum with her head leaned against the window.

‚ÄúShe sounds like magic,‚Äù I replied, tapping my fingers along to the beat.
Somewhere just past Hartford, our hunger and an ache for solid ground led us to Cowbell Diner‚Äîa roadside haven with a hand-painted sign of a rooster strutting atop a silo. From the moment we stepped inside, the air was thick with the scent of frying bacon, strong coffee, and the sweet stickiness of maple syrup.

The booths were vinyl and cracked, each one bearing stories in its grooves. A neon sign flashed ‚ÄúOpen 24 Hours,‚Äù though it looked the sort that might close any minute without warning. We slid into a corner booth framed by windows fogged from kitchen heat.

Our waitress approached‚Äîa woman with rolled-up denim sleeves, silver hair pulled back into a braid, and eyes like chipped turquoise. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôll it be, dearies?‚Äù she asked, voice warm as fresh biscuits.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll have the blueberry pie a la mode,‚Äù I said, barely glancing at the menu. ‚ÄúAnd extra syrup.‚Äù

Anshka chimed in, ‚ÄúGrilled cheese and curly fries, please!‚Äù

Mama ordered scrambled eggs with chives and a side of bison sausage. Aunt Gauri chose the pancake sampler‚Äîthree motorcycles stacked with buttermilk cakes.

While we waited, Anshka fidgeted with the sugar packets. ‚ÄúDo you think fry bread tastes like pancakes?‚Äù she wondered aloud.

‚ÄúSort of,‚Äù I said, tearing open a pack. ‚ÄúBut fry bread is crispy on the edges, soft in the middle. It‚Äôs like a hug in your mouth.‚Äù

Mama laughed and reached across to squeeze my hand. ‚ÄúMaybe Nookum will teach us how to make it,‚Äù she said, stirring her coffee.

Our plates arrived in a clatter‚Äîsteam curling off the pie, cheese strings stretching from sandwich to plate, sausage sizzling on the edge of Mama‚Äôs plate. We ate slowly, savoring each bite as though it were a prayer.

Between mouthfuls, we traded stories. 

‚ÄúI made a diorama of the rainforest!‚Äù she announced, reaching under the table for an imaginary shoebox. ‚ÄúThere are sugar-glider sugar packets for leaves and play-dough frogs that I sculpted myself. My teacher loved it so much she hung it right by the window.‚Äù

Across from her, Aunt Gauri lifted a forkful of pancakes and grinned at Mama. ‚ÄúSpeaking of gravity, Wyn, remind me again how you keep those stacks from toppling? Do you secretly glue them together?‚Äù

Mama laughed, fingertips brushing the syrup pool on her plate. ‚ÄúOh, come on‚Äîit‚Äôs all about the pan temperature and quick flip. But last night I nearly sent one flying into the ceiling fan.‚Äù

Gauri wiped her fingertip on her napkin. ‚ÄúI need that recipe. My pancakes fall flatter than my last Tinder date‚Äôs jokes.‚Äù

Mama winked. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll show you‚Äîassuming you promise not to judge my syrup technique.‚Äù

In the middle of the teasing, Mama‚Äôs eyes softened. ‚ÄúGuess what I saw in the garden the other morning?‚Äù she said, voice low with excitement. ‚ÄúA hummingbird nest tucked under the lilac bush. There were two speckled eggs‚Äîtiny as jellybeans. I‚Äôm keeping watch so I don‚Äôt scare them away.‚Äù

I listened to the bubbling warmth of their chatter, feeling it settle around me like a familiar quilt. I traced the rim of my coffee cup, thinking of Nookum‚Äôs laughter‚Äîdeep and rolling like thunder over the prairie‚Äîand the steady drumbeat that would greet us at sunrise.

When Anshka finished her story, she leaned back and sighed. ‚ÄúI wish we were already there.‚Äù

I nodded, the hum of anticipation in my chest growing louder. ‚ÄúSoon,‚Äù I said, and let my mind drift ahead to the crackle of the morning fire and the first drumbeat calling our names.

When we finally pushed away from the table, our bellies full and our spirits refueled, the waitress pressed a small paper bag into my hand. ‚ÄúTake some biscuits with you‚Äîextras, just because.‚Äù

I looked up, surprised. ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù

She winked. ‚ÄúSafe travels, little ones.‚Äù

When the sky turned violet, we passed into Pennsylvania, and Mama switched places with Aunt Gauri so she could nap in the back. Anshka and I sprawled out on the fold-down couch, playing cards and whispering stories until we both nodded off.

I woke up somewhere in the Allegheny Mountains. The RV moved like a cradle, and I could see the moon out the side window‚Äîround and calm, following us like a watchful eye. Mama had taken the wheel again, and her hum drifted like a lullaby through the dark.

It was quiet, but not empty. There was something sacred about those hours‚Äîtraveling across land that had known our people long before us.

Outside, the sun dipped low, casting long shadows on the parking lot. Through the steamy windows, the rooster statue stood sentinel, as if wishing us well.

Back in the RV, the biscuits nestled next to my Sonic plush. The engine turned over, and the road called again.

The RV‚Äôs tires hummed against the asphalt as the sun dipped low, painting the sky in bruised purples and molten gold. Through the windshield, the blue-and-white ‚ÄúWelcome to West Virginia‚Äù sign emerged, half-hidden behind a stand of oaks that swayed in a breeze like old friends greeting us. My heart fluttered at its first glimpse‚Äîas if the land itself was waving me home.

Inside, the air shifted. The pine-scented breeze that filtered through the cracked window carried something deeper than fresh mountain air: a faint trace of earth and history. I closed my eyes for a moment, letting the scent drift through me. Behind my eyelids, visions danced‚Äîrolling hills draped in mist, ancestors walking ridges that held their stories in every root and stone. Even the rumble of the RV‚Äôs engine felt right, like a long-forgotten drumbeat echoing through my veins.

Aunt Gauri leaned forward in her seat, peering out the side window. ‚ÄúLook at those hills,‚Äù she murmured. ‚ÄúSee how they roll into the sky? They‚Äôre not just land‚Äîthey‚Äôre memory.‚Äù She reached out as if to touch the horizon through the glass.

Mama reached back to squeeze her sister‚Äôs hand. ‚ÄúI can almost hear our great-grandmothers speaking on the wind,‚Äù she said, voice soft.

Anshka pressed her forehead to the window, watching a hawk wheel overhead. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre greeting us,‚Äù she whispered, as though the bird were a welcome committee.

I felt it then‚Äîa warmth blossoming in my chest that had nothing to do with the sun‚Äôs last rays. It was a pull, gentle but insistent, guiding me forward. Every leaf, every shadowed hollow, seemed to hum with a power both ancient and immediate. I imagined the first footsteps of our people, the songs they sang, the prayers they breathed into this very air.

The road wound upward, revealing overlooks where the valley spread out like a green ocean. The RV‚Äôs engine sputtered as Mama shifted gears, and I realized my breath had caught. I leaned closer to the window, watching the land stretch and fold beneath us. In that moment, the rumble of the road, the soft chorus of my family‚Äôs voices, and the whispering pines all merged into one truth:

Home wasn‚Äôt just a place.

It was a return to who we were‚Äîheirs to these hills, keepers of stories carved in stone and wind. In crossing this border, we weren‚Äôt simply arriving somewhere new; we were coming back to ourselves.

1l6kvkz,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1l6kvkz/the_waffle_house_at_the_edge_of_the_woods/,The Waffle House at the Edge of the Woods,"[this is a repost, my previous account got nuked. Meaty and Wendi, be as critical as you want, it will definitely be funny if I made you crash out üòÇ]

Waffle House, an icon of American midwestern and southern culture. Often, it‚Äôs yellow glow is a beacon of hope to those late night dwellers, whether they be members of the working class or alcohol favoring partiers. Druggos are also a staple clientele. Waffle House, for better or worse, opens its doors to everyone from every walk of life. 

I will set the scene: it‚Äôs a late Thursday night, or early Friday morning in technicality, and I was heading home from a late night bender where I had the important but ultimately boring job of designated driver. All I wanted to do was go home and crack open a cold one for myself to kick off my weekend. Nature had other plans, however. The weather in the midsouth turned on a dime, and tonight was no exception. A downpour diminished any visibility on the road, and I knew I couldn‚Äôt confidently drive through this. The familiar yellow glow shone through the onslaught of rain and hail, however, and given that Waffle House will probably remain open under threat of nuclear war, I knew I could seek refuge there. 

The jingling bells welcomed me more than any employee did, but I could not blame them. The restaurant was a mess, probably from a busy evening earlier. The rodeo was this weekend, after all, and those rodeo boys sure loved their Waffle House. Shit, we all did. It was a Waffle Home in this part of town-- it was all we had after the rest of the town went to bed at sundown. 

A waitress sighs and tells me to sit wherever I‚Äôd like and she‚Äôd get to me when she could. She looked so tired. I picked the one somewhat clean table in the place, and watched the storm rage on outside. My phone confirmed that I would be here for awhile, and all I could do at this point was hope it didn‚Äôt evolve into a tornado. Waffle House would probably remain open even if it did. 

Even this late into the night, Waffle House had a buzz of conversation and kitchen noises. I saw a full staff and other customers, and yet, the only sound in the place was the hail beating on the roof and windows. The usual late night sound of laughter or arguments (usually the latter) was replaced by this frighteningly eerie silence. 

Seeing my phone was nearing the end of its battery life, I glanced around for an outlet when my eyes met those of the man in the booth across me. His hunched shoulders were cloaked in a dirty plaid shirt, and I assumed he might have been one of the rodeo boys. He wasn‚Äôt terribly old, maybe in his fifties at most, but the weariness of his features aged him. He stared at me momentarily, a slight crustiness to his gaze, before he returned to his plate of syrup soaked waffles. 

I slid down a little in my booth, knowing I‚Äôd soon be phoneless. Well, not the end of the world, I figured. People operated just fine without phones for years. I set it aside and waited for my waitress to remember I was here. 

The lights above flickered, and yet were silent-- none of that fluorescent hum. Or maybe there was, and I just couldn‚Äôt hear it among the thunder and hail. It still struck me as unsettling, but my thoughts were interrupted by the work worn face of Marilyn. 

‚ÄúWhat can I get you?,‚Äù she asked in a monotone voice that added to my increasing unease. She didn‚Äôt sound tired, or annoyed, she sounded utterly blank. Almost robotic, but with an inflection of human that made it uncanny.

‚ÄúCould I get a coffee, and the two egg breakfast with--‚Äù  I didn‚Äôt get to specify anything about my plate before she was walking away. Must have been a hell of a shift, I thought to myself. Whatever, food was food, I would be fine with whatever I got at this point, as long as it passed the time faster. I just wanted to go home. 

Her shoes echoed as she shuffled off, and she didn‚Äôt speak with the cook, she just handed him a plate with random crap on it. Figuring my staring would be rude, I turned back to the window. Luckily, the hail stopped, but the rain was still coming down in buckets. No tornado watch yet. The atmosphere felt oppressively thick, and I almost felt like I was choking on the smells of burnt coffee, bacon, and stale cigarettes. There was an undertone to it though, something I couldn‚Äôt place right away. It was oddly‚Ä¶.metallic. 

I pressed the heels of my hand to my eyes and took a deep breath. I had to relax. It was just a fucking Waffle House. It was always weird-- that was part of the charm. My growing anxiety was just the storms, right? 

‚ÄúGood time for a late night meal, huh?‚Äù The voice made me jump from my seat. It was the rodeo guy, staring right at me. His voice was low and gravelly and much more human than the waitress‚Äôs, yet it gave me even more anxiety. Despite how I‚Äôd seen him actively eating, his plate had the same amount of food on it that I‚Äôd seen earlier. He had a little smirk on his face, and glanced at the window, as if suggesting I do the same. 

I smiled nervously, wondering why the fuck some random man was talking to me. I was a newer face around this part of the country, and what they called Southern Hospitality still creeped me the fuck out. As if noticing this, he let out a frightening little chuckle before returning to his plate of waffles, his weirdly hypnotic gaze now breaking. 

I looked back out the window, weirdly compelled to, and the rain had downgraded to less apocalyptic now. I could see my car, and a few bodies in the parking lot smoking. I had a bad habit of not locking my doors, so I locked them from my remote to deter any smokers out there who might be interested in my stunning little Nissan Altima that smoked if you drove it longer than twenty minutes. Lightning flashed, momentarily illuminating the parking lot. That‚Äôs when I noticed the shadows. They moved unnaturally, and danced only at the very edges of the parking lot.

My heart began to race, but like before, the waitress interrupted my growing unease. A cup of coffee was placed in front of me, its smell warm and familiar. And yet, it brought me no comfort. I tried to ask for sugar and cream, but again, the waitress walked away before I could. Black coffee was better than no coffee, I figured. Taking a sip eased my nerves a bit, and I told myself I was just letting my anxiety get out of hand. I was finding fright in things that were perfectly normal-- for a Waffle House. 

Aside myself and the rodeo boy, there was one other table here. Five people in total, who were silent the whole time. I only knew this because they stared at me as they walked by to leave. No words, no smiles, just vacant staring. I knew I stood out, but it made me feel uncomfortable regardless. 

Rodeo boy laughs once more. ‚ÄúSaw yer plates,‚Äù he said, motioning to the window. ‚ÄúOut of state. You‚Äôre new here, aren‚Äôt ya?‚Äù

‚ÄúBeen about six months,‚Äù I replied. Did that count as new? Ever since I moved here, people seemed obsessed with the idea of me being from out of town. It felt so unnecessary.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just a drop of piss in the bucket, son. I‚Äôm here every night, and I ain‚Äôt ever seen you.‚Äù He was right. I‚Äôd never been to this Waffle House before. I much more preferred the one on the highway, surrounded by other businesses. This one was more remote, which added to it‚Äôs uncomfortable atmosphere. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre gonna stare, son. You‚Äôre out here dressed as Count Dracula, chokin‚Äô back black coffee. We don‚Äôt do cream ‚Äòn sugar, you‚Äôll just have to mature a bit.‚Äù

He laughed once more, but I decided not to reply. Why should I? He was a creepy, hulking man who was getting a kick out of scaring and insulting me. It felt safest to pretend he wasn‚Äôt there. 

My eyes go back to the window, and in another flash of lightning, I see them again. The shadows. It was as if fingers of darkness were clawing at the edges of the parking lot. I inched closer to the glass to get a better look, when the sound of a plate slamming once again pulls my attention away. My waitress. 

‚ÄúSyrup?,‚Äù she asked. 

It confused me, until I looked down and saw waffles. I hadn‚Äôt ordered that. ‚ÄúOh, this is--‚Äù

‚ÄúAll we got,‚Äù she snapped. ‚ÄúSyrup or not?‚Äù

I nervously shook my head and slumped in my seat some as she walked away. I wasn‚Äôt the biggest fan of waffles-- even Waffle House‚Äôs-- but hey, food was food. I took a bite, and again looked out the window. The sight made me nearly choke on my food. 

The man was laughing wholeheartedly now, as if my horror was the funniest thing he‚Äôd ever seen. The entire lot now was engulfed in the strange tendrils of shadow, and it was pulling at the hedges that perimetered the building. I got up quickly, getting as far from the window as I could in a short amount of time. 

My eyes looked to rodeo boy. ‚ÄúShut the fuck up dude-- don‚Äôt you see that!?‚Äù

‚ÄúSee what?,‚Äù he mocked. ‚ÄúOh, hush boy.‚Äù His laughing ceased and he pointed at the seat across his. ‚ÄúYour mind‚Äôs playing with ya, making ya see shit. Why don‚Äôt ya sit awhile and relax some?‚Äù

I shook my head and turned to the counter, trying to pay. But it was like the staff was ignoring me. 

‚ÄúAh, come on!,‚Äù the man teased. ‚ÄúYou look like you‚Äôd be a big fan of the creepy crawlies that hang out ‚Äòround here! C‚Äômon, sit with me, I can tell ya all about it.‚Äù

I still didn‚Äôt want to, and every instinct said not to, and yet, it was like he was forcing me to. I was stiff as a corpse as I sat down, and my eyes refused to meet his. They were quite suddenly full of life, like a proud predator who had just caught his prey. 

‚ÄúThey say these woods are haunted,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs cool‚Ä¶‚Äù I murmured, looking for any out to leave.

‚ÄúThe shadows yer seeing, they ain‚Äôt real. The trees pull weird tricks out here. No, no, see the real worries in this neck of the woods ain‚Äôt no ghosties. There‚Äôs weird people.‚Äù

No shit. I‚Äôm sitting with one.

He then says something that injected ice into my veins. ‚ÄúYanno, you‚Äôd make a fine lookin‚Äô corpse, Hollywood.‚Äù

There was an instinct to correct him, wanting to say that just because I was from California didn‚Äôt mean I was from Hollywood. I‚Äôd never even been to fucking Hollywood. But fear took over, and I tried to inch out of my seat.

‚ÄúNot a lot of meat on ya, though. But I bet you‚Äôre one of them clean eaters, all that plant based shit. I bet that‚Äôs like a good, grass fed beef. Ya dig?‚Äù

I dug, alright. I once again tried to leave, but now, his hand had a frighteningly strong grip on my own. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt go out there right now if I was you. Like I said, they say these woods are haunted. They say they make people do crazy things. There‚Äôs a few families in them there woods, families I won‚Äôt ever speak to. They like to wait for the dark--‚Äù His voice immediately stopped with the tingling of bells. A new face had just walked in.

He was a tall, thin, utterly filthy man. I would guess that he was a farmer based on his clothing, but it was almost as if he was dressed in a costume to trick people like me who weren‚Äôt raised around here.

Rodeo boy in front of me now leaned in close. ‚ÄúThat there‚Äôs one of em,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúYou sit tight, pretty boy.‚Äù

I had a chance to escape then, as he‚Äôd gotten up to greet this freak. But that meant walking right by them, which I didn‚Äôt want to chance. This new comer had dead eyes, the kind with no soul in them. I turned away, quietly listening to rodeo boy talk him up. 

‚ÄúWell, shoot, Todd I ain‚Äôt seen ya in, shit, how long‚Äôs it been now?‚Äù Rodeo boy sounded genuinely friendly now. 

‚ÄúNot since our Brodie went missin‚Äô,‚Äù Todd replied. His voice was oddly deep for someone as scrawny as he was. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been ‚Äòbout six months.‚Äù

Todd glances my way, and I again feel ice in my blood. ‚ÄúYou looks a lot like my Brodie,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou wanna be Brodie?‚Äù

Rodeo boy, takes him by the shoulder and leads him to a table. ‚ÄúNow, Todd, that twig looks nothing like Brodie. You don‚Äôt want him.‚Äù

Want me? I got up now, knowing this may not end well. I tried to be inconspicuous as I went for the door, but Todd‚Äôs voice warned me not to. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt wanna go out there right now. Mama‚Äôs out, ‚Äòn she‚Äôs in one of her moods. She‚Äôs been real hungry, Mason. I dunno what to with her.‚Äù

Rodeo boy, aka Mason, told me to sit back down before turning back to Todd. ‚ÄúYou gotta ride it out. Yer family can‚Äôt keep doin‚Äô this.‚Äù His voice dropped to a hush. ‚ÄúOne of these days, someone‚Äôs gonna catch on. Get her a deer or somethin‚Äô, all these missin‚Äô boys is eventually gonna turn back to you.‚Äù

It was all clicking. Was this Mama some crazed murder? Was she blood thirsty? Or was it a more literal hunger? 

I didn‚Äôt want to stick around to find out. My car was less than twenty feet away. If I ran, I could get in it fast enough to beat it out of here. 

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt try it!,‚Äù Mason called after me. But it was too late. I was dining and dashing sure, but I had to get the fuck out of here. Through the rain, I sprinted to my car, and practically dove inside. I prayed for it to start on the first try, for once in my life, and thank god it did. I ensured all my doors were locked before turning on the headlights. 

The sight before me made me scream. An older, larger woman was in front of my car. In my panic, I was struggling to shift into reverse, giving her a chance to hobble to my door. Through the glass, I could hear her wailing, ‚ÄúYou gotta light!? You gotta light for my cigarette!?‚Äù She was pounding on the window, begging for a light. 

I did not care. I threw the car into reverse and whipped the fuck out of there. I was going about ninety on the highway, wanting to put as much space between me and this Waffle House as possible. It was all a bad dream, I told myself, a manifestation of my anxiety. Seeing my apartment complex in my headlights felt like salvation, and I knew this was all behind me. Now, more than ever, I craved a Modelo. I took a moment in my car to just breathe. Everything was going to be alright, I assured myself. It was all fine. Mason was just scaring me for fun, Todd was obviously mentally ill, that woman was probably on drugs. It was just a weird night. I was letting my fear of storms make everything into a horror movie. 

Once I‚Äôd stopped shaking, I started for my apartment. Typically, I never paid attention to anything in the lobby, least of all the mess of papers that littered the billboard. There was usually all the same shit: local ads, lost pets, and missing people. The same things you‚Äôd see at a Walmart or a post office, or anywhere else. I‚Äôd seen it all so much that it melted into the background in my day to day life. 

But tonight, it caught my eye. A missing person‚Äôs flyer with a photo of a guy looking vaguely like myself. Brodie Wells, it read. Brodie. My heart sunk as I ripped it off and inspected it closer. Behind Brodie‚Äôs flyer was another, very similarly formatted. Another young guy, looking like an outsider. And another. And another. There were over twenty of them-- all within ten years of age from each other, all not dressing like the townsfolk I'd seen here, and all missing in this area. All last seen around that Waffle House by those woods. They were also all tourists, visitors-- just like myself. I brought all the flyers to my unit with me, laying them all over my floor to get a better look. This kidnapper definitely had a type. Or was it a kidnapper? 

I pulled open my laptop and started researching each name, and everything came back the same. No trace of any of them, and this had been going on for years. Two of them had an ounce more of information on them, as their names were better known. They had public profiles, so there was much more on their case. They were also tourists, but they looked different from the kidnappers' victim type. They were in town for some YouTube video project, and apparently, one recommended they film out the woods in the area after a dinner at Waffle House. For years, nothing ever came up about them, until a hiker‚Äôs dog came running out of the woods with a human bone. One that was so smooth, it was as if all flesh had been cooked away. Those were the article's exact words. Soon, another bone was found, and both were DNA matched to a pair of missing YouTubers named Hunter and Isaiah. But that was years ago, and they were never explicitly tied to other missing persons cases. Despite the differences, I found connections. Were these the first victims? Did they put up too much of a fight, perhaps? The one did look a little intimidating, like he didn't trust strangers. Maybe he'd fought back? My heart was pounding and my mind went back to Waffle House. 

Mama‚Äôs in one of her moods. What was the mood? Homicidal? Damn it, Mason, that‚Äôs not something to ride out! I decided to try and call the police, but my phone was dead at this point. Surely, there was a public phone in the lobby. I raced downstairs for it, but to my dismay, the line was dead. Had the storm taken it out? It had picked back up again, the thunder rattling the whole building as it sounded. The lights flickered before also going out, and now, it was pitch black. The only light came from the occasional flashes of lightning. 

That‚Äôs how I saw her, standing in that glass doorway. As shadows unnaturally danced about in the same way they did in that parking lot, I saw her silhouette and a glimpse of her face, but there was no mistaking it. It was the same woman, and my only saving grace was the door being locked from the inside. She was pounding on the glass once more, begging to be let in. 

‚ÄúCome on, now, boy, you can spare a light!,‚Äù she begged, somehow yelling loud enough that I could hear her clearly through the glass. Her fist was pounding on it in a jarring display of strength, sending echoing booms through the quiet lobby. I couldn't see a thing in the dark to find where I was going, and I stood frozen in fear. I was hoping the lock would hold and that the rain soaking her would make her give up. 

A million things ran through my mind. Mason really was a freak, but he was trying to be nice, wasn't he? Was he trying to save me? He seemed to know, and yet, he seemed to have a soft spot for Todd. Was Todd an unwilling accomplice? Were Mason's comments nothing more than to get me to either leave sooner, or pay attention to him? It seemed Marilyn, my waitress, was trying to keep me distracted too. Did they not want me to look out the window? Was that how this Mama spotted me? I lived my life in near constant fear of everyone around me that I missed those who maybe had good intentions at heart. How I regretted that now. 

All at once her pounding stopped, and I thought for sure she was done. But she suddenly pressed her face to the glass, and a long flash of lightning illuminated her unholy grin. She's not human, I thought to myself. She couldn't be. 

‚ÄúYou'd make a lovely corpse!,‚Äù she yelled, and it sent chills through me. 

It wasn't just because of those harrowing words. It was because I could hear her much clearer now. The door was open, the glass shattered around her frail, twitching frame. Her skin hung on her like kudzu hangs on an abandoned home, and her teeth were unnaturally large and white as she grinned maniacally. I was frozen before the sound of shuffling glass against the bottom of her slippers pushed me into action. Her eyes shone like a predator‚Äôs, and I had to act to live. 

All I could do now was run.

That was, until recently.

Nina had started to develop something I have never seen from her; she‚Äôs starting to whimper in her sleep. Now, she has definitely mumbled in her sleep and maybe even outright said a few words over the years, but maybe every other month or so, never frequently like the whimpering has been.

I believe it started a few weeks ago when I woke up in my sleep from what felt like a jolt of movement, from what I assume was Nina just moving in her sleep, but that was when I noticed a soft whimper. We have all the lights completely out in our house at night as we both can‚Äôt sleep without the room being completely dark, so when I looked over to check on Nina, I could not see a thing, but I could tell it was coming from her.¬† At first, I was disoriented from being shocked awake, so it took me a few seconds to process what was happening. Initially, I had thought of waking her to make sure she was okay, to make sure she wasn‚Äôt having a nightmare, but I knew she had to get up early in the morning for work, so I figured it was best to let her sleep, as it was so late into the night, I left it at that and I fell asleep shortly after.

The first few times I had awoken to this whimpering I had looked past it as I know how much stress she had been under recently, so I assumed this was a biproduct of that. However, my concern grew immensely tonight as the whimpering had developed into crying.

Upon waking up from Ninas crying, I was startled, we had just watched a horror movie before bed, so I was already on edge. Adrenaline kicking in, I started shaking Nina‚Äôs shoulder trying to wake her, perhaps too harshly, as when she awoke, she started hyperventilating and sat up rapidly.

‚ÄúOh fuck!‚Äù I shouted.

I quickly got up and ran to turn the light on.

When I look over to see Nina, she looks dazed and before I can say anything, she throws up forcefully. I rush and grab my phone to call for an ambulance, but Nina interrupts me bluntly yet weakly before I can even open my phone ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

I quickly sat next to her on the bed to check on her, sitting in the pile of vomit.

‚ÄúNina, are you okay? Don‚Äôt move, please just let me call an ambulance.‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Nina growled at Samuel.

Startled, I reply ‚ÄúY‚Ä¶ you were crying in your sleep, I had to wake you, let me get you some water, Nina? Please, I‚Äôm sorry. Are you okay?‚Äù

After what felt like minutes Nina angerly speaks up.

‚ÄúWhy would you do this? Do you know how dangerous that was? You could have seriously hurt me.‚Äù

Confused, I reply ‚ÄúI only meant to make sure you were okay, you had started crying, how could I not do anything?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust let it be, it was probably just a nightmare, you did more harm than that would have ever done‚Äù Nina replies.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. You can go back to sleep on the spare bed, I need to clean up this mess and have a shower. I am sorry again, I love you.‚Äù I reply.

‚ÄúI love you too.‚Äù Nina says softly before she leaves to rinse off in the shower and head back to bed.

I change the bedding and place it in the wash then have a shower before heading back to bed.

The morning comes and I wake up alone in my bed for the first time in years. I get out of bed as quickly as possible to go check on Nina. When I go to look into the spare room Nina is nowhere to be found, and the bed has even been made. Typically, it is a battle to get my wife out of bed in the mornings, so this took me by surprise, especially with her feeling sick last night. After checking the rest of the house, there was no trace of her, no dishes from breakfast, no fruit from the fruit bowl missing, even her keep cup was still in the cupboard. Now, she doesn‚Äôt start work for another hour and a half and it only takes her 10 minutes to drive there so there is no way she has already left. She works at a sleep research center so there are never any calls to come to work early, there is never anyone at the facility at this time anyway. Realizing something might still be wrong with her from last night I tried calling, but when I did I heard her phone ringing from the spare room under the bed. Nina was acting like a completely different person, first her being out of bed before me and now her disappearing without her phone, she‚Äôs always been pretty attached to her phone especially with the rise of TikTok and the endless barrage of cat videos she sends me.

My only option now was to try calling her best friend and coworker, Abby. If she was going to be anywhere else, it‚Äôd be with her. Maybe she was still mad at me from last night and headed to her house to have someone to console in. Thankfully when I called Abby she picked up almost immediately, she seemed to be expecting my call. She very quickly let me know without me really even saying a word that, yes Nina was with me, and yes she is okay, she just needed to get out of the house for a little bit. I was both concerned and relieved. ¬†

‚ÄúCan I speak to her, please?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúNina is having a shower right now, I promise you she‚Äôs okay. But she really just needs to forget about this, and you guys can chat about it later. Our project at work has taken up so much of our time that we are both just needing to have that as our only focus right now, sorry‚Äù Abby informed me.

I love and trust my wife, so as much as it hurt me that I couldn‚Äôt talk it out right now I had to trust it was going to be okay and that we could soon work this out.

¬†

¬†

Since I had some time on my hands now I figured it was a good idea to try and set up something nice for Nina and I for dinner tonight, to hopefully smooth over things between us. I‚Äôm currently on long service leave from my job as a veterinarian and I‚Äôve been using this time to get things done that I have put off for far too long. Being with my wife for so long I have learnt a few tricks along the way that has always seemed to help with situations like this, where I have typically idiotically done something to upset her and for some reason in the moment not rectified it straight away. Nina has always appreciated the small things, so my idea is to set up the dinner table with her favourite dish sinigang, have a bouquet of some native flowers from our garden and rose pedals leading up to the table. I have never been the best chef but luckily her dad is an amazing chef, I always call on him to help whenever I need to make sinigang, he also helps in giving it that flavour of nostalgia.

Nina arrives at the house hours after she would have normally finished work. I hear her open the door and rush over to her to greet her.

‚ÄúHello, my love, how was your day? Here, come here.‚Äù Before she can even reply, I cover her eyes and walk her to the kitchen.

‚ÄúTa-daaaaa!‚Äù

‚ÄúAww, baby, you know it‚Äôs not our anniversary today, right?‚Äù Nina replied.

‚ÄúOf course! But this is just my apology for how I was the other night, I was just trying to help but I can see that I could have done better, I‚Äôm sorry again.‚Äù I replied

‚ÄúPlease, it‚Äôs okay. I am sorry for how I acted as well, I know you were just trying to help, work has been so stressful, and this project is just draining my body. But I should be finished before the night of our anniversary!‚Äù Nina exclaimed.

We sit down and enjoy our dinner together, then settled in for the night with a movie. At this point I had already forgotten to bring up her arriving late, but I didn‚Äôt want to ruin the night, so I decided it was best to let that go.

It was Nina‚Äôs night to choose what movie we watch so she picked Mean Girls, it was one of her most watched films. I pretended to not enjoy the movie in front of Nina, but secretly it was a favourite of mine as well. At some point during the movie, I couldn‚Äôt help myself but bring up the crying from the night before.

‚ÄúSo, do you see stress related crying in sleep a lot at work?‚Äù  
‚ÄúW... what? Oh, I mean, yeah you can see all kinds of response to stress in your sleep, vocalizing isn‚Äôt that unusual.‚Äù Nina replied.

‚ÄúOh, well that‚Äôs good then I guess. Is there anything I can do to help?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúNot really, just finishing this project is the only thing that can remove this stress, you‚Äôve done everything you can. I appreciate you. I love you‚Äù Nina said endearingly

‚ÄúWell, then I cannot wait for that day to come. I love you too‚Äù I replied.

We went on to finish the movie.

¬†

As we started getting ready for bed, Nina brought up that she thinks its best for both of us if she just sleeps in the spare room while this project is still underway, so we don‚Äôt disturb each other through the night. I agreed and once we were ready for bed we kissed each other goodnight and went to our separate rooms.

I wake up feeling more refreshed than any time in recent memory, perhaps Nina‚Äôs stress crying was affecting me more than I had thought originally. To my surprise when I got up to say good morning to Nina, I noticed a coffee and toast on my bedside table. Nina must be reciprocating my token of appreciation with another one back. After finishing my toast, I brought the dish with me and my half drank coffee to find Nina smiling more than ever and cleaning all the dishes from last night.

‚ÄúWell, someone is in a good mood, am I that much of a hassle that sleeping without me gives you that much energy?‚Äù I jokingly asked.

‚ÄúOf course not my dear, I am just feeling like I am making strides on my project. Did you enjoy your breakfast?‚Äù Nina gleefully replied.

Before I replied, I had noticed Nina‚Äôs eyes. She looked so tired, like she hadn‚Äôt slept at all, yet she had such high energy, and I swear for a split second I could even see what looked like a shimmer come from her iris.

‚ÄúUh ha-ha, yes it was great. Thank you for that. Hey, did you get much sleep last night? You weren‚Äôt working on your project all night, were you?‚Äù I replied concerningly.

‚ÄúOh! No, well, yes. You see I was, but I also wasn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs kind of hard to explain but I did get some work done!‚Äù Nina replied

I gave her a look of confusion before I broke out into a smile again seeing Nina happy again.

‚ÄúWell that‚Äôs good. I guess? So anyway, what‚Äôs your plan for the day? Do you think you can bring home some dinner for us since I cooked last night?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course, I‚Äôll grab some drive-through on the way home. I‚Äôll grab us the usual. Anyway I have to go to work. I‚Äôll see you later‚Äù Nina said as she kissed me rushing her way out.

The day went quickly as I had decided to do some chores around the house since Nina‚Äôs vibrant energy rubbed off on me and motivated me to finally get some stuff done. While I was cleaning the study I was looking through the bookshelves and noticed some books that seemed really out of place. Nina and I had typically only kept books that related to our work but what I was looking at was a book on ancient occult rituals and another one on physic connections. Now Nina and I are both very disconnected from any spiritual parts of the world especially within our work so there is no reason for us to own these books. Although since I was in such a good mood I was able to overlook this as I could write it off as personal interest or some nuanced research.

The rest of the day was pretty uneventful, when Nina got home her energy was still high and she seemed even happier than before. The one thing that bothered me still is that her eyes still looked so tired and I swear her face is starting to look a little gaunt. I had to push past this as I didn‚Äôt want to push again and ruin what we had built back up to with each other even though it hurt me to see her like this. We did our nightly routine getting ready for bed and still deciding to sleep in separate rooms until her project is done, we kissed each other goodnight and went to our rooms.

We had burritos tonight which is our go to for when we are just having a lazy dinner, but this nights one has not sat well with me. I rush to the bathroom almost struggling to make it to the toilet, the second I take a seat it was like a shotgun blast out my rear end. It was the worst stomach-ache I had ever had but the forceful expulsion did provide almost an immediate relief at least. Unfortunately for me I think my diarrhoea woke my wife as I could here what sounded like a giggle from her room. I was blushing red as in the moment I had prayed she did not hear it. After cleaning up I decided to check in on her seeing as I had already awoken her. As I approached the door she had continued to giggle. Now I did think it was a funny moment, but I had taken a shower in that time since. Confused, I opened the door to her pitch-black room, only her muffled laugh emanating from the room. I had expected her to have stopped by now and react to me opening the door, but she kept laughing. I turn on the light, only to see her staring at the ceiling, holding her mouth trying to contain her laughter. She looked almost giddy with excitement. Creeped out now I walk over to confront her to settle down now. As I grab her arm, she doesn‚Äôt look at me, she doesn‚Äôt acknowledge me. She just sits staring, only looking at the ceiling. I can see in her eyes that shimmer I believed I had once seen. I shake her to try and get her to respond to me. The second I shake her she snaps out of it, she sits up and sways like she has vertigo, once again she goes to forcefully vomit, thankfully this time holding it back.

‚ÄúNina what the fuck, are you okay? I need to take you to the hospital.‚Äù I shouted.

Nina in such a daze doesn‚Äôt even register that I am talking.

Noticing this I pick her up and speed all the way to the hospital.

It‚Äôs 5am now at the hospital. Nina has been undergoing various tests and yet everything so far is coming back completely normal. The only abnormality so far is her stress leukogram. After the final lot of testing the only other thing they find is that she has some muscle atrophy throughout her whole body and some rapid weight loss. We‚Äôve been in the hospital for 6 hours total now and the whole time she‚Äôs been in this pseudo-comatose state where she is just staring, unblinking, unresponsive, unaware. It would take another 6 hours until anything changed, I had sat with her the whole time. It had just hit lunch time, so I decided to take a quick break from watching over her and grab some food, but just as I was about to stand up Nina speaks.

‚ÄúHi! How are you? When do we get to leave the hospital?‚Äù

I freeze. I can‚Äôt even turn around to look, I feel like this mustn‚Äôt be real.

‚ÄúN‚Ä¶ Nina? You‚Äôre awake?‚Äù I say shakily as I turn to face her.

Her eyes are brighter than ever; I see that same shimmer shine across her eyes as if tiny gold flakes flowed through her iris‚Äôs. Her soul seemed vibrant, but her body was still weak.

¬†‚ÄúYes! Of course! My love, I‚Äôve missed you. Can we please leave now, I think my project is ready.‚Äù Nina says with such vigour you would forget that her body looks like she hasn‚Äôt slept for months.

‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt, you need to rest. You had some sort of seizure, the doctors can‚Äôt find anything noteworthy from the tests, but your symptoms are concerning enough they are sending out your case to get second opinions from neurologists.‚Äù I told her with concern.

‚ÄúI can explain it all later, lets just leave! C‚Äômon!‚Äù Nina had already jumped to her feet before she could even finish her sentence.

I went to object, but she grabbed my arm and started walking us out of the room, seeing her happy and awake again blurred my judgment letting me just accept the situation and take us home. On our way out the nurse tried to flag us down to get us to stay but this just motivated Nina to move faster as she linked arms with me and started running. Before I knew it the nurse was shouting for help over the PA as they had Nina‚Äôs wellbeing on their mind to keep her in hospital. But it was too late, it was only a small hospital, and Nina was hauling ass so by the time anyone was close we had already made it outside to the carpark. Against my better judgment I brought us home, it felt like we were teenagers again, doing things we weren‚Äôt supposed to, doing things without thinking of consequences.

When we arrived home, she wouldn‚Äôt stop staring at me and smiling. I can‚Äôt help but smile back and ask.

‚ÄúYes?‚Äù.

‚ÄúDo you know what today is?‚Äù Nina says with a huge smile and shimmering eyes.

‚ÄúToday‚Ä¶ Oh my god. Nina. Our 10^(th) anniversary. I am so sorry, I didn‚Äôt realize, I was so confused with waking up in the middle of the night, the hospital trip.‚Äù I stumbled over my words.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, I finished the project. I can‚Äôt wait to share it with you tonight.‚Äù Nina says with her unbreaking stare.

‚ÄúYou did? I don‚Äôt understand, I haven‚Äôt seen you work on your notes or bring anything back with you from the research centre, how can you be done?‚Äù I ask confused.

‚ÄúWell, this wasn‚Äôt technically a project for work, yes Abby and I worked on it at work, but it was sort of our own thing. We didn‚Äôt want to share it with anyone, as, well, it‚Äôs hard to explain.‚Äù Nina replied.

‚ÄúPlease, explain it to me then.‚Äù I begged.

‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt something I can explain, it‚Äôs something you have to experience. This is my gift to you, for our 10^(th) anniversary‚Äù Nina said, still smiling and staring.

‚ÄúSo I really can‚Äôt learn more until tonight?‚Äù. I asked sadly

‚ÄúNo, it is worth it. Trust me. I love you.‚Äù Nina replied

‚ÄúI love you too.‚Äù

We pass the day by making food together, embracing each other, reminiscing, and by dinner time, Nina was ready to reveal more.

‚ÄúSo you know how I have been crying in my sleep?‚Äù.

‚ÄúYes! Do you think that‚Äôll stop now that you‚Äôre finished with your project?‚Äù I said excitedly

‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt actually sleeping. Abby had been researching some interesting old documents about types of dreams and how different cultures could use them for spiritual guidance, and how they would use some herbs to enhance them. We had been working on modernizing this process and seeing what science we could find behind it. It took us a while, but we had both been working different angles to try and figure out what methods work and what produces any results. We ended up stumbling across a method that was so potent, we couldn‚Äôt share it with the world.‚Äù Nina replied.

‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre going to share it to me‚Äù I replied concerned

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt just some old school ritual, this is something different, paracausal, I can‚Äôt explain it. No one can explain it. You have to experience it. When you first pulled me awake, I was just first experimenting with this method, they weren‚Äôt tears of stress, they were tears of joy, and when I finally got it, I couldn‚Äôt help but laugh with overwhelming excitement and happiness, and I want that for you as well.‚Äù Nina said lovingly.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know that I want that. I love you, you make me so happy, and I can‚Äôt ask for anyone else in this world. I get that this is a positive experience, and that it is life changing. You have to understand, you don‚Äôt even know the consequences of this. What implications it can and will have. I need you to understand, I just want you, I don‚Äôt want a psychedelic high that will alter my perception of reality, I just want you.‚Äù I said as a tear started to well in my eye.

‚ÄúPlease‚Ä¶ do this for me. Once you do it, you‚Äôll understand. I‚Äôll be severing my connection tonight, to my body‚Ä¶‚Äù Nina smiling, but with a tear in her eye.

Before she can even finish what she is saying I cut her off yelling.

‚ÄúAre you fucking crazy? Why would you ever do that? Nina, you cannot do this I‚Ä¶‚Äù Now in full tears, chocking up, unable to get my words out.

Finally catching my breath.

‚ÄúPlease, my love. I don‚Äôt know what I can say, you know how much I love and adore you and just want my life with you. This cannot work, even if it is a godly experience this is not going to work, what about our physical connection? What about our future? Our future kids? Friends? Family? Abby?‚Äù I say softer in the hopes of getting through to Nina.

‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs hard.‚Äù Tears now fully enveloping Nina‚Äôs eyes.

‚ÄúI love you Samuel. You have done everything you can for me. You can join me; in the nightstand there is a diary with instructions on how to join me. I will see you soon my love. I love you. Goodbye.‚Äù Nina standing, collapses in an instant, the gold shimmer leaving her eyes, her body going cold in an instant, her eyes losing all colour. She is gone.

Samuel completely breaks down into tears collapsing to the floor grabbing onto Nina‚Äôs body, begging, praying for her to come back. It feels like a dagger penetrates right into his chest as every breath feels like it plunges deeper and deeper. Screaming into the universe he holds her body. Nothing can separate them, he loved her. She loved him. It is over now, she is gone, he knows how he can join her, but his body refuses to move, he can‚Äôt leave her.

Nothing else matters if she isn‚Äôt there. My wife, my only sole mate. Gone. Hopelessness doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe life without her. I have to join her. I drag myself across the floor, the pain too much to handle but the love for her too strong to hold me back. I get closer, crawling. I lay by the nightstand and read the instructions.

This is it, I am sorry for what I leave behind, my responsibilities, my future, my failures, my family, my friends. I cannot go on in life if it is one without Nina. Please understand, I know this is selfish, but this is my choice.

¬†

I write this story to you from where we shimmer, you may be reading this from here, earth, past, present, future, it‚Äôs all the same. I can say the word now, now, and you will have read it before my existence and after. I leave this book with my body, if you wish to read it and use it, you can, I will be here. I can see my body now, as well as Nina‚Äôs. Both shimmerless, lifeless, husks. I can see us before we knew each other, before we loved each other, before we were sole mates. I cannot describe what Nina could not, I can experience what Nina could.

Nina, tell me to join you, I will see you soon my love, I love you. Goodbye.

This happened a few weeks ago but I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. Long story short, I manage a coffee shop that‚Äôs inside of a large grocery/department store. It‚Äôs a licensee agreement between the two chains so I technically only work for the grocery/department store, but we have to follow all the standards set by the coffee chain. So we have a district manager employed by the coffee chain that comes in to check on us and make sure we‚Äôre holding up our end of the agreement. 

Anyways, during our last meeting, it‚Äôs me (coffee shop team lead), my direct boss (food and beverage executive team lead), and our district manager. This is a business meeting so we‚Äôre going over sales, metrics, inventory, scheduling, and all that stuff. We‚Äôre sitting in the lobby/cafe area so there are customers around us while we‚Äôre having the meeting. A toddler was sitting behind us at a table with their mother and this kid starts screaming his head off while we‚Äôre conducting our meeting. Annoying, but, whatever. Nothing I can do to stop it. My boss and I are giving each other looks and trying to not start laughing because this kid is being LOUD. A few seconds go by and my boss just straight up says to me ‚Äúso when are you having kids?‚Äù

1l6ksaa,https://i.redd.it/899qmiu1ar5f1.jpeg,MMPR (FANFIC) UNIVERSE 42 Chapter 5,"Chapter 5
The sprawling desert oasis under a sweltering sun burned. Tall, golden dunes stretched across the landscape, dotted with patches of green palms and clear pools. The air buzzed with heat, rippling in waves over the vast sands. An ominous monument rose in the center, a colossal sphinx with glowing blue eyes and intricate carvings covering its stone body.

From the shadows of this towering figure, the monstrous form of King Sphinx emerged. His lion-like mane flowed around a human-like face, and massive wings stretched wide from his back, casting a dark silhouette against the bright sky. His regal staff, topped with an ancient, glowing symbol, gleamed menacingly in the sunlight. The ground shook with each step of his heavy paws, and his eyes gleamed with a cunning intellect.

In the harsh light of this simulated desert, Peter and his team faced their opponent. The heat bore down on them, adding to the intensity of the training session.

‚ÄúAlright, team,‚Äù Peter commanded after getting back up from the ground, his voice echoing through the comms in their helmets, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs stay focused. Jamie, try to predict his moves.‚Äù

King Sphinx roared, lifting his staff and sending a blast of energy that scattered sand in all directions. The Rangers sprang into action.

Jamie moved quickly, his mind calculating potential strategies. ‚ÄúRemember, it‚Äôs like chess,‚Äù he muttered to himself, ‚Äúpositioning is key.‚Äù He directed energy blasts at the monster, attempting to gauge its reaction and find weaknesses. But the complexity of the battle was overwhelming, and despite his sharp intellect, he struggled to keep up with King Sphinx's erratic attacks.

Kaylee darted around the battlefield. A bit clumsy since she was not used to running on sand versus the clean track on the Angel Grove High campus. Even with her disadvantage, her agility was great. She delivered swift kicks and punches, but each blow was met with a powerful swipe from King Sphinx‚Äôs claws. Her smaller frame allowed her to dodge many attacks, but when one connected, the impact sent her sprawling into the sand.

Wyatt, despite his determination, was clearly struggling. His defensive skills were less developed, and each time he tried to engage, King Sphinx easily overpowered him. A powerful gust from King Sphinx‚Äôs wings sent him tumbling across the sand, crashing hard into a dune. He groaned, clutching his side where the impact had been worst.

‚ÄúWyatt!‚Äù Melody called out, her attention diverted. She rushed towards him, her focus split between defending herself and aiding her teammate. This distraction left her vulnerable. King Sphinx capitalized on it, striking her down with a forceful blow from his staff.

Peter watched in horror as his team fell apart under the relentless assault. His heart pounded as he struggled to maintain control of the situation. ‚ÄúJamie, we need to regroup!‚Äù he shouted, his voice tinged with desperation. ‚ÄúKaylee, stay on the move! Melody, keep your guard up!‚Äù

But his commands felt disjointed, his strategy faltering under the pressure. King Sphinx‚Äôs onslaught continued unrelenting, and the Rangers found themselves pushed to their limits.

Jamie, his eyes narrowing in frustration, fired another volley of energy blasts, trying to think several moves ahead. But the monster seemed to anticipate his tactics, evading with ease. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do this alone, Peter!‚Äù Jamie yelled, his analytical mind struggling against the chaos of battle.

Kaylee, still reeling from the hits, struggled to regain her footing. She managed to dodge another of King Sphinx's swipes but was clearly worn down. Her usual agility was compromised by the bruises forming under her armor.

Wyatt, gasping for breath, pushed himself up from the sand. His hands trembled as he tried to steady himself, his eyes filled with determination despite the pain. ‚ÄúI-I‚Äôm not out yet,‚Äù he muttered, but his body told a different story.

Melody, helping Wyatt up, glanced at Peter, her eyes pleading for guidance. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre losing this!‚Äù she cried out, fear edging into her voice.

Peter‚Äôs heart sank. He saw the toll the battle was taking on his team and knew he had to make a decision. But his own self-doubt clouded his judgment. Should he order a retreat? Should he have someone else engage King Sphinx directly while he ensured the safety of the others?

In the split second of hesitation, King Sphinx roared triumphantly. With a final, devastating swipe, he knocked the remaining Rangers to the ground.

The holo-chamber's alarms blared, signaling the end of the simulation. The desert scene dissolved into the metallic walls of the chamber. Peter's breathing was heavy, his mind racing through the events that had just unfolded. His team lay on the floor, battered and exhausted. 

‚ÄúEND SIMULATION! Rangers, please, step forward,‚Äù Zordon‚Äôs voice reverberated throughout the command center, holding a stern edge.

The five powered down, their suits dissolving into casual attire. Peter knelt beside Jamie, helping him to his feet. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I should have directed someone to blast him with you while I ensured the safety of the others. I didn‚Äôt adapt quickly enough,‚Äù Peter said, his voice laden with guilt.

Jamie gave him a tired nod, wiping sweat from his brow. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all learning. But we need a better plan next time.‚Äù

Wyatt, clutching his side, managed a weak smile. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still standing. Barely, but we are.‚Äù

Kaylee, her breath ragged, joined the others, determination still flickering in her eyes despite the pain. ‚ÄúNext time, we‚Äôll be ready. We just need to get back up and try again.‚Äù

Peter nodded, feeling the weight of responsibility heavy on his shoulders. ‚ÄúYeah. Next time, we‚Äôll do better. Together.‚Äù

Zordon‚Äôs face remained stern within his energy tube, his eyes observing the team with a blend of concern and expectation. ‚ÄúPeter, your leadership will be crucial in the battles to come. Your quick thinking in directing the team to defend the civilians was commendable. Yet, remember that adaptability in command is vital. Sometimes, delegating specific tasks to your teammates while you focus on broader strategy can turn the tide of battle. Reflect on this experience, and you will emerge stronger.‚Äù

Peter‚Äôs eyes flickered with a mix of resolution and uncertainty. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right, Zordon. I need to trust my team more and adapt quicker. I need to be more than just reactive‚ÄîI need to anticipate, to plan for the unexpected.‚Äù

Zordon softened his tone, offering a rare glimpse into his own experiences. ‚ÄúI know this is new, and I have been there. It may have been so long ago, but I was a rookie Ranger just like you all. You would not be here if I did not believe you were the right ones for this responsibility. The Morphin Grid is never wrong either. We are connected. Embrace that connection, and things will fall into place. You deserve a good rest. We will continue this tomorrow.‚Äù

Peter‚Äôs posture relaxed slightly, comforted by Zordon's words. ‚ÄúThanks, Zordon. We‚Äôll be ready.‚Äù

Zordon nodded, his expression softening further. ‚ÄúAlpha, send them home.‚Äù

Alpha 5 stepped forward, his voice steady. ‚ÄúTeleportation sequence activated. Preparing to send Rangers to their designated locations.‚Äù

The command center shimmered as the teleportation beam enveloped the Rangers, their forms dissolving into streaks of light that shot out towards their homes. As the chamber quieted, Zordon gazed into the space they had just vacated, contemplating the challenges that lay ahead and the growth his team would need to face them.

‚Ä¶

The warm, golden afternoon light streamed through the windows of The Vinyl Vault, casting a nostalgic glow over the rows of neatly arranged records. The store was a treasure trove of musical history, with walls adorned with vintage posters and memorabilia. The faint crackle of an old record played softly in the background, creating a serene ambiance that contrasted sharply with the earlier intensity of the simulation.

Peter and Jamie wandered through the classic rock section, Jamie‚Äôs fingers deftly navigating the delicate covers. He pulled out an album by The Beatles, the iconic Abbey Road, and examined it with a reverence only true fans understood. Beside him, Peter‚Äôs brow furrowed as he absentmindedly turned a record over in his hands, clearly lost in thought.

‚ÄúMan, you can‚Äôt beat the classics,‚Äù Jamie said, his voice filled with a hint of enthusiasm. He held up the album cover, admiring the legendary artwork. ‚ÄúThe Beatles changed everything. Imagine being the first to hear this stuff‚Äîmust‚Äôve been mind-blowing.‚Äù

Peter responded with a distracted nod, setting the record back on the shelf. ‚ÄúYeah, it must‚Äôve been something else.‚Äù

Jamie glanced at Peter, noticing his distant expression. He carefully set the album back on the shelf and turned to face his friend, leaning casually against the display.

‚ÄúAlright, what‚Äôs eating at you? You‚Äôve been quiet since the simulation. I know that look‚Äîyou‚Äôve got something on your mind.‚Äù

Peter sighed, rubbing the back of his neck as he tried to find the right words. He picked up another record, glanced at the cover, and then put it back without really seeing it.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt shake this feeling that I messed up big time today. The simulation‚Äîit felt like everything was slipping out of control. I knew what I needed to do, but I couldn‚Äôt pull it together. I should‚Äôve had a better plan, should‚Äôve directed everyone better. But we got creamed.‚Äù

Jamie nodded slowly, understanding his friend's frustration. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve always been a good team, Pete. You and me, we‚Äôve got a rhythm. But now we‚Äôre dealing with more than just a couple of bullies. We‚Äôve got a whole team, and a lot more at stake. It‚Äôs a different game.‚Äù

Peter nodded, his expression conflicted. He appreciated Jamie‚Äôs understanding, but the weight of responsibility was heavy on his shoulders.

‚ÄúI know. And it‚Äôs not just about fighting or making the right call in the heat of battle. It‚Äôs about knowing when to step back, when to let others take the lead on something. I‚Äôm not used to that. I‚Äôve always felt like I had to handle things myself, you know?‚Äù

Jamie picked up another record, this time Fleetwood Mac's Rumours, and glanced at it thoughtfully. He set it down and placed a hand on Peter‚Äôs shoulder, his voice gentle but firm.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre used to being the one who stands up, takes charge. But you‚Äôve got a team now. You‚Äôve got us. Think about how we used to handle things‚Äîhow we‚Äôd back each other up without even having to talk about it. It‚Äôs the same deal, just with more people. We‚Äôve got to trust each other, play to everyone‚Äôs strengths.‚Äù

Peter‚Äôs eyes met Jamie‚Äôs, a hint of frustration still lingering. He appreciated the advice, but doubt gnawed at him. He wasn‚Äôt sure he was up to the task of managing a team, especially when they all depended on him to lead.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ What if I make the wrong call again? What if someone gets hurt because I couldn‚Äôt figure it out fast enough? Zordon‚Äôs counting on us‚Äîon me‚Äîto keep everyone safe, and I don‚Äôt want to let him down. Or any of you.‚Äù

Jamie gave Peter a reassuring squeeze on the shoulder before letting go, his gaze steady and confident.

‚ÄúLook,‚Äù he took a breath to slow down his thoughts to make it simple for his friend,  ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not gonna get it perfect every time. None of us will. But you‚Äôve got the heart for this, Pete. You care about us, about doing what‚Äôs right. That‚Äôs what makes you a good leader. And we‚Äôre here to back you up. You don‚Äôt have to do it all alone. Remember how Zordon said we‚Äôre connected through the Grid? That means we‚Äôre in this together, no matter what. We just need to learn each other‚Äôs style.‚Äù

Peter felt a spark of determination rekindle in his chest. Jamie‚Äôs words made sense, and they resonated with something deeper. Maybe it wasn‚Äôt about having all the answers or making the perfect call every time. Maybe it was about trusting his team and learning together.

‚ÄúYeah, you‚Äôre right. We‚Äôve got to trust each other, lean on each other‚Äôs strengths. Thanks, Jamie. I needed that.‚Äù

Jamie grinned and gave Peter a light punch on the arm. ‚ÄúAnytime, man. Now, how about we pick out some records? I‚Äôve got a feeling some classic rock therapy is exactly what we need right now. I think Paxton‚Äôs even has a player there now..‚Äù

Peter chuckled, feeling the tension easing away. He turned his attention back to the records, grateful for his friend‚Äôs unwavering support and ready to face the next challenge.

‚Ä¶

Paxton‚Äôs Caf√©, just a couple doors down, was a cozy nook nestled at the corner of 5th Street, a sanctuary for the young and restless of Angel Grove. The caf√© buzzed with a relaxed energy, filled with the aroma of fresh coffee and the sound of soft indie music playing in the background. The walls were lined with colorful art and photographs, each telling a story of the town‚Äôs vibrant spirit.

At the counter, Paxton‚Äîthe lanky young man with tousled hair and a perpetual smile‚Äîwas busy preparing a complex order of lattes and cappuccinos. His movements were fluid, the result of years spent mastering his craft behind the espresso machine.

Seated nearby, Melody sketched intently, her eyes flicking up every few moments to capture Paxton‚Äôs concentrated expression. Her sketchbook, filled with an array of characters and scenes, lay open on the counter. Each pencil stroke brought the bustling scene to life, from the steam rising off the coffee to the warmth in Paxton‚Äôs eyes as he chatted with customers.

Wyatt sat next to her, tapping away at his phone. The glow from the screen reflected in his glasses as he navigated the download page for the game Skull had mentioned earlier. His fingers moved quickly, a slight frown of concentration on his face.

Paxton glanced up from his work, noticing the two at the counter. He finished topping off a caramel macchiato and slid it across to a waiting customer before turning his attention to Wyatt and Melody.

‚ÄúHey, you two. What‚Äôs the verdict on the game?‚Äù Paxton asked, leaning casually against the counter as he wiped his hands on a dish towel. His eyes flickered with curiosity.

Wyatt looked up from his phone, a small grin spreading across his face. ‚ÄúSkull‚Äôs been raving about it all week. He says it‚Äôs the next big thing. I‚Äôm just about to download it now. Gotta see what all the fuss is about.‚Äù

Paxton chuckled, glancing at Wyatt's phone. ‚ÄúBetter hope it lives up to the hype. Skull has a knack for picking out some real gems, but he‚Äôs not exactly the best judge of quality when it comes to games.‚Äù

Melody, with a playful smirk. ‚ÄúRemember when he convinced everyone to play Space Pirates? I think that was a solid week of our lives we‚Äôre never getting back. He tried getting other customers to join in with him.‚Äù

Paxton laughed, nodding in agreement. ‚ÄúYeah, that was‚Ä¶ something. But who knows? This one might be different.‚Äù Wyatt hit the download button and set his phone down, turning his attention to Melody's sketch.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got Paxton‚Äôs serious face down perfectly,‚Äù Wyatt remarked, tilting his head to get a better view of her work. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like you‚Äôve captured his whole barista essence in that sketch.‚Äù

Paxton grinned, peering over the counter to look at Melody‚Äôs drawing. ‚ÄúWell, if I‚Äôm going to be immortalized in art, I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs by someone with talent. Maybe I should start signing autographs now, get ahead of the fame.‚Äù

Melody looked up, a mischievous twinkle in her eye. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll make sure to put this on display once you‚Äôre famous. It‚Äôll be worth millions.‚Äù She added a few more details to her sketch, her pencil moving with practiced ease.

As the three of them chatted, the atmosphere at the caf√© seemed to lighten, a small haven of normalcy amid the chaos of their lives as Rangers. Wyatt‚Äôs phone buzzed, signaling the completion of the download. He picked it up, his excitement palpable.

‚ÄúAlright, let‚Äôs see what Skull‚Äôs been going on about,‚Äù Wyatt said, opening the game and starting it up. The screen lit up with vibrant colors and fast-paced music, drawing a few curious glances from nearby tables.

Paxton leaned in, his interest piqued. ‚ÄúSo, what‚Äôs the game about?‚Äù

Wyatt‚Äôs eyes widened as the game‚Äôs opening sequence played out. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs called Galactic Battles. You get to build your own fleet and conquer different planets. Looks like there are a bunch of missions and stuff. Pretty intense, actually.‚Äù

Paxton nodded, watching over Wyatt‚Äôs shoulder. ‚ÄúSounds like it could be a lot of fun. Just don‚Äôt let it eat up all your free time. You‚Äôve got a caf√© to visit and sketches to pose for, remember?‚Äù

Wyatt laughed, giving Paxton a thumbs-up. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôll make time for both.‚Äù

Melody, satisfied with her sketch, closed her notebook and stretched, a content smile on her face. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs always time for good coffee and friends. Speaking of which, Paxton, I could use a refill. Can I get another caramel latte?‚Äù

Paxton nodded, already moving to prepare her drink. ‚ÄúComing right up. And I expect a new sketch in return. Maybe something that makes me look more heroic, like a barista warrior or something.‚Äù

Melody laughed, nodding. ‚ÄúDeal. I‚Äôll make sure you‚Äôre the hero of the caf√©.‚Äù

As Paxton prepared Melody‚Äôs drink, the camaraderie between them felt natural, a stark contrast to the tensions and challenges of their Ranger duties. The conversations flowed easily, filled with the kind of banter that only close friends shared. It was a moment of respite, a chance to reconnect with their everyday lives, even as the responsibilities of being Rangers loomed in the background.

The door swung open, and Peter and Jamie stepped inside. A small bell above the entrance jingled, announcing their arrival. Peter scanned the room, spotting their friends at the counter and making his way over, followed closely by Jamie.

‚ÄúHey, look who decided to join us!‚Äù Paxton called out with a welcoming grin, wiping his hands on a towel before tossing it over his shoulder.

Peter smiled back, offering a casual wave. ‚ÄúCouldn‚Äôt miss out on the best coffee in town.‚Äù His gaze shifted to Wyatt, noticing the way his friend shifted uncomfortably in his seat. ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs it going, Wyatt?‚Äù he held up his phone as if to imply he got a text from Melody, ‚ÄúHeard you were getting into some new game.‚Äù

Wyatt looked up from his phone, managing a small smile despite the discomfort etched on his face. ‚ÄúYeah, Skull‚Äôs latest obsession got me curious. It‚Äôs called Galactic Battles. Just started checking it out.‚Äù

Jamie nodded, glancing at the phone‚Äôs screen with mild interest before leaning closer to Wyatt, lowering his voice. ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs the side? That was a nasty hit you took in the simulation.‚Äù

Wyatt‚Äôs expression tightened briefly, his hand instinctively moving to his side where the pain still lingered. He cast a quick glance around, ensuring Paxton was preoccupied with Melody‚Äôs order before replying softly, ‚ÄúStill sore. That holo-monster really packed a punch. But I‚Äôll be fine. Just need a bit of time to shake it off.‚Äù

Peter exchanged a knowing look with Jamie, concern evident in his eyes. ‚ÄúWe need you in top shape, Wyatt. You took a hard blow today. Maybe we should figure out a way to keep you safer in these training sessions.‚Äù

Wyatt nodded, though there was a hint of frustration in his voice. ‚ÄúYeah, I know. I‚Äôm just not exactly the fighting type. Never have been.‚Äù

Jamie, always the tactician, leaned back, considering Wyatt‚Äôs words. ‚ÄúThat may be true, but we can work on that. You‚Äôve got other strengths, but we need to make sure you can handle yourself when things get rough. How about we spend some time working on your combat skills? I could teach you a few things‚Äîhow to throw a punch, how to defend yourself better. Doesn‚Äôt have to be anything fancy, just the basics to give you more confidence.‚Äù

Wyatt‚Äôs eyes flickered with a mix of apprehension and gratitude. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd do that? I mean, I don‚Äôt want to be a burden.‚Äù

Peter placed a reassuring hand on Wyatt‚Äôs shoulder, giving it a gentle squeeze. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not a burden, Wyatt. We‚Äôre a team, and we‚Äôve all got each other‚Äôs backs. If Jamie can help you feel more confident out there, then it‚Äôs worth it.‚Äù

Wyatt managed a more genuine smile this time, nodding appreciatively. ‚ÄúAlright, I‚Äôm in. I could use all the help I can get.‚Äù

At that moment, Paxton returned with Melody‚Äôs drink, setting it down with a flourish. ‚ÄúOne caramel latte, as requested. And I see we‚Äôve got a full house now. Can I get you guys anything?‚Äù

Peter and Jamie exchanged a quick glance before turning back to Paxton. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll take a couple of your specials,‚Äù Peter said, smiling. ‚ÄúWhatever‚Äôs good today.‚Äù

Paxton nodded, already moving to prepare their order. ‚ÄúYou got it. Two specials, coming right up.‚Äù

As Paxton busied himself behind the counter, Melody leaned over, her sketchbook tucked under her arm. ‚ÄúI messaged Kaylee earlier. She‚Äôs out for a run this morning. Is she normally the marathon runner she appears to be, Wyatt?‚Äù

Wyatt chuckled, shaking his head as he glanced up from his phone. ‚ÄúOh, absolutely. Kaylee‚Äôs always been the athletic one. Track star at school and all that. She‚Äôs the type who runs five miles before breakfast and thinks it‚Äôs fun. I‚Äôm more of a ‚Äòwatch the marathon on TV‚Äô kind of guy.‚Äù

Melody laughed, flipping through her sketchbook. ‚ÄúI can see that. She‚Äôs got energy to spare, that‚Äôs for sure. I‚Äôm surprised she doesn‚Äôt try to drag us all along on her runs.‚Äù

Wyatt grinned, leaning back on his stool. ‚ÄúOh, she‚Äôs tried. But trust me, keeping up with Kaylee on a run is like trying to keep up with a cheetah. It‚Äôs not happening unless you‚Äôre crazy enough to be on the track team with her.‚Äù

Wyatt‚Äôs phone switched from his game to a pink screen with Kaylee‚Äôs name across it. ‚ÄúSpeaking of‚ÄîHey Kay, what‚Äôs up?‚Äù Her voice was loud enough to be heard by the others.

‚ÄúGuys, there are more of those Putty things in Valley Park! No one has shown up yet but there‚Äôs people getting attacked! Hurry!‚Äù she explained, then hung up.

‚ÄúWe gotta go! Valley Park!‚Äù Wyatt put his phone away. They gathered up their things.

‚ÄúSorry Paxton, we gotta run.‚Äù Jamie pulled a five-dollar bill out and threw it in the tip jar. ‚ÄúFor the trouble.‚Äù And they ran off to help Kaylee.

The barista, with a concerned look on his face, watched as the teens rushed out of the doorway. ‚ÄúOh, to be ten years younger again‚Ä¶maybe a bit more,‚Äù he chuckled to himself, alone but for the music playing in the background.

‚Ä¶

The sun was just starting to climb higher in the sky, casting long shadows across Valley Park. It was a deceptively peaceful morning, with joggers making their rounds and families setting up for picnics, unaware of the impending danger. The calm was abruptly shattered by the appearance of the Putties‚Äîgray, amorphous beings that moved with a menacing purpose, scattering the park‚Äôs visitors in a panic.

Kaylee stood near the park's central fountain, her eyes scanning the area for any sign of her friends. She clenched her fists, the urgency of the situation making her heart pound. She had already engaged a few Putties to buy time, but their numbers seemed to be growing.

A blur of color caught her eye as Peter, Jamie, Wyatt, and Melody came sprinting down the main path toward her, determination etched on their faces.

""Kaylee!"" Peter called out, waving to get her attention as they closed the distance.

‚ÄúOver here!‚Äù Kaylee waved back, a mix of relief and urgency in her voice. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got to get these people to safety and take care of these Putties!‚Äù

Peter nodded, quickly assessing the situation. ‚ÄúAlright guys, let‚Äôs do this. It‚Äôs Morphin‚Äô Time!‚Äù The Rangers stood in formation as their transformation sequence initiated. Radiant energy glowed around their forms as the bio-alloy armor spread across their bodies, and ended in a collected formation battle stance.

‚ÄúJamie, Wyatt‚Äîhelp clear the area. Get everyone to a safe spot. Melody, Kaylee, and I will hold them off until the coast is clear.‚Äù

Wyatt, wincing slightly as he clutched his side, gave a determined nod. ‚ÄúOn it!‚Äù He moved swiftly, guiding a group of frightened park-goers toward the nearest exit.

Jamie joined him, his voice calm but firm as he directed people away from the danger. ‚ÄúStay close, move quickly! You‚Äôll be safe this way!‚Äù

Meanwhile, Peter, Melody, and Kaylee squared off against the advancing Putties. The creatures moved with a jerky, unpredictable gait, but their strength and numbers made them formidable.

Peter took the lead, his movements precise and controlled. He blocked a Putty‚Äôs attack with his forearm and countered with a powerful kick that sent the creature sprawling. ‚ÄúStick together and watch each other‚Äôs backs! Kaylee, behind you!‚Äù he shouted over the chaos.

Kaylee ducked under a sweeping blow from another Putty, retaliating with a swift punch to its midsection. ‚ÄúThese things just keep coming! Any idea how to slow them down?‚Äù

Melody materialized her blaster and moved with surprising agility. She dodged a Putty‚Äôs grasp and struck back with a series of quick shots, forcing it to crumble and decay. ‚ÄúIf we can keep them contained here, it‚Äôll give Jamie and Wyatt time to get the civilians out!‚Äù

Wyatt and Jamie returned, having successfully cleared the immediate area of civilians. Wyatt, though visibly in pain, joined the fray without hesitation. He parried a Putty‚Äôs attack and landed a solid punch across its face that knocked it off balance. Jamie followed suit, his moves calculated as he bulldozed his way into the creature‚Äôs torso, disabling it until it shattered when it struck the ground.

Peter caught Wyatt‚Äôs eye, nodding approvingly. ‚ÄúNice work, Wyatt. Keep it up!‚Äù

Wyatt‚Äôs expression under his visor was one of newfound confidence. ‚ÄúThanks! I‚Äôm doing my best!‚Äù

The team fought with a synchronized rhythm, each member‚Äôs strengths complementing the others. They worked together seamlessly, their bond as Rangers growing stronger with every coordinated strike and defensive maneuver. Despite the overwhelming odds, their unity made them a formidable force.

Just as they were starting to gain the upper hand, a shadow loomed over the park. A giant, menacing figure of gold emerged from behind the trees‚Äîa hulking, monstrous Goldar. His eyes glowed with an eerie red light as he bellowed a challenging roar, his presence radiating malevolence.

Peter glanced at the team, his expression grim but resolute. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got a bigger problem now.‚Äù Alpha‚Äôs voice chimed in over the helmet‚Äôs intercoms.

‚ÄúRangers, Goldar has achieved enlarged staggering heights thanks to Rita‚Äôs abilities. It is time to call upon the gigantic machinery based on your designated beasts known as Zords.‚Äù

Peter quickly gathered the team around him, his visor displaying visual designs of five hulking mechanical animals that could form a combined structure. He raised his hand to the air and commanded, ‚ÄúWe need Mega Zord power, now!‚Äù

Back in 2024, Auau and Save kicked things off in DMD Friendship: It Takes Two. When they chose each other as partners, their playful giggles lit up the screen.

It‚Äôs like they found their rhythm.
Behind the scenes, their bond shines even brighter. Auau‚Äôs got this habit of sneaking Save coffee on set, calling it their ‚Äúsurvival ritual.‚Äù Save, in turn, cheers Auau up after long shoot days, even when he‚Äôs exhausted. These little acts scream friendship goals. It‚Äôs proof they get each other on a whole new level.
Now, let‚Äôs talk about that look. Early on, Auau played it cool, like he was trying to keep his chill vibe. But now? His gaze on Save is pure warmth, almost protective. Fans pointed out how Auau‚Äôs eyes light up around Save, lingering just a bit longer. It‚Äôs gone from ‚ÄúI‚Äôm too cool for this‚Äù to full-on heart-eyes, and it‚Äôs melting us all.
How Close Are They Now?

1l6kqdr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l6kqdr,What I'm feeding my family of 5 this week for $125,"\*Photos are items I made while prep cooking for the upcoming week.\*

We are a family of 5 (2 adults & 3 teen kids) living in a large urban area in the Midwest. Our grocery budget is $500 a month, which breaks down to about $125 per week.



We have no major food allergies and aren‚Äôt following any special diets. Our goal is to provide filling, reasonably healthy meals without breaking the bank.



By shopping sales and stocking our pantry, I can keep our weekly grocery costs around $125. Even if you were to input all the ingredients needed for this week‚Äôs meals into the Walmart app (a store accessible to most in the US), it would only cost about $180 if you had absolutely \*\*nothing\*\* in your kitchen except salt and pepper. Keep in mind that many of the items from the $180 list can be used in future meals as well (e.g., cinnamon, ginger, soy sauce, flour, sugar, oil, etc.).



Here are some strategies I use to keep our grocery bill reasonable:



\- \*\*Know Price Points:\*\* We track the prices of our most commonly used items and only buy when they are at or below that price. The lower the price, the more we stock up.

\- \*\*Look for Clearance:\*\* I keep an eye out for clearance meat, produce, and bakery items while shopping.

\- \*\*Price Compare:\*\* I shop between multiple stores to find the best deals.

\- \*\*Stick to a List:\*\* I shop with a plan in mind and stick to my list!

\- \*\*Cook from Scratch:\*\* We lean towards being an ‚Äúingredient household‚Äù and cook a lot from scratch.

We have some people we will be visiting with but I'd love to hear recommendations for... 

- cute neighborhood for a good coffee, maybe some thriffting or bookstores around 

- a ""must try"" restaurant that might be a bit of a splurge but it's worth it 

- what to avoid during the holiday weekend 

- Whidby Island recommendations! May try to do a visit or overnight one of the days 

About us: we're late 30s, not into ""insta"" spots (aka more about looks than substance), foodies, enjoy good, simple coffee, not into street festivals. We love having a slow morning with a coffee, a crossword and book. Love art and music, history and architecture. We really like wine too!",2,1749411159.0,AskSeattle,6,1.0,False

Then I joined a chaotic voice chat, and what happened next changed how I see loneliness forever...","It was exactly 3:00 a.m. ‚Äî the hour the mechanical keeper of time calls liminal, a fragile sliver suspended between the remnants of yesterday and the unknown promise of tomorrow. Outside, the world was mostly asleep, surrendered to dreams and darkness. But inside me, restlessness stirred ‚Äî a hunger not for food, but for something deeper, something unnamed.

I rose from the foam slab that served as my bed, the thin mattress pressed cold against my back. My body felt heavy with fatigue, but my mind was alive ‚Äî chasing shadows, circling thoughts that refused to settle. The house was silent, save for the distant hum of electronics and the soft creak of a settling floorboard.

Drawn by habit and need, I padded softly to the kitchen. The air smelled faintly of cold and the lingering aroma of yesterday‚Äôs coffee. My hands, still shaking slightly from the night‚Äôs restless energy, reached for the rectangular box resting on the counter ‚Äî a box full of colorful lies and childhood promises. Cereal.

I poured the tiny, sugar-coated fragments into a ceramic bowl, their crispness a sharp contrast to the stale quiet of the house. From the fridge, I grabbed the carton of milk, cool to the touch, and slowly poured it over the cereal. The dry crunch surrendered to the creamy flood, dissolving into soggy sweetness.

As I raised the spoon to my mouth, I tasted more than just sugar and grain. I tasted memories: mornings past, laughter faded, the ache of solitude pressing close. Each bite was a small rebellion against the silence, a ritual to hold myself together in the absence of anything else.

Finished, I carried the empty bowl to the sink and rinsed it in the cold water. The house felt colder now, emptier, but the glow from my bedroom awaited ‚Äî a small beacon in the dark.

I settled before my glowing shrine: the computer. The portal to another world, where millions gathered in fragmented connection, united only by pixels and soundwaves.

Discord opened with a familiar chill. I scrolled through my list of channels until I found one labeled with chaotic symbols and emojis ‚Äî ‚ÄúVC LOBBY üòàüî•üå™Ô∏è.‚Äù

I clicked in.

Immediately, I was swallowed by noise.

One voice was ragged, breathy ‚Äî a person breathing hard, close to the microphone, as if gasping for life itself. Another blared trap music, low-quality and relentless, shaking the digital walls of the channel. A third voice ranted about the latest anime betrayals ‚Äî the kind of melodrama that felt both silly and painfully real.

Somewhere, the sharp beep of a microwave sliced through the chaos, a reminder of mundane reality hidden behind digital masks.

I remained silent, muted, an invisible presence in the cacophony. To speak was to risk rejection or ridicule ‚Äî or worse, just being ignored. Still, I wanted in. I craved connection, even this fractured, messy kind.

After long seconds of hesitation, I typed a simple ‚Äúyo‚Äù into the chat, then unmuted to let the word slip out.

Nothing.

My voice was lost in the storm of sound and typing ‚Äî drowned beneath mechanical keyboards clicking furiously and overlapping debates on fictional betrayals and very real mental breakdowns.

Still, I stayed.

Something about this chaos felt alive ‚Äî raw and messy, but alive. It was like shouting into a vast canyon and hearing dozens of unrelated screams bounce back. The noise was disorienting, but also strangely comforting.

Minutes passed. Voices flared and faded. People came and went. I listened to their stories ‚Äî some joyful, some bitter, others despairing. I glimpsed fragments of lives that felt both distant and familiar.

A user named ‚ÄúGhostlyEcho‚Äù told a story of lost love and betrayal, her voice trembling with the weight of memory.

Another, ‚ÄúTrapKing420,‚Äù shared a silly meme that made half the channel laugh, breaking the tension.

I typed a few more words, unsure if anyone heard. Gradually, the noise shifted ‚Äî quieter now, more human. Someone asked me about my day, and for the first time, I answered.

We talked ‚Äî briefly, awkwardly ‚Äî about music, loneliness, the strange rituals we all keep to stave off the creeping void.

I realized this was my community. This digital refuge where strangers became momentary companions, where isolation was met with fragmented connection.

The clock ticked toward dawn. The house remained silent, except for the faint humming of the world waking.

Nourished by cold cereal and the fractured warmth of voices across the ether, I felt something shift inside me ‚Äî a fragile hope, a thread of belonging.

I logged off, the screen darkening, and returned to my bed ‚Äî not to peaceful sleep, but to the restless rhythm of insomnia and overstimulation.

Such is the modern ceremony of existence: an endless dance between solitude and connection, chaos and comfort, darkness and the faint glow of human voices.",1,1749410929.0,u_ajdelacruzyyc,0,1.0,False

What sets them apart:

	‚Ä¢	Ethically sourced beans
	‚Ä¢	You can actually taste the difference in espresso or pour-over
	‚Ä¢	Local delivery

It was a lazy Friday morning. I had no work meetings, no real responsibilities, just vibes. I took a long shower, made a cup of coffee, and decided it was a ""walk around the apartment naked while pretending to be a rockstar"" kind of day. I had Prince blasting, I was doing dramatic air guitar solos, and life was good.

Mid-shimmy, my phone buzzed. It was a Zoom link from my neighbor Sarah. Now, Sarah had asked me a while ago if I wanted to help with her community outreach group. I said sure, assuming it was just a group chat where people complained about potholes and posted pictures of lost cats. Apparently, this Friday was their big planning meeting. And I, in my infinite wisdom, tapped the link without thinking.

Zoom opened. My webcam turned on instantly. And there I was, in all my unholy naked glory, beamed directly into a meeting of about fifteen very startled community members.

I saw Sarah gasp. An old man actually dropped his glasses. One woman let out an audible ‚ÄúOh my God.‚Äù A dog started barking. And smack in the middle of the screen, I locked eyes with none other than the actual mayor of our town. He blinked, paused, and calmly said, ‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs certainly one way to make an entrance.‚Äù

I finally managed to slap the laptop closed‚Ä¶ and immediately lost Wi-Fi. So now, as far as they know, I rage-quit the call naked and possibly offended at their agenda on sidewalk improvements.

I thought that was the end of it. I was ready to move, change my name, join a traveling circus, whatever it took. But yesterday, I got an official email from the board. They‚Äôve appointed me Chair of Digital Outreach.

Apparently, they ‚Äúadmire my boldness.‚Äù",1,1749410774.0,Superfunnystories,0,1.0,False

This is something I've come to see on myself and some others spiritually. I had an astral projection experience about 6 months or a year ago, and it appeared to be some kind of test. The 'meeting' continued on after I returned to my body (I'm sure of it), and later I had the impression of a sigil or symbol that pierced right through me with a red glow. I've had a sense of it on me ever since.

I try not to assume things I sense/see or experience are definitely real and instead tend to remain open to the possibility that I'm wrong.

I sensed a similar red glowing sigil on a man today when I was out at the coffee shop, only it was on his neck. And another white, integrated one on somebody I know.

In the past, I wasn't one who could really see auras, but in my mind's eye, these are very clear to see. I suspect mine is associated with reaching 4th density (as per the Law of One), but I'm not sure. Does anyone else see these and what do you feel they mean?",3,1749410397.0,lawofone,5,1.0,False

Long story short I'm applying to jobs in cafe, coffee, and food service this summer and need to deal with the large gaps in my resume. I'm thinking of saying I worked most of a year at a job I only had for about two and a half months. I have spent a lot of time in the last three years traveling, and typically working at jobs for 2-3mo when I need cash before moving on. When the gap in my resume was just a year it was a fun interview question that usually got positive responses and I've never had trouble landing work. At this point, though, the gap is pretty egregious. 



One of the last jobs I worked was a great gig that offered me a management role within a month of on-boarding, and I have a pretty compelling interview story I can tell about my experiences and skills acquisition working there. Having supervisory/management/training experience on my resume is super valuable, so it was a real windfall. Great, except since I skipped out on that job after a couple months (now almost a year ago) I don't feel good about putting it on my resume.

  
I'm trying to figure out the best way to get this job experience/""story"" onto my resume without making it super easy to falsify. *I'd* have no trouble keeping my story straight in the interview and on the job, since it's built on the bones of real experiences, but I'm concerned that putting a real business name on my resume with fake start and end dates will result in rescinded offers if any jobs run more than your typical criminal background checks and reference calls (obviously I will use a fake reference with a coached story). If this were a white collar office type job search it would obviously be a no-go since they could just call the company's HR department and verify my employment history, but since it'll be food service I can't really guess how likely I am to get caught.

  
Is there a smarter way to bulk out my recent employment history? I'm not crazy that it's a terrible idea to put the jobs I've skipped out on after making some quick cash on my resume right? How likely is a cafe hiring manager to actually call the brick-and-mortar cafe 2000 miles away rather than just call the listed reference for my direct report?

Organisers of Edinburgh fringe events have been urged to be ‚Äúpretty smart‚Äù and capitalise on the decision by Oasis and AC/DC to play gigs in the city midway through the festival.



There was surprise and irritation when it emerged the bands would be staging four concerts at Murrayfield stadium in mid-August when the world‚Äôs largest arts festival is in full flow.



Tony Lankester, who recently took over as the Fringe Society‚Äôs chief executive, said fringe companies should see the concerts as an opportunity rather than fret about downsides.



About 75,000 fans are expected for each concert ‚Äì three by Oasis and one by AC/DC, putting the city‚Äôs trains, buses and trams under even greater strain, with visitors competing for already scarce and expensive hotel beds.

Lankester, who previously ran South Africa‚Äôs national arts festival, said fringe venues should tempt Edinburgh residents who may ‚Äúwant to hide‚Äù when the concerts take place with discounted tickets or free wine.

Venues could also tempt Oasis and AC/DC concertgoers with ‚Äúmorning after‚Äù performances in the city with free bacon rolls and coffee, he suggested. ‚ÄúWhat we don‚Äôt want to happen is for the local audience to hide that night,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs some pretty smart marketing type things that I think venues could be looking at. The fact is that it‚Äôs not going away. Why not be completely opportunistic about it?‚Äù

This year‚Äôs fringe, which runs from 1 to 25 Augustand takes place alongside the international festival and book festival, is expected to involve about 50,000 performances at 265 venues.

Lankester said the strength of the programme, which includes themes such as rebellious women, the apocalypse, queer joy and rave culture, showed artists were as hungry as ever to perform despite global crises and tensions. ‚ÄúWhat excites me most about the programme, is the signal that it sends is of an industry in healthy shape,‚Äù he said.

For the first time, five shows from US performers are being underwritten by donors to the Keep it Fringe funding strand launched in 2023 by the Fleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge, the fringe‚Äôs honorary president, to support new, marginalised or innovative acts.

Lankester said he had numerous conversations that ‚Äúreaffirmed for me what I knew coming into this job, that there‚Äôs a lot of love and joy around the fringe. It‚Äôs something that people absolutely want to preserve, protect, engage with, be part of. It‚Äôs still on an incredible number of people‚Äôs bucket lists.‚Äù

He said he was talking to major brands about the potential to become headline sponsors of the fringe for the first time, to bring in extra revenue for performers and venues at a time of intense pressure on public funding. He said those discussions were at an early stage, but indicated it could involve a bank or beer brand. No sponsor would be allowed to rebrand the fringe, but their investments would help the festival to improve its finances.

In her last newspaper interview, Shona McCarthy, Lankester‚Äôs immediate predecessor, accused political leaders of consistently neglecting the fringe and failing to adequately invest in services, transport and infrastructure such as mobile phone services.



Lankester said he ‚Äústood by‚Äù everything McCarthy had said. Her ‚Äúenormously valuable‚Äù intervention had fuelled action and more responsiveness in the council, the Scottish government and other agencies, he said, adding: ‚ÄúThe message landed.‚Äù



Lankester is lobbying Edinburgh council to devote at least ¬£1.1m of a new visitor levy on hotel beds to supporting the festival, and is in talks about strengthening the city‚Äôs ailing mobile and wifi services, as well as improved rail services for non-residents.



The visitor levy will come into force in July 2026, but hotels will begin collecting it on all bookings made from October this year. ‚ÄúWhat we don‚Äôt want to happen is for that money to sort of disappear into a black hole and for no benefit to be felt by the people \[who\] drive a big chunk of that revenue,‚Äù he said.",2,1749409987.0,edinburghfringe,1,1.0,False

My fianc√© and I are trying to come up with ideas on how to set our living room up. I have a 40 inch OLED that I game on and was planning on getting a 65 inch mini led for her to watch shows and occasionally game on. We need two entertainment centers also.

My question is do we get different or identical entertainment centers, and what would look better? The tvs side by side or on separate walls?

The couch, coffee table, and side table are going to be moved around. The 65 in will be going on the brown side wall with the couch facing it directly.",1,1749409880.0,interiordecorating,3,1.0,False

I did a subjective ANC comparison between my headphones some days ago. Now, via SoundGuys web measurments, I made some comparisons of the QC and QC Ultra ANC against their competitors (Past Bose generations, Apple, Sony, Sennheiser, B&W, etc) But for some context...

https://preview.redd.it/85i7u54k6r5f1.jpg?width=1017&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ca74ed96826ea7bab8d29fe0a6fec327d40bb92a

This is a chart of the frecuency response range, the Low Bass - Upper Bass (20Hz - 200Hz aprox) Is where all the rumbles, vibration lives, also stuff like massive background chatter. All the midrange zone (500Hz-4000Hz) is where the most of the human voices and some constant noises live and the Treble (4000Hz-20000Hz) is where the sudden noises and the high pitched noises live, like the ones you find on a coffee shop.

So yeah, there you go, now you can understand better the next comparisons of the latest 2 Bose models and see how they compare to the competition and their brothers from the past...

It could be that the lesser fat one is ok too, but I use the 3.5% because I buy it to use in my coffee as well and the other one was like water to me.

To be honest, I only tried other brands in coffee, so it could be that they would actually be fine for cooking and baking too. Oatly wasn't bad, but I think I paid more for it. So, all around I like the Alpro. But that's just my opinion, of course.

Anyway, I just thought I'd share in case anyone found that helpful.

Also, here is an example of one recipe that I use it for all the time (I literally make this every week for my kids).

It's as mundane as rainbow coffee, convenience stores, blanc tresh...

Workers work, not for the client, but because it's a dope app ttk equivalent (where they earn wages). They live on ""likes"" and ""follows"" and ""moolah"" and are riddled with complexities from their own childhood. They are there to feel good and impress their employers for raises and recognition.

Internet research hasn‚Äôt shown much in terms of inspiration or direction. The thing is, we have no idea what to do with it after a year of living in the house.

The basement has a bar to the right (revitalizing a tiki bar vibe) and a hangout area to the left (couch, coffee table, shag rug, tv etc). The basement as a whole definitely needs some fresh paint and much needed floor love. We used the rock garden to house our Christmas tree last year, and it was cute but not a forever fix.

I could take Dramamine and cope if it is not too hilly of a drive. If you‚Äôve done the drive, did you notice your ears popping?

We eventually started to get together. We were really close. Then she developed some mental health issues, and took time off from work. She also had some other health issues. So things kind of stopped and it seemed her mental health was getting worse over a year. she was diagnosed with depression, OCD, and Borderline Personality Disorder. A couple decades prior her ex husband had left her and her daughter on the doorstep of her parents years before. About half a decade her own daughter stopped talking to her. I had always beleived her side of the story. 

One day I'm traveling down to visit my folks, and messaged her to see about grabbing a coffee. No response. Then a week later, I get a text, she has moved. I ask a lot of questions and no response. I reach out to her parents, and all they will tell me they are not at liberty to say, but she is safe.

Weeks later I finally hear from her, and apparently she is living with a guy I never knew about she told me she had met him a year ago, and how wonderful her life is now. When things stopped with us she had told me it's her health and that she still loved me. In reality she met this guy. She never once told me her feelings toward me had changed or that she was seeing someone else, for over a whole year. She kept this so secret nobody else knew. She wanted me to be happy for her, and all that. I just couldn't process how much I was lied too. We weren't officially in a relationship, however, I felt I deserved the truth from the very beginning. I felt a trust and a friendship of 30 years was just completely thrown away.

1l6jxws,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1l6jxws/aio_about_how_my_bf_responded_to_me_saying_i_dont/,AIO about how my bf responded to me saying I don‚Äôt want a trash can in every room forever?,"
I am a 27f and my bf is a 27m. We have lived together for a little over a year now and he likes to keep a trash can in every room, including the living room, right next to the coffee table. It kind of annoys me because I hope to have a home with nice decor and a nice aesthetic. I‚Äôve always wanted that and the trash cans just bother me. Yesterday I told him it bothers me and he basically just dismissed it. Then today when I was doing dishes I basically said it again, in a relaxed tone like ‚Äúbabe but seriously I really don‚Äôt want to have a trash can in every room forever.‚Äù He asked why (I could tell this annoyed him immediately) and I just said because it‚Äôs an eye sore and one day I would like to have a home that looks nice and I feel like the trash cans are ugly.

He said we‚Äôd cross that bridge when we got to it, and I said ‚Äúwe‚Äôre already there‚Äù because it seems like this is something that really annoyed him so I felt like we needed to talk about it.

He starts trying to discredit what I‚Äôm saying by saying I ‚Äúgrew up in an interesting situation‚Äù.. the situation is that I‚Äôm middle eastern and I‚Äôm really close to my family. He thinks this is weird and says I‚Äôm dependent on them because of our relationship. And as usual, took the first opportunity to throw a jab. Then he says we don‚Äôt have a trash cans in every room, we don‚Äôt have one in the bedroom. I reflected and agreed, and switched my point to living room only. He said then that I was ‚Äúswitching up and don‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôm saying‚Äù because I switched from every room to living room. 

He then asked me for examples of people whose homes I‚Äôve been to (specifically not allowed to mention family cause apparently they‚Äôre weird) who don‚Äôt have a trash can in their living room and I have 2 examples. They were about 3 years ago so he said there‚Äôs no way I could remember that and I‚Äôm just saying shit to try to prove my point but that I don‚Äôt actually know. He‚Äôs already raising his voice at me at this point and I told him I don‚Äôt like how he talks to me and we can never have a productive conversation because he just tries to discredit me or make it seem like what I‚Äôm saying is dumb. He then said everything I care about is dumb. He said this multiple times.

I was saying i just don‚Äôt like the look and the kitchen trashcan is not even 10 feet away in the same room. I told him it just looks out of place and not nice. He snarkily said I have stuff in the living room out of place so I‚Äôm not one to talk. I occasionally have shoes or a basket of clothes out there, as does he. We‚Äôre both busy, I‚Äôm an attorney who works a full time job and he does too, in corporate. I told him I didn‚Äôt think we should just do things to make it even worse then. He again made snarky comments. 

I again told him I hate how he talks to me and he kept saying ‚ÄúDO SOMETHING ABOUT IT THEN‚Äù repeatedly like 10 times from the couch while I was behind him in the kitchen doing the dishes. I just didn‚Äôt know what to say. He said he‚Äôs saying this because I‚Äôve said this before and he‚Äôs tried to be aware of it but clearly it‚Äôs not enough for me and I need to do something about it. I told him I can‚Äôt believe he‚Äôs talking to me like this and I would never be so disrespectful to him and he didn‚Äôt have much to say. He eventually got up and left and is on a walk right now. 

I want to preface this by saying he‚Äôs not abusive and he‚Äôs not just a terrible person. He‚Äôs a great guy and we genuinely love each other a lot and 95% of the time are happy with each other, but for some reason in situations like these, he just gets really annoyed and lashes out be being petty and kind of disrespectful. I wasn‚Äôt trying to just pick at him, I just wanted to communicate that I hope one day to have a home where we can have nice decor and be aware of little things like that. AIO?

Even if you don't like coffee, get tea or something. There are a lot of reasons for this:

1) If you don't like them or they are creepy, it's easy to extricate yourself 

2) You're less likely to get someone who's not really interested in dating because a coffee shop is not a sex guarantee.

3) You're  both less likely to do something stupid then if you were drinking alcohol instead.

4) A restaurant is not as good a choice because you can talk to them less and get to know them less. Furthermore, if you end up kissing them, you don't want to risk having some strange flavor in your mouth for your first kiss. 

5) A movie is not a good choice for a first date because you're unable to talk to them and interact with them during it.

6) It's easy to extend the date if you are having a good time. Choose a coffee shop that is next to a park or something and ask if they want to go to a walk. If this goes well,  _then_ going to a movie or restaurant or their apartment or bowling or whatever becomes a better idea.

1l6jsta,https://www.reddit.com/r/Experiencers/comments/1l6jsta/my_experience/,My experience.,"Greetings to everyone here. I have... toyed with the idea of sharing this or not because it sounds absolutely insane. I thought it was insane. And yet the pull to share my experience has been increasingly grating on my mind, so here we are. The only thing I ask, humbly, is that no one is rude to me or says hurtful things. That's all, and I greatly appreciate the kindness I do receive. This is a long one, but I want to give all the information I have, and I remember it and them so well. My friends, they liked being called that.

I'll start from the beginning of the issue I started to have, which was around a couple of years ago now. I am a woman, and I don't know why it started, but chronic UTI/bladder pain started when I've never had it before. I am clean, and I drank water. Still, after a couple of years, the antibiotics didn't really help. I am not one to go into debt in the American health system, so I said, ""Well, if I die, I die. No more bills, stress, or the hatred of the world!"" If you know, you know.

Anyway, coming back to a couple of months ago, I was in constant, heavy pain that nothing helped anymore. I was at the end of my rope, extremely close to just going into debt for my entire life and hoping it was an easy fix or a release. But I didn't have to. When you live in that kind of pain constantly, you become a bit... distraught and beg the Universe for help.

Something told me to take a few of my medicinal candies to help take the edge off the pain in my bladder and lower back, radiating up to my shoulders and even heart at that point. It's a strange feeling, thinking back on it. But I did; I ate 3, and within 20 minutes I needed to lie down immediately. My body began shaking as if I would combust (I'm seasoned in medicinal green), and it threw me off. Then, my heart and the top of my head began to vibrate in a way I cannot put into words.

My entire body tensed up then, shaking uncontrollably, and my eyes forced themselves shut just to ground myself. I remember the way I was confused within my mind, my voice frantic and wondering if I'm just losing it. The TV was on some random YouTube video. I forgot to turn my Bluetooth speaker off in the other room. It was just loud and everywhere. Then it started, first with some voices. I will type it exactly as I heard it, and my responses in between, though they were completely mental, not vocal.

G1: ""So much stimulation.""  
G2: ""Why do they need stimulation like this?""  
G1: ""It's incredibly human, is it not?""  
Me: ""Oh, great, I am crazy. I shouldn't have taken these. I need to get up.""

But I could not move. I could only shake, stiffen further, and experience what I thought was a heart attack/stroke at once. This is dramatic, of course, but at that moment I really felt like I was losing it or dying. Maybe both.

I started to feel like I was about to lurch out of my body upward, and I fought that feeling horribly. Until I caught just a glimpse of him within my mind's eye, akin to a wave of image and color. A beautiful, green Mantid being stood over me and reached out with his limb and merely said, ""Calm."" It went through my forehead, but I felt no pain. In fact, I went slack on my couch, the shaking ceased, and all the pain was more of a... pulse? I was keenly aware of where it was coming from now, in the center of my bladder, and it felt thick. Not right. Poison, that was the word that came to my mind.

Then, I saw brief flashes of Greys, maybe four in total, around me. Physical reality did not dictate how they stood. It's as if my couch, wall, and coffee table did not exist to them. While my eyes were closed, I remember becoming confused as to how they were standing inside my furniture, if my house was clean enough to welcome them... should I make snacks?! They smiled, not with their mouths, but I felt it and their amusement. It made me smile, my cheeks burn hot, and my heart swell with a sense of knowing.

G2 or 3: ""You're going to help us help you. Put your hands where they move, and focus.""  
Me: ""Is this real? There's no way I'm worthy of meeting ya'll. I know a few countries that desperately need you. Not me!""  
Mantid: ""Do you trust us?""  
G1 and G2: ""We need trust; we cannot do this otherwise.""

The TV plays a loud ad, and my focus breaks for a moment and then the shaking comes back. The Mantid, while patient and extremely gentle, seemed to be agitated by the ""stimulation"" in my home and had to ""Calm."" me again. Then, I recited my trust over and over as if I'd known them my entire life. Or perhaps it was simply my desperation to stop this maddening pain inside me.

My hand moved to my crotch, the other to my bladder without thought, and when I tell you I felt dirty placing my hand there in front of them... I wanted to hide under a rock. ""Humanity is far too modest about the vessel. We do not judge you; you do not judge us.""

Finally, I settled back into peace and calm, though the other half of me was trying so hard to focus on their physical image, so to speak. The warmth and explosion I felt inside my body are indescribable, and I was instructed to breathe slowly and focus on myself, but not on myself.

Me: ""That is confusing, and I'm terrible with riddles. Why am I talking like this? I've been so excited to maybe meet beings like you my entire life, and this is how I act?!""  
G1, seemingly amused: ""Breathe. Just breathe and focus on you. Not the vessel.""

So I did, I think? I focused on the energy I am, the energy they were, and how incredibly safe I felt and even loved. But not loved in a human sense, this went beyond a lifetime of being loved and having loved. ""It is done."" The Mantid said, in that strangely deep but clicking voice. A bit garbled if I didn't listen to him properly, even.

The pain had withered away the moment I felt that burst of energy inside me, and still to this day I wish I could feel that sensation once more. It was terrifying and exhilarating at once. And yet, the only thing I could do is say ""Thank you, friends"" a million times within my mind, crying silently and feeling more like myself than I have in years. There was something deeply wrong with me; I know this now because they told me. About how some of my experiences as a child had led me here. The entire thing faded away slowly, with me thanking them and them saying they will return, but I have work to do first.

If you have made it this far, thank you. I know this sounds absolutely bonkers, but I have not felt an ounce of pain, throbbing, burning, or begging the universe for relief since. I listen to my body now, the tingling of a headache when I drink too much coffee, the cravings for fruit and veggies instead of crunchy, delicious chips. The incessant ""Stop vaping"" from the Mantid's voice, haha. They gave no names, simply stating they were friends of mine, and I am theirs. We all are, in some way we cannot fathom yet.

I can answer any questions any of you may have, to the best of my ability and with complete honesty. But if I could tell anyone anything from this experience, it is this: It was love. It was confusing and nerve-wracking even to me, someone who always said I would bow in respect and have this whole welcome speech. When you meet them for the first time, it is a bit ""OH MY GOD, WHAT!?"" but if you focus on them, listen to them, and feel their energy, it is anything but hostile. I still thank them often and wonder if they are doing well. And every once in a while when I really miss them, I get a brief flash of them, smiling in a way we do not.

TLDR: After two years of constant pain, I took fun adult candies to relax, but was met with an experience with a Mantid being and 4 Greys who healed me. My friends.

This is an update to the money diaries I wrote in [2024](https://www.reddit.com/r/MoneyDiariesACTIVE/comments/1bym44l/i_am_25_years_old_making_260k_working_in_tech_in/) and [2023](https://www.reddit.com/r/MoneyDiariesACTIVE/comments/w1o1ga/i_am_23_years_old_making_200k_working_in_tech_in/). Guess it's an annual tradition! I almost didn't post this because the week was rougher than I expected, but I guess that's life. Quick recap: I work as a data scientist and own a micro-unit condo in San Francisco. P and I broke up last year üò¢ after he totaled my car in an accident. I got paid out by insurance and haven't bought a new car.

* üè• Medical & insurance $100

My monthly costs for health, vision & dental insurance

I've been eating out more often lately, and having groceries delivered since I don't have a car. Safeway Delivery has been a godsend.

Some steep price increases from PG&E this year. Comcast holding steady at $20/mo for Internet though. My employer pays my phone bill.

# What I Spend In A Week

**Sunday, Day 1**

* üöó I wake up late, rush to get dressed and call an Uber to meet my friend for breakfast. We're checking out the new location of a popular Yemeni coffee shop. She doesn't show up until fifteen minutes later... I should have taken the bus. Oh well. Total: $9.90
* ‚òïÔ∏è I get a latte and a beef turnover while we chat about the guys we're seeing. Turns out she was late because hers stayed over until 3:30AM yesterday! The guy I'm into (R) was traveling last week and just landed this morning at 6:30AM. I'm sad he hasn't texted since then, and my friend advises me to reach out. We've been on and off, and I'm not sure where his head's at. Total: $14.46
* üöá On the metro, I text R to say welcome back and he responds almost immediately. He says he'll be going to bed early today because of jetlag, but I'm welcome to stay over at his place... ugh. It feels like a booty call and I reply minimally. He phones me but I can barely hear him since there's no service on metro underground. I ask if we can talk in person later this week and he texts back twenty minutes later to say sure. Total: $2.75
* üè° I reach my destination, an open house for a 2bd/2ba condo + parking going for $900k. The realtors have tried to advertise it as being in Bernal Heights but it's is closer to the Mission. It's been four years of living in my studio (which is less than 300 sq. ft!) I'd love a change, but this neighborhood is unappealing. The sidewalk is covered in stains and it reeks of poop and weed. The house is located on top of a hill, somewhat removed from the chaos of the main street, but not far enough for my tastes.
* üöå R's also been on the house hunt, so I text him a brief update on the bus back home but he ignores it. Sad. There's no charge for MUNI on the way back since I'm within the 120-minute transfer period. Total: $0.00
* üçå I'm starving by the time I get home and immediately eat a banana with peanut butter while deciding on dinner. My options are rather limited and I end up baking some frozen gyoza, also from Costco. Total: $0.00
* üì±My friend's mom, T, calls and we catch up over the phone while I clean the house. We've been close for years, and I know she wishes I would find someone. I tell her about R and she says it's good that I didn't go over. I know she's right, but sleeping in his arms tonight would've been so nice...
* üìñ I end the day by the reading the last section of *Man and His Symbols* by Carl Jung. I've been having really vivid dreams lately and the concepts explained in the book have really helped me understand them. It's also spurned some deeper thought on whether I want children. I fall asleep feeling confused and lonely.

**Daily total: $27.11**



**Monday, Day 2**

* üõèÔ∏è I wake up at 3AM after having an intense dream. Something to do with killer whales, I remember feeling a lot of fear and awe. I toss and turn for nearly two hours before sleep finally washes over me again.
* üì±I get up for real around 9AM, rolling over to check if R had replied to my text. Nothing. My phone's drier than the Sahara. We didn't set a time to talk and I'm starting to feel like we might not at all.
* üì• My first message of the day is from my manager, who needs me to complete a task by EOD. I assure him I can, and go to grind some coffee beans. I make a latte and join my first meeting, cradling the warm cup in my hands. Total: $0.00
* üçó Today is a grind. Between meetings and the time-sensitive task, I don't have time for lunch until 2PM. The fridge is pretty empty so I throw some chicken nuggets in the oven. Total: $0.00
* ‚òéÔ∏è I finish the task and my mind drifts towards R again. I decide to just call him to clear things up. He doesn't pick up but texts to say that he's busy and will call back later in the evening. I lay down and feel sorry for myself.
* üß∫ I know a clean house will make me feel better, so I get to work. I take three loads of laundry to the laundromat: whites, colors, blankets and clean the floors while it's going. It takes hours. Everytime I do a deep clean I think about hiring a cleaning service, but for such a small space it doesn't seem worth it. I have to fold my clothes a specific way to fit in the closet too, so even a wash & fold doesn't seem justifiable. Total: $17.75
* üç´ I'm hungry but it's too late to get groceries delivered and I'm too cheap to order takeout. Girl dinner it is! I have cheese, chocolate, various crackers, and half of a mango that I diced last week.¬† Total: $0.00
* üí§ It's bedtime and R still hasn't called. He texted to say he's tired after getting dinner with a friend, and can we talk tomorrow instead? I guess we could, but I'm over feeling like his last priority. I light a candle, put some rollers in my hair, and go to sleep without responding to his text.

**Daily total: $17.75**



**Tuesday, Day 3**

* ü´ß I wake up naturally around 8AM, leaving me plenty of time to get ready. I shower, wash the dishes, and water my houseplants. My hair looks great today and it feels like the perfect morning. R double-texts asking if I'm free to chat today. I think about responding while eating my breakfast banana but I just feel so bummed out.
* üöç I walk down to catch the company shuttle. My commute is long (anywhere from 60-90min), but I don't mind it. The route is scenic and I spend most of the time on my phone, joining meetings on Webex and responding to Slack messages.
* üåØ I head straight to the company cafe because I am hungry! Sadly, the lady crafts me what looks like a child's burrito. Do any other short women feel like they always get stiffed at burrito bars? It seems like they take one look at me and decide one scoop of meat will be enough. Food is subsidized here but it still doesn't feel like great value for money. Total: $9.00
* üíª My phone keeps buzzing and I realize it's all Slack messages. Turns out there was a bug impacting a high-visibility experiment that I'm working on. I rush back to my desk and join the war room to figure out what to do next.
* ü•• I am relieved when my friend's mom, T, texts me asking to meet up after work. She drives us to an Asian dessert shop and we eat coconut jelly. She always pays for me even though I'm not a kid anymore. She asks about R and I finally text him back, agreeing to call later in the evening. Total: $0.00
* üßΩ T and I both love shopping at Daiso which is just around the corner, so we pop in and buy a random assortment of household objects. I get a basket to organize my socks, a steel sponge holder, and some ripoff post-its. I pay for her items as well. Total: $16.59
* üöç Time to get back on the shuttle. I'm tired, but I close my eyes and spend the ride listening to lectures for this online master's program I started last month. My company offers $5k/yr for education expenses, which isn't enough to cover the cost of the entire program but is sufficient for a couple classes. I'm starting with those and will decide if I want to complete the program later.
* üíî Finally back home and it's time to talk to R. He says he's been busy and wishes I was more excited to see him when he returned from his travels. I tell him I was excited but felt let down when he didn't text me after landing and then only wanted me to spend the night. If we want to do this thing, I need more quality time with him - out of the house, before 10pm. He admits he doesn't have much time before 10, and we decide to part ways.¬†
* üíßI lay down and cry a little. I really liked him, but we slipped into the habit of going to each others' places every night early on instead of going on proper dates. I think that made it challenging to build the foundation for a real relationship. My heart feels bruised.
* üßπ I try my usual strategy to cheer up - clean house and do my beauty routine, but the house is already spotless from my cleaning yesterday. I play sad music, scrub the floors again, and journal. I don't have it in me to make dinner and it's late. Chicken nuggets it is.

**Daily total: $25.59**



**Wednesday, Day 4**

* üóìÔ∏è I really conked out last night, and got a full eight hours of sleep. I check my phone when I wake and realize I've been added to some last-minute meetings. I'm now in back-to-back calls from 9AM to noon, so I'm going to miss the shuttle. Ugh. I'm required to badge in three times a week, so I'll have to make it up another day.
* ü•õI start making coffee and realize I'm out of milk. Thoughts of R keep coming to mind (he loves coffee) but I push them away and walk down to Bi-Rite. I buy a gallon of organic, pasture-raised whole milk for my daily latte. Total: $5.99
* üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I'm checking Slack messages when I remember that my coworkers are running the first half of the SF Marathon. I register before I can overthink it. I've never run more than eight miles in my life, but I think the rejection will fuel me. And I have some friends running it too. Total: $280.08
* üì¶ It's a good thing I stayed home, because FedEx shows up with an important package that requires my signature for delivery. They're custom panels that I bought months ago as part of a kitchen renovation. Production delays (and the government's fluctuating policy on foreign tariffs, I suspect) mean I'm just getting them now. The panels themselves are made in the US but using materials from China.
* üçå Lunch is a banana with Nutzo, a nut & seed butter that I've become very fond of. Plus a protein shake with creatine. I know I need to eat more - I've been losing weight for months - but I just rarely feel like cooking or spending money on food these days.¬†
* üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Back to work until 5, and then I go for a 2-mile run while my PySpark queries are going. I need to take training seriously before the half marathon. I post my run on Strava with a vague caption about remaining steadfast, knowing R will see it.
* üíª I check on my queries and get my manager's OK to send out the experiment results. There goes my last e-mail of the day, woo hoo!
* üöå I finish just in time to catch the bus to Equinox. Wednesday evenings are my favorite class - a sound bath, where attendees lie on a yoga mat while the instructor plays wind chimes, sound bowls, and rainsticks. The sounds are relaxing and reverberate around you. Total: $2.75
* ‚òÆÔ∏è The class was exactly what I needed. I laid in the steam room for half an hour afterward, and leave feeling clean and serene. I take the bus back home and snack on the fig bar I brought. Total: $2.75
* ü•ë Back home, I whip up some avocado pesto pasta. The pesto has some dots in it, but it's supposed to, right? From the ground up nuts? ChatGPT says it doesn't look like mold so I eat it with a cookies & cream protein bar for dessert.¬†
* üìö I can't be alone with my own mind tonight, so I put a lecture video for one of my classes and listen to Prof. Gruber derive labor supply. I fall asleep as he's walking through examples.

**Daily total: $291.57**



**Thursday, Day 5**

* üåô Wow, no dreams and eight hours of sleep again tonight! I can't decide if it's a good or bad thing not to have these vivid dreams - Jung seems to think they're a sign of greater connection to yourself, but I definitely have more when I'm stressed, especially about relationships. Possibly because you realize more things about yourself in a relational context?
* ü•§I get ready for the day, packing what was left of my pasta and a protein shake with added creatine. One upside of my recent weight loss is that I can kind of see a few upper abs if I flex in the right lighting‚Ä¶ maybe there‚Äôs hope for a hot girl summer!
* üöç I board the company shuttle and close my eyes. There is work I should be doing, but I listen to music and let my mind wander.¬† I want to spend some time in nature this weekend, maybe Muir Woods, but it's really hard to get there without a car. The transit routes take 90+ minutes compared to a 30 min drive. I think about buying a car again for the millionth time since the accident.
* üíª Finally at work, but my brain is scrambled today. Numbers aren't lining up but thankfully I have time to figure it out. I ditch my laptop and go to lunch with two teammates: one is leaving the company to backpack in Asia and the other has a young child. We have little in common but make halfway decent conversation before heading back to our desks.
* üßÆ I take an early shuttle back. Today I'm headed to a former employer's office for a recruiting event. I don't really think I would return to the company, but the tech talks sound very interesting, focusing on practical applications of reinforcement learning.¬†
* üëª There's free food and drinks at the event. I see some old friends and am having a good time when the tech talks start. I sit next to a cute-ish guy, and when he introduces himself I suddenly remember we matched on Hinge months ago... we had a brief conversation but I ghosted him. Oops!
* üöå I shoot my shot by replying to his last message on Hinge while on the bus back home. I request to connect with some of the other attendees on LinkedIn (cute guy has already sent me a request!) and head to bed as soon as I get home.

**Daily total: $0.00**  


**Friday, Day 6**

* üí¨ I wake up late and scramble to get ready. There are several Slack messages waiting for me and I also have a meeting with my manager's manager today. He asks if I would be open to relocating to LA, where the rest of my team is. I refuse, and he says there's no pressure, but this feels like pressure!?
* üóÇÔ∏è Work is stressful today: lots of tasks to finish by the end of the week, plus performance reviews are due, plus I get added last-minute to an executive call. Naturally, it's all men making crude jokes about a competitor. I say my obligatory couple sentences during the call, rush to finish my deliverables, and log off early.
* üç∑ I'm meeting my friend for wine after work in Hayes Valley. I take the bus over and we split a bottle of white and seasoned curly fries, catching up on life. I tell her that things have ended with R and she is relieved. She never liked him; felt he was addicted to poker and too prideful. I'm tipsy, laughing, and feel better after our conversation. Total: $21.41
* üè¢ Next stop: the SF office, to make up my missed badge swipe earlier this week. I'm not technically assigned to this office location, but it still counts towards the 3x/wk requirement so I can come by in a pinch. The receptionist and janitor know me personally and wave hello as I walk in.
* üöï I head to the bus stop, where there's a sign saying it's been moved due to construction. Okay. I walk two blocks down to the next stop and wait. When the bus shows up, it drives right past me. I jog to the next stop but I'm not fast enough. I give up and call a Lyft back home. Total: $8.68
* üìñ Back home, I eat the last of my pesto pasta and start reading *White Nights* by Dostoevsky. I love Russian literature and this has been on my to-read list for years, but I'm cringing at the narrator's monologues. At least I'm not as down bad as he is for Nastenka. I fall asleep with the book in my hands.

**Daily total: $30.09**



**Saturday, Day 7**

* üåô I sleep for ten hours (!!) and have a series of vivid dreams. In one of them, my mom is giving birth to a baby boy. My family is so happy and my parents name him Dhruv. In the dream, I'm planning to tell R about my new sibling. When I wake up, I Google what that name means and apparently it means steadfast in Sanskrit... I'm a little unnerved.
* üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I go for a 5-mile run along the Embarcadero. I finish with an 8:43min/mi pace and post a picture flexing my abs on Strava. I decide to keep the caption generic this time to ward off any more bizarre dreams.
* üöå I walk to the bus stop and there's a sign saying it's closed today due to the Sikh Day parade. I check the SF MUNI website it turns out basically all the bus stops downtown are closed until 12:30 for this parade... seriously?
* ‚òïÔ∏è Fortunately I'm by a cafe, and so I decide to wait it out. I order two eggs sunny side up and an orange blossom latte at Flour & Branch bakery. The shop looks like a Victorian grandmother's attic, lots of florals and kitschy ceramics. It's cute but expensive. Total: $17.11
* üöï It's 1PM and I've been watching the bus stop for the last thirty minutes - no buses. I curse public transit in this city and call a Lyft home. Total: $10.40
* ü•§Back at my apartment, I take an everything shower and moisturize aggressively. I lay down feeling like a happy slug and chug two protein shakes with creatine.¬†
* üè† I'm browsing Zillow on my phone when I notice there's an open house just down the road. It's a 1bd/1ba condo + parking for $1M. I decide to pop in. The unit is beautiful, but oddly laid out and the agent is aggressive - I'm not inclined to follow up with him.
* üöå I meet a friend at the bus stop and we head over to the West Coast Craft Fair together. I spot the cutest retro red mugs at Christi Ahee Ceramics' booth, and buy them immediately. They match my cookware and I'm excited to display them in my coffee corner at home! Total: $106.08
* üçù We're both hungry and decide to walk¬† to the Marina for dinner. There's bar seating available at the Italian Homemade Company and I get tagliatelle with meatballs. The bartender is either naturally flirtacious or hitting on us, I can't tell. Total: $25.62
* üöå I take the bus back home. It's been a lovely day and I'm tired but can't doze off yet. I do my nighttime routine: putting my hair in rollers, applying retinol and a moisturizer, and taking a multivitamin. In bed, I scroll on TikTok until sleep takes over around midnight. Total: $2.75

First, when Rachel came back to Stars Hollow, she asks Lorelei to talk to Luke about her. Lorelei follows Luke to a pantry somewhere in the cafeteria, but I can't decide where is it. What do you think? 

The other question is about the first and second floor of the building. One is the apartment of Luke, but... The other one? 
Maybe his apartment is on the second floor and the first floor is a place to store the goods and supplays?

1l6jjrb,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadasWonderland/comments/1l6jjrb/4_days_in_wonderland/,4 Days In Wonderland,"We flew into Pearson International for the park and went in every day from Wednesday to Saturday (June 4-8). Never done a Six Flags/Cedar Fair park before. Here is how we travelled to keep our costs down and what we thought of the park and experience. I will give a bit of comparison to a Disneyland experience we had.

Flew on points with WestJet and just paid the taxes.

#1 biggest expense here is accomodation so we tent camped. I am not going to spend $250 per night for a hotel. If I ended up spending a total of over $1k on a hotel then it would make more sense to just go to Disneyland in a quieter time. We had an earlier trip at Disney where we found an ok motel walking distance to Disney for $150 CAD per night. On that trip we didn't need a car.

From my quick searching there was not a lot of good AND reasonably priced places nearby Wonderland. Fine to just bite the bullet if you are only spending a night or two but not 5 nights. And I am not ok staying in a sketchy place rated 2.9 stars on Google maps. Instead we rented a car off of Turo and tent camped at Albion Hills.

Albion Hills Conservation Area was $50 total a night and a 35 minute drive at the end of the park day. It was 45 minutes in the morning as we were catching the tail end of rush hour.¬†

The campground there was good. Nice sites. Decent showers. Just know that this is car camping. The sites are quite open/not particularly private. For us we didn't care as we left first thing and came back at night to go to bed.

If I did it again I would consider renting a Dodge Grand caravan where all the seats fold down. We got fully rained out one night and had to sleep in the car, but that's just because our tent is old/damaged and inadequate.

The car was cheap off Turo. $170 for 6 days in total. Found someone with lots of good reviews. The car was older with high miles but in good condition. They were located 15 minutes from the airport and Uber was easy. Just know about Turo that it is renting direct from individuals and that they can cancel on you pretty last minute (never happened to me) - but that would usually only happen if the last renter was late or had an accident or something like that. In a big market like Toronto I have no reservation about Turo as there is always another car available somewhere close, even last minute.

Now for the experience. It is more than a little nuts to spend four full days at this park before school has let out for summer as most people could get their fill on spring weekdays in a day. Two days if leisurely. It just so happens that I have a ride nut family who live for thrill rides. Weekdays in June are dead (with exceptions), and it was rainy when we went making it exceptionally so. Like walk on the whole park except big three being 15 minutes kind of dead for most of the day. The Friday and Saturday were very busy. Friday was an in-service for school kids so lots came to the park. Saturday was very busy.¬†

Even with my ride nut family, if I did it again I would probably do the Wed-Thurs again, ropedrop Friday, and then go on to other adventures in Toronto that Friday after 11 AM and then do the waterpark/water rides on the Saturday (waterpark is only open weekends in June). If I didn't care about the waterpark then I would have just done three weekdays (not an inservice) and skipped the weekend.

As for the experience... well it's obviously not Disneyland. It's very clean and has some nice elements at the front of the park around International Street and the mountain. But it's more carnival and rides than theme park. In Disney I got the feeling that a person could hang out there forever just taking it all in. Wonderland is best for pre-teens and teens that are all about the high thrills. For us we found a low-rent Disney but high thrills experience just fine: when we went to Disney they liked DCA more than Disney and liked Wonderland more than Disney because of the big 3 (and soon to be 4). The waterpark is ok, but also gets slammed. We really just wanted some time to chill and hang out in the wavepool so that was good.

The cost of the park is just an exceptional deal if you are doing multiple days. A season pass was $89. The all season food pass was $110. All season drink pass was $35. So you're talking around $270 per person for as much rides, eating and drinking as they can take over an entire summer - very cheap. A person could easily spend that in one day at Disney.

The all season meal plan is two meals spaced at least four hours apart. It doesn't cover every food in the park and not snacks. Put some in the bottom of a purse or small backpack - never got searched once. The meal options weren't bad. We mostly ate at Hungry Bear. Kids mostly just wanted subway. Consider planning your meals a bit off hours if you are going on the weekend as they get slammed then.

The reality however is I can see that this park would be unmanageable in the summer and especially summer weekends. Like 90-120 minute+ waits all day for anything good kindof unmanageable. The only solution to that is fast pass plus which is normally $130 per day on top of admission, which is expensive. Though they do have a deal currently for admission AND fast pass plus - when I looked I saw days in August for $90, which is a very good deal. I wouldn't hesitate to do that at least for one day if I was coming back in summer.

This was definitely a different kind of experience. We were more like locals including a decent length drive every day. Plus we weren't sleeping in nice beds (and slept in a car one night). But because we kept our costs down we could go a lot longer and be leisurely about it so the drive wasn't so bad. It was kindof nice time to talk. The weekdays really spoiled us. I can't imagine doing the waits I saw people doing on the weekend. Pro tip you can single rider Yukon Striker and Goliath: had some waits about 3/4 posted time but also some about 1/3.

So in sum:

$150 per person return for the taxes on flights (plus points)
$270 per person rides, food and drink
$170 car rental plus $40 gas
$50 total two Uber rentals
$250 total campsite

And then costs for breakfasts and coffee outside the park as well as snacks both inside and out the park and souvenirs if you want.

Under normal circumstances I think for our next adventure we would probably fly into Toronto and drive to Cedar Point in Ohio or fly into Nashville or Atlanta and drive to Dollywood. However until the orange man and his country settle down, I think Wonderland will be a good option again for us.",12,1749408197.0,CanadasWonderland,5,1.0,False

# History

Tulip grew up in her father‚Äôs auto shop, before she could walk she enjoyed being her dad‚Äôs helper. As she had grown up she had taken more responsibilities in the shop. In her downtime she would work on her powers. She hated school as it was too much sitting down instead of hands on stuff. 

At age 13 her father had finally sat her down and explained to her that her mom was a goddess. He handed her the sword Techne left her father. Her dad said that now that she knows, the monsters will find her more easily, so he sent her to camp. 

A cloud nymph named Anabelle quickly found the young demigod wandering the streets alone, and helped her to camp. Like most demigods they had fought many monsters side by side, unfortunately Anabelle had to leave Tulip once they got into New York.

# Now

Tulip walked over Half-Blood Hill, her eyes clouded with exhaustion. Anabelle told her that there was a special cabin for her, so she started to walk along all the incredible cabins. Looking for the one that called to her. Her sword shined like a beacon as the sunlight hit the blade.

Bonus could be another ‚Ç¨1k but not guaranteed. Unfortunately I cannot get a better paying job at the moment, it's the best offer I can get since I got made redundant a few months ago. I know you need to be in a job at least 6 months and past probation to get approval so if I did get it anyway so it wont be this year. I'm hoping to save ‚Ç¨500 per month (all going well. I have ‚Ç¨9k in savings at the moment. I know I'll need at least ‚Ç¨20k maybe ‚Ç¨25k to cover everything. I'm hoping to buy a 2 bed in rural Ireland - I'm 2 hours from Dublin but prices keep up every year. I know you can borrow up to 4 times your salary. I'll be spending probably 80 euro a week on petrol commuting/to from this job 3 days a week, two will be from home. I live in the sticks so job opportunities are very limited. Happy to have an offer even though it's less money (‚Ç¨2k less per annum) than I was on in previous job and no pension. So that's far from ideal, but I have some pension accumulation from my previous employment. 

  
Wondering has anyone else managed to get mortgage approval on a similar salary? FYI, I never go out, don't really drink or go on holidays in a long time and have no social life. I'd get the odd take out coffee and a takeaway twice a month. Guess I have to cut that out to have any hope. Most of my spending goes on rent and other essential bills, getting hair done once a month, nothing extravagant. Anyone have any advice/tips?

The events that led me to feel the way I do about his sisters (let's call them Becky and Karen) transpired around 2 years ago, but let me give you some context first.

When my husband and I first got together he introduced me to his family, including his sisters, quite quickly. They were both quite materialistic and obsessed with their image on social media from the get go, but that's something I started noticing only after several other negatives started piling up.  

Now let's start with the background on Becky:
Karen lived in a different city, so we wouldn't hang out much, but Becky was living in the same city, so we would initially hang out quite often. 

Whenever we'd hang, my husband (then boyfriend) and I would have huge fights the very next day, which at first I didn't connect to one another. After a while I started realizing it was because everytime we'd hang she'd mention stuff about his exes, but in such a sly manner that it would work me up in a subconscious way and I would then take my frustration out on my husband. After I realized, I started quietly cutting her out. There was no argument or anything, and I would still act nice when around her, I'd just find excuses to not see her alone and would only spend whatever time was absolutely necessary with her in family events and gatherings etc.

Then, two years ago my husband wanted to take her and I out for dinner for his birthday (in July 2023). It would be his treat. Despite me having surprised my husband with cake the day before and not being a big fan of hers anymore, I still wanted to make her feel included for my husband's sake and called her to organize a surprise cake for our dinner. Since I would be going to the restaurant with my husband, there was no way I would be able to sneak a cake in, so I had to rely on her going to the restaurant before us and bringing her with it. We agreed on it and said that we would be splitting the cost later. On the day of, she ended up being ready late and called asking us to pick her up on our way to the restaurant. While my husband was driving us to go get her, I messaged her to ask about the cake and our plan. No response.

When we got there, my husband started making comments about a cake jokingly, but clearly showing he was expecting some sort of surprise. Besides, he would also organize similar surprises for our birthdays. At some point he left our table to go to the restroom, which was my only window to ask about the cake again. Her response? ""Oh I was out with my friends and forgot"". I started panicking. Knowing my husband was expecting a little gesture on our end, I started searching for cakes on delivery platforms, hoping one of them would be delivering to our restaurant. Meanwhile she was not sweating at all. Eventually I was able to find one, and spend most of my evening with me eyes glued on my phone, tracking the delivery under the table. Once it was there, I started noding to her, as she was closer to the door and would be easier for her to pick it up (mind you I had already paid). Nothing. Eventually, I found an excuse and went out to get it. I started calling and texting as I needed help with the candles and me walking any further would mean that my husband would probably see me trying to light the candles. Still nothing. Luckily a waiter saw me struggling and helped.

The moment I walk in with the cake though.. Oh boy.. She became an entirely different person. Acting all involved, recording my husband blowing the candles and posting the video on social media, tagging only my husband and herself, acting as if she was the one to organize the whole thing. She never even offered to pay her half, and at the end of the night had the audacity to tell me ""don't tell my brother about today"". 

I was fuming, but said nothing. My husband though had already picked up most of it. The nods, me tracking the delivery, etc. When we got home he asked, ""did she even offer to pay?"" My silence gave him all the information he needed. The next day, he messaged her, calling her all sorts of names and went no contact until Karen's wedding that would be taking place in about a month from his birthday.

This brings me to the background on Karen:

As I said in the beginning, we wouldn't see her much as see was living in a different city, but whenever she'd visit her parents in our city, we'd make sure to see her.

About a year before the event with the cake, my husband and I were renovating an apartment I had inherited from my parents (his parents would help with part of the renovation costs). 

Karen was visiting around that time (in October 2022), so we made sure to schedule lunch and coffee with her and Becky. Now before I explain how that went, it's important for me to mention that my husband had a childhood friend who around that same time was unemployed by choice and was not doing much with his life other than drinking and playing video games. When my husband would hang with him, he'd stay up until early in the morning and would even skip work because of how much they had to drink the night before. I was becoming worried that he would lose his job and waste all his potential away. So when the time came for our lunch with Karen and Becky, they started asking about the progress of our renovations, and discussing how we would be hosting all these dinner parties at our new home, which triggered me to say something that, in retrospect, I shouldn't have. Not in front of them. I turned to my husband and said that his childhood friend would not be welcome. I think a part of me hoped that, hearing about the situation, his sisters would also try to talk some sense into him. But I sure as heck didn't expect what happened next. Karen started calling me toxic and asking what would happen if I didn't like his family next, implying that their family was helping with the renovation costs and it's practically their home too. Now you can judge me all you want for what I said, but I didn't say it for a random friend. I said it for the one, who was turning my husband into a completely different person. And in any case I don't think it was Karen's place to intervene and call me toxic. After that I left the table and went to the restroom so I could cry out of sight. When I came back, it was clear that I had cried my eyes out, but still no apology or even an ""are you ok?"".

Moving on, as I said earlier Karen's wedding would be taking place soon (in August 2023). So a few months before (in April 2023) her friends created a group chat, including Becky and myself, so we would organize her bachelor party (it would take place in June 2023). Now before we progress any further let me point the following:
1. The wedding would take place at where Karen lives, which practically meant a destination wedding for her guests, which would add to the already high cost of being a wedding guest (gift, clothes, etc.)
2. Where we come from (geographically and financially) a night out with close friends is the typical format of a bachelor/bachelorette. Destination bachelorettes are gradually also becoming a thing, but it's not something done by the majority, especially when the wedding is already a destination wedding or the if the group is not particularly well off.

Now from the get go, Becky told me that Karen expected a destination bachelorette and that she was instructed by her to stirr the conversation in the bachelorette chat in that direction. As expected, Karen's friends started out by recommending nice places for a night out. This was immediately shut down by Becky suggesting that we can have a night out whenever and Karen deserves more for her bachelorette. Karen's friends then proceeded to recommend some budget friendly destinations, which were met by a ""Karen deserves something more cosmopolitan for her bachelorette"" by Becky. They ended up succumbing to Becky's pressures and agreeing on a more cosmopolitan destination. When the time came for booking hotels etc, my mother passed and I was in no mood to go nor explain my situation to the whole group. My husband called Becky on my behalf to explain the situation, and, instead of announcing to the group that I simply won't be going for personal reasons, she ended up writing ""she (me) won't be coming because her mother passed"", while I was still in the chat. I was furious that she shared something so personal without asking for my permission and after receiving 0 condolences from Karen's friends, I simply left the chat, with a sour taste about both Karen's outrageous expectations and Becky's poor handling of the situation. 

Now where their stories merge and escalate:

To recap the event with the cake took place in July 2023. Karen's wedding would take place in August 2023 (late August) and in the meantime my husband and Becky were no contact. 

In early August, and while my husband was with his mother visiting his grandmother, I take a pregnancy test which comes out positive. My husband and I are the kind of people who wear our emotions on our face and tone of voice, so the moment he calls me after taking the test, I tell him it's positive and he immediately tells his mother and grandmother. The news were also shared with Karen, but not Becky, as my husband didn't want to after the cake event. They all seemed happy. Now mind you this was weeks before the wedding and there was no big announcement or anything that would look like trying to steal Karen's thunder. It was just us sharing the happy news, which after my mother's passing were very much needed, with our closest family. 

Since Karen's wedding was a destination wedding, we had decided to go a week before, help with any preparations needed and also have our vacation there. Becky and her 3 closest friends, as well as my husband's mother, grandmother and little cousin had the same plans.

Apart from wanting to enjoy what was supposed to be our last summer vacation as a couple without children, my husband's intention was to spend time with the family, but only see Becky and her friends when absolutely necessary. We had also agreed to have his little cousin with us on some of the days.

On our first night there, we had agreed to go out with Karen, her hudband to be, and the little cousin. There was no mention of Becky. However, while we were out, Becky shows up unannounced. Karen had invited her. My husband and I were civil with her, but not particularly talkative. We would participate in the general conversation, but not ask her any questions or direct our attention to her specifically. After a bit, she gets up, throws some money in my face and says here's the cake money. Mind you I never asked for it or even implied that this was the issue. The issue had always been that she did not stay true to her commitment, didn't help, and only cared about her social media image. Even then, it wasn't me who decided to go no contact with her. It was my husband. Yet, I became the target of her frustration.

I tend to manifest stress physically, so after that, we went back to our room and I was shaking, had a fever, and light bleeding. All this while a few weeks pregnant.

The next morning we went to see my husband's mother and grandmother, expecting to receive some sort of supportive comment. Instead his grandmother was saying that Karen was crying over what happened all night and that we are ruining her wedding. Even when we explained that I started bleeding after what happened, she kept insisting that Karen being upset was what mattered.

Over the next few days, we kept being treated as being in the wrong by the majority of husband's family. On top of everything, my husband's little cousin, who was perhaps the only one on our side, was sharing how Becky and her friends were talking about us in her presence. Not only was Becky not acknowledging her responsibility, but her and her friends were frustrated my husband wouldn't drive them around for stuff which resulted in them having to restrict themselves in options near their hotel room (even everything between us was completely fine they were 4 and we were 2, but f@!k logic)... As a result, I kept feeling quite frustrated over what happened and my bleeding continued.

Had I known what I know now, I would have asked my husband for us to leave and not stay for the wedding, to protect my pregnancy. But despite everything I still wanted him to have a good a relationship with his family and not miss his sister's wedding. So I trusted that the medication my doctor suggested would be enough and stayed. 

Eventually, under the pressure, my husband apologized to Karen and Becky, and in turn Becky texted me a non-apology, where she was saying ""sorry for throwing money at you, but my brother going no contact is unacceptable"". Again, he got what happened and decided to go no contact, but who cares about facts, right? 

So the day of the wedding finally comes and we are all civil. The bride has ne running up and down to do all sorts of stuff for her, as Becky suffers from weaponised incompetence and is never trusted for anything by her family. 

During the ceremony I was feeling lightheaded and like I was bleeding again. I still waited for the ceremony to be over and for the couple to be congratulated by all guests, and when the time came for family photos, I went to the bride and said, ""I'm really sorry but I feel like I'm bleeding again, I don't think I can stay for the family photos. I need to head to the reception area so I can can check how things are, have some water etc."" Her response? ""You can go, but my brother needs to stay. You can take little cousin with you"". 

I'd like to tell you that this had a happy ending, but I think by now you can guess that after a few days we lost the baby. I feel so incredibly guilty for not standing up for myself and my baby at any of these points. So incredibly stupid for not leaving right then and there. 

The cherry on top? Karen got pregnant a few months later. The ultrasound photos to my husband every few weeks, were relentless. Completely disregarding our loss and pain. But this is all for a Part B.

So what do you think? AITA for disliking Becky and Karen with a passion?",8,1749407605.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,10,0.91,False

Today is my birthday. I took Friday-Monday off work. I usually do, it‚Äôs my way of celebrating me. I had dinner plans with my son and dad on Friday. My boyfriend had planned an arcade night for Saturday and paddle boarding for today. Tomorrow was supposed to just be a chill day at home. 

The Friday dinner was amazing. Great time and company. Food was delicious! 

 While at dinner my boyfriend decided to drink. He‚Äôs an alcoholic, trying to get sober. He cycles through drinking episodes about every three months. Two weeks of binge drinking, detox facilities, hospitals and then 3 months of not drinking. Repeat. Thankfully he doesn‚Äôt live with me but It‚Äôs still a nightmare and after the last episode I told him I couldn‚Äôt go through another. 

I tried really hard to not let his shit bring me down. I‚Äôm still going to celebrate me, I deserve it. I told him to not contact me, reminded him of the line a drew, and hung up. 

I did pretty good yesterday. Spent time with my son, hung out at the pool and had another nice dinner. But today I woke up in tears. Gut punched by my boyfriends actions. Feeling like I don‚Äôt matter. I know I do to a lot of people, but just completely let down by one. 

To top it off, I got out of bed to make coffee and found one of my birds dead. 

I just want to curl up in a ball and be sad. Or drink until I pass out. Or just something to numb out.

Some mornings, just getting out of bed feels like the hardest thing in the world.  
  
The body aches, the energy‚Äôs not there, and the day feels like too much before it even begins.  
  
If that‚Äôs where you are today, I just want to remind you: you‚Äôre not behind. You‚Äôre not doing it wrong. You‚Äôre doing your best in a body that asks a lot from you ‚Äî and that is enough.  
  
üåø Here are 3 tiny routines that gently anchor me on hard days:  
A warm cup of coffee or tea ‚Äî before anything else.  
No emails. No pressure. Just sit. Sip. Breathe.  
  
üí´A 3-minute face refresh.  
Cold water. A little moisturizer. Lip balm. Not for the world ‚Äî for you.  
  
One simple thing that says ‚ÄúI care about you.‚Äù  
It might be brushing your hair, opening a window, putting on soft socks, or lighting a candle. It doesn‚Äôt have to fix anything ‚Äî it just reminds your body it‚Äôs safe to be here.  
  
üíõ What This Isn‚Äôt:  
A checklist  
A productivity hack  
A ‚Äúdo more‚Äù routine  
  
This is survival. A way to keep the thread from snapping when things feel too loud, too painful, or too uncertain. If today feels hard, I see you. - And if all you did today was wake up and breathe ‚Äî that counts.

1l6j1hx,https://i.redd.it/zmawg350xq5f1.jpeg,üåô [Theory] Brycriel: An Intergalactic Fated Romance √ó In-Depth Sailor Moon Parallels,"SJM is a self-aware Sailor Moon fanatic (so am I!), and she‚Äôs openly said Sailor Moon is the reason she began writing ‚Äî she literally started with Sailor Moon fanfiction.

So I went deep into the parallels ‚Äî and this theory proposes that Bryce Quinlan and Azriel are not just a crossover possibility, but an intentional echo of Sailor Moon‚Äôs most mythic love story: Serenity and Endymion. Their bond may also mirror the tragic cosmic tale of Thea and Aidas, with a chance to break the cycle.

Buckle up ‚Äî grab a coffee. This is long, layered, and for the lore lovers.

‚∏ª

‚≠ê 1. Reluctant Princess: Bryce = Sailor Moon / Princess Serenity

Before she was Sailor Moon, Usagi Tsukino was Princess Serenity ‚Äî heir to the Moon Kingdom. She fell in love with Prince Endymion, heir to Earth. Their love was forbidden, and in a devastating war, they both died. But their love was strong enough to reincarnate ‚Äî reborn as Usagi and Mamoru, with no memories of their past.

But they find each other again.
Their souls remember what their minds forget.

Usagi Tsukino (Sailor Moon) wasn‚Äôt born a warrior ‚Äî she was a normal girl thrust into destiny. Bryce shares that arc:
	‚Ä¢	Both denied their power and were pulled into leadership.
	‚Ä¢	Both bear cosmic legacies: Usagi = Silver Crystal, Bryce = Thea‚Äôs starborn light.
	‚Ä¢	Both fall for a warrior from another realm: Moon princess‚Üí Earth‚Äôs prince, Bryce from CC ‚Üí Azriel in Prythian.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be a princess. I want to be a normal girl. I don‚Äôt want this destiny.‚Äù ‚Äî Usagi
‚Üí Bryce echoes every word in her denial of the Fae world.

Bryce x Sailor Moon Parallels:
	‚Ä¢	Denial of destiny: Like Usagi, Bryce rejects her cosmic legacy at first.
	‚Ä¢	Cosmic heir to an unheard power: Usagi inherits the Silver Crystal; Bryce is Thea‚Äôs heir and the first in 15,000 years to yield her full starlight.
	‚Ä¢	Repeating myth: Like Serenity reborn, Bryce might be the second coming of Thea.

A love story set in motion by the stars ‚Äî and delayed until fate aligns again.

ü¶á 2. Masked Protector: Azriel = Tuxedo Mask √ó Phantom of the Opera

Naoko Takeuchi, creator of Sailor Moon, confirmed that Tuxedo Mask was inspired by The Phantom of the Opera.
That means Azriel ‚Äî who echoes Tuxedo Mask in key emotional and narrative beats ‚Äî also mirrors this Phantom archetype: a masked figure hiding scars, watching from the shadows, and loving silently, intensely, and from afar.

Azriel doesn‚Äôt just match one archetype ‚Äî he‚Äôs a fusion of both:

The Phantom‚Äôs tragic loneliness √ó Tuxedo Mask‚Äôs fated devotion = Azriel‚Äôs entire emotional arc

‚∏ª

Tuxedo Mask √ó Azriel Parallels:
	‚Ä¢	Mysterious protector:
Tuxedo Mask appears at key moments, cloaked in mystery and a black cape, often throwing a red rose as his signature move.
Azriel? He literally vanishes into shadows, arrives without warning, and operates as a silent savior from the sidelines.
	‚Ä¢	Orphaned and emotionally restrained:
Tuxedo Mask lost his parents in a car crash and was raised alone, haunted by dreams and a fragmented identity.
Azriel was locked in a cell as a child, abused, and remains emotionally distanced. Many readers theorize he may even be a changeling ‚Äî a fae child raised among Illyrians, never truly belonging.
	‚Ä¢	Masked identity:
Tuxedo Mask doesn‚Äôt initially know who he really is. His powers and memories return through dreams and emotional connection.
Azriel lives similarly ‚Äî cloaked in secrecy, his true desires always hidden beneath loyalty, duty, and silence.
	‚Ä¢	Rose symbolism:
Tuxedo Mask‚Äôs red rose is symbolic ‚Äî precise, elegant, protective.
Azriel doesn‚Äôt throw literal roses, but the imagery follows him:
	‚Ä¢	Rosehall ‚Äî his secluded and enigmatic estate
	‚Ä¢	Five Roses ‚Äî the fae neighborhood in Lunathion ruled by Bryce‚Äôs father, Autumn King.
	‚Ä¢	A rose necklace ‚Äî bought for Elain, which ended up with Gwyn

It‚Äôs as if the rose is a stand-in for something deeper ‚Äî a symbol of love withheld, of desire never fully voiced. Waiting, perhaps, for its rightful meaning. (Bryce?)
Phantom of the Opera √ó Azriel Parallels:
	‚Ä¢	Scars and shadows:
The Phantom is a masked figure who lives in darkness, consumed by unrequited love.
Azriel hides his burned hands and emotional wounds. He exists in the periphery ‚Äî always near, never chosen.
	‚Ä¢	Romantic theatricality:
The Phantom controls the opera from behind the scenes.
Tuxedo Mask enters like a stage cue ‚Äî sudden, dramatic, precise.
Azriel‚Äôs battle scenes often read the same way ‚Äî sudden appearances, eerie grace, total silence.
	‚Ä¢	Emotionally wounded archetype:
	‚Ä¢	Phantom: disfigured, isolated, convinced he‚Äôs unlovable
	‚Ä¢	Tuxedo Mask: traumatized orphan, emotionally detached
	‚Ä¢	Azriel: abused, scarred, emotionally self-contained ‚Äî always stepping back so others can be happy

Tuxedo Mask is often seen as a romantic redemption of the Phantom: still masked, still tragic, but driven by love and destiny rather than obsession.
Azriel fits this trajectory perfectly ‚Äî not controlling, but quietly protective; not obsessive, but deeply restrained.

‚∏ª

Tuxedo Mask is:
	‚Ä¢	Mysterious, protective, emotionally repressed
	‚Ä¢	Fated to love Sailor Moon across lifetimes
	‚Ä¢	Known for appearing just in time, throwing roses as his symbol

Azriel is:
	‚Ä¢	A phantom in the shadows
	‚Ä¢	Deeply loyal and quietly romantic
	‚Ä¢	Constantly protecting ‚Äî yet never claiming

üí´ 3. Bryce x Azriel: The Myth Repeats ‚Äî But Might End Differently

SJM loves to echo myths through cosmic repetition ‚Äî soul cycles, inherited burdens, love reborn through new vessels. And that‚Äôs exactly what we‚Äôre seeing in Crescent City and ACOTAR.

üî• The Mythic Precedent: Thea & Aidas
	‚Ä¢	Thea, the last Starborn Queen, was a beacon of light ‚Äî powerful, radiant, chosen.
	‚Ä¢	Aidas, Prince of the Pit, was a creature of flame and shadow ‚Äî ancient, complex, and not quite what he seemed.
	‚Ä¢	They were from different species and different worlds. Opposites in nature, but magnetically drawn together.
	‚Ä¢	Thea traveled through realms and accidentally landed at Aidas‚Äôs feet ‚Äî and thus began their doomed love story.

They were fated. Light and shadow. Star and flame.
They tried to defy the cycle of war and cosmic tragedy‚Ä¶ and failed.

Thea died. Her power disappeared. Aidas endured ‚Äî and waited.

For 15,000 years, Thea‚Äôs light was dormant. Until Bryce.

‚∏ª

üå† Bryce Mirrors Thea ‚Äî and Reignites Her Power
	‚Ä¢	Bryce is canonically Thea‚Äôs heir ‚Äî and the first in 15,000 years to wield the full force of her starlight.
	‚Ä¢	Her power isn‚Äôt metaphorical. It‚Äôs genetic, ancestral, cosmic.
	‚Ä¢	She doesn‚Äôt just represent a second chance ‚Äî she is the second chance.

And like Thea before her, Bryce travels through space, aiming to reach Aidas for help.

But she doesn‚Äôt reach Aidas.
She lands at Azriel‚Äôs feet.

A warrior cloaked in shadow. A being from another realm.
Another species. Another world. Another love story ‚Äî beginning again.

It‚Äôs not literal reincarnation. It‚Äôs something deeper:
Soul-heirs. Prophecy-bearers. Cosmic echoes.

‚∏ª

üó° Bryce and Azriel ‚Äî A Bond Already in Motion

Their magical weapons aren‚Äôt just compatible ‚Äî they‚Äôre fated to work together. Prophesied.
	‚Ä¢	Bryce‚Äôs starborn sword and Azriel‚Äôs dagger, Truth-Teller ‚Äî two blades from different worlds that recognize each other.
	‚Ä¢	They pulse, thrumm, and respond in each other‚Äôs presence.
	‚Ä¢	Just like Bryce and Azriel do ‚Äî instinctual reactions, breathless tension, uncanny resonance.

In SJM‚Äôs lore, mating bonds are often veiled under magical proxies:
	‚Ä¢	Feyre and Rhys‚Äôs bargain
	‚Ä¢	Aelin and Rowan‚Äôs carranam
	‚Ä¢	Even Nesta and Cassian‚Äôs bond was delayed by emotional walls

Bryce and Azriel‚Äôs ‚Äúweapon bond‚Äù may be another veil ‚Äî a narrative smokescreen for something much deeper that neither of them fully understands yet.

Bryce likely senses it, but continues to reject her Fae identity.
Azriel, shaped by Illyrian reverence for the mating bond, would never act without certainty.

Their disconnect isn‚Äôt about lack of feeling ‚Äî it‚Äôs about timing, trauma, and narrative setup.
The bond may already exist. They just haven‚Äôt named it yet.

‚∏ª

üßø What If Azriel is Aidas‚Äôs Successor?
	‚Ä¢	Aidas has blue glowing eyes in his feline form ‚Äî described as ‚Äúlike polished stones.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Azriel‚Äôs Illyrian armor is embedded with glowing blue stones ‚Äî a rare and specific detail.
	‚Ä¢	Aidas has always protected Bryce subtly ‚Äî whispering, guiding, guarding.
	‚Ä¢	What if, somewhere along the way, a part of Aidas‚Äôs power passed to Azriel?

Thea and Aidas failed.
Bryce and Azriel‚Ä¶ might break the cycle.

Just like Serenity and Endymion were reborn on Earth,
Bryce and Azriel are the intergalactic successors ‚Äî bound to try again.

‚∏ª

üåå Cosmic Love That Keeps Trying

If SJM is truly embracing cosmic soulmate mythology ‚Äî and honestly, when hasn‚Äôt she? ‚Äî then Bryce and Azriel are not fanservice. They are:
	‚Ä¢	The second telling of an ancient myth
	‚Ä¢	Fated weapons mirroring fated hearts
	‚Ä¢	Star and shadow, reborn in a new age
	‚Ä¢	A love that keeps rewriting itself across time and dimensions ‚Äî until finally, it sticks

‚∏ª

üí´ Quotes That Echo This Mythic Structure:

‚ÄúOur first love ended in tragedy. But now, in this new life, we can begin again.‚Äù
‚Äî Princess Serenity
‚Üí Directly parallels Thea and Aidas failing‚Ä¶ and Bryce and Azriel being the second attempt.

‚ÄúThe stars have always known our names. We just had to find each other again.‚Äù
‚Äî Sailor Moon Crystal
‚Üí Cosmic memory. Dream recognition. A love written in starlight.


‚∏ª

üëÅ 4. Glowing Blue Eyes & Stones: The Aidas‚ÄìAzriel Connection

Let‚Äôs talk about visual symbolism ‚Äî because SJM doesn‚Äôt throw in details like ‚Äúglowing blue stones‚Äù or ‚Äúpolished sapphire eyes‚Äù for nothing.
	‚Ä¢	In House of Flame and Shadow, when Bryce meets Aidas in his feline form, his eyes glow blue like polished stones.
	‚Ä¢	Azriel‚Äôs Illyrian armor is canonically described as inlaid with glowing blue stones.

This is not a coincidence.
SJM is signaling a hidden connection ‚Äî a shared cosmic thread.

These glowing blue markers could represent:
	‚Ä¢	A magical fingerprint left behind by Aidas ‚Äî not just in history, but through magic, essence, or divine inheritance.
	‚Ä¢	A symbolic or literal power transfer ‚Äî ancient infernal magic reforged into something new through Azriel.

üîπ What if Azriel unknowingly carries part of Aidas‚Äôs essence ‚Äî embedded in his shadows, his armor, or his very soul?
üîπ What if the blue stones aren‚Äôt just aesthetic ‚Äî but ancestral, infernal, divine?

This would explain:
	‚Ä¢	Why Azriel‚Äôs shadows behave like sentient beings ‚Äî responding emotionally and independently.
	‚Ä¢	Why Bryce‚Äôs starborn light reacts around him ‚Äî not with fear or aggression, but with pull and intensity.
	‚Ä¢	Why Azriel locks eyes with Bryce first when she arrives ‚Äî he senses her before anyone else does.

Bryce is Thea‚Äôs heir.
Azriel may be Aidas‚Äôs ‚Äî not a literal reincarnation, but a shadow prince reborn, a counterbalance to her light.

The shared blue light isn‚Äôt just a visual cue ‚Äî it‚Äôs a symbol of divine symmetry.

‚∏ª

üí´ ‚ÄúNot just fanservice ‚Äî cosmic storytelling.‚Äù

This theory ties together:
	‚Ä¢	Narrative cycles (Thea & Aidas / Bryce & Azriel)
	‚Ä¢	Symbolism (blue light, shadows, divine weapons)
	‚Ä¢	Foreshadowing (armor, instinctual reactions, shared prophecy)
	‚Ä¢	And pop culture parallels ‚Äî Sailor Moon, The Phantom of the Opera, and even Taylor Swift-coded motifs of timeless love.

What we‚Äôre seeing isn‚Äôt random. It‚Äôs a cosmic soulmate myth ‚Äî repeating across dimensions, across lifetimes, trying again and again until it finally succeeds.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve always been together, in every lifetime. No matter how many times we‚Äôre reborn, our hearts remember.‚Äù
‚Äî Usagi Tsukino, Sailor Moon Eternal

‚∏ª

üåô Sailor Moon Quotes That Symbolize This Exact Arc

These quotes capture the soul-deep, fate-woven connection between Bryce and Azriel ‚Äî echoing Sailor Moon‚Äôs archetypal lovers, Serenity and Endymion.

‚ÄúHe always appears at the right time ‚Äî like a rose blooming in darkness.‚Äù
‚Äî Luna, about Tuxedo Mask
‚Üí Azriel, cloaked in shadow, arriving at Bryce‚Äôs feet when all hope is lost.

‚ÄúI am always watching over you‚Ä¶ even from the shadows.‚Äù
‚Äî Tuxedo Mask
‚Üí Azriel‚Äôs silent, protective instinct ‚Äî seen throughout ACOTAR and now in CC.

‚ÄúThe power of darkness exists to protect the light.‚Äù
‚Äî Sailor Pluto, Sailor Moon Crystal
‚Üí Darkness and starlight ‚Äî Azriel and Bryce ‚Äî not in opposition, but in balance.

‚ÄúI exist to protect you, even if you never know it. I may not be perfect. I may not be worthy. But I will protect you with everything I have.‚Äù
‚Äî Tuxedo Mask
‚Üí Azriel‚Äôs unspoken vow ‚Äî especially powerful given how he steps aside for others‚Äô happiness.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been looking for you‚Ä¶ even before I knew your name.‚Äù
‚Äî Mamoru / Tuxedo Mask
‚Üí Echoes dream-bond theory: Azriel sensing Bryce long before they meet.

‚ÄúOur love is the one thing we‚Äôre never willing to give up.‚Äù
‚Äî Usagi / Serenity
‚Üí In the past, Thea and Aidas couldn‚Äôt make it work. This lifetime is the universe‚Äôs second chance.

‚∏ª

üåÄ 5. Dreams, Memory, and Cosmic Recognition

In both Sailor Moon and SJM‚Äôs multiverse, dreams are destiny‚Äôs breadcrumbs.
	‚Ä¢	Tuxedo Mask dreams of Serenity before he meets her. He doesn‚Äôt know her name, her face ‚Äî only the feeling.
	‚Ä¢	His dreams are not dreams, but memories of a love that keeps returning.

In SJM‚Äôs world:
	‚Ä¢	Rhys dreams of Feyre.
	‚Ä¢	Ruhn hears his mate‚Äôs thrumming.
	‚Ä¢	Characters feel each other before they know why.

Azriel and Bryce are set up in exactly this way ‚Äî their instinctual reaction to each other goes beyond logic, beyond realm, beyond explanation.

‚ÄúThese dreams I keep having‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre not just dreams. They‚Äôre memories.‚Äù
‚Äî Mamoru / Tuxedo Mask

‚Üí This line could be Azriel, if he ever admits what he‚Äôs felt ‚Äî a sense of her, even in shadow.

‚∏ª

üí≠ More Sailor Moon Quotes That Fit Dream-Bond Theory

‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôve known you forever‚Ä¶ even though we just met.‚Äù
‚Äî Usagi to Mamoru
‚Üí HOFAS moment. Bryce and Azriel‚Äôs first meeting. That immediate pull.

‚ÄúWhen I‚Äôm with you, I feel like I finally remember who I really am.‚Äù
‚Äî Mamoru / Endymion
‚Üí Could be Azriel, if Bryce is the one who finally sees him ‚Äî not as a weapon, but as a person. As a soulmate.
üó° 6. Prophecy, Weapons, and the Covering of the Mating Bond

SJM loves to mask mating bonds until her characters are emotionally ready:
	‚Ä¢	Feyre and Rhys: bargain first, bond later
	‚Ä¢	Aelin and Rowan: carranam first, bond later

With Bryce and Azriel, the weapon bond could be a magical placeholder. Their sword and dagger pulse when near ‚Äî exactly like mates drawn to each other.

In Sailor Moon, Serenity and Endymion don‚Äôt recognize each other at first. But their weapons and artifacts (Moon Stick, Silver Crystal, roses) move to protect each other before their memories return. These objects become physical anchors of destiny ‚Äî like Bryce and Azriel‚Äôs blades.

‚∏ª

üé≠ 7. The Performance of Identity

Both are wearing masks ‚Äî just not literal ones.
	‚Ä¢	Bryce hides grief under a party-girl persona and a tough exterior. She denies her power, her fate in Prythian and her fae heritage.
	‚Ä¢	Azriel is the weapon, the spy ‚Äî always present, but never seen. He exits the room before it gets too real. Like Bryce, he denies half of himself: the illyrian part of his identity. 

Like Usagi and Mamoru, they must shed their masks to accept the truth ‚Äî themselves as a whole and each other.

‚∏ª

üî• Conclusion: From Tragedy to Rebirth

Bryce and Azriel don‚Äôt just ‚Äúbalance‚Äù each other ‚Äî they rewrite a myth 15,000 years in the making.
	‚Ä¢	Bryce is Thea reborn ‚Äî light returned.
	‚Ä¢	Azriel may carry Aidas‚Äôs legacy ‚Äî shadow reshaped.
	‚Ä¢	Their weapon bond is fate‚Äôs decoy ‚Äî a cover for something deeper.
	‚Ä¢	Their meeting wasn‚Äôt an accident ‚Äî it was written by the cosmos.

This is Serenity and Endymion, once again. But this time, maybe, the love survives the war.

‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt a coincidence. It was destiny. Even if we are reborn in another life, we will find each other again.‚Äù
‚Äî Mamoru Chiba / Tuxedo Mask

‚ÄúWe were always meant to meet, no matter the time, no matter the world.‚Äù
‚Äî Sailor Moon Crystal

‚ÄúOur first love ended in tragedy. But now, in this new life, we can begin again. The stars have always known our names. We just had to find each other again.‚Äù

1l6j0t1,https://i.redd.it/kvfkf9kpwq5f1.png,Angel Batista...the closest thing to a friend! Why I believe he's brought back in Dexter: Resurrection,"With the announcement of the reboot of the Dexter series titled ‚ÄòResurrection,‚Äô I felt compelled to revisit the original series for a dose of nostalgia.

From my initial viewing, one character I never harboured any animosity towards was Angel Batista. His roundabout way of staying close to Dexter and viewing him as his closest friend stood out to me. Each character at the precinct had their own flaws, which were often dramatically portrayed in how they interacted with Dexter.

**The Complex Relationships**

* **Doakes**: Undoubtedly, he possessed sharp instincts as a police officer and was, in my opinion, Dexter‚Äôs greatest threat and truest nemesis. His downfall was hinted at from episode one, characterised by his toxic masculinity, anger issues, and profound dislike for Dexter. Yet, he had no choice but to collaborate with him due to their shared work.
* **LaGuerta**: While she occasionally displayed kindness and care towards certain individuals, her relentless thirst for power blinded her to the realities within her precinct. Her manipulative political manoeuvres were evident in her treatment of Dexter. In Season 1, she sought to use him for her own benefit, making him run errands that served her ambitions. Again, her association with Dexter was driven by necessity.
* **Masuka**: Although he showed moments of insight, particularly during the Bay Harbour Butcher investigation, his obsession with pornographic material often clouded his judgement. His friendship with Dexter seemed more like ‚Äúacceptance by association.‚Äù If not for their camaraderie, Masuka would likely have been seen merely as the quirky lab technician. Their interactions, while friendly, often felt superficial, involving trivial exchanges like taking Dexter‚Äôs coffee. Once more, this relationship was rooted in mutual need.

I trust you can see the pattern emerging. Each of these characters was linked to Dexter because of their individual needs. Naturally, we often form friendships based on the benefits we derive from them, which highlights our imperfect nature as humans.

**The Uniqueness of Angel:**

Ironically, Angel‚Äôs name fits perfectly. He was the sole character who associated with Dexter out of pure intent‚Äîfriendship. Most of their conversations, aside from work-related topics, were meaningful and grounded in real emotions. Although he didn‚Äôt share every detail of his life with Dexter, his connection was not motivated by ulterior motives. Unlike Doakes, whose relationship with Dexter was based on mutual disdain, or Masuka and LaGuerta, whose ties were beneficial, Angel‚Äôs friendship stemmed from genuine affection. While he did ask Dexter for favours, these requests felt more situational than premeditated.

This is why I believe Angel Batista‚Äôs return in *‚ÄòDexter: Resurrection‚Äô* holds significance. In the trailer, we witness him giving Dexter a heartfelt hug, fully aware of his identity as the ‚ÄòBay Harbour Butcher.‚Äô Once again, it‚Äôs symbolic that the first person Dexter encounters after his resurrection is Angel‚Äîor an Angel.

Therefore, even though we only caught a brief glimpse of what '*Dexter: Resurrection'* holds for its audience, I believe Angel's return to the \*Dexter\* series was driven by the mutual affection fans have for his character and his inherently good nature.

I apologise for the lengthy reflection, but I truly appreciate these intricate details that remain consistent throughout the series and films. They illustrate the dedication and hard work of directors, writers, actors, and crew members in producing quality storytelling like this.",18,1749406893.0,Dexter,5,0.88,False

Fran‚Äôs first Snap of the day was Noon. Body checking in front of a mirror only wearing a bra. She then proceeds to post of bunch of photos of the babies doing tummy time on boppy pillows with her mom‚Äôs dogs.
Next Snap are the babies in their high chairs (not strapped in). Poetry has a pillow under her butt because she‚Äôs clearly not big enough for it. They are not eating, just sitting in the container while Jesse is on the sofa in front of them in the living room and Fran recording from behind them.  The babies are happy and playing with toys; Poetry is very loud talking üòÇ
Close to 2pm, she says the morning has been cwazy and she‚Äôs going to get dressed and head into town for coffees and some lunch. Fran says that Poetry has been ‚Äúyapping‚Äù all morning and still constipated. Locket kept her up all night. He was miserable and now he‚Äôs normal and he was like this the other night. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs so normal and happy all day‚Äù but not at night. 
Fran doesn‚Äôt know what to wear today. She guesses she will just wear one of Jesse‚Äôs baggy shirts she wore the other day. 
Jesse is acting like Mr Racho downstairs with the babies.
Fran says she found another hater on TikTok that claims she neglects her babies and she wants them to see her hair today. (Messy, unbrushed,unwashed ponytail). Then says it‚Äôs her hair she‚Äôs neglecting. 
She says it sounds like a fun time downstairs (continues to snap and spent close to 20 mins just on clothes). 
She‚Äôs going to braid her hair and hopes she doesn‚Äôt run into anyone she knows. She claims yesterday she ran into a bunch of people she knows from high school and was happy she looked halfway decent but is now concerned people will see her again today if they go downtown. She says oh god, oh god, I need to figure that out. Otherwise she‚Äôs changing her outfit. 
You can hear Poetry go from loud talking to then crying while Fran applies her sunscreen for the day and lines her lips.
Fran snaps the babies set up inside the pregnancy pillows and says 1000/10.
It‚Äôs a MomCozy cooling pillow so it‚Äôs good for summer and obviously they can hold themselves up but sometimes they are flailing to the side when they‚Äôre too excited. 
Shows the babies fighting over and toy and tells them to share. Shows Poetry biting her knee. Shows Locket fell over üòÇ

1l6iyet,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1l6iyet/5400_lattego_bypass_doser_lid_broken/,5400 LatteGo bypass doser lid broken,"I have had a 5400 LatteGo for THREE DAYS. I filled the hopper at the top with coffee, put the lid down and the bypass doser lid snapped clean off. One of the pegs that guides the door open and shut has come off and fell into the brew group so I had to take the whole machine apart to retrieve it.

I've glued it back up but it will not sit properly in there. I cannot believe such an expensive machine that is so new would be so fragile. Has anyone else had this problem? I've now just had to spend $10 replacing a part on a brand new machine. Absolutely ridiculous.",1,1749406734.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

I have a thousand doubts that I have not hidden from him and he has always been listening and supportive about it. The problem is that I'm having a hard time organizing activities/dates. We live 10 minutes apart and I know that during the week his work is exhausting, but on the weekend he gives priority to other commitments: going out with his buddies, drinking nights etc. I don't understand if it's the cultural difference or what, in Italy new couples who are dating invite each other out even just for a quick coffee. I have tried to talk to him about it several times but I don't understand if he is acting ignorant or what. Am I the one who is not understanding something? Am I making a mistake? I know I have to be patient but I'm having a hard time understanding how his world works",2,1749406645.0,USMilitarySO,6,1.0,False
1l6ix2f,https://www.reddit.com/r/R4R30Plus/comments/1l6ix2f/32_f4m_gulf_coast/,32 [F4M] Gulf Coast,"I‚Äôm a warm, intuitive woman who knows what she wants, and I‚Äôm looking for a man 35-45 who is confident, self-aware & turned on by devotion. I‚Äôm emotionally present, playful, and happiest when things are clear, connected, and just a little off the beaten path.

I‚Äôve built a structured, peaceful life that prioritizes pleasure, purpose, and mutual care. I don‚Äôt bark orders or micromanage. I lead with clarity, warmth, and intention. You should know how to follow, how to listen, and how to worship without losing your spine.

Some of my favorite things:
‚Ä¢ Slow mornings, long looks, quiet obedience
‚Ä¢ Rituals; coffee made just right, scent on skin, a bath by candlelight 
‚Ä¢ Mythology, the sacred feminine, ancient ways of knowing
‚Ä¢ Structure, service, and softness coexisting
‚Ä¢ Floating on open water, shared stillness, and total surrender

I use CBD regularly, rarely drink & love life. 

If you‚Äôre steady, emotionally aware, and want something real but not rushed, tell me what makes you feel most at ease in your life lately. Or which scent you always notice on someone else.
