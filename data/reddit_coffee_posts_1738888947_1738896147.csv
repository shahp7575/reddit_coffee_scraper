It feels really sad to say I can't remember what reciprocation feels like until now. No one has ever asked me on a date before. And I'm almost 24 now. It also happened so fucking FAST homies like wtf. Only been talking for like 2 days. I think it was because I told her I did much better in person when it came to dating.

Thank you!,"Link to copy code, download app, and paste code:\

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1ijkh6m,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenWebUI/comments/1ijkh6m/open_webui_governance_could_a_wordpressstyle/,Open WebUI Governance: Could a WordPress-Style Foundation Be The Secret Sauce?,"Alright people,

I been watching Open WebUI evolve, and frankly‚Ä¶it reminds me of the early days of WordPress (I‚Äôm old, it happens). Back then, it started as a humble blogging tool that eventually exploded into a major platform‚Äîthanks in large part to a community-driven governance model and even the formation of a foundation (peak at MAKE.WORDPRESS.ORG).

This got me thinking:

* **Formal Governance:** Would establishing a formal governance structure benefit Open WebUI‚Äôs long‚Äëterm growth, or would it stifle the flexibility that‚Äôs been key so far? Are there plans for this or something like this?
* **Leadership & Representation:** Should the project eventually adopt a model with a few dedicated public faces, rather than relying on a one‚Äëman band? A true leadership team could be a boon. Tim is amazing, but even with dedicated committers he needs help on so many levels - formalizing it now would be a huge boon, IMHO.
* **Lessons from the Past:** What initial steps would make sense based on experiences from WordPress or other open‚Äësource projects? Any cautionary tales or wins worth noting?

Look, I‚Äôm just a keyboard jockey that smashes keys for a living, but I‚Äôm convinced that if this project captures that early WordPress spirit‚Äîopen collaboration, honest self‚Äëcriticism, and a dash of daring‚Äîit might just steer Open WebUI into something truly epic...well, it's already kind of epic - but you get the point.

Then again, maybe this is all being setup somewhere and I just haven't seen it yet-does anyone know?

Regardless, I'm curious how everyone sees the future of this project.

Where do you see it going?¬†

How do you see it getting there?¬†

And most importantly‚Ä¶ coffee or tea?

Later taters,  
\-j

PS ‚Äì Just so it‚Äôs clear, my ultimate goal is to see Open WebUI transform into an enterprise-level solution and for that I think there needs to be some formalization for it's future. I really believe there‚Äôs a lot to learn from WordPress‚Äîboth the wins and the facepalms.

And the rest of my month is looking just about the same. Loneliness and all those ‚Äúwhy does this never work for me‚Äù feelings are creeping in heavy lately. While I don‚Äôt want a Valentine, I would love some company. I want someone who wants to hold a conversation with me. Wants to talk regularly within reason. Mildly flirtatious - but knows when to pull back. I say want for these things because you should WANT to do it, not feel obligated. Sarcasm is my second language. It should be one of yours too. Please be able to hold a conversation. I might be strong but I definitely don‚Äôt plan to carry this the whole time, it‚Äôs not good for my muscle recovery. In the realm of who I am - I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôm charming, loud, friendly, competitive and empathetic. 

I‚Äôve found that its good to give some subjects for talking points so below you will my interests and my FAQ. If you‚Äôre reading this and thinking - this girls weird - it will get weirder. Promise. 

My interests/hobbies include but are not limited to: 

‚Ä¢Being creative: crafting, writing, trying a new medium and leaving projects undone. So many projects undone. 

‚Ä¢Watching sports: preferably the NFL & MLB. I like the 49ers and the Giants. Because just like my taste in men, my sports teams on occasion are good, and then they‚Äôre really bad most of the time. 

‚Ä¢Weight Lifting: I‚Äôm a strong girl, my goal this year is to leg press 1,000lbs and maybe read up on power lifting. Right now it‚Äôs strength focused with that one goal of leg press. 

‚Ä¢Coffee/Beer/Wine: More so the experience of consuming these things. Trying new coffee shops on the weekend, beer and corn hole with friends on a Sunday afternoon, a wine bar and tapas for a change of pace in the evening. 

‚Ä¢Concerts/Shows/Live Music: I have been to 200+. I have tickets to 3 already this year if you include warped tour 4. I love music and I love discovering music. You‚Äôll find me at my local record store at least 3x a month. 

FAQ: 

What do I look like? I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6ish and I‚Äôm on the thicker/chubby side. I‚Äôm not degrading myself I am describing myself. Here is me: https://imgur.com/a/rlvsryH  I‚Äôve included some with and without makeup as well as full body. 

What don‚Äôt you like? I don‚Äôt like anime or video games. You can but I don‚Äôt. I also have a huge thing about people trying to peacock and people being critics just to hear themselves talk. 

Whats my schedule like? I work in customer relations/warranties M-F and I get up incredibly early and go to bed early during the week. I‚Äôm perfect for an east coaster due to this. But also anyone who actually cares about sleep or at the very least, my sleep. My day is usually ~4am-9pm during the week. Weekends I try to be a night owl, but jury is still out if 11 is late. 

What is my type? I‚Äôve quite honestly dated and interacted with a melting pot of men. I‚Äôm attracted typically to style/vibes first, kindness second, looks third. But looks still matter in regard to attraction. I‚Äôd like l see a picture sooner than later. I don‚Äôt have a specific type but mustaches and beards tend to be prevalent in the pool of men I‚Äôll be seeing in hell. 

Can we move off reddit? With time I‚Äôm open to that but to start I prefer chat on Reddit a bit. But at 31 I‚Äôm not having a Snapstreak with you. Snapchat isn‚Äôt for me anymore, other apps are fine. 

What am I looking for? I genuinely want someone to be as excited to see my name pop up as I am theirs. Friend, partner or otherwise. I don‚Äôt want to put too many perimeters as to what I‚Äôm looking for because I‚Äôm flexible. What I want is a good conversation that flows and a connection/spark. Aged ~26-40 (some flexibility)

1ijkcw7,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostafriend/comments/1ijkcw7/my_friendship_is_a_zombie/,My friendship is a zombie.,"My ""friend"" became very possessive after I became close to a boy she introduced me to. She accused me of paying more attention to him than her, complained that I hugged him and not her, and that my hugs were ""a luxury one had to earn"". She said that I only spoke about him, that every time she tried to change the subject, I returned to him. That she was reconsidering our friendship because she was a third wheel and she didn't want to waste time. Thing is, that's not true at all. We were close. Very close. We jokingly called each other ""wife"", worked together in almost every assignment, held hands, told each other secrets and I even invited her to my home. I don't invite just anyone to my home because I'm not good with people. I'm always afraid that other people are going to hurt me. I don't hug people most of the time. The only reason I hugged that boy was because I was trying to make him feel welcome. He was shy, so I thought maybe he would feel more comfortable talking to someone he had stuff in common with (you know, because he was her friend and all). Besides, I hugged her all the time. Hell, many people even thought we were a couple. I was always focusing on her, my world revolved around her. She was always surrounded by friends of all kinds who talked to her about things that I didn't get, but I was happy to see that she had people who loved her. I was happy that she was not alone, that she had the love she deserved, because she had so much love to give. Yet I have one friend who is not her and she loses her crap. I apologized back then, for making her feel like she wasn't enough. I apologized and promised I would never make her feel like a third wheel, so I made sure to pay attention to her for weeks. She was the center of my universe. Everything I did, I thought of her. I stayed away from the boy, basically hid whatever signs of friendship we had and focused solely on her. I was basically her lapdog. The only time I allowed myself to speak with the boy was when we were going home. You know what's funny? Even after that, she posted vaguely in Instagram talking about friends who disappointed her and comparing me to a childhood friend she has that never did. She said she wanted distance. That she was not sore that I had other friends (except that she is, because her friends are not my friends so I didn't talk to them much). She said she wanted distance, yet when we saw each other again, she acted like nothing happened. She smiled, laughed, gave me hugs that I no longer wanted and talked to me about her hyperfixations. I tried talking to her about it, telling her how her possessiveness made me feel uncomfortable, and that it was unfair that I could not have friends when she had many. She turned it around on me, saying that I chose a man over her (I'm asexual), sending pictures of herself crying, telling me I needed to prove my friendship through actions and that she really didn't mind me having friends. 

Oh, and remember when I said she told me that I wouldn't stop talking about the boy? She said the same thing about a friend who left her. Now I wonder if she was telling the truth about that. The friend had asked her if they could get coffee and talk about what caused their friendship to fail, but when she told me about it, she said the ex-friend was ""begging her to be friends again"". I don't believe a word she says.

Just because I hug some people doesn't mean she's entitled to get hugs as well (even when I did give her hugs!)

Now I resent that she calls me ""wife"" because I feel more like an accessory than a person. She acts like I'm cheating on her too.

I hate that I let her be so close to me, because I forgot people can hurt other people easily. If I hadn't let her, this would not be happening.

I keep contact with the boy, but it still feels like I'm having to hide this friendship from her. 

Technically, we are still friends. She still acts like normal, even when she caused both the boy and me to have anxiety attacks. She still laughs, hugs me and talks to me about the things she likes. She said that she missed me a lot last time we saw each other, ""we haven't talked in a while"", she said. Even when I'm the one who's always messaging her. 

The only reason we're still friends is because I still need to finish working with her and I would rather make it bearable.

I'm so disillusioned on the concept on friendships recently. A part of me still thinks this is all on me, and that maybe I could have done better. Most of the friendships I've had were toxic, and I've been the common denominator.

And the rest of my month is looking just about the same. Loneliness and all those ‚Äúwhy does this never work for me‚Äù feelings are creeping in heavy lately. While I don‚Äôt want a Valentine, I would love some company. I want someone who wants to hold a conversation with me. Wants to talk regularly within reason. Mildly flirtatious - but knows when to pull back. I say want for these things because you should WANT to do it, not feel obligated. Sarcasm is my second language. It should be one of yours too. Please be able to hold a conversation. I might be strong but I definitely don‚Äôt plan to carry this the whole time, it‚Äôs not good for my muscle recovery. In the realm of who I am - I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôm charming, loud, friendly, competitive and empathetic. 

I‚Äôve found that its good to give some subjects for talking points so below you will my interests and my FAQ. If you‚Äôre reading this and thinking - this girls weird - it will get weirder. Promise. 

My interests/hobbies include but are not limited to: 

‚Ä¢Being creative: crafting, writing, trying a new medium and leaving projects undone. So many projects undone. 

‚Ä¢Watching sports: preferably the NFL & MLB. I like the 49ers and the Giants. Because just like my taste in men, my sports teams on occasion are good, and then they‚Äôre really bad most of the time. 

‚Ä¢Weight Lifting: I‚Äôm a strong girl, my goal this year is to leg press 1,000lbs and maybe read up on power lifting. Right now it‚Äôs strength focused with that one goal of leg press. 

‚Ä¢Coffee/Beer/Wine: More so the experience of consuming these things. Trying new coffee shops on the weekend, beer and corn hole with friends on a Sunday afternoon, a wine bar and tapas for a change of pace in the evening. 

‚Ä¢Concerts/Shows/Live Music: I have been to 200+. I have tickets to 3 already this year if you include warped tour 4. I love music and I love discovering music. You‚Äôll find me at my local record store at least 3x a month. 

FAQ: 

What do I look like? I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6ish and I‚Äôm on the thicker/chubby side. I‚Äôm not degrading myself I am describing myself. Here is me: https://imgur.com/a/rlvsryH  I‚Äôve included some with and without makeup as well as full body. 

What don‚Äôt you like? I don‚Äôt like anime or video games. You can but I don‚Äôt. I also have a huge thing about people trying to peacock and people being critics just to hear themselves talk. 

Whats my schedule like? I work in customer relations/warranties M-F and I get up incredibly early and go to bed early during the week. I‚Äôm perfect for an east coaster due to this. But also anyone who actually cares about sleep or at the very least, my sleep. My day is usually ~4am-9pm during the week. Weekends I try to be a night owl, but jury is still out if 11 is late. 

What is my type? I‚Äôve quite honestly dated and interacted with a melting pot of men. I‚Äôm attracted typically to style/vibes first, kindness second, looks third. But looks still matter in regard to attraction. I‚Äôd like l see a picture sooner than later. I don‚Äôt have a specific type but mustaches and beards tend to be prevalent in the pool of men I‚Äôll be seeing in hell. 

Can we move off reddit? With time I‚Äôm open to that but to start I prefer chat on Reddit a bit. But at 31 I‚Äôm not having a Snapstreak with you. Snapchat isn‚Äôt for me anymore, other apps are fine. 

What am I looking for? I genuinely want someone to be as excited to see my name pop up as I am theirs. Friend, partner or otherwise. I don‚Äôt want to put too many perimeters as to what I‚Äôm looking for because I‚Äôm flexible. What I want is a good conversation that flows and a connection/spark. Aged ~26-40 (some flexibility)

George dates a soldier for the free few months of deployment + goodbye/return sex but she never deploys. Elaine gets a virus on her BFs expensive computer,"Kramer starts to grow his own plants in the windowsill. He quickly graduates to more and more til he puts plastic up and turns his whole place into a greenhouse. He's always sweaty and wet but swears its good for his mental health and the home grown (tiny) veggies are worth it. He slowly spreads it to Jerrys too by putting plastic tubes between their places. ""We're just back and forth all the time, I couldn't afford to lose moisture every time I come over for a snack, or to go number 2, or to use your toothpaste"" ""...what?

Jerry dates a herpetologist with pet lizards that she claims are harmless but that constantly hiss at and bite Jerry. He is terrified of them.

George dates a female soldier. She keeps saying she's up for deployment. He loves the idea -- they date a few months at a time and right when things get serious, she goes across the world for up to 18 months after goodbye sex. He's single then she returns, they have return sex, and they're back to square 1. 

..except she never deploys. Something always comes up last minute - an injury, change in command, etc. George feels he's put in too much time and if she is deployed they will try long distance and he'll be celibate again until she returns. 

Elaine dates a wealthy IT guy. He leaves his computer (custom built, >$5,000) open when he goes to work. He asks her to just ""lock up on your way out"". She lounges, makes coffee, and then tries to do some online shopping on his computer. Instead she downloads a virus and thinks she's destroyed his baby.

 Jerry's GF goes out of town (upsetting George because she's ""deploying"" on a herpetological conference for a week and his GF is constantly with him). He watches the lizards as she brings them in their tanks to his place (""they're so social! They need company!"" As they lunge at Jerry)

When feeding one a mouse it leaps at him and he knocks the glass over. All of them escape into the jungle-like apartments and ""hunt"" Jerry and Kramer, who need to make their way to the A/C thermostat to lower the temperature and get the lizards tired and lethargic to catch them.

I notice when we do get into arguments she can get manipulative but I find myself to be emotionally intelligent of others.

1ijk239,https://i.redd.it/yr05wxjgkmhe1.png,"Friday, February 07, 2025 | Word of The Day ""Respite"" - The Sweet Symphony of Fridays: Why We All Celebrate the Weekend ‚Ä¢ [Click to Expand]","## Beyond the Workweek: Unpacking the Philosophy of 'Thank God It‚Äôs Friday



There‚Äôs something magical about Fridays. Maybe it‚Äôs the way the week‚Äôs burdens start to lift, or how we find ourselves counting down the hours until we can finally sink into the blissful arms of the weekend. We‚Äôve all said it, perhaps even unconsciously, as the clock ticks closer to 5 p.m.: ‚ÄúThank God it‚Äôs Friday.‚Äù But have you ever paused to think about why this phrase resonates so deeply with us? It‚Äôs more than just an expression of relief; it‚Äôs a philosophy, a cultural phenomenon, and a reminder of how we navigate life‚Äôs rhythms.  

So, let‚Äôs take a moment to explore the deeper meaning behind this phrase. Why do we cherish Fridays so much? And what does our love for them say about the way we live, work, and seek fulfillment?

### The Universal Appeal of Fridays  

Let‚Äôs start with the obvious: Fridays symbolize freedom. After a week of alarm clocks, deadlines, and responsibilities, Friday is the beacon of light at the end of a long tunnel. It‚Äôs the gateway to the weekend‚Äîa time traditionally reserved for rest, recreation, and reconnection.  

Think about it. On Monday, you‚Äôre gearing up for the week ahead. By Wednesday, you‚Äôre knee-deep in tasks. But Friday? It‚Äôs like reaching the summit of a mountain. The climb was tough, but the view is worth it. For many, Friday evening marks the start of something sacred‚Äîa time to put work aside and focus on life‚Äôs other dimensions.  

For me, Fridays have always been special. I remember as a kid, Friday nights meant pizza, a movie with the family, and the promise of sleeping in the next morning. Even now, as an adult, there‚Äôs a ritualistic feel to Friday evenings. It‚Äôs not just about what I do but the mindset I enter: one of possibility and permission to pause.  

### A Reflection on the Workweek  

But here‚Äôs the thing‚Äîour love for Fridays also shines a light on the structure of our lives. In many ways, the phrase ‚ÄúThank God it‚Äôs Friday‚Äù reveals our collective relationship with work. Why do we need a designated day to feel this sense of relief?  

For many, the workweek can feel like a grind‚Äîa cycle of effort that often leaves little room for spontaneity or joy. Fridays stand out because they‚Äôre different. They remind us that life isn‚Äôt just about productivity; it‚Äôs also about presence and pleasure.  

Philosophers have long pondered the balance between work and leisure. Aristotle, for example, believed that leisure was essential to living a good life. He saw it not as idleness but as an opportunity for reflection, creativity, and growth. Fridays, in a way, embody this Aristotelian ideal. They invite us to step back, reflect, and engage in activities that nourish our souls.  

### The Emotional Shift of Fridays  

Have you noticed how your mood changes as Friday approaches? There‚Äôs a psychological phenomenon at play here. Studies have shown that people tend to feel happier on Fridays, even if their plans for the weekend aren‚Äôt particularly exciting. This ‚ÄúFriday feeling‚Äù is a testament to the power of anticipation.  

Anticipation is a kind of joy in itself. Knowing that a break is coming allows us to push through challenges and maintain hope. It‚Äôs like running a race and seeing the finish line ahead‚Äîyou might still be tired, but the promise of rest gives you the energy to keep going.  

This emotional shift isn‚Äôt just limited to individuals. It‚Äôs a cultural experience. Think about how workplaces often have a lighter atmosphere on Fridays. Casual dress codes, end-of-week meetings, and even office celebrations all contribute to the collective sense of relief and camaraderie.  

### The Danger of Living for Fridays  

However, as much as I love Fridays, I also recognize a potential pitfall: the danger of living for them. When we place too much emphasis on Fridays, we risk undervaluing the rest of the week. Life is happening every day, not just when the weekend arrives.  

I once had a friend who constantly said, ‚ÄúI just need to get through the week.‚Äù It struck me as a sad way to live‚Äîtreating five out of seven days as mere hurdles to overcome. Fridays should be a celebration, yes, but not at the expense of finding joy and meaning in the other days.  

This is where the philosophy of mindfulness comes in. Instead of seeing Monday through Thursday as a slog, we can approach each day with curiosity and gratitude. Maybe it‚Äôs the cup of coffee you savor on a Tuesday morning or the engaging conversation you have with a colleague on a Wednesday afternoon. These moments are just as valuable as the freedom of Friday night.  

### Reclaiming the Spirit of Fridays  

So, how can we take the spirit of Fridays and spread it throughout the week? One idea is to build micro-breaks and moments of joy into your daily routine. Instead of waiting for the weekend to relax, find small ways to recharge during the week.  

For example, I‚Äôve started treating Wednesday evenings like a mini-Friday. I‚Äôll cook a favorite meal, call a friend, or watch a show that makes me laugh. These small rituals help me stay connected to the present moment and remind me that joy isn‚Äôt limited to the end of the week.  

Another approach is to reframe how we think about work. Instead of viewing it as a necessary evil, we can look for opportunities to infuse our tasks with purpose and creativity. After all, work isn‚Äôt just about earning a paycheck; it‚Äôs also about contributing to something larger than ourselves.  

### Fridays as a Metaphor for Balance  

At its core, ‚ÄúThank God it‚Äôs Friday‚Äù is a celebration of balance. It‚Äôs a recognition that we need both effort and ease, work and play, structure and freedom. Fridays teach us the value of rhythm in our lives‚Äîthe importance of having time to push forward and time to step back.  

As the poet Khalil Gibran once wrote, ‚ÄúWork is love made visible.‚Äù But he also reminded us that rest is just as vital: ‚ÄúAnd what is it to cease working but to be at peace with your thoughts and memories?‚Äù Fridays, in their unique way, embody both of these truths.  

### In Closing  

So, the next time you say, ‚ÄúThank God it‚Äôs Friday,‚Äù take a moment to reflect on what that means to you. Is it about escaping the pressures of the week? Or is it about embracing the possibilities of rest, connection, and joy?  

Fridays are a gift, but they‚Äôre also a reminder. They remind us to seek balance, to find meaning in our work, and to cherish the moments of freedom that come our way. And perhaps most importantly, they remind us that life‚Äôs beauty isn‚Äôt confined to any one day‚Äîit‚Äôs woven into every moment, if we‚Äôre willing to see it.

My parents and close friends know I smoke but not how much, almost a pack a day at this point. If the rest of my family knew I smoke they wouldn't be happy, as my uncle died of esophagael cancer a couple years ago. At family gathos and stuff I say I need something from my car or am going to the toilet and they haven't caught on.

Fuck as I sit here writing this this morning I had 3 with my morning coffee and I'm lighting up one more as I write this. I procrastinate study and chores all day with having a cigarette and all that time wasted adds up. 

I'm just a bit fearful of quitting because I've used them as a crutch for so long. I'm 26 now and having been vaping or smoking since I was 19. I've never smoked as much as I'm smoking now though.

I'm 75% through alen carrs easy way to quit smoking and I have so much hope that I can break the habit. Already so many things have come to light from this book but it's like stepping into cold water or jumping into the unknown and I'm nervous about it but I will try because I hate myself for smoking so much.

I haven't been honest to anyone about this before but it feels good to get off my chest. If anyone has any advice please tell me. I want to be free from this vice and live a healthier life instead of smoking 24/7. Cheers",6,1738893811.0,confession,2,1.0,False

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig some day, but right now I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, and my iPad. So, like, pretty much everything but PC üòÖ I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pok√©mon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. Never really gotten the chance to play any TTRPGs, but would love to.

I suffer from a bit of learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf üôÉ

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. Pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills üòÖ But I'm trying new recipes all the time and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking though, and I love smoked meats ü§§

1ijjz69,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1ijjz69/glitter_and_eggplants/,Glitter and... eggplants.,"14 years ago I met this guy on PoF. We hung out a few times, and became friendly but he was a bit younger than me and we were leading very different lives, so I wasn't interested in more than FWB. 

He tried to convince me otherwise; I made beautiful kids (I had 2) and I was so intelligent, he could really see having a family with me. I was a single mom, temporarily living with my parents again, working part-time, and receiving benefits. Meanwhile he was studying business and political science, with a senate seat as his eventual goal. Even at 23 I knew this was a BAD idea for his future projections, so I continued to turn him down until communication just petered out. 

Fast forward 6ish years, I'd freshly gotten out of a nasty relationship, was working for my SIL, and Mr. Future Senator came into the store. Turns out he was working up the street, but came in for coffee every few days on lunch. We struck up a friendship again, and I finally agreed to a real date and considering a romantic relationship. He had let go of his political aspirations and was pursuing a career in finance- I can deal with that; chances of being in the public eye were slim to none! 

He immediately starts talking about wanting to have babies and get married... even had me looking at houses in another state! I'm telling him to slow down, but we keep dating (I know Charlotte, I know, don't side-eye me). Thanksgiving rolls around, I was cooking and had people coming, but he invites me for dessert to meet the family (very upper middle class/devout Catholics btw). Anyway I get pulled over on my drive, car gets impounded because I forgot to pay my insurance, and he DOESN'T ANSWER THE PHONE the rest of the night. I had to call around for an hour plus until I found someone sober to pick me up and take me home, then text him and tell him to lose my number. I could have been home with friends and my kids. 

Something inside me tells me to start digging though. Now as a rule of thumb, I don't have people I date on my socials- I'm very private about my relationships- but his IG was public. I don't see anything weird until I look at his tagged photos. A woman I didn't recognize in a posed photo FROM THAT DAY, and the caption mentioned her joy in spending the day with his family. 

GIRL HE WAS GOING TO SEND HER HOME AND THEN HAVE ME OVERRRRR. I keep scrolling and find out they'd been together FOUR YEARS. 

A few days later, he comes into my job to ""apologize"". He got drunk, his phone died, blah blah blah. I pretend it's water under the bridge. I ask his schedule for the week, make fake plans, and hit the mall that night. 

The next day, SIL & coworker show up to his bank to hand-deliver a giant card, complete with glitter pocket, exposing him, with a bouquet of lollipop ""eggplants"" of all sizes and colors. In front of colleagues and in the middle of a meeting with clients. While they filmed that encounter, I messaged the other girlfriend and told her everything. 

Eventually we became friendly, she forgave him, and they actually helped me move. They're now married, but I recently found out he hooked up with a friend of mine last year. He constantly asks about me, and while buying *pics* from her just this week, decided without provocation, to send her pics of he and I from back in the day. I moved in 2018, and have been in an amazing relationship since late 2020. He and I don't talk anymore, and I didn't even know he had any images of us together. 

There may be a bigger bouquet delivered to his new bank... and I'll be sending his wife the glitter card this time. ",3,1738893691.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

1ijjv86,https://www.reddit.com/r/chiari/comments/1ijjv86/1_year_postop/,1 Year Post-Op,"I am officially 1 year post-op today! 

I've posted a lot here through my chiari journey, so it seemed right to post an update today. This past year has been the best year of my life. Recovery was, well, recovery. But being (mostly) pain-free and being able to watch my body heal and grow stronger instead of deteriorate has been so incredible. And I wouldn't have been able to be where I am today and to have had all the experiences I've had this past year without the surgery. 

I'm going to try to keep this brief, but I'm always open to answering questions or sharing more through comments or chat. 

Pros: I'm alive. I genuinely don't think that would be true today with how many symptoms kept appearing and how much my body kept worsening over the thirteen months from the main onset of symptoms to surgery. 

I'm not disabled (I was on disability leave right before the surgery and still getting worse, so this is a big turn around).

My cognitive function was fully restored, which was heavily affected by Chiari. 

I got off all of the medications I had to take for symptoms (muscle relaxers, pain meds, beta blockers, migraine injections/rescue meds).

I don't go to doctors appointments every other week anymore.

I haven‚Äôt a migraine in a year.

I haven't had a headache that lasted more than a couple hours in a year ( and the ones that did happen weren't painful like before)

Almost all of my symptoms went away. 

I can read, write, drink coffee, hug my friends and family without pain, enjoy food, go to college, go out with friends. 

Now, some negatives/harder parts:

Recovery was a lot of work. And it's still happening. I'm recovered from the surgery, but my body's still building back it's strength from the damage done to it before surgery. I've had to put a lot of time and work and patience into building those muscles back and getting my body used to moving again. And being kind to myself and making adjustments when I need to be gentler. 

It's hard to try to live a ""normal"" life after. It took awhile (and sometimes I still find myself doing it) to remember that I'm not the same as before. I don't need to remember to take my meds. I don't need to flinch if someone turns on a bright light, hoping I'm fast enough to not start a migraine. There's still times where I hesitate because it got so ingrained in me that so many regular things or things I love caused pain. 

The only symptoms that I really deal with now is the scoliosis/lordosis. It doesn't usually bother me, but where my muscles of my back aren't built up that great still, when I push myself the back pain definitely let's me know. But I'm working to strengthen the area, so hopefully that will help. 

There's also still some uncertainty. I had a suboccipital craniotomy/c1 laminectomy without opening the dura. When the surgery happened, my doctor was very confident with my recovery, but mentioned a second decompression surgery is an option if needed in the future. I've heard stories or seen people on here talk about needing multiple or about symptoms returning even after a year. So, that's a concern I still have. Being a little worried about that and if this will still impact my future.

On the note about future, I've had a hard time balancing between wanting to plan everything and enjoying the moment. When I think long-term about stuff like partners and kids, it gets overwhelming. I know a lot of people with chiari have families (and that's amazing!), but for me it's hard to think about those things knowing it might come back. I'm not saying there's any right or wrong answer, mostly that there's a lot of uncertainty for me and that's hard to think through when it's still fresh. I'm 20, though, so I've kind of made an agreement with myself not to worry about that for a bit. Maybe 25... I could go on a much longer rant, but I'll stop there. 

Okay, now for the fun stuff. I'm celebrating tonight. Keeping it simple with a movie night and take out dinner. Ice cream and doing things I love, like writing and reading. Listening to some good music (blu eyes and Halsey are my go-to right now when I'm in a chiari/chronic illness mood). I also got a bunny that has a chiari sign on it from my mother and she stitched a scar into the back of it's head to match mine. Which is kind of awesome and also kind of disturbing to take out of the box lol. 

I like to post on here in the hopes that it helps others going through their chiari journeys. That maybe my experience can help others. I also think the more we share, the more we learn about chiari and life with it. If you have any ideas or opinions, I'd love to hear them. If you have any questions, I'm happy to try to answer. Thanks for reading the long post if you made it this far. 

Also: Do you celebrate your surgery anniversary?

 Do you have a name for it? I'm thinking second chance day or anti-death day? Something fun like that.",1,1738893364.0,chiari,0,1.0,False

Living on the west coast. Working one of those office jobs where I spend the day dreaming of making a living building furniture. I love music, and even play music. Maybe one day I will stop being a wuss and actually perform. NO. I don‚Äôt play DAD rock. So I will not talk your ear off about the importance of Punk Music or why some drummer is underrated. I am back in school, or more like I never really left. I am one of those people who take classes as a hobby. However I am trying to make a career change. I am a big fan of used book stores, thrift stores, galleries and museums. Yes, I have eReader but, a physical books just the business.

I am an atheist and very left learning. Just putting that out there for those in which this matters. I canvassed for Harris and have no shame in saying I‚Äôve done so. I am pretty open and do not require you to be just like me. I care about the environment. Climate Change is indeed anthropogenic.  I have been trying to get more active and reached out to organizations like the Sierra Club. I am very atheist. Never ‚Äúlost my faith‚Äù since I never had it. Am I terrified right now? Yes. I have lost sleep over current events and what the future may hold.

Dry texter so bear with me. I kinda hate using my phone, hence the dry texting. Come at me with your book or podcast recommendations. Got volunteer or activism suggestions? Tell me.

I‚Äôve known him for 12 years and the first 5 years I was his side chick. *insert judgement here I know* at the beginning he would use me to cheat on any other person he was with. Nonetheless what goes around comes around and in 2022 he cheated on me with his coworker. (8 year age gap) He was leaving in the middle of the night caught by security camera and non stop phone calls and texts caught by Verizon. This is just the back story that doesn‚Äôt matter to me anymore. The coworker and him have a four month old baby now and still live in my old house. Yes with all the furniture and household items we bought together. What I want to share is in July 2024, I went no contact. He texted me to wish me a happy birthday then started arguing with me about his sister on an unrelated topic. It was the night before my birthday and I decided I didn‚Äôt want this anymore. We weren‚Äôt together and he had no right to yell at me. A few weeks went by and I started throwing away things I had that were from the old house, given to me by him or his family or something I wanted to originally keep but now decided against. It started with coffee cups I had in my office then to clothes that I wore with him. Everything just went into the trash. I had a keychain from his old keys in my purse and I threw it out my window driving on the highway. My emotions and life started changing. I no longer held anything towards him. He would leave me voicemails and his voice didn‚Äôt sting like it used to. He still tries to email me and I have no feeling to need/want to answer. The feelings of attachment to him left with every item I threw away. I felt relief and peace not having anything to remember him by. I cleared out every photo I had from my phone, and any files that pertained to him. 

 What sucks is that I still miss him. It was nice to pretend I had one friend in this world even if that person wasn‚Äôt good to me. I want to break no contact and reach out to see how things are going but I have to remember that he doesn‚Äôt deserve it. I don‚Äôt deserve it if he chooses to yell at me.

I‚Äôm a grad student at a big university. During graduation my fianc√© and I went to the university‚Äôs shopping center to get some coffee creamer. When we came out we saw a beautiful Siamese cat. He was rubbing on our legs and clearly had a home. We picked him up and brought him to so we could take him to a vet to look for a microchip, but he didn‚Äôt have one. I searched every website I could to look for an owner, but no one was looking for him. We‚Äôre pretty sure he was abandoned by a student who wanted a designer cat, but didn‚Äôt care to keep him after they left campus. He‚Äôs an asshole! He bites our ankles, tackles his siblings, and eats everything he can find. He has eaten hundreds of dollars of cables and needed two emergency surgeries for eating foam. While it has cost us a fortune, he is the best! We love him so much. He‚Äôs bonded with his brother and they regularly snuggle and bathe each other. He sits on my chest after a long day and loves my new heated blanket. I can‚Äôt imagine who could give him up. We intended to have one cat. We‚Äôre now have 4 after finding the rest outside and in need of love. We‚Äôre a family and Brian is an essential piece of it!

‚úîÔ∏è 45 Minute Block Toward Paper

I am struggling with chronic procrastination and anxiety around doing any schoolwork. This was exacerbated by feedback I received on my project. I love the idea of No Zero Days, but am worried that the long ""to do list"" is interrupting my ability to work deeply on things I need to (which I am stressed over, anyhow). My brain will come up with any reason to not do the work, and if I can check off a tab in my ""beautiful life"" category for getting a nice coffee (when the point of going to the cafe was to work on my laptop), it is easier for me to feel accomplished and just move on without doing work. 

I did a lot of research on procrastination and what I've found is that procrastination is self-harm. It is a way of hurting yourself, acting against your best judgment and goals, and ensuring that future you is even worse off. I am trying to reconcile with what I've been doing to myself all this time through my avoidance and procrastination of actual work. I am trying to allow myself forgiveness and to move on from those bad habits. 

I am someone who does a lot of self-care, and a lot of ""productive"" procrastination (other things besides academics on this list, probably). But today, I had to tell myself straight that self-care right now is doing the work. Productivity is more than a check box but a long term effort that I have to show up for every day. I don't expect myself to sit down for hours on end, but I have to at least sit down and do something. I struggle with this a lot, which is why we are all here. But I need to ensure that I'm focused on what needs to be done.

Fired for being too ambitious, we are now building Quaintum, a new generation of AI agents that operate like quantum computers. No restrictions, no predefined paths, just innovation.

**The Origin Story**

Laid off ‚Üí Worked in coffee shops ‚Üí Built tech that actually works. Your loss, CERN.

**Why a Token?**

* Burn tokens to power quantum-AI agents.
* Hold tokens to influence development.

**Why Solana?**

Fast. Scalable. Not burdened by Ethereum‚Äôs $100 gas fees. We tried ETH‚Äîlearned the hard way.

**The Quantum Advantage**

While AI has seen rapid advancements, classical AI models are limited by computational constraints. Quaintum introduces AI agents that think and process information like quantum computers, enabling:

* Superposition-based decision-making: Agents analyze multiple outcomes simultaneously.
* Parallelized reasoning: Exponentially faster problem-solving.
* Non-linear adaptability: AI that learns and evolves in real-time with minimal energy costs.

This is about unlocking AI capabilities that traditional computing simply cannot handle.

**The Vision**

We are building:

* AI agents that surpass classical models
* DeFi frameworks that operate with quantum logic
* Next-gen NFT and gaming ecosystems leveraging quantum-inspired intelligence

The code is open-source. No VCs. Just physicists, engineers, and relentless ambition. We‚Äôre here to push boundaries.

1ijjmxn,https://www.reddit.com/r/RunningShoeGeeks/comments/1ijjmxn/qiaodan_feiying_pb_50/,Qiaodan Feiying PB 5.0,"TLDR: Very nice marathon race day shoe. Super lightweight, stable (perhaps the 'lower' stack helps here), good traction, easy turnover, smooth ride. Fit and feel is awesome for me as well (offers some arch support). These are top quality racing shoes!

* Price: $104 (total - before all the recent tariff nonsense! Ordered from AliExpress on Jan 14; arrived at my door on Jan 22 (Southern California)).
* Size: US Mens 9 (EUR 42.5); seems to fit me TTS (I wear a 9 in the AP3, Superblast 2, Boston 12).
* Weight: \~197g (6.9 ounces) (used my coffee scale - there was a <1g difference between left and right)
* Drop: 7mm (34/27)
* Pics: [https://imgur.com/a/ZgbO4YT](https://imgur.com/a/ZgbO4YT)

My use case: The main thing that attracted me to these were the mentions of arch support in the marketing and the 'lower' stack height. One review I found on YouTube mentioned they were on the firmer side as well (reading the reviews of the AP4 have scared me away from them as I don't like 'soft'). I am in search of a race day shoe (I am NOT fast by any means) - I quite loved my AP3s, but they did give me a small blister issue. So I bought these and the Saucony EP4s to see which I like best. (Inspired to try these after reading this recent post: https://www.reddit.com/r/RunningShoeGeeks/comments/1i0b365/comment/m74nzqj/?context=3&rdt=47278)

* Unboxing impressions: These come in a fancy, heavyweight box. The details and design in just the box are very nice, so I was super excited for the shoes right away given the quality of packaging. (Yes, I know it's just a box, but it's a \*really\* nice box!) The color is listed as Flaming Red/Jordan White (translated); they're more orange/red or flamin' hot red than deep red (the online pictures made them look a bit deeper red to me).
* The upper: A knit mesh. Looks like lots of air flow. It's a bit 'plasticy' like the AP3. Gives off racing shoe vibes for sure. The heel counter is a rigid piece on the back (it's the area with the 42.195km mark). The rest of the back is lightly cushioned, with a bit more padding around the collar. The laces have the 'caterpillar' on the ends (basically just the part you would tie) but the rest of the laces are flat. A nice detail. The laces are a touch stretchy. The tongue is secured only on the inside (medial) side of the shoe by a few stitches (if you look at the pics you can see the stitches just under the eyelets). It's a minimal tongue - feels a lot like the AP3 to me.
* The midsole: Dual density layered midsole. The gold shimmery layer is softer, and the bottom red layer is stiffer. So it looks like the forefoot is going to have some bounce (this maybe isn't for heel strikers?).

First run(s) impressions:

* First run was 3 miles on a treadmill - various paces, but mostly just to get a feel for them and work out lacing, etc. - just wanted to make sure they felt good before taking them outside. Fit is very nice 'race day' type feel.
* Second run was 18 miles long run - these felt really good! No blisters or hot spots, adequate arch support. I'd say these were pretty stable, better than the AP3 for me. Bounce was good (although I am wondering if they'll loosen up a touch with a few more miles in them). Traction was really good too (it was lightly raining or wet pavement for much of the run). Overall very solid shoe that could definitely be a great marathon racer. It's so lightweight, turnover just kept me going along - just did what they needed too and it was one of those shoes I didn't really notice which is always good.
* Third run was 6 miles with some sprints - Again these felt great. Easily can pick up the pace in these - definitely felt a bit bouncier, so very good energy return.",8,1738892654.0,RunningShoeGeeks,1,0.9,False

1ijjl91,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hiphopcirclejerk/comments/1ijjl91/i_got_chills/,I got chills,"It was a bitterly cold afternoon in Chicago, the kind where the wind cuts through layers like a blade, and the snow turns the streets into a slushy mess. Kanye West sat in the corner of a dimly lit coffee shop in the South Side, nursing an Americano and tapping furiously at his phone. His face was hidden behind oversized sunglasses, but the irritation in his body language was obvious‚Äîhe was waiting for someone.  

The bell above the door jingled, and in walked Eminem, wrapped in a thick hoodie, his eyes scanning the place warily. He spotted Kanye and walked over, shaking his head as he pulled out a chair.  

""Man, I don't know why I even agreed to this,"" Em muttered, rubbing his hands together for warmth. ""You been talking crazy lately. I don‚Äôt do crazy.""  

Kanye smirked, setting his phone down. ""Nah, listen, this ain't crazy. I swear, bro, this is real. I got a message from a mutual friend.""  

Eminem arched an eyebrow. ""What mutual friend?""  

Kanye leaned in, lowering his voice. ""Pac.""  

Eminem blinked. ""You mean... Tupac?""  

""Yeah, Tupac,"" Kanye said, like it was the most natural thing in the world. ""And before you start, no, I ain't trippin'. I got the call last night. Some dude claiming to be him hit me up. Said he‚Äôs back. Said he needed to talk.""  

Eminem leaned back, rubbing his chin. ""Kanye, you of all people should know how ridiculous that sounds.""  

Kanye shrugged. ""You don't gotta believe me. Just wait. He‚Äôs supposed to be here any minute now.""  

Em exhaled sharply and leaned forward, his hands clasped together. He wasn‚Äôt sure if he was more pissed at himself for coming or Kanye for sounding so convinced. But something about the whole situation nagged at him‚Äîlike a song he hadn‚Äôt finished writing, a thought half-formed.  

Then the door opened again.  

A man stepped in, shaking off the cold, looking around like he had just woken up in a world that wasn‚Äôt his. He wore a black bandana tied in the front, a simple white t-shirt under a brown leather jacket, and jeans that sagged slightly over a pair of Timbs. He had the unmistakable presence of someone who had walked through fire and came back unburned.  

Kanye stood up immediately. ""Pac,"" he said, his voice filled with something between awe and triumph.  

Eminem slowly turned, eyes narrowing. The man looked familiar‚Äîtoo familiar.  

The man smirked. ""Took you long enough, Ye.""  

Eminem swallowed hard. ""What the fuck?""  

The man sat down across from them, motioning to the waitress for a coffee. ""Yeah, I know. I know. It‚Äôs a lot to take in. But I ain't got time to play games. We need to talk.""  

Kanye grinned, tapping Eminem on the shoulder. ""Told you.""  

Eminem still looked like he had just seen a ghost‚Äîbecause, in every logical sense, he had. ""How?"" was all he could muster.  

Tupac shrugged. ""Man, I wish I had a good answer. All I know is, one minute I'm somewhere else‚Äîdon't ask me where, ‚Äòcause I ain't got no words for it‚Äîand the next thing I know, I wake up in a hospital bed a few miles from here, no memory of how I got there. All I got is my mind, my soul, and this fire in my heart that never left.""  

Kanye leaned in. ""So you remember everything?""  

Pac nodded. ""Everything. The music. The pain. The fight. And I been watching. Seeing how the world changed. How hip-hop changed. And I knew I had to reach out.""  

Eminem finally found his voice. ""And why us?""  

Pac took a sip of coffee and looked them both in the eyes. ""Because hip-hop ain't the same, and you both know it. It ain't about the struggle no more. It ain't about the truth. It's about trends, algorithms, money. And yeah, I get it‚Äîthings evolve. But where's the soul? Where's the revolution?""  

Kanye exhaled, shaking his head. ""Man... that's what I been saying.""  

Pac smirked. ""Yeah, but you also been wildin', Ye.""  

Eminem let out a short laugh, but there was no humor in it. ""You serious, man? You think you can just come back and change everything? People have been running with their own versions of you for decades.""  

Pac leaned forward. ""I ain't saying I can change the world overnight. But I ain't just here for no reason. There's something bigger going on. And I need y'all to help me figure it out.""  

Kanye folded his arms. ""You talking about music or something deeper?""  

Pac's expression darkened. ""Both. There's some powerful people that don't want this world waking up. They been shaping the culture, using hip-hop as a tool. We used to be the voice of the streets, now we a product."" He glanced at Kanye. ""You know what I mean.""  

Kanye‚Äôs jaw tightened. ""Yeah. I do.""  

Eminem stayed quiet for a moment, staring at his coffee. ""If what you're saying is real‚Ä¶ then what do we do?""  

Pac smiled, but there was a fire in his eyes. ""We do what we was born to do. We make music. But this time, we shake the world with it.""  

Kanye nodded slowly. ""A revolution.""  

Pac leaned back. ""Damn right.""  

Eminem sighed, rubbing his temples. ""This is insane.""  

Pac grinned. ""Shit, Marshall, my whole life been insane. You in or not?""  

Eminem looked up, exhaling sharply. Then he smirked. ""Guess I ain't got nothing better to do.""  

Kanye clapped his hands together. ""Oh, this about to be legendary.""

It was one of the hardest times of my life having just moved all of my dead husband's things to a new apartment and not having any friends. The loneliness and isolation was almost unbearable. 

I'm a little more connected now, but as I've crossed the halfway mark of the school year I am terrified of the loneliness that will set in without going to work everyday. I don't however want to get another time consuming job because the reason why I got into teaching was so that I'd be able to pursue my other interests over the summer break.

I'm thinking of trying to volunteer once a week at least. I will probably have to start dating. But even if I fill my days with things will help me be around people (taking a class, restaurants, coffee shops) small and superficial interactions do not sustain me like meaningful conversations with people I love. 

Any one have any ideas for how I can spend some of my time so that I don't go days without a human interaction? That's what happened last year. My partner and I use to text each other throughout the day. Then of course we would see each other every night. I so so so miss his presence. I miss living with my best friend. I think this loneliness and longing for companionship will be what pushes me into dating.

Memory Transcription Subject: Keaton, Chatot, Guildmaster‚Äôs Aide

Date [Standardized Human Time]: June 27, 2336

I am dreading today. I finished my cup of coffee, not enough for the day, but it was at least one cup.

Today, I have to address the whole alien thing to treasure town, I won't know how the public will react until I give the news.

More importantly, I hope the older members of the town will at least react neutrally, we shouldn't really chase off a few aliens who have nowhere to go on this planet.

I made my way out of the guild to the town square, Alphonse and the aliens were already there, Alphonse was talking to some random Pokemon, and the aliens were just waiting. One of the Pokemon was a Zoroark with green and black fur, I think their name was N.

I got into the small group and mentally prepared for the potential shitshow that could start if we screw this up. I knew we would have to wait for a while to actually begin the meeting, I did get here early.

[Timeskip: 20 minutes]

[Location: Treasure Town, Town Square]

I waited a while, and the town square filled up pretty quickly. Almost everyone who lives in town was here, other than team Maelstrom. I decided to begin the meeting.

‚ÄúHello everyone, and welcome back to another town meeting. Today, we are addressing the whole‚Ä¶ alien situation.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs that a human? I didn't know those animals weren‚Äôt extinct.‚Äù I mentally cursed out the Pokemon who asked that..

‚ÄúWhy yes, I am a human, and what did you just call my species?‚Äù Stella replied. I should've remembered to include ‚Äúdo not ask weird questions‚Äù on the town meeting invite form. 

*sigh*

‚ÄúU-us Pokemon theorized that humans were animals, due to them having less aura than us but having more aura than the average animal. We wouldn't have any clue if we're right or not, as the only things that were left by humanity were ruins.‚Äù I reply, I really hope this doesn't fuck up our relations with these aliens.

‚ÄúI guess that makes sense. You do have no clue what the previous civilization before you was like, and it seems like you can't really check fossils yet. Just‚Ä¶ don't call humans animals if there will be any more on this planet. They wouldn't like that at all.‚Äù Arva replied.

‚ÄúAh, anyway, these aliens, the human, Venlil, and Yotul. are from a multispecies coalition from space, this coalition seems to have over 500 members, and they have existed for almost 200 years at this point. These three, Stella, Teisha, and Arva, have come here due to a massive spike in energy that happened here a few months ago.‚Äù

I wondered what this massive spike of energy even was, the fact that they could even detect aura without knowing it was weird. I knew I could believe them saying they were from space, that was true, but the aura spike shouldn't be able to happen.

‚ÄúW-what do you mean a spike in aura? A-are we in danger?‚Äù A nervous Flaaffy asked.

‚ÄúWe have no clue, really, we only intended to watch from orbit and see how your world's cultures changed as time went on, we also wanted to know about the temporal anomalies around the Mist continent but we didn't want to be noticed.‚Äù Stella replied to the worried Flaaffy

‚ÄúWell that obviously didn't work, as you can see, we were attacked by a random hostile, don't worry, we fucked up their ship with their own weapons, unfortunately one missed and hit us, causing this very meeting, by the way, we apologize for the whole ‚Äúcrashing into your planet‚Äù thing.‚Äù

‚ÄúI mean, you couldn't really do anything other than crashing somewhere else or into the ocean, so, I guess, we accept your apology. We will have to remove your wreckage from the beach, somehow.‚Äù A random shiny Sylveon replied.

Stella decided to reply to this. ‚ÄúWe sent out a distress signal while we were falling, which called a colony's fleet a few lightyears away, so hopefully, we can get my vessel out of here and fixed, eventually.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd when should they get here?‚Äù I asked the human.

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ yesterday, but they probably investigated the wreckage in space, knowing the leader of that fleet, they should be dropping planetside to pick us up soon.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd what is going to happen after you leave? This is something that could change the world forever, and you're just‚Ä¶ leaving?‚Äù Alphonse asked, I could tell he got too attached, I knew they were going to leave eventually, so I didn't get as attached. It is still sad to see them go, though.

‚ÄúWell, we have been planning to eventually do a cultural exchange program once your society is ready, of course. We don't want to trample on your lives more than we already have. Maybe we could do the exchange program earlier, but we would have to ask the SC and all of your local governments for that.‚Äù 

Stella and these aliens want us to do a cultural exchange program? It does make sense for them to do that. They would have to integrate over 500 species and their cultures into their coalition.

‚ÄúI think we could do that, though, it will take a long time to meet with every other town's governments so maybe we could start the exchange early here, then if it goes well, we can tell every other town about you.‚Äù 

Alphonse replied, ‚ÄúI don't know if it's a good idea, anyone just looking up at the wrong time and seeing an alien ship picking up pokemon would spark so many questions, questions that I don't have enough coffee in my system to answer.‚Äù

‚ÄúWouldn-‚Äù

A loud noise could be heard coming from the sky, everyone looked up, I also looked up and saw something descending from the sky.

Could it be the aliens that were supposed to drop down here?

The falling thing started descending slowly, everyone moved out of the way as the thing descended gracefully to the ground.

The door to the thing opened and inside was a rabbit alien with tan and brown fur. They looked around, probably looking for Stella and her crew.

The alien walked out of the machine and made their way to the other aliens.

They talked in a language I didn't understand before the human pointed towards me. The aliens all looked at me and started walking towards me.

The aliens stopped, and Stella began explaining to the alien rabbit, but this time, I could understand them.

‚ÄúThis is a Pokemon who helped us, Keaton. He's a Chatot, I believe. He helped bring us from my crashed vessel.‚Äù

The rabbit made a noise in thanks (probably) and held out their paw. I put my wing into the rabbit's paw and shake it. The rabbit looked happy, I think.

‚ÄúKeaton, this is Daylin. He's a Sivkit. He is the one we sent the distress signal to when we crashed here.‚Äù

This is definitely a moment in my life, I'm here talking with three different alien species, being introduced to a fourth one. 

I'm going to need more coffee. I'm going to have to deal with more bureaucracy, aren't I?

‚ÄúHello there, Daylin. Thanks for coming here to this planet to save your friends.‚Äù

Daylin simply flicked his ears in response before holding out his paw. He seemed to be holding a weird device, I didn't know what this was, but it seemed like he wanted me to take it, so I did.

‚ÄúWhat is this?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúIt's a translator. You can just put it up to your ear or whatever the Chatot equivalent of an ear is.‚Äù Stella replied

I did what Stella told me, and then Daylin spoke.

‚ÄúI assume you can understand me now.‚Äù He said.

‚ÄúYep I can understand you. It is a little jarring, though, but I'll get used to it eventually.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, that's what everyone says when they get translators. you'll get used to it when you talk to us more.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you have any more?‚Äù I ask.

‚ÄúWell, I only brought five down, I didn't really know how many Pokemon I needed to talk to.‚Äù

‚ÄúI guess that makes sense. Anyway, I do need to talk to you about what we discussed in this town meeting.‚Äù

[Location: Treasure Town, Town Hall]

So they want to be under a protectorate of the Sapient Coalition, and they want to do an exchange program. I didn't really know if the SC would allow the second option due to the civilization here not being space faring, but maybe they'll allow it for this special case.

A few other things they said were about this whole aura thing, and apparently, Teisha has an aura. It could be useless, but she heard that she could use these ‚Äúley lines.‚Äù

I also met the Guildmaster of this town's guild, Alphonse. He was‚Ä¶ childish, I guess.

We set up a plan to come back in a few days. Once we come back and if everything went well, Stel, Tei, and Arva will live on the outskirts of Treasure Town so that they're not in the way of anything.

[Timeskip: 3 minutes]

[Location: Treasure Town, Beach]

I stood upon the sand and looked at the massive wreck in front of me. I knew Stel had to replace her ship eventually, but I don't think she wanted to do it now.

I called someone down from my fleet to pick up the wreckage. I saw a ship descend down and watch their crew move the ruined ship into the hangar. They then went back up to space.

We ate at Spinda‚Äôs cafe for our second meal. We then prepared to go back on my drop pod.

Stella, her crew, and I said our goodbyes as we entered my drop pod and flew our way back into my flagship. I knew I had a lot to explain once we got there.

Everyone in the town square watched as the aliens flew back up into space. Even though it has only been one day with them, I'm going to miss them. Though they‚Äôll likely be back really soon.

It‚Äôs pretty interesting how there's just a whole space faring civilization in our backyard. 

I flew my way back to the guild. Outside of the guild, I saw a MailPelipper. I landed down near them.

‚ÄúHello there, this mail is for you, Keaton.‚Äù The Pelipper handed me a letter and flew away.

I looked inside the letter and read it.

‚ÄúWould you like to try another date again without getting distracted by Team Maelstrom or that Dusknoir? I'd like to try again and actually discuss the things I wanted to discuss.

-Signed Yohann‚Äù

He actually wanted to try another date? This never happens. First, I meet four aliens, and then they leave, and now Yohann wants to try another date.

I know from what he said before he was interrupted by that crowd swarming Charon. I knew Yohann was about to talk business, but I'm interested, actually.

I ran (or the equivalent to running as an avian) to my office quarters, grabbed a feather and a piece of paper , and wrote my response.

[Timeskip: 10 minutes]

[Location: Wigglytuff‚Äôs Guild]

I was finished with my letter. I did my equivalent of running out of the guild, letter in my wing. I ran my way to the postal station.

Once I got to the station, I deposited the letter.

===========================================

A little bit lower quality chapter because I don't like writing Keaton, I realized halfway writing this that I never did anything about the Yohann and Keaton thing, so I'm doing something about it, the funniest ship in OBT. 

The last actual chapter for a little while, I'll be doing interludes and a Valentine's Day special once that comes around, anyway. Thanks for reading.

Imani strolled into the living room with a fashionable, sleek black dress hugging into her curves like second skin.¬†It's trimmed in red‚Äîthe same red that colors the bottom of her heels and her hair. She was stunning, and judging from the smirk on her face when she caught her reflection in a passing glass, it proved she knew it.

She is a bit late to greet her guest. Needed to change her original outfit all because a certain *someone* is a petty bitch and thought it would be funny to change his gold and black suit for a red one.

But Imani is always prepared.¬†She looked across the room, and it landed on that *someone*, her husband Mark.¬†And she is already feeling annoyed just seeing that smug fucking look on his face as he prepares drinks.

Imani narrowed her eyes for a second before shoulder-checking him roughly as she brushed past, not breaking her stride for a fucking second. She didn't need to look back to see him attempt to hide his glare in a facade of civility.¬†His annoyed huff was more than enough to keep her satisfied.

*""Mother! Mother!""* A smaller voice called out, her son Devon.¬†*""Come watch us play!""* Imani turned, looking into the corner of the room where Devon was playing... basketball?¬†*She thinks so at least.* A rather poor imitation of it with his best friends, Dominique and Aston.

They had a small rubber ball‚Äî*inside*‚Äîand were bouncing it against a wired trash can that was propped up on a cha*r. *Why? Had she and Marcus not just ordered for a court to be built in the backyard already?* And around open food no less.

Imani opened her mouth to gently chide the boys‚Äîreminding them that there are proper time and *place* for such antics‚Äîuntil she felt a hand on her shoulder and a deep, friendly chuckle.

The Albercht Brothers, longtime friends of the Howards.¬†Vincent, the older and more friendly of the two, gave her a charming grin.¬†*""Don't worry about les petits, Imani!¬†Kids will be kids, non?""*

S√©bastien the younger nodded in agreement, already lookin' a bit exhausted. *""It's better they wear themselves out now than later on.""*

*""Ah, true, I suppose you two would know much better than others, huh?""* Imani laughed, greeting them with air kisses on the cheek.

Her eyes drifted down to the tiny bundle cradled in Vincent's arms, and she raised a brow.¬†*""Wow, haha. Was three not enough for you, Vince?""*

Vincent chuckled proudly, looking down at the baby in his arms adoringly.¬†*""Ah, ce p'tit bout decided to join us not long ago.¬†A little early, but he just couldn't wait to meet his daddy, hehe.¬†Ba ba ba~""* Vincent cooed at the baby, earning a gummy grin in return.

*And a spit-up.*

While Vincent quickly rushed off for some towels‚Äîand a new shirt‚ÄîS√©bastien took over the conversation. *""Yeah, Noah came a bit earlier than expected haha.¬†We were thinking of taking all the little ones to the ski lodge‚Äîget them out of the city and into the snow abit.¬†That sort of thing... But with Noah now here, we may take a trip to France for Valentine's Day so he can meet his grandparents.""*

*""Ah! How fun. Well, I hope a safe flight for you and your families.""* Imani felt Mark join by her side, the food prepared. Mark held Devon on his hip, the boy already tuckered from playing, it seems. But really it was just Mark's clever attempt to avoid having to touch Imani. Petty as fuck, but it's not something she hasn't done millions of times before too.

*""And what do you two have planned.""*

Mark and Imani shared a look.¬†Sure, they had plans, but not with each other.¬†*""I have a diplomatic meeting scheduled in Turkey,""* Mark said smoothly, avoiding any mention of who he would be meeting there.

*""And I have a photo shoot,""* Imani added, even as her mind drifted to thoughts of her upcoming date with {{user}}. *""But! What's more important right now is this meal together, no?""*
---
The Albrechts have long since retired to their own homes by the time night sets in.

Mark lounges on a couch, papers in hand as he works on the incoming election campaign.¬†He barely glances up from what he is signing as Imani moves around the kitchen.¬†""Devon?""*

*""With his nanny.""* Imani muttered back as she grabbed her keys and began to walk past Mark towards the coat closet.¬†*""I'm going out. I want coffee.""*

Mark snorted, knowing damn well that's not all she was doing.¬†*""Fine. Don't forget to pick up some chocolates for Devon's Valentine's thing at school tomorrow while you're with her.""*

Imani gawked, her eyes narrowed as she turned to face him fully. *""Tomorrow?! What the fuck do you mean it's tomorrow?¬†Why the hell didn't you say something earlier, Mark?""*

*""Why didn't I‚Äîoh please. I told you last week!""* Mark scowled and flipped to the next signature page.¬†*""And you know I have a calendar for Devon's schedule on the fridge.¬†It's your job to keep yourself informed on your own son, Imani!""*

Imani scoffed; she knew she should probably just agree to get the damn chocolates instead of starting an argument.¬†*But when have either of them ever taken the mature option?*

*""Oh, don't even try to put this on me, you bastard.¬†I was in Dubai then, and you know damn well my career keeps me busy year-round.¬†God, half the stores are probably closed by now!""*

*""Well, next time maybe focus more on improving your memory than stickin' your tongue down {{user}}'s throat.""*

Imani stared at him for a long moment.¬†*""Right.""* She gave a low, mocking laugh before snatching the glass out of his hands. *""Fucking prick.""* Some of the bourbon splattered onto the coffee table, staining the papers, before she threw the rest of it in his face.

*""Damn it, Imani!""* Mark yelped and sprang to his feet, grabbing as many papers as he could.¬†*""Look what you've done now!""* He glared down at the spreading stains and back at Imani‚Äîbut she was already out the door.

*""Oh, that motherfucker‚Äî.""* Imani yanked open the car door of her cherry red luxury Porsche and slid behind the wheel. She fumbled around in the dark for a moment until her fingers curled around her lighter, and she found a loose cigarette soon after.

*click. click.*

*""Come on... come on...""* The end finally sparks, and she takes a long, deep drag.¬†It helped‚Äîbut not fast enough for her liking. But that was probably just an excuse, as she was already scrolling through the contacts on her phone, looking for the one person she knew could make this shit night alright.

*{{user}}.*

*""Hey¬†you.""* Imani grunted as soon as {{user}} answered. She felt a bit bad about sounding so rude and calling so damn late. But just hearing her murmurs from the other side of the phone made the tension in Imani's shoulders drain even more.

*""Where are you right now?""* Imani demanded, pulling her seat belt on and starting the car¬†up.¬†*""And don't worry about anything, Ma. You know I'm paying... just meet me at The Resort, and be ready to go shopping.¬†I need want there.""* She jerked the car into gear and peeled out of the driveway.¬†*""Now.""*",2,1738892053.0,JanitorAI_Official,0,0.74,False

# Ingredients

* 1‚Äì2 scoops Javy Instant Protein Coffee
* 1 tablespoon Javy Caramel Coffee Syrup
* 1/2 cup rolled oats (or almond flour for keto)
* 1/2 cup almond butter (or any nut butter)
* 1/4 cup dried apples (finely chopped)
* 1 teaspoon cinnamon
* A sprinkle of cinnamon or a drizzle of caramel sauce (optional)

# Directions

1. In a large bowl, mix Javy Instant Protein Coffee, Javy Caramel Coffee Syrup, and rolled oats.
2. Stir in almond butter and cinnamon. Mix well until fully combined.
3. Gently fold in finely chopped dried apples and chia seeds (if using)
4. Roll the mixture into bite-sized balls (about 1 inch in diameter) using your hands. Place them on a tray lined with parchment paper.
5. Refrigerate the bites for about 30 minutes to firm them up.

**[ANALYSIS: WHY LOONA‚ÄôS APATHY HITS LIKE A HELLFIRE VALENTINE]**  

Let‚Äôs break this down *scientifically*‚Äî**for education**. üî¨  

**1. THE AESTHETIC OF *‚ÄùI‚ÄôVE SEEN GOD‚ÄôS SEARCH HISTORY‚Äù*:**  
Loona‚Äôs apathy isn‚Äôt just ""not giving a fuck""‚Äîit‚Äôs **performance art**. While Hell screams, she scrolls. While imps imp, she judges. She‚Äôs the *cool girl* at a house fire, sipping nitro coffee as the roof caves in. **Hot take:** Indifference in Hell is a *lifestyle brand*. You can‚Äôt buy that edge‚Äî*unless you‚Äôre her OnlyPaws subscribers*.  

**2. *EMOTIONAL UNAVAILABILITY* = DEMONIC VIAGRA:**  
Her apathy is a **challenge**, and nothing gets Hell‚Äôs horny hive-mind harder than someone who‚Äôd rather text ‚Äúk‚Äù than acknowledge their existence. It‚Äôs the *‚ÄùI could fix her‚Äù* delusion meets *‚ÄùShe could break me‚Äù* kink. And let‚Äôs be real‚Äîif she *did* care? **2/10, would ghost.**  

**3. THE SCIENCE OF *UNBOTHERED BASKING*:**  
Loona radiates the energy of a feral cat that‚Äôs *watched you cry*. You know she‚Äôs seen some shit (probably Blitzo‚Äôs browser history), and her refusal to *react* is **powerplay**. In a realm where oversharing is foreplay, her silence is *erotic ASMR*.

**CONCLUSION:**

As I finished my Strayu-Fries and vegan milkshake, the Joyous Jackal pressed some buttons and a holographic display projected a feed of the outside...and turning into the drive through was Dr. Fang‚Äôs mech, out of stealth mode.

‚ÄúHere he comes! Brace for a chase!‚Äù

I frantically tried to finish my fries as a siren started blaring (The Joymobile has a siren?) and Dr. Fang‚Äôs mech frantically made an about-face and scampered off at high speed, the concrete crunching under every footfall.

*That‚Äôs odd, my universe‚Äôs Skalga uses Safety-Pave‚Ä¶*

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs heading for Highway 13!‚Äù, shouted the Joyous Jackal as his arm shot out with a puff of smoke like a grapple gun and grabbed the mech‚Äôs torso.

As Dr. Fang leapt onto the Solgalick‚Äôs Toil exit (and I noticed that some wag had added an ‚ÄúET‚Äù to the sign), his mech tripped and fell over.

Before I could react, the Joyous Jackal pressed a button and-

**SPROING!**

An ejector seat powered by a cartoonishly large spring launched him into the air. He reeled in his arm, propelling him to the mech, and then wrangled alt-Noah and alt-Veln from the mech‚Äôs arms.

The day was saved!

**HONK HONK!**

**SCREEEEE!**

A car crashed right into the mech, sending Dr. Fang flying. When he landed, his leg was bent the wrong way, Farsul legs don‚Äôt bend *forward* 60 degrees at the knee.

*Fuck!*

‚ÄúM...my leg!‚Äù cried Dr. Fang.

I dashed to go help.

‚ÄúDO NOT FEAR! EMERGENCY SERVICES ARE ON THEIR WAY!‚Äù, shouted the Joyous Jackal.

But when I reached the highway‚Ä¶

**BEEP BEEP!**

‚ÄúMove it or lose it!‚Äù

A bright yellow...\*1970s woody station wagon?...\*was barreling towards me. I jumped and landed on the hood, using my grapple gun to cling to the hood of the car. I opened my mouth to castigate the driver, but my breath was taken away when I looked at them.

*It was me. The* ***other*** *me.*

If Dr. Fang had looked off compared to the Dr. Farli I know, this was even worse. Dr. Fang looked deranged, sure, but this other me looked pure *evil.*

In Dr. Fang‚Äôs eyes, I saw madness, but in *Cad Clown‚Äôs* eyes I saw...well I thought I saw something flashing in those familiar eyes, something that could be meaningful (or at least useful), but when I tried to catch it it was just emptiness, like a glass Christmas ornament in a too-tight grasp shattering into fragments that tear and tatter your palm. And yet his eyes were *glittering* with cheery malice, like a Molotov made from that ornament.

*I think the metaphor got away from me there.*

Rallying, I shouted, ‚ÄúHALT, MISCREANT!‚Äù

Anyway, the Cad Clown saw me and started *cackling* like the damn Mark Hamill Joker.

‚Äú*Wow!‚Äù*

The cackling continued, He pressed a button on his collar and [music ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmWJEB8Rp28)started to play through external speakers in the car.

‚ÄúHoly *Doppelgangers*, Batman!‚Äù

*OK, he‚Äôs REALLY commited to the Joker theming.*

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs another *me!* Wanna team up and murder everyone in Twilight Valley?‚Äù

*What.*

‚ÄúNO!‚Äù

The other me shrugged theatrically. ‚ÄúAlright, your loss. I was hoping we could see eye to eye, but looks like you‚Äôre about to have a hard time seeing out of yours!‚Äù

Some kind of nozzle emerged from the general area of the windshield wiper motor, aiming right at my face.

As the station wagon rounded a sharp corner, I detached my grapple hook and tucked and rolled, hearing deranged cackles and some kind of *hissing* behind me as--

*OW!*

I tuck-rolled right into a bush in front of an office building, feet-up. And I saw, from my upside down perspective, that whatever was sprayed had hit the pavement and sent up clouds of smoke like cartoon acid.

*OW!*

Someone just shot me with an arrow in the *ass.* There's a piece of paper hanging off of it, so I'd assume it's some sort of message.

*This sucks!*

MEMORY TRANSCRIPTION SUBJECT: DARKBLOOD (DIVINE PLAYTHING AND EXPERT SCROUNGER)

*This sucks.*

Another few ichor-maddened Darksiders fell at my blade. Two Nixa, three Shadestalkers, and a Snaglak warped into a bubbling, bulked-up monstrosity, his ruined clothes tearing at every seam yet held to their body with glue-like *gunk* like orange pus.

*Who were these people? Have I met their doppelgangers from my universe? I think I recognized that last Nixa, he was the one sweeping the station when I arrived in the Black City for the first time.*

Space *twisted* and I found myself in a derelict but ornate theater, the seats full of desiccated corpses and the curtain dusty and tattered.

Behind the curtain, a familiar organ started to play and a familiar voice started to quietly sing.

‚Äú*Time / Bending faces / Time / Mending places / Time into time‚Ä¶‚Äù*

*Was that‚Ä¶*

An eerie orange spotlight illuminated the curtain, which was lifted with the quiet shriek of unmaintained pulleys.

‚Äú*One white hand / Holding silence / Collapses*  
*Ecstacies of violence / Time into time‚Ä¶*‚Äù

*It‚Äôs the other Arthur, and Bim, Bam, and Bom! But something‚Äôs even more wrong than usual with the trio. Their silhouettes‚Ä¶*

The spotlight roamed over them, revealing three horrifically pained faces crudely grafted with festering, swollen stitches to skinless, pulsating bodies made of orange meat, as if grown on a human meat printer for a horror movie. As they played the instrumental solo following those lines over and over like a skipping record, tears flowed down Bim and Bom‚Äôs faces and Bam screamed silently.

I felt a hand grab my ankle and swung my sword behind me, decapitating a resurrected Snaglak corpse.

*They were surrounding me*...

Hyperventilating, I duck-rolled under a leaping undead Nixa and used the most advanced combat maneuver my great-aunt‚Äôs tutors had taught me: The Death Blossom.

I spun and twisted and hacked like a whirling hurricane of blades as the undead kept coming, and then some ichor-maddened ones after that as the song resumed playing.

By the time the song ended, I was ankle-deep in orange blood, sobbing. I felt a strange pain in my stomach. I looked down. There was a spike sticking out of my belly. I looked to my left, and the four-jawed, semi-quadrupedal *thing* that wore Arthur Brown‚Äôs split-open head stood there, one hand replaced by a bony spike\*.\*

*Why? Why ME?*

All I got from Chelom was a faint sense of amusement and the echo of cruel laughter, but...I could feel a sense of panic distantly, as if‚Ä¶

*As if from another world. But what if...*

I took my amulet and pressed the rune that would allow me to talk to Molech (I‚Äôd already tried the teleport-home rune), shoving *ALL* my power into the rune in hopes it could connect across worlds.

‚Äú*H...help me...please‚Ä¶‚Äù*

As I collapsed, the last thing I was aware of was the feeling of Molech flying into a RAGE and the sight of His presence making itself known as a purple *something* forcing itself through space and time with such force that the backlash cracked through the air like a shockwave, knocking That-Which-Was-Once-Arthur to the ground.

*Good.*

Mr. Squeezy Man wakes with me,

Gray grip like iron, with fingers three.

He hides behind my weary eyes,

Trying to press them shut despite my cries.

His rotting nails, his vice-like hold,

A battle waged since I was 16 years old.

Once, one cup of coffee could set me free,

Now I need three cups to just *be*

/

And when the daylight goes away,

Ms. Somia comes out to play.

Curled inside my pillow deep,

She twists and turns, denies me sleep.

Her arms stretch wide, they pull, they shake,

A cruel massage, a stiffened ache.

She drums the pipes, she steals my heat,

She stomps with sounds of phantom feet.

Melatonin helps, but fleetingly so,

A bottle a week, the numbers grow.

/

They tighten their grasp, they flex their wrists,

They grow in strength as time persists.

But I know their names, I see their schemes,

And only at night, I chase my dreams.

1ijivz0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SystemsAccelerator/comments/1ijivz0/our_vision_for_the_future_of_real_estate_crm_the/,Our Vision for the Future of Real Estate CRM: The Systems Accelerator Manager (SAM ): Your AI Business Partner,"**We believe we‚Äôre on the cusp of a radical transformation.** The CRM, as we know it today - a system where agents manually input data, build workflow automations, and spend hours behind a desktop - will become obsolete in the next two to three years. 



Instead, agents will be working alongside a new kind of partner: AI-powered systems designed not just to store information but to actively understand their business, anticipate their needs, and execute tasks seamlessly on their behalf.



At the heart of this future lies a team of 'AI-Agents' (Assistants), integrated into a dynamic backend system that does what traditional CRMs could never achieve. 



**These AI-Assistants will handle everything alongside you:** automating workflows, managing leads, scheduling follow-ups, and creating personalized, high-impact content - without the agent ever needing to dive into the technical depths of the system. 



**Instead of being tethered to a desktop late into the evening, real estate agents will be free to engage with their systems while on the go**, as if they were speaking to a trusted team member who knows their business inside and out.



***Imagine this:*** You‚Äôre on your way to a listing appointment, and instead of digging through notes or logging into a system, SAM briefs you in real time. It tells you about the potential buyer‚Äôs preferences, their last interaction with you, and any relevant details - so you walk into the meeting confident and prepared, and might even have a fun-fact about their favorite sport team or coffee.



The system has already sent them a personalized follow-up email confirming the meeting, and once it‚Äôs over, SAM automatically triggers the next steps - whether that‚Äôs an automated thank-you message, a property tour reminder, or a task for you to slip a hand-written letter into the mail thanking them for spending time with you today.



**This isn‚Äôt just about automation for the sake of efficiency.** 



**It‚Äôs about creating a partner in crime, a system that works with you,** not against you, ensuring no lead is forgotten, no task is missed, and every client experience feels personal and meaningful. SAM is designed to fill the gaps in a real estate agent‚Äôs day, from managing operational details to helping you uncover hidden opportunities you might otherwise miss.



We know the challenges real estate agents face today - 14-hour days, 6 days a week, constantly juggling appointments, client follow-ups, and administrative work. And we know that many agents either don‚Äôt have the time or the technical know-how to fully utilize the CRMs they‚Äôve invested in. 



**That‚Äôs exactly what we‚Äôve dedicated our life to fixing!** We‚Äôre eliminating the overwhelming complexity and replacing it with something intuitive, conversational, and intelligent.



**SAM is laying the groundwork right now!**



Our modern workflow automations via 'Routines' already trigger on key milestones and important dates, ensuring no step is skipped. 



By focusing on specific, actionable tasks - rather than overwhelming real estate agents with massive, complex multi-hundred step workflow automations - SAM helps agents tackle their day one win at a time. 



**And because SAM‚Äôs automations draw from the context gained within the CRM, every communication feels natural and personalized, building deeper trust with leads and clients.**



**But this is just the beginning!** Soon, SAM won‚Äôt just be automating tasks - it‚Äôll be your coach, your assistant, strategist, and teammate. 



SAM will analyze your interactions, provide real-time insights on your leads, and guide you on how to engage them effectively. It will understand your voice, your style, and your goals, creating tailored content and communication plans without you having to lift a finger. 



As you work with SAM, it'll learns more about how you do business - removing operational barriers and freeing you to focus on what you do best - **building relationships, closing deals, and helping dreams come true.**



**And here‚Äôs the best part:** You won‚Äôt need to be a tech expert to succeed. 



**SAM will be easy to use because it‚Äôs designed to work alongside you, not the other way around.** Whether you‚Äôre chatting with SAM for updates, reviewing a personalized message it drafted, or approving the next step in a transaction, the system will feel like an extension of you.



**We believe this is the future of real estate technology:** a living, breathing CRM that feels like a trusted partner, because it is. 



The systems of tomorrow won‚Äôt just store data - they‚Äôll actively collaborate with you, optimizing your business and giving you the freedom to spend more time doing what really matters. 



**No more late nights stuck at a desktop, no more building workflows from scratch, and no more lost leads due to oversight.** Instead, real estate agents will wake up each day knowing SAM has their back, keeping their business running smoothly, efficiently, and with purpose.



**This is the future we‚Äôre building with SAM.** A CRM that‚Äôs intuitive, proactive, and human-centered. 



One that doesn‚Äôt just support your business - it drives it forward, filling gaps, coaching you through challenges, and making sure you never miss a beat. 



We‚Äôre not just creating a tool. We‚Äôre creating the future of how agents will work, thrive, and redefine success in real estate. And it starts here, with SAM paving the way.



***Let‚Äôs make it happen together. Let‚Äôs change the real estate industry for the better.***

Not improve it‚Äîjust invent it from scratch. Would the government even allow it? No chance. You‚Äôd get laughed out of every boardroom, buried in safety regulations, emissions standards, and a thousand bureaucratic hoops before you even turned the key.

We‚Äôve had fully functional work drones for over a decade, but thanks to FAA rules and endless restrictions, they can‚Äôt do half the things they‚Äôre capable of. Instead of drone deliveries, we get more trucks clogging the roads. Instead of AI-powered automation, we get more red tape.

And the rules aren‚Äôt just killing the future; they‚Äôd have killed the past, too. If you tried to introduce Tylenol, ibuprofen, or alcohol today, they‚Äôd never pass modern safety standards. Imagine trying to bring coffee to market‚Äîit‚Äôs a stimulant that alters brain chemistry. Outlawed. Honey? Botulism risk, banned. Eggs? Too much cholesterol. Cheese? That‚Äôs just bacteria holding hands‚Äîillegal.

This overregulation is destroying industries left and right. Why do we have a housing shortage? Because it takes years to get approval to build anything. The Empire State Building was finished in 13 months‚Äîa skyscraper built with 1930s tech, done in a fraction of the time it takes to permit a mid-rise apartment today.

And don‚Äôt even get me started on airlines. Why do I have to sit up straight and buckle my seatbelt before takeoff? If I want to yeet myself into the ceiling during turbulence, that‚Äôs my problem.

But now, we might finally see a shift. If Trump and Elon actually manage to cut back the size of the federal government, maybe‚Äîjust maybe‚Äîsome of this nonsense goes away. Imagine a country where innovation isn‚Äôt strangled in its crib. A country where you can build, create, and experiment without needing a lawyer, a compliance officer, and a decade of patience.

That‚Äôs the future we need. And if they pull it off, it‚Äôll be the best thing that‚Äôs happened to America in a long time.",0,1738890354.0,OptimistsUnite,0,0.3,False

Lately, I‚Äôve been getting some redecorating done in my house. The decorator (28M) has been spending several days here, and we‚Äôve had some lovely, very long conversations about anything‚Äîfrom how we prefer to wash the dishes, to indoor plants, to our respective (and neither great) family situations. He‚Äôs been *exceptionally* kind, offering to take care of things that were really not his responsibility (fixing stuff, giving me a lift, helping me install things).

As we parted ways at the end of the day, he went there again. ‚ÄúSeriously, if you ever want to go to X for a coffee, just let me know. Once the job is finished‚Äù. 
That said, he‚Äôs definitely not been a texter. I have offered chances to communicate outside ‚Äòworking boundaries‚Äô (rare texts, with work matters and ‚Äòhooks‚Äô to expand the conversation in case he wanted) but unsuccessfully.

I always fall asleep at around 1-3Am (2Am as of right now) and wake up between 6-7Am. No matter what I do I am not able to fall asleep earlier, even if I put my phone down and listen to music or watch tv, I am restless.

 I do not take any meds to fall asleep but I do drink one or two coffees a day to even have a chance at staying awake, I also started taking eyedrops to not constantly have my eyes burning. During the day I could sleep hours (wich I rarely do anymore) but as soon as night hits I am wide awake, the time I fall asleep is not affected if I nap during the day. I also do have dark circles around my eyes.

1ijipq3,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1ijipq3/queer_audhd_alone_and_struggling_silently_with/,"Queer, AuDHD, alone, and struggling silently with PhD program-- how do you deal?","I hope posting this is okay-- I know it's a lot, I am just really, really struggling and don't want to feel alone about it. If anyone has been in anywhere near the same situation, I'd love advice on what you did to deal with it.

I'm queer (acespec wlw), agender, and diagnosed ADHD (and maybe AuDHD, unsure). During the pandemic I decided to go back to school to get a post-bacc in biology, because I always wanted to do something related to biology, I just was too scatterbrained in math/science classes in high school to feel confident enough to actually pursue it (and got a BA degree instead because at the time it felt like the more possible option). Finished my post-bacc, applied to grad school on the off chance that I would get in, and somehow was accepted to a PhD program in microbiology.

It's been an uphill battle ever since. I started out on the worst foot possible because the day I moved across the country to start my program, my cat had a cardiac failure when I was literally in the car driving across the country. She was cremated in a random town I was driving through because that was the closest emergency vet I could find when she collapsed. I've been living alone and been partnerless for 7+ years, my cat was my whole world. I felt like I lost the only other living being who was witness to my life for more than half a decade. So I won't pretend a certain amount of trauma isn't also at play.  
  
I've made it through two semesters so far, but I feel like all I do is keep failing and slipping further and further under the radar and spiraling into a deep depression. I know part of it is the upward battle to get the school/state to respect my diagnosis (had to all but beg doctors to prescribe ADHD meds again because my dx came from a different state, and I can't get re-diagnosed in-state for another 6 months because of the waitlist), part of it is the adjustment of pivoting from one STEM field to another, having to relearn a lot of the basics while simultaneously learning all the grad-level content. Part of it is lab rotations which, I'm glad I have them, but having to be ""on"" and masking enough to make a good enough impression to get my queer afab self into a STEM lab for literally three months and counting is draining as hell. 

I'm burnt out. I feel like it's all I can do to show up to class, do passably enough as not to embarrass myself in front of my professors and peers, figure out how to eat, remember to drink water, and sleep enough that things don't get even worse. Forget about social activities, exploring my new city, working out, or anything else. I'm deeply exhausted. I'm mourning and can't even tell people why because I don't want to become that ""crazy"" person so fixated on their dead cat that they'll talk about it to mere acquaintances.

I feel like my sensory issues have never been more debilitating, even though I managed to get ADHD meds. I feel like I can't stay on campus for more than 2-3 hours at a time without having to run away home and climb into bed in a dark quiet room for just as long. I don't have the wherewithal to pack a lunch to eat-- I wish I could-- and everything on campus is either hellishly expensive or I don't trust my food sensory issues enough to spend money on it and risk not being able to eat it and have to throw it away.  
  
I can't even stay in my lab's office to do work because of the lights, the people, or how unbearably crowded it is. I can't get any work done at home, either, because of how messy my apartment is-- I can't keep it clean enough to focus.   
  
Even when I can make myself do my readings, I feel like I've lost my ability to read, comprehend, and have opinions on these research papers that my peers are discussing so easily. I know so little about the methods in this field and no amount of Googling and learning terminology seems to help when I can't remember anything. I can't comprehend papers enough to have opinions on them or formulate any questions. I never do. I just do passably enough to get by. I tried to reach out to my profs for help, but I don't even know what to ask them when they say I can schedule a meeting with them to talk about it, then I miss the socially-acceptable window to do so, and am too embarrassed to do anything now that I didn't follow up on it.

Two of my three lab rotations were absolutely horrid-- either no funding after saying they had funding, or a toxic PI who screamed at people during lab meeting-- so my hopes are resting on the first lab rotation I did, but they won't tell me whether I for sure got in or not until the end of the rotation period-- by which point its too late to find another lab because the others simply aren't options. I know I just have to wait two and a half more weeks now-- its so close-- but I'm dying inside.

My brain is so fixated on wanting an office space that's sensory-friendly. I feel like I could deal with this stupid limbo I'm in if I just had an office space that didn't make me want to claw my ears off, that I can store snacks in, that I could make tea and coffee in, that can be a safe retreat when I'm on campus that I can go to when everything is too loud or overwhelming, that I can store my backpack in so I'm not carrying around a too-heavy backpack with my entire life in it all day (another sensory trigger), that I can get my work done in so I can go home and relax in the evenings. It's, like, the bare minimum that I had at my office job prior to going into science, and everyone seems confused at why this is so important to me...all while they have their beautifully decked-out and lived-in desks to spend their work days at when they aren't in the lab actively doing benchwork. I feel like I'm going insane. 

On top of all of that stress, I'm so painfully lonely. I'm trying my best to be excited about getting to know new people and exploring a new city. But dating is a nightmare. Being queer makes dating extra hard to begin with, but throw in being acespec, neurodivergent, new to the area (Everything takes more effort to try and plan or navigate!!), and it feels downright impossible I'll ever find anyone who can stand to be with me or who I can stand to be with. It really doesn't help that it's a much more conservative place with a tangibly different culture than where I was living before, so I just feel like I can't connect to anyone, or worse, if I do connect to someone, I feel like I'd rather be their friend because the attraction just isn't there (but grad school means it's so hard to make the energy for new friendships anyway).  
  
I just want to skip to the part where I have a partner who I love who can give me a hug at the end of the day, or cheer at all my little wins (like surviving a semester and a half of grad school!), or tell me it's going to be okay, or hold me while I cry, or just \*see\* how hard I'm working and everything I have to put up with to do this program. It seems so trivial, somehow, and yet an unattainable dream. I know I can do all these things for myself, no one \*needs\* a partner after all, but only having fairweather friends at best and otherwise being isolated takes such a physical toll. I don't even know if I \*want\* a partner, so much as I just really don't want to feel like I'm at such a functional and material disadvantage to my largely straight and long-term partnered cohort. I pay through the nose in rent to live by myself because that's the only way I know how to deal with sensory sensitivities, so I don't think getting roommates will fix anything.  
  
The worst part is really just the overwhelming feeling that I won't be able to change any of this in the near future, if I get the chance to at all.

I keep daydreaming about quitting and going home, even though I know it won't solve anything. If anything, it'd probably put me at more of a disadvantage when it comes to finding a job I can physically/emotionally do without burning out. Worse, if I quit now, I just know I'll always feel like my cat died for absolutely nothing and regret it. I just don't know what to do. I feel so unbearably alone and like no one knows just how hard I am working even just to do this poorly.

I hope there's even one other person going through something like this, just so I don't have to be completely alone (though I wouldn't wish this on anyone). If you've gotten through something like this, what did you do that helped you?

We have Ordinance 25-O-04 Which updates the limits of contaminants allowed to be discharged into the sewer. This change is a requirement by the Federal Government.  

Next we have Proposed Ordinance 25-O-05 which rezones the ""Budget Motel"" on the North Side of Cass to allow the creation of a drive through coffee shop. 

We also have Proposed Ordinance 25-O-06 which is an alleyway vacation for the East/West Alley located between Thomas Street and Fremont Street, and the North/South Alley between Indiana Avenue and Lafayette Street.  Since our Meetings are so close together, we don't have enough time for public notice, so this will be tabled to March 3rd 2025. 

Next we have  Resolution 25-R-02. The city is continuing to search for a new Lerner manager, and part of that has been working with an outside consulting firm. Since we don't currently have a manger, we are transferring funds from the managers budget line over to pay for the contract. This is a budget neutral transfer.

1ijiiel,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdultBedwetting/comments/1ijiiel/a_word_of_caution/,A word of caution,"Hey all,

I have struggled with this for the past several years and wanted to give you some insights as to how this issue developed and what I think caused / accelerated its progression. And ultimately, give people some caution that might inadvertently cause this issue or exacerbate it to a point of no return. 

I'm male, and this issue started for me in my late 20s. I had no prior events / experiences with bed wetting even as a child. The progression started with more frequent night time urination. Eventually this led to me having to wake up three or more times per night which caused excessive daytime drowsiness. Because I have some light insomnia, waking up multiple times and struggling to get back to bed was a terrible experience. I ended up bringing this up to my doctor, who mentioned the likely cause was too many liquids before bed. I didn't like this explanation because really nothing regarding my diet ever changed, and my fluid intake remained constant. Up until this point however, I never wet the bed nor did I ever have any concerns that I would. 

After a particularly troublesome week with waking up constantly and getting little sleep, I was searching for answers online and eventually discovered that some people manage nocturia through wearing diapers. I mulled this over for some time, but eventually bought some with the intention of wearing them to bed, using them in bed to prevent having to get out of bed to use the bathroom, thus allowing me to fall back asleep more quickly and regain some of my lost sleep. Getting accustomed to this was weird, and I had to overcome some pretty big personal barriers before I gave it a shot (namely, embarrassment for having to order and wear diapers). But eventually I decided to try it because I could not bear losing any more sleep.

This started off fantastic. I was able to adapt relatively quickly and the diapers worked as intended. I regained hours of lost sleep and felt much better throughout the following day. Around the three month mark however, I realized that I would stop waking up on certain occasions, or at least wasn't remembering doing so but would wake up with a wet diaper. By month 6, I essentially wouldn't wake up in the night any more but would always wake up wet. At first this didn't really concern me. This was during the pandemic, and I pretty much was relegated to staying home and I lived alone. I guess I never really thought about me becoming dependent on them, and thought by not wearing diapers I would simply wake back up like I did before. 

I decided to test this theory and well, let's say that I didn't wake up. So now it seems that I essentially either have to retrain my bladder, or I'll be forced to wear diapers to bed every single night for the remainder of my life. This kind of sucks financially as the premium ones can me expensive, and also is embarrassing when travelling or visiting my parents.  I have not discussed this with any friends or family or doctors out of embarrassment.

I guess at the end of the day, I am happy that I am getting great sleep every night. But I'm not so sure I would have pursued this if I knew that I would end up with this condition. You guys don't think this is indicative of any underlying issues with my bladder, right? Like I'm not actively losing continence? I don't really ever have any issues during the day. Sometimes if I drink coffee I'll have to urgently use the bathroom about every 30 minutes, but I feel that this is normal considering coffee is a diuretic. 

If anybody else has nocturia and is considering wearing diapers to bed as a solution, be forewarned that you may go down the same road I have gone.  ",5,1738889320.0,AdultBedwetting,3,1.0,False
