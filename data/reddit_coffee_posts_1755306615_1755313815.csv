1mrj0m6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mrj0m6,Ex Wife Took the Art and the Drywall during Move Out,"My ex wife and I are newly separated (she ended it) and today was the big moving day for her with her friends there to help. As painful as the whole situation is, I decided I would rather help where I can to make this as “quick” a transition as possible but setting boundaries where needed. I only set one for today..”I don’t need to be there for move out, but I expect you to respect my living space” 

So last night, I spent most of the evening by myself, in the home we built together, neatly staging all of the things we discussed and agreed she’d be taking with her. I needed today’s move to break speed records. The beautiful, hand-made mosaic tiles that once filled this wall never came up in the conversation. 

Anyway, cut to working most of the day from a coffee shop and getting a call to say they wrapped up and even swept for me but no mention of the mayhem I was about to witness. 

I moseyed on back only to find that my drywall had been scalped and left for dead. The tiles had been ruthlessly ripped from the wall and the double-sided Gorilla tape proved its adhesive dominance. I waited to compose myself to reach out and when I did the response was a short text along the lines of “I don’t the she knew it was drywall”. Haven’t received a text since .

Expert Guide for 2025 Bahrain Company Formation with Insider Insights\
\
Alt text: Business people in a professional corporate meeting, reflecting Bahrain company formation activities..\
Forming companies in Bahrain, especially for foreign shareholders, has changed dramatically since then. Recent updates, like the 2025 regulatory reforms implemented via Sijilat’s new digital portal and the LMRA’s biometric verification requirement (effective March 2025), have transformed the landscape. As of this year, foreign direct investment in Bahrain jumped by 11% year-on-year (Reuters, Jan 2025), with over 2,400 new foreign-owned entities registered in the Diplomatic Area, Bahrain Bay, and trending zones like Amwaj Islands.\
\
Quick anecdote: In 2023 I lost a week because I used a scanned passport copy instead of a color-certified original. Don’t make the same mistake—I’ll show you how to avoid delays and save money across every step.\

Bahrain’s Strong Business Environment in 2025\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern Bahrain, with business districts and office towers., citing its 5.7% projected non-oil GDP growth and over $1.2 billion in FDI inflows. The Seef District and Bahrain Bay are buzzing—serviced offices are springing up everywhere, luring SMEs and multinationals alike.\
Importantly, the Bahrain Economic Development Board (EDB) now offers direct support for foreign investors, reducing approval times for most business structures to as little as five working days. (I once registered an SPV in under 72 hours by timing my application just after Ramadan—an insider tip I’ll explain soon.)\
Key business environment highlights:\
- Over 70% market share in regional cloud computing and payment processing (Gulf News, March 2025)\
- Introduction of the 2025 “Green Company Initiative” waiving certain fees for ESG-compliant startups\
- Enhanced free zone incentives: 0% corporate tax, 100% foreign ownership, fast-track visa processing\

Required Identity Documents for Foreign Shareholders\
Overview of Documentation Needs\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation: foreign shareholders preparing identity documents for Bahrain company formation. standards apply, so accuracy and document quality are non-negotiable.\
At minimum, every foreign shareholder needs:\
\
Original passport (color copy, certified)\
Recent proof of address (utility bill or bank statement—dated within last three months)\
Passport-sized photos (white background, digital JPEG preferred for Sijilat)\
Valid visa or entry stamp (for in-person signatories)\
Corporate documents (if the shareholder is a company; see details below)\
\
If you’re a resident of a country with apostille conventions, you’ll often also need apostille certification. Gulf residents can use GCC eIDs for digital authentication, but most non-residents will need wet-ink certification.\

\
If your company formation includes GCC nationals, Bahraini eKey integration can speed things up. But non-GCC shareholders must always provide original, certified paperwork.\
See a detailed breakdown of entity types and their documentation nuances at this structure guide.\
A Tangent on Coffee and Contracts\
Now, sidetrack for a moment: in Bahrain, most major deals are discussed over Arabic coffee in a majlis (especially in the Diplomatic Area). No matter how digital the process gets, don’t underestimate the power of a face-to-face introduction. I once had regulatory paperwork expedited after a Ramadan iftar—relationships matter just as much as document checklists. Even the MOICT’s head of licensing prefers in-person meetings for new ventures.\
\
2025 Regulatory Changes: What’s New?\
The most important policy change this year is the Sijilat Digital Document Verification System launched in April 2025. All foreign identity documents must be uploaded via the verified digital portal, with live facial authentication for major shareholders holding over 10%. The LMRA’s biometric verification kiosk (now mandatory for company directors) just opened its third main branch in Seef District—pro tip: early afternoons have the shortest queues.\
Key update effective March 2025: All corporate documents (Inc., UBO) must be apostilled (or legalized at Bahrain embassy if non-apostille country) and accompanied by a local certified Arabic translation.\
I learned the hard way: skipping the apostille meant our Singaporean client lost their CR approval slot, pushing us into the post-Eid rush (not fun at all).\
\
Step-by-Step: Preparing for Bahrain Company Formation\
1. Gather and Certify All ID Documents\
\
Collect original passports for all foreign shareholders\
Obtain certified color copies (notarized in home country + apostilled if outside GCC)\
Prepare digital copies (scan at 600dpi—Sijilat portal is picky about file quality)\
Acquire recent proof of address, certified as true copy\
Get digital passport photos in required spec\
\
2. Legalize Corporate Shareholder Documents\
\
Obtain apostilled (or embassy-legalized) Board Resolution, Certificate of Inc.\
Arrange certified translation into Arabic (Bahrain law mandates local language versions as of 2025)\
\
3. Pre-fill Sijilat Application and Pre-Book MOICT Appointment\
\
Use the Sijilat pre-screen tool (my tip: Thursday mornings are fastest, just before the weekend lull)\
Book your MOICT visit early (they open at 7:30am; aim to be first in line to avoid waiting behind government clients)\
Download all required forms in advance\
\
4. Submit Documents via Sijilat Portal\
\
Digital upload of certified documents\
Live facial authentication for key shareholders (over 10% ownership)\
Schedule in-person visit only if flagged for further verification\
\
5. LMRA and Visa Processing (if applicable)\
\
LMRA’s biometric registration is now digitized (bring original passport for in-person scan)\
Visa application can be submitted in parallel; expect 3–5 days turnaround\

\
Insider tip: Bulk-translate and apostille all documents at once to save on per-page minimum fees.\
\
Office Location Tips for Faster Processing\
\
MOICT Main Office (Diplomatic Area): Best for direct submissions and quick escalation—ask for Mr. Waleed at the reception if you hit a snag.\
Sijilat Express Counter (Seef Mall): Early mornings (8-10am) see almost no queues.\
LMRA Seef Branch: Avoid Sunday mornings; Wednesday early afternoons are quickest.\

Why Bahrain Beats the UAE and Saudi Arabia for Foreign Shareholders\
Bahrain’s true differentiator? Streamlined digital processes, lower formation costs (often 25-40% less than Dubai), and real 100% foreign ownership for a far wider range of business activities (see foreign ownership options).\
In contrast, the UAE’s notarization requirements are stricter and Saudi Arabia’s MISA portal, while improved, still involves far lengthier UBO and security checks.\
Plus, in Bahrain, relationship building remains a time-saver: there’s nothing quite like finishing your formation paperwork while sharing dates and qahwa with your new commercial neighbors.\

FAQ: Common Questions on Foreign Shareholder ID Documents\
Q1: Do all foreign shareholders need to be physically present in Bahrain to sign?\
A: Not always. Most signatures can be handled remotely IF you prepare notarized, apostilled documents and assign a local representative via Power of Attorney. For certain sensitive sectors (financial services, telecom), at least one director may be required in-person for biometric verification.\
Q2: What’s the fastest way to certify identity documents abroad?\
A: Use international notary/translation chains—ask your formation consultant for a list with next-day turnaround. Always arrange documents before your planned Bahrain application; embassy schedules vary by country and can add weeks if not planned.\
Q3: How can I avoid delays during Ramadan or public holidays?\
A: Submit applications just after morning prayers and avoid the last five working days before Eid. MOICT and Sijilat staff often work reduced hours; pre-booking is critical. For urgent matters, a personal visit (with coffee!) can help.\
Q4: Do Bahraini free zones require different ID documents?\
A: No, but free zone applicants enjoy streamlined review and can sometimes skip in-person verification for certain low-risk sectors. Review specific benefits at Bahrain free zone guide.\
Q5: What’s the best resource for ongoing compliance support?\
A: For document updates, KYC, and annual filings, KeyLink BH’s accounting and compliance service is my top pick—especially if you’re remote or managing multiple entities.\
\
\
Forming a company in Bahrain is all about preparation, relationships, and knowing the shortcuts. With certified identity documents in hand, the right local support, and a bit of Arabic hospitality, your foreign-owned business can be up and running in record time—whether you’re launching your fintech dream in Bahrain Bay or setting up logistics in Seef District.\

# Sometimes The Body Decides For You

[Jenna Woginrich](https://substack.com/@jwoginrich)Jul 07, 2025∙ Paid

I am not the kind of person who takes naps.

I wish I was. It sounds glorious. To give yourself permission to restore the body during daylight feels like advanced meditation. Unfortunately, I’m an anxious kinetic beast. It’s not a good way to be, and yesterday my body forced me to learn that the hard way.

It was a normal morning. I got up around 5:45 and made my bed, walked downstairs, and let Friday out to pee while filling food bowls. I made coffee while the cats circled my legs. I walked around the farm and opened the coop, carried hay bales to the mare and flock, and filled and refilled troughs and watering cans to prepare the animals and crops for the heat wave ahead.

I came back inside the farmhouse and stumbled on flat ground.

I was dizzy, which I never am. A cold sheen of sweat was covering my arms, and I was feeling tired in a way I had not felt since summer camp when I was ten years old.

I went to a program called Night Owls, where girls got to learn about nature after dark. There were night swims and ghost stories, lessons on nocturnal wildlife and fireflies. We made lanterns and sang around campfire. It was perfect.

One night we hiked 3 miles round trip to a ski resort to take in the view of a locally-famous geological feature in the moonlight.

I had never hiked 3 miles before in my life, especially not after a long day of camp. I can still remember the blessed relief of laying down on my sleeping bag around midnight that night. It was the one and only time I could remember falling asleep instantly, before or since. I was standing in my kitchen *that kind* of tired. It snuck up on me.

I grabbed a mason jar off the drying rack and went to fill it with water. When I turned on the faucet the water came out steady, like normal, and then jumped. The smallest hiccup, like a kid running across the lawn stepping on the garden hose.

My knee-jerk thought: the well is shot. I can’t afford a new well. I won’t have running water in this house for years. (That was one hell of a conclusion to jump to, but that’s how catastrophic thinking works.)

It didn’t matter that a friend just helped me install the new faucet, and the whole pressure system was different. It didn’t matter that when I went to check the well outside it was buzzing trying to pull water, as the the recent dry spell had the water table lower than normal.

Nothing logical mattered. Anxiety has nothing to do with logic, it’s a primal fear that pierces and you either need to learn to live with a metaphorical spear in your chest or talk yourself down.

I’ll be 43 in three days. I’m still working on it.

My heart started pounding. I went from lightheaded to woozy. Which, of course had to be low blood sugar because besides exhaustion, I felt fine. There were no aches from the flu, no sore throat or cough. I tested myself for Covid and it came up negative (still haven’t gotten it). So it had to be some rare kind of instant-onset code-red farm diabetes and I was going down like Julia Robberts in Steel Magnolias.

Now my body was exhausted AND my brain was a tornado.

I started to realize how weak I felt. If there’s one thing I always had, it was a sturdy constitution, and I can’t remember a time in my life I couldn’t throw a 80lb feed sack on my shoulder. A well problem I made up was one thing, feeling physically weak was terrifying.

In a more rational state, I could have listed all the reasons why I was exhausted. Besides the recent pour, I hadn’t drank any water for over 12 hours and had two giant cups of coffee for breakfast (a diuretic). It was 8AM and already 81 degrees. I had been moving my dehydrated bones for hours in full sun and only ate one meal the day before (I forget to eat in summer).

I was weary in a primal way, like I had just spent my third day in a row trying to outrun a saber-toothed tiger and if I didn’t stop moving at full alert, I would die.

I know how to deal with panic. Panic and I are old friends. But exhaustion was new. I never get sick. The last time I was in bed for a day was winter 2020, a 24hr stomach bug. I was back to right in a day.

I needed to eat something, drink something, and stop moving. It felt like I was fighting off fainting. I honestly think it was my anxiety about weakness that stopped me from hitting the floor. I was too wired to drop.

I grabbed my phone and a moonpie. I always have moonpies on hand because they are both a luckpiece and a favorite snack of a close friend’s daughter. Now I just wanted the cheap energy, as everything else in the house had to be cooked from scratch. I grabbed a tall glass of ice water. I sat on a comfortable chair, slowly ate the pie, drank water, and then played a guided breathing exercise on my self-care app.

For five minutes I did nothing but breathe. Friday came over and placed her head in my lap. She reminded me I’m not alone, and besides her there was a whole farm of animals depending on me. Get it together, woman.

I’d been running on fumes for days and I didn’t even notice. Summer on the farm is the most physical activity I get all year, and it *never ends*. That’s not a complaint—I love this life and my decision to keep going—but when I get into a chore flow I get tunnel vision and all I do is go go go. It should make me more eager to rest, but the opposite is true. I pile on more tasks, a game of chicken against my own better judgement. As if someone is keeping score and if I don’t constantly up my productivity I don’t deserve to remain here.

Part of it is toxic American hustle culture and part of it is the reality of running a homestead/freelance career alone. If I am not maintaining a diligent list things fall apart. The weeds overtake the landscaping and gardens. The livestocks’ water turns tepid and murky. The flowers droop from thirst. The house starts to look like it did when I was depressed, items scattered and placed wherever convenient instead of where they belong. I spent enough of my life in clutter and confusion. Now I fight it like its my fifth job. I can’t go back to being that sad, messy, girl. I can’t tolerate being around clutter. It’s a trap.

So I don’t rest. I don’t stop. There is always something to do. Go trim the overgrown tendrils of rosebush and goldenrod on the path, check the solar lanterns still hold a charge. Weed wack the tall grass around the sheep gate, and cut back the overgrown hedge. There’s coops and barn stalls to muck, eggs to collect, gardens to weed, and a house to clean.

I am every member of this household - the farmer, the wife, the housekeeper, the gardener, the accountant and scheduler. And yesterday, it was simply too much on too little energy and the body shut down. I whirred to a stop like a wind-up toy out of tension.

I didn’t need insulin or a plumber. I needed to take a fucking nap.

My body is aging and these ongoing unprecedented times are trying on decent literate folk. You can only go so hard for so long before the body demands rest, and she only asks nicely for so long...

So I had to force myself, on a beautiful heatwave of a July Sunday, to rest. Not just stay indoors, but be still. No wiping down counters or mopping floors. No pushups and sit ups on the yoga mat. No standing if I could help it. I needed to recharge or I was going to strain a system.

Saturday I took the window AC unit out of storage and set it up in my bedroom. I had not used it yet this year, but saw how intense the next two days were going to be. I turned it on, and closed the door so the room could cool down.

I took a cool shower, taking extra care to tend to all the tired bits of my body. I made a cold drinks and packed some snacks and went in that bedroom like I had an appointment. At 3PM I put some Joe Scott videos (if I am going to lay down I might as well educate myself) and drifted off [while learning about ball lightning](https://youtu.be/_gOlQCI9Tgg?si=h6S4vtACmP49CwAY).

I woke up an hour later, hungry and a little better. My heart was no longer racing. My body didn’t feel like walking upstairs was Everest. I just needed to give myself permission to rest.

It’s so hard for me to do because I never feel like I deserve it. I am living, writing, and working full-time on my own farm. It’s a dream few ever have and I spent years of it lost in a swirl of depression and alcohol. Now that I had my life back, I never wanted to slip into those old ways. I think the constant strive for improvement was starting to not just take its toll, but to shut down the whole interstate.

The rest of the day I took it easy. I made myself stay indoors. I drafted this, worked on pet portraits, and only went out to check water and evening feeding. Friday didn’t get a two mile walk, but we did take a slow amble down the path behind the farmhouse, and we both stood ankle-deep in the creek and watched the birds for a long while.

That time outside was as restorative as the nap. I went to bed early, making myself lay down for hours before I fell asleep. I watched Gilmore Girls and drank herbal tea and was going to force a solid 8 hours in bed, sleep or not.

I managed about 6.5 of sleep and that’s 2 hours more than normal this month. When I looked in the mirror there were no bags under my eyes and I looked nothing like Julia Robberts, to my relief.

This morning I could still feel the weakness, but not the wild panic. My body was tired but not *The Vapors* from yesterday. Believe it or not, the faucet worked fine. I made sure to walk outside and dig up two potatoes and snip off some kale stems and made hash browns and eggs with chopped kale; a hearty breakfast if there ever was one. I made enough to put half in the fridge for later, so I wouldn’t skip any meals. No one has to twist my arm to eat fried potatoes at any hour of the day.

I decided to start a new tradition on the farm. A mix of tea time and Siesta, a recharge of calories and rest any time the body wants between noon and 4PM. I put an alarm on my phone and will make myself slow down and either find a hammock or bed to at least *try* to nap and then nosh on something, anything, to keep the body strong into the evening.

If you don’t give the body a day off, I guess it decides for you. That’s what I am taking as a lesson from that unpleasant day. I’m not built for rest, which is why I idealize it so much. Hammocks and river swims have their place right beside hay chucking and bucket hauling. And if I want to stick around for a few more summers, I better learn to fall asleep beside Smilodon.

I’m in my early 20s, graduated college, have a real job (lowkey a chic one that’s related to my degree but doesn’t pay that well lol), and I’m married!

Because I’m married young and an immigrant and blah blah I had to work really hard and didn’t have any time to spend on myself through college. I also didn’t have contact with my immediate family for a long time too for reasons I can’t get into. 

But, I’m happy now and have more time since I don’t need to do homework after work or anything and don’t have 2 jobs after class and the other stuff I had to do in college, and I’m noticing that women around me-even the young ones-all take such good care of themselves. 

They have a brow lady, they get their eyelashes done, they have their hair bleached cut and styled every other month, they get their nails done, they have planned coffee dates, they get laser body hair removal, they get laser scar removal, they have a waxing lady, they have matching pajama sets lol, and so on…

It’s just a little crazy to me! I feel like because I’m married that should be my life too, but I grew up a tomboy and just feel like everyone around me acknowledged that it’s not a good thing for adult women to mess too with their physical appearance because it’s superficial and a waste of money, but now I almost feel left behind. 

Like I got to visit distant family and they’re a little traditional in some ways but it’s almost like they were surprised i hadn’t changed since I’m now married😵‍💫but why would I? 

TL;DR: I just want to know your ways of upkeeping your appearances and maintaining that adult woman physical standard I guess. How and when did you start having a lash, wax, eyebrow, etc lady? Is it a waste of money? Do you DIY anything?

Also do you feel left out if you don’t do these things lol? I didn’t realize how uncommon my stance was.

Raven’s POV  
  
  
The neon sign outside Jack’s buzzed like an angry hornet, flickering between OPEN and OPE before finally settling on PEN—which, honestly, was still accurate. The place wasn’t much to look at: a squat brick building with windows so dusty they might as well have been painted shut, wedged between Duston’s only hardware store and a defunct post office that still smelled like mothballs and regret.  
  
  
Inside, the air was thick with the scent of stale beer, fried onions, and the faint, lingering ghost of cigarette smoke from back when smoking indoors was still legal. The jukebox in the corner wheezed out a half-hearted country tune, something about lost love and pickup trucks, while the ceiling fan overhead spun lazily, like it couldn’t decide whether it wanted to circulate air or just give up and fall on someone’s head.  
  
  
Duston, Kansas. Population: who cares. The kind of town where the cows outnumbered the people, and the people outnumbered the brain cells after last call. I’d rolled in seven weeks ago with a duffel bag, a fake ID, and a story about being a drifter looking for honest work.  
  
  
Honest work.  
  
  
Good one, Raven.  
  
  
Here’s the thing about Duston—it was the perfect place to disappear. A nowhere town where people minded their business just enough to not ask why a 24-year-old girl with no last name (or at least, not one she’d admit to) showed up out of nowhere and started slinging drinks at a dive bar.  
  
  
I wiped down the bar with a rag that had seen better days—possibly during the Reagan administration—and tried not to think about how many germs were probably staging a mutiny on its surface.  
  
  
The door creaked open, and in walked Sheriff Grady, his boots scuffing against the worn wooden floor like he owned the place. Which, in a way, he kinda did. Duston was small enough that the law and the local drunkards were practically on a first-name basis.  
  
  
""Afternoon, Sheriff,"" I said, sliding a coaster his way. ""The usual?""  
  
  
Grady grunted, which in Duston-speak translated to ""Yes, please, and also I’m too tired for small talk."" I poured him a double of the cheap stuff—because if there was one thing I’d learned in eight years of running, it was how to read a man’s mood by the way he sighed.  
  
  
The scars on my face itched when the whiskey fumes got thick in the air. Not a real itch—more like a memory. A reminder. The kind that didn’t fade, no matter how many years passed or how many states I put between me and the bastard who put them there. I can still hear his voice, even now.  
  
  
""My daughter doesn’t cower,"" he’d snarled, backhanding me hard enough to split my lip. ""You’ll learn to fight, or you’ll learn to bleed.""  
  
  
I’d done both.  
  
  
Most folks in Duston were polite enough not to stare. Or, if they did, they at least had the decency to wait until my back was turned.  
  
  
But then there were the ones who didn’t.  
  
  
Like the two assholes currently camped out at table four, nursing their third round of Bud Lights and thinking—wrongly—that I couldn’t hear them over the jukebox.  
  
  
""Shame about the face,"" one muttered, his voice slurred with cheap beer and cheaper charm. ""Bet she’s got a hell of a body under that apron.""  
  
  
His buddy snorted. ""Just turn her around, problem solved.""  
  
  
The glass I was polishing cracked in my hand.  
  
  
Not enough to shatter—just a sharp, sudden snap of stress fractures spiderwebbing through the cheap tumbler. I set it down carefully, took a slow breath through my nose, and counted to five in my head.  
  
  
One. The scent of their sweat, sour with alcohol.  
  
  
Two. The thud of their heartbeats, lazy and unafraid.  
  
  
Three. The creak of the barstool as Joe, the owner of Jack’s, shifted, his knee cap protesting as he turned to give them a look.  
  
  
Four. The low, warning growl building in my chest—one I forced back down before it could escape.  
  
  
Five.  
  
  
I exhaled.  
  
  
Then I grabbed a fresh bottle of Jack and sauntered over to their table.  
  
  
""Gentlemen,"" I said, sweet as poisoned honey, setting the bottle down between them with a thunk. ""Looks like you’re running low. On manners.""  
  
  
The first guy—beefy, red-faced, with the kind of grin that made me want to rearrange his teeth—leered up at me. ""Aw, c’mon, darlin’. We’re just havin’ fun.""  
  
  
""Yeah,"" I said, leaning in just enough to let the dim light catch the scars. ""Funny thing about fun—it stops being fun when the other person ain’t laughing.""  
  
  
His buddy opened his mouth—probably to say something real fucking stupid—but Joe cut in before he could.  
  
  
""Boys,"" he drawled, tipping his glass their way. ""I’d quit if I were you. Raven here’s got a temper, and you’re lookin’ awful flammable.""  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
  
Raven’s POV  
  
  
The clock hit 2 AM, and the last of the drunks stumbled out into the Duston night, leaving behind the usual aftermath—sticky floors, half-empty glasses with cigarette butts floating in them, and the lingering scent of bad decisions. I was wiping down the counter when Joe lumbered out from the back, his massive frame casting a shadow that could eclipse a small moon.  
  
  
""Another shift survived, kid,"" he rumbled, voice like gravel rolling downhill. He tossed me my pay envelope—thicker than usual, like always when I pulled a double. ""You look like hell warmed over.""  
  
  
""Gee, thanks, Joe,"" I deadpanned, wiping down the last of the glasses. ""You always know just what to say to make a girl feel special.""  
  
  
Joe chuckled, the sound rumbling deep in his chest like distant thunder. ""Yeah, yeah. You gonna go punish yourself at the gym again, or you finally gonna get some damn sleep like a normal person?""  
  
  
I shrugged, sliding the glass onto the rack. ""Gotta stay sharp. Never know when some drunk idiot’s gonna test his luck.""  
  
  
Joe’s grin was all teeth. ""Ain’t that the truth. Though, between you and me, I’d pay good money to see you put Grady’s nephew through a wall one of these days.""  
  
  
I snorted. ""Tempting. But I like my job. And my freedom.""  
  
  
Joe waved a meaty hand. ""Eh, I’d bail you out. Long as you didn’t break anything too expensive.""  
  
  
That was Joe—all bark, no bite unless you really earned it. He’s a sweet big guy, really. The kind of guy who’d toss a troublemaker out on his ass one minute and slip him a coffee and a twenty for a cab the next. The locals loved him, respected him, and—most importantly—knew better than to push him.  
  
  
I grabbed my jacket from the hook behind the bar, the worn leather creaking as I shrugged it on.  
  
  
""Don’t work too hard, boss,"" I tossed over my shoulder as I headed for the door.  
  
  
Joe’s laughter followed me out. ""Says the kid who’s about to go lift a small car for fun. Youth is wasted on the young, I swear to God.""  
  
  
The night air hit me like a slap, crisp and sharp with the scent of dust and distant rain. My boots crunched over gravel as I made my way to the parking lot, eyes scanning the shadows out of habit.  
  
  
There she was—my beat-up blue pickup, rust creeping along the wheel wells like ivy, but the engine still purred like a contented cat when I needed her to. I patted the hood like an old friend. Still here. Good.  
  
  
I didn’t need a getaway car in Duston. Not really. But old habits died hard, and I’d learned the hard way that running was sometimes the only option you got.  
  
  
Keys in hand, I hesitated.  
  
  
The gym was my cover story, and a decent one—plenty of folks lifted after work to blow off steam. But the real workout waited at Off the Rail, a dimly lit, no-frills fight club tucked behind the old rail yard.  
  
  
From the outside, it looked like a run-down storage unit—which, technically, it was. But inside? Inside, it was something else.  
  
  
The club’s air was thick with sweat, leather, and the sharp tang of liniment. The ring was nothing fancy—ropes, mats, and enough bloodstains in the wood to give it character. A few regulars nodded my way as I ducked through the crowd. No supernatural scents here, no magic. Just humans who liked to hit things and didn’t ask questions.

When I was on the hunt for investment banking analyst roles, I sent A LOT of networking emails letting people know I applied, or asking for coffee chats, etc.

And at the end I would always drop my phone number and LinkedIn profile. But that started to feel generic, and I wanted to be more creative, to stand out more.

So I made myself a simple personal website. Nothing fancy, but it definitely had more personality than my LinkedIn profile. Plus, I put a clean button that directed viewers on my site directly to my LI.

Interestingly, I immediately started realizing people were *friendlier* in their email responses. I don't know that it increased my response rate, but it definitely felt like my reception was increased.

I also continued to improve the site to show more of my personality, which I believe enhanced the reception of my emails (or at least lead people to be kinder).

Eventually, I broke into IB as an analyst and haven't upgraded the site much, but I'm thinking it's due for a refresh as I eventually look for my next role.

I’m curious if anyone else has tried this? Have you seen positive results like I did? ",2,1755313174.0,FinancialCareers,1,1.0,False

Hide. Survive. That’s all I’ve ever known—burying what I am, who I am, under a string of fake names and empty towns. I’m good at it.  
Until Duston.  
Until them. The Reapers.  
Kael, the protective Alpha who sees through my lies like glass.  
Dexter, the charming Brit Beta who turns “stay” into a temptation.  
Nox, the quiet hacker who glues my cracks with his warmness.  
Ezra, the pain-crave mercenary whose loyalty tastes like iron.  
Asher, the sharp-tongued assassin who snarls but stands guard.  
They see too much. Offer too much: a bar stool, a corner in their fight club, a roof that doesn’t feel temporary.  
Sanctuary. A word I’d forgotten.  
Their touches ignite me. For once, running feels like the wrong choice.  
I’m not scared of the hunters.  
I’m scared of what happens when they finally see me—all the monsters I’ve buried.  
Because when they find out who I really am?  
They’ll be the ones to break me.  
Chapter 1  
  
  
Raven’s POV  
  
  
The neon sign outside Jack’s buzzed like an angry hornet, flickering between OPEN and OPE before finally settling on PEN—which, honestly, was still accurate. The place wasn’t much to look at: a squat brick building with windows so dusty they might as well have been painted shut, wedged between Duston’s only hardware store and a defunct post office that still smelled like mothballs and regret.  
  
  
Inside, the air was thick with the scent of stale beer, fried onions, and the faint, lingering ghost of cigarette smoke from back when smoking indoors was still legal. The jukebox in the corner wheezed out a half-hearted country tune, something about lost love and pickup trucks, while the ceiling fan overhead spun lazily, like it couldn’t decide whether it wanted to circulate air or just give up and fall on someone’s head.  
  
  
Duston, Kansas. Population: who cares. The kind of town where the cows outnumbered the people, and the people outnumbered the brain cells after last call. I’d rolled in seven weeks ago with a duffel bag, a fake ID, and a story about being a drifter looking for honest work.  
  
  
Honest work.  
  
  
Good one, Raven.  
  
  
Here’s the thing about Duston—it was the perfect place to disappear. A nowhere town where people minded their business just enough to not ask why a 24-year-old girl with no last name (or at least, not one she’d admit to) showed up out of nowhere and started slinging drinks at a dive bar.  
  
  
I wiped down the bar with a rag that had seen better days—possibly during the Reagan administration—and tried not to think about how many germs were probably staging a mutiny on its surface.  
  
  
The door creaked open, and in walked Sheriff Grady, his boots scuffing against the worn wooden floor like he owned the place. Which, in a way, he kinda did. Duston was small enough that the law and the local drunkards were practically on a first-name basis.  
  
  
""Afternoon, Sheriff,"" I said, sliding a coaster his way. ""The usual?""

Perfect.  
  
  
""Hey Raven. Late tonight.""  
  
  
Said Dante, an ex-trucker.  
  
  
""Had to sweet-talk my boss into letting me leave."" I rolled my shoulders, already feeling the familiar itch under my skin—the need to move, to fight.  
  
  
Dante chuckled. ""Joe? Dude’s a teddy bear.""  
  
  
""Yeah, a teddy bear with a felony record,"" I shot back.  
  
  
He laughed, and for a second, it was easy to forget what I was. Just another fighter. Just another body in the ring.  
  
  
""Yo, Raven,"" called Marty from behind the makeshift front desk,""You here to work out or just scare the newbies again?""  
  
  
I smirked. ""Depends. Any fresh meat dumb enough to take me up on it tonight?""  
  
  
Marty snorted. ""Nah, they wised up after last time. But Rodriguez is around. Said something about you owing him a rematch.""  
  
  
Rodriguez. Now that was a fight worth sticking around for.  
  
  
I jerked my chin in acknowledgment and headed toward the lockers.  
  
  
I shoved my olive-green duffel inside, the kind of thing you’d see in gyms. But this wasn’t just gym gear. It’s my getaway bag.  
  
  
I unzipped it just enough to check the contents, my fingers brushing against:  
  
  
A fake ID under the name ""Raven Reyes"" (birthdate, hair color, and home state all wrong, but hey, I love that first name, sue me).  
  
  
$3,200 in mixed bills, rubber-banded and tucked inside a rolled-up pair of socks.  
  
  
A burner phone, charged but inactive.  
  
  
A change of clothes—black jeans, a gray hoodie, sturdy boots.  
  
  
A switchblade I’d lifted off a drunk in Wyoming.  
  
  
All of it ready to go in under five seconds.  
  
  
I exhaled, tension bleeding out of my shoulders. Still there. Still safe.  
  
  
""You gonna stare at your bag all night, or you gonna fight?""  
  
  
I didn’t jump, but it was close. Rodriguez leaned against the lockers, arms crossed, his knuckles a mess of scar tissue and fresh tape.  
  
  
""Just admiring my impeccable packing skills,"" I said, slamming the locker shut. ""You here to lose again, or what?""  
  
  
He grinned, all teeth. ""Nah, chica. Tonight’s the night you eat the mat.""  
  
  
I rolled my shoulders, cracking my neck. ""Promises, promises.""  
  
  
Chapter 3  
  
  
Raven’s POV  
  
  
Rodriguez took one look at me still shrugging off my jacket and jerked his chin toward the open mat space. ""You just got here. Warm up first. I’ll clear the ring.""  
  
  
I smirked. ""Scared I’ll cold-cock you if you don’t give me time to loosen up?""  
  
  
""Nah,"" he said, already turning away. ""Just don’t wanna hear you bitch about pulled muscles later.""  
  
  
Fair enough.  
  
  
I locked the locker, then headed to the open floor. The air was thick with the smell of sweat, leather wraps, and the faint metallic tang of blood from earlier bouts. The concrete walls echoed with grunts, the smack of fists on heavy bags, and the occasional burst of laughter from the regulars.  
  
  
I started slow, jogging laps around the perimeter of the room, letting my body wake up. My boots scuffed against the mat, my breath evening out as my muscles warmed. By the third lap, my pulse had settled into a steady rhythm, my senses sharpening.  
  
  
Then I moved to stretching.  
  
  
I planted my feet wide, bending at the waist to press my palms flat against the floor, letting my hamstrings burn. My tank rode up, exposing the defined lines of my lower back, the scars there pale and jagged against my skin.  
  
  
Minuets later, I finished my last stretch, rolling my shoulders as the familiar burn of warmed-up muscles settled in. Across the room, Rodriguez was clearing the center mat, shooing away a couple of rookies who looked like they’d rather watch the fight than be in one.  
  
  
Marty, leaning against the chain-link fence surrounding the ring, let out a low whistle as I twisted into a deep lunge.  
  
  
""Aw man,"" he sighed dramatically, pressing a hand to his chest. ""I think I fall in love with you, AGAIN, sister. I’m gonna propose to you right here, right now. Please say yes.""  
  
  
I snorted, rolling my eyes as I switched legs. ""Sure, Marty. The day you can take me in a fight is the day I say yes.""  
  
  
Dante, who had been wrapping his hands nearby without looking up, deadpanned, ""Guess that ain’t gonna happen in this lifetime, dude.""  
  
  
Marty clutched his chest like he’d been shot. ""Damn, Raven. Cold.""  
  
  
Rodriguez clapped his hands, cutting through the bullshit. ""Alright, lovebirds, break it up. You ready, Raven?""  
  
  
I cracked my knuckles. ""Always.""  
  
  
Rodriguez cracked his knuckles, rolling his shoulders like a bull ready to charge. The dim overhead lights of Off the Rail threw sharp shadows across the mat, turning the scuffed vinyl into a battlefield of light and dark.  
  
  
""No holding back tonight, "" he said, grinning. His stance was loose, but his eyes were sharp—he’d learned the hard way that underestimating me was a mistake.  
  
  
I smirked, bouncing lightly on the balls of my feet. ""Wouldn’t dream of it.""  
  
  
Then we were moving.  
  
  
Rodriguez came in fast, leading with a probing jab—testing my guard. I slipped it, countering with a low kick to his lead leg. Thud. Solid contact, but he barely flinched, already pivoting into a heavy right hook. I ducked, feeling the wind of his fist ruffle my hair, and fired back with a sharp elbow toward his ribs. He twisted, taking the hit on his arm instead, and shoved me back with a shoulder check.  
  
  
We circled, breathing steady, eyes locked.  
  
  
He feinted left, then lunged right, shooting for a takedown. I sprawled, hips low, digging my forearm into his neck to stall his momentum. For a second, we were locked in a sweaty, grunting stalemate—then I hooked a leg behind his knee and twisted, sending us both crashing to the mat.  
  
  
The crowd around the pit whooped. Someone yelled, ""Fuck him up, Raven!""  
  
  
Rodriguez rolled with the fall, popping back up before I could capitalize. He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, grinning. ""Nice try.""  
  
  
I flipped him off.  
  
  
We went at it again, trading blows—knees, elbows, fists. I caught him with a spinning back kick to the liver; he repaid me with a clubbing overhand that made my ears ring. The rhythm was familiar, almost comforting. This wasn’t a death match, just a dance we’d done a dozen times before, each of us pushing the other to the edge without going over.  
  
  
Then—smell.  
  
  
A scent I hadn’t smelled in weeks hit me like a bucket of ice water.  
  
  
WOLF.  
  
  
I was distracted for a second.  
  
  
Fun facts: when you’re in a middle of a fight, a second might as well be an hour.  
  
  
Rodriguez’s fist connected with my jaw.  
  
  
I hadn’t even seen it coming.  
  
  
The world tilted. My knees hit the mat, the impact jolting up my spine. The crowd’s cheers turned into a muffled roar, like I was underwater.  
  
  
Idiot. Never look away.

* **Sex/Neuter status: Female/Spayed**
* **Breed: Mixed, pit, rott, gsd, husky**
* **Body weight: 65lbs**
* **History: had tons of worms as a puppy when they were dumped, seems to have a sensitive stomach/GI.**
* **Clinical signs: black speckled liquid diarrhea (7) all day**
* **Duration: 13 hours**
* **Your general location: North Georgia**

Normally, I'm not an ""oh my god this is really bad"" when something happens for a day, but this seemed a little different. She had normal poops yesterday, sometimes near the evening she has softer stool. When cleaning up her diarrhea inside, I noticed that there are black spots throughout the liquid. She isn't acting any different but obviously when you first look up speckled poop the first thing that comes up is melena. However, there are no pictures of what is considered ""coffee grounds"" appearance in the poop so I have noting to compare it to. When I smelled it, it just smelled like usual diarrhea.

She does eat dirt sometimes...but I haven't seen her eat it in the last 24-36 hours (so I think).

Poop #1 earlier in the day, poop #2 30 minutes ago.

I just assumed that it’s like if they were quiting, but they keep a few perks, no employee is required to give 2 weeks notice it’s just industry standard, so I understand if they would need maybe a month to sort out their benefits for the Coffee Break but 4-6 months seems like something they pulled out their behind.

This involves aging the wine in stacked barrels, with periodic blending of older and younger wines.The solera system allows for a fraction of the oldest wine to be bottled each year, while the barrels are topped up with younger wine, perpetuating a continuous aging process. This ensures that the sherry maintains its characteristic flavor profile across different vintages.

**Controlled Fermentation and Fortification:** The fermentation process is carefully controlled to ensure the desired sugar levels and flavor development. Fortification involves adding grape spirit to increase the alcohol content, which helps to preserve the wine and enhance its stability.

The timing and method of fortification are crucial steps in producing cream sherry. The added spirit must be of high quality and carefully integrated to avoid disrupting the wine's delicate balance.

When I was nine months pregnant, I received an email with an electronic bank statement. My husband, Daniel Hart, had been transferring $30,000 to the same woman every month without fail. The first payment was dated back two years, right around the time we lost our first child.  
  
Then, as if on cue, my phone chimed with a messenger notification. from her.  
  
It was a friend request, along with a note that read:-  
  
“The happy woman who gets $30,000 in pocket money every month.’ I felt an eerie calm wash over me, almost unnatural. As I stroked my belly, I clicked ‘accept.’  
  
Immediately, a message popped up:  
  
‘Did you get the bank statement?‘  
  
Ignoring it, I went straight to her account profile. The earliest post was from two years ago, on April 21. In the photo, she leaned gently on a man’s shoulder, her hand resting on him, showcasing a massive diamond ring.  
  
The caption read:  
  
“Thank you for the birthday gift, love!”  
  
Although only the man’s back was visible, I recognized him instantly. It was Daniel. My husband. He was wearing the shirt Lhad bought him. during a business trip, the one with intricate embroidery on the collar.  
  
Two years ago, April 21, was the day lost our first child. While I lay in the cold, sterile operating room, undergoing a D&C procedure, my ‘on–a–business–trip‘ husband was celebrating another woman’s birthday.  
  
The irony was almost suffocating.  
  
  
  
My hands trembled as I scrolled further through her posts. Since that day, she had been flaunting all kinds of luxury items, each one identical to things I owned, except for one.  
  
A jasmine–scented perfume.  
  
Then I saw her most recent post, pinned at the top. It was an ultrasound image. She was pregnant.  
  
I dropped my phone, my heart pounding, and frantically searched through the dirty laundry basket. I found the shirt Daniel had worn the night before. Lifting it to my nose, the unmistakable scent of jasmine hit me.  
  
I never wear perfume.  
  
When I didn’t respond to the message, the person on the other end. grew impatient. My phone buzzed again and again as photos and videos came flooding in. Clutching my belly, I sank onto the couch, struggling to breathe.  
  
I forced myself to look at the undeniable evidence of Daniel’s betrayal. The woman in the photos was young and beautiful, her ponytail. bouncing with life. There were pictures of her and Daniel.  
  
He was rowing on a lake, playing in the snow, and tucking a maple leaf into her hair. It was as though each season, spring, summer, fall, and winter, was captured in their little love story.  
  
Taking a deep breath, I shakily opened one of the videos. In it, Daniel stood by the ocean, tenderly calling her ‘My Carina.‘  
  
She softly asked, “Do you love me?”  
  
This was my husband of seven years, the father of the baby growing inside me, replying with a warmth I hadn’t seen in years.  
  
‘I’ll always love you, Cara.’  
  
I replayed the video over and over, tears streaming down my face. As dusk fell, the room around me grew dim.  
  
Daniel finally came home. His voice was gentle as he lightly scolded me, “Olivia, why didn’t you turn on the lights? It’s so dark! What if you fall?”  
  
He flipped the light switch, and the room lit up. I quickly covered my tear–streaked face as he knelt in front of me and took my hand.  
  
“Why are you crying? Who made my precious wife and our little one so sad?” he asked, his voice soft as he kissed my belly.  
  
As he leaned closer, I smelled the same sweet jasmine fragrance. Struggling to keep calm, I asked, “Where were you?”  
  
“I was working late at the office. What’s wrong, honey?” Daniel replied casually, as though nothing was out of the ordinary..  
  
‘You’re lying, Daniel. You were with Cara! She had a craving for those famous dumplings from the east side of the city, and since there was no delivery, you drove over an hour from the west side to get them for her. She even live–streamed the whole thing!‘  
  
Feigning nonchalance, I smiled, gently squeezing his hand. “Honey, I suddenly have a craving for those dumplings from the east side, too,” I said, resting my hands on my belly.  
  
As if sensing my pain, the baby kicked hard. “Can you get some for me?”  
  
Annoyance flickered across Daniel’s face as he pulled his hand away, frustration creeping into his expression. “Those dumplings aren’t anything special. Besides, you’re pretty far along. You should watch what you eat.” Standing up, he added, “For the sake of our son, just bear with it a little longer, okay?”  
  
Without waiting for a response, he muttered, “I’m going to take a shower. I’m exhausted. Why don’t you call Mom and ask her to make you something?”  
  
The bathroom door clicked shut.  
  
Swallowing my sobs, I gently stroked my belly and whispered, “Oh, sweetheart, you and I are about to fight a tough battle together.”  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Daniel’s phone blinked on the dining table. As usual, he never even tried to hide his infidelity in front of me.  
  
Did he really think I was that naïve?  
  
The sound of water running in the bathroom echoed through the house. With a sigh, I struggled with my pregnant belly and slowly stood up. Hoping for a quick solution, I tried all the obvious. passwords from our wedding anniversary and our birthdays, but none of them worked. My hands trembled as I entered the date from Cara’s ultrasound report.  
  
Success!  
  
Biting my lip in frustration, I sneered as I opened the messaging app’s storage. Sure enough, Cara’s profile picture was there. Their avatars matched.  
  
He said, “If love lasts forever,” and she replied, “Does it matter if we’re together every day?”  
  
I clicked into the chat and was greeted by a flood of “Darling, I miss you” and “Baby, when will I see you again?” Determined not to let my emotions take over, I activated the screen recording feature.  
  
Next, I opened Daniel’s shopping app. To my dismay, his order history was filled with pregnancy supplements, skincare products, and makeup. They were all sent to the same address. Every delivery was made to Cara.  
  
With one hand resting on my restless baby, I took screenshots with the other. I sent the videos and screenshots to myself, then carefully deleted the evidence. Satisfied that everything was in order, I placed the phone back exactly where I’d found it.  
  
Waddling back to the bedroom, I lay down on my side. The weight of betrayal settled over me as my heart felt like it had a hole ripped. through it, and I couldn’t stop shivering from the cold weight of betrayal. After seven years of marriage, I had been reduced to a cruel joke.  
  
When Daniel came out of the shower, his phone rang. From my vantage point, through the crack in the door, I saw his face soften as he answered the call. Glancing toward the bedroom, he carefully stepped out onto the balcony, closing the door behind him.  
  
Curiosity gnawing at me, I forced myself up and stood by the door, watching him. I couldn’t make out the words, but his expression was tender, with a slight smile. At some point, whoever was on the other end must have said something that made him frown in discomfort. But soon enough, he caved, agreeing with a subtle smile.  
  
The chill in my chest deepened. Slowly, I turned and dragged myself back to bed, feeling as if the air had been sucked out of the room. Even breathing felt like a burden.  
  
A few minutes later, I heard Daniel tiptoe back inside. One of his. hands rested on my belly while the other gently brushed the hair from my forehead.  
  
His voice was soft as he whispered, “Baby, there’s an urgent project at work. I need to go in.”  
  
I turned my head and stared deeply into his eyes. My last shred of hope flickered weakly as I asked, “I don’t feel well. Could you stay?”  
  
For a brief moment, I thought that if he chose to stay with me instead of running to her, I could try to forgive him.  
  
But then I remembered: Once the kite string snaps, it can never be fixed.  
  
As expected, Daniel gave me a troubled smile, trying to reassure me. “Sweetheart, this project is essential for the company. Lean’t miss it.” “I’ll call Mom to come over and stay with you, okay?”  
  
A wave of nausea washed over me, goosebumps prickling my skin. Still, I managed to force out the words, “Drive safely.”  
  
I lay there in silence, watching him get dressed and leave. Slowly, I got up, holding my belly, and made my way downstairs to hail a taxi. “Maplewood Estates,” I told the driver.  
  
He sped through the streets, and just as we arrived, I saw Daniel’s car pull in. My stomach clenched as I asked the driver to park behind a tree. From the back seat, I watched as Cara fluttered into Daniel’s arms like a butterfly.  
  
He caught her gently, placing a hand on her flat stomach. His face softened with a look of tender reproach, and he playfully tapped her nose.  
  
Cradling my belly with one hand, I took out my phone and switched to video mode. With trembling fingers, I watched through the screen as Daniel lifted Cara into the passenger seat and carefully buckled her seatbelt.  
  
My eyes burned, but I blinked back the tears.  
  
“Driver, follow that car,” I said.  
  
The car climbed onto the overpass, neon lights flashing by outside the window. In a daze, my nails dug into the window frame until they split, the sharp pain snapping me back to reality. I put my bleeding fingers into my mouth and bit down hard.  
  
As the car wove through the city streets, I repeated to myself repeatedly, “Olivia, endure it. The pain will pass.”  
  
When we arrived at Riverside General Hospital, I scanned the QR code to pay the driver.  
  
As I stepped out of the car, the usually quiet driver turned to me and said, with unexpected kindness, “Miss, take care of yourself. For the baby’s sake, don’t hurt yourself.”  
  
Since discovering Daniel’s affair, I hadn’t told a soul. The secret felt like poison, slowly eating away at me from the inside. The kindness of a stranger felt like a fresh breath of air, pulling me back from the abyss.  
  
I gently closed the car door, offering him a small smile. “Don’t worry, Sir. No–one can hurt me anymore. Because I’m ready to throw the trash where it belongs.”  
  
Chapter 3  
  
I hid behind a pillar, watching Daniel. He had been too busy with work to attend a single prenatal check–up with me during my entire pregnancy. Yet here he was, running around the hospital, registering, picking up medication, and gently helping another woman in and out like the perfect husband.  
  
At that moment, I realized it wasn’t that he was too busy. He didn’t want to make an effort for the wife he’d been married to for seven years.  
  
In the bustling hospital lobby, Daniel held the woman close, reminding her, “The doctor said you should eat less tonight and try to stay active. In the early stages of pregnancy, digestion can be tricky, so let’s follow the advice this time, okay?”  
  
“Aww, fine, I got it!” she replied, pouting playfully. But it’s your fault! You bought way too many dumplings.”  
  
“Alright, alright, I’ll take the blame,” he said with a smile. “It’s my fault. for making my sweetheart eat too much, okay?”  
  
“That’s better.” She smirked. “Fine, I’ll forgive you… this time.”  
  
As I watched them, they bantered like a real couple, close and inseparable, while I stood under the hospital’s harsh fluorescent lights, feeling like an intruder in my own life. I was invisible to them. With a heavy heart, I held my belly and slowly shuffled out of the hospital. Outside, the scene was no less cruel. The rain had started. The cold autumn wind blew against me, and the rain felt like it was trying to drown the world in its chill. Through the mist, I watched as Daniel draped his coat over her, shielding her from the rain and gently helping her into the front passenger seat.  
  
The woman smiled up at him, grabbing his tie and pulling him in for a kiss. My husband cupped her face and kissed her deeply right there in the rain. When they finally pulled apart, he tapped her nose playfully, and she tugged on his tie again, biting his lip hard.  
  
To my surprise, instead of getting upset, he just smiled like he was  
  
thrilled. Then, he got into the car. As the car was about to pull away, the woman rolled down the window, locking eyes with me.  
  
She gave me a smug, taunting look and said, “Olivia, you’ve lost.”  
  
I smiled and shook my head. A strange calm washed over me. “It’s okay, Olivia.”  
  
Then, I whispered to myself, “He’s just a man, nothing more.”  
  
As the car turned the corner, I waved. “Daniel, I don’t want you anymore. You’re hers.”  
  
In that decisive moment, standing under the hospital awning, I calmly sent all the evidence I had gathered to my mentor, a well–known divorce lawyer. I was going to secure the best future for my child, no matter what.  
  
By the time I finished, the rain had already soaked the hem of my dress. Oddly enough, I barely noticed. Just as I put my phone away, it rang.  
  
It was Mom.  
  
“Olivia, I made some soup for you and brought it to the house. Where are you and Danny? Why aren’t you home?” Her voice was filled with warmth and concern.  
  
Before I could respond, she continued, “Oh, that Danny. You’re this far along, and he’s still taking you out? You really need to be careful right now.”  
  
Hearing my mom’s voice felt like a blow, like opening a floodgate I had been trying so hard to keep closed. All the pain I had been holding in grew into an overwhelming weight, pressing down on my chest. I bit down hard on my lip, fighting back the sob rising in my throat. The pain of suppressing it sent a shiver through my entire body.  
  
“Mom, don’t worry,” I said, forcing a smile even though she couldn’t see me.  
  
“We’re just out having dinner.” I swallowed hard, trying to keep my voice steady. “Oh, we’re being careful. Danny’s right here with me.”  
  
I had to keep it together. I couldn’t let my mom hear me cry. I wouldn’t.  
  
“It’s raining, Mom. Drive home safely, okay? Text me when you get there.”  
  
I hung up quickly before my voice could betray me. Once the call ended, I took a deep breath and tried to hold everything in, but no matter how hard I tried, the tears finally spilled over. I cried quietly, my body trembling under the weight of it all.  
  
There I stood, a heavily pregnant woman, belly aching, surrounded by strangers coming and going from the hospital. And in that cold, indifferent world, I cried until I had no more tears left in me.  
  
Chapter 4  
  
Daniel didn’t come home that night. Instead, he only sent a text:  
  
‘Hey Olivia, I’m working late tonight and crashing into the office. It’s getting cold and rainy, so don’t forget to close the window before bed. Love you always, your husband.‘  
  
I read the message without feeling anything. In the past, I would have worried, replied, or waited for Daniel. Now, I didn’t even bother to respond. I used to think I was the happiest woman in the world because I had the best husband. But reality hit me hard. It had all been a ridiculous facade. People’s hearts are hidden behind their ribs, and their lies are scribbled on paper.  
  
A few days later, I received the divorce papers my lawyer had drafted. I printed them out, signed my name, and started packing up my things to move back to my mom’s place. Just as I was getting ready to leave, my phone rang with an unknown number.  
  
It was Cara.  
  
We met at a café downstairs. Cara arrived with an air of confidence, sitting across from me with a smug smile, a supermarket shopping bag by her side. Three months pregnant and balancing on thin high heels, she looked at me as if she had already won.  
  
“I thought you wouldn’t come,” she said, a smug lilt in her voice. “After all, you never replied to my messages.”  
  
I smiled calmly. My heart was steady, not a flicker of emotion breaking through. “Why wouldn’t I come? I haven’t done anything shameful that I need to hide.” I leaned back, still smiling. “Besides, Daniel and I are legally married, so I have nothing to hide. Unlike some people who, no matter how hard they try, will always be the hidden third.” “You-!” she snapped, but I cut her off again.  
  
“Oh, and thank you, by the way,” I said, my voice steady. “For sending me all the evidence of your little affair with Daniel. Collecting all that would’ve been much harder on my own.”  
  
I smiled, this time more dismissively. “So, this coffee’s on me.”  
  
I placed some cash under my cup, stood up slowly, and rested my hand on my belly.  
  
“What do you mean by that?” she asked through clenched teeth as she grabbed my arm.  
  
“It means I don’t want him anymore, I replied, pulling my arm free. “If you want him, he’s all yours.”  
  
Her eyes narrowed, and she threw my arm aside angrily. “What game are you playing now? Don’t think I’m buying this for a second!”  
  
The force of her shove sent me stumbling backward, and I fell to the floor. At that moment, it felt like a knife had ripped through my belly. Pain shot through me, and I felt my body convulsed.  
  
Blood poured from between my legs, and I screamed in terror, “Save my baby!”  
  
I barely registered Cara fleeing in panic. Forcing myself to stay calm, I asked the café staff to call an ambulance. By the time they lifted me into the ambulance, my dress was drenched in blood.  
  
As my consciousness began to slip away, I heard a nurse asking for my phone password. I unlocked it for her, and they called my emergency contact, my husband, six times.  
  
Finally, he picked up on the last call.  
  
“Olivia, there’s an emergency at work,” Daniel’s sharp and impatient voice said. We’re in the middle of a critical meeting. I’ll call you later, okay? Be good.”  
  
The line went dead. But I could hear Cara’s voice clearly in the background.  
  
I turned away from the nurse’s pitiful eyes and wiped the blood from my hands with my dress. My fingers shook as I took the phone and dialed my mom.  
  
I had to sound calm.  
  
“Mom, I… I’m going into labor.” I swallowed hard, fighting through the pain..  
  
My mom replied, “Don’t panic, okay? Just listen. Go to my place, grab my ID and the hospital bag, and take a cab to Riverside General. Whatever the doctors tell you to do, do it.”  
  
“I’m fine, Mom, really. Don’t worry about me.” I reassured her before quickly hanging up.  
  
Right then, the contractions hit me like a tidal wave, and I screamed.  
  
Cold sweat poured down my face, my whole body shaking uncontrollably. As I drifted in and out of consciousness, I used the last bit of strength I had to grab the doctor’s hand.  
  
“Please, save my baby!” I gasped.  
  
I couldn’t lose my baby. Not again.

Most legal staff are female, and younger females. I’ve been practicing for over a decade, so not a “young” lawyer.

The men lawyers can do all things last minute, be crass, yell at them - yet the staff treat them with respect still.

Me, god forbid I don’t feel like they’re all doing me a favor.

Example: I needed a laptop I can use for an hour in the conference room cuz I forgot mine at home. I had to be on the phone 3-4x with the staff for them to tell me they didn’t want to take a laptop away from an intern (not interns in law school, so not really doing anything pressing), and I was asked if I can just run home and get mine.

Meanwhile, my colleague, practiced same number of years as me - was on a Zoom meditation, which he had a lot of down time. But the staff delivered him coffee. Then delivered him a damn sandwich. 

I’m so burned out. Generally by the job as a lawyer, and made worse by staff that seems to want to just sabotage me at every corner. ",5,1755312001.0,Lawyertalk,3,0.78,False
1mridp9,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1mridp9/the_100th_divorce_paper/,The 100th Divorce Paper,"Nora Sinclair and Sebastian Blackwood had filed for divorce ninety-nine times.  
  
Every single time, Sebastian would wait silently during the cooling-off period, confident she would come crawling back. She would plead, and only then would he agree to withdraw the papers.  
  
But on the hundredth filing, as Nora stood to leave, the clerk behind the desk couldn’t resist asking, ""So, when are you coming back to cancel it this time?""  
  
Nora glanced at Sebastian’s retreating figure—cold, indifferent—and steeled herself.  
  
Not this time.  
  
When the thirty-day waiting period ended, it would finally be over.  
  
The wind outside the courthouse was sharp, biting into her skin. Nora stepped onto the sidewalk just in time to see Sebastian slide into his sleek black Bentley without so much as a backward glance.  
  
She walked slowly, the hollow ache in her chest widening with every step. The cold seeped in, filling the cracks of her shattered resolve.  
  
Then—screeching tires.  
  
Before she could react, a hard shove sent her sprawling onto the pavement. Her knees burned, her palms stinging as they scraped against the concrete.  
  
Through the tangle of her hair, she recognized Sebastian’s friends stumbling out of the car.  
  
""Shit! We just hit Mrs. Blackwood!""  
  
""Don’t call her that,"" someone muttered. ""They’re divorcing. Sebastian hasn’t called it off yet.""  
  
Nora pushed herself up, legs trembling. Her gaze flickered to the Bentley’s half-lowered window, where Sebastian’s sharp profile was barely visible in the shadows.  
  
One of the guys hesitated. ""Should we take her to the hospital or just head to the club?""  
  
A beat of silence. Nora’s breath hitched as she waited, her heart pounding.  
  
""To the club."" Sebastian’s voice was ice.  
  
Those three words cut deeper than any blade.  
  
The car roared away, exhaust fumes choking her.  
  
Clenching her jaw, Nora forced herself to stand. She limped home, every step a fresh agony—but nothing compared to the raw, gaping wound in her chest.  
  
The moment she stepped inside, she began packing.  
  
She tore through their shared space, yanking out every remnant of their years together.  
  
The diamond bracelet he’d tossed at her after a fight. The silver cufflinks she’d stolen from his dresser. The jar of a thousand handwritten notes she’d left for him over the years.  
  
One by one, she dumped them into the trash. Then, from the depths of her drawer, she pulled out a faded envelope.  
  
Her hands shook as she unfolded the letters inside—letters she’d found by accident, hidden in Sebastian’s safe.  
  
""You brought coffee to my office again today. You didn’t see me watching from the window as you left.""  
  
""That blue dress you wore last night—I wish I’d been the only one to see you in it.""  
  
""Three years of you chasing me. I almost gave in last week. But I wanted to see how far you’d go.""  
  
Each line was a knife to her ribs.  
  
If she hadn’t stumbled upon these letters, she would never have believed that Sebastian—always so cold, so detached—had ever cared for her at all.  
  
She’d first seen him at a university gala.  
  
Sebastian had been onstage, delivering a speech with effortless arrogance, untouchable and perfect.  
  
One look, and she was lost.  
  
She’d spent four years chasing him—bringing him coffee he never drank, memorizing his schedule just to ""accidentally"" run into him, even breaking her ankle once when she’d snuck into a closed gym to watch him play basketball.  
  
And when they finally got together, he’d remained distant. She’d been the one to propose. She hadn’t minded.  
  
But after three years of marriage, Sebastian had filed for divorce ninety-nine times.  
  
The first time? Because she’d overcooked his steak.  
  
The second? Because she’d laughed too loudly at a party.  
  
The ninety-eighth? Because she’d texted him eleven times in a day instead of his arbitrary limit of ten.  
  
Every. Single. Time. She had begged.  
  
On the ninety-ninth filing, she’d spent the entire night on her knees in his study before he’d finally relented.  
  
That same night, she’d found the letters.  
  
All this time, he’d enjoyed watching her beg.  
  
The next morning, Sebastian filed for divorce for the hundredth time—because she’d left a water ring on his desk.  
  
And for the first time in seven years, Nora looked at the man she’d loved and felt nothing but exhaustion.  
  
This time, she wouldn’t play his game.  
  
She wiped her face roughly and turned back to her suitcase—only to freeze.  
  
Her mother’s silver locket—the only thing she had left of her—was gone.  
  
She tore apart the bedroom, the closet, even the bathroom. Nothing.  
  
Then she remembered. The only other person who’d been in the study that night was Sebastian.  
  
Clenching her fists, she grabbed her coat and headed out.  
  
The club was pulsing with noise, laughter spilling into the hallway. She didn’t bother knocking.  
  
Inside, Sebastian’s friends were placing bets.  
  
""Five days max before Nora comes crawling back!""  
  
""Three. She’s obsessed.""  
  
""One. She was literally on her knees last time!""  
  
Sebastian sat at the center, swirling his drink, expression unreadable.  
  
Just as someone asked, ""Sebastian, what’s your guess?""—  
  
The door slammed open.  
  
Nora stood there, eyes blazing.  
  
""Forever.""Chapter 2  
  
Just as Nora began to speak, a honeyed voice interrupted her.  
  
“Sorry I’m late.”  
  
Victoria Kensington glided into the room, effortlessly stealing the spotlight.  
  
With practiced grace, she looped her arm through Sebastian’s and nestled against him, her smile saccharine.  
  
Nora’s fingers curled into her palms as she took in their closeness, forcing herself to look away.  
  
Victoria had been a constant shadow in Sebastian’s life—through his first girlfriend, his engagement, even his marriage to Nora.  
  
He never pushed her away. Never set boundaries. Instead, he let her linger, blurring lines as if it meant nothing.  
  
For years, Nora had questioned if Sebastian truly loved Victoria.  
  
But after finding those letters, the truth was undeniable.  
  
Victoria was just a pawn. A way to provoke Nora’s jealousy.  
  
Sebastian enjoyed watching her unravel.  
  
His gaze flickered to Nora standing in the doorway, and his brow furrowed. “What are you doing here?”  
  
Her grip tightened on her bag strap. He hadn’t even heard her.  
  
“My necklace is missing,” she said, holding his stare. “I just want to know if you’ve seen it.”  
  
Sebastian stilled, then his expression darkened. “That’s why you came?”  
  
“What other reason would there be?” Nora countered. “What did you think I was here for?”  
  
A storm brewed in his eyes.  
  
She knew that look.  
  
It always appeared when she refused to play into the narrative he’d scripted in his head.  
  
“Oh, that silver one?” Victoria cut in, blinking innocently. “I mentioned I liked it, so Sebastian gave it to me.” She sighed. “But I lost it on my way home.”  
  
Nora’s vision blurred with rage. “You gave her my necklace?!”  
  
“It’s just a piece of jewelry,” Sebastian snapped. “I’ll buy you a dozen more if it matters that much.”  
  
“It was my mother’s!” Her voice cracked.  
  
Silence swallowed the room.  
  
For a fleeting second, Sebastian looked stunned—then his mask of indifference slid back into place. “It’s gone. Stop making a scene.”  
  
Nora bit down on her lip until copper flooded her tongue.  
  
She’d told him what it meant to her. And still, he dismissed her.  
  
Was this what love looked like to him?  
  
Realizing the necklace was truly lost, she spun on her heel and strode out. If she stayed, she’d shatter right there in front of them.  
  
Behind her, a chair screeched against the floor. Sebastian stood. “We’re leaving.”  
  
He followed her.  
  
Outside, the wind lashed at Nora’s cheeks like shards of glass.  
  
She kept her head down, walking fast, unwilling to let anyone see the tears she couldn’t hold back.  
  
Then—a sharp crack above.  
  
Before she could react, a shout rang out. “Look out!”  
  
Her head jerked up. A massive billboard hurtled toward them.  
  
Sebastian lunged—  
  
Their eyes locked—  
  
And at the last second, he veered away, throwing himself over Victoria instead.  
  
Crash.  
  
Agony tore through her. But worse than the pain was the humiliation.  
  
He’d rather let her bleed than risk anyone thinking he cared.  
  
When she woke, sterile white walls greeted her.  
  
Nora turned her head weakly. The room was empty.  
  
“You’re awake,” a nurse said, entering to adjust her IV. “You’ve been unconscious for two days. Luckily, it’s just a mild concussion.”  
  
Her throat burned. “Who brought me in?”  
  
“Your husband,” the nurse replied. “He was frantic. Covered in your blood, looked like he was about to lose his mind.” She paused. “But the second the doctor said you’d recover, he left. Said it was urgent. Strange, isn’t it?”  
  
Nora closed her eyes and laughed, the sound hollow.  
  
Of course he ran.  
  
Sebastian would never let her see the truth.Chapter 3  
  
Sebastian didn’t appear for days.  
  
It was only when Nora was being discharged from the hospital that he finally showed up again.  
  
Victoria clung to his arm, her lips curved in a smug smile.  
  
""Honestly, Nora, you recover so quickly. I’ve always been delicate—just a little cold, and Sebastian panicked,"" Victoria cooed, batting her lashes. ""He insisted on bringing me here for a full examination.""  
  
Nora continued packing her belongings, refusing to spare them a glance.  
  
Sebastian’s gaze lingered on her, sharp and probing, as if trying to decipher her thoughts.  
  
Then, abruptly, he spoke. ""Perfect timing. We’ll drive you home. Victoria’s penthouse is under renovation, so she’ll be staying with us for a while.""  
  
Nora snapped her suitcase shut. ""Fine.""  
  
It didn’t matter. In two weeks, the mandatory waiting period would be over, and their marriage would dissolve.  
  
Sebastian could move in whoever he pleased. It wasn’t her concern anymore.  
  
Her indifference visibly darkened his mood.  
  
Back at the mansion, he made a show of doting on Victoria right in front of her—whispering in her ear, brushing strands of hair from her face.  
  
But no matter how hard he tried to provoke her, Nora remained unfazed.  
  
At dinner, Sebastian peeled shrimp and fed them to Victoria with deliberate tenderness.  
  
Nora forced herself to eat, though every bite tasted like sawdust.  
  
""Ah!"" Victoria suddenly gasped, clawing at her neck. ""It burns!""  
  
Nora looked up to see angry red welts spreading across Victoria’s skin. Her breathing turned ragged.  
  
Sebastian swept her into his arms. ""Call the doctor!""  
  
The physician arrived swiftly, diagnosing a severe peanut allergy.  
  
Sebastian’s glare turned icy as he summoned the maid. ""How many times have I told you Victoria can’t have peanuts? Who put peanut oil in the food?""  
  
The maid wrung her hands, her eyes darting nervously to Nora. ""Mrs. Blackwood instructed me to, sir. I—I didn’t dare refuse.""  
  
Nora shot to her feet, her chair screeching. ""I never—""  
  
""Please, Mrs. Blackwood, don’t lie!"" the maid cried, cutting her off. ""You said you couldn’t stand Miss Kensington being here. You told me to teach her a lesson!""  
  
""Nora.""  
  
Sebastian’s voice was a blade, slicing through the tension. The room turned frigid.  
  
He strode toward her, his polished shoes striking the marble like gunshots. ""You’ve been so quiet since the divorce papers. I thought you’d finally accepted it."" His gaze bore into her, ruthless. ""Clearly, I was wrong.""  
  
Nora opened her mouth to protest—then froze.  
  
A flicker of satisfaction curled at the edge of Sebastian’s lips. Brief, but unmistakable.  
  
""If you wanted Victoria to suffer an allergic reaction…"" He turned, retrieving a crystal decanter of whiskey from the bar. The bottle landed on the table with a sharp crack. ""Then you should experience it too.""  
  
Nora’s blood turned to ice as her back hit the wall.  
  
He knew. He knew she was deathly allergic to alcohol.  
  
Two bodyguards seized her, their grip bruising.  
  
The whiskey burned like acid, searing her throat, her stomach. She choked, tears streaming, yet somehow swallowed half the bottle.  
  
The itching started instantly—deep, maddening, crawling beneath her skin.  
  
Red splotches erupted across her neck, her arms. Her breath came in shallow gasps. Darkness crept at the edges of her vision.  
  
The last thing she saw before unconsciousness took her?  
  
Sebastian, silhouetted in the golden light, smiling.  
  
He was smiling.  
  
When she awoke, the bedroom was bathed in the dim glow of a single lamp.  
  
Sebastian sat on the edge of the bed, flipping through documents. He didn’t look up until she stirred.  
  
""Ah, you’re awake."" He closed the file, voice casual. ""Don’t test me again.""  
  
Nora pushed herself up, her throat raw.  
  
She caught the fleeting relief in his eyes—and suddenly, she understood. Her chest constricted.  
  
He didn’t care about Victoria’s allergy.  
  
What infuriated him was her indifference. What pleased him was seeing her jealous.  
  
Just like those locked-away letters. He thrived on her desperation.  
  
But she was done playing.  
  
Two more weeks.  
  
Then, they would be free of each other forever.Chapter 4  
  
Sebastian went all out, hosting an extravagant gala in celebration.  
  
Under the glittering chandeliers, he remained by her side all evening—intercepting unwanted drinks, adjusting the strap of her gown, playing the perfect doting partner.  
  
The murmurs spread like wildfire through the crowd. Sebastian treats his childhood friend like royalty, but his wife? An afterthought. They whispered that if not for Nora’s stubborn persistence, their marriage would have crumbled years ago.  
  
Nora stood apart, swirling her champagne, the gossip rolling off her like water.  
  
Midway through the night, she slipped outside to the garden terrace, craving the crisp night air.  
  
The breeze carried away the cloying scent of alcohol.  
  
“Finally reached your breaking point?”  
  
Victoria’s voice slithered from behind, laced with venomous amusement.  
  
She sauntered closer, heels clicking, lips curled in a smirk. “Honestly, if I were you, I’d have walked away ages ago.”  
  
Nora didn’t bother turning. “Get lost.”  
  
Victoria’s laugh was sharp. “Don’t pretend you’re unaffected. Four years chasing him, three years married, and he still looks right through you. Pathetic. Want to test it? Even if I pushed you into that lake, he wouldn’t lift a finger.”  
  
Before Nora could react—  
  
A brutal shove sent her stumbling backward.  
  
Splash.  
  
Icy water swallowed her whole. She gasped, choking as it flooded her mouth, her lungs.  
  
Through the blur, she saw a figure sprinting toward the water—  
  
“Nora!”  
  
Sebastian’s voice was raw, frantic. He plunged in, arms locking around her waist, hauling her against him.  
  
For a heartbeat, she stared into his eyes—wide, terrified, alive in a way she’d never seen.  
  
On the shore, Victoria stood frozen, disbelief twisting her features.  
  
Sebastian—who barely spared Nora a glance on a good day—had just dived in without hesitation.  
  
The way he clutched her, like she was something irreplaceable—  
  
It made no sense.  
  
Victoria’s nails dug into her palms. This wasn’t supposed to happen.  
  
On the grass, Sebastian dropped to his knees, pressing trembling hands to Nora’s chest. He didn’t stop until she coughed up water, gasping.  
  
Then—like a switch flipped—his expression shuttered.  
  
He stood abruptly, voice cold. “What were you thinking, falling in at a party?”  
  
Nora sat there, soaked, fingers twisting in her ruined dress. “I didn’t fall.” Her voice was steel. “Victoria pushed me.”  
  
Victoria’s eyes welled instantly. “That’s a lie! How could you accuse me?”  
  
Nora’s laugh was brittle. With shaking hands, she pulled out her phone. “Then let’s settle this with the police. Attempted murder carries consequences.”  
  
Sebastian caught her wrist, grip bruising. “Enough. It was an accident. Drop it.”  
  
Nora’s head snapped up. “She tried to drown me.”  
  
“And yet here you are,” he said flatly. “Stop making a scene.”  
  
The absurdity nearly choked her.  
  
She knew he used Victoria to provoke her—but this? Dismissing her life?  
  
Her thumb hovered over the call button. “I’m not backing down.”  
  
Sebastian snatched the phone. “You’re hysterical. Cool off.” He signaled a guard. “Take her to the quiet room. She stays until she’s calm.”  
  
Nora fought like a wild thing as the guard dragged her away.  
  
“Sebastian! Are you insane?!” Her voice cracked. “She tried to kill me! You know she did!”  
  
Her nails raked bloody lines down the guard’s arm. One heel snapped off in the struggle.  
  
But it was useless.  
  
The door slammed shut, plunging her into darkness.  
  
No windows. No light. Just suffocating black.  
  
Her breath hitched.  
  
“Let me out—”  
  
The walls pressed in. Memories surged—ten years old, locked in a basement by her stepmother for three endless days.  
  
That same terror coiled around her throat now.  
  
She curled into the corner, nails biting into her palms.  
  
Somewhere in the dark, a rat scuttled. She clamped her lips shut, afraid to even breathe.  
  
Time dissolved.  
  
She refused the meals they slid under the door. Overturned the water glass.  
  
Her throat burned, but the real torture was the silence, the isolation—the way it gnawed at her sanity.  
  
When the door finally creaked open the next morning, the light stabbed her eyes.  
  
“Had enough?” Sebastian’s voice, cool and detached.  
  
She lifted her head slowly.  
  
There he stood—immaculate suit, not a hair out of place—while she looked half-mad, hair tangled, dress ruined.  
  
Suddenly, she laughed. Tears spilled over.  
  
“You’re right.” Her voice was a ghost. “I’ve had enough.”  
  
No more fighting. No more clinging.  
  
All she wanted now was to escape—Sebastian, Victoria, this gilded cage that had become her prison.  
  
His frown flickered, something uneasy in his gaze. But it vanished just as fast.  
  
“Good.” He turned away. “See that you remember that.”  
  
He didn’t see the resolve hardening in her eyes.  
  
He didn’t see the end.Chapter 5  
  
Nora staggered back into her apartment and collapsed onto the bed, burying her face in the pillows.  
  
She thought she had cried herself dry, but fresh tears still spilled over, dampening the silk beneath her.  
  
Curling into a tight ball, she clutched the sheets, each breath aching like a knife between her ribs.  
  
She stayed like that—numb, hollow—until morning light crept through the curtains. Eventually, she dragged herself up, forcing down tasteless toast and gulping water like it could wash away the pain.  
  
Then her phone buzzed.  
  
A message lit up her old university group chat:  
  
""Reunion tonight! 7 PM at The Grand Royale! Don’t miss it!""  
  
Nora stared at the screen, her throat tightening.  
  
Since she’d be leaving for Paris soon, this would be her last chance to see them. A final goodbye.  
  
The Grand Royale glittered under crystal chandeliers. Nora had dabbed concealer over her puffy eyes and slipped into a simple ivory dress, understated but elegant.  
  
""Nora!"" Charlotte, her former roommate, waved excitedly from a round table. ""Over here!""  
  
A circle of familiar faces greeted her, asking about her life, her work.  
  
Charlotte smirked, leaning in. ""Remember how you chased Sebastian all through uni? Did you ever catch him?""  
  
A few others perked up, clearly eager for gossip.  
  
Nora’s fingers stilled around her wineglass.  
  
Back then, everyone knew she’d been obsessed with Sebastian. But they’d only gotten together after graduation—so no one knew they’d ever been married.  
  
And Sebastian had refused to even discuss a wedding.  
  
""No,"" she said, forcing a light laugh. ""Never did.""  
  
If she could rewrite history, she’d erase him entirely.  
  
""Seriously?"" someone gasped. ""Even you couldn’t land him? The man’s standards must be insane!""  
  
""Don’t worry,"" Charlotte chirped, already tapping her phone. ""I know at least five guys who’d kill to take you out—""  
  
""Who’s playing matchmaker?""  
  
A deep, icy voice cut through the chatter.  
  
Nora froze.  
  
She turned slowly to see Sebastian and Victoria standing just steps away.  
  
Sebastian looked devastating in a tailored black suit, a silver tie pin glinting under the lights. Victoria clung to his arm, radiant in a crimson gown that drew every eye in the room.  
  
The group erupted.  
  
""Sebastian?! No way!""  
  
""Is this your girlfriend?"" someone blurted.  
  
Victoria ducked her head with a coy smile. Sebastian didn’t deny it.  
  
Murmurs swirled instantly.  
  
""Of course the king of the finance program ends up with a supermodel. Power couple goals.""  
  
Nora sipped her water, gaze fixed on the table like it was the most fascinating thing in the world.  
  
Sebastian’s stare burned into her, sharp enough to draw blood.  
  
The party resumed, laughter and nostalgia filling the air. Then someone produced a bottle for Truth or Dare.  
  
After a few spins, the bottle landed on Victoria.  
  
""Dare!"" she declared, fluttering her lashes at Sebastian.  
  
""Kiss someone here for fifteen seconds!""  
  
The group whooped.  
  
Victoria bit her lip, pretending to hesitate—but she was already stepping toward Sebastian.  
  
He lounged on the sofa, one arm slung over the back, his gaze sliding past the crowd to Nora.  
  
She didn’t even look up from her phone.  
  
His jaw tightened.  
  
""Sebastian…"" Victoria stood before him, breathless.  
  
Then he yanked her down into a fierce, possessive kiss.  
  
The room erupted in cheers.  
  
The kiss lasted far longer than fifteen seconds—deliberately loud, deliberately obscene.  
  
Nora finally glanced over.  
  
And met Sebastian’s darkened eyes over Victoria’s shoulder.  
  
She held his gaze for one heartbeat.  
  
Then returned to her phone, expression blank.  
  
Sebastian’s grip on Victoria turned bruising.Chapter 6  
  
Sebastian fed her, his arm wrapped possessively around her waist as he murmured sweet nothings into her ear.  
  
Yet, his gaze kept straying back to Nora.  
  
She didn’t react. Not even a flicker of emotion.  
  
When the party ended, Nora slipped away to the restroom to touch up her makeup.  
  
The moment she stepped out, Victoria materialized at the end of the hallway, blocking her path.  
  
""See this?"" Victoria smirked, shoving her phone in Nora’s face. The screen displayed a photo of her and Sebastian locked in a passionate kiss. ""He wants me. So do us both a favor and sign those divorce papers already. Stop humiliating yourself by clinging to him.""  
  
Nora didn’t dignify her with a response. She simply walked past, brushing her shoulder against Victoria’s without a word.  
  
Victoria’s face twisted in fury. Her carefully orchestrated moment had just been dismissed like it was nothing.  
  
Her fingers curled into a fist, ready to strike—until the sound of approaching footsteps made her pause.  
  
A second later, two sharp slaps rang out.  
  
Victoria had struck herself—hard. Her cheeks bloomed red, swelling instantly.  
  
The restroom door burst open.  
  
""Sebastian!"" she wailed, throwing herself into his arms, tears streaming. ""Nora hit me! Just because I was teasing you earlier…""  
  
Sebastian held her, but his eyes burned into Nora’s.  
  
So this was why she’d seemed so indifferent all night.  
  
She was jealous.  
  
The realization sent a dark thrill through him, though his expression remained icy.  
  
""It was harmless fun,"" he said coldly. ""And we’re divorced. What I do is no longer your concern."" His gaze raked over Nora’s pale face. ""Hurting Victoria won’t change anything. If you want me back, you’ll have to do better than this.""  
  
""I didn’t touch her,"" Nora said evenly. ""She—""  
  
""Enough."" His voice cracked like a whip. ""If you’re going to act like this, then stay here and think about what you’ve done.""  
  
The door slammed shut. The lock clicked.  
  
Nora pounded against it until her hands ached, her skin raw.  
  
Hours later, the lock finally turned.  
  
She exhaled, stepping out—only for three men to emerge from the shadows, surrounding her.  
  
The leader grabbed her hair, jerking her head back. ""You Nora Sinclair?""  
  
""No,"" she lied, already twisting to run.  
  
A fist buried itself in her stomach.  
  
The pain stole her breath. Before she could recover, another man yanked her up by her hair.  
  
A brutal slap snapped her head to the side. Blood welled at the corner of her lips.  
  
""Pretty face, but no shame, huh?"" The man sneered, slapping her cheek mockingly. ""Let’s fix that.""  
  
The blows rained down.  
  
Nora crumpled, curling into herself, arms shielding her head.  
  
Something cracked in her ribs. White-hot agony seared through her, but she bit back every sound.  
  
""Alright, that’s enough,"" one finally muttered. ""Ms. Kensington just wanted her taught a lesson.""  
  
Their footsteps faded, leaving her broken on the cold tiles.  
  
Every breath was fire.  
  
She tried to move her fingers. Even that sent pain lancing through her.  
  
Then, Victoria’s laughter echoed down the hall. ""Let’s see if she keeps that pride now.""  
  
Nora rolled onto her back, staring up at the blinding lights.  
  
Blood trickled down her temple.  
  
And yet—she smiled.  
  
So this was what Sebastian wanted?  
  
Maybe he’d once cared for her. But in the end, he wanted her broken. Destroyed. Trapped in a life worse than death.  
  
Fine.  
  
He got his wish.  
  
But it would be the last time.Chapter 7  
  
""Sebastian, there's a storm coming tonight. Will you stay with me until I fall asleep?""  
  
Nora clung to the banister as she ascended the stairs, every movement sending sharp jolts of pain through her body. Beads of cold sweat dotted her forehead with each labored step.  
  
Sebastian opened his mouth to refuse—until he saw her trembling frame. His jaw tightened. ""Fine.""  
  
Without another word, he wrapped an arm around Victoria’s waist and guided her toward the master bedroom, as if Nora were nothing more than a ghost in their home.  
  
A bitter smile touched Nora’s lips as she limped silently into the guest room.  
  
The following days blurred together as she poured herself into a prestigious design competition.  
  
This was the life she had once abandoned—the life she was determined to reclaim after the divorce.  
  
Back in university, Nora had been the star of her class. Her mentor, Isabella Whitmore, had once declared she would revolutionize the design world.  
  
But that dream had shattered the day Sebastian saw a colleague drop her off at home.  
  
""Quit your job, or I walk,"" he had said, his voice ice-cold.  
  
She had obeyed without protest. Now, for the first time in years, her fingers danced across the sketchpad again.  
  
Just as she was refining the final details of her submission, the door swung open.  
  
Sebastian strode in with Victoria at his side. The moment his eyes landed on the sketches, his expression darkened.  
  
""I told you I don’t approve of this,"" he snapped, snatching the pencil from her hand. ""If you think this will change my mind about the divorce, you’re wasting your time.""  
  
Nora almost laughed.  
  
Did he really believe she still cared about his approval?  
  
Wordlessly, she gathered her designs.  
  
Sebastian mistook her silence for surrender and left, satisfaction etched across his face.  
  
Victoria lingered, her gaze lingering on the sketches with undisguised fascination.  
  
Three days after submitting her entry, Nora received a call from the competition organizers.  
  
""Ms. Sinclair, we’ve received a plagiarism claim against your work. Unless you can provide proof of originality, we’ll have to disqualify you.""  
  
""What?"" Nora’s breath caught. ""Who am I accused of copying?""  
  
""The submission matches one from Victoria Kensington. Given her rising reputation, the burden of proof falls on you.""  
  
Nora’s stomach dropped. She remembered the way Victoria had studied her sketches.  
  
""I have the original draft,"" she insisted.  
  
But when she searched her room, the manuscript was gone.  
  
""Looking for this?""  
  
Nora whirled around. Victoria stood in the doorway, holding the missing designs.  
  
""How did you get those?"" Nora demanded.  
  
Victoria smirked, twirling the papers between her fingers. ""Sebastian gave them to me. He said I could have whatever I wanted.""  
  
She stepped closer, her voice a venomous whisper. ""He’s mine. Stop clinging to a dead marriage. Let him go—it’s pathetic.""  
  
Nora’s vision blurred. She stormed to Sebastian’s study, but he barely glanced up.  
  
""I warned you to stop this nonsense. If you’d listened, you wouldn’t be in this mess.""  
  
She stared at the man she had loved for seven years, her heart fracturing.  
  
Why did he always do this?  
  
He never respected her passions. Never considered her feelings.  
  
If not for those old letters, she might have believed he never cared at all.  
  
With the original draft gone, Nora knew arguing was pointless. The world already saw her as a fraud.  
  
Numb, she retreated to her room and drowned in the darkness.  
  
The shrill ring of her phone jolted her back to reality.  
  
""Nora! Is it true? Are you returning to design?"" Isabella’s voice crackled with excitement. ""I saw your competition entry!""  
  
Nora’s throat tightened. ""Isabella, I didn’t plagiarize.""  
  
""I know,"" Isabella said without hesitation. ""No one else has your touch. I’ve always known that.""  
  
A sigh. ""What a waste, giving it all up for Sebastian.""  
  
""I was a fool,"" Nora admitted, wiping her tears. ""But the divorce is almost final. I’m ready to start over.""  
  
""Perfect!"" Isabella cheered. ""Join my studio in Paris. Your old classmates are here, and we’re thriving. With your talent, you’ll be the industry’s brightest star!""  
  
""Are you sure?""  
  
""Of course! Who trained you, hm?"" Isabella teased. ""If you hadn’t vanished all those years ago—""  
  
Nora inhaled deeply. ""I’ll come. As soon as the divorce is done.""  
  
The door slammed open.  
  
Sebastian stood there, his expression unreadable.  
  
""Where,"" he growled, ""do you think you’re going?""Chapter 8  
  
Sebastian narrowed his eyes at her, suspicion flickering in his gaze, but he didn’t press further.  
  
Instead, he said, “You and Victoria have been at each other’s throats because of the design competition. I’ll take you both to the theme park tomorrow. It’ll help clear the air.”  
  
Nora almost refused immediately but caught herself.  
  
She remembered how she used to plead with him to visit amusement parks, only for him to dismiss them as juvenile.  
  
If she rejected him now, it might raise questions.  
  
“Fine,” she murmured.  
  
The theme park was swarming with visitors.  
  
Sebastian stuck close to Victoria, fastening her seatbelt on the roller coaster, lifting her onto the carousel, even feeding her cotton candy.  
  
Nora lingered behind like an afterthought.  
  
Then, Sebastian’s phone buzzed—a call from the office. He stepped away to answer it. Victoria seized Nora’s wrist. “Let’s try the bungee jump!”  
  
Nora instinctively recoiled. “No.”  
  
“Sebastian said we should try to get along,” Victoria whispered, stepping closer. “Still bitter about the design theft? You really can’t let things go.”  
  
Spectators nearby began to glance their way.  
  
Nora pressed her lips together, unwilling to cause a scene. Reluctantly, she followed Victoria onto the platform.  
  
Click!  
  
The harness locked into place. Victoria leaned in, her voice dripping with malice. “Oh, by the way, Sebastian promised me a private getaway to Bora Bora once the divorce is finalized—”  
  
The ride lurched violently before she could finish.  
  
“Ah!”  
  
The safety strap snapped.  
  
Nora’s stomach dropped as she and Victoria plunged from the towering height.  
  
Wind screamed past her ears. She squeezed her eyes shut, bracing for impact.  
  
But instead of pain, she landed in strong, familiar arms.  
  
When she opened her eyes, Sebastian’s face was inches from hers, his expression frantic.  
  
He held her so tightly she could feel his racing heartbeat.  
  
“You—”  
  
Before she could speak, he jerked back as if burned.  
  
“Mistake,” he muttered, voice rough, before rushing to Victoria’s crumpled form. “Victoria!”  
  
At the hospital, a doctor rushed forward. “She’s hemorrhaging badly—needs an immediate transfusion! RH-negative blood. Our reserves are critically low!”  
  
Sebastian’s gaze snapped to Nora.  
  
“You’re RH-negative.” It wasn’t a question.  
  
Nora leaned against the wall, her knee still oozing blood. She met his eyes and understood instantly.  
  
“Donate,” he commanded, stepping close enough for his breath to ghost over her ear. “Do this, and I’ll revoke the divorce papers.”  
  
His scent—cold, familiar—once would have made her pulse skip.  
  
Now, it left her hollow.  
  
When the nurse handed her the consent form, Nora signed without hesitation.  
  
She couldn’t afford to let Sebastian suspect anything—not when Paris was so close.  
  
She had to keep playing the role.  
  
The needle slid into her vein. She turned her head, watching her blood fill the bag.  
  
One bag. Then another.  
  
“That’s enough!” the nurse suddenly cried. “She’s past the safe limit!”  
  
Nora’s vision swam. A high-pitched ringing drowned out all sound.  
  
The world blurred. She glimpsed Sebastian standing nearby, his lips moving, but she couldn’t hear a word.Chapter 9  
  
The sterile white walls of the hospital burned my vision.  
  
After Nora had completed her blood transfusion, the doctors insisted she remain under observation. Yet, not once did Sebastian come to see her.  
  
Her phone buzzed relentlessly—Victoria’s latest taunt.  
  
A photo of Sebastian spoon-feeding her soup.  
  
Another of him standing vigil by her hospital bed.  
  
And then, the most intimate betrayal—a stolen snapshot of him pressing a kiss to Victoria’s cheek while she pretended to sleep.  
  
Nora deleted them one by one, her heart now a numb, hollow thing.  
  
When love dies, even pain fades into silence.  
  
On the final day of the waiting period, Nora woke before dawn.  
  
Golden sunlight spilled through the curtains as she zipped her suitcase shut, the last of her belongings tucked inside.  
  
The plane ticket to Paris—departing at 3 PM—lay nestled in her purse.  
  
Then, the doorbell chimed.  
  
Sebastian stood on the threshold, impeccably dressed in a tailored suit, as if he’d just stepped out of a boardroom.  
  
""Victoria’s condition is stable,"" he said without preamble. ""I promised to accompany you to withdraw the divorce filing. I keep my word.""  
  
Nora studied him in silence.  
  
""However,"" he added coldly, ""if you pull another stunt like this, I’ll be the one filing for divorce next time.""  
  
A bitter laugh nearly escaped her.  
  
There would be no next time.  
  
The drive to the courthouse was suffocatingly quiet. Nora clutched her bag strap until her knuckles whitened, the car finally rolling to a stop.  
  
""We’re here."" Sebastian unfastened his seatbelt. ""Make it quick. I need to get back to Victoria.""  
  
Nora’s gaze drifted to the courthouse doors, her fingers tracing the edge of her phone.  
  
She needed to ensure he didn’t follow her inside.  
  
Just as she opened her mouth, Sebastian’s phone rang.  
  
""Victoria?"" His brow furrowed as he answered. ""What’s wrong? Calm down—I’m on my way.""  
  
Hanging up, he turned to Nora. ""She’s hysterical. I have to go. Handle the withdrawal yourself and text me when it’s done.""  
  
Nora lowered her lashes, relief hidden beneath them. ""Fine.""  
  
She watched his car peel away before stepping into the courthouse.  
  
The clerk smiled in recognition. ""Ms. Sinclair, here to withdraw your application again?""  
  
""No."" Nora slid her documents across the counter. ""I’m here to finalize my divorce.""  
  
Back at the apartment, she placed Sebastian’s copy of the divorce decree on the coffee table and lifted her suitcase.  
  
The door clicked shut behind her—soft, yet final. A clean severance from seven years of devotion.  
  
On the way to the airport, the sun blazed overhead.  
  
Nora rolled down the window, closed her eyes, and breathed in the scent of freedom.  
  
Goodbye, Sebastian.  
  
This time, I’m choosing myself.Chapter 10  
  
""Ms. Kensington, was that man taking care of you these past few days your boyfriend? He seemed so devoted to you.""  
  
""No, Sebastian has always treated me this way.""

1mria27,https://i.redd.it/d5v7ywzrmajf1.png,I am about to publish my first side project!,"It's a budget/financial app - I know there are many of those out there but I thought I'd add my own spin and design to it. I started making it simple and just for myself first but the scope creep got to me and I ended up with a fully fledged app.



Before publishing I thought Id ask for some opinions and if people like it or would use it.

Core functionality, add an expense with one tap from home screen of app. I know people get lazy tracking expenses so I made it as easy as possible for a person to add an expense.

Other functionalities include setting up a date for your income, amount of your income and choose a currency, then at that date the income repeats (this part is also completely optional)

You can add and categorize expenses, keep track of them in groups (weeks, months, years)

Add additional income (one-time), for people who do gigs

Currency change, you can change your currency setup and it does the exchange with the latest info it can find on your main balance while keeping old transactions with the same currency you had.



Some other additional features include:

Exports of data (CSV/PDF)

Customizable widgets (for your home screen)

Automatic expenses (rent, insurace etc) that repeat

Savings tracker

Themes (Light mode, dark mode, other colors)

Month to month comparisons

Biometric / passcode lock



Im thinking of some of the less core features to be ""premium"", what are your thoughts on that?

The app has a very nice and clean UI design and the entirety of the data is stored locally.

I was just placing a cup of coffee on his desk, a small ritual in our five years of what I thought was a perfect marriage.



Then, an email notification flashed on his laptop: ""You're invited to the Christening of Leo Thomas."" Our last name. The sender: Hayden Cleveland, a social media influencer.



An icy dread settled in. It was an invitation for his son, a son I didn't know existed. I went to the church, hidden in the shadows, and saw him holding a baby, a little boy with his dark hair and eyes. Hayden Cleveland, the mother, leaned on his shoulder, a picture of domestic bliss.



They looked like a family. A perfect, happy family. My world crumbled. I remembered him refusing to have a baby with me, citing work pressure. All his business trips, the late nights-were they spent with them?



The lie was so easy for him. How could I have been so blind?



I called the Zurich Architectural Fellowship, a prestigious program I had deferred for him. ""I'd like to accept the fellowship,"" I said, my voice eerily calm. ""I can leave immediately.""





Chapter 1

The email notification slid onto Emilio's laptop screen, a sleek, minimalist pop-up from his calendar. My husband was in the shower, the sound of water drumming against glass a familiar rhythm to our mornings. I was just placing a cup of coffee on his desk, a small ritual in our five years of what I thought was a perfect marriage.



My eyes caught the words before I could look away.



""You're invited to the Christening of Leo Thomas.""



The name froze me. Leo Thomas. Our last name.



Before I could process it, the notification vanished. A flicker, and it was gone. Retracted. As if it had never been there.



But it was too late. The image was burned into my mind. The sender: Hayden Cleveland. The name was vaguely familiar, a social media influencer whose perfectly curated life sometimes crossed my feed. A beautiful woman with a massive following.



An unease, cold and sharp, settled in my stomach. It wasn't just a random email. It was an invitation for his son. A son I didn't know existed.



The address was a church downtown, the time set for that afternoon.



A part of me wanted to slam the laptop shut and pretend I'd seen nothing. To go back to the perfect illusion I had so carefully built with Emilio, the brilliant, charismatic tech CEO who loved me.



But another part, a colder, more insistent part, knew I had to go. I had to see.



I left the coffee on his desk and walked out of our pristine, minimalist home, the home I had designed as a monument to our love.



The church was old stone, sunlight filtering through stained-glass windows. I stood in the back, hidden in the shadows, my heart a heavy, painful drum against my ribs.



And then I saw him.



Emilio. My Emilio. He was standing near the front, not in one of his sharp business suits, but in soft, casual clothes. He looked relaxed, happy. He was holding a baby, a beautiful little boy wrapped in white lace.



A little boy with Emilio's dark hair and expressive eyes.



The child, Leo, blew a bubble and giggled, reaching a tiny hand up to touch Emilio's face.



""I hope he grows up to be just like you, Daddy,"" a woman's voice said, soft and proprietary.



Hayden Cleveland stepped into view, her arm sliding around Emilio's waist. She leaned her head on his shoulder, a picture of domestic bliss. Her smile was radiant, her eyes fixed on the man I called my husband.



They looked like a family. A perfect, happy family.



My mind went completely blank. A wave of numbness washed over me, so profound it felt like I was floating outside my own body. I watched as Emilio ki\*\*ed Hayden's forehead, then turned his attention back to the baby, murmuring something that made her laugh.



It was real. All of it. The woman, the baby. His secret life.



I saw a few familiar faces in the pews, business acquaintances of Emilio's, people who had been to our home for dinner parties. They smiled at the happy couple, oblivious to the wife standing in the shadows, her world crumbling around her.



I couldn't breathe. I couldn't bring myself to walk up there, to scream, to shatter their perfect moment. The fight went out of me, replaced by a deep, hollowing despair.



I turned and walked away, slipping out of the heavy church doors and back into the noise of the city. The sounds were muffled, distant. The world felt cold, and I was colder.



I remembered a conversation from a few months ago, on our anniversary.



""Emilio,"" I had said, my voice soft. ""I think I'm ready. Let's have a baby.""



He had gone silent. He'd looked away, running a hand through his hair. A gesture I always thought was him thinking, processing.



""Not yet, Elana,"" he had said, finally. ""The company is at a critical stage. Just give me another year. I want to be able to give our child everything.""



I had believed him. I had trusted the man who pursued me relentlessly in college, the only one who could see past my ambition to the woman underneath.



He was a rival back then, both of us at the top of our architecture program. He was brilliant, driven, and cold to everyone but me.



I remembered him bringing me hot soup when I pulled all-nighters in the studio, his hand gently rubbing my back as I hunched over blueprints.



I remembered when I got pneumonia, so sick I could barely stand. He stayed by my hospital bed for three days straight, not sl\*\*ping, just watching over me.



He proposed to me in that hospital room, his voice cracking with a vulnerability I'd never seen before.



""I can't lose you, Elana,"" he'd whispered, his forehead pressed against mine. ""I can't imagine my life without you.""



I found out later his mother had died in a hospital just like that one. His fear felt real, his love absolute.



We got married right after graduation. His tech startup exploded, and he became the man everyone wanted to be. I built my own career, but I always put him first. I changed my own five-year plan for him, for us.



And all this time, he had another family.



That love, that devotion I believed was reserved only for me, was a lie. A performance.



My phone buzzed in my pocket. It was him. I stared at his name on the screen, my hand trembling. I finally answered.



""Hey, where are you?"" His voice was warm, the same loving tone he always used with me.



In the background, I could hear the faint sound of a baby crying, then Hayden's voice soothing the child.



I stood across the street from the church, watching him through the open doors. He was holding his phone to his ear, smiling as he spoke to me.



""I'm just out for a walk,"" I managed to say, my own voice sounding foreign and brittle.



""I got held up at a last-minute meeting,"" he said smoothly. ""I'll be home soon. I miss you.""



The lie was so easy for him. It slid out, polished and perfect, just like everything else about him. A tear finally broke free and slid down my cheek, hot against my cold skin. All those business trips, the late nights at the office. How many of them were spent here, with them?



How could I have been so blind?



I swallowed the lump in my throat, forcing my voice to be steady. ""Emilio, I need to see you.""



He hesitated. I could see him shift his weight, his smile faltering for just a second. ""I'm still in the meeting, baby. Can it wait until I get home?""



""No.""



Just then, the little boy, Leo, toddled over and wrapped his arms around Emilio's leg.



""Daddy!"" the child squealed.



Emilio's eyes widened in panic. He quickly bent down, trying to shush the boy while keeping his voice low and calm for me. ""It's just... the kid of one of my colleagues.""



The phone went dead. He had hung up on me.



I watched as he scooped the boy into his arms, ki\*\*ing his cheek and whispering something that made the child giggle. He looked so natural, so at ease. Such a good father.



My heart felt like it had been scooped out, leaving nothing but a hollow, aching void. Years of my life, of my love, felt like a joke.



I pulled out my phone again, my fingers moving on their own. I didn't call Ayla, my best friend. I didn't call my lawyer.



I called the director of the Zurich Architectural Fellowship. A prestigious, six-month program I had been accepted to but deferred for Emilio. A program that required complete, uninterrupted focus. Total isolation.



""I'd like to accept the fellowship,"" I said, my voice eerily calm. ""I can leave immediately.""





Chapter 2

""The fellowship is still available, Elana. We'd be thrilled to have you."" The director's voice was warm on the other end of the line. ""But you understand the conditions? Six months, complete isolation. No outside contact.""



""I understand,"" I said. It was exactly what I needed. A place to disappear.



""We can have everything arranged for you,"" he promised. ""Just let us know your travel plans.""



""Thank you,"" I said, a flicker of something like hope cutting through the numbness. ""I'll see you in Zurich.""



I hung up and drove straight home. Our home.



The front door opened into a living room filled with symbols of our life together. A pair of matching coffee mugs on the counter. A framed photo of us on our wedding day on the mantelpiece, his arm wrapped tightly around me. A cashmere throw blanket he'd bought for me, draped over the sofa where we used to cuddle and watch movies.



A wave of revulsion washed over me.



I grabbed a ga\*\*age bag from the kitchen and started moving through the house like a storm. The mugs went in first, shattering at the bottom of the bag. The photo frame followed, the glass cracking. I tore every picture of us from its frame, ripped them into tiny pieces, and threw them in. The blanket, his clothes in my closet, the st\*\*id little trinkets he'd brought back from his ""business trips.""



Everything went into the bags. I dragged them to the curb, a cleansing fire of rage burning through me.



Then I started packing. My clothes, my books, my architectural models. Everything that was mine. I arranged for a shipping company to pick them up and deliver them to my old apartment, the one I had kept as a studio space.



Emilio didn't come home that night.



He walked in the next evening, looking tired but smiling. He dropped his briefcase and pulled me into an embrace, his arms wrapping around me like nothing was wrong.



""God, I missed you,"" he murmured into my hair, his lips brushing my temple.



My body went rigid. I could smell the faint, sweet scent of a different woman's perfume on his shirt. All I could picture was him holding that baby, ki\*\*ing Hayden Cleveland. Nausea rose in my throat.



I pushed myself out of his arms.



His smile faded, replaced by a look of concern. ""What's wrong, Elana? You feel cold.""



""I'm fine,"" I said, my voice flat.



""You're not fine,"" he insisted, his brow furrowed. ""Are you sick? Let's go to the doctor.""



The hypocrisy was suffocating. He could play the part of the concerned husband so perfectly, even after spending the night with his other family.



""I'm not sick,"" I said. ""I'm just tired.""



He didn't push it. Instead, he pulled a series of gift-wrapped boxes from his briefcase. ""I brought you presents. From my trip.""



He had even faked the evidence of a business trip. A silk scarf from a designer I hated. A bottle of perfume I would never wear. Each gift was a carefully constructed lie, a testament to the depth of his deception. The cost of these gifts could probably fund a small startup, but the thought behind them was worthless.



I wanted to scream, to throw the boxes in his face and demand to know how he could do this. But the words wouldn't come. I was trapped between the woman who still, somewhere deep down, loved the man he used to be, and the woman who was drowning in the truth of who he was now.



He noticed my silence, the redness in my eyes.



""What is it, Elana? Talk to me.""



I looked him straight in the eye, my voice hard. ""I want a baby, Emilio. I want one now.""



His face changed. A flicker of panic, then a mask of weary patience. ""We've talked about this. The timing is just not right.""



""It's never the right time for you,"" I shot back.



""The company just launched a new initiative. I'm under a lot of pressure."" The same excuse. Always the same.



""You don't think I'm under pressure?"" I insisted, my voice rising. ""I want a child, Emilio. With you.""



His phone rang, saving him. The caller ID was blank. He glanced at it, his expression turning serious.



""It's work,"" he said, already turning away. ""I have to go."" A lie. I knew it was a lie.



He ki\*\*ed my forehead, a gesture that now felt like a brand of his betrayal. ""I'll be back late. Don't wait up.""



I watched from the window as he got into his car and sped away, disappearing into the night.



I collapsed onto the sofa, the fight draining out of me, leaving only a bone-deep ache. He could have a child with her, but not with me. The thought was a physical blow.



My gaze fell on his second phone, the one he claimed was ""for international business,"" lying on the coffee table. He'd forgotten it in his haste. The screen lit up with a message.



From Hayden: ""Leo's fever is back. He keeps asking for his daddy.""



He hadn't even noticed I was different. That the house was half-empty. That his wife's heart was breaking.



A single tear rolled down my cheek, then another. The pain in my heart was so intense it was a physical sensation, but it was overshadowed by a sudden, violent cramp in my stomach.



I lurched forward, my hand flying to my mouth as I ran for the bathroom, retching into the toilet.



My body felt strange. This wasn't just heartbreak. A cold, terrifying thought began to form in my mind. A possibility that was both a miracle and a curse.



He didn't come home that night.



The next morning, I went to the hospital alone.



The doctor smiled, her eyes crinkling at the corners as she looked at the ultrasound screen.



""Congratulations, Mrs. Thomas,"" she said, her voice bright with a joy I couldn't feel. ""You're six weeks pr\*\*nant.""





Chapter 3

I walked out of the doctor's office in a daze, her cheerful words echoing in the sterile hallway. Pr\*\*nant. Six weeks. I placed a hand on my still-flat stomach, a tear slipping from the corner of my eye.



This tiny, innocent life. Why now? Why did it have to choose this moment to arrive, in the middle of this wreckage?



As I reached the end of the long corridor, a familiar silhouette made me freeze.



It was Emilio. He was standing near the elevators, his arm wrapped around Hayden Cleveland, who was sobbing into his ch\*\*t. He was murmuring words of comfort, his expression filled with a tender concern I hadn't seen directed at me in a long, long time.



I ducked behind a large potted plant, my heart pounding. I couldn't hear their words clearly, but his actions spoke volumes.



Then, Hayden's choked wh\*\*per carried down the hall. ""Do you think she suspects anything?""



""She trusts me,"" Emilio replied, his voice casual, dismissive. It was a careless statement that revealed everything about how little he thought of me, of my intelligence.



""But when will you make me your wife?"" Hayden pressed, her voice laced with a desperate ambition. ""When can you give me and Leo the life we deserve?""



""Hayden, stop,"" he cut her off, a hint of steel in his tone. ""Elana is my wife. That will not change.""



My breath caught in my throat.



""It's the least I can do,"" he continued, his voice softer now, tinged with what sounded like guilt. ""It's my penance for what I've done to her.""



Hayden fell silent, accepting his decision with a reluctant nod. He pulled her into another hug, ki\*\*ing her hair.



""You gave me a beautiful son, Hayden,"" he said, his voice thick with emotion. ""And I will always take care of you both.""



They walked towards the elevator, their arms around each other. As the doors were about to close, Hayden's eyes flickered in my direction. For a split second, her gaze met mine. There was no surprise in her eyes, only a flash of cold, triumphant victory.



She knew. She had known I was there the whole time.



I stepped out from behind the plant, my body trembling. The tears I'd been holding back streamed down my face, hot and unstoppable. The pain in my ch\*\*t was a physical weight, crushing me.



He didn't want to divorce me out of guilt, but he would never give up his other family. What did that make me? A placeholder? A symbol of a commitment he no longer felt but was too cowardly to break?



I remembered his promises, his vows. ""In sickness and in health, till death do us part."" He had said them with such conviction. I had believed him.



But he had betrayed me. And this love, this toxic, fractured thing, was something I had to cut out of my life.



Before I left the hospital, I walked back to the front desk and scheduled an appointment. An abortion.



Then I called my lawyer.



""Draw up the divorce papers,"" I said, my voice cold and steady. ""I want everything split down the middle. Everything I am entitled to.""



I was sitting in my car in the hospital parking lot when my phone rang. It was Emilio. His voice was hoarse, tired.



""Happy birthday, Elana.""



I had completely forgotten. In the chaos and the pain, my own birthday had slipped my mind.



""I'm so sorry about last night,"" he said, his voice laced with practiced regret. ""A crisis at the office. I didn't get home at all.""



A bitter laugh almost escaped my lips. ""Okay,"" I said, the two words feeling like dust in my mouth.



He seemed to relax on the other end, relieved by my lack of questions. ""I've arranged a gala for you tonight. To celebrate your birthday and the new wing you designed for the museum. To make it up to you.""



""Okay,"" I repeated, my voice a monotone.



A year ago, those words would have made me cry with happiness. Now, they were just another layer to his elaborate lie.



I didn't want to hear his voice anymore. I hung up the phone, my hand gripping a steering wheel.



I looked out the window, but I didn't see anything. I just felt a deep, chilling premonition. He had no idea what was coming. He felt a sense of unease, a feeling that something precious was slipping through his fingers, but he couldn't name it.



He had no idea it was already gone.





Chapter 4

When I got home, a team of stylists and makeup artists was waiting for me. Emilio had arranged everything. They fussed over me, transforming my grief-stricken face into a mask of polished elegance, dressing me in a gown of midnight blue silk.



At dusk, Emilio arrived, his own tuxedo perfectly tailored. His eyes lit up when he saw me, a look of genuine awe on his face.



""You look breathtaking, Elana.""



I just gave him a cool, detached glance and let him lead me to the car.



The gala was at the museum, in the very wing I had spent two years of my life designing. We walked in to a ripple of applause, our entrance met with smiles and envious glances.



""You're so lucky,"" a woman I knew whispered as we passed. ""To have a man who adores you so much.""



I used to revel in that envy. I used to feel a thrill of pride, knowing I had what every woman wanted. Tonight, I knew the beautiful surface was just a cover for the dark, rotting abyss beneath.



Emilio played his part perfectly, his hand possessively on the small of my back, his eyes full of a love that was a lie. He presented his gift, a heavy box from a famous jeweler. Inside was a diamond watch from a brand I had once told him I disliked.



He had forgotten. Or perhaps, he was remembering someone else's favorite.



""I don't..."" I started to say, but I was cut off as a small body collided with my legs.



I stumbled back, catching myself on a table.



""Daddy!"" a child's voice cried out.



My heart seized. It was Leo. He was clinging to Emilio's leg, his face buried in the expensive fabric of his trousers, sobbing.



""You're too close to my daddy!"" he wailed, pointing an accusing finger at me. ""Are you going to make him leave me and Mommy?""



The entire hall fell silent. Every eye was on us.



I wanted the ground to swallow me whole. The child looked so much like Emilio, the resemblance was undeniable.



Whispers erupted around the room. ""Is that... his son?"" ""Who is she, then?""



My carefully constructed world, the one I had fought so hard to maintain, was shattering in public, under the bright lights of my own celebration.



Emilio's face was a mask of controlled panic. He knelt, his voice patient. ""Whose little boy are you? Where are your parents?""



This only made the child cry harder.



Then, Hayden Cleveland pushed through the crowd, her face a picture of maternal distress. ""Oh, I am so, so sorry! Leo, honey, come to Mommy.""



She tried to pull the boy away, but he clung to Emilio, his little face a mess of tears and accusations.



I recognized her from the church, from the photos online. She was even more beautiful in person, her performance of the flustered, apologetic mother flawless. But I could see the calculation in her eyes.



""Daddy, don't let her take me away!"" Leo screamed, his voice echoing in the silent room. He glared at me, his eyes filled with a pure, childish hatred. ""It's her! She's the one trying to steal you from us!""



I was frozen, stunned into silence.



My eyes fell to the child's wrist. He was wearing a small string of sandalwood beads, a miniature version of the one I had spent a week on a pilgrimage to a remote temple to get for Emilio, for his protection, for his peace of mind.



He had given my gift to his son.



A surge of rage, hot and powerful, broke through my shock. I took a step forward, my hand outstretched, needing to see, to confirm. ""That bracelet...""



""Elana, don't!""



A powerful force slammed into my ch\*\*t. It was Emilio. He had shoved me, hard. His face was twisted in a panic I had never seen before, his eyes wild as he shielded his son.



My high heels caught on the plush carpet. I fell backwards, my body clumsy and out of control.



My head hit the sharp corner of a glass table with a sickening crack.



The world exploded in a shower of splintering glass and searing pain. Shards from a broken w\*\*e glass sliced into my arm. I gasped, the air knocked from my lungs.



I looked up, my vision blurring. Emilio wasn't looking at me. He was fussing over Leo, who had a tiny scratch on his knee.



""Are you okay, son? Did the bad woman hurt you?"" he murmured, his voice thick with concern. He scooped the boy into his arms and pushed through the crowd toward the exit, Hayden following closely behind.



She glanced back at me, a flicker of pure, triumphant malice in her eyes. It was a look that confirmed everything. This was all her plan.



Emilio left without a single look back. He left me bleeding on the floor of the room built to honor me.



The pain in my head and my arm was sharp, but a new, deeper, more terrifying cramp was seizing my abdomen.



The whispers around me grew louder, turning into a tide of judgment.



""Did you see that? She tried to grab the little boy.""



""She must be the other woman. How shameless, to cause a scene like this.""



""Emilio Thomas is such a good man, protecting his son like that.""



The words were a physical assault, each one a new wound.



The pain in my stomach intensified, a brutal, tearing sensation. I looked down. The midnight blue of my dress was stained with a spreading patch of dark, wet crimson.



My baby.



The last thread of my strength snapped. The room tilted, the lights blurring into streaks as the world faded to black.

Hey [r/Python](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/)!

I wanted to share something wild that happened today after work. My friend Allen needed a tool to create troubleshooting guides, so I decided to build him one. With Claude's help, I created a fully functional PyQt5 application in about 75 minutes of actual work time.

  **What my project does:**

  \- Creates interactive decision tree troubleshooting guides

  \- Organizes guides by product and problem category

  \- Includes 8 example guides (eg a Quantum Coffee Maker where coffee exists in multiple temperature states simultaneously)

  \- Dark theme with cyan accents

  \- Full test suite, documentation, and GitHub Actions CI/CD

Comparison:  (to normal development)

  **The crazy part:**

  \- Active development: \~45 minutes + 15 minutes requirements gathering

  \- Burger break: 30 minutes (left mid-development, AI held all context)

  \- Packaging for open source: 30 minutes

  \- Total: Under 2 hours from idea to published GitHub repo

  **Tech stack:**

  \- Python + PyQt5 for the GUI

  \- MVC architecture

  \- JSON-based storage format (.tsg files)

  \- 14 tests including edge cases

  **What I learned:**

The bottleneck in development isn't coding anymore—it's knowing what I wanted to build. The AI handled all the boilerplate, PyQt5 stuff, CSS styling, test writing, and fun lorem ipsum content. I mostly just had to direct it.

 This would've taken me 2-3 weeks in my free time solo.

  **The code is open source (MIT license):**

  \- GitHub: [https://github.com/vylasaven/treebleshooter](https://github.com/vylasaven/treebleshooter)

  \- One-line install: curl -sSL [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vylasaven/treebleshooter/main/run\_treebleshooter.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vylasaven/treebleshooter/main/run_treebleshooter.sh) | bash

  Target Audience\*\*:\*\*

\- Folks who will spread it around as a nice beginner python project with Claude, and assist their friends with learning to code with Claude

\- My friend Allen

  \- Contributors who want to add funny (or serious! actually useful ones would be nice) troubleshooting guide

  \-Contributors to porting / scaling / extending

The documentation includes a beginner developer guide and a ""prompting style guide"" showing how I worked with the AI.

I’ve always brushed it off, because he’s always claimed to be very anti capitalist and that money was nebulous at best to him. Right on.

But he’s come into huge amounts of money several times now and bragged excessively each time. Like at least once a hangout he reminds us that he’s got a 200k nest egg at 35 and no debt. Meanwhile he’s always also reminding us of how generous he is because: 

- he ‘splurged’ on Christmas gifts (a $25 pack of notebooks, we each got one)
- he made us dinner once (half a chicken breast and a table spoon of rice for everyone) 
- he shares his whiskey with us (half a shot each)
- he makes us coffee every other week (only he drinks it) 

I probably wouldn’t notice if he didn’t always bring it up, but today he got a $20k yearly raise and said as celebration we should take him out to dinner - and if he gets a side he’d share a bit with each of us. 

We’re all struggling to pay rent. We treat him all the time. When he comes over he has no problem asking for specific foods and alcohol. For birthdays and holidays he asks us for money. 

I don’t hate him and I’m glad he’s successful, but at some point I have trouble believing he really does see this as any kind of reciprocity. I think I’m just going to pull back until we drift. ",1,1755310425.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Chapter 1  
  
  
Gabriella's POV  
  
  
I was reborn to that crucial night when my step-uncle, Kayden Taylor, was drugged with an aphrodisiac.  
  
  
This time, instead of becoming his remedy, I called his true love, Charlotte Miller.  
  
  
In my previous life, I had fallen in love with Kayden - who became my uncle only by my mother's second marriage,not by blood.  
  
  
That fateful night, when someone had slipped him a powerful aphrodisiac at a charity gala, he desperately begged me to call his true love.  
  
  
Instead, I offered myself as his solution.  
  
  
One month later, I discovered I was pregnant.  
  
  
Kayden was pressured into marrying me, but on our wedding day, Charlotte - who had fled to Europe to escape her heartbreak - was taken by kidnappers who ultimately took her life.  
  
  
In her final hours, she called Kayden 199 times, pleading for help.  
  
  
But Kayden, trapped in our wedding ceremony, never saw a single call.

The day I went into labor, he locked me in the cellar of our New England estate. When I begged him to take me to the hospital, he watched with a cruel smile as I struggled for breath until darkness claimed me.  
  
  
His final words echoed in my ears: ""If you hadn't trapped me with that pregnancy, I wouldn't have been forced to marry you. I would have seen Charlotte's calls. You deserved this fate...""  
  
  
When I opened my eyes, I found myself back on that night when Kayden was drugged at the gala.  
  
  
When I heard those familiar words again - ""Gabriella, get Charlotte on the phone, now!"" - I suddenly snapped back to reality: I had been reborn.  
  
  
Without hesitation, I grabbed my phone and dialed Charlotte Miller.  
  
  
Kayden Taylor's face was flushed, his eyes glazed and intense when he looked at me. In my previous life, that same look had led me to make the fatal mistake that cost me everything.  
  
  
This time, I avoided his gaze and quickly left his room.  
  
  
""Hang in there, Kayden. Charlotte will be here in ten minutes!""  
  
  
As I closed the door, I heard Kayden muttering my name through gritted teeth. I pretended not to hear, shut the door firmly, and stood guard outside.  
  
  
Ten minutes later, Charlotte rushed in. She shot me a suspicious look, visibly relieved to see me fully dressed.  
  
  
Before opening the door, she threw me a glance. ""You can go now. We don't need you here.""  
  
  
I immediately headed upstairs to my room. The noises from downstairs didn't die down until well after midnight.  
  
  
I let out a heavy breath. In my previous life, my love for Kayden had led me to stay with him that night, resulting in my pregnancy. He married me under family pressure, but on our wedding day, Charlotte met a tragic end. After losing his true love, he silently bided his time until my due date, then locked me in the basement.  
  
  
Despite my desperate pleas to save our baby's life in exchange for mine, he watched coldly as both of us died - all to avenge his beloved Charlotte.  
  
  
This time, I did as he asked and brought Charlotte to him. Soon, I would leave this place and him behind forever.  
  
  
The next morning, Charlotte was sitting at the Taylor family breakfast table.  
  
  
Kayden took a bite of his eggs Benedict before casually announcing: ""Charlotte and I are together now. I'm going to marry her. Everyone better treat her right.""  
  
  
He gestured at me with his coffee mug: ""Especially you. Be nice to your future aunt. Don't start any drama.""  
  
  
I nodded numbly. Charlotte shot me a smug smile.  
  
  
Ignoring her, I started to leave before finishing breakfast.  
  
  
But then came Charlotte's tearful voice: ""Kayden, I don't think Gabriella wants me here. I know how special she is to you... maybe I should just go if she doesn't like me.""  
  
  
Charlotte's eyes welled up with tears, playing the perfect victim.  
  
  
Kayden's face darkened as he snapped at me: ""Gabriella, sit down and finish your breakfast.""  
  
  
""I'm done,"" I said quietly.  
  
  
His voice turned sharp. ""Gabriella, I said sit down! What part of that don't you understand?""  
  
  
""Where are your manners? Is this how you show respect after all these years?""  
  
  
Though I wanted no part in their drama this time around, they wouldn't let me walk away.  
  
  
I turned back with a polite smile: ""Kayden, Charlotte, bon appétit without me.""  
  
  
Half an hour later, a knock came at my door.  
  
  
When I opened it, I met Kayden's stormy glare.  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
  
Gabriella's POV  
  
  
I instinctively tried to close the door, wanting to avoid any confrontation.  
  
  
Kayden blocked it with his foot, his eyes narrowing. ""Why are you avoiding me?""  
  
  
He leaned closer, studying my face. ""You're upset about Charlotte, aren't you?""  
  
  
I quickly shook my head. ""Not at all. I'm happy for you both. You deserve each other.""  
  
  
Something flickered in his eyes - dissatisfaction, perhaps.  
  
  
""Really? Or is that sarcasm?"" He let out a harsh laugh. ""Come on, Gabriella. Don't tell me you're still not over me? That drunken kiss at your 18th birthday party - did you think I didn't know about that?""  
  
  
""All those love letters you've been hiding away - I've read every single one. You thought you were so subtle, but everyone in this house could see right through you. Your eyes gave you away every time.""  
  
  
""Not confessing was the smartest thing you've ever done. I would have laughed in your face.""  
  
  
""Laughed at how pathetic it was.""  
  
  
He strode past me to my desk, yanking open the bottom drawer. Grabbing a stack of letters, he scattered them across the floor, stepping on them deliberately.  
  
  
""I've raised you since you were seven, Gabriella. I've been like a father to you, and this is how you repay me? Harboring these sick feelings?""  
  
  
""You knew Charlotte was the only one for me, yet you still wrote these disgusting letters. You make me sick!""  
  
  
He leaned in close, whispering: ""That's why I came here - I saw how you looked at me yesterday when I was drugged. I know you wanted to 'help' me. Thank God you didn't. I would have been revolted for life. You're not worthy of touching me.""  
  
  
My heart clenched painfully. Even though I no longer loved him in this life, his cruel words still cut deep.  
  
  
After warning me to stay away from him and Charlotte, he slammed the door on his way out.  
  
  
Not wanting to face them anymore, I left to handle my overseas paperwork. I deliberately returned late, around 10 PM.  
  
  
The moment I entered my room, something felt off. My bed had been disturbed.  
  
  
Then I saw Charlotte's latest social media post - a selfie of her in bed with the caption: ""Nothing like a luxury mattress for the perfect night's sleep! I mentioned having trouble sleeping once, and he immediately replaced my mattress. This is what happens when a man truly loves you! ?""  
  
  
She'd taken my custom mattress - the $100,000 one Kayden had specially ordered when my back injury flared up earlier this year.  
  
  
He used to be kind to me too. He knew exactly what it meant to treat a young girl he'd raised with such affection, yet he'd encouraged my feelings. Now he stood on his moral high ground, condemning me for loving him inappropriately.  
  
  
And now, based on one casual comment from Charlotte, he'd given away my mattress without even telling me.  
  
  
Kayden appeared in my doorway, his voice casual. ""Charlotte's a light sleeper, so I gave her your mattress. Your back's fine now anyway - any mattress will do.""  
  
  
I didn't look up, just mumbled a quiet ""Mm-hmm.""  
  
  
His eyes narrowed. ""What's with this sudden maturity, Gabriella? You're acting strange. Aren't you usually furious when I'm nice to others? What are you plotting?""  
  
  
""I'm warning you - if you try anything against Charlotte, you'll regret it.""  
  
  
I finally looked up. ""I'm not plotting anything. I just want everyone to leave me alone.""  
  
  
""Isn't this what you always wanted, Kayden? For me to grow up? You should be happy now, shouldn't you?""  
  
  
He pressed his lips together, his voice dripping with sarcasm: ""Oh, so now you're Little Miss Perfect, aren't you? How wonderful.""  
  
  
He stormed out, slamming the door - his typical reaction when angry.  
  
  
But I had no interest in soothing his temper anymore.  
  
  
His anger meant nothing to me now. Soon, I would be gone.  
  
  
Chapter 3  
  
  
Gabriella's POV  
  
  
Life became simple after that. Charlotte spent her days flaunting their relationship on social media, while Kayden kept up his cold shoulder act. This time, I refused to play his game of making me chase his approval.  
  
  
A month later, Charlotte announced her pregnancy.  
  
  
Kayden was over the moon, eager to share their news with everyone. Wedding preparations quickly took over the Taylor mansion as they fast-tracked their ceremony.  
  
  
In this life, it was his beloved carrying his child, and I was determined to let them have their happiness.  
  
  
Once my paperwork cleared, I booked a one-way ticket to Italy - departing the day of their wedding.  
  
  
Kayden finally confronted me when Charlotte was out. He barged into my room, waving his phone like a weapon.  
  
  
""So, what's this I hear about you dipping into your trust fund? My lawyer tells me you're planning a little European adventure."" He smirked. ""Classic. Getting all 'Eat, Pray, Love' because you can't deal with my wedding?""  
  
  
My heart skipped, but his assumption helped ease my tension.  
  
  
Seeing my silence, his tone turned icy. ""Are you done with this attitude, Gabriella? A whole month of ghosting me - what, were you planning to keep this up forever if I didn't come to you?""  
  
  
""Ever since Charlotte moved in, you've been acting like we don't exist. She's the woman I love - if you actually cared about me, you'd make an effort with her too, not hide away like some teenager.""  
  
  
""You can't avoid us forever. What's your brilliant plan after we're married? Keep playing this avoidance game?""  
  
  
I shook my head. ""You've got it wrong, Kayden. I see you only as my guardian. Nothing more than gratitude.""  
  
  
He laughed mockingly. ""Gratitude? Come on, Gabriella. You're not fooling anyone - least of all yourself.""  
  
  
His eyes landed on my desk, lips curling. ""Look at this shrine of every gift I've given you, and you're really going to sit there and tell me you don't have feelings for me?""  
  
  
He walked over, picking up each item. ""Pack these away. I'm marrying Charlotte - time to drop the fantasy. Blood-related or not, it's never happening between us.""  
  
  
""Charlotte's pregnant now. Seeing these might stress her out, and I won't risk anything happening to my wife and baby.""  
  
  
I nodded, casually sweeping everything into a storage box. I'd planned to trash them before leaving anyway.  
  
  
Kayden's expression darkened at my indifference, grabbing my hand. ""Jesus, be careful! You just broke the rabbit charm on this hairpin!""  
  
  
I glanced at the rabbit hairpin - his first gift after my mom' death, when he, their closest friend, took me in. For years, I'd treated it like a precious jewel, not letting anyone near it.  
  
  
Now, watching me toss it carelessly into the box seemed to bother him more than me.  
  
  
""Really? This whole 'I'm totally over it' act? Who do you think you're kidding?"" He shook his head. ""You're so broken up about my wedding that you're literally fleeing the country, and here you are playing Miss Independent.""  
  
  
""Though maybe some time away isn't the worst idea - Charlotte's in a delicate state. Better you're not here making things weird.""  
  
  
He pulled out his phone, making a transfer. ""Here's $100,000. Go find yourself in Europe or whatever. Come back in a month when Charlotte's pregnancy is more stable.""  
  
  
His gaze lingered. ""Try not to pine too much while you're gone. You'll need to get used to me being a married man. Otherwise, it's going to be real awkward around here.""  
  
  
He rattled off some travel safety advice like I was still a kid, completely oblivious to the truth.  
  
  
He didn't know I'd been reborn.  
  
  
And this time, I was leaving for good.  
  
  
On Kayden's wedding day, while the Taylor mansion buzzed with preparation, I quietly slipped out the back door with my suitcase.  
  
  
As my Uber pulled away, I didn't look back.

Fermentation temperatures are carefully controlled to encourage the progress of these desirable esters while minimizing the production of unwanted off-flavors. The choice of yeast strain directly influences the beer's final character, contributing to its unique appeal.

**emphasis on Malt Character:** Malt provides the foundation for Old English beer styles, with a focus on showcasing the flavors and aromas derived from different types of malted barley.

Pale malts, crystal malts, and roasted malts are used in varying proportions to create a wide range of flavor profiles, from biscuity and nutty to caramel and chocolate.The malt bill (the recipe for malt) is carefully crafted to achieve the desired balance of sweetness, body, and complexity. The use of traditional floor-malted barley is increasingly recognized for the depth of flavor it adds to the beers.

2. A ""voucher"" system for customer that has an auto discount using customer's phone number or name. Example: customer buys a voucher for $20, that voucher is connected to the customer's phone number; a cup of coffee typically cost $4; since the customer has the voucher, and has a balance in it, the coffee now only costs $3, and is deducted to the balance.

1mrhjxj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1mrhjxj/28f_large_vent_this_sucks_so_bad/,(28F) Large vent. This sucks so bad.,"This is going to be long. I just hope I can find someone who can possibly relate...even a little.

On April 10, 2025, I found out my husband (28M) was cheating on me. Not only was he cheating on me, but it was with one of my best friends—double betrayal. I had recently had a miscarriage, too. The next day, I checked myself into a mental hospital and stayed for a week, and also found out I had Bipolar II, so that's fun. That also explains why I went into the deepest, darkest depression of my entire life afterward. I had to go on FMLA for a while, then just to PRN at work. I'm back to normal working now. But thankfully, I had some savings to live off of for a bit, and my mother and aunt helped the best they could, too. I could barely function, and if you know anything about depressive episodes in bipolar, you know how bad it can get. I mean, something like this would get someone with no underlying mental illness really depressed. 

  
We weren't doing great prior, but we had been going to individual therapy as well as couples therapy. We were fixing things, so I thought. I decided to stay with a friend and her husband in their spare bedroom for a month (which turned into much longer due to what happened) to help us. Also, instead of communicating with me, they both resorted to blocking me in any way I could possibly contact them after they knew I found out. Really mature, right? It's not a breakup... You can't just block me and never speak to me again? I mean, she can. But not him?

I reached out to my MIL, with whom I already had a strained relationship. She basically told me I deserved it, and then I decided to bring up the 10 Commandments since she acts like this huge ""Christian"" but really is just a bigot. She didn't like that, so I got blocked by her as well. Lovely, right? 

So one day in June, I decided to \*67 my husband's number when I knew she was at work. Much to my surprise, he answered it. He sounded surprised it was me, but he was actually very kind to me (aka kissing my ass), and we had a long conversation. He told me that ""it just happened,"" which, whatever. Having sex with another person who is not your wife does not ""just happen."" He told me they have been in love for a long time, but they were terrified I'd find out. 🙄 It's unclear when the affair actually started, but it seemed about a month prior, after speaking with my former best friend's roommate, who had some proof and was nice enough to show me. 

She found out we spoke, and was furious. A few days later, I got a very nasty, hateful email from him that was very obviously typed by her pretending to be him, telling me I am ""stalking and harassing them"" and they were going to take legal action. Huh? Okay sweetie. I just want a divorce, and then I will stay out of your lives forever. That is not harassment nor stalking. I did nothing even close to those things. I suppose she is really insecure and doesn't trust her boyfriend. Wonder why that is?!

My cousin, who is rather intimidating, talked to my husband. Suddenly, a week later, guess who reaches out to me? Yup. The husband. He said he wanted things to be amicable. Guess the talk with my cousin worked. We ended up talking on the phone for nearly three hours, and he told me he was going to pay for all of it since this was his doing. We decided to meet up at this coffee shop in town later that week (which was funny, since our first date was also at a coffee shop). I acted very cold and distant toward him, because seeing him in person for the first time since everything happened hurt like a bitch. He noticed my new glasses and that I had slightly changed my hair, which surprised me. He is the most unobservant person I've ever met. 

He was acting like himself for the most part. Eventually, I warmed up slightly, but still made it clear I was not happy. He started to get emotional, which is what really shocked me. I didn't think he cared at all, really. And for a slight moment, it was like he almost considered not doing any of this, but he quickly changed his mind. That's probably for the best. If we got back together, which, as much as I love him, I don't think I could ever trust him again. So what good does that do? What's done is done. He doesn't believe in people getting back together anyway. 

After everything was said and done, we hugged for a very long time, and we both cried before we parted. I stupidly and impulsively said, ""I'll always love you,"" and he said, ""You, too. I mean it."" He had bought me lunch and a video game he thought I'd like (and I did!). I guess I got my closure, so since then, I've been loads better. We've chatted here and there since then, and that was about 2-3 weeks ago, but on Wednesday, I told him that I don't think I can be friends with him, especially given who he's with now. I said I no longer hate him, and we are considered ""on good terms"" in my book. It hurts too much to talk to him, and although part of me wanted to desperately hang onto whatever I could have left, I knew it was best that I let go. My therapist was quite proud :)

I know for a fact he’s feeling bad now, but not bad enough to end things with her. I don't believe he loved me; I think he just doesn’t like being single. I’ve known him for literally half of my life, and we had been together since COVID. And I’ve never known him to be single for more than, like, a month. I should've known better. I just... didn't know he was a cheater.

Once he found out there was an opportunity with her because he was tired of me, he took it. As much as I hate to say it, they’re perfect for each other. They are both pretty pretentious, book-smart, and share similar tastes in music, as well as a love for philosophy and math. I dunno, I guess that’s why I always feared them being too close when we were all three friends. 

And you know what? I wish him the best, always. But he took a piece of my heart that will never come back. And I don’t know if I’ll ever NOT be a little sad about this. I know it’s so easy to say you’re ""so done dating"" after a breakup, but this is not just a breakup. This is a fucking divorce, and it was my longest relationship. But no, I really am done with dating from here on out. What’s the fucking point anymore? I can’t be with someone while I still love him, and that’s the thing—I will always love him. Sure, I have a few people interested in me, and I could meet new people. But they just aren’t the same. I don’t get the same feeling that I did with him. I feel like I've already had the “love of my life” with the years I spent with him. I'm thankful for our time together.

But hey, I'm going to law school next year, pursuing my lifelong dream of being an attorney. I'm only applying to schools that are quite far away. I need out of my hometown and home state, anyway. I have lots to look forward to. Life isn't all about relationships and romance; I can find other things to do with my life. I will make friends in law school. A lot of attorneys are single or become that way anyway, it seems. So I won't stick out like a sore thumb being nearly 30 and single, like I do in this Hicktown, Alabama.

Thank you if you read all this; it means a lot. Just getting this off my chest helped me. I tried going to a divorce Zoom group, and it was mostly older women. They invalidated me because I wasn’t married THAT long, we don’t have kids, etc., but they don’t get to tell me how to feel. It may not seem like a big deal to them, but it meant everything to me. All the in-person divorce groups locally are faith-based, and I'm agnostic, so I'm not interested. So I guess I'm saying, if you're around my age, or maybe have been through something similar, and even if you haven't, please reach out. I feel so alone. I don't have many friends, and most of the ones I do have are happily married and/or just can't relate.",4,1755309685.0,Divorce,1,1.0,False

Wanted to share my latest side project journey, which literally started while chilling by a hotel pool in Thailand. It's called **Thai Price Translator**.

# The Problem I Saw:

I was on a trip with my parents, and they kept getting confused by foreign prices. ""How much is 65 baht in our currency?"" ""Is 129 baht for a meal expensive?"" Standard currency converters were too complex for them – they just wanted to quickly grasp the *value* of things relative to what they know back home. This highlighted a clear, subconscious need for travelers.

# My Side Project: Thai Price Translator

Instead of a full-blown currency converter, I built something super simple: an app that converts Thai Baht to Chinese Yuan, but with a twist. After the conversion, it adds a contextual note, like ""about the price of a cup of coffee back home"" or ""the same as a bottle of Coke."" This instantly makes the price relatable and helps with purchasing decisions.

# The ""How"" (The Vibe Coding Part):

As a product manager with limited coding skills, I used an AI coding assistant (WindSurf & CodeBuddy) to quickly prototype this. I literally spent afternoons by the hotel pool, refining this little tool. It took about 30 minutes to get the core prototype working. It was pure ""vibe coding"" – building something small and focused to solve a real, observed problem.

# Early Validation & Unexpected Traction:

I initially built it just for my parents, but decided to share a demo on Xiaohongshu (a popular Chinese social media platform). The response was insane:

* **220,000+ views** in less than 48 hours!
* It was featured on the homepage of **Sspai (少数派, Like ""TNW"" of China version)**, a well-known tech/productivity website in China.
* Just yesterday, it crossed **500+ total downloads** across App Store and Google Play.
* And the most surprising part: I've already sold **50+ lifetime memberships**!

This project really reinforced my belief that products aren't just about piling on features; they're about deeply understanding a specific scenario and a user's subconscious needs. Sometimes, the simplest solution to a niche problem can gain unexpected traction.

# What's Next?

Chinese users are clearly very interested in this humble little app, and I'm curious to know if people from other countries and regions share that same feeling – that sense of discomfort with foreign currency values when traveling abroad – making them feel they also need an app like this?

1mrhhe2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1mrhhe2/missing_limbs_part_1/,Missing limbs (Part 1),"I’ve worked as a detective for years, years. I’ve never come across anything I couldn’t solve. I figured out who killed Peterson's cat, it was their neighbor who had an obsession with swords. I solved the mystery of where that missing girl went, she ran away from home because her father said she couldn’t date a drug dealer. I even figured out who was spray painting the garbage cans on maple street, it was the crackhead who asked for change on the corner. So when I say I have solved every case I mean it with a heavy sense of sarcasm. Never in my entire career have I had a real missing persons case, and when I say real missing persons case I mean real. So when I walked into work this morning with Chief Morrison waiting at my desk I was surprised when he handed me a small piece of paper with a name and the words “missing limbs??” next to it, I was shocked to say the least.

“Head on over to Jameson Memorial Hospital, a gal' there says that she woke up without a hand.” The chief grunted. 

I nodded silently as I sipped my coffee cup. “Sounds like a nutcase but, still go check it out. The hospital says it's as if the hand was never there to begin with.”

I shook my head and left without a word. Walking back out to my car I removed my holster from my waistband and set it on my passenger seat. Setting my car in drive I looked at the little hand written note again. Julia Demico.

I walked into the hospital and held up the note to the front desk lady who was on the phone, she mouthed the words “room 4” and I quickly walked over to the door. I knocked and entered the room as the door squeaked. I looked at the woman who sat alone in the bed, clutching her left hand with dried tear stains running down her face. When she looked at me her eyes strained as if she didn’t recognize me.

“Ma’am, I am detective Fredrick with the VPD. I understand you were attacked last night?” I said as I pulled a small hospital chair next to her in the bed.

She nodded but brought her gaze back to the stump where her hand was. The cut was non existent, it looked as if she had simply been born with no left hand. 

“Julia, if you could just try to walk me through what happened, we can hopefully get to the bottom of this,” I said, trying to reassure her. I pulled out a small tape recorder and clicked the record on it.“Do you mind?” I asked

“No, that's fine, It was last night,” She said wiping tears off her cheeks, “late, probably around 10PM, when I’m usually in bed. I just had dinner, some wine, and was winding down for some sleep. The second I got into bed I felt dizzy, like the kind when you drink too much, but I only had a glass.”

I shook my head in understanding as she continued. 

“I was out in seconds as I laid down, right after that dizziness. I had a dream, it was dark, I was in my bed but I couldn't move. Like sleep paralysis. I looked around and saw my hand hanging off the bed. I blinked and then it was gone. I couldn't move at all, but when I finally woke up I just-,”  Her own sobs stopped her story. 

I reached out a hand to her leg, trying to comfort her.

 “Julia, it's ok, I need to ask you some more questions to make sure I understand.""

”I’m sorry, I just don’t understand. Why, why would someone do this?” She exclaimed in a frustrated whirlwind of sobs.

“May I please look at your wound?” I asked motioning to the spot her left hand used to be. 

She raised the stump to me as I examined it. It was smooth with no  damage whatsoever to the stump. The stump ended right where her wrist would meet with her hand. The skin felt soft, as though it was a newborn, like it had been freshly laid. I looked all over her stump and even down her arm as she quietly sobbed next to me. No signs of anything, no needle marks, no bruises or even scars. Her arm was completely untouched, all it needed was a hand for it to be complete.

The rest of the questioning was pretty standard. She had no enemies, no creepy ex boyfriend, and no family to speak of. 

I left that hospital with more questions than answers. Back at the station everyone was shocked and could hardly believe my story. I didn’t know who or what could have done this, but it was now my mission to find out. I set out for Julia’s apartment that night, sending the boys in blue to canvas the place before I got there. Hopefully, there would be more answers there.

It felt… fluffy. Like, *“Sure, writing in a notebook is going to magically fix my crushing fatigue.”*

But here’s the thing: once I started looking into the nervous system side of recovery, it clicked. Gratitude and journaling aren’t about pretending life is perfect — they’re about training your brain and body to live in a different internal environment. And that matters more than most people realize.

# Why Gratitude Works on a Biological Level

When you’re stuck in chronic illness, your brain develops a bias toward threat and discomfort. It’s survival mode — always scanning for what’s wrong.  
Writing down three things you’re grateful for every day literally starts rewiring your brain to notice safety, beauty, and possibility again.

And here’s the kicker: your body responds to those signals. Gratitude reduces stress hormones, increases serotonin and dopamine, and helps shift you into parasympathetic “rest and repair” mode — the exact state your body needs to heal.

# Journaling as a Release Valve

ME/CFS can leave you with a backlog of frustration, grief, and unspoken fears. If you don’t have a place to put those, they stay in your system — and your body will carry them like extra weight.

Journaling gives your mind permission to *dump it all out* without judgment.  
It’s not about writing something “inspirational” — it’s about clearing mental clutter so your body isn’t living in that stress soup 24/7.

# How to Make It Work Without Forcing It

* Keep it short — 5 minutes is enough.
* Mix gratitude and honesty. You can write “I’m grateful for my dog” right next to “I’m exhausted today and that’s okay.”
* Do it at the same time each day to make it a gentle ritual — morning coffee, before bed, or during a calm moment.

# Why This Isn’t Just a Mental Exercise

When you combine gratitude (shifting toward safety and joy) with journaling (releasing the heavy stuff), you’re sending your nervous system one clear message: *“We are safe enough to heal now.”*  
That’s not fluff. That’s biology.

If you’ve been stuck in the loop of scanning for symptoms and waiting for the other shoe to drop, this is one of the simplest ways to start turning that loop in your favor.

And you don’t have to believe in it 100% to start — just try it for a week and see if your inner world feels even 5% lighter. Sometimes that’s the crack where the light gets in.",1,1755308764.0,HealedFromCFS,0,1.0,False

I remember when whatever you did feel for me started to dissolve.

Not opening my messages,
Not replying,
Things you said didnt add up,
The way you couldn't look me in the eyes that day,

Was it that day that you knew? When you couldn't look me in the eyes? Why? Because of your guilt? Because you loved him? Felt for him? Or just didnt feel anything for me anymore? 

Or was it much before then?  And thats just when you felt guilt then? 

How you could ask me with such ease to help you, help pay rent so that you and your girls wherent homeless? You didnt know anyone except me or the guy you just fled from with a plan? A new plan with him?  But if thats the case why ask me for help? Why let me help? Let me come see you more than ever? Let me meet them???     When I found your new account..   I actually believed your reassurances, I believed you. All I asked for was better communication and what I got was, lies? Deception? Half truths?

And then it got more and more obvious, and I believed every excuse you had for an red flag i questioned your about? Even though when I look back i can't believe how obvious they where.. I was such a fucking idiot.   Blinded by my heart, my hope and my love. 

Yes, I'll finally say it, I loved you.  You where my rebound but I had fallen so fucking hard for you. And more and more each time I sae you and especially with them.    Because you would smile when they where at ease or happy momentarily. And every single time I saw you happy, I fell in love with you, and them.   

Do you remember our last walk? our last talk in person? Our last hug?    That hug broke me.   It was like a last nail in a coffin.

I often think back about all the mistakes I made and some of the ones I knew I was making but did knowingly.    I know I gave you too much attention, makes it harder for you to desire me but I also wanted you to know not only how much I felt every single morning, but also atleast I wanted you to know that feeling from someone, someone who wasnt a dickhead that said brining you coffee in bed was gay.  

How much changed after we had to take a trip to the clinic? Fuck, was that even mine? Or was I just a ride? It was possible that it was me, but when you became a lier, it changed everything. I questioned and still question not just when the lying started but if you where ever even honest with me? 

I came to peace with the fact life happens, it didnt work out, we didnt work out, i cpuldnt save you, but I hoped for you, a new hope, a new life, I hoped my pain wasnt for not,    and ill never know how much my pain ever mattered? 

One big thing that bring me peace is that maybe,  my purpose was to be what you needed while you needed someone.   

I know you still suffer, alot. And you're hurt, again.  Maybe some of this isnt as one sided this time and your better now, learn from the pain your in, build with it and not suffer under it all. 

Im not sure if we will meet again, I said I would and that I I didnt care but maybe how I said it seemed judgmental?    I wont text again and ask again, if you want to see him, see me, you know how to reach me. ",0,1755308695.0,Unsent_Unread_Unheard,3,0.5,False

Stop targeting Kathleen Davis now. She even gave you her child—what more do you want?""""Be reasonable. If you could bear children, would I have sought another woman?""""The Perez bloodline's hung by a thread for seven generations. Raise mine and Kathleen's child well while I accompany her abroad. I'll make it up with a wedding when we return.""I answered calmly, ""Fine.""Then contacted a slum couple in Africa: ""Heard you want to adopt?""Just then, a message flashed: ""Elizabeth Harris, marry me or I'll die.""My cold gaze swept the empty house as I replied, ""I will.""The other party called excitedly, ""I'll pick you up!""Three years later, due to company expansion, I returned to San Francisco with my child.Yet at the airport, I unexpectedly ran into Gary and Kathleen, who had just arrived from abroad.Gary shoved his suitcase toward me as if it were natural. ""At least you've got some sense. How'd you know Kathleen and I were returning today?""Before I could respond, he frowned impatiently. ""Why have your messages been so incomplete these years? But asking for living expenses? Always straight to the point!""I raised an eyebrow. When I left back then, I'd casually tossed my phone to a homeless person on the street. Who knew who'd been replying to him?I couldn't be bothered to engage and threw his suitcase back.""You've got the wrong person.""I turned to leave, but then Kathleen saw the child sleeping in the stroller and rushed over in tears.""Son, Mommy's back. It's all my fault that I met your dad too late, so I couldn't be by your side legitimately.""Then, she ignored my attempts to stop her and forcibly picked up the child.The child, who inherited his biological father's grumpiness upon waking, immediately burst into loud wails.Struggling wildly, his little feet kicked Kathleen in the face.Crying and calling out ""Mommy"" to me, Kathleen's eyes flashed with panic and jealousy.I hurried over to take the child back and was about to explain, ""He's not your chi...""But Kathleen took a step back, crying like a rain-drenched blossom, ""Elizabeth, you clearly promised me that you would take good care of my child. Why is he so thin and small at three years old?""She then said to the child in her arms, ""It's all mommy's fault. I haven't been with you for three years, never knew you suffered so much!""I was so exasperated I nearly rolled my eyes. Just as I opened my mouth to say, ""You've misunderstood, he's only two—""A stinging slap landed across my face. I stared at Gary in disbelief.His face twisted with rage. ""Elizabeth, I never imagined you'd be this vicious! You promised back then, yet for three years you've abused my child with Kathleen!""""I've sent you nearly a million in living expenses over three years, and you couldn't even spare proper food for him?""""Look how thin and dark he's become under your cruelty! This is the sole heir of the Perez family!""A crowd had gathered around us unnoticed, all rolling their eyes and whispering behind their hands.Even people held up their phones live-streaming, shouting, ""Come quick, everyone! An evil nanny got caught red-handed abusing a rich family's child!""Frowning, I watched the still-crying child, my heart aching as I snatched him back from Kathleen.Chapter 2Busy comforting the child, I had no time to explain to the crowd. Suddenly, Kathleen screamed, ""Elizabeth, how could you use a Herbal Sleep Pillow for the baby? Don’t you know I’m allergic to it?""""No wonder he’s so frail! He’s allergic just like me. Elizabeth, didn’t you notice at all?""""That poor little thing couldn’t speak, suffering silently for three years... After all, he’s not her biological—""Then she knelt before me, putting on a show of motherly devotion. ""Please give my son back! He’s the child I struggled so hard to bring into this world!""I thought bitterly about how that newborn had been dumped at the doorstep like unwanted goods, still slick with birth fluids.Gary and Kathleen flaunted their honeymoon abroad on social media without sparing my dignity, their public displays turning me into the circle's laughingstock.Had I not heard those wails, that infant would've frozen to death outside.You couldn't bother feeding your own child back then, yet now you playact devoted parents?My expression hardened as I placed the baby back in the stroller.Gary snapped, ""Elizabeth, give Kathleen her child! You can't even handle childcare properly—you're unfit to be Mrs. Perez!""I smirked, ""Who cares? I've remarried already!""""Kathleen holds a Harvard master's degree. She's more qualified than you to lead the Perez group. If not for my consideration...""Gary was chattering away when he finally registered my words, stammering: ""What did you say?""Kathleen stood nearby, offering understanding: ""Elizabeth, how could you say such hurtful things? I never meant to compete with you. I'd be content just staying by Gary and the child.""Gary movedly grasped Kathleen's hand. ""You've always been thoughtful.""Then he looked me up and down, sneering: ""Every single luxury item on you—which one wasn't bought with my money? And you talk about remarrying?""""Who else could give you this lavish lifestyle?""""Elizabeth, the Perez group isn't what it used to be. If you want to keep living like this, you'd better treat Kathleen with respect!""""From now on, Kathleen will move in to bond with the child.""""Since you can't raise them properly, let their real mother do it!""A glint of triumph flashed in Kathleen's eyes as she looked at me. I couldn't be bothered with them and looked down at the message from Dylan Baker: ""Sweetheart, I've got one more business deal to wrap up in Europe. Thanks for taking care of the kids these days. I'll make it up to you when I get back!""Then, eighty million dollars was deposited into my bank account.""Take yourself out for afternoon tea, my love.""After that, he sent a 'praise me' emoji.The frustration in my chest instantly melted away. I typed with a smile: ""Focus on your work. I'll be waiting for you.""But then, as soon as I looked up, I saw Kathleen feeding chocolate to the child.""Come on, son, try this chocolate Mommy brought back from abroad. Tell me if it's good.""I dashed over and knocked the chocolate out of her hand, my face flushed with anger. ""He can't eat chocolate.""Suddenly, Kathleen threw herself backward and screamed, ""Ah! Gary, help me!""Gary pushed me away to help Kathleen.I lost my balance and fell to the ground.The curses around grew louder, ""How can there be such a wicked nanny who won’t even let the birth mother hold her child!""""She’s clearly rotten to the core! Can’t you see she’s dressed more lavishly than the mistress? Probably embezzled loads from her employer over the years!""Chapter 3""...""A bratty kid actually poured coffee on me, ""Beat the bad lady!""My phone got knocked away during the scuffle, and that brat picked it up to smash it playfully.My expression darkened. I’d rushed back this time without bodyguards, never expecting this chaos.I said firmly to the crowd, ""I’m not the nanny. This is my child with my current husband.""But the accusations kept drowning out my explanations.I struggled to stand up, trying to leave with my child first.Unexpectedly, someone pinned me to the ground.Gary's leather shoes appeared before me as he looked down condescendingly. ""Apologize to Kathleen.""I fought violently, only to be slapped by Gary. ""Elizabeth, Kathleen is carrying my child. She's the hero of our Perez family.""""Keeping you as Mrs. Perez is already giving you enough respect. If you dare bully Kathleen using your position as my wife, everything you have can be taken away anytime.""For some reason, my mind flashed back to that night three years ago—when I'd eagerly waited for Gary's return, only to learn about his child with Kathleen.Gary had promised me before leaving home that what happened with Kathleen was just a slip-up. He'd cut ties with her and come back to our family.My heart was already shattered, but I gave him another chance only because his mother once saved my life.Yet I never imagined Gary would abandon our infant to me—treating me like a nanny—just to accompany Kathleen abroad for her studies.The thought fueled my rage, and I struggled fiercely against his grip.Then Kathleen hypocritically helped me up. ""Gary, let Elizabeth go. I don't blame her.""She smugly rubbed her belly. ""After all, I've been hired by the Baker group. When things get busy, I'll still need big sister's help at home.""My eyes darkened. ""Which Baker group?""Seeing me ask this, Kathleen grew even more smug. ""Elizabeth, have you seriously lost your edge after all these years raising kids? Look around San Francisco—is there any other Baker group?""""My direct boss is Dylan, the wealthiest man in New York.""""Later, I'll just coax my boss a little, and he'll hand over billion-dollar contracts to the Perezes. Gary's company will definitely thrive.""Gary held Kathleen in a doting embrace and kissed her. ""Kathleen's our little hero!""He then looked at me scornfully. ""Hear that? Demand an apology from Kathleen now?""I curled my lips and stated flat-out, ""She'll never get into the Baker group.""Back then, Dylan nearly blew these scumbags away. If I hadn't felt indebted to the Perezes and stopped him desperately, the Perez group would've been crushed by Dylan ages ago.Still your boss?How could Dylan allow someone who hurt me into the Baker group?Their faces paled. Kathleen protested indignantly, ""How dare you say that?""I cast a cool glance at them. ""Because I'm Dylan's wife.""Before I finished, Gary ordered bodyguards to drag me out of the airport and shove me into a car. ""You're my woman. Who said you could fantasize about another man?""""Seems I've been too lenient with you!""I was hauled back to the Perez manor and forced to kneel before the cemetery.Gary pulled out a thorned whip and savagely struck me.""Years ago, my mother saved you. She pitied your suffering and made me marry you into the Perez family.""""Have I ever mistreated you? I only got involved with Kathleen to continue the Perez bloodline. Yet you dare defy wifely duties, claiming to be another man's wife?""Chapter 4""Do you even see me as your husband!""My eyes reddened. He'd pursued me relentlessly for three years before I accepted him. I poured my entire inheritance into the Perez group.I never forgot the family's kindness—after marriage, I devoted myself to homemaking, becoming his steadfast support.Even knowing I struggled with fertility, he vowed to have only me for life.Yet he broke that oath. Now he forced divorce to marry Kathleen, just to get a spouse visa for her studies abroad!The wounds on my back burned, but I stared defiantly at Gary. ""We're already divorced.""Gary froze, confusion flickering in his eyes before his expression softened. ""Just a paper divorce. We'll remarry after the wedding ceremony.""Kathleen's face twisted with resentment beside them. She suddenly scooped up the child, voice dripping with false sorrow, ""Gary, perhaps I shouldn't live with you anymore. I wouldn't want to affect your marriage with Elizabeth.""Seeing me being bullied, the child bit hard into Kathleen's arm.Kathleen screamed in pain and actually flung the child away.I dashed desperately but couldn't reach in time. The child hit the ground, sobbing in pain.I gathered the child into my arms, guilt pouring down my cheeks in heavy tears. ""Baby, where does it hurt? Tell Mommy.""Gary carefully examined Kathleen's hand before grabbing the child by the collar in fury. ""What have you taught this child? How dare he bite! As his father, I'll discipline him properly today!""""Someone! Tie him to the pillar outside! He stays there until he learns who his real mother is!""My pupils froze. ""Gary, you can't do this to my child!""""It's snowing outside, they'll freeze!""Gary dragged me into the cubicle and ripped open my clothes.Rage filled his eyes. ""I haven't been exercising my husbandly rights enough, letting you run wild!""He immediately started gnawing at my chest.I slapped him across the face, eyes red. ""Gary, you'll regret this!""Gary wiped his mouth and bellowed, ""Regret?""""Once Kathleen joins the Baker group and I partner with Dylan, the Perez group will rise to the next tier overnight. Serve me properly now, or you'll be the one regretting it!""I gritted my teeth. ""That's Dylan's child! Treat us like this, and he'll destroy you!""Gary tore my pants apart in a rage, like a mad wolf, ""You're truly insane, still spouting nonsense! If I don't discipline you properly, you'll dare openly harm Kathleen next!""He was about to strike when a scream and child's wail echoed outside.Gary immediately zipped up and rushed out to investigate.""Gary, I just wanted the child to call me mom. He kicked my belly, so I accidentally hit him once.""I charged over hysterically, saw the child's swollen red cheek, and swung a brick at Kathleen's head, ""Touch my child? I'll end you!""Gary instantly kicked my stomach and frantically held Kathleen, ""Kathleen, are you hurt?""Kathleen clutched her stomach, whispering weakly: ""Gary, I'm in so much pain. Are the baby and I going to die?""""Maybe death would be better. Then I wouldn't have to hide while following you anymore. Gary, promise you'll care for my child after I'm gone... even if they never accept me as their real mother...""Chapter 5Gary went wild, holding Kathleen tightly. ""I won't let anything happen to you! The private doctor's coming!""He then turned and looked at me like I was already dead, his voice cruel. ""You dared teach our child to hurt Kathleen.""His eyes swept over our child wailing nonstop while tied to the pillar. My heart plummeted.His voice was icy cold. ""Bring the whip soaked in salt water!""I rushed over in panic and grabbed Gary's arm. ""Gary! Don't do this to my child! Whatever you want, do it to me!""With just one look from him, bodyguards pinned me down.""Crack—""The child's screams nearly shattered my eardrums. Breaking free from the bodyguards, I clung to Gary's leg and begged: ""No! Don't hit him! I'm sorry, it's all my fault! Please don't hit him!""Gary kicked me away and struck again with the whip. He pressed the child's head coldly: ""Say it. Who's your real mother?""The child convulsed in pain, yet still turned tear-filled eyes to me and whimpered ""Mom"" in utter misery.My heart shattered into countless pieces as I knelt before Gary, banging my head against the ground.""Please, spare the child! I'll do anything you ask!""Gary pointed at Kathleen playing dead beside him. ""You disfigured Kathleen. Should I teach you how to make this right?""Immediately I grabbed a brick and slammed it against my own head—once, twice, again and again.Time blurred until blood covered my eyes, darkness flickering across my vision. As I fainted, Gary's coaxing voice reached Kathleen: ""Kathleen, feeling better now?""""Not yet. Let's feed him to the wolves in the back mountains, yeah?""Waking in the chill, I heard the child whimpering beside me, breaths growing shallower.And wolves surrounded us all around!I held the child and ran desperately, but was still surrounded by the wolves.Just as the wolves lunged at us, I pressed the child tightly against my chest and closed my eyes in despair...And at that moment, the roar of countless helicopters filled the sky above the Perez manor.A week later, Kathleen in a fitted business suit stood before Gary, twirling around, ""Gary, how do I look in this outfit?""""For a company like the Baker group, should I dress more elegantly?""But Gary was somewhat distracted; somehow, the image of Elizabeth's red eyes when she was thrown into the mountains always flashed through his mind.Every time he thought about it, his heart ached uncontrollably.In fact, he had missed Elizabeth terribly these past three years.He hadn't returned for three years because of Kathleen, so Elizabeth was naturally upset. He really shouldn't have treated her like that right after coming back.Gary immediately decided to cancel the punishment. Even though he'd sent people to protect the mother and child, there were wolves in the back mountains—too dangerous.When Elizabeth returned, he'd remarry her immediately and hold a proper wedding.That way, Elizabeth probably wouldn't sulk at him anymore, he thought.Yet Kathleen kept chattering beside him. Gary frowned impatiently, ""He's your own son! Aren't you worried at all? Still fussing over what to wear?""Kathleen froze, about to explain, when the assistant rushed in. ""President, Madam sent a child to Africa for adoption three years ago...""The door was suddenly kicked open, and a crowd flooded in.The leader had snake-like eyes but wore a smirk, staring at Gary as if looking at a corpse. Gary’s eyes widened instantly.A dark gun muzzle pressed against Gary’s forehead. ""Where are my wife and son?""Next Chapter

1mrh3vs,https://www.reddit.com/r/FunctionalMedicine/comments/1mrh3vs/advice_needed/,Advice Needed 🙏🏻,"Hi Everyone -

Been dealing with some weird symptoms for years now and just don’t know how to pinpoint what’s going on. Been basically going in circles, researching each symptoms to try and connect the dots, but what I have going on is so odd I’m basically going in circles driving myself crazy. So I wanted to post in here to see if anyone can help pinpoint what I have going on and any recommendation/advice is greatly, greatly appreciated.

Now let me preface all of this by saying, this isn’t a simple solution - so if you’re just gonna respond by saying “maybe you need better sleep, better hydration, be more active, etc.” please just don’t. With all due respect, just trying to save both mine and your time. I’ve been dealing with this for quite some time, trust me I’ve tried all the “simple solutions” you can think of. I need some deeper thinking applied here. When i say this, please don’t hesitate to ask me questions, but don’t respond by saying “aRE yOu DrInKiNG eNoUGh WatER and ElectRoLytes”, not the post for that. 

So, let me start by saying, this is a cyclical thing (so weird). Starting every Thursday morning, i wake up and i feel absolutely terrible. I look at myself in the mirror and im not even seeing the same person, i have massive dark bags under my eyes, my face is pale and bloated - i feel and look terrible. My stomach is bloated, im around 15% bf with visible able so I can clearly see when I have a little pouch out of nowhere. I have awful brain fog, im so fatigued, almost dizzy in a way, I’m in a terrible mood, cant think and can barely focus on anything. Im super anxious (normally very calm with no anxiety), and overthink a ton - i literally feel like i wanna hide in a dark room for these 2 days. Also when Thursday starts the gut issues begin, nausea, indigestion, loose stools and a bit of acid reflux. Now remember, when I say I have all these symptoms, the days leading up to Thursday and Friday i feel great. I feel like myself, sharp, focused, energized, less anxiety/overthinking, mood is stable, gut feels good, i feel hydrated, i feel sexually healthy. Now let’s continue, on Thursday I feel incredibly dehydrated, my mouth is dry, my skin is dry, and I actually have a weird taste in my mouth (could be because it’s so dry?; not sure). No amount of water, salt, electrolytes help this. I also have ZERO libido, the desire/want to have sex is 0% (my total T ranges anywhere from 900-1000). My joints are sore, working out  on Thursday and Friday are brutal, my joints ache and I simply just don’t feel strong. I actually feel much weaker on those days. Last thing I noticed recently is my right lymph node under my jaw is swollen - my neck also feels swollen along with my face, no idea what this could mean; Infection? Virus? Not a clue. And guys let me just say again, there’s no amount of working out, sweating, sunlight, water, electrolytes, coffee, walking/ etc. that helps. There’s nothing I can do that even TOUCHES these symptoms or lessens them at all. And believe me, I’ve tried all the simple stuff.

Ok so now here’s the kicker, Saturday mid morning rolls around … poof symptoms are gone. Quality of sleep was great, face and stomach de bloat, eye bags/circles are gone, the color of my skin comes back to normal , much less anxiety, mood is stable gut issues stabilize, i feel hydrated and happy and my libido spikes back.. i feel like me again. This has literally happened cycle after cycle for months and months and months. I know it sounds crazy but is happened to me every week for years now. 

It’s hard to even go to a doctor and explain this because, where would we even start? 

In terms of my diet, it’s Whole Foods and that’s it. Zero sugar. I’ve been eating just Whole Foods for a long time  ow and i honestly feel incredible on this diet, my body composition is awesome and I feel really good mentally, just outside of Thursday and Friday. So weird, i know lol. 

But would love to hear everyone’s thoughts here, i know there has to be something I’m missing and would love to hear some of your thoughts/advice. For anyone that comments, thank you in advance! ",2,1755308488.0,FunctionalMedicine,0,1.0,False

 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke.

I wanted to thank everyone who commented — I read every single reply. A lot of you told me to make a plan, to be careful, to document everything. I’ve been trying.

But things have gotten worse since then.

Two nights ago, he came home already in a bad mood. I don’t even know why — maybe traffic, maybe work. The girls had just finished their baths and were giggling in their room. He stormed in, yelling that they were being “disrespectful” because they weren’t quiet enough. He slammed their door so hard that a picture fell off the wall and cracked the frame. Both girls started crying.

Later, when I tried to calm him down, he turned on me. He got right in my face, screaming so loud I thought my ears would burst. He didn’t hit me, but he punched the wall right next to my head. The sound made my youngest scream again from down the hall.

The next morning, he acted completely normal. Made coffee. Kissed the girls on the forehead like nothing happened. I just stood there shaking. It’s like living with two different people.

I’ve been keeping my journal and recordings. My therapist says I need to focus on safety planning now. She gave me the number for a shelter, and I’ve saved it in a way he won’t notice. I’ve also quietly reached out to a lawyer — but I haven’t officially met with them yet because I’m scared he’ll find out.

I’m terrified that the next time he loses it, it won’t be the wall he punches.

The girls are quieter now. My 9-year-old barely speaks when he’s home. My 6-year-old has started asking me if Daddy is mad before she does anything. It breaks my heart.

I know I need to leave. I *know*. But I’m so scared — of him finding out, of money, of custody battles. I feel like I’m living in constant survival mode, and I don’t know how much longer I can pretend everything is fine.

Chapter 1 Stolen Mating Ceremony
Aurelia’s POV
They say marriage is the grave of love. But hey, getting a proper burial beats having your corpse rot in the wild.

After more than two months of hard work, I finally finished sewing my wedding dress with my own hands. Under the lights, it’s pure white, elegant, and sparkling. I’ve imagined the moment I’d walk down the aisle toward the man I love so vividly that even in my dreams, I can’t suppress a smile.

From the ages of nineteen to twenty-five, I have dreamed of this moment, the moment I will become his Luna and that day has finally come. But in the blink of an eye, that beautiful dream was shattered in the most gut wrenching way.

“Aurelia, the Alpha just came by and said you’re no longer going to be at the mating ceremony. He took the ceremonial dress,” Veronica, one of my oldest friends, said, sounding puzzled.

I looked up at the cracked door, still groggy from sleep, and frowned. “Alpha Trystan took my dress?”

“Yes, didn’t you know?”

Slowly, I snapped out of the grogginess, but I couldn’t understand why Trystan would take the ceremonial dress so early. I had it laid on the couch down in the living room of the packhouse so I could get ready.

“I would check through the pack link.”

Veronica nodded and slowly backed away from the door. I sat up at the edge of the bed, still unsure of what was going on. Our packhouse was already overflowing with wedding preparations - where would he even put it? 

I searched for him in my mind and finally found him, but he blocked me.

Then I tried again and broke through. Alpha, did you take my ceremonial dress? I need it for tonight.

I did. Come and meet with me in the office immediately.

His voice sounded hoarse and tired, even through the pack link.

I rushed to get dressed and straightened my hair before heading out. The sun was barely up, the air still cool as I hurried to the car and went to the Alpha’s office. I passed a few curious glances, but I ignored them. When I finally reached it, he was already outside the door, waiting.

I sucked in a breath and took him in. He looked like he hadn’t hardly slept. 

“Is something wrong?” I asked, concern filling my voice.

After a pause, he replied calmly, but with an icy tone. “Aurelia, we need to cancel the ceremony.”

My mind buzzed as it went blank. “But why? Everything was fine last night.”

“Laura, your sister, was diagnosed with a rare werewolf leukemia. The pack doctors say she only has three months to live at most.”

For a moment, I almost thought it was karma finally catching up to that horrible girl. You see, we weren’t close, especially with all the things she put me through out of jealousy. 

“What does her leukemia have to do with our mating ceremony?”

He sighed. “Her final wish is to mate with me. She wants to die without regrets.”

Before I could wrap my mind around it and respond, he continued, “I know this is too much to ask, but she’s dying. Can you find some compassion for her in your heart? She is your sister.”

I was so shocked, I almost laughed at how ridiculous his request was. After a long pause, I asked in a sullen voice, “Trystan, do you even hear what you’re saying? You want to give my dying sister the place of Luna. That position is rightfully mine, and we have planned our ceremony for a while. Do you realize the chaos that might happen if you mate with a woman who can’t even fulfill the role of Luna fully?”

Trystan cleared his voice, remaining firm. “Yes, I know what I’m doing, Aurelia. I’m going to mate with Laura tonight to fulfill her final wish. You may feel this is unfair to you, so as compensation, I’m willing to give you a sum of money to start over with and maybe find another man who will mate with you. I hope you will think this over.”

My entire body went numb as I shoved that memory aside. “And if I refuse?”

I could tell Trystan’s patience was wearing thin just by the look on his face. His brows were furrowed and his gaze had narrowed into slits as his eyes glowed. “Aurelia, can’t you show some kindness to your sister for once? She is your family, and she’s dying. Can’t you even grant this tiny wish for her?”

What kind of twisted logic was this?

I couldn’t help but bite back a bitter laugh. “If you care so much about her, why don’t you just follow her to the grave after she dies? It’s only fitting that mates go together, right?”

""You—"" he trailed off.

My words left him speechless. After a tense moment, he went another direction.

“I’ve already brought the ceremonial dress to the hospital. Laura’s about your size, so it’ll fit her perfectly.”

Before I could respond, his phone rang. A familiar voice called out from the background. “Alpha! Laura’s awake.”

That voice… It was Rebecca, my father’s current wife, my stepmother, and Laura’s biological mother.

“I’ll be right there,” he answered urgently, then turned back to me. “I need your answer in an hour.”

He ran off before I could say another word to him.

I scoffed. What a sweet little family they’ve made for themselves. How ironic.

Years ago, Rebecca tore my mother’s marriage apart. Now her daughter wanted to steal my fiance. Like mother, like daughter.

After the divorce, which was brutal considering werewolf mating customs, it took less than three months for my dad to parade Rebecca into our home like a queen. She brought along her precious twins, both two years younger than me. I thought they were just step-siblings. 

Later, I learned the devastating truth that they were my father’s flesh and blood. He had already been cheating and built a whole secret family behind my mother’s back. It was a grave offense since wolves mate for life. 

When mom found out, she was furious. She sued again, trying to reclaim what was rightfully ours. But my father? He not only refused, but he swallowed nearly all of my grandparents’ business assets, leaving us broke.

Grandpa collapsed from the shock. Mom sold everything, scraped together every penny, but still couldn’t save him. The grief from it all crushed her. Then came depression, then breast cancer. She didn’t last long after that.

I knew she didn’t die from illness. My poor mother died from heartbreak and betrayal. 

She begged me to leave with her. I didn’t because I was twelve, angry, and stubborn. I stayed, to be a thorn in their side. To make them pay. 

After losing everything, I swore that one day I’d take back every bit of it, with interest. 

I worked my way up. And now? I was supposed to marry Trystan, my childhood love and the future alpha of the Silver Moon pack. Our marriage was meant to be a power bond, a triumph. I thought I’d finally won.

But here we are. On the night before our wedding, I got betrayed by him. And the girl who once called me sister.

When had Trystan and Laura grown so close? Though she was part of the pack, I rarely saw them interact.

Was it when she had looked at me while we were together a few months ago and said that she’d only ever love our alpha and she’d rather die than not have him?

Despite me already being his mate to be and our ceremony coming, her dramatic proclamation had only earned her a few cheers from those who hated me and didn’t want me to be their luna.

But if these were the reasons for him mating with her now, then what was the meaning of us being together for all these years and finally having our ceremony? 

I had always been the one there for him. I had tended to every wound when he went through the trials to become the next alpha. When he was broken and bleeding, I was the one that the pack doctors got blood from to give him. That one time he got sick and was so weak after one of the fights, I was the one who was by his bedside, taking care of him. I was the one who spent countless hours and sleepless nights, ensuring that my mate and Alpha heir would survive.

And now, just because my sister was dying, he betrayed me like this without hesitation? And because of that, he’s calling off our planned mating ceremony to mate with her instead?

I fought back tears. He wasn’t worth it. The abuse and humiliation I endured in the Silver Moon Pack had taught me one thing. Tears would never get me anywhere. The only thing that could get things done was action.

I caught up to where the alpha had vanished and opened the door to the hospital where my sister stays. He turned after seeing me and walked back to the door.

“What is it?”

“Alpha, I’ll surrender my place as your mate on one condition. I want the money and to have another mate. If you agree, I want it signed in writing what I’ll receive for doing this, so you can’t back out of it.”

Chapter 2 Second Choice

I expected him to explode in anger, or yell at me for agreeing with what he said earlier. But after a brief pause, he simply said, “Fine. I’ll see you tonight.”

It was like he didn’t even want to fight it.

When my mother died, I knew some of the pack felt sorry for me, especially with how quickly my father moved on and took in his secret family. Now I watched Trystan turn and head back to my sister. Is this real? Is this a fated mate connection that just manifested? 

Despite what we had, he was willing to give everything we had up just to be with Laura in her dying moments, so it didn’t really matter.

My head dropped in shame as I walked back to the car and stayed that way until I reached the pack house. When I walked in, I saw our ceremonial decor out in the living area. Every piece of it made my skin crawl. I wanted to burn it all, since it wasn’t happening.

I looked at Veronica, who was fiddling with one little white ribbon on some flowers. “Get rid of everything that ties me to the ceremony. It is no longer mine.”

She just looked at me in shock as I turned away to head to my room.

As my thoughts turned darker, I was thankful I had never had sex with Trystan and told him I wouldn’t until the ceremony. If I had, that would have just made this worse.

I went to my room and stayed there for hours. When I emerged again to head downstairs for a snack, I noticed that Veronica had cleared everything for me, just as I asked. The ceremonial decor had every single shred of me removed and was now ready for whatever he wanted to use it for. 

Just as I turned to head to the kitchen, I heard someone knocking, then burst through the door. It was Trystan. And he brought his mother with him.

She must have not liked the deal between us.

“You’re here,” I said, keeping my voice low as I watched them from a few feet away. I nodded at Trystan before glancing at his mother, Vee. “Luna Hart.”

She forced out a bitter laugh. “I thought we were past formalities? Shouldn’t you be calling me mom?”

I smiled sweetly, trying to hide the disgust bubbling under the surface. “My mother is dead and you’re not her or anything to me anymore.”

The unspoken words were clear. She’s not worthy.

Her face went completely blank, as if I had slapped her across her cheek.

Trystan looked equally as grim as he took a step toward me. “Aurelia, I’m the one who wronged you. Don’t take it out on my mother. You know how she feels about you.”

“Oh, so you’re saying I should blame this on your father instead? I know you’ve always had a soft spot for my sister, more so than me. Then again, I guess your father never taught you, you don’t abandon the woman you’re supposed to mate with, so it’s his fault for that too. You're the Alpha, though, so it is your decision.”

“Aurelia,” he said, a growl at the back of his throat. He was about to lose his temper, but was fighting it for all he was worth.

I simply shrugged. “It’s true.”

Vee tugged at his shirt sleeve. “Look, you need to calm down before you shift here. Let’s talk about this and figure something out.”

Trystan reined in his anger and straightened his pants where they had gotten tight from almost shifting. He walked toward one of the various chairs in the room and plopped down, making himself comfortable, then motioned for me to take a seat. I slowly walked over and found a seat across from him, putting the coffee table between us.

His brows furrowed. “Here. As you demanded, here is some money to tide you over since I stopped our ceremony.” 

I picked up the envelope as he laid it down on the coffee table between us, then skimmed through the contents. It wasn’t enough to completely start over.

“While I thank you for trying to give me enough to live off of for your inconvenience, I want compensation for the wedding dress too. That was my design and I put it together,” I said without looking up.

When I finally did, he frowned. Clearly, he didn’t expect me to be this petty about it.

“How much do you want for it?”

“A million,” I said without smiling. It would be enough to start over.

Vee gasped. ""Aurelia, that's robbery.”

“Luna Hart,” I said, keeping my voice calm. “Would you like for me to remind you of how much the pack is worth? You all have plenty of money because everything the pack does goes into the bank accounts. Or have you forgotten that you let my mom’s place go and I want to save it?”

My retort was met with silence. 

""Of course, you're welcome to refuse,"" I added lightly, ""But we both know Laura wants that specific dress just to spite me. So no matter the price, your son is going to pay for it.”

Trystan’s eyes flickered with surprise. He knew I wasn’t going to let this go, especially with how Laura was. She could have gotten a ceremonial dress from the pack’s shop or made one herself, but no, she wanted the one I had spent months making. Not only that, but Trystan had the nerve to take it right from under Veronica’s nose when she was preparing everything on the day of our ceremony.

Sure enough, after a long pause, Trystan nodded in agreement. ""Fine. A million dollars it is.""

Vee whirled on him, her face one of shock. “Have you lost your mind? Why are you throwing away the pack’s money like that?”

""Stay out of this, mom."" Trystan brushed off her concerns and turned back to me. ""Laura’s too ill to pick out jewelry for the wedding. She said since you've already chosen yours that she'd like to have it.""

Watching him defend her disgusted me. The corner of my mouth twitched in bitter amusement. “Do you remember what you promised me when I agreed to be your mate, Trystan?”

I remembered that night well. He had promised me he’d never betray me and that he’d only love me for the rest of his life because I was the only one who had ever been there for him through everything. 

And look where that had gotten us.

He met my gaze, guilt flashing across his features. “I do love you, Aerie. I’m doing this out of pity, because she’s so young. I mean, she’s two years younger than you and dying. Aren’t you even a little sad about her passing?”

Memories came to the forefront of mine. At twelve, Laura ran with scissors in her hand to shred my favorite dress. At fourteen, she dumped roaches in my bed while I was asleep and howled with laughter as I screamed. Of course, I had chased her with one after that and tried shoving them down her throat as payment for being so mean. But she tumbled down the stairs.

My father and his new mate were furious about the incident. I remembered being beaten black and blue, but I got my revenge on the night of the next full moon while they were out on the pack run. I shredded all their clothes in my wolf form, leaving nothing but tattered rags.

It was probably why my sister hated me so much. After all, my father’s new mate was her mother.

No one could understand the depth of my hatred for Laura and that woman she called mother.

And yet they expected me to feel sad now that Laura claimed to be dying? 

“You’re right,” I said with a sigh, laying a hand over my heart. “It’s such a tragedy, Trystan. She’s such a beauty to be withering away at such a young age.”

The sarcasm and irony went right over their heads. Trystan actually had the nerve to nod, with his eyes glistening with tears, while Vee had a sad expression on her face.

“Exactly,” she said as her eyes welled with tears. “No one should pass so young and you all have lost so much, I hate for you to lose your only family too.”

When the tears fall harder and she sobs, Trystan grows concerned.

""Mom, your heart condition..."" he started and trailed off, fretting, before turning to me with gentleness. “Aerie, I’ll mate Laura first to fulfill her dying wish, but then I’ll mate with you and have the ceremony I promised you. It’ll be even better, though. I promise. We’ll get you new jewelry and a new dress. Everything you want will be yours.”

I blinked in disbelief. It took me several seconds to process what he just said. “What? You said you’d give me the money and then find another mate for me! ”

What made him think I’d beg to be his leftovers? Sure, he was the Alpha and had one of the highest ranking of all wolves, but I would never beg to be someone’s second choice, especially not after my sister had him.

Trystan looked ashamed, but then shook his head. “You’re the love of my life and I can’t go through with finding you someone else, so please don’t ask that of me. Of course, I’ll mate with you. Don’t say it like it’s disgusting. To me, you’ll always be my true mate.”

I almost gagged at his statement. Without hesitation, I stood up with the money in hand. “You want the jewelry fine. Add more money to the price, so I have enough to live off, because I’m not staying in this pack any longer. Wire the money to my individual account and then remove me from the books.”

 I turned and walked toward my room, the snack long forgotten, with him calling after me.

“Wait!”

“There’s nothing left to say to you. Just deliver the money and find another pack alpha who will take me in.”

Chapter 3 Goodbye, Ex-Mate

As I made it back to my room, I slammed the door behind me for good measure and took a deep breath. 

In some ways, I wanted to thank my dear sister, because without her little sad plea for him to mate with her, I might have actually married this two-faced low life scum. Though he’s an alpha and that should mean something, I knew I had dodged a silver bullet.

Somewhere far below in one of the rooms on the first floor, I heard someone yelling above the hum of the others. I shook my head, imagining it had something to do with our Alpha. Then again, you’d hear plenty in these paper-thin walled rooms.

Suddenly, there was a knock at the door and it swung open before I could say a single word. Veronica stood there, panting for breath, with a smile on her face that made me wonder what was going on.

“What is it?”

“Alpha Trystan might just be losing his marbles in the living area and his mother isn’t far behind him,” she said, her smile growing wider. “He told her he thought you’d be better than this and waited for him.”

“How funny. We see how that went,” I laughed,“My sister strikes again.”

“At least this time, she’s taking out the garbage for you,” Veronica replied, her eyes gleaming with mischief.

“That is true,” I said before looking over at the jewelry I would have worn tonight. Most didn’t mean a thing to me. They were just trinkets I picked up at random shops or costume jewelry. I gathered it up and put it in a small box before turning back to Veronica. She had made herself at home on the corner of my bed.

“I guess I won’t be needing these pieces anymore since her royal Luna to be wants them.”

“Are you sure about this?”

I was positive and honestly, if he was going to be like this, then I didn’t want to be his luna, anyway. “It’s fine, Veronica.”

She nodded. “For what it’s worth, I think you would have been an amazing Luna for this pack. You’ve worked hard for us and I hate that Alpha Trystan threw it all away.”

I smiled at her, but it wasn’t a happy one. It was pained and full of grief I had yet to let go of. When she got up and left, I finally cracked a little.

One tear slid down my cheek as I thought about what could have been.

The next morning my phone dinged, letting me know that money had been deposited into my account. I was angry, but who in their right mind would say no to money?

I turned back to the jewelry box to finish packing it when my phone rang. My brows furrowed, because the screen said the call was from my dad. I almost didn’t answer, but I picked it up to get it over with.

“You can’t even visit your dying sister?” He said, his voice growing louder with each word. 

Of course, this was something I had grown used to over the years. He loved his other family more than he ever loved his first family. 

I reached up, looking at my fingernails as they sharpened into points. “Should I bring a cake? Maybe some fireworks to celebrate with?

He scoffed. “What is wrong with you, Aurelia? What kind of question is that?”

“Relax,” I said, almost unleashing a growl. “It’s a get well soon cake. And hopefully it brings her good luck.”

My dad went silent.

“And of course, this moment when she marries the man who was supposed to be my mate is worth celebrating, isn’t it?”

“Aurelia Barker! You’re just as your mother-”

I hung up on him before he could insult the memory of my late mother. The thought of him raging, but unable to reach me made me chuckle darkly. Could Laura’s illness be karma for her parents’ sins?

The Moon Goddess was fair, I guessed.

I sighed as I picked up the box with the jewelry, a match, my phone, and then picked up some fireworks on my way out of the room. My steps were quick as I made a path directly to the car, then drove over to the pack’s hospital to see my sister. If my father wanted me to visit, then I would.

Mostly, I just wanted to see Laura’s dying face.

Just as I was about to knock on my sister’s door again, I heard a voice speak up.

“Aurelia’s probably thrilled with her sister’s death,” Rebecca’s voice wavered. “She always hated Laura. She has been her biggest bully since she met her. Now, my poor baby is sick and I bet that woman is laughing in her sleep about it,” she said before breaking down into sobs. Then I heard her voice grow louder, more hateful. “Why won’t the Moon Goddess take that scheming girl instead? Why does it have to be my darling daughter?”

I didn’t waste any time after hearing that. I kicked the door open, and it flew back, banging against the wall.

Inside, my father cradled Rebecca while sobbing. It was like a scene of some tragic romance novel I had heard about. Everyone turned, their eyes widening as they took me in.

Trystan recovered from shock first. “Aerie, you came.” 

He stepped forward, acting almost warm toward me. I ignored him as I pulled up the match and the set of firecrackers I held in the other hand. 

“Aurelia!” Trystan screamed. “What do you think you’re doing?”

“Celebrating,” I said cheerfully.

My dad connected the dots first. “Don’t you da–”

I set off the firecrackers inches away from the alpha’s feet. He yelped, diving a few feet away to get away from it while the other scrambled away like the bugs they were. It was priceless.

If it wasn’t for a few others visiting, I would have brought the higher grade fireworks to send my sister off with a bang. Smoke filled the room, setting off the smoke alarms, which blared to the point of hurting my ears. The sprinklers went off, drenching everything in the main room of the house.

The pack doctor came running into the room, his face a deep red from rage. ""This isn't some backwater exorcism! If fireworks can cure leukemia, we would've sold them in the gift shop!"" He rounded on Rebecca, ""I understand your distress, but this superstitious nonsense—""

Rebecca cried out, “It was her!” She jabbed a single finger in my direction. “She did this on purpose. Alpha Trystan should imprison her.”

The pack doctor shot me a look before looking at Laura, who was currently drenched on the bed. “I will have to move her elsewhere, so she can remain dry and comfortable.”

Laura, who was drenched and shivering, clung to Trystan as he helped her stand. The assistants to our pack doctor scrambled through the smoke and water, trying to figure out where they’d move her to. Rebecca shot me a look that could melt steel but went after them.

My mission was accomplished, except I still had the jewelry. Sighing, I followed them across the room. Laura was sitting on a chair, waiting for someone to help her change. For once, she kept her venom in check, probably playing the sweet angel for Trystan.

“What now?” Rebecca snarled, emerging from the attached bathroom with a towel in her hand as she dabbed her hair. “Haven’t you done enough?”

Ignoring her words, I approached my sister and ex mate, dropped the velvet box on the sheets on the bed beside them.

“Congratulations, Laura. You’re finally getting your dream wedding,” I said, smiling sweetly. “Though I supposed the whole part about ‘til death, do us part’ or until the Moon Goddess takes us comes quicker for you. Consider your wish fulfilled, I guess.”

“Aurelia!”

Sadly, it was true. On my sister’s eighteenth birthday, before she set her sights on Trystan, Laura had made a wish. She would rather die if she couldn’t mate with him. She got exactly what she wished for.

But even with my harsh words, Laura didn’t lash out. Instead, she looked up at me with glistening eyes, her voice trembling like a delicate moonflower. “Thank you, sister, for letting me have Alpha Trystan. I know you are angry with both of us, and I don’t blame you for what you did just now. This is all my thought.”

A single tear rolled down her cheek. And all I could think was this had to be some kind of show.

“Laura, when we were younger, at least you had the guts to be openly vicious. What happened? Afraid my ex-mate won’t like you if he sees the real you?”

She sniffed, fully committing to the pitiful act. “I was just an innocent child back then, and you were always so perfect. I only acted out because I wanted attention, like you had. You’d never understand what it’s like to feel like an outsider in your own home.”

Oh, this was rich coming from her. I became an outsider the moment her mother moved into my home and we realized the truth of what they were. If the wolves had an award for victim complexes, then she would win it every single year. 

I didn’t bother arguing with her.  I turned and grabbed the jewelry box, moving it closer to Laura. “Enjoy. Your beloved mate-to-be already paid for it.”

Laura glanced at Trystan in disbelief, almost questioning him silently about it, but he stiffened.

“So, when is this mating ceremony going to be?” I asked, feigning concern. I’d assumed they’d wait at least a month and choose the next full moon.

Laura smiled sweetly, revealing her venomous side. “Oh, you know, since everything is already ready, we’re just going to mate tonight instead of you.”

My stomach dropped. Not only had she stolen everything from me, but now she was going to steal the same night I was to mate with Trystan.

Rebecca noticed my reaction and her mouth twisted into a dazzling smile. “Why waste pack money? Everything is already booked and the invitations were sent to all the pack members, along with other packs. And Laura is family. Surely she can make use of them.”

I clenched my fists, my fingernails turning into claws and biting into my palms to keep from shredding her to pieces. The official plans for our mating ceremony had taken me six months to prepare, and now, it would all be hers.

“What? Keep it in the family?” The laugh that escaped me was bitter. “Is this what they mean by blood being thicker than water?”

Chapter 4 Wedding Customs

“Finally, you’re making some sense. What’s yours is hers - that’s what sisters do. Just consider it her wedding gift.”Rebecca broke that silence with her usual nonsense and drama filled words. 

My mouth pulled up into a sweet smile. “If that’s the case, then I should give her one more gift.”

“What?” Rebecca asked, her expression changed to one of confusion.

“A coffin,” I said. “It should be at the end of the aisle near where they’ll speak their binding vows during the ceremony. It’s only fitting.”

“Aurelia!” Rebecca shouted, her face turning a deep crimson.

Though it pained me, I kept my tone polite and sincere. “I heard my grandmother mention it once. Some brides get coffins on the day they mate. Well, technically, Trystan should have one too, so that way they are truly bound for life under the Moon Goddess. She will bless their union once she sees how committed they are to the eternal part.”

My logic was flawless. For years, they had taken advantage of me and when I was younger, I couldn’t fight back. Now the tables were turned.

Rebecca was shaking with anger, “Get out!” She screamed, pointing at me with one long finger. When I didn’t move, she turned to my dad. “Are you just going to stand there and let her speak to Laura that way? ”

“Apologize to your sister!” My father roared, his teeth changing into fangs. His hand went over Trystan’s shoulder as he pointed to me. “Make her Alpha. She should be punished.”

I didn’t even blink. “For what? You are being ignorant about how to properly bind yourself at a mating ceremony, but I guess I shouldn’t expect anything less. Look at what you did.”

He lunged over Trystan, swinging at me. The alpha held him back, but on the next swing, it hit Trystan and was so forceful that it knocked him aside, his hair falling to the side.

Laura shrieked from her chair. “Dad! What are you doing? Stop this!”

Trystan looked dazed, blinking hard as he kept himself between me and my father. “Mr. Barker, violence doesn't solve anything. This is my fault and I should have handled things better. Just give me time to fix it.”

My father, red-faced and wheezing as he glared at me. “You can deal with that insolent woman,” he spat at Trystan, but missed. “If this happens again, then I will have to question if you really are our alpha. I’ll break her legs until she learns to be obedient.”

Trystan nodded, then turned to face me, his voice low. “Aurelia, let’s go outside to talk.”

""I have nothing to say to you.""

I turned to leave, but he grabbed my wrist, holding me back. ""This attitude won't help. We're family now. Can't we just talk this through?""

Family? The word made my skin crawl.  ""You don't deserve to call yourselves my family."" I yanked my hand away from his grip. ""Let go.""

""Just hear me out—""

""I said let go!"" I twisted free and before I could stop myself, slapped him across the face. My claws dug through flesh, leaving streaks of blood dripping down his cheek.

Laura burst into tears, her hands coming up to her face to hide her shock. ""How dare you hit him? He is our Alpha and what you did can’t go unpunished. If you’re angry, then take it out on me. I’m the one who asked him to mate with me.”

I glanced at her, smiling coldly. ""Since when do I need a reason to slap a cheating bastard wolf? As for you..."" I shrugged. ""The underworld's already handling that for me."" 

Before they could react, I turned and slammed the door behind me. Outside, I stood frozen for a moment, waiting for my thoughts to settle. They were my family by blood, and that thought hollowed me out.

I had believed that Trystan was my escape and that loving him would heal the wounds they had given me. But I was wrong. He became the one who hurt me the most. Every sacrifice I had made for him, every drop of blood I had given him to keep him alive, made me feel hollow.

And then my phone buzzed in my pocket. I had forgotten I shoved it in there when I left my room at the packhouse.

It was my friend Sarah.

“Hello? Did you forget our lunch date or has Trystan locked you up somewhere?” She asked, jokingly, completely unaware of what had just transpired.

I frowned. With all the chaos, I had completely forgotten that we were supposed to discuss the mating ceremony today.

“I’ll be there soon.”

There was no longer a need to discuss anything. Not with me, anyway. But there was still a need for explanations.

With that thought, I headed to get my keys and got the car, then headed to town to the restaurant where we planned to meet. Sarah took one look at me the moment I walked into the room and knew that something was very wrong.

""What's wrong? You look like hell. Did something happen with your family again?” She asked, knowing good and well about my home life.

Instead of answering, I said flatly, ""Sarah, there's not going to be a mating ceremony.”

She paused, a coffee cup in her hand. ""What? What do you mean there's not going to be a mating ceremony?”

""Oh, the mating ceremony is still on,"" I said, smiling faintly. ""Just not for me.""

Sarah slammed her coffee mug on the table and reached across the table to feel my forehead as I sat down. “You can’t be serious? Are you sick? What happened?”

I pulled her hand away and looked into her eyes, hoping that she understood what I was about to tell her. So, I laid it out. The full story of how I was dumped and how everything was stolen from me.

Her eyes widened at first. Then her mouth fell open in shock. And her face went pale.

“What the actual — Trystan has lost his mind! Laura might as well have ‘home-wrecker’ tattooed on her forehead. Does he not care that everyone is going to lose respect for him? If he wants to ruin his alpha status, there are easier ways than taking your mate to be’s sister.”

Her voice carried over to the rest of the restaurant as she picked up her phone. “I’m going to call him right now and give him a piece of my mind. This is ridiculous.”

And true to her words, she actually reached for her phone and started dialing his number. 

I was too exhausted to stop her, and looked up right as the server delivered a cup of coffee for me. So I sipped it slowly, watching her face turn red.

“Trystan Hart, has Laura put some kind of spell on you? Since when is her leukemia your problem? Aurelia has spent eight years with you. Eight years of helping you through the alpha trials, giving you blood when you were gravely injured, and trained to be a Luna. Without her, you would be dead,” she said, sucking in a breath to have another go at him. “And since when did you and Laura get so close? Have you already slept together? I’ve seen trash before, but you? You’re an entire new level of disgusting–”

Sarah ranted at him nonstop for a solid five minutes, only stopping when a server nervously asked her to lower her voice so as to not disturb the other customers. 

Embarrassed, I grabbed her phone and hung up before she could continue. ""Let it go. We're causing a scene here.""

When she finally looked around and noticed their stares, Sarah took a deep breath and forced herself to calm down. 

""What is Trystan even thinking?"" Sarah gulped down some hot coffee, then suddenly asked, “Does he even know Laura and Lyle are your half-siblings?”

""Not sure. I never told him. Maybe he knows, maybe he doesn't.""

Our family situation wasn’t exactly something we talked about. Even with someone you loved, some truths were better left unsaid and that one I hadn’t said much about. Because I knew if our love ever died, then those secrets could become weapons.

""He doesn't know?"" Sarah smirked, clearly not taking my answer as an absolute. ""Well, I can't wait for the day Trystan finally sees Laura for what she really is. He'll be on his knees, begging for forgiveness.""

I didn’t respond. Even if he were to regret mating with her one day, it was no longer my concern. She was his problem now.

After our lunch, Sarah tried to comfort me. “At least you got money out of him. He’s just a piece of trash and they come and go. Now you can focus on other things.”

Her words reminded me that there were still some things left to take care of. 

After parting ways with Sarah, I texted Trystan to tell him to meet me this afternoon to handle some paperwork. He agreed without hesitating. 

The hours passed after I returned home and then I went to meet with him in his office. When I saw him, the marks I had left earlier across his cheek were still healing.

“Hurry up,” I muttered as he looked through the papers on his desk. “After this, we’re getting an official divorce.”

We had technically been legally married for a month. We just hadn’t gone through binding our wolves at the mating ceremony, which makes it fully official for werewolves. If I had known how this would end, then I wouldn’t have wasted my time going through the legal process of getting married.

Trystan looked at me with sorrow in his eyes, his lips parting as if he wanted to say something, but no words ever came.

We headed straight to Werewolf City Hall. That was when we learned the unpleasant truth about our divorce. It required an appointment first with one of our lawyers. Then, after submitting any documentation needed, they required a cooling off period of thirty days. If we still wanted out of the legal part by then, we could escape being together and finalize parting ways.

I looked through the appointments, trying to find the earliest slot available, only to realize the next available date was two weeks away. Which meant that when Trystan went through with the mating ceremony with Laura, I would still legally, in our society, be his wife.

What kind of sick joke is this?

Noticing my fury, Trystan lowered his voice. “There’s no rush. Laura isn’t pushing me about this part of it.”

My head snapped up so fast he flinched. ""She's not pushing you? Is she that confident she'll live long enough for that? I thought the pack doctor said she had three months?”

His face went rigid. Though our divorce process was simpler than most, it was still tedious. If I dragged my feet, I could make it last for months. Laura might take the mating ceremony this month, but legally, she could never be his wife as long as I was.

Trystan didn’t answer. Instead, he took a step closer and spoke with a soft voice. “Then let’s not get divorced. It will save us the trouble of going through this later and we can have our mating ceremony. It will be easier that way.”

I gaped at him, completely stunned. Even now, he genuinely believed that I’d take him back after Laura’s death.",1,1755307603.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False

It was it. Everything that I had been working on for the last eighteen months. I got that funny feeling that I imagine artists like Vincent van Gogh or Leonardo da Vinci get when they took that first step back after laying the final brush stroke to starry night or the Mona Lisa. Inhaling and exhaling while they absorb the amalgamation of months or years of grueling work but more importantly of their soul, all spread out over this canvas. Eighteen months ago I had taken the temperature on my soul, I had considered every action that came before and led me to my current position. I decided I had to truly contemplate how I would spend my time and energy moving forward. This mindset would ultimately lead me to where I was now, sitting in front of a laptop reading an email that was accepting my application to be a fire lookout in the Washington state area. Sure, it wasn't the persistence of time. But to me it was everything I had ever wanted. 

  
What you have to understand was this was after years of drug and alcohol filled benders in which I would not only lose belongings but massive parts of my psyche. Brushing them off or just ignoring their existence all together until so many cobwebs had built up in them that they could never run smoothly again. Even after eighteen months of honest, clean, disciplined living, some of these systems are still fried and prone to backfires. I find it hard to develop connections beyond the surface level, and especially hard to look into their eyes. 

  
Im a broken man, but a good, honest one. I once had dreams. Now I believe that theres nothing wrong with a quiet man just trying to keep to himself and do right by god. That man was me, I was the prodigal son and I had returned from the dead. Thats the funny thing, it was the slow and agonizing crawl out of hell that had saved me. I had earned a second chance and had learned that it wont take much for me to die proud. Being alone and watching over an expanse of this earth seemed perfectly adequate to me. 

  
Before I knew it I was on a bus Northbound, heading straight towards the canadian border. The man next me smelt like scrambled eggs drowned in tabasco sauce and the overheadlights made a slight buzzing noise. I was ready to get off this fucking thing and stretch my legs. It was raining out, there was a dampness in the air that stuck to your clothes even when cruising down the highway at about 60 miles an hour. I had everything I needed, double checked twice. Everything I didn't have would be sent in shipments, driven up by various rangers. However far more important than what I was bringing, was what I wasnt. No liquor, not only was I in recovery but it is heavily frowned upon by my employers. No room for failure. This may sound like a joke but I am dead serious. I have commited myself to this post and by god I was going to see it out. I was going up there with zero room for failure, and absolutely no liquor, I had made sure of it. Zilch, zip, nada. Double triple checked. None

  
My gaze was focused on a fruit fly to the right of Jason Nowaks big Polish head. It was anchored to the wall just above a framed picture of Fenway park. Now I only knew this pricks last name was Nowak because of the nametag on his desk right next to the plastic army man with two parralel red and white stripes across his helmet. As for his big fucking head it was sitting right in front of me, clear as day. However I was more fixated on this six legged alien with compound eyes. Did you know that there are over 100,000 species of flies in the world? With around four thousand of them being subclasses of the fru- 



And how do you think you will adjust to being completely isolated from the outside world, save from a ham radio that can call a whopping two stations 



He broke my concentration.



Call me crazy but im actually eager to be alone with my thoughts. As for adjusting to the isolation you wont have to worry about me no sir, solid as a rock. I responded confidently 



And you are aware of your duties being assigned to you during your stationing. They will be completed in a timely manner is that right? 



Every single day sir. Six am sharp. Im up when the sun rises



Then we are all set here. 

He said all this while handing me a set of keys 



Load all of your shit into the back of that tacoma parked out front, david here is gonna give you a lift to your station



Perfect.



I exclaimed this with a smile. He topped off my coffee and headed out a back door with an axe in his right hand leaning over that same shoulder. And that was the last time I would see Jason Nowak, the man who opened the gate and let me in. 



I shoved the covers off my twin sized bed and felt cold metal on the soles of my feet. It was the start of my fourth day as a fire watch, and I smiled as the first cup of coffee slid down my throat and I input basic readings like wind speed and temperature into the computer. It was a quaint little structure, but it made for a cozy abode as long as you came in with little to no expectations. A single fourteen by fourteen foot cabin floating about a hundred feet in the air, with windows embedded in every direction which made for a gorgeous three hundred sixty degree view of the green sea as I like to call it. Endless rich lush as far as your imagination will take you, and mine will run away sometimes. The cabin was surrounded by a ledge about 4 feet wide that stretched all the way around that had threaded metal rope about waist high to prevent you from falling. The entire thing was painted a dark forest green although it would be deep blue if you were to look at it through an infrared lens. This miracle in the sky was constructed with cold, hard, steel save from the concrete cylinders that held the beams and the glass that made up the windows. It may have blended in just fine but it was the furthest thing from natural. My bed took up about twenty of my hundred and ninety six cubic feet, while the radios, radars, and various other equipment took up another thirty feet. Throw in the stovetop, sink, and cabinets and I was looking at about a hundred twenty feet to myself, not including the outside ledge space that I could walk around on. David had brought all the supplies I would need for my first month which meant I now had twenty six more days until I would see another person. Twenty seven including today, the hour is still young after all. God is good. 

  
What if I told you I came out here to see something. If the horror stories that you hear from park rangers or other fire watchers or basically anyone in a massive, isolated swath of this great big country was one of the sole reasons for my positioning. If the heavily surveyed and science driven world that claims to have all the answers had pushed me to align myself in order to witness a miracle, an act of god if you will. When I witness it I wont pull my phone out to record it and I wont even tell another soul of its happening. No, that would tarnish it. I will sit back and witness it, and if the act takes me with it then so be it, but I will not let it pass me up. So creatures of the night, unholy beasts and acts of nature alike, I welcome you. 



Now let me get this clear, I didn't lie when I said I lived a disciplined life for the past eighteen months. I am an honest man looking for work however this job and its pay are simply means to an end. Seeing something that no person can explain, that's invaluable. I'm acutely aware that the chances I end up back home in six months having seen nothing are incredibly high. However the chances I see anything out of the ordinary in one of those concrete boxes that god hasn't looked in for almost a century now was zero. So, in contrast, the deep forest seemed to bear greater potential results. It's all about aligning yourself. Being in the right place at the right time



A week has gone by now. Things are monotonous. The only break to my routine has been the walk down a short chute to the west of my tower. There is a stream about 50 yards in the distance that I use to wash up when necessary. I found what remained of a deer about halfway there earlier today. Looked like a cat, poor bastards jugulars had been strewn across the surrounding area. Reminded me of a skier laying back down in the snow after a good ole yard sale. It lay there motionless, a still statue telling all the parts of an invigorating, gripping story. It lay there motionless and yet I could feel the brown oval shaped pupils' weight on my being. This long deceased deer made me stop in my tracks, it not the slightest bit aware of its prolonged impact on the material world. And yet it was looking through me, into me, with cold dead eyes that would not stray from my glance no matter where I was looking. I began to hear the creatures last moments in my head. Aggressive bleating and mangled screeches filled my head. And I saw myself. Twenty five yards east and about a hundred feet in the air. Sleeping like a baby.

A branch snapped about 15 feet behind me. I didnt get a chance to see what it was. Bathtime would have to wait. Yes. It would have to wait. Find a new way to get to the stream. Yes. Pick it up again about a hundred yards downstream. I think so. Changes would have to be made. 



I rubbed my eyes and blinked a moment before the panic set in. My torso was pressed against the cold metal rope. I was hunched over the railing such that I could see the base of my tower from all the way up here. I had gone to sleep in my bed same as any other night, yet here I was rubbing my eyes like a dunce moments before I tipped over this railing and went careening overboard into the sea of green surrounding me. I had no lifeboats or crew members to save me. 

Do you really want to abandon your post? 

I kept hearing myself scream in my head. And I honestly think it was this thought that saved me, the thought of a giant flourishing swath of gods green earth engulfed in flames all because of me that reached out and caught my weight right before I surpassed the fulcrum point. After this I threw myself backward and landed on my ass but at least I was safe. This was a very interesting start to my tenth day living out here. The sun way barely over the trees. I had gone to sleep in my bed I was sure of it. It was at this moment that I had the first feeling since I  had arrived that I didn't want to be here anymore. 



Words on a page can only get you so far. I was sick of reading, and I was sick of the smell. About every two hours the reminisce of something awful and decaying would waft up to my floating paradise and pull me out of whatever nightmarish scenario mr. lovecraft was delineating on the pages. Against my better judgement I had checked on the deer carcass. All that remained was a barren rack of ribs and half of its skull. Only this time it did not acknowledge my presence, for better or worse this creature had returned to the forest in the form of full bellies and a thriving mycelium network. Whatever was creating this smell that had a knack for interrupting my written words was not what remained of this poor creature. I can't even read in peace anymore, this has to stop. 



I had a dream in the middle of the night. I was a lighthouse wicket off the shore of god knows where. My best guess would be New England maybe. Somewhere near Boston where I am from. I've never tended a lighthouse and yet with an atavistic intuition puppetering over me  I knew exactly what my duties were. The air was damp and heavy and would crack your skin if you stayed out in it too long. I pulled a wheelbarrow full of firewood from shed to house back and forth for what seemed like an eternity? 

Is this purgatory?

I asked myself this while looking at the actual sea this time. The kind that was a deep blue and ruthless and had no doors, and contained monsters of every kind imaginable. The kind that turned black as the night when the sun went down and could chew you up and spit you out a hundred times without even the slightest grasp of yourself or your existence. The kind that held secrets and dreams within its depths. One giant graveyard is what it was, and I was miles from land, surrounded by it. It was this thought I had with one hand still resting on a half full wheelbarrow that woke me from my slumber. As I arose and saw a sun rising over a sea of green this time, for the first time in a while I felt thankful to be here, in this moment. 



Back to it, no matter how absurd my subconscious could be when it had time to roam free I had duties. Important ones. I imputed all the necessary data and sent it to the station as the first cup of coffee slid  down my throat. Things like temperature and wind speed, which were all extremely par for the course on this particular day. I wondered what the station did with all these “monotonous” record days as I liked to call them. 

Did they really get stored somewhere?

I doubt it. They are probably forgotten about just as quick as they are read. This thought gave me a queasy feeling as it dawned on me that I might be wasting my time here. Uploading numbers like these changed about as much as a fart in the wind. It was with the second cup that I remembered why I was here, and how important it was that I stayed where I am. Just in case. The average numbers led to an average day, par for the course. I stayed up a little later than usual staring at my ceiling. I think I am afraid to fall asleep.

That said- I can’t foresee ever starting a family with him, and I’m mostly at peace with that. Neither of us have ever dreamed of being parents, and we’re a long way off financially and career wise for being ready for that kind of commitment anyways- but I’ve long felt I wouldn’t even entertain it if he changed his mind because I don’t think he’d make a good father/partner with kids.

The career he wants to go into could have him gone on travel every other week, or at least for many consecutive days at a time. Leaving me alone with our baby/child full time without break for long stretches of time.

He and I would have very different parenting styles, where I prefer a lot of structure and he would want to be very hands off. 

As it stands, I don’t feel that he equally contributes to the household chores (cleaning/upkeep of the house, restocking necessities around the house, cooking, etc). This man hasn’t cleaned a bathroom in the entire 8 years I’ve been with him, he’s always either paid someone to do it or waited until I took it upon myself to do it. He contributes in other ways, and he’s not a deadbeat who does NOTHING- he’s not an outright slob. But he’ll leave chip bags open on counters, not do any deep cleaning, not put dishes in the dishwasher- typical stuff. He helps with vacuuming, picking things up, taking out the trash, dishes, but he doesn’t dust the baseboards and the shelves or descale the coffee maker. That kind of difference. 

He’s already not a fully in partner in those ways, and it is cringey to me how much worse that would become if we had a kid. He’d be one of those dads that only helps with the baby if I asked him to. He wouldn’t know what diapers the baby needs or which food to buy. He’d be texting me to ask or expecting it to be stocked in the house for him. Parenting takes a massive amount of effort and labor and love, and if we tried to raise a child under our current relationship balances, I’d grow horrifically resentful of him, and likely leave him. I think having a kid would be our end because I would be hormonal and extra sensitive and he hasn’t shown me that he would be capable of stepping up in that way.

I’ve asked the man for 8 years to make me a grilled cheese and soup when I’m sick, and, to this day, he has refused to learn how to make a fucking grilled cheese. Even though it’s stupid easy, he’s a good cook when he DOES cook (once a month or less), and he knows how much I crave it when I don’t feel well. This is not a man who’s going to intuitively know how to take care of a child.

I’m a grown ass woman and I can take care of myself, but I’m not going to subject a child to this lackluster parenting.

He’s a wonderful man and partner, and I didn’t speak to all of his amazing qualities in this post- but a dad? He would be crap.",11,1755307293.0,confessions,13,1.0,False

So, I decided for no good reason to do a homemade coffee vanilla cake, even tho I do not like coffee.

And this cake is sooo good.


Preheat the oven at 350°F. The cake will be in the oven for 30 to 40 min. Test with a fork or woodstick at 30 min mark to see if it is OK.


For the Coffee Vanilla Cake:
▢1 ¾ cups Organic Whole Wheat Flour
▢1 cup Brown Sugar
▢1 tsp Baking Soda
▢½ tsp Salt
▢1 cup Water(240ml)
▢2 tbsp pure Vanilla Extract
▢1/3 cup melted Margarine (80ml)
▢1 Tbsp Apple Cider Vinegar
▢½ to 1 cup Decaff instant coffee

Mix every dry ingredients together.
Mix all the liquid/oil ingredient togheter.
Combine the two mix together and mix it.
Put the mixture in the mold of your choice. Don't forget to put enough Margarine on the surface of the mold before putting your mixture in it.



For The Vanilla Coffee Frosting:
▢1 to 2 cups Powdered Sugar (icing sugar)
▢3 Tbsp Melted Maragrine
▢½ to 3 Tbsp Water
▢2 packs of Vanilline Sugar (about 20g I believe) (here, if you put pure vanilla extract, the alcohol in the extract will not evaporates and it will taste like shit. This is why I use powdered Vanilline instead)

Melt the margarine.
Add the Vanilline Sugar.
Mix well.
Add 2 to 4 spoons of the Powder sugar, and mix well.
Add little  it of water and mix well.
Do that again and again until you reach a somewhat paste that hold itself and then is somewhat runny. You can make it thick or not, that is really up to you at this point. Just, do NOT add a lot of water. Add LITTLE AMOUNT of water then mix and see if you need more. Tiny like ⅛ spoon at a time.

Here, you can add:
Add 1 to 4 tbsp of Decaff Instant Coffee.
Mix well.
It will be a little crunchy, which is nice. I did it.

Three months ago, I was scrolling through productivity content at 2AM (ironic, I know) when I stumbled across the whole ""5AM club"" thing. My first thought? ""These people are insane.""

But I was desperate. I felt like I was always behind, always stressed, never had time for myself. So I said screw it let's try this for 30 days.

Here's what actually happened:

Week 1: Pure hell. I'm not gonna lie. I wanted to quit every single morning. My body was in retaliating. But I stuck with it because I'm stubborn.

Week 2-3: Something shifted. I started looking forward to those quiet hours. No notifications. No chaos. Just me and my notes. It felt like I had peace for the first time in my life.

Week 4+: Life changer. I suddenly had 2-3 extra hours every day. I started reading again. Working out. Actually eating breakfast instead of grabbing whatever.

When you win the morning, you feel like you can win the day. That confidence carries over into everything else. I became the person who gets shit done instead of the person who talks about getting shit done.

Three things that made it stick:

1. Go to bed earlier (revolutionary, I know). If you're staying up till midnight, 5AM won't work.
2. Have something to look forward to. For me, it was that perfect cup of coffee and 30 minutes of reading. Find your thing.
3. Start gradually. Don't go from 8AM to 5AM overnight. Move it back 15 minutes every few days.

I'm not saying you need to become a 5AM person. But if you're feeling stuck and want those extra hours back in your life give it a shot for just one week.

It helped me become more productive and disciplined.

It has now been two years since I began experiencing symptoms. I was in near constant flares, fluctuating in severity, for most of that time. Only recently have I begun to achieve periods of several days straight with no symptoms at all. Today marks one full week of total freedom from bladder pain. 

I am not sure of all the patterns, but it certainly seems that taking care of my gut health is the absolute priority. Eating a good amount of berries and seeds was always helpful back when I first got sick, but it wasn't until I discovered[ this probiotic](https://www.precisionbiotics.co.uk/p/alflorex-original-daily-gut-supplement-30-capsules/13444442/?affil=thggpsad&switchcurrency=GBP&shippingcountry=GB&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=22401344080&gbraid=0AAAAAC_TlVada0QlyB_enIm5THgHgvgjA&gclid=CjwKCAjwtfvEBhAmEiwA-DsKjlD2PDjXCx7fjywoJZIJrlrZ61jaR9XgJR872pdOmfD_cKI8o3uqmxoCszEQAvD_BwE), Aflorex, this year that the pain really began to wane. Once I suspected that the probiotic was helping, I upped my veg intake and incorporated nuts and seeds strictly into my daily diet. I have always struggled to eat well, but now I treat it like medicine. Every day I have one punnet of berries, a few spoonfuls of sunflower seeds (tho I think flax work also), a handful of cooked greens like broccoli or green beans and a handful of cooked carrots. 

Even with the probiotic, I still have to be really on it with that regimen- and missing a day or so will punish me- but when I'm able to stay consistent it seems to really help.

Beyond that I really don't limit my diet much. I can drink coffee and soda no problem. Citrus also seems fine unless super concentrated. 

I'd like to think that consistency over a few months with this regimen is yielding results. 

Despite the recent improvement, I have two guaranteed triggers. First is penetrative sex, though when my bladder is calmer I can tolerate it without too much distress if gentle and slow. And second is alcohol, which remains an absolute no and guarantees really intense issues which last for weeks. I also suspect some sort of friction issue closer to the urethra which might be set off by hot water (baths) or other kinds of sexual activity. Though I feel even more vague about this than the rest of what I'm saying, and is just me trying to connect the dots of the different sorts of pain I experience at different times. 

A side note - I try to avoid AZO even though it reduces my pain to almost nothing. I know others have mixed feelings about the risks posed by AZO, and I have taken those into account. I totally understand that for some, the potential risk is accepted in exchange for maintaining quality of life in the present. With that being said, I would love to find an alternative rescue med, and if anyone knows of any others, I would love to hear about them. Cystex does not seem to work for me but I haven't tried many others.

As ever with this illness, there have been several times I think I've found the root and then it all changes. But this is my progress as it stands. I hope you're all doing okay out there <3 If you're in a rough spot, trust that things can change in an instant, even if they've been bad for an unimaginable amount of time.",1,1755306725.0,Interstitialcystitis,1,1.0,False

People were polite, but I could tell they didn't really want me around.

Then I started paying attention to the people everyone gravitated toward. Turns out, likability isn't some mysterious talent just specific behaviors anyone can learn.

Here are the 7 things that changed everything for me:

1. Ask questions about them, not about yourself. Instead of ""I went to that restaurant too!"" try ""What did you think of the food there?"" People love talking about themselves when someone genuinely cares.
2. Remember small details from previous conversations. ""How did your sister's wedding go?"" or ""Did you finish that book you mentioned?"" Shows you actually listen instead of just waiting for your turn to talk.
3. Give genuine compliments on things they chose. Don't compliment looks compliment decisions and skills. ""That's such a good point"" or ""I love how you decorated this place."" They feel proud instead of just flattered.
4. Match their energy level (but stay slightly calmer) If they're excited, be interested. If they're upset, be concerned. But always stay 10% more composed. You become the stable person they feel good around.
5. Use their name in conversations. Not every sentence, but sprinkle it in. ""That's funny, Sarah"" or ""What do you think, Mike?"" People subconsciously love hearing their own name.
6. Be the first to help, last to judge (something most people fail to do). Offer to grab coffee when they're stressed. Don't give advice unless they ask. Just be useful and supportive without making it about you. Most of the time people want to be heard not to be lectured.
7. Admit when you don't know something ""I have no idea about that, tell me more"" is way more likable than pretending to know everything. People enjoy teaching someone who's genuinely curious. The ""I know it all attitude"" is seen as annoying and weird avoid it.

Make every interaction about making THEM feel good about themselves, not about making yourself look good.

What I wish I'd known earlier is likability isn't about being funny, smart, or impressive. It's about being genuinely interested in other people and making them feel heard.
