My parents were out most of the day shopping for a new washer & dryer while I was home so I had plenty of time and space to write 755 words for I'm Still Sisyphus. Not the marvellous height of yesterday but still, seven hundred is a wonderful number. The first scene is just a few paragraphs short of being done and I am very happy with it. I haven't work on the outline in a while because the story usually gets out of my hand and flings itself un an unforeseen direction every one in a while so I may as well figure out where is has gone before I decide where is it is going; in fewer words, I have planned for enough ahead for now.

I don't have much to tell you other than that bird of prey was back. Actually, I think it may be a different one. The last bird that nabbed on of our poor finches was a peregrine falcon I believe. This one was bigger, I'd call it a hawk. Mother spotted it first, standing beside the evergreen push beside the feeders where the birds hide, nothing yet caught in its talons. I ran out to shoo it away. We all need to eat but it does not need to eat here. The porch is a safe zone. We kept an eye out for it for a while, scaring it off when it got too close and watching it circle the neighbourhood and fly after birds before it flew over the neighbours house and disappearing. I put out one of our fake owls in the bush just on the slim chance it'll help. The birds never came back after that scare but hopefully we'll see them again tomorrow.

Also, the bunnies took a bite out if the apple tree. The snow has left them get high enough to nibble off a few branches. I am going to throw some cranberries out to try to get them to eat something else. Also Mother's rosemary finally died. It lived for a good two years, the longest we ever had one. We took come branches off it and rooted them so it will live on but the main plant has had a good run. We'll put the dead wood out and see if the bunnies will eat that instead.

Now, I have to gather the garbage before I get to relax for the night. I'm already exhausted but alas, the work must be done. I can't wait for my evening coffee.

My 8 year old breville dual boiler is still working (for now) but I’ve noticed recently when I hit the button to start extracting coffee, the pump seems kind of slow to start.

Ever looked at your bank account and thought, *""If I just had a little more, I’d finally feel secure""*? Here’s the truth: **Most of us are sitting on way more financial power than we realize—we’re just not using it the right way.**

Think about it:
- That $5 daily coffee habit? **$1,825 a year**—enough for a weekend getaway (or a serious emergency fund boost).
- The unused gym membership? **$800+ annually**—that’s a flight to Europe if you actually *wanted* to go.
- The ""just in case"" money sitting in a savings account earning *pennies*? **That’s your future retirement laughing at you.**

Here’s the kicker: **Small tweaks = big wins.** You don’t need a windfall—you need a *mindset shift*. Here’s how to start:

### **1. Audit Your ""Invisible"" Money**
- Track *every* dollar for a week. (Yes, even the 3 AM DoorDash order.)
- Ask: *""Does this bring me joy, or just guilt?""* Cut the guilt.

### **2. Make Your Savings Work Harder**
- A high-yield account? **Better.** Investing? **Even better.**
- **Pro tip:** You might be richer than you think—[find out how much your savings could really fund your retirement](https://mavely.app.link/e/Jw8ypIghuYb). (Spoiler: It’s probably more than you’d guess.)

### **3. Pay Yourself First (No Excuses)**
- Automate $50/week to savings. **That’s $2,600/year—without ""trying.""**
- Future You will *high-five* Present You.

### **4. Spend on What *Actually* Matters**
- Experiences > stuff. (Your 10th pair of sneakers won’t remember you.)
- Invest in skills, health, and relationships—they compound like interest.

**Bottom line:** Money isn’t about restriction; it’s about *freedom*. The question isn’t *""How much do I have?""*—it’s *""How much am I *using*?""*

I am in several other Discord servers with her as well but have not seen her message in months at this point. 

In October of 2024 I decided that I would try and help out, as I was led to believe she had some unfortunate personal things happen that caused her to need to use some of the money from active group buys to pay for things. She generally had a good track record in the past so I didn't really think anything was amiss. She had 3 ongoing group buys and one previous group buy with issues that she had stated would be fixed at a later date. These group buys were Acai, BaulT, Paintbrush, and uwu30 respectively. 

  
Acai and Bault were fulfilled. BaulT without issues aside from two PCBs that seemed to die randomly. Acai cosmetically had a few issues that were outside of my control as I had only purchased the PCBs for them. When it came time to ship Acai to customers, only some got shipped out and I was not told about the remaining ones, so I had to deal with annoyed customers asking why they'd not got tracking when I was under the impression that everything had been shipped out. Several of the brass cases also shipped with scratches or blemishes as well, which I was not happy about. (some customers also were unhappy about patina-ing, but the cases were stated to be raw brass from the start).

From there communication worsened. Previously the two of us had purchased a large amount of vintage keyboards from a vendor who had to shutdown, so I in addition to helping out with the current group buys was also paying for half of the storage unit to store the vintage boards in. 

By the end, in October of 2025. I was paying for the entirety of the storage unit and communication was basically non existent and basic tasks were not getting done. 

At this point uwu30 and Paintbrush remain unfulfilled. Fortunately I was able to gather the emails for those who purchased uwu30 and am working on fulfilling that group buy, though with the issue that some people had purchased a kit after the initial group buy had been fulfilled, but they had not received their cases, as CBKBD was holding on to them until there were replacement PCBs. Paintbrush remains unfulfilled and likely will stay that way unless I come into enough spare money to do that myself. 

The site for the shop remains up, but I do not recommend purchasing anything from it as you are unlikely to receive your item or any support for it. ",1,1767833537.0,MechanicalKeyboards,1,1.0,False

Calling a 16 year old child scum to his face because his relationship with your daughter ended is so unbelievably gross and disgusting. Lorelai herself admits in the scene before with Luke that she doesn’t know why they broke up because Rory refuses to tell her but I guess because this whole town has decided that Rory is a perfect Angel and nothing could ever be her fault then it must all be on Dean. And so what if Dean dumped her? Let’s even assume for a second that Dean dumped her because he no longer liked her, would that be so wrong? Would he then be deserving of the vitriol he gets? Only a few episodes back Luke attempted to beat him up for wanting to go inside Luke’s for some coffee. Let’s not also forget how Lorelai handled the whole car accident situation with Jess.

When we first started talking, just casually discussing working long days, You mentioned it's easy to come to work everyday when you have a good reason. 

I've spent the last 4 years climbing up the corporate ladder, started at the bottom and now I'm management. Thought I was looking for that reason to come to work everyday. Suddenly my job duties changed and I didn't have an excuse to see you everyday. Work turned back into being work. 

Thought my reason to come to work was to further my career, be the boss, make money, maybe even impress you with my stupid accomplishments. But I feel emptier than before and lonelier than ever. 

Turns out my reason had been you the whole time. The casual chats when I stopped at the dock, the daily teams messages, and your friendship are what was keeping me going. 

It took some time to admit, I had fallen hard for you. So when I asked if you wanted to grab coffee, and each time you are busy, and you never made an effort to make alternate plans, I took that as a sign you weren't interested. I had mistaken your friendliness as friendship. And why would you have been? You're a goddess, and I was just some chubby dude at work. 

So I got on the treadmill and I ran away from the fat version of me. Hundreds of miles ran. Thousands of miles biked. I was hopeful that you would see me. I didn't stop over for months because I didn't want you to see fat me anymore. I felt like you didn't want to see me. We were still in touch, chatting pretty regularly. 

The day I stopped over and visited, I was 45 lbs down. I was expecting a ""wow, you look great!"" Instead you didn't say anything, and I was crushed. I gave up.  I gained 20lbs back. I climbed into a hole and didn't come out for months. I got over you.

Just to fall for you again, 5 seconds after we talked again.

Now I don't know where things stand. I want to reach out to you everyday. Every single day you cross my mind. But I don't message. I don't reach out. I sit back and bottle up all this loneliness. When you reach out to me for help, I used to think  you were using that as an excuse to talk to me, because that's what I was doing. Any excuse I could have to reach out to you before I would use it. Eventually I got tired of making excuses and even said to you a few times, ""I don't feel like making an excuse, how's your day going"". And we would talk all day.  Referring to you as my favorite person in your department. So many friggin heart emojis from both of us. 

But now it feels different. I don't have a reason to reach out anymore, we never work together. I don't want to come across as a creep if I msg out of the blue. I feel like I've been trying really hard to keep this friendship going, and if I'm the only one ever messaging you, It feels really one-sided. 

I'm a different person now than I was before, and as much as I want to thank you for that, it was heartbreak that motivated me. I used to feel like you would be proud of the work I put in. Now that I know that it wasn't even enough for you to notice, all I feel is hurt now. 

As broken as I feel, deep in my heart I still wish you felt the same about me. 

So in the end I'm not avoiding you, I'm trying to get over you, because I know the second we talk, that I make some stupid joke, and I hear your laugh, I'm going to fall for you all over again.

My reason was you.

Genevieve glanced at the clock again. 1:03 a.m. The soft red digits glared at her from the bedside table, refusing to offer comfort. She had been pacing for what felt like hours, though she wasn’t sure it had been more than twenty minutes since she last checked the time. Her fingers twisted and pulled at each other with the precision of a nervous habit she had long cultivated, the motion giving her something tangible to focus on amidst the rising unease. Avalon was supposed to be back at eleven. She had said so herself. But eleven had come and gone, then twelve, then the slow creep of one in the morning. And still, Avalon was nowhere to be found.

Genny moved to the window, tugging aside the thin curtains and staring down at the nearly deserted street below. The soft hum of distant traffic only heightened the quiet loneliness of their shared apartment. Every creak of the floorboards, every muted thump of someone moving outside, made her jump slightly. Her well trained mind, usually so adept at parsing details and forming patterns, was now a relentless machine of speculation. Was Avalon stuck in traffic? Had she decided to go somewhere else after all? Why hadn’t she answered her messages?

The apartment felt colder than usual, as though the walls themselves were waiting for an explanation she couldn’t give. She hated the thought of letting herself worry, of succumbing to the imagined catastrophes her mind had started spinning. Yet, try as she might, she couldn’t.

Genny moved to the couch, seating herself carefully as though any sudden movement might shatter the quiet tension. She pulled her knees up and wrapped her arms around them, fingers still fidgeting, and reached for her cellphone. The screen glowed in the darkened living room, displaying the last call logs with Avalon’s name at the top. Her thumb hovered over the call button for a few seconds before she pressed it, the buzzing and ringing of the phone filling the otherwise empty apartment.

It rang once. Twice. And then went to voicemail. Genny’s brow furrowed, lips pressing into a thin line. She left a message, her voice slightly higher than usual, careful to maintain a tone that was polite but not too concerned. ""Avalon…it’s Genevieve. You said you’d be home by eleven. It’s now 1 a.m. Please call or text back when you can. Thank you."" 

The words felt awkward and stilted even to her own ears, but they were the best she could manage. She hung up, set the phone beside her, and let out another quiet breath. Her gaze wandered around the apartment, landing on the small stack of books she had abandoned on the coffee table, the faint crumbs on the counter from earlier snacks, the half finished cup of tea cooling in its mug. Everything looked normal but without Avalon, the space felt hollow, like the center of gravity had been removed from the room.

Genevieve stood again, walking slowly toward the window. She pressed her forehead against the cool glass, staring out into the dimly lit street below. Her mind ticked through possibilities, each one less comforting than the last. Maybe Avalon had gotten caught up with friends, maybe she had to study late, maybe–no, that one was too frightening to linger on. She shook her head and let out a sigh, leaning against the window frame, the reflection of her own anxious blue eyes staring back at her.

She tried to distract herself, reminding herself that she had papers to proofread, lectures to review, emails to send, but every time she opened a book or tapped at her laptop, her mind wandered back to the empty apartment and the absent roommate. She twisted her fingers again, the motion slow and methodical, her body a pendulum swinging between worry and the fragile hope that Avalon would appear any minute, laughing as if nothing had happened.

Minutes passed. The clock ticked. The apartment stayed silent. And still, Genevieve stood at the window, counting the seconds in her head, hoping and dreading that any sudden sound on the stairs might be the creak of Avalon’s return.

---

Avalon had stopped checking the time somewhere around midnight.

Not because she didn’t know what time it was, she did. Her phone screen kept lighting up in her hand, the glow burning against her palm like it was personally offended by her choices. She just didn’t care enough to let it ruin the momentum. The frat house was loud in that specific, bone rattling way that made thinking optional. Music thudded through the floorboards, bass heavy enough to vibrate up her legs, cups clinking, voices overlapping into one long, messy roar.

She leaned against the kitchen counter, red solo cup sweating into her fingers. Someone had spilled something sticky near the sink and the floor clung faintly to her shoes every time she shifted. Gross. Whatever. She took another sip anyway.

Her phone buzzed again.

She glanced down, thumb hovering over the screen.

**Genny (7 unread)**

Avalon groaned under her breath. ""Fucking christ,” she muttered, flipping the phone face down on the counter like that solved anything. She already knew what they said. *Where are you?* *Are you okay?* *You said you’d be back by eleven.* Like she needed the reminder. She’d said a lot of things tonight. Most of them were flexible.

She *had* meant to leave earlier. Kind of. At eleven, the party was still warming up, still tolerable. By one a.m., it had crossed into that chaotic sweet spot where everything felt slightly unreal and nobody was pretending they had their life together. Which, honestly, suited her just fine.

Avalon exhaled, dragging a hand through her hair. She’d text back in a second. Just something quick. *Still out. Don’t wait up.* Easy.

She unlocked her phone again, thumbs poised–

""Av""

She looked up just in time for Ronan to appear in her personal space, grinning like he’d just won something. He was short, shorter than her by a couple inches, with shaggy dark hair that always looked like it had lost a fight with a fan. There was a smear of something–marker? glitter?–on his cheek. He smelled like cheap beer and cologne.

""What,"" she said flatly, though she didn’t move away.

Ronan grabbed her wrist , not hard, just enough to get her attention and tugged. ""C’mon. You’re doing a thing.""

""I’m literally texting,"" Avalon protested, even as her phone nearly slipped from her hand.

""Nope,"" he said, already pulling her away from the counter. ""You’re doing a better thing.""

She stumbled slightly, catching herself with a muttered curse. ""You say that like it means something.""

""It does,"" Ronan insisted, weaving them through the crowd with surprising confidence. ""Roof.""

Her eyebrows shot up. “The roof?”

""Yeah. Don’t worry about it.""

""I *am* worried about it,"" she snapped, though she didn’t pull her hand free. The stairs creaked under their combined weight as they climbed, the music dulling with each step. Her phone buzzed again in her pocket this time, insistent.

She ignored it.

The door to the roof was already propped open, cold night air spilling in and raising goosebumps along her arms. The contrast hit her all at once, the noise fading behind them, replaced by laughter and the low hum of the city in the distance. A handful of people were already up there, clustered near the edge, someone passing around a bottle, someone else sitting cross legged on the concrete like they owned the place.

Ronan released her wrist with a flourish. ""See? Worth it.""

Avalon stepped forward, arms folding loosely over her chest as she took it in. The sky was dark, starless, but the city lights stretched out below them, messy and bright. For a moment, her chest tightened in a way she didn’t like.

She shoved the feeling down.

""This is illegal,"" she said.

Ronan beamed. ""You say that like it’s a bad thing.""

She huffed a laugh despite herself. ""You dragged me up here to commit a crime?""

""No,"" he said, digging into his pocket. ""I dragged you up here to help me prove something.""

She shot him a look. ""I don’t help with 'something.'""

Too late. He’d already produced a lighter and a small bundle of sparklers, the cheap kind you got around the Fourth of July. Avalon stared at them, unimpressed.

""…You’re kidding.""

""Just for a second,"" Ronan said quickly. ""We light ‘em, we wave ‘em, we feel alive, we put ‘em out. Boom. Memory.""

Avalon pinched the bridge of her nose. Her phone buzzed again. She didn’t need to look to know it was Genevieve. Waiting. Probably pacing. Probably mad. Or worried. Or both.

She exhaled slowly.

""You’re an idiot,"" she told Ronan.

He grinned wider. ""Yeah, but you like that.""

She snorted. ""Don’t flatter yourself.""

Still she took the sparkler from his hand.

""Thirty seconds,"" she said. ""Then I’m texting my roommate before she files a missing persons report.""

Ronan flicked the lighter. The sparkler caught with a hiss, bright and sharp in the dark. Avalon watched the sparks fly, reflected faintly in her eyes. Somewhere below, the city kept moving. Somewhere very far away, her phone buzzed again.


---


The click of the lock sounded louder than it had any right to.

Genevieve straightened immediately, spine snapping upright on the couch as the apartment door swung open. The clock on the microwave read **1:45 a.m.** in harsh green numbers. She had been sitting there for nearly forty minutes, unmoving, phone clutched loosely in her hands like it might ring again if she stared at it hard enough.

Avalon stepped inside like nothing was wrong.

Her jacket was slung halfway off one shoulder, hair slightly messy in that deliberate way that suggested she hadn’t cared enough to fix it. There was a faint smell of alcohol and cold night air clinging to her clothes. She kicked the door shut behind her with her heel, keys jangling as she tossed them into the bowl by the entryway.

""Hey,"" Avalon said casually, like it was noon instead of nearly two in the morning. ""You’re still up?""

Genevieve stared at her. The words left her mouth before she had time to soften them, to reconsider tone or phrasing like she usually did. ""What the hell, Avalon?""

Avalon paused mid step, one eyebrow lifting as she glanced toward the couch. ""What?""

""You said you’d be back at eleven,"" Genevieve continued, standing now. Her voice was controlled, but there was an unmistakable edge to it. ""You didn’t answer your phone. You didn’t text. It’s almost two in the morning.""

Avalon blinked, then laughed, a short breathy sound that made something in Genevieve’s chest twist sharply. ""Dude. Relax. I lost track of time. It’s not that serious.""

""It *is* serious,"" Genevieve shot back, taking a step forward before she caught herself. She stopped, hands clenching instead. ""You live here. You said you’d be home. I didn’t know if something had happened to you.""

Avalon shrugged out of her jacket and draped it over a chair. ""Nothing happened. See? I’m fine.""

""That doesn’t–"" Genevieve cut herself off, inhaling sharply through her nose. She hated this part. Hated how her thoughts came out too fast, too blunt, once she crossed a certain threshold. ""That doesn’t mean I wasn’t worried.""

Avalon finally looked annoyed. ""Why would you be worried? I’m an adult, Genny. I went out. People do that.""

Genevieve flinched slightly, ""You could have told me,"" she said instead. ""That’s all. A text would have taken ten seconds.""

Avalon scoffed, kicking off her shoes. ""Jesus. You’re acting like I disappeared for three days.”

Genevieve’s jaw tightened. The words pressed against her tongue before she could stop them. ""You were reckless and that was stupid.""

Avalon froze, turning slowly to face her fully now. ""Excuse me?""

“No, I don’t mean—” Genevieve faltered, frustration bleeding into her voice. ""I didn’t mean you.""

""You literally just called me stupid,"" Avalon said flatly.

Genevieve’s hands clenched at her sides. ""I meant the decision,"" she said quickly, voice tight. ""Going out, staying late, not answering your phone–""

""So me,"" Avalon said. ""You meant me.""

""I was worried!"" Genevieve snapped, then immediately looked away, ""You make reckless choices and I don’t know how to not think about everything that could go wrong!""

Avalon huffed, ""Wow. So now I’m reckless and stupid?"" 

""That’s not–"" Genevieve inhaled sharply, visibly struggling to recalibrate. “I didn’t mean it like that. I shouldn’t have said that.""

Avalon crossed her arms, posture immediately defensive. ""You’re not my mom.""

""I know that,"" Genevieve snapped, then immediately winced. She dragged a hand through her hair, fingers catching slightly as if grounding herself. ""That’s not what I’m trying to be.""

""Then stop acting like it,"" Avalon shot back. ""You’re freaking out over nothing.""

Genevieve stared at her, something sharp flashing behind her eyes. ""I wasn’t freaking out.""

""You were pacing,"" Avalon said flatly. ""You called me. Left a voicemail. You’re sitting on the couch like you’ve been waiting for me all night. That’s–"" She gestured vaguely. ""That’s a lot.""

Genevieve’s fingers curled into fists at her sides. ""I was worried,"" she repeated, slower this time, as if saying it carefully might make it land differently. ""There is a difference.""

Avalon rolled her eyes. “You’re acting like a freak, Genny.”

The word hit harder than Genevieve expected.

Her breath caught, just barely, but it was enough. She looked away immediately, gaze dropping to the floor between them. For a moment, neither of them spoke. The apartment felt smaller somehow, the walls closing in with the weight of unspoken things.

""I’m not a freak,"" Genevieve said quietly.

Avalon sighed, rubbing a hand over her face. ""I didn’t mean it like that. I just...look, you can’t control everything. You can’t monitor where I am or what time I get home.""

""I’m not trying to control you,"" Genevieve replied, voice tight. ""I just wanted to know you were safe.""

Avalon hesitated, her expression shifting from irritation to something closer to uncertainty. ""You gotta chill,"" she said finally. ""I’m fine. Nothing bad happened. Next time, I’ll text or whatever. But you can’t spiral like that.""

Genevieve swallowed. She nodded once, stiffly, though the knot in her chest hadn’t loosened at all. ""Fine.""

Avalon grabbed a bottle of water from the fridge and headed toward her room. ""I’m going to bed.""

""Goodnight,"" Genevieve said automatically, the words flat.

The bedroom door closed a moment later, leaving Genevieve alone in the living room standing where she was, fingers twisting together once more, wondering when caring had started to feel like something she needed to apologize for.

The silence felt heavier now, no longer charged with anger but with the dull ache that followed it. The clock still glowed an accusing **1:52 a.m.** She hated that she’d let it get this far. Hated that the word  had slipped out of her mouth so easily, sharp and careless, when what she’d meant was *I was scared*.

Eventually, she reached for the lamp and flicked it off. The room sank into darkness, familiar but suddenly unwelcoming. Genevieve stood there for a moment, arms wrapped around herself, then turned and walked down the short hallway to her bedroom.

She shut the door quietly behind her.

The moment she reached the bed, all composure vanished. She kicked off her shoes without bothering to place them properly and flopped onto the mattress, landing flat on her back. The ceiling stared back at her, blank and unhelpful, the faint glow of streetlights bleeding through the curtains in uneven shapes.

Her chest felt tight.

Genevieve blinked, then blinked again. Her eyes burned, vision blurring just enough to be irritating. She pressed her lips together, annoyed at herself for even getting close to crying. It wasn’t like anything catastrophic had happened. Avalon was fine. She was safe. That was supposed to be the end of it.

So why did it still hurt?

She lifted a hand to her face, dragging it down slowly. Her fingers trembled just a little. She hadn’t meant to sound controlling. She hadn’t meant to sound cruel. She just didn’t know how to say *I care about you* without it coming out wrong.

A soft knock broke the quiet.

Genevieve stiffened.

There was a pause, then the door creaked open just a few inches. ""Hey…Gen?""

Avalon’s voice was quieter than before. Careful.

Genevieve didn’t answer, but she didn’t tell her to go away either.

The door opened fully. Avalon stepped inside, the light from the hallway framing her for a moment before she reached back and shut it behind her. She hovered awkwardly near the foot of the bed,

""I’m sorry,"" Avalon said after a beat. ""For not calling. I should’ve. I didn’t think.""

Genevieve swallowed.

She shifted slightly, scooting over to one side of the bed without looking at her. It was a small invitation, hesitant but unmistakable. Avalon took it.

She crossed the room and flopped down beside her, the mattress dipping under her weight. For a second, they lay there stiffly, shoulder to shoulder but not touching, both staring at the ceiling like it held answers neither of them knew how to ask for.

""I shouldn’t have called you a freak,"" Avalon added, voice quieter now. ""That was… shitty.""

Genevieve let out a slow breath. ""I shouldn’t have called you stupid,"" she replied. Her voice wavered despite her effort to keep it steady. ""I didn’t mean you. I just…panic.""

""I know,"" Avalon said softly. ""I get it. I’m not great at…updating people.""

Silence settled again, but this time it felt gentler. Genevieve turned her head just enough to look at Avalon. Her eyes were still glossy, lashes damp. ""I don’t want to control you,” she said. “I just–when people don’t come back...""

Avalon’s expression softened. ""I didn’t think about that."" She rolled onto her side then, facing the redhead fully. Without asking, she leaned in and wrapped an arm around Genevieve’s shoulders, pulling her close. Genevieve hesitated for only a second before melting into it, her hands clutching weakly at the fabric of Avalon’s shirt

The hug was tight, grounding, the kind that pressed the breath out of her chest in the best way. ""I’m sorry,"" they both murmured at nearly the same time.

Avalon huffed a quiet laugh. ""We suck at this."" Genevieve let out a small, shaky sound that might’ve been a laugh too.

They shifted until they were more comfortable, Avalon rolling onto her back again but staying close, her head settling naturally against Genevieve’s shoulder. Genevieve tilted slightly to accommodate her, resting her cheek against the top of Avalon’s head.

The room was quiet now, peaceful in a way it hadn’t been earlier. Neither of them spoke again. They didn’t need to.

They just lay there, breathing in sync, the tension of the night slowly unraveling as sleep crept closer, Avalon’s weight warm and familiar against Genevieve’s side.

1q6x8y6,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodylanguage/comments/1q6x8y6/did_i_misread_everything/,Did I misread everything?,"I’m good friends with a very friendly, slightly introverted guy. We usually only hang out in group settings. One night, we went to an event together, and he had to drop me off pretty late. I joked about how coffee places should be open 24/7, and he casually offered to make me some at his place. Since we’re close friends, I didn’t think much of it. I’ll admit I’ve caught feelings for him, but I’ve been careful not to act on them because I don’t want to disrupt the friendship or our group dynamic.

This ended up being the first time we hung out one on one. At his place, I grabbed the coffee and sat on the couch. He’s always been very respectful and mindful of boundaries, so I expected him to sit across from me but instead, he sat next to me. I wasn’t very covered, and the closeness caught me off guard. We sat facing each other. At one point, another friend briefly stopped by to drop something off. Later, she told me the room felt noticeably tense.

I’m naturally awkward, so I avoided eye contact most of the time. Still, I noticed from the corner of my eye that whenever I spoke, he was looking directly at me. At one point, I mentioned that guys don’t usually like me back, so I don’t really try anymore. He responded by saying there’s a lot to like which I assumed was him being his typical friendly self.

I kept assuming he wasn’t interested in me romantically and that I might even be imposing. It felt like I was all up in his space. After about an hour of talking, I apologized for taking up his time, and he drove me home.

Now it feels like he’s sorta being awkward around me. He still talks to me but it feels weird. Later, I found out he’s been actively dating other women after all this, which made me wonder if I had imagined the tension altogether and read too much into everything.

I said no, I'm not comfortable watching a child I dont know. She seemed shocked and said ""come on, your already watching one kid, whats one more? I'll buy you a coffee.""

I said no again. She got annoyed and said ""ugh fine I guess I'll just take him with me then"" like I was being difficult.

She left with her kid but came back 10 minutes later without him. She just dropped him off at the trampoline park and left. I guess she assumed I'd watch him anyway?

1q6x7lv,https://www.reddit.com/r/thyroidhealth/comments/1q6x7lv/looking_for_confirmation/,Looking for Confirmation,"Hey Everyone 

  
I've asked several AI chat bots the same question but they have given varyign responses os i thoguht it was always better to check here since you guys would know more about this situation than I do.

  
for context my mom has Hypothyroidism and was diagnsoed with it a little more than 20 years ago, the doctor reccomended her iodized salt and she began using it in our food for along time. When i was around 16 my family switched to pink salt because they assumed natural must be better, i didnt think much fo this change but three years layter i realized it may have had profund consequneces on me.

I was very out going person, alot of people liked me, i was really witty i was into debate, I knew how to talk to everybody, these skills werent entirely natursal during covid lockdown I spent alot of time on self improvement and improving my social skills to make sure i was excellant in that feild. I also had this unrelenting physical energy, confidence and was a bit reckless.

  
but around the time of the switch little by little and then really fast everything I built fell, I became: 

SO PARANOID, afriad of confrontation, very super stistious, black and white views and extrememely pessemistic, suicidal over VERY SMALL things, I became afraid of otehr peoples opinions which I never had before I used te be pretty narcisstic and i started day dreamign and zoning out like crazy 

Physically My hands got alot more cold and i shivered alot and felt sleepy all the time, could not focus on work, my heart beat became ALOT slowerr and I needed stronger stimuli to get horny, I could not sleep, I wasted time and had terrible time management

in 2024 my avg sleep was 4 hrs full year

I knew soemthign was wrong but I never did a full investigation for along time I just kind of let it happen.

Also i feel its important to note and I might get flack for this, but I lost alot of my masculine traits during this time, people started to think i was feminine and I stopped acting like a man im 100% sure there was lowered T before istg I was the exact opposite

so for last year of high school, first year of uni I was so messed up I lost all my friedns and mande no new ones, had zero hobbies besides porn and doomscrolling

However at start fo Uni i started drinkign black coffee, IDK why but it temporarily made me unlock my old self until its started to stop working

  
However it wa sonly after i started drinking two glasses of 2% milk which in canada each galss has about 60% RDA of iodine to meet the bare minimum, i noticed way less day dreaming more willingness to improve and socialize with others and workout, and watch shows and live more and take more necessary risks.

  
Then after doing that fro four months my family started buyign iodized salt again and I noticed big chnages, my heart got faster im warmer in my hands again and in my body and I have stronger workouts, more optimistic and feel MUCH less anxiety

  
however I still have not retunred to the person I was in the oast its frustrating I have never dealt with anxiety or being to afraid to public speak before or raise my hand in class or have low confidence or struggle to watch a show, sometimes my voice is deep and other times its higsh around people its SO FRUSTURATING, I always have this background anxiety thats always humming at varyign levels in the back.

However I regulalry eat now like 400 ug of iodine or sometimes push near upper limit its a bit random and varies day to day

My main concerns are that if im missing something, or that I have messed something up by reintroducing ioidne, did pink salt leave any permanent damage and is my anxiety thing normal? Is any of this Really medically posisble I still find it hard to belive that salt could cause this

I am also curious about what the next steps should be.

for refernece I am 19 years old almost 20 and I stopped iodized salt when I was 16 but almost 17

everyone in my family was 18 and above and did not experince any chnages during my defincey period, my dad still has trouble believing me

I have a remote job where I got really close to one of my co workers. We are always messaging during the day, usually about work related things. This co worker has shared with me that they are struggling with depression, but I’ve never brought up Jesus to them.

A few weeks ago we met up for coffee, and they shared even more about their struggles with me. I chickened out because this co worker is quite a liberal person, and I knew they’d reject the message I would share about Jesus. 

Well, my conscience has been eating me alive because I feel that I should’ve brought it up (isn’t that what Jesus requires of us?) so when we were chatting yesterday, they brought up their depression again.

Since Jesus healed me from depression a few years ago, I decided to share with my co worker via our usual private chat about how He renewed my mind, and healed me. Mind you, I was very respectful and tried to sound supportive so I didn’t condemn or anything like that. It was just me sharing my experience and telling them I believe there’s hope that they’ll be healed. 


They were receptive at first and the conversation flowed a bit, until they started to become closed off and said that I was preaching to them. I told them I’d be respectful and back off, and attempted to change the topic. 

Well, they never ended up responding to me after that. And now, even though I feel like I did the right thing for Jesus, I don’t know if I took it too far. Now my spirit is disturbed and I’m worried this person will report me or something. 

What do you all think? Please pray for me.",2,1767833034.0,TrueChristian,5,1.0,False

Big sur (Shanghai, China) - My favorite Loring profile! A lot of their coffees ended up being my favorites from last year I've had a lot of coffee from them and will buy pretty much anything I can from them. Great sourcing & roasting.

Other favorites (also in no particular order)

Exposure Therapy (Singapore) - Really great roasting. Very distinct profile that highlights notes I don't typically expect. Great clarity and flavor definition. Some of my favorite coffees this year came from him. Also insane how well he's doing considering he's a teen! 

XLIII (Da Nang, Vietnam) - Real unique approach to roasting that requires many months of rest, but remains soluble and easy to brew. Not every coffee has been a favorite of mine, but all of them have been good. Some have been exceptional. 

Datura (Paris, France) - Another great roaster with a unique style. It's more of a nordic light kind of roast, but needs a while to open up (I usually wait 6 weeks minimum). But the approach highlights the fruit & sweet notes, while maintaining high clarity and a complex presentation.

Nai zui (Shanghai, China) - Great stronghold roaster. I'm particular fond of their more recent roasts. On the more developed end of an ultralight roast, with a very tea like and linear presentation

Gout & co (Chengdu, China) - I’ve had a lot of coffees from Gout. They've trended a bit darker recently, but we still really like most of the coffees we've had from them, especially their Ethiopians!

H&s (Laramie, US) - I'm on their sub and have tried quite a few coffees from them. They had a few misses earlier in the year, but most of their coffees are great. 

Sey (New York, US) - This one was sort of a surprise for me. I honestly wasn't a big fan of Sey for a while, but I had a lot of great coffees from them last year. The standouts for me were their Kenyan varietal separation lots and their alo coffees. 

Scenery (London, UK) - My second favorite loring roaster! Love the profile. Honestly, sort of similar to Big Sur's profile, but a touch more developed. Somewhere between light and Ultralight. My favorite processed coffees this year came from them, and I loved the Kenyan, Ethiopian, & Ecuadorian coffees I've had from them. I only had one dose of the Mario Hervas Honey Mejorado, but if I had more of it, it might have been one of my favorite coffees last year. Seriously great stuff.


Some roasters I want to try more from

Purus (Vietnam) - Had some great coffees from them (including the best viet grown coffee I've ever tried). Had a few misses, but definitely want to drink more from them!

Coffee with Dongze (Berkley, US) - Had a few samples that I probably drank too early 😅 the collab we did was awesome. Took a while to open up though. Excited to try more from them! 

Thankfully (us) - Had some awesome coffees and some misses. Mostly tried samples, so I need to buy more bags from them! 

Base coat (portland, us) - Love what they're trying to do. They gave us some samples and they were good, but not great. Really enjoyed the Nordic profile they have though. Excited to try more from them this year!

Neem (portland, us) - Similar to basecoat, really like what they're going for. Tried some samples that were fine, but need to try their more recent roasts 

Cozy Monster (Bellevue, us) - Finally a good roaster in Washington! Had a lot of their coffee at their shop, but need to brew more of their stuff

Hedou (china) - had a sample of their coffee and loved it. More of a developed light roast (like hydrangea level?) Really hard to get, so hopefully I can connect with them! 

Coffee with tsuki (china) - Also had a sample of them that was really good. Very light coffee. I've talked with them a bit, but they're in high demand already and sell out super fast in China.

Frukt (Turku, Finland) - Had some awesome coffees from them last year (all Benjamin paz stuff). Maybe my favorite nordic roaster?

CETO (Keyport, US) - Had some great coffees from them. Good range too. Nice clean coffees and really well done co ferments.

Aviary (Cleveland, US) - Only got 2x bags from them last year, but liked them both. Had a few awesome samples too

Gwo (Eindhoven, NL) - have 2 coffees from them resting. Really excited about their project and will be buying more this year!

Still (Den Haag, NL) - had some awesome samples from them. Met up in Den Haag and had a nice conversation. Looking forward to more coffee from them. 

20grams (Singapore) - have a few coffees from them now that are solid. The chiroso I got from them is amazing. The others were solid, but not as good. Still good enough to want to order from again soon

Aery (Busan, South Korea) - possibly my favorite Korean roaster so far. Really good sourcing and pretty light roasts

Norml/minmax - I've had a decent amount of coffee from them. They sorta rebranded, so I'm excited to see what they've got planned for the year. Already jumped on the norml sub lol

Have you tried any of them? What do you think about them? Who were your favorites? Here's to another year of great coffee :)

I floss everyday after breakfast and dinner, and brush my teeth (and tongue) and use mouthwash (no alcohol). I go for dental hygiene appointments regularly. I don’t drink or smoke or drink coffee after brushing my teeth. I don’t have tonsil stones but I do get some post nasal drip which I think a lot of people can if they have allergies. Not sure if the post nasal drip is enough to cause bad breath all the time. 

I keep noticing it when people scratch their noses when I talk to them but I’m not sure if there is some bias affecting the way I see this because of my fear or a valid concern. I’m a bit too shy to ask since most of the people I talk to are my coworkers and not personal friends. I do have ADHD and over think sometimes.

Does anyone know if nose scratching is a common thing people do when talking or if it’s usually a sign of a problem? I often scratch mine too because sometimes I’m worried I might have something on my face or nose so maybe they’re all doing the same?? 🤔 ",2,1767832928.0,bodylanguage,1,1.0,False

1q6x13o,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q6x13o,booboo dont touch me <3,"tw: discussion of a guy being creepy

hi everyone I had a pretty nice day today I got to see my friend who I haven't see since the holidays. and we had such an awesome time hanging out it's good to have friends for sure. we were going to go to our favourite bar just before it opens at 5pm but turns out it was actually closed so we just stood outside and looked at it. and at this hour with the colour of the sky and the lonely bar with the lights off it looked real poetic to me and actually made me kind of emotional. i don't actually go that much but i tend to associate so much community and safety with this bar, attributes that actually really aren't in many places i find. in my mind it's a place that's always open and available, flowing with lights, warmth, people and energy. it's so easy for me to be there, they do dance events and the like but really I just like talking to people in the smoking area. I feel so confident there. but tonight it was closed, a woman leaving the bar with a tiny sausage dog told us it's closed for a few days. but it was okay because the bar just stood there looking wistful at me and I looked back and I felt like I was looking at a painting of the bar. I really can't explain the way it felt any better unfortunately! but It was nice.

so instead we sat at a bench for a bit and had a cigarette, then decided to go to spoons. I got the cheapest drink on the menu, a htot cholate! since woke government regulations u can't do free hot cholate refil but you can get a mug with a galaxy hot collate sachet in it and fill it up with lattee and it's really nice and then afterwards you can just get a regular coffee which is disappointing but it's something. anyways, skint as I am, I was so excited to sit in this warm place for a while and just get coffee refills. £1.89 is a small price to pay for a nice vibe like that. and we were having a nice time clowning About and admiring this fucking amazing paper weight I bought today for an astonishingly low price which nevertheless still bankrupted. me I love this paper weight so much and saw it in the shop but no no I can't buy it don't be ridiculous but I did anyway because it was made for me. it's 2 seals enclosed in a tiny globe, maybe they're lovers or just friends but they'r e so fucking awesome, theyre kind of abstract and alien looking which really appeals to me for obsvious reasons. they are pictured in the photos attatched to this post, taken by my friend

anyway we were having a good time literally just spinning this thing and looking at it from different angles. but turns out there was a really creepy guy sat behind us for a while. I didn't know this because my back was turned but my friend told me that he was staring at us for a long time and making suggestive faces. I went to get another coffee and I got a glimpse of this guy and omg he was actually really creepy like the way he looked at me my blood just ran cold super quick idk i'm never a judgemental person but he did not seem pleasant. and it felt really violating to know that he'd been staring the whole time. I felt all comfortable and happy and it was like immediately drained out of me as soon as I found out I was literally being watched. also didn't help that I was caffeinated! so I got panicky and anxious, and we agreed to leave the spoons and go somewhere else. i hope people can understand where i'm coming from here and don't think im overreacting, it's nnot like me being mean or getting upset for no reason, i have had bad past experiences from people like this before and we both genuinely felt rlly uncomfortable. I was a lil shaken but I thought I was fine until a little later I just started feeling so angry. i'm not an angry person at all, I get really angry like once every few months but omg I felt it then. and being a non angry person I find it incredibly hard to deal with and process when such feelings arise. I felt so destabilised and itchy and uncomfortable and like I wanted to play really loud on  a drum kit. but there was no drumkit to hand so I was just upset. I ended up buying an overpriced drink and some chips and then felt a little better. i'm okay now but it just really annoys me how hard it can be to exist as a woman in public spaces sometimes! like the way u can feel at ease somewhere and someone can easily just ruin it for you by making you feel unsafe.

all things considered, the rest of the night was pretty decent and we laughed a lot, it is really good to have friends.  the trouble is I started feeling a little manic. I don't know if i'm a manic person but sometimes I feel like it. the rest of the few days has been pretty crazy, everything heightened. I get these massive emotional peaks and then lows right after. I've been trying so hard recently to make a good life for myself and I think I've been doing a decent enough job. I try to take care of myself and love myself, but sometimes I still feel like doing self destructive things. this stupid bar starting playing this awful Volkswagen car advert rock music and at first I hated it obviously but then it started to make me feel like oh I wish I was in a just horrible dive bar getting hit on by a just horrible guy right now. No!! I don't want that!! deserve to be taken care of and treated right ! but it's so tricky. hope someone can understand how I feel. thanks for reading this far.

some  musics I listened to for the first time recently and liked they are all  so cool and spacey music so eheteral LOVE IT!:

1q6x0v5,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1q6x0v5/chronic_pain_management_number_of_health/,Chronic pain management. Number of health professionals and appointments per month? Affordability? Missing out.,"Hi fellow chronic pain warriors. I’ve read on here that a lot of us can relate to feeling like our life is just about appointments, seeing health professionals, attending the pharmacy, advocating for the right support, dealing with insurance companies or Workcover, paperwork, getting tests done and it all feels like a full-time job.

So if you are willing to share, I am wondering how many appointments you have per month to see health professionals? That includes going to see Allied health professionals like physiotherapy, remedial massage and attending the pharmacy, pathology clinics to get regular blood work and radiologists to get regular scans ? And also the number of health professionals that you have to see per month. And affordability? how much does it roughly cost for you per month or even per year? Because when I tell my friends how much money I used to spend just to manage my chronic pain, they are shocked! I think I used to  spend about  AU$1000 per month, sometimes  more at the start of my journey. But I have had to cut some of my appointments and go without due to affordability. So instead of seeing a physiotherapy weekly or fortnightly, I only see them once a month now. 

I see my doctor at least 2 to 3 times in a month. Get bloodwork done every 3-6 mo. I go to the pharmacist every fortnight because my medication comes in a labelled pack so I don’t forget taking it. I see a physiotherapist, remedial massage once a month. And separately from that, I see a jaw physiotherapist once a month. I see my pain specialist once every three months. I see a pain psychologist once a month. 

I used  to see a neurologist, rheumatologist, vascular surgeon, endocrinologist, cardiologist, 0pthalmogist, orthopaedic  surgeon but they  have exited me from their care now. As they can’t do more for me. I see an oral maxillofacial surgeon for my Tmj as I’m due for two surgeries coming up soon. But just every four months. Are used to see an acupuncturist, osteopath, podiatrist and , excercise physiologist  at least once a month but I can’t afford them anymore so I’ve stopped. 

I think I now roughly spend about AU$300-$500 An appointment per month now. But sometimes I cancel my appointments if I can’t afford it. I don’t work and where I am in Australia, we have something called income protection insurance so that’s what I’ve been living off for the last five years and I’ve also been approved total and permanent disability where you get a lump sum payment so you can live and afford life if you can’t ever work again back to your area of profession.  And that’s the case for me. 

It would help me and my family get by for now  but we still have to be careful about how much we spend money and still really budget my appointments. I go without seeing my friends because sometimes I can’t go out for coffee or a meal so I can save that money on my appointments and daily living expenses. And sometimes I have to cancel anyway because I’m in too much pain to see them. 

I know I am luckier than most because I have heard from other chronic pain people that some of them have to skip meals, or not go to their appointments at all because they can’t afford their mortgage, rent, bills. Or are homeless because they can’t afford to live! I am lucky I’m not at that point. And i feel so sad hearing these stories! it’s so unfair for so many. 

And they wonder why some people with chronic pain have a poor quality of life, want to end things  and somehow still expected to just live and survive and not complain. 

Anyway. Rant over.

I'm looking for something I can use more regularly without needing a prescription or dealing with customs. modafinil is great for occasional use but using it multiple times a week builds tolerance fast and the sleep disruption isn't worth it for me anymore.

I've tried most of the typical stack stuff, racetams, alpha gpc, phenylpiracetam when I could find it. some helped marginally but nothing compared to the focus you get from real smart drugs.

1q6wy4n,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q6wy4n,I need help furnishing my living room,"Hi everyone! I just moved into this apartment not too long ago and I’m trying to find the right furniture to go with what I already have. 
Since the rugs colors are so bold I’m thinking the colors should tie into that. 

I was thinking of putting tall display shelves along both sides of the tv, I plan on getting at least one accent chair, more lamps and ambient lighting, wall decor, and plants. I think I’m going to redo the curtains as well. 

Can anyone help me find furniture like a coffee table, for example, that kind of ties in to this warm brown reddish blue. I don’t want too plain I want to make it look clean but eccentric i think?! Idk please help

The pause between thoughts.  
The quiet where reactions used to rush in and fill everything.

It’s strange, realizing I don’t wake up bracing anymore.  
No rehearsed conversations before coffee.  
No immediate scan of my chest to see what still hurts today.  
But nothing has rushed in to replace that either.

I move through the day feeling half-assembled.  
Like the version of me who knew exactly what she was missing packed up and left,  
and the version who knows what she wants hasn’t arrived yet.

I don’t ache the same way.  
But I don’t feel steady either.  
There’s just this soft disorientation.  
As if I stepped off a moving walkway and my body hasn’t caught up to the stillness.

I keep expecting clarity to show up with an announcement.  
A sentence that lands and rearranges everything.  
Instead, it’s been quieter than that.  
More like forgetting to check my phone for someone who used to live there.

Sometimes I wonder if this is what healing actually looks like.  
Not relief.  
Not closure.  
Just fewer sharp edges and more unanswered time.

I don’t miss you the way I used to.  
But I also don’t know what to do with the room that’s left behind.  
It’s not empty.  
It’s unfinished.

And maybe that’s the hardest part, standing in the middle of something incomplete,  
without the urgency that pain used to give me.

hey guys! i am new to this subreddit so I haven’t looked around here to see what’s available but i wanted to submit this post i made just in case before i looked around!! 

i am desperately needing some fanfics rn so I made a list of some key plot points that i’d love to read, and if any of you have any recs please leave the links below! thanks!! 💛💙 (preferably no WIPs, happy ending) 

1. will confronting mike about telling el that his life started the day he met her in the woods (i think we all collectively moved past that too quickly like what the fuck) 
2. honestly will blowing up on mike for being a douche bag in general and mike having to grovel at his feet for forgiveness 🫶
3. jealous/possessive mike. that’s it that’s the comment. self explanatory 
4. white girl wasted will flirting with mike while drunk then forgetting about it the next day, going back to hiding his feelings like normal. this causing mike to actually spiral out of control bc gay panic until he finally confesses his feelings 
5. coffee shop au’s! or any au where one boy works somewhere and the other visits and becomes a regular after developing a crush. bonus points if the worker is will and he’s lowkey annoyed by mike at first until he develops a crush later 
6. cowboy will? is that a thing? it should be a thing. someone write it. i read the one where mike falls off of his fence into will’s yard and he’s kind of a cowboy in that one and i LOVED IT 
7. coworker byler flirting!! good god please. 
8. radio tower fix its! 
9. ANY AND ALL SEASON 5 FIX ITS especially ones with byler/creelby parallels and where will’s connection to the hive is much more significant. i need angst, i need possessed will hurting mike, i need fake out deaths, i need mike crash outs. i need gay love to save the day and i need mikes love for will to save will!!!!!!! like helloooo
10. conformity gate fics? why not. i like the idea. 
11. MIKE BEING VECNAD PLEASE mike needed to get vecnad bad idc how it happens it just needs to happen 
12. el going into will’s head and seeing his fatty embarrassing crush on mike and literally not giving a fuck about it, breaking up with mike right after if she hadn’t already 
13. byler is established but will still thinks that mike likes el, kind of like “you’re with me because you can’t have her anymore” type beat. obviously he’s proven wrong 
14. college au’s where they meet in college! bonus points if they ARENT roommates (it gets boring) 
15. mike finding out that he was will’s first love from will’s boyfriend INJECT ITTT
16. art museum date. mikes idea period. 
17. miwi meeting byler?? i read that one fic Landslide where little mile humbled the fuck out of old mike and i need more of whatever that is 
18. johnathan confronting mike about treating will like shit! bonus points if in his anger he accidentally outs wills feelings for him

After way too many late nights and probably too much coffee, I finally finished this absolute beast of a character sheet.

It's got pretty much everything I could think of - spellbooks for all the base classes, common buff tracking, auto-calculations for... well, basically anything that *can* be auto-calculated. You can add weapons and roll d20+modifiers by just clicking on them (same goes for stats and skills). There's also a custom dice roller built in, and the spellbook has descriptions for most spells.

It's made for 3.5e. If anyone wants to try it out, you can sign up with email or Google. Would love to hear what you think!

First, you order your coffee / food at a counter and they give you a number and you take a seat.

There is a saying in Finland: “A loved child has many names.” That sentiment perfectly describes Finland’s beloved coffee bread.

A hands-on baking workshop will be held from 10 a.m. until 1:30 p.m. Saturday, Jan. 25, at the Finnish Center at Saima Park, 67 Scott Road.

Across Finland today, the soft, lightly sweetened cardamom bread is commonly known as pulla. It appears in countless variations – filled with caramel, vanilla cream, pistachio, almond butter, strawberry jam, and more – “yet it is all still lovingly called pulla,” said Finland native Saija Laurla, who will be teaching the workshop.

In western Finland, however, the same bread is traditionally known as nisu, while other regional dialects refer to it as vehnänen. The term kahvileipä once described any sweet accompaniment served with coffee, though more often than not, it meant pulla.

“For some bakers, nisu is the braided version of this delicacy,” Laurla said. “Others like to keep it to its original vocabulary form — derived from the world nisa, meaning ‘breast’ — when it’s round and resembles an American dinner roll.”

During this hands-on workshop, participants will prepare and bake the dough and create either pulla or nisu.

“If there is enough interest in its cinnamon-scented cousin, we will also bake korvapuusti, which are Finnish cinnamon rolls,” Laurla added.

Please let them know whether you would like to make pulla, nisu or korvapuusti and they will plan accordingly.

Laurla believes that the name is just as important to cherish as the product.

“Whichever name you use, we invite you to celebrate it with us — and bake it,” she said with a smile.

The cost for the workshop is $25 for Finnish Center at Saima Park members; $30 for non-members. Please note that there is a maximum attendance of 40 participants.

**(a little winded tone)** Ah, the climb through your bedroom window never ceases to test my athletic abilities, dear, but no fear, soon you shall be letting me in through the front door. \**light footsteps\** Oh, you look so wonderful and serene when you lie there in your bed, with your eyes closed.  It’s somewhat of a pity that I can’t see those pretty eyes but seeing you resting so soundless and at peace, I can forgive you for not letting me see them.

Did you have a good day today? Or would you have called today a good day? I wouldn’t have, for I didn’t get to see you all day, only half of it. It’s only a good day to me when we get to spend all of it together *\*rustling sounds as the speakers goes to touch the listener’s hands\** Hmm, your hands feel so soft, did you put on lotion before bed my dear?  I mean, I guess it was an okay day as I know you got to spend some time with me today, but it was still not the whole day, you know? However, that will change too, soon. *\*caresses the listener’s cheek\** Soon we will be able to actually spend all the time in the world together and it will be perfect, I just know it.

 *\*sighs contentedly*\* You know, I just can’t decide if you look more beautiful awake or sleeping. Awake I can see your eyes, but asleep I can see the way your body moves with each breathe you take.  \**rustlings sounds*\* Oh? Are you dreaming? **(whispers)** What are you dreaming about? Is it about me? \**giggles\** I sure do hope so.  For it will make things a lot easier if you would just dream about me, although if not, it’s no worries my sweet. I’ll make sure by the end of the night you are dreaming about me in one way or another. Hmm. So, let’s take a peep inside shall we? Don’t worry, we’ve done this before, I will make sure it doesn’t hurt you. Just let me look into your dreams, just like how we’ve done it before, my dear.

*\*gently places a hand on the listener’s forehead and an eerie sound is heard\** Aaahh…yes. Your dream world. Hmm, now let me see what it is that you were just dreaming about *\*laughs*\* I hope it’s not someone else, that would make me incredibly jealous of my love. To be thinking of someone who is not me is one thing but to be dreaming just some innocent sweet dreams of them *\*chuckles\** no, no. We can’t have that now. *\*footsteps\** Hmm, let’s see. *\*jiggles on some doors and they are locked*\* Not this one, nor this one. Ah, *\*door opens*\* this is the door.  Now let me see what you were dreaming about.

Hmm. Okay, so you are in math class. Are you nervous about your upcoming exam? It’s really cute if you are, dear. You shouldn’t be, you are really good in math, you know that, so there is no need to worry about your grade. I know your teacher can be a jerk at times, but I can fix that for you. You just have to say the word and \*snaps fingers\* poof, he can be erased. *\*sighs\** Although, no matter, I’ll just change a couple of things around seeing how I’m already here. Like you forgetting your pencil and having to borrow one from a classmate. Oh, why hello there beautiful. A pencil? Of course I have an extra one, here you go, and I touch your hand for a beat, that’s it, *\*giggles\** I just love when your cheeks turn that slight shade of pink every time. And of course, I’ll just ask you to help me with question number 3 to explain it to me….ah yes. See you are so smart my love. Haha. \**seat moves and there is a bell*\* Hmm? The dream is not over? Where else are you going? This is not how it ends, no. \**footsteps as speaker follows\**

Well, well, this is new for a change, you usually don’t have two places you dream about at the same time. I wonder if my abilities are not working as well on you as I thought. No no no, that must not be the case, for they have to work. I’m a being that can control dreams and your dream will be wanting to be with me. That’s the whole point. Where are you going my love? To your car? Why are you going to your car? I can’t follow you that easily if you get in, *\*stops listener before they open the door\**

Oh hmm, hello there. \**laughs\** Hmm so, we are in the same math class and I was wondering if you would help me study? Thanks again for your help with question number 3 earlier by the way again. I’m just really worried that I’m going to fail this upcoming final you know? You will help me? Great. Say, hmm, do you want to get lunch or maybe just a coffee? Oh you are meeting someone and are late. \**door open*\* Oh well you can-- *\*car turns on\** Oh wait you have a flat! \* *there is a popping sound and listener gets out of car and looks and see that they do\** Oh my, that is not good. Oh you can take a taxi instead, but hmm. \*listener walks away *and eerie sounds again*\*

Ah, \**heavy breathing from the speaker*\* my love? You are not seeing anyone else are you? You-you wouldn’t do that behind my back now would you? You couldn’t, wouldn’t do that. Not after everything that I’ve done for you. I’ve kept you safe and made you feel loved.  I’ve even helped you with all your goals in school, I’ve built up your confidence and made sure you had extra time to study in your dreams so that you’re at the top of your classes now. So, why would you do this to me? Why are your dreams getting more advanced and why are you able to get away from me in them? Are my powers not working on you? I-I don’t want to use force on you, love, so please just tell me that it was a mistake that you didn’t subconsciously think about getting away from me. For, For I would just I don’t know what I would do if I didn’t have you. Is that why you didn’t want to spend the whole day with me today? You had other plans with someone else? No no no, calm down now \**slaps self\**

They wouldn’t do that to you. No. There is a logical reason for them getting into that car, and then walking away from you, and then for them only spending half of the day with you. They just wanted to surprise you. Yeah that’s it they wanted to surprise you. \**starts to laugh manically\** As well, they are afraid of failing so they needed time to study. Yes, that’s what really happened, right, my dear?  I know you love me, even within your dreams. That’s where you love me the best right darling? I mean, I could just make it so that you would never ever have to wake up from any dream if you really wanted to, and we could always be together forever that way as well. You wouldn’t have to worry about your math finals or work, or anything at all really. All you have to do is just say the word and I’ll take care of everything for you. *\*caress the listener’s hair again\** Just whisper a simple yes my love, and I will create the perfect world for us.

Ah, don’t fear, this will only hurt for a moment, but just because I love you, okay my dear? **(distorted tone)** It will all be worth it in the end.

A 20F intern (different department) and I had some light but consistent interactions over ~1.5 months: glances, smiles, waves, hallway chats, a longer conversation during a lunch break, mutual interest in each other’s plans, etc. Nothing flirty, but I’d say we’ve established an interest baseline. She definitely knows I’m interested in her, as I show no attention to other girls at work, let alone her fellow interns.

Before the holidays, I approached her during lunch. We talked about our upcoming plans, and I asked for her Instagram in person. She gave it to me and accepted the same day. I intentionally didn’t text during the holidays.

She told me her last week was likely going to be this one (with her final day being Jan 9th) and that she’d take my last week off (final day being Jan 16th) to study.

Now holidays are over and work has resumed, but there’s uncertainty around her remaining days. She didn’t show up yesterday, which means her internship could end either this Friday or the following one, and my own last day is also approaching. Because of work context (she comes only 2 days per week for ~5 hours, we work in separate areas, heavy workload, etc.), asking her out in person isn’t ideal.

My plan is to ask her out for a casual coffee over DM, or just text her, chat for a bit and then ask her out.

My dilemma is timing:

Do I DM her soon (original plan was this Friday after work) to avoid losing momentum?

Or wait until next week (Jan 16th, my last day at work) in case she shows up and we can build a bit more rapport, or in case a rejection over text would make things awkward at work?

Keep in mind I’m moving abroad at the end of February, which is why I’m stressed about timing.

*The quality:*

Almaas calls it ‘boundless love’, to distinguish it from the ‘merging’ love he associates with 2 – that one is a specific love between specific people, it matters who the people are, hence why a fixation on it manifests in the heart center – it’s the special, particular love you’d have for your romantic partner, your best friend or your child. It’s central to the affair that particular people are single out: Someone being your child or your girlfriend implies that some other woman is *not* your girlfriend, & some other random kid is *not* your child, you’re special to each other & there can be some entanglement of your self-concepts.

Meanwhile this other type of love – or you could call it compassion, goodwill or kindness, is what would make you care about the well-being of *any* generic hypothetical child, even if they’re a stranger from a totally different culture or ethnicity. It’s not grounded in who you are or who they are (in that sense it can be called ‘self-less’) but is rather grounded in a recognition of what’s good & worth appreciating in the other. In the case of a random orphan, they are innocent, they have feelings and can suffer, they could grow up & become so many things etc.

Maybe they remind you of when you were a child or of your own younger family members, so there can be an an experience of relating or connectedness involved. But it’s not conditioned on pre-existing similarity, rather, it can involve a sense of how all things are intrinsically connected, so that you can have benevolent feelings even towards very different creatures – even animals and plants.

It’s the benevolence given to other parts of creation simply because they exist & because you recognize loveable, worthwhile and/or sympathetic qualities in them, so, this experience is not just about a feeling of love, but about that which makes love possible & the act of recognizing good or at least sympathetic qualities in another – or even just appreciating the world, like the ‘love’ you’d have to your favorite objects & places.

Altruistic selfless benevolence has been called ‘agape’ by the Greeks, is likely how your average christian pictures the love of Jesus, & is likely also reflected in the buddhist concept of metta or ‘lovingkindness’ as a positive quality of compassion that is desirable to cultivate.

But even if they don’t subscribe to any religions, many 9s will outright tell you that they value, idealize or admire kindness or the importance of being kind. (At the same time, anyone with some degree of worldly experience will have come across situations where such idealized kindness had been confused with distinctly *other* things like simply being superficially agreeable, a pushover, an enabler or toxic positivity)

Even so, one should not underestimate the value or transformative power of actual bona fide kindness.

The experience of it is like being held in a warm, loving environment. It is also often likened to light in terms of metaphor, particularly daylight, or a sense of being bathed in soft, suffusing light (Almaas’s gives his sysnesthesia description of it being yellowish-white, delicate and sweet but not intensely so, mostly a soft, gentle sort of thing) – if you feel held & loved in this way, it becomes easy to relax, trust, let go, surrender & trust the process, as if you were being held by a soothing, benevolent presence – you might associate it with Jesus, Kwan-Yin or Mother Earth, or simply the experience of a small child being held by their parent, but either way there is a settling of mind & body that is conducive to becoming happy, relaxed and at ease.

There’s a grounding, regulating effect, and once you are in this state (like a child who feels loved by their parent), you are ready to face whatever comes with a loving, positive attitude, to let action arise without stress or insecurity, and to bring out the best in the situation so that things happen smooth, effortless & harmonic fashion, like they’re supposed to.

Obviously a positive attitude doesn’t stop others from being assholes, but in most cases, if you’re nice to people, there is a higher chance that they’ll be nice to you, & sometimes you can even deescalate someone by showing kindness. Showing and expressing goodwill can serve as a lubricant for social situations.

Heck, even if things go south, the inner grounding & ease of this state lets you face life unperturbed. Since you are internally at peace, it’s harder to knock you off balance – indeed, the opposite might happen, that you become a grounding influence to others. Picture the kind of calm that a wise old sage would have, like Uncle Iroh from Avatar, or the Emperor from Mulan – or, for the 9w8s, in india a wise guru is sometimes also imagined as someone who can use a bit of provocation or trolling to point out absurdity or teach lessons – but coming from a position of being unperturbed themselves.

This state of being internally settled & low on anxiety is also conducive to letting the soul open to its own inner capabilities. In that sense it’s no coincidence that in stories, the wise teacher is often giving you an attitude adjustment to unlock your inner hidden powers, but he helps you do so by loving & supporting you & patiently being there, so you can get that inner grounding too. The student can become more confident & grounded because he’s loved, but at the same time it’s the teacher’s love for the student that allows him to be generous & patient in the first place even when the kid is being frustrating. The wise teacher knows exactly what they can do, so they don’t need to be scared of challenges they can surmount, nor do they have anything to prove. They lack arrogance or self-absorption, but they are free of insecurity.

Hence, being in contact with this quality is exactly that you need when you are experiencing moments of change, big losses, fragmentation, grief or difficult transitions.

It’s not about erasing or ignoring suffering or resisting inevitable change, but simply being there & meeting it with sympathy & compassion. It can’t make difficulty go away, but it helps you like a good friend listening to you helps. This is why getting in touch with this quality helps in the process of letting the others qualities arise as needed & getting in touch with them, the ‘compassion’ in having some self-compassion with you while you’re grappling with the sense of deficiency & the trust & goodwill needed to believe that something positive can be waiting for you at the other end, that the quality *can* arise rather than needing to be frantically compensated for cause else you’re toast forever.

It’s not a naive belief that things will always work out but being open to the possibility that they *can* work out, that at the end of the effort there can be a good thing & therefore the effort is worth it. No one loves effort for the sake of effort or pain for the sake of pain; To make the effort you must have some goodwill that something good can come from it. For me personally, this is something I often struggle with (maybe from the lack of any positive types in my trifix?) even if I rationally understand the task will help me. It’s feels a pointless insurmountable wall of humiliation, no sense of a reward at the other end. So I prolly need to work on this some, & the result of some non-9 overcompensations to protect myself by cynism.

Though considering this also explains how some High Vibrational/ Enlightened 9s can be these hardcore do-gooder idealists, but the more fixated 9s can either have zero motivation for anything or inertly follow the status quo, depending on how much they’re actually in touch with the ‘real thing’ in terms of this quality.

As such, it can be seen as being related to basic trust (types with a line to 9 / repression of 9-like qualities are precisely 6 and 3, the most vigilant types that expect a low degree of goodwill from others – 6 expects villains & deception everywhere & 3 expects no one to care unless they have impressive achievements to point to.) It’s different from the confidence that things *will* work out (that falls more under ‘will’) but rather that the possibility of things working out for good exists and the related feelings of trust, ease & comfort.

It’s not *how* you bring peace, love & comfort (the means is by the more ‘actionistic’ qualities like will, power, competence etc.), you can’t save the world with good intentions alone, but it’s what lets you feel like it’s *possible* to bring peace, love & harmony. If you think no one cares & everyone is just assholes, the whole endeavor is for the birds. (which is why you’ll see some 8,6s, 1s or 3s with very developed powers of action, but they don’t trust in goodwill so they use their action powers for not so altruistic reasons.)

Conversely you can see a 9 as someone who always wants there to be peace love & comfort & to believe that it’s possible… but sometimes they don’t, really, & don’t actually feel this faith internally, so they accept at sucky situation as ‘good nuff’ & convince themselves it’s love & peace, because they don’t actually think they can get the real thing, but accepting that they can’t would be too painful. (Unlike a type that can ‘accept’ that everyone is assholes & they won’t get nothing good, & may act outwardly unkind or apathetic about it.)

Another feature of being in this state of appreciation is that there’s no need to look for distractions, since your appreciation is coming from noticing the goodness in what you’re seeing at present. It makes no sense to distract yourself from something you are currently appreciating, instead you feel inclined to be patient and generous.

Finally when we move from the ‘everyday’ experience of the quality to the Big Spiritual Experience variant of it, it can be experienced as a sense of love that is boundless & all-pervading, like the world itself is made out of love or compassion. What spiritual types may call ‘nonduality’ or the resolution of differences & unity of all things.

After Almaas spent the previous chapters not all spiritual experience is necessarily the “love and oneness” kind, we’ve gotten to the chapter that IS, in fact, about that classic “peace love & unity” experience, which has of course come to be found very profound & numinous by many, that’s why there’s so much talk about it.

It’s a sense of being one with the universe & experiencing pure, generous, selfless, giving altruistic love. The universe itself feels good & loving, & a heavenly blissfulness is experienced, which may be connected to a deity or some kind of pantheistic oneness of all things.

In any case that sense of oneness & love connects you to everything & pervades everything, so you can’t be separate or excluded in any way, and you intensely experience the beauty & goodness in all things… and in yourself as well since you are a seamless part of the whole.

There are no boundaries, everything is one, & everything is filled with love, but also presence, awareness, consciousness, “emptiness” in the buddhist kinda sense where that denotes a receptive unbiased state.

You can look at everything from the buddhist compassion perspective where everyone has suffered & everyone just wants to live & even a villain can deserve compassion and sympathy.

None of this changes that the real world still follows the laws of physics & contains sme fucked up evil shit, so Almaas would disagree with some streams of buddhist thought that the physical world with suffering is not merely an illusion. The all-encompassing compassion perspective is just one perspective, not the only one – and that’s crucial, actually, because ‘the real thing’ in terms of kindness/love is not supposed to ignore suffering or pretend it doesn’t exist, but rather stay with it & feel for it.

It’s the furthest thing from numbing, sleeping or ignoring, a dimming or narrowing of consciousness, but rather an expanding & sharpening of it, to universal/cosmic consciousness, being aware of everything, all the small bits, the strange, strange creatures. Including the spirt realm if you believe in that sorta thing (or otherwise, simply the whole psyche, without rejecting or excluding any part.)

Furthermore, this experience is experiential or intuitive, not conceptual (it’s a gut-center thing – but doesn’t exclude the others, as said above. )

So, when you think about this, you can see much of this ideal reflected in the demeanor of 9s, especially more realized ones: They appreciate the little things, they’re good listeners, they tend to be caring & helpful, they often idealize kindness, selflessness or encompassing love & the idea that nobody should be excluded, they try to see the good in everything & to eliminate discomfort for others, while taking care to avoid impinging on them.

They also want their own lives to be relaxed, comfortable & to have a harmonic flow. (like someone who feels ‘held’ & at ease.)

Furthermore, they can act as mediators, peacemakers or grounding influences (ppl who will at least TRY a peaceful solition rather than jumping straight to attack), or as unifiers of ideas, like Einstein’s realitivity (how spacetime can be seen as one thing) or Jung’s concept of Archetypes. (what all stories may have in common)

Storytellers like Tolkien or Michael Ende have at times depicted the world as being made of a great, harmonic music where everyone has their part.

If one were to assign a bit of ""Free Wisdom"" of 9, as I've done with the other types, it's probably the relative ease of this assumption that hey, maybe different point of views or needs or ideas etc. *can* be reconciled, compared to how some other types are maybe quicker to assume that others are their enemies or that there's a hard dichotomy here. You can't always make peace but you probably make peace a lot more often if you try. Treating people nice and/or projecting calm does demontrably result more often in nice or calm responses, so this can definitely be a strength that shouldn't be dismissed or undersold. There's a natural appreciation for how all parts of the whole, even the smallest ones, can have their merit & value as parts of the ""great music"".

*The overcompensation:*

In the opinion of Almaas, most 9s are not very far from embodying the quality, but often with twist that alienates them from inwardly experiencing it. Unlike with, say, 3, 9s can have more difficulty feeling it themselves than with embodying it (although this doesn’t preclude the existence of some dysfunctional assholish 9s)

One way that trying to force peace, love & unity to happen when it just isn’t there can look like charlie brown & the football, where someone repeatedly acts nice towards someone who doesn’t care & gets the floor wiped with them. At first this would seem to make them the victim, but depending on who else is in that situation it can hurt others, like if a parent enables abuse or if someone acts like a fair-weather friend.

This is why you get those stories where the hero convinces all the bad guys to see the errors of their ways & everyone hugs it out & forgives each other – someone who’s more, like, a 6, might hate such a story because their main concern is having their view of reality validated because of their own tendency to doubt it, so to them the idea of being “made to” forgive against their will is scary, manipulations that look to extort forgiveness while erase their suffering. (the error is also a bit on their part: a story can’t *make* you do anything. Your will is yours.) For them wish fulfillment is to see their perception validated: They were right, the baddy was wrong, & maybe the baddy either admits they were bad or gets punished.

But probably the writer was a 9 & doesn’t care so much about who’s right, as they want peace & love to happen somehow. They don’t have to be “made” to forgive, they bitterly **want to** & wish it was “safe” & that’s the fantasy of the story – although there are also cases of Toxic positivity where folks project this on others telling them they need to forgive to have peace of mind. For me, a lack of forgiveness doesn’t bother my peace of mind much. Peace for me would just be to forget or be indifferent about the person. I’m all for stopping to have a counterproductive reaction to them, but it doesn’t require forgiveness.

Another form of over-compensation is that while a person may outwardly mimic this ‘universal compassion’, they leave themselves out of it, because they don’t *really* feel loved or connected deep down, or like they don’t even have loveable qualities – hence why 9s can struggle with inferiority complexes or feeling they lack special qualities.

This ends up looking that the stereotypical “fake happy depressed person” who tries to put up a happy face to not bother their friends & do nice things for them, but they think it’s worthless if anything were done for themselves & reflect & reject any attention, affection or love coming their way.

If you inwardly believed you didn’t have any goodness or weren’t worth loving, you’d stay out of people’s way. You wouldn’t talk about yourself because you don’t think you have this ‘loveability’ that could cause others to appreciate or be interested in you. You’d think they wouldn’t care or would just realize how boring you are if they haven’t already.

If it’s not possible for others to appreciate you, then they could get tired of you at any moment & reject you into orbit, so you won’t assert yourself, point out your boundaries and certainly not show anger. Anger involves believing that your rights were violated. What rights can you have if you’re worthless? If you rock the boat a little bit you might be out.

Or, in more moderate cases, maybe you won’t be full on worthless but you’re still doing something illegitimate. This is a way how parents can fuck up their children by transmitting to them that it’s never ok to be angry or complain, or that comfort of other people must always come first. It makes the kids feel like they’re worthless, too.

Often what differentiates the overcompensation from genuine kindness or humility is this self-deprecating cadence to it. “I will let you talk first because Im interested in you & want to give you space” is actual kindness; “I will shut up because I’m boring & I don’t matter anyway” is the voice of satan.

Another difference between real humility & overcompensation-borne self-neglect is that it actually makes others *un*comfortable and may *create* conflict, which actual kindness & humility would not. If you never complain, assert yourself or say “stop” when you need stop, it means that others feel like they need to keep track of your boundaries *for* you or else they’ll be made the bad guy. If ppl ask you for information they need to feature your needs into their decisions and you get evasive, you’re frustrating them & making them feel punished for caring. If others make an effort to give you nice things & you refuse them due to not ‘deserving’ it or feeling it’s not worth it, you’re hard to find gifts for or be nice to… even when people want to. You’re just denying them the joy & satisfaction of being nice to you. (this is not about having to accept what is, in fact, unwanted help)

Plus, seeing a loved one neglect themselves stresses people out!

A good example of this came up recently during the holidays, when my brother (who happens to be a 9 core) received several cans of kimchi and a giant box of dried mushrooms from our sister who is also his roommate. You’d think that’s a bit of a trivial gift – just some groceries? Then I learned the story behind it: Apparently he often sighs/laments that whatever he’s cooking would be even better if he added those ingredients, but dismissed it, thinking it’s not worth the money. He is kinda reluctant about spending money on himself (despite having a fine sense of taste that can distinguish different soda brands for example). Our sister was so tired of watching him denying himself the simple, mundane happiness of the occasional non-cheap ingredient that she just up & bought him some, cause it’s the only way he’ll have kimchi or mushrooms in his soup. Making yourself a little bit happy is not a waste or an indulgence, guys!

Being generous with your stuff is different from letting yourself be exploited, it’s precisel your self-worth & your inclusion of yourself in what’s worth caring about that makes you draw up the boundary as needed.

Finally, we can see how comfort-seeking behavior is trying to artificially/forcedly produce a state of restful ease. It’s meant to deny and avoid confronting any experience of difficulty, so it keeps you from confronting the problem. (might be lowkey grounded in a belief that you’re not worth having your problem solved or that no one will care either way, or that nothing good or rewarding will follow) – so it results in distraction or busiwork that doesn’t remove the source of the negative feeling & thus produces no real ease.

Instead of being open to the arising of your inner qualities, you basically believe you don’t have any, so, you just end up numbing yourself to your feelings & biding your time with trivial, superficial stuff. That’s all you *can* do, if you think on some level you don’t have inner qualities or resources. The suck is forever, so only distraction & anesthesia makes it bearable.

That, however, leads you far away from conscious appreciation of goodness, rather a gulf grows between you & reality which just enhances you sense of separateness. If you’re zones out you can also let your problems pile on & your relationships deteriorate since you’re not paying attention. (so one thing that harshly contrasts the 9 high on copium with one that’s in touch with the actual quality from the external perspective is that the copium-huffer will make you feel ignored, like they don’t care about anything or like they’re not quite there with you. Whereas the most ‘high vibrational’ states of the 9 spectrum will be experienced as someone who’s extremly attentive, open & cares a bunch about *everything* down to the tiny flowers in the pavement cracks.)

The overcompensating person will also feel a need to think of themselves as comfortable and calm at all times… especially when they are not. Which actually *cuts them off* from receiving care & loving holding. If you put up a happy face no one knows you’re sad, & this can then reinforce your feeling that no one cares & you don’t matter, because you experience your true inner state combined with a lack of outer response.

*The absence:*

Often what’s happening when someone’s highkey in counterproductive type patterns is that the facsimile of kindness & consideration guards against complete & utter apathy, and the pointless distractions & busywork guard against all-consuming inertia.

If nothing matters & nobody cares & nothing’s good about the world… then why?

Why do… anything at all?

The Swamp in the Neverending Story is probably one of the more striking depictions of the 9 deficiency state.

It’s rly that emotion/state that makes ppl just wanna bedrot indefinitely.

Sometimes when someone hits bottom due to challenges in life they might do just that, but there’s a less accute version where you’re going through the motions of life & doing everything you’re supposed to do but also feeling utterly alienated & disconnected from all of it because what does it matter?

As such, it’s a rather scary feeling to confront, because what if it just doesn’t stop?

What if you come to find that even your overcompensation activities are just pointless & not worth bothering & that you can’t arse yourself to do anything at all anymore?

It’s aching, scary, emotionally messy & quite existential, because the opposite of feeling love, benevolence & connection with the whole world is like… *not* feeling that. At all.

Being totally disconnected. Utterly unloveable. That you don’t matter at all & there’s no reason to love or care about anything, totally void & empty inside where others would have a soul.

Or maybe the whole world is a shapeless soulless nothing because nothing matters.

If you’re personally not in touch with the deficiency state, it might be easiest to ‘find’ it by pausing to stop & look at your fear of conflict & confrontation (The designated Avoidance of 9) & seeing how this might be grounded in an exaggerated lack of trust, or an inner sense of lacking goodness & worthwhile qualities.

Notice the anxiety about how others’ anger, rejection, displeasure or abandonment without immediately trying to find comfort or peace.

Let yourself notice the ways in which you actually feel *dis*connected, like if you don’t feel you could tell your loved ones your real preferences. Why don’t you? What would happen if you did? How are your doubts about whether you can reasonably expect and demand better treatment related to some assumed inner sense of deficiency?

In doing this you might have to confront memories of situations in your past where you painfully experienced a lack of loving holding. Maybe you lost a parent at a young age, or there was a messy divorce, or you grew up in a hostile abusive household where you were, in fact, yelled at and threatened with a complete withdrawal of love & connection if you strained you caused your caregivers the slightest inconvenience. Or maybe you were bullied and mocked by your peers during childhood & puberty, & made to feel worthless in that way, especially if parents or teachers failed to care or do anything to fix the problem.

You might have to confront & work through the secondary negative feelings you might have about that pain, but which you disowned because they didn’t fit with your idea of what a kind, loving person should be like, particularly anger and resentment, and most of all anger at people you’d much rather forgive & play pattycakes with and don’t *want* to be angry at.

Anger at your parents, at your spouse, at “god” or the universe, hatred, cynism, resignation, apathy, gloomyness, frustrated ambition… all the stuff that doesn’t fit your ‘ideal’ self & that you would otherwise push aside or distract from for fear that it makes you a bad, unloving person.

Experience it, but don’t forget to try to switch on Self.Compassion exe, its only human to be angry sometimes, & there’s no such thing as thought-crime. Becoming conscious of darker thoughts can in fact help you to be more directed with your actions, eg, allowing yourself to think “I am angry at my wife” & finding a constructive way to get it out of your system might keep you from making it worse by having it come out in an uncontrolled way like being passive-agressive or snapping.

The anger, resentment, discomfort and dissatisfaction can also be where you can find your vitality & drive again, especially if you bring attention & consciousness to it Anger & discomfort are emotions that want you to move, do stuff, fix things. Maybe don’t solve the issue with the wife by going “Fuck you bitch I hate you” but maybe you could voice your complaint in a constructive, civilized way (“can you please not do x anymore? I know you didn’t mean anything by it, but really bothers me”) – this opens you up to experiencing that ppl can, in fact, be interested in caring about you & supporting you, and that self-assertion & drive are not nuclear threats to your relationship.

Although, if the wife is continuously treating you like crap & responds to a small request by exploding at you, maybe you *should* divorce her. As mentioned above, anger activates when we feel we were treated unfairly, so your anger can help you find the part of you that *does* think you deserve good things.

On the individual rather than interpersonal level, he same goes for persistent discomfort or things about your life that bum you tf out, perhaps you can let the negative feeling motivate you towards taking concrete steps to fix it.

Revulsion towards injustice or unfair treatment of others, resentment over frustrated ambition or sadness of unrealized dreams meanwhile is often where you can find purpose, direction or idealistic motivation, for a more “big picture” orientation.

It might help to see the negative feeling as just something temporary, that merely gives you information, not a defining indictment of who you are or something you have to wholly “believe” as true. Besides, numbing your feelings to blot out the negative ones often takes out the positive ones as well, so once you’ve got the anger out of your system & it’s all aired out, there’ll be room for the clean, spacious, receptive state when you can notice stuff that moves you towards caring & appreciating again – the genuine article, not a pretend facsimile. You’ll notice the trees & flowers & all that jazz again.

*The transformation: Intertia → Attention*

What is tricky about unknotting the type 9 knot in particular is its tendency to react to adversity with demotivation.

At first glance, the usual trick of bringing consciousness to the ‘energy’ of the unhelpful impulse doesn’t seem to work because… there does not seem to be an impulse. How would you transform ‘sloth’ into ‘right action’ or somehow recognize the seed of the latter in the former?? Inertia is not acting.

The problem is precisely the inertia, the lack of impulse. How do you trick yourself out of a non-behavior?

Trying to push yourself into action doesn’t work. Just as an external person (eg. Susan Piver trying to gently nudge her friend to just make that car purchase she’s been putting off) would have a hard time getting a 9 to budge with charts, diagrams or nagging (& probably just provoke more stubbornness, passive-aggression or self-deprecation), the 9 themself would have the same problem trying to motivate themself.

The very act of trying to make oneself confront the problem (whether it’s an internal state or an avoided action) triggers the usual overcompensation/copes/escape behaviors of non-doing, zoning out & pretending it’s not there.

Note #1 (not just for 9s, but everyone) is that shame is a *de*motivator. Shame can work excellently to *inhibit* behaviors (“I would not do this shitty thing because I would be ashamed”), but you can’t shame anyone into action… including yourself. Beating up on yourself in not helping. Sometimes it just happens (can’t shame yourself out of shame, either), but *not* dutifully feeling bad about yourself doesn’t make you more lazy or indulgent or brazen or anything.

You know ppl are ashamed of masturbating often just end up masturbating again to make themselves feel better about the shame? Don’t let that happen to you if you catch yourself doing a distraction/busiwork/zoning out behavior.

At the same time, do take notice if you catch yourself doing it, because according to Piver attention/consciousness is *still* the solution, but for the problem of Transforming Sloth(TM) it’s especially important that it be *agenda-free* attention.

If you try to push yourself you’ll summon resistance just as when someone else tries to push you. (Experientially, feeling pushed is quite different from feeling held or compassionately soothed, right? You feel the most soothed when you *expected* to be pushed & instead the other person is just… there & feels for you. )

Judgement free attention itself is in some ways already pretty close to compassion or appreciation. (Which is maybe a lightbulb moment for everyone else trying to bridge that ‘emergence gap’ with regards to their own type’s quality, not just 9s. That gap-bridging requires some cultivation of Compassion for everyone.)

Piver cites some famous Zen Priest who was once quoted saying that “Attention is the most basic form of love”, but I’d actually once come up with a similar idea while writing a story.

When someone is famous or accomplished, people want to know everthing about them, right? Even their diaries become historical documents. On a small scale, most of us have an interest in people we love. When you love someone (or something, like a topic or type of animal), everything about them becomes interesting & relevant to you. You show that you care by having an interest in others’ lives.

This is even used as a shorthand in storytelling: A father doesn’t know his daughter’s hobby, that is telling us he’s a bad father. If someone remembers how his best friend takes her coffee after many years apart, it shows us he bitterly missed the friend.

So if you can’t get from zero to self-love, step 1 can be to try making an effort to give more attention to yourself & to your life. Caring (and therefore motivation) may spring naturally from what you learn if you pay attention. Even if it’s hard to overcome a habit of zoning out, the attempt/thought counts.

On a more practical level, here’s some more concrete tips from Miss Piver:

*Priority Sorting*

This applies especially if you never get around to your personal goals because you always get lost in details or end up being super busy with everything else. Have a go at the eisenhower matrix maybe? Or think of a small steps commitment to you goal like writing X words drawing 1 drawing, go sign up for that course, making this & that phonecall etc. so your big goals don’t stay on the backburner indefinitely.

*Attitude towards discouragement*

Try to see discouragement not at a sign that there’s something wrong with you, but as a temporary forgetting that you do, in fact, believe in yourself & your path. If you’re interested in finding yourself & figuring out your life (which you probably are if you’re on a self-help subreddit), then on some level you must have already seen some proof of your worthiness & goodness, even if you have maybe taken a wrong turn by temporarily handing the remote to others here & there

*Trust/Experience*

Think of a time you felt good after taking an action. In particular, think of the sensations in your body. Remind yourself that you’re a capable adult & think of times you pulled things off & got positive responses rather than dwelling on what could go wrong.

The more you do this, the more experiences you’ll have to refer back to.

*Aspiration*

Remember **why** youre doing it, don’t get stuck in self-judgement. Remember: Positive reinforcement, not shame. You want a clean house. You want to show people you care. You really want to do this project.

(if you can’t think of any why, consider not doing it.)

*Effort*

Sometimes you might have to squeeze through a bit of discomfort to get the ball rolling. The words won’t appear on the page till you stard typing im afraid. However the good news is that once you just get started, there’s eventually an inertial ‘tipping point’ where doing the new thing becomes a habit & then the intertial force will work against stopping it.

*Continuity*

To reach that tipping point it’s helpful to do things regularly, a little bit every day. It’s better to start a 10 min walking habit that you’ll actually stick with than a 1 hour jogging one that you’ll get fed up with within days.

“*yorkshire tea & fuck it”*

This one is not from Susan Piver, but from my brother. He used to have problems with handing in essays on time because he couldn’t pick or commit to a topic & then he wouldn’t have decided on anything until shortly before the thing was due. One day he made the conscious decision to just pick a topic & stick with it (eg. ‘the history of yorkshire tea’), & just make the best of that one topic. If you can see the value/interestingness in multiple options (or at least don’t have strong aversions to them) then chances are you can do ok with whatever option you pick. (unless you learn that you do in fact hate it – in that case that’s new info, too.)

This applies not just to essay topics but many other indecisiveness-related problems that benefit from picking something you don’t hate & then just making a committed effort at it.

He went from barely scraping by half the time to getting praised. (also while he initially wasn’t super interested in yorkshire tea, he came to learn what’s interesting about it while researching it.)

I am 30. Idk why but it felt important to say that 😆

It started with meeting L. And I do really like meeting L. She’s so sweet and consistent with how she is. We always do these cute things, artsy stuff, or go out on little coffee hangouts. She doesn’t really drink or smoke or anything, so very unlike me, but I kind of like that. Today we went for a coffee, she had a meal, I just had coffee, and then we wandered around, looked through shops. And she helped me find a winter jacket. I finally have one now. It’s so warm and nice and she helped me choose it, which was so sweet- said I looked ‘soo good’ in it wink wink.

The highlight though? I read her my poems. And she melted. She kept saying how much she loves how creative I am, all the things I do — the writing, the guitar, the art of it all. And when I read, she looked at me like magic. Not necessarily romantic, but it felt like love, or something that has the shape of love in it. She looked into my eyes like she could see me. You know? 

Honestly, that moment reminded me that I’ve spent so long performing for love. Chasing it. Twisting myself to earn it. I think I forgot what it feels like to be accepted just as I am. Just me, sitting across the table, poems in hand, nothing to prove and someone looking at me like that.

After that, P and J called. They asked if I wanted to go bouldering. And I almost said no. Me bouldering!? Trust me it would be a strange image if you knew me.  Also a bit skinned this month. Even then I was like, fuck, I don’t know if I can do this. It’s the same place C(ex wife) used to go. The memory was heavy. But I said fuck it and went.

At first it looked intimidating - I didn’t think I could climb anything. But P and J were so encouraging. So I started with the easier ones. And then, I actually climbed one all the way to the top. It felt incredible. Like I did it. My body did it. And I felt strong.

Afterwards, we grabbed chai lattes and went to a park. It was cold, so cold, but I had my new jacket on and oh my god it was the first time all winter that I felt properly warm and fashionable at the same time(Fashion>Freezing bones right? ). We lit a joint, had these deep chats, took pictures. Then we parted ways.

And here’s where the best part starts.

I had two options: a 45-minute journey with train and bus, or a one-hour walk. I looked at the route. It was cold. It was night. The streets were empty. But something inside me said walk. So I did.

I was in Mile End, and I walked all the way through Hackney, then Hoxton. And the moment I started, I put on my playlist and put my hood up. I thought - I don’t need to fear the danger. Tonight, I am the danger! So I started walking all gangster( not my usual walk haha). Had my hoodie up, my trainers on. Then after a while, I put the hood down - I wanted to feel it. The cold on my face. The air on my skin.

I can’t explain what happened then. I just felt free. Like actually, truly free. No fear, no heartbreak, no sadness, no guilt. I wasn’t thinking about C, or missing her or wondering what could I have done to save our relationship. Not even when I passed Mama Shelter, this bar she and I once went to, when things were good. At first I tried to look away. But then I thought — no. That was a beautiful memory. I don’t need to erase it to move forward, I don’t need to demonise the good times. I realised I can carry her gently in my memories and still let her go. And in that moment, I let it be beautiful. Just that. No more, no less. 

The walk felt like a movie. Like London had opened herself to me. Streets were empty, not a single soul, and yet they felt alive. Heaving with stories. How can something be so empty and still feel so alive?

I felt like I wasn’t walking through a city, but through a soul. Like London had carried every broken poet, every punk rocker, every king, every dreamer. And tonight, she carried me. It was like I could feel the weight of history in every corner. And I swear, I saw it. I saw the stories. And I took photos. Every two minutes, I was stopping to capture something. A streetlight. A shadow. A Christmas tree someone had dumped outside. The kind of beauty that most people miss, but I could see it tonight. Like I used to. Back when I was a teen with a camera.

And I thought of that night on London Bridge. Around New Years. When I made that quiet prayer to the city, asking it to hold me, to make space for me. I stood there, looking at Tower of London and whispered a kind of wish. And tonight, it felt like London whispered back: Here. You asked. So take it. And I did.

Somewhere along the way, I saw a girl - oval face, mascara trailing past her temple. She looked at me. I looked at her. We felt it. We didn’t say anything. Just kept walking. I turned around three times to see if she looked back. She didn’t. But I imagined that maybe she is turning exactly as I turn back, in a perfectly imperfect workings of life. I thought maybe someone from afar seeing us and thinking: “If only they knew.” It made me grin like a fool. I nearly walked into a pole. Barely escaped it. Chuckled to myself.

Got hungry too -stopped at a corner store, bought a protein bar. Felt resourceful. Felt good.

It was the perfect mix. Joy in my heart, mellow high in my body, cold on my face, warmth in my chest, with just a dash of fear. 

The playlist? banger! It was like the Universe had queued it just for me. One after the other, each song matched my steps, my mood, my vibe. I felt like I was in rhythm with something bigger than me.

And I got home. To my warm little flat. And I just sat there- with frozen fingers and a full, full heart. I met someone who saw me. I did something physical. I felt warm. I smoked a joint. I took photographs. I walked through a city that finally felt mine.

This, this is what I’m here for. This is the life I want. This is me.

And the wildest thing? I’m not even fully healed. I still carry pain. But today, I felt like I was living again. And for the first time in a long time, that was enough.

I have one event type (coffee meeting) that happens multiple days a week, and each day or time slot corresponds to a different location (let’s call them Location A, B, C, and D). The issue is that Calendly shows all locations for every time slot, which could be confusing for people. I want them to clearly know which location matches the time they choose without having to create separate links for each location.

Does anyone have tips for making the location clear for each time slot, or best ways to structure the description or confirmation emails?

It’s not that I want to stay here, I just don’t have any friends!! This has been an ongoing issue for a couple years now. I lost a lot of friends during COVID and a bad relationship that isolated me.

Truth is sometimes the people who you’d thought would always be there for you, move on. I’m not on bad terms with anyone.

2025 I said I would try harder than ever to cultivate friendships. I posted more on ig, reacted to stories, wrote people kind messages and asked to get together. Last year, I went to 2 movies, a comedy show and even got invited to a birthday party. I did study groups and a few meetups too.

But sadly, none of those people wanted to see me. I deleted a bunch of text here detailing my attempts to socialize and failures. I realize that they’re friendly but they’re not my friends. I spent this whole break watching peoples stories wondering why they don’t want to invite me.

I write kind notes to them on their birthdays, bought popcorn/coffees for them, and said yes to whatever works for their schedule even if it didn’t work for mine. I know that’s not much but I’m trying….

My birthdays in 2 weeks. I don’t want to spend it alone but I’m too embarrassed to ask them out. I’m worried nobody will come. Last year I invited people to a bar. I had one person I wasn’t even close with agree to come and I ended up asking my mom to join to lessen the blow. 

I’ve told everyone that I’m trying to build friendships. I’ve sadly even admitted to being lonely before.

This breaks my heart. I’ve been crying on my couch commenting on posts for 3 weeks. I only get up to shower.

1q6wdgp,https://youtu.be/eCpEMQSN0UY,B1 English Listening Practice ｜ Slow English Shadowing ｜ Speak English Fluently,"✅ Feel the rhythm of real English and learn natural daily-life phrases.



🎧 B1 Slow English Listening + Shadowing (Daily Routine)



In this episode, you’ll train your listening and speaking at the B1 level with slow, clear English. We go through a full everyday routine—from the morning to bedtime—so you can hear the kind of sentences people actually say and then repeat them until they feel automatic.



📝 Please prepare a notebook or a pen. Write down any new phrases and review them after the episode.



🗣️ How to use this episode (Shadowing Method):

• First play: just listen and catch the rhythm.

• Second play: repeat right after me (same speed, same tone).

• Daily practice: repeat for 7 days to build strong speaking habits.



✅ Key B1 phrases to practice (pause and repeat 2–3 times):

🟠 “I usually take the train.”

🟠 “I need to catch up on some emails.”

🟠 “I head to the kitchen to make coffee.”

🟠 “I have a lot on my plate today.”

🟠 “I usually get home around six o’clock.”

🟠 “I go to sleep around eleven to get enough rest.”



📚 Mini Dictionary (B1)

• Shadowing = repeating what you hear immediately.

• Exhausting = very tiring.

• Heading out = leaving home / going out.

• On my plate = things you must deal with.

• Wind down = relax at the end of the day.



✅ 7-Day Listening Plan

Save this episode and listen once per day for a week. The repetition helps your brain stop translating and start speaking naturally.



💬 Question of the Day: What do you do to relax after a long day?

Hey. There is a lot I could say about myself, but the most important is that I'm well-rounded. I like to build a place of peace and security in my relationships, and also leave enough room for play. I live a quiet life with writing and drawing most days, but recently I've been going on small side quests like to parks and malls.

A relationship with me is an easy one. A bit of flirting, some teasing, challenging each other. A good time to me is a shared book, spending the day at an arcade or café, or just co-oping some game. I know it's good when we can just sit out in nature enjoy each other's presence. I build slow-burn and with intent.

The woman I fall for is passionate, the type who can go on and on about the things she loves. I always find myself falling for the shy and introverted girls with nerdy hobbies and strong values. I'm most drawn to the girl next door type: cute face, slim to athletic build, and a sweet smile with expressive eyes. Not some perfect model, but not just anyone. I fall for someone who is kind to others, is loyal to the ones she loves, and is just as picky as I am on who she lets into her life.

As a side note, Final Fantasy is my favorite series (obviously), and I'm aiming cosplay Cloud in con season.

1q6w7iu,https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1q6w7iu/advice_needed/,Advice needed,"Hello. I am making this post because I truly feel lost and in need of even a friendly chat/advance so any input is valuable for me thank you.

So, I am a 23F, chubby (still am) that grew up in a small city with controlling parents that never got any sort of romantic advances, relationships or anything of that sort. My only focus was studying and even though I had some crushes on some boys, they never lasted more than a week or so because by then I got to talk with them and any sort of attraction I had just went out the window.

I suspected I was also attracted to girls (so bisexual) in 7th grade while playing Mystic Messenger because there is a female love interest. And as any teen with controlling parents but excessive access to the internet I was very active on tumblr and wattpad. So on wattpad I started by reading Harry Styles X FMC (be it celebrity or reader insert, with links to clothes and all that) but I was also a Larry shipper and by the first taste of Larry fanfics I was hooked and started to read only those (they were better written in my opinion but alas this is not the point!). I also discovered manga and read mostly yaoi.



And on tumblr I found something known as Am I a lesbian? Masterdoc and wanted to read it because I was starting to doubt I was 100% straight but by the first lines I started crying so I stopped reading it. I thought to myself that if I read it and actually come to the conclusion I thought about (bisexual) I couldnt just know and do nothing about it. Once I came to that conclusion I knew I would be aware of my attraction to girls and try to look into it in some way and I especially had this scenario in mind: what if I found a girl I like that likes me back but we have to date behind close doors because I knew my parents were homophobic and not to mention small town so really no place to really hide. I didnt want to have this hypothetical girl suffer because of/with me so I decided to ignore my feelings. (I know great news!!) But I didnt make a pact with myself that I would be allowed to read the Masterdoc when I went to university (so in 5 years).

In grade 9-12 nothing interesting really. The only thing worth mentioning was that I tried to also read yuri but it made me cry so I sticked to only reading yaoi.

Now fast forward first year in university I do read the Masterdoc and although a bit old still very insightful and made me realise that, yes I am not straight. 

Worth mentioning that I had major problems with my body, the way I looked and how undesirable I felt because I was fat to even though I did have the freedom to try and pursue love/atraction I did not because I felt way to insecure.

But I did notice a girl in my first year, found her very attractive but never approached.Fast-forward to last year of university and I see this girl again and I notice her jacket that has a lesbian flag pin so I decide (after losing some weight and feet better. not yet good in my body) that I must do something and at least talk to her! And that is what I did. I invited her out for coffee and she accepted. I will admit that maybe I seemed just friendly although I tried to convert something more.

I would like to mention that asking her out came with a lot of internal battle for me because I still do feel worthless and undesirable and have a really bad opinion about myself about self image and how it correlated to being deserving of love.

Comes the day of the date: we talk and she talks about her ex and I ask what is her type and she says someone experienced and fit and not bisexual - because of past experiences - (which I feel is the total opposite of me). I do feel bad and rejected but I do what I set out to do and that is confess my attraction to her. She seemed a bit shocked about my confession thinking this was just a friendly hangout but it was nothing too awkward. We remained on friendly terms.

Now, present day, and I dont know what to do. I still dont feel I have the body I think is required to go dating (please see these as standards I have made for myself that even I struggle with and not that I truly believe there is such a thing), I feel bad because I have no experience with dating and I am still unsure of my sexuality.

I am wondering if I am bisexual or lesbian because the idea of having a man in my house and a relationship to a mean makes me uneasy. And one time I tried to imagine myself giving a blowjob it made me cry.

But I dont feel the same when thinking about life with a woman or sex with a woman. My only worry here is that I am inexperienced and I dont know what Im doing. I feel so unsure about sex that I dont even know how to masturbate and I am a little scared to experiment. I am also scared that maybe I wouldnt like to have sex with women and that somehow makes me uneasy. What if I dont like it, then what?

I also worry because I did have crushes in the past on boys and I wouldnt want to take the term lesbian and then end up with a men. I think this term deserves a little more respect and I would like to use it being 100% sure.

I am so worried about figuring things about because I would like to date woman and I do feel that I would need to be sure in front of them on what ground I am standing to be taken seriously.

Thank you to whoever read this and any word of advice is welcome!!

1q6w2n6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q6w2n6,Bangkok to Hanoi - 3 weeks including trains,"My partner and I rode chunks of just north of Bangkok in Thailand, through Laos, to Dong Hoi, Vietnam. The title indicates Hanoi but we got there by train so can't speak to that section. We had a few weeks to travel starting at the end of September into October, the timing dictated by work not by choice. I would not recommend that timing based on the amount of rain we encountered! Regardless, the trip was incredible (of course) and I bugged people on reddit a lot for info so I figure I'd post here too. My partner had never toured, had barely ridden at all in almost a decade, and was recovering from a knee injury so that dictated distances and she managed to not re-injure herself so that's a big win.

Despite some difficulties described below, this trip was BEAUTIFUL. Just stunning.

**Weather**

It was HOT and HUMID and WET. I was soaked all the time either from rain or sweat. Laos seemed to be in a rain shadow but Thailand had multi hour downpours and Vietnam had a storm that ended up changing our plan. We rode from 6 or 7am to 1 to 3pm or so, depending on the day. Only in Vietnam did we wear our rainjackets though, otherwise it was too warm to need them. We did end up wearing every item we brought, and we packed fairly light so that was a win! (Relatedly, did laundry by hand every night.) We prioritized places with AC every night, which was delightful.

**Accom**

We didn't camp at all. Accom in Thailand was fairly simple, but touring on the shoulder season meant that we were often the only people in the places we stayed in Laos and rural Vietnam. When possible (mostly Thailand and Vietnam) we booked online the day of or the day before but in Laos it mostly involved just showing up. I would be cautious about the HCMR: Vietnam has some strict rules about pre registration when staying overnight close to a border and we ended up in a late night adventure to the border police in Huang Lap. We brought a bug net and would maybe consider bringing a sleeping bag liner for future trips through Laos - sheets were not being cleaned for sure in most of the spots we ended up. Could likely be due to traveling out of peak season.

**Food**

I'm pescetarian so that was a bit of a struggle occasionally. Ended up eating a lot of papaya salad and then rice and eggs. To get protein, I ate a lot of yogurt from 7/11 in Thailand, soy milk boxes in Laos (seemingly everywhere) and then milk boxes in Vietnam (plus tofu started to become more available). There was lots of fruit available and once we hit Laos it was often easy to find good coffee and baked goods. Some of the super rural days in Laos it was hard to find prepared food to buy anywhere but otherwise our biggest struggle in Laos and rural Vietnam seemed to be that we didn't understand what time people were eating/restaurants were open. I didn't bring my stove and I had quite big regrets about that. There was almost always (though sometimes not) vegetables, noodles, and eggs at the least to buy places and I could have had more food security that way.

If you want to eat meat on a stick - you're golden pretty much everywhere and always.

**Route**

Broken down below. Basically we rode a bit in Thailand, took the train east, rode a bit more before crossing into Laos. We rode through quite rural Laos, then crossed to Vietnam with the anticipation of riding a chunk of the Ho Chi Minh Road. We ended up in a multi day lightning storm while riding and decided to bail to the coast and have a week in Hanoi before heading home. Sounds like the storm just got worse after we left so it was the right call!

The roads in Thailand were incredible, small agricultural roads that were paved so well! The main problem in Thailand were the aggressive dogs. Otherwise the riding was fantastic.

In Laos, it was fun not being the slowest vehicle on the road, with old tractors as passenger vehicles and every other sort of vehicle and animal on the roads too. Days 12 and 13 were fairly grueling as the highway ended up becoming broken pavement (worse than gravel and potholes in some places) and every river valley bridge was being rebuilt so we couldn't maintain any speed. It ended up becoming a mud road to the extent that only motorbikes were on it and they were also getting stuck. Half way through Day 13 we were back to mostly functional pavement.

In Vietnam, the roads were good again and riding the HCMR was fun as it was absolutely empty of cars and was concrete slabs. Of course, it could have been empty because of the huge storm!

For navigation, I used OsmAnd and BRouter. I chose bike routes in Thailand but switched to car routes for Laos and most of Vietnam.

They were all exhausted, except for Ethan.

Ethan lay curled on his side, tasting blood and pine needles, every breath a knife between his ribs. The kicks had stopped, but the ringing in his ears hadn’t. Above him, Edward’s boots crunched once, twice, deliberate.

“Enough,” Edward said, gasping for air himself.

The word landed flat, final. Riley stepped back first, breathing hard, hands already in his pockets like he wanted to disappear them. Lewis stayed where he was, arms loose, watching everything with the same bored calculation he used to price a stolen TV. Dylan, soaked and shivering from the lake, wiped water from his face and grinned anyway, teeth bright against the dark.

Edward crouched beside Ethan, not close enough to help him up, just close enough to be seen. His voice dropped into that familiar register calm, reasonable, the one he used when he wanted everyone to remember who was in charge.

“You’re still one of us, Ethan. Always have been. We only stay alive if we stick together. Tow the line. You know that.”

Ethan forced a laugh. It came out wet and ragged. “Your friends,” he rasped, blood bubbling on his lip. “Not your slaves.”

Dylan snorted, loud enough to cut through the cold. “Slaves? Come on, man. You were bait. That’s all you ever were.”

Ethan’s heart seized.

Bait.

Bait?

The word hung in the air, sharp and cold.

“What?” His voice cracked. “Bait for what?”

Dylan’s grin widened, reckless. “For the witch in the house.”

The world tilted. Ethan’s pulse roared in his ears. Witch in the house.

Constance.

Edward’s head snapped toward his brother. “Dylan. Shut your mouth.”

But Dylan was already committed, riding the high of being the one who said it out loud. Invincible, soaked, grinning like he’d won something. “What? It’s true. Dad told us about her years ago. Some woman who lived in that rotting place. Lady was skin and bones and claimed she’d eaten people. Like it was a story. Remember how he’d talk about it? Like it was funny. Said she was beautiful, but wrong. She was never there when he called the cops. Said he kept going back anyway to try to get her help. Kept going back until one day he didn’t come home.”

He spat lake water onto the snow. “The dare wasn’t a dare, Ethan. It was a test. We wanted to know if the story was real. If she’d eat someone. And you walked right in.”

Silence crashed down, heavier than the cold.

Ethan’s mind fractured. He saw Tyler McCormick not the deadbeat dad who’d vanished without a trace, no credit card swipes, no cash withdrawals, nothing for the cops to follow. Just gone.

Constance had taken him. Eaten him. Left two boys and a wife to grow up hating a ghost who never existed.

All those years of rage, of poverty, of Edward’s quiet control and Dylan’s vicious edge they’d been aimed at a man who’d never abandoned them. A man who’d walked into the same clearing Ethan had, seen the same woman curled in the ferns, and never walked out.

Ethan’s stomach lurched. He tasted bile at the back of his throat.

He saw Constance’s face in the candlelight the grief that had carved hollows under her eyes when she talked about the people she’d killed. The way she’d tried to leave the house, naked in the rain, ready to die rather than keep doing it. He’d felt sorry for her then. Pitied the guilt she carried.

Now he understood the weight of it.

How many families had she left like this? Widows who drank themselves numb? Sons who grew up mean because the world had taught them no one stayed? How many missing persons files ended with “presumed dead, no body”?

He almost vomited right there on the snow.

The group stood frozen. Riley looked anywhere but at Ethan. Lewis’s face stayed blank. Dylan kept grinning, waiting for applause that wasn’t coming.

But Ethan couldn’t stop the words. They tore out of him, raw and shaking.

“Why me?” he sobbed. “I did everything you told me to do. All these years, I watched your back! Why not Riley, you know he’s gonna snitch on you someday the first chance he gets!”

“Screw you, man!” Riley snapped, voice cracking higher than usual. He flinched as though Ethan had slapped him open-palm across the face.

“What about Lewis?” Ethan pleaded, turning his head toward the taller boy. “He doesn’t even pretend to care about you. He’d sell you out if he could get a sweet deal!”

Lewis’s hand reached in the direction of his coat pocket.

“Might need to knock some more sense into him,” Lewis said flatly, no heat in it, just fact.

Ethan ignored him. He stared at Edward, blood and tears mixing on his face. “Why didn’t you just ask me to do it? I would have gone with you. Hell shit I would have gone alone!”

Edward laughed, almost sad. “Honestly? I didn’t think you would be that dense.”

Ethan’s blood turned cold.

He could tell them. Could say the words: She’s real. She’s more than real. She’s in the walls, in the trees, in the ground. She took your father and she almost took me. She’s still hungry.

But he didn’t.

Instead, he found something sharper.

“Think he’d be proud of you?” Ethan asked, voice low. “Beating up your friends. Breaking into houses like a rat?”

Edward’s eyes narrowed. For a second the mask slipped just a flicker of something raw, something that looked almost like hurt.

Then he stepped forward and slapped Ethan.

The impact was open-handed, casual, almost contemptuous. Ethan’s head rocked sideways. Fresh blood filled his mouth.

Edward straightened. Looked down at him one last time. No apology. No explanation. Just the same tired calculation that had always lived behind his eyes.

“You can walk it off,” he said. “Ten miles to the highway. You’ve had worse nights.”

He nodded to the others.

They climbed into the Suburban without another word. Doors shut. Engine started. Taillights flared red, then shrank, then disappeared.

Ethan lay there until the sound of the tires faded completely.

Then he pushed himself up.

One rib screamed. Another cracked. His nose was swollen shut, blood still dripping in slow, warm ropes down his chin. His bad wrist still bandaged from Constance’s grip throbbed in time with his pulse.

He started walking.

The road was black, the sky blacker. No moon. No stars. Just the crunch of snow under boots that were already going numb. Every step sent fresh pain spiking through his side, but he kept moving because stopping meant freezing.

He thought about his mother’s voice, years ago, slurred and bitter: Part of life is learning everyone’s scared. Everyone. Grow up, Ethan.

This, he thought, tasting the copper in his mouth, the sting of cold in his lungs this must be what desperate tastes like.

He walked until his legs gave out.

He fell forward, palms slapping frozen dirt, breath fogging in painful bursts. The cold seeped up through his knees, his hips, his chest. He tried to stand. Couldn’t.

Then he saw it.

A faint red glow, low to the ground, pulsing softly against the trunk of a pine maybe twenty yards off the road.

The same ruby light he’d first seen in Constance’s eyes.

Ethan stared.

The glow brightened slightly, as if acknowledging him, then dimmed.

He crawled toward it.

The bark was warm impossibly warm when he pressed his palms to it. Heat sank into his skin, chased the numbness back. He leaned his forehead against the trunk and let out a shaky breath he hadn’t realized he’d been holding.

The glow faded.

Silence.

Then, deeper in the woods, another patch of red bark flickered to life. Brighter. Closer to the direction of the highway.

Ethan pushed himself up.

He limped toward it.

The pattern repeated: warm glow, brief comfort, darkness. Another glow farther on. Another. Guiding him, step by aching step, through the black.

He didn’t speak. Didn’t thank her. Didn’t ask why.

He just followed.

Until something moved in the underbrush.

A shape lean, gray, yellow eyes catching moonlight slunk out onto the path ahead of him. Coyote. Thin from winter, ribs sharp under fur. It lowered its head, lips peeling back.

Ethan froze.

The ground answered before he could.

Roots thick, black, veined with the same faint pink he remembered from the house exploded upward like fingers. They wrapped the coyote’s hind legs in an instant. The animal yelped, high and panicked, twisting as more roots coiled around its ribs, its throat.

It fought. Claws scraped bark. Teeth snapped at nothing.

Then the roots yanked downward.

The coyote vanished into the earth with one last, choked scream. Dirt settled. Silence returned.

Ethan stood trembling, staring at the spot where the animal had been.

She was here.

Miles from the house. In the trees. In the ground.

Still hungry.

Still watching.

He looked up at the canopy, at the black branches clawing the sky.

“What do you want from me?” he shouted. His voice cracked. “What the hell do you want?”

The forest didn’t answer.

Only another red glow flickered on, deeper down the path.

Ethan lowered his head.

He kept walking.

Ethan staggered out of the tree line just as the first gray light of false dawn touched the horizon. The highway shoulder appeared like a miracle cracked asphalt, a faded white line, the distant hum of a single semi passing miles away. His legs had gone beyond numb; they were heavy, foreign things that barely obeyed. Blood had crusted around his nose and mouth, his jacket was torn at the elbow, and every inhale felt like broken glass in his ribs.

He stood there swaying, breath fogging in the cold, and stared at the black SUV parked on the gravel apron fifty yards down the road. No plates. Engine idling low. Headlights off.

The driver’s door opened.

Intern Harlan stepped out same cheap wool coat, same tired eyes behind wire-rimmed glasses, same lanyard clipped to his belt. He looked exactly like a man who’d been up all night and expected to be up all night again. He didn’t speak until Ethan was close enough to smell the coffee on his breath.

“You look like shit,” Harlan said.

Ethan tried to laugh. It came out as a wet cough. “Feel like it too.”

“Name’s Harlan. I work for Voss.” He opened the passenger door without ceremony. “Get in before you freeze.”

Ethan didn’t argue. He collapsed into the seat, wincing as his ribs protested. The heater was already blasting. Harlan slid behind the wheel, shut the door, and pulled onto the highway without a word for the first mile.

Finally, Harlan spoke, eyes on the road. “She called us.”

Ethan’s head lolled against the window. “Who?”

“Don’t play dumb. Subject Ninety-Three. Constance. Whatever you call her. She told us exactly where you’d come out. Down to the mile marker. Said you’d be walking.” Harlan’s mouth twitched not quite a smile.  “She never asks for things.”

They drove in silence for another stretch. The heater hummed. Ethan’s teeth finally stopped chattering.

“She’s in the trees,” Ethan said quietly. “Miles from the house. All through the woods.”

“We know.” Harlan didn’t flinch. “We’ve always known.

“How?” Ethan asked.

“She imitates the house, gets bigger. Spreads out, eats in trees, imitates the trees. Rinse and repeat. There’s nothing we can really do about it.”

Ethan let out a short, bitter laugh that hurt his ribs. “That’s pathetic. Aren’t you people supposed to stop stuff like that?”

Ethan turned his head. “She only cares about her meal, right? That’s me. The pet she keeps alive.”

“Voss is the one who makes light of our business. Not me.” Harlan’s hands tightened on the wheel. “Nobody twisted your arm to teach her Gin Rummy. Speaking of which, how’s your wrist, kid?”

After such a savage beating, Ethan had nearly forgotten about his initial injury from Constance. He glared at this nameless, suited man but he had no energy to hate him. That was all spent up on Edward, the others, Constance a bit, but mostly himself.

They didn’t speak again until the city limits appeared streetlights, billboards, the familiar stink of exhaust and fast food.

Harlan pulled into Ethan’s driveway. The Civic sat there, gleaming under the porch light. Freshly washed. Tires new. Check-engine light gone.

“Your car,” Harlan said. “Fixed. Keys are in it.”

Ethan stared at the vehicle like it belonged to someone else.

Harlan killed the engine. “One more thing.”

Ethan waited.

“If you run,” Harlan said, voice flat, “we’ll always be after you. You either go back to placate her on your own, or we send you to her in one of the feeding barrels. Your choice.”

Ethan looked at him for a long moment. “That’s it?”

“That’s it.” Harlan didn’t offer a hand. Didn’t wish him luck. He just waited until Ethan opened the door and stepped out into the cold.

The SUV pulled away quietly. Ethan stood on the cracked sidewalk, watching the taillights disappear, then turned and limped up the steps.

Inside, the house smelled of dust and stale air. He didn’t bother with lights. Didn’t check his phone. He climbed the stairs, fell face-first onto the mattress, and slept like the dead.

He woke to knocking.

Afternoon light slanted through the blinds. His body felt like it had been run over, then left in the freezer overnight. The knocking came again soft, insistent, almost timid.

Ethan dragged himself downstairs, opened the door.

Edward and Dylan’s mother stood on the porch. Coat too thin for January, eyes red-rimmed, mascara tracked down her cheeks. She clutched a tissue like a lifeline.

“They never came home,” she whispered. Her voice cracked. “Edward and Dylan. They’re gone. They didn’t come back last night.”

Ethan’s stomach dropped.

She looked up at him, desperate. “Do you know where they are? Please, Ethan. You’re the only real friend they’ve ever had. They listen to you. Please get them home. They’re all I have left. Don’t let them leave me like their father did.”

The words hit like a second beating. Ethan opened his mouth, closed it. “I… I don’t know. They dropped me off last night. Said they were going somewhere else.”

She started to cry quiet, exhausted sobs. “Please. Just find them. Tell them their mom’s waiting.”

Ethan nodded numbly. “I’ll… I’ll try.”

She hugged herself and walked away, shoulders hunched against the wind.

Ethan closed the door. Leaned against it. Breathed.

He pulled his phone from his pocket dead. He found the charger, plugged it in. The screen lit up.

Twelve missed calls from Dylan.

They were messenger audio calls, not phone lines.

All from the last few hours.

Weird.

His thumb hovered over the name.

He hit call.

It rang once.

The line opened.

No greeting. No breathing. Just silence.

“Dylan?” Ethan said. “Look, your mom’s freaking out. She thinks you and Edward ditched her. You need to—”

“Ethan,” Constance said.

It was her voice. Soft. Low. Familiar.

Ethan’s legs buckled. He slid down the door until he sat on the floor, phone pressed hard to his ear.

“Constance?”

“Yeah.” A pause, long enough to hear the faint creak of wood somewhere far away. “Dylan threw my phone in the lake. I saw them through the trees. And what they did to you. Figured it’d be fair if I took his. As a start.”

“A st…” Ethan’s words wobbled, barely forming. “You took what?”

“I took his phone. It was in his pocket.”

Ethan’s ears rang. His free hand pressed against the floor like it could keep the room from spinning. “His… pocket?”

“Ethan. Breathe.” Her tone stayed gentle, almost patient. “They’re not dead. They’re with me.”

The implication landed like ice water down his spine.

With me.

In the house.

In the walls.

In the ground.

Ethan’s mouth opened and closed. Questions collided in his throat. “What… what are you doing with them? Are they did you how long—”

A soft exhale on the other end, almost a sigh. “I haven’t decided yet. They hurt you. They hurt you a lot. I saw it all. Every kick. Every word. I saw the way Edward looked at you when he left you on that road like you were nothing. Like you’d always been nothing.”

Ethan’s breath hitched. “Constance… please. They’re—”

“They’re alive,” she said again, cutting through the panic. “All four of them.”

Ethan swallowed hard. “Their mom… she was just here. Crying. She thinks they ditched her like their dad did. She’s terrified.”

A longer silence this time. When Constance spoke again, her voice had cooled, edged with something tired.

“She’ll probably have a rough time in the future.”

Ethan blinked. “What… what do you mean by that?”

The line crackled faintly, like wood settling.

“Good grief, Ethan.” Frustration bled through now, sharp and weary. “Do you know why I tried to end my own life? It’s because I thought I’d felt every kind of pain there was. But do you have any idea how hard it is to care about someone like you?”

Ethan’s chest tightened. “Constance, wait—”

“No,” she cut in, colder now. “You’re worried about their mom? Really? Ethan, she raised two wolves who beat you senseless and left you on the side of the road to freeze.”

“Constance, you killed their dad!” Ethan’s voice stuttered, breaking on the words. “I knew him. I grew up hearing stories about how he left them. But he didn’t. You took him.”

The line went so quiet he thought she’d hung up.

When she spoke again, her voice was dark, almost hollow. “Your mom died waiting for you to stand up for yourself. I’m not going to let them steal any more of your life from you.”

Ethan opened his mouth, but nothing came out.

The call ended with a soft click.

The screen went black.

Ethan sat on the floor, back against the door, staring at nothing.

The house stayed quiet around him.

Outside, January wind rattled the windows.

The sun was setting.

Ethan sat on the floor for what felt like hours, back pressed to the door, phone still warm in his hand. The screen had gone dark long ago. The house stayed quiet except for the faint rattle of the wind against the windows and the low, steady tick of the old wall clock.

He tried to think.

Call the police. That was the sane thing, right? Tell them four guys were missing. Tell them he’d heard Constance’s voice on Dylan’s phone. Tell them everything the dare, the house, the pink fluid, the red eyes, the roots dragging a coyote underground. They’d think he was crazy. They’d lock him up for observation, maybe, or laugh him out of the station. Voss’s people would be there within the hour, paperwork already prepared, and Ethan would vanish the same way Tyler McCormick had vanished. No trace. No body.

Drive. Just drive. Fill the tank, point the Civic south or west or anywhere the road kept going, and don’t stop until the money ran out or the engine seized. Voss’s man had said they’d always be after him. Maybe. But maybe not forever. People disappeared every day. Ethan could be one of them. A new name, a new state, a new life built on nothing. He’d done worse with less.

He lifted his head. The house felt smaller than it ever had too small to hold the weight of everything crashing down at once.

His eyes drifted across the floorboards, up the stairs he’d climbed a thousand times, and landed on the bedroom doorway.

The glove.

The old Rawlings baseball glove he’d left on the bed the night of the dare, like an offering to a father who’d never come back. Leather cracked, pocket still faintly scented with saddle soap and summer grass that wasn’t real anymore.

Ethan pushed himself up, legs shaking. He climbed the stairs slowly, one hand on the rail, ribs screaming with every step.

The glove was still there, exactly where he’d placed it months ago, palm up on the unmade sheets like it was waiting for someone to play catch.

He picked it up.

The weight felt different now. He turned it over in his hands, fingers tracing the worn stitching, the faded name scrawled in marker on the thumb: \*Ethan C.\*

His father had left when Ethan was six. No note. No goodbye. Just gone. No credit cards, no cash withdrawals, no sightings. The police had shrugged. “Deadbeat dads do this,” one of them had said, like it was a diagnosis. Ethan’s mother had agreed, bitter and drunk. Everyone had agreed.

Ethan stared at the glove.

Constance had killed Tyler McCormick. Swallowed him whole. Left two boys to grow up hating a ghost.

What if…

The thought hit like a slap.

What if she’d killed his father too?

The room tilted. Ethan staggered back until his calves hit the bed. He sat hard, glove clutched to his chest. His breathing turned shallow, fast. The despair that had been crushing him for years the abandonment, the loneliness, the certainty that he’d been thrown away suddenly inverted.

What if he hadn’t been thrown away?

What if he’d been halfway orphaned by the same monster who’d just told him, in that dark, hollow voice, that she wouldn’t let anyone steal any more of his life?

The rage came fast, hot, disorienting. His hands shook so badly the glove slipped from his fingers and fell to the floor.

Was that why she’d spared him?

Was that why she’d guided him through the woods with glowing bark, dragged a coyote under the earth to protect him, kept Edward and Dylan and the others alive for now?

Because she recognized the name?

Because she remembered the little boy whose father had walked into her clearing and never walked out?

Ethan’s vision tunneled. He could hear his own heartbeat, loud and wrong. The room felt too small, the air too thick.

He stood.

He didn’t think. He just moved.

Down the stairs. Through the front door. Onto the porch.

The Civic waited in the driveway, freshly washed, tires black and gleaming, keys already in the ignition like Harlan had known he’d need them. It was luck no one had stolen it, that would be one form of justice for all the theft Ethan had enabled and taken part in over the years.

Maybe that was the last of his luck.

Ethan got in.

The engine turned over smoothly first try in months. The check-engine light stayed dark.

He gripped the wheel so hard his knuckles went white.

He could go to the police.

He could drive away forever.

Or he could go back.

He slammed the shifter into reverse, tires spitting gravel, and peeled out of the driveway.

The city lights blurred past. He drove like a madman too fast, too reckless, cutting corners, running reds, the speedometer climbing into territory the Civic had never seen. He’d been pulled over for far less, but today of all days, police were no where to be found. Horns blared. Headlights flashed. He didn’t care.

The woods appeared ahead, black and waiting. The gravel lot wasn’t empty when he skidded to a stop. The engine ticked as it cooled.

Edward’s car was there. The empty wagon was parked at the side, and Ethan squinted to inside.

Dylan’s gun was visible on the floor of the front passenger seat. Ethan tried to open the car door but it was locked. He looked around, saw he was alone except the trees.

The trees. If Constance could see him and guide him and kill a coyote from over 20 miles away, surely she could do the same now. She knew he was here. He wondered if she knew that if he saw her right then he…he…

Ethan didn’t know. He thought about it, didn’t like the answer. He was here to kill her. Because she killed his father? That made sense. It made enough sense.

Ethan went back to his car and reached into the cupholder on the car door. There was an orange tool there a seatbelt cutter with a fine metal tip at the end of it’s handle.

A glass breaker.

Ethan hammered the window of Edward’s passenger window, imagined Dylan’s head he was cracking instead of the glass. He thought of their mother, and decided that was wrong. He hammered again and again and again until the window shattered. Ethan unlocked the car from the inside, opened the door, and grabbed the gun.

He realized the glass breaker was still in his hand, and he looked at the black suburban with total disdain. It was the car he’d ridden along with the people he believed was his friends.

Ethan went around the car and broke every window. First the driver’s, then the back windows. He even broke both of the windshields and slammed the orange tool into the hood of suburban a few times until his lungs burned.

Ethan dropped the glass breaker and stopped to breath The cold bit into his face, his bruised ribs, his everything.

He didn’t know where his friends were, other than generally in the house itself. He didn’t know how Constance had lured them here, if they were still alive or not.

Ethan didn’t care. He wasn’t there for them…

He looked at the tree line.

The path was there, narrow and dark, same as always.

He started walking.

He didn’t know what he was going to say when he reached the house.

He didn’t know if he was going to beg, scream, or demand answers.

Or just shoot her the first chance he got. He knew it wouldn’t work. If Voss had thrown everything the government had to offer, what could an illicit handgun do? Constance had tried to kill herself, and even she wasn’t sure if it was possible or not.

He only knew one thing:

If Constance had taken his father, she was going to tell him why.

And then he was going to put a bullet into her head.

One day as I was working around 4pm a man came in around early 30s and a woman around the same age. They ordered simple things like a latte and americano and sat down at one of the back tables. I obviously didn’t think anything of it and was focused on counting down the hours to leaving. The next day he came in again, same time, same order, same table, but new woman. I once again didn’t think much of it, I thought maybe it was a client or family, really anything. But then as the days and weeks added up, he came in with a different woman every single day. I talked to some of my coworkers and asked them if they’ve seen a man with his description and they all said yes and then we started keeping tabs on him. Kinda weird but we’re all in our 20s and have nothing else to do. All of us talked about if we should say something or confront him but we didn’t even know the whole story so we decided not to. Like what would we say? something like “what’s your job? I’ve always seen you in here with a new people everyday?” I’m not sure why we thought it would work but we were all so invested. The next day my mom called me and told me she that she called her sister and she said that she met some distant family that just moved into town a couple months ago and wanted to go meet up with them and I agreed cause once again I’m in my 20s and have nothing else to do. So the next week I worked a couple shifts, saw the guy come in with new women and than one night the guy came in with no one. He ordered an americano and sat in the back and stared at me for an hour. I was freaked out and went to the back and called one of my coworkers. We chatted about the guy and when I came back he was gone. I was left with a weird feeling but continued my shift. The next day I was having lunch with my mom and my distant family. As I walked to our table I saw him. The man from the coffee shop, at the table with my aunt and other distant relatives. I stood in shock until my mom looked back and tugged on my arm asking what was wrong. I told her what happened and she said “it must be someone else, let’s go”. We sat down and his eyes locked on my face and he went pale. He knew I knew what he was doing. He knew I was the barista, he knew i saw him with all those girls. In the middle of dinner I went to the bathroom and I walked out and he was on the wall outside. He looked at me and said “ you cannot tell them, they think I’m celibate. You can’t tell them” I was kinda confused because why would I say he’s having sex many women. I mean I wasn’t even going to bring it up because it’s not really my business. So I told him I wouldn’t, after that he kept insisting I would tell them and he said he would pay me to not tell anyone anything. Then he began to tell me how almost all of them were married and that he was also married and how his wife doesn’t satisfy him and that divorce is scary to him and other random ass details I didn’t ask for. Also why would you tell me more of a story you w want me to tell anyone. I honestly thought he was like going crazy or on something. He also added he would pay me tens of thousands of dollars. I told him I don’t need any of his money and that i wouldn’t tell anyone. I walked back to the table and around ten minutes later he also returned and then our dinner ended and I went home. I don’t really have anything else in the story only that I quit that job and moved in with my sister to Florida and I work at a smoothie shop now.

I wanted to take a moment and update this group that I passed my CISM on 28th of Dec. Received my official results on email today (7th Jan), exactly 10 calendar days from the day of the test.

This Sub Reddit has been extremely helpful to me to gain confidence for the exam and prepare for it. I wanted to pay it forward by sharing my experience.

As you already know, CISM tests your managerial thinking more than your Cybersecurity understanding. Once you align yourself to this frame of mind and if you have enough experience dealing with security initiatives either in your company or at your customer, you can pass this exam with 1 week of preparation. Probably a bold statement, yes, but it is doable.

I have over a decade of cybersecurity sales experience. This is my first major Cyber certification. I had taken CC by ISC2 when it was offered for free initially in 2022.

I prepared for a week for this exam doing the following:

Went through the official QAE database cover to cover twice

Skimmed through the official study guide

Watched Prabh Nair’s Coffee Shots while I was bored or in the middle of chores. Lifesaver. What a great guy, honestly!

Watched/Skimmed through other CISM videos that appeared on my YT feed.

Went to the exam without worrying much.

So yes, all of you have got this! All the best. Happy to answer any questions.

# Vibes, or What Paul Graham Would Say

Taiwan is nice. By what definition of nice? you ask. To which I answer: all of them.

The place itself is nice. It’s just nice to be there and walk around and exist, even if you’re not there for a particular reason or doing anything particularly exciting or fun. This is what Paul Graham would have felt if he had included Taipei in his [Cities and Ambition](http://www.paulgraham.com/cities.html).

[](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4_KM!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F99cbca82-5647-4216-b641-b3c22a2fbc55_1000x1333.jpeg)

The people are nice. Everyone we interacted with had a smile on their face and love in their heart. We never felt direct pressure to buy anything or tip or really do anything at all; we were just left alone to do as we pleased. There’s also an air of trust throughout the country, a feeling that you can leave your laptop in a coffee shop or door unlocked and be just fine and whole when you come back.

The weather is nice. Although we did go during one of the best times of the year and about a week or two after a typhoon, the temperature was moderate and we didn’t experience any crazy weather. (If you’ve been during the summer, you may be scoffing at this paragraph.)

The parks within the city are nice—the landscaping is well-groomed and designed and there are the perfect amount of benches with and without shade. The grass is green and the flowers colorful. The museums are well-curated, informative without going into too much detail, and clean.

The food is nice, but that deserves its own section.

Is this place a utopia? An argument could be made.

# Food, or Why I Now Feel a Deep Pain When I Eat Back Home

The food here is as amazing as it is plentiful as it is cheap as it is varied. Restaurants line every street and alleyway; some are crowded with lines and others are empty with bored shopowners twiddling their thumbs, but both have plenty of food at the ready for the next hungry customer. Nor are the restaurants the same. Sure, beef noodles and buns remain some of the staple dishes, but plenty of other options exist, from [turnip cakes (lo bak go)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnip_cake) to Chinese omelettes to [Taiwanese burgers (koah-pau)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koah-pau) to steamed buns to raw eel. The tastiness is also top-notch, although we probably filtered out most of the bad places using Google reviews.

Did I mention cheap? Taiwanese meals were many times cheaper than the American equivalent because everything's cheaper there: labor, ingredients, real estate. Competition is fierce and forces the market to drop prices to keep up. I love free markets.

And healthy(-ish)! Fruits, vegetables, rice, and meats, particularly pork and fish, are staples in diets here, which, all things considered, is fairly healthy. There are definitely fried foods. Desserts aren’t as obviously laden with sugar and trans fat. It’s incredibly easy to eat healthy food while out and about.

Comparative advantage can be seen in the flesh here by watching just how many Taiwanese people eat out for their meals. The food is cheaper because the restaurants and vendors buy in bulk and it’s more delicious because, well, they’re chefs and have practiced their craft for quite some time. In multi-generation homes (i.e., children, parents, and grandparents all live together), the grandparents will often get groceries from the local street markets during the day and have food ready for everyone when they get home. As an aside, I’ve heard in that in a southeast Asian country (I forgot which) all social classes go out to eat at street vendors or restaurants—it’s not just the poor out eating street and fast food while the rich dine in or the rich out eating at fancy restaurants while the poor scrape by on rice and beans at home. I got a similar feeling in Taiwan that nobody was above eating street food.

Like everywhere with any business, the places that had massive lines or were filled up with customers were often the most delicious, the most TikToked/Instagrammed, or some combination of both. A donut shop we walked by had almost 80 people in line! Thankfully most of these places seem to have mastered the art of the ""here's your food now pay quickly and GTFO but in the nicest way possible so we can get more business and you can enjoy our food"".

The night markets are pretty awesome. Smells, sights, and sounds galore. You can grab some stinky tofu in one booth, turn around and play some carnival games, go to the next booth for some okinomiyaki because it turns out stinky tofu isn't your thing and the person you're with almost vomited from the smell, then buy some shirts and trinkets in another section. There are also so many people from all walks of life: families and friends, young and old, locals and foreigners. Like I said above, night markets welcome all demographics and shun none.

All of this makes Taiwan a food lover’s paradise. Cheap, unique, and delicious food is everywhere, served up by friendly people.

(In case it wasn’t obvious why I feel a deep pain now, it’s because an average meal in my home city costs somewhere around $15 (I’m a cheap bastard and want $3 meals again) and I often can’t simply walk to it from my apartment (I’m a lazy bastard and want it right next door). The variety is definitely available, though.)

Before looking it up, I guessed the obesity rate of Taiwan is 15%. The actual number is [12.5%](https://data.worldobesity.org/rankings/).

And for some specific recommendations in no particular order:

* Taipei:
   * [Sihai Soy Milk](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g13806451-d8735120-Reviews-Sihai_Soy_Milk-Datong_Taipei.html): Gotta get here early to beat the rush. Everything is good.
   * [Di Yi Beef Noodle Restaurant](https://wanderlog.com/place/details/12566991/di-yi-beef-noodle-restaurant): Don’t ask. Just go.
   * [Rahoe Fuzhou Pork Pepper Buns](https://migrationology.com/raohe-night-market/): So delicious. Most pepper buns with meat will probably do, but these were especially tasty.
* Tainan:
   * [Neighbors Baking](https://www.instagram.com/neighborsbaking/): A very nice woman who specializes in cream puffs.
   * [井佐製所ケーキ](https://www.instagram.com/jing_zuo_zhi_suo/): Cake shop with a cozy interior and delicious tea.
   * [Tianmianjiang](https://www.facebook.com/teamenjoin): Homey spot with Taiwanese classics.

# Fun Food Facts

Taiwan is a land of superstition and it shows in two food-related ways:

* [Pineapple](https://eng.moa.gov.tw/ws.php?id=9444): In Taiwanese the pronunciation of the word pineapple sounds like a propitious blessing of good fortune and future prosperity. ... The pineapple has been referred to in traditional culture as the best gift for a house warming party and upon the opening of a new business or to wish one’s favorite political candidate success at the election boxes. Bittersweetly, lawyers, nurses, and police officers are exempt from this tasty tradition because if their job is prosperous, it means crime and sickness.
* [Kuai Kuai culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuai_Kuai_culture): A phenomenon in Taiwan wherein people put snacks of the brand Kuai Kuai next to or on top of machines. People who do this believe that, because the name of the snack—”Kuai Kuai”—stands for “obedient” or “well-behaved,” it will make a device function without errors. Apparently [TSMC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSMC) is a big proponent of this. Maybe this is their secret sauce, not their insane work culture!

# Cleanliness, or Where All the Trash Cans At?

Walking around any streets you’d think that Taiwan had invented the [2 nm transistor node](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2_nm_process) before trash cans. They are few and far in between for a few apparent reasons that I can deduce or find online:

* Having to hold your trash makes you a bit more conscious about your consumption
* Having to hold your trash until you get home encourages proper sorting of trash vs. recycling. Taiwan’s [recycling rate is an astounding 55%](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/how-taiwan-has-achieved-one-highest-recycling-rates-world-180971150/), compared to the [U.S.’s 32%](https://www.epa.gov/facts-and-figures-about-materials-waste-and-recycling/national-overview-facts-and-figures-materials#:~:text=Together%2C%C2%A0%20almost%2094%20million%20tons%20of%20MSW%20were%20recycled%20and%20composted%2C%20equivalent%20to%20a%2032.1%20percent%20recycling%C2%A0and%20composting%20rate).
* Fewer trash cans means less smell, fewer overflowing cans, and fewer rats and pests per unit area

There’s an unspoken rule about being able to pop into any of the numerous 7/11s to dispose of small items. We came up with the system of using a small bag to hold our trash while we walked around. For households, trash trucks drive around playing their version of ice cream truck music to notify residents that they better get outside to throw away their garbage.

Litter was almost non-existent, even in the extremely crowded night markets where it’s easy to drop stuff and difficult to pick up. There was even a human street sweeper outside our hotel sweeping leaves into a dust bin.

Unsurprisingly, there are some bad apples who litter. And unsurprisingly, the local populace doesn’t take too well to it, opting to shame them (and I’m sure name them if they could) through screenshots of security camera footage. Taiwanese Liam Neeson ready to hunt down litterbugs might make for a good advertising campaign!

“I will find you. And I will make you pick up that piece of trash.” (I also love how it’s from 2023 and is still posted like they have Taiwan’s biggest grudge)

Read a bit more about Taiwan trash [here](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/separation-anxiety/).

# Orderliness, or Getting In Line Almost Literally Everywhere

The Taipei metro is very orderly. New riders patiently wait in a single-file line marked on the floor while the old riders get off, then get on when the coast is clear. Nobody plays music out loud. Nobody talks on their phone. Few people talk to each other. All you really hear is the noise of train on the rails. It’s eerily quiet and calm compared to the [complete and utter chaos that is New York City’s subway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNDQ9oY0fS4). But this is exactly how it should be by default; if I wanted crazy, I’d go to the club or bad part of town.

# Transportation, or You Better Learn How to Ride On Two Wheels

Scooters reign supreme. Parking is easier to find and actually perform; the low(er) speeds of cars are less likely to kill you in a collision; infrastructure is made for you (there is a scooter-only section in front of cars at stop lights). I don’t think I’ve ever seen so many scooters in one place. It’s comical watching tens of scooters drive around a roundabout like they’re in a Mario Kart race.

Walking is second in command on the transportation hierarchy. The metro is never more than a few minutes’ walk away. Bikes are available for rent if you really need one. The climate (for us) was generally pleasant and made walking pleasant by extension.

All vehicles are super courteous to pedestrians, except for that one guy in Tainan who almost ran me over because he was looking at his phone.

# Language, or Using My Hands and Smile For Most Interactions

Mandarin and English are high-class, Taiwanese is middle-class, and Hakka, the tribal language, is low-class, like you’re coming from a Native American reservation. At least this is what our food tour guide told us. If you want a high-class job, learn Mandarin. This goes against my intuition of the Taiwanese government wanting to keep the Taiwanese language at the forefront because it continues to make them culturally different than mainland China, further separating the identity of the Taiwanese people from Chinese people.

I’ve never read Chinese characters before. For whatever reason I incorrectly assumed there would be a pretty standard font, but nope, turns out they have their own Calibris and Arials and Times New Romans for us foreigners to struggle with! My first run-in with this was at a breakfast spot we had already visited. The first time we went a very kind Taiwanese-American woman helped us order, showing us the where the pictured menu items were on the actual text-only order ticket itself. Easy peasy. I came back a few days later, confident that I could replicate it. Nope. I spent 10 minutes meticulously comparing the menu to the ticket to find exactly what I wanted. Damn you and your beautiful fonts, Taiwanese typographists!

Most people barely spoke English, forcing us to quickly adapt by pointing, holding up numbers with our fingers, and having a beaming smile to make sure we were friendly and not at all miffed by their lack of English. The “worst” ESL interaction we had was when we ordered a breakfast item and she came back with a Google Translate screen that said “Chinese medicine”. Me, in my infinite awkwardness when in another country and not being able to speak the language, simply nodded yes and prayed that it’s what we wanted. It came out looking normal, tasted normal, and I didn’t experience any crazy side effects, so I think Google just had a brain fart.

# Cartoons, or Na Na Na Na Boo Boo We’re More Fun Than You

Everything is cartoonized. Wet floor signs, condom advertisements, crosswalk signs reminding you to press the button, street art, bike vs. pedestrian lane reminders, some sign that looks to be about karaoke that I couldn’t translate, entrances to buildings and storefronts. You name it, there’s probably a cartoon version of it somewhere in Taiwan. Call it rule 35.

And all of it was lovely. It screamed “we can have fun while still conveying pertinent info” instead of screaming “we are a boring society and must convey pertinent info in the most boring way possible for reasons we haven’t really thought about”. Have some pizzazz for crying out loud! Don’t just use a wet floor sign, use a wet floor sign in the shape of a banana! Don’t just make a sign that says the name of your business, make a sign that gives the info with a fun little mascot! Don’t be boring, be fun!

# Miscellaneous, or Random Info That Doesn’t Really Fit Anywhere Else

[Taipei 101](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taipei_101)‘s [tuned mass damper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuned_mass_damper) system is flippin’ awesome and well worth the $25 it costs to see in person. Here’s a [video of it working during an earthquake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tkz6b7Q3dRk). T101 also houses what used to be the world’s fastest elevator at a top speed of 60.6 kmh or 37.7 mph.

The dress code is super casual: good-looking and comfortable was the criteria most people seemed to use. I saw very few suits while out and about. Taiwanese Redditors seem to [confirm this](https://www.reddit.com/r/taiwan/comments/1p7tfy9/do_taiwanese_dress_up_for_anything/). For weddings, dressing up doesn’t matter nearly as much as how thick the [hóngbāo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_envelope) you bring is.

Bidets are widely used over here. Nice hotels seems to offer heated-seat bidets by default.

The [Grand Hotel in Taipei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Hotel_(Taipei)) was awesome for our last night’s stay. They have tours of their once-secret tunnels (one of them even has an emergency slide, but alas, you aren’t able to ride it due to “safety concerns”—I expressed my disappoint to some chuckles and a polite “you’re not the first!”). We discovered that Grand Hotel weddings are highly sought after when we walked in upon 20+ wedding-dressed couples standing in line (of course) to take their pictures in front of the Christmas tree and staircase.

Cash is still king. Don’t get caught without a few hundred NTD on your person, otherwise it may be a bit awkward when it comes time to pay. Easy Cards are convenient and you can get some cool designs at any 7/11. Some (bigger) places accept credit cards.",1,1767829449.0,TravelNoPics,1,0.67,False

I mean, sure, I was there for drugs and alcohol use that much is true. I was using anything that promised enlightenment, or at least a break from shitty existence. But now that I’m ""sober"", suddenly everything I say is a “delusion.” Funny how that works right? Like. You spend years being numb, nobody listens. You start noticing things, telling anyone and everyone, and BOOM! It’s stupid group therapy and orange juice and crackers.

They told me I should “ground myself.” which, like, that that’s ironic, by the way. Ground myself. On what? The thing that the government pretends is not alive.

Anyway. Hi. This is me grounding myself, I guess. By typing. On the internet. So grounded. If I don’t write this down, I’m pretty sure it’s going to start making sense to someone else that has the power to make me dissapear, and I’d really rather get ahead of that.

Let’s start simple. The Earth isn’t dead.
Yeah, yeah I know I know roll your eyes. I did too. I actually laughed the first time the thought crossed my mind. I remember exactly where I was. Detox wing. Third night. Shaking VIOLENTLY. I thought, wow,  good job brain, way to take it like a champ.

Except then I kept thinking about it, right. And then I stopped thinking for a while, but then I saw this whistleblower guy post online about a massive space creature coming towards us. And I thought, hey, either he's crazy and posting his ramblings so I can too, or he's not crazy and speaking the truth, and that makes me not crazy by proxy. Let me try my best to explain.

The Earth never stops moving, you know that, right? Not metaphorically and not in the ""duh its always spinning"" way. Constant vibration. A low level hum that never shuts off. And.. even when there aren’t earthquakes. Even when nothing is “happening.” Its still ""happening.""

Here’s a fun one they don’t tell you in rehab for a tie in. Human brains never stop firing either. Even in sleep. Even in coma. Even when you’re “quiet.”

“Why do you think the Earth would be alive?”

I replied

“Why do you think it wouldn’t be?”

Bodies.

I’ve lived in one my whole life, so I've got a good idea what it does. It breaks when I poison it. It sweats. It purges. It burns itself to kill what’s inside. Oh wow. Sound familiar?

They say mass extinctions are random or a cause of what we do. Accidents. Bad luck. Asteroids. Volcanos. Too much CO2. Oops! All death! Our bad!

I’m not saying the Earth hates us or anything. But that’s the fun part. Everyone jumps straight to hate when I start talking like this. Like that’s the only motivation we understand. No no no no no. I think we’re more like… like bacteria. Or a rash. Or that mold in the corner of the shower you keep meaning to clean but can't because your friend keeps inviting you out but everytime you go out you end up getting wasted and too drunk to worry about problems not related to getting more drunk. Sorry, metaphor got away from me. But we don't normally hate mold or trash, we just clean it.

And what if the Earth isn’t layered the way we think. What if it’s just like folded. Curled inward. Like... like an animal protecting its organs or curled to stay warm. Like a body in a fetal position.

I didn’t say that part out loud. I’m not stupid.

The withdrawal taught me something important. See pain has patterns and bodies announce or warn us. And shit, I think the Earth’s been announcing itself for a long time.

Volcanoes and pressure vents, seams splitting open. Heat rising. Oceans warming like a fever. That's what we call a response.

They asked me if I thought the Earth was “waking up.” or something

I said yes. If the other guy was right and there is some massive thing flying through space at us, it's like tossing a perfect treat to a sleeping dog.

What you’re looking at

   •   🚚 Base vehicle: Full-size pickup truck (custom show build)

   •   🍩 Wheels: Giant donut-shaped tires covered in candy / sprinkle-style spheres (often gumballs or molded plastic)

   •   ☕ Purpose: Promotional display for Tim Hortons coffee & donuts

   •   🇨🇦 Where: Canada (often seen at fairs, car shows, and brand events)

Why it exists

Tim Hortons is famous for:

   •   Donuts

   •   Coffee

   •   Over-the-top brand loyalty in Canada

This truck was built to be:

   •   Instantly recognizable

   •   Photo-friendly

   •   Ridiculously memorable

It’s not meant for real driving at speed — it’s a static or very low-speed show vehicle.

Category it belongs to

This fits perfectly into:

   •   Novelty / promotional vehicles

   •   Brand mascot cars

   •   Fiberglass show trucks

   •   “World’s weirdest wheels” builds

It’s basically the Canadian cousin to:

   •   The Oscar Mayer Wienermobile

   •   Peanut Planters’ Nutmobile

   •   Giant hot dog / food mascot vehicles

Why it looks so absurd (on purpose)

   •   Donut wheels break all normal car logic

   •   Candy texture exaggerates the “sweet” theme

   •   Lifted truck stance adds monster-truck drama",1,1767828996.0,WeirdWackyCars,0,1.0,False

Farmacy Brighten Up 3% TXA Dark Spot Toner: this was my second bottle and didn’t do anything. I’m on prescription azelaic acid now.

Trader Joe’s Supreme Hydrating Eye Cream: hated it! Did nothing and smelled like expired expo markers.

Tonymoly I’m Coffee Scrub: this was fun but unnecessary. Smells more like chocolate than coffee. 

NYX Fat Lip Oil in Missed Call: loved this! But the doe foot fell off right when I was going to take the stopper out, and took it as a sign to let it go.

Laniege Lip Sleeping Mask in Berry: a feat! At the start of the year I was about 60% done and I committed to using it every night. Truly lasts forever. I have 2 minis I’m working on now. Will repurchase eventually.

Pyunkang Yul Calming Barrier Cream: I got this at TJMaxxx because I was intrigued. It was nice and light for my oily skin, but didn’t feel like it moisturized well. Sticking to my tried and true Cerave!

Redken Acidic Bonding Concentrate: meh, no change to my hair. Not worth it to me.

Fable & Mane Hair Oil: smells nice but also did nothing for my hair.

Maybelline Lash Sensational: hated it for the first 2 months because it was soooo wet. Was better when it dried down but not as good as other drugstore mascaras.

Olaplex No.3 Hair Perfector: love! Made my hair less frizzy/tangly. I bought a bigger bottle.

La Roche Posay Toleriane Purifying Foaming Cleanser Refill: a holy grail!!! Will forever repurchase for my oily skin.

Dove Intensive Repair Conditioner: not bad, not great. Didn’t improve anything but didn’t make it worse either. I prefer a more hydrating product.

Love Beauty and Planet Shampoo/Conditioner in Sun-kissed Mandarin: LOVE. I have scent memories tied to this, including my wedding day and the day my son was born (brought these exact bottles to the hospital 🥹). I hope they never discontinue this scent!

BBW Guilty as Fig Body Cream: hated it at first, then loved it! I have a backup, plus the fine fragrance mist and body wash. It’s a clean scent that’s not overly girly.

BBW Champagne Apple Honey Body Lotion: great scent for the fall! I also have the matching mini fine fragrance mist and almosttttt done with the body wash.

Saltair Body Wash in Seascape: this was mostly in the guest bathroom, but it’s overall a crowd-pleasing scent! Would repurchase but I have a million body washes to go through.

1q6vk9v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bahrain/comments/1q6vk9v/finding_work_as_a_local/,Finding work as a local,"Greetings folks,

I intend to have this discussion with Bahrainis who are either working minimum wage jobs, in the F&B/Hospitality industry, or unemployed.  I'm not even sure if this demographic is sized enough for me to find any who fit this description here in this subreddit, so others who have valuable input, feel free to share your thoughts.

I entered the job market right after finishing high school in 2018, I've mostly worked customer facing roles where I had to interact with people on a daily basis, until later on where I found my interest in F&B/Hospitality, so I continued my career in restaurants and coffee shops, and during that time I've acquired a few certifications along the way and I learned as much as I can.

Now that puts me in a narrow demographic group within the job market because for most of the jobs I've worked, I was the only Bahraini.  The majority of the workforce in this field here is expats.  I state this to help you understand where I'm coming from.

That brings me to August, last year, I've been applying daily to any job I can find through the Ministry of Labor, Indeed, and handing my CV to companies offices.  I never got a call back for the first two months.  Later on when I started getting calls for interviews, I get told that I have good work experience and such, and that they'll be in contact with me, only to never hear back from them.

On one occasion where I applied as a housekeeper at an international hotel franchise that owns a few hotels in the region, the interviewer asked, ""why did you apply for this position when you can get something way better when your skills are in demand"", to which I replied, ""I'd take any job I can for the time being until I can find something better because I got obligations and I cannot go on without employment"", he then promised me a job at one of the restaurants they own by the start of November (last year), then he took my number and said he'd call.  I haven't heard back from him till now.

On that November, I took an interview with a company running a couple of restaurants in the region, they offered me a job on the spot, I signed the offer letter and sent them my documents, I was told to wait for the contract.  They haven't contacted me since.

On that same month, another company running coffee shops and restaurant franchises took me in for an interview, they were very interested and considered hiring me for a managerial position, they called me in for three different interviews, each asking less work related questions and more on the personal side.  After that I was told I'll get a call within a week.  Next week came and I tried calling them and wrote a message.  I haven't got a reply still, not even a rejection message where they tell me they're moving on with a different candidate, just ignored.

That leaves me with the most recent and most ridiculous one.  I got called through the ministry for a job interview with a coffee shop franchise, the interviewer there was happy with my experience and invited me to meet the manager as a final stage for the interview, the manager, despite seeing my work history in my CV, kept asking me how serious I am about this job, considering that they're looking for someone who is willing to stay and grow within the company, to which I assured him, that I wouldn't find reason to quit if I have a future in this company.  He then told me to send in my documents and he'll prepare my offer.

After a few days, I get a call that they'd like me to attend one of their branches to work a part-time shift for evaluation purposes, and to bring in my own uniform.  I haven't seen an offer letter yet, let alone a contract, but still I went that morning and worked with two  of the laziest crewmates I had encountered, their merchandise shelves had a thick layer of dust, it looked like it hasn't been wiped for months, their espresso machine and thermometer weren't properly calibrated, their workplace had more than a few HACCP violations, and so on.  But I was in no position to judge, I'm a new employee and I needed the job, so I did what I was told and I carried the shift, up to a point where both my crewmates were sitting in the back having a chat, while I was the only one working in the floor.

I finished my shift and a week passed by, and I haven't heard back from them.  So I tried calling HR, without getting an answer, I sent a message, didn't get a reply.  So I went in to their office and asked to meet with the HR, the receptionist told me he's off, but I can call him instead, to which I told her that I've been calling, but not getting an answer, so she called from her phone and gave me to speak to him.

I inquired about the status of my employment to which he said I've been rejected because I ""organized my work area without consulting my supervisor first, and that it is a violation of the brand standards"".  Mind you, I was never briefed of such by the supervisor, and not considering the supervisor's absence during the majority of my shift.  That's why a probationary period exists in every job, so you can understand the nuances and the ways of your new workplace.  But this isn't one of those instances, they wanted to manufacture an excuse because they couldn't find another reason to deny me.

Needless to say, I was once again promised a job, then later given a manufactured excuse to be denied the job.

Pardon me for the lengthy drama tale I've had you reading, but it needed telling to give you perspective of my point of view.  At last, let me get to the point of writing this post.

It seems to me that in this line of work, no matter how much you try to give your best, no matter how many times you put work above everything including your own health in some cases, in the end of the day, employers always tend to favor foreign labor over local.  What confuses me though, is how even if it is more profitable and reasonable to hire a local, given that they won't be liable to pay for work permits and visa fees, and in some cases, accommodation, transportation, and even an airline ticket for their vacation, they'd still go with the foreign.

This isn't one of those instances where they can give the ""Bahrainis don't want to work these jobs"" excuse, because I took few interviews for sales positions too, where I got denied because I don't have past sales experience.  But this right here is where I got all my experience and I still can't even land a job washing dishes.

And this also isn't one of those instances where there aren't enough jobs, because every where I see, restaurants, hotels, and coffee shops are always hiring.

You'd think these minimum wage regulations will help protect Bahrainis?  I'm so late in my loan payments that they're threatening to take me to court, and I've burnt through the last bit of my savings by last month I don't even have a clue how I'm going to feed my child and wife this month.  Working a full time job earning 150 BHD is better than working nothing and earning nothing.  And this privilege I cannot have because I am a Bahraini, protected by ""minimum wage regulations"".

The recent push to increase work permit fees for foreign labor is only going to drive the price of consumer goods up, it won't incentivize hiring locally.  They'll just find a way to push down these costs for the consumer to pay.

If you cannot relate to my experience, you can discard my rant.  These issues are systemic and cannot be fixed without reform.",3,1767828973.0,Bahrain,1,1.0,False

1q6vgfb,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1q6vgfb/harsh_news/,Harsh news,"Throw away account for obvious reasons.  M(38) wife 42(F).  Married 8 years, no kids, both professionals.  Live in a major city in the southwest.  Learning the lingo after reading this site, the marriage is a dead bedroom.  We don’t have arguments or disagreements.  We just have a sort of nothing.  Home has become a kind constant low-level hum of stress.  We don’t talk.  We don’t touch.  Nothing I have tried to improve the situation has worked.  Nothing.  After doing very well in high-tech I went out on my own a few years, took a flyer.  One-man consulting firm.  Most of my clients are law firms looking for my expertise, and even in these times of digital technology, face-to-face meetings are still necessary.  Though it makes financial sense to work from the house I don’t because I don’t want to be home.  So, renting a small office in downtown office building which is closer to most of my heavy weight clients.  Concentrating on the business.  

I began to frequent coffee shop on the first floor in the building next to mine.  First thing in the morning, again often times early afternoon for a caffeine pick-me-up.  The shop also serves pastries, premade breakfast sandwiches, that kind of thing.  Closes at three in the afternoon and on the weekends. Being a frequent customer, I got to know the woman who manages the place, directs the couple of employees there.  For the purposed of this posting I will call her Grace.  I would say she is ten years younger than me, just a guess.  At first the conversations were light-hearted, and innocent.  I have been out of the game so long it took me a while to realize when she began flirting with me.  Honestly, my self-confidences in matters of romance was so low I never expected it.  I don’t wear a wedding band, but I had noted Grace wore a wedding ring.  This seems childish I know but one afternoon she asked if I was married.  I said ‘barely.’  She said ‘my favorite, a married man running loose.  Or are you chasing?’  Quite frankly I was damn near catatonic.  It was as if a blasting cap had gone off inside me.  I said, ‘well, chasing or running, want to come watch the storm roll in across the river this afternoon?  My office is on the 18^(th) floor and it will be a great view.”  She said “I’ll be there about 4:00.”

I felt a fool waiting for her, not really expecting her.   But she did show up.  I noticed she had changed out of her working clothes.  We sat by the window and watched the clouds roll in, sipped some red wine, held hands like kids.  Good conversation.  Then we made love on the leather sofa in my office. It was warm, sweet, wild, relentless.  My whole self was letting go into something I had been lacking so long.

This was in early September.  The way it worked when I would get my afternoon coffee she would ask if my calendar was free later that day.  I began to try and always arrange for my calendar to be open in the late afternoons.  It was her call, up to her.  She made her boundaries clear.  We never called each other.  We never emailed or messaged each other. I did not, and do not, know her phone number.  After our afternoons together, I would go by my gym on the way home, wash the sex off.   Not sure what she did after the left me.  Don’t know where she lives.  The weekends were hard for me.  I wanted to check in with her, say hello, but that was against the rules, and I didn’t know how anyway.   On work days when neither of use had the late afternoons free, at least we got to say hello and check in when I got my afternoon coffee.

As I better got to know her I learned Grace is intelligent, witty, with a wicked sense of humor.  She has had many adventures and twists and turns in her life.  We never spoke of her marriage, or of mine.  That was one of the rules.  The story of how she became the manager of a coffee shop, and why, would be her story to tell, not mine.  While I was learning more about her, the love making got better and better.  Grace was adventurous, creative.  The record was six work days in a row.   Sometimes we would just talk, no sex.  When it was going to be love making, Grace would take off her ring and put it on the table, put it back on when she left.  There was both a symbolic and practical dimension to that action.  Three times she agreed to meet me in a fine hotel downtown for a change of pace.  Sometimes she said she had the evening free, which allowed me to take her out to nice dinner.  Those nights were the most enjoyable to me. If we had been seen by someone who knew me, I could easily say Grace was a client.

What did Grace see in me?  Why me and not someone else?  I don’t know.  Since it was always her decision, I presume she got something from the deal.  At least, I hope she did.

On Monday, December the 22^(nd) Grace and I made rendezvous as usual.  When she left she kissed me and said ‘sweet man.’  On Tuesday the 23^(rd) when I went down to the shop Grace was not there.  A young guy working at the counter took my order.   Where is Grace today?  She is gone.  What do you mean gone?  I mean she does not work here anymore.  She gave notice a month ago.

I will call it love.  I was / am in love.  I am gutted, destroyed, kicked senseless.  No word.  No warning.  No goodbye.  No reason. It’s been over two weeks.  She has my full name and phone number from my business card.  She can find me if she wants.",8,1767828715.0,adultery,9,0.68,False

While I was working a full day on my lunch break I decided to go across the road from where I work and go get a coffee from Tim Hortons. When I got back home my parents (my dad and step mom) asked me if I went anywhere today and I said no (I knew I lied but I just went and got a coffee). They got mad at me because I didn't ask to go and I got grounded for a week from driving. I didn't know how they knew where I went and then I really started to get suspicious.
   I figured that there was a tracker or something in or on the vehicle so I just kept that in the back of my mind. 2 weeks later I get home from school and I just start kinda looking through my car to see if I can find anything. I opened my trunk for the first time and noticed that the carpet over the spare tire was not laying flat. I lifted it up to see a black circular thing with green lights on. It was a gps tracker and they never told me about it. I'm really mad but am I in the wrong?
   I pay for the gas and insurance everytime but the car is not in my name due to my states laws and insurance things.

We started playing it in 2020 and it basically was a good way to get through the pandemic and a means to still have fun together and speak to each other. Normally we aren’t even hardcore gamers, especially my wife isn’t, but somehow this game drew our attention.

Our daughter was born in March 2020. She was a good sleeper - after the first couple of months we could play almost daily. 

We failed miserably every time in the beginning and the game just seemed way too hard. But we loved the trial and error aspect. Retry, adjust, evaluate. When we finally finished our first expedition after almost 20 attempts, the payoff felt incredible.

There were periods we were playing it with the three of us and then there were periods we had a fourth squad member, usually a friend.

So yesterday we booted up GTFO for the first time in a couple of years and we attempted R1C1. We failed twice.

Today we did R1C1 and R1C2 and nailed them both on first attempt. C1 is a reactor level. Running toward the terminal with only 10 seconds left to enter the correct passcode just gets the adrenaline flowing!

Maybe we’re a little seasoned (when we started playing the game we were playing at least rundown 2, can’t remember). From the looks of it rundown 1 really is the easiest of them all.

I guess my point of posting this has to do with playing style. 

When I watch gameplay videos I see hectic, high paced gameplay. That’s NOT how we play this game, at all.

Before any big decision, fight, alarm door, anything: we discuss. We make plans, we think of the best strategy. We try to predict enemy behavior and how we should mitigate it.

We don’t run and shoot our way through expeditions. We clear rooms and we set up a back up plan (usually involving turrets) in case it all goes haywire.

This playing style allows us to have a conversation while playing, sometimes someone leaves to go to the bathroom, make some coffee or pour a glass of scotch.

It’s this aspect that makes GTFO one of my top 10 games of all time. To anyone doubting this game: play it with friends and keep trying.

Are you a person who prejudges? I myself believe that I am not, but it is difficult to be able to confirm, because we have been doing this all our lives. We assume that this is how it is, because the norm is like that.

If I write the word **MUSLIM,** this way. What do you think then? What's the first thing that pops into your head? For me, the first thing I think of is actually War. Why is that? Are Muslims warriors, soldiers and the Minions of government?

No. I know many Muslims, and they are probably just as afraid that a 3rd world war will break out again as you and me. And should the religion you rely on really define you as a human being.  I'm not religious, but I think religion is very interesting. There is so much exciting history and exciting customs that follow a culture that we have not been used to seeing before we brought it into the country in the 80s.

I choose to say that I do not judge anyone, and that everyone has the right to think and believe in exactly what they want. But the problem comes when it affects other people and cultures.

My heart aches and deep into my bones when I see tourists visiting another country and another culture and get pissed off when they don't get bernaise and thousand island dressing with their food. Or god forbid if you can't serve an Irish (you know who I mean).

We don't visit another home and ask them to go to the store and buy Friele Coffee because you don't like Evergood?? No. And you don't travel to another country or seek out another culture to taste grandis with ketchup, and entercote with bernaise and Chinese cabbage with 80s pink gold in a bottle

RESPECT. I think that's actually the key. I have no religious faith myself. But damn I respect those who believe, because it must be wonderful to be able to lean on and find hope and inspiration in something that so many others share with you. But I also have slightly different opinions about religion, which is a completely different line of thought. Because no matter how flawless something is, there is always murkiness and dishonesty if it is investigated well enough. And that applies to everything.

But that's where I get derailed. Enough about that. I believe in a lot of things. I have faith in people, good energy, and that in all people there is a small neutral cell, which is completely original, and does not believe in any religion, and is not biased or judgmental. And who have not been influenced by society to perceive what is right and wrong in a way that suits your cohort! (we use that word ) But simply open to the fact that when you meet a new individual, you just want to learn from and teach and share experiences and build trust and respect.

So back to this thing about us getting to believe and, but e and love exactly what the fuck we want. If my son (very fictitious son), had come to me and said that: Dad. I light up dirty dishcloths. Yes, well. So insanely good that you dare to say it and be open about it. Because it wasn't very many years ago that we didn't dare to say anything about sexuality that wasn't what it said in the manual for humans. I have felt it myself, and I am so happy and touched when I see how little young people today care about such things. They have a lot of other things to think about that I didn't have then, but I'm glad they don't have to worry about that one.",2,1767828361.0,DeepThoughts,0,1.0,False

sorry english is not my first language.

i spent 4-5 hours of non-stop vomit and pooping blood. 

for context my grandfather and my mom had acid reflux problems but they weren’t as severe as puking. the doctor prescribed them omeprazole along time ago. 

okay back to the story

i was very stress due to school works and i spent most of my coping with heavy meals and just food in general. two days ago i drank a questionable amount of caffeine from energy drinks and coffee for my exam. and the regular symptoms of acid going thru my mouth happened and burping but not that serious for me. earlier i ate a meal consisting of butter, 3 cups of rice, eggs and corned beef. i finished the meal within 10 mins and continued with my routine of watching vids at bed. this was not a “heavy” meal for me since it was a regular stress eating meal. then suddenly i felt the urge to puke so i got to the first round of puking and thought it was over. i brushed it off since i thought it was because of the heavy meal but then i got to a series of sessions of puking and then comes the bowel movement where i pooped blood. it was a very scary experience for me. i drank warm water in sips in hopes of making it stop but nothing worked and i just puked the water after a while. my mon then tried to let me drink omeprazole and after a few mins there is still puking of acid and liquids. my mom then gave me a liquid to rub my stomach and got better eventually and drank a few sips of water.


i cannot go to the hospital now due to financial constraints but i am willing to make a change in my lifestyle. school is starting in a few days for me. my questions consists of:

- will it happen again? i still have blood bowel movements but no puking. i am mainly concerned with puking.

- what do i need to prepare/bring to public to prevent it from happening or to ease the process if ever i got the episodes again.

- aside from eating banana, bland food and staying away from acidic food and big heavy meals, what tips should u recommend with food?

- i searched and saw that i should not take water as much for the first 12 hrs and just take sips. is that correct? what are your experiences within the first day of getting this kind of episode?

1q6vahq,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1q6vahq/the_chair_in_the_basement/,The Chair in the Basement,"# THE CHAIR IN THE BASEMENT

The first time they told me to greet an empty chair, I thought it was a joke that had gone stale years ago and nobody had the nerve to stop.

It was a Tuesday night. Basement light. Coffee that tasted like pennies. A box fan in the corner clicking on its last bearing.

I’d been in that church a long time. Long enough that the building stopped feeling like a place I visited and started feeling like a place that knew my posture.

I did the usual things. I showed up. I stacked chairs. I set out the bulletins. I fixed the microphone when it decided to hiss. I didn’t preach. I didn’t lead worship. I wasn’t that guy. I was the one who made sure the room looked like someone cared.

People like that in churches. They like predictability. They like a person who will be there even when the weather’s bad and nobody’s in a good mood.

So when Pastor Caldwell asked me to come to “clergy team,” I said yes before I even understood what he meant.

It wasn’t technically clergy. Not in the collar sense. It was the inner circle: deacons, elders, the pastor, the treasurer, one or two “ministry leads” if they were being groomed for more. People who got told things before Sunday. People who got asked to sign off on decisions.

He said it like it was a compliment.

“We want you in the room,” he told me after service one Sunday. He was smiling, the way pastors smile when they’re both sincere and managing a situation. “You’ve earned it.”

I should’ve felt proud. Part of me did. Another part of me felt that thin, mean part of yourself wake up—the part that thinks: **There’s always a catch.**

I told myself it was just anxiety. I told myself I was making it weird.

That’s what I do. I turn the simplest thing into a problem because I’m afraid of the simpler truth: that sometimes you get pulled closer to things you don’t understand, and you don’t get to decide what you become in the process.

The meeting was in the basement, not the sanctuary. The basement had those cinderblock walls that held onto every sound. The ceiling was low enough that tall men always looked a little hunched. There were taped-up posters from old youth group events still fading in the hallway like ghosts that didn’t know they were dead.

They had a circle of folding chairs, but one chair wasn’t folding.

It was a wooden chair—heavy, old, dark varnish rubbed thin on the arms. No cushion. The back was straight, like it was meant to keep your spine honest.

It sat in the circle with space around it, like everyone was giving it air.

I stopped at the door with my folder in my hand. It wasn’t a big folder. Just my notes. Things I’d written down because I didn’t want to look stupid in front of men who knew bylaws and budgets and the kind of scripture you quote to win arguments.

Elder Mark was already there. Mark had been in the church since before I moved into town. He had that stable, practical presence that makes people assume you’re right even when you’re wrong. He was pouring coffee into paper cups like it mattered.

He saw me and nodded.

“Evening.”

“Evening.”

I nodded toward the wooden chair because I didn’t know what else to do.

“What’s that about?”

Mark looked at me like he didn’t hear the question.

Then he said, very matter-of-fact, “That’s Reverend Matheson’s chair.”

I waited for the punchline.

None came.

Reverend Matheson was a name you heard in our church the way you hear a last name in a family you married into. It’s always there. It’s on plaques. It’s in the stories older people tell when they’re trying to tell you what kind of person you should be.

He’d been the pastor before Caldwell. Before the pastor before Caldwell. He’d been here during “the split” nobody liked to talk about. He’d baptized half the town. He’d buried the other half.

He’d died when I’d been coming for maybe a year. I’d seen him once, from a distance. A tall man, narrow shoulders, white hair like a rough halo, voice you could feel in your sternum. He never laughed in the pulpit. He smiled the way you might smile at a child who lied badly.

When he died, they did a memorial with flowers and hymns and a lot of language about how the Lord had called him home.

But if you listened to the older folks in the kitchen after, what you heard wasn’t “home.”

What you heard was **“still here.”**

Pastor Caldwell came in with Deacon Ruth and Deacon Shane. Ruth had a notebook full of sticky notes. Shane had his phone out like he was waiting for a text. They took seats and the circle tightened without anyone saying it.

Then Elder Jean walked in with the key ring, locked the basement door behind her, and slid the key into her pocket.

Not dramatically. Just… like that’s how it was done.

Pastor Caldwell stood for a second like he was about to pray, then didn’t. He smiled at me again, but this time it didn’t reach his eyes.

“Joe,” he said, and he said it like he wanted the room to notice. “Glad you’re here. This is good.”

“Yeah,” I said. “Happy to help.”

He nodded.

Then Elder Mark cleared his throat.

“We greet,” he said.

That was it. Two words.

Everyone looked at the chair.

Not in a goofy way. Not in a “ha-ha” way. In a way that made my skin tighten around my ribs.

Ruth spoke first. Soft voice. Practiced.

“Good evening, Reverend.”

She didn’t say the name. Just “Reverend.”

Elder Jean followed.

“Evening, Pastor.”

Shane did it, too, a half-second late like he hated it but he was going to do it anyway.

“Hey, Reverend.”

Pastor Caldwell waited. Like it mattered who did it last.

The last person was me.

I felt the room hold its breath in a way I hadn’t heard before. Like the air itself was listening.

I looked at the chair.

The varnish was chipped along one arm. There were U-shaped impressions in the wood near the front edge, like somebody had gripped it hard over and over. There was a dark spot at the top rail where a hand must have rested, thumb rubbing the same place for years.

It was just furniture. It had to be.

But my mouth went dry.

I didn’t want to do it.

Not because I was brave. Because I was embarrassed. Because I didn’t want to be the guy who said hello to a chair like a kid playing pretend.

And because underneath that—if I’m being honest—something in me didn’t want to invite anything into my life that didn’t need to be there.

Still, I did it.

I heard my own voice come out too steady.

“Good evening, Reverend.”

The room exhaled like a single animal.

Mark nodded once, like a box had been checked.

“Good,” he said. “Okay.”

Then the meeting started.

It wasn’t even about anything dramatic. Budget. Repairs. A youth retreat. Which families needed meals. Whether we were going to keep using the old hymnals or finally print new ones. Church problems. Human problems dressed up as spiritual ones.

And the whole time, that chair sat there empty.

But it never felt empty.

It felt occupied the way a doorway feels occupied when someone stands just outside it in the dark. You can’t see them, but you can feel the pressure of being watched.

I told myself I was tired. I told myself the basement made everything feel close. I told myself I was making a ghost out of a chair because I’d been invited to a room I didn’t feel like I belonged in.

I went home and didn’t think about it until I was in bed, and my mind did that thing where it replays the oddest detail like it’s trying to warn you.

The key going into Jean’s pocket.

The way Caldwell waited for me to say it.

The way the room breathed after.

The second meeting was the next week.

I almost didn’t go.

Not because I thought something supernatural was happening. Because I didn’t like the feeling of being managed by something I couldn’t name.

I told myself, *It’s a ritual. People love rituals. Churches are built out of them.* I told myself, *Just do it. Don’t be weird.*

Then Sunday happened, and Pastor Caldwell caught me by the sound booth after service.

“You coming Tuesday?” he asked.

“Yeah,” I said. “Sure.”

He put a hand on my shoulder in that pastoral way that’s supposed to feel supportive and always feels like a claim.

“Good,” he said. “We’re moving you in a little. Not just logistics. We’re going to talk about leadership.”

My stomach did a small drop.

“Okay.”

He leaned closer, like he was about to share something confidential.

“Reverend Matheson would’ve liked you,” he said.

I laughed because I didn’t know what else to do.

He didn’t laugh back.

Tuesday night, the basement smelled stronger of coffee. Somebody had brought cookies in a plastic clamshell container. The circle was set up already.

And the chair was there, exactly where it had been.

Same space around it. Same quiet respect.

I stood in the doorway again, and for a second I had the stupid thought: *What if I just turn around and leave?* Like it was that simple.

But Ruth waved me in.

“Hey, Joe,” she said. “Come sit by me.”

I sat. My folder felt heavier than it should’ve.

Jean locked the door again.

Pastor Caldwell opened with prayer this time, but it didn’t feel like prayer. It felt like a formal announcement to whatever might be listening.

When he said “amen,” Elder Mark didn’t even clear his throat. He just looked at the chair.

“We greet,” he said again.

Ruth went first.

“Good evening, Reverend.”

Jean: “Evening, Pastor.”

Shane: “Hey, Reverend.”

Caldwell: “Good evening, Reverend Matheson.”

He said the full name this time, and the hair on my arms lifted. It wasn’t the name. It was the way he said it—like he was reading it off a stone.

Then everyone looked at me.

I felt it again: the room holding its breath.

Except this time, I felt something else underneath it. Not anticipation.

Expectation.

Like a hand on the back of your neck guiding your head forward.

And something in me, stubborn and childish and tired, decided: **No.**

Not because I wanted to make a point. Because I wanted to know what happened when I didn’t play along.

I kept my eyes on my folder.

I didn’t speak.

There was a pause.

A long one.

In the silence, I heard the box fan click. I heard someone swallow. I heard the fluorescent lights buzzing like insects.

Mark said my name like a warning.

“Joe.”

I looked up.

His face wasn’t angry. It was disappointed. Like I’d dropped something important and dirty.

“You greet,” he said.

“I’m good,” I said.

It came out flat. I regretted it immediately.

Ruth’s mouth tightened.

Jean leaned forward slightly, hands clasped, like she was in a courtroom.

Pastor Caldwell’s smile showed up again like a reflex. But it was wrong.

“You’re new to the team,” he said, gentle voice. “There are practices here. They’re not arbitrary.”

“It’s a chair,” I said.

I didn’t mean to say it that way. I meant to say it light. It came out like an accusation.

Shane gave a small, sharp laugh. Not humor. Disbelief.

Ruth said, “It’s not just a chair.”

Mark’s voice went low.

“Do you think we do this because it’s cute?”

I looked around the circle. At all of them. People I’d known for years. People who’d hugged me at funerals. People who’d brought casseroles when my mom was sick. People who’d prayed over me when I looked worn out.

They were looking at me like I’d committed a sin.

My throat tightened.

“I don’t want to,” I said. “That’s all.”

Jean’s eyes stayed on me.

“You don’t want to honor him,” she said.

“That’s not what I said.”

“It’s what you’re doing,” Ruth said, and her voice had that steady Sunday-school authority. The voice that doesn’t allow you to wriggle out by changing your wording.

Pastor Caldwell leaned forward, palms open.

“Joe,” he said, “you’ve been here a long time. You know Reverend Matheson isn’t just a person. He’s—”

He stopped. Like he was choosing words.

“He’s part of the covering,” he said finally.

I stared at him.

“The covering?”

Mark nodded.

“The protection,” Mark said. “The order. The way we keep this place from becoming… something else.”

My heart was beating hard enough that I could feel it in my teeth.

Shane muttered, “Christ,” like he’d said too much.

I said, “This is insane.”

And then Jean stood up.

Her chair scraped the floor.

And the sound did something to the room. It changed it. The air tightened.

Jean walked toward me. Not fast. Not slow. Certain.

I stood up too, because my body decided it didn’t like being approached when everyone was watching.

“Sit,” Mark said.

Jean held up a hand, and Mark went quiet.

Jean stopped a foot away from me.

Her face was calm.

“Do you want to be part of this,” she said, “or not?”

“What is ‘this’?” I asked.

She didn’t answer the question.

She said, “You were invited in. That wasn’t a social invitation. That was a responsibility.”

Pastor Caldwell said, “Joe. Just greet him. Then we move on.”

My mouth felt numb.

I looked at the chair.

It sat there, silent. The wooden arms looked darker in the fluorescent light, like wet wood.

I waited for myself to feel ridiculous enough to do it.

Instead, I felt that thin, mean part again. The one that hates being pushed.

I said, “No.”

Ruth made a sound, like she’d been slapped.

Mark’s face changed. Not anger.

Fear.

Jean turned her head slightly toward the chair, like she was listening to something that hadn’t made noise.

Then she looked back at me and said, very softly, “Then you need to leave.”

Pastor Caldwell’s voice snapped a little.

“Joe—”

Jean cut him off without looking at him.

“Now,” she said.

I picked up my folder. My hands were shaking. I tried to make my movements normal. I tried to act like I was leaving a meeting because I had a stomach ache, not because I’d refused to greet a dead pastor’s chair and the room had turned on me.

I walked toward the door.

Jean stepped ahead of me and unlocked it. Her keys jingled. The sound was too loud.

Before I could open it, Mark said, “You don’t walk out like that.”

I turned.

“I’m walking out,” I said.

Ruth stood up too.

“You can’t disrespect him and then just—”

“It’s a chair,” I said again, louder.

The chair creaked.

Not loud. Not dramatic.

Just a small, dry sound, like wood shifting under weight.

Everyone froze.

Including me.

I looked at it.

Nobody was touching it. Nobody was near it.

Pastor Caldwell’s face went pale in a way I hadn’t seen from him before. His eyes flicked to me like he was terrified I’d pushed the wrong button on a machine.

Jean whispered, “Reverend.”

She wasn’t greeting him. She was apologizing.

I felt cold move over my skin in a slow sheet.

I opened the door and left.

Nobody followed me up the stairs. I didn’t hear footsteps. I didn’t hear voices.

But I felt them behind me the whole way to my car, like eyes pressed into the back of my neck.

I didn’t go back the next Sunday.

That alone should tell you how hard it hit me.

Church was the one place I went even when I didn’t want to go anywhere. It was habit. Structure. The kind of community you can lean on without admitting you’re leaning.

I told myself I was taking a week.

Monday, Ruth texted me.

>

I didn’t respond.

Tuesday, Pastor Caldwell called.

I let it ring.

Wednesday, Jean showed up at my house.

I saw her through the front window. Winter coat. Gloves. Standing on my porch like she belonged there.

I didn’t open the door.

She knocked once, then twice.

“Joe,” she called through the glass. Not shouting. Just firm. “We’re not going to do this.”

I stayed still.

She said, “You need to greet him.”

My stomach flipped.

She waited, then said, “We can do it right here. That’s fine.”

I felt my mouth go dry.

Then, from somewhere behind me in the house, I heard a chair creak.

I didn’t own a creaky chair. I didn’t own anything heavy enough to make that sound.

I turned my head slowly.

My dining room was visible from the hallway.

One of the dining chairs—one of the plain, cheap ones—had been pulled out from the table and turned to face the hall.

It wasn’t tipped. It wasn’t fallen. It was placed.

Facing me.

Waiting.

Jean’s voice came again, closer now, because she’d moved to the side window.

“I can see you,” she said. “I’m not leaving until you do it.”

My throat tightened so hard it hurt.

I backed up a step, eyes locked on the dining chair.

The chair didn’t move.

But the feeling in the house changed. Like the temperature dropped one degree at a time, quietly, politely.

I said, to nobody, “This is insane.”

Jean said, “It’s not insane. It’s how it is.”

I looked at my phone. I had messages. Missed calls. People I’d known for years suddenly acting like I was a threat, like I’d broken a seal.

I don’t know what made me do it.

I don’t know if it was fear or exhaustion or some leftover part of me that still wanted to belong.

I stood in my hallway, staring at a chair that was not mine anymore, and I said, in a voice that sounded like mine but didn’t feel like it came from me:

“Good evening, Reverend.”

The relief was immediate.

Not mine.

The house exhaled.

The pressure eased, like a hand letting go of my throat.

Outside, through the glass, Jean nodded once and stepped back from the porch like she’d completed a task.

She didn’t look happy.

She looked resigned.

She mouthed something I couldn’t hear.

Then she walked away.

I stood there a long time, staring at the chair.

My hands were shaking. My eyes were burning.

I wanted to be angry. I wanted to be rational. I wanted to call someone and say, *Listen to what’s happening to me.*

Instead, I did what I always do when I’m trying not to fall apart.

I cleaned.

I pushed the chair back in.

I checked the locks. Twice.

I made coffee I didn’t drink.

And by the time the sun went down, I’d convinced myself I’d imagined most of it.

I slept badly.

In the night, I dreamed of the basement.

Not the circle. Not the coffee. Not the people.

Just the chair.

And the feeling of someone sitting in it, patient and upright, waiting for me to remember my place.

The next Sunday, I went back.

Of course I did.

That’s the humiliating part. I didn’t run. I didn’t call the police. I didn’t blow up anyone’s life with accusations.

I put on a clean shirt and drove to church like a man who’d had a weird week and was ready to move on.

Pastor Caldwell met me at the door.

He clasped my hand with both of his.

“Glad you’re here,” he said.

He looked genuinely relieved. Like my return had stabilized something.

“I’m sorry,” I said, because I didn’t know what else to say.

He squeezed my hand.

“It’s alright,” he said. “It’s alright. We just have to keep order.”

After service, he asked me to stay.

“We’re meeting Tuesday,” he said. “Same time.”

I nodded.

He lowered his voice.

“We’re going to make it official,” he said. “We’re going to bring you into the team properly.”

I felt my stomach drop again.

“Okay,” I said.

“Good,” he said. “Reverend would want it done right.”

Tuesday came.

Basement again.

Circle again.

Jean locked the door again.

The chair was there.

But this time, there was something on it: a folded cloth, like a stole, laid over the back. Dark fabric. Smelled faintly of old cedar and aftershave.

Mark motioned me to sit closer to the wooden chair than I had before.

“Here,” he said.

I sat.

The wood felt colder in my peripheral vision. Like it was drawing heat.

Pastor Caldwell cleared his throat.

“We’re going to welcome Joe,” he said, “into the inner circle of leadership. Into the covering.”

Ruth smiled at me like a proud aunt.

Shane wouldn’t look at me.

Jean looked at the chair.

“We greet,” Mark said.

And they did.

All of them, in order, like a litany. Like a lock being turned.

“Good evening, Reverend.”

“Evening, Pastor.”

“Good evening, Reverend Matheson.”

Then they looked at me.

My mouth went dry.

I heard, very clearly, the memory of the dining chair creaking in my hallway.

I said, “Good evening, Reverend.”

The chair creaked again.

Closer this time.

Like it answered.

Pastor Caldwell said, “Amen,” under his breath, like this was the part that mattered.

Then he stood and walked behind the wooden chair.

He picked up the dark cloth and held it out toward me.

“Come,” he said.

I didn’t move.

He didn’t raise his voice. He didn’t have to.

“Joe,” he said, “you’re not just attending anymore. You’re carrying.”

“Carrying what,” I asked, and my voice sounded too small in the cinderblock room.

Mark said, “Him.”

Ruth said, “Us.”

Jean said nothing.

Pastor Caldwell stepped closer and draped the cloth over my shoulders.

It was heavier than fabric should be.

It felt like a hand.

His fingers brushed the back of my neck and I flinched.

He leaned in and spoke near my ear, so only I could hear.

“You don’t get to be in this room unless you can greet him without fear,” he said. “That’s the test. That’s why he watches.”

I swallowed.

“He’s dead,” I whispered.

Pastor Caldwell’s voice stayed gentle.

“Not the way you mean,” he said.

Then he backed away and addressed the room.

“We’re going to do the formal welcome,” he said. “And then Reverend will have his turn.”

My stomach twisted.

“His turn?” I said, louder than I meant to.

Ruth’s smile didn’t move, but her eyes sharpened.

Mark said, “Quiet.”

Jean’s head tilted slightly toward the chair again, like she was listening to a voice at the edge of hearing.

Pastor Caldwell said, “Joe,” and he said it like he was giving me one last chance to be easy. “Just sit. Just let it happen.”

I looked at the chair.

It sat empty.

It sat patient.

And for the first time, I understood what they meant by “covering.”

It wasn’t protection.

It was ownership.

The chair creaked.

Slow.

Deliberate.

Like someone shifting their weight, preparing to stand.

Every part of me wanted to run. To kick the door. To shove past Jean. To leave the whole building behind and never look back.

And then I felt it.

Not a hand. Not a voice.

A certainty settling into me like a coin dropping into a slot.

**Say hello.**

Not as a greeting.

As obedience.

I stood up without deciding to.

The cloth slid on my shoulders like it had found its place.

Pastor Caldwell watched me like he’d been waiting for this moment his whole life.

I took one step toward the chair.

Then another.

The wood smelled stronger now. Cedar and old sweat and something sharp, like disinfectant.

I stopped in front of it.

The circle watched me.

And in the silence, I heard my own voice again, coming out steady, the way it had the first time.

Except this time it didn’t feel like my voice doing me a favor.

It felt like my mouth was a tool.

“Good evening,” I said.

I tried to add “Reverend.” I did.

But the name that came out wasn’t the one they’d taught me.

It was my name.

Full.

Clean.

Spoken like it was being read off a form.

“Good evening, Joe,” the voice said from my throat.

The room exhaled.

Not with relief.

With reverence.

Pastor Caldwell smiled.

Ruth’s eyes filled with tears.

Jean bowed her head.

Mark whispered, “Thank you,” like he’d been starving.

And I stood there, upright and cold, feeling the inside of myself step back, like a man making space in his own house for an old guest who never learned to leave.

I don’t remember sitting down again.

I don’t remember how the meeting ended.

I remember the last thing Pastor Caldwell said as everyone filed out, soft and satisfied, like this was the right ending to a long story.

“Welcome,” he said. “Now you’ll always be in the room.”

When I got home, my dining chair was turned toward the hallway again.

But this time it wasn’t waiting for me.

It was waiting for someone else.

And when my phone rang—unknown number, late-night—I answered without thinking.

I didn’t say hello.

I didn’t say my name.

I just listened.

On the other end, there was a small, dry creak, like wood under weight.

Then a voice—mine, but older—said, very gently:

“Put him on.”",1,1767828319.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

I couldn’t be here! This was the one place in the whole town I never wanted to go again. The whisper I had heard at the coffee shop returned with full force, seeming louder now in the frigid air with a dampening blanket of falling snow: 

*“In the attic of the main office inside the factory, behind a false panel sixteen steps in and four steps to the left—-”*

No, no, no, no! I shouted the last word out loud but it seemed to fall flat, frozen midair. Not an echo reached the distant mountains looming over the town. 

I whipped around and got back into my car, fumbling with the keys as the cold bit into my hands. The engine sputtered but didn’t turn over, I tried again, nothing but a wheezing cough and then more silence. 

This car was new, bought in the fall. There was no way this was happening unless…

Gemma’s cracking, death-knell voice all but rang in my ears:

*“You’ve always been a good boy, a reliable boy. I need you to take on an important role in the family.”* 

“I don’t want anything to do with it!” I shouted, leaping from the car and kicking the snow around me savagely with nothing else upon which to spend my impotent rage.

No echo again, it was like I had somehow parked my car in a different dimension, but I could see the headlights of other cars down on the highway below the hill upon which the factory stood. Time and space seemed to be moving as they should. Only sound now worked strangely in this place. 

Whispers of a dead woman became a shout in my ears and my own shouts fell dead into the snow. 

I panted for a moment, trying to collect myself. It was getting colder, and if my car wouldn’t start the only way I could avoid freezing became obvious: I had to enter the factory. 

Nothing else occurred to me, even going down the hill to the road and trying to hitch a ride home seemed an impossible task. I would be frozen to death before I reached the road, of that I was somehow assured. 

I stumbled up to the employee entrance, it would be locked of course but maybe Felicity was working late tonight (not an uncommon occurrence) and would hear me. I banged on the heavy metal door.

“Felicity? Hello? Is there anyone there? It’s Edward!” Once again my voice floated muffled into the air and was choked out not ten feet from me. After a few minutes of slowly gathering snow on my head and shoulders I could bear it no longer. I reached out and tried the handle. 

Unlocked—It opened easily. 

I winced, expectant of the blaring of the alarm system I had once tripped as a child, my mother had given me such a stern reprimand after that incident I still teared up remembering it.

The alarm didn’t sound. Then was Felicity really here? No, she always turned it on when she was working late. Even though we didn’t have a lot of crime in our town, people went missing a lot more often than you’d think. 

I looked around the dark expanse. This was one of the largest single buildings in town and while the outside maintained the essential brick-and-mortar look necessary to retain the rural charm of the place, the inside was entirely modern. We had infrared cameras installed a while back so no night lights were needed. I knew I’d get another stern talking-to from mother when I showed up on the security footage, but I didn’t care. Inside wasn’t exactly toasty but it was warmer than outside. I closed the door and made sure it was bolted. I wouldn’t be getting spirited away tonight, at least not through *that* door. 

The only lights I could see were the emergency exit signs in the distance above other doors. One caught my eye, no more like caught my *attention*. If I wanted to thaw my chilled bones I would have to go up there to warm up. Felicity kept a space heater in her office for those early winter mornings where she was the first one into work. 

*The office*…

Yeah, I was just going there for the heater, nothing else. 

I made my way to the glowing beacon of the large *EXIT* sign. I knew it was the offices because it was the only one that was floating in the dark about 2 stories above the factory floor. I found the familiar metal stairs and began to walk up them, my movements stiff as if I was already half frozen. 

I got to the door and stopped my hand halfway to the knob. Surely *this* alarm would be working right? I turned the knob and went in—nothing, total silence, even the hinges swung silently inward and the door came to rest without a sound not even hitting the old door stopper like it usually did.

What was going on? 

I stepped gingerly into the office. I clearly hadn’t been here in a while. The place had undergone an update and looked almost totally different. A panel for central heating and air glowed slightly on the wall over one of the water coolers. It must have motion detection. That’s when I thought about the cameras. I looked up to the corners but all of their red lights were dark. Stranger still, the main power was clearly still on to the office but the cameras had stopped their ceaseless vigil. 

I went over to the new control panel for the heat and adjusted some settings. I cursed, no matter what settings I put it on or how long I waited the air that began blowing was cold, freezing even, as if it was being pumped directly from outside. 

I began to shiver uncontrollably, I was going to die. They would find my body frozen, probably naked (hypothermia and all that), right here in the office with the heater blasting. 

There were heavy blankets in the attic. 

The memory slapped me across the face. Before the wiring had been updated twenty years ago the office used to lose power often and thus they kept heavy blankets in the attic to keep from freezing while they worked under the lashing words of my hard-fisted grandfather before his death. 

I was halfway to the storeroom where the attic stairs could be accessed when I stopped dead. Gemma’s words almost burst my eardrums this time as they repeated again clanging in my brain like church bells, or funeral bells more likely. 

I stood there shivering. My fingers and toes numbed and pain started to prick as the nerves panicked at the loss of feeling. I had to get those blankets. 

I all but ripped open the door to the storeroom. The thought that it should have been locked didn’t even cross my semi-delirious mind. I yanked hard on the cord to drop the ladder to the attic and awkwardly clambered up and there, oh there they were heaped under piles of dust. I grabbed one and wrapped myself in it expecting after a minute or two to begin to feel the warmth of the heavy wool seep into my bones. 

“What the hell?” I groaned. It came out a lot more stammering as my shivering had doubled. The blanket felt like it had been soaked in freezing water. I threw it off in disgust and fear began to sharpen my cold-dulled senses. 

Matches! There were matches and an old gas lamp in the corner. I remember seeing them while helping my mother move some things out of the attic a few years ago. I scrambled towards the back of the room, dust kicking up from my shifting movements. I was crawling now, my legs too stiff for me to stand. 

I found the lamp and matches and though I barely had control over my hands at this point and tried to strike a match. It struck and I almost wept with joy. I carefully lit the lamp and in its light and bare warmth I felt hope begin to rise again. 

Then I looked to my left.

About four steps from me was a loose panel in the fabricated wall of the attic. I froze, mind and body. The oil lamp now seemed to radiate heat and I began to sweat under my arms and soon my back was drenched but my blood had frozen solid. I was a statue of heat and cold that would have killed a normal person, but I remained alive in torment. 

One thought reigned supreme in my mind. If I just opened that panel and looked inside, all of this pain, the biting cold and the broiling heat, would end. I don’t know how long I sat there in agony but eternity could have passed and I would not have known it, the walls could have crumbled away into some hell-scape wasteland outside and it still would be me and that damned panel to my left in a perpetual standoff. 

I had to give in didn’t I? What choice did I really have? What human could have endured that purgatory for any longer than I did? 

Perhaps I’m trying to justify myself to the wrong people, maybe some of you could have endured, even beaten back whatever supernatural influence that held the factory in sway that night. Maybe I am the only weak one…

I caved. As soon as my intention became clear the spell ended and the heat and cold vanished though I scarcely noticed. Imagining what lay behind that panel existed as the only clear thought in my head. But I didn’t have to imagine, did I? Gemma had told me exactly what I would find. 

There it was, an old leather chest bound in unrusted iron. Its weight surprised me but I took it on my lap and began to look it over. The old, red leather showed cracks of age but the iron bound it together in chains unbroken that held the softer material in place. 

The iron bands showed some kind of embossing; an emblem of some kind of worm depicted burrowing into the brackets in an ouroboros that spanned the fastenings. After running my finger along the embossing I found a part of the metal that had been stained by decades, maybe centuries of natural human oils. 

I pressed it gently and a small spike popped out from the front of the lid where a keyhole would usually rest. Once again Gemma’s prediction rang true. I knew exactly how to open this chest. 

I hardly flinched as I pressed my thumb onto the spike and expected blood to start dripping onto my pants, but no, the spike drank it up like dry ground when it finally rained. A metallic scent filled the air and the chest opened with a hiss of escaping air, though it sounded more like a satisfied sigh from a thirsty throat finally given a drink.

I opened the chest and took out its contents. A larger book wrapped in oilskin to protect it from rot. I undid the rawhide ties and the oilskin fell away. I now held a large book, red leather like the chest, but it seemed like it had been stained instead of dyed. Stained by centuries of Lockheart hands, and I was sure, Lockheart blood. 

The cover of the book had only a simple illustration of a circular mouth filled with teeth repeated in a plane across the cover in various sizes. The title covered the whole top of the tome:

*The Maw of Azurmazabul*

So I made [**SpotBoard** ](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/spotboard/dnjleheimdlmdfajlciheclfbhmafiai)– a Chrome extension that lets the user to capture just the sections they care about from those sites (like Visualping if you have ever used that) and put them all on one dashboard. Or as a startpage, if you don't mind something less visual with your morning coffee!​

Now I open Chrome → one‑click refresh → scan everything at a glance → click through if needed. No more tab clutter, no more navigation fatigue. It’s locally stored with cloud sync following your Chrome profile. Note it doesnt work well on infinite scroll websites as your socials.. So you will need to head to Facebook etc. still 😄

**Does this resonate?**  
Have you had the same frustration with your morning tab routine? Would something like this save you time/energy?  
Please try it out and let me know if you found it useful?  
Would appreciate any feedback to make it better!

1q6uzpe,https://www.reddit.com/r/HumanResourcesUK/comments/1q6uzpe/colleague_with_bad_hygiene/,Colleague with bad hygiene.,"Hello,

I have a colleague with really bad hygiene.

Basically any room hes in you can tell from the smell which lingers for hours once hes left.

He leaves desks and chairs in a very poor condition. (Coffee stains, large skin chunks, hair and occasional fingernails). Which he never cleans up when alcohol wipes and cleaning facilities are available and encouraged to be used.

We have shared work spaces and I have emails trailing back 2/3 years trying to address this informally to my manager.

Every time I complain I am assured that this person has protected characteristics, ongoing health problems and this  issue is being managed. 

Nothing has ever changed and ive never witnessed an improvement or effort to clean up from this person.

I am considering submitting a formal grievance with photograph evidence of mess and email chains about this, provided i do, what should I expect for an outcome?

Another thing to bare in mind is i think this person has recently recieved a final written warning for sexual harassment. 

Im worried ill just hear more of the same ""its being managed"" when its clearly isn't whilst making a name for myself as a complainer.

I appreciate people can have health conditions but I shouldn't have to suffer as a result. It does cause me massive amounts of stress. I dread working with him and its starting to effect my life outside of work.",3,1767827608.0,HumanResourcesUK,2,1.0,False

Mike sprang awake the next day. He couldn't wait to see Will again. His best friend had been rescued from the upside down only yesterday and he still had so many things to heal from. 
Mike could see it in him when he woke up. Will was alive but he was changed. There seemed to be a new shadow in his eyes. An eternal sorrow that he couldn't dispell. 

Mike frowned at the memory. What did that monster do to you? He wondered solemnly, remembering it's terrible open face and hundreds of tiny teeth. He remembered seeing the soldiers collapse beneath it's crushing weight, claws tearing at their still living flesh. Then the chase. The heart stopping dash into the classroom where they had tried desperately to escape. 

His heart squeezed painfully as he recounted El. How she had protected them till the very end. She deserved a normal life more than any of them and yet she had given up all of it just to keep him and his friends safe. 

He had covered his ears to shield them from the dying monster's shriek, squinting in fear and shock, knowing what was to come. His brand new friend was already so weakened and tired, this much exertion was going to kill her. There was no way around it.
At last the room had gone quiet. The scorched blackboard the only visible memory of the girl who had stood there minutes before. 

He opened his eyes quickly to block out the trauma. No don't think about it. He told himself firmly. You got what you wanted. The only reason you kept her around in the first place. Was to find Will. He nodded at the realization. 

Besides, the last thing he had done to El was kiss her. He burned with shame. It was his first kiss. Even Lucas could see his crush from a mile away so it only made sense to try it out on her. El was his crush, you're supposed to kiss your crush. He just didn't know what El had felt when he had done that. 

El was a lab experiment. She didn't even know what love was. He had probably made her feel so uncomfortable or confused. Just moments before, she had been fine calling him her brother. 

Why had he focused on something so dumb as a first kiss? He had been so worried about Will, so hopeful that he would be found. That he would see him again. But then he could see that Numbness on El. That fear so raw that she almost seemed to be somewhere else entirely. And he hated to see any of his friends suffer. 

Mike wheeler was a sensitive boy and no matter how hard he tried to hide it, he cared. He cared deeply for the people in his life and despite only knowing El for a few days he had already felt a soft protectiveness towards the frightened girl.

After throwing on a shirt and pants he looked in the mirror. ""How do I look?"" He asked his ruffled reflection. Uh fine. A voice in his head answered back. It's just Will. Who cares how you look. He knew it was just Will. His best friend. But despite that he couldn't help it. He did care. Why do I always have to care? 

He went to the bathroom and did the unthinkable. He brushed his teeth. What is wrong with me? He thought incredulously. Mike never cared to brush his teeth unless his annoying sister or parents were nagging at him.
Maybe getting Will back had given him a new outlook on life. A new appreciation for the things he had. Or. He rolled his eyes, spitting in the sink. Im just a weirdo who's been traumatized. 

He laughed at the sheer ridiculousness of it all and walked downstairs. His mom had made waffles. ""Micheal sit down for breakfast."" His mom smiled.
Mike glanced at the door, itching to leave. His mom noticed the action and sighed. ""Maybe you can bring some to him when you go."" She offered sweetly. 

""He just woke up from a coma mom."" Mike scoffed. ""Do you really think he can eat waffles?"" He pointed out sharply. ""Excuse me?"" His mom looked taken aback and Mike felt his ears burn. ""Sorry."" For whatever reason he was feeling less firey today so he surrendered and sat down at the table. 

""I know you're worried about your friend Micheal but you can't forget to take care of yourself. "" she stated firmly. His father walked into the room. ""This all seems unnecessary. He's a young man, he'll be fine. Why so much fuss?"" He grumbled, getting a cup of coffee from the counter, most likely prepared by his wife.

Micheal chewed angrily at the comment. ""Will was missing dad! He was in real danger!"" He pushed the barely eaten waffles away from him and stood up. ""I care about Will! Even if you don't. "" he shot at him. His father's brows just furrowed. ""He's not a little girl son. He doesn't need you to be all protective of him. If you ask me, that kid needs to toughen up. A few nights out in the woods was probably good for him."" He insisted.

Mike's mouth dropped open. ""You did not just say that!"" He spluttered, looking to his mom for support. ""He did not just say that! That is so uncool!"" 
His mother straightened up. ""Ted that is not helping."" She sounded strained like she was holding something back. 
Ted didn't say anything but Mike thought he heard him mumble something like the word. Sissy

Slamming the door behind him, Mike bit back a stinging response. His dad didn't get it. He didn't know Will like he did. Will wasn't a little girl. But he was scared. He had been so scared and Mike had been helpless to comfort him. So that's what he was going to do. He was determined to be there for him whenever he could.

Mounting his bike, he peddled fiercely, towards the hospital.

We live in two different parts of the country now so I never really thought anything would come of it. I did think he was really cute back when we were in college and if I had been single then, I would've totally asked him out. It's been over 3 years since we've graduated and I met him once last year for a coffee when he was in my city for a conference - I thought he was still just as sweet and cute. During that chat he mentioned my ex-boyfriend and I told him that I actually had broken up with him since then. I noticed that since that meeting, he would reply to my insta stories a lot more frequently. I was talking to him recently and he told me that he's planning a trip later this year to another country and asked me if I wanted to join him. I told him I would be down once I had a better idea my plans for that time.

Am I reading too much into this or does it seem like he might be interested in me as more than just friends?

Last month I went to the grand opening of Rich Port Coffee's second location in the Historic South Norfolk section of Chesapeake.

Overall it was really nice vibes and they're going to be a great addition to the community! 

I got a hot cafe con leche with caramel and white chocolate.

I would say it's mid-sized and in addition to the main dining area/lobby, there's a separate chill section that has lots of natural sunlight.

The owners were really nice and everyone was hospitable and I pray they have much success and impact at this new location!

Hey there. I’m a 32 year old guy from Michigan who’s definitely more on the introverted side, but once I’m comfortable I’m pretty laid back and sarcastic. I’m better one on one than in big groups and I prefer real conversations over small talk.

I work a job with weird hours, so my schedule is a little all over the place, but that also means I’m around to chat at random times. In the warmer months I love being outdoors hiking, kayaking, camping, anything like that. In winter I’m more of a homebody. Reading, binging shows, good coffee, and quiet nights are my thing.

I’m not looking for anything intense or forced. Just chill conversation, getting to know someone, sharing thoughts, laughs, random topics, or even comfortable silence. Friends are great, and if it turns into a longer term chat connection, even better.

If you’re introverted, over small talk, and just want someone easy to talk to, feel free to reach out.",1,1767827403.0,IntrovertsChat,6,1.0,False

I’m the only coffee drinker in my house and have 2-3 cups throughout the day. So, an on-demand bean-to-cup solution has been wonderful. I wouldn’t mind buying another Philips but don’t necessarily need to.

 

What should I replace it with?

 

• My preferred drink: coffee with milk (poured in cold post-brew, I like to vary the amount and not worried about temp - I use am Ember mug).

• My budget: stay under \~$1500

• No need for milk-added drinks but would like coffee & espresso options

• I use medium roast beans, no flavored beans (don’t need to swap out beans or use grounds)

• I’m fine with whatever level of preventative mx

• I got my dad a De’Longhi TrueBrew and I don’t really like the coffee it brews but haven’t tried to dial it in much
