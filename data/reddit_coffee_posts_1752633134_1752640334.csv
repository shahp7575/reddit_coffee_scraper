I'm in the early stages of a documentary project about Portland's cable access television scene during the 1980s and 90s and ***I need your help***!

**Some context about the project:**

* I'm exploring how cable access TV during this time period reflected Portland's unique culture and provided space for creative expression.
* I'm currently looking at shows like Jim Spagg, The Chess Show, Insanity, Where's the Art, but interested in ALL cable access programming from this period.
* Currently investigating themes of free expression, censorship challenges, how marginalized communities used this platform, and the preservation efforts happening today
* I'm interested in documenting the history and legacy of community media in PDX

**I'm hoping to connect with:**

* People who created or worked on cable access shows
* Viewers who regularly watched or called in
* Staff who worked at the stations/facilities
* Anyone with archives, recordings, or memorabilia
* Those who remember how cable access impacted Portland's communities

**If you or someone you know was part of this scene, I'd love to hear:**

* What shows do you remember watching or creating?
* Any memorable moments, episodes, or personalities?
* How did cable access reflect Portland's culture at that time?
* Do you have any recordings, photos, or materials from that era?
* How did your experience with cable access impact you?

This is a passion project aimed at preserving this unique piece of Portland's media history before memories and materials are lost to time. I'm particularly interested in how cable access television provided a platform for voices and perspectives that weren't represented in mainstream media.

Finally installed the LED light to replace the map light. It ended up being a little too small, but nothing a coffee shop rewards card can't cover up. Super bright white and red LEDs. Love it, and it was way cheaper that the ""correct"" one.

The truck light sucked and again, this light was super cheap. The angle shines a lot behind the car too, and consequently in my face, but it's not too bad or I will lower the truck lid some.

Overall super happy with the results!

Over coffee (virtual, of course), she spilled the beans on her journey, and spoiler: It wasn't just the code; it was the docs that turned users into evangelists.

Sarah's early versions had solid features, but onboarding was a nightmare – think scattered notes and vague comments. She fixed it step-by-step: Began with a comprehensive overview doc outlining architecture and use cases. Added code examples with real-world scenarios, like integrating with CI/CD pipelines. For the win, she included migration guides for users switching from competitors, complete with diffs and benchmarks. This slashed support queries by 80% and boosted referrals, as happy users shared her docs in their teams.

Hitting $15k MRR felt surreal, she said, but consistent doc updates kept the product sticky amid competition. Devs and PMs grinding on similar paths, CodeCraft is a game-changer – it turns project ideas into pro docs automatically via 6 steps. Give it a spin: https://CodeCraftai.dev Complement it with GitHub's own wiki features for that extra collab edge without risking removal.

""Three years ago, you took Lyra as your Luna just to get her to forgive Mira.” 
“I've watched Lyra fall deeper for you every day, but you're still lying to her—passing off birth control pills as antidepressants. Aren’t you afraid she will lose it once she finds out the truth?"" 
Tristan paused, bitter smile curved his lips. 
""A pup I don't want doesn't need to exist. As for Lyra... as long as she stops interfering with Mira's happiness, I'll honor my commitment to protect her for life."" 
No one knew that I had long since learned Italian and understood every word they said. 
I stood in the living room, his fresh bite mark still throbbing on my neck, holding the bottle of my 'antidepressants.'
So all the love he showed me… was only a lie. 
What I thought was my salvation had been nothing but a crafted trap. 
Fine. If that’s the truth—I'd give them all exactly what they wanted. I’m done playing the fool.

""Good morning."" I wrapped my fingers around my coffee mug, glancing at my mate across the breakfast table. 

Ronan Cross sat there studying me in nothing but a thin nightgown, his amber eyes still blazing with that primal hunger from full moon.

""Morning."" I set down my cup, reminding him, ""Don't you have that pack meeting today?""

""Yeah."" Ronan smirked, pushing back from his chair and stalking over to me. ""The boys can wait for their Luna. Besides, we're working on the pack's heir.""

Before I could say anything, his mouth crashed against mine, tongue demanding entry as his fingers slipped beneath my panties.

My knees went weak as I breathed against his lips, ""Ronan...""

He cleared the table with one sweep of his arm, plates crashing to the floor. Then freed his co//ck, the tip already slick as he positioned himself between my spread legs.

I wrapped my legs around his waist, meeting each of his powerful thrusts as he pounded into me. 

After thirty minutes, Ronan buried himself deep and came hard inside me.

He kissed me lazily, then gave my butt a firm squeeze. ""Meeting shouldn't take long. I'll bring the guys back for dinner ."" His voice softened slightly: ""And babe? Don’t forget your antidepressants.""

I rolled my eyes, tugging my nightgown back down. ""Such a nag.""

He flashed those sharp canines in a grin before heading out to the pack house. I stayed slumped against the table, legs still trembling, but smiling despite myself.

I prepared a small gathering for him and Rowan, his beta.

Later that night, when his beta arrived, I went to change my clothes—only to overhear their conversation.

At the dinner table, Tristan’s beta suddenly switched to Italian.

""Three years ago, you took Lyra as your Luna just to get her to forgive Mira. I've watched Lyra fall deeper for you every day, but you're still lying to her—passing off birth control pills as antidepressants. Aren’t you afraid she will lose it once she finds out the truth?""

Tristan paused, his face clouded with a complex expression before a wry, bitter smile curved his lips. ""A pup I don't want doesn't need to exist. As for Lyra... as long as she stops interfering with Mira's happiness, I'll honor my commitment to protect her for life.""

No one knew that I had long since learned Italian and understood every word they said.

I stood in the living room, his fresh bite mark still throbbing on my neck, holding the bottle of my 'antidepressants.'

So all the love he showed me… was only a lie.

What I thought was my salvation had been nothing but a crafted trap.

I didn't hesitate. I swallowed the pills—they tasted more bitter than ever before.

The conversation at the dinner table continued, Rowan's voice low and heavy with guilt

“Forget the whole pup situation for a second—three years ago, when Mira jumped into that river, Lyra’s mom dove in to save her. But Mira shoved her under and let her drown. Ronan, come on, the footage was clear as day. She did it on purpose. Lyra had every right to take it to the pack court.”

""But you became Lyra's legal guardian just to keep Mira out of prison. You signed that settlement behind Lyra's back. Sure, Mira walked free, but Lyra's been drowning in depression ever since. She blames herself every single day. If she ever learns the truth, it'll destroy her completely.""

Ronan's eyes flashed with irritation, but his voice stayed cold and firm. ""Mira didn't mean it. She was drowning—those movements were just instinct. She regrets it too.""

""I've hidden those documents well. Lyra will never know the truth. I'll be good to her, spend my life making it up to her, give her a home. She'll forget the pain. She'll heal.""

Rowan sighed. “Look, don’t blow up—I just feel bad for Lyra, that’s all. You showed up when she was at rock bottom, and of course she fell for you. But you were never over Mira.”

“Whatever, man. Just... hope you can live with this secret. And I hope you won't regret it.”

Ronan drained his glass, each word deliberate: ""I will never regret it.""

That one sentence—“I will never regret it”—tore apart the last of my illusions like sharp claws.

Tomorrow was New Year's Eve. The streets buzzed with celebration.

Just this morning, Ronan had fu//cked me senseless, his teeth at my throat, saying how much he loved me.

Now every word felt like a blade cutting me open.

I collapsed on a park bench, tears streaming down my face.

All those buried memories came flooding back.

Mira loved my ex mate Evan desperately. The day he and I got engaged, she couldn't handle it—left a suicide note and jumped into the river.

Even though Mira was a strong swimmer and my father's illegitimate daughter, my mother still dove in to save her.

So many people filmed it. I watched my mother lift Mira toward the surface, only for Mira to press down on her shoulders, use her feet to push my mother's head underwater.

That's how my mother drowned.

When I arrived, Mira cried pitifully: ""I just lost my head for a moment, sis. Please don't blame me. When mom saved me, she must have wanted me to live well...""

I broke down, demanding to know why she'd pushed my mother underwater when she could swim perfectly well. She just kept crying, insisting it wasn't intentional.

I sued her for murder.

But the next day, there was a knock at my door.

I opened it, eyes red, barely dry from crying.

“Evan ?” I asked, caught off guard by his sudden visit. “Are you here for my mother’s funeral?”

He stood outside, cold and distant, his voice like a blade:

“No,” he said, standing at the threshold. “Listen carefully. I, Evan Locke, Alpha of the Locke Pack, reject you, Lyra Hale, to be my mate and future Luna.”

“What?” I froze, struck as if by lightning, unable to move. “What are you doing?”

“Accept it.” He ignored my question, “Take my rejection.”

Evan’s voice was cold, without a trace of hesitation or mercy. The eyes that once gazed at me so tenderly were now colder than Arctic snow.

“NOW.”

A chill swept over me. Suppressed by his Alpha bloodline, I could only obey. “I accept your rejection.”

The moment the mate bond snapped, my wolf let out a sorrowful howl—as if her soul had been torn apart.

I thought my tears had long dried up, yet they slid down silently once more.

“Why?” My voice came out hoarse.

Evan lowered his eyes, his tone still as cold and cutting as ice: “I won’t allow you to harm Mira.”

That single sentence sent me plummeting into the abyss.

He didn’t just break off our engagement. Before the eyes of the entire pack, he sealed the mate bond with Mira. That day, the whole pack celebrated their union, while I was cast out, becoming the laughingstock of the pack.

Then the pack erupted with rumors—that I was using my mother's death for sympathy, for attention, for power.

They called me jealous, said that's why my mate rejected me.

The pressure nearly suffocated me. I had a complete breakdown and developed severe depression.

But I never gave up seeking justice for my mother.

My mother cared for me, protected me for twenty-three years. How could I abandon her?

That's when Ronan began his relentless pursuit.

Such careful attention, such devoted protection.

I saw him as my salvation and accepted his claim.

After our mating ceremony, the court found Mira innocent.

So I tried to let go, I wanted his pup. I just... wanted us to feel like a real family.”

I never imagined that my salvation was just proof of his love for Mira all along.

Ronan appeared beside me, holding an umbrella over my head.

The moment he saw me, his furrowed brow relaxed slightly, concern flashing in his eyes.

""You disappeared without a word. I was worried sick.""

""And it's getting colder every day. I'm buried in pack business with year-end territory disputes—if you get sick, how am I supposed to take care of you?""

I wasn't surprised he'd found me. He'd installed a tracking app on my phone.

He said he was afraid my depression would make me do something dangerous. He wanted to protect me.

I'd believed him.

But now I knew better. He was probably just making sure I wouldn't go after Mira.

I blinked, my tears already dried up, staring at the snowflakes falling from the sky.

""Old wolves say the Moon Goddess listens closer during the first snow. That's why I came out here.""

First wish: to sever my mate bond with Ronan cleanly.

Second wish: never having to see him again after I left the pack.

Third wish: for mom not to hate me.

Not to hate me for falling in love with the man who protected her killer. For wanting to have his pup.

Ronan draped his jacket over my shoulders, playfully tapping my nose. ""Then you should dress warmer. Look at your hands—they're freezing.""

""What did you pray for?""

I watched him put on his caring act, feeling nothing.

""About us. And about mom.""

Ronan's face went rigid. He studied me carefully.

""Mira is your half-sister, after all. Blood is thicker than water. She was devastated when your mom died too. You're each other's only family. It's been three years now, maybe...""

I knew what he was getting at. ""I know. I won't cause trouble anymore.""

I'd already sued her. Mira wasn't convicted.

I didn't appeal then.

Even if I withdrew the family's forgiveness letter now, it wouldn't change anything.

Ronan relaxed, relief flickering across his face. His mood clearly improved.

""Baby, I'm so glad you can let this go.""

""New year, new start. It'll just be us two now, and we're going to be so happy.""

I just listened in silence.

Ronan took me home.

Rowan was already gone, and Ronan said he had pack business to handle.

I sat there numbly, emotions crashing over me. Until, finally, I took out the bond-breaking deal—and signed my name.

I signed the papers without hesitation and headed straight to his office.

But I found the door half-open, and no one inside.

It was my first time entering Ronan's office—neat, clean.

A photo of Mira sat on his desk.

And scattered drafts at the desk's edge were covered with her name, written over and over.

Every stroke filled with boyish devotion.

I thought I could accept this calmly.

But I couldn't. My heart felt like it was being crushed in someone's fist, suffocating pain.

On the desk sat an elegant gift box containing a stunning sapphire necklace.

Priceless. Irreplaceable.

I loved sapphires—their cool, proud beauty.

But Ronan always gave me gold jewelry.

He'd say: ""Jewelry should hold its value above all else. Besides, you're beautiful—you look regal in anything.""

I'd believed his sweet words.

Now, holding the sapphire necklace from the box, I saw how beautiful it was. The center sapphire was the size of a quail egg, surrounded by delicate diamonds that sparkled with every movement.

On the back, engraved: ""MH.""

MH. Mira Hale.

My breath caught. I laughed through my tears, finally understanding, then fled his self-made prison of love.

Enough. It was really enough.

I needed to get far away.

I contacted the rogue network, arranged for them to fake my death.

Now I just had to wait for the pack council to retrieve the settlement papers Ronan had hidden for three years.

Ronan didn't come home that night.

The next day, he returned with a smile: ""Lyra, tomorrow is your sister's birthday and New Year's Eve. Let's celebrate together.""

""I already invited Mira to join us for dinner, using your name. You two have been distant too long—it's time to heal this rift. For me, please?""

I looked at Ronan.

He coaxed me gently, his dark eyes full of apparent sincerity and devotion.

Suddenly I remembered that darkest year when he'd looked at me the same way, taking the blade from my hands, saving me from suicide.

""Fine. I'll go.""

He wanted this, so I'd give it to him.

Consider it repayment for all those times he'd saved me during my worst episodes.

New Year's Eve.

Ronan had reserved the entire restaurant.

Mira arrived in a pristine white dress.

Ronan immediately dropped my hand and walked to her.

""Mira, happy birthday. This is my gift to you.""

I recognized the familiar gift box.

The familiar sapphire necklace.

Of course it was for her.

Seeming to remember I was there, Ronan added stiffly: ""Your sister and I picked it out together.""

Mira raised an eyebrow. ""Thank you. I love it.""

After Ronan left for the kitchen to place our order, she immediately dropped her smile and walked toward me.

""Luna Cross still remembers her poor little sister—how sweet!""

""But you do realize your Alpha is just my second choice, right?""

I glanced at her and sat down.

""That all you came here to say?""

Mira looked pissed that I wasn't breaking down, then her smile turned vicious.

""Of course not. You gave me a gift, so I've got one for you too.""

She pulled out a green jade bracelet and threw it on the table like garbage.

The moment I saw what it was, my blood ran cold.

This was the bracelet from my mother's urn.

How did Mira get her hands on it?

I lunged forward and grabbed her arm. ""How did you get that bracelet? Tell me!""

Mira smiled viciously. ""I dug up that bit//ch's ashes, obviously. See how thoughtful I am? I even saved the bracelet for you.""

""Lyra, if your mom hadn't refused to reject my father's bond, my mother never would've wasted away from heartbreak. It's all that bithc's fault—she deserved every second of drowning!""

""But even dead, she doesn't deserve a proper burial. So I scattered her ashes in the pack's waste dump where garbage belongs!""

Rage exploded through me. My vision went red as I wrapped both hands around her throat.

""Mira, you did murder my mother on purpose. I'll kill you!""

Mira struggled, laughing maniacally. ""Got proof I killed anyone? Your ex-mate loves me, your current Alpha loves me. They all think I'm innocent and sweet. They all protect me. What can you do about it?""

Her words only fueled my fury, but years of illness had weakened me. I couldn't choke her, and she shoved me away hard.

""Sister, why do you hate me so much? I know I was wrong—please stop hitting me.""

""Mira, are you okay?"" Ronan rushed over, having heard the commotion. He glared at me with pure anger and slapped me across the face without hesitation, his eyes full of disappointment.

""Lyra, she's your sister and you tried to choke her to death! Have you lost your mind?""

Mira shook her head pitifully.

""Ronan, don't blame my sister. It's all my fault—I'm the one who hurt our mother.""

Ignoring the bu//rning pain in my cheek, I stared at him with bloodshot eyes.

“How did she open my mother's coffin?! You… you sent her, didn’t you?! Only you and I knew where mom's grave was.”

""What are you talking about?"" Ronan looked incredulous. ""Mira just went to pay her respects. How can you think such evil thoughts about your own sister?""

He'd promised to hide his feelings for Mira around me.

But the moment there was any conflict, he showed his true colors.

Yet he still didn't realize it.

I looked at him with trembling hands and suddenly laughed.

""Ronan, since you're so determined to protect her, then keep protecting her. Don't ever change, even if I die tonight.""

""Because I'm afraid you'll regret it for the rest of your life.""

Ronan suddenly looked panicked. He released Mira and tried to calm me down.

""Don't say things like that to scare me—it makes me worry. I'm not protecting her, you just looked terrifying back there. You really wanted to kill her, you know that? Your mother was her savior—she was just paying respects. There's no way she'd desecrate your mother's grave. Stop being so paranoid. It hurts both of you.""

""I'm sorry I hit you. I was impulsive. Go home and rest, take your medication. I'll take Mira to the hospital to get checked out.""

""Once she's fine, I'll come straight home to you, okay?""

With that, he left with Mira.

Mira looked back at me, her lips curved in a mocking smile.

I stared at her, unable to take another step, my hands shaking uncontrollably, unable to breathe.

Overwhelming emotions crashed over me. I collapsed to the floor, completely broken.

I knew this was a panic attack.

My phone rang multiple times, but I didn't have the strength to answer.

After what felt like hours, I finally picked up.

""Miss Hale, this is the Crescent Moon Pack Council. The settlement documents you requested have been retrieved and sent to your residence. Please check for them.""

""Thank you."" I forced down my suffocating emotions, dragged my broken body up, and left the restaurant.

I deleted all of Ronan's contact information and threw away my old phone.

From now on, there was nothing between us.

On the way home from the hospital after dropping Mira off, Ronan's phone suddenly rang.

He answered, only to hear shocking news.

""Alpha Cross, this is the Crescent Moon Pack Council. We just recovered the body of a she-wolf near the coast. Found with her were a letter of forgiveness dated three years ago, and a suicide note.”

> After a few long arduous year in the middle of UAP Disclosure intensifying, my research partner Michael and I have finally locked in the first part of our UAP historical trilogy starting with MAGENTA 33, which will be directed and produced by an award-winning filmmaking team documenting the work that Michael aka u/36_39_42 and I have done, what the process has been like (emotional and intense!), and finishing the story of whether Italy and Germany tried to take over the world after getting their hands on the 1933 Magenta, Italy UAP crash-retrieval (it sure looks like it).

> We’ve had many discussions the past few months, walking them through the story and testing out a few different approaches via other perspective avenues.

> The project has a greenlight, but that means we’re at the fundraising portion for the entirely independent production. Fortunately we’ll have complete creative control as we travel to Italy and meet up with researchers and the descendants of witnesses and scientists and military members who were directly involved in the eleven-year long “Special Research” project before the American OSS got their hands on the craft with the help of Pope Pius XII and the Vatican.
> 
> The greenlight for the film came at a very synchronistic moment — an interview by Jesse Michaels of the now-late former Presidential to JFK, LBJ, Nixon and Ford, Harald Malmgren, who in this past year of his life began dropping jaw-dropping details of what he was told about the UAP crash-retrieval reverse-engineering program, dropped two hours before Michael and I were about to record our first joint interview detailing some of what we can reveal about the story of the Magenta UAP. In Malmgren’s interview with Michels, he talks at length about Magenta, the first time anyone had revealed any details about the story in an official capacity since Grusch revealed that it was the one case he’d gotten past the Pentagon’s DOPSR office, beyond what Michael and I and Geoff Cruikshank had revealed on Reddit. As we were watching Malmgren start talking about Magenta, our director Jon emailed us to tell us that we had the greenlight from our distributor, and now it was time to find funding. Meanwhile, our minds were being collectively warped watching a major figure in 20th Century political historical go over some of what we’d spent over a year putting together.

""Three years ago, you took Lyra as your Luna just to get her to forgive Mira.” 
“I've watched Lyra fall deeper for you every day, but you're still lying to her—passing off birth control pills as antidepressants. Aren’t you afraid she will lose it once she finds out the truth?"" 
Tristan paused, bitter smile curved his lips. 
""A pup I don't want doesn't need to exist. As for Lyra... as long as she stops interfering with Mira's happiness, I'll honor my commitment to protect her for life."" 
No one knew that I had long since learned Italian and understood every word they said. 
I stood in the living room, his fresh bite mark still throbbing on my neck, holding the bottle of my 'antidepressants.'
So all the love he showed me… was only a lie. 
What I thought was my salvation had been nothing but a crafted trap. 
Fine. If that’s the truth—I'd give them all exactly what they wanted. I’m done playing the fool.

""Good morning."" I wrapped my fingers around my coffee mug, glancing at my mate across the breakfast table. 

Ronan Cross sat there studying me in nothing but a thin nightgown, his amber eyes still blazing with that primal hunger from full moon.

""Morning."" I set down my cup, reminding him, ""Don't you have that pack meeting today?""

""Yeah."" Ronan smirked, pushing back from his chair and stalking over to me. ""The boys can wait for their Luna. Besides, we're working on the pack's heir.""

Before I could say anything, his mouth crashed against mine, tongue demanding entry as his fingers slipped beneath my panties.

My knees went weak as I breathed against his lips, ""Ronan...""

He cleared the table with one sweep of his arm, plates crashing to the floor. Then freed his co//ck, the tip already slick as he positioned himself between my spread legs.

I wrapped my legs around his waist, meeting each of his powerful thrusts as he pounded into me. 

After thirty minutes, Ronan buried himself deep and came hard inside me.

He kissed me lazily, then gave my butt a firm squeeze. ""Meeting shouldn't take long. I'll bring the guys back for dinner ."" His voice softened slightly: ""And babe? Don’t forget your antidepressants.""

I rolled my eyes, tugging my nightgown back down. ""Such a nag.""

He flashed those sharp canines in a grin before heading out to the pack house. I stayed slumped against the table, legs still trembling, but smiling despite myself.

I prepared a small gathering for him and Rowan, his beta.

Later that night, when his beta arrived, I went to change my clothes—only to overhear their conversation.

At the dinner table, Tristan’s beta suddenly switched to Italian.

""Three years ago, you took Lyra as your Luna just to get her to forgive Mira. I've watched Lyra fall deeper for you every day, but you're still lying to her—passing off birth control pills as antidepressants. Aren’t you afraid she will lose it once she finds out the truth?""

Tristan paused, his face clouded with a complex expression before a wry, bitter smile curved his lips. ""A pup I don't want doesn't need to exist. As for Lyra... as long as she stops interfering with Mira's happiness, I'll honor my commitment to protect her for life.""

No one knew that I had long since learned Italian and understood every word they said.

I stood in the living room, his fresh bite mark still throbbing on my neck, holding the bottle of my 'antidepressants.'

So all the love he showed me… was only a lie.

What I thought was my salvation had been nothing but a crafted trap.

I didn't hesitate. I swallowed the pills—they tasted more bitter than ever before.

The conversation at the dinner table continued, Rowan's voice low and heavy with guilt

“Forget the whole pup situation for a second—three years ago, when Mira jumped into that river, Lyra’s mom dove in to save her. But Mira shoved her under and let her drown. Ronan, come on, the footage was clear as day. She did it on purpose. Lyra had every right to take it to the pack court.”

""But you became Lyra's legal guardian just to keep Mira out of prison. You signed that settlement behind Lyra's back. Sure, Mira walked free, but Lyra's been drowning in depression ever since. She blames herself every single day. If she ever learns the truth, it'll destroy her completely.""

Ronan's eyes flashed with irritation, but his voice stayed cold and firm. ""Mira didn't mean it. She was drowning—those movements were just instinct. She regrets it too.""

""I've hidden those documents well. Lyra will never know the truth. I'll be good to her, spend my life making it up to her, give her a home. She'll forget the pain. She'll heal.""

Rowan sighed. “Look, don’t blow up—I just feel bad for Lyra, that’s all. You showed up when she was at rock bottom, and of course she fell for you. But you were never over Mira.”

“Whatever, man. Just... hope you can live with this secret. And I hope you won't regret it.”

Ronan drained his glass, each word deliberate: ""I will never regret it.""

That one sentence—“I will never regret it”—tore apart the last of my illusions like sharp claws.

Tomorrow was New Year's Eve. The streets buzzed with celebration.

Just this morning, Ronan had fu//cked me senseless, his teeth at my throat, saying how much he loved me.

Now every word felt like a blade cutting me open.

I collapsed on a park bench, tears streaming down my face.

All those buried memories came flooding back.

Mira loved my ex mate Evan desperately. The day he and I got engaged, she couldn't handle it—left a suicide note and jumped into the river.

Even though Mira was a strong swimmer and my father's illegitimate daughter, my mother still dove in to save her.

So many people filmed it. I watched my mother lift Mira toward the surface, only for Mira to press down on her shoulders, use her feet to push my mother's head underwater.

That's how my mother drowned.

When I arrived, Mira cried pitifully: ""I just lost my head for a moment, sis. Please don't blame me. When mom saved me, she must have wanted me to live well...""

I broke down, demanding to know why she'd pushed my mother underwater when she could swim perfectly well. She just kept crying, insisting it wasn't intentional.

I sued her for murder.

But the next day, there was a knock at my door.

I opened it, eyes red, barely dry from crying.

“Evan ?” I asked, caught off guard by his sudden visit. “Are you here for my mother’s funeral?”

He stood outside, cold and distant, his voice like a blade:

“No,” he said, standing at the threshold. “Listen carefully. I, Evan Locke, Alpha of the Locke Pack, reject you, Lyra Hale, to be my mate and future Luna.”

“What?” I froze, struck as if by lightning, unable to move. “What are you doing?”

“Accept it.” He ignored my question, “Take my rejection.”

Evan’s voice was cold, without a trace of hesitation or mercy. The eyes that once gazed at me so tenderly were now colder than Arctic snow.

“NOW.”

A chill swept over me. Suppressed by his Alpha bloodline, I could only obey. “I accept your rejection.”

The moment the mate bond snapped, my wolf let out a sorrowful howl—as if her soul had been torn apart.

I thought my tears had long dried up, yet they slid down silently once more.

“Why?” My voice came out hoarse.

Evan lowered his eyes, his tone still as cold and cutting as ice: “I won’t allow you to harm Mira.”

That single sentence sent me plummeting into the abyss.

He didn’t just break off our engagement. Before the eyes of the entire pack, he sealed the mate bond with Mira. That day, the whole pack celebrated their union, while I was cast out, becoming the laughingstock of the pack.

Then the pack erupted with rumors—that I was using my mother's death for sympathy, for attention, for power.

They called me jealous, said that's why my mate rejected me.

The pressure nearly suffocated me. I had a complete breakdown and developed severe depression.

But I never gave up seeking justice for my mother.

My mother cared for me, protected me for twenty-three years. How could I abandon her?

That's when Ronan began his relentless pursuit.

Such careful attention, such devoted protection.

I saw him as my salvation and accepted his claim.

After our mating ceremony, the court found Mira innocent.

So I tried to let go, I wanted his pup. I just... wanted us to feel like a real family.”

I never imagined that my salvation was just proof of his love for Mira all along.

Ronan appeared beside me, holding an umbrella over my head.

The moment he saw me, his furrowed brow relaxed slightly, concern flashing in his eyes.

""You disappeared without a word. I was worried sick.""

""And it's getting colder every day. I'm buried in pack business with year-end territory disputes—if you get sick, how am I supposed to take care of you?""

I wasn't surprised he'd found me. He'd installed a tracking app on my phone.

He said he was afraid my depression would make me do something dangerous. He wanted to protect me.

I'd believed him.

But now I knew better. He was probably just making sure I wouldn't go after Mira.

I blinked, my tears already dried up, staring at the snowflakes falling from the sky.

""Old wolves say the Moon Goddess listens closer during the first snow. That's why I came out here.""

First wish: to sever my mate bond with Ronan cleanly.

Second wish: never having to see him again after I left the pack.

Third wish: for mom not to hate me.

Not to hate me for falling in love with the man who protected her killer. For wanting to have his pup.

Ronan draped his jacket over my shoulders, playfully tapping my nose. ""Then you should dress warmer. Look at your hands—they're freezing.""

""What did you pray for?""

I watched him put on his caring act, feeling nothing.

""About us. And about mom.""

Ronan's face went rigid. He studied me carefully.

""Mira is your half-sister, after all. Blood is thicker than water. She was devastated when your mom died too. You're each other's only family. It's been three years now, maybe...""

I knew what he was getting at. ""I know. I won't cause trouble anymore.""

I'd already sued her. Mira wasn't convicted.

I didn't appeal then.

Even if I withdrew the family's forgiveness letter now, it wouldn't change anything.

Ronan relaxed, relief flickering across his face. His mood clearly improved.

""Baby, I'm so glad you can let this go.""

""New year, new start. It'll just be us two now, and we're going to be so happy.""

I just listened in silence.

Ronan took me home.

Rowan was already gone, and Ronan said he had pack business to handle.

I sat there numbly, emotions crashing over me. Until, finally, I took out the bond-breaking deal—and signed my name.

I signed the papers without hesitation and headed straight to his office.

But I found the door half-open, and no one inside.

It was my first time entering Ronan's office—neat, clean.

A photo of Mira sat on his desk.

And scattered drafts at the desk's edge were covered with her name, written over and over.

Every stroke filled with boyish devotion.

I thought I could accept this calmly.

But I couldn't. My heart felt like it was being crushed in someone's fist, suffocating pain.

On the desk sat an elegant gift box containing a stunning sapphire necklace.

Priceless. Irreplaceable.

I loved sapphires—their cool, proud beauty.

But Ronan always gave me gold jewelry.

He'd say: ""Jewelry should hold its value above all else. Besides, you're beautiful—you look regal in anything.""

I'd believed his sweet words.

Now, holding the sapphire necklace from the box, I saw how beautiful it was. The center sapphire was the size of a quail egg, surrounded by delicate diamonds that sparkled with every movement.

On the back, engraved: ""MH.""

MH. Mira Hale.

My breath caught. I laughed through my tears, finally understanding, then fled his self-made prison of love.

Enough. It was really enough.

I needed to get far away.

I contacted the rogue network, arranged for them to fake my death.

Now I just had to wait for the pack council to retrieve the settlement papers Ronan had hidden for three years.

Ronan didn't come home that night.

The next day, he returned with a smile: ""Lyra, tomorrow is your sister's birthday and New Year's Eve. Let's celebrate together.""

""I already invited Mira to join us for dinner, using your name. You two have been distant too long—it's time to heal this rift. For me, please?""

I looked at Ronan.

He coaxed me gently, his dark eyes full of apparent sincerity and devotion.

Suddenly I remembered that darkest year when he'd looked at me the same way, taking the blade from my hands, saving me from suicide.

""Fine. I'll go.""

He wanted this, so I'd give it to him.

Consider it repayment for all those times he'd saved me during my worst episodes.

New Year's Eve.

Ronan had reserved the entire restaurant.

Mira arrived in a pristine white dress.

Ronan immediately dropped my hand and walked to her.

""Mira, happy birthday. This is my gift to you.""

I recognized the familiar gift box.

The familiar sapphire necklace.

Of course it was for her.

Seeming to remember I was there, Ronan added stiffly: ""Your sister and I picked it out together.""

Mira raised an eyebrow. ""Thank you. I love it.""

After Ronan left for the kitchen to place our order, she immediately dropped her smile and walked toward me.

""Luna Cross still remembers her poor little sister—how sweet!""

""But you do realize your Alpha is just my second choice, right?""

I glanced at her and sat down.

""That all you came here to say?""

Mira looked pissed that I wasn't breaking down, then her smile turned vicious.

""Of course not. You gave me a gift, so I've got one for you too.""

She pulled out a green jade bracelet and threw it on the table like garbage.

The moment I saw what it was, my blood ran cold.

This was the bracelet from my mother's urn.

How did Mira get her hands on it?

I lunged forward and grabbed her arm. ""How did you get that bracelet? Tell me!""

Mira smiled viciously. ""I dug up that bit//ch's ashes, obviously. See how thoughtful I am? I even saved the bracelet for you.""

""Lyra, if your mom hadn't refused to reject my father's bond, my mother never would've wasted away from heartbreak. It's all that bithc's fault—she deserved every second of drowning!""

""But even dead, she doesn't deserve a proper burial. So I scattered her ashes in the pack's waste dump where garbage belongs!""

Rage exploded through me. My vision went red as I wrapped both hands around her throat.

""Mira, you did murder my mother on purpose. I'll kill you!""

Mira struggled, laughing maniacally. ""Got proof I killed anyone? Your ex-mate loves me, your current Alpha loves me. They all think I'm innocent and sweet. They all protect me. What can you do about it?""

Her words only fueled my fury, but years of illness had weakened me. I couldn't choke her, and she shoved me away hard.

""Sister, why do you hate me so much? I know I was wrong—please stop hitting me.""

""Mira, are you okay?"" Ronan rushed over, having heard the commotion. He glared at me with pure anger and slapped me across the face without hesitation, his eyes full of disappointment.

""Lyra, she's your sister and you tried to choke her to death! Have you lost your mind?""

Mira shook her head pitifully.

""Ronan, don't blame my sister. It's all my fault—I'm the one who hurt our mother.""

Ignoring the bu//rning pain in my cheek, I stared at him with bloodshot eyes.

“How did she open my mother's coffin?! You… you sent her, didn’t you?! Only you and I knew where mom's grave was.”

""What are you talking about?"" Ronan looked incredulous. ""Mira just went to pay her respects. How can you think such evil thoughts about your own sister?""

He'd promised to hide his feelings for Mira around me.

But the moment there was any conflict, he showed his true colors.

Yet he still didn't realize it.

""Ronan, since you're so determined to protect her, then keep protecting her. Don't ever change, even if I die tonight.""

""Because I'm afraid you'll regret it for the rest of your life.""

Ronan suddenly looked panicked. He released Mira and tried to calm me down.

""Don't say things like that to scare me—it makes me worry. I'm not protecting her, you just looked terrifying back there. You really wanted to kill her, you know that? Your mother was her savior—she was just paying respects. There's no way she'd desecrate your mother's grave. Stop being so paranoid. It hurts both of you.""

""I'm sorry I hit you. I was impulsive. Go home and rest, take your medication. I'll take Mira to the hospital to get checked out.""

""Once she's fine, I'll come straight home to you, okay?""

With that, he left with Mira.

Mira looked back at me, her lips curved in a mocking smile.

I stared at her, unable to take another step, my hands shaking uncontrollably, unable to breathe.

Overwhelming emotions crashed over me. I collapsed to the floor, completely broken.

Here’s where things get weird: I’m really into coffee. Like… I use a Zerowater jug to completely demineralize my water, and then I re-mineralize it with Lotus Water (it’s a kit with four droppers: magnesium, calcium, sodium, and potassium). I know, total rabbit hole.

I’m asking myself if adding a bit of (any amount of) those minerals to milk would change the taste or texture of homemade chocolate milk? Could it help improve mouthfeel, sweetness, or make it closer to the boxed stuff?

She had been married to all three of them in her last life.In the upper circles, everyone knew the Thompson, Vegara, Vanderpool, and Dalton families were the four powerhouses of Chicago.Emma, the only daughter among the four, had become the most sought-after bride—each of the other three families wanted to marry into the Dalton family.In her previous life, when she was choosing her marriage partner for the first time, she chose Isaac Thompson, and she happily thought that she would be happy for the rest of her life.However, after they got married, he was not at home for 364 out of 365 days a year, not only making her a laughing stock in the circle but also dying in a chain car accident while trying to protect Janet.Emma had been widowed at a young age, losing her first husband and spending three years alone before being remarried to Anthony Vegara—another match arranged by her family.However, Anthony never cared about the marriage. To him, Emma meant nothing. In their second year together, he died in a reckless racing accident—all for Janet.Because of this, people started calling Emma a husband-killer. It was not until she turned 30 that she married Mateo Vanderpool.This time, their marriage was quiet and respectful. They lived peacefully, growing old together—until Mateo fell ill. Before he died, he held her hand and whispered his final wish.""Emma, if there's another life, please don't marry me. I just want to be with Janet.""It was then Emma realized that all of them had loved Janet.That was why, before they each died, their last words were always the same, ""Don't choose me for marriage.""Janet was just the daughter of the Dalton family's butler. She was neither beautiful nor talented. All she knew how to do was act fragile and sweet.Emma never understood how she lost to someone like that. She never knew why the men loved Janet so much that they were even willing to marry Emma just to protect Janet from being used by the family.Emma spent her whole life watching them love Janet, and her whole life learning one simple truth.She, Emma Dalton, was never anyone's supporting role.She did not want someone who did not want her.So in this life, she did not pick any of the same men. Instead, she gave her parents a new answer.""If I'm getting married, I only want Samuel from the Lockwood family.""Brent and Cassandra were stunned.""Samuel? The illegitimate son of the Lockwoods in New York? Why would you want to marry him all of a sudden?""Because in his previous life, Samuel Lockwood rose to become the richest man in the world. He topped the Forbes list and held massive sway in the business world.If this marriage was for the family's benefit, then Emma needed to get the most out of it.Samuel was a man who came with nothing but advantages.As for love? She had stopped hoping for that.Even though Brent and Cassandra were strongly opposed at first, Emma racked her brain to come up with reason after reason.""New York's economy is booming, and the Lockwood Group is the most influential family there. Haven't you always wanted to break into the New York market but had to back off because we didn't have a foothold? Marrying Samuel is our chance. You've even said it yourselves—Samuel is ambitious, sharp, and ruthless. A man like that is bound to achieve great things.""Emma's analysis was solid, and they could not find any flaw in her logic.After weighing the pros and cons, they finally decided to support her choice. They took the initiative to contact the Lockwood family and finalize the engagement.""Emma, both families have come to an agreement. The wedding will be held in half a month.""When she heard that, Emma finally felt a bit of relief settle in her chest.Time was tight, so Brent and Cassandra hurried to prepare the dowry.Emma sat alone on the couch, her mind a swirl of thoughts and emotions all tangled up.Just then, footsteps sounded at the door.Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo stepped inside, their eyes immediately landing on her.""Emma, who did you choose to marry?""They asked in unison, their faces full of tension and seriousness. For a moment, Emma was dazed.The four of them had grown up together. They were childhood friends who were practically inseparable.Those three had always treated her like a princess and spoiled her endlessly.Whatever she wanted, they gave it to her. Whenever she was upset, they comforted her, and whenever she was bullied, they stood up for her first.Back then, she truly believed that it was because they cared deeply.In her previous life, when they rushed in with those same questions, she had thought it was because they were excited to be chosen.Now, she saw it clearly. They were not hoping to be picked, and that was what those expressions meant.That realization made her heartache. Her chest felt tight as if she could not breathe.After a long silence, she finally composed herself, then replied in a low, raspy voice.""In 15 days, you'll know who I chose.""Emma did not budge, still keeping her answer to herself. The three of them were starting to get impatient, clearly eager to press her for more.However, before she could say anything else, her phone rang.""Emma, Janet was badly hurt in an accident and she's in the hospital right now. But there aren't any available wards. Can you help us?"" The tearful voice of the butler, Horace Jameson, trembled through the speaker.Before Emma could even react, Isaac grabbed the phone from her, his tone tight with concern.""Which hospital?""There was a pause on the other end. Then, choking on emotion, Horace named the hospital.Isaac hung up immediately, turned to Emma, and said, ""Don't worry about it, Emma. I'll handle the hospital situation. It's nothing.""Without missing a beat, Anthony and Mateo also jumped in.""The hospital's owned by the Vegara family. I'll talk to the director myself. Just stay home and rest, Emma.""""I know some top-tier specialists. I'll reach out to them, so you don't need to worry.""They all claimed they were doing it for her, but Emma knew the truth—they were all just looking for excuses to rush to Janet's side.How had she missed it before? Their feelings had been right in front of her the whole time.As she watched their backs disappear out the door, Emma gave a faint, bitter smile.Then she turned away, walked back to her room, and quietly began packing everything related to them.By the time she finished, night had fallen. She picked up her phone and saw Janet's newest post on her feed.""Another day of being doted on by the three powerful men.""Attached was a selfie from the VIP ward.She was sipping Mateo's signature soup while Isaac's watch sat neatly on the bedside table. Meanwhile, Anthony's jacket was draped over the chair beside her.Emma tapped ""Like"" on the post, then looked at the three boxes she had just packed.Each box held the gift she had received at 18—one from Isaac's father, one from Anthony's mother, and one from Mateo's grandfather. All three were heirlooms from the three families.Whichever one she chose to keep would symbolize her family's decision on which family to form a marriage alliance with.Now, her marriage had already been decided and it was time to give her an answer.Emma called a courier to her home and handed the three boxes to him.""Please mail these out separately—15 days from today.""Chapter 2After mailing out the packages, Emma tossed everything she had just organized straight into the trash.The jewelry and designer bags gifted by Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo, the old videos and photos from their time together, even the custom suits she had designed for them with care...All of it—every memory tied to them—was now part of the past, discarded without hesitation.In this life, Emma was not going to repeat her old mistakes.She poured all her focus into preparing for the wedding, tuning out the world outside her own little bubble.After a few hectic days of picking out her dress and accessories, she finally came home—only to find Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo all fussing over Janet.One was adjusting the AC temperature, another gently fanning a bowl of soup to cool it down, and the third was draping a blanket over her, asking how she was feeling with sincere concern.Watching Janet being doted on like royalty, Emma could not help but smile bitterly to herself.The affection was so obvious now, how had she missed it before?The ache in her chest tightened, leaving her feeling drained and a little hollow.Right then, Janet noticed her standing at the door. Startled like a timid bird, Janet quickly got to her feet, her expression filled with fear and deference.""Emma, you're back! I'll go heat up some water and get dinner started. Please give me a moment.""She started to rise, but Isaac gently held her down.""Janet's still recovering. There are plenty of other staff around. Emma, just ask someone else to handle it.""Anthony and Mateo chimed in as well. ""She's still pretty injured. Emma, just let her rest.""""If you're really short on help, we can always transfer more staff. There's no need for Janet to be doing chores in her condition.""Since the moment she walked in, Emma had said nothing—yet she was being lectured like she'd done something wrong.She let out a quiet breath and narrowed her eyes slightly. ""I know she's the daughter of our butler, not our maid. And I've never forced her to do anything. But since you all care about her so much, maybe you should just take her home and look after her yourselves. That way, you don't have to worry so much.""Janet's eyes widened in shock and she immediately dropped to her knees.""Emma, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have slacked off just because I'm sick. Please don't drive me and my dad away. I'll get up right now and get to work.""Her knee hit the ground hard and they bruised instantly. Her tears streamed down her face like rain, looking like she had been deeply wronged.The moment her tears started falling, Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo's expressions darkened.The three of them rushed to help Janet up, shielding her behind them as they all turned to Emma, their voices tinged with frustration.""Janet didn't do anything wrong. Why are you trying to kick her out for no reason? Do you really have to bully her like this?""""She's still hurt and was trying to heat your water and make you dinner. Not only do you not care about her condition, but you're also forcing her to leave. Do you have no heart at all?""""She's hurt even worse now. If anything happens to her later because of this, are you just going to pretend it's nothing? Will you only be satisfied if she completely breaks down?""Watching them so naturally jump to defend Janet, Emma's expression turned colder by the second.""I didn't do anything except suggest that you take her home if you're that worried. That's considered bullying now? In your eyes, am I really that unreasonable and difficult? So no matter what happens, she's the victim and I'm the one to blame?""Her words brought silence crashing down on the room.Seeing their frozen expressions, Emma felt a wave of helplessness wash over her.She did not want to say anything more. Without another word, she turned and walked back to her bedroom.Just as she had finally calmed down, there was a knock at the door.Janet came in timidly, holding a cup of coffee. ""I'm sorry, Emma. Please don't be angry at them. They only spoke like that because they were too worried about me. It's my fault you ended up fighting. If you need someone to blame, blame me.""Having lived through this once already, Emma knew exactly what Janet was trying to do. She would put on a pitiful act and stir the pot.""Leave the coffee and get out.""Emma's voice was cold and detached. Hearing that, Janet looked even more wronged, but she did not dare push back.Then, she pretended to fumble and spilled the entire cup of coffee.The hot liquid splashed onto Emma, scalding her skin until it turned red and blistered.Emma let out a hiss of pain and instinctively shoved Janet's helping hand away.Janet took the chance to stumble backward dramatically, slamming her head against the edge of the table. A bloody gash instantly opened on her forehead.Her sharp cries filled the entire villa.Before Emma could even react, Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo burst through the door.Seeing Janet unconscious on the floor with blood running down her head, the three of them instantly panicked.Anthony shoved past Emma without hesitation. Isaac rushed forward and scooped Janet into his arms, while Mateo pressed down on the wound to stop the bleeding.They hurried off, completely focused on protecting Janet. No one even noticed Emma had stumbled into the glass display case.Shards flew everywhere as the glass shattered, slicing into her skin and leaving her covered in cuts.Blood soaked through her clothes. Her face twisted in pain, and her whole body trembled uncontrollably.Watching their figures disappear down the hall, Emma could not hold back her tears any longer.Her heart ached so much it felt like she could not breathe. She bit down hard on her lip to keep from sobbing out loud.Only one final thought echoed in her mind: She had to walk away from their world for good. Never again would she let herself be part of it.Chapter 3After pushing through the pain and getting her wounds treated at the hospital, Emma took the prescription and headed to the pharmacy window—only to spot a few familiar figures outside the next ward.Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo were standing outside Janet's room, their faces full of worry and heartache.""I've said it before, Janet's too soft. If she stays there, she's just going to keep suffering. Once the marriage is finalized, I'll find a way to get her out, no matter what. I don't want her to go through this anymore.""""Now that our parents know Janet's the one we really care about, we have to make sure she's protected. So no matter who Emma chooses, that guy has to accept the marriage and go along with it. That's the only way the family won't come after Janet.""Emma stood there quietly, listening to every word, and suddenly felt her chest tighten.So this was why they had gone along with the marriage in the previous life even when they clearly did not want to.They thought they were protecting someone they loved even if it meant sacrificing their own happiness.Yet, in doing so, they wrecked hers.She looked down and laughed bitterly, tears blurring her vision.They could relax this time as no one would have to sacrifice anything.Once she collected herself, she wiped away her tears and turned to leave—only for her phone alarm to go off suddenly.The sharp ringtone startled the three men. When they opened the door and saw her standing there, they all froze in surprise.""You're here? Are you planning to apologize to Janet?""""How much did you hear just now?""""What's with all those injuries? What happened to you?""They all spoke at once, questions flying at her.Emma answered calmly, one by one. ""I got hurt because you pushed me aside to get to Janet. I came here to get treatment, not to apologize. She spilled the hot coffee on me first, and I pushed her away. Running into you here was just a coincidence.""Hearing her words, the three men fell silent, their expressions shifting into something more complicated.After a moment, Anthony was the first to speak.""Janet didn't mean to spill the coffee. She's still recovering, so her hands are weak. Don't be mad at her. When we walked in and saw all that blood, we thought it was serious. That's why we lost it. I'm sorry.""Isaac also took a breath and calmed down. ""We weren't trying to blame you earlier. We just felt bad for Janet, so we said a few things on her behalf.""""Yeah,"" Mateo added, ""we all grew up together. You've always been the one who mattered most to us. Have you thought about the marriage?""As soon as he asked, the three of them stared at Emma, clearly nervous about her response.Emma looked at them, her expression unreadable. After what she had just overheard, all she felt was a bitter irony.""Thought it through?"" She gave a cold smile. ""I... ""Before she could finish, a sudden loud beeping came from the monitor in Janet's room.Their faces changed instantly, and they all rushed back in to check. Medical staff poured into the ward right after them.""The patient's kidneys were already compromised after the second trauma,"" a doctor explained urgently. ""We didn't catch it in time and administered the wrong medication. It's led to acute kidney failure. Her condition is very serious now!""Isaac's face went pale, his eyes red with panic.""How could you mess this up? She's still so young! If you ruin her life because of negligence, can you live with that?""Anthony grabbed the doctor by the collar and barked furiously, ""You've got half an hour. I want a treatment plan that guarantees results. If anything happens to her, you'll answer for it.""Mateo was already on the phone, frantically calling every contact he had.""Dr. Zimmerman, you're the best nephrologist in the country. Please, this is urgent. I need your help to save someone extremely important. Where are you now? I'll send my secretary to pick you up right away.""The whole ward was in chaos. Everyone was on edge, trying everything they could for Janet.Soon, the hospital pulled together a special team and quickly outlined the only viable solution.""She needs a kidney transplant as soon as possible,"" one specialist explained. ""But finding the right donor will take time. And the longer we wait, the higher the risk to her life.""Chapter 4After hearing the diagnosis, the three men did not hesitate for a second and immediately went to get tested for a match.The results came out quickly and Isaac was a compatible donor.Without a word, he picked up the consent form the doctor handed over, signed it on the spot, and walked straight into the operating room.Time ticked by slowly, and just as everyone was getting more and more anxious, a new problem cropped up.A nurse burst out of the OR in a panic, her voice urgent.""The hospital's blood bank is running low. The patient is hemorrhaging and needs a large amount of blood, fast!""Anthony and Mateo, who had been waiting nearby, immediately rolled up their sleeves.""We have the same blood type as Janet. Take our blood!""""But her condition is critical, and the two of you alone won't be enough. You need to call more donors... """"There's no time,"" Anthony interrupted. ""The two of us will do. Take as much as you need. Just save her!""The nurse had no choice but to rush them into the transfusion room.The red light outside the OR blinked nonstop, making Emma feel dizzy.She had seen everything—the panic, the surgery, and the blood donation. Right now, her mind was completely blank.In her previous life, when Isaac and Anthony died for Janet, she had not been there. She only learned about it afterward, buried in grief and confusion, unable to understand why they would risk everything for Janet.However, after everything that happened, she finally understood—they loved Janet so much that they were willing to give up everything for her.Be it marriage or their lives, they never thought twice, always putting her first no matter the cost.So, no, she could never compete with Janet.Yet, it did not matter anymore because this time, Emma had already decided to let go. She would step out of their tangled love story once and for all.Eventually, the OR light went off, and the doctor came out, wiping sweat from his brow.""Are you the family? The surgery was a success, so she'll wake up soon. However, the kidney donor needs monitoring in the ICU, and the two who donated blood passed out from blood loss. Can you handle taking care of four people on your own?""Emma shook her head, parted her dry lips, and spoke with a hoarse voice.""I have nothing to do with the four of them, but I can help contact their families. They should be here soon.""After saying that, she sent messages to the Thompson, Vegara, and Vanderpool families, as well as to Horace, briefly explaining the situation.She turned to leave, only to catch whispers from a few nearby nurses.""She's not related? I thought she was the wife of one of those three handsome guys!""""How could she be? If your husband risked his life for another woman, would you be okay with that? I bet those three are all in love with that girl. Why else would they be so desperate to save her?""Emma listened in silence, her lips curving into a faint, bitter smile.The nurses were right—Janet had always been the one whom the three men loved.And Emma would never be their wife again.Dragging her bruised and aching body back home, Emma found her parents waiting in the living room.When Brent and Cassandra saw the wounds on her body, their brows furrowed in concern. Not wanting them to worry, she quickly came up with a simple excuse.Hearing that her injuries were not serious and would heal soon, they finally relaxed and handed her a box.""This is the marriage token from the Lockwood family. Keep it safe. Samuel has already received the one we sent him.""""Just now, Mr. Thompson, Mrs. Vegara, and Mateo's grandfather all called to ask about the marriage and even mentioned Janet. They said the three boys are just too softhearted, but you're the one they truly care about. We didn't really know how to respond, and it's hard to judge the situation. You're old enough now to make your own choices. Your father and I won't interfere.""Emma reassured them and promised she would handle it herself.Over the next two days, she quietly gathered information on the Lockwood family and Samuel to get a better sense of who he was.Once she had a general understanding, she went to the mall and carefully picked out gifts that matched the Lockwood family's preferences.After a long day of shopping, she returned home with a car full of presents—only to see Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo waiting at the door.They had also brought gifts, nearly filling the entire living room.Noticing her confused expression, the three exchanged glances and then began to explain one after another.""These were prepared by our families,"" one of them said. ""They wanted us to come and apologize to you in person. You saw what happened that day—Janet was on the brink of death. She got injured again because of you, and we lost control. That's why you got hurt.""""Emma, if you're holding any anger, take it out on us. Just don't involve the elders, and don't blame Janet for everything. She was a victim too.""Emma could tell immediately that they were only here because their families made them come. Forced to apologize, and forced to speak on Janet's behalf.She was not in the mood to argue, so she simply responded with distant politeness.""Take your gifts away. This matter isn't worth talking about anymore. I'm tired, so I'd like to rest now.""As she spoke, she rubbed her aching eyes and reached into her bag to pull out her phone.Without noticing, the box containing the Lockwood family's marriage token slipped out and landed right at Isaac's feet. He bent down to pick it up.""What's this?""Anthony and Mateo glanced over, and the second they saw the box, their expressions changed.""A marriage token?"" Anthony asked, eyes narrowing. ""Emma, you've already chosen who you want to marry? Who is it?

I'm in the early stages of a documentary project about Portland's cable access television scene during the 1980s and 90s and ***I need your help***!

**Some context about the project:**

* I'm exploring how cable access TV during this time period reflected Portland's unique culture and provided space for creative expression.
* I'm currently looking at shows like Jim Spagg, The Chess Show, Insanity, Where's the Art, but interested in ALL cable access programming from this period.
* Currently investigating themes of free expression, censorship challenges, how marginalized communities used this platform, and the preservation efforts happening today
* I'm interested in documenting the history and legacy of community media in PDX

**I'm hoping to connect with:**

* People who created or worked on cable access shows
* Viewers who regularly watched or called in
* Staff who worked at the stations/facilities
* Anyone with archives, recordings, or memorabilia
* Those who remember how cable access impacted Portland's communities

**If you or someone you know was part of this scene, I'd love to hear:**

* What shows do you remember watching or creating?
* Any memorable moments, episodes, or personalities?
* How did cable access reflect Portland's culture at that time?
* Do you have any recordings, photos, or materials from that era?
* How did your experience with cable access impact you?

This is a passion project aimed at preserving this unique piece of Portland's media history before memories and materials are lost to time. I'm particularly interested in how cable access television provided a platform for voices and perspectives that weren't represented in mainstream media.

Feel free to comment below or DM me if you'd prefer to share privately. I'm happy to chat over coffee with anyone who has stories to share!

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Winnipeg Blue Bombers vs. Calgary Stampeders: A Tale of Two Teams (and a Porcupine in a Tuxedo)**

Ladies and gentlemen, grab your toques and prepare for a CFL clash that’s hotter than a poutine left in the sun. The Winnipeg Blue Bombers (3-1) and Calgary Stampeders (4-1) are set for a rematch, and the odds are as clear as a Saskatchewan winter sky—Winnipeg is the favorite, but Calgary’s got the swagger of a team that thinks they’ve already won. Let’s break this down with the precision of a Habs goalie and the humor of a Zamboni operator on a coffee break.

### Parsing the Odds: Math, Mayhem, and Misdirection

The numbers don’t lie (well, they might if they’re a Calgary fan). Winnipeg is the consensus pick at decimal odds of **1.5 (-666 American)**, implying a **66.6% chance** to win. Calgary’s +2.55 (+155 American) suggests bookmakers give them a **39.2% shot**, with the spread favoring Winnipeg by 4.5 points. That’s not just a gap—it’s a moat with a drawbridge and a grumpy medieval guard yelling, “No Calgary fans allowed!”

The total line sits at **49.5-50.5 points**, with even money on Over/Under. Given Calgary’s “stingy defense” (a polite way of saying they don’t let touchdowns like a porcupine in a tuxedo lets you forget its quills exist) and Winnipeg’s explosive offense, expect a tactical chess match, not a fireworks show.

### Digesting the News: Revenge, Legends, and a Heavy Heart

Calgary’s been the CFL’s answer to a viral TikTok trend this season—suddenly cool, with a 4-1 start, a league-best offensive line, and QB Vernon Adams Jr. throwing like he’s auditioning for a superhero movie. Their defense, led by the immortal Adam Bighill (CFL version of a “veteran mentor who still kicks butt”), has been so good, they’ve made the Edmonton Elks’ struggles look like a rookie’s first shift at a Tim Hortons.

But Winnipeg? They’re the underdog with a chip on their shoulder the size of a hockey puck. Remember their 23-10 loss to

1m1359n,https://www.reddit.com/r/NextCryptoMoonshots/comments/1m1359n/why_bitcoins_digital_gold_story_is_a_giant_lie/,Why Bitcoin’s ‘Digital Gold’ Story Is a Giant Lie Pushed by the Elite,"Let’s break the illusion.

They told us Bitcoin was digital gold. A hedge against inflation. A decentralized revolution for the people. But that narrative? It’s been hijacked.

Here’s the uncomfortable truth: the digital gold story is not organic — it’s propaganda pushed by early whales, institutions, and the elite. It’s the perfect trap to keep retail buyers emotionally locked into an asset that no longer serves them.

---

## 1. Bitcoin Is Controlled by a Handful of Players

Over 70% of Bitcoin is held by less than 2% of wallet addresses. Most of those are exchanges, ETFs, custodians, or wallets associated with billionaires. The average retail user owns peanuts in comparison — and they’re told to “HODL” while the elite swing the price.

---

## 2. Bitcoin Can’t Scale and Isn’t Practical

Try using Bitcoin to buy a coffee or pay a friend. You’ll deal with high fees, long confirmations, and a clunky experience. Even with Lightning Network, it’s reliant on centralized hubs and custodial solutions. That’s not freedom — it’s banking 2.0.

---

## 3. “Store of Value” Only Works for the Rich

A store of value is only useful when you have value to store. The elite treat BTC like digital real estate — a place to park wealth and exit on your liquidity. That’s why retail exists in their model: exit liquidity. They need you to believe in Bitcoin, so they can sell it to you at the top.

---

## 4. Every Time Bitcoin Pumps, Retail Buys — and the Elite Sell

Look at every bull cycle. Retail piles in late, buys the top, and holds the bag when it crashes. Meanwhile, insiders and institutions take profit. It’s rinse and repeat.

---

## 5. Bitcoin Isn’t the Same Bitcoin

The original Bitcoin vision was peer-to-peer digital cash. That’s why Satoshi created it. But after 2017, the dev direction changed. Now, it’s a speculative vehicle backed by Wall Street — not a payment system. That’s why Satoshi walked away.

---

Bitcoin is no longer the revolution. It’s the retirement fund for early miners, whales, and institutions. It’s not about inclusion — it’s about illusion.

In Super Mario RPG, there was an unknown battle background for Moleville, the ones seen inside of the sheds. This is my original mockup for the battle to ever exist in my favorite game. In addition to the Moleville battle, we also have the Witch Princess displayed on screen as it appears in her battle sprite, this can only happen right before you propose to the Witch Princess—to explain the fine print, here is an advice to explain how this works.

Black Heart Event
After defeating Punchinello head into one of the sheds you'll find on Moleville, Witch Princess will start complaining about her sister the Harvest Goddess. She'll ask you, ""Aren't you willing to bring ""Wilt Shroom"" for my recipe?"" In case, if you say ""Sure!"" she'll appreciate your response.

Purple Heart Event
Lose a battle by the Apprentice in Booster Pass 100 times, then head back to Moleville and the Witch Princess will still complain about her sister missing in the world. When she asks you, ""Have you been working on your strength?"" Tell her ""Of course!"" she'll give you a ""Able Juice"" only it's fragile to trade for the Root Beer.

Blue Heart Event
Collect 29 Wilt Shrooms from Knife Guy and Grate Guy in your inventory, then head back to the hut in Moleville and give all 29 Wilt Shrooms to the Witch Princess and she'll give you a ""Mocha"" (Coffee mixed with chocolate).

Yellow Heart Event
Collect 999 Coins and 999 Frog Coins, and you'll receive a ""Sugar,"" then head over to the Mole in the shop, then trade in the Sugar for a Mint Candy. Then head hack to the Witch Princess, and she'll accomplish Knuckles the present she received, ""Oh, how lovely~ A ""Mint Candy"" is actually what I've been looking for! I hope this is the right ingredient for my special baking soda recipe. Aren't you lucky at jumping on enemies around the world?"" Tell her ""Yes!"" and she'll ask Knuckles to trade in all 999 Coins for a Root Beer.

1m132ux,https://www.reddit.com/r/roasting/comments/1m132ux/traders_rush_to_land_brazilian_coffee_in_the_us/,Traders rush to land Brazilian coffee in the US before Trump's 50% tariff,"* Traders rush shipments to avoid 50% tariff before August 1
* U.S. coffee prices could rise further due to tariff hike
* Brazilian coffee may shift to Europe, Asia; U.S. to source elsewhere

NEW YORK, July 15 (Reuters) - Commodities traders are racing against time to unload as much Brazilian coffee as possible in the United States before Trump's new 50% tariff on Brazilian products is implemented on August 1, they said on Tuesday.  
  
Newly released data showed U.S. consumer prices rose in June as the cost of the Trump administration's tariffs began to be passed on, including to cups of coffee.

Some traders are diverting vessels mid-journey, canceling stops in other ports so that containers filled with Brazilian coffee can enter U.S. ports without paying the 50% tariff. Others are sending some Brazil-origin coffee they have in stock in neighboring countries such as Canada or Mexico, meant for use there, to the U.S. market instead. Meanwhile, U.S.-based importers are already posting wholesale listing prices that include the 50% additional charge for any shipment arriving after August 1.  
  
""We redirected some freight to land in the U.S. earlier, something that was headed to a longer journey,"" said Jeff Bernstein, managing director at coffee trader RGC Coffee. ""But for some other cargos, we could not speed up.""  
  
No workarounds are available for coffee yet to leave Brazil.  
  
Brazil produces a third of all the coffee used in the U.S., both as a single origin and as the base of most blends sold in the world's largest coffee-consuming country. The U.S. produces only around 1% of the coffee it uses.   
  
Prices for coffee in the U.S. have already risen sharply after a 70% spike in the market last year triggered by production shortages.  
  
If implemented, the new 50% tariff on imports from Brazil announced last week will cause a wave of price increases, market players say.  
  
""It is a form of taxation which is hurting American businesses. No one else. Not Brazil. Not Brazilian President Lula. This new 50% tariff is an existential threat to importers like me,"" said Steve Walter Thomas, chief executive of U.S.-based importer Lucatelli Coffee.  
  
Brazilian coffee co-op Expocacer, which increased its sales to the U.S. by 15% last year, said no renegotiation is possible for deals with delivery after August 1.  
  
""It is a tax imposed internally, in the importing country, so the importer is responsible to pay it and then pass it on to consumers,"" said Expocacer President Simao Pedro de Lima, adding that no export deals have been closed with U.S. buyers after the Trump announcement.  
  
Traders said if the tariff stands, coffee flows in the global market will be reordered, with Brazilian beans going to Europe and Asia, and the U.S. buying more from Africa, South and Central America.  
  
This change is not easy and will cost importers more, they said.   
  
One trader, who asked not to be named, said Brazilian coffee makes up a third of the blends sold by coffee chains Dunkin Donuts and Tim Hortons. He said it is also widely used by Starbucks.  
  
The three companies did not return requests for comment.  
  
The U.S. National Coffee Association declined to comment on the tariff, but said ""coffee is a fixture in Americans' daily lives and the U.S. economy,"" noting that two-thirds of American adults drink coffee each day.  
  
The association has asked the Trump administration to exempt coffee from the tariffs on Brazil.

Take that as you will, I guess. 

Some of these have appeared in previous posts, but I'm still including them for the sake of being thorough. Stuff that's left out I either don't know about or couldn't find enough info on to feel worth including (for the sake of this post I decided that ""enough info"" should be at least two of five things: permits applied for, social media/web presence for the brand, confirmation from media outlets, verbal confirmation from someone who should know, or the evidence of my own eyeballs that work is ongoing).

# New Restaurants and Cafes

\-- [Bloom Albany](https://www.bloomalbany.com/). This is has been in development for what feels like forever, but I messaged them on Instagram and they told me that they're still planning to open this year.

\-- [Itameshi](https://itameshialbany.com/?fbclid=IwY2xjawHy305leHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHd2xB3HUVj-o5SOH8dkChGIAidwLEX2PcMztVMJY6l0Za_cDN2XEuD26Hw_aem_DZ7ZPuhlIS_3ENbxs5zBjw). The region's first Japanese-Italian fusion restaurant is currently hiring staff. Editorializing: I really like itameshi food and hope that they do a good job. 

\-- The Boulevard. No websites or socials for this one yet, but I saw the permits a while ago and [the TU recently reported on it](https://www.timesunion.com/tablehopping/article/sams-italian-albany-boulevard-mash-more-20764834.php). It's an American restaurant replacing the much-mourned Sam's Italian American at 125 Southern Boulevard. According to the TU they've also  gotten some recipes from Sam's that they'll be putting on the menu, ""including its marinara sauce and possibly desserts.""

\-- Mash More. This is covered in the above TU article, and has also been discussed on here, but in case you missed it: a mashed potato-themed restaurant is going in at 278 Delaware Ave (the former KFC/Taco Bell near The Spectrum).

\-- Sultan Pizza & Grill. Halal spot opening up at 215 western, in that corner building where El Rey Mexitalia is. 

\-- Jack's Deli. This is one of the several projects coming from the private equity firm that bought Jack's Oyster house, Neovista Equities. Jack's Deli will be a Jewish-style deli at 41 State street, in a Broadway-facing space that used to be Okipoki. The company is [currently hiring for multiple positions](https://www.neovistaequities.com/careers) at the deli and other spots nearby (more on these later).

\-- [Java Cafe](https://www.instagram.com/javacafeny/). If you've walked down Madison lately, you may have noticed all of the work going on at 460 Madison, the previously empty space right next to the (now also vacant) Dorcey campaign headquarters and just two doors down from JA Pequeno. That's going to be the creatively-named ""Java Cafe,"" which according to their permit application will be serving coffee and pre-packaged food items like sandwiches and pastries. They already have furniture set up in there, so this one should be opening soon. 

\-- Gulshan Cafe and Sweets. This actually already opened about a week or so ago at 315 Central Ave, but I thought it was worth including because we don't have many (any?) other places in the area that specifically advertise themselves as Bangladeshi restaurants. No website yet, and I can't link to Facebook, but you can [see the menu here](https://www.clover.com/online-ordering/gulshan-cafe-and-sweets-albany). 

# New Bars

\-- [Jaja](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DL3NdX7y_60/). I just posted the Albany Business Review article about this, but JA Pequeno is expanding into the building next door and also adding a natural wine bar called Jaja.

\-- [Just a Bar](https://justabar.com/). This SEO nightmare will be located at 438 North Pearl, and is either owned by the guy who owns Rocks on Central or by another local bartrepreneur who just happens to have the exact same name. They are actively hiring, and a sign should be going up at the building soon. 

# Businesses Expanding in Albany 

\-- [Shah's Halal](https://www.shahshalalfood.com/albany/). This chain's teeny-tiny Albany outpost is moving across the street into a much larger and previously perma-vacant spot on the corner of Lark and Madison (across from the Dunkin').

\-- Stacks. In a fun little reverse of the [usual build-a-brand-in-the-city-then-divest-and-move-to-the-burbs](https://www.ciderbelly.com/) move popular with local businesses, Stacks is closing down its Pioneer Plaza location in Colonie and moving into the former Stagecoach space on State Street. 

\-- [Studio 23](https://studio23albany.square.site/). This salon is (slowly) moving from a small space on State to a bigger, more prominent location at 29 North Pearl (on the corner of Pearl and Maiden Lane). 

\-- [Gentleman's Corner](https://www.gcbsny.com/). This local barbershop chain is [opening their first Albany location](https://www.timesunion.com/business/article/local-barbershop-expands-owner-aims-broader-20367995.php) in the currently-extremely-pink building at 449 Madison Ave. The gentleman have already applied for a permit for exterior painting. 

# Misc New Businesses

\-- [Neovista Fresh Market](https://www.neovistafreshmarket.com/). Our private equity friends have been busy little beavers with this one. They've already gone before the Historic Resources Commission to get approval to changes to their building at 52 James Street (in that row of old buildings that faces tricentennial park), [hired a grocery store manager](https://www.neovistaequities.com/about/operating-team/novell-dolly) to run the place, and got a website and socials up. When I reached out, they said that they're shooting for a fall opening.

\-- [Neovista Daycare](https://neovistadaycarecenter.com/). This is going in the same building as the market, and is already enrolling kids.

# Stuff I Thought Was Interesting But Couldn't Confirm is Actually Happening 

\-- The still under-construction ""The Rise Downtown"" apartment building at 48 North Pearl has a commercial space on the ground floor, and the city recently approved a permit to fit that space up as an art gallery. I could find absolutely zero additional info.

\-- The city has approved a permit for something called ""Level Up Gaming Zone"" in a former barber shop at 785 Madison.

\-- A few permits have been filed for updates to 204 Washington Ave to fit up the space for a business called ""Natural mystic Jamaican Restaurant.""",2,1752639040.0,Albany,0,1.0,False

I (21F) work for a very popular coffee shop in my local town. Its not a small town, but its not huge. 

I have recently gone off meds, and am raw dogging coping skills out in the wild that is society, and its honestly been going pretty well. Until today.

Its 11 AM on a Friday, which means EVERYONE gets paid, which means its gonna be busy. So we are staffed accordingly to handle the rush and million pickup orders we KNOW are coming because they come every Friday like clock work. I was doing some cleaning around our parking lot because there was litter and I was trying to be green for a change and not leave it for someone else to clean. 

Im out doing a good deed before I clock out of my shift, and this lady in a black jeep speeds up into the parking spot next to me, coming mere inches from hitting me.

Not gonna lie, I was immediately pissed because wth? She then proceeds to yell at me in gibberish. My face clearly states how stupid I think she is, and she proceeds to talk to me like a damn toddler. 

I have two voices in my head, one saying “crash out”, the other saying “remember your training”. So, I take a breath and try and control my tone, because aint no way im controlling my face. Basically this coffee goblin is screaming at me because she has been here for 10 minutes waiting for her pickup order. 

Now our building, packed. Parking lots basically full and both lines are double wrapped. There are a ton of people also, at the pickup window in our dining room. I look around to motion for her to use the underused brain of her and see the state of my team. It was in vain—so I say the magic words “What was your pickup time?” Rudely and aggressively she says “11:47” .
Let’s take a guess what time it was? You guess it—she was early. 

So im reaching deep into my subconsciousness to find an ounce of the medication that had left my body—grasping at mere morsels of whatever left behind chemicals there may or could be. I calmly tell her, with a very forced smile “Its 11:40–since your pickup time is for 11:47 and it is pretty busy, they will have it out at your scheduled time” 

She cut me off, and reached her grub munching hands to touch me, and this is where I may have been TA but for a good cause—she needed humility. 

She started yelling, so i said i didnt get paid enough to care, and walked away in the middle of her battle cries. She then opens the door and grabs my sleeve while loudly screaming at me. i yanked my arm free from this fiend and kicked her car door closed and I said “respectfully if you do that again, I will clock out and this will become a police matter. Do not ——ing touch me” “You showing up 20 minutes before your scheduled time is not a me problem, its is the result of your literary incompetence. Just because you lacked basic elementary education to read a clock doesnt give you the right to manhandle or disrespect someone. Your order is scheduled for 11:47 and it will be ready by then”. 

Genuinely, I was more shocked than she was at the demon she unleashed because holy fkcn airball, I dissociated hard ash and remember trying to close my mouth. 

I walked away, she sat in her car, and as the heavens would have it, one of our regular officers came by that I was friends with. So I struck up a conversation with him and intentionally and casually kept looking over at the ladys car, watching her face fill with shame as she slumped back into her seat trying to not be seen. 

Her order was brought out at 11:45, and she sped away SO FAST. Its been a week and Im not fired, she hasnt left a bad review nor come back.

1m12xs0,https://www.reddit.com/r/livingfromtheend/comments/1m12xs0/how_does_frequency_affect_your_reality/,How Does Frequency Affect Your Reality?,"When we talk about frequency, think of it like a radio. Imagine you have a **radio station** in your mind and body, and this station is constantly broadcasting a signal. The energy or emotional state you are in is what determines the **frequency** of this signal.

Now, think about radio stations. Each station is broadcasting a different type of music or content, but you can only hear the one that your radio is tuned to. The same thing happens with your life. There are infinite possibilities for what you can experience, but you will only **experience the things that match your frequency**.

Your thoughts, feelings, beliefs, and attitudes are the dials that tune your frequency. And just like a radio station can change with a turn of the dial, **you can change your frequency** too. If you’re tuned to a frequency of **lack, fear, or frustration**, you’ll experience those things in your life. But if you shift your frequency to **love, abundance, and joy**, your life will start reflecting those experiences.

So, **frequency** is about the energy that you’re putting out into the world. And it’s a law of the universe that says: **like attracts like.** Whatever energy you send out into the world, you will attract back.

  
Now that we understand what frequency is and how it works, let’s talk about **why it matters** and how it affects your everyday life.

Every single thing in your life, whether it’s a relationship, a job, money, health, or opportunities—is a reflection of your frequency. Your life is like a mirror that shows back to you exactly what you are putting out into the universe.

# When You're on a Low Frequency

Imagine you wake up in the morning already feeling frustrated. Maybe you didn’t sleep well, maybe there’s stress at work, or maybe you just don’t feel great. You start your day feeling heavy and negative. Your thoughts might be filled with worry or self-doubt.

Now, because your frequency is low, the universe starts matching that energy. You might get stuck in traffic, you might spill your coffee, you might have an argument with a friend, or something else might go wrong. It's like you’re attracting more **frustration, stress, and negativity** because that’s the energy you’re radiating.

But here’s the good news: You can change this! Just like you can turn the dial on a radio to a different station, you can **shift your frequency** by changing the way you feel and think.

# When You're on a High Frequency

Now, imagine that you wake up feeling calm, grateful, and excited for the day. Maybe you take a few deep breaths, smile, and think about something you’re thankful for. When you start your day with a positive emotional state, your frequency is much higher.

Now, the universe starts matching that higher energy. Maybe you receive a compliment, maybe you find a solution to a problem, or maybe you get an unexpected opportunity that lights you up. The universe reflects back to you the **positive, high-energy vibe** you’re putting out.

It’s not magic, it’s **the law of attraction**. When you tune your frequency to match the energy you want to experience, your reality will start to shift in that direction.

# Emotions Are Frequency in Motion

This is one of the most important things to understand about frequency. Your **emotions** are how you experience your frequency. Emotions are energy in motion, **they’re the physical sensations that reflect the energy you are vibrating at**.

When you feel joy, love, and peace, your body vibrates at a higher frequency. You feel light, open, and positive. These are high-frequency emotions.

On the other hand, when you feel fear, guilt, shame, anger, or sadness, your body vibrates at a lower frequency. You feel heavy, stuck, or negative. These are low-frequency emotions.

It’s important to know that you will experience **both high and low emotions** as part of being human. But it’s the **dominant emotion** or frequency you experience most often that shapes your reality. If you’re constantly feeling **angry or worried**, you’re sending out a low-frequency signal. But if you can shift to feeling **grateful, excited, or peaceful**, you’re tuning into a higher frequency, and your life will start to reflect that.

  
Why Frequency Is So Important in Manifestation

The reason why **frequency** is so important in manifestation is because **you don’t manifest what you want, you manifest what you are**.

Manifestation isn’t just about saying affirmations or having a vision board. It’s about **becoming the energy of what you desire**. You have to align your frequency with the things you want to bring into your life.

If you want love, you need to tune into **self-love** and **abundance in relationships**. If you want financial abundance, you need to tune into **worthiness and abundance**. The universe responds to your **vibration,** the energy you are giving off.",1,1752638623.0,livingfromtheend,0,1.0,False

I (23F) am getting married in January and just found out my fiancée, Mark (25M, fake name) invited his old situationship to our wedding without consulting me.

For context: Me and Mark met on a dating app two years ago after he “”broke up”” a relationship. To be honest, it’s quite confusing what he and Tracy (22F) had.

They met because of a mutual friend and started to develop feelings for each other. Mark told me they never dated and slept together, but it was more than friendship. Until today he keeps her love letters, gifts and talks about her.

Tracy and him tried to stay in contact after the break up, staying friends but she ghosted him after finding out we started to date. From what I saw in her social media, she’s in a relationship, so I’m not worried about her trying to get with my fiancée again.

They haven’t been in contact for 2 years, but he still has her number and email. I found out about him inviting her after I checked again our guest list and finding her name.

I know Tracy is not a threat to our relationship, but Mark inviting her behind my back makes me feel bad about our whole wedding. He told me he doesn’t feel anything for her, yet he made sure to send her an invitation.

This is probably me being insecure, but my fear of him not getting over her is slowly creeping inside my heart.

I don’t want to lose him.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** He's probably not over her, especially since they were never a thing. For him, she might be the one that got away. If I were OP, I would have a very serious talk with him.

> **OOP:** I don’t get why he is not over her especially if they were never a thing. From what Mark told me, he was the one who didn’t wanted a relationship since Tracy “just started life”.

**Commenter 2:** He went behind you back to invite someone whose love letters he’s kept?? The fact he didn’t talk to you about it is a 🚩. If having her there is more important to him than you being comfortable at your own wedding then you might need to postpone the wedding. She might not be a threat to your relationship but it sounds like your fiancé’s feelings are a threat.

> **OOP:** I don’t know why he is not over her even after two years of no contact. I know Tracy is part of his past, his story but it’s been such a long time.

**Commenter 3:** tell him you don't want her there and that's final and HE better rescind it or you'll have to rethink the marriage because starting a married life by going behind your back is a no-no. Tbh you need to not stubbornly hold on to someone you can't trust, and you can't trust someone who does shit behind your back.

> **OOP:** Her going to the wedding doesn’t make me uncomfortable since I know she won’t do anything. The problem is my fiancée and the fact he invited her to the wedding without notifying me.
> 
> If Mark wanted her there, fine. But I just HATE the fact he didn’t told me beforehand and it’s making me think he lied about getting over her.

**Commenter 4:** Why do you keep saying I know she won't do anything? If you can't trust him not to do anything with an old fling you should not be getting married.

> **OOP:** Tracy has a boyfriend and is expecting. Also, she was the one who blocked him everywhere after finding out we were dating.

[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/GtdkDgcc9v): **October 19, 2024 (two days later)**

After reading the comments and talking with some friends, my heart finally understood Mark never really got over Tracy.

In the beginning, I was in denial, but I went out with Tom (24M), his best friend of years to understand about what really happened between them.

From what he told me, Tracy and Mark met because of some friends in common. She just got into the university and was 17 at the time, while Mark was already almost graduating.

They stayed friend for two years and feelings started to blossom. Mark was already working while she was still in college, he only wanted to formally date her after her graduation, so it was never a thing, even though they shared love letters, gifts and shared almost every holiday together.

Tom told me everyone from their old friend group thought they would marry since they were so sweet together. So, their breakup was really unpredictable.

Tracy was the one who broke up with Mark due to their religious values not lining up, as she wanted to save herself until marriage. In the end, they decided it was better to go separate ways and maybe try again after a few years.

But after me and Mark started to date, Tracy realized that it was pointless to wait for him and started to see other people too, so she blocked in every thing, except email just to have a clean beginning.

In the end, I finally realized Mark is just hopeful that Tracy would come back to him due to their talks of trying again after a while. It honestly hurt so much, as I loved him so much.

I still didn’t confronted him since I’m still shaken up, but I don’t know if this marriage will happen. I am going to update once I calm down and confront him.

**Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** This sucks but at least you found out before you ended up married to this guy.

**Commenter 2:** I’m sorry OP. It does sound as though your fiancé hasn’t moved on.

You deserve someone who can’t breathe without you, and I hope you can find it with your next partner.

**Commenter 3:** I’d write down all your feelings and thoughts in a letter to him. Explain what Tom said to you. Tell him it aligns with him keeping the love letters, trying to stay in contact, and bringing her up even two years later while in a relationship with you. Tell him you love him enough to let him go.

I’d also reach out to Tracy and ask if your fiancé has been talking to her at all. You never know if there is more to the story, of if she has moved on from him.

From what you wrote, it doesn’t seem like he moved on from her. He shouldn’t be inviting someone he still has romantic feelings for to HIS wedding. That’s cruel to you (his future wife) and Tracy, as well. If I was her, I’d feel like he was trying to shove his relationship in my face. I’d be offended he even invited me….

Also, will this be his first time seeing her in two years? For some reason, I seriously doubt it.

However, if it is - that’s pretty diabolical. It’s like he is using your wedding and you as a prop in their love story. Does he think he’s the male lead in some K drama?

At the very least, give him the letter. If he wants to meet up- ask to see his phone. Go through his deleted messages and sent emails along with his trash folder. I think there’s more to the story. Were you supposed to walk down the aisle and just see Tracy there?

He’s honestly an AH…and a selfish one at that.

&nbsp;

[Update #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/YNp0fwpzUZ): **October 25, 2024 (six days later)**

It’s been a while since the last update and I’m here to announce the wedding has been called off. My parents are the one canceling everything for me, it’s like I returned to my childhood when mom and dad had to solve my problems.

I confronted Mark after talking with Tom and made him aware of everything I’ve been dealing. His reaction at the beginning was dismissive and was almost as if he was trying to escape from this situation.

In the end, Mark said he never loved someone like Tracy because it was pure and innocent. She reminded him that not everything is about carnal desire and in the darkest moments of his life, Tracy was like a sunlight.

Hearing the man you love admitting how much he loved another woman is so hurtful. During the talk, I started to cry, bawling my eyes out. Mark had the audacity to say he loves me, but it’s a different kind of love.

I asked why he invited her to our wedding and he was speechless. Why he had to throw away our future for something in the past?! This hurts so much.

Mark told me he knew Tracy didn’t blocked him on e-mail, since he was the one who helped her get her first job and a lot of professional stuff was also involved. This is how he was able to send her our wedding invitation, but he “meant no harm”.

When I asked what he meant with this, Mark just said he wanted to make her watch us together and realize what she lost because he was hurt that Tracy was pregnant and not married.

The moment Mark mentioned about Tracy’s pregnancy, a red alarm started to echo in my head. “How did you know about her pregnancy? You said she blocked you every where.” I could see panic in his eyes as he started to stutter.

In the end, I made him give me his phone and I found out more than 5 accounts to stalk Tracy. My stomach felt sick and the urge to vomit was overwhelming.

In the end, I decided to call off the engagement since he was a creep. Mark threw himself on the floor asking for forgiveness and he loves me, just in a different way compared to Tracy and was just hurt that she gave herself to another man while he begged her countless times for sex.

This made me feel even more disgusted with him because he felt entitled to her virginity and body. I left without taking even a bag with me. Everything is just too much. I can’t believe I spent two years loving a stalker, a manchild.

Oh, I also told Tracy everything and his accounts. I don’t know if she saw my messages, but I hope she does. The jealousy I once felt for her transformed into pity as no woman should go through what Mark has done.

Mark wants to meet up with me and doesn’t want to break up, but I’m just so tired.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** I am so sorry. This really sucks. You should have your parents get your stuff and you should stay as far away from Mark as you can. If he is capable of stalking Tracy, he is capable of stalking you. Make sure that there are security cameras at your parents house and you should block him. The only bright side is that you found this out before you married him.

> **OOP:** Im thinking about leaving the US and going to another country. Social media are not for me, so it’s harder for him to stalk me.
> 
> I don’t have anything of great value in Marks house, except some clothes and makeup, so idc if he throws it away

**OOP on Tracy’s ethnicity and her own**

> **OOP:** Tracy is Asian while I’m white

&nsbp;

[Update #3](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/2fy7oX9lWU): **October 26, 2024 (next day)**

I think this is my last update, since I’ve already met up with Tracy and talked about what happened.

Me and her met at a cafe and in the beginning I was really nervous, as I didn’t know what was her reaction because her reply was only “Hi, let’s talk over a cup of coffee:)”

When I was waiting for her, I could feel my back sweating and overall, lots of emotion. Tracy arrived and I finally understood why Mark was so obsessed with her as she is definitely one of the most beautiful women I saw. She’s pretty on the pictures, but personally she looks better.

Tracy said hello to me and asked if I’m willing to go to her house to talk, since being outside for too long makes her really tired. We ordered some coffee to go and it was super awkward.

So now let’s talk about what she told me: first of all, she apologized for being the reason why now I’m single which I assured her is not her fault.

Tracy said she received the invitation, but was simply not interested in participating in our wedding as she was already in a happy relationship and is pointless to see a person from the past.

With the story Tom and Mark told me, I got curious and asked about them “staying friends” as it sounded like she wanted to stay with him after the break up and it’s the polar opposite of her behavior. Tracy was extremely uncomfortable with this question, but still explained to me why she said that.

In the beginning, she was really in love with Mark because he was her first love. She described him as a protector, someone trustworthy, handsome and kind as he always showered her in gifts and travels.

Everything was fine and sweet but over time, Mark started to beg her for sex so much to the point of her pretending to be sick just to avoid him. She just didn’t wanted to sleep with him and had some sort of blockage, like a sixth sense telling her to not do this.

She was sick and tired about all of this and used the fact that her parents are extremely religious to justify why sex was off the chart. This lead to a fight, which Mark never told me and them breaking up.

But two weeks after, they started to talk again as she felt in debt with him as he helped her get a job in a prestigious company and he spent a lot of money on her with trips, foods and presents. One of the gifts was a Rolex for her 18th birthday, which made me mad since he NEVER spent so much money on me.

So when Tracy found out me and Mark was seeing each other, she felt relieved and finally had a proper reason to block him everywhere since he was still sometimes hinting about them sleeping together.

In the end, I told her in the entire relationship, Mark would sometimes talk about her and in the beginning it was kind of weird, but I just brushed it off since she was part of his story.

Oh, I also talked about Mark’s numerous accounts and in the beginning she didn’t believed me. But I showed her the accounts I knew, which was creepy since they all had female names, followers and pictures. All of them looked real.

Her account is public, so I asked Tracy to make it private. She made a new account with her Korean name and deactivated the old one.

We had fun and became friends. She is a really sweet person and I saw how her boyfriend treated her like a queen. I’m happy she found love and got rid of Mark.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Sounds like everyone dodged the bullet that was Mark…

> **OOP:** It wasn’t a bullet. It was a nuclear bomb

**Commenter 2:** I really hope she takes marks stalking seriously. It's very alarming the stuff he has been doing. I'm genuinely afraid for this woman. He's become obsessive and that can't lead to anything good. Especially if he starts spiraling after your breakup.

**Commenter 3:** I’m so glad you told her. Pregnant women with crazy stalkers get killed at an alarming rate.

I can’t imagine how awkward and awful and difficult that whole situation and conversation must have been for you. I’m really proud of you for talking to her and showing her all their accounts so she could protect herself and have all the information. Now, at least whatever else she chooses to do and whatever else happens, you know you’ve done what you could to protect another vulnerable woman. That speaks huge volumes to character and personality and general grace/class overall.

You are going to find someone amazing who truly loves you and matches that upbeat, dignified and character driven vibe you have to the best benefit. :-) I just know it.

I hope you post an update on three years madly in love and hugely successful. ;-)

#----NEW UPDATE----

[Update #4](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/i2ZzgFsju1): **July 9, 2025 (8.5 months later)**

Hi, guys! Recently, I logged into my account again and decided to give an update about my life as it is so crazy for me that almost a year ago, my tears were uncontrollable because of a man.

Tracy got married a few weeks ago and I was invited. It was a beautiful ceremony and her baby was part of it. It was refreshing to see the glow on her face and that she found the one. We’re not too close, but still is nice to hang out with her and accompany her journey as a wife and mother.

Meanwhile, I am not interested in relationships for a while. I got a promotion and thinking about moving to another state as my company offered a position with better pay. Not being engaged actually made me concentrate a lot more on my job as I became able to do more extra hours.

So, I don’t have much updates about Mark since I cut off contact with him, his family and friends that took his side. The last thing I heard is that he was telling every one how controlling and abusive I was and HE had to call off our engagement.

This is not my business anymore and what he says doesn’t matter. But Mark is definitely miserable. I am going to take this summer and go to Greece just to celebrate life.

Thank you all for the advices. If I didn’t posted on Reddit almost a year ago, I would’ve been married to a guy who never saw me as first option.

1m12wjd,https://www.reddit.com/r/mpcusers/comments/1m12wjd/gem_for_mpc_noobs/,💎GEM💎 For MPC Noobs,"Plugin Melodies to Audio Tracks Melodies:

If you don't know already, this process should be done on every beat you create. Now, it's been a while since i've been on version 2, but the process is very similar to the process on version 3. This is what you're supposed to do, so make a habit of it, and it will save you space on your ram memory, so every project you create won't overload. 


First off, after you've created your basic loop of sounds and drums, go to the menu, and hit the button that says ""project"" it's at the bottom between browser and preferences. Click the purge button and purge unused samples. Then go to save and save as a new project, and whatever the beat name is, add ""audio mix"" to the end of that and save that new copy. Just incase you have a failure to load, you'll have the extra to fall back on.


Now,
Do this individually per plug-in in use... 

Solo each plug-in instrument, one at a time, and turn it up as loud as it can go without the sound becoming distorted or the audio peaks going over 0 on the mix meter. Then, on the main screen, click the new track button and create an audio track for each plug-in track that you have and set the level meters of those audio tracks to around -6dB. Start at plug in one and click on the arrangement tab (if on version 3) of that plug in and click the pencil tool next to it and hit bounce to sample. Do this for each plug-in instrument before you do anything else. After you have all your plugins bounced to sample, mute all of your plugin tracks. 

Save the project. 

Then your next thing is to go back to your menu and then the project button, and you will see all of your samples that you just bounced on the right side. 
Now, this is a version 3 tip. So if you have version 2 disregard this part, but what you want to do next is long press every sample and click ""stream from disk"" that way it will the samples will stream from the hard drive and not from the ram memory of the project.

Save the project.

Side note:
This is also a great tip if you ever create your own drumpad bank in version 3. Let's say you open a empty project and you want to create a drum bank. Then you would go through the browser and find all the drums that you like. And since you have 18 pads times 8 banks, that's 128 samples available per drum bank, but you could choose any amount of samples that you want. As you're choosing the drums, instead of clicking the load button, you will  click the load to pool button. Then when you're done, go to the menu and press the project button and you'll see all the drum samples you just chose there on the side, and you would do the same process as previously stated and long click each sample and press stream to disk. After that, you go to pad editor and assign your drums to each pad bank however you like. Then go to the menu and then save, and on the second row, click drum program, then create a folder on your hard drive and name it something like drum pads or drum banks and then and name that bank whatever you like. Now you have your own custom drumkit.

You only have to do this one time for each drum bank that you create and this way, every time you load that drum bank on a new project, your drums will already be streaming from disk, and that will save you tons of memory.


Now that you have your plug-in melodies that you bounced to audio, go to the sample edit tab. First, what you want to do is hold the shift button, and at the bottom of the sample edit page, you want to press the button that says 
0 Snap, and let go of the shift button (this allows for the points to snap to the zero-crossing point). Then, at the top left, on the sample section, choose each newly bounced sample and move the start and end points to get rid of any dead space on your waveform, then at the bottom where it says, bpm, match it to whatever the bpm of your project is (which is on the main screen to the right of the sequence number.. and next to that, you will see a button that says gbl, which stands for global, and when you click on it, it will change to seq, which stands for sequence. You want to make sure that the bpm values for both global and sequence match). So if you left sample edit to change the bpm, go back to it and then click the process button at the bottom right, and it will automatically be on a tab that says function discard. What it will do is take points beyond the start and end points that you want to get rid of and delete them, and that's what you want to do, so click do it. After you've done that to every sample that you just bounced, then you're done.

Save the project. Are you seeing a pattern here. 

All there is to do now is to go to each newly created audio track and load the samples to them by double tapping on the empty region and clicking broswe samples and load one to each audio track. You should also make it a habit to go back to each plug in instrument and take the name of the instrument (i.e. Fabric) and the name of the patch (sound), and label the audio track with that information, along with the bpm of the project. 

Also, in the save menu, you can save any midi information (per plug-in) as well as  any parameters that you may have changed inside the actual instrument (in Track Edit) as a file in either your project folder or another folder you choose to create. So if you ever want to go back and make any changes then you'll always have that information. 

And for the last time... Save the project.

And that's it. I hope this helps everyone that sees this post. Because this is a true MPC GEM💎.

MANY MORE TO COME.

The part that hurts me the most is that, i just can't hate you, i can't blame you with rightneous reason, i can't just point my finger at you and yell how much you wreck my world; but instead, i still thinking of you, how is your day going, how is your shift as a barista going, i miss your latte art, the way you explain coffee process to me and the way you hand me a dirty chai or a flat white.

Advice needed please,"I have a job at minimum wage in retail (in my area it’s $15.49/hr). I started it the last week of June 30th. The commute is 3.9 miles by foot, and it takes me 70-80 minutes to get there. I’m really broke right now so uber or rideshare is reserved for weather emergencies. They give me a lot of hours, have said they’re schedule flexible to students (like myself), and create schedule on a three week cycle. My shifts are usually between 4-5.5 hours, and I’ve had only one 8hr shift scheduled.

I just got a second job at a coffee shop that’s 15 minutes away by foot, pays $16/hr, also schedules in a 3-week cycle and is also very flexible for students since it’s in a college town.

Right now, im trying to coordinate between both jobs with scheduling, but the manager from my second job has yet to provide me my training schedule, which is set to start July 28th. I planned to go to my retail job today and try and address my availability before the retail job schedule comes out, but without the schedule from my second job I don’t know how to block out my availability.

My alternative plan is to just quit the retail job, because I would have to quit it anyway when school started. I work at my school’s IT department, so when the semester starts it would be impossible to do IT and the coffee shop job and the retail job.

Any advice on how to move? Please forgive my lack of wisdom or intuition on this issue as I have never balanced two jobs before. I want to move as respectfully as possible while also doing what’s most reasonable. I would like to hold both jobs for the rest of the summer, but if that’s unrealistic I need to put in my notice on the retail job soon, with the appropriate speech prepared.

So, long story short, I've been seeing/talking to this guy for a couple weeks. We were very friendly when we first met, and have friends in common, but we didn't start talking until recent. So far, we've gone dancing twice, and grabbed coffee once (I suggested it).

Today we were supposed to get pizza and coffee (he planned it, a couple days ago), and basically this is what happened:

He texted me earlier saying that he had gone to the gym early so we can go out today, and so we texted throughout the afternoon until around 6, which is when he came to pick me up (opened the car door and whatnot). We went to grab pizza and laughed, it was a pretty good vibe and we laughed as usual. Then he said ""ready to go?"" and I assumed we were going to take a walk or something, but then he walked to his car and I noticed he was driving me home. I was confused because we had been together for like an hour. I asked him if he had plans after this, and he said that 'the boys' were hanging out at a bar near his house so he will be going there.

Admittedly, I kinda shut down. I felt disposable. I was very excited to see him and keep getting to know him, but it seems as if he had thought of our date (?) as like not that important. The drive back home was quiet. He did try to make more conversation but I just couldn't hold it because (if I'm being super honest) I was kinda holding back tears and I felt a little mad/embarrassed. When he dropped me off, he didn't open the car door (he usually does) and just said ""okay, bye OP"". So I just got out of the car and walked to my door, and he drove away. He then texted thanking me for going out and that he had a good time.

I honestly don't know if I'm overreacting, but I feel like it was disrespectful and I'm even hesitating to see him again (the second time we had planned to go dancing, he changed plans bc 'the boys' wanted to go too and we should all meet at his house). It feels as if he puts his guy friends as a priority, and I know I'm not his gf or anything, but what if this is how he is if we ever become serious?

Lastly, I like him a lot. He's very kind and nice when he's not talking to his friends, and our chat is very easy going. I'm a little scare to let myself like him a lot (and I already like him quite a bit) and then come second to his friends.

What should I do? Should I let it go?

I went out for groceries which I utterly loathe doing without her.  And a big shop too, with a cart and everything.  Big shops are a two person job.  Fuck me.  I refer to these as social experiments, as in, it’s me on my own experimenting with being out in the wilderness, out amongst the public and how much of my sanity the endeavor will cost me.  

I am afraid to be out there without her.  The little shakes become more noticeable.  On this particular occasion I, and the checkout girl, both discovered that my communication and observational skills have devolved to a point where I felt the need to stutter out to her “I’m sorry.  I didn’t mean to sound mean.”  I couldn’t find two items I was looking forward to and I was already feeling like a defeated sad hobo clown after having searched for them for about 2 minutes a piece.  That’s a long time without her.  Those beautiful piercing blue eagle eyes of hers would’ve known exactly where to look.  She knew where everything in that store was.  I was not the brains of the two person team.  My skillset is more suited for take off shelf and carry.  More than once I contemplated abandoning the cart. If my wife were at home waiting for me this all would’ve been comical. 

I bag the shit in the parking lot and dip.  It’s still hot as hell out and my meats are sweating already.  I look at the clock in the dash.  It’s 9pm now.  It’s like magic, always somehow it’s 9pm again and soon it will be 3am.  I prefer to grocery shop late, I prefer to do everything late.  There’s less animals in the wilderness at night.  On the drive home, coming around to my complex, there’s a young couple walking their little doggy.  The guy nudges the girl with his elbow like he just made a joke.  The brief sight I had of it cut me deep.  

I park her car next to mine.  Her car is my car now.  Mine is a piece of shit and I only still have it because I still like having them parked together.  I touch her hat that sits on the passenger seat,  “I accidentally spent too much babe”.  I haul all the groceries up alone.  I’m still a one trip pack mule, even though I’ve wasted away close to twenty pounds down into sickly territory.  I’m back home, our home.  She owned it.  She let me move in way back in the earlier days when my apartment exploded.  I was over here when it blew up.  I own it now.  My house where I never feel quite at home anymore. I got a good deal on it from her estate.  The thought of now cooking dinner alone, doing the dishes alone, and then putting away the dishes alone at this time of night cuts me deep.  Instead I make a hot dog and a coffee for one and sit down on the couch alone to put on an episode of whatever recorded on the DVR and pay attention to none of it. I’ll probably crash out on the couch again tonight.  It’ll probably be around 3am as it always magically is.

This social experiment’s results are inconclusive, there is conflicting data.  But I won’t have to do another big shop for a hot minute.  I just hope that young couple are as happy and in love as they were in that moment, forever, together.  And that if anything, that they will remain blissfully unaware of the dark lonely wilderness hiding on the underside of that and the people who are stuck there.

Sorry for a long read.  I wanted to recount a part of my day to day merely for catharsis and killing time.  I’m waiting on the moon to tell me it’s been 11 months since she’s been gone.  I’m expecting the word around 3am EST.",4,1752637822.0,widowers,3,1.0,False

Sore throat, mild fever, body aches—nothing she hadn’t pushed through before. She typed *general physician near me* more out of habit than urgency but ended up brushing it off.

Her energy was gone, and her mind spiraled with “What if it’s something worse?”

Case File 12-0001 

I'm Officer 121, and these are my unofficial files. 

 

 

Be advised, names and locations have been changed or redacted. 

 You'll be able to listen to the full reports on Spotify. Just don't listen in the dark. 

Case file 12-001.  

Subject: Thomas Tommy Cartwright.  

 Age: 9.  

Location: Bear Creek Trail. 

Filed by: Officer 121 

Date recorded: Redacted.  

The Bear Creek Trail disappearance... This case never made it past the first tier. 

No blood, no body. Unfortunately, this is the kind of file that gets quietly shelved because there's “nowhere to go.” But I kept my copy, because something's wrong here, and somebody needs to remember. 

Tommy goes missing.  

Thomas Cartwright goes by Tommy, age 9. Went missing on October 3rd, just after 4 30 p.m. His mother Lacey reported that he'd been walking about 10 feet in front of her on Bear Creek Trail. Not far, just far enough to be out of arm's reach. 

She said he rounded the bend in the path and then never came back into view.  She ran ahead, screamed his name. Silence. 

Not even the leaves were moving. When search and rescue got there, we'd assumed to be a fast recovery. He was 9. We had a short response time. 

 The trail has loops, but the forest isn't too dense. We had dogs on scene before nightfall.  I suppose this is the part that bothers me. 

The scent dogs picked up Tommy's trail about 50 yards from the bend where Lacey last saw him, and then they lost it at approximately 200 yards.  At the scene there was no blood, no drag marks, no signs of a scuffle. Just nothing. Not even a damn candy bar wrapper.  

It was like the trail ended mid-step. We tried to chalk it up to wind conditions or contaminated soil, but the dogs didn't act confused.They acted scared. One laid down in the middle of the path and refused to move.  Whined. Shook. I've seen dogs break off trails, but I've never seen one give up. Not like that. 

The Witness.  

Two days later we get a tip from a nearby camper. A little girl, maybe 7, was staying with her grandparents just off the ridge. 

Around the time that Tommy disappeared, the little girl didn't hear a boy scream. She didn't see anyone run. What she did see made my blood run cold. 

 She said what she saw was something crawling through the trees around that time. She said it was long. She said it didn't walk right. 

She called it a somebody.  

Not a thing.  

Not a monster.   

Not a man.  

A somebody.  

She told her grandmother that she thought someone had followed her home. 

Follow-up.  

We did a courtesy check. Didn't write it up. 

Just wanted peace of mind. The girl's house sat about half a mile down the hill. It was an old structure with a wide yard backed up to the forest. 

She hadn't slept in her own bed since the night Tommy went missing. She claimed that her closet door kept creaking open even when latched. Now personally, I think kids have a sixth sense about this stuff. 

But also, in my rational mind, I know kids get scared. Especially a seven-year-old girl who was just questioned about a missing boy.  A missing boy who got lost in the woods not far from her campground. 

The little girl said that she heard someone breathing under her floorboards. Not something. Someone. 

I did a sweep myself. The floor sounded solid. The closet latch sticks a little, but nothing out of the ordinary. 

 Still, there was something that bothered me. I didn't like how cold that back room was and I didn't like the way her dog would go near it. 

No evidence. No resources.   

By day 10, the state pulled back. 

Local units scaled down, and Tommy's mom stopped giving interviews. We never found a footprint past the 200-yard mark. Not his shoes. Not a scrap of his jacket. The only thing we had was a girl too young to lie that well and too scared to sleep through the night.  

It's the kind of fear you don't fake. The kind that doesn't go away when adults say it's over. I suppose that's why I shouldn't have been surprised when the desk sergeant said I had someone there to see me. I half expected to see Lacey. 

But instead, a four-foot-nothing little girl was ushered into my office. She sat down in the chair across from my desk and looked me dead in the eye. “Detective, are there any updates?” She said. She was very matter of fact.  I promised her at shift end that I would take another trip down the trails.  

From the moment I parked my jeep at the trailhead, I had come to fully regret my decision. I knew you were supposed to hike with a buddy. 

Even our tourists knew you were supposed to hike with a buddy. But I told myself I had to press on. I made a promise to a very scared little girl who needed answers. 

I made the decision to walk the same path Tommy had, up until the point where the dogs had lost the scent. I needed to see if there was anything left behind. Something that I must have missed. 

Something was off. But I couldn't quite put my finger on it. That was until I rounded the bend where she had lost sight of Tommy. 

It was the absence of sound. There was no breeze in the trees. No birds chirping. 

No squirrels running around on the ground. No insect sounds. The only sound was the sound of my boots crunching on the path. 

It was unsettling, to say the least. But I kept going. By the time I made it to where the dogs had lost Tommy's scent, every hair on the back of my neck was at attention. 

There was a cold sweat trickling down my back. This felt like an anxiety attack. And I didn't have a reason why. I was in the woods. There's no reason to feel like I was being watched. 

But I did. 

 I forced myself to take a series of deep breaths. Finally, my heart rates started to come down. Just as I felt myself start to steady, I heard a twig snap.  My head shot up, and my eyes locked on to whatever made the sound.  

I watched a head bob back behind a tree. 

I'm not proud, but I stood frozen. It was in that moment that realization hit me.  

The head that popped out from behind the tree was not of average height. 

Whatever it was, had to be eight or ten feet tall. I tried to stand my ground. I announced myself as an officer...but when its head popped out several trees closer, I ran.  

And I didn't look back.  Because whatever it was, it wasn't human. And its eyes were locked on me.  

Final Entry 

I don't think I slept that night, or several nights after that incident. 

I regularly checked in on the little girl. But apparently whatever had been bothering her, had stopped.  

I think that's because it had started following me.... 

 

 This isn't a closed case. It's not a solved case. It's just gone. 

Quiet.   

 

Whatever was on the trail with Tommy, it didn't leave tracks.... 

 

Until the next file drop. Remember to lock your doors and don't follow the noise in the woods. ",1,1752637695.0,u_OFC121,0,1.0,False

So, long story short, I've been seeing/talking to this guy for a couple weeks. We were very friendly when we first met, and have friends in common, but we didn't start talking until recent. So far, we've gone dancing twice, and grabbed coffee once (I suggested it). 

Today we were supposed to get pizza and coffee (he planned it, a couple days ago), and basically this is what happened:

He texted me earlier saying that he had gone to the gym early so we can go out today, and so we texted throughout the afternoon until around 6, which is when he came to pick me up (opened the car door and whatnot). We went to grab pizza and laughed, it was a pretty good vibe and we laughed as usual. Then he said ""ready to go?"" and I assumed we were going to take a walk or something, but then he walked to his car and I noticed he was driving me home. I was confused because we had been together for like an hour. I asked him if he had plans after this, and he said that 'the boys' were hanging out at a bar near his house so he will be going there. 

Admittedly, I kinda shut down. I felt disposable. I was very excited to see him and keep getting to know him, but it seems as if he had thought of our date (?) as like not that important. The drive back home was quiet. He did try to make more conversation but I just couldn't hold it because (if I'm being super honest) I was kinda holding back tears and I felt a little mad/embarrassed. When he dropped me off, he didn't open the car door (he usually does) and just said ""okay, bye OP"". So I just got out of the car and walked to my door, and he drove away. He then texted thanking me for going out and that he had a good time.

I honestly don't know if I'm overreacting, but I feel like it was disrespectful and I'm even hesitating to see him again (the second time we had planned to go dancing, he changed plans bc 'the boys' wanted to go too and we should all meet at his house). It feels as if he puts his guy friends as a priority, and I know I'm not his gf or anything, but what if this is how he is if we ever become serious?

Lastly, I like him a lot. He's very kind and nice when he's not talking to his friends, and our chat is very easy going. I'm a little scare to let myself like him a lot (and I already like him quite a bit) and then come second to his friends.

What should I do? Am I overreacting and should I let it go?

Another time I went to my board game group at a coffee shop. I am the first one there. Room is otherwise empty.  A woman arrives second, sits at a different table, and says nothing to me.  We had known eachother for years.  I was normally the one to greet her.  When a third person arrives, she greets them warmly.

Is this a valid test to see if somebody is actually friendly?  Am I overthinking it?",15,1752637145.0,socialskills,14,0.95,False
1m12f2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1m12f2a/my_dad_is_an_asshole_and_mom_plays_innocent/,"My dad is an asshole, and mom plays innocent","For added context | My sister and parents had a big falling out, she accused my parents of a lot of things, some true, some not- it's also mixed in with, she has a lot of mental health struggles.

Although my sister is a bit harsh sometimes, my parents don't admit or see anything they've done wrong in our childhood. 

She completely went no contact, and for three years all I hear is, she's awful, she's abusive, and how difficult it is for my mother ""losing a child"".

My mom makes constant posts about this stuff, as if she's actually had a child pass away, it's annoying. 

Anyways, they tried to connect again- only for my sibling to get pissed and cut them off completely again.

I don't know what happened in their discussions, but I sense my mom was overbearing, as she can be with me.

As in, constantly texting, sending voice messages- she gets ""insecure"" and almost lies about her true feelings with big, emotional text dumping like ""I'm not mad, I promise, I understand you completely"".

To me though, my sister is my sister- our relationship was rough and still isn't the greatest, but we talked after all this chaos and found closeness. 

I'm getting married next year and wanted to invite her, she said she was willing to go and be respectful with my parents around.

I wanted my parents to come as well, even though I don't know how I feel about them, sometimes I think I want to cut them off as well, but then I think no- they're my parents, I'm always...trying with them.

They're such assholes at times though, and my fiance is very against them and would drop them in seconds, but I feel like I can't.

We went out for coffee yesterday and it was really nice, until my dad just ruined it.

They haven't really seemed to care about my wedding, they also don't like my fiance, nonetheless- I'm trying to keep it together. 

The topic of the wedding came up and I expressed my excitement, and here's what went down:

DAD: oh by the way, if she comes to the wedding we will not be going.

I was very close to crying because he said it so bluntly, and it felt so hurtful.

I understand they have their issues, but can they not put aside things for me on one day?

My parents are also crazy and like- convinced my sister is going to hurt them...which she wouldn't.

I've met up with her and she's so shy and just struggling. 

My parents act like she's crazy and out to get them for revenge, which is insane to me.

They basically said they wouldn't go to the wedding for safety reasons- and legal reasons.

Legal being my sister made false accusations about them.

I was hurt though that they'd refuse to go, and like no- obviously she's not going to jump them.

I told my dad ""this is going to be the only wedding I'm ever going to have.""

Which led to my dad's ""joke"" which he's made multiple times before ""well, you never know!"".

How is that even a joke.

One time I expressed how I love my fiance, and I'm lucky not to ever experience breaking up or heartbreak (he's my first everything).

My dad also gave me the ""well you never know!""

Which maybe is ""technically"" true, but I feel fairly certain, otherwise I wouldn't be marrying my fiance.

Nonetheless it's not a joke.

Also, it's just subtly true, cus they don't like my fiance.

My fiance has called them out multiple times and just despises them

And my parents don't like being called out, supposedly. 

Hense their feelings on my sister.

My mom playing innocent though?

She texted me this idea previously, about not coming to the wedding for their ""safety"".

And I'm so sure she shit-talks me and gossips behind my back all the time.

But, when my dad made this comment? She immediately was like ""don't be so harsh, honey.""

To my dad, and taking my side- as if she wasn't bringing these ideas up previously. 

My parents have a weird team dynamic where my mom is always innocent and my dad takes pride in being the asshole.

When my fiance called them out, he said my mom was rude- my dad defended her by saying ""she's a Saint, I'm the asshole, you should be mad at me"".

Which is so crazy to me.

My mom played innocent a different time as well, I can tell, it's very subtle and I never catch it in the moment, because she's so sweet and nice to me (until whenever she explodes again).

Me and my parents agreed to go to the local Starbucks, they picked me up to drive us there, a quick drive.

My dad, without asking or talking to me, decided to run an errand and also instead take us to a different coffee place further out.

This was an annoying moment because I expressed my lack of time consistently. 

We were just driving, and I only noticed because we'd been driving a while- I called it out, and my dad's response? 

""I didn't feel the need to tell you, I don't see he it changes anything in the plans.""

And obviously this was pre-discussed with my mom, because she didn't stop him.

She didn't even seem surprised, but when I said ""hey, wait-""

She pulled the innocence out and said ""well, things change, it's okay.""

I was so annoyed, my dad didn't apologize and my mom told me you have to move on and forgive.

Anyways, this ramble is so long.

I don't know what to do.

I keep giving them chances, I don't even know if they're absolutely terrible people, I can't rationalize it.

I can never give myself a good enough excuse to say ""no more.""

After my dad made his joke about ""well, you never know!""

I told my mom it was hurtful later that day, through text.

She told me my dad was just joking, it's just sarcasm, and her and my dad always make these jokes together about their own divorce happening.

Just dismissing my annoyance, basically. 

Then, after defending my dad, said she didn't wanna mediate, fair enough.

He tried to call me, but I didn't pick up, because I didn't want to deal with ""it's just a joke, sarcasm, not serious"".

Who the hell makes those jokes constantly, especially before a wedding?

This is probably where most people get the errors. 

I’m a network engineer and thought I’d give a run down on when this occurs so you can plan for the next one. 

1. Same home - this is simplest. If you are on the same home network, you’ll have the same IP across multiple devices. Once a purchase is done you’ll probably be blocked. 

2. You’re at work. If a coworker makes a purchase you’ll be blocked. Some workplaces consolidate all traffic to one egress point so it’s possible someone from another location/office will be competing with you. 

3. On cellular, most carriers will utilize something called Carrier-Grade NAT. If you happen to get NATed to the same IP as someone who has purchased, you’ll be blocked. Even Starlink uses some form of CGNAT. 

4. At a hotel/conference/coffee shop/etc. if someone on the same network buys something, you’ll be blocked. 

5. Shared VPNs. You’ll be blocked if someone that uses the same service and server makes a purchase. 

6. Your network is shared in a condo building. You’re now competing with everyone in your condo. 

So how do you ensure your IP is unique? Check your home network to see if your router has a public IP. Most homes will have this unless you live in a big city. If it’s a private IP, then you may be SOL. If you really want to spend money, you can get a dedicated IP from your ISP or get Fixed IP VPN which will give you a dedicated IP. I may have missed a few other scenarios but these should give you an idea why you got the error this time around. ",4,1752636802.0,PokemonTCG,1,0.75,False
1m12cgg,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m12cgg/folded_bear_part_one/,Folded Bear Part One,"My Hummer bounced across the rural road like an excited child, my hands glued to the wheel as if it would soothe my nerves. I was still trying to recover from this week, and from how the trip started. I had to focus on something else. This trip wasn’t so bad. It was Dirk and Sons mandated, so maybe it wasn’t a completely willing vacation, but it was only for a week or so, and it counted as paid leave. It’s like what my therapist said, I had to look at the bright side every once in a while. Sure, if I had a choice in the matter, I might be a little bit more positive, but I can’t change fate like that.

The shrill sound of a phone call interrupted my spiralling. Thankfully, it wasn’t anyone from work, if it was, I would…nevermind. It was Hunter. I really needed someone to talk to, so I was just happy to hear another voice on the road. It came through with the tinny sound of my phone on speaker.

	“Yooo Matt, what's going on my man?”

I took a short, but deep breath in.

	“Nothing much, Hunter, nothing much.”
There was a tiny little moment of silence, which felt like an eternity to me. I hoped it was just the awful phone reception.

	“Cool, cool…Matt, be honest, are you… alright?”

I looked at the chorus of canopies that began to swallow the skies above me. I wouldn’t let it take me.

	“Sorry, these roads are absolutely terrible, I’m just a bit shaken.”

	“That sucks man, I hope the roads clear. Where are you going again?”

I took the next turn, mulling over my options.

	“Corporate…they thought I deserved some time out of the office, right? So they’re sending me out to this cabin, I think it's by that huge oak forest.”

Hunter hummed a low tone, my phone rendering it almost incomprehensible.

	“Oh, it’s by that summer camp, right? I’m sending Tom over there tomorrow. He’s so pumped for it.”

Hunter continued talking, at least he tried to. Whatever he tried to say was turned into a shrill song of stammering and sputtering. The forest had made its verdict clear. It smothered all remnants of the outside world, like it wanted me all to itself.

	“Sorry Hunter, we’re breaking up here, can I call you back tomorrow?”

I could only imagine how I sounded to him at that moment. Thankfully, the dropped call seemed to say that he got the message. As the last leftovers of the call sputtered out, I saw what sat before me. A wooden cabin, stuck within the centre of the forest, slowly getting swallowed by it. My home away from home. My home that isn’t home. 

I left my Hummer at the crust of the road, its eccentricities giving it a strange form of camouflage. It almost fit in, with its green shell, its rusted pieces, its mud stricken wheels, its freshly dented bumper. I took what little luggage I had and fled to the cabin, hoping it had something to comfort me from the outside world.

It sat in the clearing like a parasite. It was wooden, with thin layers like the scales of a serpent, yet it wasn’t oak like trees that surrounded it. It was a darker wood, as if to show it didn’t belong. The roof, a barnhouse red, only adding to that feeling. I went to the door, its dulled brass doorknob feeling loose in my hands. I pushed through. 

The first thing that hit me was the musty air that had been trapped in there. Its interior felt like it was lifted from another time, a piece of history untouched by the outside world. The appliances were old, possibly functional. The colours, maybe vibrant once, were now muted. The furniture could perhaps be described as ‘well loved’ if you were generous. 

I dumped my things on the living room floor. I felt sick. I needed coffee. Yeah, thats it. I was just in a bit of a rut, and I needed a pick me up. I stumbled to the kitchen. They had a kettle, at least. It was a metal one, completely unpainted, and shaped roughly, as if it was a picture drawn from memory. I turned the tap on, the hope of a good cup of coffee vanishing as the brown water sputtered from the faucet. 

Before the kettle was even halfway full, my hairs on my back started to stand up. It was a knock. I stood completely still, the only sound left in the cabin being the running faucet. 
A second knock.
It wasn’t in the door, it sounded too far away. Maybe it was the window? 
I turned the tap off, my hopes for coffee abandoned. I was in the middle of nowhere, what could be hitting my window? 
I crept to the window, thick curtains shielding the glass from my eyes. My hands touched the fabric. It felt grimy to the touch. I jolted back, instinctively glancing at my hand. My fingertips were left with a thick layer of dust. This place was disgusting. Was this all a joke? I was about to be fired, and my consolation prize was a trip to a gross, dusty shack? 
A third knock.
My heart dropped. It sounded like it was on the other side of the window. I wasn’t touching those curtains again, maybe I could see whatever it was from the door? 
I took a step to the door.
It was probably a branch, right?
Another step.
And if it isn’t?
My hand reached out to the doorknob.


I creaked the door open a sliver. 

It was nothing.
Nothing by the window, no tracks, nothing. I peered at the surrounding woods. It was still. Perfectly still. Not like something abandoned, it felt more like something waiting. I tried to push the door open, but I couldn’t. I wouldn’t. I didn’t need to see. I was fine. You know what, it’s probably nothing. In fact, I wasn’t even worried. It was probably some snot nosed brat from that summer camp Hunter was telling me about. 
I slammed the door closed. The door drifted back open. I slammed it again. It opened again. The door was mocking me. One more try. 
This cabin is a joke. 
The house was stuffy actually, so I left the door ajar. Not because I couldn’t close it, but because I didn’t mind the fresh air. 
I left the scene, heading back to the living room. I walked around my pile of luggage, dead set on something else now. I didn’t want to move it to the bedroom.
I was tired. The couch will do.

I threw myself onto the couch, a sandstorm of dust catapulting into the air with my impact. I coughed and spluttered, briefly getting trapped in a gritty nightmare, before I could start to relax. I just lay there, absorbing the surrounding sounds of the forest. The trees rustled with life, birds threw songs out into the air just to pass the time. Soon, I started to hear a slight tapping sound. Must’ve been the start of some rain. I always loved rain. It had a strange rhythm to it I found it comforting, especially when I was younger. I always loved watching the raindrops race across the window panes on a rainy day.

Soon, there was wind. 

Wet wind. 

Hot, wet wind.

Right up against my face. 

My eyes shot open, greeted with two bright green miasmic eyes, gleaming in the night. They shot back, now trying to hide in the corner of the room. I could almost see its form now. It was thin, malnourished, a not quite human form. It was a mockery of a human, like taxidermy with the wrong skeleton, like an animal that was parodying me. It had patches of fur, and a wide, toothen snout, tusk-like fangs curling out of its mouth. It sat on its haunches, using long, splintered claws to tap, tap away. It’s back was thin, tire tracks lay across its midsection like a macabre belt. It hissed and spluttered as it sat, its eyes still examining me. I tried to say something, anything, but the words lay stillborn in my throat. Eventually, I stammered something out:

	“W-what…what are you?”

It didn’t respond immediately. It hissed for a moment, before wheezing out a sentence.

	“What is it that lies in your heart? What is it that drives you?”

I tried to stammer a response, some sort of question, but it seemed to know exactly what I would’ve said.

	“I hunger for your ambitions. Tell me what it is that you want, and I shall make it true.”

I tried to stand up, but it felt like I had something sitting on my chest. I could just barely sputter out a reply.

	“W-what does that mean? What does any of this mean!”

Tears swelled in my eyes, finding an escape I wish I could. I stared at the corpse through blurred vision, its eyes gazing back with worrying patience. It continued to huff, its only movement being the swelling of its chest and shifting of its jowls.

	“Please! What do you want from me-!”

It snarled back, almost instinctively, with a deep, mucous voice.

	“What lies in your heart! What is it that you need!”

I tried to move again, but knew it was pointless. I was stuck. Was this where I was going to die? I thought back at how much energy I had wasted in my life, all just for me to die here. All the time wasted at work, all the time wasted at therapy… That's when it came to me. I remember what my therapist said about looking on the bright side. Worst case scenario, I die after clearing my chest. 

	“At work, no one appreciates what I do. I burn the candle at both ends, and the best I get is an ‘attaboy’ and a pat on the back. Any talks of promotion are shut down. I was stressed. I had a… a freakout at work. They sent me on this trip t-to clear my mind, but I know this is my last hurrah before I get laid off. I just wish I could… that people would appreciate me more…”

The beast was silent, watching me through green eyes, as if waiting for me to make the wrong move. It leant forward, the moonlight revealing an almost familiar form. 

	“That's not what you truly want, is it? I know you. I know the type of person you are. What is your real ambition?”

I thought for just a second, then with as much conviction as I had, I murmured:

	“…I want Dirk and Sons to crash and burn.”

The beast sat for just a few more moments, before rustling out a low, humourless laugh.



	“Your will be done.”

When hiring new officers for private security, one untrained Security Officer can ruin both your company's brand and the reputation of the industry as a whole.  Given that the private security industry isn't as regulated by government powers as other industries, the responsibility falls on you as the owner, security director or hiring manager to check and check again that you're hiring the best and most truthful candidates possible.  Here are some things to keep in mind when interviewing candidates:

Perform a criminal background check on all candidates.  They might be pricey and time-consuming, but nothing is more worthwhile when it comes to choosing private security officers.  Most states require that security officers have a license to be able to perform the job, which include a background check performed by the state. However, relying on one source could be your downfall.  In 2014, Springdale Job Corps, a school in Troutdale, Oregon, found itself on the receiving end of a $7.5 million lawsuit when a privately employed Security Officer working on campus hurt a student.  The Guard in question had a criminal history including charges of prostitution and fraud, yet the company that hired him missed it. Conducting an investigation of your own is the safest way to make sure your new hire is who you expect him to be.

Establish your own standards, and stick to them.  Do you require that candidates hold legal residency or U.S. citizenship?  Believe it or not, that's optional in 10 states.  Do you have a minimum age or experience level you require before hiring?  What are your training standards?  Whether you require previous law enforcement or military experience, or choose to develop your own training curriculum, be sure you clearly spell out the standards expected.

Conduct in-depth interviews.  Do your positions often require your guards to operate in crowds effectively?  Try conducting one of your interviews at a crowded location, such as a busy shopping center, and see how the candidates respond.  Are they uncomfortable with people constantly walking by them?  Can they still focus on the task at hand?  Are they easily distracted?  The security profession requires honed observation skills and the ability to notice when something's out of the ordinary. 

False Security Officer licenses do exist, so trust your instinct. Recently, hundreds of people went under investigation in Florida for carrying fake licenses that allowed them to carry a gun at work. Many states require that security officers add hours of firearm training and pass a test before they can carry a weapon. The forged training certificates were just the first clue many of the Security Officers arrested had no training. Spotting a falsified license is extremely hard; asking the right questions, checking their resume and background for suspicious activity, and trusting your instincts will help you rule out potential threats.

Evaluate their people skills.  Do your candidates smile, greet people, and generally pick up on social cues?  Are they clean cut and professional-looking?  While their primary task and purpose is security, every guard simultaneously represents your brand and the brand of whatever client they're guarding.  No company wants a guard that gets grouchy or rude to a customer who stops to ask them for directions to the restroom or the nearest coffee shop, so look for candidates with genuinely good manners.

Get technical.  Does the position require extensive use of electronic surveillance, video recording, or radio equipment?  Then observe how the candidate performs with each or all.  Do they get a wide-eyed, deer-in-the-headlights kind of look when you hand them an electronic device?  Can they write shift reports or event summaries quickly and clearly?  If required to use a radio, do they have good radio etiquette?  Depending on the candidate's background, these should be easy tasks (especially for prior military or law enforcement), but an untrained novice will likely stumble and reveal their lack of training quickly.

This might seem like a lot of work, but it's important to take a long-term perspective of the whole process and industry.  The public perception of private security is often quite poor; this perception is only reinforced when clients have negative experiences with a security company that took shortcuts rather than do the due diligence when it came to hiring its guards. Above all, an untrained Security Officer can put lives at risk.

As owners and hiring managers, you are the first and last line of defense for the industry's reputation, and your choices will directly impact the credibility of both your brand and the industry as a whole.",1,1752636416.0,SecurityOfficer,0,1.0,False

Coming back home was supposed to fix me.
After five years of burning my candle at both ends in Chicago, chasing deadlines, bad relationships, and a sense of self I never quite caught, I thought returning to Plainview, Iowa, would feel like a clean slate. I told myself that the quiet would help me write again, that the wide skies and familiar dirt roads would soften the noise in my head.
But from the moment I turned down the gravel drive and saw that crooked farmhouse hunched against the horizon, I knew I’d been lying to myself.

The place looked like a painting someone forgot to finish. One side faced the dying road, the other stared out into miles and miles of corn. The stalks were tall and tight, their tips rustling gently under the breath of early evening. The sun was going down, bleeding orange and crimson across the sky, and everything was bathed in that golden hour glow.

And yet, it all felt… off. Not just quiet, but too quiet. Like the world had hit pause.
Emma was waiting for me on the porch. She stood barefoot, her mug steaming in the cooling air, eyes soft as she took me in. Same brown hair, tied back now. Same calm presence that used to anchor me when we were kids and the world felt simpler, easier.
“You really came back,” she said, stepping forward into my space like no time had passed.
“I did,” I said, trying to smile. “Still not sure if it was brave or stupid.”
She hugged me anyway, warm and steady, like she always had been.
We sat on the porch as the sky turned violet. She handed me her spare mug, and I took a sip. Still too sweet, still exactly how I used to drink it. The nostalgia should’ve been comforting. But the cornfields, they wouldn’t stop pulling at the edge of my vision.
“You sure you want to live out here again?” she asked, eyes drifting toward the rows of green. “These fields have a way of getting under your skin.”

I scoffed lightly, trying to keep it casual. “It’s just corn. I grew up with this. What’s the worst that could happen?”
She didn’t smile this time.
“It’s not the corn,” she said quietly.
I tilted my head. “Then what is it?”
She hesitated. Looked around, as if the night might be listening. Then she leaned closer.
“The whispers.”
I blinked. “Whispers?”
“When the wind blows a certain way,” she said, voice barely above a murmur, “some people say you can hear voices coming from the fields. Like someone’s out there, talking.”
I laughed. I didn’t mean to, it just slipped out. Reflex.
But Emma didn’t laugh back. Her eyes stayed serious, her mouth still.
“That’s… folklore, right?” I asked, suddenly unsure.
She didn’t answer. Just sipped her coffee and watched the corn like it might move.
That night, I stayed up late, unpacking boxes and trying to ignore the way the house creaked. It was old, sure. Drafty. Probably mice in the walls. I told myself all the usual things.
But around 2 a.m., I heard it.
Not the house. Not the wind.
A whisper.
Faint. Drawn out. From the direction of the fields.

At first, I thought it was my mind playing tricks. You get used to city noise, to sirens and traffic and arguing neighbors. Silence can be its own kind of hallucination.
But then I heard it again.
A soft murmur. Words I couldn’t quite make out. Then, clearly, undeniably, my name.
“Jake…”
I froze.
It came again, carried on a breath of wind. The sound was coming from somewhere just beyond the backyard, from the edge where the grass disappeared into stalks.
I stood there, barefoot on the kitchen tile, heart thudding against my ribs, telling myself it was nothing. Just wind. Just imagination.
But I still grabbed my phone and called Emma.
She picked up on the second ring.
“Hey,” I said, my voice low, unsure why I was whispering too. “I think there’s something weird going on.”

There was a pause. “What do you mean?”
“I heard something. Outside. Like… whispering. Someone calling my name.”
She was quiet for a beat longer than she should’ve been.
“I didn’t want to scare you,” she said, “but there are stories. Old ones. About a man who disappeared in those fields, years ago. His name was Harold. People say his spirit never left, like he’s still trying to find his way out.”
“That sounds like a ghost story,” I said, though the words felt hollow.
“It is,” she said. “But stories don’t come from nowhere.”

The next morning, I met Tom at Miller’s Café. Same cracked linoleum floor, same stale coffee smell. He was sitting in his usual booth, staring into his mug like it owed him something.
“Tom,” I said, sliding in across from him. “Can I ask you something weird?”
He didn’t look up. “Try me.”
“Have you ever heard anything… strange, out in the fields? Voices. Whispers.”
He finally looked at me, eyes tired. “You’ve been here two nights, and already the corn’s talking to you?”
“I’m serious.”

He sighed. Took a long sip of coffee. “Ten years ago, a man named Harold walked into the fields. Middle of the night. No flashlight. No note. Never came back.”
I felt the hair rise on my arms.
“You think it’s him? The whispers?”
Tom shrugged. “Some say the corn holds onto things. Echoes. Memories. Pain.”
I stared out the window. The rows of corn swayed gently in the morning breeze. Just corn. Just wind. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was watching me from in between the stalks.
“I heard my name,” I said quietly. “Last night. Like something was calling me.”
Tom leaned forward. His voice dropped.
“If it’s calling, don’t answer.”
That evening, Emma came by again. We sat on the porch, watching the sun sink behind the fields. The silence felt heavier this time.
“You really think there’s something out there?” I asked.

She didn’t answer right away.
“I think places remember things,” she said finally. “And sometimes, they don’t forget the people who try to leave them behind.”
I laughed, trying to cut the tension. “Maybe I’m just stressed. Coming back here’s already messing with me.”
Emma looked at me, and for the first time, I saw real fear in her eyes.
“You’re not imagining it, Jake,” she said. “Just… be careful. The corn gets in your head. It knows how to whisper in the right voice.”
That night, I couldn’t sleep.
Around 3 a.m., I heard it again.
Closer now. Louder.
This time, it wasn’t just a whisper.

It was a voice. And it knew my name..

1m124vo,https://www.reddit.com/r/HorrorTalesCommunity/comments/1m124vo/the_weaver_of_fear_part_1/,The Weaver of Fear part 1,"Chapter 1: The Stain on Oakhaven  
The air in Oakhaven was thick with an unspoken dread, a miasma more pervasive than any morning fog that ever drifted from the whispering woods. It clung to the clapboard houses, seeped into the very grain of the church steeple, and settled like a shroud upon the once-bustling town square. This was not the simple fear of a harsh winter or a poor harvest; it was a deeper, more insidious terror, born of the unnatural and the inexplicable. It had a name, though few dared to speak it above a whisper: Elara.  
  
Elara, at thirteen years of age, was a creature of perpetual apology. She moved through the world as if constantly trying to shrink, her small frame often hunched, her shoulders rounded as if bearing an invisible weight. Her eyes, wide and the color of rain-washed slate, perpetually scanned her surroundings, not with curiosity, but with a profound, gnawing anxiety. Every step was a silent plea for forgiveness, every breath a suppressed gasp of guilt. Her clothes, muted grays and browns, were chosen not for comfort or style, but for their ability to blend, to disappear, to make her less visible to the world she inadvertently tormented. For Elara carried a curse, a terrifying, unconscious ability known only to her parents and the growing number of victims: Vulnerability Inducement. It was a power that ripped the deepest, most abhorrent fears from the minds of those around her and dragged them, screaming, into brutal, physical reality. These were no phantoms of the mind, no fleeting hallucinations. They were tangible, terrifying manifestations of pure, distilled terror.  
  
The first tremor of the curse had been subtle, almost dismissible. A neighbor’s prize-winning roses, vibrant one moment, had wilted and blackened as Elara passed by, their petals crumbling to dust. Then came the incident with young Caleb Hayes, a boy terrified of the dark. Elara had been playing innocently in her front yard, Caleb on his own porch next door. Suddenly, a shadow, impossibly deep and vast, had detached itself from the afternoon sun, coiling around Caleb’s small body, plunging him into an absolute, suffocating blackness that stole his breath and his screams. His mother found him moments later, convulsing on the porch, his eyes wide and unseeing, staring into a darkness that only he could perceive, a darkness that had been conjured, unknowingly, by Elara.  
  
But the day the butcher, old Earl Johnson, lost his livelihood and his sanity, was etched into the town's collective memory like a brand. Elara had been sent to fetch salt from the general store, a rare and carefully orchestrated excursion. Her mother, Eleanor, had walked ahead, her back a rigid line of maternal protection, while her father, Thomas, lingered behind, his gaze a constant, desperate perimeter check. As Elara passed Johnson’s Meats, the usual cloying scent of blood and sawdust was suddenly overwhelmed by something far fouler. Inside the butcher’s window, where glistening cuts of beef and plump chickens usually hung, a putrescence began. The vibrant reds of the sirloins bled into a sickly black, their marbled fat liquefying into viscous, green-tinged slime. Chickens, moments before plump and inviting, shriveled like mummified husks, their feathers turning to dust. A collective gasp rose from the few shoppers brave enough to be out. Earl Johnson, a man whose life was built on the preservation of flesh, watched, his eyes bulging, as his entire display dissolved into a reeking, crawling mass of decay, alive with unseen things. He let out a shriek that tore through the quiet street, a sound of pure, unadulterated horror, as if the rot had begun not just in his meat, but in his very bones. Customers fled, gagging, and Elara, her face pale and clammy, felt the familiar, crushing wave of guilt wash over her. She knew. She always knew.  
  
Oakhaven, once a picture of pastoral serenity, had become a town of drawn curtains and hushed voices. Its neat, well-maintained houses now seemed to huddle together, their doors often shut against the outside world, not for privacy, but for protection. The town square, once a lively hub of gossip and trade, was eerily quiet, a vast, empty space that seemed to amplify the fearful whispers that followed Elara like a chilling wind. The prominent church steeple, usually a symbol of community, now stood as a desperate, silent beacon, its bells ringing out not with joy, but with the frantic, superstitious prayers of a populace convinced they were cursed. Every unexplained illness, every sudden crop blight, every bizarre ""accident"" – the collapse of a barn roof, the inexplicable drying of a well – was laid at Elara's small, trembling feet. The townsfolk were not cruel in their avoidance; they were profoundly, terribly afraid, seeing her as a living harbinger of their deepest nightmares.  
  
Elara’s home, a modest, two-story house perched precariously on the very edge of town, felt less like a sanctuary and more like a carefully constructed prison. Its windows, unlike those of its neighbors, were almost always closed, the thin curtains drawn tight, not for privacy, but to minimize any potential external interactions, any accidental proximity. Inside, it was meticulously clean, almost sterile, yet sparse, reflecting the family’s constant, all-consuming preoccupation with Elara’s power. Books on abnormal psychology, ancient medical texts, and religious pamphlets lay scattered on tables and shelves, their pages dog-eared, their margins filled with Eleanor’s frantic annotations – evidence of her parents’ desperate, ongoing, and ultimately futile search for answers, for a cure, for any shred of hope.  
  
Eleanor, Elara’s mother, was a woman whose very essence seemed woven from worry. Her deep-set eyes held a perpetual, shadowed anxiety, and her hands were almost always clasped together, a gesture of constant, silent prayer or barely contained tremor. She was endlessly patient with Elara, her voice a soft, soothing balm, but the immense strain of their existence showed in the faint, permanent lines etched around her mouth and the subtle tremor that occasionally ran through her slender frame. She was the researcher, the quiet scholar of their private apocalypse, poring over folklore and scientific theories alike, chasing every rumour of a solution, however outlandish. Nights were a blur of lamplight and turning pages, the scent of old paper and stale coffee her constant companions. She sought patterns, triggers, anything that might explain the terrifying randomness of Elara’s gift. Was it proximity? A specific emotion? The phase of the moon? Each failed hypothesis chipped away at her resolve, leaving behind only deeper circles under her eyes and a more profound sense of helplessness.  
  
Thomas, Elara’s father, was more outwardly stoic, a man whose jaw was often clenched, a muscle twitching beneath the skin, betraying the hurricane of turmoil within. He was the family’s shield, the one who stepped forward to confront the angry glares of the townsfolk or deflect their pointed questions with a quiet, unyielding resolve. His heart, Elara knew, broke daily for her, for the life she couldn’t have, for the terror she unwittingly caused. He tried practical solutions – keeping Elara indoors, encouraging her to wear thick gloves, even suggesting a bell that would warn people of her approach – knowing deep down that these are futile against the unpredictable, insidious nature of her gift. He measured distances, trying to map an invisible radius of effect, only to find it shifted, expanded, or contracted without rhyme or reason. He had even, in a moment of desperate, whispered hope, tried to construct a small, lead-lined room in the cellar, a futile attempt to contain what defied physical barriers. Both parents shared an unwavering, profound love for Elara, a fierce, protective devotion that was both their greatest strength and their heaviest, most agonizing burden.  
  
The memory of the town's annual Harvest Festival, just last autumn, still haunted them. Elara, bundled in a heavy coat, had been allowed to attend for a mere hour, kept close between her parents. Old Betty Jo Carter, known for her crippling fear of public speaking, had been coaxed onto the small stage to recite a poem. As Elara had inadvertently drifted a few feet closer, drawn by the music, Betty Jo’s voice had suddenly seized. Her eyes, wide with terror, had fixed on the crowd, which, to her, had transformed into a sea of leering, judging faces, their mouths gaping in silent, mocking laughter. She had collapsed, clawing at her throat, convinced she was suffocating, her fear made horrifyingly real by Elara’s unseen touch. The festival had ended in chaos, the joy curdled into a fresh wave of suspicion and dread.  
  
Daily life in their fortress-home was a precarious tightrope walk. Every outing, even to the small, enclosed garden at the back, was a calculated risk. Meals were often eaten in silence, punctuated only by Elara’s quiet, tearful apologies for things she couldn’t control, and her parents’ reassurances that, though heartfelt, rang hollow even to their own ears. They were a unit, fiercely bound by a shared secret and a terrifying reality, yet profoundly isolated, living on an island of dread in a sea of fear. And Elara, the unwitting weaver of nightmares, felt the weight of it all, a crushing, suffocating burden that was hers alone to bear. The stain on Oakhaven was not just on the houses or the streets; it was a mark on Elara's soul, a brand of terror she could never scrub clean.  
  
Chapter 2: The Edge of the World  
Thirteen. The number hung in the air like a phantom limb, a milestone that felt less like a celebration and more like another year survived under the crushing weight of her own existence. Elara’s thirteenth birthday dawned not with balloons or laughter, but with a quiet, almost funereal breakfast. Her parents, their faces etched with the familiar worry, offered whispered wishes and a small, hand-knitted shawl, its muted colors mirroring her own. There was no cake, no friends, no joyful anticipation. How could there be, when every breath she took was a potential trigger, every step a dance with disaster?  
  
The silence of the house, usually a comfort, felt suffocating. The meticulously clean rooms, once a sanctuary, now seemed to mock her with their sterile emptiness. A desperate, aching need for air, for space, for anything beyond the walls of her self-imposed prison, gnawed at her. With a silent nod from her mother, a gesture of weary permission, Elara slipped out the back door, a ghost in her own home.  
  
Her feet, as if guided by some unseen force, led her away from the town, away from the watchful, fearful eyes, towards the forgotten places. She found herself on the old train tracks, a rusted, skeletal spine of iron that snaked through the dense, whispering woods bordering Oakhaven. The tracks were long disused, overgrown with tenacious weeds and moss, their wooden ties rotting into the earth. It was a place of decay, of forgotten journeys, and in its quiet desolation, Elara found a strange, morbid comfort. Here, perhaps, she could do no harm. Here, the world was already broken.  
  
She walked for what felt like hours, the rhythmic crunch of gravel beneath her worn shoes a monotonous lullaby. The sun, a pale disc behind the perpetual haze of Oakhaven’s fear, cast long, distorted shadows through the trees. The air, thin and cool, offered a momentary respite from the claustrophobia of her life. She imagined the trains that once thundered here, carrying people to distant, unknown places, places where perhaps, a girl like her could exist without bringing ruin.  
  
The path along the tracks wound closer to the edge of town than she intended, skirting the back of the old lumber mill, its skeletal frame silhouetted against the pale sky. She was about to veer deeper into the woods when a sound, a muffled sob, caught her attention. Peeking through a tangle of thorny bushes, she saw her. Daisy Annabelle, a girl a year or two older than Elara, known for her quiet demeanor and the way she always seemed to shrink from loud noises or boisterous groups. Daisy Annabelle was huddled against the decaying wall of the mill, her face buried in her knees, trembling.  
  
Elara felt a familiar prickle of dread, a cold premonition that had become her constant companion. She should turn back. She should flee. But a strange, almost magnetic pull held her. Daisy Annabelle’s sobs grew louder, ragged and desperate. Elara, despite her terror, edged closer, compelled by a morbid fascination, or perhaps, a desperate, misguided empathy.  
  
 Elara approached, the air around Daisy seemed to thicken, the shadows from the mill’s broken timbers deepening into a menacing presence. Then, from the gloom, figures emerged—not shadowy forms, but men, real and fleshed-out, their faces twisted into cruel grimaces. They moved with a predatory grace, their eyes glinting with hunger as they closed in on Sarah.  
  
The first man reached her, his hands grasp her arms, his rough touch leaving red marks on her skin. His breath was stale, rank, and he laughed as she struggled, the sound grating and ugly. The others circled her, their eyes ravenous, their laughter growing louder, more mocking.  
  
Daisy’s screams pierced the air, but they only seemed to embolden them. Her clothes were torn from her body in quick, brutal movements, leaving her naked and trembling on the ground. She tried to cover herself, her arms flailing as tears streamed down her face, but they laughed at her attempts to shield herself.  
  
One by one, they took her, their rough hands gripping her limbs, their faces contorted with lust and violence. Her body was left shattered and broken beneath them, her cries muffled by sobs that tore from her throat. When it was over, the men staggered away, their expressions satisfied but ugly, their laughter echoing as they melted back into the shadows of the mill.  
  
Daisy lay on the ground, her naked body trembling, her hair disheveled and tangled around her face. Her eyes were wide with terror and pain, her skin pale and blotchy from tears. Elara stumbled back, gagging at the sight, her own body trembling as she took in the aftermath of this brutal violation.  
  
The air was thick with the stench of sweat and fear, the sound of Daisy’s cries echoing in Elara's ears long after the men had disappeared into the shadows once more. She fell to her knees, bile rising in her throat, the taste of ash and horror filling her mouth as she watched Daisy curl into herself, sobbing uncontrollably on the cold ground.  
  
She fled then, a wild, desperate flight, her lungs burning, her heart a frantic drum against her ribs. She ran until the mill was a distant, dark smudge, until the woods closed in around her, until the only sound was her own ragged breathing. She ran until she stumbled, exhausted and weeping, onto the old train tracks once more, far from the town, far from the screaming girl, far from the horrors she had wrought.  
  
It was then, as she rounded a gentle curve in the tracks, that she saw him. An old man, seated on a fallen log beside the tracks, whittling a piece of wood with a small, sharp knife. He was lean and wiry, surprisingly spry for his age, his face a roadmap of deep lines, etched by time and experience. But it was his eyes that caught her – remarkably clear, calm, and almost unsettlingly devoid of obvious fear. He wore simple, worn clothing, practical and unpretentious, and a faded, patched canvas hat sat low on his brow.  
  
Elara froze, her heart seizing in her chest. A stranger. A new potential victim. Her mind raced, calculating distances, assessing threats. What was his deepest fear? Would it be a sudden, violent manifestation? A swarm of insects, a crumbling earth, a suffocating darkness? Her breath hitched. She instinctively took a step back, ready to flee.  
  
The old man looked up, his movements slow and deliberate, his knife pausing in mid-stroke. He didn't flinch, didn't recoil, didn't show any of the immediate, visceral terror she had grown accustomed to. Instead, a low, gravelly voice rumbled, surprisingly gentle. ""Didn't mean to startle you, little one. Just enjoying the quiet.""  
  
He gestured to the empty space beside him on the log. ""Plenty of room. Unless you've got somewhere more important to be.""  
  
Elara hesitated, her fear warring with a profound, almost desperate curiosity. No one in Oakhaven spoke to her like that, not anymore. They either avoided her or spoke with a strained, forced politeness that barely masked their dread. She took another tentative step forward, her eyes still fixed on him, searching for any flicker of the horror she knew she could unleash. But there was none. Only a quiet, almost meditative presence.  
  
""I'm Silas,"" he said, extending a hand, not to her, but to the whittled piece of wood, turning it over in his calloused fingers. ""Silas Abernathy. And you must be Elara."" He didn't ask, he simply stated it, as if her name was a known fact, devoid of the usual fearful inflection.  
  
""How... how do you know my name?"" she whispered, her voice barely audible.  
  
He chuckled, a dry, rustling sound like autumn leaves. ""This is Oakhaven, child. Everyone knows everyone. Or at least, everyone knows about everyone."" His gaze met hers, unwavering. ""And I've heard the whispers. But whispers are just that. Air. Nothing to be afraid of.""  
  
His words, so simple, yet so profoundly different from anything she had ever heard, began to chip away at her defenses. She edged closer, still wary, but a fragile thread of hope, thin as a spider's silk, began to weave itself in her heart. He didn't seem afraid. He didn't seem to be anything but calm.  
  
""You... you're not scared?"" she asked, the words tumbling out before she could stop them.  
  
Silas Abernathy paused his whittling, his gaze distant for a moment, as if looking back through long corridors of time. ""Scared?"" he repeated, the word tasting foreign on his tongue. ""Child, I've seen things that would make the devil himself weep for mercy. Things that clawed their way out of the very pit of hell and wore the faces of men. I was a combat veteran, you see. Saw more than my share of fear."" He looked at her then, a direct, piercing gaze. ""And after a while, you learn that fear is just another thing. Another thing you face. Or it faces you.""  
  
His words resonated with a strange, undeniable truth. He wasn't saying he never felt fear, but that he had encountered it, wrestled with it, and emerged on the other side. This was not the naive ignorance of a child, nor the desperate denial of an adult. This was something else entirely.  
  
A dam, built of years of isolation and unspoken terror, began to crack within Elara. The words, once so fiercely guarded, began to spill out, hesitant at first, then with a torrent of desperate relief. She told him about the roses, about Caleb Hayes and the suffocating darkness. She told him about Earl Johnson and the rot. She told him about Betty Jo Carter and the mocking faces. She told him about the whispers, the avoidance, the way the town looked at her as if she were a monster. And then, her voice dropping to a raw, ragged whisper, she told him about Daisy Annabelle, and the shadowy forms, and the scream. She confessed her curse, her burden, her profound, agonizing guilt.  
  
Silas Abernathy listened, his old eyes unblinking, his hands still, the whittling forgotten. He didn't interrupt, didn't gasp, didn't offer platitudes. He simply listened, a silent, unwavering presence. And as Elara spoke, pouring out the darkest secret of her life to this stranger, she felt a lightness she hadn't known in years. A fragile, precious lightness, as if a tiny piece of the immense weight she carried had, for the first time, been shared. The air around them remained still, undisturbed by any manifestation. For the first time in her life, Elara felt truly, inexplicably safe.  
  
Chapter 3: The Tent in the Trees  
The old train tracks, once a path of solitary escape, became Elara’s daily pilgrimage. Each morning, after the strained breakfast and her parents’ whispered farewells, she would slip out, a small, bundled figure vanishing into the woods. Her destination was Silas Abernathy’s camp, nestled deep among the ancient oaks and whispering pines, a place where the air felt strangely clear, unburdened by the town’s pervasive dread.  
  
Silas, she discovered, was a man who lived on the fringes, not by choice, but by circumstance. His ""home"" was a surprisingly well-maintained canvas tent, pitched discreetly beneath a canopy of dense foliage. Inside, it was spartan but orderly: a bedroll, a small, portable stove, a stack of worn books, and a collection of meticulously carved wooden figures – birds, animals, abstract shapes that seemed to twist with a life of their own. He was, in the quiet vernacular of Oakhaven, a homeless man, a fact that would have filled Elara with a fresh wave of anxiety for anyone else. But Silas carried his circumstances with a dignity that defied pity.  
  
Elara began to bring him offerings. First, a simple sandwich, carefully wrapped, pilfered from her own meager lunch. Then, a thermos of her mother’s strong, sweet tea. Soon, her daily visits became a mission: a fresh apple, a small tin of coffee, a worn blanket from her own closet, a book she thought he might like. Her parents, though they noticed the missing items, said nothing, perhaps sensing the fragile, vital connection she was forging.  
  
Silas, in turn, treated her not as the town’s cursed child, but as a normal person. He spoke to her about the woods, the changing seasons, the habits of the local wildlife. He taught her how to identify different trees by their bark, how to track deer by their prints, how to sit perfectly still and listen to the symphony of the forest. He never once mentioned her power, never asked about the incidents, never flinched from her proximity. He simply listened when she spoke, offered quiet observations, and shared the dry, rustling chuckle that had first drawn her in.  
  
One crisp afternoon, as the autumn leaves began to turn the forest into a riot of dying color, Elara found Silas meticulously sharpening his carving knife. The air was cool, carrying the scent of damp earth and pine.  
  
""You spend a lot of time out here,"" Elara observed, her voice softer than usual. ""Don't you ever... miss being in a house? With a roof that doesn't flap in the wind?""  
  
Silas chuckled, testing the blade with his thumb. ""A house can be its own kind of cage, little one. And a roof, no matter how sturdy, can't keep out the things that truly haunt you. Out here, the wind is honest. The trees don't judge. And the only monsters are the ones you bring with you."" He looked up, his gaze steady. ""Or the ones you make.""  
  
Elara flinched, the last words a subtle, unintended barb. ""I don't make them,"" she whispered, her voice tight. ""They just... come out. Because of me.""  
  
Silas set the knife down. ""No,"" he said, his voice firm. ""They come out because they were already there. Lurking in the dark corners of someone else's mind. You're just... the key. The one who unlocks the door. A terrible key, perhaps, but a key nonetheless."" He picked up a fresh piece of wood, smooth and pale. ""Tell me, Elara. When you see these things happen, these fears made real... what do you feel?""  
  
Elara hesitated, choosing her words carefully. ""Guilty. Horrible. Like I'm a monster. Like I'm broken.""  
  
""And what else?"" he pressed gently. ""Beyond the guilt. Do you feel... anything else? A pull? A pressure? A whisper?""  
  
She thought for a long moment. ""Sometimes... sometimes it feels like a buzzing. Like a hive of angry bees, just under my skin. And then it bursts."" She shuddered, remembering Daisy Annabelle’s scream. ""And then it's gone, and all that's left is the mess.""  
  
Silas nodded slowly, his eyes distant. ""A buzzing. Interesting. It's a connection, then. Not a creation. You're a conduit, Elara. A channel for the unspoken horrors. That's a powerful thing. Terrifying, yes. But powerful."" He began to carve, the wood shavings curling away from the blade. ""The question isn't how to stop being a key. It's how to choose which doors you open. Or if you open them at all.""  
  
Weeks bled into a month, the daily ritual of her visits becoming the most real, most vital part of Elara’s existence. The fear of her power, though always present, receded to a dull hum in Silas’s company. She found herself laughing, truly laughing, for the first time in years, at one of his dry anecdotes or a particularly clumsy squirrel. The thought of him, alone in his tent as the nights grew colder, began to prick at her conscience.  
  
One evening, at dinner, the words tumbled out before she could properly censor them. ""I met someone,"" she began, her voice small, her eyes fixed on her plate.  
  
Eleanor and Thomas exchanged a quick, wary glance. ""Someone, dear?"" Eleanor asked, her voice carefully neutral, though her hands had already begun their familiar clasping motion under the table.  
  
""An old man,"" Elara continued, rushing the words, ""He lives in the woods, by the tracks. His name is Silas Abernathy. He's... he's a combat veteran.""  
  
A tense silence descended, heavier than usual. Thomas’s jaw tightened, a muscle twitching near his ear. Eleanor’s eyes, already shadowed, deepened with fresh apprehension. The unspoken question hung heavy in the air, a phantom accusation: Is he dangerous? A vagrant? Worse? Has he taken advantage of our daughter's vulnerability? The town’s fear of the unknown, of anything that strayed from their rigid, fearful norms, was deeply ingrained in them too.  
  
""A combat veteran?"" Thomas finally said, his voice low, a distinct note of suspicion in it. ""And he lives... in the woods? Elara, darling, you know we've warned you about strangers. Especially men who live alone in the wilderness.""  
  
Elara shook her head, her eyes pleading, brimming with a desperate earnestness. ""No, Papa, you don't understand. He's different. He's kind. And he's not afraid of me. Not like... not like everyone else."" The last words were a raw, desperate plea, a crack in her carefully constructed composure. ""He just... listens. He talks to me like I'm normal. He doesn't flinch.""  
  
Eleanor’s gaze softened, though the worry never quite left her eyes. She saw the desperate hope in her daughter’s face, the fragile light that Silas had kindled. ""He's not afraid of you?"" she repeated, almost to herself, the concept so alien, so miraculous, it was hard to grasp. ""Are you certain, Elara? You've been around him, and nothing... nothing has happened?""  
  
""Nothing,"" Elara insisted, relief flooding her voice. ""He just... stays calm. He talks about fear like it's... something he knows. Something he's faced.""  
  
After a long, hushed discussion that night, filled with hushed anxieties and desperate hopes, they made a decision. It was a gamble, a terrifying leap of faith, but the alternative – Elara’s continued, soul-crushing isolation – was becoming unbearable.  
  
""We'll invite him for dinner, Elara,"" Thomas announced the next morning, his voice still firm, but with a new, hesitant resolve. ""Just one night. We need to meet him. Understand who he is. For your sake.""  
  
Elara's heart soared, a fragile bird taking flight.  
  
The dinner was a study in cautious observation, a delicate dance of unspoken questions and measured responses. Silas arrived precisely on time, his worn clothes clean, his face freshly shaven, his few possessions neatly bundled. He carried himself with an unassuming grace, his gaze direct but not challenging, missing nothing, yet judging nothing. He spoke little at first, allowing Eleanor and Thomas to lead the conversation, but when he did, his words were thoughtful, imbued with a quiet wisdom that surprised them both.  
  
""You mentioned you were a veteran, Mr. Abernathy,"" Thomas began, his voice carefully neutral, trying to gauge the man. ""Which war, if you don't mind my asking?""  
  
Silas took a slow sip of water. ""The last one. The one they called 'The Forgotten Conflict.' Not much to remember, for most folks. But some things, they stick to you like burrs."" He spoke of the war not with bravado or regret, but with a stark, unsettling honesty that hinted at depths of experience they could barely fathom. He spoke of the quiet dignity of the woods, of the simple pleasure of carving wood, of the deceptive peace that could be found in solitude. He ate sparingly, but with appreciation, and listened intently as Eleanor, emboldened by his calm presence, spoke of her research, her voice tentative at first, then gaining confidence as she realized he wasn't judging, only absorbing. She laid out her theories, her failed attempts, the growing despair.  
  
""We've tried everything, Mr. Abernathy,"" Eleanor confessed, her voice cracking slightly. ""Doctors, specialists, even some... less conventional avenues. No one has any answers. They just... shake their heads. Or look at us with that same fear the town has.""  
  
Silas nodded slowly. ""The world isn't always built for what it doesn't understand, ma'am. Especially when that understanding comes with a price."" He paused, his gaze thoughtful. ""You've been trying to cage a storm, ma'am. And a storm, by its nature, cannot be caged. It can only be weathered. Or understood."" He watched Elara with an almost paternal warmth, a quiet understanding that seemed to bypass the horror of her gift, seeing only the child beneath the curse. ""Perhaps,"" he continued, his voice softer, ""the problem isn't the storm itself, but the way you're trying to fight it. What if it's not a disease to be cured, but... something else entirely? Something with a purpose, however dark?""  
  
By the end of the evening, the tension in the room had dissipated, replaced by a strange, cautious respect. Thomas, usually so guarded, found himself drawn to Silas’s quiet strength, a man who seemed to carry a profound peace despite his hardships. Eleanor, ever the pragmatist, saw not a threat, but a potential ally, a mind that approached the inexplicable not with fear, but with a seasoned, unshakeable calm.  
  
""Silas,"" Thomas began, clearing his throat, a hesitant kindness in his voice. ""We... we have a small shed out back. It's more than just a shed, really. It's been converted. It's got electricity, air conditioning, even a small bathroom with a shower. It's not much, but... with winter coming, and given your... circumstances..."" He trailed off, gesturing vaguely towards the back of the house. ""We'd be honored if you'd consider staying there. As long as you need.""  
  
Silas’s clear eyes met his, a flicker of something akin to gratitude, or perhaps just quiet surprise, passing through them. He understood the unspoken offer, the immense leap of faith. ""It sounds like a palace,"" he rumbled, a faint, genuine smile touching his lips, softening the hard lines of his face. ""And I'd be grateful. More than words can say.""  
  
Then, his gaze shifted to Elara, a silent promise passing between them, before settling back on her parents. ""And perhaps,"" he continued, his voice low but firm, imbued with a newfound purpose, ""I can help you understand this... gift... that Elara possesses. I've faced many things that defy easy explanation in my life. Things that twisted the minds of others. Perhaps, together, we can find a way to tame it. Or, at the very least, understand its true nature. To see it not just as a curse, but as... something else."" He paused, his eyes holding theirs. ""This town... it holds its secrets close. And sometimes, those secrets have long, dark roots. Perhaps the answers you seek aren't in medical books, but in the dust of Oakhaven itself.""  
  
Eleanor and Thomas exchanged a look, a flicker of desperate hope igniting in their weary eyes, chasing away some of the shadows. It wasn't a promise of salvation, not a magical cure, but it was a hand extended in the deepest, darkest night. Silas Abernathy, the man who seemed to fear nothing, had offered to help them navigate the terrifying labyrinth of Elara’s curse. And for the first time in a very long time, the fortress-home on the edge of Oakhaven felt a little less like a prison, and a little more like a sanctuary.

1m120fu,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1m120fu/apple_application_advice/,Apple Application Advice...,"I replied to a post earlier today and my DM's are absolutely obliterated. I apologize if I could not get back to you directly but I tried to reply to as many as I can. I will summarize the advice I shared. Sorry if it is hella basic but it worked for me and I think talking to some guys I talked to on my team and beyond. 

*  Apple is constantly and aggressively hiring. Jobs are always going to be on the career site. I know it seems like a black hole of applications but it is what it is. Submit an application.
* My background:  Apple was my target company for a variety of reasons from the first day of me studying CS. I consider myself a very average student. I did go to a Top 3 school (I'll come back to that later).  I am a bit older and non traditional however. I served. Then came home and started a business (completely unrelated to CS) and then sold the business to go back to school. I did a bunch of side projects mostly for the love of the game during my four years but did not have any internships. I am a bit older than most college students and as such had a lot of responsibilities. I competed very seriously in a sport. I ended up getting an offer for a NASA internship but declined it due to it being in West Virginia and in the middle of the school year.  
* Regarding Referrals: Knowing how absolutely average I was as a student (there were 100s of absolute studs in college), I really focused on networking during my four years. I reached out to every person in my life  that might have some connection with some big tech company and I cold messaged people I found on linked in. Looking at my spreadsheet, I literally had coffee or zoom meetings with nearly 40 individuals in four years and I reached out to very likely hundreds. I did all of that and I used 4 referrals to Apple specifically. I never got a call back for any of those roles.
* I applied to dozens of Apple positions without referrals and kinda lost hope. I randomly got a call back for a random role I applied for 5 months prior. Honestly, this mirrors the story of many people I know at this company. 
* Interviewing: I would say if you don't consider yourself a naturally charismatic person, then try to work on that in every aspect of your life. When I got the NASA offer, I legit asked what I did to get an offer when there were a lot more talented engineers that I knew personally that applied. The response I got was that ""there are a lot of A+ failures that come in and out of these doors."" We talked about that statement and what he meant was that shit will go terribly on a team. There is immense value in having a team of people that can keep their cool and work well under pressure. His point is that many applicants fail to convey that. I would say in general, remember that people are looking to hire someone that they would want to be around for 40 hours a week. There are so many talented engineers but the difference really is pretty marginal. Everything can be taught. And if you are insanely innovative, then you aren't worrying about working for some big corporation, you are building something yourself.
* So yea, I went to a top school which probably got my resume looked at a lot more than it should. But I will say, I really am in the minority of people who went to top schools on my team. I mean legit one of the best MLE on our team is self taught and got a degree in drama or something like that. Albeit he came in at an entirely different generation, but the point remains, no one really cares about schools. Someone that got hired in my cohort went to a very very obscure state school and at the end of the day we make the same money and have the same chances to rise up. 
* THE BIGGEST THING: Tailor your resume for the role. I know we all think quantity is key and it is because it is a numbers game but you won't ever be looked at unless your resume is perfect for the job you are applying to. Once I took that advice seriously, I started getting call backs. I first hired a resume writer and out of the 10 resumes they did for me, I got 6 call backs. I built on that and starting tailoring them myself it remained about 50/50. I know not everyone can pay for something like that but find a way tailor your resumes. It is so worth it....

The next evening, he passed (in a very upsetting way). We can't understand what happened or why... :(","So, our pet rabbit was acting lethargic and not eating/pooping. We suspected he was constipated (probably from excess sugar or protein in his mix and him not eating enough hay to balance that). When he did poop, it was dark and goopy. He stopped eating then. He was constipated once (years ago, shortly after we rescued him; he was overweight too), but we were able to treat him for that successfully, and he recovered and also lost the extra weight. 

My sister took him to the vet to see if he was constipated/impacted, and the vet felt him and said that he didn't appear to be constipated/impacted and that he was probably ""just feeling a little lazy."" They gave us a prescription for meloxicam (0.8ml) and transdermal mirtazapine to rub on his ears. My family also started giving him ""Critical Care Herbivore"" on day 2 or 3 of his lethargy, although I don't know for sure if they got it at the vet this time or sometime in the past. 

(TW, this next part is sad).

Well, the evening of day 3, (less than 24 hours after seeing the vet) he came into the living room and lay down under the coffee table (very weird for him to want to be in there). Our dog started sniffing him and lay next to him, which was also very strange. So we checked on him: picked him up and set him on the table on a blanket. Well he started kicking violently, and we realized he was seizing. His mouth was open and he seemed to be struggling to breathe. We wrapped him up in the blanket and ran to get in the car to go to the emergency vet, and he squeaked when we picked him up. I dialed the emergency vet while my sister carried him to the door. 

I was on hold with the vet when I heard my sister crying by the porch. I went to help, and he had one last moment of movement and then passed away. It was extremely sad and tragic and horrible, and it seemed to just escalate out of nowhere...

This has been bothering me for a while (it's been a month since this happened, and it was too sad to talk about until now). What on earth happened? Was he impacted? Why the respiratory distress? Why the seizures? Why was it when we picked him up that it started? What could've been the cause?

Any thoughts on this is helpful, especially if any rabbit owners see their bunny have symptoms like this and are concerned. We loved him so much and miss him every day.

1m11qru,https://www.reddit.com/r/NextCryptoMoonshots/comments/1m11qru/why_lightning_network_is_failing_bitcoins_vision/,Why Lightning Network Is Failing Bitcoin’s Vision,"Bitcoin was created as peer-to-peer digital cash—a way for anyone to send money directly to anyone else, without middlemen or high fees. But today, that vision is falling apart, and the Lightning Network is a big part of why.

## What Was the Original Vision?

Satoshi designed Bitcoin to be a decentralized, trustless payment system. Every transaction recorded on the blockchain, secure and transparent. The dream was for people everywhere to use Bitcoin to pay for coffee, send remittances, or buy goods online—fast, cheap, and censorship-resistant.

## The Scaling Problem

Bitcoin’s base layer can only handle about 7 transactions per second. To keep the network secure and decentralized, block size wasn’t increased. So, scaling had to come from “Layer 2” solutions like Lightning Network—an off-chain payment system designed to handle millions of transactions quickly.

## Why Lightning Network Isn’t Living Up to the Dream

### 1. Centralization Risk

To use Lightning effectively, users often rely on large hubs or nodes. This creates centralized points of control that contradict Bitcoin’s decentralized ethos. A few big players control a large share of Lightning’s capacity, creating bottlenecks and censorship risks.

### 2. Custodial Risks

Many Lightning wallets are custodial or semi-custodial, meaning users must trust third parties to manage their funds. This goes against Bitcoin’s principle of “be your own bank” and exposes users to hacks, freezes, or fraud.

### 3. Complexity and User Experience

Lightning is complicated. Opening and managing payment channels isn’t straightforward for average users. This limits adoption and keeps Bitcoin out of the hands of everyday people.

### 4. Limited Use Cases

Lightning is mainly useful for small, instant payments but not suited for larger transactions or diverse financial applications. It lacks the broad utility needed to truly replace traditional money or scale for mass adoption.

## What This Means for Bitcoin’s Future

The core team’s focus on Lightning instead of scaling the main chain has left Bitcoin more of a “digital gold” store of value than the peer-to-peer cash Satoshi envisioned. This has opened the door for other blockchains, like $XRP Ledger, to build fast, low-cost, scalable payment systems that banks and fintech companies are already using.

I'm femme and she's a bit of a soft masc. She's an introvert, also obviously very reserved, but we connected through our love for movies and anime. I think it also helped that we share the same political values. 

I think if I had encountered her irl I wouldn't bat an eye, pero man, the way she encouraged me and rooted for me, it was something. bilang words of affirmation ang isa sa top love languages ko (receiving). (She's also really good at giving advice)

So normally, as a gay girl of the 21st century, I did some digging before I emotionally invest in this person. 

 I only know her first name, where she works, what her profession is and how long she's been working sa current place of employment nya. I instantly found her on linkedin.

I searched her name on fb and found out she's (was?) married, and has a kid. PERO, I think the guy passed away? Or is paraplegic na (last photo of the guy on her mom's fb he was in a wheelchair and visibly sick in 2023) and then no more photos after that. I had no idea for sure if the guy passed away but it looks like he did cause she's been wearing this cremation necklace in her photos. So I assumed he's gone na. 

And then, the kid hay. 

I told myself ayoko ng anak. Nor do I want a partner with a kid, cause to be honest, while I'm fond of kids, I don't think I'm patient enough to raise or help raise a kid (yes, advanced ako magisip) it's also worth noting that I came from a very dysfunctional family. 

Now, she hasn't told me any of this yet. Never namen napagusapan in detail yung past relationships niya, and I think I'm partly at fault, kasi natatakot ako ibring up. 

I've been hinting at her that I'm being pressured by my mom for a kid, and she just sent an emoji as a response to that. I figured she doesn't want to talk about it so I dropped the topic. 

I tried to brush off the fact that she has a kid, and then eventually we went on our first date, and it was okay naman. We had dinner, coffee, then drove around for a bit while nagkkwentuhan. The conversation was so much better irl than online, so I was really happy about that. 

She has a big masc energy talaga, like you wouldn't think na may anak siya. She's so pretty too, very soft spoken and well mannered. Ang perfect na sana. 

I'm so torn if deal breaker ba na may anak siya or hindi. I think mas deal breaker ata that she left out this really important information. 

Idk what to do, to be honest. Di ko alam if I should already confront her about it, how do I ease in to the conversation about her past? Madali nalang dapat to pero ang hirap pala pag alam ko na yung sagot na gusto ko marinig from her. 

We're already planning on going out again, pero parang di ko alam if it's time that I ask her and tell her what I know? Should I just wait for her to tell me??? Pano ko va siya pipigain? Is it a red flag na parang di ata siya seryoso in dating me kasi, again, WHO LEAVES THIS INFORMATION OUT? Shouldn't it be something you tell a person you want to potentially date off the bat???

Help a gay girl out. Nasisira na yung judgment ko because I like her too much 😭😭😭

(Written as a firsthand experience)


---

I never believed in mirror superstitions.
Break one, you get seven years bad luck? Whatever.
Say “Bloody Mary” three times? Nothing.

But this… this wasn’t a game.

This mirror took me.


---

It started last November.
My grandmother passed and left me her house.
Old farmhouse, middle of nowhere, cold as hell.
The only thing she told me in her will was:

> “Don’t cover the mirror in the upstairs hallway. Let it see.”



Weird, right?
I figured it was some senile quirk. But when I moved in, I saw it.

A massive, old mirror — six feet tall, silver frame warped like melting wax.
It didn’t match the house. It didn’t match anything.
And when I looked into it…

I noticed something was off.

It was me, yeah — but my reflection… lagged.

Like I’d turn my head, and for a half second, my reflection would stay frozen, still staring at me.
Not a delay. A choice.


---

That first week, I kept catching it.
At night, it would flicker.
Like static. Like something pushing through.

Then, one night, I walked past and saw my reflection smiling.
But I wasn’t.
I swear on everything — I wasn’t.

I backed up, stared into it.
My reflection was still grinning — too wide, too many teeth, the mouth stretching just a little too far.

Then it stopped, mimicked me again.
Like it didn’t want me to catch it.


---

I tried to ignore it.
Told myself it was stress, grief, isolation.

But then came the tapping.

From inside the mirror.

Just faint, slow taps — like fingernails on glass.
Always at 3:33 AM.
Every. Night.

Until I made the mistake.

Until I got curious.


---

That night, I waited.
Sat in front of the mirror with a flashlight.
3:32 AM. Silence.

Then…
tap. tap. tap.

I asked, “What are you?”

The mirror fogged up from the inside.
And one word wrote itself in the condensation:

> “YOU.”



I laughed. Nervous.
Wiped the glass.
But my reflection didn’t move.

It stood still while I wiped, breathing slow and heavy.
Eyes locked on me.

Then it stepped forward.


---

The glass rippled, like water.
And before I could move, a hand shot out and grabbed my wrist.

It was cold and slick, like wet porcelain.
It yanked me into the glass — no impact, just a slide —
like falling through the surface of a still pond.


---

And then I was in the other side.

The same house, but dead quiet.
Gray light.
Everything covered in dust and static, like an abandoned film set.

I turned around — the mirror was gone.

In its place was a window, and on the other side of the glass…
was me.

The real me.
Watching TV. Drinking coffee.

He took my life.

And I’m stuck here, on this side, in the echo.


---

The world here isn’t dead.
But it’s not alive either.

The birds don’t fly.
The clocks don’t move.
The sky is always that same choking gray.

But sometimes, at night, I see others.
Figures, distorted, half-formed.
Things trapped in their own reflections.

And I know what they are now.

They're all people who looked too long.
Asked too many questions.
Let it in.


---

If you ever see your reflection move when you don’t…
If you ever see it smile when you're not smiling…

Don’t touch the glass.
Don’t stare back.
And whatever you do…

Don’t answer if it taps.

Because once you do,
your world becomes theirs.

And they never let go.

The Aries through Libra by-sign horoscopes are up, but I am running a little behind, so I will get the Scorpio through Pisces horoscopes up as soon as possible.","*JULY 15-31 (sorry for the typo in the title) 
Hi, everyone! Hope you’re all hanging in there with the retrogrades this month. I’ve been working on the column for a couple of days, but am running behind. I need to finish the by sign horoscopes. I’ll come back to post Scorpio through Pisces, hopefully tomorrow.

 

**Elder Witches Astrology Forecast for July 15th-31st**

**-- by vrwriter78**

 

Overview:

Retrogrades are a big theme this month with Neptune, Saturn, and Mercury all slowing down. While **Mercury Retrograde** (July 18-August 11 in Leo) gets a lot of buzz, its effects—think miscommunications, tech glitches, postponed plans, and re-doing tasks—don't have to be negative. It's a prime time to triple-check contracts, back up files, and anticipate minor tech hiccups. While it doesn’t have to be a bad experience, I will caution that starting new jobs can be tricky, because expectations might be unclear or something about the work or the duties gets restructured later.

Life happens, so if you *must* sign a contract or buy electronics, do your research, consult experts for major contracts, and be ready to revisit things later. This **Leo Mercury Retrograde** asks us to communicate from the heart. Leo loves to lead and shine, but during this time, focus on curiosity, playfulness, and active listening. The best leaders know how to serve, not just take charge.

**Retrogrades: General Guidance**

Generally, retrogrades favor finishing projects, tying up loose ends, and taking stock of where you've been before deciding where to go next. Each planet's energy shifts to allow us to finish up one cycle before we begin the next one. Here are the themes of each planet that will be retrograde:

·        **Saturn** (responsibility, rules, structure, discipline and authority)

·        **Neptune** (illusion, fantasy, dreams, mental health, psychic ability)

·        **Mercury** (communication, tech, travel, and the internet).

These planets are all ""operating more slowly,"" guiding us to revisit old territory and rehash whatever needs to be addressed before embarking on a new cycle.

On July 15th, the moon in Pisces opposes Mars (and Mars squares Venus), so expect people to be a little more irritable or sensitive. Be wary of hasty decisions or impulsive actions, as emotions might run high. Since both the moon and Venus are at unfriendly angles to Mars, this could spark disagreements with loved ones if we don't pause and react calmly. With the sun also squaring Chiron, our buttons may feel pushed, leading to negative reactions without truly listening to the other person. Many will feel better once the moon joins Saturn and Neptune in Aries on the 16th, as it finds support from planets in air and fire signs.

On the 18^(th), the day Mercury goes retrograde, it will make a harmonious aspect to Venus, making our communication more warm and loving, if we allow it. We may feel vulnerable and sensitive on the 19^(th), when the sun aspects Chiron, the planet of core wounds and healing.

July 22nd marks the sun entering Leo! This is where the sun shines brightest, beckoning us to find delight and express our innate talents. It's a social, creative, and playful time, perfect for gathering with loved ones and working on creative projects. Ask yourself: where can I shine? What playful activities can I engage with over the next three weeks?

The sun and Uranus are getting along well on the 23rd, making it a great day for brainstorming and creative breakthroughs if you've felt stuck. However, Venus will square Mars, bringing tension. This aspect often generates sexual chemistry and flirtatious banter, but it can also bring underlying relationship conflicts to the forefront. Because Mars opposes the North Node, simultaneously with Venus squaring Mars and three planets in retrograde, some of you may hit a point where you're simply done with fruitless arguments and rehashing old issues. This could be a ""make-it or break-it"" situation where you no longer have the willpower for an emotional rollercoaster.

The **New Moon in Leo on July 24th** opposes Pluto in Aquarius, reminding us we cannot move forward without addressing past wounds. Thankfully, Saturn and Neptune support this new moon, lending discipline and motivation for needed changes. Dream big on this Leo moon: what would you do if you were truly free? How would you show up if you weren't afraid? Be prepared to address past patterns even as you embrace a new future vision. This period is favorable for spells attracting attention (glamour, job interviews), freedom, creativity, self-love, and breaking old habits. If you have big goals, create a vision board and craft a spell around it. If you are an Aquarius, releasing, banishing, protection, and healing spells are highlighted for you.  
  
The sun makes an exact opposition to Pluto on the 25^(th) and Mercury squares Black Moon Lilith. The feeling I get here is a power struggle or someone standing up against a bully. There’s a line that once it is crossed, a person is done cooperating, done making excuses or putting up with B.S. If you’re feeling angry at injustice, it is okay to express it, just make sure you’re directing that in the right place and not lashing out at an innocent bystander.

If you’re craving connection and intimacy, whether that is with a romantic partner or cultivating friendship, Venus sextile Chiron on the 28^(th) could be a good time to allow yourself to be vulnerable with someone. Just be mindful that the moon will be square Venus as well on this day, so it may feel a bit uncomfortable to be so open. But as long as the person seems trustworthy, there could be rewards to doing so; there is a grand air trine, lending support to sharing ideas, information, and speaking about how you’ve grown and matured through the hardships you’ve faced.

On **July 30th, Venus enters Cancer!** Venus in Cancer is nurturing, welcoming, gentle, and comforting—always ready with tea or warm treats, sharing love, time, and home. Be kind and offer support where needed. The caveat is that a healthy Venus in Cancer understands boundaries and self-care, so don't overextend yourself or let selfish people take advantage, but do be considerate when you can.

For this cycle, text or call loved ones, bake treats, and make your home cozy. While Cancer is nurturing, watch for clingy tendencies or unsolicited advice. Find healthy ways to express emotions—journaling, therapy, or coffee with a best friend. Allow yourself to be fully present with your feelings rather than stuffing them down.

On **July 31st**, the sun conjuncts Mercury, making it a good day for brainstorming, digging for truth, or communicating ideas and plans. However, several squares and oppositions make it crucial to avoid hasty, impulsive communications or actions, as you could unintentionally rub someone the wrong way. The energy is quite scattered, with tense squares balanced by beneficial trines. It's a ""hit or miss"" day, where communication might flow freely and you feel supported, or people might be irritable and exhausted. Be prepared for both kinds of energy.

 

**Horoscopes by Sign:**

Note: Since sun sign horoscopes only cover a tiny part of the chart (affecting the accuracy), you may wish to take a look at your rising, sun, and moon sign. [Astro-Seek.com](http://astro-seek.com/) will tell you all of your planetary placements if you just want to find your rising sign. You can also find a free, accurate daily planetary reading on [Astro.com](http://astro.com/), which is based on your personal chart.

 

**Aries –** The rest of July is a time where things are slowing down. Three retrogrades are hitting at once (Mercury goes retrograde on the 18^(th)). he rest of July brings a notable slowdown for you, Aries, with three retrogrades hitting at once (Mercury goes retrograde on the 18th). You might feel exhausted or angry as tensions from Chiron, the sun, and Pluto peak around the 18th. Power struggles are possible, so wisely choose what's worth fighting for and what you can simply release. With Uranus in your house of communication combined with Mercury retrograde, you're being asked to examine how you interact with others. Be mindful of a tendency to be impulsive with your words or even tell people off this month, especially over the next three to four weeks. Overall, Uranus will be more favorable than harmful if you flow with change rather than against it.

Use the 19th and 20th to get work done or earn extra money. The sun moving into Leo on the 22nd will energize you, bringing a welcome sigh of relief now that it's out of Cancer and no longer squaring your sign. That square likely left you feeling irritable, tired, or just fed up with B.S.

Use this retrograde cycle to review your goals and focus on the nitty-gritty details, rather than rushing into new projects. Also, allow yourself time to pause and savor all you've accomplished this year. These retrogrades could be restorative if you shift your focus to being present and bringing awareness to how you feel versus the constant urge to ""do.""

The New Moon in Leo on July 24th is particularly good for you, Aries, highlighting your 5th house of children, play, performance, and creativity. This is your cue to take a vacation or a day off to truly enjoy yourself! You've been working hard with Saturn in your sign, so now is the time to relax and have some fun. This moon is highly compatible with your energy, boosting your creativity and overall zest. Just be aware that the last week of the month could be stressful, so prioritize self-care and get rest when needed.  
  


**Taurus –** Uranus has moved off of your sun/rising and moved into Taurus’ 2^(nd) house of finances and values, where it will stay for a few months before it comes back around to your sign. While this offers some breathing room, be mindful of your spending. Most Taurans appreciate creature comforts, but with Uranus bringing instability, you might find yourself spending more than planned over the next few years. Fortunately, Venus in this house for the rest of the month could work in your favor, possibly bringing unexpected extra money your way.

Uranus can bring “feast or famine” energy in the money houses, so there could be unexpected windfalls or extra expenses you weren’t prepared for. However, Uranus in the 2^(nd) affects more than just your money; it highlights your personal values and could indicate a shift in priorities until 2033. This month, reflect on what truly matters to you: what people or possessions are indispensable? How can you better protect them or show your loved ones how much they mean to you?

If you’ve been thinking about starting a side hustle, do it by the 16^(th) or wait until Mercury is out of retrograde (it begins on July 18^(th) and ends on August 11^(th)). The exception would be if you are selling used/salvaged items or your business involves making repairs. Those industries tend to do well during Mercury retrogrades, but wait to get your business license and paperwork done after August 11^(th) to minimize risk.

Mercury Retrograde highlights your 4^(th) house of home, family, and ancestry. You may be communicating more with loved ones, catching up with those you haven’t spoken to in months or years. Be prepared for delays and mishaps with communication or technology. Leave your plans flexible so you won’t be disappointed if something gets postponed.

The last week or so of the month could bring stress as the sun enters Leo and planets align in air and fire signs. You might encounter unsolicited advice or criticism, particularly from family, since Leo falls in your house of home. Or, some of you may feel overwhelmed/exhausted trying to juggle too much. It's crucial to pause, reflect, and stay present.

Consider treating yourself to a massage, hot bubble baths, or a night out at your favorite restaurant. Remember, other people's emergencies and drama don't have to become your own. Use the Leo New Moon on the 24th for protection, releasing, and banishing spells, along with any spell work involving your home or family, such as healing for parents/children or a home blessing.



**Gemini –** This is your time to shine, Gemini! With Uranus newly in your sign and Venus still present, seize the next couple of days to launch new plans or make major purchases. After Mercury goes retrograde on July 18th (until August 11th), your focus will shift to finishing existing projects, and revising or repairing what needs attention.

Your natural charm and beauty are amplified by Venus right now, even if you don't notice it. Uranus, the planet of surprises, might make you feel a bit frazzled, eccentric, or inspire a personal reinvention, bringing forth unique creative ideas. You'll feel more willing to let your talents show and share your quirky ideas.

While Mars in Virgo might bring some tension—perhaps requiring you to reorganize your space, tackle overdue paperwork, or deal with challenging family news—you're well-supported by Saturn and Neptune in Aries and Mercury in Leo, positioning you to weather whatever arises.

Mercury, your ruler, retrograding in your communication house means you might find you need to repeat things or take more care when explaining your ideas. You could also impulsively say something you later regret. Be mindful of this. It's especially **not the time for you to buy major electronics like computers or phones** unless your old one is beyond repair, and avoid signing contracts if possible. If you must sign, have multiple lawyers and/or accountants review it, as anything set in stone now is prone to hidden loopholes or issues requiring revisions later. While we generally advised against these during Mercury retrograde cycles, it is emphasized *much more strongly this year* because Mercury is in your 3^(rd) house. Avoid the confusion and the mess.

Speaking of your 3^(rd) house of communication, the sun will enter it on July 22^(nd). This is a favorable place for it to be because the sun shines brightly in Leo, and it’s a favorable sign to you. If you’re trying to expand your social media reach or do business advertising, this could be a good month to do it, just be mindful of that retrograde. If you’re single and looking to join a dating app, be mindful that it may be harder to connect with someone now (due to plans being frequently postponed or cancelled), or they may not be what they seem.

This month does offer a lovely grand air trine from the 28th to the 31st, activating your 1st, 4th, and 10th houses, potentially bringing good career news or even a family wedding invitation. However, some squares in the mix mean blessings might come with a side of stress, exhaustion, or annoying people. Mars in your house of home and family, squaring Venus, could also lead to minor disagreements or sad family news, especially with the retrogrades stirring things up.

With three retrogrades in play, you might feel like you're operating slower than usual, and that's perfectly fine. Allow yourself more time and space to accomplish tasks, and keep your plans flexible.

 

**Cancer –** The sun and Jupiter in your sign is bringing a lot of attention to yourself and how you’re feeling. You may be noticed more right now or find yourself thinking about yourself, your body, your feelings and needs. The sun stays in your sign until July 22^(nd), when it moves over to Leo and your 2^(nd) house of finances and values.

Speaking of your 2^(nd) house, I should mention that Mercury goes retrograde in Leo on the 18^(th) and will move backwards over the next three weeks. This is going to highlight communication around your finances, possessions, and your core values. You could be re-evaluating your money or your priorities right now. This is a good time for you to repair older or damaged belongings, clean up your credit report, re-evaluate your investments, and to revise your financial and business goals. If you’re thinking about a new job, this would be a good month to network with former co-workers as Mercury retrograde favors connecting with old friends or family that you haven’t seen in a while.

The planet Uranus has entered Gemini, bringing some unexpected news your way, probably around your health or a loved one’s health. This is a long 7–8-year cycle, and because the 12^(th) house can rule bed rest, hospitals, and also lost items, it’s important to follow up on any lingering health issues. You may need scans, ultra sounds, or examinations. The 12^(th) house rules the health of loved ones, so you may hear news about the health of close family and friends. Be careful when travelling to double-check that you have all belongings with you as Uranus in your 12^(th) could also show up as lost or missing items (especially when traveling by airplane or bus as Uranus rules airplanes and car engines).

This month, Mars is visiting your house of communication. You may be a little more assertive or to-the-point in your communications with others right now. You may not have as much patience for long, meandering stories or beating-around-the-bush. Be aware of giving unsolicited advice this month as you may get some pushback, with Mars opposing Saturn and squaring Venus.

There could be some tension the last week of the month as the planets are making several squares and oppositions. While there will be a harmony between Uranus, Pluto, and Mars, the other planets won’t be getting along, which may bring up some stress or frustration.

Use the Leo full moon for money spells or career spells as you will have planets in these areas of your chart. You could also do a road opener spell to clear away blockages and open up new avenues to you. Just wait to take action on NEW plans and goals until August 12^(th), if you can, to be away from the chaos of the Mercury retrograde.

 

**Leo –** Leo, the chart is lighting up for you, my friend! Mercury is in your sign, bringing lots of communication/chatter your way. Early Leos will be celebrating their birthday and reveling in the summer fun and extra attention. The sun will be leaving your house of mental health and bedrest and entering it’s home, LEO, on July 22^(nd).

While there will be planets favorable to you this month in Gemini and Aries, you are still dealing with tensions from Pluto, which is pushing early Leo’s to redefine who they are and come to a deeper understanding of self. Uranus in Gemini supports you in making these needed changes because it’s now in a friendly angle to your sun. So don’t be afraid to flow WITH change and anticipate it, rather than fighting against it.

The New Moon in your sign gives you the opportunity to visualize your dreams and claim what you want to manifest. There will be a bit of tension between Mars and Venus on this day and Pluto will oppose the new Moon, but you can still use this powerful time toward your goals. There is one caveat though, Mercury and Saturn retrograde are indicating that it’s not a good time to launch a new business, buy electronics, or to buy/sell a home right now. Wait until after August 11^(th).

If a house absolutely needs to be sold as soon as possible, then just be prepared for a lot of back and forth negotiations and if you’re the seller, you might encounter some flaky buyers or delays with the realtor/escrow company. Just be flexible and consult an expert if needed.

The last week of the month has both a grand air trine and squares. You could be feeling moody or irritable around the 30^(th) or 31^(st). The grand air trine will support you, but the energy between the 28^(th) to 31^(st) is a bit chaotic overall.

I should mention that plans may get postponed, cancelled, or revised over the next three weeks. Allow extra time if hosting birthday festivities away from home. You may get last minute cancellations, but don’t worry too much about it, that’s pretty par for the course during Mercury retrograde cycles.

 

**Virgo –** Virgo friends you’ve been dealing with Mars in your sign. This could either energize you or exhaust you as it pushes you to move at a faster pace than you are used to. The next two weeks could be a bit challenging for you as there will be a lot of fire and air planets that are not at a complimentary angle to your sign.

Since your ruler, Mercury, is going retrograde on July 18^(th), keep your plans flexible, and wait to purchase any electronics or major appliances. It’s best not to sign any contracts (that are not simple renewals) during this time as there could be something in the fine print that trips you up later or the agreement may need to be revised down the road.

This month, take a deep breath and practice some self-care. There is a lot going on around you, with T-Squares and tense aspects over the next couple of weeks. It ould just be that you are super busy at work with Venus and Uranus in your 10^(th) house of career. Don’t be surprised if there is some kind of big shakeup around your career this year or next year.

Try to keep your schedule light over the next three weeks if you can, so you have down time to decompress and re-center yourself. These squares aren’t inherently bad; sometimes we need friction in order to get things moving – or to motivate us to get out of a crappy situation. Just know that there could be more pressure on you right now than you’re used to.

The New moon on the 24^(th) falls in Leo, which is your 12^(th) house of bed rest, hospitals, mental health, psychic vision, and family’s health. You might be getting more health news than usual during this retrograde, or you may have to slow down and take days off to see to your mental health.

If you are interested in psychic development, this month would be a great time to practice energy work exercises, psychic development, or meditation. Mercury gives you added intuition and mental fortitude for occult work. Use this new moon for mental health spells or shadow work, psychic development, healing spells for family, releasing, and banishing. If you’re seeking to go into therapy, this could be a time where you put out a call for a good therapist or mental health professional. Or, if you’ve had trouble sleeping and need to get a sleep study done, that would be also highlighted now.

Leo also rules the heart, children, and play. Maybe you can use this time to do something fun – take a vacation, go to an amusement park, or a summer concert. Create some art or spend some time with children. Tune in to what your heart is telling you that it needs. Be present with it and listen to its wisdom.

 

**Libra –** Dear Libra, I know some of you have felt like you've been hit from multiple sides, with Jupiter and the sun in Cancer squaring you and Saturn and Neptune opposing your sign. You're exhausted and definitely need a break—hang in there! On the bright side, your ruler Venus is in Gemini, and Uranus has also entered Gemini, bringing spontaneity and surprises that mostly work in your favor due to an excellent trine. You'll also benefit from a grand trine in air signs toward month-end.

However, some tension from the sun and Jupiter, plus Mars inconjunct your sign, might zap your energy and willpower. You could find people unexpectedly irritable or rude, and even your renowned charm might hit its limits. It's crucial to center yourself right now. Between social invitations, work demands, and relationship tensions, prioritize self-care and carve out time just for you this summer.

Mercury will be retrograde from July 18th-August 11^(th). This is likely to involve a flurry of communication from friends. It’s not a good time to buy any electronics or sign any important contracts, if you can help it. Mercury retrograde can cause travel delays, postponed or cancelled plans, and technology issues. Since this is not in a square or opposition to you, I see you weathering things pretty well, but be cautious of having to sign work contracts or partnership agreements!

The sun moves into Leo on July 22nd, which is much more aligned with your energy and boosts your spirit. Things will flow a little more once it does, though there will be a few days when the sun opposes Pluto in Aquarius, so you might notice others around you stressing out as this is lightly to impact your friend circle or social organizations. There may be some drama or power struggles. I don’t see you being too heavily affected, other than through hardships on your friends. But the work drama could have you wanting to pop some popcorn and watch the sparks flying.

The New Moon in Leo on July 24th highlights your house of friends and opposes Pluto in your house of children, play, and fun. This makes it ideal for spells supporting friends or children, or encouraging a friendship to blossom into romance. There’s a grand air trine for early Librans, making it a good time for spells to increase social activity or build momentum toward a big personal goal. Just wait until after August 11th to launch any major new ventures to avoid Mercury retrograde chaos.

The last four to five days of the month might feel scattered and chaotic, with several squares despite the supportive grand trine. You might notice heightened stress or anxiety in those around you. While I don't foresee any major direct hits to you, if difficulties arise, remind yourself that this, too, shall pass!

I’m the founder of a new platform called Purple, and I wanted to share how this all started — and where we’re headed.

🎧 From Music to Momentum

Growing up, I was obsessed with music. I didn’t know it back then, but listening to songs on repeat until I knew every word was the start of something deeper. Eventually, I started making my own music and collaborating with others.

College was never optional in my household (shoutout to Nigerian parents), so I ended up at Virginia Tech. And that’s where everything really began.

⸻

🚨 The Entrepreneurial Itch

Between classes, I met other artists and producers — we made music, threw shows, and started building something special. We rented out pizza shops, community centers, and even frat house backyards.
Lights, fog machines, real flyers — we weren’t just doing shows. We were building a scene.

And people showed up. A lot of them. It felt like we were creating something that people actually needed.

⸻

💡 The Idea for Purple

After hosting multiple sold-out shows, it hit me:

Why is it still this hard to bring people together in real life?

We were jumping between Instagram, Eventbrite, Canva, Google Forms — it felt like duct-taping the internet together just to create community.

So I started building Purple:
A platform that gives creators, organizers, and community builders the tools they need to bring people together — all in one place.

Think: Eventbrite x early Instagram, but built for authenticity.

⸻

🚀 Where We’re At Now

We started building Purple in February 2025. We’re now in July, five months later, and we’re this close to our beta launch.

We’ve had no outside funding, just late nights, coffee, and belief. And now the product is real.

⸻

🫱🏽‍🫲🏽 Why I’m Sharing This

Because I always found posts like these helpful — and I want to return the favor.

Also:
If you’re building something and feel like you don’t know what you’re doing — same. But I’m learning as I go. And it’s actually working.

In the words of Steve Jobs:

“Everything around you was built by people no smarter than you.”

So if you’re on the fence about building — just start.

⸻

We’re opening up early access soon. If you want to follow along, test the product, or just see what happens — I’d love to have you.

Early 2023 it was 5.6, late 2024 it was 5.9, and it is now 6.1. My activity level has stayed fairly consistent throughout this period. I am a construction worker, so stay fairly active at work and we do an evening dog walk every day after dinner. I am 5'9 and weigh 175, down from 185 in early 2023 (I attribute the weight loss to reducing my alcohol intake)

In early 2023 I was drinking more heavily, typically 4-6 beers per day. By late 2024 I had cut down to 12 a week, which I have continued to present (although I have gone from Modelo to premium European beers).

The only consistent dietary change between late 2024 and now is switching to breakfast burritos (detailed below) from an Everything bagel with cream cheese, although I might also be eating slightly more sweets.

Typical Diet:

Breakfast: egg, Spanish rice, shredded cheese and salsa on whole wheat tortilla, coffee with 1/2 & 1/2 

First snack: lightly salted almonds and approx. 3 oz. cheese, Equate diabetic care chocolate shake

Lunch: turkey and cheese sandwich with mayo/Sriracha on whole wheat toast, single serving bag of potato chips, fun size candy bar

Second snack: Cajun trail mix

Sample dinners:

Pork tenderloin with roasted Brussels sprouts and rolls

Shredded bbq chicken (no sugar added bbq sauce) on baked potatoes

Breaded and fried pork chops with side salad

Shrimp alfredo with garlic bread

Chicken fried rice

In addition to this I typically drink 12 beers a week. Sometimes less, very rarely more. Usually two in the evening, occasionally one or none.

On the weekend I might have a few spoonfuls of ice cream or another fun size candy bar or two. Once or twice a month I might have a fast food milkshake, or I might go a couple months without. We rarely eat out, but if we do it is typically fast food as part of a road trip, maybe every other month.

I am hoping to see where I can improve my diet to address this trend in the wrong direction. Any and all input/advice is appreciated and I will do my best to respond to any questions/clarifications promptly.",2,1752633800.0,prediabetes,9,1.0,False

What did you do?,"I was at a traditional meeting today which I've been to before but very rarely attend. There was a very small group of us including a newcomer who just hit 30 days sober. The newcomer suggested that we talk about the first step, and we did, and everything was going well until the last gentleman's share. I'll call him 'the missionary'. The missionary leaned real hard into trusting God and praying in his share, and was basically talking directly to the newcomer God and prayer over and over again. Honestly this stuff happens at a traditional meeting and if it had only gone that far I wouldn't be too bothered.

After the meeting the missionary continued to talk to this newcomer, but then the talk got more and more intense. I didn't hear everything he said but I did hear things like ""Jesus Christ died on the cross for you"" and ""Once you get Baptized in my church you will be a new man and all your troubles will melt away"" he invited him to his church and his Bible study. He probably talked to the newcomer for a solid 15-20 minutes about converting him to his religion. 

Another atendee at the meeting muttered to me that the missionary ""tries to convert people all the time"" and that ""some people are sicker than others"" By now my blood is boiling because I feel like the missionary is preying upon a newcomer who may not be in the best headspace to get him to see God his way, and in my opinion even traditional AA isnt about that.

I came up with a couple excuses to stick around, drank more coffee and caught up with the newcomer in the parking lot after the other guy had finally left. I was far more diplomatic than I really wanted to be, but I told the newcomer that ""while I respect that guy's passion, and he seemed friendly, that in AA God can be whatever you want it to be, if anything at all"" because honestly I don't want to sell my beliefs(or nonbeliefs) in that situation either. The newcomer thanked me for my concern, and told me that he was raised Jewish and doesn't know what he believes, and he intends to explore that, but it won't be at the missionaries Bible study or church. Which i was happy to hear

1m116eb,https://www.reddit.com/r/okstorytime/comments/1m116eb/i_married_amarantha_i_barely_survived/,I Married Amarantha. I Barely Survived.,"

Let me preface this with a warning: if you’re the kind of person who reads BookTok, drinks aggressively medium roast coffee, and thinks red flags are a suggestion—this is your story. Or mine. I'm Rhys. 32. Male. Once naïve. Now seasoned like a cast iron skillet that’s been through a few grease fires.

This all kicked off back in 2021. But rewind a bit: Amarantha (32F) and I have known each other since high school. Same neighborhood. Same awkward teenage friend groups. She got married young to a guy who was such a piece of work he skipped town and life itself before their divorce was finalized. So technically, she's a widow. I’d been through my own brand of trauma—which I won’t unpack here, for your mental health and mine—but suffice to say, when we reconnected, sparks flew. Or maybe that was a red flare. Who can say?

We dated for six whirlwind months before getting married. Quick wedding, normal family chaos. Then she took a “find-myself” trip to Europe, which sounds fun until you find out she was drugged by some of her travel companions and came home with a concussion and a whole new personality: emotionally volatile with a side of gaslight.

It started slow. A jab here, a dig there. But over time, she stopped pulling punches. She’d twist open the wounds of my past and salt them like a line cook at Red Lobster. Yet, paradoxically, when I was at my lowest, she’d console me—like a fireman lighting the match and then handing you the hose.

That emotional whiplash? It gave her control. Full-on isolation mode. She excommunicated me from my own family, moved us across state lines, and slowly turned my life into a hostage situation where the ransom was my sense of self.

By 2019 (yes, we’re time-skipping like a bad Netflix miniseries), we were in couples therapy. Eight therapists, to be exact. They all saw the same thing: I was doing everything I could and she was constantly shifting the goalposts. We finally found a therapist who said the same thing as the others, but with just the right phrasing to not make Amarantha feel ""attacked."" Progress, right?

Naturally, we celebrated with the worst decision two broken Millennials could make: we had a baby to save the marriage.

Enter Nyx—our daughter, my light, my anchor, the only genuinely good thing to come out of this emotional FEMA site of a relationship. Amarantha nearly died during the pregnancy, which understandably changed her, but she weaponized that bitterness like a dagger made of unpaid therapy bills. I did everything—night feeds, diaper runs, mental health check-ins—but nothing was enough. The goalposts? Gone. We're not even playing the same sport anymore.

Oh, and if you thought this was going to stay a two-player game—think again.

Amarantha is bisexual and had always manipulated our dynamic, holding threesomes with women over my head like some twisted ""if you're a good boy, maybe"" reward chart. Fast forward to 2021: she meets Celestina at her new job. They hit it off. Then she suggests a throuple. That’s right: a three-way relationship where we’re all dating each other.

Shockingly, it kind of worked—for like a minute. We had a wild night together (and yes, it was as mind-blowing as the 17-year-old me would’ve dreamed). But just as we started house-hunting, Celestina flipped the narrative. Suddenly, I was the financial deadweight, the reason we were “bleeding money.” Spoiler: I had receipts. Literally. We were in the green and saving.

But Amarantha? She chose chaos. And Celestina.

I was slowly pushed out of my own marriage. And here's where the universe—finally, blessedly—stepped in: Celestina had a mental breakdown and was admitted for psychiatric care. (That part sounds awful, and I don’t wish that on anyone, but I won’t lie: I was relieved.) With Celestina sidelined, Amarantha briefly snapped back to reality.

We moved back to our home state, tried therapy again, but it was too late. We divorced.

The divorce? She came at me swinging with accusations, emotional manipulation, and revisionist history. But when I laid out financial proof that she had been attempting to control and trap me for years, we settled. Split everything 50/50. She kept what was hers, I kept mine, and I made it very clear that if she wanted to get ugly, I would match her energy and then some.

But here’s the best plot twist of all: the house? Never in my name. Which meant my credit stayed clean when Celestina, still legally bound to Amarantha on the mortgage, stopped paying. Despite four failed attempts to remove Amarantha from the paperwork, it never went through. And now, Amarantha is financially trapped in a burning building she helped design.

Call it karma. Call it divine irony. I call it closure.

She’s now married to a guy named Jurian and, from what I hear, barely keeping her head above water. Do I feel bad? Not really. I was a placeholder until she found someone new. She used my body, drained my soul, and dipped.

It’s been three years since we split. I'm rebuilding. I've made some questionable choices—like dating someone we’ll call Nesta, who was so damaged by past relationships she thought basic kindness was manipulation. That ended with me being shoved down a flight of stairs. Fun times.

So yeah, some red flags were obvious. Some were written in neon across the sky. But did you see where this story was headed? Or did you, like me, hope—just for a moment—that this might have ended in healing and growth?

Spoiler: It didn’t.

But I did survive. I’m still here. And to quote one of the few good things to come out of this mess:

She is the owner of several daycares (Texas) and the director of the newest location. A child at her school pulled a cup of hot coffee onto themself that was left on the counter by a teacher visiting the class. The director was not present in the class when it happened. When she was informed of the incident she assessed the injury by removing the child’s shirt, applying neosporin (with the parents permission) and calming the child. She fed her lunch  and helped her sleep. She promptly terminated the teacher and self reported to licensing. The issue is that the parents weren’t notified to pick up the child until about 2.5 hours after the incident. The severity of the burn was not immediately apparent as there was no blistering and the parents were contacted quickly after to get permission to apply the Neosporin. Because of this she was found as Reason to believe medical neglect and has been barred from stepping foot at the school as well as any of her other locations. (Background check was changed to ineligible). She has an administrative review date approaching to fight the medical neglect finding and has an attorney helping her. She must prove that she is not guilty of medical neglect. Has anyone else been in this situation? What was the outcome?

Bit of a long one, but important if you want to see the realities of being a healthcare worker. 

For context, I’m a nurse at a tertiary-level hospital, and have been for the last 5-ish years. While I have been known to run my mouth a bit, I’ve never had any conflicts with any of my coworkers, and am known to be a hard worker and reliable partner to have on duty. I have put in HUNDREDS of hours of overtime in my career at this hospital, even pulling 24-hour shifts (illegal in my location, but approved by hospital management) to compensate for the poor management decisions made by my manager. 

My manager used to be my direct supervisor working on the ward. To say we didn’t get along would be an understatement. She was determined to become a manager, and was willing to throw every innocent nurse under the bus in order to get there. She would be praised for her cutting of costs for the ward, but she did it by purposefully leaving shifts with 4 nurses for 30+ SICK patients (on many occasions), despite having a number of nurses reaching out and asking to come in to work in order to help. She denied their requests to help every time, and both the patients and us nurses suffered. Her routine practice of denying nurses from picking up shifts was the sole reason I had to pull numerous 24-hour shifts; I’d reached out a WEEK in advance and messaged every single day that week reminding her that I was available to be moved to a critically short-staffed shift. Every time, I was denied. I ended up being an extra staff member on my scheduled shift, with the dayshift having no staff. 

We never got along because I would routinely call her out on her BS. I wouldn’t be crazy about it, but I never hesitated to speak out about the unfair decisions she made and how her actions were burning us out faster than we could recover. 

Our patients were suffering, and her decisions as a supervisor put everyone into unsafe situations just so she could make HER boss happy. 

Imagine putting a random INFECTIOUS non-surgical patient into a 4-bed room on a surgery floor, when you have the power to request a more appropriate patient. 

Imagine knowing a nurse is too busy to receive report on a patient coming from the recovery room, so instead of waiting, you tell the patient to come anyways and leave the nurse stranded with a patient they know nothing about, are completely unprepared for, and are unable to even take their vital signs because they are TOO BUSY, LIKE THEY SAID THEY WERE. 

Regardless, I love the ward I work on. My coworkers are like my family, and I enjoy working with the patient population on my ward. (For context, we are a specialty ward and we are the ONLY floor with these surgeries/patients). 

Ever since my supervisor became my manager, I’ve been “reported” for many different ridiculous concerns that have NEVER been brought up to me by my coworkers (who are supposedly reporting these concerns about me). The latest? I was allegedly seen entering a patient’s room WITHOUT A STETHOSCOPE VISIBLE at some point in my 12-hour shift. 
For the record, I wear a fanny pack at work where I keep my stethoscope when I’m not using it. 

Another one: I was reported being seen sitting in the nursing station, and it was “too soon” after I began assessing my patients. A nurse?! Sitting in the NURSING station?!? 

I came out of nursing school in the heart of COVID, and with my manager’s practices of screwing over the nurses meant that I had to become fast at my job in order to survive. Let me be clear: I do NOT skip parts of my job in order to get by. I complete every task of my job (with a smile); I just do it quickly. 

Ridiculous, right? But these are the types of “concerns” I’ve been investigated for. 
Now for the issue at hand. 

It’s extremely difficult to be approved for time off thanks to my lovely manager. I think her favorite words are, “Aw, no. That’s too bad though.” 

My niece’s first birthday was coming up, and I had to buy a plane ticket at the last minute seeing as I had to try and swap multiple shifts around in order to get the time off. It took a lot of bargaining with my coworkers and me agreeing to a number of terrible shifts in order to accomplish getting the time off, but I managed to do it! I booked my ticket, and my brother was ecstatic to hear I’d be able to make it to his daughter’s first birthday. I live 13 hours away, so this would also be the first time I’d be able to even meet her. 

The week of her birthday arrives, and I realize that I had been approved for a shift that week that I completely forgot I had bid on. Panic mode: ACTIVATED. I did everything I could to get the shift off; I even requested to use some of my banked overtime hours and remaining vacation hours in order to cover for the shift. 

Guess what my manager’s response was?

You guessed it: no. 

Why, you ask? Because the request was put in within the same week. 

(Keep in mind, though: we cannot submit requests for anything more than 14 days in advance! Basically: automatic no unless you’re a superstar who has the time to submit the request within those 6 days. As a busy nurse, this is impossible.)

I even submitted a request to use my union-gifted personal hours in order to get this shift off. 

You already know what response I got. 
I exhausted every option I had. I’d already paid over $2000 for the plane ticket home, and it was non-refundable at that point. I was stuck with a single 8-hour shift in an otherwise now-empty work week. A single 8-hour shift in an administrative nursing job (we don’t see patients in person) stopping me from meeting my beautiful niece and witnessing her very first birthday on this earth.

So I did what any human would do: I called in sick for the shift. 

Don’t get me wrong, I know the whole kabab about “time theft” and the importance of only using sick time when you’re actually sick. I tried every single thing I could to get rid of the shift using the proper channels. 

My brother and I grew up in a horribly abusive home, so the fact that he had children and is a good dad was a miracle for him. Those babies turned his life around, and are the only reason we were able to work on repairing our relationship. 

Seeing that miracle baby’s first birthday (a literal once-in-a-lifetime event) was not an option for me. So yeah, I called in sick for a single shift. 

Unfortunately, I was scheduled for a meeting with my manager on that day (which would take me from my shift in order to attend). I made sure to let her know that I wouldn’t be able to attend and we would need to reschedule. In addition to being “sick”, the required union rep for the meeting wasn’t able to attend either. In summary: no union rep= no meeting. So, even if I HAD worked, I still would have had to reschedule due to not having a union rep present. I made it very clear to my manager that my calling in sick was in NO WAY related to our meeting, and that I would like to reschedule the meeting at her convenience. 

Jump to today:
I had a follow-up meeting with my manager. I was told my responses to their concerns (remember sitting in the NURSING station?) “didn’t make sense”, and I committed improper usage of my sick time. 

I was formally suspended from my job as a nurse for 2 shifts, and received a disciplinary letter as well. 

For calling in for a single shift using my accumulated sick time. 

During a nursing staffing crisis. 

Now, I’m not dumb. I’ll admit I wasn’t sick. However, being SUSPENDED for calling in for a single shift? I’ve never improperly used my sick time in the past, so this was a first offence. No warning, just straight to suspending me. 

To be frank, I’m convinced my manager has it out for me. All of these accusations that have been reported about me are ridiculous (and not illegal, to boot) and have never had a face behind them. My manager refuses to disclose who reports these things (fair enough), but conversations with my coworkers revealed nothing but shock and having no idea what I was talking about. I’m a very approachable person, so I have no doubt that they would feel comfortable telling me concerns they had. In fact, I make it a point to tell them to tell me if I’m doing something sketchy or annoying so I can fix it. 

I’ve already talked to the union rep, and I’ve decided I’m going to dispute the suspension given by my manager and request another investigation by the nursing union. In that investigation, my manager will be forced to provide actual documented evidence in regard to the behaviours I’ve been accused of. 

Now, I’m laying on my couch in my PJs with my cats watching trashy reality TV pondering my life choices. The union rep recommended I change to a different department at work, but I love my current floor. As tiring and emotionally draining it is, I genuinely love my job and I do everything I can to properly care for my patients. Besides, I deserve better than being run off because my manager doesn’t like me. 

I was there when my coworkers sobbed in the supply rooms after witnessing horrible deaths. I was there to save the new grad nurses who were suddenly placed in charge of 30+ patients, when they themselves were just trying to survive through a shift. I was there holding my patient’s hand as they took their final breaths alone because their family wouldn’t stay with them. 

Where was my manager? Oh, her shift ended at 4pm, so she got to go home and leave all of us under the bus she drove into our ward. 

I know it’s a depressing tale, but it’s my reality. I’ve helped save hundreds of lives over the years, but seeing my niece have her first ever cupcake at her first birthday apparently makes me a terrible nurse worthy of suspension. I know some people will say, “No, it made you a bad employee”, but my job is different from others. My “job” is keeping people alive, not making reports or keeping profits up. I may be an employee, but my employer is a government healthcare system. 

Anyways, thanks for listening to my situation. I’m open to advice for how to move forward, even if it is just changing my mindset to help get rid of some of this anger I have. 

Side note: our gift for Nurse’s Week this year was an email that said, 
“We were going to gift you coffee, but you deserve far more than that.”
In the end, they never got us anything.

1m1152m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1m1152m/yearning_and_exhausted/,Yearning and exhausted,"I (24M) have been working full time and living on my own for a little over a year now. Growing up I never really got into a super committed relationship in either high school or college. There were a few talking stages but COVID and long distance shut those down quickly. 

In my time on my own, the desire for companionship has grown miserably intense in a manner that almost seems involuntary. Before anyone asks, no I don’t place all of my self worth in being in a relationship. I have plenty of things to do on my own, but recently it’s begun to feel pointless, because at the end of the day what I really want is someone to share the things I love with, and hopefully they’d want to do the same for me. As an introvert I have a harder time meeting new people, as I don’t have a strong social circle in my town at the moment. I’ve been trying to go out to bars and coffee shops by myself, just to show that I’m open to meeting people, but this feels so unnatural to me at a soul level. So I find myself in a really awkward place where I feel like I have to play a character to find what I’m looking for, but that would in essence by lying to everyone I meet thereafter. On top of all of it, full time work is hard to juggle a social life with, and I many times have to triage personal tasks like cooking and cleaning over trying to go out and be social, which makes the issue worse in my head. 

I haven’t tried dating apps yet, for a couple reasons. I’m 5’6” and average looking (straight btw) in a rather problematic location for dating apps (small population, skewed to higher age range). I only hear bad things about them for guys but I guess it’s the only other play on the playbook. 

TL;DR I have been yearning to find a romantic connection with someone, and have been frustrated with how it feels like being myself is some sort of road block to doing so. ",1,1752633207.0,Vent,1,1.0,False
