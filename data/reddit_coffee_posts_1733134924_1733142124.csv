Hello, Dr. Coplan.



I just had a chat with Dr. Garrett,



I'd love to address the medication issue sooner rather than later. Yes, they're so many adverse effects (sexual dysfunction). But we decided reducing the Invega and potentially going into full-blown psychosis during the Coronavirus pandemic might not be wise. Meaning, I don't want to wind up in the hospital, then get Corona.





When society becomes more stable because I've made a lot of progress with Dr. Garrett, I hope we can tweak something and see how I do on fewer meds. I suspect I'll be fine.



Dr. Coplan's Email:

May 15, 2020, 4:43‚ÄØPM

OK Andrew we can certainly consider testing out how well you are on lower meds. However, my observation is that we are already having several ""psychotic"" episodes that through the help of cognitve reframing and meds you are thankfully able to navigate your way out of.  Some of the manic features of thesse episodes can be induced by rapid caffeine intake in large amounts, which we agreed was not an ideal strategy.    The problem is that the delusions invariably entail nefarious action on behalf of one or both parents. When I first met you, your mother recounted how you had spent several inpatient admissions delusionally convinced you had been abused by your parent(s) as a child and would yell out this revelation to all comers.  So it is a precarious line we are dealing with and the ""original delusion""  is still regularly retreived.  I need to discuss this with Dr Garrett but I dont share the sense that you are safely situated and well removed from the delusions.  An important component of these delusions is their inevitable necessity to be widely ""announced"" in an attempt to correct the ""wrongs"" of the past.  This makes the delusions non-benign as even if you come out of them you have communicated them with full conviction to any available audience.  With consequence.  That being said it is to your credit that you have continued being perfectly compliant with this unweildly combination of meds and their upsetting side effects. 



As I say I need to discuss the state of the delusions with Dr Garrett before endorsing that lowering the meds is a low risk exercise clinically.



SIncerely



Dr Coplan 



My Email:

May 15, 2020, 5:06‚ÄØPM

Yes, I've been perfectly compliant with my meds since 2011/2012. Actually, I'm afraid being on a mega regimen for this long can be carcinogenic. But I'm also aware it's helping. Everyone says the meds are well-researched and they're many people at the Fountain House who've been on meds their whole life, and they're in their 60's, are continuing to have a lengthy life.





While the Coronavirus is happening, it wouldn't be wise to risk a hospitalization by lowering my meds. Though, I suspect I'd be fine. I'd love to test it out as soon as we can.





With Dr. Garrett I've made a huge recovery and am able to recognize and come out of delusions now. I don't get completely lost in psychosis anymore. I'm not the same as I was back then. Because in 2011 I couldn't even verbalize it was a delusion. Now I'm able to explain the way my mind works. That's HUGE!





The coffee intake has reduced since the extreme days, I only have 3 cups a day. In fact, I tried to stop completely but got massive headaches and fatigue. So I still drink some.





If we do come down on meds it has to be done right. But first, let's get through this Coronavirus nightmare.

Andrew



I agree with the points Dr Coplan makes.  You are able to use your cognitive skills to pull yourself out of a nosedive into delusonal daydreaming much more effectively than used to be the case, but the idea that your parents are sadistic abusers is still very close to the surface still.  Your were caught up in these thoughts last week.  



Here is a metaphor.  You know when you go to the beach and try to stand up in the receding tide, but sometimes the tide knocks you over.   If you were to be on less medication and your biology started to catch you in a rip tide that knocked you down, it would be quite damaging to your recovery.  You have made definite progress in psychotherapy.  You are getting stronger psychologically.  But I would not recommend, especially now with hospitals preoccupied with COVID, that a risk be taken at this time.  



It is hard to pick one indicator of how strong you are psychologically, but the daydream that your mother takes pleasure in sexually abusing you is an important marker.  Since I have been working with you, though I don't keep a specific record of this, I think the longest you have gone without that delusion resurfacing is 10 days to 2 weeks.  The delusion fades more quickly than in the past, but it isn't gone.   It is still too close to the surface to take a risk now, frustrating as your situation is.  In a spirit of dark humor, which I know you enjoy, which would you prefer - sexual frustration or re-hospitalization?   I hope the former rather than the later.

I want to share something that completely changed my work life - mastering self-discipline. I know it sounds heavy, but stick with me here.

A few years ago, I was that person who'd get distracted by every notification, spend hours scrolling through social media, and leave important tasks until the last minute. Sound familiar? Trust me, I get it.

Here's what actually works (from someone who's been there):

1. Start Small, Like Really Small
Don't try to transform your entire work routine overnight. I started with just 25 minutes of focused work, followed by a 5-minute break. It's called the Pomodoro Technique, and it's a game-changer. Your brain can handle 25 minutes of anything!

2. Create a Morning Routine That Actually Sticks
I used to roll out of bed and jump straight into work. Big mistake. Now, I have a simple morning routine: wake up at the same time, drink water, do a quick 10-minute workout, and plan my day. Nothing fancy, but it sets the tone.

3. The Two-Minute Rule
If something takes less than two minutes, do it immediately. Those quick emails? Handle them now. Small task piling up? Knock them out. This prevents the overwhelming buildup of tiny tasks that drain your energy.

4. Environment Matters More Than Willpower
I learned this the hard way - willpower isn't enough. I removed social media apps from my phone during work hours, started using website blockers, and created a dedicated workspace. Your environment should make it easier to stay focused, not harder.

Through my journey of building better work habits, I've found that tracking progress makes a huge difference. I actually created a free Daily Habit Tracker that's helped me and many others stay consistent. You can grab yours at https://theexcellenceeffect.com/ - it's something I wish I had when I started.

5. The Power of Consequences
Set up accountability systems. Tell your colleagues about your deadlines. Join work focus groups. When others know about your commitments, you're more likely to follow through.

6. Energy Management > Time Management
I noticed that my self-discipline tanks when I'm tired. Now, I schedule important tasks during my peak energy hours (morning for me) and save easier tasks for later. Figure out your peak hours and protect them fiercely.

7. The Five-Second Rule
When you feel resistance to starting a task, count backwards: 5-4-3-2-1, then start. Sounds simple, but it works by bypassing your brain's overthinking mode.

8. Reward Systems That Actually Work
Create meaningful rewards for staying disciplined. Mine is simple - if I stick to my focused work blocks all week, I treat myself to my favorite coffee shop on Friday. Find what motivates you.

Remember, self-discipline isn't about being perfect. It's about being consistent and getting back on track when you slip up. I still have days where I struggle, but the difference is now I have systems in place to help me recover quickly.

What helped me the most was building sustainable habits rather than relying on motivation. If you're serious about improving your work discipline, start tracking your habits today. The free tracker I mentioned earlier has been a game-changer for many people in our community.

My boyfriend (21M) has just got his engineering degree after doing 4 years post high school. I (23F) have just failed my paramedic degree.

Has anyone else had issues with Swiggy and their HDFC card auto-filling OTPs? I just got scammed twice in a row! Both times, orders were placed without my consent because the OTP auto-filled.

I didn't even realize anything was happening until I got two different delivery persons showing up at my door with two separate orders.

I called swiggy when it happened first time they didn't help saying it won't happen in future.

Again it happened yesterday still their customer support executive and senior executive provided no help at all.

Here's how it happened:  
I added products to cart and when to payments screen:  
Selected Swiggy HDFC Credit card and clicked continue to payment  
On HDFC bank's OTP screen, I manually entered OTP and clicked on submit  
Instead of taking me back to order confirmation page, the page itself refreshed and another OTP CAME making me think that maybe I mistyped OTP  
This time the app auto filled the OTP and took me to order confirmation page  
Then few minutes later there were two different delivery persons with same items who already marked order as delivered before me coming out of the door

I'm afib-free after a year. And this is after having pretty intense incidents, heartbeat hanging out above 200 BPM and other symptoms that had me going to the emergency room each time. Averaging about two times a year with lots of symptoms between. I am not taking any medication of any kind but have Dilt and Flec as pill in pocket just in case. Have not had to take them since a little over a year ago.

I had pretty rough reactions to pretty much every medicine I took for it, with Metoprolol causing issues with nearly every sector of my body and that I'm still feeling the effects of after being off that poison (for me) for well over a year. Metoprolol is now on my allergy list but I stayed on it three months ""to get used to it"" and it honestly seemed to have done more damage than the afib itself, and I suspected led to more episodes. My pill in pocket drugs, flec and dilt, were better but I was only able to handle them for a few weeks to a month before side effects like blurry vision and crushing depression got out of hand.

Because of sensitivity to heart meds and the intensity of my episodes, my doctor was on the verge of doing an ablation if I had another incident, but because I'm young for afib (39) actually advised we play it by ear (which is weird because the Internet says it's good to get ablations when younger). A year later and my body seems to be doing better on its own and the surrounding symptoms, like constant palpitations and weakness, seem to have gotten much better as well on their own, knock on wood. Now, I know what you're about to say. That Afib is progressive and doesn't just go away on its own. I have been exercising, but my diet has not changed much. If anything, I'm eating more and enjoying myself more with food than I had been while having the episodes. Against the current of Internet wisdom, and after my EP said it was okay, I started drinking coffee again immediately after my last incident a little over a year ago. Like the day after being discharged from the hospital. My EP had been saying there's no real evidence to confirm caffeine is a trigger for afib and actually said there are studies where caffeine helps treat afib.

Of course, I've only been drinking caffeine in moderation. But goodness was my quality of life better since I started drinking caffeine again. I had quit caffeine after being told by the internet that it was a trigger for afib and that I would feel much better after a while. Feeling better never happened, even after half a year. After half a year of having quit other than decaf, being miserable and under productive, and then still having an afib incident while off caffeine, I started drinking 1-2 cups of coffee per day and started feeling tons better just because of that. Still drinking it a year later, no afib. Working out but eating what I want (I never had a really poor diet to begin with, though).

All that being said, always consult one's doctor. Hopefully no one sees this and thinks it's okay to drink caffeine or eat what they like, within reason, without consulting their EP first. Also, likely very important in my case--there is a good chance my afib was caused or exacerbated by some mystery illness. I'd had respiratory issues leading up to my diagnosis. Suspect possibly it was related to long covid. Many of my respiratory and other odd symptoms like sugar sensitivity to where I had been getting tested for diabetes and thyroid constantly, have just as mysteriously mostly gone away after that last afib hospital visit a little over a year ago. And I'm not saying that afib won't come back for me, either, but I'll take what I've got now and enjoy it while it lasts. Even if it's a temporary vacation from hell, just knowing there's the possibility it can ""get better"" and be less frequent temporarily, and I can still enjoy things I love (in moderation), has done wonders for my mental health as well.",5,1733138481.0,AFIB,2,1.0,False

I‚Äôve recently started trying cigars, and it‚Äôs been such an interesting experience! In India, cigars aren‚Äôt that common‚Äîit‚Äôs usually cigarettes or sometimes hookah. But cigars always seemed cool to me, with the whole process of cutting, lighting, and just relaxing with one.



The first cigar I tried was a Romeo y Julieta No. 3. It was mild and pretty smooth, and I loved how the flavors changed as I smoked it. Since then, I‚Äôve been trying different types‚Äîsome with lighter wrappers, some darker‚Äîand even pairing them with coffee or whiskey (Glenfiddich 21 is my favorite).



I‚Äôve realized cigars are so different from cigarettes. You don‚Äôt inhale; you just enjoy the taste and the slow, calming experience. It‚Äôs a lot more about taking your time and appreciating the craftsmanship.



For anyone here who smokes cigars, what‚Äôs your favorite one? And do you have any tips for someone who‚Äôs still figuring it out?

Still cant read more than one chapter of a novel without being distracted, so focus and concentration arent there yet.

  
Day 2 of 50mg and I slept badly the night before.  But I did have breakfast with protein in, I havent done any serious sorts of exercise and haven't drank coffee yet. (the desire is growing stronger)

  
But I am still bibbling around the house, doing domestic stuff.  So, still functioning.

But every now and again, I get a wave of emotion come over me of needing my wife near me, so I can hug her and tell her that I love her soooo much!!

I do tell her that on a thrice-daily basis, so that isnt a change, but the emotion that goes with it is a wave of unexpectedness.

Also, I am feeling emotional about a tv show I just watched.  I empathised with the anti-hero!

Not just *""I like you because you are an arse""* but *""I understand why you are an arse and I feel sorry for you""*

  
Yesterday, I was feeling ropey and yet, still felt the urge to go and help my parents in law move furniture.  (My In laws are just awesome people anyway, so no change there if they ask for help)  
Normally gratitude from anyone is met with a typically stoic British *‚Äúno problem, happy to help‚Äù*

But the gratitude this time made me feel a little warm & fuzzy.

I just felt like I needed to help them & felt good doing it.

I have always struggled with identifying my emotions. (Had 3 years counselling to work on it)

","I (21F) am currently studying abroad. I've been here since September and I leave in 2 and a half weeks!

My freshman year of college, I had a friend (22M) Nick. Wild would be an understatement. Nick would always want to have sleepovers, go out on adventures, go party and flirt with guys, but would go MIA for days afterwards. It was frustrating because we had so much fun when he was actually around! Second semester, my mental health got bad. Nick had virtually ghosted me. He moved off of my floor and had brand new friends. I dropped out of school and moved back home. I never heard from him.

About a year ago, he reached out. He'd dropped out too. We called maybe twice to catch up, and he never had a clear answer for why he ghosted me. He was still across the country though, so I brushed it off as just a casual friend to send songs, reels, memes, etc to. We texted sporadically, mostly him spamming me, but I'd respond whenever I got the chance.

He knew I was studying abroad and had mentioned wanting to visit, but I never took Nick serious because he never was serious! Concrete plans were never a thing for him. I told him my parents were coming, then I had finals, and a trip, so I wasn't sure about my schedule. He didn't talk about it again, I didn't respond for awhile because I got busy. But last night he reached out: he was at the airport, boarding a flight to come see me?! He said he had no hotel, no return flight, so would it be a bother if he could stay with me for 1-2 weeks TBD?! I said no, of course.

I'm furious! We never made concrete plans. I never gave him a yes, only a maybe but barely that. I'm appalled he thinks he can fly 4,000 miles, drop back into my life, and stay with me, all after ghosting me during one of my hardest times, but I do wonder if part of me ""led him on"" with occasional texts here and there.

Some of my friends said to not respond at all, but I don't know if I want to fully ghost him. I think I could stomach maybe coffee or lunch, but I have finals and friends and he just expects me to be his tour guide all of a sudden. I'm angry and confused.",10,1733137880.0,AmItheAsshole,9,1.0,False

1h4sftx,https://www.reddit.com/r/EstrangedAdultChild/comments/1h4sftx/mum_dad_and_brother_all_make_me_feel_bad_about/,"Mum, dad and brother all make me feel bad about myself","For context, I'm 43, female and from UK. Parents divorced when I was 8, dad remarried 20 years ago ans mum never did. Brother been married 25 years. I have never married, no kids (through choice,  but have a small lovely group of respectful friends).

The relationship with my mum firstly,  has been very up and down over years as she can be emotionally manipulative and stone walls - saying some cruel things over the years. She lives on her own and I have been the one to go all out, when it comes to taking care of her, getting her special birthday gifts and sorting out everything when her sister died recently - my brother never lifted a finger.

The relationship with my dad was tumultuous after age of 19, where we didn't speak properly for 12 years then made contact. He's not an emotional guy and never says I love you or anything. He had a kid with his wife 24 years ago, and he got an awful lot more love, attention and support than my brother and I got when we were kids. His interest only really peaks in me really, if he's getting something out of it (i.e he wanted me to pick him up some duty free tobacco when I was in holiday recently,  and would make a point of reminding me about it two days before. I didn't get said tobacco in end and when I told him he basically ignored me for a week and replied 'I've calmed down now, is what it is""). 

As for my brother. He has become very bitter last 10 years. He's 51. I think he's going through mid life crisis or something,  but he has fell out with 2 other women in the family - our dearest auntie and his sister in law. He can be pretty hateful/hurtful in his comments and very dismissive. He's not an optimistic or supportive by any stretch. We fell out back in May due to a disagreement about my mother's 70th birthday meal costs.

There's so much more to it but it'd be war and peace lol.

I'd honestly be happier if I went NC with all of them. More often than not, I'm either trying to please them somehow,  or they're making me feel bad about myself (inadvertently or through sarcastic off the cuff remarks). 

Today is my birthday. Neither my mum or dad have text me yet when they normally do. My mum i think has an issue with me because I didn't want to have a coffee today (I only saw her a week ago, and we spent a week together in Marrakech- which was a gift from me to her for her 70th birthday). My dad clearly still holding a silly grudge over tobacco and as for my brother - he blocked me on Whatsapp months ago which I didn't realise until last month when I tried to text him about my uncle going into hospital (my mums brother).

So yeh, if feel a bit shit my mum, dad and brother are just not being- nice - i guess, and acting like petulant kids. 

Has anyone ever just gone 'fuck it, I can't be arsed with you all', and gone NC?

I tried a same recipe in the switch and the coffee was very empty. Then I tried extending the time steep or/and grinding finer, because AP is nobypass, so it may be a bit more effective. Brew was still not as good as in the aeropress.

Im 30 years old (male). My childhood was horrible. My father was a gambling, lying alcoholic. He always was drunk and we always had fights in our home.

It was never peaceful. He tormented my mother and brought a lot of stress to my grandma, whom both died of cancer and strokes and I attribute their deaths to him. They were wrecks because of the stress and anguish he brought.

This was all a couple of years ago. He started a new familie 8 years ago and has now 2 small girls with his new wife (ex).

I moved out rather quick nad have been in contact with him here and there, maybe once every 2-3 weeks.

I had a scratch on my car and went to a mechanic for a fix up. I told him about it and he said forget it that's way too much, lets drive to his homecountry (which is 4-5h away). He knows somebody that can fix it cheap.

I agreed and we went on friday. We slept in the house and gave the car to the mechanic the next day in the morning. He told us by 4 pm it should be finished.

My father told me to go home, he has to go somewhere. I agreed and went home. it was now 12 am and he came. I told him that I plan to drive home as soon as the car is done. He agreed, but said he has to go somewhere first and we can't just leave right away. We would have to at least get coffee with the mechanic afterwards since that is common here.

I asked him before he left, if he will return and get me, so we can pick up the car. He said yes.

I waited until 11 pm. Mind you, no one was living in this house since it's just for vacation. It was cold, very cold and no food was available since we didnt buy any because we (I) wanted to driver asap home.

It was almost midnight. He came with my car. I opened the door. He was DRUNK DRUNK. Completely wasted. I yelled at him why he drove MY car, wasted.

Then I saw, that he ran somewhere with my car, and both front sides have been wrecked. At this point I saw red.

I yelled so hard and wanted to kill him. He just stood there, not saying a word.

Then he started to cry. I was angrier. I calmed myself down and told him to get in the car, im driving home.

I packed our stuff, put him in the backseat and told him to go to sleep. I was sweettalking him so that he cooperates and gets to sleep.

So I drove with my car, 5h home in the middle of the night. I brought him in his apartement. He was still completetly wasted and couldn't even stand.

I said to my siblings that he is dead to me. That was 2 days ago. He didn't check up on me. Mind you I would've ignored it either way, I don't want to ever hear from him again. It's not the fact that my car is ruined. It can happen. But he drove it without my permision, drunk, and lied to me and left me over 12h alone, knowing there is no heating and food. For me, that is no father.

Some friends think that he forgot everything. I luckily have a video that I recorded in that moment.

I was so close to going to jail, but luckily I controlled myself.",1,1733136846.0,family,1,0.67,False

# Introduction to RankGPT

Hey there! Let's talk about something exciting in the world of websites and search engines. Have you heard of RankGPT? It's this new tool that's making waves in how we create and rank websites. Imagine being able to make a great-looking website and have it show up at the top of search results, all in less time than it takes to make a cup of coffee. Sounds too good to be true, right? Well, that's exactly what RankGPT promises to do.

RankGPT is all about working with something called SearchGPT. Now, you might be wondering, ""What's SearchGPT?"" Think of it as the new kid on the block in the world of search engines. It's like Google, but it uses some fancy AI technology to understand and show search results. RankGPT is designed to help your website get noticed by SearchGPT, and fast.

The cool thing about RankGPT is that it's not just for tech wizards. It's made for anyone who wants to get their website out there, whether you're running a small business, starting a blog, or just want to share your ideas with the world. Let's dive in and see what this tool is all about and how it might change the game for website owners everywhere.

[Drive massive free traffic: RankGPT builds and ranks your website #1 on SearchGPT in under a minute](https://preview.redd.it/w8i8j60z0f4e1.png?width=1857&format=png&auto=webp&s=f074125997925294dd75b7c64271351d41d9f511)

# Features and Content of RankGPT

Now, let's break down what RankGPT actually does. It's packed with features that make creating and ranking websites a whole lot easier.

# Quick Website Creation

First off, RankGPT can whip up a website for you in just 60 seconds. That's faster than most of us can decide what to have for lunch! You don't need to know any coding or design skills. Just tell it what kind of website you want, and it does the heavy lifting for you.

# SearchGPT Optimization

The big deal here is that RankGPT doesn't just make websites ‚Äì it makes websites that SearchGPT loves. It uses all sorts of tricks to make sure your site ticks all the boxes that SearchGPT is looking for. This means your site has a better chance of showing up when people search for things related to what you do.

# Keyword Magic

RankGPT has a special tool that finds the best keywords for your website. These aren't just any old keywords ‚Äì they're picked specifically to work well with SearchGPT. This helps your site pop up in more searches.

# Content Creator

Need stuff to put on your website? RankGPT can help with that too. It can create articles, videos, and even images that are all set up to do well on SearchGPT. This saves you tons of time and effort in coming up with content.

# SEO Helper

There's a smart AI assistant built into RankGPT that gives you tips on how to make your site even better for search engines. It's like having an SEO expert right at your fingertips.

# Voice Search Ready

More and more people are using voice search these days, and RankGPT makes sure your site is ready for that. It optimizes your content so it shows up when people are talking to their phones or smart speakers.

# Multi-Language Support

Got a global audience? RankGPT can translate your content into different languages, all while keeping it optimized for SearchGPT. This means you can reach people all over the world without having to create separate websites.

# Security Features

RankGPT doesn't just help with search rankings ‚Äì it also includes features to keep your website safe from hackers and other online threats. This is super important for keeping your site and your visitors' information secure.

# Hosting Included

These features are just the tip of the iceberg. RankGPT is designed to be an all-in-one solution for getting your website up, running, and ranking well on SearchGPT.

# Benefits of RankGPT and Who Can Benefit From It

Let's talk about why RankGPT could be a game-changer and who might find it super useful.

# Time Saver

The biggest benefit? Time. RankGPT can do in minutes what might take days or weeks if you were doing it all yourself. This is huge for anyone who's ever felt overwhelmed by the thought of creating and promoting a website.

# Cost-Effective

Instead of hiring different people for web design, content creation, and SEO, RankGPT bundles it all together. This could save a lot of money, especially for small businesses or individuals just starting out.

# No Tech Skills Needed

You don't need to be a computer whiz to use RankGPT. It's designed to be user-friendly, so even if you're not tech-savvy, you can still create a professional-looking website that ranks well.

# Targeted Traffic

By optimizing for SearchGPT, RankGPT helps bring in visitors who are actually interested in what you're offering. This means better chances of turning those visitors into customers or followers.

# Staying Ahead of the Curve

SearchGPT is new, and not everyone knows about it yet. By using RankGPT, you're getting ahead of the game and potentially beating out competitors who are still focused only on traditional search engines.

So, who can benefit from RankGPT? Pretty much anyone who wants a website that gets noticed. This includes:

* Small business owners who want to get online quickly and start attracting customers
* Bloggers looking to grow their audience without spending all their time on SEO
* Online store owners who want to boost their visibility and sales
* Freelancers trying to showcase their skills and find more clients
* Non-profit organizations aiming to spread their message and attract supporters

Create niche websites quickly and easily, then fill them with affiliate links. If your sites rank well on SearchGPT, you could see a significant increase in commissions from products you recommend.

Use your expertise with RankGPT to create courses or offer coaching services to others who want to improve their online presence.

The key to profiting from RankGPT is to think creatively about how you can use well-ranked websites to either support an existing business or create new income streams. The tool gives you the ability to quickly establish an online presence ‚Äì it's up to you to figure out how to best leverage that for your specific goals.

# My Own Case Study for RankGPT as a Beta Tester

As a beta tester for RankGPT, I had the chance to try out this tool before it hit the market. Here's my personal experience:

I decided to create a website for my hobby ‚Äì urban gardening. I've always wanted to share my tips and experiences, but I never had the time or skills to build a proper website.

# Day 1: Getting Started

I logged into RankGPT and chose a template for a hobby blog. I entered keywords like ""urban gardening,"" ""small space plants,"" and ""apartment vegetables."" In less than a minute, RankGPT had created a basic website structure.

# Week 1: Content Creation and Optimization

RankGPT generated some initial content for me, which was surprisingly good. I added my own personal stories and tips. The SEO assistant suggested ways to improve my content, like adding more specific plant names and care instructions.

# Week 2: Publishing and Waiting

I published the site and waited to see what would happen. RankGPT's dashboard showed me that SearchGPT was starting to index my pages.

# Week 3: First Results

I was shocked to see my site appearing on the first page of SearchGPT for terms like ""beginner urban gardening tips"" and ""growing tomatoes in apartments."" The traffic started to trickle in.

# Month 1: Growing Traffic

By the end of the first month, my site was getting about 100 visitors a day. People were leaving comments and asking questions about urban gardening.

# Month 2: Monetization

With the growing traffic, I decided to try monetizing the site. I added some affiliate links to gardening tools and seeds. To my surprise, I made my first sale within a week.

# Month 3: Expansion

Encouraged by the results, I used RankGPT to add more pages to my site, covering topics like indoor herb gardens and vertical gardening. The AI-generated content gave me a great starting point, which I then personalized with my own experiences.

# Results After 3 Months

* Average daily visitors: 500+
* First page rankings on SearchGPT for 15+ keywords
* Monthly affiliate income: $300
* Email subscribers: 200+

What impressed me most was how easy it was to get started and maintain the site. RankGPT handled the technical SEO aspects I wouldn't have known how to do myself. The regular content suggestions kept my site fresh without me having to constantly come up with new ideas.

This experience showed me that RankGPT can be a powerful tool for anyone looking to establish an online presence quickly, even in a niche market. It's not just about creating a website ‚Äì it's about creating a website that gets found and generates results.

I'm a bit lost after sending my Krups Evidence Eco-Design EA897B in for repair for the 3rd time and it isn't fixed, AGAIN. They just said the problem didn't occur and sent it back just like last times. Any advice?

The problem is that at first it stops showing the start button-light after turning it on.  If you then still start it, it starts a normal cycle, but it skips pouring the water down the puck. It just does nothing a few seconds, then ends the cycle and disposes the dry ground coffee in the bin. 
When trying to turn it off it flashes all its lights in a row and responds to nothing untill you disconnect the power.
Sometimes it's fixed after that, and sometimes it will keep this error untill it's disconnected for a longer time. And then it happens again after a few days, weeks or months. 

The Krups Services are aware of this and I've sent multiple video's of the problem occuring.

Any ideas what could be happening and if this is fixable? Or what i could say to Krups Services? Warranty is still valid.

It lasted for a few days until I crashed and burned and had to nap for the better part of three days to recover an acceptable energy level.

After that experience, I tried something else entirely and completely cut off my coffee consumption. I've been coffee-free for about a couple weeks now, and the change is amazing. What I took for my ""normal fatigue"" is now gone, I wake up better rested, I feel more energic and focused throughout the day, I'm overstimulated less easily, less mood swings... all in all, I function a lot better without coffee.

Im 30 years old (male). My childhood was horrible. My father was a gambling, lying alcoholic. He always was drunk and we always had fights in our home.

It was never peaceful. He tormented my mother and brought a lot of stress to my grandma, whom both died of cancer and strokes and I attribute their deaths to him. They were wrecks because of the stress and anguish he brought.

This was all a couple of years ago. He started a new familie 8 years ago and has now 2 small girls with his new wife (ex).

I moved out rather quick nad have been in contact with him here and there, maybe once every 2-3 weeks.

I had a scratch on my car and went to a mechanic for a fix up. I told him about it and he said forget it that's way too much, lets drive to his homecountry (which is 4-5h away). He knows somebody that can fix it cheap.

I agreed and we went on friday. We slept in the house and gave the car to the mechanic the next day in the morning. He told us by 4 pm it should be finished.

My father told me to go home, he has to go somewhere. I agreed and went home. it was now 12 am and he came. I told him that I plan to drive home as soon as the car is done. He agreed, but said he has to go somewhere first and we can't just leave right away. We would have to at least get coffee with the mechanic afterwards since that is common here.

I asked him before he left, if he will return and get me, so we can pick up the car. He said yes.

I waited until 11 pm. Mind you, no one was living in this house since it's just for vacation. It was cold, very cold and no food was available since we didnt buy any because we (I) wanted to driver asap home.

It was almost midnight. He came with my car. I opened the door. He was DRUNK DRUNK. Completely wasted. I yelled at him why he drove MY car, wasted.

Then I saw, that he ran somewhere with my car, and both front sides have been wrecked. At this point I saw red.

I yelled so hard and wanted to kill him. He just stood there, not saying a word.

Then he started to cry. I was angrier. I calmed myself down and told him to get in the car, im driving home.

I packed our stuff, put him in the backseat and told him to go to sleep. I was sweettalking him so that he cooperates and gets to sleep.

So I drove with my car, 5h home in the middle of the night. I brought him in his apartement. He was still completetly wasted and couldn't even stand.

I said to my siblings that he is dead to me. That was 2 days ago. He didn't check up on me. Mind you I would've ignored it either way, I don't want to ever hear from him again. It's not the fact that my car is ruined. It can happen. But he drove it without my permision, drunk, and lied to me and left me over 12h alone, knowing there is no heating and food. For me, that is no father.

Some friends think that he forgot everything. I luckily have a video that I recorded in that moment.

There's a girl who is known around the area we live in and while I wouldn't call us friends, I didn't know how to describe best. I see her a lot at the coffee place she works at that's kind of the only place for twenty somethings to hang out in the area. So she is pretty unavoidable. 

This girl is obsessed, and I mean truly obsessed, with my childhood friend. She is 24, kind of intense, honestly pushy. I've noticed right from the jump that she is very volatile, it doesn't take much to set her off and sometimes I worry that she will do something... intense. Other times I feel that it's just... drama, and she's fine, though that feels mean to say. 

The guy she is obsessed with is her next door neighbor, my childhood friend. He is 28, and he has had one of the rougher lives of anyone I know. He had a horrible childhood, and for a time he was often at my house because his family was really bad. He is a really nice guy, to a fault. Because he just doesn't want anyone to hurt him, or be upset with him.

I would say I know him very well. We have shared some deep conversations and I know personal things about his life and his past that nobody else does, and he knows some of mine too. 

Now, here's the complicated thing. My friend has an ex girlfriend who he recently had a baby with. The problem is he is gay. I know he is gay, I've known since high school. He has told me he is gay, or at least bi but heavily preferring men. I don't know if that's the PC way to refer to it, but no disrespect, that's what I'm going with. I think maybe he loves women, and can have sex with them evidently, but it isn't his sexuality. That's how I've understood it. So yes, he has a child with his ex.

My girlfriend and I were recently at Obsessed Girl, 24F's apartment to pick up something she was selling on Fb marketplace. While we were there she left to take her dog out and I see it, holy lord, this girl has a shrine dedicated to my friend. She has pictures of him from high-school to now literally plastered on a bulletin board. And her vibrator was lying there on the table. I didn't like the implication. She came back and I made a nervous joke about the bulletin board, at this point I was so shocked and so was my girlfriend. 

This girl just laughs it off and says why should she hide it, they're in love. She claims that she has been in a relationship with my friend for months now, and that he just hasn't talked to her in months because he's afraid of his feelings, but she knows he will come back to her. She then gave us the grand royal TMI by telling us that she masturbates to the thought of my friend multiple times a day, at which point I started to get honestly nauseous. She showed us her tarot card readings and some spiritual guide writing thing where she closes her eyes and ""channels"" my friend. She wrote things down like what she delusionally thinks he would say to her, about how she's his dream girl, and how he says she's his soulmate, which she claims he really said. She was so unsettlingly confident that this was my friend's actual genuine thoughts. I started to get this pit in my stomach, but we had to just play along. She did a tarot for me and my girlfriend (apparently my girlfriend who doesn't want kids is destined to have 'the twins she always wanted' haha). 

I apologize to anyone who is into tarot but this sh$t was ridiculous. She is straight up lying to herself, and I cannot believe she doesn't see it. She also pointed to the ex girlfriend, and the baby, and basically said ""if he could commit to her, he can commit to me"". She continuously referred to herself as a ""future step mom"" and ""our baby"" referring to his kid. Our baby?!

My friend only committed to that girl by busting in her while on poppers or some sh\*t, and he never ever wanted a relationship with a woman, though he says he can love them and care about them. He has stated this to me. He loves his kid, but that relationship is a doozy, and him and his ex are not friendly. 

The worst part was when my girlfriend said something to the effect of oh, I didn't know he was dating girls at this point in time, this girl got so upset and began crying, saying that she couldn't live without him and grilling my girlfriend on if my friend is gay. We didn't want to make things worse so we kept quiet and played dumb, saying nothing. She seemed manic and we both felt really uncomfortable. She worked herself up to tears and then suddenly went very calm and said she ""knew for a fact"" he was straight because the Spirits told her so. She reiterated several times ""I know he isn't gay, why did I let my anxiety take over?"" over and over. Keep in mind we said nothing the whole time. She worked herself up, then worked herself back down. We left after that. 

I don't know who else knows that my friend is gay. I suspect his ex girlfriend knows, but none of us talk to her. I reached out to my friend a lot these past few months and he was distant. I reached out to him again, asking about this girl, and he came to meet me at my Dad's house. The guy was having a full on breakdown. He was ducking so he couldn't be seen from the windows, crying and pulling at his hair. I asked him to let me take him to the hospital several times but he wouldn't go. 

He said he screwed up big time because several months ago he met this girl outside when she was walking her dog, they hit it off and he thought maybe they could be friends, but she flirted. He didn't want to offend her so he just let her flirt and he claims he flirted back. Part out of habit, part out of shame, maybe. I know my friend and I know he would flirt back if he felt afraid of rocking the boat. Like I said, he was treated terribly as a kid and that tracks with how I know him to be. He will tell anyone absolutely anything that he thinks they want to hear, he will say anything to not get hurt. To me it seemed like he was getting better, but some situations bring him right back to how he was when he was like 15, this one worst of all. 

He claims that after their initial encounter, he saw this girl a few more times where they had long drawn out conversations that he couldn't remember the details of. But he did say he remembered agreeing with her when she said they had a soul connection like soul mates, because he didn't really understand what she was saying and he felt nervous. He said this girl's intensity terrified him so he would black out and leave the conversation with the feeling that he'd just dug himself in deeper. Based on her behavior I think that he definitely gave her some reasons to think he was into her, but it doesn't excuse her extreme obsession. The way I see it, people flirt all the time, but you can't go basing your life around someone who hasn't explicitly told you they want to be with you. Prior to that conversation, ghosting or seeing other people is fair game, so I don't get why this girl is so obsessed after a few vaguely flirtatious conversations (allegedly). 

Ultimately, my friend said that he didn't feel safe. He said he'd been sleeping in his car, afraid to go back to his apartment, afraid that this girl had broken in, that she had hired people to track him, that most of all he was worried this girl was going to \*\*\*\* herself if he rejected her. He said that in an effort to appease her, he wondered if maybe he could just force himself to like her. He tried forcing himself to be straight, forcing himself to only watch straight porn and hurting himself if he had gay thoughts. I know I sound like a broken record but I know my friend and I know this is a behavior learned from his childhood. 

I asked if he would be comfortable with me telling this woman that he is gay, and then I told him he could live with me at my Dad's, or at my girlfriend and I's apartment for as long as he wants. 

At first he said yes, tell her I'm gay, because he said he didn't want her pining after him anymore, and this way she could have closure. So I said alright, I'll tell her. 

But then he suddenly changed his mind, asking what if that's what pushes her over the edge? And I didn't know what to say to that. He isn't as worried about her knowing he's gay as much as he's worried about what she will do to herself. 

He has said repeatedly, he will not get a restraining order against her or any other type of legal measure because he doesn't trust the courts (he isn't white, and I don't want to get political but this is just his stance I'm relaying) and mainly, he doesn't want to upset her. He is ADAMANT about this. His only driving motivation through this whole thing is that he doesn't want to upset her or hurt her, because that would make him actively ""s......."" you know what, I don't know if I can say it here. 

He is living with my girlfriend now (24F has no idea where that apartment is), and I was able to convince him to go see his therapist. He messaged to say that he still isn't sure how to deal with the situation but he now knows he isn't being followed, he still doesn't want to do a restraining order, and he still doesn't want to hurt her, but he does desperately want to move on with his life and heal. He recognizes that he made a mistake flirting back with her, that it was out of instinct and fear, and he doesn't want to punish himself anymore. 

As a man, I feel that I need to take care of my friend. I want to tell this girl the truth, since my friend gave me permission, and I first thought that might give her closure and help her let go, but I don't know if this is something that might tip a clearly unstable person over the edge. I would assume she wouldn't hold him being gay against her, though she might be angry that he didn't tell her outright. At the same time, that would mean that her tarot cards were wrong, and I don't know if I have any business shattering someone's perception of religion, and that's what my friend fears. 

I want to honor my friend's request that we do no harm. But I don't know how to navigate this. Maybe there's an angle I am not seeing, or something I haven't considered. This has all been going on over the past two weeks and it keeps me up at night. I don't have anyone other than my girlfriend to talk to about this in real life.

**TLDR:** 

My childhood friend (28 M) had a traumatizing life, and struggles with his sexuality. He identifies himself to me and close friends as gay, but he has an ex girlfriend who he has a child with. He lives next door to a girl (24F) who is obsessed with him ever since they first met. She flirted, and because he struggles with feeling like he has to appease others, he flirted back. Since then this girl has been obsessed with him in a sexual and romantic way. He says that they shared a few long conversations where out of fear, he continued to try and appease her despite knowing he cannot reciprocate her feelings. Nothing sexual has happened or been said on his end, but she openly admitted she gets off to him while my girlfriend and I were in her apartment, and has a shrine dedicated to him with daily messages, tarot card readings, etc. 

My friend first asked me to tell this girl that he is gay, because he feels guilty that she is still pining after him months after they met. He said he wanted her to have closure and move on to a guy who can reciprocate her feelings. But then, he told me he wasn't sure if that was a good idea, because he was worried that would make her spiral, due to her extreme obsession with him and the fact that her tarot cards have enabled her delusions. He does not want a restraining order for valid reasons, and his mental state is my top priority, so I want to do right by him. His number one request is that we try not to harm her. I don't know how to handle this but I care about my friend, I was there as he went through hell as a teenager and it seems like he is going through a dark time again right now. It's my duty to be there for him. ",1,1733136440.0,relationship_advice,5,1.0,False

The Fifth Picture","I‚Äôve always loved photography. There‚Äôs something magical about capturing a fleeting moment and holding it forever. So when I found an old Polaroid camera at a flea market, I couldn‚Äôt resist. It was heavy, scratched, and smelled faintly of mildew, but it still worked.

The seller was eager to be rid of it. ‚ÄúTwenty bucks and it‚Äôs yours,‚Äù he said, eyes darting around like he didn‚Äôt want to be seen. As I reached for my wallet, he hesitated. ‚ÄúJust...be careful with it. Don‚Äôt push it past four.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt ask what he meant. I figured it was just old hardware with its quirks. But he seemed oddly relieved when I walked away with it.

At first, everything seemed fine. The camera produced beautiful, vintage-style photos with a warm tone I loved. But I quickly noticed a strange pattern: the first four photos came out perfectly. The fifth, no matter the setting, was always blank.

At least, it seemed blank.

One evening, while reviewing a stack of pictures, I held a fifth photo up to the light. Something was there‚Äîa faint outline, like a shadow that didn‚Äôt belong. It was easy to dismiss as a flaw in the film, but it gave me a strange, uneasy feeling.

I started experimenting, taking the camera everywhere. On a hike, I captured towering trees and golden sunlight. Four perfect shots. The fifth? Another ‚Äúblank.‚Äù But this time, the shadow was unmistakable‚Äîvague but human-like, standing far in the background.

At a friend‚Äôs birthday party, the same thing happened. Four shots of laughter and clinking glasses. The fifth photo revealed the figure again, now closer, standing near the edge of the crowd. I showed the picture to my friends, laughing nervously.

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs that?‚Äù one of them asked, pointing to the shadowy figure.

‚ÄúProbably just a trick of the light,‚Äù I replied. But inside, I was rattled.

That night, I couldn‚Äôt sleep. The camera sat on my desk, daring me to try again. I decided to test it, alone in my living room. I snapped the first picture of the couch. Perfect. The second, the coffee table. Perfect again. The third, the TV. The fourth, the window.

My heart raced as I prepared for the fifth. I turned the camera toward the dark hallway leading to my bedroom.

Click.

The photo slid out, the blank image slowly developing. I stared, my breath caught in my chest.

The figure was there, clear and undeniable now. A man with hollow, empty eyes and a crooked smile, standing in the hallway.

I turned toward the hallway, heart pounding. It was empty.

Shaking, I raised the camera and took another picture, this time of myself in the reflection of the living room mirror.

Click.

The photo emerged, the image developing agonizingly slowly.

The man was behind me.

I dropped the camera and ran, grabbing my car keys and driving aimlessly through the night. When I finally returned the next morning, the house was silent. I crept inside, half-expecting to see the man waiting for me. But the living room was empty, the camera gone.

In its place, a single Polaroid lay on the coffee table.

I picked it up with trembling hands. It was a photo of me.

I was lying on the floor of my living room. My eyes were wide open, unblinking, and lifeless.

\- Daytime: average 135/85 (range 125/80 to 140/90)

**Workdays:**  
  
\- Same, BUT my wakeup spike is much higher: average 140/100

**Question:**

1. Do you think the above situation is ok? I get quite widely differing opinions (especially UK/US sites) i.e. is a daily average of 135/85 ok (considering a low nightly one) or not.
2. I've intensively charted my personal causes of high BP spikes (and why they're higher at work), and it's definitely something mental linked to a feeling of SLIGHT ""nervous energy"" when **on a computer/phone.** For example, this morning I logged onto my computer and, whilst I'm not stressed at all with work (little on), the array of possabilities to start, ability to browse reddit etc, leads to a nervous energy I can chart with my BP spike. Does anyone else get this and do they have strategies to solve?

Thanks for any help,

Male, 42, Healthy/low stress, vegitarian, non smoker, non drinker etc  
Take daily 5mg Ramipril (+ vegitarian supplements (B12, Omega 3 etc)  
""Try"" to avoid salt, but probably not great at it (seasonings on veggie food), BUT haven't noticed a correlation for me  
Limit to 1 coffee a day re. caffeine  
I don't class myself as having ADHD (not attempted a diagnosis), but have a number of simularities and follow literature on it to work effectively.

I'm wondering if anyone knows of any places I might get in that would give me a decent aerial view over this part of the waterfront?  Maybe somewhere I could stop for coffee or lunch?  Or even just a public access balcony.  

Thanks in advance.  ",3,1733134924.0,Liverpool,2,1.0,False
