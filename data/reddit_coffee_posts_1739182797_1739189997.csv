Setting and achieving goals is one of the most significant aspects of personal and professional growth. But what is the force behind this drive? Why do some people seem naturally motivated while others struggle to even start?

In this blog, we’ll explore the key factors that propel individuals toward success. By understanding these drivers, you can harness them to fuel your own aspirations.

1. Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Motivation
Motivation generally falls into two categories: intrinsic and extrinsic.

Intrinsic Motivation
This refers to doing something because it’s inherently satisfying or meaningful.

✅ Example: An artist paints because they love expressing their creativity—not because they’re being paid.

🔹 Why It Works: Passion and internal fulfillment create lasting commitment. Intrinsic motivation is a powerful driver because it aligns with personal values and interests.

💡 Example Goals: Writing a novel, learning a language, running a marathon.

Extrinsic Motivation
This type of motivation stems from external rewards, like money, fame, or recognition.

✅ Example: You might aim for a promotion because of the higher salary and prestige attached to it.

🔹 Why It Works: Clear, tangible rewards provide a measurable sense of achievement.

💡 Example Goals: Getting a raise, winning an award, buying your dream house.

📢 Fun Fact: Oscar Wilde once quipped, “The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.” For some, even criticism can be a powerful extrinsic motivator!

2. A Clear Sense of Purpose
A strong “why” acts as a compass, guiding people toward their goals. Without a clear purpose, even the best-laid plans can falter.

🔹 How to Find Your Purpose: Ask yourself:

What impact do I want to make?
How will achieving this goal improve my life or others’ lives?

📌 Pro Tip: Write down your purpose and revisit it whenever your motivation wavers.

3. A Growth Mindset
Psychologist Carol Dweck popularized the concept of a growth mindset—the belief that abilities and intelligence can be developed through effort and learning.

💡 Why It Matters: Viewing failure as an opportunity rather than a dead end fosters resilience.

✅ How to Cultivate It: Replace thoughts like “I can’t” with “I can learn how.”

4. Accountability and Support
Humans are social creatures, and accountability often makes the difference between intention and action.

Ways to Build Accountability:
✔️ Join a community with similar goals.
✔️ Partner with an accountability buddy.
✔️ Regularly update a mentor or coach.

📢 Fun Fact: Research shows that you’re 65% more likely to achieve a goal if you commit to someone else—and 95% more likely if you schedule check-ins!

5. Emotional Connection and Visualization
Connecting emotionally to the outcome of your goal can be incredibly powerful.

💭 Visualization Technique:

Imagine yourself crossing the finish line of a race.
Picture how you’ll feel when your book is published.

🔹 Why It Works: Emotional engagement makes goals feel real and attainable, keeping you energized throughout the journey.

6. The Power of Habits
Successful people understand that consistency beats motivation. By breaking your goal into smaller, manageable steps and building habits around them, you can make progress without overwhelming yourself.

💡 Example: Instead of aiming to write a 300-page novel immediately, start with writing 500 words a day.

📌 Why It Works: Once a habit is ingrained, it requires less mental effort to maintain.

7. Fear of Regret
For some, the fear of looking back with regret is an incredibly strong motivator.

✅ How to Leverage It: Ask yourself:
""How will I feel in five years if I don’t do this?""

🚀 Hint: This works well for procrastinators—sometimes, the fear of regret can be stronger than the pull of Netflix.

8. Celebrating Progress
Acknowledging milestones—no matter how small—keeps the momentum going.

🎉 Ways to Celebrate Progress:
✔️ Treat yourself to a coffee after completing a big task.
✔️ Share your success with friends or social media.

📌 Why It Works: Celebrations boost dopamine levels, reinforcing positive behavior and keeping you motivated.

Conclusion: Your Drive Is Unique
People are driven by a mix of intrinsic desires, extrinsic rewards, emotional connections, and sometimes just a healthy dose of FOMO.

✨ The key is to identify what motivates YOU and build systems to sustain it.

So, whether you’re fueled by passion, fear of regret, or the promise of a reward, your commitment to the process is what truly matters.

📢 Remember: “Rome wasn’t built in a day, but they were laying bricks every hour.” Keep laying those bricks, and you’ll achieve your goals.

Hello Empowish Warriors! 💪

Do you ever feel like you're standing on the edge of greatness, but something just holds you back? That little voice inside that questions whether you're ready, whether you're good enough. Sound familiar? Let’s dive into silencing that self-doubt and unleashing your true potential! 🚀

We all have dreams we're nurturing into reality. But self-doubt? It's the sneaky shadow that follows passion and ambition, whispering questions we're sometimes too tired to fend off. Here's the thing: conquering self-doubt isn’t about getting rid of it forever. Instead, it's about learning how to manage it, refocus your mind, and keep moving forward.

✨ So, grab 5 minutes of your day, every day, to invest in these simple, yet powerful practices:

1. **Affirmation Activation** 🗣️
   Start your day with affirmations that set the right tone for your mindset. Choose an empowering statement like “I am capable, I am worthy, and I am evolving.” Saying it while looking at yourself in the mirror creates a visceral connection. These positive assertions act like mental vitamins for your soul. Build new neural pathways that foster confidence, inch by inch.

2. **Visualize Victory** 🎯
   Close your eyes. Breathe deeply. Imagine yourself accomplishing your biggest goal. Do this vividly – your surroundings, how you feel, and what you’ve achieved. Visualization turns abstract goals into something concrete your mind can latch onto. It stirs motivation and sets your thought patterns to “yes, you can!”

3. **Tune into Gratitude** 🙏
   Write down three things you’re grateful for every day. They don’t have to be grand – maybe it’s the aroma of your morning coffee or a text from a friend. Gratitude shifts focus from what you lack to what you abundantly have. It’s a grounding force that amplifies positivity and reduces self-doubt by highlighting your wins, big and small.

4. **Power Pose Burst** 🚶‍♀️
   Boost your confidence with a power pose! For two minutes, stand strongly – feet apart, hands on hips, chest out. It might sound goofy, but it prompts physiological changes that encourage confidence and diminish stress hormones. Channel your inner superhero and transform how you view your day’s challenges.

5. **Spark Connection** 🔗
   Engage with your community here on Empowish. Share your wins, your lessons – both humbling and triumphant. Ask for advice or offer support. Connection to a community reaffirms you’re not alone in this journey. Engage with others’ journeys and watch your own self-belief grow stronger with each interaction.

Remember, overcoming self-doubt isn’t about not feeling it – it’s about not letting it control your actions. It's a journey – part of the beautiful path of self-improvement. ⛰️

🔥 Call to Action: Ready to conquer your doubts? We’re all in this together! Share how you’ll spend your 5 minutes conquering self-doubt today. What works for you? Have any additional tips? Drop a comment below. Let’s empower each other, one post at a time!

1im4nee,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ocotillospikes/comments/1im4nee/in_quiet_moments_i_get_nauseous_about_the_bikini/,In quiet moments I get nauseous about the bikini coffee drive thru guy who shot himself in the head.,"The second time I walked into a strip club was for a job interview for a security position. The first time was on the return trip of a 9 hour drive to see Godspeed You! Black Emperor in a cathedral on the campus of the University of Chicago. 

On the drive up my girlfriend-at-the-time had pointed out a roadside strip club in central Missouri. A few years earlier she had spent a whil cutting her teeth as an independent comic book artist in Portland after earning her MFA in ""sequential arts"" from an esteemed arts school, and at that moment she had a tenure track academic position at regional state school, pursuing a career in arts academia which continues to this day. Portland, as you may know, happens to have the highest per capita rate for strip clubs in an United States municipality, and on the way up to the show and the way back down we discussed her position here and there that strip clubs were Cool Actually, Quite A Bit of Fun, In Fact, And The Girls Were In Control. 

This coalesced in her convincing me to pull back off the highway into this weird strip club/truck stop/novelty shop complex on the way back down, and she paid a cover charge for the two of us to enter a sleezy weird club completely bereft of patrons except for the two of us. She then paid a visibly pilled-out woman wearing very tall boots to gyrate on me for five minutes. It was a mishmash of macabre humor and hipster detachment, and we left after we finished one drink to proceed back home. We laughed about it a bit, but the gruesome strangeness of it all kinda stuck with me. Regardless, as a guy that trusted her judgement, I figured we just went into a weird strip club and I shouldn't make judgements about what strip clubs were from that singular moment since I had no interest in that format of entertainment beforehand or afterward.

Four years later, we were broken up and I was 1300 miles away from home, living in a small studio apartment, staring in the mirror after putting my whole life on the line for a career opportunity that did not pan out three weeks in to spending every dollar I had to my name to wind up staring the mirror, unemployed. I shared an exterior door with a stripper who I had smoked weed with a couple times, and since I was hard up for work in an unknown town I hit her up about working at the club she danced at since I had several years of dive bar hospitality experience, and I figured being a bouncer at a strip club wouldn't be That Different from working at like...I don't know...a normal shitty bar where people do coke in the bathroom and every few months someone pulls out a gun outside the joint.

At that point in my life I had dated a couple ""sex workers"" as in art school girls who did their... ""thing"" involving the internet and social media, and I thought that strippers, in general, made their money dancing on the pole, gathering dollar bills, then performing lap dances for ""normal"" men and goofy party girls because that's like...kinda how it's portrayed in progressive circles. I thought it was a weird shitty late night job not dissimilar to me bouncing or bartending at nasty dive bars, and I believed there wasn't much difference between me getting my nose broken for $9/hr plus tips and the average dancer. I was completely wrong.

I found myself working security at what was considered the highest end strip club in southern Arizona. On a Friday or Saturday night there were 60-70 dancers working the floor, mostly nude, working the floor and rotating through three elevated stages. I wore a $120 off-the-rack black suit with a white dress shirt to work, and I started off parking cars and walking dancers to their cars when they clocked off then wound up the lead bouncer within six weeks because there was so much turnover among the security staff. I quit three months in because I got a minimum job as a mountain bike tour guide at a dude ranch 45 minutes away from my house 

Before working at the club, I had spent years of my adult life seeing Hooters-esque businesses and strip clubs along roadsides and I'd heard plenty of strip club stories here and there, but it all seemed relatively innocuous. I guess I figured these businesses' finances were sustained by relatively normal people that had different-but-valid relationships with the commodification of female sexual vigor. I could not have been more off base.

At the strip club I worked at, patting down and seating people, bussing tables, collecting tips from both patrons and dancers, kicking people out here and there, walking dancers to their cars, most of the patrons that came through the doors were absolute scum of the earth people. This club has a relatively strict dress code that was rather ethnically informed if you know what I'm saying, and the club was regionally expensive to both enter and enjoy as a patron. On a Friday or Saturday evening about half of the crowd in the building amounted to...I don't know...""lol let's party at a strip club""-type people of all shapes and sizes, but those hours only accounted for ~16 hours of a business that was open 11am-2am seven days a week, 365 days a year. The particular club I worked at had ~200 dancers that could come and go as they pleased(as long as they paid they required fees). The vast majority of the men that kept the building humming and the dancers paid were so unpleasant and lacking-in-charm that they were drawn to the environment because they literally had to pay to be in the presence of good looking women.

I'm not going to dive into the horrifying reality of how this plays out on the dancer's side of things because I only have observational experience and how that trajectory plays out is both very subjective and it's also the subject of more artistic reflection than I care to summarize, but I will say this: as a guy who spent ~40 hours a week in eyeshot of incredibly attractive naked women for a couple months, I gained the perspective that the normalized market for female sexual vigor on an interpersonal level is a net negative for society as a whole. The men that keep these businesses open are truly awful and unsettling human beings, and I quit the job after a couple months because I couldn't grapple with the reality that all of these men driving away had plenty of other relationships with women in their homes and the world-at-large that were inevitably affected by the disgusting framework of sexual access via monetary expenditure. Maybe if I'd been a dancer myself I'd have been able to tolerate the horror of it all with a bit more financial incentive,but that wasn't me and I just couldn't handle how disgusting the whole arrangement was as a relative bystander who was being paid about $20 an hour to just keep things ""safe"" and ""professional"".

Wrapping this all up, a couple of weeks ago there was a viral video on Twitter of a guy who was recorded jerking off in a Dodge Charger as he rolled up to the drive-thru window of a bikini babe coffee shop in Tempe, Arizona. Before this video even went viral, this guy who witnessed himself being recorded pretty much immediately drove to a nearby automotive parts store and shot himself in the head. Weeks later, this guy is constantly being portrayed as a total loser and piece of shit on Twitter. He also happened to be both a husband and a father, and a guy in his mid-20s(who happened to be a nephew of famous basketball player Karl Malone, which is an objectively funny non-sequitur.)

 This particular bikini babe drive thru coffee shop happens to be a spot I've driven past a dozen times when I've visited Tempe, and every time I've driven past it I've thought to myself ""wow, what kind of fucking loser buys shitty coffee at a place where the barista is in a bikini? That's pathetic on its own merits, let alone that these losers only get to look at the baristas through the window of their cars.""

What fucks me up is regardless of how you square the circle of commerce and sexuality, I literally don't know how you could clock into work as a bikini barista and be so surprised that loser freak dudes would literally jack off while they buy coffee from you the post it online. Like, this dumbass freak idiot with a wife and child at home is so porn brained that he chooses to buy his caffeine treats from a business that explicitly advertises itself as a place to get your stimulant fix while you look at scantily clad women. And this guy gets documented in 4K being a weird freak...at a business designed for weird freaks...and he blows his fucking brains out before it even goes viral, which it does, and everybody on Twitter just laughs about it for days and days instead of admitting we live in a Deeply Fucked Up paradigm where being a freak is very lucrative for lots of people as long as you don't get caught being a freak in the wrong circumstances.

Anyways, what I'm trying to say is anyone who buys sex should go to jail, and anyone who sells sex is no different than a dive bar coke dealer and if they get caught selling sex they should be forced to go to community college classes for trade work because making money like that is just enabling awful patholgies that are corrosive to the fabric of society.",1,1739189305.0,u_ocotillospikes,0,1.0,False

That's pathetic on its own merits, let alone that these losers only get to look at the baristas through the window of their cars.""

What fucks me up is regardless of how you square the circle of commerce and sexuality, I literally don't know how you could clock into work as a bikini barista and be so surprised that loser freak dudes would literally jack off while they buy coffee from you the post it online. Like, this dumbass freak idiot with a wife and child at home is so porn brained that he chooses to buy his caffeine treats from a business that explicitly advertises itself as a place to get your stimulant fix while you look at scantily clad women. And this guy gets documented in 4K being a weird freak...at a business designed for weird freaks...and he blows his fucking brains out before it even goes viral, which it does, and everybody on Twitter just laughs about it for days and days instead of admitting we live in a Deeply Fucked Up paradigm where being a freak is very lucrative for lots of people as long as you don't get caught being a freak in the wrong circumstances.

Anyways, what I'm trying to say is anyone who buys sex should go to jail, and anyone who sells sex is no different than a dive bar coke dealer and if they get caught selling sex they should be forced to go to community college classes for trade work because making money like that is just enabling awful patholgies that are corrosive to the fabric of society.",2,1739189217.0,redscarepod,0,0.67,False

1im4k8j,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1im4k8j,Setup Updates/Upgrades AUS (Long Overdue) PART 1 OF 2,"Hello fellow dwellers of the Vehicular Kind. HOUSELESS UNITED !

Posting up some recent updates/upgrades to home sweet home over tyres. 

First pic, still with the old fridge which ended up ad a POS that I'm still dealing with with KINGS to return. Luckily it wasn't expensive buy hoping to get my money back for what I have been referring to as ""an in-car water feature""

So anyway. Replaced that POS with a Dometic cff-12, much better unit all together and doubles as a bedside table which is nice. 

External monitor now lives on those hooks to the side. (I LOVE when stuff just fits off rip straight away and just works out.

Next pic is a typical lunch situation with a movie in the background. Was the next super size me thing by Spurlock. Not a bad watch. He basically makes a chicken joint lol. 

The Bickfords iced coffee concentrate IS AMAZING. Saving a TON of money on iced coffee now. Amazing taste. For an Aussies here it's WAY better than anything else imo. Craps on big M's and oak etc. Give it a try. Plenty of flavors to choose from, the OG I found the best so far. No preservatives and less sugar is a bonus. 

Hung the monitor off the roof to watch Tom Greens dock on Amazon. REALLY enjoyed that watch. I didn't know ANY of what was covered in that one. What an amazing dude and what an amazing story. The originator of the PODCAST ! Never knew he was such a genious. If you haven't seen it. I reccomened it 10x.

Replaced all the incandescent globes in the internal of the car to give a brighter light and draw way less power and produce less heat. I van run these however long without a worry now. Super cheap and come in a 6 pack. Awesome upgrade. 

Small 800ml kettle off Amazon. Works so well. 5 minute boil and only draws 600 watts. Great for tea, soup, espresso (whole other story in itself ahaha) 10/10 buy. Compact and the cord retracts into the base by spinning manually so no mechanisms to fail in the long run. 

The BIN ! (Trash can for you Americans right ?) Absoloutely awesome thing. I should make a post just about the bin itself ahah. Has pop clips inside to hold a biodegradable bag. The bags are on a roll at the bottom and simply feed up the inside and then you clip them in. Magnets on the inside of the tabs to close the bin off. Such an amazing design. 

Windshield cover by FitMyCar. This wasn't cheap but needed. It's insulated and a perfect cut/fit over the windshield glass. So no more foil stuff flaking off and letting in too much light in the morning. It rolls up and had a black side reversible for winter to keep condensation off the windshield (so they say)  really happy with this. No gaps. Complete privacy. 

I will make another post with how I made the front window covers to replace that foil crap you see in the other pic which let's in so much light and doesn't allow me to have the front windows cracked for ventilation. 

Will also post the bed upgrades I've done. Made a whole board setup as the old stretcher was sagging like a bitch. Felt like a taco towards the end of that. Super bad for the back and neck waking up.

Long post I know but hopefully this gives someone some ideas, inspiration or entertainment at least. 

Hope you're all doing well and surviving the cold/heat.

If anyone has questions or anything feel free to ask away and I'll post up the bed setup tomorrow some time. Cut the mattresses down to size properly now to allow easy access to the fridge and storage of windows covers. 

That's all from me everyone. 

Stay safe and happy.

Never-Successful teams

•	Fail to look at themselves analytically to identify what they are doing that isn’t working—they persist in the management approaches, processes and practices that repeatedly don’t produce good results,

•	Reach for expensive moon-shot answers—they look for stars who they hope can pull the organization to success in their wake, discounting the contributions that will be required from the rest of the staff,

•	Refuse to experiment or take the risks required to achieve actual change and

•	Rely on people they know even when it’s clear that they are not the ones who will steer them to success.

1im4anr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1im4anr/i_32m_moved_in_with_my_friend_34frecently/,I (32M) moved in with my friend (34F)recently,"We've been friends for just over three years now. We met and just clicked, and she probably makes more time for me than any friend I've had. I've been having a hard time adjusting to civilian life after a year of trying to get disability, go to doctors, find a job, so moving in is a huge weight off my back. 

I'm not worried I won't get along with her, we text daily and meet up regularly in person just to grab a coffee or some fries and soda. She's usually the one inviting me out, so I know she's comfortable with the time/place and not feeling pressured to say yes (because of the implication). We game together in groups and have movie nights about twice a month. 

My big thing is, right now she wants me to rest between doctors visits, save up money, and write like I always say I'll do more if I have time. I'm grateful! But my bad health keeps me from standing more than 5 - 10 minutes a pop so I can't help around the house much, or help clear up the spare room where I'll be sleeping.

She likes my writing, so I can dedicate myself to doing that in between hunting for a job, but she already reads all my work so it doesn't feel special. We loosely made plans for Friday since both of us are free, but I can't splurge much right now. I want to, but she rarely lets me get the whole check anyway. Not much of a thank you to her if we go somewhere nice, she dies a little inside at how much things cost when we do get dinner. I'm the exact opposite, I used to do takeout pretty much every night. I mostly lived by myself for the past six years, so not like I was feeding a whole family. She has kids, so I can see why she prefers to cook. 

She always tells me to try Google when I get wrapped in my head, but all the suggestions I found are too expensive, too sappy, or involve a lot more physical activity than I should be doing. I know she likes books, games, doom scrolling (she hates that word so much), and horror movies. She's a homebody, back when I used to go out more with my friends she never went, but always encouraged me to go and never minded when we changed our plans around. She'll show up if it's something like a small dinner or if they need help with renovations, but if it's a bar or restaurant she tells me to have fun. Obviously I cut back on going out cause of real life, so I'm glad to have someone who I can hang out with at home. 

She likes to write too but doesn't use notebooks like I do, I've tried that as a gift on some holiday before and she admitted it's a pretty addition to her bookcase but isn't using it. I guess he hands hurt if she writes a lot. I have gotten her gifts before for her birthday or randomly, it's usually stuff like a classic anthology of literature or vintage thesaurus, a cute dolls, a big coffee mug, or a movie we can't find on our streaming services. But this feels different, this is a big deal and I want it to be more than a one time thing.

After deciding to lose the fat and get jacked, I started looking for guides and help online. After only a couple of days and increasingly after some weeks I noticed I was sucked into a fitness/wellness bubble because of algorithms. 

So now my typical day online world looks like this:

*  I wake up and weigh myself, and while drinking my morning coffee I browse some Reddit. It's full of fitness/workout/weight loss sub updates
* I see nutrition and sport science books on my desk
* I receive a couple of spam emails from sports equipment and supplement stores
* When I open youtube, my frontpage is full of diet/exercise/nutrition videos (also some hot girl in skimpy outfit yoga videos)
* When I walk inside my apartment I see exercise equipment lying around

Also:

* I'm about to start my own health & wellness business after studies

  
All these little things in my everyday life have helped me to shape my identity into something I wanted to be. I wanted to be active and athletic, fit and healthy. Now these things are engraved into my life so closely that I don't need to remind myself to stay mindful about eating. I believe this kind of algorithm manipulation can be helpful to those who easily start to slip and revert to their old habits. That's all. Thank you for your time.

So my friends called me their ""Walking ATM"". coz I always got their back if kinulang/wala sila extra money, lagi akong nagpapahiram or nanlilibre. So, I have this acquaintance. Hindi kami close but nagkakasama kami sa mga coffee dates or gala together coz we have some common friends. 

Since lagi kami magkasama every weekends (yk adult with works, every weekends lang nagmi-meet). May one time na nag ask sya ng money kasi may babayaran sya. I was hesitant at first kasi medyo malaki yung hinihiram nya. Pero napahiram ko sya, but with certain conditions. Nabayaran nya naman on time. Until last last month nanghiram ulit sya. I was hesitant na kasi pinipilit nya na ako. To the point na ang sabi nya ""Naku, ikaw pa mawawalan ng pera"" when I said na may pinaglalaanan akong bilhin, but hindi talaga sya nagpatinag. So pinahiram ko pa rin sya (such a fool) But with the same conditions. But hindi na sya nasunod. Nung minemessage ko na sya, hindi na sya nagrereply or seen man lang. But nakakapag seen sya sa gc namin. Panay din sya post ng stories na nasa galaan. 

Pine-flex nya pa sa socmed na ""High maintenance"" and may ""expensive lifestyle"" 
It's funny to post some things like that but hindi man lang mabayaran yung inutang. Akala ko sa socmed ko lang makikita yung ganon. Not until I know one.

1im403d,https://s.lemon8-app.com/s/GgbejZfMxp,Evolution From Luxury Aspiration to True Character,"When we decided to rebrand our serviced apartment, we couldn’t help but reflect on a trip we took to Canada in 2018. 
It was a journey full of breathtaking landscapes, but also unforgettable stays in the simplest of places—Best Western hotels across British Columbia.I still remember our first stay at Best Western. It was during a road trip from Seattle to BC, and I wasn’t sure if we’d make it across the border smoothly. So, I didn’t even start looking for a hotel until lunch at Stanley Park in Vancouver. By then, I managed to book the last room at Best Western Plus in Pitt Meadows.We arrived around 6 pm and saw a few guests using the hotel computers in the lobby. The front desk lady greeted us with a warm smile, and she was so friendly that I ended up talking to her about our road trip itinerary. She was incredibly helpful and gave me some great suggestions.The room was spacious and comfortable—some of their locations even have balconies. The hotel had all the right conveniences, like a microwave in the room for late-night snacks, coin-operated laundry, and computers available for guests. The breakfast wasn’t elaborate, but it had all the essentials: sausage, hash browns, sandwiches, and coffee. It wasn’t about luxury, but it was simple, comfortable, and welcoming, which made the stay unforgettable.Before heading back to Seattle, we spent our last night in Vancouver at a luxury hotel overlooking the harbor. The building was grand, and the views were stunning, but we found ourselves missing the warmth and personal touch we experienced at Best Western. It became clear to us that luxury alone wasn’t enough to make a stay truly memorable.This trip made us rethink our vision for our own hotel. At first, we had planned to turn it into a luxury serviced apartment, a high-end offering. I even began sourcing uniforms for our front desk team, and the vendor, known for designing for a luxury café chain, presented an illustration. Each female uniform set was priced at about S$350.When I showed the design to our Front Desk team, my colleague said it would look great—especially with a pair of kitten heels. But then we all realized something. How could we run up and down, attending to guests, showing them around, and guiding them to nearby amenities and attractions, all while wearing such fancy attire? 
That moment made everything crystal clear: we were all on the same page. What really defines us is not luxury, but a serviced apartment that offers value, affordability, and friendly service. With the newfound clarity, we started to rebrand our serviced apartment. 
We knew we needed a logo that represented who we truly were—not just another typical hotel logo with abstract shapes, but one with personality. So, we approached an artist on Fiverr who was known for his hand drawn logos. We asked him to create something warm and welcoming for our hotel, and suggested a rabbit as the symbol. We wanted it to feel personal, with a bit of character.
When he delivered the first version, it was too casual, so we requested a little tweak—a doorman suit for the rabbit to make it fit with our hospitality vibe! The two leaf branches represent our commitment to sustainability and a greener travel experience. 
The final result felt just right – unique, welcoming and friendly!",1,1739186968.0,u_Bella-La-Bella,0,1.0,False
1im3ztl,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToxicRelationships/comments/1im3ztl/my_girlfriend_broke_up_with_me_for_the_second/,My girlfriend broke up with me for the second time and I am lost. I feel it's all my fault but I suspect some emotional abuse and manipulation. Please help me.,"Hello everyone,

I am writing this post because I feel completely lost. Sorry for the wall of text but I can’t stop overanalyzing what happened, and I desperately need an external perspective.

I was in a relationship with a woman who I believe was emotionally abusive, manipulative, and deeply unstable. But part of me still feels like I was the problem and I am guilty of losing her.

**Background on Her Life**

She grew up in an emotionally abusive household. Her mother was controlling, aggressive, and would scream and emotionally blackmail the family. Their parents divorced when she was little. Her father was passive and submissive, trying to keep the peace. Those dynamics still last to this day.

She both resents and seeks validation from her mother, constantly craving her approval despite recognizing the toxicity.
She told me she had never had a healthy relationship before. All of them ended in some disaster. Now, I think it's because of how she perceives love.

**How She Treated Me in the Relationship**

At the beginning, everything was perfect. She went fast, idolized me, called me the love of her life, and at the same time she kept me secret for the first 3 or 4 months - we were together 1 year more or less. She talked about marriage, kids and our future together almost immediately. But over time, things changed:
She expected me to conform to her ideal boyfriend model rather than valuing me for who I was.
She could not handle differences in opinions. If I disagreed, it was like I was attacking her.
She would lash out aggressively or in a manipulative manner when I set boundaries or expressed my needs.
She never apologized first, or I should say almost never. Whenever she hurt me, she would justify herself, rewrite history, or make it my fault.
When I made mistakes (and I did, because I’m not perfect), I would apologize and try to fix things, but it was never reciprocated.

**The First Breakup**

We were in a semi long-distance relationship. I traveled to see her many times (5 hour train), and whenever she came to my city, it was never just to see me - she always had other priorities. I was unemployed and I had more time to visit her. Nonetheless, I felt the commitment wasn’t the same. 

One night I told her this and she lashed out telling me that I should get over this as she had anxiety when she comes to our city and she needs to make time for everyone and that I should not stress her on this. I offered her to stay at my place when she came if that was stressful for her. “I want to be comfortable not in 15 square meters”. I felt very hurt, my commitment was total. But she never came back just for me.

The next day, she ghosted me the entire day. I waited for a message, and when she didn’t text, I messaged her asking her to return a camera I had lent her. She later told me that this was proof that I only cared about getting my things back.

She disappeared for three days. I kept texting, trying to get her to talk, to explain what had happened, but she always blamed me in her messages. Finally, I sent her a long message explaining my pain and confusion.

I see her in a park the next day and we argue and she fuckin applaude to me when I tell her what I did for her and what I do to build a future for me and then for us. 

We broke up. No contact for one week, then I called her. Then we got back together. But something started to seem off, as my trust was damaged.

**The Second Breakup**

One time, she came to my city, and we had planned to go for a walk together. That morning, her friend invited her for coffee with her mother, and she said yes without even asking me. 

When I pointed it out, she exploded:
She screamed at me, saying I was antisocial.
She compared me to her exes, claiming they were more involved in her social circle.
She said in a relationship, “we decide things for both of us,” implying that she had the right to decide what I should do without consulting me.
She left the house saying she didn’t want to see my face.

In the evening we had a party planned where she kissed me on the lips like nothing happened. I started noticing how unstable she was: she wanted me to call her ""love"" again almost immediately, even though I was still hurt. 

She came to my place to sleep and I tried to talk about the episode. She didn’t want to and shutted of. I tried 2 more times, I never could express my pain as it was my fault for bringing it up at the wrong times. I felt hurt but we kept in touch and I went to visit her in her city. 

Everything was strange because we kept in touch in a cold way, because she stopped called me love (even if she tried to “push” me with her behaviour). I went to her city also to fix things up: I expected her to recognize my pain and to…apologize. It was really that simple but she couldn’t. 

One day in her city she told me to start anew and I…asked her to apologize for that thing and she did with some… effort. From there I started to use more pet names but still not “love”: I told her “ I love you” in english and not in our native language and she felt offended. She stopped calling me love altogether while I tried to call her softer pet names. I come back to my city and we told each other how exciting it will be when she will come back in our city and we will do everything together: she was happy and even bought tickets for a show in our city. 

Then, we broke up the second time while video calling two days later, because I called her a soft pet name and not love, after we spent a weekend at her city where we argued three times for stupid things she brought up. It’s almost she started to see me as an enemy who wanted to punish her. I lost my temper and I didn’t want to talk to her. I didn’t insult her or anything, I was just…so done. I told her I didn’t want to talk to her and she went:”We need time from each other” and “Don’t be so fast to hang up as you will not see me for a long time” with a smirk on her face.

And, in fact, she went missing 14 days. I, of course, broke down and texted her to see each other to talk about it as two adults. She agrees and we go for a coffee.

When we start to talk about the breakup she started blaming me for everything: not having a solid future plan, not making enough sacrifices, not calling her the way she wanted. I confess that I feel guilty that if I called her love instead of listening to my scarred heart then she wouldn’t have left, but it seems off. I was very hurt and I tried to slowly feel trust for her and her love, and so I called other “softer” pet names. She wasn’t satisfied. And, of course, “I would have texted you if you did not, but you went first”.
She repeatedly criticized my family, calling them “inhospitable.” She knew how much that hurt me and she never apologized.
She expected me to always prioritize her, but if I asked for something in return, like validating my pain and my emotions, I was being selfish and “too sensitive” and “always anxious”.
Anyway, she broke up with me.

I desperately called her back and I tried to have a serious conversation about our relationship. 

I told her:

-We both grew up in toxic emotional environments and learned a distorted idea of love.
-In healthy love, we accept each other’s differences instead of trying to “win” over the other person.
-She had a pattern of destroying the relationship the moment she feared I would leave.
-She saw love as a power dynamic rather than mutual care where if one feels impeding abandonment then he/she should breakup first to avoid being abandoned.

Her reaction? 

She said I was the one afraid of abandonment.
She said I was the one trying to manipulate her and I was the one who saw her as an angel who had to save me.
She even denied yelling at me about the coffee, and then, when I pressed her, she said she was right to yell at me for what I told her that day (like involve me when deciding for things that alter the plans we made? As a couple?)
She said she couldn’t love someone who wasn’t “one” with her in every decision.
The final moment came when we saw each other at a bar and she told me she didn’t feel happy anymore and wanted to end the relationship for the good of us both. 

The causes?

- I didn’t call her love for 10 days and she wasn’t feeling loved. I, the hurt one, swallowed my pride and still did everything for her. But to call her love when she stomped me and never took accountability was too much, I needed time. She never cared to help me regain that trust with the communication. 

- I didn’t plan a future with her, not following her schizoid decisions: I wanted a plan that was solid, not a fantasy one. I needed time to know her better and to build a solid relationship. She didn’t have time (also the biological clock at 33 played a big role. I understand it and I wanted to be there for her to build a future but I started to feel neglected) and wanted me to follow her strange plans where she goes to a city for work, then 9 months later she leaves for another city. 

Anyway, I told her I didn’t want to be part of the decision - she was the one leaving.

Sometimes it felt like she discarded me for some fears embedded deeply in her, like some sort of BPD mechanics.

**Why I Feel Guilty Now**

I feel like I should have just called her ""love"" and suppressed my pain.
I feel like I should have adapted to her vision of a relationship.
I feel like maybe I should have compromised on our future plans to keep her.
I feel like I abandoned the ""hurt little girl"" inside her that I tried so hard to protect.
I gave everything, but she still left - twice.

Now, I can't stop feeling like it was my fault. That I could have saved this.

But what hurts the most is thinking she will move on easily, meet someone new, and be happy. That all my love, all my effort, was just a passing phase for her.

**TL;DR**

My ex had a history of emotional abuse from her mother and carried toxic relationship patterns into our relationship.
She never took responsibility for her actions, always flipped the blame on me, and used DARVO techniques.

Drinks alcohol on weekend  
Not a smoker  
Does not use recreational drugs

I am a 35 year old man with no history of seizures. I have no family history of epilepsy, to my knowledge. I had a seizure, out of the blue, last week, whilst in a supermarker, which resulted in a fracture to my scapula.

In the hospital afterwards I had a head CT scan, a heart ECG, and blood tests, none of which prompted any concern from the doctor.

I have been going round in circles worrying about what could have caused this and have listed several factors that may or may not be relevant. I am keen, really, to get a sense of whether this was likely provoked and, if so, by what.

1. I drank a lot of caffeine on the day of the seizure (4 cups of coffee and one cup of tea)- this is on the upper end of typical for me
2. I consumed a lot of sugar on the day of the seizure (two packets of sweets and two sugars in my tea)
3. I had a large breakfast but skipped lunch and had the seizure at 4.30 pm
4. I typically drink alcohol on weekends. I had abstained from alcohol entirely through January (dry january!), then drank on the first weekend of February. I had 8 pints of beer on the Saturday and 2 pints of cider on the Sunday. I did not drink on the monday or Tuesday. I had the seizure on Tuesday afternoon.
5. I took ginseng supplements for the first time, the night before and the morning of the day I had the seizure. I took 150mg the night before and 150mg the morning of, so consumed around 300mg in the 24 hours leading up to the seizure. I did notice when I took this the night before that I felt quite hot and mildly feverish for a small amount of time but thought nothing more of it.
6. I had been taking sildenafil for erectile dysfunction, sporadically, for around 6 months leading up to the seizure, including 75mg on the night before the seizure. 7. I was not severely sleep deprived. 8. I have ulcerative colitis which has been in remission for 18+ months and a blood test the week before my seizure showed no concerning inflammation.
7. I have had no recent concussions or head injuries.
8. A blood test, coincidentally carried out the week before the seizure showed that nothing was concerning but that my calcium levels were ever so slightly above the reference range (I take calcium+vitamin d supplements on prescription following cortico-steroid induced osteopenia). My testosterone was above the reference range, my albumin was also slightly high.
9. I have previously had a head MRI, about 18 months ago, which showed nothing concerning, beside nasal polyps.
10. I take 2.4 g of mesalamine a day for colitis and have taken this dose or higher for the past 7 years.
11. I take 40mg of adalimumab every two weeks and have done for the past 18+ months. 14. I have previously had several courses of prednisolone treatment for colitis flares, but had my last one 18+ months ago.

If there is anything that stands out from this list as potentially triggering a seizure I would be very grateful to hear it. My first hunch is ginseng, coupled with caffeine, given that this was the only 'out of the ordinary' thing I consumed leading up to the seizure, but I am glad to hear any suggestions.

I have a referral to a neurologist, which will occur at some point in the next 10 days, so I am really just looking for a theory to answer my anxiety about a possible relapse in the meantime!",1,1739186927.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False
1im3z97,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalabuse/comments/1im3z97/my_girlfriend_broke_up_with_me_for_the_second/,My girlfriend broke up with me for the second time and I am lost. I feel it's all my fault but I suspect some emotional abuse and manipulation. Please help me.,"Hello everyone,

I am writing this post because I feel completely lost. Sorry for the wall of text but I can’t stop overanalyzing what happened, and I desperately need an external perspective.

I was in a relationship with a woman who I believe was emotionally abusive, manipulative, and deeply unstable. But part of me still feels like I was the problem and I am guilty of losing her.

**Background on Her Life**

She grew up in an emotionally abusive household. Her mother was controlling, aggressive, and would scream and emotionally blackmail the family. Their parents divorced when she was little. Her father was passive and submissive, trying to keep the peace. Those dynamics still last to this day.

She both resents and seeks validation from her mother, constantly craving her approval despite recognizing the toxicity.
She told me she had never had a healthy relationship before. All of them ended in some disaster. Now, I think it's because of how she perceives love.

**How She Treated Me in the Relationship**

At the beginning, everything was perfect. She went fast, idolized me, called me the love of her life, and at the same time she kept me secret for the first 3 or 4 months - we were together 1 year more or less. She talked about marriage, kids and our future together almost immediately. But over time, things changed:
She expected me to conform to her ideal boyfriend model rather than valuing me for who I was.
She could not handle differences in opinions. If I disagreed, it was like I was attacking her.
She would lash out aggressively or in a manipulative manner when I set boundaries or expressed my needs.
She never apologized first, or I should say almost never. Whenever she hurt me, she would justify herself, rewrite history, or make it my fault.
When I made mistakes (and I did, because I’m not perfect), I would apologize and try to fix things, but it was never reciprocated.

**The First Breakup**

We were in a semi long-distance relationship. I traveled to see her many times (5 hour train), and whenever she came to my city, it was never just to see me - she always had other priorities. I was unemployed and I had more time to visit her. Nonetheless, I felt the commitment wasn’t the same. 

One night I told her this and she lashed out telling me that I should get over this as she had anxiety when she comes to our city and she needs to make time for everyone and that I should not stress her on this. I offered her to stay at my place when she came if that was stressful for her. “I want to be comfortable not in 15 square meters”. I felt very hurt, my commitment was total. But she never came back just for me.

The next day, she ghosted me the entire day. I waited for a message, and when she didn’t text, I messaged her asking her to return a camera I had lent her. She later told me that this was proof that I only cared about getting my things back.

She disappeared for three days. I kept texting, trying to get her to talk, to explain what had happened, but she always blamed me in her messages. Finally, I sent her a long message explaining my pain and confusion.

I see her in a park the next day and we argue and she fuckin applaude to me when I tell her what I did for her and what I do to build a future for me and then for us. 

We broke up. No contact for one week, then I called her. Then we got back together. But something started to seem off, as my trust was damaged.

**The Second Breakup**

One time, she came to my city, and we had planned to go for a walk together. That morning, her friend invited her for coffee with her mother, and she said yes without even asking me. 

When I pointed it out, she exploded:
She screamed at me, saying I was antisocial.
She compared me to her exes, claiming they were more involved in her social circle.
She said in a relationship, “we decide things for both of us,” implying that she had the right to decide what I should do without consulting me.
She left the house saying she didn’t want to see my face.

In the evening we had a party planned where she kissed me on the lips like nothing happened. I started noticing how unstable she was: she wanted me to call her ""love"" again almost immediately, even though I was still hurt. 

She came to my place to sleep and I tried to talk about the episode. She didn’t want to and shutted of. I tried 2 more times, I never could express my pain as it was my fault for bringing it up at the wrong times. I felt hurt but we kept in touch and I went to visit her in her city. 

Everything was strange because we kept in touch in a cold way, because she stopped called me love (even if she tried to “push” me with her behaviour). I went to her city also to fix things up: I expected her to recognize my pain and to…apologize. It was really that simple but she couldn’t. 

One day in her city she told me to start anew and I…asked her to apologize for that thing and she did with some… effort. From there I started to use more pet names but still not “love”: I told her “ I love you” in english and not in our native language and she felt offended. She stopped calling me love altogether while I tried to call her softer pet names. I come back to my city and we told each other how exciting it will be when she will come back in our city and we will do everything together: she was happy and even bought tickets for a show in our city. 

Then, we broke up the second time while video calling two days later, because I called her a soft pet name and not love, after we spent a weekend at her city where we argued three times for stupid things she brought up. It’s almost she started to see me as an enemy who wanted to punish her. I lost my temper and I didn’t want to talk to her. I didn’t insult her or anything, I was just…so done. I told her I didn’t want to talk to her and she went:”We need time from each other” and “Don’t be so fast to hang up as you will not see me for a long time” with a smirk on her face.

And, in fact, she went missing 14 days. I, of course, broke down and texted her to see each other to talk about it as two adults. She agrees and we go for a coffee.

When we start to talk about the breakup she started blaming me for everything: not having a solid future plan, not making enough sacrifices, not calling her the way she wanted. I confess that I feel guilty that if I called her love instead of listening to my scarred heart then she wouldn’t have left, but it seems off. I was very hurt and I tried to slowly feel trust for her and her love, and so I called other “softer” pet names. She wasn’t satisfied. And, of course, “I would have texted you if you did not, but you went first”.
She repeatedly criticized my family, calling them “inhospitable.” She knew how much that hurt me and she never apologized.
She expected me to always prioritize her, but if I asked for something in return, like validating my pain and my emotions, I was being selfish and “too sensitive” and “always anxious”.
Anyway, she broke up with me.

I desperately called her back and I tried to have a serious conversation about our relationship. 

I told her:

-We both grew up in toxic emotional environments and learned a distorted idea of love.
-In healthy love, we accept each other’s differences instead of trying to “win” over the other person.
-She had a pattern of destroying the relationship the moment she feared I would leave.
-She saw love as a power dynamic rather than mutual care where if one feels impeding abandonment then he/she should breakup first to avoid being abandoned.

Her reaction? 

She said I was the one afraid of abandonment.
She said I was the one trying to manipulate her and I was the one who saw her as an angel who had to save me.
She even denied yelling at me about the coffee, and then, when I pressed her, she said she was right to yell at me for what I told her that day (like involve me when deciding for things that alter the plans we made? As a couple?)
She said she couldn’t love someone who wasn’t “one” with her in every decision.
The final moment came when we saw each other at a bar and she told me she didn’t feel happy anymore and wanted to end the relationship for the good of us both. 

The causes?

- I didn’t call her love for 10 days and she wasn’t feeling loved. I, the hurt one, swallowed my pride and still did everything for her. But to call her love when she stomped me and never took accountability was too much, I needed time. She never cared to help me regain that trust with the communication. 

- I didn’t plan a future with her, not following her schizoid decisions: I wanted a plan that was solid, not a fantasy one. I needed time to know her better and to build a solid relationship. She didn’t have time (also the biological clock at 33 played a big role. I understand it and I wanted to be there for her to build a future but I started to feel neglected) and wanted me to follow her strange plans where she goes to a city for work, then 9 months later she leaves for another city. 

Anyway, I told her I didn’t want to be part of the decision - she was the one leaving.

Sometimes it felt like she discarded me for some fears embedded deeply in her, like some sort of BPD mechanics.

**Why I Feel Guilty Now**

I feel like I should have just called her ""love"" and suppressed my pain.
I feel like I should have adapted to her vision of a relationship.
I feel like maybe I should have compromised on our future plans to keep her.
I feel like I abandoned the ""hurt little girl"" inside her that I tried so hard to protect.
I gave everything, but she still left - twice.

Now, I can't stop feeling like it was my fault. That I could have saved this.

But what hurts the most is thinking she will move on easily, meet someone new, and be happy. That all my love, all my effort, was just a passing phase for her.

**TL;DR**

My ex had a history of emotional abuse from her mother and carried toxic relationship patterns into our relationship.
She never took responsibility for her actions, always flipped the blame on me, and used DARVO techniques.
She left me twice, and I was always the one trying to fix things.
Now, she’s gone, but I feel guilty as if I was the problem.

I come back to my city and we told each other how exciting it will be when she will come back in our city and we will do everything together: she was happy and even bought tickets for a show in our city. 

Then, we broke up the second time while video calling two days later, because I called her a soft pet name and not love, after we spent a weekend at her city where we argued three times for stupid things she brought up. It’s almost she started to see me as an enemy who wanted to punish her. I lost my temper and I didn’t want to talk to her. I didn’t insult her or anything, I was just…so done. I told her I didn’t want to talk to her and she went:”We need time from each other” and “Don’t be so fast to hang up as you will not see me for a long time” with a smirk on her face.

And, in fact, she went missing 14 days. I, of course, broke down and texted her to see each other to talk about it as two adults. She agrees and we go for a coffee.

When we start to talk about the breakup she started blaming me for everything: not having a solid future plan, not making enough sacrifices, not calling her the way she wanted. I confess that I feel guilty that if I called her love instead of listening to my scarred heart then she wouldn’t have left, but it seems off. I was very hurt and I tried to slowly feel trust for her and her love, and so I called other “softer” pet names. She wasn’t satisfied. And, of course, “I would have texted you if you did not, but you went first”.
She repeatedly criticized my family, calling them “inhospitable.” She knew how much that hurt me and she never apologized.
She expected me to always prioritize her, but if I asked for something in return, like validating my pain and my emotions, I was being selfish and “too sensitive” and “always anxious”.
Anyway, she broke up with me.

I desperately called her back and I tried to have a serious conversation about our relationship. 

I told her:

-We both grew up in toxic emotional environments and learned a distorted idea of love.
-In healthy love, we accept each other’s differences instead of trying to “win” over the other person.
-She had a pattern of destroying the relationship the moment she feared I would leave.
-She saw love as a power dynamic rather than mutual care where if one feels impeding abandonment then he/she should breakup first to avoid being abandoned.

Her reaction? 

She said I was the one afraid of abandonment.
She said I was the one trying to manipulate her and I was the one who saw her as an angel who had to save me.
She even denied yelling at me about the coffee, and then, when I pressed her, she said she was right to yell at me for what I told her that day (like involve me when deciding for things that alter the plans we made? As a couple?)
She said she couldn’t love someone who wasn’t “one” with her in every decision.
The final moment came when we saw each other at a bar and she told me she didn’t feel happy anymore and wanted to end the relationship for the good of us both. 

The causes?

- I didn’t call her love for 10 days and she wasn’t feeling loved. I, the hurt one, swallowed my pride and still did everything for her. But to call her love when she stomped me and never took accountability was too much, I needed time. She never cared to help me regain that trust with the communication. 

- I didn’t plan a future with her, not following her schizoid decisions: I wanted a plan that was solid, not a fantasy one. I needed time to know her better and to build a solid relationship. She didn’t have time (also the biological clock at 33 played a big role. I understand it and I wanted to be there for her to build a future but I started to feel neglected) and wanted me to follow her strange plans where she goes to a city for work, then 9 months later she leaves for another city. 

Anyway, I told her I didn’t want to be part of the decision - she was the one leaving.

Sometimes it felt like she discarded me for some fears embedded deeply in her, like some sort of BPD mechanics.

**Why I Feel Guilty Now**

I feel like I should have just called her ""love"" and suppressed my pain.
I feel like I should have adapted to her vision of a relationship.
I feel like maybe I should have compromised on our future plans to keep her.
I feel like I abandoned the ""hurt little girl"" inside her that I tried so hard to protect.
I gave everything, but she still left - twice.

Now, I can't stop feeling like it was my fault. That I could have saved this.

But what hurts the most is thinking she will move on easily, meet someone new, and be happy. That all my love, all my effort, was just a passing phase for her.

**TL;DR**

My ex had a history of emotional abuse from her mother and carried toxic relationship patterns into our relationship.
She never took responsibility for her actions, always flipped the blame on me, and used DARVO techniques.
She left me twice, and I was always the one trying to fix things.
Now, she’s gone, but I feel guilty as if I was the problem.

Thank you to anyone who takes the time to read this. I really need some perspective.

How did this pass with galaxy gas being such a problem right now too! Maybe they already had it in production before they were aware it was an issue? Nonetheless I feel like it was a little odd nonetheless and I just hate how it can potentially be promoting galaxy gas/ whip it or triggering people who may have /had addictions to it.

So many weird food commercials this year.

The date lasted exactly one hour, he said "" Ok, so time to go"" or something like that 😅. We had a coffee and just talked. Everything went very well,  conversation was interesting. After that date he's been texting me first every day, as in how's your day going? How's your kid? . We don't exchange many messages because I work full time and have a 3 year old child. He is single with no children but has several companies, so he is also busy person even though he doesn't work on weekends.

So we were texting on a Friday afternoon (17:00-18:00h)  to see each other that same night, I noticed him a little doubtful because I could only meet him at 22h. Well, finally he tells me to put it off for another day simply because he was comfortable in his bed. But I only had free time in one more week after that day, I told him ""Oh, ok don't worry, I will have my child these days but we can do something next weekend"". He was just fine with it. 

Something tells me that he is not really interested but I have doubts because I know that there are people who take their time and go very slowly.

1im3uig,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1im3uig,Finally went to Cornelia St. (in Baguio),"(Not sure if correct flair)

Went to this really pretty Taylor Swift-themed cafe in Baguio City. Name is Cornelia St. and it’s located on 3 Navy Rd, Baguio, 2600 Benguet.

They have a wide variety of drinks — coffee-based, frappes, milkshakes but me and my bf ordered their Fortnight (gray) and Midnight Rain (purple) drink which are both cola-based.

They have a wall full of Taylor Swift vinyls and I super love na they were playing the Reputation album when we were there because I’ve always been a Rep gurlie.

This cafe is also perfect if you’re a toy collector  as they have a lot of displays.

Ayun lang! If you’re living in Baguio City or have an upcoming Baguio City trip, you might wanna include this in your itinerary. Mwamwa!",1,1739186371.0,TaylorSwiftPH,1,1.0,False

Unfortunately, the kitchen is very big but has a lot of “wasted” space which makes it hard to work in (small counter space, where the coffee machine currently is).

I need help with how I can make use of the empty space (114cm/45 inches) to make the kitchen more functional, without it being too renovation-heavy. I am also unable to find the same or similar counter/cabinet collection, so extending the existing ones is not possible.

We currently don’t have enough space for all our dishes and no drawers for cultery either, so we are using a buffet (see picture) that came with the apartment to store most of our things, but this arrangement is impractical and visually unappealing.

One idea we had was to extend the counter to the right of the fridge by using a wood counter that looks like the island’s counter, along with curtains to cover the cabinets underneath (see example picture).

1im3ppo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Schwab/comments/1im3ppo/i_made_a_bonehead_options_move_help/,I made a bonehead options move. Help!,"...I think I have a legit excuse; had three surgeries in the past month and a half and have the worst cold I've had in ages, so please keep the scolding to a minimum. I've already kicked my own ass over this.

So here's the deal. I do not short sell, I do not use margins. It's far too risky for me. However, I do trade options sometimes if the open interest and volume is right. I also took a lot of cash out of my Schwab cash account to cover the time off from my real job (I only dabble in trading when I'm not working) to recover from the surgeries and just pay medical bills.

When I trade options, I watch them like a hawk.

Anyway, bought one long put contract with a popular ETF Wednesday last week. I was all set to close the position at a loss on Friday, but an emergency health issue came up and I had a nurse stop by urgently to assist me with the issue. My mind lost track of all the other stuff as my problem was resolved, but Saturday morning I went to my account and saw my put was auto-exercised because it was ITM. I do not have the cash to purchase the underlying shares, so I pretty much added insult to injury and almost had a coronary event.

I called Schwab for guidance, but the broker I spoke to clearly had too much coffee - or something else - while I was still exhausted. His advice pretty much went into one ear and out the other, but I got the impression I was safe here. I currently have a shorted stock sale transaction sitting in my open positions list and a buying power amount in the negative by a lot of money.

Just in case, I added margin trading to my account yesterday, and the price of the ETF is currently still falling.

At this point, what I would like to do is get the heck out of this mess while keeping as much money as possible. What do I need to do, other than adding a DNE clause to my contract so this doesn't happen again? Do I need to buy them on margin and sell them again? Or do I need to wait for the market to open today to see that all the negative numbers to become positive?",1,1739185844.0,Schwab,0,1.0,False

LLM Translation:

>**The Reasons to Say Goodbye to the Italian Coffee Maker and Start Drinking Real Coffee**

>Almost every Spaniard has an Italian coffee maker at home, but it is not the best option if we are talking about specialty coffee. This method, although traditional and beloved by many, has limitations that affect the final quality of the coffee we consume daily.

>The main issue with the Italian coffee maker lies in its extraction system. The water heats up from the bottom chamber and is pushed through the ground coffee by steam pressure. This process can easily lead to over-extraction, where the coffee becomes too bitter and loses its natural nuances. Over-extraction occurs because the water passes through the coffee at a temperature higher than ideal, and for a longer period than recommended.

>Additionally, the Italian coffee maker does not allow precise control over the extraction variables, such as temperature and pressure, which are key to achieving a balanced and flavorful cup. For coffee enthusiasts looking to enjoy the full range of flavors and aromas that specialty coffee offers, this lack of control is a significant disadvantage.

>Fortunately, there are alternative methods that allow better extraction and highlight the unique characteristics of each coffee. Some of the most popular methods among coffee lovers include:

>**French Press:** This method allows the coffee’s natural oils and flavors to be extracted without applying extreme pressure or heat. It results in a fuller-bodied cup with rich flavors.

>**V60 or Chemex:** These manual drip methods provide precise control over the brewing process, allowing coffee’s natural notes to shine. They are ideal for those who enjoy experimenting with different grind sizes and brewing times.

>**Aeropress:** A versatile tool that combines pressure and filtering, offering a clean and balanced cup. It’s easy to use and allows for a wide range of brewing techniques.

>**Home Espresso Machine:** While more expensive, this option allows for the preparation of high-quality espresso, similar to what we find in specialty coffee shops. It provides control over pressure and temperature, essential for a perfect extraction.

>In conclusion, while the Italian coffee maker has been a faithful companion in many homes, exploring new brewing methods can elevate our coffee experience, allowing us to appreciate the true flavors and nuances of each bean.",1,1739185505.0,JamesHoffmann,13,0.55,False

As may be the case with many of you, Frasier is often on our screen at any time during the day from Sunday morning coffee, afternoon or evening.

Recently Miracle on 3rd or 4th Street was on and we noticed that Frasier referred to shopping for presents and said that Santa would be very good to Frederick this year. This is obviously vague enough to be fine for little ears without causing issue. 

But thinking ahead to other Christmas episodes such as Frasier Grinch, has anyone ever had an inadvertent Santa issue from little ones seeing a Frasier Christmas episode?

Or does the show generally leave enough unsaid to avoid problems?

After I graduated from university a few years back, I started going to coffee shops regularly to do my laptop work. The best part of it has been becoming acquainted with several super kind baristas, many of whom I stay in touch with outside of the shops! The kindness and charm of baristas has added so much joy and fulfillment to my quite-minimal social life. And kindness is my biggest value in my life, especially after being mercilessly bullied by other boys throughout my childhood for my differences. I am immediately attracted to people if they outwardly practice kindness, both platonically and romantically.

However, things started getting complicated when a few months back, I started to develop a major crush on a new barista (24F). She'd been SO kind, and seemed so genuine. And best of all; we had many common interests, which feels like such a rarity! To make a long story short, one day last month, I made some poor social-skills decisions around her while standing idly at the bar while she was working (i.e. getting way too personal about my life, inappropriate info-dumping). I then confessed my feelings for her while crying in shame and social-skills-insecurity. She kindly let me know that she wasn't interested, but then she texted me the following day asking me to leave her alone for the foreseeable future, since I was overwhelming her. I haven't interacted with her since and absolutely respect her boundaries, although it hurts my already-awful self-esteem. I've never dated before and have never been successful with girls reciprocating feelings, and this was the first instance since my college years that I began to really develop feelings for someone... so much so that I didn't want to admit it to myself. It's because I'd sworn I was ""unlovable"" due to my autism, which I now know is not true.

Four days later, after working through that catastrophe with my therapist, I entered a random bookstore, and was greeted with the kindest, most pleasant welcome by one of the most strikingly beautiful, caring women I'd ever seen (24F). She's an employee of the store. I'd bought a book that night, which she'd recommended, after talking to her further. After leaving, her all-around beauty and kindness STUCK with me throughout the week. I'd realized I'd quickly developed a NEW major crush... on her. And this time, I was motivated to put in the WORK to make sure the connection didn't go sour like it had with the barista four days prior. That was also when I truly learned through my therapist that it was service workers' *obligations* to be nice as part of their jobs... I'm not sure how I'd only JUST learned that at 24.

After more therapist discussion, thorough planning, and a lot of video research on ""how to 'hit on' a service worker when it's their job to be nice"", I found myself back at the store at roughly the same time the following week, in hopes she'd be there. And she was; she remembered me and I had conversations about various topics READY! We chatted with great joy and smiles. I mentioned at one point ""I know it's your job to be nice"", and then her co-worker chimed in from across the room and said ""she really is this nice in real life, I promise!"" That sent my heart flying. I also opened up about my autism to her, after asking about autism-themed books. After I bought a zine, I passed her a specifically-for-this-moment business card that had my personal phone number *written* on it in gold Sharpie.

There was no response or acknowledgement throughout the following week, which I was completely ready for. While I tried to tell myself that the lack of contacting me was closure that she didn't have feelings for me, I still had no way of truly knowing. She could be too busy, for all I know.

Then, after serious thought and hesitance, I found myself back in the bookstore yet another time, exactly one week later again (this past Thursday), this time at a slightly-earlier time in the day (so it wouldn't look too stalker-ish). Since she was there again, I told her ""hi"" and she addressed me back by my name with a smile. Our conversation went great and made me so happy! At least I think it went great; I seriously struggle to make eye contact and can't read body language to save my life, especially since I'm spending all of my energy trying to make sure I'm saying the right thing. I told her about an upcoming performance I was planning, and she said ""let me know when it is! I'd love to come!"" That made the idea of her being interested in me even more unclear, since I learned the hard way that sometimes people don't mean it when they say things like that.

My biggest question now is... what on earth is next? I have no idea how she actually perceives me, since it's her ""job to be nice"". I hesitate to go for a 4th Thursday in a row since I don't want to continue to look like the ""clingy under-socialized autistic guy"", which I know I come across as to a lot of people, and I worry about looking like that to her. The shop is having a Valentine's Day social event a day later, but she's the biggest motivator for me to go to the bookstore and I don't know if she works on Fridays. Should I follow her on Instagram and DM her to ask her about the event? Should I go on the Thursday and boldly ask her out straight-up since that's the only way I'll have that closure on how she perceives me, although I'd risk sounding too invasive? Should I just go to the Friday event and try to think about her as little as possible so I don't risk getting disappointed as much?

Endlessly grateful to my therapist for her help through all of this, but I'd love to get several other opinions on this situation, especially from anyone who's been in a similar situation, so I can be absolutely CERTAIN I don't cause the train-wreck I did last time. Thank you for your help!

She’s not super famous, but she’s well-known and highly admired in our community. I’m not sure how to go about it.

I was on time, and she was already there. As soon as she saw me, her eyes lit up, her face beaming with a beautiful blinding smile. I had the same smile, but my eyes were more tired.. more sad. She excitedly ran towards me and hugged me, and I gave her a short half-hug.

 She proceeded to tell me about her day, yapping happily, hands in the air. I was looking at my phone as she spoke. Her face dropped and she apologized for boring me. I put down my phone, took her hand, and told her she should never apologize for things that aren't her fault. She cocked her head, not understanding. But I know she will. Eventually. 

I smiled at her and told her that I'm fine, and I apologized for my rudeness. She smiled at me, that beautiful joyous smile, and asked me if I was happy. I faltered, tears welled up in my eyes. All she ever wanted was to be happy, and I asked for her forgiveness. I told her I wasn't, but I know I will be. Soon. She squeezed my hand and told me that being happy was easy. That I should just think positively. I smiled back, knowing how naive she was of what was to come. I wanted to tell her to change.. to stop.. to be better.. to act more mature.. to be smarter so she wouldn't get so heartbroken and taken advantage of.. but I couldn't. I wanted to shield her from the horrid things this world will do to her, but I know I couldn't...I shouldn't. So I just squeezed her hand back, and holding back my tears, I told her.. ""Yes.. it'll be okay. Everything will be okay.""

Look at you, finally got to be intimate with someone physically. Good for you. Funny how you instantly pursued a girl in a span of less than two months when we've been talking for more than a year and I still wasn't worth it because I'm too far. I'm not bitter though, but the thought just hurts, doesn't it? Of all the guys I've shared genuine connections with, I regret meeting you the most. How I wish I did not take the risk and gave you the privilege of being loved by me.

I appreciated all of your efforts, though. It was kind of you to have 2-night visits here, bought me my favorite coffee when it gets stressful at work. But my defense mechanism got the best of me; I can't keep my hopes up knowing that you haven't communicated properly that you want to build a relationship. I needed the reassurance because what's the point? 

There's always a ""but"" to all. You REALLY like me and care for me, BUT. I was the one you wanted to build a relationship with, BUT. Tangina naman ng but na yan. I've been patient and settled with the confusing set up we had even when it kept me overthinking because I liked you, PERIOD. But just like any other human being, napapagod din. As much as I wanted to be yours, you just can't do it. So what's the point? 

It sucks because it still hurts. What waste of time and tears. And there you are, finally spending moments with someone you see fit to pursue because she's near. Good for you.

their adj ebitda has been growing 46% from q3 23 to q3 24 and they say on their q3 report that they ""continue to drive towards structural, consistant profitable growth. They do have quite a lot of debt, but that doesn't scare me enough to take a bet on their stock.

  
I think their new ceo is doing a good job it seems, and with his background at mars inc. I think he is able to help turn around the business.

Today when I started grinding a coffee a heard very unpleasant noise. I opened a grinder and I saw this bloody nut stuck between grinder parts. Funny thing is I haven't even touched this thing, and I only have this machine for a month or so.

Recommendations?","I really enjoyed Gilmore Girls growing up with their witty conversations, fast paced speech, kooky characters, and the feeling of the town ""Stars Hallow"" having some history with the occult. I was hoping for something with a similar vibe that leans more into the paranormal stuff and maybe even has escalating stakes where the main character has something like a chosen one status and is expected to save everyone somehow. 

I enjoy witches, at least the portrayals I grew up with in the 90's and 2000's with stuff like The Craft, Sabrina (the satanism stuff of the new one felt off), and practical Magic. As well as the Harry Potter series and most of the depictions that seem to frame it as sisterhood, femineity, socialization/ community, a return to nature/ communion with the natural world and things that stay hidden. 

That being said Witchcraft is not a requirement, more recently Umbrella Academy fits as well but it is more superpower school, and a bit rushed in my opinion. I would like for the characters to have periods where they can relax and socialize like normal people their age. Date, study, get coffee, and hang-out together like most young adults do. 

As for the escalation I really enjoyed some webnovels like Worm by Wildbow and The Wandering Inn by Pirateaba. As well as some printed Urban and magic school based fantasy novels like Harry Potter, Kingkiller Chronicles, The Magicians Show was okay, but I never actually read the books. Some shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer have a similar vibe as well if you move past the campiness and monster of the week and pay attention to the underlying themes. 

I don't know if there is an actual genre to this kind of thing but I'm referring to it as Dark Academia because the clothing aesthetic matches well with the vibe, and it feels like a good descriptor for Fall and Winter creepy school life with undertones of mystery and the supernatural.",0,1739184374.0,printSF,19,0.38,False

I did discuss these concerns with my doctor but I have a family member on it who is doing well so I decided to take the leap.

I am currently on the lowest dose of 2.5 and I have almost no appetite; it’s hard to imagine increasing my dose. I am only on my 2nd dose and have to assume that I will build tolerance to it, and that is why the dose is going to get increased, but I was curious if other people experienced such a sharp decline in appetite just from the smallest dose?

For reference, yesterday I had half an omelette for breakfast, and a bowl of soup for lunch. Today I had a whole omelette (230 calories, freezer premade) and a Bibigo chicken terriyaki rice bowl (480 calories) for the whole day. I didn’t really eat dinner before Zep, and now I definitely dont because I get nauseous in the middle of the night if I eat after 5pm. Last week, I tried getting an iced coffee with my breakfast but ended up having to sip it over several hours because the milk was too filling to have after my breakfast food. In comparison, I was eating 2-3,000 calories a day before starting. 

I definitely would expect this level of appetite suppression at a higher dose, but is it normal for the lowest dose? My doctor has me scheduled to increase dose after 4 weeks, but at this rate I feel I would be eating “nothing” if the appetite suppressant gets any stronger… lol",1,1739184232.0,Zepbound,3,1.0,False

* Creates a strong leverage for listings such as Coinbase who Base is native to
* Base ethos is strongly aligned with our ethos at Kendu - building and organic growth
* Price increase on Base will increase price on both Sol and Eth Kendu too - it is the same token

About the freshness can't say for sure , i threw the packet in morning . But it definitely has a very strong pre ground aroma.

**Kendu has bridged to base!**

Kendu has just recently been made available on Base via a wormhole bridge.

It is the same Kendu, just now with even more accessibility and a chance to grab it on Base if thats what you prefer!

**How is this beneficial?**

* Kendu can be grabbed at a much lower transactional cost now
* Increased volume
* Base builder availability - Many people who dont like the L1 Eth or even Sol can grab on their preferred option
* Future ready - Making onboarding extremely easy and giving people many different access options
* Creates a strong leverage for listings such as Coinbase who Base is native to
* Base ethos is strongly aligned with our ethos at Kendu - building and organic growth
* Price increase on Base will increase price on both Sol and Eth Kendu too - it is the same token

This bridge is a massive building block in the name of setting Kendu up for success. It allows us to be bullrun ready and easily available for all to join the movement in getting this to the deca billions.

1im38jd,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1im38jd/teaching_elven_maidens_how_to_use_mech_weapons/,Teaching Elven Maidens How To Use Mech Weapons,"The class stood quiet as their professor fiddled with the imposing hulk of man-shaped metal in the middle of nowhere. It looked like a thing they had seen in news feeds and the extremely few internet videos they were able to see. But that was nothing compared to the much bigger one off to the left. The girls all stood to attention, a class of twenty high school seniors, a mixture of elves of all kinds, including two half elven orcs. Watching closely from the side-lines, still holding her morning coffee was the school Dean, also an Elf. Their teacher was a human named Andrew. They were all surprised to see him walking around because normally he was in a wheelchair.



""Okay all set... Uhh… Power core... Safe. Good! Ladies! Welcome!"" Andrew said as he gingerly stepped away from the odd machine.



He hobbled towards them and tried to stay steady. Obviously he was still getting his sea legs. ""Sorry about the hobbling and such, I'm still getting used to this exo thing. Needs adjusting. Anyway, Welcome to your Firearms Certification Test! I have gotten in touch with a buddy of mine, that guy there..."" He said, gesturing to the human polishing the BIG machine. ""To run something both fun AND educational. And also legal. Which is why he's here. I managed to get permission to borrow one of these for the lesson!""



He pressed a button on the odd set of armour and it suddenly released an odd hum of energy. It stood to full height of eight feet tall and with a series of clunky mechanical motions stood to attention. The front of its armor plating splayed open like a blooming flower, exposing its insides. Insides that looked strangely comfortable, with leather lining seat cushions and a... cup holder. For some reason. The larger machine also emitted a strange pulse of energy, its reactor starting up.



Both machines were coloured in a pale blue, with various parts such as steps, legs and heavy parts painted a bright yellow or light orange. The smaller machine looked like a fancy version of a set of Knights armour, excluding the flamboyant cloak and large kite shield reminiscent of this kind of style. The larger machine looked like a miniaturized version of the AT-AT from Star Wars, only around twenty feet high and looking significantly more advanced, with a dog-like body and legs, looking significantly more agile and articulate than its movie-counterpart.



""This is the Io Polytechnic Series Two Type Three Powered Armour Exoskeleton. Power Armour basically. Today... You're going to learn how to use it, in order to earn your Advanced Armaments Certifications. Questions?"" Andrew asked his class.



The girls all looked at each other, concerned, scared and confused. One girl, Leiliani, a Dark elf raised a hand after a time. ""Uhm... Why do we need an Advanced Armaments Certification, sir?""



""Good question! Do you have any ambitions to join the Fleet, become an Independent Starship Pilot or otherwise? If you do, an Advanced Armaments Certification is mandatory, if you intend on deploying any kind of spacecraft or advanced aircraft in any capacity. In short, this Certification will allow you to use the BIG guns on starships and other heavy grade weapons. This will fast track you to a career in space ship ownership!"" Andrew said.



The girl's eyes lit up with excitement. One girl, a Wood Elf named Emory excitedly raised her hand. ""Y-you mean if we get this advanced certification thingy we're gonna go to space!?"" She asked.



""Well no. But it will mean you have completed step one in getting a full pilot's license and other certifications you need to own or operate a star faring vessel. This will fast track progress if you want to be a starship crew member. If you don't want to do that though, the Certification will allow you to engage in various other industries, including jobs in manufacturing, industry, weapons production, mining. There's a LOT you can do with an Advanced license. Including being able to one day, pilot that thing."" Andrew replied, gesturing to the giant machine nearby.



Some girls bit their lower lips or pattered their feet excitedly at the concept. The youngest of the group, a short Sprite Elf raised her hand. ""Yes, Kahlia? You have a question?""



""Yes sir. Where's your wheelchair?"" She asked, tilting her head curiously.



""Oh that! I forgot. Right. This is an Exoskeleton!"" Andrew said and walked to them so they could take a closer look.



Andrew's body was covered in some kind of thin metallic skeleton of some kind, almost imperceptible at a distance. It was underneath his clothing but there was enough of it he could show it off to them. ""Its basically the same technology as that powered armour suit, except..."" Andrew turned around to show them the cables and wiring poking into the back of his neck. ""This one, is a sort of semi-implant. I finally got approved to use a prototype earlier this month. But anyway, I'll explain that better later. Time for you to do your work. Hey MORTY! They're good to go!"" Andrew yelled.



The pilot that owned the big one jumped down with a loud thud on the ground and walked up to each girl, shaking her hand with a smile. ""Hello there ladies! My name is Mortimer, I will be your Certified Instructor for today! Today I will be teaching you how to use the powered exosuit, and more importantly how to use its advanced suite of weaponry. Your teacher is going to have himself a sit-down and I'll take over your lesson today."" Mortimer said with a chuckle.



""I'd forgotten how exhausting it was to walk everywhere..."" Andrew said as he sat in a chair.



""It'll take you a while to get used to it, Corporal, just don't rest too long. Need to activate those new nerves and blood vessels you got."" Mortimer said as Andrew chuckled dismissively.



Mortimer brought his students close to the powered suit and showed them how it worked. Kahlia, the smallest of the Elves, was volunteered for the job of sitting inside it and showing how everything functioned.



""I wasn't able to get any real approval for one of the more advanced models, those things are... VERY expensive, so this was the best I could get at short notice. Now... Can anybody tell me how it actuates?"" Mortimer asked.



The girls all looked closely at the machine, past their adorably small classmate and took careful note of its interior. One girl raised her hand. ""Uhh… Does it have something to do with all these dots that are all over the place? Is it something to do with the hexagon pattern?""



""Correct! This is a principle we got from an old anime called Appleseed. The very same technology used for animation motion capture, is deployed here to move the machine. Each of these dots in the internal hex is a small micro-camera. This micro-camera feeds the muscle movements into the internal computer, which then turns that into motion. Anybody have any idea how that works?"" Mortimer asked as he demonstrated by moving Kahlia's arm, which then moved the mech's arm.



The girls glanced at each other, then each one took a turn to use poor Kahlia as a puppet to try to figure out how it worked. In the end Kahlia herself spoke up. ""Uhm... It doesn't look like it's too fast or anything so... I'm guessing that the pilot also wears some kind of undersuit that connects to the thing?""



""CORRECT! Well spotted. Each pilot for these early models also wears an advanced nanosuit that has special things woven into the fabric that better interface with the system, making the cameras more effective at capturing motions from the pilot. It CAN work without it, but not as effectively. We don't need that for this, so that's why you won't be putting one on. Now out of there quick. Let me show you how this works."" Mortimer asked and gently helped Kahlia out of the machine.



He hopped in and started explaining how to 'put it on'. ""Make sure you are seated properly and comfortable, make sure feet are in stirrups provided. Now you push this purple button here, and...""



He pressed the button and the legs, waist and feet of the machine closed up, encircling his legs and torso.



""There. Now put your hands in the control pods here, and press the trigger under your left pinkie finger. Its this one here."" He said, then demonstrated. The armour suit fully closed around him, locking itself in place.



""Now, this is the important part. Pay VERY close attention okay? If there is an emergency, you yell out 'EJECT!'"" He said with a loud shout. The machine immediately popped open and the plating parted, then Mortimer popped out like the machine just acted like a pez dispenser.



""Just in case something goes wrong or you feel panicked, just yell eject, the machine will effectively spit you out and you can go running. If you need to get out normally, just push that pinkie button and then the purple button again, to get out. Everybody got that?"" Mortimer asked.



The girls all shook their heads in agreement.



""Good. Now... THIS is what we're going to be using for the job."" Mortimer said as he moved over to the bench and opened a gun case. ""This... is the Barrett M20A2 55mm bolt rifle, the Smith And Wesson 'Patriot' 30 mm revolver, and the Kalashnikov KA-408 AK-DMR platform rifle. You will be using these, to earn your certifications.""



The girls looked a bit scared at the sight of these massive guns, clearly not built for any human without mechanised assistance. They had gone through basic firearms training and even been to a shooting competition before, but never used anything quite like these monsters.



""Imposing, aren't they? But you know I want to make this a bit more... Interesting."" Mortimer said, rubbing his hands together in an evil fashion.



""Morty... Don't do anything I ain't allowed to do..."" Andrew said from his seat.



""Don't worry bruh, its all above board! I have a fun idea! After your courses are complete, we will have a little contest! Winner of the contest... gets to use the BIG gun on the BIG mech. How's that sound?"" Mortimer said.



The girls were taken by surprise by this suggestion and glanced at each other in surprise. They all jumped squealing 'Me first!' as they crowded around. Mortimer decided to go with alphabetical order, starting with a dark elven girl named Amari. Each girl had to tie her hair down and secure it properly before she could enter, and one by one, they got into the suit, faffed about a bit to get used to how the controls worked and stood up to the firing range. The exercise was less about firing the gun and more about the safety, control and discipline needed to use the weapon, as well as basic mech controls and operation. Amari stepped up to the firing range and was made to fire a full volley from each gun. Mortimer stood next to her and gestured at the intended target - a bank of sandbags on a hill.



""Right. So far so good. Now, five round mag for the Barrett. Ten round mag for the Kalash. Three rounds in the cylinder for the revolver. Fire it all. Following safety protocol of course. Extra points for actually hitting the target."" Mortimer said.



""Yes sir. Uh... Like this. Okay uhh… Check sights. Magazine loaded. Ready to fire. Check the perimeter... Safety off!"" She yelled the last part and readied herself to fire.



The bulky machine was a bit unwieldy for the elf girl and it took her a bit to get used to it. She fired off one shot, the blast echoing through the valley and a puff of dust appearing in front of the muzzle. The bullet streaked through the air and blasted into the side of the mountain, five or six feet from its intended target.



""Gently now. Take it easy. Panic is dangerous when holding a gun. Remember: Discipline."" Andrew said as he got back on his feet and stood next to her.



Amari put the safety on and took a breath, limbering herself up. She readied herself again and fired another shot. This time, hitting close, just behind the target slightly to the left.



""You don't have to compensate for the recoil like a normal gun, the machine does it for you even though it's a higher caliber. Loosen your arms up, don't twist your wrist to absorb the recoil. Don't forget to check your grip."" Andrew said.



""Yes sir. It's a bit weird how this thing works..."" Amari said.



""I know. It takes some getting used to but it looks like you have your range. Try again."" Mortimer said.



Amari readied herself again and fired a shot. This time, hitting her target and releasing a puff of dust from the sandbag target. Her friends were unable to celebrate as she quickly released two more shots, both of which hit their target. Amari ejected the spent magazine and stood to attention, rifle down at her side.



""Good! Perfect discipline, perfect safety technique. Good shots too, three out of five, not bad for a newbie. Now, the revolver. Three rounds."" Mortimer said.



Amari nodded in response and put the rifle down, picking up the revolver. She loaded it, carefully and checked her perimeter to make sure it's clear. She held the revolver with bth hands, then cocked it ready to fire. SHe genuinely didn't think the gun had THAT much recoil so it took her by surprise when it tried to kick itself out of her hands. She regained her composure and tried a different stance, using the machine's weight on the gun's handle to absorb the recoil. She fired two more shots, one of which hit the target. She ejected the spent casings and put the gun on the table.



""Very good. Got a bit iffy there at that first one but you handled it well. Do NOT be afraid to change stances if you need to. Next, the DMR."" Andrew said.



She picked up the rather vicious looking weapon and prepared herself to fire it. Mortimer directed her to lay down and use the bipod on the gun. ""Okay... Don't have to hit any targets, this ones about control. Fire it full-auto, and we'll see how you handle it."" Mortimer said.



Amari nodded and lay down, using the concrete platform they're standing on to stabilize herself. She readied herself, checked her quarters and made sure it was safe, then unleashed. Two seconds later, the mag was expended and she was gasping for breath from the shock. She stood up, put the gun down then let herself shiver a bit as she came down from the adrenaline high.



""Very good! Amari made a good baseline. Let's see who can do better. The one who gets the most hits, wins and gets to play with the big mech. So far the score is 3-1-1. Let's do better!"" Mortimer said.



The rest of the class all took their turn, with the shocking outcome of the Sprite Elf Kahlia coming out on top, with a score of 4-3-6. Kahlia was more than just a little intimidated at the sight of the gigantic beast as Mortimer lowered the access ladder to the cockpit. Andrew went up with her to act as supervisor as Mortimer put her in the gunners seat.



""Holy crap this is fancy..."" She squeaked as she put her seatbelt on.



""It is, isn't it? Military versions are a LOT more complex than this one. This one is a civilian grade variant for sporting contests. Military versions are also a lot more heavily armed than Binky here."" Mortimer said.



Andrew and Kahlia both looked at him with a crooked brow. ""Binky?""



""Yeah. That's his name. So, let me get into a good spot and you can see what he does."" Mortimer replied.



The machine reared up to full height, moving around exactly like a dog as its enormous steel feet slammed into the sand and Mortimer expertly moved it into position in front of the firing target. Mortimer then showed Khalia how to aim. the entire head of the machine moved as it did, just like the head of a dog.



""We had an idea for something like this back in the late 1980s, from a movie series called Star Wars. It was called the AT-AT, All-Terrain Armoured Transport. Damn beautiful beast, good concept but the movie version was too big, fat and clunky to be of any real use in combat. So we instead took inspiration from DARPA and Cambridge robotics programs. Same principal, different deployment. The entire head acts as a turret, because of the whole design of the doggo, it's very articulate."" Mortimer said as he demonstrated its operation.



""Okay wait... if this thing is so good why do you use tanks and planes and stuff like from back in the 20th century? If you got these, why do you still have tanks in service?"" she asked.



""Simple kitten, a standard Army MBT costs around 1.2 million dollars to build and maintain with a combat life of thirty to fifty years in service. This magnificent beast has a price tag of thirty million dollars and a service life of maybe twenty years."" Andrew replied with a smirk.



The number made her jaw drop and she nearly choked on her own shock.



""Uh huh. Yes. Specialised equipment like this is made for special operations or as a support vessel for less expensive, more numerous military operations. We don't deploy a hundred of these things on the frontline. In any case. Here's what he's packin'. A two-forty millimetre cannon, a twin linked plasma bolter and one eight barrel minigun. I'll let you spend a full mag on each, and ten seconds on the minigun. Because ammo is pricey for this thing. Can't let you have too much fun can we?"" Mortimer said and readied the machine to firing position.



""O-okay... Uh... So... If I can see this right. Hold the joystick with your right hand to aim. Press buttons on the trigger to fire. Use that... heads up display screen thing to look what I'm shooting at. Right?""



The two men nodded in approval and Mortimer made sure to have his own hand on a secondary targeting system to make sure she didn't do anything silly or crazy. Kahlia fiddled with it to see if she could figure it out and eventually got used to the motion of the head. She lined up the targeting reticule on the sandbag target they'd been shooting at.



""Okay... I'm assuming no matter how big the gun, the procedures are the same. Ready to fire. Check the perimeter... Clear area. SAFETY OFF!"" She yelled the last words and gently squeezed the trigger.



The main cannon fired a high explosive shell, the ground shuddering from the explosion. the whole body of the machine wrenched back to absorb the recoil. The shell screamed through the air and hit just to the left of the target, blowing a huge crater into the side of the hill and displacing some of the sandbags. Kahlia was allowed to fire two more shells, completely obliterating the target into piles of shredded material and dust plumes.



""That was AWESOME!"" She growled excitedly.



They held her back and calmed her down before the next one. He took some breaths and collected herself, then moved to the plasma bolters. Lacking any target owing to her previous attack, decided to fire into the crater she left behind to make a bigger hole. The blasters sounded EXACTLY like the AT-ATs blasters, but left their impact points as blazing piles of molten glassy goop. She fired a few volleys of blaster bolts, turning the hillside into a strange mass of swirling semi-molten glass. Once again her instructors had to calm her down before she went for the gatling gun. She aimed at her target - the molten glass goop - and produced three bursts of fire, three solid beams of molten metal bullets at five seconds each, that turned the molten goop into a strange form of semi-hardened art.



Kahlia could barely contain her excitement at how much fun it was and her teacher Andrew decided to cut the rest of the fun off before she ended up getting too excited and getting either herself or someone else hurt. Each girl earned her certification, plus some extra credit to boast about at school.",8,1739183919.0,HFY,4,1.0,False

All that I can remember is:

1. She is caucasian. 
2. She had a 50s look about her. Rolled hair. Often red dye. 
3. She had a beautiful smile with lipstick with big clean teeth. 
4. The videos i remember of hers are:

~ Soundscape - one was a blue and green thumbnail and was short; 5-6 mins. 
~ Minecraft playthrough
~ Java Script Coding
~ Matches she struck and blew out in front of the microphone. 
~ Tapping on a notebook of some sort. 
~ she mentions in one video she got a special coffee drink ‘white mocha’ once a year as a treat.

I dont think she’s active and maybe has deleted her channel. But i just remembered that she was among the first channels i ever watched. As i said 2010s to up until at least 2016-ish i watched her. Could have been active before that.

I’ve been fighting for social justice since before you were born—literally, I attended my first anti-gentrification rally in 1983 (we successfully blocked a neighborhood coffee shop from opening, you’re welcome). And now I see you all yammering on this subreddit about “zoning reform,” “affordable housing,” and other neoliberal nonsense that completely misses the point.

Do you even understand that true progressivism is about keeping communities intact? My neighborhood has been a bastion of working-class culture since my parents bought our home in 1974 for a totally reasonable $38,000. And now YOU want to bulldoze history just to build a disgusting “fourplex” so baristas can have somewhere to live? Absolutely not.

I’ve dedicated my career as a Senior Community Visioning and Authentic Progress Liaison (Zoning Department) to ensuring that my city remains a diverse, vibrant, and car-free utopia. That’s why we must protect our beloved single-family zoning. The moment you introduce “upzoning,” developers swoop in and—BAM!—suddenly, we’re Manhattan. You kids claim to care about marginalized communities, but how does cramming people into high-density housing help anyone? Have you considered their mental health? Their access to artisanal open-air bread markets? Their right to a picturesque tree-lined street, preferably one that I fought to have designated a historic landmark so it can never be changed?

And don’t even get me started on parking. Some of us have electric vehicles that need street space, but no—your generation thinks buses are the answer. I rode a bus once in 1997. It was awful. We need sensible transit solutions like the light rail proposal I’ve been championing since 2005 (which is still in the planning stage but will revolutionize transportation any decade now).

Honestly, I just don’t understand why you kids refuse to listen to the people who know best: progressive, long-term homeowners who have been protecting this city’s character since before you were even born. You’re playing checkers while we’re playing generational property monopoly.

Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to attend a city council meeting to fight against a new apartment complex that would cast a mild shadow on the dog-friendly wine bar I frequent. Stay woke, but the right way.",57,1739183759.0,urbanplanning,18,0.75,False

 “Magista Trixon. You are accused of treason of the highest order. How do you plead.” the first Judge declared.

 “Not guilty. In order to prevent our complete and utter destruction, I did what had to be done.” Trixon stated. “At the time, we had no other options. The hordes of the invading coalition were unstoppable, you all know that. If I hadn’t done what I had done, none of us would be here right now. No magic or technology or ancient device could have saved us.”

Murmurs were heard throughout the great hall as the thousands of members in the Jury either quietly conversed with their neighbours about their agreement or disagreements to Trixon’s statement.

 “While it is undisputed that we could not have won the war without the Humans, giving them the Ix-drive was…” the second judge began.

 “…absolutely necessary.” Trixon interrupted him. “For the sake of all individualistic sentient life in the Galaxy, it was absolutely necessary.”

Ix-drive. It was probably THE most important invention for the galaxy, comparable importance to the invention of the wheel, the printing press or Beer for humanity, depending on whom you ask.

A device that combined both magical ether reactors, technical aspects beyond what anyone can comprehend and a mind probing device, it allows the user to physically create any object of any size, as long as they understand every single aspect of the object, from the physical appearance to the programming and other technical aspects. Using a human example, if one has a clear picture of an object, say a mobile phone, you can create the phone.  
However, it will not have any functionality. It will just be the phone.  
If however, you knew how it operated, what components there were, etc., then you could theoretically create a working mobile phone.  
Thus, theoretically, it would be possible to create literally anything, as long as the knowledge of every single functionality of the object is known.

In the thousands of years since its inception, the Ix-drive has undergone sporadic improvements, primarily to its adaptability for use by different species.

Trixon allowed himself a small smile as he heard the muttered discussions whispering through the hall.

 “Then, Magista, kindly explain what in the name of all that is holy is going on right outside of our viewport!” the first Judge roared in undiluted fury, indicating the massive space battle going on right outside their space station.

…And the Humans…the first thing they did with the Ix-drive they were given, was for some lazy scholar in the field of Bio-Technology and Cybernetics to create a device that interfaces with the Human brain and allows for the uploading and downloading of information directly into the Human’s memory, immediately after creating a device that automatically cooks him some drink known as Coffee without having to ask for it.

Next, the same individual somehow got his hands on the schematics of the Ix-drive, mass produced both them and his, as he called it, Cyber-Interface, for Humanity.

The results were equally amusing as they were worrying.

You see, the current generation of Humans harkened back to their ancient days, back when they could only dream of space flight, and took inspiration from the ‘scifi’ spacecraft they envisioned back then to combat the swarm that threatened the Galaxy.

And with the help of state-of-the-art AI, they managed to recreate each and every one of those space faring vessels.

Within a year of receiving the Ix-drive, humanity launched its first fleet to engage the invaders in active combat.

The first fleet of many.

The first, to be officially labelled as a Bullshit fleet.

After all, who in their right mind would combine the Mk 1 Death Star from Star Wars with the Mothership from Independence day, supported by Imperial battleships from the Warhammer 40k+ universe, Daedalus-class battlecruisers from Stargate and Enterprise-class ships from Star Trek, just to name a few? Not to mention the plethora of smaller ships that accompanied them.

And all this just being the first fleet to be launched.

Each subsequent fleet was more outlandish, with the only factions from Warhammer not being implemented being the Orks, because not even the latest AI could make those Roks function, and the Tyrranids, for obvious reasons…and the Dark Eldar because they were apparently too twisted to work.

Heck, there was even an entire fleet of stealth frigates, comprising of over 50 SSV Normandy I’s and II’s…

Anyway, it did not take long for the invading coalition to be thrown back and the majority of lost space to be retaken.

And then the humans, as they say, did what they did best, and turn their fleets into Quantum VR controlled entities and began fighting each other as though it was the latest edition of the Battlefield: Space Edition genre.

Trixon turned to look before giving an answer.

 “That is just Humans turning their fighting prowess inwards instead of targeting us. Would you rather they fight us instead?” he asked, as they saw a Deathstar obliterate another Deathstar with its super laser, whilst a Independence day mothership destroyed a squadron of battlecruisers that were trying to ram it. “Let them have their fun. It’s quite a spectacle, isn’t it?”

 “Has the insanity of Humanity gone and rotted your brains?” the first judge asked.

 “Better insane than stupid. I am more surprised that none of you see the value in having them as friends. I mean, they are willing to put up a show for you, and…oh come on, Black Team. Don’t lose to the Reds.” Trixon suddenly shouted out as the flank of the one side began buckling.

 “Can we concentrate on what is going on, please.” The head Judge shouted, striking his gavel.

 “I am concentrating. I just have higher Priorities right now.” Trixon said, lifting the stein to his lips. “Such as drinking this free beer, and watching a casual game played by human teenagers.”",59,1739183491.0,HFY,8,0.99,False

Will I regret my decision? 

Or will it be the best thing I ever do? 


For reference I am 18 years old. Currently I am a full time student, at a local community college, applying for jobs to make some money, I live at home with my family in my parents house, my best friend since forever lives a state away and if I’m being honest outside of my family boyfriend and best friend I truly don’t have many/any hometown friends or even acquaintances. 

As a child I always struggled to make friends at school/home, I was bullied and “weird”, but I was blessed with the opportunity to travel from a young age and each time we were far away from “home” I would make a large group of friends and meaningful connections some that I still talk to others I haven’t even thought about in years. 

From a young age the goal was College. Marriage. Career. House. Dog. Kids. 
That was the life I dreamed of. 
Don’t get me wrong I still dream of being a mother one day. And I whole heartedly want to be a wife one day. 

For the most part I am satisfied with my life. My days are chill. Coffee runs with my sister and our family dog excite me. I look forward to date nights with my boyfriend. But am I really happy? Honestly fully honestly I don’t know/maybe I don’t think so. 

I love discussing the future with my boyfriend. And I am so deeply in love with this man. He is everything I’ve ever prayed for: big heart, masculine, he provides for me, he is my rock, he loves me, he respects me, he values me. I know I am young and people change but I am truly happy in my relationship. It’s not my first nor his unfortunately I’ve been in many young relationships (don’t recommend/not flexing this fact). 

My boyfriend (18M) of almost 2 years and I (18F) often talk about how we are saving up to get married soon [ASAP] and live with each other after marriage [within the next 2 years?]. We discuss wanting to have kids on the younger side but nothing crazy [no kids before 25? If we can get our preference] so we can be established. But we do talk about marriage, careers, a house, a dog doing all that as soon as possible. 

I’d be lying if I said I didn’t desire this life to an extent. On a normal day to day basis this is my plan and what I think about. 

But again I have this itch. An itch to run, sell my car for some extra cash on top of what I have now, buy a one way plane ticket to a small town live there for a while then change it up and fly to another small town of some sort in & out of the U.S. picking up odd jobs to make some cash along the way. This is my dream way of traveling. I want to live like a local understand the town, the culture, build deep connections. 

Which sounds amazing so ideal. But there is an issue actually a few major issues. 
1. My parents will only help me pay for 4 years of college starting from when I graduate so I only have until 2028 to get my degree before I have to pay for it 
2. My boyfriend and I don’t agree on this one thing. From the start of talking about our future geographically he has always stood pretty darn firm on never wanting to leave the state we currently live in (his family is here, he lives his job, his friends are here, he just can’t picture life anywhere else, etc.) I however honestly was fully set on 100% leaving for good for the longest time but just before we started dating I realised how much one day I’d miss the state I was born & raised in. So i was okay with agreeing to settle down & raise a family & retire in the state we have called home our whole life, but right now in my late teens and early twenties I want to explore. I want to live in all different parts of the U.S. & explore other countries/cultures all around the world. Whenever i mention travel he says we will travel eventually “when we have the money” “a couple-few times a year when we can get work off”. Which is great eventually once we’ve settled down, had kids, etc. BUT right now I technically have no legal marriage, no kids, no job weighing me down. If I really wanted to I could travel-full-time everywhere and no where can be my home. I am terrified of loosing this man though. But is he worth loosing an amazing opportunity? I don’t know. We have tried the long distance thing and our relationship GREATLY struggled, we both don’t really love the idea of taking a break we’d rather just push through or break up with someone rather than be in that weird position that we’ve both been in before with different people and just didn’t like. So it almost feels like I loose the love of my life or I loose the time of my life. And depending on the moment of the day sometimes one outweighs the other and other times the other outweighs the one in importance. 
3. My car will sell for some money, but not a ton I’m not sure how long it’ll last me
4. I wouldn’t have much no home-base necessarily id be hopping from town to town state to state country to country for about a year or so straight 
5.People are likely going to think this is some crazy plan that will fail. 

I truly need advice!!! If I were to do this I’d probably do this in about 4-6 months from now!! And I’d travel for a year. Then I’d plan to come home, finish my education, get a job, etc etc. 
 But for sure a full year… at least. 

I do wonder if my boyfriend and I could agree on 1 year of letting me go but I also would never want to put him in the terrible position of waiting on me. Or feeling like he can’t explore life himself because he’s waiting on me. 

I am honestly too scared to really talk about it though. Every time it’s brought up we argue. And the same thing is brought up we don’t do well as a long distance couple. So it’s hard to talk about because he doesn’t like long distance or loosing me and I don’t like loosing him. Sooo.

Does anyone have a rec for a cafe near old town with outdoor seating where it would be appropriate to set up and do work on a laptop? Outdoor, because I want to both work and smoke cigs.

Does anywhere exist where I could do this and also not be annoying the staff. I'm down to buy coffee and pastries regularly to ""rent"" my chair.

His results, the SIZE of his results, the SPEED of his results… COMPLETELY changed my view of what’s possible.

When Rob came to me he was in a 9-5 as a Sales Director.

His salary was modest. Doing okay but like most, wanted a bit of extra income.

In his mind? £10k per month would be enough.

In January he came across a few of my posts, learned a bit more about our Android system and thought it might be his ticket to £10k.

Being in the sales industry, he knew some folks he thought might be interested. So he ran the idea by them. One immediately said he’d wanna trial it out!

Win #1.

Straight after that, he bit the bullet and joined ROYA.

Still a little apprehensive because in his words “I had little to no experience in the tech stuff”

In his first week inside ROYA he continued aggressively going after coffee dates. The result? 3 partners committed.

Better yet, the numbers they were throwing around would put his fees MUCH higher than 10k/mo.

Win #2.

Rob keeps going. By now he’s gaining so much momentum with interested parties that by the end of January, he decides to go all in and quit his 9-5!

Win #3 – only 4 weeks in.

He continues his streak of coffee dates and building out Androids.

By first week of March he cleared £20k per month in PROFIT… just 5 weeks after quitting his 9-5.

That’s Win #4.

But it gets better. In his March update, Rob projected hitting £100k/mo!

Did he do it?

[Rob](https://preview.redd.it/6li0282weaie1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b2a65dc6fa318510b82fd0a0b7f75b1cf034cfc)

Well, just a couple weeks ago Rob shares in our group that he has been invoicing ONE partner £80k per WEEK…

…and that’s about to rise to £200k PER WEEK.

ONE PARTNER.

And he has an entire roster booked up that he can’t handle anymore work.

He started from scratch early January 2024 and by April 2024 is on track to smash sales records of companies that have been around for YEARS.

Better yet, because Rob’s mostly a one-man band… almost all of that is pure profit.

I don’t know what gets better than this?

I’m blown away myself.

There is NOTHING in the world that can generate these kind of results… for someone who has no experience doing any of this.

Remember... Rob is not a tech guy!​

All I did was give him the tools and point him in the right direction.

He’s the one who’s gone and put in the work to change his life.

I’m soo proud of him.

WITH THAT SAID…

Could this be you?

YES!

As long as you’re not afraid to get your hands dirty and be a bit resourceful?

I can give you everything Rob used and show you everything he did.

Even if you don’t go as “big” as Rob, would an extra $2k/week help?

Maybe $1k/week free and clear of a 9-5?

And while the money’s nice…

Once you have the SKILL to consistently land whale partners and create income streams out of thin air…

You will never have to work for anyone again. Your family’s future will be secure.
