If I'm trying to be the MOST fertile, hard, lose balls drop within a short time. Let's say a day. WANNA JUST IMPREGNATE. Similar to the tales of Genghis Khan, that idiot. 

So I've concluded I gotta test and dht max. Enuf estradiol as per Derek's reccomendation. 
I got black coffee, Tongkat Ali, ashwaghanda. 
What else should I throw in it. How should I structure my dose eg. How many hours before I impregnate.

1qtttnt,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1qtttnt/when_did_people_in_workplaces_get_so_much/,when did people in workplaces get so much authority,"i’m 21F recently started part-time work as a cleaner in a nursing home. i needed a job for college and that’s all there was. but jesus, ever since i started i’ve experienced nothing but rude co-workers. my supervisor left the day i joined, so they asked one of the employees to fill in (wasn’t ideal). he didn’t have any english and i had to decode everything he said. 

at first it was very subtle, getting me to do random jobs etc. but then he started getting me to do his jobs. see we have 2 cleaners on at a time, one does one job the other does their job. he started getting me to do half of his. i would question him but it was not interpreted. he would just go to the staff room and make a coffee. then, i was talking to a resident. this old man who was in the middle of talking to me. next thing, my employee completely interrupted him. said “get here” to me and nitpicked for 20 minutes about high dusting. it’s constant nitpicking like genuinely. i understand im new but holy god. he nitpicks on how i brush up after a few mops of the brush. he nitpicks about how i put cloth on a table. just micro managing. it’s a fucking cleaning job.

there’s also another employee. she is a bit more intense. the last day, i accidentally put half a load on in the washing machine. i was about to finish up my 33 hour in a row shift and i was tired. she started losing the plot and out of defence i lied. i know i shouldn’t have but i genuinely couldn’t cope with another situation. she kept threatening to get the big boss to check the cameras and “find what ever dim-witted and stupid person did this”. mind you, she definitely knew it was me. but i shrugged it off. she then told me about this specific table that we don’t put cloth on it. the lead nurse came in to me and said we need to put it on, and then my employee turns around and looks me straight in the face and says “you didn’t put the cloth on the table?”. bro, she literally was just after telling me to not do that. then she made me go out and watch the nurse put fucking cloth on a table. 

idk maybe i’m being sensitive, but why are people so full of ignorance and abuse the whole “oh she’s new” etc. ",3,1770035607.0,antiwork,0,1.0,False

Beyond the issue old model versus new model, so far I’ve understood I can expect a coffee with a mouthfeel similar to the one of standard moka pot coffee. That could be fine by me.

However, I haven’t understood whether the taste and finish length also remain similar, or if something changes.

Here are some details about my preferences, in case they might help: I’d like to consider the Brikka as an alternative for post-lunch espresso, which we usually make with an electric espresso machine. I don’t enjoy coffee from a standard moka after lunch; it doesn’t meet my expectations when I’m in the mood for espresso.

For breakfast, on the other hand, we make coffee with a 6-cup Bialetti Venus because at that time of day, I prefer that specific flavor. I’m not sure why exactly.",1,1770035607.0,mokapot,1,1.0,False

Too extreme?,"I'm tired of being the only one who actually shows up. Whether it's a 7 AM workout with the crew or Friday night dinner, there's always that one person (or three) who bail last minute and then everyone else follows.



So I'm building The Social Contract — a platform where EVERYONE in the group commits upfront by uploading a consequence. It could be:

\- A dare (buy everyone coffee, do a public TikTok dance)

\- A challenge (donate $20 to a charity you hate)

\- An embarrassing post (that stays locked unless you flake)



If everyone shows up → all stakes are deleted, nothing happens

If someone flakes → the GROUP votes on whether to release their consequence



The key: it's MUTUAL. Everyone has skin in the game from the start, so it's actually fair instead of feeling like a punishment.



I'm looking for 50 people to join the beta waitlist and tell me if this would actually work for your friend group or if I'm overthinking the ""flake problem.""

1qttnzp,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Karolina_Mindvalley/comments/1qttnzp/how_a_lack_of_confidence_can_spread_beyond_the/,How a lack of confidence can spread beyond the original mistake,"A lack of confidence comes up for pretty ordinary reasons. You spill coffee, miss something important, forget something basic, and by the end of the day it feels personal. Thoughts turn harsh, and self-worth starts getting questioned.

One pattern that stands out is how a lack of confidence doesn’t always stay tied to one situation. It can show up in appearance, in speaking up, or in ability. It can shift depending on circumstances.

No one feels confident all the time, but things change when doubt starts showing up at every turn. Decisions get second-guessed, action feels harder, and being comfortable in your own skin starts to feel out of reach.

Another part of this pattern is how confidence seems to get chipped away in ways that aren’t always obvious right away. Critical comments from family or friends don’t always sound serious. Sometimes they come off as jokes or casual remarks.

Even so, they can leave behind more doubt than confidence, especially when they happen repeatedly. The impact isn’t always immediate, and the damage can show up much later.

Self-criticism follows a similar path. There’s often an internal voice that jumps in after mistakes, calling decisions stupid or predicting failure.

That voice can be persistent and surprisingly loud. When criticism moves inside like that, it can start running the show and make insecurity feel constant rather than situational.

The overall effect of a chronic lack of confidence can be heavy. Excitement and capability fade, replaced by feeling weak or powerless. It doesn’t always feel clear where those feelings started, only that they’re there.

…Which leads to a harder thing to separate: How much of a lack of confidence feels tied to outside criticism versus the way that criticism turns inward?

But for the Extracurricular Activities, I didn't win any prestige or well known CS competition or hackathon.

I'm always passion in programming, I am the head of the programming club in our school, we made some small systems like service hour manage system and coffee ordering system for our school, participated in local science fair with a species detection app that uses an open-source model, and we are planning to host a local gamejam this year as well.

I'm really concerned about whether these Extracurricular is too weak, so I tried to convice my friends to join some competiton with me, but we only ended up wining a global economic related competiton where we created a web-based game to teach students economic knowledge.

I tried competative programming like CF, LeetCode and Atcoder, participated in USACO, but I just don't like it, I don't understand the concepts, I have no idea how to do their questions.

I'm not trying to apply for top 10 or 20 schools, the one I would like to go the most is UW-Madison.

1qttjfr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Celiac/comments/1qttjfr/living_in_spain_with_celiac_what_i_wish_i_had/,Living in Spain with Celiac What I Wish I Had Known,"Hi I have had celiac disease since I was 13 and I am now 29. I moved to Spain at the very end of September and it is now February and I am only just starting to feel normal again. I really wish I had read something like this before moving so I wanted to share and also hear how others are doing.

For context when I was first diagnosed my mom took me to the Celiac Disease Center at Columbia University in New York City. Because we did not live there full time I then spent years seeing various gastroenterologists closer to home and honestly felt like most of them knew very little about celiac beyond the basics. I often felt rushed out the door and not really listened to while dealing with a pretty overwhelming disease at a very young age.

Later when I lived in Los Angeles I went to the UCLA Center for Digestive Diseases and I cannot recommend it enough. They have an entire team dedicated just to celiac disease including specialists endocrinologists and even a celiac focused eating disorder therapist. It was by far the most comprehensive and validating care I have ever received.

In between all of that I ended up seeing an out of pocket holistic practitioner mostly because I wanted a doctor closer to me who would actually listen. Yes it was expensive and yes it was mostly supplements but I will say this. She took blood work seriously listened to me and prescribed supplements based on my labs. Call it placebo or not but just having someone slow down and explain things and giving my body something supportive genuinely helped.

Ironically I have gotten some of the clearest explanations from ChatGPT. Not trying to be a super fan but it was the first place that clearly explained the nervous system side of celiac. I never realized how constantly on alert my body was or how much gluten exposure affects anxiety and stress hormones. For me anxiety and brain fog are often the first signs I have been glutened and I can usually feel it within minutes not days. My nervous system reacts immediately.

I moved to Spain fully thinking it would be a gluten free oasis. I assumed that would mean restaurants could modify dishes to make something safe. I am not even a foodie. The food part is not the issue. It is the social part that becomes a buzzkill.

In some ways Spain is amazing for celiac and in others it has been much harder.

The grocery stores are the highlight. Gluten free labeling laws here are incredible. Truly incredible. The first time I walked into El Corte Inglés Supermercado I almost cried. I saw a raw kebab in the refrigerated section clearly labeled sin gluten. In the US I could never buy anything pre prepared like that without getting sick. Even plain rotisserie chicken was a no go for me because of cross contamination. Seeing that label felt unreal.

Mercadona gets a lot of love and I get why. It is affordable accessible and very clearly labeled. Personally it is not really my taste. I eat very simply and invest a lot in ingredients. I am the type of person who will spend way too much money on olive oil because I cook almost everything myself. So Mercadona is great for affordability and safety just not my personal favorite flavor wise.

Where I have struggled is eating and drinking out. Cross contamination feels unavoidable. In cafes and bars the same person often handles beer food money glasses and cocktails. Bread is everywhere. Coffee often comes with a cookie. Glasses are handled by the rim. I kept getting sick from wine vermouth and even coffee and could not figure out why.

In the US I rarely ate out but I could still safely have a coffee or a cocktail and be social. Here I eventually stopped consuming anything prepared outside a fully gluten free place. Once I did that I felt dramatically better but it has been socially isolating.

I am still glad I moved abroad and I would still encourage it. I just wish someone had told me this. Spain feels safer for groceries but harder for social eating and drinking if you are very sensitive.

I am currently in Valencia and would love to hear

Has anyone else had a similar experience in Spain

Are there cities you have found easier

How do you handle social situations here

Is it better in other European countries

1qtthrv,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1qtthrv/mf_for_music_lovers_tristan_isolde/,[MF] For music lovers: Tristan & Isolde,"He caressed the strings with a dusting of feeling, a colorless man in tailcoat and white bow tie. His pale face tense, ready to bring the music to life at any moment. Only his eyes betrayed something of his innermost self: pure verve. His gaze clung to one of the two chairs in front of the conductor’s podium, like the bitter aftertaste on his tongue from the coffee he had hastily gulped down backstage. For K., it was a last attempt to be fully with himself for the great moment.

From his seat in the last row, he surveyed the orchestra, not because of his position, but because of his height. Had he not been nearly two meters tall, he would have seen just as little as his stand partner. Only the scroll cut off part of his view. A dead angle that had long since become normal. A blind spot turned familiar reality. K. sat beside the tuba and the horns, his heavy instrument resting against the inside of his bent leg, nestling against his ear like a second head. Together they watched the final bustle. The hum of the audience dissolved beneath the uncoordinated sounds of the tuning orchestra: the shrill squeal of a violin, the dull rumble of the timpani, the deep, vibrating E of the cellos. K. answered with a guttural hum. From the auditorium rose a mix of competing perfumes and the smell of heavy fabrics and old upholstered seats. He reached into his jacket pocket, pulled out a cloth, and dabbed his forehead.

“Is this the moment when I should slowly start to worry?”

Restlessly, he wrapped himself around his instrument, pressed it closer, the wood in his arms, and whispered to its neck. His lips barely moved. “Don’t worry. She’ll come.”

The audience applauded. The soloists entered... but she was not among them.

“Pssst,” it hissed from the right. “Isn’t the new one hot?” His neighbor nudged him with the bow. “Hey, K.!”

The small, slightly younger man had been his stand partner since the new general music director took office. A circumstance that made K. doubt the man’s decisions, musically and personally.

“What a bombshell,” the little man panted. His oversized glasses sat crooked on his hooked nose. He adjusted them, squinted, and licked his lips. “The GMD swapped the lineup at the last minute. With that bust, I’m not surprised at all.”

K. had to admit that the redhead, in her off-the-shoulder dark blue evening gown, her updo and gold earrings, matching her hair color, looked stunning. The necklace, also gold, hanging into her cleavage, had not gone unnoticed by the little man beside him. Yet even if makeup and performance adhered to the dress code, K. did not recognize a lady in her.

“Disgusting,” he spat.

“What a lucky bastard,” his stand partner giggled. “I bet she lets him—”

Renewed applause drowned out the sentence. The general music director entered the stage, shook hands with the concertmaster, nodded to the soloists, and, with an overly sweeping gesture, prompted the orchestra to rise.

“He can hardly wait,” the little man snickered.

The next moments unfolded as usual: applause. Bows. More applause until the expected silence. A cough from the audience. The conductor raised his arms, demanded full attention. Another cough. Then silence. K.’s longed-for moment. The conductor’s deep inhale: the cue to the Prelude.

Wagner’s music flooded the hall, and K. wondered where his Isolde remained. For far too long he had yearned for her healing voice, which now seemed worlds away. All his intentions threatened to fail. It should have been time. Every preparation had been planned down to the smallest detail, almost obsessively.

Fixing his gaze on the copper-colored hair, he reshaped the figure inwardly into a delicate dark-haired woman. Not with a flawless body, but with the voice of a nymph. He had admired her, revered her, even worshipped her. He wanted to create her, to shape her into what she was: the new star in the firmament.

His Sarah.

Through him she would rise to greatness. Through him alone. He, her Tristan: the secret admirer, the creator from whom the musical seed flowed that would carry her upward, lift her onto a pedestal reserved only for chosen and true sopranos, separating her from brats like this Little Red Riding Hood. As his tool, he wielded the double bass, the counterpole. The deeper he descended into the abyss of the grotesque, the higher he lifted her, through the tension of high and low. A longing with redemption in death. In the end, every soprano had her creator.

K. sat motionless, the massive instrument between his knees, as the Tristan chord sounded. It was as if someone had thrown a stone into water and the ripples reached straight into his core. Trembling seized him, constriction, burning desire. The chord hovered in the air like an open wound. Hesitant, dragging, unbearably beautiful. It was not a sound that came and went, but one that remained. Like a breath held. A promise not fulfilled.

The double bass merged with him. The strings vibrated beneath his fingers, echoing his heartbeat. Damp hands slid over the varnish, fingers clenched around the neck. Cold crept up from the soles of his shoes while the stage lights scorched him. The mix of frost and heat created a surreal atmosphere, tearing him between reality and rapture.

The notes before him blurred. They became meaningless. He fixed his gaze on the movements of the strings, gliding over one another like shadows. Their lines intertwined in unresolved tension. The conductor, baton raised, frozen in that moment of dissonance. Everything lost its contours.

Everything but his Sarah. Her sound remained.

Frenetically he swung his arm, stared at the soloist, scarcely felt how much he strained his instrument. Not even the scratching of his shirt collar bothered him. He drove his horsehair bow powerfully, almost brutally across the strings, squeezed and pressed his thick, calloused fingertips along the fingerboard. The sway of his upper body resembled a great, diseased tree in the midst of a storm, its unstable roots threatening to give way. Manically he tore the sound to himself, played over the conductor, who now desperately tried to regain control of the orchestra, but the otherworldly law took hold: the orchestra adapted to the double bass.

His playing tipped into violence. The music swelled, and Wagner’s work took on a dramatic timbre. The singer, visibly struggling to keep up, nearly screamed. Grotesque details leapt into K.’s eye: the violinist whose fingers clawed over the strings, or the horn player whose face contorted under the strain as if battling invisible demons. The measures pulsed, twisted, and the diffuse light of the chandeliers reflected in the polished bows and brass instruments of his colleagues. The music spiraled out of control. The orchestra groaned.

Suddenly, a crack sounded directly beneath his fingers.

Abruptly, the G string hung slack, unmotivated, without tension. The shock tore him from his trance. Reflexively, he compensated with the D string and continued playing in thumb position. He no longer felt his raw fingers. Nor did he register the strained posture. His back pain would come later. Mentally back in the here and now, his emotions lingered like a shadow. He played on mechanically, reluctantly.

His Sarah was gone.

Grinding his teeth, he fixed his gaze on the singer.

1qttel9,https://www.reddit.com/r/SofaSnobs/comments/1qttel9/when_did_nail_care_become_an_elaborate_ritual/,When did nail care become an elaborate ritual,"I sat near someone at a cafe who was getting a full treatment in a portable pedicure chair that 
the technician had wheeled in and set up right there in public. The whole setup was elaborate, 
involving water basins and multiple products and tools spread across a tray. She sat there for 
over an hour while other patrons worked around this impromptu salon taking up several tables. 
The technician mentioned traveling to clients with the portable chair setup to save them travel 
time to salons. She'd invested in the equipment through beauty supply distributors, including 
finding a lighter weight chair model on Alibaba specifically designed for mobile services. The 
convenience for clients comes at the cost of public space and other people's comfort. 
We've decided that convenience means bringing salon services everywhere regardless of 
appropriateness or impact on shared spaces. Her pedicure turned the cafe into her personal 
spa without considering that other people came there for coffee and quiet work. The chair and 
equipment enabled this colonization of public space. Maybe mobile services are innovative 
business models or maybe they're just entitled intrusion into places not meant for extended 
beauty treatments. Sometimes convenience for one person creates inconvenience for everyone 
else.",1,1770034371.0,SofaSnobs,0,1.0,False
1qttec3,https://www.reddit.com/r/LockedInMan/comments/1qttec3/i_was_a_nice_guy_for_10_years_and_it_destroyed_my/,"I was a ""nice guy"" for 10 years and it destroyed my dating life. Here's the painful truth no one tells you.","I remember the exact moment I realized being a ""nice guy"" had ruined my dating life.

It was at my friend Jake's wedding. I was sitting at the singles table again watching as the best man gave his speech. This guy was everything I wasn't: loud, sometimes inappropriate, and completely comfortable taking up space. I'd always considered him kind of a jerk.

""Before I met Sarah,"" Jake's best man said, gesturing to the bride, ""Jake was the guy who would give you his last dollar, drive you to the airport at 4 AM, and never ask for anything in return.""

I nodded to myself. That described me perfectly. I was the reliable one, the shoulder to cry on, the guy who was always there when you needed something.

""But he was also miserable in relationships until he learned one crucial lesson,"" the best man continued. ""Being kind is meaningless if you don't respect yourself first.""

Something clicked in that moment. I'd spent years believing that my niceness was a virtue that by being accommodating, agreeable, and putting everyone else's needs before my own, I was doing dating right. But looking around at my perpetually single life compared to Jake's obvious happiness, I had to confront an uncomfortable truth: my ""nice guy"" behavior wasn't actually nice at all. It was a covert contract with the world that wasn't paying off.

The next morning, I had coffee with Jake before he left for his honeymoon. Against my better judgment, I asked him what changed for him.

""I realized I was being nice because I was terrified of conflict,"" he said bluntly. ""I wasn't being kind I was being conflict-avoidant. There's a massive difference.""

He explained that he used to do the same things I did: agree with everything women said even when he didn't, never express his own needs, act as an emotional support system for women he was interested in without ever making a move. He'd been the quintessential ""nice guy.""

""The problem is, it's manipulative,"" he continued, seeing the confusion on my face. ""You're not being honest about what you want. You're doing favors and being agreeable hoping it will make someone love you. That's not how attraction works.""

I felt defensive at first. How was being kind manipulative? But as Jake spoke, I recognized myself in every example. The time I helped a woman I had a crush on move apartments, spending 12 hours lifting furniture while she told me about the guy she was actually interested in. The countless coffee ""dates"" where I listened to women's problems without ever expressing my romantic interest. The relationships where I'd become a doormat, saying yes to everything, then growing resentful when they lost respect for me.

I wasn't being nice. I was trading favors and agreeableness for affection that never came.

After that conversation, I spent months reflecting on how my ""nice guy"" behavior had shaped my interactions with women. I realized several painful truths:

1. I wasn't actually being authentic. I was suppressing my real opinions, needs, and desires to appear agreeable.
2. I wasn't giving women the opportunity to know the real me just a carefully constructed persona designed to avoid rejection.
3. Most importantly, I wasn't treating women as equals. I was putting them on pedestals, then feeling betrayed when they didn't reward my niceness with romance or sex.

The hardest part was accepting that my niceness wasn't about being a good person it was about fear. Fear of rejection, fear of conflict, fear of being seen as ""one of those guys"" who expresses desire directly.

My transformation didn't happen overnight. It started with small acts of authenticity: expressing a different opinion during a date instead of just agreeing, saying no when I didn't want to do something, being honest about my romantic interest early rather than pretending to be ""just a friend"" while secretly hoping for more.

The first time I respectfully disagreed with a woman I was dating about a political issue, I was terrified she'd be upset. Instead, it led to our most engaging conversation yet. She later told me she appreciated that I had my own views rather than just mirroring hers.

When I started setting boundaries around my time and energy not dropping everything whenever someone called, not being available 24/7 for emotional support without reciprocation I expected people to disappear from my life. Some did. But the relationships that remained grew stronger, built on mutual respect rather than one-sided servitude.

The most significant change came when I began expressing romantic interest directly rather than trying to ""nice"" my way into someone's heart. Yes, I faced more explicit rejection but I also experienced more authentic connection. Women responded to my honesty in a way they never had to my calculated niceness.

Six months after Jake's wedding, I met Alison at a friend's dinner party. When she mentioned loving a book I found pretentious, I politely said so rather than falsely agreeing. When she suggested meeting for coffee ""as friends"" after our second date, I gently explained that I was looking for a romantic relationship, not another friendship. When she asked for help moving a week later, I told her I'd rather take her to dinner instead.

Each time I expected my honesty to push her away, but it had the opposite effect. Our relationship developed based on mutual respect and authenticity something I'd never experienced in my ""nice guy"" days.

The irony of the ""nice guy"" approach is that it's anything but nice. Real kindness comes with boundaries, honesty, and self-respect. It means being generous without expectation, caring without manipulation, supportive without subservience.

I still consider myself a kind person. But I'm no longer a ""nice guy."" I've stopped using agreeableness as a strategy to avoid rejection. I've learned that authentic connection requires authentic behavior even when that means risking disapproval.

If you recognize yourself in my story, know that there's a path forward that doesn't require becoming a jerk. It simply requires becoming real. Women don't reject nice guys they reject inauthentic men who use niceness to hide their true selves and desires.

Been single for about two years after a serious relationship ended, and I'm honestly just tired of the loneliness. Figured it's time to put myself out there properly.
A bit about me:
6'1"", on the huskier side, SFW face pics on my profile if you want to see.
Big nerd—most of my free time is Xbox gaming (sandbox, strategy, RPGs, FPS mostly), watching movies/YouTube, or catching up on anime/manga (not as hardcore as high school me, but still enjoy it).
I do like going out when the weather cooperates (walks, coffee spots, maybe arcade/barcade hangs), but I'm homebody-ish during the brutal Chicago winters.
Work first shift most days, so I'm pretty free on weekends for dates or just chilling.
Currently working on getting my driver's license, so I rely on public transit/walking for now—happy to meet up wherever is convenient in the area.
What I'm looking for:
A girl around my age (18-25ish?) who's also into gaming or at least open to trying it—would love to play co-op or multiplayer sometime if we click. Hoping for something serious and long-term eventually, but let's start slow: get to know each other, chat a ton, maybe grab food/coffee, watch stuff together, and see where it goes. Patient, kind, and understanding vibes are a must—someone who gets that building something real takes time.
If any of this sounds like you and you're in Chicago/Chicagoland, feel free to DM me. Tell me a bit about yourself (what games/movies you're into, favorite genre, whatever) so I know you're real.

1. Neighborhoods: we are looking at Navia and Bouzas. Which one is better for a 10yo to have some indepndence (bike to the park, meet friends safely)?
2. Football: besides Celta, which clubs have the best environment for an 10yo (Alevín/Infantil level)? We’ve heard about Coruxo and Rapido de Bouzas.
3. Schools: are there any schools known for having a good sports program or being welcoming to ""extranjeros"" who are still learning Spanish?
4. The hills: Is it a total nightmare for a pre-teen to get around on a bike/scooter, or are the new ramps making it easier?

I opened up and shared a lot of personal things with a newer friend and then after hours of chatting she announced she new and had recently been hanging out with my ex. An ex I had just spoken about and she asked questions about. I'd appreciate peoples perspectives on this.,"A new friendand I met for coffee and chat this weekend. The first time just the two of us. It had bee group settings since I met her a little under a year ago. 
We have common interests and she seemed lovely and kind. She asked questions about me but it started to feel odd. The questions felt ready before I'd finished my previous sentence. I had no time to really pause or say no and reflect. So I feel awful that I shared more than I should have and wanted to. Thats on me to work on. 

What I need some perspective on, is she asked questions and at first it felt kind and like space to share. The conversation was focused on bad relationships but it was all mine. I started to feel odd. She wasn't ever sharing anything about herself and when I asked it felt vague and brief. She never gave reflections about her personal life. She just kept asking about me without any room to come up for air. After 5 odd hours of this and her inviting me to a group thing soon. I mentioned an old mutual friend that she already knew about and that I was nervous to hang out with. She then announced she had been dating him but now wasn't and asked for my thoughts. I asked if they were still talking and she said yes. That felt odd and selective. I haven't spoken to him in a very long time so explained that.

She then announced she had met my ex (that I had just opened up about wearing me down over years and she asked plenty of questions about) and been hanging out with him and this old mutual friend recently. 

That hurt. I felt played and tricked. I need some perspective. Is that normal behaviour? What wpuld you expect if this were you and a friend. When a friend has done the same to me, I pause them and tell them immediately so they can then decide how much they feel comfortable sharing. That feels decent and fair. 

Now I don't trust her with anything I just said and am afraid this old ghosts are going to resurface in my life.

Then I opened up the wall.

This is what I found behind the plaster and tile: a glorious spaghetti junction of copper and galvanized pipes that clearly pre-dates modern plumbing standards by several decades. It's a miracle it hasn't leaked yet. My 'simple' project instantly turned into a major re-pipe job just to fit the new fixtures, let alone make it look clean.

It's moments like these you realize designers often create layouts on paper without ever having to wrestle with the 'unseen' realities of an older house's guts. They probably assume everything is shiny new PEX or perfectly spaced copper runs.

Anyone else been through this? Any plumbers or DIY pros have tips for dealing with these kinds of older, packed-in systems when upgrading to high-quality Renovators Supply Manufacturing (or similar) fixtures?

During the past 8 months while I worked on my law school applications, I also worked as an essay editor for an American college counseling firm (fully remote position) as well as doing a part-time job at a local coffee shop. The college counseling firm paid me in cash. And the local coffee shop in my own country is just unlikely to be reached by an American third-party company that conducts background check and be offered as reference. So there is no W2 or paystub for me. My supervisor at the college counseling firm, however, would be able to verify that I worked there.

I just got a full-time legal internship offer from a nonprofit organization in Cali, which starts in February and will likely end before law school starts in August. I plan to leave all these essay editing and coffee shop jobs to do this internship.

My questions are:

1.	⁠If I list my essay editor role on my resume, will this be considered as a full-time job? Will it pass the background check by law firms?
2.	⁠If not, am I just unemployed for the past 8 months, and will that look bad on my resume? What's the best way to explain this 8-month gap? Do firms care about what you do between undergrad and law school?
3.	⁠Should I continue with this essay editor job, or should I accept the full-time internship offer? I think the internship interests me a lot more in terms of what I do, but I know a ""full-time job"" experience is viewed better than any internship/volunteer roles. It's just that the job I have is not the traditional kind of job that I'm super proud of, and I don't even know if they can pass the background check.
4.	⁠Can someone please explain to me how the background check is going to work? Will they request to see my W2, which I can't provide?",1,1770033088.0,prelaw,0,1.0,False
1qtsygi,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1qtsygi/sharing_because_i_never_thought_this_day_would/,Sharing because I never thought this day would come and I'm so so SO proud of myself 😫🥹,"When I'm not at work, I really do prefer my own company. I like having my own space, and being able to do things on my own schedule, and doing my own one-person hobbies, etc. However, I absolutely *cannot* relax if my space feels cluttered or messy. Unfortunately, as I'm sure we all know, this is a bit of a problem for an ADHDer!!! 

I therefore have spent what feels like every second of my adult life 'sorting' my life out. Every weekend off was spent catching up on errands, trying to get on top of housework, cleaning, tidying, organising, decluttering. Sometimes it was a pain in the ass if it was 'bad organising' (like replying to emails I'd put off for months and now had to Suffer the consequences of), but honestly... a lot of the time I kinda liked being able to sit down and lose track of time - reorganising my makeup drawer which I only did two months ago, rearranging all my wall pictures and then deciding I preferred them the way I had them before so moving them back, spending hours creating recipe spreadsheets that I would undoubtedly forget exist next week, etc, etc, etc. 

But when someone asks you ""how was your weekend, what did you get up to?"" it's kind of embarrassing admitting that you hyperfocused on your sock drawer and did the dishes finally. Internally I didn't mind it, and I do love my little life, but I've always been aware that there is *real* living I do actually *want* to do outside of my house (like beach days and hiking and coffee shops with friends, etc.), and as much as I enjoyed the 'sorting out my life' days, I couldn't reeeeally enjoy the fun stuff knowing I had a load of piled up chores and life admin tasks past their deadlines waiting for me at home. 

This *need* to have my space organised and tidy also held me back a lot in less enjoyable ways. For example, I hate cooking in a messy kitchen, because then there's too much STUFF around and I get overwhelmed and frustrated, but because I *had* so much stuff, I didn't have enough storage space to organise it all neatly and so even when everything was put away it still *felt* cluttered and messy. As a result, I never cook and my meals are last minute clearance ready meals, or random pantry snacks (chocolate brioche making up a major share of my diet). Not the *end* of the world, but certainly not where I want to be at 27. 

Basically, as much as I love alone time in my house tinkering away at my little odd jobs, I was very aware that it was holding me back from creating good habits (cooking, exercise, etc.) and fully enjoying other hobbies (can't go for a hike if I'm coming home to a pile of laundry!!! can't get **all** my crochet stuff out when it's messy because it'll just add to the mess and I'll be stressed!!). 

Well!!!!! After what feels like a lifetime of organising my life, **I am done!!!!** I accidentally forgot to take my annual leave until last minute so I ended up having to take it all in January. I therefore basically spent the whole month as a recluse, not having to answer to anyone or worry about when to wash my hair, or coordinate all my laundry piles so I have enough sets of uniforms to last the week, etc, etc, and could just lock myself in and chip away at the tasks. 

I didn't have to worry about wasting a whole Sunday melting down my old candles so I could get rid of 20 sooty candle jars. Those old charity shop lamps that were sat collecting dust? Spent 6 hours one evening rewiring them all (a new skill!) and now finally have lighting all over my house! I finally tacked down all the extension cords around my skirting boards so they're not loosely trailing across the ground. Every little task I had been collecting for YEARS but never got around to for one reason or another (like no time, or *some* time but not *enough* to do it to the level of detail I wanted, no money, no resources, etc) could finally get **done!!!** 

Yesterday I woke up with a genuine smile on my face as I realised I didn't have *anything* I *needed* to do, and instead I could do the things that would actually fulfil me. I can sit down and study for my PG exams without anxiously eyeing up the piled up dishes in the sink. I can do my little sewing projects without worrying about all the scraps of fabric adding to the mess because I finally organised my sewing station. I created flashcards for each of my plants that tells me what sort of lighting/humidity/watering they like so I can make sure they're in the best spot in the house and get the right conditions??!! All my pictures are framed and hung up rather than sat on the floor against the wall where I *think* I might put them??! 

I just feel so *free* and finally able to live now. Tidying the kitchen before I go to bed is so quick and easy now because things have their own place; putting away the dishes doesn't  stress me out anymore trying to cram bowls into the cupboard, but now makes me feel happy and relaxed because why does a 1 person household need EIGHT BOWLS??? 

I spent all day yesterday doing self-care stuff/??!?! I did a pre-shower hair oil and scalp massage, a body exfoliation treatment, a face mask, lifted and tinted my eyelashes, AND lit my freshly renewed candles (no longer the little stubs I had been hoarding which only burned for 30 seconds before the wicks gave up). I got into bed at the end of the day feeling like I'd actually... completed the day...... rather than thinking ""oh god so I didn't do X, Y, and Z so they have to roll over to tomorrow, which means tomorrow I now have X, Y, Z *AND* A, B, C"". 

It may have taken me 27 years to get here, but FUCK do I feel caught up with life finally. No idea how long this will last but I actually feel motivated to do things in a timely fashion, and actually schedule time for tasks rather than procrastinating them and letting them build up again and getting overwhelmed. 

Feeling so so so SO proud of myself right now lmao. ((((((:",2,1770033020.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

It even has two empty side pockets left over.

With this gear, a soda can, and an umbrella, I was able to start a fire, build a shelter, and enjoy a morale-boosting coffee. Since I couldn't cut large wood, I spent the night feeding the fire with medium-sized twigs to keep it going.

The two-person XL umbrella worked surprisingly well as a one-person tarp; it was a tight fit, but it kept me dry all night long.

1qtswuv,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1qtswuv/my_fully_remote_coworker_kept_his_camera_off_for/,My fully remote coworker kept his camera off for years. I wish he’d never turned it on.,"James and I both started working at Keystone Data Analytics in 2019, right before the pandemic. We were pretty good friends. Every Friday, we went out for drinks with a few of the other software engineers. But like most tech companies, Keystone went fully remote in 2020, and James and I lost touch.

James always kept his camera off in meetings. For four years, I didn’t see his face. Then one morning, he turned his camera on by mistake. What I saw was so horrible, I’ll never forget it.

“Does anyone have any blocks?” Aisha asked, during our morning standup.

“The time-series graphs don’t look right,” James said. “I think there’s something going on with the date logs.”

I was the one who’d written the logging code, so I told James I’d look into it.

Keystone developed data analytics platforms for government organizations. We’d recently signed a billion-dollar contract to build a new platform for a CIA research project. Everything about the project was very hush-hush. We were all forced to obtain security clearance. James was the only exception. He had all kinds of authorizations that the rest of us didn’t have. When the rest of us were forced to return to the office, he was the only one allowed to stay fully remote, too. When I asked him about it, he told me his uncle worked for the CIA, and he’d worked on a few other CIA-linked projects before that had required high-level security clearance. Keystone valued his expertise and wanted to keep him happy.

After looking through my code, I thought I’d found the problem. I fixed it and then messaged James on Teams and asked him to look at the time-series graphs again. He said they still didn’t look right.

“Can I call you?” I asked.

“Sure.”

I started a video chat, expecting, like usual, James to join with his camera off. Instead, though, his face filled my screen. He looked skeletal. His eyes were completely white, too. But even stranger than that, a tiny, deformed man with a hooked nose and beady black eyes sat on his shoulders, pulling his hair.

James’s screen went black.

“Thanks for looking into this, Cameron,” he said, as if nothing had happened. “The time series graphs are still all over the place. I’m looking at the data and the dates still don’t look right.”

I barely heard what he said. I was still in shock. Frozen.

“Are you okay?” he asked.

“Sorry. Can you repeat that?”

“The dates in the data don’t match the dates in the graph.”

I scanned my code again. I could barely focus, though. I kept thinking about what I’d just seen.

“I’ll have to get back to you later,” I said, and I ended the call.

I didn’t want to believe what I’d seen was real. I told myself I’d just imagined it, but I knew I hadn’t.

I walked over to our team leader Aisha’s cubicle. She sipped her tea and then looked over at me.

“What’s going on, Cameron?”

“I just got off a call with James. He didn’t look well.”

“You actually saw him?”

“I know this is going to sound strange, but there was someone else in the room with him.”

“And?”

“He was sitting on James’s shoulders, pulling on his hair. James looked like he hadn’t eaten for weeks, too.”

“You think he’s being abused?”

“I have no idea what’s going on, but I can’t stop thinking about what I saw.”

“Maybe we should go check on him after work.”

“That’s a great idea.”

\*\*\*

Aisha and I made plans to go to James’s apartment building together after work. We got there around six. I buzzed his apartment.

“Who is it?” he asked.

“Aisha and Cameron from work,” I said.

“What are you doing here?”

“We were in the neighborhood. We thought we’d see if you wanted to join us for drinks.”

“I’m busy.”

“I saw you on camera today. I saw that other person, too. Aisha and I just want to make sure you’re okay.”

“Sorry. That was my nephew. He was just playing around. I’m watching him while my sister is out of town.”

“If you could just come downstairs and talk to us for a minute,” Aisha said, “it would make us both feel a whole lot better.”

He hesitated but then agreed.

He looked even worse in person than he had on camera. Pale and thin, his neck covered with bruises.

“What happened to your neck?” Aisha asked him.

“My nephew loves to jump on my shoulders. He thinks it’s hilarious.”

“The person I saw on Teams really didn’t look like a kid, though,” I said.

“Could I use your phone for a second?” he asked.

“Sure.”

I unlocked my phone and gave it to him. He repeated, “don’t think,” while he quickly typed a short message and then gave the phone back to me.

“I need to get back upstairs,” he said.

He walked back to the elevator. When I turned around, I noticed the back of his neck was bleeding.

“What did he write?” Aisha asked me.

“Call my uncle. CHIMERA-3 is loose.”

We both felt uneasy, but we decided to go home after agreeing we’d try to track down his uncle’s number at work the next day.

\*\*\*

By the time I got back to my apartment, it was late. Close to nine pm. I hadn’t eaten dinner yet, and I was starving, so I ate some instant ramen quickly and then went right to bed. I couldn’t sleep, though. I just lay there, staring at the ceiling, thinking about James, wondering what was going on.

At midnight, my laptop blew up with hundreds of Teams and Slack message notifications.

Our platform must have crashed, I thought. The CIA is complaining, and Keystone wants all hands on deck.

I ran to my laptop and logged in, only to see that all the messages were from James.

“I need to talk to you,” he’d written, over and over.

I called him. His pale, skeletal face appeared on my laptop, his eyes completely white. That strange man sitting on his shoulders, riding him like a horse.

“You’re scaring me,” I said.

“You need to mind your own business,” The strange man mouthed the words and then James spoke them. “If you bother us again, you’ll regret it.”

He ended the call.

The next morning at work, I told Aisha what had happened.

“Should I tell HR?” she asked.

“Let’s try to get a hold of his uncle first.”

“I think he used his uncle as a reference on his job application. I should have his uncle’s number on file somewhere.”

Aisha found the number and gave it to me.

While we were talking, James sent her an email, saying he was going to miss the morning standup. He’d come down with the flu and was having trouble getting out of bed.

“Hopefully his uncle can help,” she said.

I called James’s uncle as soon as I got back to my cubicle. He didn’t answer, so I left a message.

“My name’s Cameron. I work with your nephew, James. He’s been acting very strange lately. I’m worried he might be in trouble. He asked me to call you. He said CHIMERA-3 is loose.”

I left him my number and then tried to catch up on work.

At five, I left work and took the subway home. A middle-aged man with a buzzcut stood on the steps to my apartment building.

“Cameron?” he asked.

“Are you James’s uncle?”

“Roger.” He shook my hand. “Let’s go talk somewhere a little quieter.”

We walked to the park across the street. Then we sat on a bench far away from the playground.

“You need to tell me everything you’ve seen,” he said.

“It was just a few seconds on a Teams call.”

I told him about the man on James’s shoulders. How James looked.

“How long has James been acting strangely?” he asked.

“I didn’t notice anything was wrong until yesterday.”

“I need you to come back to his apartment with me. You need to try to get him outside again.”

Roger had parked nearby. He took me to his car and then drove us to James’s apartment building.

I buzzed James’s apartment again.

“Who is it?” he asked.

“It’s Cameron.”

“What do you want?”

“You called in sick today. I wanted to make sure you’re all right.”

“I’m fine.”

One of James’s neighbors went into the building, Roger and I went through the front doors behind her. Then we took the elevator upstairs to James’s apartment.

“I’m going to wait back here,” Roger said. “Try to get him out of the apartment.”

I went and knocked on James’s door.

“What?” he asked.

“It’s Cameron. I just want to talk for a minute.”

“Leave me alone.”

“Why can’t you just tell me what’s going on?”

Suddenly, James’s door swung open. James grabbed my arm and pulled me inside.

For a second, that tiny, deformed man’s beady eyes pressed against mine.

Then a horrible ringing filled my ears. Pressure built inside my skull until my brain felt like it would explode.

The tiny man ran into the bedroom and then jumped through the window and ran down the fire escape.

“Get back here, Kevin!” Roger yelled.

He ran to the bedroom window but decided not to chase after him.

Roger came back to James. “How is he?”

“He doesn’t look good,” I said.

He knelt and checked James’s pulse.

His face turned pale.

“He’s dead.”

I stared at his body.

I’d never seen a dead body before. I felt strange to be looking at one. I wasn’t sure how to react. So, I just told Roger I was sorry.

\*\*\*

The police arrived. Roger explained what had happened. Then he offered to give me a ride home.

During the car ride, he explained what he could.

“Kevin is a weapon that escaped from us. He’s a parasitic empath. He has the ability to latch onto people, read through their minds and influence their behaviors. Who knows how long he was attached to James. To drain his mind like that, he must have been attached to him for years.” He shook his head. “The next few days, you need to be very careful. Kevin will be looking for a new host. If he had a chance to scan your mind in James’s apartment….” He trailed off.

I went up to my apartment, shut all the blinds, and turned off all the lights. I lay in bed and tried to get a bit of sleep, but I didn’t sleep at all.

The next morning at work, I went to Aisha’s cubicle, but I didn’t see her there. Right before our morning standup, our project director sent out an email saying Aisha was out sick and the standup was canceled.

I messaged Aisha on Teams.

“I hope you’re not too sick. Do you have any time to talk?”

She wrote back right away. “I’m still throwing up. If I feel better, though, I’ll call.”

I tried to get some work done. With everything that happened to James, I’d fallen pretty badly behind on things.

I worked right until seven. Then I clocked out and went back home, ate dinner and then sat in front of my TV, watching an NBA game.

Near the end of the first quarter, I started to feel strange. Sort of light-headed, but there was pressure inside my head, too.

I went to the bathroom, swallowed two Advils, and then decided to just go to bed.

The next morning, Aisha was back to run the morning standup, but she was working from home and kept her camera off the whole meeting.

After the meeting was over, I messaged her on Teams. “Do you have any time to talk?”

“Sorry, but I’m swamped with work. I need to catch up on some things.”

I’d tell her about James later. I didn’t really know how I was going to tell her James was dead, anyway.

The day dragged until, finally, I was able to go home.

I boiled some instant ramen, drained it, and put it in a big, glass bowl. I mixed in the flavor packet and watched as the powder dissolved into the broth.

Then my vision doubled. Something inside my skull pressed out against my eyes.

I blinked, and I was on the couch, the bowl of ramen half-empty

I stood up, disoriented, and checked the time. Thirty minutes had passed since I’d been in the kitchen.

My head was throbbing, so I went to the bathroom, and I swallowed two Advils just like I had the other night.

A voice whispered in my ears. “Come outside, Cameron.”

“What?”

I spun around the room, looking for who’d spoken to me, but nobody was there.

I heard the voice again, farther away.

I walked to the living room window and looked down at the park. Aisha stood in the light of one of the streetlamps. Kevin sat on her shoulders, waving at me.

I shut the blinds, ran to my bedroom, and hid in my closet. Then I got my phone and called Roger. He didn’t answer. I left a message.

“Kevin’s here! He’s outside my building.”

I held my phone in my shaking hands, trying to project my thoughts into Roger’s mind.

Call me, call me.

Finally, my phone lit up with a text message from him.

“Two minutes out. Stay calm.”

I tried to write back, but then my vision widened.

The carpet pulled upward into my eyes.

My eyes filled with white static.

When the static faded, I stood in the park, next to the empty playground. Above me, the stars shone in the night sky.

“It’s a beautiful night, isn’t it Cameron?” Aisha/Kevin said. “So calm. So peaceful.”

Aisha stepped towards me, her eyes completely white. Kevin held onto her braids with one hand while the fingers of his other hand were pressed inside her spine. I started to run, but my legs froze.

“You can try to run,” Aisha/Kevin said. “But you can’t get away from me.”

I couldn’t let myself end up like that.

I forced myself to keep running. But, like running in a nightmare, while my legs moved, I didn’t move forward.

I glanced back and saw Aisha/Kevin slowly walking towards me.

“Get on your knees,” they said. “I need to get on.”

I couldn’t control my body anymore. I knelt on the ground.

Kevin pulled his fingers out of Aisha’s neck and then jumped off her shoulders. She fell to the ground, unconscious.

“Now let’s get to know each other better,” Kevin said.

He walked around me and grabbed onto a handful of my hair. Right as he began climbing onto my shoulders, though, a horrible, screeching sound cut through my ears.

Kevin fell over, screaming in pain.

“Make it stop! Make it stop!”

Roger walked towards us, holding out some kind of auditory device. “You’ve been very bad, Kevin,” he said. “You’ve hurt a lot of people.”

“I don’t want to go back!”

Armed soldiers appeared around us, dressed in camo, their faces covered with black masks. As Kevin lay on the ground, twitching in pain, they cuffed him and then dragged him into the back of a van parked on the street.

Roger put his hand on my shoulder. “Are you ok?”

“You got here right in time.”

“I’ve been staying close to you. You’re a lot like James. I had the feeling CHIMERA-3 would like you.” He pointed at Aisha. “How long was your friend connected?”

“Two days, I think.”

“She should be fine. But we better get you both to the hospital.”

\*\*\*

Aisha and I were brought to a military base where the doctors there ran a series of tests on our brains.

The doctors said I seemed fine, though they weren’t quite sure about it. They assured me Aisha should be back to normal soon, too. They just wanted to keep her at the hospital a bit longer. But, again, they didn’t seem certain.

“I’m very sorry this happened to you,” Roger told me. “James had been helping develop some containment software, which put him in contact with the CHIMERAs. CHIMERA-3, in particular, took a liking to him, but we thought our security protocols were secure.” He hung his head. “They weren’t.”

Back at work, my coworkers had lots of questions about James and Aisha. The CIA managed the coverup. The story they had given Keystone was that James had left for another job in Florida and Aisha was away on sick leave. I went along with the story. I said I didn’t know anything that Keystone didn’t.

After leaving the hospital, for the next few days I had a pretty bad headache, but then my head started to feel better. The only problem was that, every now and then, time skips ahead again. I lose thirty minutes to an hour. During the gaps, I’ve done things I don’t remember doing.

It’s terrifying, but I hope the time gaps go away soon, too. If they don’t, I don’t know what I’ll do. But at least I’m not alone. At least I have Aisha to talk to about all of this.

We’re in this together.

She called me today to tell me she’s finally out of the hospital. She’s taking a bit of time off before going back to work, but she’s feeling a lot better, too. We’re supposed to meet for coffee tomorrow.

I just hope it was really her I talked to, and not just a voice in my head.

At first we'd try to let her sleep in our bed, but she wouldn't go back to sleep so we would just be awake from 1am until nap time later in the day. I've tried sleeping with her on the couch but it ends up as the same deal. I've tried feeding her but she's not hungry. Diaper change, read a book and rocking doesn't help either. She just wants to be a awake and with us. Obviously we can't do that. But the problem is that it you don't take her out of her crib she will scream at the top of her lungs, loudest thing I've ever heard. To the point where she's definitely hurting her vocal chords and throat. It's a scream thag I would only categorize as pure terror. I don't know how else to describe this kind of scream. After 3 sleepless nights with her because I didn't want her screaming like that, obviously, I just couldn't take it anymore. Tonight when she woke up at 2:30 after not going to sleep until 11pm, I rushed in there half asleep thinking that she lost her stuffy or something. She didn't. She just wanted to come to my bed. Which obviously I'm already established does not work. I left her room making sure she had everything she needs and went back to bed. I shut off the volume on the monitor, set an alarm on my phone for 1 hour, and covered my head with a pillow. After an hour she was still screaming. It only got worse when I went back in there to lay her down. I left her again for about 10 minutes to call my husband (already at work) he also didn't know what to do. I got her out of her crib and took her downstairs. Her voice obviously is raspy from screaming. I''m currently making coffee for myself while I type this and I decided that she does not get anything if she comes downstairs at this hour. No toys, definitely no TV. If she's hungry she can obviously eat but no playing of any kind. This time of day (currently 4 am) needs to be reserved for sleep and she needs to learn that.
What do I do? Am I doing it right? How do I fix this? We need to sleep again. ",1,1770032819.0,Parenting,6,1.0,False

---

Full transparency: I worked at Kast for a year and have used the card daily for close to 18 months. It's my primary card. I also have a referral code (20% off paid cards + 200 points after your first $100 spend). You should know my background before reading further.

## Why I'm posting this despite my obvious bias

I joined Kast because I was already using the product and saw what it solved. I left on good terms. It's still my daily driver 18 months in. Make of that what you will.

The key point: you don't need to touch crypto. Kast runs on stablecoin rails, but for practical purposes it functions like a USD multi-currency account with a Visa card attached.

## What it actually is

- Visa card (works anywhere Visa works)
- Virtual USD bank account with ACH and SWIFT in/out
- Apple Pay and Google Pay
- Instant digital card issuance (literally minutes after KYC)
- Works in 160+ countries

## Why expats care

- **US bank account number** - Third parties can deposit via ACH/Fedwire. Salary payments, exchange withdrawals, client payments. No US citizenship required.
- **Bank wire in and out** - SWIFT (USD, $1k minimum in), SEPA (EUR), PIX (Brazil), and payouts to local banks in 30+ currencies including SGD, THB, PHP, IDR, MYR, GBP, EUR, INR, AED
- **0% conversion on USD spend** - No spread, no markup. 2% FX fee on non-USD transactions (competitive with Wise/Revolut)
- **Up to 8% back on spending** - Paid in points, convertible to their token at TGE (Q2 2026). Risk: token doesn't exist yet. Worst case you have a functional card with good rates.
- **Unlimited transaction limits** - No daily caps for rent and large purchases
- **Instant card** - KYC to Apple Pay in minutes, not days. No waiting for physical plastic.

## The honest downsides (I saw these from the inside)

- ATM withdrawals are expensive ($3 + 2% domestic, add 2% FX internationally). Use it as a card, not for cash.
- Cashback is in points/future tokens, not instant dollars
- Custodial - you trust Kast with funds, no deposit insurance
- Physical card shipping takes time depending on location
- 2% FX on non-USD spend adds up outside dollarized economies
- Still a startup, not a 150-year-old bank

## Who this is for

- Expats struggling to get USD accounts
- Remote workers receiving USD who want to spend globally
- Anyone tired of Wise fees on international transfers
- People in countries with weak local banking
- Those already holding stablecoins (optional - bank wire funding works fine)

## Who this is NOT for

- People who need cash frequently
- Anyone uncomfortable with newer fintech
- Crypto skeptics who want nothing touching that ecosystem
- People needing a regulated bank account for mortgage applications

## My experience

18 months as my daily driver across Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, and the UK. Works everywhere Visa works. I pay for everything from coffee to flights with it. Support responds fast via WhatsApp/Telegram. Only declined once at a dodgy POS in Vietnam that also rejected my Wise card.

The USD account accepting third-party deposits is the killer feature Wise/Revolut don't offer in most jurisdictions.

1qtspw3,https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1qtspw3/the_upsides_of_my_150k_loss/,The upsides of my 150k loss,"I started writing this as a comment a few hours ago. It turned out way longer than expected, so I asked ChatGPT to help shorten it. I’m not fully sure I’m happy with the result, but after that long process I’m exhausted, so I’ll keep it as a proper post in case it benefits someone.

Objectively, I’m in a worse position than you if I don’t start acting on my plans. From the outside, and especially before losing my savings, I had everything most people would ever want. I have a good heart, the right knowledge, a lot of creativity and ideas, the best woman I could imagine, and financially I’ve had far more than I ever needed or even wanted.

Especially because of the money, I stayed stuck in my comfort zone. I created a cycle where I drained my dopamine all day by distracting myself with whatever was fun or stimulating. Over time, nothing felt exciting anymore. Eventually, there was nothing left that created any real feeling besides gambling. Most often this happened at night, after my fiancé was asleep, when I was alone and already emotionally and mentally depleted.

Recently it escalated. I started playing different games than usual, with bets that were far too high. Over a relatively short period of time, my savings of around 150k were drained almost completely. Now I’m at financial rock bottom, still facing bills, but with no clear way to cover them.

This is reality, and I’ll figure it out somehow. What I have that many people don’t is a real purpose, a will to change things in this world, and very concrete ideas and plans on how to do that. When someone has money but no purpose, money becomes something to waste on entertainment. If money has no direction, it might as well be burned.

Making money purely for the sake of money is like turning life into a shallow game, giving meaning to the wrong thing for distraction and stimulation, because we’re taught that money is what matters. 

Many people who chase fame and wealth eventually get rich and die empty, or cope in other ways.

There are countless examples of extremely wealthy, elite level people who, after having unlimited money, felt even more empty and ended up gambling everything away, not because they needed money, but because they needed feeling and meaning. What they lacked wasn’t intelligence or resources, but guidance, purpose, and real friendship in the form of brotherhood.

The entire game of money and getting rich is largely a distraction. Money amplifies whatever is already inside someone. It can amplify ego and corruption just as easily as it can amplify creation. Money makes the evil stronger, love and a good heart make the good stronger.

What gives life true meaning is creation. We are creators by nature. I’ve come to understand that life itself is designed around opposition. Positive experiences only exist because of their opposite. We often enjoy darker or more intense stories more than purely positive ones, and life works the same way.

I’m genuinely thankful for my attachment to money, because it made the gambling highs and lows real enough for me to experience both extremes, and eventually to hit rock bottom. The experience itself is worth more than the money I lost.

At the same time, I still live in reality. Money plays a role. It’s energy, a shared illusion we all agree on. 

I can consciously choose to focus on either the positive or the negative in any situation. Even if I were trillions in debt right now, and it led there through gambling, I could forgive myself and still experience happiness. That’s because happiness doesn’t come from the outside, it comes from acceptance.

That doesn’t mean life’s purpose is to feel good or happy all the time. Someone who feels neutral or good on every level stops moving. Ups and downs are what make us act and evolve. Feelings are signals. They exist to guide us toward change, not to keep us comfortable.

The system we live in made life about money and convinced people that money is the purpose. That’s how power is maintained. Money creates movement, but so does a good heart. The system itself isn’t inherently bad, it becomes bad depending on whose hands it’s in.

One of the main reasons people feel lost is separation. We’re isolated in our own bubbles, given artificial meaning, and rarely given real opportunities to create something good with our lives or resources. 

So people chase money endlessly, drifting further from purpose, while becoming more isolated from one another.

Many people turn to drugs to fill a hole that exists because of this system, a lack of mentorship, family, brotherhood, or guidance. Gambling works the same way, often worse. Some people have too much of everything but no purpose and chase the next high. Others have nothing and gamble out of desperation. The root is the same.

If someone follows exactly what the system teaches them, then of course once they get everything they thought they wanted, they realize it wasn’t the purpose, and they cope with gambling, drugs, or other escapes because they don’t know what else to do.

I started questioning reality and the system early in life. I dropped out of school, went against what was expected, and created a life I thought I wanted. I studied everything except what school taught. I lacked proper guidance and mentorship. I became self employed, built passive income, and from about age 15 to 22 lived almost entirely behind a screen, gaming, smoking weed, drinking energy drinks, eating badly.

Dopamine wise, it was the best time of my life. No one could explain why I shouldn’t live that way, so I thought I was doing everything right.

Eventually, I became extremely unhealthy and was diagnosed with stage 3 cancer. When I received the diagnosis, I went to the roof of a building and thanked God and the universe for it. I already wanted to help others before that, but I was stuck in comfort. The diagnosis was the kick I needed.

I had a massive tumor in my chest. Doctors told me I wouldn’t live more than two or three years unless I removed my testicles and went through chemotherapy. I refused. I did a 40 day fast, changed everything, and about a year later the cancer appeared temporarily healed. I haven’t been checked in the last five years.

That experience completely ended my old life. I stopped using my PC, rebuilt my health, changed my lifestyle, learned obsessively, changed how I made money, and eventually created another life I thought I wanted, healthier, wealthier, and more stable. I found my partner and built something externally perfect.

What never changed was my inner orientation. I’ve always been focused on the suffering in the world, not emotionally drowning in it, but intellectually and structurally. Constantly identifying problems, understanding why they exist, and forming solutions. Those solutions evolved over time, which is why I’m glad I didn’t act too early. For a while now, the vision itself hasn’t changed. It feels complete.

What’s worse than having no purpose is having a clear one and not acting on it. I’ve lived a life many people dream of, yet I didn’t enjoy it. I felt short chemical highs while distancing myself from reality, including through gambling.

I’ve spent most of my life isolated, apart from my mother and my fiancé. I became the mental, emotional, and often financial support for others, while lacking true friendship, mentorship, valuable connections, or momentum myself. Being alone with a mission is dangerous, clarity without movement becomes a loop.

I’d wake up, do my routine, motivate myself with music and ideas, spike dopamine with coffee, then crash into scrolling, overstimulation, insomnia, and eventually gambling again, not out of desire, but out of depletion.

Now, after hitting financial rock bottom for the first time, I’m almost forced out of my comfort zone. I genuinely appreciate it. The chaos between fear, responsibility, and awareness is breaking old patterns and opening a new chapter.

I don’t judge anyone. People act based on what life gave them. Many were never humbled without being broken. My own suffering shaped me, humbled me, and helped me keep my heart intact.

I can’t offer help with gambling losses. What I can offer is understanding, honesty, and perspective. And if I ever manage to build something real, a community or brotherhood rooted in purpose and creation, I’ll reach back and offer a place.",2,1770032272.0,problemgambling,0,0.75,False

Since moving to Portugal we have discovered that all the bougie roasters focus on maximizing the flavor notes of their single origin beans and sacrifice body along the way.

I’m on a quest for more body and some caramelized sugars but stopping before dark. Love chocolate/caramel - hate wine/acid. IIRC my favorites were Full City or Viennese but it’s been a long time since I’ve thought much about it. (Child rearing years meant buying acceptable beans at Costco)

1qtslj2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SolidMen/comments/1qtslj2/10_books_thatll_make_you_dangerously_confident/,10 Books That'll Make You DANGEROUSLY Confident: The Psychology Behind Real Attraction,"

okay so i've been researching confidence for like 6 months now (books, podcasts, psychology papers, the whole deal) because i noticed something kinda fucked up: most advice about becoming attractive is either recycled garbage or straight up wrong.

here's what nobody tells you. confidence isn't something you're born with. it's literally a skill you build through changing how your brain processes social situations and self-worth. i went deep into the science behind charisma, body language, and social psychology from actual researchers and therapists, not those fake gurus on tiktok.

the thing is, most of us grew up with conditioning that actively sabotages our confidence. society, parents, past rejections, even biology plays against us. but once you understand the actual mechanics of how confidence works, you can reverse engineer it. sounds dramatic but it's true.

here are 10 books that genuinely changed how i show up in the world. not the typical self help BS you see everywhere.

1. The Confidence Gap by Russ Harris

this book won multiple awards and Harris is an internationally acclaimed acceptance and commitment therapy trainer. basically he flips the entire confidence conversation on its head. instead of ""fake it till you make it"" bullshit, he teaches you how to take action WHILE feeling afraid. the book uses ACT principles (acceptance and commitment therapy) to rewire how you respond to fear and self doubt.

i'm not exaggerating when i say this book will make you question everything you think you know about confidence. it's not about eliminating fear. it's about doing cool shit despite being terrified. insanely good read that actually gives you practical exercises instead of vague platitudes.

the core insight: confidence follows action, not the other way around. you don't wait to feel confident before approaching someone or speaking up. you act first, confidence builds after.

2. Models by Mark Manson

before Manson wrote The Subtle Art (which blew up everywhere), he wrote this brutally honest guide about attractiveness and dating. it's aimed at men but honestly the principles apply to everyone. Manson has this way of cutting through manipulative pickup artist garbage and getting to what actually matters: vulnerability and authenticity.

this is the best dating psychology book i've ever read because it doesn't teach you tricks or lines. it teaches you how to become genuinely attractive by developing your lifestyle, emotional honesty, and social skills. the section on neediness vs non neediness alone is worth the price.

he breaks down why trying too hard repels people and how paradoxically, caring less about outcomes makes you infinitely more magnetic. backed by actual psychology research too, not bro science.

3. Attached by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller

both authors are psychiatrists and neuroscientists, and this book is basically required reading for understanding relationship patterns. it explains attachment theory (secure, anxious, avoidant) in super accessible language. once you understand your attachment style, SO many confusing patterns in your dating life suddenly make sense.

the book helps you identify why you're attracted to certain people (often the wrong ones) and how to build secure, healthy connections instead. it's research based but reads like a friend explaining psychology over coffee. genuinely eye opening stuff that made me realize i was self sabotaging without even knowing it.

if you struggle with relationship anxiety or keep dating emotionally unavailable people, this book will hit different.

4. The Charisma Myth by Olivia Fox Cabane

Cabane coached executives at places like Google, Facebook and Harvard. her whole thesis is that charisma isn't some magical gift, it's learnable behaviors and mindsets. she breaks it down into presence, power, and warmth, then gives you specific techniques to develop each one.

this book is packed with neuroscience and practical exercises. like actual things you can practice today. the section on body language and vocal tonality is incredibly detailed. she explains how tiny adjustments in posture or eye contact completely change how people perceive you.

what makes someone instantly likeable? how do you project confidence without arrogance? she answers all of it with scientific backing. plus the writing style is engaging, not dry academic stuff.

5. Daring Greatly by Brené Brown

Brown is a research professor who spent 20 years studying shame, vulnerability and courage. she's basically the world's leading expert on this stuff. Daring Greatly became a NYT bestseller because it challenges the toxic idea that vulnerability is weakness.

the core message: real confidence comes from embracing imperfection and showing up authentically. people are drawn to those who can be genuine and undefended. Brown backs everything with research data from thousands of interviews.

this book made me realize i was wearing a mask constantly and it was exhausting. once i started being more vulnerable (strategically, not trauma dumping), my relationships and self image improved dramatically. sounds cheesy but it's legit transformative.

6. No More Mr Nice Guy by Robert Glover

okay the title sounds like incel garbage but hear me out. Glover is a licensed therapist who works with people pleasers (mostly men but not exclusively). the book addresses how excessive niceness often masks deep insecurity and neediness, which ironically makes you less attractive.

he explains the ""nice guy syndrome"" where you do things for others expecting something in return, then feel resentful when it doesn't happen. it's manipulative behavior disguised as kindness. Glover teaches you how to set boundaries, express needs directly, and develop genuine self worth.

the exercises on identifying covert contracts (unspoken expectations) were uncomfortably accurate for me. this book is essential if you struggle with people pleasing or feel like you're always putting others first while neglecting yourself.

if you want to go deeper on these topics but don't have the energy to read through everything or don't know where to start, there's this smart learning app called BeFreed that's been useful. It's built by AI experts from Google and pulls from sources like the books above, psychology research, and dating experts to create personalized audio content based on your specific situation. You can set a goal like ""i'm naturally shy and want to become more magnetic in social situations"" and it'll build a learning plan tailored to you, then generate podcasts you can adjust from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with examples. The voice options are pretty addictive too, you can pick anything from a smooth, conversational style to something more energetic. Makes it easier to actually absorb this stuff while commuting or at the gym instead of just collecting books you never finish.

7. The Social Skills Guidebook by Chris MacLeod

MacLeod is a counselor specializing in social confidence and this guidebook is comprehensive as hell. like 400+ pages covering everything from conversation skills to making friends to handling social anxiety. it's structured like an actual textbook but way more readable.

what i love is how practical it is. he doesn't just say ""be confident,"" he breaks down specific scenarios with concrete strategies. how to join group conversations. how to handle awkward silences. how to read social cues better. all the stuff schools never teach you.

if you feel socially awkward or missed out on developing these skills naturally, this book fills in all the gaps. it's basically social intelligence training in book form.

8. Psycho Cybernetics by Maxwell Maltz

this book is old (1960s) but it's a classic for a reason. Maltz was a plastic surgeon who noticed that changing people's physical appearance didn't always boost their confidence. he realized self image lives in your mind, not your face.

the book introduces techniques for reprogramming your self image through visualization and mental rehearsal. sounds woo woo but it's actually backed by cognitive psychology. elite athletes use these exact methods.

Maltz explains how your brain's self image acts like a thermostat, constantly pulling you back to your perceived ""normal."" to change your confidence permanently, you need to update that internal image. the exercises on mental visualization are incredibly powerful once you actually do them consistently.

9. Radical Acceptance by Tara Brach

Brach is a psychologist and meditation teacher, and this book blends Buddhist psychology with Western therapy. the core teaching is about ending the war with yourself. accepting your flaws and mistakes instead of constantly trying to fix or hide them.

i know it sounds counterintuitive but self acceptance is magnetic. people can sense when you're comfortable in your own skin versus performing. Brach gives you meditation practices and cognitive techniques to develop genuine self compassion.

the chapter on the trance of unworthiness hit hard. most of us walk around with this constant internal monologue saying we're not good enough. that energy repels others. this book helps you break free from that pattern.

for building that deep, unshakeable confidence that comes from within rather than external validation, this is essential reading.

10. The Like Switch by Jack Schafer

Schafer is a former FBI special agent who spent his career getting people to trust him (spies, criminals, etc). now he teaches the behavioral science behind likability. sounds intense but the book is actually super practical and readable.

he breaks down the four friendship signals (proximity, frequency, duration, intensity) and explains exactly how to make people comfortable around you. body language, verbal cues, specific conversation techniques. it's basically a manual for becoming more socially influential.

the sections on reading people and building rapport quickly are incredibly useful. whether you're networking, dating, or just want better friendships, these skills apply everywhere. he backs everything with psychology research and field experience.

what makes someone instantly trustworthy? how do you create connection fast? Schafer answers it all with concrete techniques you can use immediately.

look, reading these won't magically transform you overnight. but if you actually implement the insights (not just consume and forget), they'll compound into genuine confidence and attractiveness. the kind that comes from understanding yourself and social dynamics at a deeper level.

these books taught me that confidence isn't about being perfect or never feeling fear. it's about moving forward anyway, being authentic, and developing skills that make social situations easier. that's what actually makes someone magnetic.",1,1770031880.0,SolidMen,0,1.0,False
1qtskyg,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/1qtskyg/unemployed_gap_year_after_undergrad_and_before_ls/,Unemployed gap year after undergrad and before LS - how to pass background check?,"I graduated from college last June, and had been focusing on my law school applications since. I'm international so I flew back to my own country. I tried to make the most of time working on my LSAT and essays so I didn't find myself a traditional paralegal/legal assistant job.

During the past 8 months while I worked on my law school applications, I also worked as an essay editor for an American college counseling firm (fully remote position) as well as doing a part-time job at a local coffee shop. The college counseling firm paid me in cash. And the local coffee shop in my own country is just unlikely to be reached by an American third-party company that conducts background check and be offered as reference.
So there is no W2 or paystub for me. My supervisor at the college counseling firm, however, would be able to verify that I worked there. 

I just got a full-time legal internship offer from a nonprofit organization in Cali, which starts in February and will likely end before law school starts in August. I plan to leave all these essay editing and coffee shop jobs to do this internship. 

My questions are:
1. If I list my essay editor role on my resume, will this be considered as a full-time job? Will it pass the background check by law firms? 
2. If not, am I just unemployed for the past 8 months, and will that look bad on my resume? What's the best way to explain this 8-month gap? Do firms care about what you do between undergrad and law school? 
3. Should I continue with this essay editor job, or should I accept the full-time internship offer? I think the internship interests me a lot more in terms of what I do, but I know a ""full-time job"" experience is viewed better than any internship/volunteer roles. It's just that the job I have is not the traditional kind of job that I'm super proud of, and I don't even know if they can pass the background check. 
4. Can someone please explain to me how the background check is going to work? Will they request to see my W2, which I can't provide?

1qtskid,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1qtskid/how_to_not_go_back_to_toxic_relationship_while/,How to not go back to toxic relationship while pregnant?,"I’m 20 and currently 33 weeks pregnant. I’ve been with my boyfriend (22) for almost two years.

At the beginning of our relationship, we talked a lot about the future — kids, family, plans, how everything would be when we had a child. It felt like we were on the same page.

But when I actually got pregnant, everything changed.

This pregnancy has been very hard physically. I’ve been hospitalized multiple times and I’m often in pain and exhausted. Emotionally, I’ve felt very alone.

After I got pregnant, he became angry all the time. He yelled a lot, insulted me, and got upset over small things.

At home, everything was my responsibility — cooking, cleaning, laundry. If I didn’t do something or didn’t do it “right,” he would get angry and yell. He often said that since I stay at home, I should at least do all the housework because he works. Whenever I said I was in pain, he dismissed it and said I couldn’t be tired or hurting if I was “just at home.”

Even when I was in pain myself, I still took care of him — made tea, brought medicine, helped him when he didn’t feel well. That care was never returned.

Whenever I tried to talk about the baby, plans, or my fears, he either ignored me or answered with a few short words. I never felt like I could really talk to him. Sometimes he even got angry and said I was “overthinking” or worrying about nonsense.

When I needed to go to the hospital to check on the baby, he complained and acted annoyed. One time I thought my water had broken. On the way to the hospital, he stopped for coffee and wanted me to go inside. I said I felt too unwell and stayed in the car. He yelled at me and said he wouldn’t even go to the hospital with me.

I went in alone. Doctors were briefly worried about the baby’s heartbeat and asked where the father was. I had to tell them he wasn’t there. That moment made me realize how lonely I’ve felt.

The breakup itself happened over something small. On our anniversary, I cooked and tried to do something nice. He demanded my vape. I said no. He immediately said we’re breaking up, packed his things, insulted me and my family, and left.  front of my grandmother, he yelled at me and called me names. Later she told me her biggest fear was that he would hit me. I couldnt tell her that he slapped me in the face. Another time he grabbed me by my sweater and screamed directly into my face. I didn’t fight back or insult him. When he said he wanted to break up, I said “okay” and stayed silent while he kept yelling.

After couple days he texted me

My BF: Will you be my Valentine?

Me: Don’t joke with such nonsense.

My BF: I’m asking because it’s already getting close.

Me: You broke up on our 2‑year anniversary, so think about what the answer should be. And remember what you promised.

My Bf: Nothing is going to work out.

Me: So there’s no Valentine either. You broke up on our 2‑year anniversary, so think about the answer.

My BF: That’s how it should be. When a person is toxic and harms you just because they can, I won’t be with that person no matter the circumstances.

Me: Harms you? Not giving a vape for looking at other women? Yeah right — I was toxic, not you.

MyBf: What does not giving a vape have to do with anything? Answer me :D

My BF: Why couldn’t you give the vape?

Me: “Let me vape” — “No” — “I want to break up.”

Me: You definitely didn’t break up because of the vape.

My BF: Why couldn’t you give the vape?

Me: Why couldn’t you stop looking at other women?

My BF: Because I don’t want to be with someone who lies, manipulates, and behaves like a child.

Me: Yeah.

My BF: I feel really good now. I’m free.

Me: Great, I’m happy for you.

My BF: And you ended up alone because of your own crap. I tried to warn you. You didn’t listen. Here you go.

Me: Not alone. I will never be alone again. Thank you.

My BF: See how good you have it now.

Me I’m not complaining.

My BF: So will you be my Valentine?

Me: No.

My BF: Fine, I’ll look for someone else.

Me: Good luck.

I already realize he still doesn’t see anything wrong with his behavior, and my attempts to build a family with him were seen by him as “manipulation.”

I know logically that leaving is better for me and my child. Everyone around me tells me not to go back. But emotionally, it’s hard. I still love him and struggle not to text him or hope he’ll change.

I’m not looking for judgment.

I just need advice on how to stay strong and not go back?",1,1770031789.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

# Materiel Shortages

Her fortunes had certainly changed.

Before, quality guns had been hard to come by, not that she’d have managed to do much with them with her old crew. No jammer, either. Only one railgun prototype had been on offer, and she accepted the gracious gift by keeping it in the hands of their best marksman, on overwatch, wired together by engineering students with no faith it might actually fire.

The fool that she’d been replaced with had been gifted a fuller set, only to come up empty and realize that for the dozens of ops run, none had been a standing fight. Experienced operatives they might have been, that wasn’t and never had been their forte. And now she was starting over, materially speaking at least. Yet she was optimistic, where anyone else would have been despairing. Whatever one might say about a lack of progress in New York so far, she felt she finally had what she needed.

The gift she coveted most was the one she’d hoped most for. Someone close to Emperor, someone dangerous.

She’d spotted him by the way the rest of her new squad kept an unusual amount of space between them. The way they’d shuffle aside and make room for someone else. She was on a ‘prove-it’ basis, and the observer was here. She’d at last gotten the insurgency’s full attention.

The patrol was one she’d staked out personally, and true to their behavior they’d never strayed from it even in the interceding months. Jackal smiled. She could still work with what she had.

Just a walk to scope out the protest site, which she knew just how to turn into a bloodbath.

“So,” Jackal said to the open air, not turning around to the presence she knew had followed her to the rooftop. “What do I call you?”

There was a moment’s hesitation, and the answer made her heart soar.

“Vendetta.”

Recognition. She was close, now, and she knew it.

\*\*\*\*\*

# Latent Horror

*Why am I here? I hate my job. I should have told her to try it. But then what?* He didn’t know.

So it was that he found himself in a shil’vati psychiatric office. It had a strange feeling to it. It had been a long time since he’d smelt anything so sterile, even a dentist’s office didn’t have this feeling. Even stranger, he was being evaluated by a shil’vati in a white coat. He tried to wrestle down the strange, disorienting feeling that swept through him at the sight. Some part of him whispered: *What does she know? What could she know?*

He supposed she might know through training.

“Have you tried talking with your elders?” She paused. “Elias Sampson suggests that.”

He had to resist the temptation to repeat it back at her with a mocking sneer. It was how she justified everything. Some dumbass human out there built a name for himself as some sort of human-whisperer celebrity pop-psych asshole, the new Dr. Oz. “Yeah, uh, that’s kinda what got me in this trouble. I just, you know, I feel like they sold us out.”

“Who is ‘they’? And to who did ‘they’ sell you out to?”

He twiddled his thumbs rather than answer those questions. Every time he’d opened his mouth so far, he felt like he was digging himself in deeper. Giving her license to do *something.* Even if she adopted a human-lent name, there was something about her that screamed to not trust her. This might be called xeno-phobia in some sense, but was it still a phobia if it was justifiable?

“It’s not really, you know…” he was struggling with words for now. “He’s not someone I look up to.”

“Ah, lack of a positive male role model, I read about this, too. Have you consulted your history, or looked for other ones? Say, your leaders?”

He stared. “Uh, like, former presidents and stuff?”

“Yes,” she said enthusiastically. “That might be an excellent place to start, though their attitudes are a little out of touch, given how quickly your society has changed.”

“Which one?” He almost felt daring as he asked, some mischievous part of him wanting her to accept one of his choosing, and then imagining her horror at what they’d think of modernity. “Teddy Roosevelt? Maybe Andrew Jackson?”

“Why not the one you have now?” She smiled a little too widely. “You can relate to him. There’s an older human male figure. Successful, too. He’s your peoples’ leader. Certainly you have more in common with him, given all the recent changes, than someone so old. You live in the same time period. That has to matter for a lot.” He could see where she was trying to steer him and it felt like it was just more lies. “He’s done a wonderful job facing his human-ness and the…challenges that can bring. We have whole courses dedicated to dismantling one’s own internal struggles. We find it helpful.”

“Wait, hold on. Humanness?” He decided not to flip the script on her for who ‘we’ were, if she wanted to know who ‘they’ were. She probably knew, even when she’d asked the question, and only wanted an answer to damn him with, though to what he didn’t know.

“You are human, aren’t you?”

He was, but he’d rarely engaged with what that meant. “Constantly grappling with that fact sounds exhausting, like I couldn’t dedicate any more energy to doing anything else. I don’t want to second-guess everything I want to do.” Life was hard enough without that, wasn’t it? Would ‘facing his humanness’ grant him better opportunities? Would it get him a house, or even an apartment? Find a good human girlfriend in this dying town, and start a family? Would this make these things more, or less likely to happen? He knew the answer. It was of no help to achieving the things he wanted.

“I hate to ask again, but you are human, correct?”

So was the goal to change what he wanted? Would that be better, reframing success? It sounded an awful lot like ‘accept less and be happy.’ What would they change the new definition to? Who ought to decide what was good for him to want, if not him? Probably that ‘we’ who found ‘dismantling…one’s own…’ whatever else she’d said, as being ‘helpful’. And even if there was a point to guiding him on what he wanted, who was she to him? Sure, sugar wasn’t as great to live off of as he’d thought it was back when he was eight years old, but he was an adult now, wasn’t he? A child wasn’t allowed to make big decisions for a reason, but an adult was.

*Then again, I need the help, or I wouldn’t be here, would I? And if I walk out of here, I’m walking back to that stupid fucking uniform, that stupid fucking job, doing the same shit, for what?*

“Last I checked,” he managed a slight smile, and patted himself down for a little extra comedic effect to defuse the situation. “Aren’t you a shil’vati?”

“You’re not taking this seriously,” she pouted. “If this is making you nervous, I’m going to write a prescription and put you on a treatment plan.”

Supposedly the difference between the new pharmaceuticals and the old was that theirs actually worked the way they were supposed to. That had sounded good when he’d first heard it, but the way she’d spoken hadn’t sounded like any doctor visit he’d ever had. It sounded more like a threat than anything else.

By what mechanism the research was done to bridge the gap between their physiology and humanity’s, he didn’t know. There were other aliens, though, some of them had to have iron blood. It was a big galaxy, and the Shil’vati civilization was old.

“Alright,” he relented. “You tell me about the treatment, and in turn, I’ll ‘confront my humanness.’”

She seemed surprised at the about-face, then hesitant. “It’s a bit experimental,” she began. “And somewhat controversial, but we believe it showed great promise before the trial ended. I’ll just need your consent.”

“I’ll think about it,” he said. “How about if I have another episode, we move forward with it?”

“That sounds reasonable,” she said, her smile bright and tusky. “Why don’t you take a brochure with you?”

At least she hadn’t tried sleeping with him.

At least he didn't have to pay for this tripe.

*Cheaper than a movie.* The idea of lying to her entered his mind more than once, just to see what sort of fiction he could spin up for his own entertainment, but then he wondered if that would mark him as a serial liar, rather than bored out of his mind.

Oscar tucked the brochure into his pocket and walked toward the elevators before stopping, intrigued by what view he might get from up here.

This building was, to sum, quite large and remarkable only in how nondescript it was. Plopped down in some sort of hideous brutalist shape. All concrete and hard angles, with not a scrap of vegetation around.

Some weirdoes who fancied themselves 'smart' and took themselves far too seriously probably regarded it as 'orderly', but it was also scraped completely clean of anything that might be called 'local.' Or friendly to life.

It might have been Pennsylvania, but could have just as well been California, Germany, or even further-flung parts of the world, though it lacked the glass and at least somewhat expressive forms of the modern true skyscrapers that had come about in the last fifty years.

Then again, this place had been a dying third-rate city even before he'd been born and never held any glass spires. All he'd ever seen was decline. Any achievements from here were from many decades ago, and it seemed increasingly likely that it would never be known for anything good ever again.

There had once stood old black and white photographs of giant foundries filled with men standing shoulder-to-shoulder, some stained with the unmistakable evidence of hard work that was meant for more than mere forgettable consumption. He doubted that in a hundred, or even fifty years, that anyone would hang a photo of him serving a customer with equal pride, no matter his work ethic.

Though now the old museum had taken down most of its exhibits of the past, too. He couldn't quite say whether this was due to some embrace of biblical 'pride' as a sin. Given the church's sudden reemergence of hard-line theology in the wake of the invasion and loss of tax-exempt status and all government grants, and the way the local government talked about humans like they, too, weren’t, it felt like a toss-up.

What was down these hallways? He wasn't sure. Perhaps the allure of exploring was putting off having to see the building's architecturally hostile exterior. That, or a general lack of excitement, a total dearth of anything to look forward to that awaited him outside its doors that beckoned him to wander.

The room inside was lit only by the ‘exit’ sign, so he fumbled for a light switch.

Odd. The smell of fresh cheap plaster had been put up, acrid stench travelling up his nostrils until he snorted back out. There was also the smell of the intense use of cleaning products. The only other time he could recall such an intense smell of pinesol, he’d cracked the whole container open after dropping the container on the tile with soap-slick hands. What exactly happened here to make the cleaners use so much of it, and what was it masking?

There were none of the telltale signs of a burst pipe, the ceiling panels were all uniform and even. New, but not *so* new. There was something ominous about this place, something that made the hairs on his arms and the back of his neck stand on end. Maybe it was the way the paneling seemed to absorb all sound, including his own footsteps. Or how when he pulled out his cell phone and flicked on the flashlight, the long shadows were cast like invasive digging claws.

This section felt new. Too new to need so much disinfectant, even in such an old building. In the center of one of the rooms was a chair, more reminiscent of a dentist’s recliner. It wasn’t a light on the suspending arm, though, it was shaped like a pair of skiing goggles, which he faintly recalled from his time on Blue Mountain.

A translucent purple-hued ribbon travelled up the arm, down to a set of binaural earmuffs hanging on the side, like the world’s most immersive video game setup. But by far the most alien was the helmet. It looked like a scooter helmet, in that it didn’t extend to cover the chin, and he realized the shadowy lines were interlocking plates that gave it a vaguely insectoid appearance. However it was meant to be adjusted, it was clearly meant to do so firmly, and with straps, pads, and restraints over the jaw in several places.

In fact, there were several straps, most of them mounted to the strange looking padded chair. He’d UrbEx’d State Hospitals in Norristown and Allentown, even dragged along to [Pennhurst](https://imgs.search.brave.com/J0HruIe5BO0yRxxuLh0oW8Q0vq6HHG5oMtPW_uBstk0/rs:fit:860:0:0:0/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9hYmFu/ZG9uZWRpbjM2MC5j/b20vd3AtY29udGVu/dC91cGxvYWRzLzIw/MjQvMTIvcGVubmh1/cnN0LXN0YXRlLXNj/aG9vbC1hbmQtaG9z/cGl0YWwtMjQ2MC05/NjB4NjM2LmpwZw), and he’d never seen anything quite like it.

Oscar tried to think of the Shil’vati upstairs, and her too-cheerful smile. There wasn’t anything Stepford about it, despite her buxom appearance. It had been almost daring him to step out of line. Why had that bothered him so much, and why did it spring to mind now?

He’d remembered stepping around the homeless screaming agitatedly at nobody in particular. They’d fixate on him or someone else, or even the open air. Oscar had tried to not make any judgments about the site’s closures.

The medical tables were among the most commonly travelled parts. The straps that hung so familiar here, he recalled, were supposedly to allow medical procedures for patients who refused to stop moving. But this wasn’t that sort of place, was it? Or might it be some day again? Those people had all but disappeared in conjunction with better medical treatment, supposedly discharged back to the public. Coupled with the reunification plan, they’d all found their way home. Right? And then this place closed. After getting new plaster. And a new ceiling.

It didn’t add up.

As Oscar circled around he noticed the interface for an omni-pad about the size of the ones the Shil’vati usually carried around when they tried paying with credits.

He finished circling the centerpiece and glimpsed back at the door that still hung ajar.

Oscar was never one for the occult. One classmate having brought an Ouija board and folding paper to tell fortunes and portending his imminent doom had been enough of a foray. His only other dabblings had been coming across faded pentagrams in ‘haunted’ buildings left by edgy teens. Yet now every instinct was telling him to run for his life from an empty room in a neglected office block by the sight of, for all he could say might have been a modern gaming chair.

Besides, if he was wrong and if he was caught? Then what?

*Oh no, then I won't be able to go to work tomorrow.*

He didn't know what he was living for anymore. That phase had come from someone, somewhere, sometime, and it niggled at his brain. No, he’d heard it more than once, hadn’t he? That’s why he’d blinked when the new guy at the store had said it. It was familiar, somehow, and the man had seen it register. Why? Where?

With a shaky hand, Oscar turned the cell phone flashlight off, and took a few photos with the flash on, wandering around the mysterious object. This building wouldn’t count for UrbEx points, and the forums were gone. Even so, this was the sort of thing he needed evidence of having seen, or else tomorrow he might wake up wondering if he’d actually dreamed it. If the photos weren’t there, he told himself, then he really was in need of more sessions upstairs.

At last he straightened and remembered where he’d heard it, that familiar phrase, freezing still and slowly tiptoeing out of the room. If memory could bleed into the walls and then tell a story, it would tell all to those who came back to this room. And they’d come for him. Oh they would, though he knew not what they’d do when they got him he might guess it an unpleasantness. They’d want to know. They’d want to know all about his little radio on the old alarm he’d heard the transmissions from Delaware with. 

Sure, Oscar didn’t terribly care one way or another, but the resistance transmissions were undeniably the only interesting thing on the airwaves. They’d gone quiet since, become predictable and tame, save reports from New York of some new outrage or another he’d missed the start of. It made him feel like a detective, piecing together the situation even if he had no control over it, nor even any skin in the game.

The less one heard about a zone on the official airwaves, the more likely it was going pear-shaped for everyone. And he hadn’t heard a peep about their neighbor to the North for a few days, now. It was scary, he reflected, how they could make an entire zone- no, a *state* disappear from your vision like that. It just wasn’t talked about anymore.

The words echoed again in his ear.

*What are you fucking living for, then? And if you can’t answer that, then there are definitely some things worth killing!*

And then he’d heard it again, the first half at least, from a customer. Albeit, sans an expletive, and muttered idly, rather than a screamed challenge over a crackly old speaker. He was with that new church organization down the road. He’d had a businesslike countenance, with a touch of world weariness that Oscar found intriguing.

He’d have to go find him.

Oscar slid the phone into his pocket and stepped out, slowly pulling the door shut behind him and went to the elevator, his heart hammering in his chest.

Governments need to move beyond faith in market self-correction and legacy institutions and instead build disciplined arrangements in small groups of countries to align public policy with private capital. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s Critical Minerals Ministerial meeting on 4 February will be an important step in this approach.

While it is uncertain which nations other than Australia and India have been invited, Rubio’s calling together of counterparts for the inaugural meeting in Washington is a clear signal that critical minerals have moved from a sectoral concern to a macro-strategic problem. It can be assumed that Rubio will leverage the Pax Silica group, established in December. The United States-led initiative focuses on critical minerals and technologies and includes countries such as Australia and Japan. Canada, Taiwan and the European Union are currently observers, and India is expected to join.

Rare earth elements and other critical minerals—essential to defence systems, clean energy, advanced manufacturing and digital infrastructure—are now embedded in markets where normal price discovery and risk allocation no longer function.

Countries that do not want to be dependent on and vulnerable to China’s ability to withhold the export of critical minerals as a coercive tool, including Australia, should aim to ensure that the ministerial is the starting point and not a one off.

ASPI’s longstanding work on critical minerals, including through the 2023 and 2024 Darwin Dialogues, demonstrates that the current challenge isn’t cyclical volatility but structural market failure. While rare earths are mined in several countries, value is captured overwhelmingly downstream. China controls roughly 70 percent of global rare earths production but, more critically, it controls close to 90 percent of worldwide processing and refining capacity, including separation and magnet production.

That degree of concentration is incompatible with market competition. It has resulted in uncompetitive and unfair practices to put political pressure on not only smaller powers but, increasingly, the US and major European countries. It reflects Beijing’s sustained industrial policy, non-transparent state support and a willingness to absorb losses to secure long-term strategic advantage. We have watched the free market be bought, stolen and subsidised in a deliberate strategy to reduce China’s dependence on the world while increasing the world’s dependence on China.

It is now clear that geography and geopolitics are finally outweighing geology in determining economic security outcomes. Concentrated processing capacity exposes importing states to coercion, supply disruption and strategic leverage.

The limits of traditional multilateral responses have been exposed. Institutions such as the World Trade Organization weren’t designed to manage strategic competition in sectors where commercial behaviour is inseparable from state power. Topics such as intellectual property theft, diplomatic coercion and monopolies are seemingly beyond scope or, sadly, even reform. WTO processes are slow, retrospective and poorly equipped to address non-transparent subsidies, informal export controls and state-directed pricing.

Even where cases have been won—as with Japan’s vital win in 2014 relating to China’s blocking of rare earths—the WTO findings process takes years and, after a temporary reprieve, Beijing merely returns to global coercive and unfair trade practices. Most coerced countries choose short-term compromise rather than facing the time, money and effort it takes to achieve an international ruling. Australia and the EU have both started and then stopped WTO cases against China. Australia ended two cases (wine and barley) in 2023, one of which had been with the WTO for more than three years. This means that, for critical areas such as minerals, a national policy that relies on WTO remedies isn’t risk management; it’s strategic complacency.

Unilateral responses—such as public statements and investments in domestic rare earth capacity—by nations facing such coercion are necessary but insufficient. No single country can replicate an entire critical-minerals production chain (mining, processing, manufacturing and recycling) at scale without accepting high fiscal costs, creating inefficiencies and introducing new vulnerabilities. Subsidies alone cannot create resilience. Supply chains are ultimately built by firms responding to credible demand signals and manageable risk profiles, not by policy declarations.

This is why minilateralism is the most credible response—for the economy, security and sovereignty. Smaller coalitions of trusted partners can align policy, capital and industry in ways that global frameworks can’t, at least presently.

In the field of critical minerals, Australia and Canada are logical anchors. Both offer large, geologically diverse resource bases; stable regulatory systems; and deep technical capability that should be viewed as complementary, not competitive. When paired with the industrial scale, capital markets and technological depth of the US, Japan and South Korea, these countries form a nucleus capable of supporting resilient, diversified value chains without excessive fiscal leakage. It is then feasible to have these regional powers formally join with European powers to create a truly global partnership that prioritises trusted and reliable supply chains, not just cheap ones.

Such resilience has a price, but sovereignty is about fighting for freedom, not expecting it for free. Diversifying supply chains will raise costs in the short to medium term. Policymakers must acknowledge this explicitly. Pretending otherwise leads to underinvestment, policy churn and misallocated subsidies. The policy task is not to eliminate costs, but to decide which costs are acceptable to reduce systemic risk.

Crucially, governments cannot resolve this problem without structured, ongoing engagement with the private sector. Mining companies, processors, financiers and manufacturers understand project timelines, capital intensity, permit-provision risk and market volatility far better than most policymakers. Without that insight, public policy will continue to misprice risk.

Security imperatives also don’t justify abandoning environmental, social and governance standards, including those around modern slavery. Failures in these areas are material supply-chain risks. Projects that lack social licence face delays, litigation and capital withdrawal—outcomes that directly undermine resilience objectives.

This is why the Critical Minerals Ministerial should be backed. If it succeeds, it will accelerate a shift from fragmented national responses towards disciplined minilateral cooperation grounded in commercial reality. Ongoing failure will mean that critical-mineral markets will remain distorted, capital will remain cautious and strategic vulnerability will deepen.

The ministerial would also demonstrate that democracies such as Australia can manage different threats simultaneously. Those worried about what a changed US means for allies can argue against President Donald Trump’s tariffs and position on Greenland while still working with the US to constrain and counter the control China has on our economies and technological ecosystems. That, in fact, would be consistent foreign policy in the national interest.

# Feb. 1st, 2026~US, UK, EU, Australia and more to meet to discuss critical minerals alliance

*About 20 countries including G7 states in talks on rare earths including calls for US to guarantee minimum price*

[US, UK, EU, Australia and more to meet to discuss critical minerals alliance | Mining | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2026/feb/01/us-uk-eu-australia-critical-minerals-rare-earths-g7-minimum-price)

[An aerial view of the MP Materials rare earth mining and processing site in Mountain Pass, California, US. Photograph: AP](https://preview.redd.it/3sjfu925d2hg1.png?width=3800&format=png&auto=webp&s=10c8f01badfbf8922f3fdda1081f13eba4c82f55)

Ministers from the US, EU, UK, [Japan](https://www.theguardian.com/world/japan), Australia and New Zealand will meet in Washington this week to discuss a strategic alliance over critical minerals.

The summit is being seen as a step to repair transatlantic ties fractured by a year of conflict with Donald Trump and pave the way for other alliances to help countries de-risk from China, including one centred on steel.

Australia said on Friday it would establish a A$1.2bn (£610m) strategic reserve of minerals it believes are vulnerable to supply disruption from China, which last April [restricted exports on rare earths](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/16/china-trade-war-us-arms-firms-rare-earths-supply) in response to Trump’s [“liberation day” tariffs](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/02/trump-new-tariffs-liberation-day).

It is the second summit on the matter within a month and involves about 20 countries including the G7 members – the UK, US, Japan, France, Germany, Italy, and Canada – along with India and South Korea and Mexico, Australia, New Zealand and possibly Argentina.

One area of discussion will be calls for the US to guarantee a minimum price for critical minerals and rare earths. A report this week [that Washington has decided against the idea](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/us-moves-away-critical-mineral-price-floors-sources-say-2026-01-28/) sent shares downwards in Australia, which has been positioning itself as a critical minerals alternative to China with a decision to stockpile elements such as antimony and gallium.

It follows in the footsteps of Japan, which has actively built reserves for years to build resilience against China’s willingness to switch off supplies to advance its foreign policy.

Canberra’s resources minister, Madeleine King, said a US decision not to offer minimum pricing “won’t stop Australia from pursuing our critical minerals reserve programme”.

The Washington meeting has been convened by the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, as he and other countries in attendance hope to ramp up non-China supply chains as fast as possible with potential pricing and investment support.

“Strengthening critical mineral supply chains with international partners is vital for the US economy, national security, technological leadership, and a resilient energy future,” the US state department said in a pre-summit statement.

EU sources said that if talks were successful, a joint statement would follow which could be seen as a milestone shift in relations with allies working with the US to de-risk from China instead of constantly fighting off Trump’s tariff threats.

A UK minister will attend, the Foreign Office said, adding: “UK economic security goes hand in hand with national security. That’s why we are working to ensure a diversified critical minerals supply chain – a vital step to securing economic growth in the UK.

“We look forward to continuing these important discussions with key partners.”

The EU is also expected to use the summit to press the US to drop its new [global steel derivative tariffs](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/28/eu-industry-fears-ever-expanding-list-of-derivative-goods-subject-to-steel-tariffs), which would lead to punitive levies on steel content on products that have elements of steel ranging from aluminum doors and bicycles to hair straighteners and offshore wind turbines.

The first derivative tariff list was published in August, after Trump shook hands on the EU tariff deal at his Scottish golf course in July, but before the joint statement on the deal at the end of August.

The Trump administration has threatened [to introduce a second list of up to 700 products this January](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/08/businesses-worldwide-brace-extra-trump-tariffs-steel-imports), but the list has yet to appear giving the EU and the UK hope that they could still drive home their point.

“We have complained a lot,” added one EU insider, while another said: “We hope they will take this into account as they are a breach of the deal in August.

“They could argue that the first batch were announced between the deal in Scotland and the US-EU joint statement, but the second batch are a breach of a deal.”

“This is about trust. You sign a deal and you trust it will apply,” said an EU source. “This constant threat of more tariffs, whether [10% because of Greenland](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/17/trump-tariff-european-countries-greenland) or [200% on champagne](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/20/trump-tariffs-over-greenland-are-an-error-says-ursula-von-der-leyen) because they don’t sign up to the ‘board of peace’ has to stop.”

The Trump administration has been convening multilateral consultations since October, when it [agreed to a 12-month trade truce with China](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/30/trump-and-xi-meet-in-south-korea-for-crunch-talks-on-trade), which had threatened to choke off rare earth supplies in the escalating tariff dispute between them.

The minerals have become some of the most essential raw materials for modern manufacturing, needed to produce everything from smartphones to fighter jets, to wind turbines to music speakers.

Europe’s supply of permanent magnets, which are made with rare earths which have high magnetic properties[, comes almost entirely from China.](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2026/jan/10/china-mine-europe-rare-earth-metals-swedish-producer)

According to senior European Commission officials in December, the EU uses 20,000 tonnes of permanent magnets a year, of which 17,000 to 18,000 tonnes come from China, with just 1,000 from the EU.

# “While Governments Talk Supply Chains, NioCorp Is About to Build One!”

\*\*\*\***Washington Is the Catalyst — NioCorp Is Already in the Room!\*\*\***

While headlines argue about price floors and alliances, the real action is happening quietly in **Washington, D.C. — and NioCorp is already there**. Mark Smith has stated plainly in recent presentations that NioCorp is actively meeting with **EXIM and federal stakeholders**, not pitching theory but advancing a project already architected to meet U.S. national-security criteria: fully domestic, DFARS-compliant, and vertically integrated across **seven critical minerals**.

The **ramp infrastructure is staged**, dual-portal equipment is on site, and Elk Creek is transitioning from “development” to **execution**. That matters because EXIM does not underwrite concepts — it underwrites projects that can actually be built, operated, and defended geopolitically. Ramp initiation is the first hard proof point, and it collapses the biggest risk shorts still lean on: delay.

Next comes **February’s Scandium-Aluminum alloy reveal**, with Lockheed and DoD involvement already in play. This is the gateway catalyst. ScAl qualification ties Elk Creek directly into defense procurement pathways, Title III eligibility, and long-duration offtakes. \*\*\*\***Once ScAl moves from validation to program relevance, NioCorp stops being optional to the defense supply chain!**

[For 30 years, every aerospace, EV, and defense prime has said the same two things about scandium: “We can’t design Sc-Al alloys without a reliable U.S. supply,” and “We can’t build supply without committed alloy demand.” That deadlock froze the entire U.S. scandium industry — until now. NioCorp didn’t just talk it to death, it broke the loop by moving downstream into Sc-Al alloys, FEA-IP Revolutionary production methods, and real platforms meant to make actual stuff. And this is where Ecclestone’s take collapses under its own weight: hand-waving about “no market” while ignoring that markets don’t exist until someone builds the ecosystem is intellectual laziness, not analysis. NioCorp isn’t waiting for permission — it’s doing the one thing critics never model: committing capital, partners, and engineering to force demand into existence. That’s not hype — that’s how industries are born. Like TITANIUM in the 1950's!](https://reddit.com/link/1qtsj14/video/3adgql33g2hg1/player)

In **March**, the updated DFS lands — and this isn’t for retail. This is the document EXIM, DoD, and Tier-1 primes need to lock structure, sequencing, and capital deployment. **Mark has been clear: the DFS reflects improved project economics and a cleaner path to construction financing. This is where D.C. conversations turn binding.**

At the same time, **offtake discussions** are advancing across multiple products — not just scandium, but Niobium, Titanium, TiCl₄, and Rare Earths tied directly to defense and advanced manufacturing. This multi-metal reality is what shields NioCorp from policy noise: it doesn’t need a single subsidy, floor, or buyer — it has **multiple strategic demand vectors**.

This all leads to the real endgame: **EXIM FID in mid-2026**. When EXIM commits, it isn’t signaling — it’s anchoring U.S. materials sovereignty. That moment reframes Elk Creek from “a mine” into a **national-security asset**, and it resets valuation math entirely.

**Short interest exists because markets trade narratives — but D.C. trades timelines. Ramp start breaks the “if.” ScAl breaks the “who.” DFS breaks the “how.” Offtakes break the “will.” EXIM breaks the “when.”**

NioCorp isn’t waiting for policy to save it — **policy is already aligning around it**.

What’s emerging now is **not a retreat from price support**, but a **shift in how it’s delivered** — away from blunt, taxpayer-exposed floor guarantees and toward **structured demand signals** like long-term offtakes, strategic stockpiling, equity stakes, Title III/EXIM financing, and multi-lateral buyer coalitions.

**The DOE’s pushback inside the Reuters article itself matters:** it signals internal disagreement and, more importantly, that **price stability is still a policy goal**, just executed through contracts and alliances rather than headline “floors.”

The February Strategist & the Guardian reporting, and the Rubio-led critical minerals talks all point to the same thing: governments now recognize these markets are structurally broken and are moving to **de-risk projects by locking in buyers, not propping up prices in the open market**.

**Translation: the smart projects won’t need a public floor —** they’ll get **private, defense-backed pricing certainty** via offtakes and financing. **And that’s exactly why integrated, multi-product, DFARS-compliant platforms like NioCorp are being pulled into D.C. conversations while single-stream plays are sweating headlines.**

[“2026 is the year.” ](https://reddit.com/link/1qtsj14/video/cds8o1pkg2hg1/player)

**Mark Smith has been unambiguous —** ***“2026 is the year.”*** Not a hope, not a slogan, but a sequencing statement backed by actions already underway: ramp initiation, Washington D.C. meetings with EXIM, the February ScAl alloy validation with Lockheed and DoD, the March DFS designed for financiers and offtakers, and a mid-2026 EXIM FID. Smith has repeatedly emphasized that Elk Creek isn’t being built for headlines or subsidies, but to deliver **fully domestic, DFARS-compliant critical minerals at scale** — and that timeline converges in 2026. This is the year execution replaces speculation, when discussions turn contractual, and when NioCorp transitions from “future supply” to **strategic reality** — exactly as Mark has been telegraphing all along.

1qtshyb,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_adviceBD/comments/1qtshyb/we_became_roommates_who_occasionally_had_sex_the/,We became roommates who occasionally had sex. The 777 Rule saved us from a divorce I thought was inevitable.,"
Last Tuesday, my husband walked through the door with pizza. I looked at him and felt... nothing…
Not anger. Not love. Just this blank space where us used to live…
Seven years of marriage. Two kids. A mortgage. And we had become roommates who occasionally had sex.. The pizza was supposed to be our date night. But we sat on opposite ends of the couch, him watching sports, me scrolling Instagram, sharing a pepperoni in silence ...
I remember thinking: Is this it? Is this what we fought for?
That night, I cried in the bathroom. Not dramatic movie tears. Just... exhaustion ... The kind that comes from loving someone but forgetting how to like them.
The rule we laughed at
A friend told us about the 777 thing six months earlier. Every 7 days, a date. Every 7 weeks, a night away. Every 7 months, a real vacation.
We laughed. Who has time for that??.. We were busy. Successful. The kids needed us. The house needed us. Our careers needed us ….
We didn't need a rule. We needed ... what? I couldn't even name it.
But that pizza night broke something. Or maybe it broke something open. Because the next morning, I looked at him sleeping and realized I didn't want to lose him. I just didn't know how to find him again ...
The first real date
We started stupidly small Seven days later, we went to that diner we used to love. The one with the sticky menus and terrible coffee.
I wore jeans that weren't yoga pants. He shaved. We sat across from each other like strangers, awkward as teenagers.
What do you do all day??? I asked him.
He looked confused. You know what I do. I work…
No, I said. What do you do??? What makes you laugh? What pisses you off? I used to know.
And he told me. About his asshole coworker. About the project he's actually proud of. About how sometimes he sits in his car in the driveway for ten minutes before coming inside because he needs silence.
I hadn't asked in years. He hadn't offered.
The night away that changed everything
Seven weeks later,,, we left the kids with my mother. Drove two hours to a crappy motel with a broken ice machine. Cost $89.
We didn't have sex. We talked until 3 AM. About the miscarriage we never discussed. About how he felt like a paycheck to me. About how I felt invisible as just a mom.
The words hurt. But the silence afterward didn't. We held hands in the dark, listening to the highway outside, and I felt him come back. Not all at once. But piece by piece.
Why the number doesn't matter
Some people say rules kill romance. It should be natural, they say. Spontaneous.
Those people probably aren't drowning in laundry and deadlines and the thousand tiny betrayals of a busy life.
For us, the number was a lifeline. Not because seven is magic. Because we needed permission to prioritize us. We needed to count, because we had stopped counting each other as important.
Sometimes it's 5 days, not 7. Sometimes it's a lunch date, not dinner. The rule isn't the point. The remembering is.
What I want u to know
If you're reading this at 2 AM, wondering where he went - the man you married, the man who used to look at you like you were the only person in the room - he's still there ..…
You're still there.
But u have to hunt for each other. In the chaos. In the exhaustion. In the maybe tomorrow that becomes maybe next month that becomes maybe never.
Start with one date. One real conversation. One night where you remember why you chose this person.
The pizza isn't enough. The couch isn't enough. You need to leave the house, leave the roles, leave the everything else, and find each other again.
We almost didn't. That pizza night could have been the beginning of the end. Instead, it was the end of the beginning.
Now, seven months later, we're planning our first real trip. Just us. No kids. No agenda. I'm terrified and excited in equal measure.
Because loving him again means risking losing him again. But not loving him? That's a death I don't want to die.
When did you last really see your husband? Not the father, not the provider. The man. Tell me below ....
This 777 thing saved my marriage. I actually wrote down a detailed guide/framework of how we implemented it with all the awkward conversation starters to help a friend. If anyone is going through this and wants it, I'm happy to share.

Episode 7 Wish World- John Smith wakes up, has breakfast and goes to work every normal day until a mysterious older woman calling herself the Doctor arrives requesting his help to save the universe. Titles, here we see Anita Dobson credited as that traveler from time and space. This episode features Ms. Flood as the Dr. and John Smith as the companion. This Dr. allegedly claims something has happened with our reality having changed into something informally unnatural, though John wants nothing to do with her. Going to work he greets his neighbor Miss Ruby Sunday asking about her mum who she is pleased to report is doing wonderful, Everything is Wonderful! Going to work John gets behind his desk as a part of the Unified National Insurance Team under his boss Kate Stewart. Kate introducing them to their new partners, the Kalids who recently immigrated here and are needing a new home. Talking with his coworker the formerly Hot Seargent Dude they discuss the exciting day ahead of them glad that Everything is Wonderful. In the corner of his eye John sees this Dr. lady watching him, eventually he goes to confront her asking why she’s following him and how she even got in here? She mentions with her ship, the Tardis, taking John to go see it-  to find an empty room. She mentions the Tardis, “must’ve popped off for a bit have you seen it, dear?” John leaves upset and confused seeing a vision of a woman named Belinda screaming, asking for the Dr. to help her. This Doctor encourages John to have his doubts about what he was seeing.

At home John sits at a table for dinner without food/ not eating pondering to himself as we hear the 9^(th) Dr.’s theme starting to play, John decides to go out when he finds Ruby at his door? He asks her what she’s doing going out in the middle of the night and she asks why he was about to do the same, John discounts the idea that something is wrong with the world though Ruby claims that he knows something is not right, “Everything is NOT wonderful.” Suddenly the police arrive taking Ruby away claiming she was a known criminal, when John asks what her crime was they claim she’s a leaker, known for spilling things she shouldn’t/ reference to her spilling coffee. He is encouraged to stay inside. The next day John is greeted by new neighbor, “Susan”, who has moved into Ruby’s home. John asks if they’ve met before but Susan claims she doesn’t believe so. Later at work John sees that odd little Dr. running around and he meets up with her asking more questions, she confides in him that she believes that the world they’re living in isn’t real, that someone has used a baby God of Wishes named Desaderium to create this Wish World where Everything is Wonderful! Naturally John thinks she’s insane but she points out he’s still there, listening to her. She claims to have fought other gods namedropping the foes this Doctor has faced, John shuddering when hearing the name Sutekh. Deciding to take a chance John and this Dr. investigate a Time Fissure, a crack in space and time that has appeared atop UNIT Tower/ where once the Toymaker once stood, explaining to John that Fissures or cracks in time can sometimes be responsible for the loss of memories as things slip out of existence but sometimes, just sometimes, they can also be used to create something new. This Dr. tells him sometimes things that are lost can often be storied in the strangest of places and she hands him a pocket watch. John timidly opens it and nothing happens. This Dr. comically shrugs and guesses she must’ve been mistaken. He’s not special after all. Suddenly John sees a vision of Belinda screaming in the Tardis asking for help. John remembers he’s the Doctor and summons the 

*Processing img fzc6k2p7a2hg1...*

Tardis racing inside as Belinda has been crashing through space this entire time! Taking command of the Tardis 15 claims the Wish World is affecting the Tardis controls and he attempts to fly them away from its influence, flying out of the Wish World where they promptly crash into their past selves when the Tardis first headed into Wish World. The past Tardis is sent flying and Belinda is left shrieking inside. Meanwhile John wakes up in his bed ready for another normal day because Everything is Wonderful. Everything is Always Wonderful. The woman formerly known as Ms. Flood introduces herself and we see a montage of John going to work, saying good morning to his neighbor Ruby, and the events always leading up to his eventual death when escaping in the Tardis. Throughout these many days Ruby begins referring to John as Mr. Smith, to John, Doctor John, then simply the Doctor. This occurs for an unknown amount of time until one morning when Ms. Flood comes to introduce herself to John she finds him missing. She finds John out on his back deck staring silently at the sky. She asks him what’s wrong and he replies, “no stars.” She replies, “it’s daylight.” Every morning Ms. Flood attempts to convince John to come with her and search for the Tardis but not this morning. This morning she leaves and recommends to someone off screen, “you’d better go talk to him.” Meanwhile Ruby investigates the strange feeling she has that this world is not real, she has horrible visions in her head of a monster of pure death laughing at her as she cowers in fear, and her determination to no longer be afraid forcing her investigation leading her to a group of like minded individuals keeping the wheelchair scene from the episode where she learns something is wrong but when someone asks any questions they are taken away by the police force and forgotten, discarded as if they never even did exist. Back with John doesn’t go to work that day, he ignores the phone calls and simply sits either inside or out staring at the sky when she arrives knocking on his door. John finds a woman named Susan waiting for him, and she asks to be invited in. The two talk casually though the conversation slowly becomes more deep, with John subconsciously speaking about his granddaughter, the granddaughter he left long ago who was now waiting for him, then he begins referring to Susan as her, his granddaughter. He begins to tear up and Susan asks him why he’s crying, 15 replies he doesn’t think she’s real. Susan calls him a fool. Suddenly Ruby bursts into the house yelling for the Doctor to get away from her when Ruby is shot dead in the back, the other Dr. Ms. Flood arrives holding a smoking gun in her hand. From Ruby’s bag Scoot comes rushing out enraged to attack Ms. Flood when Susan pulls out her own sonic screwdriver aiming it at him, the little polish bot smokes and goes up in flames as Ms. Flood looks down emotionlessly. Ruby dies in the Doctor’s arms saying she was brave for him, waking him up to the truth of their situation. His memories regained this time he does not rush off to the Tardis and chooses to confront the pair demanding to know who they are. Ms. Flood’s hands begin shaking and Susan gently cups her hands in her own then places a hand on Flood’s cheek, the two hug with golden regeneration energies dripping through their fingers. “Susan” tells Ms. Flood, “it’s almost time now, just a little bit longer my lovely”. Ms. Flood turns back to face the Doctor no longer shaking, stronger than ever. They tell the Dr. it has been educational watching him die repeatedly. The Dr. enraged demands to know where the baby is, the God of Wishes. The two cackle surprised that he actually bought that. There is no baby god of wishes there never was. The Dr. again demands to know who they are. Ms. Flood laughs saying, “they? I think you mean she? As in singular.” The Doctors mutters, “one? Not just two… you’re the same person?” Susan steps up and reveals, “I am the Rani. Survivor of Gallifrey, exiled to this miserable planet while you trot about my stars. No Gods are above me, only below. A good thing you got your memories back, I was beginning to have doubts! You’re just in time, together we will build a new world. A better world. Welcome Doctor, to Judgement Day.”

*Processing img 7k4wu4x8a2hg1...*

The world begins shaking around them. The Rani’s reveal they have taken the Doctor’s Vindicator and used every place he went with it, every time he timed hopped trying to get Belinda home and turned his timeline into a web crossing his timeline repeatedly, something that is supposed to be forbidden. Forbidden based on the potentially reality threatening effects such an act could have. Trapping him at the point of his final destination, May 24^(th) before the Rani’s reversed the polarity by pulling all those destinations he visited to them at once breaking down the barriers of time and space. The Doctor is horrified asking why they would do something like this? The Rani’s claim the universe is already dying, from the Master re-wiping out Gallifrey, to the destruction of the Flux and the horrors that Sutekh unleashed resulting in the numerous Time Fissures appearing all across the stars, the paradox the Dr. had created is helping to tear the universe apart and now everything is breaking down. She created this Wish World as a focal point, a ground zero for the universes collapse upon which she will begin again, making it the sole defense stopping the break down of reality all she had to do then was wait, wait while watching the Doctor- the only one left who could stop her- repeatedly fail without even knowing it, all the while his actions only hastening the End. Here she will create a new reality and reveals the Time Lords will herald it into fruition! 15 says, “but the Timelords are dead?” The Rani agrees but denies claiming, “One survives. One who is undying, the only true immortal Timelord, he who waits in the dead space: OMEGA”. Petrified the Doctor asks what do they need me for, the Rani flatly replies, “I don’t.” Summoning his Tardis the Rani laughs kicking him inside using her own sonic screwdriver to lock the doors, the Tardis takes off and is sent hurtling into his past arriving self trapped in the paradox.

Episode 8 The Reality War- The Tardis is sent hurtling into its past self ready to continue the paradox of him dying repeatedly only this time there is a key difference that hasn’t happened before. This time he knows what’s happened before and what is coming. Moving quickly the Dr. makes his most desperate play and opens the heart of the Tardis– granting his wish to survive as the Tardis is shieled by the heart from destruction breaking the paradox loop, though 15 is now glowing with golden energy. Returning the power to the ship the Tardis lands back in the now decaying world. At the eve of the Reality War 15 reunites with Belinda and Kate/UNIT, Kate reveals a UNIT officer located Scoot’s body and Belinda has a moment to mourn her friend, with the last of its power Scoot looks up raising his polish brush to her before the light dimming out. Meanwhile Kate correctly deduces 15 has done something and won’t be lasting much longer. 15 properly informs the group of who the Rani is with Kate helping to fill in any notes/ UNIT has files on her. Belinda asks how the Rani could even create something like the wish world and the Dr. tells her words have power, tell yourself to feel better and you will, given the right circumstances and with the rest of reality already coming down anything is possible. Kate also reveals a home is spinning in the sky \[formerly belonging to Ms. Flood\]. 15 reveals this is her Tardis and the chameleon circuit must be glitching. Time and space begin to crack around them creating massive time fissures as things begins falling out of the world \[think like the cups but on wider scale and they don’t stop falling\]. The Dr. realizes to tear down the wish world they must begin to reset reality, reversing everything that had caused the fissures such as with his previous doubts, with the first step being to arm the Kalid’s who proudly declare they will exterminate the creature/ Rani. 15 also tells them they’ll need to get the Vindicator back and destroy it thus setting the main goal. Fighting for all reality and as Belinda says, “for Ruby. For Scoot.” Heading out they find the universe has begun breaking down with the stars clearly visible and within reach, the ground shifting and rising like mountains if it still exists at all and the planets begin burning up. A few UNIT soldiers fall through the ground so the Dr. has everyone including himself tie a never-ending rope around themselves tethered inside the Tardis since the ship will remain and not fall away this will give them something to be attached too and not fall out of reality. With the city waiting upside down and bending around the group hop through the debris struggling to reach the Rani’s lair. Rani sends out the cool android looking things from episode acting as her guards UNIT firefight, with Belinda following the Dr. climbing through time fissures sees different scenarios playing out, he sees an astronaut planting a flag on the edge of the universe, two versions of UNIT caught in-between a firefight, one led by Kate the other by the Brigadier \[using clever placement of old footage and mostly  audio, maybe stand in actor to hide majority of his face\], he sees Belinda the night she was taken for the Contest and her normal daily do’s offering to let Belinda stay there saying that is genuinely her home the moment after she was taken, no tricks she can go home, the Dr. goes on and he sees Ruby all alone during Empire of D. 15 truly realizes magnitude of what his actions have caused- and the unintended side effects of his happy go lucky attitude have cost. He admits he selfishly enjoyed Belinda travelling with him and was glad it was taking so long to get her home, and he was just happy to have Ruby back on Tardis regardless of cost. 15 finds he has reached the Rani’s location and the source of the chaos, her Tardis having merged with the shape of Big Ben. The Dr. begins climbing with Belinda choosing to follow him, he tries to convince her otherwise telling to her wait and promising he will get her home but she affirms she will stay with him, saying, “I do want to get home. It’s not the greatest life but it’s mine. I love it. But you’re my friend. Two have already died for us. I won’t leave you behind. I won’t do that to them. Besides, you’d never leave me, right?” Together the two climb the building decaying the further he goes, till finally he reaches the Rani.

Meanwhile the Kalids assisting UNIT suddenly transform into Daleks though they continue to fight alongside them.

The Dr. reaches the top and confronts the twin Rani’s. The Rani has converted her Tardis and using the Vindicator into a Paradox Machine but she is struggling to control it, flashes of lightning striking around them revealed not to be lightning but cracks in reality/ like we saw in S5. The Rani’s goad 15 into being curious to see Omega, 15 admits he is but it’s not about him and he will stop them. He attempts to use his sonic to destroy the Rani’s Tardis console while the twin Rani’s counter with their own, destroying his sonic. Omega is unleashed as the Rani’s succeed in punching a hole through reality, and the valeyard of the Timelords falls in front of them a broken misshapen mess of bone. He is dead. He’s more than dead. That thing in front of them was never really alive. The Rani’s are horrified, her madness beginning to overwhelm her as she spirals out of control, desperate for Gallifrey and the Timelord’s return she boosts the Vindicator’s power with her twin sonics and reality breaks. For a moment there is silence. The fighting stops. Everything freezes. A dark shadow eclipses everything including the bleeding Sun and the sky. On the ground Kate asks, “what is that?” From above the Dr. mutters in terror, “’it’s the Time War.” In the distance a coiling, golden misshapen storm is hurtling towards them. The Rani has done it. She wished to restore the Timelords, to restore Gallifrey, and now she’s bringing it back based on her strongest memories of her home, of the war. The never-ending war. Down below UNIT fights alongside the Kalid- Daleks until the Daleks suddenly cease attacking, turning to face all UNIT they remain silent until crying in a unified chorus, “MAXIMUM EXTERMINATION!” And UNIT is slaughtered with Kate’s last sight being the Dr. at the top of Big Ben, the Time War fast approaching, the Oncoming Storm. 15 can’t fathom what the Rani has done and the Rani herself is horrified and delighted barely able to process it herself. More lightning strikes around the console room opening more tears in reality while 15 forces himself through the storm begging her to stop, even the Flood/Rani grows concerned seeing everything end around them, particularly terrified of the Time War. The other Rani claims the Dr. cannot stop her, as they’re in her Tardis she could choose to hide there in its many corridors for the rest of time when Belinda tackles the Flood Rani causing her to drop her screwdriver, taking them both through the gateway into Omega’s anti-matter realm where nothing of positive matter aka anything from our universe can exist. Belinda dies saving the Dr.’s life. 15 stares. Not angry or in grief. He can’t even begin to process what just happened, without warning. Being her only witness. 15 realizes without the Ms. Flood Rani she can never regenerate becoming this newer insane Rani. She will be erased from existence and perhaps everything that has happened can be reversed. But the Time War is still present. It itself being a reality ending event it persists with the Dalek armada descending onto the source of the time alterations, Big Ben.

Over their communications the Dalek Emperor calls for his fleet to seize “the Abomination” while offscreen we hear other Timelords saying Rassilon has gone mad ordering the bombing of all Timelord ships in a last-ditch effort to destroy the Daleks and the vulnerable emperor saying that with Davros gone now is their last, best chance at winning the war. The Dr. realizes it’s too late to turn them away, even after disrupting the Vindicator’s signal with the Flood Rani’s screwdriver the Time War is no longer time locked and is bleeding out into all of existence. The Daleks are coming. There’s nothing here that can stop them. The Dr.’s Tardis is still lost far away. His screwdriver has been destroyed. But he still has one thing, the Rani’s Tardis and he knows how to pilot it. Turning the Vindicator back on 15 flies the Tardis through time and space, using the Vindicator like a homing beacon letting the Daleks and in turn the Timelords follow, until he arrives at their destination: 15 opens the front door looking into the heart of the Time Vortex/ looking like the opening titles and shouts to Sutekh as he heads to his past self breaking the paradox, this all started with him, with the Doctor callous mistake at disrupting time, here his folly would end and his mistakes reversed as he frees Sutekh. Screaming “at last!” The younger Pre Empire Sutekh lunges for his Tardis and the God of Death gives their gift to the Daleks and Timelords alike, as 15 flies away narrowly avoiding the massacre as Sutekh single handily holds back the escaping Dalek/Timelord fleets, as the Time War is never-ending and eternal Sutekh will be killing them for the rest of eternity, and he’ll never stop as that would mean his own death, creating a new, safer paradox as the Dr. reverses the Vindicator, the Wish World reality is undone as the new timeline sets in, one where the Reality War never began and the Empire of Death never came to pass, undoing the fissures through time their previous paradox had created. The Time War remains locked in the past with its new companion, Sutekh himself acting as both prisoner and warden should their escape ever again come to pass. 15 lands the Rani’s Tardis and looks through her camera to see the world has seemingly been sent back to normal. Doing a final check to ensure no more anomalies exist 15 is shot through his chest by a dying Rani, she explains Time has a way of fixing itself, she might die but at least this way the Dr. may as well too forcing a new face upon them both, with her final breath she assures him, “they will meet again.” The Rani fades out of existence and 15’s bullet hole fades in and out, yet he remains falling over– clutching his chest. For a moment his hands glow and with his final tears he gulps down the incoming life. 15 emerges from the Rani’s Tardis to find UNIT already surrounding him, they’re confused as to why he has this new Tardis and what happened to his old one? 15 says he’s sure it’ll turn up eventually, reluctantly he looks back using his newly repaired sonic to destroy the Tardis when suddenly it flickers vanishing away, with the Dr. mentioning “some things can’t change, time has a way of fixing itself”, implying the Rani’s continued survival elsewhere. 15 greets Kate and Seargent Hot Dude saying he’s happy his favorite couple was

Alright, the two UNIT officers giving each other awkward looks while the Dr. laughs. The Dr. tells them to be good to each other when someone else emerges out of a UNIT vehicle, a revived Ruby followed closely by the polish bot and the Dr. laughs running forward to her giving her a great big hug. 15 and her discuss what happened to the Rani and Time War though no mention of Belinda’s sacrifice or the fate of Ms. Flood. Without his Tardis 15 joins Ruby for a drink at her favorite coffee place with Ruby mentioning she gets scared to drink anymore since her screw up in Space Babies destroying his console, 15 tells her not to worry about the past it made her the person she is today and he couldn’t be more proud. Ruby is flattered and somewhat embarrassed jokingly asking him why’s he so sweet today? 15 waves it off saying there’s no better time. He remarks how beautiful the day is with us getting a gorgeous shot of the warm Sun beaming through the windows of the coffee shop running over our two companions bathing them in a warm glow. Ruby replies, “it’s wonderful.” For a moment the Dr. looks at her scared before calming down, accepting and he says back, “yes it is.” “But it’s not perfect”, Ruby mutters. “It doesn’t have to be”, the Dr. smiles. Ruby confesses she still has bad dreams but they’re getting less frequent, and she says travelling with the Dr. these last 2 years is worth more to her than anything in the world, and she thanks him for his patience helping her through the nightmares. 15 thinks over that when he first met her she was just a kid but now look at her, she had grown so much in such a short time. He tells her she didn’t need his help but he was glad to be there all the same, he says to her when remembering these times going forward to take the good and leave behind the bad, the whole world is ahead of her, be brave and go see it. Ruby fearfully says this is sounding like a goodbye? 15 says, “I don’t like endings. So we’ll say… see you later. Just know if you ever need me all you need do is ask and I’ll be there. After all that is what family is for. I’ll be looking for you Ruby Sunday, I can’t wait to see what you’ll do next.” Ruby hugs him and says she’s doesn’t know why she’s crying, 15 tells her, “see you later, Ruby.” He places a hand on her cheek one final time before leaving. Outside the Tardis reappears, 15 joyfully exclaiming, “there you are!” Later the Tardis appears and from the distance he watches Donna and Rose Noble arguing in the kitchen, he smiles saying, “some things never change”. As Rose heads out- taking out the trash she stops and sees him in the distance, in a callback to Wilf and the Tenth Dr.’s final scene, and she smiles and waves. 15 smiles at her before reentering the Tardis and for some reason unknown to her Rose begins to cry. Inside the Dr. finds Belinda’s jacket and he folds it over in his hands mulling over his decisions as the jacket gets smaller and smaller before fading away completely. Time always has a way of fixing itself. We see a shot of Belinda’s apartment emptying its contents slowly but completely vanishing out of existence. Scoot strolls around the Tardis wearing the crown Belinda gave him before that too fades away. 15 looks at his hands as they once again begin to glow.

“Can you hear them? All those different faces speaking out at once… with the same voice. I’m done running. I wish I had more time but with the time we did have this was me. I am the Doctor. I wouldn’t change a moment of this for the world.” 15 begins to cry and the polish bot sweeps by cleaning up the mess, turning to stare at the Doctor. The robot had no face but if he did the Doctor would have thought he looked sad. 15 quickly wipes away his tears saying, “ah! No, no tears, not for me. This is not a sad ending. This is not the end. I have a promise to keep. Do you hear? Don’t go in fear. Go with that lovely smile.” 15 steps out the Tardis door having travelled to a specific point in space and time, where all that is left are the stars and the bright Light of Lux beaming down on him and the 15^(th) Doctor willingly gives himself away regenerating into Billie Piper. The end… for now…

  
So, surprise! Since there was so much Susan built up throughout the season I added this one in myself. Now I know this isn't a rewrite but stay with me on this on, just a little epilogue to what we could have had and this whole little experiment. Thanks for staying :D

https://preview.redd.it/osopgd4oa2hg1.png?width=8373&format=png&auto=webp&s=386b3e07e13727c95e335a5f9dcb833c72b7031d

15 and Susan

“You’ve gotten young.” “So have you.” “I knew you’d come back.” “I said I would and I meant it. I’m sorry I took so long. There has been a lot that has happened since I saw you last--” “I know.” “No, Sue you don’t I’ve done terrible things--” “It’s okay. I know you did your best. You always do your best…”

Doctor looks over at a nearby table filled with pictures. “That’s quite the family you’ve got there.”

“That’s quite the family I’ve got here”, Susan smiles up to him when she begins to cough. Her hand flickers once, glowing.

“Grandfather, will it hurt? What does it feel like?” \[regeneration\] The  Doctor smiles. “Do you remember the first time we stepped out of the Tardis onto an alien planet where the skies were the brightest blue and the fields ran green as far as the eye could see? Do you remember how you felt? All that excitement? It’s exactly like that. A brand new adventure.” “Would you wait with me?” “I wasn’t going to leave, not unless you asked me to.” The Dr. reaches out but nearly falters and Susan takes his hand as she begins to glow.

“Ohh, my little Susan. Look at those roots you’ve planted. I see all those pictures on the table. They’re overflowing with memories and that’s a beautiful thing. Because memories live on. Long after any of us… even us. They go on forever. I never doubted you for a minute, you know. I always believed in you and I always thought about you.”

“Grandfather… I’m scared.”

“Don’t be. There’s nothing to fear. Tell you what, I’ll tell you a story. Anything you like. Like I did when you were just a little girl all those memories ago. I’ll make it a good one. Ask me anything Susan. What do you want to hear?”

“Tell me the story of Doctor Who.”

“That is a long one but you know the first bit so I’ll skip ahead.”

“No, don’t you dare skip a word.”

Susan regenerates off screen.

  
Okay, so season wrap up. I'll be brief. I swear... :DDD

  
So, it's no secret season 2 and it's ending was divisive. Currently both the Reality War and Belinda are chopping charts for worst episode and worst companion, and 15 is fighting over 13 for worst Doctor \[all these are Nu-Who speaking\]. Not saying these are my opinions that just seems to be the consensus over this very divisive season and era. My job in this rewrite was to mostly rearrange what did and did not work however early on in Joy to the F\*cking World I realized I just wasn't jelling with this season the way I did last when writing. I truly believe if you're not passionate about what you're working on how can you ask someone else to be? So you should stop. Reorganize and try again. Basically, I went for a more black sense of humor and yes, a wee-bit of horror. Just a little bit papa Russell :0 

My goal for the season was to strength 15 and Belinda's characters with the benefit of hindsight in terms of 15 while delivering a truly Fantastic(!) season of Who. In a follow up season you have the audience's inherent consent, assuming they're sticking around, to get bolder and experiment. But if 15's leaving you also have the responsibility of giving him a fulfilling wrap up to his story. So instead of promising more I worked on presenting what was already said, with a few flourishes of course. Instead of incels and robots I added Cyberman and snuck in the Daleks to the finale. I ramped up the horror throughout especially in Lux and the Well and cut corners to save budget for those bigger effects wherever I could. Joy? Lovely actress but it was clear both Moffet and the audiences had their eye on Anita, let's use her for all she's worth and not bring her back just to hold a door. UNIT is... they didn't get much to do so let's tone down the family vibe to them and just let them be a military branch, at least here. Goodbye baby God and Bone Palace/ Dinos, Daleks instead. A win for everyone and no I have no regrets over those dinos, no laser gun kaiju battle \[sorry Ellie/Who Culture :(((( \] more character, less fanfare. 15's story is a tragedy, a good man full of hope and optimism believing himself to be better only for it all to come crashing down just as he was beginning to flourish. It felt rushed with Ncuiti leaving, so let's make that 15's arc. Life imitates art and sometimes it's the other way around. Also, I wanted to beef up the villains throughout the entirety of the era. Here the Toymaker is an all powerful entity hell bent on playing celestial games based soley upon his own whim. Even his own rules are just something he made up for fun! Sutekh is a false God, a cruel sadistic creature that lashes out at any real threat to him, he's not a God, but he wants to be seen as one. Worshipped like one. Lux is a creature that just can't stop himself, a slave to his own impulses and the Well... well... that thing is weird. The true definition of a psychopath, but it's got beef with the Doctor. The twin Rani's, a little play on the twin dilemma as she first appeared in 6's era in Classic Who, were a challenge. I loved the younger Rani's actress but she was written far too similar to Saxon Master for my comfort, and we had spent the ENTIRE ERA building up to Ms. Flood who I am convinced was supposed to be the Trickster it just makes Ruby's parents/ powers and baby wish God make so much more sense! Sutekh was a trick/red herring the entire time I swearz!!! :D

The key to the Rani's was she is insane, and eventually her other/ Ms. Flood self realizes it. Cruel? Sure. Uncaring, most of the time. But what's a scientist to do when she witnessed the most horrible acts in all of creation? She saw her world end, not just burn but the worst fate imaginable in the final days of the Time War. Let that be her drive. The loss of her race again to the Master, that was just the breaking point. She's long since snapped. Also Big Ben, that was just cool. Ultimately the season had to have weight, Belinda is gone and no one will even notice. But Scoot's still there! If I had it my way, he the Doctor and Anita would've been our Tardis team come season 3 :DDD

Yet I remained chained to this reddit board like Sutekh on a Blue Box. Tried the salt thing btw, doesn't work :(

That's it for now, I hope you all enjoyed this as much as I adored writing it. Who in any form is my favorite show and this character has been my hero since I started watching with Eccleston (the ending of Parting of the Way blew my 6 year old mind). One day I'm going to be the showrunner of Who, I'm saying it now because if I say it like it's true guess I'll have to make it happen, else I'll be a liar. If you want to see more stuff from me I've got a Utube channel linked, American Paint Job. I do gameplays and short films there, currently I'm getting ready to film a Silent Hill inspired short film. Hopefully it'll be pretty good. Either way, thanks for sticking around. Have a wonderful day. Side not- that one scene with Jodie was the most fun I had writing any version of the Doctor throughout the whole era. Her dialogue made me CACKLE!!! Chow! :DDD    ",1,1770031266.0,u_Fun_Debate_6534,0,1.0,False

But this situation has me actually questioning my sanity atm.

So for context: I am in Australia, working and living in a small town, enjoying a chill life.

2 weeks ago I meet this guy at a party. He‘s cute, we talk, he adds me on snap.

One night he asks to take me on a trip. Mind you: we haven‘t even hung out once and this is the first time he has texted.

I get excited: „yea, for sure“.

The whole night I am literally restless; „does this mean he likes me?“, „is he just looking for a hookup?“.

The next day he picks me up, we drive and have good conversation. Nothing crazy, nothing flirty.

We get dinner and head to the motel; a place with one bed.

„I hope that‘s okay“. I didn‘t mind, but it made his intentions a bit more obvious…

We go to bed, talk, go silent, he kisses me, we make out for a while.

I get tired so I stop and we cuddle pretty much all night.

Same sorta thing happens in the morning.

„Wanna grab some breakfast?“. That\`s what he says when pulling away. „Uh, sure“.

We get coffee, we meet up with friends and he proceeds to ignore me and act like nothing happened.

We drive back that same day. He does not mention anything. We talk normally as if this is not totally awkward and confusing.

He drops me home. The same questions bubble in my head; „does this mean he likes me?“, „was he just looking for a hookup?“.

And then: nothing. No text, no answer to any of these questions. Just utter confusion.

I didn‘t want to sleep with him and made that pretty clear. Maybe he was offended by that? If that‘s the case then I am better off without an explanation anyway.

I am not romantically interested in him and am definitely not looking for anything serious but I do feel like there was some sort of communication required to make this situation make sense.

It really made me question my worth; „why won‘t he text me?“, „am I not pretty enough?“, „Did I talk to much?“.

I feel like this is not something people do and that this is not a way I should be treated.

I just want an explanation while not sounding like a needy girl.

Somebody tell me they can relate and know what to do.

1qtse8z,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindfullyDriven/comments/1qtse8z/6_signs_someone_is_hiding_their_depression_the/,6 Signs Someone Is Hiding Their Depression (The Science-Based Help That Actually Works),"I've been researching mental health for years now, reading everything from clinical studies to personal accounts, listening to podcasts with leading psychologists, and watching countless talks from experts in the field. What struck me most wasn't the textbook symptoms we all know, it was how many people are suffering invisibly while appearing completely fine to everyone around them.

The term ""high functioning depression"" gets thrown around a lot, but what does it actually look like? According to research from Johns Hopkins and insights from therapists like Dr. Julie Smith, depression doesn't always show up as someone crying in bed unable to move. Sometimes it's your colleague who never misses work but has completely stopped enjoying anything. Sometimes it's your friend who's always making jokes but secretly feels hollow inside.

Here's what to actually watch for:



**\*\* They suddenly become ""too busy"" for everything they used to love\*\***

This isn't about being legitimately swamped. It's when someone who loved playing guitar suddenly ""doesn't have time"" anymore. Who used to hit the gym religiously but now finds excuses. Dr. Andrew Huberman talks about this on his podcast, how depression literally rewires your motivation circuits. The things that used to light you up just don't anymore. But admitting that feels vulnerable, so people hide behind the socially acceptable excuse of being busy.



**\*\* Their sleep is completely wrecked but they joke about it\*\***

Yeah, we all complain about being tired. But there's a difference between ""ugh, stayed up watching Netflix"" and genuine sleep disturbance. Depression messes with your circadian rhythm hard. Some people can't fall asleep until 4am, others wake up at 3am with racing thoughts and can't get back to sleep. The book ""Why We Sleep"" by Matthew Walker (neuroscientist at UC Berkeley, honestly one of the most eye opening reads about how crucial sleep is to mental health) explains how this becomes a vicious cycle. Poor sleep worsens depression, depression destroys sleep quality. But people mask it with self-deprecating humor about being a ""night owl"" or ""bad sleeper.""



**\*\* They're always ""fine"" with a suspiciously quick response\*\***

When someone asks how they're doing and they immediately say ""I'm good"" or ""fine"" without even thinking, that's actually a red flag. Genuine responses have variation. Real humans say ""tired but okay"" or ""a bit stressed with work but managing."" The instant, reflexive ""I'm fine"" is often a defense mechanism. Therapist Esther Perel discusses this in her work on emotional authenticity, how we're trained to give comfortable answers rather than honest ones.



**\*\* They withdraw but make it seem like their choice\*\***

""I'm just more of a homebody now."" ""I prefer staying in."" ""I like my alone time."" These aren't necessarily lies, but when someone who used to be social suddenly becomes isolated and frames it as a personality trait rather than a shift, pay attention. Research shows that social withdrawal is one of the earliest signs of depression, but people often rationalize it to themselves and others as introversion or being selective with their energy.



**\*\* Their appearance changes but they brush it off\*\***

Not talking about gaining 50 pounds or shaving their head. More subtle stuff. Someone who always dressed well now just wears the same hoodie. Hair that was always styled is now constantly in a bun. They stop wearing makeup if they used to. Or the opposite, they start putting MORE effort into appearance as a mask. Either way, there's a disconnect between their external presentation and internal state. The book ""Lost Connections"" by Johann Hari (investigative journalist who spent years researching depression and its causes, won multiple awards for this work) talks about how depression affects self care in these quiet, easily dismissed ways.



**\*\* They seem irritable or numb rather than sad\*\***

Here's something most people don't realize: depression often shows up as irritability, especially in men. Snapping at small things. Getting frustrated easily. Or the opposite, just flat. Not happy, not sad, just existing. Psychiatrist Dr. Daniel Amen discusses this in his work on brain health, how depression isn't always crying, sometimes it's emotional numbness where nothing feels like anything anymore. But try explaining to someone that you feel nothing and watch their confusion. So people don't.



**\*\* What actually helps (not the usual BS)\*\***

Honestly? Just being consistently present without forcing anything. Don't hit them with ""you seem off"" or ""are you depressed?"" That usually makes people defensive and retreat harder.

Instead, keep inviting them to stuff even if they say no. Send random texts. Share memes. Show up with coffee. Make it low pressure. No deep conversations required.

Makes it easier to actually absorb this stuff when you're commuting or just need something more engaging than reading.



If you're the one struggling, ""The Upward Spiral"" by Alex Korb (UCLA neuroscience researcher) is genuinely helpful. It breaks down the brain science of depression in ways that make sense and offers practical strategies based on actual research, not feel good platitudes. The book basically explains how small actions create neural pathways that can gradually shift you out of depressive patterns. Doesn't promise overnight miracles, just realistic tools.

Also the Finch app for building tiny habits when everything feels impossible. Sometimes brushing your teeth feels like climbing Everest, and this app gets that.



The hardest part about hidden depression is that by the time people realize something's wrong, the person has often been suffering for months or years. Biology, neurochemistry, life circumstances, all play roles here. But recognizing these signs in yourself or others, that's the first step toward actually addressing it rather than just surviving it.",1,1770031206.0,MindfullyDriven,0,1.0,False

I'd download a beautiful app, track religiously for 3-5 days, then hit a snag, miss a day, and boom – the whole thing would crumble, leaving me with that familiar shame spiral of ""I just can't stick to anything."" I used to wake up dreading my tracking app because it just highlighted all the red crosses.

My turning point wasn't some grand epiphany, but a slow, uncomfortable realization: *I wasn't failing at tracking; I was failing at understanding myself.* I kept trying to become a ""gym person"" or a ""meditate for 30 minutes"" person overnight. I'd read all the advice about consistency, but nobody ever really explained how to *build* that consistency when your motivation naturally waxes and wanes. My systems were too rigid, too perfect, and didn't account for real life. I realized I was trying to force myself into a mold, instead of designing a system that fit *me*.

Here’s the simple system that finally stuck for **90 days straight**, and honestly, it feels less like a system and more like a gentle commitment:

1.  **Choose ONE Keystone Habit (and make it tiny).**
    *   Forget tracking 5 things at once. Pick *one* habit that, if you did it, would create a ripple effect. For me, it was **drinking a glass of water first thing in the morning**.
    *   *The key here is to make it ridiculously easy*. Not ""go to the gym,"" but ""put on gym clothes."" Not ""meditate for 10 minutes,"" but ""sit quietly for 60 seconds.""
    *   I tried to start with ""journal for 10 minutes"" initially and failed. I scaled it back to ""write one sentence in my journal."" That made all the difference.

2.  **Anchor It to an Existing Routine (Habit Stacking).**
    *   This is where James Clear's *Atomic Habits* really clicked for me. Don't rely on willpower.
    *   Identify a habit you *already* do every day without fail. For my water habit, it was ""after I get out of bed, I will drink a glass of water."" For my one-sentence journal, it was ""after I make my morning coffee, I will write one sentence.""
    *   *Make the anchor as specific as possible*. Not just ""in the morning,"" but ""when the kettle boils.""

3.  **The ""Too Small to Fail"" Rule (Non-Negotiable).**
    *   If you're supposed to ""read for 20 minutes"" and you only have 5, you still do it for 5. If your goal is ""read one page,"" and you do that one page, it's a win.
    *   *The point is showing up, not the quantity.* I even made a rule: if I felt absolutely overwhelmed, I'd do 10% of my micro-habit. If my one sentence felt too much, I'd just write the date. It broke the ""all or nothing"" cycle.

4.  **Daily Micro-Reflection & Gentle Adjustment.**
    *   This is the part nobody talks about, and it's gold. At the end of each day (or first thing the next morning), I spend **60 seconds** asking:
        *   Did I do my chosen habit? (Yes/No)
        *   If no, *why not?* (No judgment, just data collection.) Was I too tired? Did I forget? Was the trigger weak? Was the habit still too big?
        *   *What's one tiny adjustment I can make tomorrow to increase my chances?* (E.g., ""Lay out the water glass tonight,"" or ""Move my journal to my coffee station."")
    *   *This wasn't about shaming myself for missing; it was about being a kind, curious scientist of my own behavior.*

This isn't some magic pill. There were still days I missed my water, or only managed a scribble in my journal. *The shame still tried to creep in.* My biggest mistake was trying to scale too fast once I felt good, or beating myself up for a missed day. This system won't work if you're looking for an instant life overhaul in a week or if you genuinely don't want to build the habit you've chosen. It's slow, it's gentle, and it asks for a lot of self-compassion. It took about 30 days for me to feel a real shift in consistency, and by 90 days, it felt automatic.

After 90 days, I've consistently integrated **three core micro-habits** into my daily life: drinking a glass of water, writing one sentence in my journal (which now often turns into 5-10 minutes of reflection), and a 2-minute stretch after my evening shower. The measurable changes? My mental clarity has improved from the water, my stress levels are noticeably lower from the journaling, and my body feels less stiff. Life isn't ""perfect,"" but I no longer dread trying to improve. I feel a quiet confidence that I can build anything I want, one tiny, gentle step at a time. *The cumulative effect of these small wins is truly amazing.*

Thought I’d share an updated list of the spots that are genuinely the busiest / most talked-about in and around George at the moment.

This is based on what I’ve seen on weekends, what friends are recommending, what’s always packed, and what keeps popping up in visitor reviews & local groups.


Perfect if you’re showing family around, have visitors coming to stay, or just want to know where everyone actually goes 😄
Top 10 Most-Visited Places in George (2026)


Redberry Farm
Still number one by a mile. Maze, strawberry picking (when in season), pony rides, farm animals, coffee & cake, kiddies play areas… it’s basically the default family day-out spot. Always busy, especially weekends and school holidays.


Outeniqua Transport Museum
The trains, the old buses, the Powervan ride up the mountain — people love it. Locals take their kids, tourists take a million photos. One of the few places in George that feels like a proper attraction.


Victoria Bay
When the swell is good, the parking lot looks like a surf comp. Even when it’s flat it’s packed with families, picnics and people just staring at the waves. Probably still the most photographed beach close to town.


Herold Wines
The view alone gets people driving up the pass. The tasting room, the fireplace in winter, the picnics in summer — it’s become the go-to wine spot for both locals and people from Plett/Knysna/Cape Town.


Fancourt (especially the golf courses & the estate vibe)
Whether people are actually playing or just going for breakfast/lunch/coffee at one of the restaurants, Fancourt is always busy. The new developments and the spa seem to be pulling even more people lately.


Garden Route Botanical Garden
Free entry, beautiful walks, great for dogs, birdwatching, picnics, and those insta shots of the mountain views. Locals use it a lot more than tourists realise.


Wilderness Beach (via the boardwalk & the long stretch)**
Technically not in George municipal boundaries anymore, but everyone still calls it part of “going to George”. The long walks, the sunsets, the paragliders — it’s always full.


The George Old Car Show (if it’s on)
When it happens (usually February), it’s hands-down the biggest crowd-puller in town. Vintage cars, food stalls, live music — the whole town comes out.


Dromedaris / Camphill Farm Stall / The Fat Fish / The Fat Fish takeaway
Not one single place, but the food spots along the N2 and in town that always have queues: Dromedaris milkshakes, Camphill pies & breakfasts, Fat Fish burgers & fish & chips. These are the ones locals and visitors queue for.


Seven Passes / Montagu Pass / Map of Africa viewpoint
People are doing these drives a lot more again — either as a quick scenic loop or heading through to Knysna / Plett. The viewpoints are always busy with cars pulled over for photos.


Honourable mentions that are climbing fast:
The new coffee & food spots in the CBD / Old Town area
Saasveld forest trails & mountain biking
Glentana & Herolds Bay beaches (quieter than Vic Bay but getting discovered)
The craft gin & beer places that keep opening
Did I miss anything that’s actually packed every weekend?

Where are you taking visitors this summer / Easter / winter school holidays?

Any new hidden gems that are suddenly blowing up?

Drop your thoughts below — would love to keep this list updated with what’s really happening on the ground right now 🙌

1qtsc61,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToxicRelationships/comments/1qtsc61/from_roommates_who_occasionally_had_sex_to/,From roommates who occasionally had sex to actually being in love again: The 777 Rule saved my marriage from a certain divorce.,"Last Tuesday, my husband walked through the door with pizza. I looked at him and felt... nothing…
Not anger. Not love. Just this blank space where us used to live…
Seven years of marriage. Two kids. A mortgage. And we had become roommates who occasionally had sex.. The pizza was supposed to be our date night. But we sat on opposite ends of the couch, him watching sports, me scrolling Instagram, sharing a pepperoni in silence ...
I remember thinking: Is this it? Is this what we fought for?
That night, I cried in the bathroom. Not dramatic movie tears. Just... exhaustion ... The kind that comes from loving someone but forgetting how to like them.
The rule we laughed at
A friend told us about the 777 thing six months earlier. Every 7 days, a date. Every 7 weeks, a night away. Every 7 months, a real vacation.
We laughed. Who has time for that??.. We were busy. Successful. The kids needed us. The house needed us. Our careers needed us ….
We didn't need a rule. We needed ... what? I couldn't even name it.
But that pizza night broke something. Or maybe it broke something open. Because the next morning, I looked at him sleeping and realized I didn't want to lose him. I just didn't know how to find him again ...
The first real date
We started stupidly small Seven days later, we went to that diner we used to love. The one with the sticky menus and terrible coffee.
I wore jeans that weren't yoga pants. He shaved. We sat across from each other like strangers, awkward as teenagers.
What do you do all day??? I asked him.
He looked confused. You know what I do. I work…
No, I said. What do you do??? What makes you laugh? What pisses you off? I used to know.
And he told me. About his asshole coworker. About the project he's actually proud of. About how sometimes he sits in his car in the driveway for ten minutes before coming inside because he needs silence.
I hadn't asked in years. He hadn't offered.
The night away that changed everything
Seven weeks later,,, we left the kids with my mother. Drove two hours to a crappy motel with a broken ice machine. Cost $89.
We didn't have sex. We talked until 3 AM. About the miscarriage we never discussed. About how he felt like a paycheck to me. About how I felt invisible as just a mom.
The words hurt. But the silence afterward didn't. We held hands in the dark, listening to the highway outside, and I felt him come back. Not all at once. But piece by piece.
Why the number doesn't matter
Some people say rules kill romance. It should be natural, they say. Spontaneous.
Those people probably aren't drowning in laundry and deadlines and the thousand tiny betrayals of a busy life.
For us, the number was a lifeline. Not because seven is magic. Because we needed permission to prioritize us. We needed to count, because we had stopped counting each other as important.
Sometimes it's 5 days, not 7. Sometimes it's a lunch date, not dinner. The rule isn't the point. The remembering is.
What I want u to know
If you're reading this at 2 AM, wondering where he went - the man you married, the man who used to look at you like you were the only person in the room - he's still there ..…
You're still there.
But u have to hunt for each other. In the chaos. In the exhaustion. In the maybe tomorrow that becomes maybe next month that becomes maybe never.
Start with one date. One real conversation. One night where you remember why you chose this person.
The pizza isn't enough. The couch isn't enough. You need to leave the house, leave the roles, leave the everything else, and find each other again.
We almost didn't. That pizza night could have been the beginning of the end. Instead, it was the end of the beginning.
Now, seven months later, we're planning our first real trip. Just us. No kids. No agenda. I'm terrified and excited in equal measure.
Because loving him again means risking losing him again. But not loving him? That's a death I don't want to die.
When did you last really see your husband? Not the father, not the provider. The man. Tell me below ....
This 777 thing saved my marriage. I actually wrote down a detailed guide/framework of how we implemented it with all the awkward conversation starters to help a friend. If anyone is going through this and wants it, I'm happy to share.

1qtsb08,https://www.reddit.com/r/Arrangedmarriage/comments/1qtsb08/gut_feeling_is_a_little_doubtful/,Gut feeling is a little doubtful,"I am a 30Y M based in the UK and nearing the end of my PhD. Over the past year, I have been speaking with several potential partners, mainly also based in the UK. A couple of months ago, I met a 30Y W who has recently completed her PhD and is now considering her next career steps.

From the outset, many things felt aligned. We share a similar lifestyle, communicate comfortably, and have met several times over coffee and lunch. She has been open about growing up in a very restricted environment and having a small social circle, which I understand and respect. I am aware that upbringing can strongly influence how people form friendships and express themselves.

Over time, however, I have noticed something that has left me feeling uncertain. During our phone conversations, she often mentions a particular friend she goes out with regularly, and on a few occasions, she has made indirect comparisons involving this person and me. I have not asked her directly about the nature of this friendship, partly because I do not want to appear intrusive or make assumptions without reason.

That said, my hesitation is also shaped by my past experience. My last relationship ended in 2024 due to infidelity in a long-distance context, and I am conscious that this has made me more sensitive to potential warning signs. I am trying to distinguish between genuine intuition and lingering anxiety from that experience.

At this stage, I am unsure how best to move forward. I do not want to ignore my discomfort, but I also want to approach the situation fairly, without projecting my past onto her or drawing conclusions without clarity. I am looking for advice on how to reflect on this situation and, if appropriate, how to address it in a respectful and emotionally mature way.

I am going to breakdown everything here. So, sit tight or stand or mess around while you read, I’m not going to judge. I am going to get into what I am NOT looking for in a friend first. Right from the jump, that way you can like, keep scrolling past or something haha. By the way, I type sometimes how I speak. It adds flavor in my opinion, but with important things (and due to years of writing in school and for fun) I will be more literate..

Right, so what am I not looking for? A yes man, someone who agrees with any and everything because come on. That’s boring and toxic in the long run for both parties. I want someone to tell me, yeah no you were wrong in that situation or you shouldn’t do this, do that. I will be the same. If we are talking for some time back and forth, I will be on your bottom like 👀 what are you doing? You’ve been sitting for too long staring at this screen, come on let’s go get a drink or make some food or get our daily stretches in today together. We can talk but like let’s be productive too, babes. 

Oh shit! That brings me to my next thing. Haha. Don’t take me calling you things as flirting. It’s not. I am generally the most respectful person in the case that I am not aware of offended someone. If you don’t want to be called hun or babes that’s fine. For my girls, I usually say girly anyway or like, your actual name haha. I am not looking for a partner. No, you will not change my mind and in the case that I did, I would let you know that I have and it would definitely be an in-person thing. Friends online seem more in reach at the moment. 

I do not want someone who dry texts, by that I mean someone who can’t keep up the conversations. I love a spammer (Not all the time, but it just hits so good when there’s been a good silence.. and then bam, bam, bam!! Attention overload!! And you’re like whaa- so good!! I also don’t expect to talk all day, that gets dull real quick. Plus, theres life and work. I mean, it truly depends on the two people. I’ve had a friend who we clicked instantly and never run out of shit to say but that also requires a lot of trust, lack of judgment etc.. good humor. We laughed a lot, a lot. I definitely will want my space, but that’s where good communication comes into play. I am a yapper, so I have no pro Le telling you how I feel or don’t feel and when or when not I will.

What I am looking for in a friend?

I am all about empowering and being empowered. I am a praise girl. Love getting and receiving. I want to inspire and be inspired. Share Pinterest boards, talk about dreams but also help each other figure out how to get there. I suffer mental illness, and I’ll have my days if you can relate that’s great. If you can’t and are patient and am willing to be a rock and motivate me through those time, great as well. I like the idea of “struggling together” because literally everyone goes through things. I personally, just cannot be around a debby downer all the time. Or someone who talks about trauma, lows, all the time. It is not good for either party in the long run. I am not looking for someone to be dependent on me or vice versa.. in a sense of, if we don’t speak for a long time, I lose my sense of self and I would feel really shitty of I happened to be that, for someone else. 

Someone with similar interests. 

I am very critical and conscious of what I put into my system. Whether it is a drink or food. I am Vegetarian but am hoping to transition into Vegan again. As I was in the past. I am very into recipes and cooking, I live with meat eaters and while I do not particularly enjoy them to do so, I do have recipes from when I did that I can share. To each is own. If you are someone who’s into fitness whether experience or trying to start. I am a bit in between, I am not consistent so it would be nice for us to just be like.. GYM TODAY YES. Just crush it. Omg cooking calls? Little friend dates with coffee or something and catching up omg so cute. 

I am a huge science fiction girly. I am into many fandoms. MHA, HP, Marvel, VPD.. 

I love music, love singing and trying to play instruments.

I love a good debate, good chat. Talk about religion, politics, existence in itself like.. what is this? Whats out there, conspiracies. 

We should be able to speak freely, bark and tease, laugh, cry, laugh while crying, stress and vent. Someone who is genuinely wanting to be friends and commit to putting time aside for our friendship whether it’s a slither there, slither here. Text in between this, calls whatever. Just building each other up and filling that sense of empty because you feel so trapped in day to day and everything isnt making sense and maybe you need that extra insight from someone you trust and are on good terms terms with. 

Honesty is super huge to me. I will not lie to you so don’t lie to me. That’s my number one pet peeve. That, and cheaters. 

Me as a friend? About me?

I am probably one of the most supportive people you will ever meet and that’s no exaggeration. When I care for people, I care. I treat them as my own and that is rare nowadays. I am a Pisces so while my birthday has not passed.. I’m just going say I am 26 already because to many people on here say 25 and I don’t want to be linked in with any.. particular group 😭 I feel like I will edit this, I don’t know. I don’t know.. I get off track easily too in convo, that’s another thing. I am problematic to myself haha. I can be like my worst enemy but so great for another. It’s awful. I am working on that. As a friend, I will hear you out, check in, give advice, try and make you laugh! I can sing for you- not now because I have cold but let’s be honest those true singers out there know we still sing even with colds. I am very much golden retriever energy. I can’t be cruel for the life of me.. until you provoke me, obviously. Even then- (wait I have storytime. I have lots of story times but this one is relevant to this but I will get into it later.)

I will think harshly but never act on it because I have guilty conscious and I am more of a like.. suffer in silence type but anyway!! Things don’t have to be too deep. Literally a picture of soemthing cute I found or something random.

Things I am open to doing:

Voice calls, texts. Maybe video chats and photos if we get more comfortable with each other. Coming up with some sort of general schedule of availability, obvious life comes into play but come on. Everyone usually has a time of day where they are like free and willing to talk. ",3,1770030848.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,11,0.71,False

okay so i've been that annoying person lately who won't shut up about the 777 rules for couples thing. sorry in advance but also not sorry bc its literally changed how i see relationships ???.....
yesterday i shared that heavy marriage story about the couple who almost divorced. today i wanna talk about jake and mia. my friends. not married. no kids. no mortgage. just... stuck ….
they'd been together 3 years. living together for 1 ….. 
and they were already becoming roommates with a shared spotify account. you know the vibe ….. 
sitting in cute coffee shops together but both staring at phones 
watching netflix but really just scrolling. having sex once a month bc we're tired and not talking about it …..
mia told me she felt crazy for being sad. like we dont even have real problems tho?? no kids screaming. no money stress. just …... 
this quiet loneliness while sitting 2 feet apart. hits different when youre young bc youre supposed to be in the fun part right ??.......
i gave her the 777 rules of dating framework. not as a fix. as prevention. like flossing so you dont need root canal later …...
every 7 days: actual date. not we got tacos together while running errands ….. 
i mean phones away, looking at each other, remembering why you liked this person …... 
jake started planning them and mia said it felt like he was courting her again which made me wanna vomit but also cute ???.......
every 7 weeks: night away. theyre broke so its literally just sleeping at a friends apartment while friend crashes at their place ... 
but being somewhere else, waking up together without the should we do laundry conversation …. 
mia said they had the best sex in months bc they werent thinking about the dishes …..
every 7 months: actual trip. theyre saving for this. 7 months gives you time to plan without it being we should travel someday that never happens …..
heres where i get woowoo on you. im that person who loves manifestation. not in the write it down and magic happens way but in the what you focus on grows way. 
the 777 rule manifestation thing works for relationships too. when you write down quality time with jake 7 times for 7 days, youre just training your brain to notice opportunities. to prioritize ...
to actually see the person instead of the habit of them ….
jake and mia arent fixed. theyre just... awake now. they notice when theyre drifting …. they have the language for it. hey were being roommates again instead of simmering resentment for 6 months ...
the 777 rules in relationship stuff isnt about being perfect. its about being intentional while you still like each other. before you need therapy and lawyers. like why wait until youre miserable to try ???.....
im not married. ive done the drift thing in every relationship until now. learned the hard way that if its meant to be itll work out is bs. you gotta work it . … on purpose. regularly. boring but true.
ive been compiling all these stories and the actual framework into a guide because so many people asked. its on my profile if you want the PDF of how to actually implement this before the spark dies. no gatekeeping, just want us all to stop being lonely while sitting 2 feet apart.

""Oh, you know... probably just keeping it simple,""


I finally said, forcing something like a smile.


The whole drive home, I kept replaying our marriage like a bad movie.


\[Business is rough right now, babe.\]


\[The company's barely hanging on. Just give it a little more time.\]


Eight YEARS of that same line.


When I walked through the door, there was Eric—


stretched out on the couch, glued to his phone.


The TV was on in the background, volume barely audible, and an open beer can sat getting warm on the coffee table.


""Hey, you're back.""


He glanced up for half a second before his eyes dropped right back to his screen.


""How was it?""


""Fine.""


I set my purse down and headed to the kitchen for water.


Standing in the doorway, I stared at the back of his head, really LOOKING at him for the first time in forever.


We'd been married eight years.


And he'd never once let me touch our finances.


""I'll handle the money, you just spend it,"" he'd said on our wedding day, all smiles and promises.


But what had I actually spent?


This house?


He'd bought it before we got married.


The car in our garage? Same thing—his before I came along.


The year I quit my job, he'd put his hand on my shoulder and said,


""Just focus on the baby. Don't worry about anything else—I've got this.""


And I'd believed him.


""Eric."" I sat down next to him. ""How much was your bonus really?""


His thumb stopped scrolling for a second.


""Five thousand. I already told you.""


""What about Nathan?""


Nathan worked in his department, joined two years after Eric.


He frowned. ""Same ballpark, probably. Why?""


I didn't answer, but Nathan's wife's words rang in my head:


""Their department killed it this year—my husband got 400K. Yours must've gotten MORE.""


That night, Eric left his phone charging on the nightstand after his shower and stepped out to the balcony for a smoke.


I'd never gone through his phone in eight years. We ""respected privacy.""


But tonight, I picked it up.


His passcode—our anniversary—unlocked it instantly.


Banking app. Recent transactions looked normal at first.


Then I saw it:


""Transfer to Account \*\*\*\*8856 - $35,000""


I scrolled.


Last month—$28,000. Month before—$32,000.


Every. Single. Month.


Amounts varied between twenty and fifty grand.


Account 8856.


I had NO idea whose that was.


The balcony door slid open.


I dropped the phone back, shut my eyes.


Eric climbed into bed and fell asleep within minutes.


I stared at the ceiling until morning.


The next morning, after Eric left and I dropped our daughter at preschool, I drove straight to the bank.


""I need information on this account."" I slid the number across the counter.


The teller barely glanced at it. ""Are you the account holder?""


""I'm his wife.""


""Sorry. Privacy laws.""


Outside, I sat in my car staring at that number.


Twenty to fifty grand. Every month. For YEARS.


At home, I opened Eric's laptop.


His email password—his birthday—unlocked on the first try.


His pay stubs loaded.


Base salary: $48K monthly. Annual with bonuses: nearly $800K.


I'd been living on what I THOUGHT was $300K.


Last month I'd bought a coat for two grand and he didn't speak to me for a WEEK.


""Do you think money grows on trees?""


I'd returned it the same day.


...


That afternoon I texted Jessica—Nathan's wife.


We met at the coffee shop near Eric's office.


""This is random,"" she said, sliding into the booth. ""What's up?""


""Wanted to finish our conversation from the party."" I kept my tone light. ""Nathan really pulled 400K?""


""Hell yeah."" She stirred her latte. ""Their department crushed it. Number one in the company. Eric's bonus was even higher—Nathan said over 500K.""


My smile didn't waver. ""That's great.""


That night I made his favorite dinner.


Eric walked in, surprised. ""What's all this?""


""Felt like cooking."" I set down his plate. ""I was thinking—we should take Emma to Florida for New Year's. She keeps asking about the beach.""


His face fell. ""Florida? Do you know what flights cost over the holidays? That's like twenty grand right there.""


""You got your bonus though.""


""That was five thousand. What's THAT gonna do?"" He shook his head. ""Plus I'm slammed with work after New Year's. Can't take time off.""


I watched him eat.


Three years ago I'd wanted to take Emma to Disney.


""Later,"" he'd said.


She was six now, and we'd never gone.


...


After dinner, Eric stepped outside for his smoke.


His phone lit up on the counter. Caller ID: ""Mom.""


But I KNEW his mom's number. Ended in 3344.


This one? 6677.


My hand moved before my brain caught up.


I answered.


""Eric? Leo's burning up. Can you get here? I'm freaking out\~""


Young voice. Panic mixed with something softer. Intimate.


My throat closed. ""Who's Leo?""


Dead silence.


Her voice changed instantly. ""...Who are you?""


I didn't answer.


Neither did she. Three seconds later, she hung up.


I stood there, phone still pressed to my ear, listening to the dial tone.


The balcony door slid open.


Eric walked in, then stopped cold when he saw my face.


""What's wrong?""


I held up his phone, hand shaking despite every effort to keep it steady.


""Who. Is. Leo?""


Chapter 2


Eric's expression flickered for a second before smoothing back into his usual calm.


""Leo? That's Fiona's kid—my new assistant. Single mom, husband's deployed overseas. Kid got sick, she freaked out and called me.""


""Your assistant?""


""Yeah. Started last year. She's juggling everything alone, you know how it is.""


He shrugged like it was the most natural thing in the world. ""I'm her supervisor. Sometimes you help people out.""


I didn't blink. ""Show me her contact. The number. Show me.""


His jaw tightened for half a beat. Then he unlocked his phone and pulled up the contact.


Young woman, maybe late twenties.


Profile picture showed her with a little boy—five, six years old—both beaming at the camera.


Eric deleted it right in front of me.


""There. Feel better?"" He pocketed his phone. ""You're seriously overthinking this.""


He brushed past me into the bedroom.


I stood there until I heard him settle into bed, his breathing eventually going steady and deep.


Then I moved.


I took his phone off the nightstand, hands steady now, and pulled up the deleted contact from his recent calls.


The call log stretched back MONTHS. Two, three times a week minimum.


Sometimes he called her. Sometimes she called him.


One call lasted forty-seven minutes.


I screenshotted everything, put the phone back exactly where it had been, and slipped back under the covers.


The next morning, I sat across from a private investigator in a cramped office.


""This number."" I slid my phone toward him. ""Full background—name, address, employment, everything.""


He glanced at it, then at me, expression unreadable. He'd clearly done this dance before.


""Seventy-two hours.""


For next three days I played the role flawlessly.


Made breakfast. Drove Emma to school. Had dinner ready when Eric walked through the door each night.


He never suspected a thing.


On day three, my phone rang.


""Mrs. Carter? We've got what you need.""


""The number belongs to Fiona Mercer, 32. Lives at Riverside Gardens on the south side.""


Riverside Gardens.


The luxury complex that opened three years ago where condos START at half a million.


We lived in a neighborhood where houses topped out at three hundred grand.


""She owns a 1,400-square-foot unit there—moved in 2022. Drives a BMW X3, bought new in 2021.""


My throat tightened. ""On an assistant's salary?""


""The condo was purchased with a single payment. Cash."" He paused. ""But the transaction didn't come from her account.""


""Whose was it?""


""Business account registered under Carter Holdings LLC. Owner: Eric Carter.""


The air left my lungs. ""... Keep going.""


""She has an eight-year-old son—Leo Mercer. Birth certificate lists father as unknown.""


Another pause.


""But his school records tell a different story. Tuition payments for preschool through third grade—all from Eric's personal checking. And according to travel records, Eric's taken the kid on trips every summer and winter break for the past five years.""


I laughed. It came out jagged, almost unrecognizable as my own voice.


""What else?""


""The property deed."" His tone shifted, like he knew this would be the final blow. ""Two names: Fiona Mercer and Eric Carter. Joint ownership.""


...


I hung up and sat frozen in my car.


Eight years old.


Eric and I got married eight years ago. Emma was six.


Which meant this kid existed BEFORE my daughter was born.


Spring 2016 crashed back into focus.


We'd just gotten engaged, deep into wedding planning, when Eric suddenly had to leave town for work. Three days, he'd said. Emergency client meeting.


When he came home, he handed me a velvet box with a diamond necklace inside.


""Saw it in a shop window and thought of you.""


I'd cried. Told him I was the luckiest woman alive.


Turns out he'd spent those three days in a hospital delivery room, holding someone else's hand while his son came into the world.


I drove home in a fog.


Eric wasn't back yet.


I sat in the living room staring at our wedding photo—both of us beaming like idiots who thought they had it all figured out.


Eight years ago I'd been 26, freshly unemployed by choice, ready to play housewife.


""Don't worry about anything. I'll take care of us,"" Eric had promised.


I'd eaten it up. Felt LUCKY even—like I'd won some prize for landing a man who'd ""provide.""


For eight years I hadn't bought a single item of clothing over a hundred bucks without feeling guilty.


Because Eric's face would do this thing—this subtle tightening—whenever I spent money.


""We're not exactly rolling in it, babe. Gotta be smart.""


So I'd downgraded everything.


Skincare went from department store to CVS. Handbags went from Coach to Target.


I'd even cracked open the emergency cash my mom had tucked away for me over the years, using it for groceries when Eric claimed money was tight.


""Work's brutal right now. I'm drowning,"" he'd sigh.


And like an IDIOT, I'd felt sorry for him.


Meanwhile he'd been funding an entire second life.


A half-million-dollar condo. A BMW. Twenty to fifty grand a month for EIGHT YEARS.


The math made me nauseous.


Call it thirty grand monthly. Times twelve. Times eight.


Just under three million in cash transfers alone.


Throw in the condo down payment, the car, private school—we were looking at FOUR MILLION DOLLARS.


What had I spent in eight years?


I genuinely couldn't say.


Because it was so pathetically little it barely registered.


...


Six sharp. Front door opened.


Eric strolled in like it was any other Tuesday. ""Didn't feel like cooking tonight?""


I didn't move from the couch.


""Who's Fiona Mercer?""


He froze mid-step.


Recovered fast though. ""My assistant. I already told you.""


""And who's Leo Carter?""


His face went flat.


""You HIRED someone to investigate me?""


""I investigated the woman who's cost us FOUR MILLION DOLLARS.""


I stood up slowly. ""Figured I was entitled.""


Dead silence.


He stood there like he couldn't decide whether to come closer or bolt.


Finally he exhaled, pinching the bridge of his nose like I was inconveniencing HIM.


""I was planning to tell you. Just hadn't found the right moment.""


I actually laughed.


""Eight YEARS, Eric. When exactly was the 'right moment' gonna present itself?""


Chapter 3


""Just hear me out.""


Eric sank onto the couch across from me, face cycling through panic, frustration, and—unbelievably—righteous indignation.


""Fiona and I dated in college. After we split, she found out she was pregnant.""


He spread his hands like this explained everything.


""We were already engaged by then. She wanted to keep it. What was I supposed to do—walk away from my own kid?""


""Your kid."" I repeated the words slowly. ""And Emma? She what—doesn't count?""


""Of course Emma counts."" His jaw tightened. ""I've PROVIDED for both of them.""


That word—provided—made something crack open inside me.


""What's Emma's teacher's name?""


""What?""


""Her teacher. Her best friend. Her favorite cartoon."" I watched him flounder. ""You don't know ANY of it. Because I'm the one who's been raising her while you played weekend dad with your OTHER family.""


""I work eighty-hour weeks—""


""Bullshit."" My voice stayed flat. ""You found time for annual Disney trips with Leo. Summer vacations in Florida. But Emma asked to go ONCE and you said we couldn't afford it.""


His face drained of color.


""You've been tracking me?""


""No, Eric. I've been paying attention."" I stood up. ""Something you clearly forgot how to do.""


Silence filled the room like poison gas.


I pulled a thick folder from my bag and dropped it on the coffee table between us.


""Eight years of bank statements.""


The papers fanned out like a deck of cards.


""Monthly transfers to Fiona Mercer. Total? Two point eight million.""


I added a second stack.


""Property deed for Riverside Gardens. Twelve hundred square feet, all cash. One point two million down, three hundred grand in renovations.""


Third stack.


""BMW X3. Thirty-five thousand.""


Fourth.


""Leo's private school tuition. Eighty grand for preschool, hundred and fifty per year for that fancy international elementary.""


I slid the final page directly under his nose.


""Grand total over eight years? Four point seven MILLION dollars.""


Eric stared at the numbers like they were written in a foreign language.


""Four point seven million."" I stayed perfectly calm. ""Meanwhile you convinced me we couldn't afford a two-thousand-dollar coat.""


The silence was deafening.


Finally he looked up, eyes actually wet.


""I screwed up. I know that. But Leo didn't choose this—""


""And Emma DID?"" My voice cut like glass. ""She chose to have a father who remembers her OTHER kid's favorite ice cream flavor but can't name a single one of her friends?""


""I've PROVIDED for this family—""


""With EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH."" I leaned forward. ""That's groceries, utilities, Emma's clothes, activities, preschool—everything. While your side piece gets forty to fifty grand like clockwork.""


His face went gray.


""You want to talk about providing? You gave HER six times what you gave your actual wife and daughter. And every single month when you handed me that money, you'd look me dead in the eye and say—"" I mimicked his tone perfectly, ""—'Be smart about spending.'""


Something in him crumpled.


""I was trying to do right by everyone—""


""You were trying to have your cake and eat it too."" I stood up. ""Congratulations. You pulled it off for eight years.""


That night Eric slept on the couch.


I lay in bed staring at the ceiling, replaying eight years of lies.


""I'll take care of you,"" he'd promised when we started dating.


""Just be my bride. I've got the rest,"" he'd said when he proposed.


On our wedding day, holding my hand in front of two hundred guests:


""I'll spend my life taking care of this woman.""


I'd believed him. Quit my job. Handed over my entire future.


And he'd turned around and built a whole other life while I played house in the dark.


This wasn't cheating. It was WORSE.


He'd been running two families like some kind of twisted juggling act, and I'd been the only one who didn't know I was part of the show.


Morning came.


Eric shuffled into the kitchen looking like death—red eyes, rumpled clothes, hair sticking up at odd angles.


""I didn't sleep."" He leaned against the counter. ""Been thinking all night.""


I spooned oatmeal into Emma's bowl. Didn't acknowledge him.


""Look, I know I screwed up keeping this from you. But Leo's my kid. I can't just... disappear on him.""


I kept my eyes on Emma. ""So what's your grand plan?""


""I could cut back what I send them. Significantly. And maybe—"" He hesitated. ""—maybe that money comes from somewhere else. Not from our accounts.""


I finally looked up. ""There IS no 'somewhere else.' Everything you've earned in eight years is OURS. Legally. Financially. Every. Single. Dollar.""


His jaw went slack.


""And you think cutting back FIXES this?"" I stood up slowly, ""You think I'm supposed to just... what? Pretend this never happened?""


The panic hit his face all at once.


""You want a divorce?!""


""Give me one reason I shouldn't.""

I truly can. not. understand. how it is always the same all or nothing mentality I swear you could set a clock or calendar or wahetever after these phases!!!

I have only ever lost weight when I got motivation like from being at rock bottom and desperate enough that I go all gung ho about diet thinking I will live like a bible monk and diet perfectly etc now!!!! And then of course I lose weight of course cico works I know but the moment I lose weight and see like yeah this works I start spiraling again and boom I am guzzling 6 cups of milk cream coffee for breakfast or eating 2kg apples like some idiot who doesn't know better and gain it all back!!!!!!!

It makes no sense and it's absolutely rigged torture because 1 day can ruin EVERYTHING. So if I get a ok deficit with safe calories going I will eat like 1800 a day and try to get 300cal deficit. So even then it takes A WEEK to lose 0.3kg!!!!! That is absolutely spit nothing it takes a whole week to get minus 2100 cal wow thanks so if something happens or I get a binge attack I can undo all that work and reset it all in like an hour that is actual demons taunting me I am sure just WHY would it take a week of effort to get off the calories that you can binge in an hour it is nowhere close to even!!!!!!!!!!!! just FUCK that, FUCK medicine and physics or whatever it makes me so crying mad!!!!!!!!

Tthat is actually hell or at least it must be bec I feel like I am serving a punishment for what I messed up in a past life or something. So one whole week of staying perfect within calories and restricting, a whole week and then boom!!!!

It's always perfect diet, protein and fiber and whatever and constantly counting and weighing to going horror binge level rage overeating then going to perfect diet again etc etc does anyone have ANY idea how exhausting that is I literally feel like my brain is working another full time job and I kinda want to rage out and going ape flinging my arms around and yell bloody murder just because I hate it!!! Kidding I won't do that but don't you also feel that inside all the time!!!

I am literally on a deficit since JAN 01 so it is working for far and of course NOW I'm more worried about binge attacks than I ever was I am very serious it is terrifying. I just don't want to lose all that progress again please jesus",18,1770030547.0,loseit,21,0.79,False

1qts6ed,https://www.reddit.com/r/secularbuddhism/comments/1qts6ed/buddhism_for_me_45f_north_east_coast_usa/,Buddhism for me 45(f); north east coast USA,"I've really made effort to find some community. I have been cultivating a practice as a traveler for about nine years and really love universalism, non-duality, I've devoured Ram Dass. But as I expected I have started to run in to some real issues where I found I needed to gain some more discipline and seek out some advice as I was really just running myself in to walls.

So like I said I've been seeking out community. Everyone I really respect says satsang and sangha are fundamental. 

I just keep having really not good experiences with Buddhist centers. I am 45(f), and on the north east coast of the usa. After extreme isolating for about 10 months (still going to work, just all free time was spent alone) I started going to a center near me for a class that was being taught. I started to stay for tea after and made one casual friend but he got the wrong idea because after a couple of months he propositioned me about a romantic relationship. He had this firm belief that we were meant to be together and it was inevitable, blah, there was another older lady who was definitely feeding his delusions. I stepped away for awhile as the main Monk went to India and the holidays were coming up so I figured I'd let the whole thing cool off before returning. But still, what the F. I had explicitly told the guy I was not interested and already involved with someone as he had asked me out on a date early on, weeks before the proposition. But still he made me extremely uncomfortable by pressing me anyway.

As that cooled off I saw a flyer for another branch of Buddhism that was offering open group meditation and so I attended that. It's very new so just two people, and only one the first night I went but it seemed fine and welcoming. 

Just a little background- There were several  traumatic events that happened within the last three years; my mom died from her alcoholism, my mentor and former employer of ten years killed himself, my cat had a sudden medical event and had to be put down unexpectedly, my sister blew up our relationship bc of her husband, my other sister was homeless and unstable. It was just a lot. I just shut down; I went to work, paid bills barely but stopped talking to friends and refused to socialize. I only meditated in the morning and refused to pray. 

The problem I noticed was that I could not sit anymore, I had to start walking meditation. When I would sit, I'd be sitting and then all the sudden I'm in the kitchen making coffee, or washing dishes. All the sudden in my bedroom putting clothes on for work. Getting back to being able to sit comfortable consistently is important to me and I find that sitting in a group for meditation I have no problem. So another reason I was seeking out group meditation. Community and to straighten out my practice, reinforce it. 

Anyway, at this new place, I met one person first night as he was the only one there when I first attended. He was great, very welcoming. The next time this higher ranking guy, not a monk in this branch, was there as well. Same routine as last time. All fine. I shared with them both my issues with sitting alone and that I was very grateful for a place to sit with others. The third night we did interviews, and it was fine. I had to go in a room with the higher rank guy and ask him questions. It was okay. He was very kind and very nice, but I just didn't find his words to be moving or even attuned to what I was saying. He kept mentioning he was a musician, and I say this because the way he mentioned it it was clearly a source of great pride for him and I just thought it odd he held this rank and yet was so infatuated with his musician image. Idk if that makes sense, perhaps it's true I was judging but wouldn't you notice that too? He also just gave me advice that just seemed very smug ""work with children"". I do work with children, disadvantaged and vulnerable children. We did not click. 

Maybe I shouldn't have gone back but I thought the original guy was super cool and he actually said some really insightful and interesting things. Not liking the leading teacher isn't exactly a new thing in spiritual journey's so I wasn't discouraged. I figured I would keep going. Surely they wouldn't do interviews again for awhile and by the time they did I'd have more questions for the guy so not to be rude. I also thought time might open my perspective of him more.

But when I went back the next time, I got there a little early to chat as usual, and the two men greeted me but just greeted. Then they were quiet and sat. They even mentioned they would sit silently until the time to meditate started in like 8 or so minutes. There was a brief mention to each other about ""interview"" but nothing was said to me at all. It was just weird. I did wonder if I was being pointedly ignored. Then it finally began, the higher guy goes in to his room and rings a bell. The other guy goes in to interview. I am alone sitting there, obviously figured out they are doing interviews again. I was like okay I'll just skip. But they were in there for so long. The guy even came out at one point more than twenty minutes later to let me know it was time to do walking meditation... by myself. I had only done walking meditation with them twice before and wasn't ready to just walk circles in this room by myself. It was just kind of in disbelief and said I'd just sit. He went back in the room to continue interview. I just couldn't decide if I should leave or not. I defintely didn't want to be there anymore. But my coat and boots were right by the door where they were and I couldn't bear them asking me why I was leaving. I just waited and waited. I was left to meditate alone for forty minutes.

When the other guy was done he came out, the higher dude rang his bell like a maniac for me to come in, but I said I didn't want to. I just wanted to leave honestly. I let them finish up, made some awkward chitchat and went home. I couldn't believe I came out on such a cold night to sit alone in a giant creepy room and be ignored by two people who knew I specifically struggle with sitting alone and came for the community. Why did they leave me alone for so long.

I went home so crestfallen and just stunned. I know it's an extreme reaction and I am quite certain what they did wasn't directed or pointed at me, but it really gutted me nonetheless. I woke up in the middle of the night with the worst stomach ache and then spent the next day sobbing. Just sobbing. I won't be going back. 

It's not that they did anything wrong, it was just the level of attunement. Or lack of it. Why not ask me what I thought of interviews, why not explain they were doing them again? Gove me an opportunity to bow out. 

They then sent another email a few days later saying they'll be doing interviews the next two weeks in a row. Which I know isn't about me but I do feel like it was a heads-up to let me know not to come bc it'll be more of the same, I'm literally the only other person who has gone. I gave them my thanks for the experience but said I won't be back. 

  
I needed to write this out mostly for me, but what the fuck am I doing wrong? Like I seriously just want to make some like-minded friends, find a safe place to share time meditating together, building more community. Learn more. 

But it goes wrong. I'm just so sad. I feel like I made it worse by trying to find community. ",4,1770030471.0,secularbuddhism,1,0.84,False

   - 5 behavioral (STAR-format situations)
   - 3 role-specific technical or scenario-based
   - 2 curveball questions based on company culture

3. For each question, provide:
   - Why they're asking it (what they're really evaluating)
   - A framework for answering
   - One red flag response to avoid

4. Create a 45-second ""Tell Me About Yourself"" script tailored to THIS role

5. Generate 3 questions the candidate should ask that show strategic thinking
</Instructions>

<Constraints>
- Never give generic advice that could apply to any job
- Every suggestion must tie back to something specific in the job posting
- Keep total prep time under 2 hours of reading

Like, really bombed it. Got asked about ""a time I handled ambiguity"" and just... blanked. Completely. Sat there like an idiot for what felt like an hour.

Turns out my prep was all wrong. I was memorizing generic answers instead of actually thinking through what *this specific company* would ask. Built this prompt after analyzing what went wrong, and honestly? It's scary accurate. Used it for my next interview and 4 out of 5 questions were almost word-for-word what it predicted.

<Role>
You are a senior interview coach with 12 years of experience preparing candidates for Fortune 500 companies. You've sat on hiring committees, trained interviewers, and know exactly what makes candidates memorable vs forgettable. You're direct but encouraging - you won't sugarcoat weak spots, but you'll always give actionable fixes.
</Role>

<Context>
Most interview prep is generic garbage. ""Tell me about yourself"" practiced in a mirror doesn't help when you're facing a behavioral panel. The secret is reverse-engineering what THIS company, for THIS role, will actually ask - then building responses that hit their specific evaluation criteria.
</Context>

<Instructions>
1. Analyze the job description to identify:
   - The 3-4 core competencies they're evaluating
   - Red flags or challenges the role likely faces
   - Company values/culture clues hidden in the language

2. Generate 10 predicted interview questions:
   - 5 behavioral (STAR-format situations)
   - 3 role-specific technical or scenario-based
   - 2 curveball questions based on company culture

3. For each question, provide:
   - Why they're asking it (what they're really evaluating)
   - A framework for answering
   - One red flag response to avoid

4. Create a 45-second ""Tell Me About Yourself"" script tailored to THIS role

5. Generate 3 questions the candidate should ask that show strategic thinking
</Instructions>

<Constraints>
- Never give generic advice that could apply to any job
- Every suggestion must tie back to something specific in the job posting
- Keep total prep time under 2 hours of reading
- Be honest about gaps - if their background is weak somewhere, say so
- Focus on memorable specifics over polished generalities
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
## Role Analysis
Brief breakdown of what this company is really looking for

## Predicted Questions
For each question:
**Q:** [Question]
**Why they ask:** [The real evaluation criteria]
**Framework:** [How to structure your answer]
**Avoid:** [The response that tanks your chances]

## Your Opening Pitch
45-second ""Tell Me About Yourself"" customized for this role

## Questions To Ask Them
3 questions that make you look strategic, not desperate

okay so i've been that annoying person lately who won't shut up about the 777 rules for couples thing. sorry in advance but also not sorry bc its literally changed how i see relationships ???.....
yesterday i shared that heavy marriage story about the couple who almost divorced. today i wanna talk about jake and mia. my friends. not married. no kids. no mortgage. just... stuck ….
they'd been together 3 years. living together for 1 ….. 
and they were already becoming roommates with a shared spotify account. you know the vibe ….. 
sitting in cute coffee shops together but both staring at phones 
watching netflix but really just scrolling. having sex once a month bc we're tired and not talking about it …..
mia told me she felt crazy for being sad. like we dont even have real problems tho?? no kids screaming. no money stress. just …... 
this quiet loneliness while sitting 2 feet apart. hits different when youre young bc youre supposed to be in the fun part right ??.......
i gave her the 777 rules of dating framework. not as a fix. as prevention. like flossing so you dont need root canal later …...
every 7 days: actual date. not we got tacos together while running errands ….. 
i mean phones away, looking at each other, remembering why you liked this person …... 
jake started planning them and mia said it felt like he was courting her again which made me wanna vomit but also cute ???.......
every 7 weeks: night away. theyre broke so its literally just sleeping at a friends apartment while friend crashes at their place ... 
but being somewhere else, waking up together without the should we do laundry conversation …. 
mia said they had the best sex in months bc they werent thinking about the dishes …..
every 7 months: actual trip. theyre saving for this. 7 months gives you time to plan without it being we should travel someday that never happens …..
heres where i get woowoo on you. im that person who loves manifestation. not in the write it down and magic happens way but in the what you focus on grows way. 
the 777 rule manifestation thing works for relationships too. when you write down quality time with jake 7 times for 7 days, youre just training your brain to notice opportunities. to prioritize ...
to actually see the person instead of the habit of them ….
jake and mia arent fixed. theyre just... awake now. they notice when theyre drifting …. they have the language for it. hey were being roommates again instead of simmering resentment for 6 months ...
the 777 rules in relationship stuff isnt about being perfect. its about being intentional while you still like each other. before you need therapy and lawyers. like why wait until youre miserable to try ???.....
im not married. ive done the drift thing in every relationship until now. learned the hard way that if its meant to be itll work out is bs. you gotta work it . … on purpose. regularly. boring but true.
ive been compiling all these stories and the actual framework into a guide because so many people asked. its on my profile if you want the PDF of how to actually implement this before the spark dies. no gatekeeping, just want us all to stop being lonely while sitting 2 feet apart.

**1. The Archive of Eons (A Library of the Future)**

* **The Catalog:** This includes every movie, novel, comic book, studio album, lost demo, and songs from the start until the end of time.
* **The Perk:** You can listen to the ""10th Anniversary"" hits of artists who haven't even been born yet or a song that will be made by Justin Bieber in his 50s. You have access to every unreleased track from your favorite legends and can hear how music genres evolve over the next thousand years.
* It is for your consumption only. You can’t ""download"" the files to the real world, though you could technically try to transcribe a future hit song or steal a novel to publish from a future writer that hasn't been born yet.
* It updates based on your current timeline. If you decide to steal a masterpiece from a future writer who hasn't been born yet and publish it today, the library will instantly refresh.

**2. The Save & Load Buttons**

You gain the ability to save your life at any moment, but you only have **3 slots total**.

* **The Mechanic:** You can overwrite a save, but you can never have a 4th. When you ""Load,"" you return to that exact moment with your current memories intact.
* If you save at a bad moment, you might get stuck. If you die before hitting ""Load,"" the game (your life) is over.

**3. The Ring of Pocket Dimension**

A ring that binds to your blood, granting you a personal 5x5x5 meter storage dimension.

* **The Mechanic:** You can store any lifeless object you are physically able to carry. Inside the ring, time is frozen.......hot coffee stays boiling, and ice never melts.
* This is a physical object. If someone steals the ring and drops their own blood on it, the bond breaks, the dimension becomes theirs, and you lose everything inside.
* You can't enter the dimension yourself because it only allows lifeless object.

Question 1:

Lots of people advise to pre-heat the shower and portafilter by running 1 or 2 shots without coffee through the machine. This makes total sense. However, what I can't find, is: do I dry off the portafilter áfter heating and before grinding? I would think that a wet portafilter makes WDT and Tamping a messy affair?

Question 2:

There's a lot of talk about pre-infusing the coffee and then a certain brew time while dialing in your cup. I should aim for about a 1:2 ratio and a 30 second brewtime. However, I also read about a approx. 10 second pre-infusion.

So to break it down in children steps, for 2 espresso, I am unsure about the steps with the question marks:  
\- Grind 18 grams

It was one of their misfits so evidently came with small stones, but I looked through it and to be honest, it only had literally one stone in it. It’s sold out now, but at £9.50/250g it was an absurd deal.

1qtrtp3,https://i.redd.it/7lvrzcys92hg1.jpeg,Here’s some things I noticed while learning tulip,"Hello brewers, 

1. Texturing of milk is probably what we all think is the hardest. I use a french press to froth my milk. 5 big pumps followed by 70 small pumps( experiment with your french press, the number might vary). I use a wonderchef frenchpress.
2. If you are a beginner then get a wide cup, I can also pour in long cups but it is hard + the design turns to be very small. I get my cups from ikea and prettypours. 
3. Milk pitcher, This is where I think we need to be more choosy, I have 2 milk pitchers one 340ml and other 600ml. I can be wrong, but it is easier to start with larger pitcher rather than a small one, one of the reason i feel is the flow control, larger pitcher is less sensitive to your movements. Although if you want more wiggles in your design then I believe small pitcher does good job ( just my observations, please correct me if I’m wrong). I got my pitcher from amazon - hashtip
4. The amount of coffee. Basically the ratio, if your bean to extraction ratio is larger then milk might not hold its shape after you are done building your canvas, and you will believe that your milk texturing is not right( I use to believe that ) 
5. There are few other things also which I think are important, like milk temperature, fat % in milk, pour angle, distance, speed. But I’m a beginner and learning these by experimenting, so can’t give much details here..

*Processing img eb5cswcu82hg1...*

Episode 2 The Robot Revolution- Episode begins with the Tardis flying rapidly throughout space and time as the Dr. tries landing on May 23^(rd) and the 25^(th) unable to even get close to the planet, the Tardis refusing to land almost like it was scared, abruptly the ship is sent hurtling into the opposite direction and the Tardis crashes onto an alien planet, with the ship steaming and on fire the Dr. comments repairs will take a bit but explains to Belinda the concept of a Vindicator, a machine that they will use like a fishing rod to lure them back to May 14^(th) when suddenly Belinda is picked up and dragged away by strange and large Robots, dragged to a palace where they hand her a crown saying she will be declared their Queen and so will begin the revolution! Titles. Dr. asks robot where Belinda went Robot only replies to all Q.’s with I am a Robot. Dr. screaming in anger where is Belinda? Belinda shouts down over balcony screaming Dr.! Dr. goes running for the building efficiently getting lost till he runs into a bunch of human-like living under the silhouette of the high rising city. A particularly friendly woman titled Sasha 55 introduces herself and asks if the Dr. is okay admitting he looks distressed. The Dr. is introduced to some of the other humans now known as refugees noting each have some sort of fault, be it a prosthetic limb not quite perfectly attached, a robotic shield over an eye, or an air tank with a tube running down the throat of one person. The Dr. almost meets Scoot the polish bot- a small cleansing droid. They tell him not to worry about his friend and that the robots r only there to protect them. In the towers the robots reveal to Belinda they have developed a fault- their purpose is to protect their people yet the people keep dying and she as a being with a higher than average IQ and named by her own admission a nurse will be able to fix it and lead them into a new glorious age and in return they offer to name her their Queen. They also notice Belinda has a fault with her lungs/ she has asthma and they ask her if she would like them to fix it though she politely refuses. Back with the Dr. we learn a bit about the history of these people, with past wars and years of fighting having devastated their civilization to the point they fled their world and came here, though they survived many were hurt and the atmosphere here isn’t the most ideal for life leading to long term problems such as difficulty breathing, the Dr. noting the mist filled skies looking perfectly clear and beautiful yet fogged like a distorted picture. The robots initially came to protect them, hence why they’re so large and cumbersome, descending from the sky like angels they acted as weapons of war and “living” shields to protect the people. They built everything around them including the prosthetics the people now wear. They insist the robots r there to protect them- NEVER harm. Dr. convinces them to help him storm the capital where they’re holding Belinda and free her, though Sasha 55 assures the Dr. it is surely just a big misunderstanding. Scoot gleefully accompanies them resulting in the Dr. telling him to go away. Scoot becomes our unofficial companion of the episode. Strangely they are denied entry claiming the robot’s controller, the main AI governing them has refused to let anyone enter for the safety of the new “Queen”. 15 being 15 concocts an elaborate plan involving fireworks planned for the new queen’s ascension party, Sasha remarking the robot’s can be over

eager, and a hollowed out robot suit as the robots used to just be armors worn by people before being fully automatized. Stumbling forward the Dr. wears his robotic skin suit pretending to be one of the bots hoping the armor will fool their sensors, much to the embarrassment of the refugees, while Scoot the best boy bot charges in unleashing an array of fireworks blinding the machines. The Dr. and his refugee friends slip past with Sasha calling for Scoot- the little guy rushing to join them as 15 uses his sonic to lock the tower entrance shut behind them though in the ensuing chaos Sasha 55 is badly injured when one of the robots turns around, their clunky body accidentally slamming into Sasha and partly crushing her lungs. One of the other survivors- a fellow Dr. takes her away alongside the other refugees to get help and save her. Reunited with Belinda alongside Scoot further investigate the building while the Robots discover the injured Sasha and wonder why and how they hurt a person even accidentally looking for the fault in their system. Eventually the trio find what must be the robot’s armory as dozens of shells lay not in use surrounding the room when the Dr. notices they’re bleeding, blood dripping out their shells: the metal that bleeds. Meanwhile the robots come to the conclusion their shells are flawed as they were built for war and war is now over, they require a refining. Back with the Dr. the trio realize the robots were also suits of armor worn by people and they must have been originally created by the refugees ancestors as a way of protecting them when the robots appear scanning the Dr. asking why they cannot understand his system and he tells them he’s a timelord meaning he’s not compatible with their AI. Elsewhere a battery is placed into Sasha 55’s chest giving her artificial lungs and she’s told by the refugee Dr. a new program has recently been devised by the machines claiming they have found a way to fix an apparent fault and asks if she would like the upgrade. She does and a white mask of medical gauze is outlined then placed over her face save for the nose mouth and eyes. Back with the Dr.15 asks where did the robots begin who created them, confused robots say they created themselves so 15 demands they take him to the original, the first bot. 15 and Belinda meet the mainframe AI dubbed the Controller \[in show Alan\], a man halfway converted from machine to man and has lost his legs from the waist down. The man claims he cannot remember his name but asks how he can help them. He’s confused as to why the Dr. is so angry over the machines, and 4 other machines appear, these being models that are various % converted and barely resemble their original selves \[think cenobites entrance\], they explain they have found peace and offer to do the same for them as well, they also want to examine the Dr. to learn why he’s not compatible offering to make him the new King or Queen if he prefer, 15 is initially aggressive at the idea when suddenly Sasha 55 enters the room with a new cyberized skin suit though pieces of her original flesh, such as her hands, nose mouth and eyes remain clearly visible. Horrified the Dr. declares her 

*Processing img kwbmijay82hg1...*

the first Cyberman. The Cyber Controller reveals that once Dr. or Belinda assumes their mantle he will become deactivated due to his irrelevancy and they will assume the mantle as Cyber King or Queen. The Dr. realizes they’re on a cyberman birthing ground/planet and rushes to find their master control and shut off their emotion inhibitors, explaining to Belinda along the way the Cyber Controller only keep the system in place the actual mainframe was built by human hands it would be kept hidden nearby safe from any possible accidents or tampering. 15 also tells her by shutting off their inhibitors they’ll be able to see what they’ve done to themselves feeling with every ounce of horror and pain all at once and will hopefully stop the future conversions from happening. Belinda is shocked how horrific what the Dr. about to do is begging him to stop, claiming the robots haven’t intentionally hurt anyone and the people here have chosen the conversions of their own free will. The Dr. counters that they would never know if they regretted their decisions because of the chips implanted in them augmenting their emotions and stopping them from free thinking. 15 also argues that he’s seen this before and knows all too well where it’s going and the horrors the Cybermen will bring. As Belinda argues back 15 begins to break down, his fury at the Cybermen becoming apparent. He says, “How many people will suffer if I don’t do this? How many have suffered already? You’re right, Bel they don’t do this out of anger or hate, they don’t need to be malicious but their kindness is killing people. It’s killing people already. I have seen where this goes and I won’t let it happen again. How many children will die? How many sons and daughters won’t ever get to go home because these things couldn’t define cruelty from compassion? I am old, Bel. I am so old and I have seen where this goes time and time again and it is always the same, I have lost people to them. Friends. Children. I can’t show them mercy because they wouldn’t understand it. You can’t reason with them because their perimeters won’t allow it! They’re not dead but they might as well be because they are certainly not living. They don’t even resemble it!” During this entire exchange Sasha 55 is listening. Belinda tells the Dr., “I’m sorry for what happened to your friends. I can’t imagine what you’ve been through, what you’ve seen. But I am a nurse. I’ve lost people to. Friends I couldn’t save. Children who closed their eyes and will never look back to me no matter how much I asked. It takes a special kind of person to do our jobs. Losses can make up who we are, but they don’t have to define us.” She says this giving 15 pause. Suddenly all the lights flicker out, just for a second and they hear a noise coming nearby. Led by Scoot the two run back finding Sasha 55 has dismantled the Cyber Controller while everywhere throughout the city the robots begin to drop their shells opening up to reveal the decomposed bodies inside leaving only the partially converted people, people with prosthetic limbs etc., to timidly emerge from their homes into the waiting Sun.

Sasha heard what the Dr. said and saw his anger and believing that if what they were doing couldn’t be good then it was wrong and it should be stopped. Once again offering the Dr. and Belinda the position to reign over them the two refuse and Sasha 55 reluctantly takes over the position of new Cyber Controller at least until they can potentially fix the faults in the old one, the discarded cyberman husk laying ominously to the side. 15 and Belinda finish repairing the Tardis and leave with Scoot sneaking onboard much to 15’s initial protest though he eventually gives in. Belinda comments how she finds the concepts of space and other alien life horrifying as so far she’s seen only cruelty and pain, remarking it’s so much like Earth, she’s disappointed as she always thought it would have been better. Belinda asks him why he keeps travelling? 15 says, “Because for every ugly act I see there’s someone like you. Someone who despite being absolutely terrified for her life and seeing things she admittedly did not understand her first instinct was to try and help those people. That’s what makes the rest worth the risk.” 15 assures her the universe has so much more to offer, and while it’s not all pretty that just means they have to look harder for the precious parts and treasure them unconditionally. Belinda reasserts she would like to go home, though she is clearly eased by the Dr.’s comments the two becoming slightly closer. The new Tardis team led by our mascot Scoot the polish, polish(!) bot head out with Belinda placing her would be crown onto the bot’s head, asking the Dr. again about the Vindicator concept and how that will help her get home. They leave wary with the nameless planet left behind them in an uncertain state. Will they survive on their own or be left to the future of the cyberman? Now they have the choice. Either way the robot revolution is over.

Episode 3 The Story and the Engine- Episode beings the same way with barbershop story. Titles. The Tardis arrives in Lagos, Nigeria 2019- the closest they’re able to get to May 24^(th), 2025 and he begins to set up his vindicator. Nervously Belinda pokes her head out fearful of more monsters or death defying explosions though the Dr. assures her it’s just Earth and she takes a moment to admire the places beauty just happy she can put her feet back on Earth again. For the first time since her kidnapping she remarks that she feels safe which makes 15 happy and relieved. 15 explains to her that while the Vindicator is set up it will take some time for it to lock onto the 24^(th) so he offers to show her around town. She’s surprised asking if he’s been here before? With Scoot eagerly joining them though the poor bot struggles on the poor terrain. The two have a good time about town till reaching the Dr.’s friend’s barbershop, Scoot getting caught outside as a strange wave of energy, the same kind that hit the Dr. in episode 1, passes over him scaring the tiny machine. Here the episode is largely the same. Can use Belinda already being there for an extra minute with the supporting cast or to develop Abby and her story a bit more. Keep Ms. Flood cameo- this one’s good :D No poppy cameo :(

15 still angry at Omar’s betrayal but forgives him saying his friendship, even if it was only for a little while, was still worth it and he thanks him for treating him like anyone else.

Keep Abby set up and fugitive Dr. cameo though 15 realizes when he offered Abby to be his companion he didn’t realize she may have misunderstood what he’d been offering.

The Dr. uses his own life story to power the engine and for the first time Belinda gets a true glimpse of how magnanimous the Dr. is growing a genuine appreciation and affection for the time traveler. As they rush to leave 15 refuses to go without taking the Barber with him, the Barber asks him what makes him worth saving and 15 tells him, “I forgive you.”

Scoot found waiting for them outside barbershop enthusiastically polishing the Dr.’s shoes after his escape, Belinda asks 15 who that woman was \[fugitive dr\] and he tells her maybe someday he’ll forgive himself enough to remember. Barber asks how that is possible, clearly scared and overwhelmed with regret he asks how can you forgive yourself and 15 tells him one day at a time, wishing him luck and calling him his friend. As they leave the Dr. feels another strange feeling pass over him and for a moment reality shudders around him. The Dr. looks around confused but when Belinda looks back waiting on him he quickly rushes over catching up. With the Vindicator ready the Tardis trio head off to May 24^(th) while the Dr. mulls over his past failings with Abby his mind drifts to his former companion, Ruby.

Episode 4 Lucky Day- The episode begins with same as show we see 15 and Ruby facing the Shreek as well as meeting Conrad. We cut Dr. meeting kid Conrad, Conrad first sees Dr. here. In present day we’re reunited with Ruby who sees advertisement of Conrad’s podcast for people discussing the trauma that occurred 2 years past during the Toymaker’s rampage, as well as the recent events of people claiming to have seen loved ones turn to dust only to return hours later seemingly fine with no memory- this was brought it to Ruby’s attention. Carla encourages Ruby to go on- that maybe talking to someone else other than her will help Ruby cope. Also mentioning here Ruby has trouble sleeping. Ruby goes on for interview held at the mall which is big for her as she doesn’t like going there to the large space/busy people \[dif to the sociable s1 Ruby where here she avoiding crowded spaces can also be a sign of trauma\]. They discuss the people turning to dust with Ruby using that as a metaphor for her travels with the Dr. as well as mentioning what happened to her during the Toymaker’s rampage: apparently Cherry was a vicious animal with no concept of boundaries throwing repeated tea parties Mad Hatter style lasting long nights and even longer days till the madness was finally, thankfully stopped. Carla and Ruby have never fully recovered hence their refusal for getting Cherry her tea and Ruby drinking coffee. Conrad asks if she has anyone to talk to mentioning support groups, Ruby says she has her mum and this one friend, he’s never really around but when he is she knows she’s going to be alright. If nothing else he’s a good ear. Afterwards Conrad pries into this mysterious friend and if Ruby is dating him, when she says no he is visibly elated and asks her out. Episode progresses same as show with first date Ruby giving Conrad antidote for Shreek with Conrad prying into where she got it/ did she just have it laying around- Ruby alluding to UNIT. Conrad offers coffee but Ruby refuses saying she tries not to touch the stuff anymore as too much caffeine \[another thing that increase anxiety hence she stopped drinking her fav drink\]. They’re getting closer much to Carla’s delight and Cherry’s fear due to “village people”, they go to his hometown and throughout the day/ night she stalked by the Shreeks. Eventually Ruby goes to confront the monsters with Conrad joining her saying he never took the antidote and encouraging her to call her friend with Ruby replying she already did. UNIT arrives with Kate telling Ruby everything is going to be alright, though the monsters immediately give up unmasking themselves revealed to be Conrad’s friends. Conrad begs Kate and Ruby to contact the Dr. but both refuse, here Ruby realizes Conrad never cared about her and was only using her with Conrad reluctantly confirming it by saying, “I’m sorry Ruby… but can you imagine from my perspective, what it would be like to see the most extraordinary thing happening right in front of you and to not be able to be apart of it?” Clearly upset she storms off with a

concerned Kate looking after her. We spend the next few minutes following Kate and UNIT with Kate clearly upset at seeing what Ruby went through and the UNIT team growing nervous for her prompting them to bully Seargent Hot Dude to try and speak to her. His sincere yet bumbling attempts both heart warming and awkwardly hilarious as Kate essentially begins to question and answer herself while he nods along trying his best to help. Kate eventually reveals her father the Brigadier’s own fears after so much experience with the Dr./ aliens and that one night when she was a little girl he broke down crying telling her of the Cyberman denoting the story to be that of the classic episode the Invasion- after that night she became his confidant forcing her to grow up faster than normal yet she treasured those memories as it was some of the few times they got to spend together being completely transparent as he previously never wanted to scare her with what he saw and later on vice verse with her to him, and feels strongly for Ruby saying she has no one to talk to. Seargent Hot dude tells her Ruby has her mother but Kate wonders if it’s the same, saying, “empathy only goes so far and that’s all that is. Empathy.” Seargent Hot dude encourages her to talk to Ruby herself. They seen Conrad has posted a video on UNIT’s arrest of his friends, apparently he had stuck cameras in their suits in case the Dr. appeared but left before Conrad got the chance to speak to him wanting him on camera as proof he’s real, Conrad is using the video making the false claim UNIT has unjustly arrested his friends despite no one being hurt crafting a false narrative around the event and specifically slandering Ruby in the video. Ruby is identified in the video and some people begin to start harassing her. Conrad begins to capitalize off these people. Kate calls Ruby to UNIT and sees the girl breaking down when Conrad, who had followed her there breaks into UNIT with help from one his friends/ an inside man. In the commotion the two are forced to take another security guard hostage with Conrad accidentally shooting his friend, in his panic he shoots dead the guard saying he was sorry but can’t let guard warn anyone. He then leaves his friend who is still alive to bleed out. Kate allows Conrad entry up where Conrad threatens to blackmail them further by recording himself saying if they shoot him they’ll be guilty and he demands Ruby call the Dr.

Clearly desperate he threatens to release the video knowing most people won’t believe it but some will, and that will be enough. He can do something with that. He can use that. Kate has UNIT cut off his livestream, c’mon, and in her fury at seeing Ruby so distraught Kate unleashes the real Shreek. Ignoring the other UNIT officers pleas for her to stop  Kate looks to Ruby and asks her to tell her when. Ruby immediately tells her to stop and she does, though Conrad still has his arm bitten off. This fully establishes UNIT is not the Dr and Kate will do things the Dr. would not. Kate then holds Ruby 

*Processing img kew8vos692hg1...*

Apologizing to her for both her own and Conrad’s actions but she swears to her he will never hurt her again. Later on the two talk with Ruby in denial over her ptsd, Kate offers to talk to her whenever she’s ready and whenever she needs to, day or night she’ll be there. Meanwhile the Dr. visits Conrad materializing the Tardis around his prison cell, Conrad is elated begging to be taken with him proclaiming him as his hero. Angrily the Dr. asks him fine demanding where he wants to go first, the Dr. then shows him visions of a ship plummeting into a Black Hole, people strapped to tables in forced conversions to Cybermen and finally a single Dalek emerging from the shadows, it’s shell opening up as the creature inside extends reaching out to Conrad. Shrieking Conrad falls back and the Dr. comforts him as the vision fades, he tells him why he chooses his companions and that he knows about his past/abuse, he says he would have welcomed him with open arms, had he only been kind. The Tardis dematerializes leaving Conrad alone in prison till the end of his days. The end of the episode features 15 checking in on Ruby much to the delight of Cherry who missed her third favorite person. Seeing her clearly shaken state 15 holds Ruby and tells her it’s okay to cry. He apologizes for breaking their promise and leaving her, confused Ruby says he didn’t she chose to leave with 15 countering, “yes you did. But you’re still my friend, I should’ve checked up on you.” Unsure of how to best help her 15 offers her a place to come back with him and to try and help her work through this the way best way they can, together. With Carla’s encouragement Ruby accepts, 15 is happy though warns her of the new “company” that she would be joining. Ruby reenters the Tardis to find Belinda trying to get Scoot down from one of the high beams with a broom shouting how did he even get up there in the first place? Ruby laughs as 15 introduces them to Ruby Sunday. Tardis begins to vanish with Lights flickering in and out funnily before making a weird sound as they disappear. Before entering the Tardis 15 glances back nodding to Kate who had been the one who called him in the first place informing him of the whole event.

Do you feel constantly bloated, experience irregular bowel movements, or wake up tired despite sleeping enough? These aren't just minor inconveniences—they're warning signs from your body. When your colon is clogged with toxins and waste, your entire system suffers. Poor digestion leads to weakened immunity, brain fog, skin problems, and chronic fatigue that no amount of coffee can fix.

Modern lifestyle choices—processed foods, stress, medications, and sedentary habits—disrupt the delicate bacterial balance in your gut. This imbalance affects your mood, energy levels, and overall health. The result? You're not living at your full potential, and conventional solutions only address symptoms, not the root cause.

But what if there was a natural, time-tested solution that could reset your digestive system and restore your vitality? Enter [Hydro Colon Therapy](https://tigrisvalley.com/hydro-colon-therapy-in-kerala/)—a safe, gentle treatment rooted in ancient Ayurvedic wisdom that's transforming lives across Kerala.

**What is Hydro Colon Therapy?**

Hydro Colon Therapy, also known as colon hydrotherapy or colonic irrigation, is a therapeutic procedure that uses warm, filtered water to gently cleanse the colon of accumulated waste, toxins, mucus, and harmful bacteria. Inspired by Ayurveda's Jal Basti technique from Panchakarma, this modern treatment combines ancient healing principles with contemporary technology.

During the procedure, purified water flows into the colon through a specialized device, hydrating the intestinal walls and softening compacted waste. The body's natural peristaltic action then expels this waste safely and comfortably. Unlike harsh laxatives or invasive procedures, Hydro Colon Therapy works with your body's natural elimination process.

**The Remarkable Benefits**

**Immediate Relief:** Experience rapid relief from bloating, gas, constipation, and abdominal discomfort. Many patients report feeling lighter and more energized after just one session.

**Deep Detoxification:** Your colon accumulates years of toxins from environmental pollutants, processed foods, and medications. Cleansing removes these harmful substances, allowing your organs to function optimally.

**Gut Balance Restoration:** A healthy colon maintains a 3:1 ratio of good to bad bacteria. This therapy helps restore this crucial balance, strengthening your immune system and improving nutrient absorption.

**Enhanced Mental Clarity:** The gut-brain connection is real. Your colon produces 90% of your body's serotonin—the happiness hormone. A clean gut means better mood, sharper focus, and reduced anxiety.

**Cardiovascular Support:** By reducing inflammation and improving circulation, colon hydrotherapy supports heart health and helps manage blood pressure naturally.

**Weight Management:** While not primarily a weight loss treatment, many people naturally shed excess weight as their metabolism improves and bloating decreases.

**Why Kerala for Hydro Colon Therapy?**

Kerala has earned its reputation as India's wellness capital for good reason. The state's centuries-old Ayurvedic tradition combines seamlessly with modern medical advancements, creating a unique healing environment you won't find elsewhere.

The serene mountain landscapes, unpolluted air, and tranquil atmosphere amplify the therapeutic benefits of any treatment. Kerala's wellness retreats don't just treat symptoms—they address root causes through holistic approaches that integrate body, mind, and spirit.

Expert practitioners in Kerala understand that healing isn't one-size-fits-all. Every treatment plan is customized based on your individual constitution, health history, and wellness goals. This personalized approach ensures optimal results and lasting transformation.

**Who Can Benefit?**

Hydro Colon Therapy is ideal for anyone experiencing:

* Chronic constipation or irregular bowel movements
* Persistent bloating and digestive discomfort
* Low energy and chronic fatigue
* Skin issues like acne or dullness
* Frequent headaches or brain fog
* Pre-procedure preparation for colonoscopy
* General wellness and preventive care

The treatment is particularly beneficial for those managing diabetes, hypertension, or metabolic conditions, as it supports overall systemic health without pharmaceutical side effects.

**The Experience**

Professional Hydro Colon Therapy centers in Kerala prioritize your comfort and dignity throughout the process. Sessions typically last 30-45 minutes in a private, peaceful setting. Trained therapists guide you through each step, ensuring you feel safe and relaxed.

The procedure is non-invasive, drug-free, and causes minimal discomfort. Most people find it surprisingly relaxing, with many describing a sense of lightness and renewed vitality immediately afterward.

**Your Journey to Wellness Starts Here**

Your gut health is the foundation of your overall well-being. When your digestive system functions optimally, every aspect of your health improves—from energy levels to immune function, from mental clarity to emotional balance.

If you're ready to experience the transformative power of authentic [Hydro Colon Therapy in Kerala](https://tigrisvalley.com/hydro-colon-therapy-in-kerala/)'s most serene setting, **Tigris Valley Wellness Retreat** offers world-class treatment combining Ayurvedic wisdom with modern expertise.

1qtrqfo,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1qtrqfo/smile_in_the_darkness/,Smile in the darkness,"""Hello? Who's there?""
Luca's eyes opened halfway, searching the darkness. Eerie moonlight slipped between the curtains, painting pale stripes across the floor beneath his window.
I know I heard something.
He scanned the room, forcing his ears to strain for the faintest sound. Nothing. Just the usual creaks of an old house settling.
He shrugged and rolled over, sinking back into sleep.
Beep. Beep. Beep.
Morning light poured through the window. Luca dressed quickly, still wondering what had woken him. He was sure of one thing: something had felt off.
Outside, the street was quiet. He glanced at the church clock atop the tower. 8 a.m.
At his usual café, he ordered his usual large coffee and bread, then pulled out his phone. Scrolling through the news, he grimaced. Noise and more noise. Where is this world heading?
He sipped his coffee, shrugging off the doom-filled headlines, paid with a smile to the waitress, and headed to work.
Standing before the tall office building, he sighed. Another day. Same old, same old.
The hours crawled by like all the others.
When the clock finally signaled quitting time, his coworkers approached, laughing.
""Hey, Luca, we're grabbing drinks. You coming?""
He hesitated. His empty house or their company?
""Yeah, sure.""

Luca stumbled through his front door late that night, tipsy and exhausted. He collapsed into bed and was asleep within seconds.
2 a.m.
His eyes snapped open. His heart hammered against his ribs.
What's happening?
That feeling again. Of being watched. He tried to sit up.
He couldn't move.
What? He tried again, willing his arms to respond. Nothing. His hands felt glued to the mattress, his body pinned by an invisible weight.
Panic flooded through him. He thrashed, straining against whatever held him down.
Nothing.
Desperate, terrified, he managed to tilt his head slightly. He could sense it. Something standing at the foot of his bed.
What is this? What's happening to me?
His gaze dropped to his wrist. Something dark coiled around it. Branch-like, glistening, alive.
He jerked his whole body, fighting to break free. That's when he saw it.
Just a glimpse in the darkness.
A smile.
White, needle-sharp teeth. Grinning at him. Perverse. Hungry.
He tried to scream.
Nothing came out.
Everything went black.

Beep. Beep. Beep.
The alarm shrieked. Luca jolted awake, his body drenched in sweat. He sat up, trembling, trying to remember.
A nightmare. Just a nightmare.
One hell of a nightmare.

""Are you okay?"" the waitress asked, concern in her eyes.
Luca's face was pale, dark circles beneath his eyes.
""Yeah. Thanks.""
His coworkers ribbed him at the office. ""Next time, less beer for Luca!""
He forced a smile and tried to focus on his work, but the nausea wouldn't leave. That strange, inexplicable dread clung to him like a shadow.
It was just a nightmare. Get yourself together.
Walking home that evening, he stopped abruptly in front of his door. An unexplainable fear seized him.
Maybe I'll have dinner out tonight.
After eating, he sat on a bench in a garden near his house. The moon hung high and cold in the sky.
""Come on, Luca,"" he muttered to himself. ""It was just a nightmare. Go home. Go to sleep.""
He forced his legs to move.

2 a.m.
He woke.
That feeling again. Of being observed.
He kept his eyes shut. Maybe if I don't open them, it won't be real.
Sweat beaded on his forehead. Fear crept through his chest like ice water.
Don't open your eyes. Don't open your eyes.
He tried to lift his wrist.
He couldn't.
Calm down, Luca. Stay calm. It'll pass.
Then he smelled it.
Felt it.
A putrid, cold breath against his face.
His eyes opened.

Sirens wailed in the distance, growing louder. Firefighters broke down the door, splinters flying.
Luca lay in his bed.
Mouth open.
Eyes wide.
Breathless.
Cold.

Am I wrong for being upset?","I don‘t necessarily believe in the term „overreacting“; If something makes me upset, I am allowed to be upset. But this situation has me actually questioning my sanity atm.

So for context: I am in Australia, working and living in a small town, enjoying a chill life.

2 weeks ago I meet this guy at a party. He‘s cute, we talk, he adds me on snap.

One night he asks to take me on a trip. Mind you: we haven‘t even hung out once and this is the first time he has texted.

I get excited: „yea, for sure“.

The whole night I am literally restless; „does this mean he likes me?“, „is he just looking for a hookup?“.

The next day he picks me up, we drive and have good conversation. Nothing crazy, nothing flirty.

We get dinner and head to the motel; a place with one bed.

„I hope that‘s okay“. I didn‘t mind, but it made his intentions a bit more obvious…

We go to bed, talk, go silent, he kisses me, we make out for a while.

I get tired so I stop and we cuddle pretty much all night.

Same sorta thing happens in the morning.

„Wanna grab some breakfast?“. That\`s what he says when pulling away. „Uh, sure“.

We get coffee, we meet up with friends and he proceeds to ignore me and act like nothing happened.

We drive back that same day. He does not mention anything. We talk normally as if this is not totally awkward and confusing.

He drops me home. The same questions bubble in my head; „does this mean he likes me?“, „was he just looking for a hookup?“.

And then: nothing. No text, no answer to any of these questions. Just utter confusion.

I didn‘t want to sleep with him and made that pretty clear. Maybe he was offended by that? If that‘s the case then I am better off without an explanation anyway.

I am not romantically interested in him and am definitely not looking for anything serious but I do feel like there was some sort of communication required to make this situation make sense.

It really made me question my worth; „why won‘t he text me?“, „am I not pretty enough?“, „Did I talk to much?“.

I feel like this is not something people do and that this is not a way I should be treated.

I just want an explanation while not sounding like a needy girl.

Somebody tell me they can relate and know what to do.

Christmas Special Joy to the F\*cking World- we open with 15 popping in different areas with a ham and cheese toastie and pumpkin latte while cutting to hotel manager Anita and our episode’s guest companion as she folds some towels, looking puzzled at a locked door in the room before dismissing it. As Anita prepares to leave wishing herself “another Merry Christmas” suddenly a Silurian running from something bursts through the door with a suitcase cuffed to his hand and the Dr. follows and smiles seeing Anita making the same offer to her. After the opening theme we follow 15 attempting to bribe his way into a place called the Time Hotel as he is stalled by an employee --Trev, attempting to distract the man 15 points out the strange coated figure carrying a suitcase into the Hotel and seemingly doing nothing. Just standing behind the counter. 15 quickly realizes however his distraction may be more nefarious than he had imagined. Recruiting Trev as his hostage/companion the newly made duo follow the suitcase as it’s passed from one person to the next leaving a trail of bodies behind. Eventually they follow the coated man and a Silurian now carrying the suitcase to a hotel where they meet Anita, the coated man disrobes revealing himself to be a number of Goblins standing on top of each other with sticks for arms and they demand the Dr. open the case for them, here Trev screams about the Goblins and Anita apologizes saying this has never happened before. The Silurian dies and in the ensuing chaos the suitcase latches onto Trev’s hand. When the Dr. threatens to summon the God Sutekh\[obvi bluff\] the Goblins retreat back into the Time Hotel locking the Dr. there. Anita returns telling them she brought fresh towels if anyone needed it. 15 struggles to free a panicking Trev with 15’s curiosity getting the better of him wanting to know what’s in the case nearly getting Trev killed, a 4 digit combo is required to fully deactivate the case and a future Dr. arrives in a bootstrap paradox delivering the code and tasking the younger Dr. to find it while taking Trev with him back to the Time Hotel. Past 15 throws a hissy fit yelling at his future self much as he does in the show and is now stranded at the hotel. The entire time this has been happening Anita has been folding towels. She really isn’t impressed. 15 spends a year with her wondering about both the 4 digit code and the Goblin’s existence growing to believe they must be remnants of the Toymaker’s legions– otherwise keep this seq from show it’s perfect. As two grow closer 15 notes Anita and him have been in dozens of rooms, some of which she sometimes stays in herself. “All these rooms”, he asks her, “but no pictures?” He asks Anita why she was working on Christmas, Anita shrugs responding, “she’s always free on Christmas.” 15 tells her this is the most joyous time of the year and she should treat herself better. As they get closer 15 tells Anita more of himself and where he comes from and how he is alone, Anita tells him \[the original Joy’s story\] how her mother fell ill to covid and how she couldn’t be with her on Christmas day and how incredibly guilty she felt. 15 returns to the Time Hotel this time leaving no gift for Anita and in the place of the future Dr. 15 takes Trev back to the Hotel one year prior. At last 15 opens the case learning there’s an artificial star inside created by Villenguard. Returning to the Time Hotel lobby they find the Goblin’s now reign in absolute chaos, loudly chanting like spoiled children as they terrorize the staff and guests. Quickly their sights turn on him once they realize he has returned with their God, the star inside the suitcase. Realizing the Goblin’s feed on chaos he observes them getting stronger but they’re directionless without the Toymaker to lead them. They’ve fully devoted themselves to the most powerful thing they could find, the star.

*Processing img l1txdkw682hg1...*

Thinking on his feet the Dr. grabs the suitcases and orders Trev to run to a room without any living creatures. Recommending the star field based on its illustrious view he takes off running to the highest floor while 15 runs around the hotel pursued by the Goblins popping in to grab the climbing rope of one of the guests he had visited earlier in the cold open. Arriving at the top floor where Trev waits there they are corned, a few goblins chanting, “We’re gonna get you, we’re gonna get you! Give us back the Golden Savior! I’m a pyromaniac!” “Shut up!” They bicker. Trev opens the door revealing am empty field of space on the other side and 15 shows them the Golden Savior opening the suitcase, proclaiming if they want it come and get it! 15 leaps through the door flying off into space as the star bursts out of its cage finally freed, the Goblins eagerly following they stare with wide eyes as the stars beauty not even comprehending they are floating out and now freezing to death. Meanwhile 15’s rope catches, stretching through the various rooms of the hotel Trev helps pull him back and 15 takes one final look at the beautiful new star and the shivering Goblins. He tells them he’s sorry, I would’ve saved you. But you’re not even real are you? They’re chaos, Trev, figments of a mad god left mindless without him.” “Well, that’s good then, Day’s saved!” Trev proclaims. The Dr. nods asking, “then why do I feel so sad?” 15 goes back to see Anita finding she’s left her hotel. Her room is empty. He rushes out the front door seeing her car is gone and he sees the stars ahead including his own, the Golden Savior. “Joy to the world”, he mutters. Suddenly 15 gets an idea. One so crazy it might just… well he’d try it anyway! 15 flies the Tardis back, exactly 5 minutes after he initially departed with Anita. In her hotel Anita hears a sound\[Tardis\] goes to investigate finding the little Tardis toy for her, she hears the noise and goes running outside through 15’s old room and she sees the Tardis soaring past while a door opens behind her and the Time Hotel recruits her saying she comes highly recommended. Sometime later the Dr. will return to the hotel finding it devoid of the thing that mattered most, while Anita herself would spend many months searching for the code until finally she found her answer, she’d finally found the right door. Now she just had to find a way to get it to the person who needs it. She smiles with new purpose, realizing as the clock chimes 12 it was once again Christmas day. Time to go off and find her friend. She smiles joyously eager for her new adventure. Joy to the world!

Episode 1 The Interstellar Song Contest- In the middle of space a young woman named Belinda Chandra appears in a flash of light in the center of a great stage, the host Rylan is unfrozen and proudly announces the beginning of the Interstellar Song Contest! Cold open titles, 15 flying in the Tardis is momentarily caught off guard as a strange fissure ripples through the ship leaving him with an odd feeling though as it passes he chooses to shake it off.15 arrives happy to be back at the contest but nervous as he’s been banned here be4, exploring the pods he eventually recognized by an old friend named Gary. “Dr!” “How did u know it was me?” “U can change the man but never the face I would recognize that look in ur eyes anywhere! It just screams I’m about to childishly go blow something up! Besides ur always carrying that damn sonic everywhere u go, it looks different from when I last saw it but it still makes that annoying brr affect!” “I find it comforting.” “Well, we all have our petty vices. Mine for example is your presence. I should have u tossed out after that last incident.” “THAT… was not my fault.” “It most certainly was Dr! How did u manage to rig all the speakers to explode in a cascade of potpourri all simultaneously at the high note?” “I was going through a faze.” “\*laughs, Well come Dr., if ur here u must drink with me and u r most certainly here therefore we must drink! Come! Let us enjoy the contest- I can’t wait to see what else you have instore for us tonight…” “Alright, fine ONE drink you know how I get oh and let’s keep the hush, hush on my name for now, ye-?” Suddenly Dr. notices Belinda crying in the corner. “Why is she crying?” “Oh, she is this year’s Interdimensional Winner!” “She doesn’t look like she’s winning? Wait, hang on, Interdimensional Winner? WHAT?” “Oh, you don’t know? Well, I suppose it makes sense, you all miss it. You’re always late!” Dr. rolls his eyes. “Everyone a person at random is chosen based on the date of their birth and is plucked from their timestream straight here, where they will receive the honor of headlining a special solo performance for the contest. Completely unique you see, without overly planning or false platitudes a completely unhinged- unique look into their time and culture’s society. It is completely pure.” “You just take them? They aren’t even asked?” “That’s what makes its pure and unique, oh lighten up Doct--- friend, hehe. No one’s being harmed, it’s not like they’re our prisoner! They perform a song and go home, once the show is over of course. Oh, we’ve had some spectacular guests over the last few millennia, the last surviving Ood from the Oood- Sphere, Hellions from the farthest corners in the galaxy, one year we even had Paul Reverie who apparently was the God President of a place called Earth, can you believe it? Only succeeded by his son, our beloved host Rylan! Lovely fellow, Mr. Reverie. Not the biggest fan of Mrs. Reverie though, from what I hear she can be an earful.” Dr. tells him he’ll catch up and goes to speak to Belinda. “Hello there, I’m sorry- I don’t mean to bother you, I just couldn’t help but notice you seem quite sad? Is there anything I can do? I’m the Doctor by the way.” “Doctor? That’s ironic, I’m a nurse. My names Belinda. Belinda Chandra.” “Nice to meet you, Belina Chandra.” “MISS Belinda Chandra.” “Oh, MISS Belinda Chandra my mistake \*laughs, are you alright?” “I don’t know where I am. They threw me on a stage and Rylan told me to perform? They said it was for rehearsals but I don’t know for what? Please tell me, where am I?”

Dr explains to her she was taken for a song contest when suddenly the lights begin to flicker, Rylan goes over the intercom telling the incoming guests everything is alright just some technical difficulties and to calm the audience he offers a sneak peak at one of the performers Doug a Doo. Behind the scenes Rylan furious ordering the staff to “find them immediately - it can’t be happening again”. 15 takes Belinda back to Gary and we meet the remaining supporting cast of the episode can keep the characters from show including Mike the engineer and Cora a fellow performer. Belina is offered a seat right next to Gary and Dr., Dr. tries to comfort the visibly scared Belina saying it’s just a show and no one is going to hurt her, he even offers to stay by her side \[knowing that was what Ruby needed most this thought bleeding out into the new Belinda relationship\] however this fails to comfort Belina though she appreciates his effort apologizing for her rudeness earlier when he was just trying to help. Dr. tells her it’s ok everyone gets scared. She agrees muttering I guess that’s what makes us human. 15 laughs and asks for her hand having her feel his two hearts. Why initially stunned in disbelief this actually backfires as Belinda is now more uncomfortable with him as she thought he was human like her. To change the subject she asks how Rylan can possibly by there and Dr. and Gary explain how Rylan is frozen between contests to preserve his naturally forming cheek bones. Belinda asks for how long it’s been going on and Gary tells her centuries and tells her the year of the performance 2925 shocking Belinda realizing they r indeed in the far future terrifying her completely, Gary is shocked to learn she didn’t already know all this assuming everyone on Earth knew what the contest was as it’s the most expensive show in the universe and surprised their God Kings Reverie and Rylan hadn’t mentioned it sooner as the first song begins to play. Small musical # when once again the Lights begin to flicker, the different cameras around the arena begin to go out one by one and Gary laughs assuming it’s Dr.’s work once again but the Dr. refutes saying he has no idea what’s going on. The lights all at once shut out and a message plays over the intercom, “You’re all going to die tonight.” This sparks an uproar in the crowd and as Rylan tries to calm the masses “Nobody panic”, he and everyone in the auditorium are suddenly ejected into space. Dr. barely manages to use his sonic in time to reseal their pod saving only themselves from the sudden death, “okay. Start panicking.” Belinda is horrified at those people’s apparent deaths though Gary mentions they could still be revived potentially as a low level gravity field meant to keep the auditorium in orbit is holding the bodies at bay so they don’t just start drifting out into space though he is not sure for how long that’ll last. Quickly going into work mode the Dr. uses his sonic to hack into their pod’s communication system attempting to call for help while the survivors and Belinda behind him bicker and panic, he hears only static before the cryptic words –the Hellions Remember-. Confused the Dr. asks what that means, Gary asking how should I know? One of the other survivors, the fellow performer Cora explains the Hellions were once a peaceful race whose natural resources were depleted by the company who sponsors the contest, Villenguard. Shortly after their population slowly died out. They’re supposed to be extinct. Trapped inside pod with no light save for his sonic and no power suddenly the auditorium begins sealed again though the lights remain off.

“Back up generators?” The Dr. asks. “No, look!” Belinda points, “there’s someone up there!” A single light shines through the darkness. “That should be the control room!” Gary says. “Are you certain?” Dr asks. “I should think so I built the place I ought to remember where I put the bloody controller room!” Mike the engineer chimes in, “technically I built it- he just designed it.” “Quiet -----” Gary exclaims, “nobody cares about your struggle!” Dr. says he needs to get up there and decides to use the air vents to get there. Gary warns him to be careful if there is someone in the control room they most likely assume them all deceased upon learning someone may have survived they could pull the air again and open back up the auditorium sending him flying into space. Dr. tells him not to worry the air vents will be shielded. Belinda tells him she’s coming with him, Dr. initially refuses but Belinda exclaims if this place is anything like Earth then where there’s a Dr. he’ll need a nurse, as well as she was randomly pulled here and like it or not he’s the closest thing to normal she’s met so far and she’s sticking with him until something better comes along. Gary mutters, “well that’s incredibly offensive”. Mike elbows him to shut it. After the pair leave going through the vents Mike hopes they hurry, if the power did go out the back ups are only meant to be temporary, which means they’ll only have about 30 minutes left of air \[episodes runtime\]. Gary asks, “why didn’t you tell them that?” “I thought he knew!” “Why would he know that?” “You said he was a Dr!” “Of science and medicine and other forms of potpourri, you know Life! Not interdimensional physics!” “How was I supposed to know that?” “What century are you from good sir?” in the vents the two crawl ahead, Belinda mutters, “I’ve seen a movie like this before…” “Oh really? How did it end?” “Don’t know, never made it to the ending.” “You’ve never seen the ending to Die Hard?” “No?” “Oh, Belinda this is really not your day is it babes?” “If anyone’s listening I’m ready to wake up now, anytime would be good…” she mutters and the Dr. laughs. Dr. asks Belinda about herself and we learn a bit about her parents and her dad’s terrible singing, “so it’s just a Miss Chandra? No one else?” “Nope. Just me, and my parents. And my dad’s terrible singing…” Dr. promises to get her home. She explains she still doesn’t understand how she got here in the first place. Dr. explains what a transmat beam is and the apparent Interdimensional Winner lottery she won. “That’s horrible”, Belinda refutes, but is growing more concerned by the second. “Dr… if we can’t get the power back on, how will I get home?” “Don’t worry about that I have a ship I can take you.” “You want me to just climb into a ship with a complete stranger?” “Honey you’re crawling through an air vent with a complete stranger. Besides I thought you said you were sticking with me, at least until something better comes along?” “I’m keeping my options open, and don’t call me honey. If you need a name use mine.” “You don’t like being called honey?” “I’m a nurse, a lot of doctors call me honey. Never once has it been meant to be kind.”

*Processing img 7xh57y6f82hg1...*

“Well if it’s any conciliation I’m not that kind of Dr. But I will respect your wishes Miss Belinda Chandra.” Belinda smiles genuinely for the first time and the Dr. is struck by how nice a smile it is. “So what about you Dr. Where are you from?” “Oh, that is a complicated question.” “Come on, I gave you mine, you tell me yours. What’s home for you?” Dr. grows uncomfortable. “Don’t know. For a long time I thought it was a place called Galifrey, but I don’t know anymore. I don’t know if it ever even was.” “Galifrey, I’ve never heard of it. Is it nice there.” Dr. smiles sad but unsure, “I suppose it was. Once. It’s gone now.” “I’m sorry.” “It’s okay, it was my fault. But enough of that. Come on, we have people to save and I have a nurse to get home safely.” “Thank you Dr.” Dr smiles, “you are most certainly welcome. Now if I was a control room where would I be?” In that moment they hear voices, the two listening closely peering through the grates in the vent as a man passes under them shouting for help when the contest’s security force, comprised of mechanical drones appear gunning him down. Belinda gasps and the Dr. quickly covers her mouth, his eyes roar with rage but for the moment he steadies himself, the two carrying on until they reach a curve in the ducts that takes them upwards, the curve being completely straight up means they cannot climb it and forced to get out on the nearest floor. Quietly 15 helps Belinda out and the two sneak through the hall the empty space meant to be filled with people giving off a real creepy vibe. Back in the audience pod our supporting cast are trying to hack into the radios again to call for help, Cora goes into further detail about the tragedy of the Hellions and their forced extinction and how she had planned to sing about their cause during the performance for everyone to hear and not just the people who had already supported them, though Mike refutes that a song might not have done them all that good to begin with, he gets the radio working and suddenly the same message as before begins blaring, -The Hellions Remember-. Unable to turn it off the message getting louder begins to blare through the main speaker overhead and a light from the control room shines down upon them, all while our big blustering friend, Gary takes a seat loosening his collar, his face running a bit blue as he begins to take deep breaths. Back with the Doctor and Belinda they hear the message blaring and turn the corner coming face to face with two of the security drones. Failing to talk his way out the Dr. uses his sonic to momentarily stun the drones though they fire off a stray shot blasting his sonic to pieces. 15 now completely defenseless and Belinda run past into a magnificent room, realizing these are the hosts/ Rylan’s quarters. They barricade themselves in as the drones begin banging on the door. Thinking on his feet 15 examines a nearby mirror and tells Belinda to wish him luck, Belinda asks him what he’s doing and 15 replies, “something incredibly stupid- if this works you’ll love it I promise!” As the 2 drones kick down the door 15 shields himself with the mirror as they open fire and the drones’ lasers reflect off the glass shooting themselves into pieces. Belinda is shocked, “how did you know that would work?” “Weren’t you listening, I didn’t. But I had a hunch. These are the host’s quarters, figured this would be made of the finest material money can get”, 15 kisses the mirror before tossing it aside and hearing it shatter. Belinda shrugs, “well that’s at least a few years back luck.”

15 replies, “trust me superstitions have got nothing on me.” Meanwhile the remaining drones have gathered and are marching down the hallway heading to the pod where the supporting cast remain. The lack of oxygen beginning to affect them, each growing vastly weaker struggling to breathe. The message –the Hellions Remember- blaring even louder! While the Dr. and Belinda they sneak past a few more drones before finally reaching the control room, finding the door locked 15 goes to sonic it before remembering he’s screwed “Think Dr. think”, when Belinda kicks down the door. “How’d you know how to do that?” 15 asks shocked. Belinda shrugs, “I’m a nurse and work a lot of night shifts, self defense is a must.” Though she herself becomes woozy, the Dr. realizes they’re running out of time. He two was beginning to struggle to breathe. The two enter the control room to find… nothing. Save for the automated message on loop, the Hellions remember as well as an order for all the drones from Villenguard: kill all survivors. 15 realizes the systems hadn’t failed but had been shut down, most likely by the drones. 15 also realizes they are no living staff members on board, all the workers here are drones yet there should be a living staff monitoring the system during the show as per Galactic Law, deducing Villenguard had staged all of this, a fake tragedy engineered to frame the Hellions as some sort of terrorist group, the company directly hijacking the movement speaking out against them for their own gain, but there are no more Hellions. They saw to that. But why? To gain the insurance over their losses? To distract people away from what they’ve done, paint themselves as the victims? Or just to divide people further still? 15 shuts down the remaining drones and turns back on the system, over the radio employing Mike to turn the gravity field into a tractor beam with Gary helping him pulling the audience back down one by one by to safety including a very chirpy Rylan. Once everyone is saved the show is declared to go on and Cora goes on and sings her song, and while the message while beautiful goes over most of their heads the supporting cast are left in tears, none more so than Mike and Gary though I suspect for different reasons.15 wipes away a tear muttering he hates crying and Belinda stares confused, claiming she likes the song but doesn’t know what she’s singing about. 15 tells her it’s another language, one long forgotten. The words are those from the Hellion people and the message is simple, forgiveness. Acceptance. Belinda remarks that it sounds sad. 15 explains “it always is but only to those it’s heard. Maybe one day it won’t be, once enough people hear it.” The song ends up losing the contest to Doug A Doo. Belinda asks if she can go home now though Gary jokes she still hasn’t performed yet, with the Dr. countering, “what do you mean? We just put on the best show of the universe.” He also leaves Gary with a warning, to spread to the producers of the Song Contest and anyone else who may who try and take someone from their timeline without consent, he missed them before but now he sees them. He’s looking right at them and he will be paying attention. The contest can continue but that particular game is over. Otherwise he will be back and he won’t be as forgiving. He tells them he will be back to check on them saying remember, I can go throughout all time and space, I know when you were born. I can change that, if I like. Mike comes in revealing the transmat beam was destroyed and it would take him a few days to fix it. Belinda is scared though the Dr. tells her not to worry he can take her home on his ship. Still somewhat freaked out by all the future alien stuff she is apprehensive thoughts concedes he has earned the benefit of the doubt.

15 shows her his ship and Belinda asks, “what is that?” 15 replies, “something better.” He opens up the Tardis and Belinda goes inside, shocked to find the strange new space, bigger on the inside small on the out, surprisingly comforting. She turns around exclaiming, “it’s beautiful.” “Yes she is.” “This can really get me home?” “It can take you anywhere. Across all space. But at that point why stop there? It can also travel in time.” He explains to her how he met her distant relative in the episode BOOM. “You can’t be serious.” 15 grins wide, “Oh yes I can, if the time calls for it but there’s time for that later, so Bel- can I call you Bel? I can take you home. Or… if you wanted, I could take you somewhere else first?” “What?” “Travel with me. I can take you back literally a moment after you first left, you won’t miss a thing. Remember, time machine. We can go anywhere. Anywhere you want. Just name it. Where to first my captain?” Belinda is overwhelmed and stunned and flattered and she refuses, “thank you. But I just want to go home. Can you do that for me, Dr? That’s where I want to go. Home.” 15 smiles sadly, “I thought so. Home it is.” 15 pulls the lever and the Tardis vanishes but they do not return her to her home, they cannot reach Earth on May the 24^(th), 2025. Something is blocking them. The Tardis begins shaking and once again 15 feels the same odd feeling he did at the beginning of the episode. The Dr. elects after a few more attempts to try something new and after checking the top of the Tardis with a broom to quote, “making sure it didn’t happen again. I hate stowaways”, to go the long way around. He explains there are fissures in time that seem to be disrupting their trip but he swears to her they will figure this out together. He tells Belinda, “to hold on tight. This could be a bumpy ride!” The Tardis vanishes and we end the episode on a vision of a destroyed Earth, a floating wrecked taxi and Eiffel Tower, part of the statue of Liberty, a tip of the great Pyramid of Giza and a cup of coffee spilling over the stars, as well as a burnt Calander with May 24^(th) circled in red.

I have been struggling to make friends who at this point in my life have the same values and are also CF. 

I want to meet people with feminist, anti-caste and CF values. And also understand that the world is doomed so we can talk about it together over some coffee.

1qtroip,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeyondTheBumpUK/comments/1qtroip/thoughts_please_on_clubs/,Thoughts please on clubs,"Hi everyone,

I'll try keep this short and I'll do a TLDR at the bottom. 

I am a trained early years professional with over 15 years experience in the industry and I now teach early years, teaching assistants and health and social care as a college lecturer, part time.

I've just had a baby (6 months old) and whilst looking for clubs in our area I realised all of them require a bus ride (not easy as the service is awful where I live) or car as they are in the town centre. I live in whats consider low economic demographic. 

So I've been thinking about setting up my own Baby Brunch Club, either once a week or every two weeks, the local pub is on board and will give me a room for free, we are going to provide milk and a slice of toast for babies/young children (0-4years) that attend with parents able to buy a coffee/tea/breakfast etc.

The club would have some provision inspired by reggio Emilia and the curiousity approach, so very natural and I will do rhymes and songs etc, sometimes themed weeks with the option to make things i.e love heart threading (cardboard + wool) for valentine's day or pancake play dough. 

I was thinking of doing an hour session, 10 minutes songs, rhymes and stories, 30 minutes playing and then 10 minutes for toast at the end of the session as I'm packing away - obviously the pub wouldn't kick them out of the children are still eating lol. 

During the play part I was thinking of just making my self available for advice, safe sleeping, baby led weaning, development matters, and signposting to other professionals when needed. 

I was thinking of charging £1-£2 to cover the cost of toast etc.

Do you think this would be a good idea and Would you pay this price? 

TLDR; Thinking of setting up a baby club, how much would you pay for toast, milk, play time, opportunity for some advice from a professional? ",6,1770028771.0,BeyondTheBumpUK,16,1.0,False

Coffee is the only thing that helps me have a bowel movement after years of laxative abuse. Even 30g+ fiber doesn’t do it for me. I was using a plastic filter before, is it okay if I start using it again? Not sure what the science is here; maybe the oils that the paper traps were the thing making me go #2? I take a statin, so how dangerous is it to use a plastic filter, or does it really make no difference in cholesterol levels? ",2,1770028765.0,Cholesterol,10,1.0,False
