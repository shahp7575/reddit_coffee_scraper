1h033dr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hashimotos/comments/1h033dr/internal_temperature_regulation_messed_up/,Internal temperature regulation messed up,"(Long post) Just wondering how many others are like this. 

Even with an optimal thyroid level (probably more optimal than what the average doctor thinks) it‚Äôs hard for me to regulate internal temperature. It takes a lot longer to adjust versus other people, I know.

So a good part of the day I am either too hot or too cold on depending what temps I was exposed to, HOURS ago, not minutes ago.

Example:on a hot summer day it‚Äôs still hard for me to cool down once I‚Äôm in cool AC. 

Now that it‚Äôs pretty much winter, it‚Äôs hard for me to warm up once I‚Äôve got internally cold from being outside. Living in the frozen north, this will be a problem until May.

I‚Äôve had Hashimoto probably my whole life. When I was a kid I would get shivers That would last five minutes along. At least that doesn‚Äôt happen anymore.

So I spend a good part of the evening in cold weather when I get home just trying to warm up. Energy isn‚Äôt cheap but the only way to fix it seems to be the crank up the thermostat higher than what I would like for at least 2-3 hours. Since I try to live frugally, I usually choose to be cold instead, which sucks.

I can‚Äôt drink warm coffee at night . Herbal teas just really aren‚Äôt my thing. Alcohol is bad for my blood sugar. I was mixing that powdered chicken bouillon, the microwaved water for a while, but I‚Äôm getting sick of that!!

I‚Äôm assuming most of you are like this ? 
Yes, no ?

These past few years have been a series of one terrible situation after another. It all started when I was canvassing. I got good at it, and people seemed to like me for once. However, it was a highly unprofessional environment where people casually talked about dildos, their hot corporate bosses, etc. So, I was shocked when someone I thought was my friend demoted me for playing ‚ÄúMarry, Kill, Fuck.‚Äù During my first write-up, I was told it wouldn‚Äôt be shared with my boss‚Äîyet it was. We eventually talked, and she apologized, but to this day, I have no idea why it happened.

Years ago, I had a falling out with a friend group but stayed in touch with two people. One came back and apologized two years ago. Now, the same friend who dropped me initially has reconnected with another member of the group and ghosted me again.

I fell in love for the first time, only to find out it was all a manipulation game. He wasn‚Äôt in love with me‚Äîhe was addicted to the thrill of infatuation. He was my mentor and pushed me into my dream career, which ended in burnout. All of my contacts were through him. Later, I discovered how much he lied about, and I have no idea what he may have said about me to others.

Around this time, my closest friend (who got me a part-time job) and I had a ridiculous fight. I can‚Äôt even remember what initially hurt my feelings, but she never apologized. She promised we‚Äôd talk after she had space, but months passed without a resolution. I ended up apologizing. When she offered to finally talk she refused to discuss the issue only how this would affect our work. I told her it wasn‚Äôt necessary anymore, but I felt like she had dropped me as a friend. She responded with a list of grievances I‚Äôd never heard before, asked me to respect her boundaries, and told me never to text her again. Now, even though we still work together, she always makes snide remarks no matter how polite I try to be.

I joined a film networking group but messed that up, too. I was mid-burnout, recovering from the most traumatic breakup and a friend breakup, all while unknowingly dealing with two learning disabilities and a developmental condition and a chronic illness. I worked hard on one assistant editing job, thinking I did well. I then made a trailer for the director, but after months of effort (unpaid), I found out they didn‚Äôt use it. I only learned this when I called them, ashamed a month later.

My therapist of four years told me she suspected I was autistic but left me with no resources before leaving her practice. Then I met someone through the networking group who would give me last-minute jobs using unfamiliar software. One day, she asked me to quit my job and work for her full-time, only to call a day later and fire me because i wasn't picking up the job fast enough. I wish this was an exaggeration, but it‚Äôs not.

This year, I was diagnosed with a chronic illness, making consistency nearly impossible. Financially and emotionally, it‚Äôs been a vulnerable time. My feelings about my closest friend have also come to a head‚Äîshe‚Äôs never been able to make it to my birthday but always made it to my ex-friends‚Äô events. During the holidays (a sensitive time for me as I only have my sister, since the rest of my family ostracized me for speaking out about abuse), she invited my ex-friend to events but excluded me. I‚Äôve swallowed my feelings for years about this ex-friend, but it‚Äôs exhausting. This ex-friend once mocked my cup design at a wedding.

Another painful incident: at a child‚Äôs birthday party, the kid of a producer I wanted to work with was asking me to play I didn't notice for a while and, when I did, I told the child I didn't want to play. I later noticed dirty looks from the producer and their spouse, and my sister confirmed it wasn‚Äôt just in my head. That producer follows all my mutuals back on social media but, not me.

Someone tried to scam me on a freelancing site, and I posted about it on Reddit to warn others. The scammers retaliated by posting my name, website, and location online. Now, when you Google my name, that‚Äôs the first thing you see.

I got kicked out and blocked from my facebook chronic illness group, literally have no idea why.

Lastly, a coffee shop I loved, which is community-focused, followed me on Instagram but later unfollowed me after I reached out about a job posting. They left me on ‚Äúread,‚Äù and now I feel paranoid about attending their events. It feels personal, though I know it sounds irrational.

I‚Äôm struggling so much in a town where everyone seems connected, and I feel like people know things about me that I don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs terrifying. I constantly feel like I‚Äôm doing everything wrong, and I need to survive financially‚Äîbut how can I when it feels like people don‚Äôt like me? I've seen erratic, awful people have community and friends. I get treated like trash despite my efforts to make things right. Somehow, it‚Äôs never enough.

I've tried medication, therapy, and reaching out. I want this to all be in my head...

1h02vvf,https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/1h02vvf/starting_my_lifelong_dream_project/,Starting my lifelong dream project,"Just sharing the start of a lifelong dream project. I had always loved photography and started out with a Nikon FM2 many years ago. I remember since I was 16 I would always be fascinated by coffee table books and the amazing pictures some of them had....the way the photographer told a story through their lens kept me captivated. 

I mover had the time or capability to.pursue my dream of publishing my own coffee table book until now. In addition to photography, I have always had a deep appreciation of finely made things and have strived to obtain samples and to experience the very finest products made by man. My coffee table book is going to revolve around that, a collection of a target 25 to 30 items that represent the epitome of what man is capable of making, a celebration of hand made in an age of mass produced machine made forgettable disposable consumer goods. Things like a Patek Philippe watch, a Hermes hand bag, a Fine Cuban cigar, a hand made AMG engine, a beautiful piece of furniture, etc.

The book will be called Hand Made: A Celebration of the finer things in life.

In addition to attracting people who are interested in well made beautiful things, I dream.of producing a book that will also impress and attract people who enjoy photography. I loom forward to traveling with my wife to these locatioms! My passions combined!


The contents will be four two sided pages per subject item:

Starting with a landscape photo of the facility in which the item is produced on one page and an overview of its history on the other. 

A picture of the item in use in real life on one side and an explanation of why it brings people joy on the other.

A black and white portrait style photo of the hands that made the itne as they are working on an item and an explanation of the process on the other.

Finally, a macro photo focusing on a finer detail that makes the item so valuable.

I am almost there in terms of equipment, have an H2D with a 90v for the hand shots, and the 20-30 E for the landscapes, the 55 to do the situational in use shots. Also have a Z9 that I use for wildlife that will be used with a 105mm for the macro pictures. 

I wanted to share the start of this project, and wish you all the very best in pursuing your own dream projects. I hope to be back in 3 to 5 years with my completed book!",2,1732593425.0,photography,0,1.0,False

Some background about me: I grew up in an insanely sheltered and religious home and then got pregnant when I was 16 and my family kicked me out so I went to live with an estranged uncle (whom I now call ‚Äúdad‚Äù) to raise the baby. I‚Äôve been on a few first dates and had a few one night stands over the past 16 years, but that‚Äôs about it for my love life. My son also had a girlfriend, and I met her and her father and hit it off really well with her dad. He was also a young parent and is around my age, and we talked a lot last year and the two of us ended up hooking up‚Ä¶I have a post about it last year. Anyway, we decided to move on and never speak of it, and then they broke up. Apparently, they left on good terms and share friend groups.

Recently, he texted me asking how I‚Äôve been. We went back-and-forth for a few days and there absolutely was chemistry. This past weekend, my son and his daughter had a school trip and he told me he had nothing to do that weekend and neither did I, so we arranged to get coffee Friday afternoon.

We both knew damn well what would happen and everybody reading this can figure out what happens so I‚Äôll cut to the chase: we went back to his house, went to his bedroom, bla bla bla, best sex I‚Äôve ever had, yadda yadda yadda, made me feel sexy and desired for the first time ever, etc etc etc. It was absolutely wonderful, but the best part‚Ä¶after we finished up, we lie down in his bed together, and then we started talking‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶and we kept talking. Seriously, we stayed up the entire night just talking about our relationships with our kids, childhood traumas, outlooks on life, hopes and dreams, word pronunciations we hated, and just general conversations. I never had any point felt like I was trying to maintain the conversation and it felt insanely natural. By the time we went to sleep, the sun was about to rise. The next morning, I woke up to him bringing my breakfast. I mentioned in passing the night before that I used to love getting Chinese food for breakfast and hadn‚Äôt done it in a while, and he actually ordered Chinese food to give me for breakfast. It was the most thoughtful thing anyone‚Äôs done for me in a while. Then we spent the entire day in his bedroom just talking once again.

By the time Sunday came, we were both really sad it was time to get back to life, but that was in my top three greatest experiences of my whole life. I literally spent the entire weekend lying in his bed with my clothes in a ball in the middle of the room just talking to him the entire time and the only time I ever got up was to use the bathroom. It was like the world didn‚Äôt exist beyond that room and nothing else mattered. We both got dressed and he kissed me goodbye and I went back home. I told my uncle I was on a trip with my friend for the weekend, but he knows me better than anyone else in the world so he very well could‚Äôve known I was lying.

Then this morning before work, I was eating breakfast with my uncle and got a text from him that said  ‚ÄúGood morning beautiful! how‚Äôd you sleep?‚Äù My uncle actually said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a big smile; who texted you?‚Äù after I read it (and again I lied and said it was my friend).

I feel like an awful person because I know this is a total betrayal to my son, and it would be insanely humiliating and mortifying for him to find out and our relationship may never be the same again‚Ä¶but part of me doesn‚Äôt care. I‚Äôm the happiest I‚Äôve been in a very long time and I‚Äôve wanted this my whole life. I‚Äôve always dreamed of being with someone who I could just talk to all night and he is so goddamn handsome and funny and kindhearted. This was one of the best weekends of my life and I am praying both of our kids go away again soon so we can do that again.

So yeah. I‚Äôm a mother knowing doing something destructive so my son for selfish reasons but I am so fucking happy. That is all.

tl;dr: my son‚Äôs ex girlfriend‚Äôs father and I hit it off really well and I spent the weekend at his house and had the most wonderful and intimate experience with another human being I‚Äôve ever had and now I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôm in love with someone I shouldn‚Äôt be and could possibly ruin my entire relationship with my son over.",1,1732592907.0,TrueOffMyChest,3,1.0,False

Ive been that guy (unfortunately) in the gym dry scooping 5 grams before and after workouts (not that gay anymore) and ive never had the slightest pain. 

Fast forward 2 years of excessive drinking, vaping, tobacco, weed(all which I‚Äôve done before excessively) and newly coke use (only done 4-5 times maybe took a gram in total) and i realized i swerved severely of the right path and so i smoked a fat backwood to the face and went cold turkey on everything the next day, whilst cutting off the losers i hung with.

I preface all of this to say its been 2 months I‚Äôve been bone sober not even nicotine, just coffee until today‚Ä¶

2 days ago i got some creatine because of a muscle spasm in my back, i work out 6 days a week (atleast for now just to build discipline and keep myself busy) and same day i started taking 100 mg if l-theanine to synergize with the caffeine and theoretically act as neurogum at home lol.

Ive done some research and seen conflicting views on caffine and creatine saying it can dehydrate you or cause it to be less effective and cause ‚Äúslight‚Äù stomach discomfort but I‚Äôve experienced the complete opposite.

All i take is supergreens, 100mg of l-theanine and i tried loading 10gs of creatine split into 2 5g doses yesterday and my caffeine intake is 1 large coffee in the morning around 12-16 oz. I went to sleep feeling great then woke up with a vicious pain in my stomach me thinking its because i ate 4x yesterday instead of 3 i assume im just a little bloated not thinking much of it ‚Ä¶

Well 2 shit later slamming water constantly and pissing 3 times i still wanted to dieüòÇ im jusr curious if anyone know any mix that could possibly be making me want to die after 7 hours of suffering i realized my mourning showering soothed it so i got a heating pad and layed directly on my stomach and woke up 2 hours later feeling 80% better.

The pain was in my lower abdomen and i also started doing hanging abs crunches on a pull up bar (didnt get the best stretch in before but i used to crush these a few years ago and the worst ive gotten was a abs cramp for a few minutes, this was waaaayy worse). If anyone is smart enough to possibly pinpoint the problem id love you forever if not i hope the heating pad method can help save somebody for enduring pure pain for hours (i am a lil bitch when it comes to stomach pain ngl, but this felt horrificü§£) thanks again for any insightsü´∂üèΩ",0,1732592561.0,Supplements,2,0.5,False

1h02koi,https://www.reddit.com/r/macbook/comments/1h02koi/bought_the_macbook_pro_14_inch_with_m4_pro_so_far/,"Bought the MacBook Pro, 14 inch with M4 Pro -  so far very happy!","Returning to Mac after a seven-ish year hiatus. Went back and forth A LOT between an 13 inch Air, 15 inch Air and finally the 14 inch M4 Pro.

Want to share a few responses to common advice about choosing MacBook Air models over Pro.

**1. The Pro is chunky, heavier and not very portable.**

Yes, it is heavier than a 15 inch Air and obviously even more than a 13 inch Air. But *not much*. For a little context, my wife and I were both due for a computer replacement and she was sold on the 15 inch Air. So we purchased hers and she let me use it for about a week to get a feel for it. (Remember, I've been out of Mac usage for quite some time.) I really, really loved the 15 inch Air. And this was despite feeling it was a little heavier than I expected but realistically it was not an issue to carry around, take to coffee shops or prop on my lap when on the couch. So far, **the 14 inch Pro seems just a little heavier** but not in a very meaningful way for this out of shape Dad-bod rocker.

**2. The fans are going to kick on**.

Yes, it has fans. Yes, they come on. In order to GET THEM to come on, I ran `stress-ng` on all 12 CPU cores. No fan sounds on the one min test. Fans did kick on when I ran a longer test but the volume was insignificant. And the fans immediately shut off once the process ended six minutes later. Honestly if you're doing the sort of work where you expect the fans will kick on frequently, I would bet you need the additional processing power of the M4 Pro or Max anyway so it's a moot point on choosing the Air over the Pro.

**3. The screen is smaller**

Yes...yes it is. And that one inch does make a difference\* but this is somewhat negated by a major selling point of the Pro. **An HDMI port.** If you're interested in an HDMI port, then you're going to be using external monitors and the smaller screen size is less of a factor.

That's all. I've been lurking and wondering about these possible hang ups so wanted to contribute my less than three hour hold observations.

1h02hyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1h02hyd/unusual_memory_issues/,Unusual memory issues?,"I have Bipolar Disorder which has been under control for quite some time with decently minimal meds (compared to what I was on prior); I have autism; and I'm being evaluated for ADHD, which I've heard can look like memory issues with certain things like forgetting why you came in a room or why you opened a browser window because your brain just got sidetracked.

I kinda get that, it happens a lot that I'll have several thoughts on the way to get a cup of coffee and my mind just had to take a moment to reset, or I'll open my browser and have several tabs loaded (so I don't forget what I was working on/researching or I forgot to close a tab) then get distracted by a tab and forget I was going to check the weather or whatever.

However, recently I've had other things happen, and last night/this morning was the kicker. I've been waking up the last week or two and my door has been closed. Mom once closed the door so the cat wouldn't bother me so I thought she had been doing it. This morning I found it locked. I don't remember closing and locking my door last night but I had to, because it's an inner door that locks from the inside, and is just one of those mini screw locks on the outside. I can't think of any reason either of my parents would go through that trouble, which just leaves me, and I wonder how many times I've closed my own door at night without realizing it.

I don't normally sleepwalk, I didn't take any sleep meds last night, but I am on one medication that can cause brain fog, and I'm hoping I was just tired and foggy when I went to bed and automatically locked the door.

1h02gkp,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1h02gkp/avoidant_personality_disorder/,Avoidant Personality Disorder ,"Life is irredeemably terrible. This is the philosophy that motivates me to eat, shower and breathe. I am a hamster, living in my little cage, with no thought of venturing beyond the nicotine and Netflix laden walls of my attention. I do nothing with my life and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm basically the most sensible kind of person. Because I have done the proper risk assessment for happiness, and the verdict is music to the ears of whatever part of me loves alcohol, weed and Fortnite. Allowing yourself to be happy is fucking insane. You‚Äôre basically orchestrating your own tragedy. You labour to achieve happiness, and then you get sick and die, or your loved ones die, or World War three happens and you violate all your moral principles in the wasteland of the aftermath, looting and killing and mutating your way to death. It might be a basic take, a weak, pathetic excuse not to try. But I think it‚Äôs true; nothing is more reliable than disappointment.

My life is fucking amazing when I think about the logistics. I don‚Äôt have to work, I don‚Äôt have to tolerate people, I‚Äôm basically on holiday forever. I need only browse google and drink or smoke weed until I cannot perceive the sadness of such an inconsequential existence. The internet is really the best thing to ever happen to people like me. Literally everything intelligence has ever known or created is a click away, and you know what that means ‚Äì free porn, free car crash compilations, and how to roll a joint that looks like a swan. The internet is the perfect bin into which my life shall be discarded. The idea of no internet, of being forced to talk to people for fun or becoming highly skilled or educated, seems like an unimaginable happiness to my imagination. But as alluring as that is, if the internet actually went away I would probably kill myself. Even if I had like you know love and friends and happiness, what would it all mean without YouTube? My screen time is 19 hours a day. I‚Äôm probably asleep for some of that and I went to school once but that was 7 years ago so I‚Äôve spent a good 4 or 5 years of my life drooling over the swirling pixels of the internet. That doesn‚Äôt disturb me, honestly I feel like I‚Äôve really achieved something.

But I don‚Äôt like my life. Being alive is terrible. And not in the profound way that might constitute a story worth telling like it is for a drug addict or soldier. My life is terrible in a way that isn‚Äôt worth looking at, a boredom so hopeless it‚Äôs pretty much torture to exist. I‚Äôd probably be fine with it if I had a buddy to chill with. The loneliness is what makes me think about evacuating consciousness 20 times a day. You know in Wall-E at the beginning when he‚Äôs made his cute little life in the scorched rubble of Earth, and he has his cute little hobbies and entertaining bits of trash and his friend cockroach, but he‚Äôs too lonely to enjoy it? The difference is in the film it‚Äôs just exposition, very quickly a charmed love interest descends from the heavens and he finally gets to share his little life. He‚Äôs so excited to show Eve all his things, because showing her makes it all worth something. Well I‚Äôm perpetually trapped in apprehension of that happening to me, but it won‚Äôt. I want to complete the spell, these mysterious enchantments of thought and knowledge and opinions, they need 2 to work, 2 to profit from the magic. Life is a solipsistic nightmare if you don‚Äôt have friends. But then I remember what people are actually like. I did know some at one point. I know myself too. We are all disgusting. I know what friendships are like in real life, how selfish, ceremonial and fake people are, constantly playing a part and never really being what they‚Äôre perceived as by their closest friends. So that makes me feel better, because I know the friend I want doesn‚Äôt exist. And the pain of watching happy couples and groups of laughing teens and wishing it were me, is relieved by the reality behind the facade. I don‚Äôt want what they have. I want you, imaginary creature. And I can‚Äôt have you. Such is life.

Imagine just being able to go to chess club or a drawing class or stand behind the till at McDonalds and appear as forgettable as any other human. I don‚Äôt think people can forget me, I‚Äôm that marriage of ugly and mentally enigmatic that leaves a lasting impression of ‚Äúthat guy in my class from 10 years ago who I never even spoke to, he was weird as fuck.‚Äù My personality is obscure. So I know exactly why I refuse to enact the copy pasted cliched fixes: ‚Äújust join a class, work in retail, be a barman.‚Äù Socialising will only ever be a practical demonstration of my exclusion from society. I am highly experienced in humans; job applications; social propositions, an unbroken chain of rejection. Positivists celebrate the wisdom of experience when it comes to work yet dismiss mine as a bad attitude when it comes to life. Nevertheless, fitting in among the humans is a non-starter. So what else is there to do?

Whenever the sweet fortune of a dream is gifted to me, I awake in mourning. I want to live in a dream forever, even if it‚Äôs a nightmare. I pour a jar of instant coffee straight into a cup and match the level of coffee with half boiled water because the kettle takes too fucking long. I don‚Äôt bother swallowing, I just pour it straight down, not opening my eyes until my heart rate doubles. I vape as I drink it, and sometimes play some Ella Fitzgerald or Sarah Vaughn on YouTube. The smoke swirls in the operatic jazz of the air and makes a glaze through which the autumn leaves beyond the window begin to sparkle. So fucking sophisticated. Sometimes I wear a top hat and pretend I‚Äôm a private detective while I do it. But I‚Äôm mostly too lazy to do anything that productive, if you can call it productive. It kind of is for an unemployed person. Anything that isn‚Äôt sitting still like a statue is productive when you‚Äôre unemployed. More usually I take coffee with an hour of Tik Tok. Everything else makes your brain thirsty when you know you could just watch Tik Tok instead. After that little sesh, well‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs not much to describe anymore. It‚Äôs some combination of YouTube, Netflix, and Fortnite until my eyes are rolling into my skull from sleep deprivation, which is my cue to power down.

I play piano sometimes. I kind of have a knack for it, but a half-arsed knack. I can play almost anything, Liszt, Chopin, Debussy. I don‚Äôt know why I even do it, I guess I‚Äôm just clinging to any possibility of talent that might justify my existence. But I‚Äôm not actually good. I can press the right buttons, but I can‚Äôt make them sound that good, and lets be real I always make mistakes. It‚Äôs all very impressive to people when I play basic shit like moonlight sonata 3^(rd) movement or fantasia impromptu, and people are like oo fast hands, you‚Äôre a pianist. But if you listen to a recording of the song next to how I play it you realise I play it like a robot. People who have been close to me have said that, usually behind my back, that I‚Äôm too mechanical, no feeling. Not that they need to say it because I already know. You can go crazy comparing yourself to the best, playing the same four bars over and over trying to copy the way a pro does it, only to conclude that their skill is ten times more unattainable than I you initially thought. I mean, it‚Äôs not really feeling per say, I have all the feelings, but what they call musical feeling is just the ability to play the exact right notes at the exact volume with the exact timing while playing 20 notes a second. If you can‚Äôt physically control that, your feelings don‚Äôt count. I‚Äôll probably never be that good. My potential isn‚Äôt a goal, it‚Äôs a wall.

People don‚Äôt understand that. My family constantly spam me with ridiculous fantasy jobs. ‚ÄúMusician needed: 6-month cruise in the Caribbean! Join our crew and help to give our guests the holiday of a lifetime!‚Äù Ooh, wouldn‚Äôt that be good darling? You‚Äôre so good at piano, and you love staying indoors, this is the perfect job for you! I can‚Äôt play piano in a band because I can‚Äôt read music or improvise, and I would rather do literally anything than play hotel lobby music all night in a vomit inducing box full of disgusting humans whose gluttonous impulses have been freed by the unlimited drinks. Maybe that could be fun, to be fair, but I‚Äôm not a musician, and literally couldn‚Äôt do that job. And if I can‚Äôt even get a job on a factory line, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs much hope for a luxury ocean liner. Mostly they send pictures of ‚Äòwe‚Äôre hiring‚Äô ads in coffee shop windows. ‚ÄúPlease apply to this. You need a job. You‚Äôre almost 30, it‚Äôs ridiculous you haven‚Äôt gotten a job yet. We can‚Äôt support you forever. I expect you to apply immediately.‚Äù I actually do want a job, and I apply to them constantly. A few years ago I couldn‚Äôt apply, I would fill in applications and then close my laptop without sending them, patting myself on the back as though I‚Äôd applied. But after a few drunkenly brazen sent receipts, I realised there‚Äôs no need to fear applying, because they‚Äôre not going to interview me. It sounds a lot like I don‚Äôt want to work, but who wouldn‚Äôt want money? I‚Äôd do anything for money. What I don‚Äôt want is confrontation, humiliation, and confirmation of my fears. ‚ÄúOf course you don‚Äôt. No one does. Suck it up. You *have* to work. You don‚Äôt have a choice. If you had to get a job, you would find you suddenly were ablet to do it.‚Äù Honestly, if I was in a position where I had to get a job to survive, I think I‚Äôd scrape enough money together to buy some alcohol, drink until I forget about my tremendously problematic predicament, and then focus on the new problem: obtaining a refill. It‚Äôs not my fault if people don‚Äôt want to hire me. I can‚Äôt act like a normal person who‚Äôs good at talking. I try all the time it‚Äôs just not convincing. My kind of neurodiversity means there is a chasm between what I mean to say, and what it looks like I‚Äôm saying. Does that mean I don‚Äôt get to have a job ever? Is that even fair, learn social skills or die?

Maybe this frustration is why I applied to the Royle College of Music. I guess I thought I failed to achieve anything on my own, but formal education might get me there. Though the idea of college makes me want to peel my skin off with a vegetable peeler and eat it. Being locked up with all the youths who are partying and kissing and filling their brains with crazy stories they‚Äôll be able to tell in 50 year‚Äôs time while I just watch it happening like a ghost, powerless to participate. If I have to be alone, I at least shouldn‚Äôt have to look, I should be allowed to cover my eyes and block my ears and pretend none of it is happening so that I can focus on what really matters which is finding a way to be ok with my hamster cage life. But I did apply. I must have been drunk lol. And now I have an interview, and I have to talk to someone and make them like and admire me. I find that entire concept kind of stupid, really they should just be judging the quality of my relevant skills and work, like listen to me play the songs, look at my school grades, look at these terrible beats I made on garage band, and decide if I can do the course or not. Don‚Äôt judge me as a person. But I get it. It‚Äôs fine. This is just what life has to be. We have to do things we don‚Äôt want to do and that‚Äôs ok, it‚Äôs amazing really. We grow, we blossom. We abandon ourselves and earn the right to be happy by completely changing our personalities because they were deemed worthless and terrible by the normies. I can abandon my personality. I want to abandon it. I‚Äôll bury it in the garden, or in a ditch. Fuck you me! You can just go die in the corner like everyone always neither wanted nor didn‚Äôt want you to do.

Fuck it, you know what I can do this! I‚Äôm going to go to the interview, and I‚Äôll talk those fuckers‚Äô ears off about how much I want to be good, how I want to make the world a better place by telling stories through music, stories so encapsulating about life that my audience will forget all their problems and the whole wide withering world for a moment of pure enchanting emotional satisfaction. And I‚Äôll play Rihanoff‚Äôs prelude in G minor and they‚Äôll say ‚ÄúHoly fuck, forgive me but you‚Äôre the most talented person I‚Äôve ever known to exist.‚Äù And I‚Äôll get the place, and my talent will draw people to me like a magnet so I won‚Äôt have to socialise to know people, it will just happen. And‚Ä¶ oh fuck it. Never mind. I just tried playing that one and it sounded like a blue whale shat on the piano from 500ft in the air. Oh well, it was a nice little fantasy, I‚Äôd hate to be *that* talented anyway. I hate attention, because the focus of attention will always inevitably fall upon my physical ugliness. I just want to be good enough for something, you know? Maybe I should say that? Or I can be honest. Normies always advise honesty in situations like this. ‚ÄúWhy do I want to study at the RCoM? Well, to be entirely honest with you, I want a successful career so that I‚Äôll always be able to fund my drug and alcohol habits. I think becoming a professional musician will secure that for me. Besides, the best musicians are always druggies right? Does that mean I qualify for a scholarship? Because I‚Äôm a total druggie. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm the perfect candidate for your course.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood luck today darling! No matter what happens, I‚Äôm proud of you. x ‚Äì mum.‚Äù The more I think about actually going to this thing, the less I want to go. I just play with it as a stupid toy thought, but the second I imagine it happening, it‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ Like a gang trying to bust your front door down in the middle of the night. That heart sinking, God-given cocaine of a panic. Normally I don‚Äôt feel like that much. I don‚Äôt really have social anxiety, because I know I won‚Äôt ever find myself in a social situation. But I probably do have it when I have to. I just choose not to. Seems rational. If I let that text sit on my lock screen, I won‚Äôt be able to pretend it isn‚Äôt happening. So I clear the notification. Now it isn‚Äôt happening anymore, and I‚Äôm hungry. I‚Äôm going to make pasta. My parents are away for the week, so I can do whatever I want ‚Äì smoke, lie about going to interviews, and put dirty pasta dishes in the sink without immediately washing them. I feel kind of guilty about acting in a selfish, reckless way, but maybe I‚Äôm just a terrible person, and I don‚Äôt deserve to live. I deserve to seek justice for my own moral failures, so that‚Äôs what I‚Äôll do. Take a deep breath, put the pot on the boil, crack the xbox on. Ahhh, Fortnite! Fortnite and weed and beer and vape. This is heaven.

As the sun went down, with its usual drama-queen fiery rainbows, I thought I don‚Äôt really want to study music anyway. I wouldn‚Äôt have gotten in, being real. It‚Äôs way too competitive, the interview would have been an unnecessary disappointment. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs some kind of course or job or something I could do, it‚Äôs ok if it takes a while to find it, we‚Äôre all on a different path in life. Comparison is the thief of joy. Success is not final, failure is not fatal, it is the courage to continue that counts! Thank you, Instagram pseudo poetic quotes. You are bullshit but it‚Äôs convenient to concur so you‚Äôre very deep and wise.

I knew something was off because the loneliness felt a little more desolate than usual. The dim ceiling lamps invented the walls of an empty family home, their beams encased in the thick black oil of night. The frost squeezed through the door frame and the cracks between windows, smelling like a bonfire. But it wasn‚Äôt cozy like usual. It was scary. It took my mind off everything, which was strange. Then it started to sting a bit. Started to smell less woody, and more like‚Ä¶ paracetamol or something. Then like plastic. The stench dragged me as though with rope from the delightful beams of Fortnite into the hall, and it was smoky. Had I smoked? I don‚Äôt remember smoking. I go down and the fucking kitchen is on fire. It was surreal. Not the fire, but the fact something had happened to me. Nothing ever happens to me ever. But it did and it was pretty crazy because it was the size of a bedside table when I went it, and it got big real fast. I tried to put it out with a fire extinguisher, but it didn‚Äôt go out, it just kept growing. It was like a parachute opening or something, and it was insane I got there at exactly the right time because literally 20 seconds later the entire ceiling was burning.

By the time the fire brigade arrived, the whole house was wobbling in flames and crumbling into a camouflage against the bleak night sky. This is the kind of thing that would permanently traumatise my mum. I left the fucking stove on. At least it wasn‚Äôt because I left a half-lit joint on the floor in a black out. But still, probably the worst thing I‚Äôve ever done. I hadn‚Äôt had that kind of rush of remorse since I got after school detentions when I was 14, that dreadful shame and regret. But what‚Äôs done is done.

I wonder if my xbox could hack the heat. Or my computer. Or my vape, which was half full and which I can‚Äôt afford to waste. They‚Äôre just sitting there, turning to ash, the same way my brief visions of a worthwhile future turn to ash in my mind every single day. At least the internet isn‚Äôt burnt down. No one can burn the internet. It‚Äôs a distributed, decentralised network of indestructible procrastination. I unlock my phone and the 1 badge is over my messages. I open it. ‚ÄúGood luck today darling! No matter what happens, I‚Äôm proud of you x ‚Äì mum.‚Äù

I guess I am just a terrible person. I didn‚Äôt mean to burn my house down, but that doesn‚Äôt really matter now does it? Even for me, this was a pretty dumb mistake. Maybe punishment for doing the same thing every day and never being strong enough to participate life. I walked away from the house, down random streets. The stars are clear tonight. They look nice. Bit disappointing compared to those galactic long exposures from NASA, but still nice, the little conservatively studded silver dots sprinkled amid the void. They can neither improve on nor reject their level of prettiness, they were just made that way. I feel like I have a bit more agency than those stars, like I could improve, at least a bit. But maybe that feeling is part of the trick. Just like those boring clich√©s, I am what I am, and nothing else at all.

1h02gen,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semenretention/comments/1h02gen/some_experiences_that_made_me_believe_magic_is/,Some experiences that made me believe magic is real. The universe is more amazing than we could ever imagine. ,"I started a thread a few days ago asking about some of your stories that would be unbelievable to the average person. Especially those who have never practiced SR. I‚Äôm still hesitant to share full details of my own because I think my experiences are meant to speak to me as I‚Äôm the only one who can understand the full context. Without the whole backstory you can never understand why these stories were so powerful for me.

However, I‚Äôm willing to share diluted versions of some of my experiences. Why? I don‚Äôt quite know. All I know is I have the urge to share these with you all so I‚Äôm fulfilling that urge because it feels right. This is what my soul wants to do at this moment.

Many of these might seem like coincidences to an outsider. I understand. But because I know the full context and backstory of all of these experiences, there‚Äôs something about them that tells me there‚Äôs a possibility that they‚Äôre more than mere coincidences.

Here we go‚Ä¶

**Do I have energetic connections with others?**

This has happened on numerous occasions. I‚Äôll think of a song and someone I know will start singing it a few minutes later. It could be a relative or friend or coworker in the same room as me. The moment the song comes to mind, someone near me will start singing a few lines. 

While I‚Äôm listening to a song, someone on my social media will share that same song seconds after. It‚Äôs as if we started listening at the same time. It‚Äôs usually someone I‚Äôve spoken to recently or have some kind of relation to again like a relative, friend, or coworker. Never someone completely random.

**Do I have spirit guides communicating with me?**

I‚Äôll be thinking of some current problems and their solutions. If I‚Äôm stuck on something, whatever I‚Äôm watching or listening to will give me the answer.

It could be a sentence a podcaster says, a song lyric, a seemingly random YouTube ad. If I‚Äôm running errands and am wondering about something, the next thing I look at or pick up will answer me. If I‚Äôm feeling a bit tired I‚Äôll look at a label that says drink water. If I‚Äôm wondering whether I should do something or delay it or skip it altogether for another idea, the next thing I look at is a Nike ad with their slogan Just Do It. If I‚Äôm ruminating on something and start to have feelings of discomfort, the next thing I see on social media is something that makes me laugh.

The timing is always near instant. If I‚Äôm having a negative thought, something always happens to help snap me out of it.

**Does the universe send people to aid me?**

It could be the smallest of things. If I‚Äôm in need of a pen, the next person I see happens to have one in their hand. If I‚Äôm at the gym and walk towards the dumbbell rack for the next pair I need and the spaces are empty, the person using them walks to put them back at the exact moment I realize the dumbbells are in use. If I‚Äôm having a hectic start to my morning and am in a rush buying coffee, the person in front of me will be in a good mood and offer to buy me coffee.

**The universe is amazing.**

Even if these are just coincidences. Even if there are logical explanations for all of these things. I don‚Äôt care. The person might just see I‚Äôm having a hectic start to my day and wants to do a good deed. If I need a pen in a work environment it makes sense that someone would have one in their hand. If I‚Äôm thinking of a song it might be a popular one now or in the past so of course others would know about it.

But none of these logical explanations matter to me. The timing, the backstory, the full context all add together to such profound experiences that sometimes I can‚Äôt help but wonder what‚Äôs happening.

There‚Äôs something special about this practice. I don‚Äôt know what it is exactly. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm ready to know. What I do know is how deeply retaining has impacted me and I can‚Äôt help but be grateful.

Maybe I‚Äôll share more as time goes on with more backstory and detail. For now this is what I‚Äôm willing to offer. One love. ",11,1732592069.0,Semenretention,3,1.0,False

That morning, he drove our youngest daughter, who was 16, to the bus stop because it was dark and raining outside. When he came home, we sat and had a cup of coffee together.

At 7 a.m., he went into our bedroom to shower and get ready for work. I told him I‚Äôd give him half an hour before I would come in to take my shower.



When I did, I found him dead on the bathroom floor. His skin was grey, his eyes open, his glasses on, and his body twisted as if he had collapsed.

I tried to get a response, then started chest compressions. Nothing. I called for my dad, who was in the kitchen, to call 911. When help arrived, it was a police officer, then later EMTs.



The officer tried to give him a shock with those paddles, but it wouldn‚Äôt go off at all to provide the shock¬†; he was gone, unresponsive. The EMTs couldn‚Äôt get his heart started either.

He was dead.

I was in absolute shock and regret that I would‚Äôve died without wasting a second if somebody told me they could get him back.

We had been together for 22¬†years and married for 17.5¬†years. He was the love of my life, my soulmate. The doctor at the hospital said he died instantly¬†; he wouldn‚Äôt have known what was happening, and he didn‚Äôt feel any pain.

I‚Äôm so much regretful that I didn‚Äôt have the chance to talk to him in his last breaths. God, at least once‚Ä¶



A week after his passing, a female friend of mine was helping me go through my husband‚Äôs things in our bedroom. I was standing by his side of the bed, gathering up papers and mail from his nightstand.

I turned and looked up toward the hallway that was between the bathroom and a little dressing room where our closets were. I saw a dark shadow step out of the bathroom into the hallway and turn toward me, about 15¬†feet away.



As I stared at it, I said to my friend, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a shadow.‚Äù She turned and looked but didn‚Äôt say anything. Then I said, ‚ÄúHoney, you died. Go to the light. You don‚Äôt belong here anymore. Go see your father.‚Äù The shadow vanished.



I miss my husband so much¬†; he was a wonderful husband and father. I pray he is at peace in heaven. In the days that followed, I felt lost, wandering through the house that once echoed with laughter and warmth.

Every corner reminded me of him. The smell of his cologne hung in our bedroom, a bittersweet reminder of the man I had loved for so long. I would often sit on the bed, staring at his side, waiting for him to walk in and share a joke or simply ask how my day had been.



The initial shock slowly turned into a deep sense of loneliness. Although friends and family surrounded me with their condolences, nothing could replace the gap he left behind.

It was during those quiet evenings, sitting alone with my thoughts, that his absence truly hit me. I recalled our late-night talks, how we would plan our weekends, and how he always knew how to make me laugh, even on my toughest days.



As the days passed, I started to really feel how much I missed him. I looked for little hints that he was still around, like when a light blinked, the floor made a noise, or I felt a soft breeze on his side of the bed.

I even began to talk to him, telling him about my day, what was bothering me, and what I dreamed about for the future. It made me feel better to think that he could hear me and was helping me in some way, even if he wasn‚Äôt here anymore.



One evening, I decided to look through some of his things. It was hard to do, but I needed to. When I opened his drawers, I found an old photo album.

As I turned the pages, I saw pictures of us together‚Äîour wedding, family trips, and funny moments that showed how much we loved each other.

Each photo made me feel happy and reminded me of the good times we shared. It was like I could almost hear him laughing in those special moments.



I realized how much he had shaped me. He had been my rock, always encouraging me to pursue my passions and dreams.

He would often say, ‚ÄúLife is too short not to enjoy it,‚Äù and I knew I needed to honor that sentiment.

In the weeks that followed, I began to explore activities that I had put on hold for years‚Äîpainting, gardening, and even writing. Each brush stroke and every flower I planted felt like a tribute to him, a way of keeping his spirit alive in my heart, which would always be.



One night, while lying in bed, I had a vivid dream. In it, my husband appeared, bathed in a soft, warm light. He looked as he did in his younger days, full of life and vitality.

We spoke briefly, and he told me he was okay, that I needed to take care of myself, and that he would always be with me. I woke up feeling a sense of peace I hadn‚Äôt felt since he passed. It was as if he had wrapped me in a comforting embrace from the other side, assuring me that I wasn‚Äôt alone.



As the months came by, I started attending a support group for those who had lost loved ones. Sharing my story with others who understood my pain was cathartic. We laughed and cried together, finding solace in our shared experiences.

The group became a safe space, allowing me to voice my fears and hopes without judgment. I learned that grief had no timeline and that it was okay to feel joy again while still missing him.



One of the group members suggested writing letters to our loved ones as a way to process our feelings. I found this exercise to be incredibly therapeutic.

Each week, I would pour my heart onto the page, telling him about my day, sharing my struggles, and letting him know how much I missed him. It felt like a way to keep our connection alive, and I cherished the moments I spent writing to him.



Eventually, I started to feel a sense of renewal. I realized that while my husband may no longer be physically present, his love continued to guide me. I decided to take a trip to one of our favorite places‚Äî the beach where we had spent many summers together.

It was a place filled with laughter, joy, and beautiful memories. As I walked along the shore, the salty breeze blew through my hair, and I could almost hear his voice mingling with the sound of the waves crashing against the shore.



Sitting on the sand, I closed my eyes and imagined him beside me, his hand holding mine. I let the waves wash over my feet, feeling the warmth of the sun on my skin, and I whispered, ‚ÄúI love you, and I always will.‚Äù In that moment, I understood that love transcends even death, and the memories we create together remain etched in our hearts forever.



As I began to move forward, I embraced life with a newfound perspective. I started volunteering at a local shelter, channeling my energy into helping others in need.

It was rewarding and fulfilling, allowing me to honor my husband‚Äôs memory by spreading kindness and love. Every time I helped someone, I felt as if he were smiling down on me, proud of the person I was becoming.



It‚Äôs been several years since I lost him, and while the pain of his absence still lingers, I have learned to cherish the moments we shared rather than dwell on the loss.¬†I carry him with me in everything I do‚Äî in my art, my actions, and my heart.

The shadow I saw that day in the hallway reminded me that while he may not be physically here, his spirit continues to guide me.



In remembering him, I‚Äôve learned to celebrate life, to embrace the beautiful messiness of it all, and to cherish the moments that make us feel alive. I often find myself smiling when I think of our life together, knowing that love is eternal and that he will always be a part of me.

So, as I navigate this journey, I hold onto the lessons he taught me‚Äî to love fiercely, laugh often, and never take a single moment for granted.



I pray he is at peace ind heaven, and I know that one day, we will be reunited. Until then, I carry him with me in my heart, a guiding light through the darkness. And in that way, I will never truly be alone.



LOVE YOU¬†¬†My Evergreen Love¬†!

1h02b3r,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1h02b3r/confused_about_where_things_stand_need_advice/,Confused about where things stand - need advice,"Hello Reddit,

I (32M, European) am looking for some advice.

A trusted friend set me up with a girl (29F, Indian), and I‚Äôve heard amazing things about her. She‚Äôs passionate about her job, super kind, family-oriented, and looking for the same things in life as I am. We seem to have a lot in common, and I was excited to see where things could go.

We‚Äôve been on four dates, all of which went really well. We even planned a fifth, and I was starting to feel like this could have serious potential.

During one of our dates, she mentioned that she had dated a white guy before, but her parents weren‚Äôt thrilled about it‚Äîthough that guy turned out to be sort of a bum, and toxic. I asked if her parents knew she was dating another white guy (me), and she said yes. She also mentioned that my Italian background felt familiar to her Indian culture in terms of family values, which she saw as a positive.

Fast forward: we had a great Monday dinner date and decided to meet again that Sunday. But on Friday, she texted to say she wanted to take a rest day. No problem‚ÄîI understand how busy life can get.

The following week, though, our conversations became quieter. I reached out to acknowledge it and told her I‚Äôd love to see her again if she was open to it, but that I didn‚Äôt want to put her in an uncomfortable position (since we were set up by someone we both respect). She assured me she does want to go out again but said she‚Äôd be super busy until the new year.

I responded by offering to keep it casual‚Äîsuggesting we grab coffee or dinner on a weeknight if she found time. She called me ‚Äúa really nice guy‚Äù for offering, but it felt like she was politely brushing me off. So, I decided to pump the brakes on messaging her. I didn‚Äôt ghost her, but I also stopped initiating conversations, figuring I should focus my energy elsewhere.

But here‚Äôs the twist: now she‚Äôs messaging me almost every day‚Äîasking about my day, checking in, and keeping the conversation going. I find this confusing. Why is she making the effort to chat daily if she‚Äôs ‚Äútoo busy‚Äù until the new year?

I don‚Äôt want to be the guy who keeps pushing for plans and ends up looking desperate. At the same time, I wish she‚Äôd just tell me what she really wants.

Any advice on how to navigate this situation without coming off as clingy or overbearing?

TLDR: I (32M) was set up with a girl (29F) and went on four great dates. She mentioned being busy until the new year, so I stopped pushing for plans. Now she messages me daily, which feels confusing since she said she‚Äôs too busy to meet. I don‚Äôt want to seem desperate but also wish she‚Äôd be clear about what she wants.

We‚Äôre all 24ish and have been living together for three years now with slight hiccups along the way but recently I just feel like I‚Äôve been hit with a bus of passive aggressiveness and whenever I try to say anything to stand up for myself, the roommate(s) are the victim. For starters I am the only student in the house the rest have graduated and have ‚Äòadult‚Äô jobs while I work part time and school full time. I do keep some of my school supplies in our downstairs common space to work on my projects because my cat makes it impossible to do in my room. Most recently I had some supplies on the coffee table in our living room and roommate A‚Äôs idea of cleaning the living room was to put all of my supplies in a pile on a chair in the space. I‚Äôve since moved a desk in my room so it doesn‚Äôt happen again. 
 Another incident was the same roommate putting my clean laundry from the dryer into a cardboard box.. that was literally in the recycle before this. For my things being put on the chair for ‚Äòcleaning‚Äô I didn‚Äôt say anything but I did say something about my clean clothes being put in practical garbage and was met with a lengthy ‚Äò I would never disrespect your things‚Äô while my things are being actively disrespected. 

Both of my roommates shop at bulk stores and had taken up so much space in the fridge there was zero room for me to even think about buying food. So my bf bought me a mini fridge(bless)after buying it I sent to the group chat saying how the yearly cost of running it would only average like $60 some odd dollars with no response ( which is fine but also an acknowledgment wouldn‚Äôt of hurt) 
They‚Äôve broken a spoon rest of mine and decided not the tell me and just start using the rest as a sponge holder ( yuck) and was also met with a defensive response after saying that I‚Äôd rather just be told about something being broken rather than finding it. 
 Back to roommate A- my bedroom shares a wall with the bathroom which we both use, when I say I can hear everything in the bathroom I mean everything, including them not washing their hands after using!??? I get sick so easily and it‚Äôs just down right disgusting and I have zero clue on how to ask someone to do the bare minimum such as washing hands. This roommate also has a cat and they actively don‚Äôt clean the litter box, there is easily a month worth of litter in that box and their solution for the smell is to buy air purifiers!! The smell slaps you in the face when you walk in the door. 
  Roommate B and I get along really well and share similar views but recently they cut a big leaf off of one of my house plants and it‚Äôs just like‚Ä¶..why why why
Both roommates recently used firewood that I had bought to use when my bf is over while we watch movies or I work on a painting just as something nice, it wouldn‚Äôt of been an issue for me if they asked and they hadn‚Äôt! They also didn‚Äôt set up the fireplace correctly so the two blocks of wood they used were practically wasted and just left semi charred in the fireplace. They both make more money than me and didn‚Äôt offer any financial comp. I‚Äôm not trying to nickel and dime them but again it‚Äôs something I spent my money on and it‚Äôs the principle of asking!! 
Maybe I‚Äôm the asshole and just being sensitive but I also just believe in boundaries and reciprocating respect of each others items. :\ only six months left and I don‚Äôt plan on moving again with either of them. ",1,1732591577.0,badroommates,0,1.0,False
1h029gi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1h029gi/aitah_for_pulling_out_of_a_wedding_and_ending_a/,AITAH for pulling out of a wedding and ending a 20+ year friendship via text?,"I (25F) have been friends with Sophie (25F) for as long as I can remember. She‚Äôs been a constant in my life, from our toddler years to now. We were super close throughout elementary, middle, and high school, but we grew a bit distant during college since we attended different schools.

Our relationship hasn‚Äôt always been great, though. Over the years, resentment has built up because of certain events. For example:

Sophie and I were eligible for a free trip abroad. We‚Äôd been planning to go together, and the best time to go was during college so we could join others from our area. I decided to wait for Sophie. Then, in October 2022, I got a text from her out of the blue saying she‚Äôd signed up for the trip‚Äîand that she was sorry she hadn‚Äôt told me. What upset me most was that (1) she didn‚Äôt tell me until after registration had closed, and (2) she had signed up three weeks earlier without saying a word. I understood she wanted to go on the trip alone, but not telling me for weeks felt like a betrayal.

But that wasn‚Äôt the only issue.

In middle school, my core friend group was Sophie, Abby, Janie, and me. I introduced Sophie and Abby, and they became so close they started hanging out without me. I felt excluded and hurt. Eventually, I became closer to Janie, and our group dynamic shifted. We all hung out as a foursome, but it was clear that Sophie and Abby were closer, while Janie and I were tight.

In high school, Sophie got a boyfriend and started ditching us to spend time with him. It got so bad we confronted her, and she outright told us, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs more important to me than you guys.‚Äù That ended her friendship with Janie, who didn‚Äôt hold back during the confrontation. Meanwhile, Abby started hanging out with Janie and me more, but eventually, Abby and Janie became closer and started excluding me‚Äîjust like Sophie and Abby had in middle school.

Fast forward: Abby, Sophie, and I stayed in touch over the years, while Janie moved to Florida for college. I was the only one who kept in contact with her.

In November 2023, Janie moved back home, and we started hanging out like old times, seeing each other 4-5 times a week. A few months later, Abby reached out, asking if she could join us. I was hesitant because I didn‚Äôt want to feel excluded again, but I decided to give it a shot. Reconnecting went surprisingly well, and the three of us started hanging out twice a month.

At Abby‚Äôs birthday party, Sophie showed up. It was the first time she and Janie had seen each other in years. At first, the reunion seemed fine, but then Sophie pulled me aside to talk trash about Janie. It was clear she still hadn‚Äôt moved past their confrontation from high school, which annoyed me.

Now, fast forward to September 2024: Sophie got engaged and invited me to coffee, where she asked me to be a bridesmaid. I was excited and said yes. During the conversation, she mentioned booking Airbnbs for the bridal party, and I said, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt wait to share an Airbnb with Abby!‚Äù That‚Äôs when Sophie dropped a bombshell: ‚ÄúOh, about that‚ÄîAbby hates you.‚Äù

I was shocked and asked her to explain. Sophie made me swear not to confront anyone, then told me Janie had supposedly told Abby that I hated her and didn‚Äôt want to hang out with her. Months earlier, I‚Äôd vented to Janie that Abby didn‚Äôt really ‚Äúfill my cup‚Äù anymore and that hanging out with her felt different, but I never said I hated her.

The next day, I had a double date planned with Janie and couldn‚Äôt keep this to myself. I asked her about it, and she admitted that Abby had texted her after we all hung out, saying she wanted nothing to do with me. Janie responded by saying I felt the same.

Even though we cleared the air, I still felt uneasy. When Sophie later asked if I‚Äôd confronted Janie, I told her the truth, which led to a huge fight between us. After days of arguing, I asked to meet in person to talk, but Sophie refused.

At that point, I realized Sophie had been a terrible friend to me for years. I was only holding onto our friendship because of how long we‚Äôd known each other. I texted her, explaining that I couldn‚Äôt be in her wedding and that our friendship wasn‚Äôt healthy. I haven‚Äôt heard from her since.

So, Reddit, AITAH for pulling out of her wedding and ending our 20+ year friendship?

1h0288q,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1h0288q/aita_for_saying_this_to_my_wife/,AITA for saying this to my wife,"Background: 
My wife is a stay at home mom by her choice having finished her Bachelor's degree and then getting hit with what I'm about to explain. This derailed her plans to jump into Physician Assistant school (2 years all year round intensive). We homeschool, but it's mostly self guided since the kids are teenagers now.

For the last 2 years, my wife has been struggling through getting a diagnosis of IBS, pancreatitus, and very low functioning gall bladder. I have supported her and been very understanding while she was on a severely restricted diet (low fodmap and vegetarian plus an elimination diet multiple times). 

During this first year, she was mostly laid up in bed with ileus and intense gastro pain, so I did everything. This included cooking separately for her while making dinner for me and the kids after coming home from work everyday and meal prepping during the weekend for lunches during the week.

In the last year, she has mostly figured out what she can and can't eat, but still has flare ups, so she mostly handles her food on her own. I still often cook in the evening for me and the kids after getting home from work and will include her in the dinner planning when that works for her based on her calorie needs. She also got into Crossfit as a way to gain back some of her strength; she's in perimenopause, so she's concerned with not being able to get it back. This part has been absolutely amazing and I've been incredibly supportive and excited for her achievements. 

Current issue: This past week at work has been grueling, so in the evenings, after dinner, my wife and I have sat down and enjoyed watching Outlander together. This was lovely and I thought things were going well. 

We're hosting Thanksgiving, bit not until Sunday rather than doing it on Thursday due to work schedules of our older kids that are moved out. So, there was a lot of house cleaning that needed to happen, which I figured her and the kids could do most of while I was at work since they are all capable. I also knew I'd have to do a good bit over the weekend and probably a good bit on Thursday as well since I'm off. My birthday is on Friday, so I figured we'd be busy doing something as a family together as well. Then, I figured we'd be doing food prep on Saturday. I was ready for all of this. 

This past Saturday, before we had our morning coffee together, she basically told me that I was going to be renting a carpet shampooer and shampooing the carpets. Something to understand is that the morning coffee on Saturday is a little ritual we have together and, by her request, we are not to talk about anything relating to work or tasks before we're done with coffee.

I was overwhelmed by the thought of having to do that, one because I've done it before and it's a lot of work, partly because we have a high energy dog, and two because we have a lot of furniture on the carpets with very little space to move them, so it's a multi step process.
I also have AuDHD, so sudden changes to plans and routines are very difficult for me to process.

 I expressed that I was overwhelmed by that, was not ready to do that given all of the other cleaning that needed to happen, and that it's an huge job to do that  I was not prepared to do. She got very irritated with me and started badgering me about doing it, so I just shut down and said no, I was not doing it. A little bit later when I tried to have a conversation about how it had been a tough week at work, I needed some downtime, and was still going to be cleaning most of the weekend, but was not going to be shampooing the carpet, she got very angry with me and was acting agfronted that I wouldn't shampoo the carpets. 

I suggested that she just do it while I'm at work after we have cleaned the rest of the house. She proceeded to explain how difficult the last week has been for her because of her IBS issues and how she couldn't do much. I brought up that I felt like she was ultimately making everything my responsibility. She got quite the attitude with me and indicated that I should be thankful for what she can do when she's feeling okay. She then went on to describe how it's difficult for her to do anything physical when she's having a flare up, which lasts for days, and how it's unpredictable so she can't count on when she will be capable of doing that sort of physical work. 

At this point I was having a lot of trouble processing my emotions, dealing with the attitude I was getting, and trying to think through having a reasonable conversation about my feelings and why it was so tough for me that she brought that up before coffee. So, here's the AITA part, I said ""So what you're saying is that I have a disabled partner and everything is ultimately my responsibility?""

It went completely sideways at that point with her getting very angry. How dare I label her, it's not my place to say that she's disabled, etc! I tried to explain that I was only saying back to her what she said, in my words, so I can confirm I understand. In addition to me having AuDHD, she is very ADHD, so it becomes rather challenging to follow her when she's emotional or distracted. So, I find it necessary to try to condense it when she says paragraphs of words to say a sentence worth of meaning. I've found that if I don't do that, then I often walk away with a misunderstanding, which has lead to arguments with her in the past.

I opted to work on cleaning parts of the house away from her all weekend because she was throwing so much shade at me whenever I was near, tried to initiate any pleasant conversation, or offer her help on the part of the house she was working on that was not shampooing the floor. She was also completely capable of shampooing the carpet herself since she said she was feeling great that day. Now today, she's bothered that I didn't ask how I could help getting the carpet shampooed, so I'm at a loss. 

I tried to explain that I had a hard week at work and she was being very unpleasant to be around, so I opted to do something useful around the house in preparation for Thanksgiving while not being around her. That also wasn't good enough because,  despite saying it needed done, the parts of the house I was working on weren't as important as the rooms she was working on. I agree, but then we would have had to work together and since that wasn't happening, nothing would have gotten done. At least this way we accomplished a lot.",1,1732591354.0,AmItheAsshole,2,1.0,False

I've been a Nespresso drinker, and only got into pour over coffee \~ 3 months ago. Since then, I've been buying coffee from Intelligentsia website (ground to V60 coarseness) and the local coffee shop (asked them to grind it for me). I'm aware that ground coffee go stale quickly, so I always finish mine within a month.

While the coffee I get isn't as fresh, this has been a ""satisficing"" solution.

Now, when it comes to actually tasting the coffee notes, I have to admit my palate isn't sharp at all. I can rarely pick up the notes described on the packages. I can only distinguish between sour vs bitter, and that's really it. Buying coffee beans feels like buying a fantasy ... all the notes sound amazing but I can't really tell.  lol

Nonetheless, I still enjoy picking out coffee beans, and the calming ritual of making pour overs.

**Now I'm really on the fence of whether to get a grinder** (specifically, Fellow Ode 2, because we have their kettle; I really like the look of Ode 2; the 20% off makes the price more acceptable).

I feel like as a novice who can't tell better, I don't really NEED a grinder. And I can continue to get beans ground by the makers / coffee shops.

Not all beans are offered pre-ground, so I miss out on that, but it's not like I'm a coffee connoisseur.

I guess what I'm really worried about is that, after buying a grinder, I'd want to buy a digital scale, and the next thing, the next thing ... that I'll just be opening a floodgate when my taste buds aren't refined enough to appreciate the upgrades.

I'm also aware that I'm posting on a sub that's not neutral at all. ;) But really, **I just really need some opinions to talk me IN or OUT of buying a grinder.**

I am a dude who wants to become a monk and I have been practicing not having attachments, expectations or desires, I have always been a kind protector type esp to gals, i really enjoy caring for them and making them happy, I would describe myself as a jesus/ guardian angel, jim carrey type dude because I want gals to do well, improve, be happy and even find a suitable dude to date even if that means they dont have time for me

I also tend to be the main funny/ chill/ silly dude where people laugh around me, with me or at me lol, I did quit dating permanently about 6 yrs ago as I came to the conclusion that most of my depression came from how people treated me esp gals and that kindness was not appealing or attractive, I did do a trial where I acted as a douchebag and I had way more luck in dating but it just didn‚Äôt feel right to treat people badly and I didn‚Äôt want to do that so quitting was my only option, i have been celibate for over a decade, when I was dating I preferred to wait till marriage or at least a yr or something, I do live in a city with brothels, I am just not really super into all that stuff unless its with a gal I really care about, I also stopped touching people and will only be a recipient of hugs, shakes, fives, fist bumps, etc; I will not initiate physical contact, also unless its business related I don‚Äôt really ask people for their contact details and I don‚Äôt invite people to spend time with me, I make indirect suggestions, I don‚Äôt do flirting cause there is no point as I don‚Äôt want people developing an interest in me romantically as I wont reciprocate

After covid hit i basically became a hermit, didnt really talk to people or go anywhere, just stayed home playing games and watching movies, after 4 yrs i decided to leave hermitville and i took a trip recently where I met a gal working at a hostel, she was hanging with a few other people, I joined in and was talking with all of them and making them laugh, i became aware that she was Mexican and was self taught in Ingles, she also taught Espanol for her other job remotely

After that we had talked a few more times while she was cooking/ having a meal as it was a social kitchen, I did offer her some of my fried rice to which she declined and we talked for about 30 mins, don‚Äôt remember the context but she mentioned how some relationships can be toxic, I said I think most are since most people care about how you make them feel rather than making caring about them and that I recommend all people be single and focus on internal happiness rather than external, I explained how I arrived at that conclusion giving examples such as how if a boy cheats on a girl, she would cheat on him so that he feels the pain she felt or to get revenge, which IMO is toxic as you shouldn‚Äôt want to hurt people that you care about even if they hurt you, she said it all made sense and that I was smart, she reached over to give me a hihg five and left

We met again the next night while she was cooking, i joked that she never offered me anything so she made me a taco, I told her If she wanted i would help her reach level B2 for free in Ingles as she was A2 right now but i also said IMO she was totally fluent, she said it would take 6 mth, i said i believed in her and that it would take 4, I also encouraged her to practice conversation with others more, she lacked confidence and felt that people would judge her, I tend to encourage people to not feel embarrassed about having a 2^(nd)¬†language and that it‚Äôs a great accomplishment and that people would not judge her, so essentially I complimented her abilities and wanted her to continue improving, later she gave me a fist bump and left

Every time I come in the room that she is in she tends to become smiley and laughs, the next night we met and she asked when I was leaving I told her in about 48 hrs or so but I could change my flight for free, I asked if she had a vegan meal before and she said no, I mentioned the name of a place and said if we go and she hates the taste I will pay for hit, she joked saying she hated it, but agreed to go, she said a bit later in a low semi anxious voice that I needed to change my flight so that we could go, she also said she had about 6 hrs before her shift so IMO it looked as though she really wanted me to extend my trip, she gave me another five and left, BUT the next night she came into the kitchen with groceries ready to cook a meal and I said are you ready to go, she said she forgot, I told her if she changed her mind that it was totally fine and I wouldn‚Äôt be hurt, but she said no and lets go now

We went and on the way there she kept crashing into the wall, so I made a joke saying she was avoiding me and I went across the street to the other side and stayed for a few blocks occasionally waving to her, she laughed the entire time and kept pleading with me to return, so I did and the wall crashing stopped, while talking I gave her some advice to get new clients, offered to help her with a freelance profile and, she genuinely felt as though she appreciated the ideas, said they were great and was thankful, I also helped her a bit with her Ingles

We had the meal, I paid for it all, although she offered to split, on the way to the hostel, she said we could go to a museum but on the way there she realized it was closed, but tmrw we could go while they are open, she went to work after we spent about 3 hrs together

Later that night other guests and staff members were going to a dance bar, I declined the invites, after her shift she told me to go, I said I don‚Äôt dance and it was too loud for me, she said we could just go to a quiet area, so we got there, took our seats, she asked if I wanted to dance, I said I don‚Äôt know how, she went to bathroom but afterwards she went over to talk to people, after about 5 mins, the band played and it got way too loud so I passed by her and went to the quiet area and stayed for about 30 mins, the band left so I returned and she hit me and asked me where I went, then she was talking with a hostel guest she just met 30 mins ago about plans to go to the beach tmrw, I said did you forget again, we were going to the museum, she said I had already been and I said no I have not, a few mins later some went to the quiet area and she grabbed me and leaded me to come join them, and we did talk a bit and she mentioned the beach thing to me, I said you will probably go before noon and I don‚Äôt wake till noon, after that we didn‚Äôt talk much, while I was AWOL for those 30 mins she could have looked for me so idk, she did touch me several times during this night, and as i want to be a monk i did not touch her at all, i never complimented her looks either

I woke at noon and apparently she had went with the gal she just met and some other guests to the beach, she knew that my flight was leaving around 6, she didn‚Äôt return to say bye or anything and well now im home lol, since I don‚Äôt have attachments or desires im not hurt but I do find the situation puzzling as she canceled our plans, made new plans with a stranger, didn‚Äôt wait for me to join the new beach plans or to return and say bye

Her coworker told me he really wanted her to spend more time with me since i tend to elevate people when im around

Something similar happened a few yrs ago with a girl named say Sally, i met her at a parade and invited her to hang, she agreed, i brought her to meet some of my friends and we also spent time just the 2 of us, after a few hrs it was time for her to go home, i asked to exchange info, she declined, i was surprised but that was her choice so i left

A few yrs later i was driving and a bombshell blonde was excitedly waving at me and it was Sally, about 30 mins later i came across her and we talked, she took my info and after that she would basically invite me to hang with her all the time it was if she had no other people in her life and i was her BFF, she was actually my dream gal and I was completely interested in her, she was a goddess, but since this 2nd time i met her after I quit dating, I had to stick to my decisions, i even helped her to talk to some dudes she was into, we had spent about 2 yrs together and it was totally platonic, at some point I put her in my will to leave all my $$ to her, I didn‚Äôt tell her though, I also gave her a letter in a sealed envelope that said to only look at it if I wasn‚Äôt in her life anymore

The letter essentially said that I really cared about her and that I would do anything for her and that it was possible for people to care about her and not want anything in return, I gave her this letter cause I knew at some point she would do something and I would remove her from my life as that has been the case with most people I have met, but even though we weren‚Äôt friends I still wanted her to have the letter as a reminder of how much she was cared for and how much she meant to me

Well we went on a quick on a trip after a gal that we both knew wanted some driving companions, she didn‚Äôt spend time with us at all aside from the drive there, as she was going to meet her other friend, after about a wk, she came to get us to go home, Sally wanted to hang a bit with her before going home, thus abandoning the plans we had made a few hrs before, I told Sally it was over and didn‚Äôt talk to her again, a mth later she messaged me wanting to meet, I said we were over and that she could look at the letter, I also sent her a page from my will which showed Sallys name, she told me she was crying, but I have a 0 tolerance policy when it comes to disrespect even if she was my dream goddess, if she had asked me if it was alright to change our plans that would have been different and respectful

A few yrs later she messaged me and we did chat a bit cause im jesus polite lol, I had moved to Mexico at that point though so she was still in the Seattle area and its not as if she could just ask me to meet her for coffee, i left her about 6 yrs ago, i still think about her and still luv her, but alas i must remain firm in my decisions to not give 2nd chances

There have been a few other instances where gals I have known had contacted me a few mth or yrs later after I terminated the friendship, to say that they realize I had treated them better than any other individual they have met

I was also very caring to my lil sis, essentially we were besties, I would buy her things and buy her salon appointments, would help her with anything, she was weird though as her friend and i became interested in each other and instead of supporting it she gave her friend an ultimatum to be her friend or to date me, the friend chose to remain friends, a few yrs later my sis did something to me and I stopped talking to her, she barely tried to repair the relationship and well now its been over a decade since we talked

About a decade ago i met a gal at an international event, she was very pretty but she was 16, I sort of adopted her as my little sis and she would call me big bro, I would give her life and dating advice, I had moved across the country soon after we met though so we mostly just did vid calls or chats, she even sent me a physical letter in the mail saying how much she appreciated me being her bro, but alas a few yrs later she did something similar with ditching me, she admitted to being a bad friend to which I agreed and we haven‚Äôt talked since AND NO even after she became an adult i never flirted or made a move on her, i even introduced her to some single dudes

So as the title said, why are gals not a fan of having/ keeping a jesus type dude in their life who wants nothing from them but their happiness, wants them to do well in life, encourages them, mentors them, gives them support and advice etc; IMO if I had a man or woman treat me this way I would feel as if I had won the lottery, Sally rejected me initially but then 2 yrs later was so excited to meet me again, i dont get it lol

I have no regrets in spending time or $$ on these gals, i was happy with those moments and i had 0 expectations, i will prob return to hermitville though as i rather not have to be puzzled by this stuff",0,1732591097.0,AskGirls,1,0.33,False

Every year, we end up spending Halloween together. Context: neither of them have a car or a license. Any time we hang out, I‚Äôm the driver. The weekend before Halloween, I ask them if they want to go out. They agreed, so I told them I‚Äôd call my sister and see if she wanted to meet up, too. She did, and they were in a better part of town, so we agree to meet her there. The older friend (I‚Äôll call her Amy), asks: ‚Äúwill you be getting the food as well?‚Äù I let them know I bar snacks pare probably within the budget. That‚Äôs okay with them. I‚Äôm okay with paying our covers. 
We get to the bar, the cover is $10, so I pay for us to get in. We step to the side and start talking about where to go, and immediately, Amy and (I‚Äôll call her) Megan come up to us and tell us they‚Äôre leaving. I ask to go where, and they say that one of them is having an anxiety attack and they‚Äôre just gonna hang out in a coffee shop around the corner. I‚Äôm a bit pissed that I just paid $20 for them to open the door and then leave, but I can‚Äôt keep them anywhere so I tell them we‚Äôll meet them when we‚Äôre leaving. A few hours later, I call them to see where they‚Äôre at, because my sister and I are going to a different bar. They said they were out getting food. I tell them where we‚Äôll be, and not an hour later, they text me that they‚Äôre ‚Äúnot having a good time‚Äù and they‚Äôre getting an Uber home which they ask me to pay for. I didn‚Äôt see their text until way later, because we were at the bar. I see it and ask if they got home okay. They say yes, but that they ‚Äúfeel really abandoned rn‚Äù.  Halloween rolls around, and I had a really important licensure exam from 8a-2p. My phone had to be powered off during that time. We had plans to meet up around 6 that night to hang out. I power up my phone after the test, and I have SEVEN BACK TO BACK MISSED CALLS from Amy. I check my texts, and Amy is apparently freaking out because she‚Äôs ‚Äúbeen sending memes on Instagram and hasn‚Äôt heard anything‚Äù from me for five days. That‚Äôs a normal amount of time for us to just send memes back and forth without any other kind of conversation. I resolve to gather my thoughts on the drive home from the test facility and respond then. Except Amy proceeds to call my TWENTY. TIMES. on the drive. I get a call from my mom‚Ä¶that Amy just tried to call her, and TWO messages from my sister that Amy messaged ‚Äúis [me] alive?? It‚Äôs been five days and they haven‚Äôt texted me!‚Äù to both her main and photography account. I text them and tell them that I‚Äôm not happy with their behavior the previous Saturday and that they‚Äôre not entitled to my time like this. All Amy keeps saying is that she ‚Äújust wants a few seconds of communication‚Äù and ‚Äúnot talking to me for five days is disturbing and unsettling‚Äù. I end up telling them that I can‚Äôt be responsible for their feelings like this. I blocked their numbers and unfollowed them on everything. AITA?",1,1732591067.0,AmItheAsshole,11,0.67,False
1h024v4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1h024v4/communication_has_disappeared/,Communication has disappeared ,"I (29m) matched with a girl (30) on a dating app. We talked for several days, typical intro conversation. I then asked her if she was free on the weekend, no response for 4 days. Figured she just ghosted. She messages back apologizing that she's been on vacay out of the country, hasn't been checking the app. I don't make much a big deal of it, we keep talking that week but not like talking every minute of every hour. We are both busy so like every 4-6 hours we'd each respond, sometimes longer. I ask her out to brunch, she agrees. She warns me that shes on call, and may get called in. No problem, told her thanks for the heads up and made a back-up plan for a simple coffee run if she got called in during the date. She even gives me her number before the 1st date, and I didn't even ask for it.

The day of the date arrives, I'm there first and put us on waiting list. She arrives, we greet and a quick hug, we talk a bit and then our tables ready. And from then on, conversation is just FLOWING, no awkward breaks, laughs and flirting, had alot of similar interests. We forget to order our food in the first 30 mins because we just kept talking, we do eventually order and eat. She spilled water on the table telling a story and got embarrassed, I thought it was adorable. 2.5 hours later, she still didn't get called in, so asked her if she wanted to check out the coffee house that was the back up plan. She agreed, we walk to the coffee house, order coffee, and talk for another 2 hrs. This was downtown of the city, she lived downtown. Date was 4-4.5 hrs long. She let me walk her back to her apartment, I gave her a hug and kiss on the cheek as a goodbye. I've been on plenty of first dates, and some were good. BUT THIS DATE, I was on Cloud Nine, the dopamine high I had driving home....NOTHING could ruin my day.

Get home, text her I made it back safe and that i had an amazing time, she said she had a great time too. We set up a 2nd date the following week, we talked ALL WEEK long. Again, her job INSANELY busy (medical field) and I appreciated she made time for our dates. 2nd date, she had to work in the afternoon so was free for the morning, which meant I couldn't elevate the 2nd date to like Top Golf or Axe throwing, ya know something interactive. So we did another brunch date, no big deal. And the conversation was still flowing and good, we talked about our last week and weekend. But she seemed a little off, at least thats what I perceived. And maybe I imagined it or she was distracted because she told me she was about to work the night shift the upcoming week. 2nd date was only 1.5 hours as she had to go to work an hour earlier than expected. Again walk her back, kiss her cheek but she leans in and kisses me. Drive home, text her I had a great time, she texts she had a good time. (1st date was ""Great"", 2nd was ""good"" according to her)

And from then on, communication died off. I sent the last message. And I figured ""night shift, super busy, no big deal"" but went a whole week of no reply at all. My mental went haywire, but I held it together to give her the space and trust that she was just insanely busy with night shift. I asked a friend from work (girl) whom i shared with her what happened for her perspective, she told me ""yeah she's probably busy BUUUT a quick text message isn't alot either, doesn't have to be a whole conversation but a quick 'hey super busy, night shift is rough' isn't asking alot and if shes interested she can send that easily"". Because I started thinking I did something wrong, or another guy, she ghosted, etc. The Saturday after I decided to send a text asking how the night shift went, and figured ""if she responds, GREAT. If she doesn't...i knew it would hurt if she didnt"". She responds like 2 hrs later apologizing saying that she got sick and night shift has been rough, and the week has been so busy for her.

Didn't see her message for a few hours but felt relief when I saw it and the stress and anxiety went away. I texted her back. And now...BACK TO NOTHING üò≠. No messages since Saturday again, idk if she's still on nights but it's been causing my brain to go up and down. In 2 weeks, only 1 message. I know people will say ""shes busy"" but im not asking for every second of every hour of every day, even just 1 message every other day is fine with me considering how busy she is. I'm mature enough to understand that. And I started to really like this girl, it's been almost 2 months of us talking. Unfortunately only 2 dates, which I know people will say isn't much but both of us busy and dating nowadays is so tough, and to have such a great 1st date, that dopamine high, thats something I haven't felt in a long time...if this just dies out, the disappointment for me is just gonna be a lot üò¢ I also want to clarify, I paid for both dates without hesitation, I make good money and was more than happy to pay.",1,1732591051.0,dating,1,1.0,False

I recently realized I have a direct correlation to water aversion and depression, and happiness and being hydrated. Hear me out. 

Sometimes I go through phases where I have a really strong aversion to drinking water. I‚Äôll drink coffee and apple cider and whatever else is around (non-alcoholic, this isn‚Äôt an alcohol related issue), but sometimes I will go two or three days with only drinking a sip or two of water. I‚Äôll even be incredibly thirsty in the afternoon once I‚Äôve finished my coffee, but I will almost subconsciously go out of my way to not drink water. I don‚Äôt do it on purpose, but I know I‚Äôm doing it. These periods directly correlate to when I am down and depressed. My depression usually lasts longer, but I get to a point where I literally forced myself to drink water because I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm going to get a kidney infection. Sometimes I‚Äôll even wait until I feel a little pain in my backside before I force myself to drink water.

Conversely, the happier I seem to be the more water I drink. When I‚Äôm going through a phases of being really happy and not depressed, I drink a lot more water. But I don‚Äôt feel happier because I‚Äôm drinking more water.. It‚Äôs not like one day. Just decide to drink a bunch of water and then I‚Äôm happy. It‚Äôs the opposite. 

I get this probably sounds pretty crazy but I thought I would see if there might be any rhyme or reason behind this. I‚Äôve been doing this pattern for years and just put it together, but the pattern is about as black-and-white as it can be it now that I‚Äôve realized it. ",1,1732591027.0,therapy,1,1.0,False

He suggested that we catch up over coffee so we did. Overall the tone was platonic and I brought up his wife and mentioned my boyfriend, but some of these things threw me off: he asked if I live alone, engaged in a lot of longing eye gazing (I‚Äôm cautious of this as I often see this as a form of manipulation), asked about my personal life (could be casual?), and divulged very personal details about family trauma and having a vasectomy (lol?!).

After this, he asked me to go on a hike with him soon, but cancelled later. 

So, is this friendly? A crush? Ego-boosting flirtation? Potentially some cheating or ENM scenario? I like him as a person but I‚Äôm not interested in him or any form of non-monogamy. ",1,1732590798.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

Another line, a much smaller line, had somebody donate gas cards for every person on the line.

Let‚Äôs talk about the Meet and Greet (M&G). In my experience, a coffee or a cocktail is the perfect setting for that initial meeting. It‚Äôs casual, low-pressure, and doesn‚Äôt require a significant time commitment. You can gauge chemistry over an espresso or a martini without committing to a full evening.

Yet, I‚Äôve noticed a trend: so many women insist on turning the M&G into a dinner date. Now, I enjoy fine dining as much as the next man, but I‚Äôm puzzled why dinner has become the default expectation for a first meeting.

Here‚Äôs my perspective: 

1. **Time Investment:** Dinner can easily stretch over two hours. If the connection isn‚Äôt there, that‚Äôs a significant amount of time to spend in an unfulfilling situation. A coffee or cocktail allows for a graceful exit if things don‚Äôt click. 

2. **Atmosphere:** Casual settings foster relaxed conversations. Without the formality of a dinner, both parties can be themselves, making it easier to establish genuine rapport. 

3. **Financial Consideration:** While I‚Äôm more than willing to invest in a memorable evening, I prefer to reserve that for when there‚Äôs mutual interest. Jumping straight into an expensive dinner feels premature before establishing basic compatibility.

**So, why the insistence on dinner?**

Is it about experiencing a lavish evening upfront? A test to see how much we‚Äôre willing to invest? Or perhaps it‚Äôs simply a misunderstanding of what an M&G is meant to be?

**My Approach:**

I‚Äôve started being upfront about my preferences. When arranging the M&G, I suggest meeting at a chic caf√© or an upscale lounge for drinks. I make it clear that I value a setting where we can talk openly without the distractions of a formal dinner.

Most of the time, this is well-received. However, there are occasions when a woman insists on dinner. In such cases, I politely explain that I prefer a more casual first meeting to see if we have a connection worth exploring further.

**Curious to Hear Your Thoughts:** 

* What are your go-to settings for an M&G? 
* Have you encountered the dinner expectation, and how do you handle it?
*  Do you think insisting on a casual meeting filters out those with mismatched expectations?",1,1732590373.0,sugardaddyhangout,0,1.0,False

I've been on a mission to find the perfect coffee machine for my home, and I thought I'd share my journey with you all. After months of research and testing different machines, I think I've finally cracked the code on what makes a great home coffee maker.

I used to spend way too much money at coffee shops (we've all been there, right?), so I decided it was time to invest in a quality machine for my kitchen. The amount I've saved since making this switch is honestly incredible.

First things first - let's talk about what you should consider when buying a coffee machine for your home:

1. Brewing Capacity: Are you brewing for yourself or the whole family?
2. Counter Space: Those fancy machines look great, but make sure you have room!
3. Budget: You don't need to break the bank for good coffee
4. Features: Auto-start? Temperature control? Strength settings?

After trying several options, I found some amazing machines that tick all these boxes. You can check them out here: https://athometouch.com/coffeemachine

I personally love machines with programmable features. There's nothing better than waking up to the smell of fresh coffee! But here's the thing - the best coffee machine for your home really depends on your specific needs.

If you're a casual coffee drinker, a simple drip coffee maker might be perfect. But if you're like me and love experimenting with different brewing styles, you might want something more versatile.

One game-changing tip I've learned: investing in a machine with a built-in grinder makes a HUGE difference in taste. Fresh ground coffee is seriously next level!

I've found some great deals on coffee machines that fit different budgets and preferences. You can browse through various options here: https://athometouch.com/coffeemachine

Some key features I recommend looking for:
- Water filtration system
- Temperature control
- Easy cleaning mechanism
- Durability (check those warranties!)
- User-friendly interface

Remember, a good coffee machine is an investment in your daily happiness. I can't tell you how much better my mornings are now that I have quality coffee at home.

Don't forget about maintenance! Regular cleaning and descaling will keep your machine running perfectly for years. I learned this the hard way with my first machine üòÖ

1h01uuo,https://www.reddit.com/r/fidelityhealth/comments/1h01uuo/building_sustainable_habits_from_shannon_csapilla/,Building Sustainable Habits from Shannon Csapilla,"Okay, hear me out. Shannon Csapilla is this wealth management pro who helps people save money and plan for retirement. Sounds super finance-y, right? But the more I read about her, the more I realized her principles apply to way more than just money‚Äîthey‚Äôre basically a blueprint for building sustainable habits in life.

Like, I started thinking: what if we treated our health, fitness, and mental well-being like she treats financial planning? I‚Äôm not a finance guy, but I am someone trying to build better routines, and honestly, her approach made so much sense.

# Start Small, Stay Consistent

Shannon‚Äôs big on ‚Äúpaying yourself first.‚Äù For finances, that means saving a little bit of money before spending it. For us? That‚Äôs like setting aside time for yourself‚Äîyour workout, your mindfulness practice, your sleep‚Äî*before* you get caught up in the chaos of life.

It doesn‚Äôt have to be huge. Five push-ups a day? Boom, that‚Äôs a win. Drinking a glass of water before your coffee? That‚Äôs a win too. The point is, small habits done consistently are like little deposits that grow into big results over time.

# Track It to Hack It

She‚Äôs all about tracking her money so she knows where it‚Äôs going. The same applies to our lives. You don‚Äôt need to track everything (unless you‚Äôre into that), but keeping tabs on key stuff like your workouts, meals, or even how much sleep you‚Äôre getting can be a game-changer.

For me, I started tracking how much time I spend scrolling on my phone. Turns out, I was burning HOURS doing nothing. That little reality check made me rethink how I use my evenings.

# Diversify Your Life Investments

In finance, Shannon talks about not putting all your eggs in one basket (aka risk diversification). Life‚Äôs the same. You can‚Äôt just focus on one thing and expect everything else to fall into place.

Like, if you‚Äôre crushing it at the gym but eating garbage and sleeping 5 hours a night, it‚Äôs gonna catch up with you. Balance your ‚Äúinvestments‚Äù‚Äîa little fitness, some mindfulness, good nutrition, time with friends. Spread the love.

# Have a Plan for Life‚Äôs Chaos

Shannon always talks about emergency funds for unexpected expenses. In life, we need those emergency plans too. What‚Äôs your go-to when life gets overwhelming? A quick walk? A simple, healthy meal you can make in 5 minutes?

I keep a playlist of songs that instantly chill me out, and I‚Äôve got a 10-minute yoga video saved for when my brain is fried. Those little ‚Äúemergency funds‚Äù keep me from spiraling when things get stressful.

# Long-Term Gains Over Short-Term Wins

Here‚Äôs the kicker: Shannon‚Äôs whole thing is about compounding interest. Small, consistent actions grow over time. The same applies to life habits. You might not notice the benefit of meditating for 5 minutes today, but do that every day for a year? It‚Äôs like a snowball rolling downhill.

So yeah, Shannon Csapilla might be talking about finances, but her principles are basically a guide for anyone trying to build a balanced, healthy life. Start small. Stay consistent. Track your progress. Prepare for the unexpected. And always keep your eyes on the long game.",2,1732590200.0,fidelityhealth,0,1.0,False

1h01n6m,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuitVaping/comments/1h01n6m/i_quit_friday_and_feel_great/,I quit Friday and feel great,"I don't know what changed in me cause I can't tell you how many times I planned to quit and popped out for a new vape within 30 mins of it running out.

Anyway I ran out Friday at 11:30pm and the shop shuts at midnight. I'd usually go grab one but this time I figure I'll leave it and grab it the next day, but when Saturday hits I just figure I'll hold out longer...

I have no idea why, I wasn't particularly planning to quit, but once I'd put a bit of time in I was kinda like 'well I've come this far...'.

So anyway I went and got some sugar free gum as that helped me quit weed years ago - something to chew, a sort of replacement for the act of vaping.

Now I've been quite the hermit for the last few years, barely going out, not exercising and eating poorly, so I figured I'd go for a walk. Since Friday night I've been out walking every night, even swimming and sauna afterwards too. This night not sound like much but it's been huge for me, I think hermit was grossly underselling what I became.

On top of that I've been researching healthy meals, prepped healthy chicken and veg for the week and switched from Pepsi to coffee and honied tea. I get that it's just been a few days but I feel amazing.

Now the one thing that has sucked, and this always got me going back to vaping honestly, is how poorly I sleep when I quit. So I am fighting through that now though I think getting exercise has helped.

But really I just wanted to share even if nobody listens. And if anyone is in my boat, maybe try gum, focusing on a few healthy lifestyle distractions and also not letting your thoughts dwell on vaping if you find yourself thinking about it.

And if anyone has any healthy, simple clean meal tips or other tips (like how long it will take to fix my sleeping) I'd love to hear them.",9,1732589546.0,QuitVaping,1,1.0,False

1h01mb9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1h01mb9/husband_makes_me_feel_like_a_shitty_mother_even/,Husband makes me feel like a shitty mother (even though I‚Äôm not) and it hurts ,"I(35F) got into a huge fight with my husband(38M) today. Let me give you a quick backstory - Our (first) baby was born in May of this year, and we‚Äôve both been back at work since August, we work full-time and remotely from home. His job is busier than mine and he has a ton of calls every day. I‚Äôm from a culture where you don‚Äôt send your baby to daycare until at least 1 year, so I wanted to keep her home until 6 months at least. My husband said he‚Äôs fine with that but won‚Äôt have much time during the day to help me, which I said is fine. Well, now she‚Äôs still not in daycare because we only got a daycare spot for January. Soon. 

My days having her home while working have been very hard. I‚Äôve felt very stressed out, but I never thought it was the wrong decision keeping her home. I‚Äôm with her 90% of the time between 9 and 5, I do all the feedings, all the diapers, playing, everything. My husband doesnt help during the day most of the time, which - again- is fine. I know how busy he is. It‚Äôs all good and I‚Äôm ok with being stressed out and having to get some stuff done in the after hours. It‚Äôs only for a short amount of time. 

But then, today - my husband had been snappy to me all morning, and he would passive aggressively say things like ‚Äòwell I went outside with X (our daughters name) already‚Äô and it‚Äôs such nice weather, you know‚Äô. At some point I was like, ‚ÄòIs there anything you‚Äôd like to tell me?‚Äô And he goes ‚ÄòI just don‚Äôt get it. Instead of going outside with her and doing stuff, you just sit home all day.‚Äô He proceeded to tell me that he thinks I‚Äôm lazy and sitting at home all day and that I should be out going for walks with X, going to the park with her, and doing other activities, instead of sitting at home.

I couldn‚Äôt believe it. I‚Äôm working full-time. I can‚Äôt just leave and be out for hours. And having X around me all day means that one task can take hours. He said well why don‚Äôt you just go somewhere with her while you work. I reminded him that I tried that multiple times, like taking her to a coffee shop or the public pool, and it was impossible to get any work done because she was fussing and I just had to watch her nonstop. At home it‚Äôs easier to get work done because it‚Äôs baby proof, she has all her toys here etc. also, I‚Äôm working around her feedings, which are still every 2-2.5h, and her naps, which are all over the place. 

He then pointed out again how he does do activities with X every time he does have time during the day. I told him that yea of course, he has HOURS every single day to focus on his work, if I had that I would also have more time to take X out, but no, I‚Äôm just scrambling all day to get work done with her by my side. Also, I reminded him that I literally take her out at least once every day. Today I took her swimming in the afternoon, actually. I take her in at least one walk every single day. But usually in the afternoon. 

My husband said he still doesn‚Äôt get it and thinks I just sit at home all day while I could be doing more stuff. I told him that he‚Äôs behaving like an asshole and has no right to judge me. He has never even fed X solids once. Not once! I feed her most of her bottles every day, I do most of her diapers, I put her down for naps, I give her solids every day (I cook food for her etc). He has never bought toys for her either. Which, again, would be ok for me during the week. But him having the audacity to judge me and act this way, knowing that he has hours every day to focus on work, while never even worrying about feeding her, changing her etc. 

He‚Äôs making me feel like a terrible mother, while I know I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôve been crying and told him to sleep in the other room. He left and has not apologized. This might sound crazy, but I‚Äôve honestly been thinking about just taking the baby and leaving him for a while. I know that‚Äôs extreme and I‚Äôm not gonna do that, but I just feel so sad and hurt.

If anyone finds it, I'd be happy to remedy that.

I recently acquired a V1 Silvia in excellent shape. The non-adjustable OPV was set to around 10.5 bar, and I want to do single dosing with a non-pressurized basket, so I needed to lower it. I had already replaced the spring and gasket in the valve with new ones from Stefanos. 

I found a post where someone had simply added extra copper washers to reduce the tension on the spring and lower the pressure. The ones I got were M17 \* 21mm \* 1.0 mm. However, adding a single extra 1 mm thick washer dropped the pressure down to 6-7 bars! It's shocking that such a small change could make such a big difference, and I've had several arguments with my partner about how that seems to violate Hooke's Law of Spring Tension!

The original washer was 0.9-1mm.  I ended up having to hammer the washers flatter, and the final thickness that got me from 10.5 to 9 bars was 1.1mm, only 0.1-0.2 mm difference! I'm kind of shocked my skill-free tippy-tapping got the job done, but it worked, and was super cheap. I had to beat down two washers that together were the 1.1 mm thick when I was done. Also keep in mind that the reason copper washers are used here is because they crush a little when you crank down the brass, so it's better to bias on the side of too thick, since you can't unflatten the washers if you make them too thin. It did require a \*lot\* of trial and error.

Now my bestie lets call her Helen recently broke up with her girlfriend of 3 years. Now her ex decided to burn all the stuff she left at her place and Helen decided to do the same.

I should note that we had water to stop the fire, the fire was so small you can pretty much blow it out and we didn't just leave it.

Now while watching the fire we heard a shout coming from the houses right a cross.. it was an old man in his 60's yelling ""extinguish the fire"". We immediately did and ran out of the abandond house.

Now as we were going home we passed the mans house (it was a... not in shape man) and he started screaming ""ARE YOU CRAZY WHY DID YOU START THE FIRE"" and honestly we acted dumb then the man yelled ""IM GONNA BEAT YOUR PU\*\*Y""(it is a literal translation from my native language it means he is gonna beat us) .

My friend and I laughed id disbelief and he got even more mad and said ""WANT ME TO COME DOWN THERE"" Helen chuckled and said ""sure, come down"" as he stumbled out of his chair and out of the door of the balcony he was on me and Helen started RUNNING.

Apart from taking a course from him, the only form of interaction we have had was grabbing coffee together and I was very much shocked to discover that I was able to have a normal and engaging conversation with him. I am not good at anything that involves social situations and I might be interpreting my own feelings wrong. I don't know how people really differentiate between romantic and non-romantic feelings as the line between them has been blurry for me in the past and I have never been in a relationship before.

1h014gb,https://www.reddit.com/r/LiverDisease/comments/1h014gb/liver_biopsy_and_clarity/,Liver biopsy and clarity. ,"Hey;) so I have posted here a few times before trying to find information about liver health and connect with people that have had similar experiences who can give me some information. 
I‚Äôm a 41yr old female. I‚Äôm 5‚Äù2 and 160 pounds. I have been on suboxine for 12 years and take 8mg daily. I just started taking anxiety and adhd meds because my health anxiety was so out of control I had to do something. I take 20mg Trantillix and 15mg of Adderall. I was working out daily until I got to mentally overwhelmed by everything going on with my health. I also have substituted coffee with one 5hr extra strength energy for 15 years. I take 1 in the morning. However because it has all of the vitamins B/ Niacin supplements I have recently stopped. 

In 2017 my ALT was 47. However, nothing was ever done about it and I just found out about the elevation in 2023 through the my chart app. No Dr ever discussed it with me. 

2022 I went to my yearly Dr appt amd he ordered labs. My ALT and AST came up mildly elevated. I thought it was the Benadryl I was taking at night so I immediately stopped, got a sonogram of my liver. We rested the bloodwork in 2 weeks and my enzymes subsided and sonogram came back good. 

2023 I went back in for my yearly visit and to no surprise my enzymes where elevated but this time it was my AST,ALT and ALP all were mildly elevated. However, I was taking zzzquill ( didn‚Äôt realize it had Benadryl in it) thinking this was the issue. I stopped taking zzzquil and got another sonogram. This sonogram came back as I had hyper portal tension. I was referred to a gastro/liver doct and given orders to get a MRI 

January 2024 was my 1st visit with the liver doc he read my amd said it MRI looked good. I guess the sonogram was read incorrectly. He ordered blood work I went and got it done and Ina month or so I went back to see him. My levels had dropped he thought maybe this was a liver injury from the Benadryl. However, he ordered follow up blood work for 6 months to check my enzymes again. He told me to go live my life, no restrictions and to just lose weight and if I could get on Ozempic do so to make the process easier for me. 

October 2024 I went back to see him. I was now on the psych medication, including hydroxyzine. I realize it‚Äôs an antihistamine, but my psychiatrist did not think it would affect me because Benadryl is a bit more harsh on the body. However, when I got my labs back, the liver doctor told me that my ALP,AST and ALT were again high. I asked could It be the antihistamines. he did say if I‚Äôm reacting to antihistamines I have to stay away completely from the class of medication. I did stop taking them immediately after. He then ordered labs to check the status of my  ANA and Smooth muscle antibodie and a few other things. 

I waited weeks to get the results back and finally, his receptionist called me and told me that everything came back negative however, all of my enzymes at this time we‚Äôre elevated including my bile acids, bilirubin, ALT, AST, ALP. However, I was sick with a terrible cold b4 getting this bloodwork done. But I did wait 10days after I got well and 5days after taking prednisone. I asked what do I need to do next and she said, wait for the dr to call me back. I asked do you think he will call me today? She said, no we have other patients to get too. 

My last set of labs. 
Bile acid-23
Bilirubin 1.4
Alp-262
ALT 224
AST-197. 

Finally today another receptionist  called me and told me that the doctor finally reviewed my labs and wants to do a liver biopsy. I tried to ask questions however she did not know any of the answers so now I‚Äôm just waiting for the hospital to call. 

I am scared. But I really just need some clarity. I try and ask questions and I‚Äôm given no answers. I have asked him 2 times does he think this could be the Big  C and he told me no. But I don‚Äôt have any faith in the drs in this area or labs. Just to explain all the mistakes and hiccups along the way would take forever. I‚Äôm very passive and don‚Äôt like confrontation so I just deal with it but I‚Äôm really just tired of having no clear understanding. I‚Äôm sick of being in the dark when it

Comes to my health. I know nobody here can diagnose and I‚Äôm not looking for that. But just any clarity on what all this could mean would be so helpful just so I‚Äôm somewhat prepared. I also have no clue what to expect with the liver biopsy other than it‚Äôs ct guided.‚Äô I‚Äôve not had any symptoms other than when my bile acids were high I did experience some itchiness specifically my feet. Sometimes I feel a light pain on my right side but a lot of times it just feels like gas. I honestly don‚Äôt know if I would even notice the light ache if I wasn‚Äôt paying attention. 

I had a difficult time editing any errors while using my phone so I‚Äôm sorry if this sounds confusing or out of order. I also made some grammar errors that I could not correct. ",1,1732587957.0,LiverDisease,1,1.0,False

I am 39F and my partner 37M. We have been together for 8 and a half years. We live together since 8 years. We both work full time, we usually have coffee together in the morning (while he's mostly on his phone), then we back from work eat dinner together, after which we either watch some Netflix or he goes gaming with his buddies on discord. On weekends sometimes we go for hikes, or just chill at home which also involves reading, tv, calls to family (see below) etc. 

We are both from abroad so our families (parents) live in another continent. 

My problem is that we hardly ever do anything ""fun"" other than day hikes now and then. Ever since we live together we never went not even once to a date night, eating out, dancing... anything like that. He does go out but with his friends who he keeps separate from me and I am never invited. His excuse is that I don't speak their language (German) so I won't fit in in the hangouts. 

All the vacation time he accurs, he spends on trips to visit his family or to go visit his friends that live in different cities. For the 7 Christmas breaks since we are together, 4 I spent at home alone because he had other plans with friends and family that didn't include me. 
Many weekends he is on Skype for more than half of the day with his family rendering it impossible to do something else. I mean I also talk to my mom on Skype but I don't time these calls during ""prime time"". 

I am very unhappy about that, and he swears that he does not understand why. He says: We live together, I see you every day, why you want me to also spend my vacation time with you - I spend with you the most time compared with other people. 

It's not like I don't value the time we spend together, but overall I feel lonely and isolated, and I have no one else to travel with (my friends are all married with kids and they go on family vacations where I'm obviously not invited). I don't know of any other couple who don't also spend most of their holiday together. 

For me going out and vacations are ""quality"" time that is different from everyday time. I want some ""quality"" time too. I don't want all of his time, just part.

He tells me that I am suffocating him and I expect too much, that it is not reasonable to expect him to include me in other activities because we live together. It's not reasonable to expect to go on dates and restaurants because we already live together and can eat at home. He goes on saying things like: ""oh so you are complaining I'm not treating you like a princess is that what you want"". I'm not sure that occassioanl night out and a yearly beach vacation is a princess-level treatment, I feel like it's a normal thing to share with your partner. 

I don't know how to explain him why this behavior hurts me. It seems like I am failing to explain because he doesn't get it. I really don't know what words to use. 

This is not normal is it?! I didn't have a father so I don't have a direct experience but from my own friends and the movies... Doesn't seem like what he does is is ""normal"".

He is not a bad man, he doesn't drink, doesn't have like gambling and other big addictions (gaming maybe), he's financially responsible and does fair share of chores, our sex life is good, but I am on the brink of leaving this relationship because I just feel like I'm a household object and it's not a good feeling.

Respawn please just please revert Crypto to before you gave him his off the grid perk. There is no reason for him to be Nerfed like he was some sort of unstoppable meta breaking giant like Horizon or Pathfinder or any of your newly glazed Support legends. There was no need to make his emp useless by hand crafting a season where the only reward he gets from a successful emp is having support legends take a 5 second coffee break to undo it, there was no need to nerf his base kit because of a perk you made strong and then sufficiently nerfed to where only a completely blind person wouldnt notice him, and there was no reason to take away all of his counters and powercreep his niche team recovery ability and beacon scanning capabilities again due to the same perk you already nerfed. I find  it very distasteful you guys went back on your own word when you said you would use perks as a way to balance  legends as opposed to nerfing their base kit and then you went and nerfed a legend's base kit over a perk after nerfing the perk instead of just removing the perk and leaving the base kit alone.

 Where was this attitude for Horizon who can still mary poppins away and get off a shield bat at any given moment and get absolutely no audio while doing so?. Or pathfinder who has the option to scan 3 different things gets massive rotates, and has been one of if not the best legend for a while now, or any other annoiying to fight legend that has little to no ACTUAL RISK in their kits and more rewards than what you give us in any event.

 And no i do not want his kit reworked you didnt rework gibby to make his shield immune to emp, or newcastle to give him an invincible shield every 30 seconds, or rampart an obnoxious mini gun anytime she wants. I just want him to go back to being  as useful as he was before you felt the need to give him a perk you were just gonna nerf him for the minute a pro shed a tear about it. I was ok with a larger emp/scan range and the ability to move faster when i emp'd a team or baited them into destroying my drone, and the ability to say no to an enemy's shield or bubble since the cool down on my emp is significantly larger than the same shields you felt the need to remove the counters from on top of then being completely invincible by default which my drone is not. 

For all the fellow Crypto mains I see still playing him I applaud you for fighting the good fight and for respawn please just show him some love, the same way you showed some to the supports and actually think about how even a slight change(or multiple) ruins a legend especially those that already weren't even that strong to begin with.",20,1732587388.0,apexlegends,13,0.92,False

I‚Äôm excited to share a project I‚Äôve been working on: **Unfeed** (available at [unfeed.net](https://unfeed.net)).

Unfeed is a minimalist RSS feed aggregator designed to make it easier to stay updated and save the content you care about. It‚Äôs built with simplicity in mind:

# Key Features:

* üì∞ **Single chronological feed**: All your updates in one place, no complex filters or categories.
* üìå **Bookmarking**: Save posts you want to revisit later (no folder/category management required).
* üåê **Easy setup**: Paste an RSS feed or website URL, and Unfeed will auto-detect the feed if available.
* üí∏ **Free to use**: Unlimited feeds and bookmarks. You can sponsor the project via Buy Me a Coffee if you‚Äôd like to support it.
* üîç **Privacy-focused**: Analytics are powered by Cabin Analytics, ensuring a privacy-conscious approach.

# Why I Built It:

I wanted a simple tool that doesn‚Äôt overwhelm with features but focuses on delivering a clean and enjoyable reading experience. As an avid RSS user, I felt there was room for something lightweight yet functional.

# I‚Äôd love to hear your feedback‚Äîwhether you‚Äôre an RSS enthusiast or just getting started, Unfeed aims to make the experience as seamless as possible.
