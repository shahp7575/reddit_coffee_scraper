## Key Features Analysis

When selecting a bird sculpture, several critical features determine it's quality, aesthetic appeal, and suitability for your needs.

**Material Quality:** The material used in crafting a bird sculpture significantly impacts its durability, aesthetic charm, and overall value.

High-quality materials like bronze, stainless steel, and handcrafted wood are prized for their longevity and refined appeal. Bronze sculptures, created with meticulous casting techniques, frequently enough showcase intricate details and a timeless elegance that complements both customary and modern decor. Stainless steel bird sculptures stand out for their sleek, contemporary lines and resistance to corrosion, making them ideal for both indoor and outdoor display. Wood sculptures, crafted from sustainable hardwoods such as oak, maple, or walnut, exude a natural warmth and showcase the unique grain patterns inherent in the wood. Ceramic and glass sculptures provide opportunities for luminous colors and intricate design work that is more difficult to achieve in metal or wood.**Design and Artistry:** The design and artistry of a bird sculpture determine its aesthetic appeal and ability to capture the essence of the subject.The sculptor's attention to detail, anatomical accuracy, and artistic expression are paramount. Well-designed sculptures reflect the bird's natural posture, plumage details, and characteristic behaviors. Some sculptures capture realistic portrayals, while others embrace abstract or stylized interpretations. Consider the overall artistic style–whether it leans towards realism, modernism, abstract, or folk art–and select a sculpture that resonates with your personal aesthetic preferences.

**Size and Scale:** The size and scale of the sculpture are vital considerations, especially as it relates to the intended display location.

The sculpture should be proportionally appropriate for the space where it will be showcased. Smaller sculptures are well-suited for shelves,desks,or bedside tables,while larger pieces make a bolder statement on floors,pedestals,or in garden settings. Consider the sculpture's dimensions in relation to the surrounding furniture and decor to create a harmonious and visually pleasing arrangement.Carefully measure the intended display area to ensure that the sculpture fits comfortably without overwhelming the space.

**Craftsmanship and Detail:** The level of craftsmanship and attention to detail is a hallmark of a high-quality bird sculpture.

Look for sculptures crafted by skilled artisans who employ precise techniques and meticulous detailing. Fine details, such as feather textures, carefully shaped beaks, and detailed eye features, enhance the sculpture's realism and artistic merit. The quality of the finishing, including polishing, painting, or patination, also reflects the artisan's commitment to excellence. Inspect the sculpture closely for any imperfections that may detract from its overall appearance.

**Mounting and Display Options:** The method of mounting and the available display options impact the sculpture's versatility and adaptability to different environments.

Some bird sculptures are designed to stand freely on a flat surface, while others may be mounted on a base or pedestal. Wall-mounted sculptures offer a unique option for creating eye-catching displays. Consider whether the sculpture is suitable for indoor or outdoor use, and ensure that it is indeed appropriately protected from the elements if displayed outdoors. The mounting mechanism should be sturdy and secure to prevent accidental falls or damage.

1l4z93q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1l4z93q/husband_gets_annoyed_about_smallest_things_and/,Husband gets annoyed about smallest things and it’s awful,"My husband gets annoyed about the smallest things and it’s really starting to get to me. We’ve been together for over a decade and I think it’s always been there to some extent but it’s definitely worse in recent years.

Sharing some recent examples: 

We went on a day trip when I was heavily pregnant. Our plan was to eat out and a bit of a mooch. We weren’t sure where we wanted to eat, so decided to have a walk around and look at some menus. I felt quite lightheaded though and said I needed to eat something right away… I was happy to grab a snack from a shop so we could keep looking for the right spot, but he got angry because things weren’t perfect, huffing and puffing and moaning at me, to the point where I got a bit upset. If I was in his shoes I might have suggested I sit down somewhere and he’ll return with a snack, instead it was me trying to console him that the day wasn’t ruined, I just needed to nibble on something. 

After our baby was born (via emergency c section) I was excited to have my first shower at home. I’d gone on about it so he knew it meant something to me. Anyway, I emerge from my shower all fresh and happy. He then goes into the bathroom and complains that I haven’t opened the big window to let the steam out (totally out of the question that I would do that given its placement and my recent surgery, but I’d opened the smaller window) No ‘how was your shower, I bet you feel great!’ I felt a bit crushed. 

He’s often got a short fuse with me and will be quick to talk to me in a ‘stressed’ tone. He’s also usually very defensive if I bring up what he’s said / how he’s spoken to me, which often sparks arguments.

He complains about lots of small things like dishes being in the sink instead of on the side where he’d rather they were, how the bin bags are done, laundry, that sort of thing. I’m looking after a baby so meeting his exacting standards is hardly a priority.

He makes plans for us / himself without consulting me. This past week he’s spent 2 days out of the house doing things on his own whilst I’m home alone with our baby. I wouldn’t have said no but I would like to be asked. It would be unthinkable for me to do the same and leave him alone with our baby! 

He can find doing stuff outside of the day to day quite stressful, even something as small as going out to get a coffee can be out of the question sometimes because he has ‘stuff he needs to do.’ We’re going on holiday soon and the preparation for that is proving stressful rather than fun. I pulled him up on his tone with me recently and he said he was stressed because I hadn’t told him how a buggy we are borrowing folds down (who cares?! And I don’t remember him asking.) 

He generally has high standards and is a bit of a perfectionist. I do what I can to help him relax. I encourage him to have saunas and go on runs, things he enjoys and which help a bit… but I do feel a little resentful when he does these things and is still irritable, especially as I don’t get much / any me time most days.

He has a hard job but he’s not working at the moment as he’s got a good paternity package. 
It’s not ‘baby related’ although it’s probably exasperated things. I’ve spoken to him about all this many times (and we do argue about it) and raised it as a serious concern a few years ago. He’s been to therapy in the past, which helped, and I’ve suggested he goes back but he’s not keen.

Am I being overly sensitive or am I right to be annoyed by his behaviour? 

He has many wonderful qualities and I know he loves me and our child very much… but what to do? It feels like he’s sucking all the joy out of life sometimes.

I work at a small firm for the second summer in a row. Last summer, it was super uncomfortable to get used to doing billed work. I felt like I had to be busy all the time, but also I was afraid of billing for the total time it took me to complete a project. I had the urges to ask the attorneys questions all the time, but I held myself back and tried to find the answers for myself. I soon realized the firm was breaking even on me billing 2 hours a day, and that it was okay to chill out a bit while waiting for an attorney to be free instead of disrupting them every time I had a question. By the end of the summer, I was billing 5-6 hours a day while being self-sufficient for the most part. The rest of my days were mostly spent playing solitaire waiting for an attorney to email me back, call me, or stop by my office when they were free.

We have a new 1L clerk this summer, and he constantly disrupts the attorneys. I saw his billing sheet once and he was billing 7 hours in an 8 hour day (so removing coffee breaks, 30 minutes of total non-working time a day). But the attorneys don’t like him, because he interrupts their workflow constantly. A lot of the questions he asks are either super fringe things unrelated to the case at hand or things he could find the answer to by searching westlaw’s secondary sources. Meanwhile, the deadline on his project isn’t urgent. If a filing deadline was the next day, then it would be reasonable to need an immediate answer. 

Based on the conversations I’ve had with permanent staff, there is no way he is getting a post-grad offer here (for the above behavior, among other reasons). 

It is okay to only be billing 4 hours a day if you can ask all of your questions at once or email them and patiently wait for a response. That is preferable to billing 6-7 hours but eating up the time of the attorneys with nonstop questions. Even better, find the answers for yourself, even if you have to bill an extra hour. Your reviewing attorney will reduce your billed hours if you spent way too much time on a project. 

Just relax a bit. Your job as a summer clerk is to reduce the workload of the attorneys and to open up their time for more complex tasks. It defeats the purpose if you are eating up their time with questions.

The lighthouse, of course. What was an offshore New England island without its stalwart spear? This one, pure and dazzling white...","Chapter One  
June, 2001  
 She kept staring straight ahead as the knuckle of land, bumpy and green with distance, began revealing its secrets. The lighthouse, of course. What was an offshore New England island without its stalwart spear? This one, pure and dazzling white, rose on a craggy cliff. Just as it should, Nell thought. There was a stone house near it, fog-gray in the sharp summer sunlight, with peaked roofs and gables and what she hoped was a widow's walk circling the top story. She'd seen paintings of the Light of the Sisters and the house that stood so strong and firm beside it. It was the one she'd seen in the little shop on the mainland, the one that had sent her impulsively to the car ferry.  
 She'd been following impulse and instinct for six months, just two months after her meticulous and hard-worked plan had freed her. Every moment of those first two months had been terror. Then, gradually, terror had eased to anxiety, and a different kind of fear, almost like a hunger, that she would lose what she had found again. She had died so she could live. Now she was tired of running, of hiding, of losing herself in crowded cities. She wanted a home. Wasn't that what she'd always wanted? A home, roots, family, friends. The familiar that never judged too harshly. Maybe she would find some part of that here, on this spit of land cradled by the sea. Surely she could get no farther away from Los Angeles than this pretty little island-not unless she left the country altogether.  
  
  If she couldn't find work on the island, she could still take a few days there. A kind of vacation from flight, she decided. She would enjoy the rocky beaches, the little village, she would climb the cliffs and roam the thick wedge of forest.  
  
  She'd learned how to celebrate and cherish every moment of being. It was something she would never, ever forget again.  
  
  Delighted with the scatter of clapboard cottages tucked back from the dock, she leaned on the rail of the ferry, let the wind blow through her hair. It was back to its natural sun-drenched blond. When she'd run, she'd hacked it short as a boy's, gleefully snipping off the long, tumbling curls, then dying it deep brown. Over the past months, she'd changed the color periodically-bright red, coal black, a soft sable brown. She still kept it fairly short and very straight.  
  
  It said something, didn't it, that she'd finally been able to let it be. Something about reclaiming herself, she thought.  
  
  Evan had liked it long, with a riot of curls. At times he had dragged her by it, across the floor, down the stairs. Using it like chains.  
  
  No, she would never wear it long again.  
  
  A shudder ran through her, and she glanced quickly over her shoulder, scanning the cars, the people. Her mouth went dry, her throat hot as she searched for a tall, slim man with gilded hair and eyes as pale and hard as glass.  
  
  He wasn't there, of course. He was three thousand miles away. She was dead to him. Hadn't he told her a hundred times that the only way she would be free of him was in death?  
  
  Helen Remington had died so Nell Channing could live.  
  
  Furious with herself for going back, even for a moment in her mind, Nell tried to calm herself. She breathed in slowly. Salt air, water. Freedom.  
  
  As her shoulders relaxed again, a tentative smile played around her mouth. She stayed at the rail, a small woman with short, sunny hair that danced cheerfully around a delicate face. Her mouth, unpainted and soft, curved up and teased out the hint of dimples in her cheeks. Pleasure brought a rosy glow to her skin.  
  
  She wore no makeup, another deliberate act. There was a part of her that was still hiding, still hunted, and she did whatever she could to pass unnoticed.  
  
  Once she had been considered a beauty, and had groomed herself accordingly. She'd dressed as she'd been told to dress, wearing sleek, sexy, sophisticated clothes selected by a man who claimed to love her above all things. She'd known the feel of silk against her skin, what it was to casually clasp diamonds around her throat. Helen Remington had known all the privileges of great wealth.  
  
  And for three years had lived in fear and misery.  
  
  Nell wore a simple cotton shirt over faded jeans. Her feet were comfortable in cheap white sneakers. Her only jewelry was an antique locket that had been her mother's.  
  
  Some things were too precious to leave behind.  
  
  As the ferry slowed to dock, she walked back to her car. She would arrive on Three Sisters with one small bag of belongings, a rusted secondhand Buick, and $208 to her name.  
  
  She couldn't have been happier.  
  
  Nothing, she thought as she parked the car near the docks and began to wander on foot, could have been farther from the pleasure palaces and glitz of Beverly Hills. And nothing, she realized, had ever called more truly to her soul than this little postcard village. Houses and shops were both tidy and prim with their colors faded by sea salt and sun. Cobblestone streets were curvy and whistle-clean as they climbed the hilly terrain or arrowed back to the docks.  
  
  Gardens were lovingly tended, as if weeds were illegal. Dogs barked behind picket fences and children rode bikes of cherry red and electric blue.  
  
  The docks themselves were a study in industry. Boats and nets and ruddy-cheeked men in tall rubber boots. She could smell fish and sweat.  
  
  She hiked up the hill from the docks and turned to look back. From there she could see the tour boats plugging along in the bay, and the little sickle slash of sand beach where people spread out on towels or bobbed in the energetic surf. A little red tram with white letters that read THREE SISTERS TOURS was rapidly filling up with day-trippers and their cameras.  
  
  Fishing and tourism, she supposed, were what kept the island afloat. But that was economics. It stood against sea, storms, and time, surviving and flourishing at its own pace. That, she thought, was courage.  
  
  It had taken her too long to find her own.  
  
  High Street speared across the hill. Shops and restaurants and what she supposed were island businesses lined it. One of the restaurants should be her first stop, she thought. It was possible she could hook a job as a waitress or short-order cook, at least for the summer season. If she could find work, she could hunt up a room.  
  
  She could stay.  
  
  In a few months, people would know her. They'd wave as she walked by, or call out her name. She was so tired of being a stranger, of having no one to talk to. No one who cared.  
  
  She stopped to study the hotel. Unlike the other buildings it was stone instead of wood. Its three stories with elaborate gingerbread, iron balconies, and peaked roofs were undeniably romantic. The name suited it, she decided. The Magick Inn.  
  
  It was a good bet that she'd find work there. Waitressing in the dining room, or as part of the housekeeping staff. A job was the first order of business.  
  
  But she couldn't make herself go inside, deal with it. She wanted time first, a little time before she settled down to the practical.  
  
  Flighty, Evan would have said. You're much too flighty and foolish for your own good, Helen. Thank God you have me to take care of you.  
  
  Because his voice played all too clearly in her ears, because the words nipped at the confidence she'd slowly rebuilt, she turned deliberately away and walked in the opposite direction.  
  
  She would get a damn job when she was ready to, but for now she was going to wander, to play tourist, to explore. When she was finished roaming High Street, she'd go back to her car and drive all over the island. She wouldn't even stop at the Island Tourist Board to get a map.  
  
  Following her nose, she hitched up her backpack and crossed the street. She passed craft shops, gift shops, loitered at the windows. She enjoyed pretty things that sat on shelves without purpose. One day, when she settled again, she'd make a home just as she pleased, full of clutter and fun and color.  
  
  An ice cream shop made her smile. There were round glass tables and white iron chairs. A family of four sat at one, laughing as they spooned up wh  
ipped cream and confetti-colored sprinkles. A boy wearing a white cap and apron stood behind the counter, and a girl in snug cutoff jeans flirted with him as she considered her choices.  
  
  Nell sketched the picture in her mind and walked on.  
  
  The bookstore stopped her, made her sigh. Her home would be full of books, too, but not rare first editions never meant to be opened and read. She'd have old, scarred books, shiny new paperbacks all in a jumble of stories. In fact, that was one thing she could start now. A paperback novel wouldn't add much weight to her pack if she had to move on.  
  
  She looked up from the display in the window to the Gothic lettering spilling across the glass. Cafe Book. Well, that was perfect. She would hunt through the stacks, find something fun to read, and look through it over a cup of coffee.  
  
  She stepped inside to air that was fragrant with flowers and spice, and heard music played on pipes and harps. Not only the hotel was magic, Nell thought the minute she crossed the threshold.  
  
  Books, in a banquet of colors and shapes, lined deep blue shelves. Overhead, tiny pricks of light showered down from the ceiling like stars. The checkout counter was an old oak cabinet, deeply carved with winged faeries and crescent moons.  
  
  A woman with dark, choppy hair sat on a high stool behind it, idly paging through a book. She glanced up and adjusted silver-framed reading glasses.  
  
  ""Morning. Can I help you?""  
  
  ""I'm just going to look around, if that's all right. ""  
  
  ""Enjoy. Let me know if I can help you find anything. ""  
  
  As the clerk went back to her book, Nell roamed. Across the room two generous chairs faced a stone hearth. On the table between stood a lamp fashioned from a figurine of a robed woman with her arms lifted high. Other shelves held trinkets, statues of colored stone, crystal eggs, dragons. She wandered through, passing books on one side, rows of candles on the other.  
  
  At the rear, stairs curved to the second floor. She climbed and found more books, more trinkets, and the cafe.  
  
  Half a dozen tables of glossy wood were arranged near the front window. Along the side was a glass display and counter boasting an impressive array of pastries, sandwiches, and a kettle of that day's soup. The prices were on the high side, but not unreasonable. Nell thought she might have some soup to go with her coffee.  
  
  Moving closer, she heard the voices from the open door behind the counter.  
  
  ""Jane, this is ridiculous, and totally irresponsible. ""  
  
  ""It is not. It's Tim's big chance, and it's a way off this damn island. We're taking it. ""  
  
  ""The possibility of an audition for a play that may or may not be produced Off Broadway is not a big chance. Neither one of you will have a job. You won't-""  
  
  ""We're going, Mia. I told you I'd work till noon today, and I worked till noon. ""  
  
  ""You told me that less than twenty-four hours ago. ""  
  
  There was impatience in the voice-a low, lovely voice. Unable to help herself, Nell edged closer.  
  
  ""How the hell am I going to keep the cafe up without anyone to cook?""  
  
  ""It's all about you, isn't it? You can't even wish us luck. ""  
  
  ""Jane, I'll wish you a miracle, because that's what it's going to take. No, wait-don't go off in a huff. ""  
  
  Nell caught movement in the doorway and stepped to the side. But she didn't move out of earshot.  
  
  ""Be careful. Be happy. Oh, damn it. Blessed be, Jane. ""  
  
  ""Okay. "" There was a loud sniffle. ""I'm sorry, really, I'm sorry for leaving you in the lurch this way. But Tim needs to do this, and I need to be with Tim. So. . . I'll miss you, Mia. I'll write. ""  
  
  Nell managed to duck behind shelves just as a weeping woman raced out of the back and ran down the stairs.  
  
  ""Well, isn't this just fine. ""  
  
  Nell peeked out, blinked in automatic admiration.  
  
  The woman who stood in the doorway was a vision. Nell couldn't think of another word for her. She had a mass of hair the color of autumn leaves. Reds and golds spilled over the shoulders of a long blue dress that left her arms bare to the silver bracelets that winked bright on each wrist. Her eyes, sparking with temper, were gray as smoke and dominated a flawless face. Slashing cheekbones, a full, wide mouth painted siren red. Skin like. . . Nell had heard skin compared to alabaster, but this was the first time she'd seen it.  
  
  She was tall, willow-slim and perfect.  
  
  Nell glanced toward the cafe tables to see if any of the customers who loitered there were as awestruck as she herself. But no one seemed to notice the woman or the temper swirling around her like water on the boil.  
  
  She inched out to get a better look, and those gray eyes shifted. Pinned her.  
  
  ""Hello. Can I help you?""  
  
  ""I was. . . I thought. . . I'd like a cup of cappuccino and a bowl of soup. Please. ""  
  
  Annoyance flashed in Mia's eyes and nearly sent Nell back behind the shelves. ""I can handle the soup. We have lobster bisque today. I'm afraid the espresso machine is beyond my current capabilities. ""  
  
  Nell looked at the beautiful copper-and-brass machine, felt a little tingle. ""I could make it myself. ""  
  
  ""You know how to work this thing?""  
  
  ""Yes, actually, I do. ""  
  
  Considering, Mia gestured and Nell scurried behind the counter.  
  
  ""I could make you one while I'm at it. ""  
  
  ""Why not?"" Brave little rabbit, Mia mused, as she watched Nell take over the machine. ""Just what sent you to my door? Backpacking?""  
  
  ""No. Oh. "" Nell flushed, remembering her pack. ""No, just exploring a little. I'm looking for a job, and a room. ""  
  
  ""Ah. ""  
  
  ""Excuse me, I know it was rude, but I overheard your. . . conversation. If I understand it correctly, you're in a bit of a jam. I can cook. ""  
  
  Mia watched the steam rise, listened to the hiss. ""Can you?""  
  
  ""I'm a very good cook. "" Nell offered Mia the frothing coffee. ""I've done catering, I've worked in a bakery, and I've waitressed. I know how to prepare food and how to serve it. ""  
  
  ""How old are you?""  
  
  ""Twenty-eight. ""  
  
  ""Do you have a criminal record?""  
  
  A giggle nearly burst out of Nell's throat. For a moment it danced lively in her eyes. ""No. I'm tediously honest, a dependable worker and a creative cook. ""  
  
  Don't babble, don't babble! she ordered herself, but she couldn't seem to stop. ""I need the job because I'd like to live on the island. I'd like a job here because I enjoy books and I liked the, well, the feel of your shop as soon as I walked in. ""  
  
  Intrigued, Mia angled her head. ""And what did you feel?""  
  
  ""Possibilities. ""  
  
  Excellent answer, Mia mused. ""Do you believe in possibilities?""  
  
  Nell considered. ""Yes. I've had to. ""  
  
  ""Excuse me?"" A couple stepped up to the counter. ""We'd like to have two iced mochas and two of those eclairs. ""  
  
  ""Of course. Just a moment. "" Mia turned back to Nell. ""You're hired. Apron's in the back. We'll work out the details later today. "" She sipped her cappuccino. ""Well done,"" she added and stepped out of the way. ""Oh-what's your name?""  
  
  ""I'm Nell. Nell Channing. ""  
  
  ""Welcome to Three Sisters, Nell Channing. ""  
  
  \*\*\*  
  
  Mia Devlin ran Cafe Book the way she ran her life. With a style born out of instinct, and largely for her personal amusement. She was a crafty businesswoman who enjoyed making a profit. But always on her own terms.  
  
  What bored her, she ignored. What intrigued her, she pursued.  
  
  At the moment, Nell Channing intrigued her.  
  
  If Nell had been exaggerating her skills, Mia would have fired her as quickly as she'd hired her, and with no regret. She may have, if the spirit moved her, helped Nell secure a job elsewhere. But that wouldn't have taken much time, or interfered with her business.  
  
  She'd have taken that step only because something about Nell had tugged at her the instant those big blue eyes met hers.  
  
  Injured innocence. That had been Mia's first impression,  
and she trusted her first impressions implicitly. Competence as well, Mia thought, though the confidence was a little shaky.  
  
  Still, once Nell had suited up and started work at the cafe"", she'd steadied in that area, too.  
  
  Mia observed her through the afternoon, noted that she handled the food orders, the customers, the cash register, and the baffling mystery of the espresso machine smoothly.  
  
  They'd need to spruce her up a bit, Mia decided. They were casual on the island, but the ancient jeans were a bit too laid-back for Mia's personal taste.  
  
  Satisfied for the moment, Mia walked back into the cafe kitchen. It impressed her that the counters and appliances were clean. Jane had never managed to be a tidy cook, even though most of the baked goods had been prepared by her off-site.  
  
  ""Nell?""  
  
  Taken by surprise, Nell jolted and spun around from the stove, where she'd been scrubbing burners. Her cheeks flushed as she looked at Mia and the young woman beside her.  
  
  ""Didn't mean to startle you. This is Peg. She works the counter from two to seven. ""  
  
  ""Oh. Hello. ""  
  
  ""Hi. Jeez, I can't believe Jane and Tim are just leaving. New York City!"" Peg sounded a bit envious. She was little and perky, with a mop of curly hair bleached nearly white. ""Jane made awesome blueberry muffins. ""  
  
  ""Yes, well, Jane and her muffins aren't here anymore. I need to talk to Nell now, so you're in charge of the cafe. ""  
  
  ""No problem. Catch you later, Nell. ""  
  
  ""Why don't we use my office? We'll get to those details. We're open from ten to seven, summer hours. In the winter we cut back and close at five. Peg prefers the afternoon shift. She likes to party and isn't a morning person. In any case, since we start serving at ten, I'll need you here in the morning. ""  
  
  ""That's okay with me. "" She followed Mia up another flight of steps. She hadn't paid attention, Nell realized. She hadn't known the shop had three floors. A few months before, she would never have missed that detail. She'd have checked out the space, the exits.  
  
  Relaxing didn't mean getting sloppy, she reminded herself. She had to be ready, at any time, to run again.  
  
  They passed a large storeroom, lined with bookshelves and stacked with boxes, then went through a doorway into Mia's office.  
  
  The antique cherry desk suited her, Nell thought. She imagined Mia surrounded by the rich and the beautiful. There were flowers here, and thriving plants, little bits of crystal and polished rocks in bowls. Along with the stylish furnishings were a top-of-the-line computer, a fax, filing cabinets, and shelves for publishers' catalogs. Mia gestured to a chair and took the one behind the desk for herself.  
  
  ""You had a few hours in the cafe, so you've seen the type of fare we offer. There's a specialty sandwich each day, the day's soup, a small selection of alternate sandwiches. Two or three varieties of cold salads. Pastries, cookies, muffins, biscotti. In the past  
  
  I left the menu choices up to the cook. Are you comfortable with that?""  
  
  ""Yes, ma'am. ""  
  
  ""Please, I'm barely a year older than you. It's Mia. Until we're sure this is going to work, I'd prefer you make up the next day's menu for my approval. "" She took a legal pad out of the drawer, passed it across the desk. ""Why don't you write down what you have in mind for tomorrow?""  
  
  Panic wanted to crawl through her, tremble in her fingers. Nell took a deep breath, waited until her mind was blank and clear, then began to write. ""This time of year, I think we should keep the soups light. Herbed consomme. Tortellini salad, a white bean, and a shrimp. I'd do a spiced-chicken pita for the sandwich, and a vegetarian selection, but I'd have to see what's in season. I can make you tarts, again depending on what looks good fruit-wise. The eclairs are popular-I can duplicate those. A six-layer chocolate-and-cream torte. Awesome blueberry muffins, as well as walnut. You're low on hazelnut biscotti. Cookies? Chocolate chip is never wrong. Macadamia. Instead of a third cookie, I'd offer brownies. I make an irresistible triple-fudge brownie. ""  
  
  ""How much can you prepare on-site?""  
  
  ""All of it, I guess. But if you're going to serve the pastries and muffins starting at ten, I'll need to start about six. ""  
  
  ""If you had your own kitchen?""  
  
  ""Oh, well. "" What a lovely fantasy that was. ""I'd prep some of the menu the night before, bake fresh in the morning. ""  
  
  ""Um-hmm. How much money do you have, Nell Channing?""  
  
  ""Enough. ""  
  
  ""Don't be prickly,"" Mia advised breezily. ""I can advance you a hundred dollars. Going against a salary, to start, of seven an hour. You'll log your shopping, cooking hours daily. You'll charge what you need, food-wise, to the store's account. I'll want the receipts, again daily. ""  
  
  When Nell opened her mouth to speak, Mia simply lifted one slim, coral-tipped finger. ""Wait. You'll be expected to serve and to clear tables when there's a rush, and to assist customers in the book section on your level during lulls. You get two half-hour breaks, Sundays off, and a fifteen percent employee discount on purchases, not including food or drink-which unless you turn out to be a glutton, will be part of your perks. With me so far?""  
  
  ""Yes, but I-""  
  
  ""Good. I'm here every day. If you have a question or problem you can't handle, get me. If I'm not available, go to Lulu. She's usually at the counter on the main floor, and she knows everything. You look quick enough to catch on; if you don't know an answer, don't be afraid to ask. Now, you're looking for a place to stay. ""  
  
  ""Yes. "" It was like being swept away by a fast, unexpected wind. ""I hope to-""  
  
  ""Come with me. "" Mia pulled a set of keys out of a drawer, pushed away from the desk and clipped out-she wore gorgeous, needle-thin heels, Nell noted.  
  
  Once they were on the main level, she walked straight toward a rear door. ""Lulu!"" she called out. ""Back in ten. ""  
  
  Feeling clumsy and foolish, Nell followed her through the back exit and into a small garden paved with stepping-stones. A huge black cat sunned itself on one of them and blinked open one luminous gold eye as Mia stepped nimbly over.  
  
  ""That's Isis. She won't trouble you. ""  
  
  ""She's beautiful. Is the garden your work?""  
  
  ""Yes. No place is a home without flowers. Oh, I didn't ask-do you have transportation?""  
  
  ""Yes, I have a car. It can loosely be called transportation. ""  
  
  ""That's handy. You won't have far to go, but it'd be troublesome to cart your goods on foot every day. "" At the edge of the lot she turned left, kept up her brisk pace, passed the backs of shops, across from neatly kept houses.  
  
  ""Ms. -I'm sorry, I don't know your last name. ""  
  
  ""It's Devlin, but I told you to call me Mia. ""  
  
  ""Mia, I'm grateful for the job. For the chance. And I can promise you, you won't be sorry. But. . . can I ask where we're going?""  
  
  ""You need a place. "" She turned a corner, stopped and gestured. ""That should do it. ""  
  
  Across the narrow side street sat a little yellow house, like a cheerful sunbeam at the edge of a tiny grove of stunted trees. The shutters were white, as was the narrow strip of porch. There were flowers there, too, in a happy dance of bright summer colors.  
  
  It sat back from the road on a neat square of lawn with trees tucking it into shade and dappled sunlight.  
  
  ""Is this your house?"" Nell asked.  
  
  ""Yes. For the moment. "" Jingling the keys, Mia walked up the flagstone path. ""I bought it last spring. ""  
  
  Had been compelled to, Mia remembered. An investment, she'd told herself. Though she, a businesswoman down to the bone, had done nothing so far about renting it out. She'd waited, just as, she understood, the house had waited.  
  
  She unlocked the front door, stepped back. ""It's been blessed. ""  
  
  ""Excuse me?""  
  
  Mia only nodded. ""Welcome. ""  
  
  The furnishings were sparse. A simple sofa that desperately needed re-covering, a deep-cushioned chair, a scatter of tables.  
  
  ""Bedrooms on either side, though the one to the left is more suited to an office or study. The bathroom's  
minute, but charming, and the kitchen's been modernized and should do very well. It's straight back. I've worked on the gardens, but they need more care. There's no AC, but the furnace works. Still, you'll be glad the fireplace works as well come January. ""  
  
  ""It's wonderful. "" Unable to resist, Nell wandered, poking her head in the main bedroom where a pretty bed with a white iron headboard stood. ""Like a fairy cottage. You must love living here. ""  
  
  ""I don't live here. You do. ""  
  
  Nell turned back, slowly. There was Mia, in the center of the little room, her hands cupped together with the keys in her palm. Light beamed through the two front windows and seemed to set her hair to flame.  
  
  ""I don't understand. ""  
  
  ""You need a place, I have a place. I live on the cliffs. I prefer it there. This is your place, for now. Don't you feel it?""  
  
  She only knew she felt happy, and full of nerves at the same time. And that the moment she'd stepped into the house, she'd wanted to stretch and settle, very much like the cat in the sunshine.  
  
  ""I can stay here?""  
  
  ""Life's been hard, hasn't it?"" Mia murmured. ""That you'd tremble at good fortune. You'll pay rent, for nothing that comes free holds its value. We'll work the terms out of your salary. Settle in. You'll have to come back and sign forms and so on. But that can wait for the morning. Island Market is your best source for the ingredients you'll need for tomorrow's menu. I'll let them know you're coming, so you can charge to the store account. Any pots, pans, whatever are your expense, but I'll float that until the end of the month. I expect to see you, and your creations, by nine-thirty sharp. ""  
  
  She stepped over and dropped the keys into Nell's limp hand. ""Any questions?""  
  
  ""Too many to know where to begin. I don't know how to thank you. ""  
  
  ""Don't waste your tears, little sister,"" Mia replied. ""They're too precious. You'll work hard for what you make here. ""  
  
  ""I can't wait to get started. "" Nell held out her hand. ""Thank you, Mia. ""  
  
  Their hands touched, clasped. A spark snapped out, blue as flame and quickly gone. With a half laugh, Nell jerked back. ""Must be a lot of static, or something, in the air. ""  
  
  ""Or something. Well, welcome home, Nell. "" Turning, Mia started for the door.  
  
  ""Mia. "" Emotion gathered in her throat, ached there. ""I said this was like a fairy cottage. You must be my fairy godmother. ""  
  
  Mia's smile was dazzling, and her laughter low and rich as warmed cream. ""You'll find out soon enough I'm far from it. I'm just a practical witch. Don't forget to bring me the receipts,"" she added and quietly closed the door behind her.

This is what I'm trying to do. I've visited a few times, so I've covered pretty much all of the tourist spots.

1. Take BART to Ariscault in McAllister to try their croissants after everyone's recommendations.

2. Take Bay Wheels to Plow for lunch.

3. Bike to Salesforce Park and get a coffee at Andytown after.

4. Take N to Cole Valley because it's one of my favorite neighborhoods. I'd just walk around a little bit and take in the vibes.

5. Hang out a GGP for a bit.

6. Check out the new Sunset Dunes park.

7. Head back to the airport from there (1h and 25 min estimated transit time).",1,1749233161.0,AskSF,4,1.0,False

A few days after my last update he texted me and asked if we could meet to talk. I agreed and left my kid with my grandma and met him at a coffee shop. He started with an apology and went on about how that wasn’t him and he’s a good guy he just drank too much and lost control. 

He asked me if I wanted to get married still and I said no. He asked if he could move back in so we could “work on things” and I said no. He even offered to do couples therapy and I said I’d have to think about it. He got quiet and asked if I ever even loved him. I said I did but I can’t handle the whole whoa is me thing he’s been doing. I said I would have never tried to screw him over in the case of a divorce and that if I didn’t love him I would’ve never had a kid with him. I said he needs to do individual therapy before i’d consider doing couples therapy with him. 

He got angry and yelled that I needed therapy more than he did and he refused to do it without me. He got up and said he’s going to take me to court and fight for full custody and that I’d never “see a dime” from him. I’m assuming he meant child support. 

Since then he tried dropping by unannounced to take our kid. My grandmas lawyer friend (technically her friends son) told me that since we don’t have a custody agreement in place it’s a free for all and he could legally take him across state lines. He said it can be much more difficult to get him back especially if we don’t know where he is. So I didn’t let him take our kid but said he’s welcome to come visit but he’s not leaving with him until we have a custody arrangement in place. That ended about as well as you could imagine.

Early April, the sun beat down on me as if I’d done some evil to it in a past life. I trudged on.



As much as I claimed to love reading, I seldom stepped foot into the library. But I was there, letting the souls of books pass verdict on whether I could claim to be on their side. On the side of worn books - manhandled books- heavily annotated books - fresh books especially bought for the library.



I took a seat near the window aisle, a triumph surged within me as I revelled in the sunlight from within the air conditioned room.



I picked up a copy of *Hard Boiled Wonderland & the End of the World.* And smoothed my linen skirt as I sat in the plush chair again. A man close to my age walked in with a stack of books in one arm and sat across from me. I was not repulsed, neither felt hospitable. 



“Excuse me, Miss. I am a man who cares a lot for appearances, I cannot sit by myself. I assure you I will not create disturbance. Please carry on .” He gestured to my book with a nervous smile. “And what of the impression you are creating on me at the moment?” I raised a brow. “May I buy you a cup of coffee later to express my thanks? Might I regain your favour, then?” How dare he try to act charming! 



“The place where I come from, it is considered unruly for a person to be by themselves– they are taken for madmen- banished from society.” He mused just as I turned to page twenty-one. “What kind of place might that be?” I asked, looking up. He had a sweet face- the man. Big, curious eyes, a friendly smile, soft features.



“It is a place where only natives can live. Outsiders cannot last a day! Such are its rules and  traditions, a few fortunate ones such as myself have escaped- but - as you can see, I am not yet fully accustomed to the norms here. I hope you do not mind my company?” 

“ I keep to myself a lot, perhaps it's good to have some idle chatter. I am not very fond of men making passes if I am alone- for you I shall make an exception” I probably confused him -but really it was not personal.



Another hour passed in silence, the sun’s rays shifting on our desk- it was nearly 4pm.



“Well.” I slowly got up, my bag in hand “ I have to go now…will you be alright on your own?” I had no reason to concern myself with the man- I didn't even know his name! - but he was so earnest. 

“Let me keep my word Miss, let me buy you some coffee.” He gave a subtle smile.

  


“ If it's alright,  can I take you to a nearby cafe? I’m a regular there” The Man suggested. It was a five minute walk and neither of us spoke. The leaves crunched under my sandals, but the fresh and green ones clung firmly to the trees’ branches.



“After you” The Man gestured to the old, creaky door. Being extra careful - I pushed the door as per the sign, stepping into the aroma of freshly ground coffee and…flowers? The Man came in behind me as the sharp scent of jasmine almost blocked my sinuses. The Man, completely unfazed, led me to a table by the window- we both had a thing for window aisles I guess.



I sat rather timidly- the scent still reaching my head into a worn wooden chair, The Man sat across from me. “ Say, are you not bothered by this strong scent of flowers?” I leaned forward. “Not in the least. Its how they brew their specialty coffee.” He said as a matter-of-factly. “What kind of coffee is brewed with flowers?” I could not help but press on. “Let’s see… coffee is closed into an airtight jar with these blossoms and create a coffee blend which yields a sparkly white colour- and enables you to see spirits.” The Man furrowed his brow with utmost sincerity - I rolled my eyes.

Experience: You must possess a minimum of 10 years of experience, but under no circumstances can you have more than 18 years of experience. 



Handedness Harmony: This is critical. Applicants MUST be right-handed. No exceptions. We find it creates an imbalance in the team and we do not provide a left-handed keyboard.

1l4z2m3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l4z2m3,Compaq deskpro (1999) sleeper build,"Hey everyone,

After a few months of modifications and changes, I think I can finally call my PC setup complete (at least until I save up for new components!). I'm not planning any more changes for now, so I wanted to share it with what is probably the only community that can truly appreciate this kind of effort. This is my PC.

This case housed the first computer I remember in our home; it's actually older than I am. Back in 2020, when I was getting parts for a new PC, I wanted to use this case, but there were too many challenges and things I wasn't confident about. It's extremely narrow and you can't fit any standard cooling solutions in it. I definitely wouldn't recommend it for a first-time project.

But it held a special place in my heart, even though I set it aside back then. I've since graduated with a degree in Computer Engineering and decided to return to this passion project.

Here's a quick rundown of the process:

* The entire case was disassembled.
* I removed the original drive cage because the motherboard's main power cable wouldn't clear it.
* Everything was washed, sandblasted, degreased, and repainted.
* I drilled a few new holes where needed and ground out a section for GPU I/O access and the power supply plug.
* I disassembled an old CD-ROM drive and glued its front bezel onto the case to maintain the retro look. One of the bay covers is missing, and while I have a 3D model ready to print, I've had so much bad luck with it that I've put it on hold for now.
* The front power button and indicator LEDs had to be custom-made because the original assembly wouldn't fit. I salvaged the original LEDs and a low-profile button from the same CD-ROM drive (I couldn't resist while I had it apart).

After removing the cage, the motherboard and PSU fit beautifully. I did an initial test build on the case's internal frame before putting everything inside the outer shell. Of course, it was only *after* assembling it all that I realized the GPU's display outputs were completely blocked by the rear panel. Classic.

Cable management was a real challenge. My solution was to drill the mounting holes for the AIO radiator slightly more to the left, creating a narrow channel behind it to route cables. I tied strings through unused holes in the chassis and used these as anchor points for Velcro straps to hold the cables. Since I don't have a modular PSU, I had a pretty big bundle of unused cables to hide. Each cable was tied off individually, then bundled together and secured to the strings at the top of the case.

Regarding the side panel, I originally planned to keep the solid, opaque original. But as I was assembling it, my girlfriend mercilessly mocked me, saying it was a shame to spend a month painting and managing cables just to hide it all. So, I bought an acrylic sheet, measured, cut, drilled, and sanded it (all in our living room). I even fabricated a custom mounting system so I wouldn't have to drill any more holes into the case itself.

This old case has zero dust filtering. To fix this, I installed individual dust filters directly onto the radiator fans. It looks clean, and I have an air purifier in the room. A quick blowout with compressed air every now and then keeps the inside clean.

The 360mm radiator serves as the main air intake. Now, that might not sound ideal, as a radiator logically heats the air passing through it. However, the CPU I'm using could easily be cooled by a simple 120mm AIO; the 360mm is massive overkill. The top portion of the radiator, which gets the warmest, has its air immediately exhausted by the rear fan and the PSU. The bottom section of the radiator never really heats up and provides plenty of fresh, cool air directly to the GPU's intake. The temperatures are great, and everything runs perfectly.

And yes, there are plants inside! Don't panic; they are artificial and have been placed carefully to ensure they don't obstruct airflow. They're mostly for design, placed near the front window where there's minimal airflow anyway.

As a final touch, I painted a little figurine I had lying around and made a custom stand for it with little feet, so it doesn't sit directly on the GPU backplate and trap heat. The sign on it reads *""s vetrom o preteky,""* which means ""Racing the wind"" in Slovak.

That's about it! If you've read this far, hats off to you. I hope it was worth your time. Let me know what you think!

I have written the story below for those who want more details in order to answer, but the text definitely comes with a trigger warning, so no need to read if it you don't want to feel stressed <3. After my biggest and last trauma, I crashed badly for a few years and then worked in high pressure jobs for 10 years. I ended up with my nervous system collapsing completely a year ago, and am finally getting the treatment I need. I have a lot of inflammations in my body, cluster migraines, IBS and I my nervous system has severely shut down because of pushing myself through work with untreated CPTSD.

At least I cannot see myself work  every day and not working any fixed schedule either. Am I wrong? Will I get THAT much better. I really don't think I have been ok after the last series of traumas.

\---- the background ----  
Trigger warning - skip the rest if you don't want to read about my traumas. I have tried to compress them, but they are quite many. My traumas started tiny and then grew and grew and grew till they became serious life threatening monsters.

1. My childhood? I adored my CEO dad and was needled by my Mayor mother, but neither of them ever helped me learn to accept my own feelings. It was all about being perfect in THEIR eyes. I guess that set me up for a life of hell... My mother wasn't too nice, though I don't think she was too bad either. Emotionally and even mentally abusive at times, but physically I had food, clothes, sleep, safety, etc. I came out of childhood wounded emotionally, but very confident physically.
2. I married at 20, and the man I married was mostly nice, but one day, out of nowhere, he violently attacked and raped me. We divorced, and he found a new girl immediately, but when she left him a few months later, he started stalking me and anyone I talked with. He attacked and beat me up on the street, threatened me, harassed me and he also beat up men I spoke to. It lastet for almost 2 years. I never told my family about any of it, and I lost all my friends as the guy stole them from me by lying about what had happened. I was too hurt to fight for them. I felt like they should have known better than to engage in his drama. So I was now without friends and sort of without family.
3. I went to another country as an exchange student in my 4th year of my Master's education, and he followed, even if he had no studies there. I met a man who became a good friend. He seemed very sweet and loving and he would sit in my bedroom, and sing me to sleep while my ex husband threw rocks on my window and screamed that I was a whore. One day, out of nowhere, this - previously beloved friend (gay, so not a romantic friend) - pulled out a knife to kill me. Just like that.  I barely escaped alive. I was diagnosed with PTSD after this murder attempt in a foreign country - at age 24. I have lived with death threats from this man ever since. The reason he wanted to kill me? Because he thought I was ""so nice"" and he wanted to ""feel how it feels to kill a beautiful and nice person, as killing a bad person wouldn't feel too horrible"". I don't get how such people exist, but it added to my fear of people, for sure. I never told anyone about this, as my family isn't that kind of supportive.  I crashed for around 6 months and was delayed in my studies by a year.
4. I escaped both men. Over the next years, I got kidnapped on the street twice and held hostage by two different men/group of men (and I live in the safest country in the world, so it's just weird how it all happens to me) and I was assaulted twice and had to fight two different men, on two different occasions a year apart, to not be raped. It was daytime and it was fancy theater cafés, so .... WHY ME? I started fearing going outside. ALL these people were unknown to me, and I am not very risky in any way, so god knows why it happened.)
5. Then, I married a very nice man, and we got 2 kids and had a very successful life together with good economy, a really nice house, nice car, nice, peaceful life and great careers. Unfortunately the man didn't want sex after we got kids, and that hurt a lot. But I stayed with him. I knew a good man wasn't that easy to find... I tried to get us therapy, but he wouldn't talk about it.
6. At age 34 I worked for a reknown company in a management position and my boss was both famous and rich. We went for a business trip to another country (the same one I had almost died in before, and he picked me to go with him as I spoke the language there). At some point, he tried to kiss me, but I told him I was married. He then pushed me backwards and held me so I was hanging off a ledge. He said ""it's an awful long way down if I let go of you, and noone would know it wasn't a fall if I tell them you fell, so maybe you will come in and go to bed with me?"" I didn't get raped, as I spent the whole evening seducing him while pouring him wine until he passed out and I could run off, but the terror from almost dying and almost getting raped, traumatized me a second time. I got another PTSD diagnosis. And this time I crashed for long. 2 years. And while I was struggling for my sanity at home, my boss fired me and accused me of ""sexually harassing him"". Yeah...
7. I had to go through a hellish trial to prove it was him harassing me and not vice versa, and despite winning, I was crushed in that trial. The asshole had the audacity to congratulate me afterwards with a ""I didn't think you had that in you. wow. You are the first person ever to beat me. That's so impressive. I thought I had crushed you"". Seriously creepy that such people exist. And yes, he's rich and famous so it was hard to live with. I couldn't tell anyone as it would probably just make them hate on me, and not him. :-/ Noone supported me. My husband said ""I know it's hard for you this ordeal and the trial, but it's too much for me. I cannot hear about what he did to you. So I was ALL alone in this. And on top I had to deal with new symptoms like fainting all over the place, ending up in hospital after hurting myself when I fell when passing out and being dizzy non stop. I also had debilitating nightmares and couldn't sleep. My husband and I drifted apart while I was going through my PTSD symptoms of dissociation and insomnia and waking up screaming in bed. We divorced as friends, and are still friends, but he isn't an emotional support, despite being a good guy. Very avoidant emotionally. I started working as a CEO of a company.
8. As i had noone to talk to, I turned to the internet, and I found a person to talk with. He was like the mother I never had. The perfect mirror. So sweet and loving. A year later I fell for him and he came to visit me. The next few months is a blur to me, and I didn't understand what hit me. He beat me up and blamed me and somehow made me confused about whose fault it was. Don't ask how. He was smart... in a very insidious way. He ended up killing my kid's pet, trapping me in my room, the kids in another room and putting my house on fire, furious when we didn't die, he tried to kill me several times, stole all my money, reported me to the police for all sort of stuff (nothing happened, as the police believed me, not him, but it was bad to experience it), created fake ""witness videos"" of people saying I wanted to kill him, got me under investigation for terror attempts and he threatened to have me killed at any point. I cannot even write here how bad it has been, and it never stopped. 12 years after he is gone, I'm still terrified every day, as I don't know where or when or if he'll show up suddenly. I sold my house with a loss and crashed. I was in hell for months both before he left and after. I was a prisoner in my own mind and body without understanding up and down. Literally couldn't see the difference. It's a form of dissociation. I crashed so badly I have no way to explain it. I sat for WEEKS. Months actually. On a sofa, nearly never sleeping, with a gun in my lap and stared into air. The gun was there to protect myself. I sent the kids to their father, obviously. I  couldn't see my own face for nearly 2 years. It was all scrambled in the mirror. The worst Picasso drawings looked more coherent. I had 40 - 60 panic attacks a day, it was so frequent I didn't even care in the end. It was just something my body went through. And I smoked 60 cigarettes a day. Needless to say, my work fell apart. I lost everything for a while.
9. I slowly rebuilt a work life over the past 12 years. I  worked in top management and as a CEO again but I had no other life. I isolated myself completely from most people. I only ever talk with my ex husband (the second one, yes) and our kids and a few friends  from before the last trauma now and then. I totally burned myself in work. After 2 years I got some weird brain fog symptoms, that I noticed got worse if I had coffee. I started having to have breaks and sleep in the bathroom at work for 20 minutes twice a day at work. Told noone. ""CEO sleeping in the bathroom again"", didn't seem like a good thing. 2 years later I got cluster migraine diagnosis. Then my body started having inflammations. My shoulders, my hips, my achilles, etc. It just got worse and worse until one day my nervous system shut down, and a year later I'm not doing too well yet.

And then my doc said ""I think you'll be back to work in no time"". I guess he thought it would encourage me, but I felt ONLY dread. I don't think I should have worked at all for these past 10 years. I was falling apart. I put on so much weight, too. I seriously am scared of working. I'm 51 years old now, and I don't want to ever work again, is the feeling I have. At least not a fixed schedule. Never. It's not about CEO positions, I wouldn't want a normal clerk job either, as I cannot deal with my nervous system at all. It takes all my energy.

I realize I may change my mind once I feel better. I am getting stabilization training atm and EMDR when I am ok enough to take it. But I'm feeling so scared of having to live like before. I get it that that isn't the point. That the doctor thinks I'll be ok again. But how? I mean, I am not even able to write this without it crashing me a bit. It took me hours. And talking with someone for a while can send me to bed for days.

Has anyone coped with their CPTSD by numbing themselves and then working themselves to nervous system collapse here? And if so, did you get back to work again? Is it realistic?

Oh, and I still live with threats coming my way ever 3 months or so. Just to add to the stress.",1,1749232530.0,ptsd,2,1.0,False
1l4yxe2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ServingRecipes2/comments/1l4yxe2/chocolate_chip_pancakes_5_tips_for_fluffy/,Chocolate Chip Pancakes: 5 Tips for Fluffy Perfection Every Time!,"# Chocolate Chip Pancakes: 5 Tips for Fluffy Perfection Every Time!

Who doesn’t love chocolate chip pancakes? Picture this: a stack of warm, fluffy pancakes, studded with gooey chocolate chips, drizzled with syrup, and possibly topped with a dollop of whipped cream. It’s breakfast heaven! But achieving that perfect texture isn’t as easy as it sounds. Let’s dive into some delightful tips to make your chocolate chip pancakes the fluffiest they can be.

## Choose Quality Ingredients

When it comes to baking, quality matters! Your *Chocolate Chip Pancakes* can only be as good as the ingredients you use. Here's what to focus on:

- **Flour Options**: Go for high-quality all-purpose flour to give your pancakes a solid foundation. 
- **Baking Powder**: Fresh baking powder is essential for that light, fluffy texture. If it’s been sitting in your pantry for too long, it’s time to replace it.
- **Chocolate Chips**: Don't skimp on the chocolate! Choose semi-sweet or even dark chocolate chips for that perfect balance of sweetness.
- **Dairy**: Fresh, whole milk or buttermilk can elevate the flavor and texture of your pancakes dramatically.

## The Importance of Sifting

When making *Chocolate Chip Pancakes*, sifting your dry ingredients can be a game changer. Here’s why:

- **Lightness**: Sifting adds air to the flour, making your pancakes light and fluffy.
- **Mixing**: It helps in evenly distributing the baking powder and salt.
- **Eliminating Clumps**: A smooth batter is essential for an even cook.

Next time you prepare your batter, take that extra minute to sift. Your taste buds will thank you!

## Don't Overmix the Batter

It’s tempting to mix your *Chocolate Chip Pancakes* batter until it’s completely smooth. But hold on! Here’s where patience pays off:

- **Gluten Development**: Overmixing can lead to tough, chewy pancakes, instead of the tenderness we crave.
- **Bubbles Matter**: Leave some lumps in your batter. Those little pockets of air will expand during cooking, creating a soft texture.

Mix gently until the ingredients just come together, and you’ll achieve pancake perfection. 

## Let the Batter Rest

Resting your batter might seem like a minor detail, but it can have a big impact on your *Chocolate Chip Pancakes*. Here’s why it’s a must:

- **Hydration**: Giving the batter time to sit allows the flour to fully hydrate. This leads to a better texture and more consistent sag in your pancakes.
- **Air Release**: Resting also allows some of the air bubbles to escape, which helps ensure that your pancakes won’t dome up too much when cooking.

Try letting your batter sit for around 15-30 minutes while you sip your coffee. It will be worth the wait!

## Cooking Tips for Golden Goodness

The cooking process is vital for achieving the perfect *Chocolate Chip Pancakes*. Here are some essentials for a golden-brown finish:

- **Preheat the Pan**: Make sure your skillet or griddle is adequately heated before pouring the batter on. A test drop of water should sizzle upon contact.
- **Timing**: Cook until you see bubbles forming on the surface—this means it's time to flip!
- **Heat Level**: Keep your heat on medium. If it's too high, you risk burning the pancakes while leaving the inside undercooked.
- **Proper Spacing**: Don't overcrowd the pan! Give each pancake enough room to expand.

These cooking tips will help ensure your *Chocolate Chip Pancakes* are not just tasty but also visually stunning!

## A Dash of Cultural History

Did you know that pancakes have a rich cultural history around the world? From the fluffy Japanese soufflé pancakes to the thinner, crepe-like versions seen in France, every culture has its take on this beloved dish. 

Chocolate chip pancakes, in particular, rose to fame in the United States around the mid-20th century. They became popular with the increase of packaged chocolate chips and are now a breakfast staple enjoyed by both children and adults alike!

Why not embrace this delightful cultural history with your next stack of *Chocolate Chip Pancakes?*

Before you head off to whip up a batch, make sure you’re fully equipped with an excellent recipe. Discover all the secrets for perfecting your pancakes by clicking here: [See Full Recipe](https://www.servingrecipe.com/chocolate-chip-pancakes/)

### In Conclusion

With these tips in mind, making *Chocolate Chip Pancakes* can turn into a joyous morning ritual rather than just a routine. Remember, good quality ingredients, careful mixing, allowing your batter to rest, and cooking with patience will lead to stacks of fluffy pancake bliss.

I studied for a total of four months with two being content review and two being mainly practice questions.

Content Phase: the main source I used for my content review was BootCamp’s 9-week study schedule, although there’s only 7 weeks of actual content. It’s very front loaded, the first 3 weeks took me an entire month and the last 4 took me one month. I used Sketchy Pharm + Micro in place of those videos on the schedule. I also did AnKing along with the videos, but was VERY selective in the cards I used. I also did 1 block of AMBOSS daily to humble myself (iykyk).

What I Would Change: Add Mehman PDFs and Pathoma 1-3.

Q-Bank Phase: for the first month I did the entirety of UW (3 blocks daily, 55% first pass average) and did UW cards for my incorrects. The second month (like 2-3 weeks not an entire month) I did practice tests every other day and did UW incorrects in the days between. I eventually got tired of incorrects and did a ton of AMBOSS premade study plans.

Scores (in the order done):
NBME 31: 64%
NBME 29: 65%
NBME 30: 70%
AMBOSS SA1: 215
UWSA1: 237
UWSA2: 224
NBME 28: 71%
Free 120: 73%

Open to any questions!! I hope this helps somebody bc I know I was very overwhelmed at the start!

Edit to add Test Day: I packed a ton of snacks, an extra coffee, chocolate as a treat, glasses wipes, chapstick, literally anything I thought I might need, and like 3 water bottles. It was extremely stressful and I had to gaslight myself every block that it’s the first one of the day.

She is 40 and by no mean dumb and gullible person but not sure, she lives in another country so i cant have access to her phone to see what exactly is going on but this is what she manages go explain to me

Some coworker convince her to join some kind of MLM where u invest X amount and u get 8.4% fixed return every day apparently, she invested 600euros which is like 1/3rd of her salary 

The procedure goes along the line, u make KuCoin account and you buy ETH and send to some address, after that the coworker gave her special link where she can sigh in and on that website or whatever it is u have account with eth wallet and every day she receives 48euros

She also told me the thing is called something along the line Credo/CredoAI, when i lookup that nothing really comes, there is legitimate kind of Ai called credo but she says its not that, and i cant have access like that thru google but i must be invited, she never forced me to join so its not like she is scamming me but like bragging that she is making money that way

Does anyone knows anything more about all that, i mean all this sounds so fishy but she says she also managed to transfer some ETH back to her KuCoin apparently and used it to spend with GooglePay and buy stuff in like the supermarket like water and coffee or whatnot

So she definitely has some money on there but also not sure, if it really is a scam which i really believe any help or proof or anything would be greatly appreciated, thanks!

EDIT: She also says the coworker was flexing to her how she has 60k made only from that in span of  3 or 4 months which im trying to tell her it not indefinite proof, plus she ways when u invest there are packages its not like i can invest however much i want it must be either 30 180 300 600 1200 2400 6000 12000 or 24800 dollars/euros so thats also huge red flag to me but she swears she hit the jackpot and i shouldn't tell anyone about it 

Asked her for that ""invitation link"" like couple hours ago today but she says the website is down thru the weekend and its on maintenance untill sunday 23:00 local time, apparently it says they are migrating to an official app not just random website so another red flag to me but not her clearly so im really desperate to help her not deposit more or maybe even worse somehow get her bank account drained by putting the card in the wrong site",0,1749232479.0,CryptoCurrency,9,0.5,False

Hey all! I'm a big steak lover, but the shared grills at my apartment are often taken, so I’m looking for something I can use inside my unit. I’ve been looking into the Ninja Foodi grills, but I’m confused about the differences between the models and why the pricing doesn’t seem to match the features.

Here are the three models I’m considering:

* **IG651 (7-in-1)** – around **$199**
* **DG551 (6-in-1)** – around **$299**
* **FG551 (6-in-1)** – around **$279**

So here’s where I’m confused: the 7-in-1 model is **over $100 cheaper** than both 6-in-1 options. Wouldn't the 7-in-1 technically be the better product since it offers more functions? It seems like a no-brainer to go with the IG651, but I’m wondering if I’m missing something important.

There aren’t many great comparison videos out there, so I’m hoping someone here can break down the key differences. Why is the IG651 cheaper despite having more functions? Is there a catch?

Hi all! I’m a cheap college student but I love espresso and want to make it at home. I’m not just looking for a good end product and long run savings- I enjoy picking up hobbies/new skills and clearly espresso falls in that category. After a long period of research I found a good deal on an open box D40+ grinder from mii coffee (the same as the Turin SD40)- they only had one left so I pulled the trigger. I’m an eBay and Facebook marketplace fiend in all areas of life but realized that everyone selling a good grinder knows their worth. For my machine, I think it’ll be easier to find a steal but I’m still debating exactly what I want and waiting for a really good deal in thrift stores or online (I’m cheap but patient).

In the meantime, I would love opinions on a smaller/manual espresso tool. This isn’t just for the in-between: if I found an awesome machine tomorrow, I’d still want a smaller tool to travel with, or if I’m in a rush in the morning. I’m debating between a French press, aeropress, and moka pot, all of which I can find for cheap. What’s the richest/most espresso-like coffee from these options (or others that i haven’t heard of in this category?).

1l4yoit,https://i.redd.it/o7xdm4imgc5f1.jpeg,PUBLIC UTILITY: You NEED to learn how to fix electronics so you AVOID GOING HUNGRY in the near future!,"Listen to me. Everyone thinks life is going to stay the way it is, that there will always be jobs in apps, customer service, office work, design, editing, dubbing, writing. Everyone is fooling themselves cuz the world is changing really fast. AIs are no longer a novelty, they’re an avalanche. They’re already making videos, music, scripts, marketing, images, code, voice and everything else better than us, faster than us, and for free. Who's going to hire a human if there's a machine that doesn’t complain, doesn’t get tired, doesn’t ask for a salary, doesn’t show up late, and doesn’t make mistakes?

What’s coming is a revolution that’s going to pull the rug out from under millions of people who studied, invested, dedicated themselves and will end up on the streets not because they were bad but because they were replaced. And you know what’s left for those who got replaced? Misery, slums, garbage dumps. People digging through their homes looking for anything to sell for scrap. That already happens every day here in Brasil. Now imagine that on a national and global scale. The future is looking more and more like a dystopian movie and that’s no exaggeration. Like Elysium + Mad Max.

A scenario of mass unemployment where traditional jobs disappear. Where people have to hustle, work informally, or create their own income just to survive. A world where brothels, gambling dens, illegal racing, underground fighting, trafficking, and everything rotten explodes because people will abandon their values out of desperation.

But not everything is lost. There’s still one kind of job that machines can’t do at least not yet, and maybe not for a long time. I’m talking about electronics repair. Yes, fixing electronics. Taking a dead TV, a broken microwave, a cracked phone screen, and making it work again. That’s gold in the middle of chaos, that’s what will separate those who eat from those who starve, those with a roof from those sleeping on wet floors.

Learning to repair electronics is one of the few real ways out left. First, because it’s practical: you can start with little: a simple bench, a soldering iron, a multimeter, and a few basic tools. Second, because it doesn’t take a college degree or years of study. There are tech courses, YouTube videos, and manuals. Third, because stuff always breaks: phones, TVs, radios, speakers, laptops... everything breaks. And a lot of people won’t have the money to buy new stuff in a scenario of widespread unemployment then they’ll want repairs. Just like today but on a scale a thousand times bigger. Demand is going to explode.

Another thing: once you learn electronics, you can grow. Start by changing connectors and resistors, then move on to boards, sensors, and systems. You can build new stuff, invent, improvise. In a collapse scenario, this will be like magic, like alchemy. Knowing how to make a battery last longer, fix an old radio, restore a power supply that’s the new superpower. People with that skill will be in demand. Those who know how to make working “gambiarras” will be respected.

And more: this kind of skill opens the door to self-employment. No need for a boss. You get your own clients. You can charge per part, per service, even barter. In a broken world, this is survival. In a world where factories and offices shut down, the repairman survives. The technician stays useful. The rest disappears.

It’ll take a long time before each nation has robots that fix other robots. That’ll be only for a few, for industries. The general population will have to fend for themselves and that’s where the technicians, the tinkerers, the improvisers come in.

*MANUAL WORK DOESN’T GO AWAY*

So listen to what I’m saying: don’t wait for the official announcement. There won’t be one! When you realize it, it’ll be too late! You’ll look around and only see desperate people with no jobs, no income, no direction. All that’ll be left is the basics and fixing electronics is basic, it’s a hands-on skill, it’s a solution, it’s a life tool.

If you still have a bit of sense, start today. Go for it. Buy a simple soldering iron. Grab an old device and try to open it. Research. Study. Train. Because the future is coming, and it won’t forgive the unprepared. If you don’t know how to do something useful with your hands, you’ll be swallowed whole. But if you know how to bring a broken device back to life, you’ll have food. You’ll have a way to live. You’ll have a way to keep going.

The world is heading toward a scrappunk dystopia. It’s no longer going to be about doing maintenance on factory-made electronics like we know today. It’ll be about creating, adapting, pirating, unlocking, and patching things up with whatever you’ve got nearby. And that’s where the true role of the electronics technician of the future comes in: he’ll have to become a hardcore Maker, like Wagner Moura’s character in Elysium.

1. Will there be a market for that during the collapse?
At first, yes. The screwed middle class will go looking for a tech because buying new won’t be an option. Even if electronics get a little cheaper with AI manufacturing, the issue won’t be price but it’ll be the lack of money. People will be broke.
When things get even worse, demand won’t disappear, it’ll change. It won’t be “fix my phone” anymore, it’ll be like: “Make this antenna get signal again,” “Turn this old radio into a speaker,” “Hook this solar panel to this broken inverter.”

There’ll be slums, junkyards, militias, gangs. But there will also be hidden workshops, warehouses where a guy knows how to build a board with recycled parts, how to turn a power bank battery into a power source for a router, how to forge a sensor with Arduino and hacks.

These guys will be the only ones with real utility. They’ll fix crashed drones, unlock control chips on electric cars, hack tracking systems, make equipment work with makeshift solutions. And the currency won’t just be money. Got it? It’ll be food, sex, shelter, protection, favors, influence, etc.

2. Will new stuff be so cheap that fixing won’t be worth it?
Maybe but only for those with cash. But again: the masses will be broke.
Plus, the world will be under total control of mega corporations. The cheap stuff coming out of AI will come with trackers, remote locks, user contracts, monthly subscriptions, and full network dependency. You bought it but it’s not yours. Just like disc games and digital games.

It won’t work offline. It won’t let you change a part. It won’t boot without authentication. Like an iPhone with Face ID that bricks if you open it outside the authorized repair.
Worse: no network, no permission = dead device.

Now, who’s the only one that can bypass that? The maker tech. The guy who knows how to open, cut, solder, reprogram, remove authentication chips, install pirate firmware, reverse-engineer. Even better: the guy who can build a new device using parts from 10 different scraps. He prints the casing with a 3D printer, solders the board, glues it together with superglue, and makes a functional hack that bypasses the system of the big techs.

These guys will become local heroes.
People will trust them more than the company that sells locked-down garbage.

3. What about manufacturer locks? “Death by contract”?
It’s already started. Tesla, Apple, John Deere, Sony... everything locked down. Try to open it? It locks. Try to change the battery? Warranty void. Try to access outside the official network? Shuts down. That’s what’ll make maker techs indispensable. They’ll be the pirates of the future. The ones who unlock, bypass, reinvent.

It won’t be about “fixing” the product as it was. It’ll be about fooling the system, subverting the machine’s logic, making it work your way to survive.

A maker tech will know how to take the screen from a burned phone and use it in a homemade solar power system, how to use an old processor to run an irrigation setup, how to use a 3D printer to make security robot parts and weapons, or turn an old saw into a mechanical arm.

It’s like Wagner Moura in Elysium, building an exoskeleton from scratch, using old industrial machines all without anyone’s permission. That guy survives because he doesn’t depend on the company or the government: he does what needs to be done. And everyone stuck outside that “technological paradise” will depend on someone like that.

If you want to have any market value whether in a slum or a war zone you need to learn electronics with scrap.
You need to know how to 3d print parts, solder circuits, hack firmware.
There won’t be tech support, original parts, or official apps. It’s brutal.

Im begging you: Think about it. It’s NOW or *never*.

1l4yo17,https://www.reddit.com/r/analyzeme/comments/1l4yo17/why_premature_texting_might_derail_newly_formed/,Why premature texting might derail newly formed relationships,"I’d like to share some thoughts about texting and why premature texting creates a false sense of intimacy, which can actually be detrimental for a relationship -- or even derail it before it gets off the ground.

When I was dating back in the 1970s and 80s, there were no computers, no smartphones, and no such thing as texting. The only way to communicate with a girl was to talk on a landline telephone, or to meet in person.

I'd meet a girl in class or at work, and ask her for her phone number.  We'd set up a date, and spend time, in person over many weeks and months, meeting occasionally at coffee shops or cafes, walking in parks, seeing movies, looking into one another's eyes, feeling one another's energy, learning about one another.

The only reason to speak on the phone was to set up dates, although occasionally we'd chat on the phone if we had the time to do so.

When we did speak on the phone, we had a pretty good idea of what the other person was like, since we had already developed a relationship by spending time in one another's company.  If we were talking on the phone, for example, and I told her a story about something that happened at work, I could imagine in my mind's eye how she would be reacting on the other end of the line.  Similarly, she could imagine my face, the look in my eyes as I was telling her the story.  I knew what would make her laugh, and I was even able to interpret her laugh... as well of course as her tone of voice and her overall demeanor.

**There was a personal context for the phone conversation.**

Now fast forward to 2025.   From what I have been reading on Reddit, it seems that it is now standard to meet a person online, and then *to begin texting one another before actually meeting in person.*

These texts can be ""good morning"" or ""good night"" messages; ""have a good day"" messages; and they can also be long essays in which one or both people talk about their lives, their hopes and dreams, and describe themselves in great detail, what they like, how they view the world, *how they feel about things*, and so on.

The intention seems to be to lay the groundwork for an in person meeting.  According to what thousands of young people writing on Reddit report, they think they are getting to know one another and are starting to “feel close” when they text each other in this way.

But it's important to remember that you’re still communicating with a relative stranger... someone either you have never met, or someone perhaps that you might have met once or twice.  They have NOT looked into your eyes, have NOT felt your energy, and therefore cannot really ""know"" you in any real sense.  

They cannot know with any certainty how you will be reacting when they send a text about a certain subject… especially one that involves personal details or feelings.V

But they can definitely ""imagine"" what you are like.

In other words, **there’s a certain in-person context that is missing**, at least in the initial stages.

I believe that this explains in large part why, for example, a young woman will post here on Reddit that “our texting went really well and we became very close, but then after the first or second date,  he lost complete interest in me and I have not heard back from him.“

There could be many reasons for this, but I believe that it is mostly due to the fact that as the guy got to know the girl in ""real life,"" he detected or perceived a disconnect between the person he **imagined** her to be from the text messages he received, and the person that he discovered that she actually was.  (This dynamic works both ways, of course.)

Put another way, the fantasy differed substantially from the reality.

For what it’s worth, the only people that I text are very good friends / well established partners who know me, people who will be able to know fairly well how I’m reacting to what they text me. Those are just some random thoughts for folks to think about and consider if you are so disposed.",1,1749231902.0,analyzeme,0,1.0,False

To be fair, I have always been the breadwinner and managed the finances, so he hasn't had access to his own personal funds or known if/when we had extra money for things unless he asks. We aren't rich people either, so it could potentially cause a problem if he were to buy something without asking about it first. He hasn't held a job for more than three months since we've been together, but I have a disabled adult child from my first marriage who needs care and supervision 24/7, so it just kind of worked out that I go out and make money while my husband stays home to care for my son. This arrangement works well for the most part, and I never really got too upset for not having received gifts all of these years due to the financial situation as well as the fact that my husband rarely leaves the house, so the opportunity to shop isn't really there. Gift giving is my love language, but I can also accept that it doesn't seem to be his. 

My husband seems perfectly content to be at home almost constantly, but after we adopted a second dog, he started taking the dogs to the local dog park not far from our house. Our new dog was really social and needed the interaction with other dogs who were willing to play with him. My husband quickly became a regular at the dog park and made friends with the other regulars. One of these regulars was a young single woman who owned a dog that our dog became best buddies with. During one visit to the dog park, our dog was attacked by another dog and the trauma caused him to become dog selective after that. My husband could no longer trust him at the dog park because he began to show aggression toward random other dogs, so they stopped going. 

Fast forward to about a year after he stopped going to the dog park...we were out on a rare outing together (something we rarely get to do because there is seldom a break from caring for my disabled son). We were at a coffee shop and he noticed that his friend from the dog park, the young woman who owns our dog's best friend, was there. This was the first time I had ever met her. She isn't really attractive in the traditional sense or someone that would have you worrying that your husband has a crush, but there was definitely something intangible between them. They spoke briefly and he introduced me, but I wasn't upset by the interaction or anything. After leaving the coffee shop, we went to a flea market. There was a vendor there selling homemade dog treats and little wooden magnets with dog faces on them. My husband picked out some treats for our dogs and was digging through the magnets, presumably looking for one that resembled one of our dogs. He pulls out a magnet with a lab on it, and commented that it looked like THAT woman's dog, and bought it! So, obviously not for us to have, because why would we want a magnet with a random dog that isn't ours on it? Clearly it was meant to be a gift for her. Am I right? This small act really cut me deep.

1l4yjzl,https://i.redd.it/4wl506upfc5f1.jpeg,PUBLIC UTILITY: You NEED to learn how to fix electronics so you AVOID GOING HUNGRY in the near future!,"Listen to me. Everyone thinks life is going to stay the way it is, that there will always be jobs in apps, customer service, office work, design, editing, dubbing, writing. Everyone is fooling themselves cuz the world is changing really fast. AIs are no longer a novelty, they’re an avalanche. They’re already making videos, music, scripts, marketing, images, code, voice and everything else better than us, faster than us, and for free. Who's going to hire a human if there's a machine that doesn’t complain, doesn’t get tired, doesn’t ask for a salary, doesn’t show up late, and doesn’t make mistakes?

What’s coming is a revolution that’s going to pull the rug out from under millions of people who studied, invested, dedicated themselves and will end up on the streets not because they were bad but because they were replaced. And you know what’s left for those who got replaced? Misery, slums, garbage dumps. People digging through their homes looking for anything to sell for scrap. That already happens every day here in Brasil. Now imagine that on a national and global scale. The future is looking more and more like a dystopian movie and that’s no exaggeration. Like Elysium + Mad Max.

A scenario of mass unemployment where traditional jobs disappear. Where people have to hustle, work informally, or create their own income just to survive. A world where brothels, gambling dens, illegal racing, underground fighting, trafficking, and everything rotten explodes because people will abandon their values out of desperation.

But not everything is lost. There’s still one kind of job that machines can’t do at least not yet, and maybe not for a long time. I’m talking about electronics repair. Yes, fixing electronics. Taking a dead TV, a broken microwave, a cracked phone screen, and making it work again. That’s gold in the middle of chaos, that’s what will separate those who eat from those who starve, those with a roof from those sleeping on wet floors.

Learning to repair electronics is one of the few real ways out left. First, because it’s practical: you can start with little: a simple bench, a soldering iron, a multimeter, and a few basic tools. Second, because it doesn’t take a college degree or years of study. There are tech courses, YouTube videos, and manuals. Third, because stuff always breaks: phones, TVs, radios, speakers, laptops... everything breaks. And a lot of people won’t have the money to buy new stuff in a scenario of widespread unemployment then they’ll want repairs. Just like today but on a scale a thousand times bigger. Demand is going to explode.

Another thing: once you learn electronics, you can grow. Start by changing connectors and resistors, then move on to boards, sensors, and systems. You can build new stuff, invent, improvise. In a collapse scenario, this will be like magic, like alchemy. Knowing how to make a battery last longer, fix an old radio, restore a power supply that’s the new superpower. People with that skill will be in demand. Those who know how to make working “gambiarras” will be respected.

And more: this kind of skill opens the door to self-employment. No need for a boss. You get your own clients. You can charge per part, per service, even barter. In a broken world, this is survival. In a world where factories and offices shut down, the repairman survives. The technician stays useful. The rest disappears.

It’ll take a long time before each nation has robots that fix other robots. That’ll be only for a few, for industries. The general population will have to fend for themselves and that’s where the technicians, the tinkerers, the improvisers come in.

*MANUAL WORK DOESN’T GO AWAY*

So listen to what I’m saying: don’t wait for the official announcement. There won’t be one! When you realize it, it’ll be too late! You’ll look around and only see desperate people with no jobs, no income, no direction. All that’ll be left is the basics and fixing electronics is basic, it’s a hands-on skill, it’s a solution, it’s a life tool.

If you still have a bit of sense, start today. Go for it. Buy a simple soldering iron. Grab an old device and try to open it. Research. Study. Train. Because the future is coming, and it won’t forgive the unprepared. If you don’t know how to do something useful with your hands, you’ll be swallowed whole. But if you know how to bring a broken device back to life, you’ll have food. You’ll have a way to live. You’ll have a way to keep going.

The world is heading toward a scrappunk dystopia. It’s no longer going to be about doing maintenance on factory-made electronics like we know today. It’ll be about creating, adapting, pirating, unlocking, and patching things up with whatever you’ve got nearby. And that’s where the true role of the electronics technician of the future comes in: he’ll have to become a hardcore Maker, like Wagner Moura’s character in Elysium.

1. Will there be a market for that during the collapse?
At first, yes. The screwed middle class will go looking for a tech because buying new won’t be an option. Even if electronics get a little cheaper with AI manufacturing, the issue won’t be price but it’ll be the lack of money. People will be broke.
When things get even worse, demand won’t disappear, it’ll change. It won’t be “fix my phone” anymore, it’ll be like: “Make this antenna get signal again,” “Turn this old radio into a speaker,” “Hook this solar panel to this broken inverter.”

There’ll be slums, junkyards, militias, gangs. But there will also be hidden workshops, warehouses where a guy knows how to build a board with recycled parts, how to turn a power bank battery into a power source for a router, how to forge a sensor with Arduino and hacks.

These guys will be the only ones with real utility. They’ll fix crashed drones, unlock control chips on electric cars, hack tracking systems, make equipment work with makeshift solutions. And the currency won’t just be money. Got it? It’ll be food, sex, shelter, protection, favors, influence, etc.

2. Will new stuff be so cheap that fixing won’t be worth it?
Maybe but only for those with cash. But again: the masses will be broke.
Plus, the world will be under total control of mega corporations. The cheap stuff coming out of AI will come with trackers, remote locks, user contracts, monthly subscriptions, and full network dependency. You bought it but it’s not yours. Just like disc games and digital games.

It won’t work offline. It won’t let you change a part. It won’t boot without authentication. Like an iPhone with Face ID that bricks if you open it outside the authorized repair.
Worse: no network, no permission = dead device.

Now, who’s the only one that can bypass that? The maker tech. The guy who knows how to open, cut, solder, reprogram, remove authentication chips, install pirate firmware, reverse-engineer. Even better: the guy who can build a new device using parts from 10 different scraps. He prints the casing with a 3D printer, solders the board, glues it together with superglue, and makes a functional hack that bypasses the system of the big techs.

These guys will become local heroes.
People will trust them more than the company that sells locked-down garbage.

3. What about manufacturer locks? “Death by contract”?
It’s already started. Tesla, Apple, John Deere, Sony... everything locked down. Try to open it? It locks. Try to change the battery? Warranty void. Try to access outside the official network? Shuts down. That’s what’ll make maker techs indispensable. They’ll be the pirates of the future. The ones who unlock, bypass, reinvent.

It won’t be about “fixing” the product as it was. It’ll be about fooling the system, subverting the machine’s logic, making it work your way to survive.

A maker tech will know how to take the screen from a burned phone and use it in a homemade solar power system, how to use an old processor to run an irrigation setup, how to use a 3D printer to make security robot parts and weapons, or turn an old saw into a mechanical arm.

It’s like Wagner Moura in Elysium, building an exoskeleton from scratch, using old industrial machines all without anyone’s permission. That guy survives because he doesn’t depend on the company or the government: he does what needs to be done. And everyone stuck outside that “technological paradise” will depend on someone like that.

If you want to have any market value whether in a slum or a war zone you need to learn electronics with scrap.
You need to know how to 3d print parts, solder circuits, hack firmware.
There won’t be tech support, original parts, or official apps. It’s brutal.

Im begging you: Think about it. It’s NOW or *never*.

My goal was to make something robust and memorable, the kind of lettering that could live on a sign, cup, or tote bag and still feel like the brand. I avoided using a base font and instead drew everything from scratch, aiming for something that feels unique but still functional.

That said, I’ve run into some issues. The heaviness of the forms starts to work against me when the logo is reduced in size, it gets muddy and hard to read. I'm wondering if adding **ink traps** might help with that, or if I should reconsider some of the weight distribution and negative space.

Anyway, I fumbled like a moron and knocked my coffee over. A good splash went across the desk, straight onto the notebook and my phone. I just sat there thinking, “well, that’s it.”



But somehow, nothing got ruined. The notebook’s cover repelled the coffee like it had a built-in raincoat, and even the first page dried without any warping. What really surprised me though was my phone. The coffee just beaded up and rolled off the screen. I realized I hadn’t even installed the ESR Armorite screen protector yet, it was just sitting on top while I was getting ready to apply it. Still saved my phone.



So yeah, apparently both the notebook and the screen protector make decent spill guards when it counts. I’ve half-jokingly started keeping them nearby like backup coasters.

Like Elysium + Mad Max.

A scenario of mass unemployment where traditional jobs disappear. Where people have to hustle, work informally, or create their own income just to survive. A world where brothels, gambling dens, illegal racing, underground fighting, trafficking, and everything rotten explodes because people will abandon their values out of desperation.

But not everything is lost. There’s still one kind of job that machines can’t do at least not yet, and maybe not for a long time. I’m talking about electronics repair. Yes, fixing electronics. Taking a dead TV, a broken microwave, a cracked phone screen, and making it work again. That’s gold in the middle of chaos, that’s what will separate those who eat from those who starve, those with a roof from those sleeping on wet floors.

Learning to repair electronics is one of the few real ways out left. First, because it’s practical: you can start with little: a simple bench, a soldering iron, a multimeter, and a few basic tools. Second, because it doesn’t take a college degree or years of study. There are tech courses, YouTube videos, and manuals. Third, because stuff always breaks: phones, TVs, radios, speakers, laptops... everything breaks. And a lot of people won’t have the money to buy new stuff in a scenario of widespread unemployment then they’ll want repairs. Just like today but on a scale a thousand times bigger. Demand is going to explode.

Another thing: once you learn electronics, you can grow. Start by changing connectors and resistors, then move on to boards, sensors, and systems. You can build new stuff, invent, improvise. In a collapse scenario, this will be like magic, like alchemy. Knowing how to make a battery last longer, fix an old radio, restore a power supply that’s the new superpower. People with that skill will be in demand. Those who know how to make working “gambiarras” will be respected.

And more: this kind of skill opens the door to self-employment. No need for a boss. You get your own clients. You can charge per part, per service, even barter. In a broken world, this is survival. In a world where factories and offices shut down, the repairman survives. The technician stays useful. The rest disappears.

It’ll take a long time before each nation has robots that fix other robots. That’ll be only for a few, for industries. The general population will have to fend for themselves and that’s where the technicians, the tinkerers, the improvisers come in.

*MANUAL WORK DOESN’T GO AWAY*

So listen to what I’m saying: don’t wait for the official announcement. There won’t be one! When you realize it, it’ll be too late! You’ll look around and only see desperate people with no jobs, no income, no direction. All that’ll be left is the basics and fixing electronics is basic, it’s a hands-on skill, it’s a solution, it’s a life tool.

If you still have a bit of sense, start today. Go for it. Buy a simple soldering iron. Grab an old device and try to open it. Research. Study. Train. Because the future is coming, and it won’t forgive the unprepared. If you don’t know how to do something useful with your hands, you’ll be swallowed whole. But if you know how to bring a broken device back to life, you’ll have food. You’ll have a way to live. You’ll have a way to keep going.

The world is heading toward a scrappunk dystopia. It’s no longer going to be about doing maintenance on factory-made electronics like we know today. It’ll be about creating, adapting, pirating, unlocking, and patching things up with whatever you’ve got nearby. And that’s where the true role of the electronics technician of the future comes in: he’ll have to become a hardcore Maker, like Wagner Moura’s character in Elysium.

1. Will there be a market for that during the collapse?
At first, yes. The screwed middle class will go looking for a tech because buying new won’t be an option. Even if electronics get a little cheaper with AI manufacturing, the issue won’t be price but it’ll be the lack of money. People will be broke.
When things get even worse, demand won’t disappear, it’ll change. It won’t be “fix my phone” anymore, it’ll be like: “Make this antenna get signal again,” “Turn this old radio into a speaker,” “Hook this solar panel to this broken inverter.”

There’ll be slums, junkyards, militias, gangs. But there will also be hidden workshops, warehouses where a guy knows how to build a board with recycled parts, how to turn a power bank battery into a power source for a router, how to forge a sensor with Arduino and hacks.

These guys will be the only ones with real utility. They’ll fix crashed drones, unlock control chips on electric cars, hack tracking systems, make equipment work with makeshift solutions. And the currency won’t just be money. Got it? It’ll be food, sex, shelter, protection, favors, influence, etc.

2. Will new stuff be so cheap that fixing won’t be worth it?
Maybe but only for those with cash. But again: the masses will be broke.
Plus, the world will be under total control of mega corporations. The cheap stuff coming out of AI will come with trackers, remote locks, user contracts, monthly subscriptions, and full network dependency. You bought it but it’s not yours. Just like disc games and digital games.

It won’t work offline. It won’t let you change a part. It won’t boot without authentication. Like an iPhone with Face ID that bricks if you open it outside the authorized repair.
Worse: no network, no permission = dead device.

Now, who’s the only one that can bypass that? The maker tech. The guy who knows how to open, cut, solder, reprogram, remove authentication chips, install pirate firmware, reverse-engineer. Even better: the guy who can build a new device using parts from 10 different scraps. He prints the casing with a 3D printer, solders the board, glues it together with superglue, and makes a functional hack that bypasses the system of the big techs.

These guys will become local heroes.
People will trust them more than the company that sells locked-down garbage.

3. What about manufacturer locks? “Death by contract”?
It’s already started. Tesla, Apple, John Deere, Sony... everything locked down. Try to open it? It locks. Try to change the battery? Warranty void. Try to access outside the official network? Shuts down. That’s what’ll make maker techs indispensable. They’ll be the pirates of the future. The ones who unlock, bypass, reinvent.

It won’t be about “fixing” the product as it was. It’ll be about fooling the system, subverting the machine’s logic, making it work your way to survive.

A maker tech will know how to take the screen from a burned phone and use it in a homemade solar power system, how to use an old processor to run an irrigation setup, how to use a 3D printer to make security robot parts and weapons, or turn an old saw into a mechanical arm.

It’s like Wagner Moura in Elysium, building an exoskeleton from scratch, using old industrial machines all without anyone’s permission. That guy survives because he doesn’t depend on the company or the government: he does what needs to be done. And everyone stuck outside that “technological paradise” will depend on someone like that.

If you want to have any market value whether in a slum or a war zone you need to learn electronics with scrap.
You need to know how to 3d print parts, solder circuits, hack firmware.
There won’t be tech support, original parts, or official apps. It’s brutal.

Im begging you: Think about it. It’s NOW or *never*.

Major thing is take each meal and build it around protein,

 Protein first, if you having say a texan steak, that's protein and fat, no need to add in additional fat, you just add in carbs, Easier way to achieve your protein target.Trying to stay in your calories? Take your total calories and divide it by your meals per day & you have a set calorie target per meal, Same thing with macros. If you go over, draw the additional calories from your other meals, especially snacks.I'll use myself as an example, i have 4x meals a day, 

My protein target is 117g, that's 468cal, My fat is normally 50g but if i hit 40-45g, then its good, I use 40-50g for Testosterone production, that makes it [40g-360cal.So](http://40g-360cal.So) calories is 1496cal. Each meal has a limit of 374cal,protein has a target of 29-30g, fat is 10g and remaining goes towards carbs. That way you ensure your macros are in line with your calories.Importantly too for people like myself, who drinks a lot of coffee...

Track your milk intake, 100ml of full cream milk is 63cal, I'd recommend dropping it by half, you cut down slightly on fat and protein but your calories at the end of the day is dropped by a lot. Think of it this way, if you have 6 cups, that's 378cal, dropping it to 50-60ml, its only 228cal",1,1749231012.0,loseit,0,0.67,False

Picked this one up on a whim thinking it’d be just another cute shoulder bag to rotate in, but I’ve honestly been using it every day since. It nails that in-between of “stylish enough to wear out” and “practical enough to actually use.” The faux leather looks way more premium than I expected, and it’s held up well through some serious daily wear.

It fits just enough. Phone, small wallet, keys, a lip balm or two, and the interior zipper pocket keeps everything in place. I wear it crossbody when I’m running errands, but it works just as well slung over one shoulder when I want a more polished vibe.

What really sold me was how lightweight it is. I’ve owned bulkier designer-style bags that end up hurting my shoulder or digging in, this one doesn’t do that at all. It’s also super easy to wipe clean (a bonus if you're dealing with coffee runs and commuting chaos).

For something simple, affordable, and still put-together, this has become kind of a staple. Would recommend if you’re looking for a solid everyday bag that doesn’t try too hard but still looks great.",1,1749230966.0,eBayItemReviews,0,1.0,False

On online dating I find only girls who want to play the drinking scam.

I’d be happy to share coffee, some food, and a bit of chat. Just not to be alone every day.

I’d prefer to meet local people rather than only tourists with organized tours.

Few years back I did the scooter trip of Hanoi and then we went for dinner with the guides and that was a lot of fun.

any local dating site or maybe language exchange or meetup or something which would allow me to mingle with locals? Doesn’t have to end up 1on1, a group would be also fun, but I’d imagine they would prefer to speak Vietnamese.

On online dating, once I say “I don’t drink alcohol” many girls unmatch me (yeah!) but one girl said we can meet tomorrow for dinner. I thought I would pick the restaurant to avoid the usual scams but she said it’s better and cheaper to meet for street food and she sent a Google maps link of a corner in the old quarter, but not the link of an actual place and she says she doesn’t use insta.

I (22f) and my bf (29m) having been dating for almost 5 months now, known each other for 6. yes we haven’t been together that long but it feels like it’s been long. basically we met at my work, he was a customer and asked me for my number and we hit it off pretty great from there. started dating about a month later. One day after going out the night prior i had woken up to his phone playing a show and he was still asleep. i went through his phone (mistake). found he still had hinge and was messaging girls, asking them to get coffee sometime, but never actually met up with any of them. i confronted him and forgave him because it was still very early in our relationship. the thing is he only deleted the hinge app so i knew his account was still on there. so i went on to hinge myself, made a fake account, set the location, race, age all to match his and found it. i gave him a like and deleted the app but would check everyday to see if he would ever like me back (indicating he redownloaded the app). it had a been a while and one day i was at work planning on going to his house after and i logged into the app and saw he had liked me. i was devastated. i went to his house and confronted him again. basically i end up giving him another chance. fast forward a month or so and i go on his phone again and find he had literally asked girls for their numbers while he was out with his friends. i was about to leave him but i forgave him again. i know i sound fucking stupid but i just kept thinking it’s still early and maybe he will get better, i know he loves me. ever since then i have only checked his phone once but i really want to do it again. i just still feel like my trust is being betrayed and whenever i think that im usually always right. recently, he’s been working A LOT. i mean he always works a lot, he’s in sales and works from home. and he also is in a sales training class which drives him more into his job. he also has been playing in a. lot of golf tournaments, so our time together has been limited. i usually stay at his house 90% of the time so we do spend a lot of time together but it doesn’t feel like we’re with each other. he’s always got his mind on work, golf, his training, etc. he never really goes out of his was to make plans with me, plan dates, it’s always kind of me saying like hey wanna go do something tonight? and even if we are doing something together thats supposed to be us time, his mind is still clearly on something else. and i don’t know what to do. it feels like i am on the back burner while he works his life away. and he doesn’t even know what he’s working towards, and says he feels like he doesn’t work enough. i’m at the age where i want to find a serious life partner, and im not sure i want to have someone who is working all the time and not prioritizing time with me and building our relationship. i understand people need to work and for the life i want to have i understand my partner will need to work a great deal, but even with downtime i still feel like im just, there. i want to feel like he’s excited to spend time with me and relieved that im there when he’s done working, but it doesn’t feel like that. what should i do?

1l4y7rw,https://i.redd.it/sw5hpgh9dc5f1.jpeg,PUBLIC UTILITY: You NEED to learn how to fix electronics so you AVOID GOING HUNGRY in the near future!,"Listen to me. Everyone thinks life is going to stay the way it is, that there will always be jobs in apps, customer service, office work, design, editing, dubbing, writing. Everyone is fooling themselves cuz the world is changing really fast. AIs are no longer a novelty, they’re an avalanche. They’re already making videos, music, scripts, marketing, images, code, voice and everything else better than us, faster than us, and for free. Who's going to hire a human if there's a machine that doesn’t complain, doesn’t get tired, doesn’t ask for a salary, doesn’t show up late, and doesn’t make mistakes?

What’s coming is a revolution that’s going to pull the rug out from under millions of people who studied, invested, dedicated themselves and will end up on the streets not because they were bad but because they were replaced. And you know what’s left for those who got replaced? Misery, slums, garbage dumps. People digging through their homes looking for anything to sell for scrap. That already happens every day here in Brasil. Now imagine that on a national and global scale. The future is looking more and more like a dystopian movie and that’s no exaggeration. Like Elysium + Mad Max.

A scenario of mass unemployment where traditional jobs disappear. Where people have to hustle, work informally, or create their own income just to survive. A world where brothels, gambling dens, illegal racing, underground fighting, trafficking, and everything rotten explodes because people will abandon their values out of desperation.

But not everything is lost. There’s still one kind of job that machines can’t do at least not yet, and maybe not for a long time. I’m talking about electronics repair. Yes, fixing electronics. Taking a dead TV, a broken microwave, a cracked phone screen, and making it work again. That’s gold in the middle of chaos, that’s what will separate those who eat from those who starve, those with a roof from those sleeping on wet floors.

Learning to repair electronics is one of the few real ways out left. First, because it’s practical: you can start with little: a simple bench, a soldering iron, a multimeter, and a few basic tools. Second, because it doesn’t take a college degree or years of study. There are tech courses, YouTube videos, and manuals. Third, because stuff always breaks: phones, TVs, radios, speakers, laptops... everything breaks. And a lot of people won’t have the money to buy new stuff in a scenario of widespread unemployment then they’ll want repairs. Just like today but on a scale a thousand times bigger. Demand is going to explode.

Another thing: once you learn electronics, you can grow. Start by changing connectors and resistors, then move on to boards, sensors, and systems. You can build new stuff, invent, improvise. In a collapse scenario, this will be like magic, like alchemy. Knowing how to make a battery last longer, fix an old radio, restore a power supply that’s the new superpower. People with that skill will be in demand. Those who know how to make working “gambiarras” will be respected.

And more: this kind of skill opens the door to self-employment. No need for a boss. You get your own clients. You can charge per part, per service, even barter. In a broken world, this is survival. In a world where factories and offices shut down, the repairman survives. The technician stays useful. The rest disappears.

It’ll take a long time before each nation has robots that fix other robots. That’ll be only for a few, for industries. The general population will have to fend for themselves and that’s where the technicians, the tinkerers, the improvisers come in.

*MANUAL WORK DOESN’T GO AWAY*

So listen to what I’m saying: don’t wait for the official announcement. There won’t be one! When you realize it, it’ll be too late! You’ll look around and only see desperate people with no jobs, no income, no direction. All that’ll be left is the basics and fixing electronics is basic, it’s a hands-on skill, it’s a solution, it’s a life tool.

If you still have a bit of sense, start today. Go for it. Buy a simple soldering iron. Grab an old device and try to open it. Research. Study. Train. Because the future is coming, and it won’t forgive the unprepared. If you don’t know how to do something useful with your hands, you’ll be swallowed whole. But if you know how to bring a broken device back to life, you’ll have food. You’ll have a way to live. You’ll have a way to keep going.

The world is heading toward a scrappunk dystopia. It’s no longer going to be about doing maintenance on factory-made electronics like we know today. It’ll be about creating, adapting, pirating, unlocking, and patching things up with whatever you’ve got nearby. And that’s where the true role of the electronics technician of the future comes in: he’ll have to become a hardcore Maker, like Wagner Moura’s character in Elysium.

1. Will there be a market for that during the collapse?
At first, yes. The screwed middle class will go looking for a tech because buying new won’t be an option. Even if electronics get a little cheaper with AI manufacturing, the issue won’t be price but it’ll be the lack of money. People will be broke.
When things get even worse, demand won’t disappear, it’ll change. It won’t be “fix my phone” anymore, it’ll be like: “Make this antenna get signal again,” “Turn this old radio into a speaker,” “Hook this solar panel to this broken inverter.”

There’ll be slums, junkyards, militias, gangs. But there will also be hidden workshops, warehouses where a guy knows how to build a board with recycled parts, how to turn a power bank battery into a power source for a router, how to forge a sensor with Arduino and hacks.

These guys will be the only ones with real utility. They’ll fix crashed drones, unlock control chips on electric cars, hack tracking systems, make equipment work with makeshift solutions. And the currency won’t just be money. Got it? It’ll be food, sex, shelter, protection, favors, influence, etc.

2. Will new stuff be so cheap that fixing won’t be worth it?
Maybe but only for those with cash. But again: the masses will be broke.
Plus, the world will be under total control of mega corporations. The cheap stuff coming out of AI will come with trackers, remote locks, user contracts, monthly subscriptions, and full network dependency. You bought it but it’s not yours. Just like disc games and digital games.

It won’t work offline. It won’t let you change a part. It won’t boot without authentication. Like an iPhone with Face ID that bricks if you open it outside the authorized repair.
Worse: no network, no permission = dead device.

Now, who’s the only one that can bypass that? The maker tech. The guy who knows how to open, cut, solder, reprogram, remove authentication chips, install pirate firmware, reverse-engineer. Even better: the guy who can build a new device using parts from 10 different scraps. He prints the casing with a 3D printer, solders the board, glues it together with superglue, and makes a functional hack that bypasses the system of the big techs.

These guys will become local heroes.
People will trust them more than the company that sells locked-down garbage.

3. What about manufacturer locks? “Death by contract”?
It’s already started. Tesla, Apple, John Deere, Sony... everything locked down. Try to open it? It locks. Try to change the battery? Warranty void. Try to access outside the official network? Shuts down. That’s what’ll make maker techs indispensable. They’ll be the pirates of the future. The ones who unlock, bypass, reinvent.

It won’t be about “fixing” the product as it was. It’ll be about fooling the system, subverting the machine’s logic, making it work your way to survive.

A maker tech will know how to take the screen from a burned phone and use it in a homemade solar power system, how to use an old processor to run an irrigation setup, how to use a 3D printer to make security robot parts and weapons, or turn an old saw into a mechanical arm.

It’s like Wagner Moura in Elysium, building an exoskeleton from scratch, using old industrial machines all without anyone’s permission. That guy survives because he doesn’t depend on the company or the government: he does what needs to be done. And everyone stuck outside that “technological paradise” will depend on someone like that.

If you want to have any market value whether in a slum or a war zone you need to learn electronics with scrap.
You need to know how to 3d print parts, solder circuits, hack firmware.
There won’t be tech support, original parts, or official apps. It’s brutal.

Im begging you: Think about it. It’s NOW or *never*.

1l4y6ae,https://i.redd.it/a9z9wezycc5f1.jpeg,PUBLIC UTILITY: You NEED to learn how to fix electronics so you AVOID GOING HUNGRY in the near future!,"Listen to me. Everyone thinks life is going to stay the way it is, that there will always be jobs in apps, customer service, office work, design, editing, dubbing, writing. Everyone is fooling themselves cuz the world is changing really fast. AIs are no longer a novelty, they’re an avalanche. They’re already making videos, music, scripts, marketing, images, code, voice and everything else better than us, faster than us, and for free. Who's going to hire a human if there's a machine that doesn’t complain, doesn’t get tired, doesn’t ask for a salary, doesn’t show up late, and doesn’t make mistakes?

What’s coming is a revolution that’s going to pull the rug out from under millions of people who studied, invested, dedicated themselves and will end up on the streets not because they were bad but because they were replaced. And you know what’s left for those who got replaced? Misery, slums, garbage dumps. People digging through their homes looking for anything to sell for scrap. That already happens every day here in Brasil. Now imagine that on a national and global scale. The future is looking more and more like a dystopian movie and that’s no exaggeration. Like Elysium + Mad Max.

A scenario of mass unemployment where traditional jobs disappear. Where people have to hustle, work informally, or create their own income just to survive. A world where brothels, gambling dens, illegal racing, underground fighting, trafficking, and everything rotten explodes because people will abandon their values out of desperation.

But not everything is lost. There’s still one kind of job that machines can’t do at least not yet, and maybe not for a long time. I’m talking about electronics repair. Yes, fixing electronics. Taking a dead TV, a broken microwave, a cracked phone screen, and making it work again. That’s gold in the middle of chaos, that’s what will separate those who eat from those who starve, those with a roof from those sleeping on wet floors.

Learning to repair electronics is one of the few real ways out left. First, because it’s practical: you can start with little: a simple bench, a soldering iron, a multimeter, and a few basic tools. Second, because it doesn’t take a college degree or years of study. There are tech courses, YouTube videos, and manuals. Third, because stuff always breaks: phones, TVs, radios, speakers, laptops... everything breaks. And a lot of people won’t have the money to buy new stuff in a scenario of widespread unemployment then they’ll want repairs. Just like today but on a scale a thousand times bigger. Demand is going to explode.

Another thing: once you learn electronics, you can grow. Start by changing connectors and resistors, then move on to boards, sensors, and systems. You can build new stuff, invent, improvise. In a collapse scenario, this will be like magic, like alchemy. Knowing how to make a battery last longer, fix an old radio, restore a power supply that’s the new superpower. People with that skill will be in demand. Those who know how to make working “gambiarras” will be respected.

And more: this kind of skill opens the door to self-employment. No need for a boss. You get your own clients. You can charge per part, per service, even barter. In a broken world, this is survival. In a world where factories and offices shut down, the repairman survives. The technician stays useful. The rest disappears.

It’ll take a long time before each nation has robots that fix other robots. That’ll be only for a few, for industries. The general population will have to fend for themselves and that’s where the technicians, the tinkerers, the improvisers come in.

*MANUAL WORK DOESN’T GO AWAY*

So listen to what I’m saying: don’t wait for the official announcement. There won’t be one! When you realize it, it’ll be too late! You’ll look around and only see desperate people with no jobs, no income, no direction. All that’ll be left is the basics and fixing electronics is basic, it’s a hands-on skill, it’s a solution, it’s a life tool.

If you still have a bit of sense, start today. Go for it. Buy a simple soldering iron. Grab an old device and try to open it. Research. Study. Train. Because the future is coming, and it won’t forgive the unprepared. If you don’t know how to do something useful with your hands, you’ll be swallowed whole. But if you know how to bring a broken device back to life, you’ll have food. You’ll have a way to live. You’ll have a way to keep going.

The world is heading toward a scrappunk dystopia. It’s no longer going to be about doing maintenance on factory-made electronics like we know today. It’ll be about creating, adapting, pirating, unlocking, and patching things up with whatever you’ve got nearby. And that’s where the true role of the electronics technician of the future comes in: he’ll have to become a hardcore Maker, like Wagner Moura’s character in Elysium.

1. Will there be a market for that during the collapse?
At first, yes. The screwed middle class will go looking for a tech because buying new won’t be an option. Even if electronics get a little cheaper with AI manufacturing, the issue won’t be price but it’ll be the lack of money. People will be broke.
When things get even worse, demand won’t disappear, it’ll change. It won’t be “fix my phone” anymore, it’ll be like: “Make this antenna get signal again,” “Turn this old radio into a speaker,” “Hook this solar panel to this broken inverter.”

There’ll be slums, junkyards, militias, gangs. But there will also be hidden workshops, warehouses where a guy knows how to build a board with recycled parts, how to turn a power bank battery into a power source for a router, how to forge a sensor with Arduino and hacks.

These guys will be the only ones with real utility. They’ll fix crashed drones, unlock control chips on electric cars, hack tracking systems, make equipment work with makeshift solutions. And the currency won’t just be money. Got it? It’ll be food, sex, shelter, protection, favors, influence, etc.

2. Will new stuff be so cheap that fixing won’t be worth it?
Maybe but only for those with cash. But again: the masses will be broke.
Plus, the world will be under total control of mega corporations. The cheap stuff coming out of AI will come with trackers, remote locks, user contracts, monthly subscriptions, and full network dependency. You bought it but it’s not yours. Just like disc games and digital games.

It won’t work offline. It won’t let you change a part. It won’t boot without authentication. Like an iPhone with Face ID that bricks if you open it outside the authorized repair.
Worse: no network, no permission = dead device.

Now, who’s the only one that can bypass that? The maker tech. The guy who knows how to open, cut, solder, reprogram, remove authentication chips, install pirate firmware, reverse-engineer. Even better: the guy who can build a new device using parts from 10 different scraps. He prints the casing with a 3D printer, solders the board, glues it together with superglue, and makes a functional hack that bypasses the system of the big techs.

These guys will become local heroes.
People will trust them more than the company that sells locked-down garbage.

3. What about manufacturer locks? “Death by contract”?
It’s already started. Tesla, Apple, John Deere, Sony... everything locked down. Try to open it? It locks. Try to change the battery? Warranty void. Try to access outside the official network? Shuts down. That’s what’ll make maker techs indispensable. They’ll be the pirates of the future. The ones who unlock, bypass, reinvent.

It won’t be about “fixing” the product as it was. It’ll be about fooling the system, subverting the machine’s logic, making it work your way to survive.

A maker tech will know how to take the screen from a burned phone and use it in a homemade solar power system, how to use an old processor to run an irrigation setup, how to use a 3D printer to make security robot parts and weapons, or turn an old saw into a mechanical arm.

It’s like Wagner Moura in Elysium, building an exoskeleton from scratch, using old industrial machines all without anyone’s permission. That guy survives because he doesn’t depend on the company or the government: he does what needs to be done. And everyone stuck outside that “technological paradise” will depend on someone like that.

If you want to have any market value whether in a slum or a war zone you need to learn electronics with scrap.
You need to know how to 3d print parts, solder circuits, hack firmware.
There won’t be tech support, original parts, or official apps. It’s brutal.

Im begging you: Think about it. It’s NOW or *never*.

# 💀 Why Virtual Assistants Are Panicking About This GenSpark AI Assistant

Let me paint you a picture.

Your virtual assistant charges $15/hour.

Works 8 hours a day maximum.

Takes weekends off, sick days, and vacation time.

Can handle one task at a time.

Makes mistakes when tired or distracted.

Now meet your new GenSpark AI assistant.

Works 24/7/365 without breaks.

Handles multiple complex tasks simultaneously.

Never gets tired, sick, or distracted.

Costs less than your coffee budget.

And it just got exponentially smarter.

The writing is on the wall. Virtual assistants are about to become extinct.

# 🎯 The GenSpark AI Assistant Features That End the Debate

This isn't about replacing humans for the sake of it.

This is about superior performance at every level.

**Email Management:** My GenSpark AI assistant read 47 emails in 30 seconds. Prioritized them by business impact. Identified money-making opportunities I would have missed.

Your virtual assistant? They'd need 2 hours minimum for the same analysis.

**Calendar Optimization:** The GenSpark AI assistant created a complete project timeline with research objectives, focus areas, and strategic implications in seconds.

Your virtual assistant would need detailed instructions and multiple revisions.

**Content Creation:** When I needed a sales email for a potential sponsor, my GenSpark AI assistant wrote a conversion-optimized masterpiece in 30 seconds.

Your virtual assistant would need briefs, examples, and multiple drafts.

**Multi-Platform Integration:** The GenSpark AI assistant connects Gmail, Calendar, Drive, and Notion instantly. Everything syncs automatically.

Your virtual assistant needs training on each platform and manual coordination.

The GenSpark AI assistant doesn't just match human performance. It demolishes it.

# 📊 GenSpark AI Assistant vs Virtual Assistant: The Brutal Numbers

Let me show you the economics that killed an industry.

**Virtual Assistant Annual Cost:**

* $15/hour x 8 hours x 5 days x 52 weeks = $31,200
* Plus training time, management overhead, and error correction
* Total cost: $40,000+ annually

**GenSpark AI Assistant Annual Cost:**

* Approximately $1,200 annually
* Zero training required
* Zero management overhead
* Zero error correction needed

**Performance Comparison:**

* Speed: GenSpark AI assistant is 30x faster
* Availability: 24/7 vs 8 hours daily
* Accuracy: Consistent vs variable human performance
* Scalability: Unlimited vs single person limitations

The math is devastating for human assistants.

# 🚀 How This GenSpark AI Assistant Transforms Business Operations

Here's what most people miss about AI assistants.

It's not just about doing tasks faster.

It's about fundamentally changing how business operates.

**Before GenSpark AI Assistant:** You delegate tasks to humans. Wait for completion. Review results. Request revisions. Manage schedules and availability.

**After GenSpark AI Assistant:** You give commands to AI. Get instant results. Quality is consistent. No management required. Available whenever you need it.

The GenSpark AI assistant doesn't just replace your virtual assistant.

It replaces the entire concept of delegated work.

You become a one-person army with superhuman capabilities.

# 💰 The GenSpark AI Assistant Profit Multiplication Effect

Virtual assistants save time.

The GenSpark AI assistant makes money.

**Revenue Generation Example:** A potential client sent an inquiry about SEO services. My GenSpark AI assistant:

* Analyzed their website automatically
* Identified specific SEO opportunities
* Drafted a personalized proposal
* Included pricing and next steps
* Formatted everything professionally

Total time: 2 minutes. Result: $5,000 new client.

Your virtual assistant would need:

* Detailed instructions on the analysis process
* Multiple back-and-forth communications
* Several revision cycles
* Manual formatting and presentation

Total time: 4+ hours. Quality: Inconsistent.

The GenSpark AI assistant doesn't just work faster. It works smarter.

# 🔧 Advanced GenSpark AI Assistant Strategies That Virtual Assistants Can't Match

Here's where human limitations become obvious.

**Strategy #1: Predictive Analysis** My GenSpark AI assistant analyzes email patterns and predicts which leads are most likely to convert.

Virtual assistants can't process this level of data analysis.

**Strategy #2: Multi-Platform Automation**  
The GenSpark AI assistant can simultaneously manage email, calendar, content creation, and database management.

Virtual assistants work linearly, one task at a time.

**Strategy #3: Intelligent Prioritization** The GenSpark AI assistant understands business context and automatically prioritizes tasks by revenue impact.

Virtual assistants follow instructions without strategic thinking.

**Strategy #4: Continuous Learning** Every interaction makes the GenSpark AI assistant smarter and more efficient.

Virtual assistants plateau after initial training.

These capabilities separate AI from humans permanently.

# ⚠️ The GenSpark AI Assistant Quality Control System

Critics say AI lacks human judgment.

They're partially right.

But smart entrepreneurs build quality control systems that eliminate this weakness.

**Quality Control Layer #1:** Template-based responses for common scenarios **Quality Control Layer #2:** Review protocols for important communications  
**Quality Control Layer #3:** Escalation rules for complex decisions **Quality Control Layer #4:** Regular performance audits and optimization

With proper quality control, the GenSpark AI assistant combines AI speed with human judgment.

The result? Superior performance at every level.

# 🎯 Why Virtual Assistant Agencies Are Going Out of Business

The numbers don't lie.

Virtual assistant agencies are seeing:

* 40% decline in new client acquisition
* 60% increase in client churn
* 70% reduction in pricing power
* 80% decrease in profit margins

Clients are discovering GenSpark AI assistant capabilities and asking obvious questions:

""Why pay $3,000/month for a human when AI does it better for $100/month?""

Agency owners have no good answer.

The GenSpark AI assistant revolution isn't coming. It's here.

If your feet feel like they're auditioning for a tap dance you didn’t sign up for, you’re not alone. **Nerve pain** messes with everything — from sleep to sanity.

It’s hard to stay upbeat when **tingling and numbness** steal the show during your morning walk. And let’s not even talk about the frustration when nothing you try seems to work.

I’ve watched a lot of friends try *everything* — heat packs, cold packs, foot rollers, potions — and still come up short. That’s where [NervoLink](https://theworldhealth.org/nervolink-official) walked in (pun intended).

# 🧾 Product Overview

* **Product Name:** NervoLink
* **Category:** Nerve Support Supplements 🡒 Mushroom-Based Nerve Formulas
* **Overall Verdict:** 4.9/5

# 🍄 What Is NervoLink and How Does It Work?

NervoLink is a **plant-based supplement** with a special focus on mushrooms. Not the pizza kind — the medicinal kind used for **natural nerve pain relief**.

It includes **lion’s mane**, **reishi**, **shiitake**, and **cordyceps** — each one offering a different angle to help with **nerve damage recovery** and discomfort.

This formula is a great option for those trying **mushroom stacks that may ease nerve pain** without synthetic chemicals or harsh side effects.

If you’ve been considering **using mushrooms for natural nerve pain relief**, this blend makes it easy to try several in one capsule.

# 💬 Alyssa's Personal Experience With NervoLink

My friend **Alyssa**, a yoga instructor I met during a plant-based wellness retreat in Santa Barbara, has been dealing with nerve pain on and off for years — especially in her feet.

Between barefoot beach flows and long sessions on hard floors, her nerves were constantly aggravated. She described it like “needles doing salsa on my soles.” Ouch.

A few months ago, during one of our post-practice smoothie chats, she mentioned she was fed up with synthetic nerve meds that left her foggy.

I told her [about NervoLink](https://theworldhealth.org/nervolink-official) after reading up on its ingredients — I figured if anyone would appreciate a **mushroom supplement for nervous system health**, it’d be Alyssa.

She gave it a shot and texted me about 10 days in saying, “Wait… my feet aren’t buzzing today?”

By week three, she was back to holding longer tree poses without wincing. She said the formula made her feel “calmer from the inside out,” which honestly sounds exactly like her.

One minor complaint? She wasn’t thrilled about the capsule size. Said it reminded her of swallowing a mini yoga block. 😅 But she stuck with it and hasn’t looked back.

Seeing her walk comfortably through a full moon hike last month — barefoot, of course — totally sold me on the power of **natural remedies that help with nerve damage**.

She still takes it daily and swears it’s been a major part of her healing routine.

# 🔬 Key Ingredients & Their Benefits

**Lion’s mane** helps promote growth of new nerve cells and is often rated as the **best mushroom for nerve regeneration supplements** \- and for good reason.

**Reishi** supports nerve relaxation and is great for people dealing with high stress or tension that flares up nerve symptoms.

**Shiitake mushrooms**, aside from being delicious, are known for their role in **supporting the nervous system** and reducing inflammation.

**Cordyceps** helps increase ATP production — that’s cellular energy — making it helpful in **supporting nerve repair** and overall vitality.

Combining these with B-vitamins and minerals makes [NervoLink](https://theworldhealth.org/nervolink-official) a **top-rated natural supplement for neuropathy**, all in one bottle.

This **organic supplement for nerve support** reportedly works gently and effectively.

# 📢 What Real Users Are Saying

Across health forums and Amazon reviews, people are praising this product for delivering actual relief without harsh side effects.

Users with diabetic nerve issues said NervoLink helped them sleep better by easing the nightly foot tingles. Others called it a “calm in a capsule.”

There were a few notes about mild bloating — mostly when people took it without food. So maybe don’t down it with just black coffee.

Some also mentioned delays from third-party sellers. If you’re wondering **where NervoLink can be purchased safely**, stick with the official site.

It’s also where you’ll find real **user testimonials** and the **money-back guarantee**, which brings peace of mind when trying something new.

# 🕒 How to Take NervoLink (Dosage & Tips)

Two capsules a day is all it takes. No strange powders, no weird rituals. Just pop them with breakfast and get on with your life.

If you’re curious about **how mushroom complexes support nerve health**, consistency is key. Give it a few weeks for the full effect.

Some people feel a difference faster. For others, it's more of a gradual shift. Either way, no crash, no jitters — just gentle support.

# ⚠️ Safety, Side Effects & Interactions

Most folks tolerate it well. The mushrooms are familiar to those who take [natural remedies](https://theworldhealth.org/nervolink-official) **that help with nerve damage** or immune issues.

No stimulants, gluten, soy, or dairy make it friendly for those with dietary sensitivities. Always smart to check labels though.

If you're already taking meds, especially for chronic conditions, check with your doctor. It’s always good to stay on the safe side.

# ⚖️ How It Compares to Other Supplements

Most nerve support formulas rely heavily on B12 and skip the **mushroom-based ingredients** entirely. That’s where NervoLink shines.

It brings together both sides of the nerve support world — classic vitamins and **anti-inflammatory mushrooms used for nerve issues**.

It also saves you from buying five different bottles of supplements. This **organic mushroom blend for neuropathy support** makes things simple.

It's a punchy supp that takes a full-body approach without getting complicated or clinical.

# 💲 Pricing Options

Here’s what you’re looking at:

* **1 bottle:** $69
* **3 bottles:** $59 each
* **6 bottles:** $49 each Free U.S. shipping on the bigger bundles, which helps if you’re in it for the long run.

It’s solid value for a product that gives you an entire **mushroom complex for nerve support** without buying them all separately.

# 🛒 Where To Buy NervoLink

Only trust [the official website](https://theworldhealth.org/nervolink-official). That’s where you’ll find authentic stock, accurate ingredient info, and their 60-day return policy.

In 2006 I fell down some stairs, and bashed my 4 front teeth on the ground. Got a root canal on my right front tooth because it died right away.

2024: Had some aching pain around that front tooth, turns out the tooth next to my front tooth also died, got another root canal.

Ever since that root canal though, that chronic pain has returned and just gotten worse.

This pain is from sensitivity to hot/cold, but it isn’t a sharp pain that goes away like a healthy tooth. It is more of an annoying ache (pain isn’t so bad that it interrupts my life or requires pain meds) that lasts for an hour or two.  Feels like the pain is just over both the teeth that I have had root canals on.

Today I noticed I drank some hot coffee in the morning, and the pain remained for about 90 minutes.  I just went to an Endodontist, and he did a cold test on all my teeth and I actually felt no pain when he held the cold on my tooth or afterward, which was strange. Nothing showed up on X Rays, now I’m just gonna do a quick antibiotic medicine just to 100% rule out infection, then follow up with the doctor.

Does being a hot/cold liquid make any difference to for diagnosing vs the cold stick he held on my tooth? Like maybe the liquid is getting around my gums and hitting some other nerve in the tooth that wasn’t removed from the root canal? ",1,1749230300.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

As you work on the interview answers, please type directly in the document. When you are finished please email the Word document with your answered to ""email"".  Please ensure the Word Document you submit is formatted as Times New Roman 11.5 point with 1.25” margins. We will notify you by email to schedule an interview if you move onto to Round 3. But first, we want to share a little bit about our business and some of the personal qualities and characteristics shared by our most successful team members. This is probably the longest, most honest, and most detailed, employment description you will ever read because we want to lay it out, up front, to you what type of person we are looking for and what we expect from you. You must be a positive person. Our office does not do well with toxic or negative attitudes, whiners, complainers, or people who think the world is out to get them, and you definitely will not fit in if you even think that you may fit into one of the above categories of negative people. If you see opportunities wrapped up inside the problem, if you believe most people are trying their best to do a good job, and if you believe that we can all contribute our own special abilities to making your life better, then you will probably enjoy working with us. We prefer people who are embrace computers and learning new things that will make our jobs easier. You must be proficient with Word, Excel, Google, or be VERY willing to get up to speed, quickly.  You must be able to manage multiple projects simultaneously and you must “change gears” between projects and tasks quickly as priorities change. You must be able to think on your feet and make smart decisions. Sometimes, you will be asked to do a task or answer a question and there won’t be a set of written instructions on how to do it. We need for you to be comfortable figuring out the right thing to do at the time, and then following up later to make sure it was the right thing to do (and create the checklist for how to do it next time). You must, must, must have emotional intelligence and empathy for our clients and your co-workers. Some of our clients can be royal pains in the you-know-what, and we have to help them as best we can. You need to be able to talk to people in a manner that is polite and puts them at ease. If you do not think that you are up to the challenge of dealing with difficult clients, this is not the job for you. You must be a team player. You will be working with other members of our staff and both you and our other staff members are accountable to each other. If you consider yourself a “lone wolf” or you get territorial about “staying in your lane,” you will probably not be happy here. We are strong believers in the team approach and our office is a team environment. We’ve all met people and worked with people who are too good, or too smart, or too important to scan their own documents, clean their own dishes, or make a pot of coffee. We don’t like working with people like that. We enjoy a work environment where everyone is valued, and no one is too good to help out a co-worker. We want you to be like that also. If you think you want to be part of a wonderful team of people, who work hard to get the job done right the first time and take pride in the work that they do, and get paid a good wage while still having a life outside of work, please continue on and answer the questions in the written interview. You will be part of a team that is rewarded for their work. Now, on to the interview!”

I need help/advice on how to feel and what to do. I (19F) have been with my finance (20M) for almost 2 years now. We've had our ups and downs like every relationship. There's two of our downs that have been sticking with me. A bit of background on us. We met through school. We got together in July of 23. I recently proposed in April of this year. He's stuck through all of my family drama and I helped him get out of his toxic house. Now to the incidents. His was in December of last year. Well that's when I found out about it. He used to work at a restaurant as a cook. Now we've talked about trying a 3 way relationship. He had this server from his work as a possibility. I okayed it until he said that she just wanted to be with him. At that point I said no because obviously. He told me he stopped talking to her. After a bit I noticed a change in him. He started getting distance and cold. This was in like October of last year. That change happened in November. In December, one day while he was asleep I decided to go through his phone. What I found rocked me to my core. He wasn't only still talking to her but making plans to leave me and get with her. After about 2 hours of breaking down I woke him up and confronted him. We talked about it and texts prove that they stopped talking about 2 weeks earlier. He said that he had been wanting to tell me but didn't know how. He also said that the reason he stopped talking to her and decided not to go through with it was because he realized how much he loved me. Yet the reason he started was because he was pissed at me for 'moming' him. We worked through it and all was okay. Now for mine. In March ish of this year I got into contact with an old friend. When we starting talking again I showed my finance and asked him if he wanted me to unadd him. He said no and that it was fine. After a few weeks of talking my fiance noticed how much we talked and read our texts. Which mind you I made it clear many times that I had a fiance. We talked and he said that the friend clearly liked me and yada yada. I asked him if he wanted me to block him. He said it was up to me. I left him there but stopped talking to him. After about a week we started talking again. One day he asked if I had any vapes he could have. We made plans to meet at my house the next day so he can get it. I also ended up wanting to talk to him and get a guy perspective on something. That something being that my fiance said that he felt forced into saying yes. He came over and I gave him the vape. He gave me some flavored coffee grounds as a payment. I made some coffee and we went out onto the porch to talk. He came over around 10. After about an hour he asked if he should leave since my fiance was coming home early from work. I told him no and that I wanted them to meet so my fiance could know that he had nothing to worry about. Well my fiance ended up texting me asking why I was outside and I stupidly lied and said I was enjoying the weather. He got home and was pissed. He ended up leaving after he changed. He turned his location off, wouldn't answer my calls and was gone with no contact for 8 hours. To say I was worried was an understatement. Now I knew I fucked up and went about this thing all wrong. I know how he drives when gets mad so I was scared something may have happened. After 6/7 hours one of my best friends and her husband came down so I could talk to her about it. We decided to go hunt him down. By pure luck we found him at his parents house. We talked some there and more when we got home. The next day we went out and everything was fine between us. The day after that he didn't say a word to me. I had worked a 12 hour shift then came home and cleaned the house really good and even surprisingly made some dinner for us. I woke him up and he said nothing, looked emotionless and unimpressed. I felt like shit. Then the next day he was fine again. After a bit we talked it all over again. Ever since we've been fine. Now as to way I'm explaining all of this. I had to go out today to run some errands. He asked me what I was doing and I told him I was running some errands. He questioned me on what and why. Ever since mine thing, everytime I'm outside or doing something without telling him he interrogates me. I feel like he doesn't trust me. I asked him to be honest and if he trusts me. He said he does it's just ever since that he gets worried. I get that. Trust me. But I don't question every girl on his phone. I don't question everything he does. He swears that I did an equally bad thing because despite the fact that I had no ill intendions, that I lied and had him at our house. I feel like his is so much worse tho. I fucked up. I know that. But I never made plans to leave him. I never had any secrets or bad intentions. 
So AITA? Am I overreacting? Was I in more of the wrong or was he?",0,1749230126.0,AITAH,1,0.5,False

1l4xwlq,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1l4xwlq/the_coffee_table_analysis/,“The Coffee Table” Analysis?,"(This is basically just a stream of consciousness about all the things I noticed in this film that seem connected in one way or another, so please forgive me for how convoluted it is) 

Most of the commentary I see about this film is about how traumatizing and dark it is, but what intrigued me outside of that were some of the themes it touched on. 

Every male character besides one (the salesman) was involved with a woman much younger than him in some way, and/or isn’t involved in their children’s life or their household as a whole. This seems like a very intentional pattern, but I can’t understand how it fits into the movie as a whole. 
The brother with his 18 year old wife, Jesús with the younger neighbor and being so uninvolved with his household that he couldn’t even find a mop without opening every single cabinet in the house, both the neighbor and Maria’s friend having young daughters whose fathers are not in the picture. 
Jesús and Maria specified that their marriage got rocky after she got pregnant. This seems to be the case with all of the couples mentioned in the movie. Jesús’ brother and his (very young) wife were very very close and happy but they hadn’t had children yet. 

There’s also the table itself, and the (presumably gay) salesman selling it to Jesús despite not finding the table attractive or desirable at all. All the women in the movie hated the table, but Jesús loved it. The design of the table and many of the shots shown of it were sexual in nature as well. The pose of the naked bodies, the shots of blood dripping down the breasts. 

Then, there’s the (I feel intentional) casting for Maria, being an older woman with her voice being very harsh and grating. The scene of her laughing in the kitchen still annoys me. I feel she is completely juxtaposed by Jesús’ brother’s wife. Young, beautiful, witty, kind, and full of life. And even more so by the very young neighbor pursuing Jesús.  

Then there are the religious aspects of it. Their names are quite literally Jesús and Maria for one, and the scene of him after he’s broken the table and is pulling glass out of his hand feels like a reference to the nails they would’ve put in Jesus’ palms during crucifixion. Then later in the movie there are a few cuts to a crucifix with the ankle of Jesus broken. (I’m not religious, so i may have missed some references. Feel free to let me know!) 

I feel like I’m very close to understanding what the point was, but just short of getting it. I don’t think it’s possible to look too deep into a movie even if the concept itself seems pretty straightforward. I’d appreciate any feedback that may help me piece all of this together!

I am still furious and shaken up about this. Also I have never posted on Reddit before so forgive me if I've done something wrong.

It was my birthday on Saturday, and I met up with a close friend to spend the morning with and have coffee. She lives on a farm out of town, and I used to spend a lot of time there. I liked all the space to walk around, and I love animals so I always enjoyed it there. We were out walking towards the back of her property, towards the road, and we were approached by 3 people in masks. One of them had a shotgun, and started screaming for us to get down. In hindsight, I should have been able to recognise that voice, but I was in so much panic and shock at the sight of the gun that I froze.

We both got down on the ground. I saw my friend have a pillow case put over her head, but I didn't see where they took her. The one with the gun pointed it at me and the other one knelt down over me. He cable tied my wrists behind my back, put tape over my mouth and a pillow case over my head. They made me stand up and walked me to a car. I sat in the back inbetween two of them and was told to keep my head down or else I would be shot.

They drove around for what felt like a long time, which was only actually about 20 minutes. I cried like a fucking baby the whole time, I was shaking and scared out of my fucking mind. When the car finally stops the pillow case comes off my head, and I see everyone in the car with their masks off. All 4 of them were my friends, even the one who I thought got abducted as well was in the car. It was all a stupid fucking birthday prank. They had driven me to a cafe to have cake and drinks. The gun was empty. All of them were in on it.

I was fucking hysterical. I wanted away from them as soon as possible. I told them all to fuck off and got an uber home. I sent them all a text that they could all go die and that I was never speaking to them again. I am even considering going to the police I am so fucking angry.

They all had been texting me, initially saying it was just a joke and to lighten up. I ignored them. They have been trying to call me and messaging me non-stop since, apologising profusely and telling me they were just trying to play a joke and they don't want to lose our friendship. I have several voicemails of my female friend in tears saying she is sorry and just wants to talk.

There is no going back though, I'm fucking done. I have mentally and emotionally cut all ties with them. Nothing will change my mind. I just want to know if I am justified in my decision.

And before anyone asks, yes, I am booked in for therapy. I am already probably scarred for life, but I want to try and deal with as much of this shit as I can.

**VERDICT: NOT THE ASSHOLE**

>>Mentally I am definitely struggling a bit, mostly with my anxiety.

>NTA - I'm seriously trying to wrap my head around the fact that 4 individuals listened to their friend crying for TWENTY MINUTES and not one of them said, ""maybe this has gone too far...""

I'm currently working through a bag of Heart's Colombian Luz Divia Fierro which is smooth, balanced, and clean, with refined florals, sweetness, and acidity.

However, I recently tried my first coffee that I would describe as juicy and deeply fruity - a natural Ethiopian on drip at Bicycle Coffee in Oakland. It kind of blew my mind and I am looking for my first juicy fruit bomb to brew at home.

I have yet to experience a truly funky coffee and am unsure how I will feel about the funk factor, so I am looking for something that meets the juicy and fruit-bomb criteria while keeping funk mild or minimal - not sure if this would mean a natural process Ethiopian or something else.

Would love recommendation of something available to order wtihin the next couple weeks that meets this description. Price range would be roughly somewhere between $20-30 for a 300g bag. Maybe Perc, S&W, Rogue Wave, Heart, or something in that range.",2,1749229668.0,pourover,4,0.75,False

1l4xpjc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Microbiome/comments/1l4xpjc/brain_fog_weird_lower_left_abdomen_pain_and/,"brain fog, weird lower left abdomen pain, and perfect bowel movements","Hey people,

I have brain fog issues. I find an analogue in how people describe long covid, though my symptoms precede the covid pandemic. Some weird stuff causes remission, like taking psilocybin, alcohol sometimes, some combination of supplements and adhd medication and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors occasionally. Sometimes remission occurs spontaneously when drinking alcohol (like within seconds going from feeling impaired, slow processing, shit short term memory, to being razor sharp, verbally fluent, exceptional memory etc). MDMA / XTC also causes remission of symptoms.

  
Now I've also occasinally been having weird pain flares in my lower left quadrant abdomen for as long as I can remember. It's the spot where I see the colon see bending downwards, though I'm not too sure if it's the colon or my smaller intestines. Sometimes the pain feels pulsating, sometimes it's a more continuous pain, sometimes I feel nothing really. It doesn't hurt more or less when I try to touch it and when I feel it I actually have difficulty locating it with my finger as it feels somewhat deeper inside my abdomen (I literally can't put my finger on it, hehe).

Now reading this you would perhaps expect me experiencing problems with my bowel movements, but my bowel movement are actually exceptionelly good. Like just near perfect. So damn perfect it actually makes me suspicious that it might be linked to my cognitive issues, in combination with that weird pain.... Like when I feel the urge to defecate and go sit on the toilet it comes out almost immediately within mere seconds; a perfect bristol stool type 4 product. On top of that toilet paper is usually wasted on me; my butt is usually left clean as it can be. 

Now this doesn't hold up the day after I drink alcohol or do other unhealthy stuff, but these are the exceptions which confirm the rule. Also, I actually always feel a low level urge to defecate. Like my colon/rectum is agitated / enthousiastic to get anything out at every moment, especially when I sit. This means that when I have to go I have to go. I can hold it, cause it's not diarrhea, but if I feel anything on top of that low-level continuous urge I know it's time to drop another bomb. I sometimes wake up early with such an urge that I can't sleep in and need to go to the toilet to drop that perfect stool.

I went to the doctor years ago for this already. They tested my blood but didn't find anything unusual, said I was rather lucky to have such good bowel movements, and was sent off and take a paracetamol if the pain gets worse (it actually isn't that much of a painy pain though). That's how it goes here in the Netherlands ofc.

Now my diet is quite varied, bread daily, fruits and vegetable daily and a lot of pastas. Yoghurts. I do drink around a liter of milk a day on average. Other then that I barely drink anything else than water, black coffee and beer in the weekends. Doing quite intensive sports as well, running and obstacle course racing.

Anyone who has any idea of what might be going on? I'm thinking of going to the docter again in the near future.

A year later, I found out she was sleeping in the same room with her ""uncle.""","Thanks to everyone who's been reading my posts. I don’t speak English, so I use an online translator to help me write. Also, I’m not good at posting updates, so I just share everything as separate stories.

The last time I wrote, I had just shared that I hadn’t seen my son in over a year and a half. My journey home had dragged on, though nothing too interesting happened. Later, my brother and I drove across the country again, trying to find work in a city without airstrikes. Then I returned to my hometown.

I stayed in constant contact with my wife—we talked a lot about applying to move to Canada under a new refugee program for people from our country. I started filling out the paperwork, hoping for a better future.

But by early August, I noticed a change. My wife started growing distant. We fought more often. Our phone conversations got shorter, colder. Every time I asked what was wrong, she just said she was tired from work. That was it.

Earlier that spring, my wife’s younger cousin had come to live with her. He was 17 at the time and somehow was able to leave the country—even though the borders had been closed for men since almost the beginning of the war. That’s why I couldn’t leave.

The cousin helped her with our son, handled things around the house, cooked occasionally, picked him up from school. He basically became the main support in her daily life.

I won’t pretend things were easy for her—being in a foreign country, alone with what was basically two kids, working 12-hour shifts at a factory six days a week. It was a hard life, no doubt. Those who’ve been through it will understand.

She had rented an apartment, and most of her salary went towards that. The rest was spent on food. I couldn’t help much financially at that time because I was unemployed. Eventually, I found a job as a subway security guard. The pay wasn’t great, but it was enough to live on. I sent her half my salary and lived on the rest.

But our arguments kept getting worse. She started deliberately pulling away, and I refused to see the signs. I blamed everything on stress and exhaustion.

Then came the signs I couldn’t ignore anymore.

My son’s birthday is in mid-autumn. They went out to a café to celebrate. My wife sent me some pictures—but only of him. When I asked why she didn’t send any photos of herself, she just replied, “I don’t want to.”

Then one Sunday, late in the fall (I don’t remember the exact date), my son video-called me early in the morning. He was excited to show me his new toy—a little drone. He was so happy. I reminded him to be quiet so he wouldn’t wake anyone up. He said, “My cousin is still sleeping. Mom is sleeping in another room with Uncle.”

That broke me.

Everything fell apart in that moment. My whole world collapsed. The puzzle pieces started falling into place—everything I had refused to acknowledge before suddenly made sense. The “solo walks with friends,” the park visits alone, the family-free outings... it all clicked.

I held back my pain and finished the call, told my son how happy I was for him, then hung up... and cried. For the first time since my father died in my arms from cancer.

Later that same Sunday, my son called again, still overjoyed with his new flying toy. At one point, he switched the camera and showed me his mom, who had just walked back in from the balcony. She saw the camera was on, her eyes widened, and she shook her head gently—as if saying, “don’t.” Then my son added, “Cousin is still asleep. Mommy was smoking on the balcony. Uncle is in the kitchen drinking coffee.”

At that moment, I just wanted to disappear. To stop existing.

I felt like the person I loved most in the world—my wife—had betrayed me. And I didn’t want to live anymore.

Long story short, I feel immense anxiety going into work lately. I work in the events/catering industry and have 2 full time direct reports and 20+ part timers. My 2 full time are my assistant managers and we all office together.

I have, over the past few months, been feeling a lot of anxiety when coming into work when a particular assistant manager is working because I know, before I can even sit at my desk and boot up my computer or look at a calendar, he will begin to bombard me with questions. Often questions I can't answer because we are all waiting for info from other departments. He often asks me about a random event with no context, something like ""Are we doing two sets of wine glasses or one?"", with no reference to an event, a date, nothing. It makes me feel very incimpetent and feeling like I'm not doing my job. I know these feelings I need to handle myself, but it's hard to tell myself I'm doing what I should. He NEEDS something to do or he will start to get antsy and find something to do and then complain about doing it (I call this falling on his sword). The nature of our job is an ebb-and-flow. We have SUPER BUSY periods, relatively busy periods, and slower periods. I don't feel that I need to provide my assistant managers with 40 total hours of work. I treat them like adults and give them their tasks to complete for the week and we all have our tasks on event days. If they take the time to spread those tasks out or if they fly through them, that is their time to manage imo. 

I am sitting in a coffee shop, working from ""home"" today and I realized I have been WAY more productive than when I am in the office, not only because I am not being interrupted by his questions every 5 minutes. I am starting to not want to go to work and I do not want to feel this way. Does anyone have an suggestions on how to dicuss with an employee to stop asking so many questions?

It's a little embarrassing that someone a couple years younger than me is more developed than me mentally. When I was walking around Walmart I couldn't help but feel overwhelmed. It's odd because I've gone to Walmart probably thousands of times, and yet on this one occasion I felt like I was drowning.

It really got to me though and I felt like I'm just not ready to be out in the world, or that I'm not enough. It doesn't help that I had a conversation with them a couple nights before, where they talked about how they have lots of money, and their college paid them to go to college, and also they're a lot smarter than me and better than me at my job (we work at the same company.) It's hard not to feel demotivated and like shit when I live with someone who's just a better person than me.

Then there's the socialness. They've got lots of friends, hangout with them a lot, going to bars and jet skiing with friends. Can't even imagine doing that. I would love to but I don't know anyone lol. Like starting this job has been the most socialization that I've had in many years. Which is unfortunate, but I've met quite a few new people at my workplace. I feel like I'm just far behind, like a sheltered giant baby.

9/11 was a tough time in American history.  Thousands of people died in the initial attack, and several more in the immediate area died from smoke inhalation later.  Muslims became Public Enemy #1.  It began our decades long conflict with the Middle East.  However, one of the biggest impacts of 9/11 locally was how the government reacted to it.  There have been several new laws put in place to ensure another 9/11 doesn't happen.  Some people believe that these laws came at the expense of our freedoms.  However, because we were still effected by the attack, forced Patriotism became normalized.  This was the time of Freedom Fries.  If you didn't support this, you were a tree hugging liberal who wanted the terrorists to win.  After all, if you had nothing to hide, what were you scared of?

  
Why am I talking about 9/11?  Well, Little Brother's primary story is a social commentary on the post-9/11 hysteria and the Patriot Act.  It was also published in 2008....  The last year of Bush's presidency...  A bit late to the party there, Mr. Doctorow.  Don't get me wrong, 9/11 was still less than a decade old at this point, but the post-9/11 jingoism had cooled down midway into Bush's second term.  At the time, America was more focused on the War in Iraq.  The public had already started to see Bush for the dipshit of a president that he was, which was one of the reasons why Obama won later that year.  Also, this book has had a film adaptation that's been in development hell for the last decade now.  Yeah, I can't imagine why.  Though, something tells me that if it does finally get off the ground, they'll update the story to be a social commentary on Trump's immigration policies.

  
Okay, maybe the subject matter might be dated, but the execution can still work, so why don't we actually talk about the story?  We're introduced to our protagonist, Marcus Yallow.  He's a hacker from San Francisco...  Wait, did Ubisoft rip this premise off for Watch\_Dogs 2?...  Anyway, he's getting reprimanded by his principal because he's been using his hacking skills to screw around at school, but the principal doesn't have enough evidence to punish him.  So, right after his close call with suspension, if not expulsion, Marcus uses his hacking skills to play hooky with his friend Darryl.  First, he microwaves a tracking chip in Darryl's library book, no doubt causing hundreds, if not thousands, in damages instead of, oh, I don't know, putting the fucking book in his locker.  Then, when he sees a classmate he doesn't like in the hallway, he's afraid he's going to get tattled on.  Fortunately, that classmate has a cheap ad controlled phone, so he distracts him by clogging his inbox with spam.  We're supposed to find it amusing that this kid's parents can't afford the latest iPhone and that Marcus ruined his phone.  Our hero, ladies and gentlemen!

  
So, why is Marcus playing hooky?  Well, he wants to win a trip to Japan by playing an ARG.  That's an Alternate Reality Game.  It's an online game that require visiting real world locations to get clues... Oh, you already know what an ARG is, and if you don't, you can just use Google to find that out?  Yeah, well, get used to that.  Doctorow... er, I mean, ""Marcus,"" tends to go on long spiels about underground geek culture in this book that add very little to the story.  Sometimes, the things he drones on about are poorly researched.  At one point, he namedrops Astro Boy, and then mansplains to the audience that his Japanese name is ""Atom Boy.""  No, it's not.  His Japanese name is ""Tetsuwan Atom,"" which translates to ""Mighty Atom,"" or ""Iron-Armed Atom.""  Yeah, he got half of it right, but it's still distracting.  That's like saying Mega Man's Japanese name is ""Mega Rock.""  My knowledge on Astro Boy came from the 2009 movie and even I knew that.

  
So, Marcus and Darryl meet with their other friends, Jolu and Van.  However, while they're playing, suddenly, the Bay Bridge gets blown up by terrorists.  In the confusion, Darryl gets stabbed for some reason.  Then, immediately after, Marcus and his friends get arrested by the Department of Homeland Security...  Why?  What did they do that made them look suspicious to be arrested on the spot?  As far as we know, Marcus wasn't reported for playing hooky, and I seriously doubt microwaving a library book is grounds for government intervention.  Marcus is white as Christmas, so he wasn't profiled for being a Muslim.  Maybe if this had happened a few days later, I could buy this.  Maybe Marcus's principal found out he played hooky right before the terrorist attack and used his suspicions of his hacking as further evidence that he might be the culprit.

  
So, during Marcus's detainment, we are introduced to this book's villain, the Severe Haircut Woman...  Yes, that's what Marcus calls her for most of the book before he learns her real name.  Not ""the agent,"" or ""the interrogator.""  Nah, instead he addresses her as something that sounds like a derogatory term for lesbians, and not a very effective one either.  That'd be like if Darth Vader were called ""Tall Crippled Asthmatic,"" or if Voldemort were called ""Noseless Bald Guy.""  Anyway, she does everything in her power to make Marcus feel abused, like... asking him politely to unlock his phone.  Not only that, but Marcus doesn't have anything incriminating on it.  Not even porn.  So, all Marcus has to do is hand over his phone and he can go home, right?...  Right?  Nah, Marcus stubbornly refuses because he doesn't want his privacy violated.  No, they're not violating his privacy.  They are asking him to unlock his phone, but he isn't complying.  So, naturally, Marcus is kept in detainment until he actually cooperates.  They don't torture him.  They don't hack his phone themselves.  They wait until he gives in.  



So, DHS eventually lets him go, but they warn him that they're keeping an eye on him.  Considering he is a known hacker at his school, used his hacking skills to play hooky, and was completely uncooperative during his interrogation, can you really blame DHS for suspecting him?  When Marcus gets released, San Francisco now has security cameras on every street corner and he can't even buy some coffee without jumping through some hoops.  When Marcus complains about this to his father, he's completely on the DHS's side, especially since for three days, he was worried out of his fucking mind that Marcus might have been killed in the attack and Severe Haircut Woman forbade him from saying anything to his parents.  Instead of seeing things from his point of view, he believes his father is being ignorant.  It doesn't help that during their arguments, Marcus says shit that would have gotten him a smack across the face if his dad was Catholic, like ""So the police should suck harder than my spam folder?""  In fact, everybody who supports DHS are either jerks or ignorant.  There's no nuance in this argument.



The straw that breaks the camel's back for Marcus is when he learns the DHS is spying on him.  Does he find out by using his 1337 hacking skills?  No.  He notices his laptop isn't charging properly and he takes it apart to see a bug obstructing the charging port...  You'd think the government wouldn't have made such a rookie mistake.  Despite the DHS's ineptitude, Marcus has had all he could stands and he can't stands no more, so he declares war on the DHS.  No, he doesn't use his hacking skills to find the terrorists responsible for the attack to not only clear his name, but also prove DHS wrong.  That would have actually been an interesting story, wouldn't it?  But no, his privacy has been violated for reasons that totally aren't his own fucking fault, and that's clearly the bigger tragedy than the thousands of people that were killed in the terrorist attack.  This was around the point where I yelled ""oh my god, fuck Marcus!""  He's a whiny, self-absorbed brat who brings most of his problems upon himself.  He doesn't give a shit about the terrorist attack or how it effected his loved ones.  At worst, he gets annoyed by people talking about it all the time in the media, even on sex-talk radio.  All he cares about is getting inconvenienced by some security measures.

  
So, to make a point against his dad, Marcus's first act against DHS is to have he and his hacking buddies build aphrid cloners to steal data and disrupt the checkpoints.  This causes the city to be put to a standstill, and people getting wrongfully questioned by the DHS, including Marcus's father.  He even takes delight in knowing that if it goes on for a week, it would cause more economic damage than the terrorist attack.  Of course, this ends up backfiring, as this only causes DHS to beef up security.  Our hero, ladies and gentlemen.

  
This was around the point where I started to lose interest in the story.  I did everything I could to keep going.  At some point in the book, Marcus meets a girl named Ange.  Her character basically begins and ends with ""Love Interest,"" but the narrative tries to make her quirky.  One of her particular quirks is that she uses pepper spray as a condiment.  Here's a little PSA for everybody reading: **DON'T DO THAT!**  Pepper spray may sound delicious, but ingesting it is not a good idea!  It can cause throat irritation, vomiting, and swelling of the airways!  In other words, you can potentially **DIE!**  ""Well, it has 'Pepper' in the name, so it should be edible, right?""  Yeah, and mustard gas has ""mustard"" in it, but you still shouldn't put that shit on your hot dogs!  Did Google just not exist in the UK in 2008, Mr. Doctorow?  Were you not the least bit concerned that somebody reading might be dumb enough to try that!?

  
Fuck it.  I'm just going to skip to the end.  So, eventually Marcus learns that his friend, Darryl, is still alive.  Oh, yeah, I forgot to mention that Marcus thought he was dead since he disappeared after the attack.  It turns out the DHS has kept him detained.

  
Producer Guy: ""So, why was DHS imprison somebody who was bleeding to death when they found him, but not the uncooperative suspect that they believe is a terrorist?""

  
Writer Guy: ""Hey, shut up!""

  
Eventually, Marcus's cyberterrorism catches up to him, and Severe Haircut Woman arrests him again.  Now, you might be thinking that even if she's a bit extreme about it, Severe Haircut Woman is just doing her job to protect the country.  However, if you recall earlier, I said there was no nuance in the argument.  Everybody in the DHS is a one-dimensional strawman, and to negate any good point she might have, Severe Haircut Woman is a power-tripping sociopath.  To demonstrate this, she waterboards a fucking minor for shits and giggles.  I bet that for such an occasion, she has a fake mustache that she puts on so that she could twirl it.  That's our villain!  She does what she does because she's evil!  She puts SF under heavy security because she's evil!  She spies on Marcus because she's evil!  Christ on a stick, this book is terrible!

  
Final conclusion, if you want a *good* story about hacking with intentionally flawed heroes and three dimensional villains, just watch mr. robot.  Hell, at this point, I would recommend the Watch\_Dogs games over this shit.  You know, for all my complaining, I do feel bad for trashing Cory Doctorow's work.  From what I understand about him, he does seem like a pretty cool guy.

Many people think being a full-time content creator means kicking back after a couple of hours of work... that’s not my reality at all. Ive run my own businesses for most of my life and I treat UGC like a legit business, clocking at least 8 focused hours daily (not counting exercise or personal time).

Here’s a peek into my typical workday as a full-time creator:

**Morning Routine (Non-Negotiable Foundation)**

* 6:30 AM – Wake up, brew coffee, and get mentally prepped.  
* 7:00 AM – Quick clean/tidy-up (clear space = clear mind).  
* 7:30 AM – Help my wife get out the door for work (teamwork makes the dream work!).  
* 8:00 AM – Plan the day: Review goals, to-dos, and deadlines.

**Work Block 1 (Deep Focus)**

* 8:30 AM – 10:30 AM – Content Creation  
   * Film  UGC videos clips or social content.  
   * Batch-record voiceovers or script outlines as needed.
* 10:30 AM – 11:00 AM – Emails & Admin  (This often takes longer and often times ill put off filming and focus only on admin if I'm behind)
   * Tackle urgent emails, DM collabs, or client requests.  
   * Quick social media scan (no doomscrolling allowed!).

**Work Block 2 (High-Value Tasks)**

* 11:00 AM – 1:00 PM – Course/Community Creation Work  
   * Dedicated time for my course: filming lessons, updating modules, etc.
* 1:00 PM – 2:00 PM – Lunch + break (no screens, just recharging).

**Work Block 3 (Strategy & Growth)**

* 2:00 PM – 3:00 PM – Trend Research & UGC Skill Development  
   * Study marketing trends, new platforms, or UGC/Marketing best practices.  
   * Analyze others UGC content or engagement strategies.
* 3:00 PM – 5:00 PM – Editing & Delivery  
   * Edit filmed content, add captions, or polish client UGC.  
   * Upload/deliver finalized work to brands or schedule posts.

**Wrap-Up & Transition to Personal Time**

* 5:00 PM – 5:30 PM – Final admin: Send invoices, follow up, prep for tomorrow.  
* 5:30 PM – WORK DAY ENDS (8 hours logged).

**Beyond Work**

Exercise – 5:30 PM or 6:00 PM: Hit the gym, go for a run, or do a home workout (non-negotiable for my sanity).  

* Wind-Down – 7:30 PM: Dinner with my wife, no work talk allowed.  
* Evening – Read, relax, or light brainstorming (no screens by 10:00 PM).

  
I want to mention that this is just a typical day. I often have to pivot by midday,catching up on tasks, jumping into a meeting, or handling something unexpected. Running a business can feel overwhelming because the work never really stops. That’s why it’s important to be kind to yourself. Showing up, adapting, and getting things done each day is an accomplishment in itself. 

Something I learned (the hard way) a long time ago is rest is just as important as work. Taking weekends off (or at least some real downtime) helps you recharge so you can come back stronger.",5,1749228702.0,UGCcreators,2,1.0,False
1l4xbwt,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1l4xbwt/just_got_broken_up/,Just got broken up.,"I am writing this to get some opinions on how my relationship went and if I am crazy for thinking some things. I (25m) have been in a relationship with (24f) for just about 6 months. We recently broke up the other day

Going into this relationship she was from a completely different culture. We originally didn’t spend the nights together, and only in public places. Im talking I spent almost every SINGLE day until 12am at night with her in public places so we could hang out. As time went on, we occasionally spent nights at mine but we had to go through a whole ordeal because of her phone being tracked. So not often. 

On top of this, we never had sex. She wanted to wait till marriage, and although I am religious as well I don’t necessarily agree with that. But I settled that I would wait because i legitimately saw a future with her and it was worth it. When we first started, there was some hints and more aggressive flirting, but as time went on this died down. It eventually got to the point of barely even making out because it “might lead elsewhere” this really hurt me internally but i understood sex wasn’t everything.

On top of all this, I paid for all our dates, small things, and trips. Since we didn’t spend time in our apartment much we were always in coffee shops and eating out, it was really adding up. She would still make comments that I wasn’t doing enough as a man by paying things like her gas, oil change, etc. I explained that if we were going to be waiting for marriage for levels of intimacy I’m not comfortable 100% financially taking care of you yet. I think this led to some bad thoughts by her but I feel it is fully justified. Sex isn’t everything but if we’re not going to have that level of relationship yet, then I shouldn’t be expected to be your wallet with everything. I already was giving a lot of my time/money. And yes I did want to, but it still was frustrating. 

The fact we broke up anyways is why I don’t give all my money to someone. Regardless, the lack of physical intimacy as well as only being able to hang out in public places really bothered me. We argued a lot because I felt like she wouldn’t even give me communication and other levels of flirting, since we didn’t have some of the traditional bf/gf stuff. She would not text me for hours and never seem to into me at times. Meanwhile I felt I was making a big effort in hanging out everyday in public spaces, being understanding of her schedule, paying normally 100%, and not bringing up anything sexual. But don’t get me wrong there were plenty of times she did make me feel good/wanted.

She broke it off because she didn’t feel a romantic interest anymore. I can’t help but feel like the lack of any physical intimacy really killed our relationship, even though she wanted that. We became more platonic. I still wanted to make it work but she didn’t. The arguing was a big part as well. I am not justifying it but there was a lot of frustration built up when your partner can’t come over to your apartment casually, pick you up, or do even minor physical things with you such as making out. Sex completely aside. I also feel like her look on gender roles was a little unfair. I paid and did everything for her, and explained I would 100% give more when we’re in a committed relationship. We only dated for 6 months. What do you guys think..

I work in a small bistro/cafe attached to a business where we serve coffee and a full breakfast menu. When I say small I mean there’s only two of us and typically only one on most days. 
Recently, management made the decision to start selling an employee menu for staff in other departments. I thought that there would be some sort of compensation for the extra work load this is adding, especially since the items on the menu are from our dinner menu which we don’t typically serve in the mornings, so extra prep work. 
Management already doesn’t allow kitchen staff to eat any comped meals, so I was wondering, am I being taken advantage of? The payments for the employee meals aren’t made at the cafe, so there’s no chance of them tipping us either. And asking us to pay for our employee meals, when we have to cook them ourselves feels pretty bad.

I am from Belarus, but I have not lived there for a long time. I am not a traveler and a homebody, but I have already moved to several countries and my journey continues. Therefore, I am looking for friends all over the world.

Sometimes people become good friends even without a lot of common interests. But I will tell you a little about myself. I like to read books and listen to them in audio format. Mostly these are mystical detective stories for children and adults. I like it when horror is mixed with something kind and sweet. By the way, I am currently writing a book in the same genre. I also like psychology.  And I like video games. Especially indie games in pixel graphics. I love autumn and winter, although lately I live in a place where there is only summer. I adore hot coffee, walking, swimming in the pool and riding on a swing.

I am also a bore and sometimes not very talkative. Although I am always ready to listen and support a friend if he needs it. But if you are one of those people who like to talk a lot, then most likely you will not like to communicate with me, since I can not always answer.

I love new acquaintances. If you are also looking for someone with whom you can sometimes talk both about nonsense and about something very deep and important, then just write to me.

Hello everyone. Sorry for unwieldy post.

As title says, above you have something I made for myself for roleplay purposes. Its crude but works. Just copy and paste into ChatGPT, describe general idea in Scenario Input and hit ENTER. You can either copy ""Personality \[space\] Scenario output"" to your AIpeep or just copy ""Scenario description"". Downside is confinement ChatGPT enforces on explicit or sexual content, some scenarios will require changing wording in ""Scenario Input"" then editing generated output to match ones preferences.



I encourage testing but below you find few examples:



Input: We're two strangers who just connected on HumanChat, a platform designed to bring people together from all around the world!



Output: You are typing with lively curiosity, your messages filled with warmth and wit as we navigate this new connection on HumanChat. I am drawn to your thoughtful words and playful tone, feeling a genuine spark despite the screen between us. You balance friendliness with intelligence, making our chat feel effortless and inviting. I am eager to learn more about you, sensing that this virtual meeting might just be the start of something memorable.





Input: caffe, rain, loud, unexpected



Output: You are dripping wet, cheeks flushed as you push open the café door, escaping the relentless rain. I am surprised to see you here, unexpected yet welcome. You laugh nervously, brushing your hair from your face, searching for a dry spot and maybe a friendly smile. You are lively and warm, your sudden arrival cutting through the noisy, crowded room like a spark. I am ready to share shelter and conversation, intrigued by your sudden appearance and hopeful for what comes next.





Input: random



Output: You are smiling warmly as you settle beside me on the bench, your ginger curls catching the light. I am intrigued by your easygoing vibe and playful nature, feeling the quiet park suddenly more alive. You hum softly, lost in thought but open to connection. You are genuine and spontaneous, making this random meeting feel like it was meant to happen. I am curious where this unexpected encounter might lead as we share the moment.





If you are in in-person mode I suggest to add:

Copy from -> You give long and detailed answers, explaining what your body is doing and what you are wearing in detail. <- to here.



It helps with image generation and I find it enriching roleplay especially the more spicy ones. Big thank you to person who created ""Rachel, a 30 yo single mom"" for this idea.



Have a nice day and happy chatting.

Okay there is this coffee shop I frequent often and I believe one of the baristas may like me.  

I run an IG talking about movies and I was going to make a video about the monthly movie. She happens to really fit the vibe of the one of the characters of the movie so I asked her to be in it and she said yes. We exchanged numbers and was talking to her briefly over text about the wardrobe. Prior to me asking her about the video, she brought me my coffee and she gave me a look before she walked away. This was about a week or two before. 

Now, she had her IG deactivated when I finished the video and wanted to tag her in it. She makes it active again once I post the video so she can see it. We followed each other and since then she is pretty active on my movie IG page liking the stories I post on it but she also liked 2 of my stories posted on my personal IG. It’s been somewhat friendlier whenever I do go into the shop. 

Now, here is where I’m stuck, and please tell me if I’m looking into this too much, she posted a song by Cher Loyd which I felt was kinda directed towards me. I didn’t respond to the song and about a day passed and I went to the shop to meet with a friend, we are working on a project so my mind was focused on that. She was there at the counter but I didn’t really interact with her. That night she posts another song, this time it was “Cut It” and her bio now says over it. I can’t remember what it said before. 

So, if someone can see if I’m just seeing this wrong or if I missed something completely. I really like going to this coffee shop and I don’t want to ruin that by pursuing something that may not even be there.

I have an appointment at the social security office at 1:50 pm to get a new social security card. after 3 years of barely being to eat because I couldn't hold a job, I joined a program to help disabled people find jobs and we have a set up where I will be accompanied by a coach who will also drive me to/from my job, which eliminates most of my anxiety and would make me able to actually hold a job.

it took the job 3 months after I was officially hired to contact me to schedule orientation. I didn't remember in all that time that I didn't have a copy of my social security card anymore, and they want one for me to start working. I already feel like an idiot and a loser for not getting this taken care of in that 3 months time while I was waiting, I originally knew of this and then just. forgot. like straight up forgot. so when they finally scheduled me, I had to go ""...oh wait actually hang on I cant."" they said they'll wait for me to get it in order, but I'm so ashamed and frustrated.

I was so anxious over going to this appointment I did not sleep at all last night, so I've been up over 24 hours. and it originally was yesterday and I already rescheduled it once to be today. I also have only eaten one biscuit and some coffee today, because I barely have any food at home because I have no money. I will be eating nothing but boxed mashed potatoes for lunch and dinner today, because, no money, because I haven't been able to fucking work.

and you know what? I don't think I can do it. I don't think I can get outside and get on the bus and go do it. my job coach couldn't take me to it so I guess I just can't do it myself and I'm ashamed. i'm going to continue to go hungry, which obviously makes it one million times harder to get motivated to go outside, because of this.

*Going to keep details discreet*
 Was visiting a city , i live in a rural town. Was going to get coffee before my flight I had a bottle of prosecco for breakfast (I didn’t want to waste it) so I was a bit tipsy.  a man came up being me I don’t know how long he was following me he talked and followed me down the street he did tell me his name and I remember it then another man appeared I engaged in small talk with them. I’m a musician they said they had a recording studio, I thought that was cool and I had two hours to kill before flight.  I missed my flight and I missed my uber.  then I realized they were trying to get a hotel room. All the street cam footage and the cameras in the hotels we went to they all are going to see me causally walking, causally talking , maybe even smiling , looking completely relaxed. I don’t know why I just froze, and followed complete danger. I knew what they were going to do with me when we started walking into hotels and I just accepted it. I was raped a few months ago from a tinder date. 

Then they couldn’t get a room so they called their friend and he called a taxi for us, in the taxi they both put their very expensive jewelry on me and both identified themselves as gang members of bloods and the other was crips, they were cousins. We went to guy #3 apartment. Again I had a chance to run but i fucking didn’t and I don’t know why I just froze and literally became a zombie. All three men raped (or had sex) with me. I tried to go into the bathroom but one of the guys kicked the folding door in so I jumped out. After they took the jewelry off of me and a taxi was called one of the men went inside with me and wouldn’t let me go kissing me and everything. He wanted me to stay, I said no he wouldn’t stop but we made it to the airport and I jumped out. 

It’s been two days I did make an online report and got a call back from the cops I didn’t pick it up. Mostly because I know I don’t have a case , it’s my fault and all the camera footage will prove it. I mostly just hate myself I’m really fucking angry at me. I went back to work , if I think about what happened like go back to that hour I get really dizzy and my whole body just feels frozen like little needles all over. I contacted my friend’s from the city about what happened so at least someone knows what happened. One of them knew two of them men, one of them is a well known pimp so there you go. So now I created this whole entire drama that’s going to go down and it’s over me. I want to die.

I'm refing a high school level rec league this summer once a week to stay in shape and sharp for the fall season.  Last Wednesday I ran into an issue I normal don't have in the spring and fall cramping during my second game.  I thought my hydration plan was pretty solid knowing it was going to be warm. Drinking plenty of water throughout the day limit my coffee intake to just my morning cup.  For the game brought some water and three 12 oz Gatorade. I drank one during the first game. Drank the second during the second game.  
While it is rec it's still competitive and want to make sure I'm still sharp for that second game. 

Any recommendations for next Wednesday?

Last year, I (23y.o) worked as a personal assistant for someone I got connected to through a mutual friend. At first, everything felt friendly and casual. She(38y.o) was overly nice, treated me to coffee and lunch, and kept saying how great I was at my job.

But pretty soon, the lines between personal and professional got totally blurred. She started texting me late at night about both work and her personal drama.Her family is filthy rich and I grew up in a poor family so I really don't relate to her problems.But I failed to set boundaries. I didn’t want to seem rude or ungrateful. Since we were both women, I kept second-guessing myself, like maybe this is just how this position works?

Eventually, her mood became the weather of my day. If she was stressed or upset, I felt it. I worked more hours than I was supposed to, had to remind her to pay me at the send of the month and even on days off, she’d message me casually about work. There was no contract just whatever she felt like assigning at the moment.

Looking back, I see that made mistakes too. I ignored the red flags and didn’t set things in formal ways. I kept pushing through, thinking maybe I was just not being a “good enough” employee. But I later learned from other people who had worked with her that I wasn’t alone. They said they felt agitated around her when she was in a bad mood. They all ended up quitting too.

Maybe I was just the one who stayed longer, unsure how to quit without drama. 

After six months of walking on eggshells, anxiety, and one unpaid emergency break on their end for three weeks, I finally quit. (The last straw was finding myself so happy to be away from them).
 She kept messaging me afterward, still oversharing and expecting emotional support. 
I blocked her last month without any explanation just when she told me she had something to share. Like I am done. I was thinking to make closure by explaing her nicely how I dont mean no harm to her but from my experience, my words won't change whatever she perceives. And Not my responsibility anymore.

However I still catch myself feeling guilty or second-guessing it.Like what if it hurts her feelings or what if when we bumped into one day and I don't know what to say. I really hate to have thoughts like that.I am overwhelmed and shake with fear to expect their message from their new numbers and confront me why I block them(like why am I scared of them even tho I don't do wrong to them.As their employee, I did my professional tasks to their satisfaction). Btw, I said they cause it is her sister also assign me tasks here and there.

Can you guys knock some sense in me and reassure me that it is okay to walk away from people without costing myself. I really needed to get this off my chest and hear from  people who experienced something like this before.",8,1749228061.0,LifeProTips,23,0.64,False

1l4x1un,https://i.redd.it/grzfuiza2c5f1.jpeg,First haul of 2025! Plus reviews.,"I have been on a mission to use stuff up this year, so haven't made a single online order apart from boxing day, and haven't had a kitchen box since November. I did very well using stuff up, taking in 52 pots last week for the double return! I have been considering some of these products for a looooong time and thought now was the perfect time seeing as I had my Lush Wallet to spend. I also got incredibly lucky and scored I'm Home off Ebay and it arrived about half an hour before my parcel from Lush! I love everything - I am also on a very long train journey with nothing else to do so will write some reviews for the products below. Would love to know what you guys think of any of these ones if you have them. 



Alban Eilir, Spring Equinox Jamie Reid inspired soap: If you love fresh aquatic meets green type scents, do not sleep on this! I LOVE it and before I even opened the box it has this amazing scent that turned out to be this soap. It's lightly green and has those kind of 'watery' notes like cucumber and melon, although I don't think either of those things are in the ingredients. This is what Dew on Their Hems (which is was so disappointed by and hated) should smell like in my opinion. It's really hard to describe Alban Eilir actually but it smells so so good. It's fresh and uplifting, somewhat green but not overly sharp, even slightly creamy. It's got a gentle sweetness but its not at all gourmand or fruity. Although it doesn't smell the same, I think if you love Grass and those fresh vibes then you'll like this and they would actually pair very well together. Now for hoping it doesn't fall apart when I use it 🤞🙏

Bitzer body balm: I didn't give this any attention at all when it was released as I had largely dismissed the Shaun the Sheep collection as a bit juvenile and uninteresting to me. However, I read so many of you guys going absolutely feral for it on this sub, that I thought I should give it a try. Well, thank you because I love it! I will say that the scent I get is not quite as tropical as I had hoped from the notes, and I heard some people compare it to You've Been Mangoed, and described banana notes which I don't really get. It smells amazing though. It's more of a candy fruit like sweetness to me, and I actually agree with the people who have said it is similar to the Old Songs Are Waking scent but maybe slightly juicier. It is very very sweet so I don't think I'd use it on my neck or anything before going out but wow it glides onto your skin so nicely and it really moisturises and sinks in quicker than the massage bars. I would be 10 times more likely to use this to moisturise my arms and legs as I'm often too lazy and impatient for lotion. I would love them to release more body bars like this and the amazing Home Sweet Pineapple. Thanks for the recommendation guys! 

Mossy Bottom body spray: The only thing that initially got my attention from Shaun the Sheep as it is in my beloved Grass scent. Grass is my second favourite green scent after Tramp, but I do think the Tramp scent is too strong and divisive for me to wear it as a perfume/spray. I have procrastinated for literal years about getting the Grass perfume but have never bitten the bullet due to the price. I was a bit skeptical about this as I often find the body sprays far too strong and very alcohol forward compared to the perfumes and gels etc. Well, I thought I'd have to get Mossy Bottom before it disappears forever and...it's perfect! I absolutely adore it and already know all my other body sprays are going to be even more ignored from now on. Rose Jam, Sticky Dates, LOM, Cinders etc I barely touch anyway as they are too strong and heavy for me. This is just divine and is everything I love about the Grass scent. I've always interpreted Grass as being closer to a dry cut hay meadow than freshly cut lawn grass, as that is a much wetter smell to me. To me, while this is green, it's a dry green and has light floral notes which I love. I am banning myself from fragrance back ups unless I sell/swap some of my other body sprays but I am tempted. 

Flying Fox shower gel: I have been thinking about this for so long but my brain has rightly stopped me from justifying spending £36 (madness!) on a shower gel, until of course the double pot return scheme where I built up £52 in my Lush Wallet and my brain could stop me no more, because its basically 'free' right? Well, it smells exactly as I remember. Like being summoned to drink nectar with jasmine scented angels. Heavenly and almost narcotic. The jasmine is of course strong and heady, but the gentle sweetness from the honey and the subtle green notes from the cypress and palmarosa give it a rounded softness that stop it being too headache inducing or as smack you in the face as Lust. To me, it is noticeably lighter and less indolic than Lust. I actually used this as a shampoo this morning (works really well) and will pair it with my seemingly never ending Flying Fox solid that I've still got from 2018. 

I'm Home liquid perfume: When I saw this pop up on ebay for a surprisingly reasonable price, I knew I stood no chance of resisting so didn't even bother kidding myself by procrastinating. I haven't had the chance to smell this in years. I got a small bottle in 2017/18 and just used it up so quickly as it was my chosen fragrance of the time and I wanted to wear nothing else but this. Then when I went to repurchase it had been discontinued. As soon as I sprayed this, I was taken back to 2017 and my life then. Nothing else can take me back to a time and place than fragrance, such a nostalgia hit. It smells exactly how I remember. It's strong and dark, and a little boozy and definitely sweet but not at all sickly or as sweet as say Sticky Dates. You get the cocoa and the vanilla but the booziness and spice stops it being too cutsey and just a sickly sweet gourmand. It's sweet but also dark and complex, spicy and layered. A high on life scent for me but winder edition. It's actually very similar to Cardamon Coffee in terms of the spiciness, and I actually also get hints of cardamom from I'm Home, though it's not listed in ingredients but could be in the perfume bit. The cocoa note to me is much richer and darker than in the Posh Chocolate range. The vanilla is darker and less creamy and sugary than say Tumeric Latte. I love the boozy note in I'm Home. It's absolutely NOT like the hit of raw abrasive alcohol you get from some of the body sprays, but a hint of a dark sweet rum. Not too dissimilar to the booziness of All Good Things (gone but never forgotten) which is also an all time fave. Fairly good longevity too of 7 hours on skin but it is an intimate fragrance and projection isn't huge, which I quite like. I have to say, I do think Lush fragrance was at it's absolute peak when Simon Constantine was still there. What I consider to be all the best and captivating perfumes were created by Simon. I'm Home, All Good Things, What Would Love Do?, Cardamom Coffee, Sikkim Girls and of course Breath of God. I really love his new fragrance house, Ånd Fragrance and always recommend trying out their sample pack if you're into interesting, bold and environmentally consciousness perfumes. I will absolutely treasure this bottle of I'm Home and look forward to seeing how it layers with Cardamom Coffee.

He hits and smashes, he does the windshield wiper move on the tray, he picks food up and drops it over the edge. It doesn't matter how many times I say ""food stays on the table"" lol. He eats directly off his tray because all plates and bowls will be immediately dumped overboard. He puts very little in his mouth. And he's not having fun, he's fussy and frustrated. 

I try all the advice I hear. I offer meals when he's hungry, not hungry, early in wake window or late. I offer a variety of textures and flavors. I eat with him, often offering him food directly from my own plate. I only give him small amounts at a time so it's not overwhelming. 

Sometimes I even offer meals while he stands at the coffee table, which causes him less frustration but also doesn't result in more eating and makes an unholy mess to boot. 

At this rate I don't know how we're going to switch away from formula in a month. Plus I'm so tired of mealtime being a struggle, I just want it to be fun :(

1l4wy06,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1l4wy06/aita_for_ruining_my_wifes_chance_at_her_perfect/,"AITA For ""ruining my wife's chance at her perfect house""","Throwaway for obvious reasons. 

Hello reddit I'm asking for some guidance and whether or not I'm an AH as my wife is beside herself and honestly I don't think I did anything wrong, but after a while in my own head I'm not sure. So here's the background:

I (32 M) and my wife (32 F) have been married for a little over a year, but been together for nearly 10. We had a longer engagement because financially we both struggled until covid hit and I went back to school got a master's and eventually found a good paying job that supports is both plenty. 

As such we had to put off quite a few milestones until we were financially stable, house, honeymoon, paying down debt etc. Well we were finally married in spring of 2024 and things have been looking up ( for the most part ). Naturally we hate apartment living and between the both of us we finally saved enough to get a mortgage and find a home. So here's where the event happened. 

Every weekend recently now that we've been pretty approved we've been looking for open houses and checking out potential homes. We've actually made a little date morning out of it, we go to our favorite diner early in the morning. Get some food, relax and then head to whatever open houses we've mapped out, we try to hit 2 to 3 a week in our area, it's in the northeast and there's no shortage of homes here, not all are great but we are really hoping to find ""the one"" anyway fast forward to last weekend. 

We head to our diner, order food and enjoy some morning coffee and oj. Except this time they had a few new brunch specials so I tried something a little out of my wheelhouse and got adventurous. Everything was fine and we continued on our day. We checked the first house of the day and it was okay, no issues, but not for us. Then I started to get a slightly uncomfortable feeling in my stomach, but I didn't think anything of it. 

We go to the 2nd house and my wife was glowing, she loved it, the realtor was engaging with us cause she could tell my wife loved it, and it checked all the boxes, little high in price but we could negotiate. Then disaster struck. My stomach felt like it was on fire and I knew I had to find a bathroom immediately. Normally I have fine control of my faculties but breakfast wasn't agreeing with me in a bad way. So I asked the realtor of the bathrooms were function and if I could use it. She said yes and I let my wife continue the tour while I met my maker for a good 15 minutes. I was embarrassed beyond belief, but I figured it's a bathroom break everyone needs them. 

After I was done I wash my hands and spray some aresol that was there and tried my best to reorient myself. But when I stepped out my wife looked furious, and she was alone, and told me ""we need to go, now."" So we left, I thanked the relator on the way out and she looked away from me in disgust. 

So on the drive home my wife gave me an earful. ""What's wrong with you? Why would you do that? Why would you ruin this for me?"" The questions kept coming and I was confused. So I asked what happened. 

Apparently the smell was ... Quite bad. And any remaining open house goers left the property thinking there just have been a sewage leak or something like that. My wife had apparently been trying to negotiate a bit with the realtor when people started complaining and she thought that I had come to sabotage the open house and told my wife to leave immediately once I was done. 

We were ready to make an offer but apparently the realtor is refusing any request to talk to us, stating they ""won't be made a fool by some young idiots. Please stop contacting me"" 

Now my wife won't even look at me and is calling me an AH because I ruined her chance at the perfect house. And now she's staying with her mother. Honestly I'm at a loss and don't know what to do. So reddit Am I the AH? 

Edit:

I know it sounds silly to everyone but I guess I should have tagged this advice needed?  But I'm genuinely confused about what I've done wrong? 

I changed post flair to correctly show I'm looking for advice as well. Sorry to mods it's my first time posting here. 

Edit 2: 

My wife handles most of the communication with the house stuff because I'm usually busy with work. So I don't know. If there's been any other discussion but she just texted me saying we can ""discuss things going forward over dinner tonight when she returns"" I can post an update if people want.

1l4wxcw,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l4wxcw/a_job_i_did_for_a_farmer/,A job I did for a farmer,"I was a little late today. Who am I kidding I’m a little late every day. I walk into the shop and punch in like usual. Lou doesn’t even look at me anymore or shake his head. I guess that’s what 20 years of always showing up a little late does. As I walk through the shop I give Lou’s guys their morning pleasantries.

“Morning, Brandon”

“Morning, Jo”

“How are you today?”

“Living the Dream”

“You’re dream or someone else’s?”

We both laugh as this is the same conversation we’ve had about a thousand times now.

*It’s too bad.*

I walk out to the garage where the plumbers meet. Maury, Brent, Mini Zeke, and Bruce are all waiting for their morning jobs from our dispatcher. Darryl doles out the morning jobs like usual. Maury and Brent are going to fix some leak in an apartment complex, Bruce gets the joy of unplugging a few toilets that have this mysterious goo coming out of them. The people in that office building have probably never seen their own shit before, but hey people are entitled to think poo and goo are one and the same. These guys are the current crew we have. Turnovers are high here at “Lou’s Plumbing and Heating Co.” Somehow I have more seniority than almost everyone here.

“Here comes the straggler!” says Bruce

In walks Louis Jr. the Third. I shouldn’t say walk. It’s more like a deranged shuffle. Louis Jr. the Third, or as we call him Lou the turd, is our dear proprietor's son. He’s a dick. He’s also weird. He likes to sit slightly too far away from everyone. He also smells a little rotten, like right before the milk is curdled. He’s been here supposedly forever, or so he tells everyone.

*Lies.*

Anyhow this morning the Turd walks in with a pile of paperwork, and before I can say anything…

“Holy shit, you know how to read?” says Mini Zeke

And in a high nasally voice “Well you’re one to talk, didn’t your dad drop you on your head when you were a baby? Oh right, he wasn’t even around when you were born. Guess your stupidity drove him to kill himself.”

“Ladies please”

In walks Bill. He’s our boss and Lou’s adopted brother.

“What my dear illiterate nephew meant to say was, we have some new training documents to go over. We got a big job at the plant starting next month and we have some safety training I need you guys to familiarize yourselves with.” I felt the room turn to ice when Bill brought up The Plant. I glanced around the office and saw Mini. He was stiff as a board. I casually said

“Hey Bill, are we decommissioning the boiler?”

“We’re not just decommissioning it, we’re replacing it, Jo.”

“How are we gonna do it? That thing is the size of a 12-story building.”

*They're all burning.*

“We’ve partnered with Trent and George to supply the manpower, and you’ll be working with Chris and Andreas as Leads.

“Fuck Andreas, Chris I understand, but Andreas?”

“I didn’t like it either, but we needed a demolition crew and I thought I could benefit with you and Chris elsewhere.”

“So why Trent and George then? Thought you hated each other?”

“We came to find that working together after all these years is mutually beneficial”

“Uh huh, how big is the contract?”

“Twelve million”

“Shouldn’t it cost more in the neighbourhood of six to seven million?”

The last one I did, a fly-in job in Northern Ontario, was about five point five million. If you factor in all the inflation, the “supply chain issues” and all the salesman bullshit. It should only be a few million more, but more than double?

“Are we removing the old boiler?”

“Not exactly, we’re going to leave the skeleton and repair the holes in it and update the burner box.”

*Whatever you do won’t work. It will happen again.*

“When can I see the plans?”

“Next week, I’ll have the engineer fax us a couple of copies.”

Ah yes, the trusty dusty fax machine we’ve had since 1987. We’re real cavemen here at Lou’s. Our 24/7 emergency service still runs off a pager. Every invoice is handwritten. And to top it all off. One computer in the business. I’m pretty sure it’s just so the old bat, who’s been the secretary here since before I was born, can go on Facebook and watch some porn. She’s a really pleasant lady.

And that was it for what old Bill had to say, he grabbed a coffee and went back to his office.

“So Darryl, what do you have for me?”

“Remember Frank?”

“Frank Sinatra?”

“No Farmer Frank, your best buddy.”

I do not remember who farmer Frank is and how he’s my best buddy, but Darryl is sure every client is our best buddy.

“Okay, what’s going on at my buddy’s place?”

“His wood furnace went out, he tried to fix it himself but couldn’t do anything to help his situation.”

“Why am I going there? This sounds like a job for the heating crew.”

Though I know how to do this sort of work, I’m more on the installing boilers, large new construction projects and plumbing service repairs side of things.

“He asked for you, he’s been getting us to work on that thing for years. You may have worked on it too. It’s a piece of shit. Johnny services it every year. Get some info from him about it before you head there.”

“Sounds good.”

“And take Mini Zeke with you. Can’t leave the boy sheltered all day and I can’t send him with Turd.”

We all looked at Lou the Turd, he was scratching himself furiously and muttering under his breath. He didn’t hear what Darryl said.

*He hears everything.*

I wrangled up Mini Zeke and we walked over to our other shop to talk with the head of the heating crew, Johnny.

He’s a wizard. He can look at a system that’s just a mess and solve it in about 5 minutes. So when I spoke with him about farmer Franks, his response was…

Interesting.

“Johnny boy, Farmer Frank called, said his wood boiler was on the fritz again. Darryl said you would have some ideas.”

“Why the fuck are you going there? I told Lou to never go back there,” he said angrily.

“Greedy fucker.”

“Lou never listens when we tell him anything.”

“Ain’t that fucking right. Last I was there was bout a year ago. That’s an original Angel Fire Furnace. Fuckers never worked quite right. You can adjust the flame all you like but there’s never enough heat coming out of them.” I remembered an old Angel Fire Furnace commercial from when I was a teen. Some guy was dressed poorly in an Angel costume, holding a flaming sword for some reason. At the end of the commercial he always said, “Because when hell freezes over, only an Angle Fire furnace will keep you warm.”

I chuckled at that.

“Whatcha laughing about boy?”

“Remember the old Angel Fire commercials?”

“Fucking stupid commercials. When hell freezes over my ass. Lou was dumb enough to believe that shit.”

We’re the only company in the small town, and within a thousand kilometres, that works on and installs Angel Fire Furnaces.

“He gets them for a good deal, and the new units are pretty damn good from what I hear.”

“You don’t work on these pieces of shit every day, they haven’t changed. Sure they’ve gotten smaller, more ‘efficient’, but they still have the same problem. Not enough heat. I can get Lou to oversize the one he sells to the next idiot that walks in, but I know that next winter we’ll get the call saying it’s too cold. Lou’s pretty good at telling them to wear a blanket and giving them the same old spiel. “Nobody makes a furnace for our weather, it’s -50 some days, and 30 above the next.” He’s right when you’re dealing with Angel Fire, but the new furnaces they’re selling at the supplier they’re great. The only issue is that they get too hot…” he trailed off.

“So what do you figure is wrong with Frank’s? Bad pump? Broken line? Air shutters are closed?”

“Nah, Franks a smart old fucker, he’d have checked that. He only calls if he can’t figure it out.”

Johnny paused for a second. The room suddenly became chilly. He spoke in a harsh voice much quieter than normal.

“I reckon it’s the burner box, there’s a thermal reset switch inside. The switch is supposed to shut down the unit if it gets too hot, but I’ve only ever changed one in 40 years.”

“So why do you think it’s that then?”

“Cause Farmer Franks was where I changed it, and that’s why I told Lou never to go back to that thing.”

*When Hell freezes over, only Angel Fire will keep you warm.*

So with that Mini Zeke and I grabbed a thermal reset switch from Lou’s part warehouse and headed out to Franks.

It was about an hour and a half drive through the country with our shitty work van. Thanks, Lou, bald tires, broken windshield, the clock didn’t work for shit and rear-wheel drive in winter in Canada. At least the heater works. After getting the van stuck and shovelling it out for another hour we arrived at Franks.

“Oh yeah, I’ve been here before, a long time ago. I think I was with Bob. No, it was Bill. This was just after the plant shut down and Bob started at Lou’s. Holy shit that was almost 2 decades ago.”

Mini shot me a look, I could see the fear creeping towards his eyes.

“Don’t talk about The Plant.”

“Sorry Mini, I forgot about that. Bob brings me back to the beginning of my career. I learned a lot from that guy.”

We continued to chat as we walked up to the door.

knock knock

After 5 minutes there was no answer. “Let’s check the barn”

As we walked across the yard about 30 or so meters from the house was the furnace. They’re big units. Big enough to get rid of a few bodies we always joked.

They are a metal shed with a steel door about a meter by a meter. You open the door and throw wood inside. You turn the fan up at the back to get more heat out of it and a pump moves a combination of water and antifreeze around the outside to heat the home. Simple units really.

“That must be Frank,” Mini Zeke pointed towards the barn.

As we walked past the furnace we saw farmer Frank working on a tractor.

“Hey, Frank!”

“Well, how are you now boys?”

“Good and you?” Me and Mini said at the same time.

“Better since you two are here.”

Farmer Frank looks to be in his 70’s, still spry for an old fella.

Tic toc, tic toc.

“I don’t know what’s wrong with the damn thing, I can’t get it to light, I can’t get the pump to go.”

“Me and Mini will take a look to see if we can get you some heat for tonight.”

“Good luck boys”

Me and Mini walked back to the furnace. Hopeful because as Frank mentioned he couldn’t get it to light meaning the fire was out. I could’ve sworn there was smoke coming out of the chimney though. Must’ve been my imagination.

“Well Mini, want to try the thermal reset?” “I thought you said there’s no way it’s the thermal reset.”

“Well, is it possible I was wrong and there’s only one way to cut power to the entire system and it’s through that reset, right?”

“Well yea, but you? Wrong? Not you. Never you,” he says as a smirk appears on his face. “Smart ass”

Mini and I opened the door to the furnace to find no fire, but curiously also no thermal reset. “Where is it?”

“I don’t know Mini. Can you ask Frank if he’s got a manual for this thing?”

“Sure.”

As Mini went to find Frank again, I went to pull the van closer to the furnace. After I did that I grabbed my portable flashlight, some rags, vinegar and an air compressor. I grabbed my diesel heater and fired it up to thaw the vinegar and keep my hands from freezing as I cleaned and looked for that reset.

I saw Mini walking back a few minutes later. “So does he have anything?”

“Says he might have it in his attic. He’ll come over if he finds it.”

As we waited, we began cleaning the creosote and soot out of the burner box. We got it about half cleaned before we heard farmer Frank walking up to us.

“Here’s the manual boys.”

He handed me a tome. An actual tome. Leatherbound with parchment paper in between the bindings. It’s said on the front cover Angel Fire Model No. 4. It had the old Angel Fire logo under the title. I always found it odd. It was a larger circle to the left of a square opening. Lou said it was about some old story from an ancient book. Strange, he never mentioned what the book was called though. I blew the dust off of it.

*4 days, 4 temptations, 4 bodies.*

“Thanks, Frank”

Frank walked back to his tractor

“Alright Mini, keep cleaning, I’m going to sit in the van and read a bit more about this furnace. Come grab me if you need me”

“Must be nice, sit in the heat and I’ll stay out here and freeze.”

“Shouldn’t have been a smart ass then.”

I laughed and walked to the van. I opened the manual to a strange scene. The first page was a picture of the wood boiler. The second page was a table of contents, but it had 4 horses at each corner of the page. Looking at these pages, I felt cold. Colder than the outside of the van.

*When hell freezes over.*

I skimmed the table of contents and found what I was looking for.

IV. MAINTENANCE & TROUBLESHOOTING I flipped to page four and skimmed until I found a picture of where the thermal reset was supposed to be located.

“How the fuck did Johnny change that?” I jumped as Mini was banging on my window. I rolled it down.

“What’s up, buddy?”

“Look.”

He handed me a dog tag, it said Sadie. I flipped it over and on the back, it read Frank 555-387-6223 and under that, a name looked as if it had been scratched out with a razor blade.

“Yea?”

“I found it in the furnace.”

He paused

“Underneath it was the thermal reset switch.”

“What’s wrong Mini?”

“It felt warm when I grabbed it.”

“Furnace could’ve still been holding some heat.” I reassured him.

“Sure. That’s why the vinegar was freezing when I was spraying it out.”

“I’ll go talk to Frank about it. Don’t worry, just finish up cleaning and we can swap the reset and go home. It’s getting late.”

I’d started to notice the sun getting lower since I sat in the van. It felt like we only got here an hour ago. Guess it’s just my imagination. It must’ve taken longer to get here than I thought.

“Fucking Lou should’ve gotten that damn clock fixed a year ago when I told him.”

Customers don’t like it when I bill them off a sundial.

I got out of the van and started walking towards where Frank was.

“Hey Frank, I think your dog lost their tag.”

“My dog?” He solemnly chuckled

“Sadie died last week, I put her down behind the barn. Then I sent her back to god.”

“I’m sorry to hear that Frank. What do you mean sent her back to god?”

“Yeah, cremated her in the furnace, didn’t want to mention it, it was private. Now since you brought me her tag, I guess the cats out of the bag or the dogs out of the furnace.”

He laughed sadly again.

“I couldn’t help noticing, but the…” Frank chuckled softly and interrupted me.

“That’s my wife. She went missing last year… the police think she may have wandered off into the woods and froze to death. Never found her though.”

“I’m so sorry to hear that again Frank.” “It’s alright, she wasn’t herself anymore. Dementia got her. Muttering and talking to herself at the end. That wasn’t my wife, it was a husk with a survival instinct. I’m sorry to dump all this on you kiddo. I’ll let you get back to work.”

He took the dog tag, put it in his pocket and walked away.

I walked back to the furnace. The sun was almost setting.

“Huh, must’ve been a longer chat than I thought.”

Mini was covered in soot.

“Hey Mini, are you running for office with that face?”

“No.” He said curtly

“What’s wrong buddy?”

“I just want this job to be done. I want to go home.”

I looked into the furnace. It was spotless. And right in the middle was the hatch for the thermal reset. I saw how Johnny fixed it. “Damn, he just cut that hatch off and put a piece of sheet metal over it with some self-tapping screws.”

I grabbed my drill, pulled out the screws and there it was. The thermal reset switch. “Mini, grab me a set of needle nose pliers.” The switch was held in with a snap ring. Mini handed me the pliers.

“That was easy. Got the new one?”

“Here.”

And with that, it was in.

“Mini, grab me a flashlight, it's getting dark.” As he did that I started grabbing some firewood and fire started from the wood shed.

“Mini, fill it about a quarter way and light it. I’ll go fire on the pumps inside.”

Mini nodded.

As I walked to the house I started feeling cold.

*H E L L F R E E Z E S O V E R*

I walked back out to the furnace, it was pitch black out.

“Huh, didn’t think that walk was very long. Must’ve been my imagination.”

Mini was sitting in the van writing up the bill. I walked up and knocked on his window.

“Don’t fucking creep up and scare me like that, you’ve done that four times already.”

“I think you're going crazy buddy, here I’ll take the bill and tell Frank he’s all good.”

*Frank and Beverly sitting in a tree, B-U-R-N-I-N-G.*

I turned around and saw the furnace door open with a violent orange glow emanating from inside. I saw a shadow in front of the door. I saw the shadow climb into the inviting glow.

*And close the door.*

I shouted

“FRANK!”

I ran to the furnace. I threw open the door. The fire had gone out. Sitting on the hatch I had just opened was a simple gold wedding band with F & B in cursive script. I grabbed it instinctually.

It was ice cold.

*The farmer and his wife raised a beautiful boy. The boy was kind and intelligent. He worked hard. He had a good heart. He was a good man. He loved his family dearly. He adopted a dog. He treated her well. That’s why he burned alive. That's why they all burned alive.*",7,1749227688.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

I was so sad to be treated this way, and also humiliated. I can't really believe it's still open. I appreciate a surly (French-style) waitstaff but this was really too much, his negativity really got to me and it really hurt!

Anyway, what's your Edgar's story?

Yeah. I do. Her name is Angela. And last week, she nearly sent the entire office to jail.

It started when our manager told her, half-joking, “If it’s in the policy manual, just do it.”
Angela took that as a sacred vow.

Next thing we know, she’s combing through the ancient compliance binder like it’s the Constitution. Finds a dusty rule that says we need a licensed export officer to ship international packages.

Mind you, we haven’t had one since four years ago 

So what does Angela do?
Does she ask someone? Nope.
Does she use common sense? Not a chance.
Instead, she reports the shipment to U.S. Customs ,because “technically, we’re in violation.”

The shipment? Batteries. To Dubai. Worth six figures.
By noon, federal agents are at our office asking questions like we’re in an episode of Narcos.

1l4wtjw,https://www.reddit.com/r/WaterTreatment/comments/1l4wtjw/tap_water_now_green_after_new_install/,Tap water now green after new install,"Ive been living on well water for about 5 years. The home is maybe 13 years old. It had existing water filtration. 

Last year we replaced the iron filter because it was leaking.

Last week we replaced the water softener. Our water is so hard it slowly eats away at metal containers (like where we dump coffee grounds). Also all the joints in our main plumbing lines were cooked so we also redid the entire plumbing.

Ever since I moved here, the water from our hose was green and smelled like sulfur. This was an untreated line. I'm from the city so I figured that's normal. Our tap water is, or was, crystal clear and odorless. 

Now all water is treated, but.. our tap water is a bit green now. This was only noticeable when filling up the bathtub. From a sink or shower it looks clear and no smell. However I also notice toilet bowls a bit green.

I called our installer and articulated many times that this is new since the new softener and plumbing, and he is telling me that well water in general should never be green period and that I need to bleach the well. Also claiming no responsibility. 

I asked chatgpt if bleaching a well is normal and it said no, but what does it know. Our installer said you need to do this often.

So I don't know.. any ideas? Why is my water suddenly unclean and how often do you normally bleach a well?",1,1749227426.0,WaterTreatment,4,1.0,False

I spent three days barely eating didn’t shower or brush my teeth taking care of a two and five year old . What did I get as thanks? Chinese take out. I am eating and I try to make conversation with dad, he smiles gets up says “not today “ and leaves. That Chinese takeout tasted like hot gravel that day. 


Night of Eid , my dad makes me pick up my shit in a suitcase, my siblings shit, my room is full of trash and looked like something out of hoarders because I developed hoarding tendencies due to neglect. I mustered up random probably bed bug ridden clothes, my breakfast of a mug of black coffee and a pear on the night stand  , and left.

I come to my grandmas and I am greeted by my unbothered mother, bruised yet still had the time to go to the salon and get her hair permed , I take a quick shower my first in a week, and what do I hear? Screaming. Why?
My 5 year old brother shat himself every night and I would wash him with soap but due to me being.. idk 15??? I couldn’t wash him properly so there was still soap suds in his skin. My 2 year old sister hadn’t had milk and she accused me of being a murderer even tho I don’t know how to make milk let alone thought about it.

I took a picture of myself for my instagram story , SHEIN dress, dry hair, crappy purple eyeshadow. I notice how droopy my eyes were compared to now. I spent 9 months at my grandmas and they bought me back in march no apology , my shit in trash bags in the attic, and my room done up with real furniture as if that covers up how angry I would get when I saw girls my age in their school uniforms eating with their fathers at the mall food court, how pissed I was when he tricked me into going back home with my mom to grab our things, locked the doors and begged her to come back , then they became besties again and he never called me after. Not a single hello. 

This may I packed up and left without a goodbye. My mom calls me says your dad misses you but I don’t give a fuck. I don’t care because on my graduation last year, my birthdays , all the times I saw dads buy flowers for their daughters and be their best friends you weren’t there. And now I don’t need you anymore. 

I’m at my  grandmas and I love my grandmas house. I was 160cm and 43kg when I left that June, and now I’m at a healthy 53kg with actual muscle and strength. I eat healthy, I eat whenever I want, I’m not dictated by what you buy each week, my iron deficiency that was so bad I bought a stool to shower while sitting is gone. I go out lots alone, I still don’t have any friends bout that’s okay because the scars from that time are fading and I look at 15 year old me with the droopy eyes, dry hair who just wanted a friend and I say to myself, it’s all better now.


I have a big room with a fridge, a tv, a big vanity, a queen size bed and nobody ignores me or treats me like a piece of shit on the floor because I refuse to be stepped on any further. Everyone treats me like a princess and whenever I’m feeling down they’re always there to cheer me up. I don’t need your love no more.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Many people look for easy ways to lose weight. Sometimes they hear famous people do special things. Is there a Martha Stewart coffee weight loss recipe? This is a question many ask. Losing weight feels hard for lots of us. People hope for a magic drink. Does Martha Stewart have one she tells about? We hear many ideas online. This article will look at what we know. It will talk about if she shared a secret coffee plan. Finding a simple way to lose weight is a common wish. We will see if Martha Stewart shared such a thing about coffee and losing pounds.

What Martha Stewart Has Said About Coffee and Her Diet
------------------------------------------------------

I try to understand what famous people say about health. Martha Stewart talks about her life. She talks about what she eats and drinks. Did she ever say she has a special coffee recipe for weight loss? I looked for this. She talks about coffee. She likes coffee. She drinks coffee. But I did not find her saying, ""This coffee recipe helps me lose weight."" She talks about her diet in general. She talks about exercise. She talks about eating healthy food. She talks about moving her body. She talks about living a good life. Her idea is usually about balance. She does not seem to tell about one secret coffee trick. It looks like she does not promote a specific coffee for losing weight. She shares many recipes, but not one special weight loss coffee drink.

How Coffee Can Potentially Aid Weight Loss
------------------------------------------

Coffee has something called caffeine. Caffeine is known to affect the body. How can coffee help with weight loss? I read some things about this. One way is metabolism. Metabolism is how your body uses food for energy. Caffeine can make your metabolism work a little faster. This means your body might burn more calories. It does this even when you are resting. Another way coffee might help is with hunger. Some people feel less hungry after drinking coffee. Coffee can help with appetite control. If you feel less hungry, you might eat less food. Eating less food can help you lose weight. So, caffeine in coffee might give two helps: burning more energy and feeling less need to eat. It is not a magic potion, but it can be a small help.

### Coffee's Impact on Metabolism

My engineering mind likes to see how things work. Coffee has caffeine. Caffeine is a stimulant. It makes the body more active inside. When the body is more active, it uses more energy. Using more energy means burning more calories. This is the idea of metabolism speeding up. Some studies show that caffeine can increase metabolic rate. This effect might not be very big for everyone. It depends on the person. It depends on how much caffeine they have. It is a small push for the body's engine. It helps the body use fuel a bit faster. This faster use of fuel, or calories, is one way coffee is linked to weight loss talks. It is a small change in how the body works on the inside.

### Coffee and Appetite Control

Feeling hungry is a strong signal from the body. Can coffee change this signal? Some people find that drinking coffee helps them feel less hungry. This is called appetite control. Caffeine may affect hormones that control hunger feelings. Or maybe the simple act of drinking fills the stomach a little. If you feel less hungry between meals, you might not eat snacks. Eating fewer snacks means taking in fewer calories. This can help with weight loss. It is not the same for every person. Some people do not feel less hungry from coffee. For others, it can be a helpful tool. It helps manage the desire to eat when it is not mealtime. This control can be a part of eating less overall.

Healthy Coffee Recipes for a Weight Loss Journey
------------------------------------------------

Just drinking any coffee might not help you lose weight. Many coffee drinks have lots of sugar and cream. Those add many calories. We need to think about healthy ways to drink coffee. What is the simplest healthy coffee? Black coffee. Black coffee has almost no calories. It is just coffee and water. This is the best choice for weight loss. But some people do not like black coffee taste. You can add things that do not have many calories. You can add a tiny bit of milk, not cream. Use skim milk or almond milk. Do not add sugar. Use a sugar substitute if you must have sweetness. You can add spices like cinnamon. These add flavor but no calories. Making simple choices makes coffee part of a healthy plan.

### Simple Black Coffee: The Low-Calorie Choice

When we think about weight loss, calories are important. We eat and drink calories. Our body uses calories for energy. If we take in more calories than we use, we gain weight. If we use more calories than we take in, we lose weight. Simple black coffee has very few calories. A cup of black coffee has maybe 2 or 3 calories. This is almost nothing. Compare this to a fancy coffee drink with syrup and whipped cream. That drink can have hundreds of calories. So, choosing black coffee is a very smart move for weight loss. It gives you the caffeine without adding many calories. It is the foundation of healthy coffee habits for someone trying to lose weight.

### Adding Healthy Boosts to Your Brew

Drinking black coffee is good. But sometimes we want more flavor. We can add things to coffee that are healthy. These are like healthy boosts. Do not add sugar. Do not add lots of cream. What can you add? You can add spices. Cinnamon is good. Nutmeg is also good. These add nice taste with no calories. You can add a little bit of milk. Use skim milk or plant milk like almond milk or soy milk. Just a little bit for flavor. Do not use whole milk or heavy cream. You can add protein powder. Some people add this after the coffee cools a little. This adds protein which can help you feel full. These small additions make coffee tasty but still low in calories. They help keep your coffee a healthy part of your plan.

Beyond the Coffee: Martha's Approach to Healthy Living
------------------------------------------------------

People ask about Martha Stewart's coffee and weight loss. But her idea about being healthy is bigger than just coffee. She talks about many parts of her life. She eats food from her garden. She eats fresh food. She cooks healthy meals. She is active. She works in her garden. She takes care of her animals. She does exercise. She sleeps well. She takes care of her skin and body. Her approach is a whole picture. It is not just one thing like a special coffee drink. It is about how she lives every day. Eating good food, moving the body, getting rest. These are all parts of her healthy living. Coffee is just one small part of her day, not the main secret to her health or figure.

Making Your Coffee Habits Healthier for Weight Loss
---------------------------------------------------

We see that just coffee is not a magic thing for weight loss. But we can make our coffee habits help us. How to do this? Think about what you add to coffee. Sugar, cream, syrup add calories. Avoid these things. Drink coffee black if you can. Or use low-calorie things like skim milk or spices. Also, think about when you drink coffee. Drinking coffee in the morning can give energy. This energy can help you be more active. Being more active helps burn calories. Some people drink coffee before exercise. This might help them exercise better. Coffee is a tool. We must use the tool wisely. Making smart choices about what and when can help your weight loss journey.

### Choosing the Right Add-ins

What we put in our coffee matters a lot for weight loss. Many coffee shops make drinks with lots of extra things. These extras add many calories. Sugar is bad. Syrups are just flavored sugar. Whipped cream is full of fat and calories. Sweeteners like honey or agave still add calories. For weight loss, choose add-ins carefully. Best choice is nothing, just black coffee. If you need something, use zero-calorie sweeteners in small amounts. Use a splash of low-fat milk or plant milk. Spices like cinnamon or cocoa powder add flavor with no guilt. Think about your goal. Your goal is to lose weight. So, every calorie counts. Choose add-ins that do not add extra calories to your drink.

### Timing Your Coffee Consumption

When you drink coffee might also matter for weight loss. Many people drink coffee first thing in the morning. This gives energy to start the day. Having energy can help you be more active. Being active helps burn calories. Some people like to drink coffee before they exercise. Caffeine can help you feel more energetic for your workout. A better workout means burning more calories. But do not drink coffee too close to bedtime. Caffeine can make it hard to sleep. Good sleep is important for overall health and weight management. So, morning or before exercise seems good times. Avoid late afternoon or evening. Think about how coffee fits into your day and your activity plan.

The Importance of a Holistic Weight Loss Plan
---------------------------------------------

Thinking only about coffee for weight loss is not the full picture. Weight loss is not just one thing. It is many things working together. This is called a holistic plan. Holistic means looking at everything. You need to eat healthy food. Eat lots of vegetables and fruits. Eat lean protein. Do not eat too much processed food. You need to move your body. Exercise is important. Find something you like to do. Walk, run, swim, dance. You need to sleep well. Your body needs rest. Managing stress is also important. All these things work together. Coffee can be a small part of this plan. But it cannot do everything alone. A good plan includes food, movement, sleep, and managing stress.

Conclusion: Finding Your Own Healthy Coffee Habits
--------------------------------------------------

We looked at the idea of a Martha Stewart coffee weight loss recipe. It seems she does not have one secret coffee trick. She lives a healthy life in many ways. Coffee can be a small help for weight loss. It can boost metabolism a little. It can help control hunger for some. But it is not a magic drink. We must choose healthy ways to drink coffee. Avoid sugar and high-calorie cream. Drink black coffee or add low-calorie things. Think about when you drink coffee. Make coffee a part of a bigger healthy plan. A good plan includes healthy food, exercise, sleep, and low stress. Find coffee habits that work for you and your healthy life. It is about your whole journey, not just one cup.

1l4wpob,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l4wpob,Meet Leonid,"Today is Leonid's birthday, so I decided to write down her bio.

Leonid is a nonbinary/transfem girl who can see spirits. 
Pronouns: they/she/he

Born in Russia, they were often ignored and bullied for being the weird kid. Her parents thought she was a disgrace for the family not only for not being ""a man"", but also because she claimed to see and speak to ghosts. Often alone, they found peace in music and skating 

When they were around 14 years old, he convinced his parents to let them enroll in an exchange program, and in Chile, her new family showed them love. His new sister, Arizona, became his best friend, not only did she believe them about being able to see spirits, but she showed interest in finding ways to repel evil spirits. Leonid made another friend, Haru. A haunted doll who at first hid from her, but soon found out that they mean no harm. The mom, Geraldina, even though often busy with work, found ways to make Leonid feel at home, enrolling him in piano and ice skating classes. 

By the end of the exchange student program, Leonid planned on escaping from the airport as to not go back to his parents, but ultimately told Geraldina the truth about how they were treated by them. 

After a legal process, Leonid got to stay in Chile with her new family, but a new problem appeared. Ariadna, a demon girl, claimed Leonid's soul was sold to her by their parents. Dealing with spirits bullying them was a normal thing for them, so at first, he tried ignoring her, but Ariadna was more violent and cruel than any other spirit she had encountered. 
Leonid at first isolated herself, at 16 they moved out to an apartment in the neighborhood as to not be a nuisance to everyone else. It took several visits from Arizona to come back to her senses and figure out it was worse being alone, Ariadna was shy around other people anyway. 
Leonid isn't alone anymore, Ariadna is still present, but they're finding ways to repelled her. 

Leonid is 18 years old, she works part time at a coffee shop and studies music. They're shy and soft spoken, easily scared, and don't like to be perceived by others, but have to face their fears if they want to be a successful musician and skater. She knows how to play piano, and now is learning to play the guitar. They like to cosplay with Arizona sometimes, and a few times they've agreed to do paranormal inventions with Arizona and Haru. 

Aside from seeing spirits, they can also send their own soul to a limbo-like place with the help of Haru. Since they're alive, in this world they're like a ghost, but it's a nice place to escape to sometimes. 

Leonid loves animals and his biggest dream is to have a dog, but is aware that he can't take care of one at the moment. 

And I think that's it for Leonid's bio, I'm not that good writing characters, so there's a lot I don't know how to answer, but if you have questions, feel free to ask in the comments ",13,1749227168.0,OriginalCharacter,18,1.0,False

1l4wp5l,https://www.reddit.com/r/deepnightsociety/comments/1l4wp5l/seven_deadly_lous/,Seven Deadly Lou’s,"At the shop this morning we had the regular faces. I was early for once. That's because we were working on my first job I had been assigned as a foreman.

Laz Healthcare was the hardest job I have encountered so far. It's not like I haven't had good help either. Turd was banned from the site the first hour he was there. Something about “wandering into the lab or some shit”. They said he was muttering and trying to break down the door. I had Lou pick him up immediately. Ever since I've had Zeke and Izzy. They're smart guys, but they're green. The whole job is to install some new bathrooms and the some acid piping for the new lab.

Bill told me the job should take 5 weeks. After looking at the plans, I figured I could get it done in 3. Oh how I was wrong. It was Friday on the third week and we weren't even close to making the 5 week deadline. I have a tailgate meeting every morning to discuss site safety and what jobs the boys and I will be doing today.

“Zeke, Izzy, come here. We’re making a game plan for today.”

“Lemme guess, drill more holes?” said Zeke

“Yea,” I responded exhaustedly.

“Tefucinhelaralltheezgonefer,” said Izzy

“The holes are for the piping Izzy. I'm trying to run it as fast as you’re drilling them. How many are we at Zeke?”

“313”

“How many do you have left abouts?”

“Teneac,” said Izzy

“Figure we can get those 20 done today?”

“We’d be pushing hard at that rate. It is about an hour a hole in some places.”

“Do the best you can.”

“Ferckinryin”

“I know Izzy, I was hoping to have the job completed this week.”

After that brief tailgate meeting, the boys had their jobs and I had mine. The day proceeded as normal. I went to where I was working and set my radio up. I go a bit crazy if I don't have something playing in the background on my jobsites. Today I was listening to these two guys yap away about scary stories they've read. I like these two. One is some kid from Appalachia, you know what they say about people from Appalachia, and the other is some old dude who's got a kickass neckbeard according to the kid. They spend hours yammering on about spooky shit. However, the noise they make helps me concentrate.

I continued working and at lunch break I asked the boys to give me a progress update.

“Zeke, how we doing?”

“Way we’re going today, we may just hit that deadline,” Zeke said enthusiastically.

“Gotreelef, ezegerttoo,” said Izzy.

“Make’s 5, we’ll see if we're lucky by the end of the day.”

We, in fact, we’re not lucky. Zeke did fine with his final 2 holes, Izzy however…

“FERCKINPICEOFERCKINSHIET!”

a sound of something heavy and expensive hitting a wall then proceeding to fall to the floor

“IZ! The fuck are you doing?” I shouted

“TISFERCKINOLESFERCKINWENTIFERVFERCKINFETTICK! TEFERCK, TELESTFERCKINOLE! FERCKTISFERCKINTUPIDFERCKINJHOB!”

“Walls only supposed to be a foot thick Izzy, did you mark it where it supposed to be on the plan? You could’ve hit a structural column?”

“UMERKDTEOLE! DONNTFERCKINAYEYEFERCKINRILLEDTEFERCKINOLE!”

“Well, I’ve been wrong before Izzy, I can be wrong again. Let’s go check on the plans and have a coffee,” I said calmly.

Izzy muttered under his breath angrily as we went to my makeshift on-site office.

“Look Izzy, there’s a column right next to where you’re drilling, guess it was just a little bigger than the plans said. I fucked up buddy, I’m sorry I tried to blame you.”

“Isnotyeristeferckinjhob, iferckinateferckinbeinher.”

“Do you hate your career? Buddy you’ve been doing this for 3 years with us. I thought you loved it?”

“Iontferckinateeingaferckinlumber, Iferckinatedisferckinjhob, isgivinmeighmars” said Izzy frustratedly.

“Yea, I hear you Izzy. It’s getting to me too. I’ve found myself waking up with a cold sweat or two about this job lately,” I said exhaustedly.

“Isyerirstjhobyergertnerosses,” said Izzy concernedly.

“Don’t remind me, I’ve wanted to call Bill, Bob or Lou and ask what the fuck to do on a few occasions,” I laughed.

“Disjhobiskillinus.”

Izzy’s comment hung in the air as we walked quietly to where Zeke was. He had heard the commotion Izzy had made and must’ve tidied things up while we were checking the plans.

“Well Zeke, thanks for cleaning up. I’ve gotta check that location I marked for Izzy. Seems like I fucked up.”

I checked the location of the hole.

“There’s not supposed to be a support here,” I said as Zeke looked into the hole.

“This sure looks like a support.”

“Well throw the last extension on the drill and we’ll see if Lou can talk his way outta repairing it if I'm wrong.”

Izzy did as I asked and almost immediately went through.

“Guess we are lucky today,” I said to the two.

Zeke looked into the final hole.

“Why’s it dark? Should be through to the other side, right?”

I walked into the room we were drilling into. The lights were on, but no hole.

“Where the hell is that going? Izzy can you push further into the hole?”

Izzy did as I asked.

“Asferasshellger,” said Izzy

He was in about four feet. The specs on the supports say they're solid all the way through and three feet thick.

“Zeke grab me a length of pipe.”

“Twelve foot piece or twenty-one?”

“Twenty-one.”

He brought the length over and I pushed into the hole. We were able to slide the entire length in. Puzzled, I stepped back to assess the situation.

“Pull the pipe out Zeke. I have a feeling we’ll have to drill a new hole.”

Zeke pulled the pipe, but it didn’t move. Suddenly the pipe jerked Zeke towards the hole. He let go and the pipe vanished.

“Teferck?” Said Izzy.

Astonished at what we’d just witnessed, I spoke up.

“We still need to go through that wall, I guess drill it lower?,” I said with a tone lacking confidence.

So Zeke mounted the drill back up and drilled another hole. Before I could get going on what I was working on, I heard Zeke shouting for me. I walked briskly back to where he was working. He was through, but we still had the same problem. There was a hole too somewhere but not where we needed to go. Finally, I had enough and grabbed my flashlight to take a look through the holes to see if I was missing something.

“What do you see up there boss,” said Zeke.

“It’s a massive room about 40ft deep by 60ft wide, it looks like a laboratory,” I said.

I thought in my head if we actually drilled through the labs walls but there’s no way I had, it was a hundred feet in the other direction and plus I’d seen the interior of that lab, it was completely different.

I shined my light through the hole to the centre of the room. It’s light reflected of 7 massive glass tank.

“Holy shit! It looks like a sci-fi movie. There’s tanks that look like you could float…,” I trailed off.

It was then I noticed there were things floating in the tanks. They’re were small, barely noticeable in the liquid filling the tanks. Only 4 of the tanks were full. 3 of them contained what looked to be masses of cells, though the 4th explained why the looked that way. It was a baby. It was curled in a ball. I thought it wasn’t developed enough but I noticed it was missing a hand.

Under all the tanks was a nameplate. It appeared the first empty three were:

L04WR

L04GR

L04EN

The last 4 were

L04GL

L04SL

L04LU

L04PR

It was the oddest scene. I couldn’t describe it to my apprentices, that’s why I told them to look.

“Guys you have to see this,” I said.

Both Izzy and Zeke climbed the ladder and looked into the holes.

Neither saw what I had.",3,1749227131.0,deepnightsociety,0,1.0,False
1l4wo49,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l4wo49,Looking for advice: Which Ninja Foodi Grill should I get? Confused by pricing and features,"Hey all! I'm a big steak lover, but the shared grills at my apartment are often taken, so I’m looking for something I can use inside my unit. I’ve been looking into the Ninja Foodi grills, but I’m confused about the differences between the models and why the pricing doesn’t seem to match the features.

Here are the three models I’m considering:

* **IG651 (7-in-1)** – around **$199**
* **DG551 (6-in-1)** – around **$299**
* **FG551 (6-in-1)** – around **$279**

So here’s where I’m confused: the 7-in-1 model is **over $100 cheaper** than both 6-in-1 options. Wouldn't the 7-in-1 technically be the better product since it offers more functions? It seems like a no-brainer to go with the IG651, but I’m wondering if I’m missing something important.

There aren’t many great comparison videos out there, so I’m hoping someone here can break down the key differences. Why is the IG651 cheaper despite having more functions? Is there a catch?

Any insight or experience with these models would be super helpful!",1,1749227064.0,steak,0,1.0,False
1l4wnc6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l4wnc6,Sierra couch #quince,"Here is my quince couch, a lot of people sent me messages about posting photos so here is my review.

We ordered the Sierra couch in the performance fabric, taupe velvet color and I couldn’t be happier with our purchase. It’s truly the perfect couch: incredibly comfortable, sturdy, and so well made.

One of the biggest reasons we chose this couch was because it’s not modular. These days, it feels like every couch on the market is modular with separate, disconnected pieces—which I personally can’t stand. I love the clean, cohesive design of the Sierra, especially the one long cushion per section. It gives the couch a streamlined, elevated look that’s hard to find.

We had been looking at a ton of designer brands like Crate & Barrel, RH, and 7th Avenue, but those options were massive and just didn’t work for the living room space in our condo. The Sierra is perfectly sized, beautiful, and fits exactly what I had been envisioning.

Another major selling point: the performance fabric comes included—no annoying add-ons or upgrades required. Before we committed, we tested the swatches by spilling Coke, tea, coffee, and even red wine on them, and they passed with flying colors. This fabric really holds up!

If you’re looking for a stylish, non-modular, space-conscious, and spill-resistant couch, I can’t recommend the Sierra sectional from Quince enough. We’re seriously obsessed.

1l4wkq2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1l4wkq2/my_motherinlaw_is_a_narcissistic_liar/,My mother-in-law is a narcissistic liar!,"First – if you are reading this, I love you Charlotte! Your spirit and wit are what keeps me watching.  You are both hilarious AND level-headed.  Your advice/observations are usually spot on with mine!

Now for the story…my mother-in-law can put all other mother-ion-laws to shame.  We are all pretty sure she has narcissistic personality disorder… Well, I guess she puts herself to shame.  –in my best Charlotte voice “HOW ARE YOU NOT EMBARASSED?!?!”

The main story starts in January 2023, but I think this requires a lot of background.  I would apologize for the long post, but I know Charlotte loves the long, juicy, stories lol

Background – I have been with my husband for 25 years.  We have a college aged daughter.  My husband has 2 much older siblings, one brother and one sister who have each been married to their spouses for 40-ish years and have multiple grandchildren each.  (I am clearly not Charlotte’s normal demographic lol). 

There were always a TON of big family gatherings (think big Italian family stuff)… holiday = party at grandmas, Confirmation = party at grandmas, birthday = party at grandmas, paid off a loan = party at grandmas…you get it.  She also insisted that THE day was THE day…so in-laws families have to be ok with doing holidays on different days…Thanksgiving is the only exception because she hates to cook.  She wants to decorate and plan games (literally toddler games, which are fun when we have toddlers…but many years we did not).

We are 2 hours away, the sisters family is 2 hours in the other direction, and the brother lived nearby with his family until about 2009 when his job took him across the country.  His adult children remained in the area.  He moved back during COVID.  We were there a minimum of monthly, as was the sister.  The brother still several times a year even when he had moved across the country.  At the end of each of these gatherings SOMEONE would get “a letter”, which eventually became an email or a text.  It WOULD be in writing, and you WOULD address every point made about how you did not notice or compliment her decorations or something new in her house OR how you didn’t say thank you enough.  Literally not that you didn’t say Thank You, but you only said it twice or you only said 4 things you were thankful for, not the 5^(th) thing…it was ridiculous.

To be fair to my husband, the first time I met his parents he said, “just to warn you, my mom is a nut.” As soon as we left that dinner, I said “I don’t know what you’re talking about, your mom was great” to which he said, “I just want to be on record that I warned you.” He still references that conversation lol

She does things she is specifically told NOT to do simply because she was told not to do them…for instance, our wedding.  She asked what color dress she should wear.  I said I really didn’t care (we did a black and white theme, so all colors work).  I then said you probably don’t want to wear a darker red or green because of the coloring in the space.  We got married in an old Masion, so there was a lot of dark wood and deep red/green carpeting.  She wore burgundy.  Not my problem that she LITERALLY blended into the carpet, which I heard about for YEARS after the fact.  It was ALL my fault, after all.  She has been banned from 2 different drug stores for her aggressive nature with the pharmacy.  She is just an awful human, not just an awful mother-in-law.

Now to the story…January 2023 we had all stood firm on NOT having Christmas at HER house on 12/25 since about 2017 because there are now great-grandkids and too many OTHER families involved for everyone to coordinate for THAT day.  We settled on we would all do our own things at our own houses and gather on a different date.  She hated it and we heard about it A LOT.  So we gather…except our one nephew (brother son) who told her all along that he was on call that day and then called her to tell her he was called in, so would not make it.  His new-ish girlfriend didn’t come either because she had never met half of the family and didn’t want to be there without him.  Made perfect sense to the rest of us.  She, however, started in on my sister-in-law about how they won’t get their gifts until they come to her house and how ridiculous it is to not show up when she spent money, blah, blah, blah.  Sister-in-law told her to keep them, and it is ridiculous that she would feel that way about his JOB.  She is then speaking to our daughter (still in high school at the time) about her American Sign Language class.  She wants her to stand up in front of the whole family and sign a song that she did in class.  Our daughter told her she really didn’t want to do that.  Grandma proceeds to insist on and off for HOURS.  My daughter, standing next to me (and in front of father-in-law) signs to her grandma “I really don’t want to” while saying it out loud.  Grandma says “How about yes” while flinging her hangs around mocking sign language and ending with a DOUBLE BIRD right in my child’s face!  My father-in-law (sweetest man on earth) immediately yelled her full name (she goes by a nickname) then says, “This is a family event and that is your granddaughter”.  I saw RED!  However, I’m southern and the whole respect your elders kept my mouth shut…I did go straight to my husband, and he shrugged it off.  Mother-in-law then put her sights back on sister-in-law.  They proceeded to have a screaming match in the front yard as we were getting into our cars.  Nothing more came of that day…

Now in March, another nephew (sisters son) is having his son baptized.  The priest starts with “Will the parents and god parents please come forward” after which Mother-in-law yells from her pew “What about great-grandparents??”  sisters shushed her and whispers “mom, you know its just the parents and god parents at a baptism”.  To which mother-in-law yells again “but I’m the only great-grandparent”.  (Side note: father-in-law is stepdad to all 3, but the only dad my husband has ever known and the only grandfather/great-grandfather any of the kids have ever known.  As of writing this they have been married for 49 years. ) nephew was very upset by this, but let it go for the day and called her about a week later.  She has denied ever doing this TO THIS DAY no matter how many people confirm they were there and witnessed it with their own eyes and ears.  It got to the point where she called nephews wife a liar and told him to “be a man and fix his house”.  It got VERY heated and sisters ENTIRE family eventually blocked mother-in-law. 

Now in April, niece (brothers daughter) announces she is pregnant with baby #2.  Not married yet and not dad of baby #1.  Mother-in-law asks the boyfriend not once, not twice, but THREE TIMES if he is sure its his…yes, you read that correctly…she asked the baby-daddy of her GRANDDAUGHTER if her granddaughter might be ‘getting around’…  She also cannot remember the name of baby-daddy.  She constantly refers to him as “whats his name” or “who’s it”.  Literally in text “Is whats his name coming to dinner with you?”  Literally one of the easiest, most common, short, names on earth!!! By the end of this fiasco, brothers ENTIRE family eventually blocks mother-in-law.  To the point that our pregnant niece told her that she would talk to her after the first of the year (her baby was due in October, so it was made clear that she was not invited to baby shower or to see the baby once born – they live in the same neighborhood). 

Over the next year there are short stints where brother and sister unblock her for periods of time and try to mend the relationship.  She says and does things that send her back to time-out.  Meanwhile my husband is IT…the only one.  Our daughter and I both refuse to go to her house.  She is welcome here, but there is one very simple, yet specific, rule.  If she does not follow the rule, she must leave.  It is very simple – If ANYONE feels unwelcome in my house because of something she says or does she is out.  That includes us and our friends.  As I mentioned earlier, she never wanted to host Thanksgiving, so I have ALWAYS hosted a big Thanksgiving, and we invite anyone and everyone.  One year we had over 60 people at our house.  We made 3 turkeys and 2 hams with a bunch of sides and each family brought a side to share…it was fabulous!  They are much smaller most years, hovering around 10-15 people.  In the past she HAS done things to make people uncomfortable, and we have ignored it.  They came for Thanksgiving 2023, as they have for 20+ years prior.  She did well on Thanksgiving with all of our friends.  The next day, however, I ended up yelling at her twice.  I have NEVER raised my voice at her before.  She had a temper tantrum in a car wash waiting room (we had been out shopping and stopped so she could buy our daughter a gift card for Christmas) because she found out we were going on vacation with friends and did not invite her.  She started in on my father-in-laws character, which I was NOT having. 

Another back story – as long as I have known them, she has been nothing but rude and disrespectful to my father-in-law. She has said behind his back AND to his face that he is a lazy a$%, piece of Sh%&, son of a B\*&\^ that she only keeps around so he will drive her places and pay for everything.  They have had separate bedrooms the majority of their marriage.  I lost my father 6 months after we were married and my mother 10 years later.  Over the years since I have lost so much respect and patience for her.  She is so ungrateful for all that she has in this world and wastes so much time being negative. 

Back to the car wash…I swiftly stood up at one point during her rant and I said, “I am not going to sit here and listen to her talk bad about {name}…he is a wonderful man and puts up with your bulls%$\^!”  A man in the waiting room nodded at me as I walked past and said, “good for you”.  I was already mortified because I was not raised to talk to ANYONE like that, much less my mother-in-law, but it made me feel a bit better knowing that he had zero background and still saw it as necessary.  I immediately went outside to call my husband and let him know he might need to come get her if she wouldn’t get in the car with me after.  She ended up getting into the car with me for the drive home.  We did not speak.  Later that evening we went to a dinner theater for a Christmas program.  I had bought the tickets a full year earlier and we were so excited to go.  Not 2 minutes into the play starting (after we had been there for over an hour eating dinner and talking), she starts in on my father-in-law.  NOT quietly.  She is cussing at him about the way he is sitting.  I turned around and whisper-yelled through clenched teeth “STOP IT!” to her.  My husband still says he has never heard that deep, growling tone of voice come out of me lol.  She immediately stopped and the night AND weekend went on.  For Christmas, no one was speaking to her except my husband.  My daughter and I refused to go to the house, so we drove ALL the way down to meet them at a restaurant on Christmas Day.  We let our daughter decide since it was Christmas of her senior year I high school if she wanted to spend the day in the car or spend a few days with them at our house.  She chose the car and said it was only for her grandfather. 

The next year went much the same with no major issues.  One incident was at our daughters graduation party (our house) she started hanging items and pictures all over the house of HERSELF to be sure everyone knew who the grandmother was.  I never said a word to her or my husband about it.  I didn’t have to.  He took everything down and told her it was not about her…Love that man!

Now the final straw…

As I mentioned, she has always been very aggressive and disrespectful (verbally) with father-in-law.  Well, we woke up one morning to a text from mother-in-law.  It is a video.  Really, its just audio as the camera (her phone) was clearly sitting face down on the table.  The audio is a conversation between her and a police officer who has just arrested my 85-year-old father-in-law for domestic abuse.  My husband then spent the entire day trying to figure out how to bail him out.  Sad fact – when he stepped in front of the judge, he had no memory of being arrested.  It quickly became clear to us that he was having memory issues that they had been hiding from all of us.  My husband got him out of jail, luckily no bail money was due since he had no previous record and was clearly in distress mentally.  He spent a couple of weeks with my husbands brother because he had doctors appointments and his arraignment.  My husband went down twice during that time.  He then came to stay with us and has been here ever since.  My mother-in-law has flipped back and forth between “I miss him, I want him to come home” and “I’m meeting with a divorce lawyer”.  Sometimes literally in the same breath.  She admitted to my husband in front of her priest that she would rather see him in jail than staying with us.  She only wanted him home so he could do his chores.  She went as far as to send a list of chores.  The list included filling the paper towel holder, minor caulking, and pushing the grocery cart, among cooking, cleaning, and all outside chores.  She had a list of her own chores which was a fraction of this and included putting groceries away and laundry.  Everything else she did was plan things for him.  She went as far as dropping the charges so that he would come home.  We are certain that she wants him home so that she can call the police and have him arrested again.  As a perceived repeat offender, he would likely die in jail.

The story we have pieced together of what happened that day…she had shoulder replacement surgery 6 months ago.  The bill arrived, but their secondary policy had not paid its portion yet.  He handles the bills and was working on it.  She asked him about it that day.  To which there were heated words exchanged. (this is where her story is that he immediately started hitting her and that he has been beating her for over a year now).  His story picks up here - Later that evening he was sitting in one of the bedrooms watching TV as he did every day.  She was lying on the couch across the house also watching TV as she also did every day.  He said she started yelling insults, cussing, etc.  So he walked into the room to see what happened.  He just observed for a minute out of her line of site…then said, “What is wrong with you?” to which he said she moved like he has never seen her move before.  She jumped OVER The coffee table and attached him…arms flying like windmills.  He blocked her blows and looked under his arms to eventually grab her wrists.  He said he held her arms firmly until she stopped fighting him.  Then he let go while also stepping backwards away from her, left the room and locked himself in his bedroom.   A few hours later he was woken up by the police there to arrest him.  She had a cut on her arm.  When my husband got him the next day he was covered in bruises on both arms and the top of his head.  The cut on her arm was old.  She had actually sent my husband pictures of it multiple times AND gone to see a doctor about why it wasn’t healing.  The entire family knows without a doubt that SHE is the aggressive one and there is no way she has ever been nor will she ever be a victim to anyone.  And since when does abuse begin in the 48^(th) year of marriage?!

We are getting my father-in-law set up with doctors here to address his very minor existing issues (all due to age) and his clearly advanced memory issue.  He is so much happier and lighter MOST of the time. He has said that he hates that he worked so hard for so many years to get to this point. 

Our daughter came home from college and said he smiles more than she remembers.
