On the surface, it looks like they‚Äôre bringing a cosmopolitan edge to the town, think craft beer bars, art galleries, and vegan cafes... but scratch the surface, and something‚Äôs missing.

A lot of these people aren‚Äôt really ""Londoners"" in the way you‚Äôd think. Many grew up in small, predominantly white towns before moving to London, and now they‚Äôre heading to Margate, bringing with them a very narrow cultural framework. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre playing at urban sophistication, but their ideas of ""cool"" often feel dated or shallow.

What‚Äôs striking is how poorly equipped many of them are to engage in an international or multicultural context. Margate has the potential to become a vibrant, diverse place, but instead, the influx of DFLs often reinforces the same kind of provincialism they claim to have left behind. It‚Äôs all very white British, with a thin mask of urbanity that doesn‚Äôt really hold up under closer inspection.

The result? Margate ends up feeling like a strange mix of gentrification and cultural stagnation. There‚Äôs an artsy vibe, sure, but it‚Äôs not exactly cutting-edge (save for Tracie's circle), and it doesn‚Äôt seem to embrace much beyond a narrow, self-referential bubble. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôve brought London‚Äôs coffee shops but left behind its actual diversity and cultural depth.

It‚Äôs not to say Margate isn‚Äôt changing‚Äîclearly it is... but it feels like it‚Äôs stuck somewhere between trying to be cosmopolitan and staying provincial. If anything, it highlights how gentrification can sometimes bring more shallow change than real cultural growth.

The difference between the locals and the DF""L""s is that the locals never left, the new comers just moved from one provincial town to the next via London and think they are better üëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëè Please come down you pedestals, it's sad and embarrasing. And bring your old folk, they'll really feel at home here, at the greasy spoon.

I'm home from college for the holidays, and I'm having a rough time. I'm realizing how many rules my parents have that feel so unfair and stressful. 

Some of these rules include:
1. No eating anywhere near dinner and if I am caught eating I will be scolded (we have dinner at 7, but this rule means 3pm onward).
2. No making noise after 8:30pm, even for good reason. That also means no showering.
3. All chores must be done as soon as I wake up. So, forego eating breakfast or having coffee or washing up at all.
4. Door must be open when I have my boyfriend over. He's 22 almost 23.
5. They have me on life360 and if I'm going to be home later than 10 I have to tell them otherwise I will get a bunch of calls and texts.

They also both have very short fuses. When I'm asked to do something (many, many, many times a day for all sorts of tasks that they would rather I be doing), they dont start it off by communicating with me like an adult. No matter what I'm doing, even if I'm trying to eat, trying to shower, if my friends are over, what have you - they will constantly have me doing tasks. I have to scoop the cat litter and walk the dog and do the dishes and clean the house all while entertaining guests, so I don't have guests over. Also, they start off already mad that I haven't done whatever it is BEFORE they ask. Or they just blow up at me for random things, especially my dad, he can go from 0-100 so quickly.
Nevermind a lifetime of him yelling at me, and saying awful things about me. I can hear my parents talking bad about me while I'm in the house. It's awful. I'm a nice kid I think, I'm a straight A student, I don't do anything bad I don't know what they want from me. 

A lifetime of this has made me walk around my house insanely dissociated. It's the feeling of walking into a room and forgetting why you were there - but for the entirety of my ""break"" here. I didn't realize it was this bad until I left for college, and now that I'm back it's shocking that I used to operate like this for years. I'm so tired of this.

Advice for next time?,"So, my third brew, first two were fine. Seemed easy enough, a bit less honey than the first two because they were too sweet (3lb in a 1 gallon carboy), and I filled the rest of the space with americano, brewed from my espresso machine in 40g coffee/80g water increments. Amounted to about eight brewed americanos to fill the rest of the space. 5g of Safale US-5 yeast, and like a teaspoon of dap and fermaid-O spaced out over three days.

Took a few days to for noticeable fermentation to start (cold weather?), but before long it was bubbling away, and two weeks later it was at a gravity of 1.020. I still wanted it a bit sweet, so I racked it and added a Campden tablet. Which puts the alcohol at 12.09%

And‚Ä¶it tastes foul? I‚Äôm not even going to bottle it. I tried back-sweetening, and now it just tastes sweet and foul. It tastes like strong, old, coffee, and smells worse, with just enough of an alcohol flavor added to make it trip that ‚Äúthis might be poison‚Äù sensor in my brain.

My first brain thought is, ‚ÄúYou tried brewing mead coffee instead of coffee mead. You should be making mead, and give it a little flavoring of something else, but this was way too much.‚Äù But I don‚Äôt know. Did I go too hard on the coffee?

I followed the recipe [as reproduced from the Fandom wiki.](https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Codex_entry:_Nevarran_Hazelnut_Torte) 

I'm happy to report that it does indeed work in real life! My only notes are: 

- you'll need to add about a half cup of water to the yolk/hazelnut mixture. It won't easily accept the flour without it (and the batter might get overworked/you might overdevelop the gluten), and there's absolutely no way you can fold in the egg whites without the mixture being looser. Just a half cup of cold water will do it. 


- I'm nervous to butter a cake pan when egg white is the leavener, because usually you'd want it to climb the walls of the tin and stay there or else it might not rise properly. So I didn't and I only put parchment paper on the bottom, and the cakes themselves turned out just fine.


- don't skip the apricot liqueur, it's delightful.


- make 1.5-2x the recipe amount of the ganache/icing or you won't have enough. Don't be afraid to use a little extra cream and keep the room/icing relatively warm, or else it might start setting and get hard to work with. One tablespoon each of orange liquor and coffee were perfect.


It's not my prettiest work because I just wanted to test the recipe as written, and so I ran out of ganache. (I did add the water like I said above, or else there was no way this was gonna work!)
But otherwise, Emmrich's mother had a good recipe. And if you need a break from saving Thedas, give this one a shot.

How do I exactly do it?,"I am unsure if I am searching in the wrong places or not but, I have been trying to run this model ""Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct"" from happy face. Im kinda new to everything and would like some guidance. My goal is to have a python project where I have Ai specifically look at only a certain area of a image based pdf and extract the hand written text, the other programs like tesseract are really bad at understanding handwritten text. 

Someone else in the community asked for the best OCR for handwriting and the AI model I mention above was recommended since it was able to read really bad hand writing like the one attached. I downloaded openwebui and ran some llama models like ""llama3.2-vision"" which were able to OCR pretty well, the problem is that it is a 11b model that wont work for where I am trying to use the program due to the system having older components. The Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct model is 7b which might be able to run at where I am trying to run it but I need to test it first. The ollama model was easy to download on openwebui but I don't know how to download a happyface model on it, so instead I got LM studio which lets you download happy face models but the problem is when I run it I get this error ""\`\`\` Failed to load the model Error loading model. (Exit code: 0). Some model operation failed. Try a different model and/or config.\`\`\`"" 

I'm thinking the next best way to use the model is by using it in python which I don't know how to do but will eventually will need to learn if I want to create the project. Looking online there is hardly any simple information on how to do this. Can someone guide me in the right direction?

1hlpwqc,https://www.reddit.com/r/TRUE_Neville_Goddard/comments/1hlpwqc/how_to_distinguish_between_surface_belief_and/,How to distinguish between surface belief and subconscious belief,"The question is often asked, ‚Äúhow do I know what my real belief is?‚Äù This will be another longer post because the issue is really a crucial one. The difference between surface belief and conscious belief is the difference between a successful manifestation and a failed one. That would not be a tragedy if you understood the cause of your failure, because nobody wins them all, but very often when failure occurs despite surface belief (which you confuse with real belief) you will end up doubting the law or doubting yourself. I‚Äôve seen many people abandon this thing completely after saying ‚ÄúI know I believed and lived in the end but it didn‚Äôt work.‚Äù It didn‚Äôt work because that wasn‚Äôt real belief to begin with.

You know how a cult works, yes? You‚Äôre promised things if you become a follower and if you don‚Äôt receive what you were promised you are told ‚Äúit‚Äôs because you didn‚Äôt have enough faith.‚Äù That‚Äôs a tricky thing and many cults are scams because faith is not something you can measure or evaluate directly. However, this is not what I‚Äôm talking about here. Here I‚Äôm talking about something a lot more scientific and concrete, something you can evaluate on your own. Let me explain how it works. First of all, what grants your wish and what‚Äôs behind it all? The Chinese called it the Tao, the Indians called it the Self, Paul called it the Christ, Neville called it Imagination, and modern psychology called it Subconscious. They‚Äôre all interchangeable terms, because they refer to the same entity. Neville himself said ‚ÄúWhen I use the words Lord, God, Jehovah, Jesus, Christ, I AM, Imagination, to me they are synonymous and interchangeable.‚Äù

If the Subconscious (actually the Superconscious, through the medium of your Subconscious) grants your wish, it means the subconscious needs to learn about it first. Scientific experiments in hypnotism and later psychoanalysis have revealed a few crucial things about the subconscious mind: 1. It does not reason and accepts any proposition as true. 2 It is amenable to suggestion. 3. It controls the functions of your body. Students of metaphysics have added another one, 4. It controls and helps produce all the circumstances in your life. It was also established that the subconscious mind only works with fixed convictions, precisely because it is unable to reason or to make executive decisions on your behalf. It has no initiative and only responds to your requests through the medium of intuition, inspiration, impulses and hunches. As Florence Scovel Shinn put it ‚Äúprayer is telephoning to God and intuition is God telephoning to you.‚Äù

Your convictions have to be firm and need to be held with consistency. Desire ‚Äì Hope ‚Äì Belief ‚Äì Conviction is the sequence and only the last link on this chain reaches your Subconscious, the Conviction. That‚Äôs why hoping and wishing bring you nothing. Belief is a step above, but still insufficient. Hope implies doubt and belief is something that can change at a moment‚Äôs notice. ‚ÄúA conviction is not a conviction if it can be shaken,‚Äù said Neville in *Your Faith Is Your Fortune*. If today it is Tuesday, I‚Äôm convinced that tomorrow is Wednesday. What could possibly shake that conviction? This needs to be your mindset when say about the Law: If I know that what I imagined is real, what could possibly shake my conviction?

¬†

How can you tell what your subconscious believes? Let‚Äôs say you have a major bill to pay in two months. You start ‚Äúmanifesting‚Äù with routines, techniques, and you watch a million YouTube videos. After a week you say ‚ÄúI believe.‚Äù But do you really believe or is it just wishful thinking? When we want something to happen we often deceive ourselves. Read the posts on Reddit; the place is full of people who think they are in Sabbath when they‚Äôre clearly not.

¬†

In his first book, *At Your Command* (1939), Neville said on this subject:

*‚ÄúWe must constantly practice self-observation, thinking from our aim and detachment from negative moods and thoughts if we would be doers of truth instead of mere hearers.‚Äù*

In an important series of lectures from 1952 Neville added the following:

*‚ÄúIf, today, you would spend five minutes in uncritical observation of yourself, you will discover that you are not as truthful, honest, or courageous as you thought you were‚Äù* (‚ÄúYour Infinite Worth,‚Äù 1952).

*‚ÄúIn the beginning you may not succeed, but don‚Äôt condemn yourself. Simply return as many times as necessary until the feeling becomes so strong, your thoughts habitually flow from the new state‚Äù* (‚ÄúThe Perfect Will of God,‚Äù 1952).

*‚ÄúKnowing your desire, persist in the thought that you already have it until your thoughts become habitual. If you do not, you will find yourself returning to your old way of thinking and perpetuate it, thereby never seeing your desire externalize itself‚Äù* (‚ÄúThe Human Spirit,‚Äù 1952).

¬†

Let me explain how you distinguish between surface belief and subconscious belief in the most practical way. Let‚Äôs return to our hypothetical situation, where you have a large bill to pay in two months. You‚Äôre doing some routines already and you think you are ‚Äúliving in the end.‚Äù To see if this is true you must first observe your thoughts. It is crucial what you observe yourself when you‚Äôre in a neutral emotional state and your conscious thoughts are not directed deliberately towards your financial situation. So if you just got a phone call that upset you and you‚Äôre thinking negatively about that bill, that says nothing reliable about your subconscious belief. However, if on a normal day, nothing special going on, you‚Äôre peeling potatoes in the kitchen and you catch yourself thinking about that bill, how are you thinking about it? Is it the voice of failure or is it the voice of the wish fulfilled? Make a note. Next morning, you‚Äôre on the toilet and suddenly you catch yourself thinking about that bill. How are you thinking about it? Next day, you‚Äôre in line at the post office and it‚Äôs boring and suddenly you realize your thoughts moved to that bill. How are you thinking about it? Compare the three episodes, because they reflect your real, subconscious belief on the issue of the bill. **You can lay it down as a rule that automatic thinking from a neutral emotional state reveals your true belief on a subject.**

I cannot emphasize too much the significance of the previous sentence. It‚Äôs the key to solving your confusion. I don‚Äôt know about you, but what made me frustrated the most when I first started was the fact that I couldn‚Äôt tell what the fuck I was doing wrong and what‚Äôs stopping the damn manifestation from materializing. So I started to work on figuring it out. Through study and experimentation, I arrived at the conclusion stated above. So first learn to observe yourself, to become aware of your thoughts (mindfulness meditation helps with this). Then evaluate those thoughts. The following scenarios are possible and I will explain what to do in those cases.

1.Your thinking indicates worry, doubt, pessimism, resentment and other negative feelings. Not a problem, don‚Äôt be frustrated or disappointed with yourself. Science has shown that 80% of human thoughts are negative. So it‚Äôs an uphill climb. Neville actually talks about it and gives good advice:

*‚ÄúThe minute you become aware that you‚Äôre carrying on these negative conversations, stop it, and come back without any conversation with self, no condemnation of self, no justification of what you did, don‚Äôt do it, and come back to the new man‚Äù* (‚ÄúInner Talking,‚Äù 1965).

So you think about your bill and you visualize negative scenarios? Once you catch yourself doing it, interrupt the thought or the image, just turn your back on it and replace it with your usual mental scene or affirmation that indicates that the bill is fully paid. If ten minutes later you catch yourself in a negative state, repeat the procedure. If a hundred times in a day you catch yourself, repeat the procedure without any self-criticism, any feeling of impatience, without any loss of self-respect. I remember on issues that made me angry I would then and there imagine what I wanted through the anger until I calmed down. It still worked although you‚Äôre told not to imagine what you want when you‚Äôre upset. It actually works better for me if I‚Äôm angry and you can read why in this POST. My subconscious accepts it faster that way because I‚Äôm able to re-channel the intense emotional state I‚Äôm in. When powerful emotions are joined with strong determination, the gates of your subconscious will open a lot faster. In any case, strong emotions or no, the point is to stop the negative thought and replace it. I guarantee that if you do that with discipline and dedication you will eventually change that subconscious belief.

2. Your thinking indicates mixed states. One time it was positive but twice it was negative. That‚Äôs a good sign. It means that you have made some progress or it means that your subconscious does not have a lot of resistance to your wish. That‚Äôs what happens when we easily manifest free coffee or seeing a yellow sports car on the highway. The subconscious doesn‚Äôt oppose the notion. What you need to do is basically follow the routine explained in point one above until all automatic negative thinking stops.

3. All your automatic, spontaneous thinking regarding the bill you have to pay reflects the state of the wish fulfilled. If you get a phone call and you‚Äôre upset and curse the financial world and the banks and capitalism itself, but in the evening while taking out the trash you catch yourself thinking about the wish fulfilled, no harm was done. That‚Äôs why people sometimes say ‚ÄúI worried about the exam and still succeeded.‚Äù It‚Äôs because the worry was surface belief, or some emotional disturbance, but subconsciously you most definitely believed in success. If day after day you always find yourself thinking from the wish fulfilled you‚Äôre in Sabbath. Now your wish is in line for fulfillment. All subconscious beliefs are externalized.

In conclusion, what matters is your habitual state as reflected by your subconscious beliefs. Your automatic mental conversations are the voice of your subconscious beliefs. If they speak about the failure of your goal, you must tell your subconscious a different story until it accepts it and adopts it as the real one. Please note that deep subconscious beliefs caused by trauma, inferiority complexes, chronic resentment, or self-hate may not be easily replaced and a lot of separate work needs to be done to address the underlying causes. Always remember that the mind is a complex mechanism. I dislike the phrase, but you really need a ‚Äúholistic approach‚Äù and a good understanding of your mind in all its aspects. Stay with it and you will succeed.

1hlpuvp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hlpuvp/life_is_hard_as_a_disabled_person_in_america/,Life is hard as a disabled person in America ,"Trigger Warning: self harm and ideations

I want to start off by saying I'm posting from a throwaway because I don't want my family to come across this. 

I am 34 (F) and I have been in a wheelchair since I was about 6 or 7 due to a muscle condition that I have. I had surgery around that time and I lost the ability to walk because I did not use my muscles. My disease, if I do not use the muscle, it wastes away muscle and I can't get it back.

Being an adult, I want adult things in life. I want to be in a relationship, get married, have kids (natural or adoption). I have never been allowed to go on dates. Yes I say allowed because since I need help (and I can't afford to live on my own and pay someone to help me) I have to live with my family and live by their rules. Their rules are no dating. I have no other family in the US other than the family I live with. The family I do have (aunts, grandparents, cousins) want nothing to do with us. 

A few months ago, they found out I was talking to a guy and flipped out. I mean flipped straight out. They call him names for talking to a disabled person (they think he's a pervert for wanting to be with someone disabled) and they call me names (names like bitch, whore, etc. just a lot of filthy names). What's worse is that they took screenshots of my conversations and I don't know how much they have. I have said some things in conversation with him but like who doesn't when they flirt? I'm not mentally delayed. I have 2 Master's degrees (and I'm working on a third). I'm really smart, it's just that I'm weak that I can't help myself. Well, I don't know if I'm smart now because my mental health is declining. He likes me for me and my brains, not what what I can/can't do with my body. I told him straight away (since we met online on a mutual interest group) that I cannot walk and use a wheelchair. I have told him how weak I am, and he's fine with that. He's super smart too. And we did video chat a few times when I'm alone because my family would break my laptop if they knew I was talking to him via video. They did once before about 10 years ago. They threw my laptop at the wall and it shattered to pieces. I had to lie to some IT people in my university because I didn't know how to take apart a computer to get the hard drive. I had to buy a new computer too. 

Since my family found out about this guy, my life has been hell. I have attempted to take my life by cutting myself. I failed because I was to weak to cause any harm. I've wanted to take poison or overdose on medication just to end my life. But stupid me reads on what happens if these methods fail and I think about how my life would be worse. I've run away from home 4 times already. I even went into a park area where there are huge cliffs and I was going to drive my wheelchair off the cliff and fall into the depths where I know I would be knocked out by the jagged rocks and no one will find me for days. But my brain wouldn't let me do it. I got to the edge and my arms wouldn't push my chair forward. I broke down crying for not being able to do it. 

And these feelings are not just because of words that are said to me. I am also physically abused. I am slapped, hit, choked, gagged when I try to yell for help. When I try to defend myself with my wheelchair, I end up causing bruising on them and they blame me for being a terrorist against them. I was just defending myself as much as I could. I have had a sprained thumb where my finger swelled up and bruised and I could not move it.

I tried contacting my old doctor for help. They told me to call Adult Protective Services. I called them. They said they can't help me unless I have Medicaid because I can't afford to pay someone to help me. I don't make enough money for rent let alone paying for help. I don't qualify for Medicaid because I make too much money. I don't qualify for disability either because I can work. It's going to cost me at least $170-$180k per year to just have someone help me 8-12 hours per day. That doesn't include rent, food, utilities or anything else. And insurance does not cover this. Medicaid and Medicare do, but I don't qualify because I make too much money ($45k per year) and I am not disabled enough because I am educated and I have had a job since high school. Me, a person who can barely care for themselves without the help of someone is not disabled enough because I can hold down a job and get educated. 

I have no friends. I have no family. The guy I was talking to can't even help me. I wish he could save me but he can't. I called the police. They told me I'm an adult and I can leave. But who can help me when I do leave? The times I did run away I had to go begging to come home because I needed help with the bathroom. I don't want to sit in my own feces. I called lawyers. Both disability and criminal lawyers (but let's face it, I won't press charges because I need my family to help me).

I also deal with their constant narcism and ""I'm better than anyone else"" attitude. They are racist and homophobic. I told them I was bi and they mocked me. I keep quiet to myself because everything is used against me but I am yelled at when I am quiet. I work from home and I am stuck with them 24/7. I have no escape, other than the times I did escape. Even today, they stand over my shoulder, looking at my screen, recording what I do. I am questioned about who I'm talking to on Teams chat at work. I'm accused of using my work computer to talk explicitly with men. Not only that, but married men. It's completely crazy! 

I feel like I just want my life to end. I can't handle it anymore. Everyday I dread having to wake up. I hate having to live in hell. I am scared to eat or drink because I would need their help. But if I do not eat or drink, I am yelled at. I want to just wake up happy and in peace. I want love in my life. I want to be happy. I want to live in Europe and go to coffee shops. I can qualify for Citizemship to an EU country (Croatia) through Article 16 because I have family that is from there, but they open my mail too so I'd never get anything. I can't even go to the post office to open my own PO box to get my mail. If I had an EU passport I can move where I want easily and I know Europe has cheaper healthcare. I was thinking about the Netherlands because I love everything about that country. I have enough money saved to open my own business but if I don't start making money right away, I'm going to be screwed! I even started learning Dutch (but I get yelled at by family about that). But if I have to end up in Croatia, fine. 

I'm smart. I'm educated. I deserve happiness. I can figure everything else out in my life, but I can't figure this out. I don't know what to do anymore. Am I stuck living in hell for the rest of my life? It is so hard for regular people to live in America. It's especially hard for the disabled who can't get any help. I need some advice on what to do because I can't handle this anymore. I want to stop crying and thinking about my life ending. I want to live, I don't want to die. Otherwise all my attempts would have worked but something keeps stopping from actually going through with anything.

I'm trying to remember back as to why I decided to choose this username, but I guess it was thought of out of boredom lol... Imagine if this was my real name.¬† I'm sure would be super annoying to write out on exams over and over and the teachers would have gotten a heart attack. At least people wouldn't butcher it like how they tend to do with my real name. We've all had that one teacher, right? If not, I'm sure a coffee shop like Starbucks comes up with a creative way to make that happen when writing our name on the cup.

Either way, I'm a 28 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one friend that will join us on our journey through life - someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had difficult luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in the real, genuine friendship and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in putting in the effort to make things work or might easily jump to someone else :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of making a new, long term friend, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring friend. A friend that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in a best friend. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is really wanting to be buddies with a dude named BlueExodia0.

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about¬†¬†
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Very single at the moment (not something I'm pushing for but if if there happens to be a connection, seeing that develop is something I'm not against)
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

**What qualities do I look for in a friend?**

* Is a human and breathing üòÇ
* **An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)**

I usually cook throughout the week but this was a lot for me. All day today he has been gaming at his computer and has barely acknowledged me. He was also drinking since around 1pm. I also had a couple drinks so i may have been building things up in my head. Not sure. Around 6 I got increasingly upset that I've been working all day and he's barely talked to me. Maybe I didn't express it well, but i basically said I feel under appreciated and would like him to acknowledge all the effort I've been putting in and say thank you. He got upset and said I make him feel like a pos. He also said I'm the one who decided to do all this stuff and he didn't ask me to. I said if I don't do it who will (he doesn't cook)? He got mad and said ""thanks for ruining dinner"" and slammed the top of our raised coffee table down, spilling wine all over the rug and stormed upstairs. He is still up there.

What do I see? white flakes in the air.

What do I see?
What do I see? what do I see? I can't believe my eyes.
What do I see? these children are happy
What do I see? in every corner these creatures have a laugh hello smile goodbye sigh
But what is this madness I'm moving
What do I see?
Instead of throwing bodies they throw snowballs.
Life replaces death they spend their time on rides
I see all the colors I discover the sun.
And its warmth in my old heart really does wonders
Oh no what do I see? they kiss under the mistletoe.
They laugh but these people are unique
Magical, here they are gathered in front of the fireplace to read a fairy tale
What do I see?
What do I see of the dwarves? all around a tree.
Well, what does that mean?
It's crazy, they covered it with thousands of utensils, lamps hanging on wires.
And they're all having fun at the same time. I might be wrong, but I think it's joy, it's joy, it's a wonderful journey.
What do I see?
What do I see? what do I see? sleeping children.
On the other hand, there is nothing under the bed.
Where are the ghosts, the witches who sow fear and terror.
It is only these dear little ones who dream of their mothers.
What do I see.
No more monsters.
There is neither nightmare nor misery here.
And instead they will say that peace reigns on earth.
Instead of screams I hear symphonic music.
And the smell of the cakes is absolutely fantastic.
The party carries me away in its great farandole.
Suddenly my heart is racing.
I fly.
Finally my life has just taken on a new face, I always need more, I want to see everything, I want to know everything and I want to have everything
I need to know, I need to know what is this village called?
But where am I?

Amity: Bump gives her a scarf in exchange, a simple scarf, not of the best quality, but for Odalia, it was the best scarf in the world.

Bocha: she knocked on the door, like a devil, it was Eda who opened the door for her. 

Eda:*angry* you! If you come to pick up my wife on Christmas, stick your finger in her eye up to her elbows, she has the right to spend Christmas with her family, to spend time with her sick daughter. 

Odalia: you are absolutely right madam‚Ä¶

Eda: and how am I right...*looks at her in surprise* wait, am I right? 

Odalia: I came here to announce that Camilla will be able to stay* pretends to think* until the second, no third of January, and when I learned about your daughter's illness, I came to tell you that I will pay for everything from my pocket, she will have the best doctor and the best medicines.

For a servant without office 
Who cannot bring happiness to the living soul

Shrunken by dust 
Without ever being able to show our know-how 
To stroll around the castle

Youpla boom, thank you, my lady 
A candlelight dinner 
But everything is ready for the lady 
Frozen bombs, chilled Champagne 
Starched tablecloths, in my basket 
For dessert, I would make tea 
This is my great specialty 
While the cups play the rag 
I would make my pimpons, my little broths 
I will whistle like crazy 
I have a stain, that saddens me 
The important thing would be to give a good impression 
On the road and save whoever can 
*Serves Camilla a coffee* 
It will be a sugar or two, my darling 
It's the party 
It's the party 
It's the party 
It's the party 
It's the party 
Your desires and requests 
After ten years of pretense 
Come to brighten up your retirement 
To fill, to put at ease 
*Help service while dancing* 
I do my best to make you like it 
In the candlelight 
You will be spoiled, my turtledove 
Without manners, without grimaces 
Until you cry for mercy 
After dinner, we will push the escarpolette 
Tomorrow you will be better 
But tonight everything is blue 
We party 
Yes, the party 
Yes, the party 
We're celebrating.

1hlppxx,https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngelesSocialClub/comments/1hlppxx/looking_for_people_interested_in_starting_a/,Looking for People Interested In Starting a Science Fiction Book Club,"**Who I am and Why I want to start a book club**:

Hello everyone, I am making this post to see if anyone would be interested in starting an in person science fiction book club. I am a twenty six year old man living in west LA and I have been quite an avid reader since I was in high school. I read all different types of books, both fiction and nonfiction, but the ones that I enjoy the most are thought provoking, speculative science fiction that explores interesting, insightful, and entertaining ideas in science, technology, and society at large. My favorite types of stories I see as looking at a particular trend in the current world and then extrapolating upon that trend to try and envision how the world might look in the future if the trend continues. Along this line, I consider stories like *Brave New World*, *The City and The Stars*, and *Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?* (Blade Runner) to be some of my favorite and good examples of the types of books I would like to read and discuss with others. I actually consider Philip K. Dick to be one of my favorite science fiction writers and the genre of cyberpunk to be my favorite kind of story (*Snowcrash, Neuromancer, Blackfish City).*

**Types Of People I am Looking For and The Type of Club I Want To Start**:

I am looking for people who will be committed, relatively serious (but still lighthearted and fun), and put forth an effort to read deliberately and come to the club with well thought out ideas and opinions about the story to discuss. I want the club to be dedicated community for casual intellectual thought where everyone is welcome and comfortable and people feel no inhibition to share their thoughts freely. Let me say also, that I would be more than open to more casual readers being part of the club, but maybe just not having as much precedence in the club procedures (choosing books, discussion time, etc‚Ä¶) which I will talk about now.

**Club Operations and Procedures**:

Seeing as I would like this club to be a bit more thoughtful than the average book club, I think it would be a good idea to have some well defined structure to the way the club is run. Here are some of my thoughts on how the club could operate. I don‚Äôt want there to be too many rules, because that would just make things boring, unfun, and unwelcoming, but I think there should be some well thought out rules for how we read and discuss to facilitate meaningful discussion and exploration of the stories.¬†

* Choosing books to read:
   * Club goes through ‚Äúbook cycles‚Äù where by every member submits two or three candidate books that they would like the club to read.
   * The club goes through each members submissions and votes on one of the books to be added to the club‚Äôs list.
   * Books that are chosen are added to the club‚Äôs reading list and each time the club finishes a book, a new one is chosen at random from the list.
   * Once all the books on the list have been read, the ‚Äúbook cycle‚Äù is finished and the process starts again.
   * If a new member joins mid cycle, we do a single submission for them (they pick two or three books and we vote).
   * Perhaps we could give precedence to people who were members of the club at the start of the cycle, so new members books don‚Äôt get chosen before previous members. It‚Äôs just that I could for see a situation in which new members keep joining, submitting books, having their books chosen over existing members selections, and then leaving midway through, so I want to prevent that from happening as reading a book takes time and dedication that I don‚Äôt want people to feel like is being squandered in the club.
* Individual meetings:
   * First, we decide what chapters to read for the next meeting, or basically how much farther we will read for the next session. IE‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúThis week we will continue reading through chapter 14, so chapters 7-14. We will read the next 100 pages. etc‚Ä¶‚Äù
   * The main portion of each meeting consists of group discussion of the previous week‚Äôs reading in which one person at a time speaks for a predefined amount of time. Basically, a pretty standard group discussion format.
      * We pass around a ‚Äúspeaking token‚Äù which yields the right to speak (or maybe something more comical like a wizard hat, wooden pipe, monocle, or one of those old timey lecture hall pointing sticks professors used to use)
      * The person whose turn it is says their thoughts on the topic/talking point of the discussion cycle
      * The speaker may call on other members for questions or responses throughout their turn and the their time is stopped when the other person is speaking.
      * We have multiple rounds of group discussion with different talking points:
      * *Optional,* we could vote at the end of each session for who was the ‚Äú*wisest book wizard‚Äù* or something like that and keep score throughout the club, purely for brownie points (or in this case wizard points?)
   * After the main group discussion, we could just have more casual conversation and sociaize or do something else like play a game or something.¬†
* Rules for discussion:
   * I think it would be a good idea to have some general rules for the group discussion that keeps the conversation on point and civil.
   * I do not want ban discussion of heated topics like politics, religion, etc‚Ä¶ as I think exploration of these topics is pivotal to science fiction, but I also don‚Äôt want people to get genuinely angry or resentful to others they disagree with.
   * As a general rule, all discussion should be in some way related to the story, for example, in talking about the world of *Snowcrash*, I might make a point of talking about corporate control of the housing market and current housing issues here in LA, as one of the major plot points of the world of Snowcrash is that the lower classes and main protagonists of the story are forced to live in U-Haul storage units and as a result turn toward the metaverse as a kind of virtual supplement for the space they do not get in the real world.¬†
   * Maybe we could have a moderator or something and some rules for being barred from speaking or conflict resolution.
   * Full disclosure, I am a relatively secular in my spiritual beliefs and politically a left leaning progressive, but welcome all different points of view and would consider myself very reasonable and non judgmental. I have a lot of experience talking with people who disagree with me politically or on topics of religion and faith.
* Vetting and precedence:
   * I think it would be a good idea to have a system for establishing committed members of the club only because there might be people who just show up a few times or show up off and on.
   * I don‚Äôt want to exclude these people, but I also think it would be unfair to give them equal precedence in book choosing and discussion.
   * Maybe, the general rule would be you have to have been with the club for X amount of sessions or through one whole reading of a book in order to get a book submission in the club roster, or some other mechanism by which members can prove commitment to the club.

**Logistics and Meetings Planning**:

* I would definitely like for the club to be in person as much as possible and at least part of the time outdoors as I already spend enough time indoors as it is.
* I would like for this club to meet fairly regularly, like once a week, or perhaps even biweekly.
* I would also like for it to be held at a reasonable location that is convient for all the members.
* I personally know of a few different coffee shops we could meet at (Coffee Connection in Mar Vista, Village Well and Tanners Coffee in Culver City, etc), but we could also meet at libraries, public parks, or any other location people are comfortable with.
* The location does not need to be the same each week, as it is unlikely there will be a single location that‚Äôs convient for everyone.
* I personally work a standard 8-5, Monday - Friday, so I would be able to meet weeknights around 6 - 8pm and anytime on the weekends.
* I think that a Saturday or Sunday afternoon would be the best for me and the average person in general. Maybe around 1 - 4pm so it doesn‚Äôt conflict with anyone‚Äôs morning or evening plans.
* I live in West LA (Palms), so I would want the meetings to be within driving distance of West LA.
* Maybe we can alternate between west LA, downtown/east LA, and north Hollywood/the valley. If we held the meetings on the weekend that would also give everyone ample time to get to the meeting location.
* We can also make sure the meeting location is near some convenient metro/rail lines for people who don‚Äôt drive.

**Other ideas**:

* The club would mainly be focused on science fiction and fiction of the same vein like futurist, speculative, cyberpunk, etc‚Ä¶ basically any stories which are thought provoking, forward looking, and aim to challenge the reader, or otherwise are not written solely for entertainment purposes (no space operas or Starwars novels for example), but perhaps we can have a secondary optional reading that is more casual and can be from any genre. I have been reading a lot of the Green brothers novels‚Äô lately (Turtles All The Way Down is one of my favorites), which definitely can be thought provoking and moving, but are not necessarily speculative or forward looking and generally tend to be lighter reads. I definitely enjoy my fair share of fantasy, contemporary, classic, and nonfiction books and am open to anything. I think if we do incorporate a secondary reading though, it should generally be on the easier/lighter side.
* Over the past two years or so, I, personally, have been trying out writing my own science fiction off and on. I have a few different stories I have started and work on inconsistently when I have the motivation and inspiration. If others are interested, we could have a section at the end of the meetings dedicated to showcasing and discussing our own writing or ideas for writing. Maybe we could even do readings of some of the members works each week and provide feedback. To be clear, I have never published anything or even really shared any of my writing, but I would love to build a small network of other writers of any level to share our ideas with, provide feedback, and keep each other motivated.

**Conclusion**:

I didn‚Äôt expect to write this much so if you did read all of it, props. If this sounds like something you would like to do, comment or DM me. Honestly, if we can just get a few dedicated people, that would make me happy, but if this seems like a popular idea, I will start some social media pages for the club and maybe even make a website where we can facilitate all of the voting, membership, logistics, and keep track of each members *wizard points* or whatever, haha. I am going to try and repost this elsewhere and maybe make a group chat to discuss. This is something I have always wanted to do, so if you love science fiction and thinking critically about the world, but never felt you had a community of intellectually minded people to discuss your thoughts with, lets get this going.

TLDR:

I want to start a science fiction based book club for committed readers who want to have a community of people they can read stories with and have relatively serious, thoughtful discussions about those stories and the ideas they present. I would like for the club to be in person in LA, have some well defined structure, and be relatively often (once or twice a week). This is something I have always wanted to do as I am passionate about reading and science fiction, so if this sounds like something you would be interested in, comment or DM me and lets make it happen.",4,1735085123.0,LosAngelesSocialClub,0,1.0,False

Genuenly have 0 people to talk to. It‚Äôs so painfull, not only is it boring, it sucks, it‚Äôs embarassing, and so painfully fucking slow. Every lunch i sit by miself, every class I think about how fucking miserable I am. Writing this on christmas eve is even sadder lmfao wdf.


The friends from primary school i still kinda hangout with ill be spending new years eve with them, but even theyre slowly fadingüòÇ

genuenly don‚Äôt know wdf, my dad was an absoloute women slayer, friend maker, popular guy, and i feel like hes disapointed in me. I feel like shit and sleep and eat like shit. I got 9 trainings a week so I can atleast have something for my dad to be proud of (and to have a future for atleast something)

I used to be popular too (kinda) well i talked to people and I used to hangout a lot.. again wdf happend

told my dad he told me ‚Äújust talk to people‚Äù
and so I do‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs like I just get ignored. More or less straight up. Either people just don‚Äôt want to talk to me 1v1, or in a group (3-5 people) I just get ignored straight up. They just look at me wierd and continue with the convo. It sucks

What did I do??

I dreamt of highschool, and was scared of it. I knew my first impression was going to be how they will view me forever. Idek what I did wrong. On the first day I talked to people, second day I went on a coffee with 2 girls and a guy. Now, im just alone. 

Maybe I did this myself idk, I mean i always saw the people there as kinda wierd‚Ä¶ but I saw some people as cool too!!! the problem was I couldn‚Äôt join the cool people

See I‚Äôm in a sports exclusive class, where there are only people who do sports n shit..

and I‚Äôm a swimmer. In europe, especially my country/my city, it‚Äôs not popular‚Ä¶
you know what is popular?
FOOTBALL.
60% of people there train football.
which means most of the people there already know eachother.
Like 4 guys train together, 2 guys know eachother, theres 3 dudes that know the 4 guys that train and they all became a friendgroup.
I knew NOBODY. how the FUCK am I supposed to join.

Now sure, theres people who don‚Äôt train football. Like 2 dudes and a russian who is also lonely asf.

‚Äútalk to the russian‚Äù I fucking can‚Äôt he doesn‚Äôt speak my language he‚Äôs very introverted, they all percieve him as wierd..

oh fuck, they percieve me as wierd and introverted too????

now what did he do wrong? 
idk
I really really really don‚Äôt know.
He just looks wierd, I guess and didn‚Äôt talk to anybody
not even on the first day of school.

I did tho? how come I don‚Äôt have friends
again, I dont‚Äôt fucking know.

Funny thing is, I moved to sweden for a year.
and I was that guy for them.
In my class they couldn‚Äôt speak english for shit, and I couldn‚Äôt speak swedish for shit (even though swedes are amazing at english)

I remember it so fucking much. It was painfull. Painfull as fuck.

My parents were working hard for money
My dad was always working
and me?
I was lonely as fuck. A sad little piece of shit with no future doing nothing.

I felt useless. I felt like a burden to my parents. Like the biggest dissapointment to happen.

After the school year ended, we went back to my home country.

But we decided to go back next school year. So we did.
To a different city this time

this time it was different
I went to a international school.
And honestly, I found good friends. Ofcourse, they spoke english.
I spoke english.
We all worked. 
I still talk to them
I had a girlfriend too.
2 infact.
although it was all puppy love throught the phone, it was something big for me.
going from 0 friends to this? I genuenly felt good.

Sure, I was getting bullied, but I was always bullied. 
Most people are. So what? 
I was a little depressed.

which makes me think. Do I just want to find suffering everywhere, or am I really miserable?

next year, I came back, to my old school.
All my friends were happy to see me. Now this is where the best 2 years of my life began.

The friends I had (still do, kinda) are crazy, we did crazy shit together I never did before.
Steal my friends grandmas car to go buy weed at 3am, blow up trashcans with firecrackers, drink and drive scooters,‚Ä¶

It was genuenly fun, and I did not have a single problem. I was even happier.

I did not have a girlfriend tho. I genuenly couldn‚Äôt find one (all my other friends had one)

again, I really didn‚Äôt care, I knew my future was bright I was having fun not really caring too much about grades, etc etc..

sure I knew I wasn‚Äôt going to smoke weed and drink alcohol since my dad wouldnt like it and it felt disrespectfull to him, but I thought yolo, i‚Äôll stop when I go to highschool (which I did stop btw..)

and now, it was time to go to high school. Where it all began. I didn‚Äôt know it was going to be like this. It fucking SUCKS. It‚Äôs like what am I doing??

and so you might think I can switch schools?
Yah I can‚Äôt for multiple reasons.

This is one of the only schools in the country where they allow me to have this much trainings a week and not be in school so much. Every monday, wednesday, friday I wake up at 5:30am to go to school, even now when it‚Äôs christmas morning..

and also I‚Äôm lazy as FUCK when it comes to studying and I really mean it. and to be honest I‚Äôm quite stupid when it comes to anything ‚Äúschool‚Äù related.

which pains me so fucking much, It‚Äôs like everytime I even think about that god darn fucking classroom I wanna throw up. Like I genuenly get this ugly feeling, my heart starts to pump faster and I start feeling uneasy. JUST THE THOUGHT. and now knowing I gotta do 4 MORE FUCKING YEARS it makes me wanna KILL MYSELF. BUT I CANT THATS FOR PUSSIES AND MY DAD IS GONNA BE SAD. I love my dad too much to do that. Obv.

and don‚Äôt say ‚Äújust quit swimming to switch schools‚Äù thats even worse, thats genuenly one of my biggest personality traits or wdf do i call it.. the things i identify as. And my dad is very proud of me and I‚Äôm very good I‚Äôm not wasting my fucking talent.


this is also like my 2nd biggest rant I had one about my life story that lags my phone if i open it like dang.

Can you blame me? If I'm at the liberty to spend a holiday doing little else but relax, I might as well take it. Last night, Mother finished wrapping all her gifts and now the tree is not just full but stuffed. I can hardly get under there to water now. It looks quite lovely with all the lights and the now outside the window. 

I did do some 'work' but not on my book and nothing stressful or tome consuming. The mood struck me to start brainstorming cover art ideas for some of my other books. So I took out one of my notebooks and make some rough sketches for cover art of my book The Linguist and Chime: The Immortal who Wasn't. It was productive but low-stakes, perfect for the mood of the day. I don't know if these are going to be my final concepts but I'm very happy with what I came up with. The Linguist will be a open book filled with La√∏s writing with a dandelion growing out of a pile of raven and robin feathers; maybe some ink blots to give it character. The dictionary that goes with the book will also have have a dandelion motif. As for Chime, I obviously had to have chimes on the cover. I think it will be corinthian bell with latin numerals on each chime. The striker will be designed after a short-lived animal; I'm thinking a mayfly or dragonfly. It isn't much work but I am satisfied with myself nonetheless.

Now, it is time to relax. not that I did much to relax from. I think I'll go fetch my copy of A Little Princess and give it a light read over my evening coffee. Happy Holidays.

Yours & Mine,

1hlpmcm,https://www.reddit.com/r/BenignExistence/comments/1hlpmcm/extra_bacon/,Extra Bacon,"This happened a while ago, but I often think back and laugh about it.

I was a regular at a coffee shop, as it was the only place within walking distance from my job at the time. I would get the same thing for lunch every day, including a sandwich with bacon on it. They were all so lovely and soon enough it got to the point where they would have my order ready by the time I got to the register to order/pay.

One day, after deciding to cut back on my meat consumption, I ordered a simple bagel with butter - even warning them as I walked in that it would be something different today. 

I guess she assumed I didn't have the funds for my usual order, so the lady making my bagel whispered ""don't worry"" and made my normal order with EXTRA bacon - stacked so high she could barely wrap it up to go. 

I didn't have the heart to tell her I was trying to eat less meat. I thanked her with a huge smile and enjoyed the hell out of that thoughtful sandwich.",60,1735084784.0,BenignExistence,2,0.99,False

-	Body language and vocalizations translated to Galactic Standard (English) - 

The Grevic race was not known for its humor, creativity, or flexibility. Which made the giant pseudo-octopi great administrators and bureaucrats, but extremely poor on all social fronts. This did not, however, keep them from gossiping at work. 

‚ÄúDid you hear?‚Äù Grevic 9992763-2 asked his coworker in customs and immigration. ‚ÄúThe Mimics have landed on that new deathworld, Earth.‚Äù

Grevic 2734932-9 sighed. ‚ÄúOne more world falls to the Mimics. What‚Äôs the big deal?‚Äù he replied, his tentacles flicking idly.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt get it. The Mimics failed to infiltrate. They were detected and repulsed.‚Äù

Grevic 2734932-9 paused. ‚ÄúWhat are you saying? No galactic species has ever had a method for detecting infiltrators, let alone a barely-spacefaring, ominivorous death species! That‚Äôs absurd!‚Äù

Grevic 9992763-2 flicked its tentacles. ‚ÄúIt is true. I have the dispatch here. I can hardly believe it. Hold on a moment, let me broadcast this good news to the Overnet.‚Äù

As the Grevic 9992763-2 went to disseminate the news, Grevic 2734932-9 dissolved its cloying restrictive Octopoid form and ate Grevic 9992763-2 whole. As the mimic spent the next few minutes digesting its former coworker, it mulled over the recent discovery. A race that could detect them? Inconcieveable.

‚ÄúAnother pod‚Äôs landing from space! Looks like we‚Äôre getting some Ferringil reinforcements!‚Äù

Sergeant Timson shrugged. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see. Round up the droppers, see if they‚Äôre friendly. Gap hostiles, take their stuff, you know the drill.‚Äù

They marched back to HQ, where holographic battlemaps filled the walls. Several senior staff amassed. As the guards trained their rifles on the new arrivals, one challenged the Sergent. ‚ÄúTimson! This dumpster fire of a war, how would you describe things?‚Äù

Timson shrugged. ‚ÄúThis is fine.‚Äù

The man nodded. ‚ÄúPass.‚Äù 

Timson headed to the conference. The Galactic Civilizations had cautiously emerged from space months ago, looking to trade with new sapient species, but were oddly‚Ä¶ hesitant. They would not say WHY they were so skittish, but they obviously feared something.

Then reports came in. Reports of people acting weird, being weird, doing anti-human things. When shot, they reverted to a strange, semi-gelatinous, amorphous form that was quickly dubbed as Mimics. Once revealed and disseminated, the Galactic species became more talkative, if less willing to trade and interact.

He remembered one of the first briefings he ever had about them. 

‚ÄúThe Mimics are a species that is masterful at integration and infiltration,‚Äù the Saurid trader‚Äôs five henchmen nodded along with him, well versed in the bizarre biomimicry of the galactic scourge. ‚ÄúNo reliable method of detection has ever been produced to find them. They feed upon and manipulate all of society, and nowhere is safe. It makes us unsafe everywhere.‚Äù

‚ÄúI say take off, nuke the site from orbit. It‚Äôs the only way to be sure,‚Äù one human Captain muttered.

The Saurids all stared at him, except for one, a cargo handler in the trader‚Äôs contingent. It lashed out with sudden tendrils, killing several instantaneously. The humans present, being humans, drew their sidearms and mowed it down in a burst of MagAcc rounds. When it quit twitching and appeared to be dead, MPs moved in to secure the scene, and xenobios began investigations even as the Saurid traders (those who had survived) looked both disturbed and amazed.

‚ÄúHow did you detect it? Were you really going to deploy nuclear weapons upon this location?‚Äù

Colonel Fitz blinked. ‚ÄúDo you people not know what sarcasm is? Or movie quotes?‚Äù

The Saurid shooks its head. ‚ÄúThe word ‚Äòsarcasm‚Äô does not translate, except as a ‚Äòlie that is obvious and humorous in a dark, unbelieveable manner‚Äô. Such a statement is not‚Ä¶ I understand what my translator is saying, I comprehend the words, but we have no concept for it.‚Äù

The colonel stared. ‚ÄúYou have no concept for it, or the Galactic Civilization has no concept for it?‚Äù

The Saurid shrugged. ‚ÄúIs there a difference?‚Äù

The Colonel smiled.

- * -

Earth was mostly pacified. Trade with the galactic civilizations was mostly reestablished through some small, temporary orbitals that had been established. Which would normally cost the hosting civilization a dear sum, but‚Ä¶ the humans had proven miraculously capable of detecting Mimics. So much so, that starships began diverting to the Terran system in order to have their crews vetted and measured by the Terrans as safe or not safe. Quickly signs of ‚Äúit has been X stops since we were last cleared by Terran inspections for Mimics‚Äù were cropping up in general parlance and even in actual labels on starship bulkheads.

One such ship was docking now, at Terran Station Oxymoron. 

Yes, the Terrans had named it. No, the various alien species didn‚Äôt really get the joke.

They also didn‚Äôt comprehend the sign that said, ‚ÄúStupidity is Terminal in this system. No refunds. We break it, you bought it.‚Äù

A bulk cruiser‚Äôs full crew disembarked and filtered into a customs holding area, the Captain holding his crew of twenty in a small, measurable gaggle. The ursinoid Captain followed the signs until they were in an interview room, complete with seating for all of the crew. It was only then, when all crew were comfortable, that a single Earthling Inspector entered. 

‚ÄúJesus you guys stink!‚Äù the Inspector said without warning. ‚ÄúDid you marinate for your whole journey in skunk shit?‚Äù

One crew, a black-faced Fengail marsupiloid, rose from its chair. ‚ÄúWe do not smell that bad, just different‚Äù it exclaimed. 

The Inspector rounded the table and approached the crewman. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre very perceptive. Did you figure that all out by yourself?‚Äù

The creature stared, then responded, ‚ÄúYes, I did.‚Äù

-ZAP-

One dead mimic on the deck, and the rest of the crew in shock and horror. All except the Captain, who was cautiously pleased, at least by his body language. ‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶ pardon, Inspector, but how did you know?‚Äù

The Inspector smirked. ‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt understand. And neither do the Mimics.‚Äù

The Captain shrugged. ‚ÄúWe galactic races admire your astonishingly high detection rate of Mimics despite their perfect biological mimicry. We just wish we knew how you did it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI could tell you, but then I‚Äôd have to kill you. Plus, nobody plans a murder out loud,‚Äù he added, staring at several of the other crew who looked sketchy to him.

One, a grayish reptiloid, shed its form and brandished a pistol, only to be gunned down by the Inspector‚Äôs pistol faster than anybody had expected. After all of the crew had calmed and taken a few breaths or a drink of water, the Inspector smiled.

‚ÄúSee? Your crew is two Mimics lighter.‚Äù

The Captain stared at the human, who was obviously mad. ‚ÄúI do not understand your ways,‚Äù his translator relayed, ‚Äúbut I can appreciate your results.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat does not surprise me, Captain. As the captain of your own ship, you understand the chain of command, yes?‚Äù

The Captain nodded. 

The Inspector smiled, then pulled out a length of oddly-marked chain, each thick link an inch across, and attached to a broad black handle. The man touched a button in the handle, and the chain‚Äôs links began to glow and sizzle with a dull red heat that promised suffering.

‚ÄúWell, we humans find explaining this to alien crews to be quite illuminating. The way we describe the chain of command is as the chain that we beat the crew with until they understand who is in fucking command, capiche?‚Äù

Two more mimics revealed themselves before being gunned down by automated defenses.

- * -

The Inspector put away his props as he returned to the Customs and Immigration terminal. He poured himself a cup of coffee before slouching into a well-padded chair, glancing at his coworkers.

‚ÄúRough day, Simpson?‚Äù Inspector Meyers asked. 

‚ÄúOh, ya think?‚Äù he asked exasperatedly.

‚ÄúYes, I do,‚Äù Meyers replied quickly, before blanching. ‚ÄúI-‚Äú

The Inspector, plus three others already in the room, gunned down Simpson in a flurry of energy bolts. A steaming Mimic corpse was revealed a moment later.	

Kaperson, another Inspector, glanced over at Simpson. ‚ÄúFuck, been a while since a Mimic nailed an Inspector. We gotta report it.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust let me head to my quarters first. Got some farming to do, gotta go see if I‚Äôve grown some fucks to give yet.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlas, the fields of fucks have long since been barren,‚Äù replied Kaperson,

Simpson smiled. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôd‚Äôve thought our most valuable export to the galaxy would be sarcasm, metaphor, and movie quotes?‚Äù

Gutierrez, the newest (and the brownest) of the three Inspectors present, said, ‚ÄúSomeone said aliens, I thought they said illegal aliens, and signed up.‚Äù

I bought the Monogram bag a week ago and wasn't really into it. All I got out of it was kind of a cooked ginger/ savory aroma (sate chicken vietnamese sub came to mind...). I could be convinced of the rose, but couldn't find peach or orange. I struggled to find my happy place with the V60, so instead used the Switch and saw improvements in flavour and mouthfeel.

Left a little disappointed and still wanting an enjoyable decaf, I headed over to my local shop. While I was browsing, a staff member started chatting to me and recommended the September bag. I have a lot of trust in these coffee nerds, so I snagged it. When I got home, I realized the beans were the same as the Monogram bag. But then...

Wow! The September beans are pretty darn good. The Skittles descriptor is hilariously accurate, and I immediately landed on a great cup using the V60. Skittles, prune, and ginger were all present, and the flavour and mouthfeel were great. I decided to try the Switch brew and was even more impressed.

That's my story. I Hope you enjoyed it.",11,1735084613.0,pourover,10,0.92,False

So looks like I finally have plenty of time in-between doses of meds to finally tell this story. Fair warning, this is a long post. 

I work at a 4 diamond resort, that is comprised of 2 historic hotels a mile apart, connected by hundreds of acres of woodland and golf courses. Due to a local attraction, our busiest season on the year kicks off in late October. It is well known by all staff that this is the time of year where we run into the most problems. Thankfully, other than the normal chaos, the busy season at my property has been pretty standard. However the sister property, which has a casino as well, is the one that got the ultimate crazy. We literally haven't had a guest cause so much damage to one of the properties since that one guy ran naked through the halls and stairwells on PCP, ripped several security scanners off the wall, and knocked out everyone he came across. Now, onto the story! 

So a few weeks back I get a text from my spouse (they work at the sister property) asking if I knew anything yet about the ""Guest who flooded Property 1"" (P1 from here on out). Now I'm off that day, but am immensely intrigued and immediately go hunting for tea. I send texts out to the P1 FD Supervisor and MOD that I'm friends with, and ask if they've been holding out on me. Within 5 minutes I get a phone call from the P1 Supervisor, who is laughing and asking how the hell I've already heard about this when it just happened that morning. She then goes on to give me the details. 

There was a guest the night before that was being an absolute jerk to the deals at the casino. The Pit Boss and Security had finally had enough, and kicked Jerk out of the casino. Jerk then proceeds to go back to his room at P1. Now instead of accepting that being kicked out of the casino was a consequence of his own behavior, he decides we're discriminating against him, and he's going to teach us a lesson.

Jerk then goes into the bathroom, proceeds to stuff napkins and wash clothes into the drains, and turns the taps on full blast. With that started, he goes back into the bedroom. He rips open all the complimentary coffee in the room, gets the grounds wet, and then grinds them into the linens, wallpaper and carpet. Next Jerk takes the linens on one of the beds, bundles them up to look like a dead body, and wraps the cord of the room phone around the ""neck."" He then writes a confession/suicide note for the ""body."" To top off everything, and then proceeded to pee on both of the mattresses. Feeling his lesson is completed, he departed property. 

Cue to the next morning, and one of the dining venues reports water coming out of the ceiling. P1 FD checks, and the room above the venue is vacant. It's an old property, they're thinking a pipe probably burst. Nope! They get up to that room and water is pouring out of a waterfall in the ceiling. They check the system and the room above that belongs to a high-roller (we discovered later that Jerk was a friend of High-Roller that wasn'tlisted on the room). They call and knock, but nobody answers. They go ahead and enter. P1 staff encounters 3 inches of standing water, and the disaster that Jerk left behind. 

Absolute panic ensues. P1 MODs, the heads of Security and Engineering are all summoned. They start piecing together what happened, and how much damage had been done. By the time everything is done, they've discovered that this has destroyed 3 guest rooms, damaged 3 others, damaged the ceiling of the dining venue, and leaked into AV storage ruining some light and sound equipment, as well as some TVs and receivers. 

Casino system has High-Roller at a table that he hasn't left all night. High-Roller is highly upset that we've interrupted his streak. Security keeps him busy until the Police arrive. High-Roller didn't want to give up his friend Jerk, who he didn't believe did it. Apparently both of them forgot that we had scanned Jerk's ID when he entered the casino. So after Surveillance tracked all of Jerk's movements back to the time he entered the casino, we then had all his information. He was apparently quite surprised when the cops showed up to arrest him for Felony Vandalism. Needless to stay both Jerk and High-Roller have both been evicted from property with lifetime bans. 

TLDR: Jerk isn't happy he was kicked out of casino for abusive behavior. Goes back and floods/destroys room. Causes $100,000+ in damages due to the flooding. Gets arrested for Felony Vandalism. ",84,1735084104.0,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,10,1.0,False

If you do this for both sets, you say ""YES GAMING!!!!!"" in party chat.
* Whilst Gaius is casting after trapping you with Titan's power during Ultima Weapon, you say in party chat: ""Man, Gaius just rocked our world"".
* During Yuweyawata with a new player, it's important to instruct them as to the dungeon's mechanics: When the final boss is dead, you jump down the hole. If the new player gets it and does, be ready to give them a /thumbsup.
* When you random/roulette your favourite dungeon (which is Ktisis Hyperboreia), be sure to tell the other players at start, to share your enthusiasm for the game. If another player replies saying ""Meh, I don't like X expansion"" or ""It's too easy"", reply in chat ""fuck you cunt"" >!don't actually do this.!<
* By all means comment on Livia's raging thirst issues during Meridianum during the long-ass cutscene, but don't be upset/take it personally if no one replies, as your Monk (me, possibly) has in all likelihood gone to the kitchen to make coffee.
* If another player begins performing a looping dance emote whilst waiting for something, it's important to respond with a favourite looping emote of your own, lest other players (me) think you a sweatlord whose only there for tomestones and considers blind, one-handed Omega Protocol the only valid content in the game.
* Comment if you see another player's glam you think is cool: Their friends won't. They'll just ask why your tights (lvl88 striking) look weird (cuz they're idiots who only play League of Legends and don't know a cute, spunky, punchin' and kickin' Mi'qote when they see one).
* Rush ahead to pick up the firesand on the mound in Copperbell Mines to save everyone those .001 nanoseconds and be as helpful as possible (and cry internally when another player clicks the lever faster than you).
* If you get two Dancers, both Dancers must partner each other. Don't get all technical as to whether or not technical/standard step or devilment stack, that's nerd shit (and don't tell me in the comments which it is either because I will forget). Dancers dance with each other. It makes me feel sad not to. If you dance partner the tank instead of me I will cry later.
* If you're Astrologian, pick DPS' randomly for your damage cards. Only nerds have the best damage jobs listed in Excel, printed out and laminated on their desk, covered in drool as you think about your next complaint post.
* If you get Strayborough Deadwalk, all other rules are excused, because that first boss makes me want to unplug my PC and go back to playing turn-based games.
* If your healer is new, consider warning them before those really big pulls in Mt. Gulg, cuz those pulls are pretty gnarly (do them anyway, of course).
* Don't attack the heads in Sunken Temple of Qarn until last. If the enemies walk back and forth the heads might wander out of position, and the tank will think you're mentally disabled even though you're not (I'm sorry).
* If you get Temple of the Fist and you don't have a Monk, press U and click abandon. That dungeon's for me and my boy Widargelt. Plus the HOLY FIST is coming over later and I don't need nerd Black Mages and Pictos over.
* Most importantly, in the Aitiascope, you stop and pay repects to Hauchefant, in whatever way you feel. If you run past the buff, uninstall the game.

1hloyn2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1hloyn2/personal_things_i_learned_repairing_my_damaged/,[Personal] Things I learned repairing my damaged skin barrier,"Just sharing my experience hoping it will help those going through compromised skin barrier.

**A little bit about me and my skin:**

* I just turned 30
* I have normal skin that's usually even in skin tone and glowing
* Never had any skin issues
* I do not really use actives
* My usual skincare routine mainly focuses on keeping my skin plump and moisturised
* I live in Denmark where humidity is around 90% as we speak (24 December 2024)

**Symptoms I experienced one day (5 November 2024):**

* Stinging
* Dehydrated skin that felt very tight, but oily at the same time
* Extremely reactive, irritated and sensitive skin
* Redness and burning sensation
* Skin retaining heat

What I experienced resembled sensations that you usually have when getting a sunburn. I did not have dry patches, flaking or acne.

**Things I believe led to my damaged skin barrier:**

I got a red light therapy mask for my 30th bday, and after using it for 2 days in a row for less than 10 minutes I woke up to the above symptoms. I do not think it was the red light mask alone that caused the damage, but it was probably the last drop for my skin.

I also applied Garnier Naturals Botanical Rose Floral Water Toner before using the mask, and, apparently, it has citric acid as one of the components and it is one of the ingredients that can cause photosensitivity, making your skin more susceptible to damage from light-emitting diode (LED) light treatments and natural sunlight.

In addition to that these are the things that contributed to stripping my skin over the last 6-9 months:

* Using foaming cleanser twice a day (AM and PM)
* Applying cleanser in hot shower
* Exposing skin to harsh weather conditions without properly protecting it (cold and wind)
* Exposing skin to extreme heat (sauna) and then doing cold dips
* Stress
* Indoor heating season

**How long did it take to get my skin barrier fully in balance:** Almost 2 months, but I made a couple of mistakes along the way that delayed the healing process. Be patient, be gentle to your skin and be kind to yourself.

**Mistakes I made:**

* Started applying foundation (bb cream) after 1 week
* Started working out after work with make up on
* Went on a very long walk out in the cold
* Did not incorporate sunscreen in my AM routine at the beginning
* Slugging with lrps b5 or vaseline (really thick layering was not really necessary. sometimes less is more)
* Driving myself nuts by looking in the mirror 500 times a day and reading reddit nonstop. Apparently, it's something that is called a ""safety behavior"" when experiencing anxiety and you have to minimize these behaviors to get back on track. Mental part of this journey was a big part for me.

**Routine that worked for me:**

**Overall:**

* **Take a break from make up, foundation and powder specifically.** It's been almost 4 weeks now that I am not wearing any foundation and it's been the best thing that happened to my skin barrier repair. I was very anxious at first and it was extremely hard for me to go to the office without make up on. Too many thoughts, too many fears, too many insecurities, but by the end of the day no one cared, and no one really noticed anything.
* **Do your reseach and educate yourself** about skin barrier and transepidermal water loss (TEWL), **but avoid hyperfocusing.** At some point I found myself spending hours on Reddit and it wasn't doing any good for my mental health.
* **Drink plenty of water.** I have a 1L water bottle that I carry around all the time. 2-3L a day is quite normal for me.
* **Minimize alcohol consumption.** I switched to low- / no-alcohol drinks from ISH
* **Minimize coffee consumption.** I switched to matcha
* **Incorporate Omega-3.** It won't fix your skin barrier alone, but it won't harm you. Omega-3 fats also increase the production of ceramides which form the skin barrier, improving hydration and skin barrier function.
* If you are planning to go outside and it's harsh weather conditions out there (cold, wind, etc), make sure you **apply your AM routine 30 minutes before** going outside

AM:

1. Gently wash your face by splashing lukewarm water
2. Gently pat your face dry with a soft towel
3. Apply **Karmameju Hero pH solution** or Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence *(did not work for me when my skin barrier was damaged)*
4. Apply **Avene Cicalfate+ Serum** by pouring a couple of drops around your face and gently patting onto your skin
5. Apply **La Roche-Posay Cicaplast B5 balm**. Take a pea sized amount of the product. Warm it up by¬†*rubbing*¬†your hands together and gently pat onto your face. Apply more to tight areas if needed. My alternative to LRPS is **Dr. Jart Ceramidin Moisturizing Cream**, but it is not as rich, even though it's been my primary moisturizer for the part 1.5 years. I am slowly switching to Dr. Jart now when my skin barrier is more balanced.
6. Apply **La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune Invisible Fluid SPF 50+.** Shake it before use, take a bit in your hand, rub your hands together and pat the sunscreen onto your skin gently.
7. If you have dehydrated oily skin, use blotting paper throughout the day, for example **Sensai Face Fresh paper**, and reapply moisturizer as described in Step 5.

PM:

1. If you are wearing a mascara throughout the day, then use **Bioderma Sensibio H2O Make-up Removing Micellar Water** to gentle remove it. Soak two pads with your Bioderma micellar water. Gently press one on each closed eye for a few seconds.Slowly swipe them outward away from your eyes. Repeat if you still have any remaining mascara.
2. Wash your face with **CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser** and lukewarm water. I also tried Cerave Cream-To-Foam Cleanser, but it was too rough for my skin.
3. Apply **Karmameju Hero pH solution** or Cosrx - Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence *(did not work for me when my skin barrier was damaged)*
4. Apply **Avene Cicalfate+ Serum** by pouring a couple of drops around your face and gently patting onto your skin
5. Apply **La Roche-Posay Cicaplast B5 balm**. Take a pea sized amount of the product. Warm it up by¬†*rubbing*¬†your hands together to warm up the product and gently pat onto your face. Apply more to tight areas if needed. My alternative to LRPS is **Dr. Jart Ceramidin Moisturizing Cream**, but it is not as rich, even though it's been my primary moisturizer for the part 1.5 years. I am slowly switching to Dr. Jart now when my skin barrier is more balanced.
6. Only if absolutely necessary! Apply a small amount of **Vaseline Protecting Jelly - Original** on your hand, rub it and patch apply a thin layer to dry / red areas. Even though internet research is showing that Vaseline is non-comedogenic, I would not recommend overdoing and slugging with it. I went to the pharmacy and they offered me A-Derma Epitheliale AH Ultra-Repairing Cream as an alternative.",11,1735082448.0,SkincareAddiction,1,1.0,False

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it‚Äôs you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength‚ÄîI wish I‚Äôd had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There‚Äôs so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it‚Äôs not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian‚Äîyour mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she‚Äôs gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I‚Äôve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I‚Äôm certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup‚Äôs rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn‚Äôt know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you‚Äôll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I‚Äôm deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea‚Äôs trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, ‚ÄúW-what does this mean?‚Äù

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. ‚ÄúNot here, not now. Let‚Äôs get home, then we can talk.‚Äù

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother‚Äôs shrill voice called after them, ‚ÄúLeaving already? You haven‚Äôt stayed for lunch.‚Äù

Sorin‚Äôs jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.‚Äù With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. ‚ÄúDamn it, damn it, damn it.‚Äù

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea‚Äôs gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

‚ÄúD-do you‚Ä¶ think this could really be true?‚Äù Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. ‚ÄúLook, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might‚Äôve signed, we‚Äôll have proof.‚Äù He paused, deep in thought. ‚ÄúDad must have something lying around.‚Äù A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. ‚ÄúWhy did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could‚Äôve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!‚Äù

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. ‚ÄúWe‚Ä¶ we don‚Äôt really know what was going on back then‚Ä¶‚Äù

A sob erupted from him. ‚ÄúI loved him so much, Drea. I don‚Äôt remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end‚Ä¶‚Äù

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another‚Äôs embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, ‚ÄúCall Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.‚Äù

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn‚Äôt rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it! That woman is going to pay today. I‚Äôve tolerated her long enough!‚Äù He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

‚ÄúAdrian, no!‚Äù

Ah, Paris! The City of Lights, Love, and‚Ä¶ *le fashion*! Planning a trip to this iconic destination can be exhilarating, but also a tad daunting, especially when it comes to packing. You want to look the part while exploring charming cafes, world-class museums, and romantic streets. You dream of blending in with the effortlessly chic Parisians while still expressing your personal style. So, what‚Äôs a jet-setter to do? Fear not, fashionistas! This comprehensive guide will unravel the mysteries of Parisian style and equip you with everything you need to know about what to wear for Paris. From traversing the cobblestone streets of Montmartre to sipping champagne beneath the Eiffel Tower, we've got you covered. Let's dive into the enchanting world of Parisian wardrobes!

What to Wear for Paris: Mastering the Parisian Chic Look
--------------------------------------------------------

Before we delve into specifics, let's grasp the essence of Parisian style. Think understated elegance, timeless pieces, and a certain *je ne sais quoi*. It's about looking effortlessly put-together, prioritizing quality over quantity, and exuding confidence. Forget flashy logos and over-the-top trends; Parisian chic whispers rather than shouts. Picture yourself strolling along the Seine, a silk scarf casually draped around your neck, a perfectly fitted blazer, and a pair of classic ballet flats. That's the vibe we're aiming for!

### Decoding the Parisian Dress Code

- **Neutrals are your best friend:** Think black, white, beige, navy, and gray. These versatile hues form the backbone of any Parisian wardrobe and can be effortlessly mixed and matched.
- **Invest in quality basics:** A crisp white shirt, a well-tailored blazer, a classic trench coat, and a perfectly fitting pair of dark wash jeans are your essential building blocks.
- **Accessorize strategically:** A silk scarf, a delicate necklace, a stylish handbag, or a beret can elevate any outfit. Think less is more.
- **Comfort is key:** Parisians walk *everywhere*, so comfortable shoes are a must. Ballet flats, loafers, or stylish sneakers are ideal. Leave the sky-high stilettos at home!
- **Embrace the stripe:** Breton stripes are a Parisian staple and add a touch of effortless chic to any ensemble.

What to Wear for Paris: Packing for Every Occasion
--------------------------------------------------

Now that you understand the fundamentals, let‚Äôs break down what to wear in Paris based on different occasions. Remember, adaptability is key!

### Sightseeing and Exploring

Imagine yourself exploring the Louvre, climbing the Arc de Triomphe, or wandering through the charming streets of Le Marais. Comfort is paramount here, but that doesn't mean sacrificing style!

- **Outfit Idea:** Dark wash jeans, a Breton striped top, a comfy cardigan or lightweight jacket, and stylish walking shoes or sneakers. A crossbody bag is perfect for keeping your essentials safe and your hands free.

### Romantic Dinners and Evening Outings

Paris is synonymous with romance, so be prepared for enchanting evenings! Whether you're enjoying a candlelit dinner or catching a show at the Moulin Rouge, a touch of elegance is essential.

- **Outfit Idea:** A little black dress (LBD) is always a winner. Alternatively, a chic jumpsuit or tailored trousers paired with a silky blouse can be equally stunning. Add some heels (if you're comfortable) and a statement piece of jewelry.

### Museum Hopping and Cultural Experiences

Paris is a cultural mecca, with world-renowned museums and galleries. While there's no strict dress code, opting for a polished yet comfortable look shows respect for the venue and allows you to blend in with the sophisticated crowd.

- **Outfit Idea:** Tailored trousers or a midi skirt paired with a sophisticated blouse or sweater. A scarf or a statement necklace can add a touch of personality. Comfortable loafers or flats are a must for navigating those museum halls.

### Shopping Sprees and Cafe Culture

From haute couture boutiques to charming vintage shops, Paris is a shopper's paradise. And let's not forget the quintessential Parisian experience of sipping coffee at a sidewalk cafe.

- **Outfit Idea:** A stylish yet practical outfit is essential. Think chic jeans or a flowy skirt, a comfortable top, and a blazer or a cardigan for layering. Ballet flats or comfortable sandals are ideal for pounding the pavement.

What to Wear for Paris: Seasonal Considerations
-----------------------------------------------

The weather in Paris can be as unpredictable as its fashion trends. Packing for all eventualities is crucial.

### Springtime in Paris

Spring in Paris is magical, with blossoming flowers and mild temperatures. Layering is key, as the weather can fluctuate.

- **Must-haves:** A light trench coat, a cardigan, a light scarf, and a pair of comfortable walking shoes.

### Summer in the City

Parisian summers can be surprisingly hot and humid. Light, breathable fabrics are essential.

- **Must-haves:** Flowy dresses, linen pants, cotton tops, sandals, and a wide-brimmed hat for sun protection.

### Autumnal Adventures

Autumn in Paris is picturesque, with golden leaves and crisp air. Layering is once again crucial.

- **Must-haves:** A cozy sweater, a light jacket, a scarf, ankle boots, and a stylish umbrella for those occasional showers.

### Winter Wonderland

Parisian winters can be chilly, so pack warm layers.

- **Must-haves:** A warm coat, a hat, gloves, a scarf, and waterproof boots. Don‚Äôt forget thermal underwear for extra warmth!

What to Wear for Paris: Accessories that Make a Difference
----------------------------------------------------------

Accessories can make or break an outfit. Here's how to accessorize like a true Parisian:

1. **The Scarf:** A silk scarf is a Parisian wardrobe staple. Tie it around your neck, your handbag, or even your wrist for a touch of effortless chic.
2. **The Bag:** A stylish handbag is a must. Choose a classic tote, a crossbody bag, or a chic clutch depending on the occasion.
3. **Jewelry:** Keep it simple and elegant. A delicate necklace, a pair of understated earrings, or a classic watch are all you need.
4. **The Beret (Optional):** While the beret is a quintessential Parisian accessory, it can sometimes feel a bit clich√©. If you choose to wear one, opt for a classic wool beret in a neutral color.

What to Wear for Paris: A Few Final Tips
----------------------------------------

- **Pack light:** You'll be doing a lot of walking, and lugging around heavy suitcases is no fun. Choose versatile pieces that can be mixed and matched.
- **Leave the flashy logos at home:** Parisian style is understated and elegant. Avoid anything too loud or attention-grabbing.
- **Don‚Äôt be afraid to experiment:** While there are certain style guidelines, don‚Äôt be afraid to express your personality. Parisian chic is all about confidence and individuality.
- **Embrace the imperfections:** Parisians embrace a certain effortless imperfection. Don't worry about your hair being perfectly coiffed or your outfit being flawlessly ironed. A little bit of ""messiness"" adds to the charm.
- **People-watch:** One of the best ways to learn about Parisian style is to observe the locals. Take a stroll through a fashionable neighborhood and soak in the inspiration.

1hlolqq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hlolqq,Curing Resin 3d Prints for Molds,"I made a model for a dice insert but was getting frustrated by how long it was taking to off gas (otherwise the silicone won't cure right).

 I found an old post saying that over curing it and then soaking it in lye for a few hours would complete the process and stop the of gassing. But I didn't want to spend the money on lye from Lowe's so I had to get creative. I remembered my dad telling me how his dad fed home made lye to pigs to get rid of worms so I asked how he made it, he said from wood ash. From there I found a video of someone doing so but on a large scale. 

So I took some white wood ash from the fireplace and grabbed a jar with some rocks and a good few coffee filters. I put in the rocks to hold up space while the lye filtered, I tamped down the ash when the filter was set up in the jar, and then I poured in the water. What I got was an almost dark cola colored liquid with a heavy burn smell (probably from the wood resin). 

To be safe I put the miss print of the master die in the lye for testing for six hrs, the original post said three but I am not sure how strong the lye I made is. After that I put a bit of silicone on it and a couple hours later I found that it worked.

I just wanted to leave this here in case anyone else didn't have the patience to wait out the off gassing process like me.

# Tips for Planning a Grinch-Themed Event

Planning a Grinch-themed event might sound daunting, but with a few strategic steps, you can turn your vision into reality. The key lies in careful coordination and attention to detail.

**1. Choosing the Right Date and Venue**  
Start by picking a date that works for most of your guests. Since the holiday season is packed with events, sending out invites early ensures maximum attendance. Choose a venue that complements the theme‚Äîbe it your backyard, a banquet hall, or a cozy living room. The setting should accommodate your guest count and provide ample space for activities.

**2. Coordinating Decor with a Grinch Theme**  
Your decorations set the mood for the entire event. Think vibrant greens and reds, whimsical trees, oversized ornaments, and, of course, Grinch-inspired accents like stockings ""stuffed"" with lumps of coal. Don‚Äôt forget to add signage with iconic Grinch phrases, such as ""Who-ville Welcome"" or ""Naughty List Headquarters.""

**3. Invitations and Guest Engagement Ideas**  
Your invitations can double as the first hint of the theme. Use playful wording and graphics featuring the Grinch to build excitement. Encourage guests to dress up in Whoville-inspired costumes or Grinch-green outfits. This interactive element adds a layer of fun before the event even begins.

# How to Keep Guests Engaged During the Event

One of the biggest challenges of any event is maintaining the energy throughout the celebration. With a Grinch-themed party, you have endless opportunities to keep everyone entertained.

**1. Games and Activities with a Grinch Twist**  
Incorporate themed games like ""Pin the Heart on the Grinch"" or a scavenger hunt for ""stolen"" presents. For kids, craft stations where they can create Grinch masks or ornaments are a hit. Adults might enjoy trivia challenges based on Grinch movies and books.

**2. Incorporating Music and Entertainment**  
Curate a playlist that mixes holiday classics with songs inspired by the Grinch. If possible, hire a live band or DJ who can add an extra layer of excitement. For a cinematic touch, play snippets of the Grinch movie on a screen during the event.

**3. Photo Opportunities with the Grinch**  
A photo booth is always a crowd-pleaser, especially when the Grinch is involved. Set up a corner with props like Santa hats, oversized candy canes, and Who-ville-inspired backdrops. Guests will love capturing memories with the star of the party.

# Making Your Event Kid-Friendly and Fun

While the Grinch‚Äôs antics are universally appealing, it‚Äôs essential to strike the right balance for young attendees.

**1. Child-Centric Activities**  
Consider activities that cater specifically to children, such as face painting, storytelling, or puppet shows. The Grinch can lead these sessions, keeping the kids entertained while parents mingle.

**2. Balancing Humor with Lighthearted Fun**  
The Grinch‚Äôs humor can be cheeky, but it should never cross into mean-spirited territory, especially around kids. A skilled performer knows how to keep things playful without upsetting anyone.

**3. Ensuring a Safe and Inclusive Environment**  
Safety should always come first. Make sure the venue is childproof, and activities are suitable for all ages. Consider dietary restrictions if food is served and provide options that cater to diverse preferences.

# A Grinch for Hire: Elevating Office Parties

Holiday office parties are notorious for being either a hit or a miss. Introducing a Grinch performer can ensure your event falls firmly into the ""hit"" category.

**1. Building Team Spirit with Laughter**  
The Grinch‚Äôs antics are a great way to break down barriers and build camaraderie among employees. He can playfully tease team members or orchestrate games that encourage teamwork.

**2. Unique Entertainment for Employees**  
Instead of the usual speeches and awards, let the Grinch take center stage. His unique humor and energy will keep the atmosphere light and enjoyable.

**3. Boosting Morale During the Holidays**  
The holiday season can be stressful, especially for employees juggling work and personal obligations. A Grinch-themed party provides a much-needed break, lifting spirits and showing appreciation for their hard work.

# Planning Your Event Budget

Budgeting is a crucial part of planning any event. Fortunately, a Grinch-themed party can be tailored to suit various budgets without sacrificing fun.

**1. Factors to Consider for Hiring a Grinch**  
Costs can vary depending on the performer‚Äôs experience, the event‚Äôs duration, and additional activities. Plan ahead to allocate funds for key elements like decor, food, and entertainment.

**2. Affordable Options for Small Gatherings**  
If you‚Äôre hosting a smaller event, consider DIY elements to save costs. Create your own Grinch-inspired decor or organize simple games that don‚Äôt require extensive props.

**3. Maximizing Value Without Sacrificing Fun**  
Invest in areas that will have the most significant impact, such as hiring a talented Grinch performer. Skimping on quality can lead to disappointment, so prioritize professional entertainment to ensure your event‚Äôs success.

1hloimd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1hloimd/vegas_story_best_slot_machine/,Vegas story best slot machine!,"A Vegas story from a senior citizen:

There's a casino near China Town that has a machine that always pays out 100% or more!  

First time I played this machine I put in $5 and while I'm looking for my card and a slot for it the machine made a bunch of noise and then spit out a piece of a foam like from the bottom of a foam coffee cup and then over $50 in quarters!  

I didn't realize it was a real quarter machine.  Anyway, I put in another $5 and won another $5 in quarters!  $20 and won $20 in quarters!  

I played for maybe an hour before I ran out of cash and had to trade all my quarters in for more bills.  Although, the machine takes cards too!  At the end of that I was up at least that first $50!  

Usually this machine pays out at least 100%, which I have to say is better odds than I've ever had on slots anywhere else!

It's not a very exciting machine.  It doesn't really have a pull arm, just a button you push, like a lot of the newer and smaller machines.  But this one doesn't even have a screen or wheels, just a small display that only shows how much I put in it.  But I don't care!

Also, maybe every 10th or 12th play I'll maybe only get .75¬¢ per dollar back BUT don't let that worry you.  Always the next play or two I win MORE than 100% and so it always evens out.  

I don't know how the casino makes money on this, but so far I always win as much as I play!  

If you want to try it, the machine is near the cashiers booth near the west entrance.  It's just got a lighted sign at the top called ""CHANGE.""  I can say it honestly changed how I see slot machines!  

If you get over there go in and give it a try!""",1,1735080924.0,Jokes,0,0.56,False

This trip was arguably for MILs benefit. We discussed this with her months ago before booking the nonrefundable room to confirm this was where we should be, and we talked about it again with her at thanksgiving. 

We get here, and turns out she decided we‚Äôre doing the whole week at a different family house which is 40 minutes away in the middle of nowhere. It‚Äôs surrounded by hills and poison oak and mud and loose neighbor dogs/coyotes, with 3/4 of the bedrooms rented to strangers who will be spending the holidays with us apparently. The other bedroom is where his dad died on Christmas a few years ago so we are not mentally comfortable sleeping in there, though she apparently thought we would despite us telling her about the hotel multiple times. 

And the whole house is a baby death trap of glass trinkets, choking hazards and creepy antique dolls everywhere at toddler height. There‚Äôs a Christmas tree with tons of glass ornaments of course. As a bonus, she left a pill dispenser with pills in it on the coffee table in the room where she told us to have baby play. It was dark in the room due to a party thing with the lights only on outside till everyone finished singing so I didn‚Äôt see it till baby almost grabbed it üò© also this is just me being petty, but she never has vegetables around so I bring chia seeds and yogurt to keep us all regular or we get constipated lmao

First Reddit post ever here. I'm (35M) looking for some recommendations on everyone's favorite hotel lobbies to WFH. For context, I usually go to coffee shops or cafes like Tatte Bakery or, Breeze Bakery in Annandale, but during the holidays last year, I drove up to Baltimore and visited the Pendry Hotel when they had their holiday decor up and really enjoyed sipping a cocktail by the fireplace and Christmas Tree while writing up some contracts/sending emails. I'm not a W2 employee (business owner/1099) so I don't have a set schedule. I just get cabin fever if I sit inside my apartment all day and like to change things up. Like anyone else, I enjoy a good ambience where I can people watch or that has beautiful architecture or interior design. Extra points if the food and drinks are excellent. I typically go to Mercy Me at Yours Truly in West End or the Ritz Carlton in downtown or Georgetown, but I'd love to try some new places. Whatcha all got?
