1lnb7uw,https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegameswap/comments/1lnb7uw/h_lots_of_games_w_trade_for_games_or_paypal_eu/,[H] Lots of Games [W] Trade for Games or Paypal (EU),"**Last Updated List: 29/06/2025**

&nbsp;

I'm primarily looking to trade for games from my **[wishlist](https://redd.it/zw7tvs/)**, otherwise I am also open to selling them. I am not interested in games I already have, only exception are some co-op games, and all games I'm getting for myself are activated on my own account. Other than that feel free to offer your list of Steam games and something I may not have and fulfills my criteria I could/would be willing to trade for it/them.

* To trade you must respond to this thread first, I will not respond or accept anyone outside of this thread, only exception are unless we've traded more than once before.
* Only interested in trading for games on Steam.
* I don't do Humble gifts whether receiving or giving, all my keys are in unrevealed form right after purchase.
* No interest in any keys from an unofficial retailer/source (aka grey market), curator/reviewer keys (aka beta/reviewer/beta-testing/etc.), keys for games that are already free on Steam itself, Steam profile-limited keys, although some interest in VR-titles and/or de-listed games (no banned games).
* Anything marked as wishlist/paypal, it's self-explanatory and I won't look through lists.
* All my keys are EU keys, if you are outside of EU, make sure you double check for any region locks for your country. For quite a few which I was aware of I already listed the region lock, however this is not my responsibility as I did specify the key's region.
* When buying, I only accept payments in Euro's. Minimum purchase of €1,00. Fees are on buyer.

If you're either trading or buying please state the game(s) you are interested in and your offer (game(s)/list/price).

&nbsp;

**Info:**

* Region (and keys region): **Europe**

* **[IGS Rep Page](https://reddit.com/r/IGSRep/comments/zvionr/xiaoliis_igs_rep_page/)**

* **[SteamTrades](https://www.steamtrades.com/user/76561198074920693)**

* **[SteamRep](https://steamrep.com/profiles/76561198074920693)**

&nbsp;

I kindly ask of you is to be reasonable when making offers to make it a fair trade for both of us.

Let's have a good exchange/trade!

Now, she’s done being quiet.While the Paxtons and Lockharts scramble to keep up appearances, Camilla’s already drafting divorce papers.They expect her to forgive, forget, and fold.But Camilla doesn’t beg.She fights.And when the truth of Edward’s betrayal burns through both families, she won’t be the only one left in ashes.Chapter 1        Edward Paxton, Camilla Lockhart's husband, inherited everything from Elijah Lambert, his late sworn companion.        Including Elijah's wife, Aurora Collin.        Edward reassured Camilla, ""Aurora is like family to me.""        Camilla chose to believe him.        Then one day, she heard Aurora's son Nicholas Lambert call Edward ""Daddy"".        Only then did she realize she had been kept in the dark all this time.        \*\*\*        After the wedding, Camilla lay in Edward's arms. It was such a long day, and they could finally get some rest.        Edward had just closed his eyes when his phone rang. Irritated, he got up and grabbed his phone from the nightstand.        ""Who is it?"" he said impatiently.        Camilla heard a woman's voice. ""Ed, Nico's been running a fever and convulsing since we got back from the wedding. I called an ambulance, but it's still nowhere to be seen. What should I do? Could you come over and go to the hospital with us?""        Upon knowing Nicholas was sick, Edward was no longer sleepy.        His eyes snapped into focus as he said without hesitation, ""Don't worry, Aurora. I'll be there right away to take you to the hospital.""        Hearing this, Camilla turned around and stared at him coldly.        She thought, ""Aurora knows exactly it's our wedding night, yet she's calling him away now? That's just too much. Does she think I'm a pushover or what?""        A sarcastic smile played on her lips.        ""If you go out now, don't bother coming back. I'm serious.""        Edward was uneasy under her icy stare. For some reason, he just couldn't bring himself to leave.        Their eyes met, hers unflinching, and his evasive.        After quite a while, he plucked up his courage and said, ""Camilla, that was Aurora. She said Nico had a high fever. I gotta go with them to the hospital. I promise I'll be back the second I know he's fine.""        Remaining silent, Camilla stared at him without blinking.        He couldn't help but feel uneasy under her gaze. He knew it was their wedding night and leaving her alone was such a lousy thing to do.        On the other hand, it was late at night, and how was Aurora supposed to take care of the sick Nicholas alone? After all, she was just a widow with no one to turn to. He should check on them-make sure Nicholas was OK at least.        ""Camilla, I'm sorry. From now on, you get to call the shots on everything, alright? Here's my secondary card. Buy whatever you want.""        He lowered his head to kiss her with a fawning smile, trying to make her feel better, but she pushed him away coldly.        Knowing there was nothing she could do to stop him, she said flatly, ""Go. Don't bother coming back tonight. I'll see you at the courthouse tomorrow to get a divorce.""        Her face fell as she slammed her earrings onto the vanity, walked into the bathroom, and started to remove her makeup.        Edward paced back and forth outside, not daring to leave.        He then walked over to the bathroom and continued to reason with her, ""Camilla, we've been together for years, and you know how much Elijah meant to me. Now that his son is sick, I can't just sit around and do nothing. I'm sure you understand, right?""        Camilla stopped wiping her face. She turned around and questioned him, ""Are you a doctor? What could you possibly do at the hospital? If Aurora can't manage, there are nurses to help her. Doesn't she know it's our wedding night? Why does she have to call you tonight?""        As a woman, she knew exactly what Aurora was planning.Chapter 2        She had said enough. If Edward still didn't understand, then there was nothing she could do.        Seeing that Camilla was indeed upset, Edward walked to the bed and sat down in silence.        Soon, his phone rang again. Nicholas' cries were so deafening that he could no longer sit still.        He strode over to the bathroom door, saying, ""I'm sorry, Camilla. Nico is crying so hard... I have to go and check on him. You know Elijah entrusted them to me before he died. I... I won't feel at ease unless I see them tonight. Forgive me. I swear I'll make it up to you after I come back.""        All she heard next was the sound of his footsteps, the door opening, then closing with a click.        Soon, the room fell silent again.        Biting her lip, Camilla glanced at herself in the mirror and saw her slightly red eyes.        Her family and Edward's family went way back, and they had played together a lot when they were kids. Since they were close in age, their families had arranged for them to get married ever since they were little.        As they grew up, they came to realize they were bound to spend the rest of their lives together. After all, their families' businesses had become inseparable, and the arranged marriage would make the alliance unbreakable.        However, Elijah fell sick and passed away three years ago. On his deathbed, he entrusted Edward with Aurora and Nicholas. Ever since that day, everything had changed. Aurora and Nicholas had started to occupy most of Edward's time and energy, so much so that Camilla, his fiancee, had stopped being his priority.        Camilla had thought of calling off the marriage because she knew she wouldn't be happy. However, the wedding invitations had been sent out, and it was too late to regret it now. Her protest was ignored.        As it turned out, she was right-getting married was the beginning of her nightmare. On their wedding night, Edward left her for Aurora, making her the biggest joke.        ""This is so unfair,"" she thought bitterly. ""I don't deserve this. Since I'm upset, I'm gonna drag the whole world down with me.""        No longer in the mood to remove her makeup, she washed her hands, grabbed her phone from the vanity, and opened the chat group with members from both sides.        She tagged everyone before texting, ""Edward left me alone on our wedding night to take care of his best buddy's wife and son. I know how much friendship means to him, and I get it. But I also take this as a blatant insult to both me and my family. So, I'm gonna go to the courthouse with him tomorrow morning. I'm getting a divorce.""        She clicked ""send"" without hesitation.        Since Edward chose Aurora over her, why would she show him any mercy? She might as well let everyone be the judge.        Both families had just come home after the wedding, and many of them were still awake.        Their faces fell as they saw Camilla's message.        Especially the Lockhart family.        They felt insulted. What was more, they knew Camilla well. She had said she didn't want to marry Edward before the wedding, but they had turned her down because of family interest.        Now she was left behind on her wedding night, and her message was her protest against them. If they asked her to endure being treated like this, she'd probably throw caution to the wind and turn everything into a mess. If that really happened, the Lockhart family would forever be inferior to the Paxton family.Chapter 3        With such considerations, her brother Kieran Lockhart immediately called the Paxton family to make things right for her.        After going at each other over the phone, the two families reached a consensus-for the sake of their friendship and partnership, the Paxton family would take Edward back from the hospital to make sure he apologized to Camilla properly.        They immediately sprang into action after hanging up.        As the Lockhart family kept calling Camilla, trying to change her mind, the Paxton family headed to the hospital.        Camilla was utterly bugged by her phone, which wouldn't stop ringing at all. She simply switched it to airplane mode.        Then she went into the bathroom to take a shower, trying to calm herself down with cold water.        After quite some time, she finally felt better. Walking out while wrapping herself in a bath towel, she heard a commotion from the courtyard downstairs. She pulled back the curtains and poked her head out, only to see several cars parked outside, illuminating the courtyard brightly.        Looking closely, she recognized their license plates-those were the two families' cars. She figured they had come here to persuade her.        Knowing what they'd say, she couldn't be bothered to deal with them. She drew the curtains shut, lay in bed, pulled up the covers, and closed her eyes to sleep.        Unfortunately, someone wouldn't let her.        Kieran slammed on the door with great force nonstop, shouting, ""Camilla! I'm here to stand up for you! Open the door!""        His knocking was like a drum, almost deafening.        Camilla sighed and changed her clothes before opening the door.        Waiting at the door for a few minutes, Kieran complained, ""Camilla, what took you so long? You're driving me insane! Our whole family is here to back you up.""        She curled her lip, pointed downstairs, and said flatly, ""I was in my pajamas. I gotta change before seeing you, right? I know you're gonna take turns to talk me out of it. It's gonna be forever.""        She saw through them easily, and her calm demeanor made Kieran slightly scared.        A bit uneasy, he said, ""Camilla, the way Edward treated you is unfair. I know that. But are you serious about getting a divorce? You've been going out for years, got married three days ago, and held the wedding today. Don't you think getting a divorce so soon is a bit ... impulsive?""        Instead of answering him, Camilla asked, ""What's so wrong about getting a divorce? I married him just like you wanted. And now, I don't think I can be with him anymore and want a divorce. It's my own business. You have no say in this.""        She stepped forward and then realized Kieran was standing in place, not following her.        She rolled her eyes helplessly and then turned around, raising her voice. ""Kieran, what are you waiting for? Keep up. When I ask for a divorce later, you can take advantage and use me one last time to ask for more money from the Paxton family.""        Her words were so blunt that Kieran's cheeks flushed with embarrassment.        He then followed her downstairs. On the sofa in the first-floor living room sat several people.        Edward's grandparents, parents, and sister were here, and so were Camilla's parents and sister-in-law.        Upon seeing Camilla, Edward's sister Jadeana Paxton trotted over and took her hand affectionately.        ""Camilla, it's Edward's fault. No matter what, leaving you alone on your wedding night is inexcusable. Don't worry-we'll definitely teach him a good lesson to make things right for you.Chapter 4        ""But... No more jokes about a divorce, alright? Camilla, listen to me. You shouldn't bring up a divorce so easily. If you get a divorce right after marrying him, it won't do any good to anyone's reputation, especially yours.        ""It's not that big a deal today. Camilla, could you let him slide this time? You're the bigger person here. When he comes back, we'll scold him so harshly until he cries. Trust me-we're on your side. Just ... don't talk about getting a divorce again, OK?""        Finding Jadeana's words grating, Camilla looked up at Jadeana and then slowly withdrew her hand.        Regardless of what Jadeana said, she knew Jadeana still favored Edward. She turned around and said firmly, ""No.""        Looking around, she noticed the displeased looks on those people's faces and quickly organized what she was about to say inwardly.        Then she said, neither humble nor pushy, ""I know how much his promise to Elijah means to him, and I totally get it. But it doesn't mean I deserve to be treated like this. I made it very clear to him before he left today that as long as he stepped out, we'd get a divorce. The fact that he's at the hospital instead of here right now suggests deep down, he doesn't want me. Getting a divorce as soon as possible is good for us both.""        If she got a divorce, she could spend the rest of her life having fun. If she didn't, she'd be disgusted every day, seeing him waiting on Aurora and Nicholas hand and foot.        It was such an easy choice, and she had figured it all out a long time ago. After saying this, she sat on a chair slowly and met their complicated gazes, totally unfazed.        Then she continued, ""Before getting married to Edward, I repeatedly said that I didn't want this marriage. But you all thought it was too late to call it off. What did you say to me back then? You promised that I'd be his priority after our marriage, but he still cares about Aurora so much even to this day. As his wife, I can't stand seeing him choosing the other woman over me.""        She seemed both angry and helpless.        ""The last thing he'd do is break his promise to Elijah, but his promises to me obviously mean nothing to him. He takes meticulous care of Aurora and Nicholas and ignores me as if I were invisible. You can say whatever you want. It won't change the fact that he left me for them on our wedding night. Don't you think they should be a family? Just leave me alone. I really think I deserve someone better.""        Some of the people here came prepared with speeches, wanting to talk her out of it. But after hearing her words, they just parted their lips but didn't know what to say.        She looked around. Upon seeing the looks on their faces, she knew they were more or less swayed.        Then she continued, appealing to their empathy, ""Most of you have daughters, and I believe you can relate. If you think this is acceptable and still try to talk me out of it, think about it-how would you feel if your daughter's husband left her for another woman on their wedding night?""        Edward's grandfather William Paxton was a bit uneasy after hearing her words. He looked up and stared at her, his gaze complex.        She noticed his gaze and met his eyes with a smile, not flinching at all.        He sighed, stood up with his cane, and slowly walked toward her. Then he patted her shoulder with his weathered hand.Chapter 5        ""Cami, I know this is unfair to you. I apologize to you on behalf of my family. I know those talks about being the bigger person are all empty. How about this? After Edward comes back, I'll beat him up till you say stop.""        Knowing this was his way of trying to change her mind, she smiled and patted his hand.        The look on her face was still calm and composed.        ""William, deal with him however you want. It's your family's business, and I have no say in it. I've decided to get a divorce, so whatever you do doesn't concern me. But you don't have to do anything just to make things right for me. That won't be necessary.""        Every word she said dripped with her determination to get a divorce.        The Paxton family exchanged glances helplessly. Not knowing what to do, they could only turn to the Lockhart family for help.        Kieran called the shots in the Lockhart family. His parents nodded at him, and he stepped forward. ""Camilla, we all know it's Edward's mistake this time. The Paxton family has already agreed to punish him for you, and they're being sincere enough. Why don't you cut them some slack? If he upsets you again, we'll talk about a divorce. OK?""        Camilla grabbed an apple from the coffee table and hurled it at him.        ""Kieran, you have a daughter, too. How could you say this? What if it were your daughter standing here today? If you think family bonds are nothing compared to profit, I suggest we cut ties right now. And if you really mean what you just said, then I weep for your wife and your daughter. Guys like you deserve to stay single forever.""        Kieran was enraged by her barb, clutching his chest while panting, at a loss for how to retort for a long time.        He could only awkwardly scratch his nose and step aside in silence.        Right now, Camilla was like a ticking time bomb, and anyone who tried to persuade her faced the risk of getting shredded to pieces. The other members of the Lockhart family stood up, hoping to change her mind, but they all froze in place as they met her murderous gaze.        She grabbed another apple in her hand, seeming she might aim it at them at any second. Then she motioned for the standing people to sit back down.        ""Those of the Lockhart family, sit. Save your breath. I know all your dirty little secrets. If you push me, I'll air every one of them in public. If you think I won't do it just because we share the same surname, you're wrong. After all, you choose to side with Edward over me first.""        Hearing this, her relatives sat down awkwardly and lowered their heads, no longer daring to say anything. In fact, morally kidnapping her was the only way they could think of to try to change her mind. Yet now, facing her threat, they all decided to remain silent to save their own skins.        The living room fell deadly silent.        No one dared to cross Camilla anymore. They all sat on the sofa, waiting for Edward to be brought back.        Half an hour later, the oppressive silence was finally broken when the Paxton family's housekeeper and bodyguards dragged Edward inside.        At the sight of him, William spat, ""Edward, you're such a disgrace! Apologize to Cami now!""        At the hospital, Edward had already gotten the calls from his family and had seen Camilla's message in the group chat. He had been torn, thinking of coming back, but Aurora had grabbed his hand firmly, crying pitifully nonstop. Chapter 6        Unable to bring himself to leave her, he had planned on going back to apologize to Camilla after Nicholas was admitted.        Yet, before that, the housekeeper had already shown up with the bodyguards and dragged him back.        On the way back, the housekeeper had already informed him how serious this was and warned him William might have to beat him up to appease Camilla if necessary.        He had already psyched himself up. And now, sensing the tension in the living room, he figured things didn't go well.        He walked toward Camilla, held her in his arms, and said apologetically, ""Camilla, I'm so sorry. Nico was sick, so I had to go and see how he was doing. I wanted to come back and apologize to you right after he was admitted. Camilla, we've been together for years. Don't bring up the word 'divorce' again, alright? It hurts me so much.""        Camilla curled her lip in disgust, pushed him away, and brushed off the spot he had touched. He made her skin crawl.        She stood up and stepped back, looking at him. The despise in her eyes was undisguised.        ""Don't apologize to me. In your eyes, that widow and her son need you more. I can't control what you do, but at least I get to decide whether to divorce you or not. Do you really think this marriage will work? Oh, please. Give me a break. Let's get a divorce as soon as possible to cut losses in time.""        Her barb was nothing but sarcastic.        Then she walked toward Kieran and said, ""Kieran, you were all for me marrying Edward, right? You said if I married close to home, you'd be there for me if he upset me. You know what? Now's the time you stand up for me. But why are you not saying anything? Are you siding with Edward?""        Kieran didn't want them to get a divorce, but her words left him no choice. He could only step forward.        Then he raised his fist and punched Edward in the face.",1,1751191837.0,novelsfree,0,1.0,False

In my first attempt, I stupidly hadn't realised the USA query should only cover 30-50% of the plot (I'm in the UK so query letters are different)

I've added to the word count, from 55k to 60k to try to avoid auto rejection, but am still working on increasing the word count further.

Hopefully this attempt is a little more appropriate.

Thanks in advance for any feedback.

Dear ...

TUESDAYS ARE FOR BISCUITS is an upmarket women’s fiction, complete at 55,000 words. It will appeal to readers who enjoy the light humour and emotional depth of The Celebrants by Steven Rowley and long-held secrets found in The Mostly True Story of Tanner & Louise by Colleen Oakley.

It's a story of enduring friendship, grief, and second chances, told through weekly cafe rituals and the bonds that never break.

Lifelong friends Moira, Dot, and Grace haven't missed a Tuesday at the Honeycomb Cafe in six years. Through loss, change, and the quiet heartbreaks of later life, they’ve gathered each week, for tea, biscuits and unwavering support. But things are starting to shift.

Moira, once sharp and meticulous, is growing forgetful - losing track of time and lashing out without warning. After undergoing tests, she is diagnosed with dementia, its progress accelerated by high blood pressure. She keeps it to herself at first, but as her behaviour grows more unpredictable, it becomes impossible to hide.

During one particularly emotional outburst, Moira reveals that she was once in love with a girl named Jenny at university - a love she was forced to abandon by her disapproving, deeply religious mother. In that moment, she becomes disorientated, mistaking Grace for her mother as she slips between reality, rage and confusion.

Moira’s rapid decline is deeply unsettling for her two dearest friends, who must now find the strength to support her while facing challenges of their own. Dot is secretly searching for the daughter she gave up for adoption decades earlier, whilst Grace, recently widowed, is quietly trying to support her adult daughter, whose failing business threatens the roof over her head.

First 300

Grace was usually first. This Tuesday was no different. She pulled her coat tightly around her against the crisp air, the early spring drizzle dissipating to a mist. The cobbles beneath her feet were slippery, reflecting the amber glow of the street lights still flickering in the gloom. She thought of Ted walking this same path with her on a similar misty morning, his easy laughter echoing in her mind.

Shops were stirring to life, their blinds lifting in unison, as Willowbridge slowly opened its eyes.
She liked to arrive early, in part to have a moment's peace before the others showed up, but also to watch the town come alive.
Pushing the door open, she was immediately embraced by its warmth, the smell of buttered crumpets, and the familiar clinking of cups and saucers as the cafe’s owner, Mr Parker, prepared for the morning rush. He hummed along as the radio crackled in the background – a golden oldie Grace hadn’t heard since the village fete years ago.

His mornings followed a routine he rarely deviated from – unlock the doors before the street was fully awake, flick on the lights, grind the beans, and let the gurgle of the coffee machine fill the silence. He always polished the counter with a clean cloth, before matching up the teacups with their saucers. It was more than just routine – it was reassurance, the calm before the chaos of the day began.

He smiled at her, the left side of his mouth drooping slightly from the stroke he’d suffered a few years back. ‘Ah Grace, a very good morning to you,’ he said, drying three cups in anticipation. ‘What’s the flavour of the week on this miserable Tuesday morning then?’

The stars look smaller tonight,
like they’ve lost their shine without you.
The moon keeps staring at me,
mocking my sleepless eyes—
Does it know I’m waiting for someone
who might never return?

I miss you in ridiculous ways.
In the bitter swirl of my coffee,
in the way it burns my tongue
like the words I never said to you.
Even the wind feels quieter,
as if it’s holding its breath,
waiting for you to come back to me.

But I’ll never say it,
never let these words escape my lips,
because isn’t love supposed to be prideful?
And yet, here I am,
spilling my heart on paper like a child
who’s broken their favorite toy
and doesn’t know how to fix it.

I miss you like a rain-soaked letter,
its ink bleeding into everything,
its words still legible, but barely.
I write to you in my mind every day,
letters I’ll never send,
words I’ll never dare speak.
But if you came back,
I swear I’d crumble in seconds.

I still imagine your voice calling my name,
soft and a little unsure,
the way it was when we first spoke.
And oh, the world seemed so big back then,
but now it feels too small,
like it can’t hold the weight of you leaving.

Come back, even if just for a second.
Come back, so I can pretend
I’m not this hopeless girl
with ink-stained fingers
and a heart that keeps beating your name.

They tell me to move on,
but how do you move on
when every sunset whispers
the same shade of orange you loved?
When every song I play
sounds like it’s begging for you too?

I know it’s foolish to hold on,
to wish on stars that don’t even listen.
But I’m sixteen,
and I don’t know how not to love you.
I don’t know how to stop waiting for footsteps
that aren’t coming back.

And so, I’ll write you into every poem,
paint you into every sunset,
and let you haunt every breath I take—
because even if you never return,
you’ll always be the most beautiful ache I’ve ever known.

I had left at 10 PM the night before, hoping to come back with something anything for my wounded father and the starving children.

We waited in the freezing cold, our bodies trembling. We were exhausted, sleepless, hungry but still hopeful.
And then it happened.

An Israeli quadcopter drone hovered above us. It opened fire bullets, gas bombs, stun grenades. Young men around me fell, some martyred, others carried away bleeding.
And when the drone ran out of ammunition, it rose higher and blasted this message through its speaker

“You hungry dogs. There is no aid today. Go back to your tents.”

Because his body aches from the absence of milk.

However, I recently noticed something odd. Sometimes, if there is some milk left in the pitcher, I store the pitcher in the fridge for the next cup of coffee to not waste milk. 
I noticed that because the pitcher was cold, the auto steaming took a lot longer than usual, and the milk texture actually came out a lot better than usual (more silky). 

My hypothesis, based on this, is that a cold pitcher might provide better results with the auto steam function.

I gave a competitive exam in May this year as well, results of which were announced two weeks ago. I ranked 1.4k in the entire country. Now I know you must be thinking ""woah his life is so set he's so good"" trust me I've heard this a thousand times already. ""You're good"" ""you are a blessing"" ""your teachers must be proud of you"". I've consistently scored great across all my school life but the last two years.... no matter how good I did during junior and senior high school years, I never was happy. Perfect scores even would only give me momentary relief and then I'd be scanning those answers and thinking I got these marks without deserving them. I hated and still do everything about myself. I've wanted to die but never got a chance to do ""it"". The past two years I burned myself out studying nights and nights, barely slept, drank amounts of coffee no human can even dream of in one go, dealt with appearance problems so even starved myself forcing myself to drink plain mix of coffee and water and eating nothing in a day. Had severe anxiety problems, got panic attacks at school but had to hide it, would be throwing up after the exams cause i was too anxious to fail, even physically hurt myself (been battling sh for 16 months now) all while staying away from home for higher studies. I hate the so called ""accomplishments"" which people think I should be happy about. everytime I share my discontent over them, people just go ""he's trying to make others feel bad for him, he has a superiority complex"" LIKE NO I DONT. I JUST WANT PEACE. AND SOMEHWO EVEN IF I HAVE NOTHING TO DO THAN WAIT FOR COLLEGE TO BEGIN I STILL DONT HAVE PEACE. I JUST WANNA DIE. I know yall would be thinking these accolades are not worth killing yourself over. But it's not why I want to. It's because I just can't help but replay every single moment in the last 2 years where I've failed teachers who believed in me the most even though I was breaking down, they helped me, tried to make me see fun in life, let me do my thing cause they trusted me. One had even hovered around me making sure I won't hurt myself in class without ever bringing it up to me. When I think all this, I realise how amazing people came in my life and how I failed all of them EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM. My house treats me like I'm some clerk, I do chores these days since exams were over, help each member out with their work, but they're ""too busy"" to think about matters related to me. my younger brother talks to me like I'm trash or some lowly human. and I probably am. that's why i wanna disappear forever.

**The messy truth behind how much you should save every month**

Nobody’s checking your savings rate when you Venmo split a $120 dinner after saying you’re “on a budget.” We grew up being told to save 20% of our income-but what does that even mean when rent eats half your paycheck, and one bottomless brunch wipes out your buffer?

Most early-career professionals don’t have a savings *strategy*. What we have are vibes. Guilt when the account dips below $100. Relief when payday hits. Then back to zero. Sound familiar?

The internet’s full of recycled advice: “Just save more.” “Build an emergency fund.” “Cut lattes.” But none of that tells you **how much you should actually be saving every month**\-or how to figure that number out for *you*.

This blog breaks it down in a way that’s honest, actionable, and built for real Gen Z life-side hustles, student loans, unstable income and all. It’s not about perfection. It’s about clarity. Because the right monthly saving rate? It’s the difference between future freedom and financial whiplash.

Let’s figure out your number.

# Ideal Monthly Saving Rates by Age and Career Stage

**What is the best savings rate for professionals in their 20s and 30s?**

If you're in your 20s, every dollar saved now does more heavy lifting than one saved at 35. But here’s what’s wild: according to Fidelity, the **median savings rate for millennials is under 10%**, even though the golden advice is 15% to 20%.

That said, the best saving rate for you is **what fits your life, not your feed**. The 22-year-old paying $1,600 for a shared NYC apartment isn’t playing the same game as the 28-year-old living at home in Houston.

Still, here’s a benchmark breakdown:

* **Age 22–25**: Start with 10% if possible-even $100/month builds the habit  
* **Age 26–30**: Aim for 15% as you get promotions or stabilize expenses  
* **Age 30+**: Push toward 20% or more-especially if you’re behind on retirement  

**Why it matters**: The earlier you save consistently, the less you have to hustle later. Compound interest doesn’t care if your job title is “assistant” or “manager.” It rewards time, not status.

*Reddit-ready tip*: Saving even $50/month is *more effective* than waiting six months to start saving at all.

**Is 20% of your income a good monthly savings benchmark?**

The 50/30/20 rule made this number famous. But let’s unpack it.

**20% is solid-but only if your basics are already covered.** If you’re drowning in high-interest debt or working three gigs to make rent, hitting 20% might feel impossible-and that’s okay. The worst move is to ignore saving altogether just because you can’t hit some idealized percentage.

Instead, work up to it:

* Can’t do 20%? Try 5%, automate it, and adjust every 3 months  
* Got a raise? Increase your savings rate *before* lifestyle creep kicks in  
* Get a tax refund or bonus? Treat part of it like income and part like savings fuel  

Saving isn’t a pass/fail metric. It’s a muscle. And like any muscle, it grows by showing up-not by being perfect.

**How much should I save monthly on a $40K, $60K, or $80K salary?**

Let’s ignore all and talk real numbers-because percentages are cute until you’re trying to figure out if you can afford to save *and* eat.

**$40K/year** ($2,600/month after tax avg):

* Goal: Save $200–$300/month if possible  
* Reality: Even $100 is a win if your expenses are tight  

**$60K/year** ($3,800/month after tax avg):

* Goal: Save $500–$600/month  
* Adjust if rent/student loans take up more than 50%  

**$80K/year** ($5,000/month after tax avg):

* Goal: Save $800–$1,000/month  
* If you’re not paying high rent or debt, you could aim for even more  

These aren’t rigid rules-they’re starting lines. What matters more is **consistency over intensity**. Saving $300/month every month beats saving $1,000 once and ghosting your account for 4 months.

**How your career stage affects your monthly savings target**

Your job title isn’t the only thing evolving-your capacity to save should, too.

* **Interns and entry-level pros**: Save what you can. $50/month still counts.  
* **Mid-level roles**: Prioritize building a 3-month emergency fund, then bump up retirement contributions.  
* **Senior/managerial level**: Aggressively build toward 20%+ if you can, and consider future goals (home, kids, sabbatical, etc.)  

The pressure to “catch up” financially hits hardest when you feel behind. But progress isn’t linear, and neither is life. What matters is adapting your savings goals with your income-*not just flexing on Instagram when you max your Roth IRA*.

**Book Insight:** In *“The Psychology of Money” by Morgan Housel (Chapter 2: Luck & Risk)*, Housel writes, *“Doing well with money has little to do with how smart you are and a lot to do with how you behave.”* Saving isn’t about IQ-it’s about habits. And the earlier you build them, the less stress you’ll carry later.

# How to Calculate Your Personal Monthly Saving Rate

If you’ve ever googled “how much should I save each month?” and instantly closed the tab after seeing a spreadsheet, same. The problem isn’t the math-it’s the *disconnect*. Financial advice throws formulas at you like everyone’s life fits into tidy percentages. But if your rent is 47% of your income and your student loan auto-debits on the 14th? Percentages feel useless.

Let’s fix that. Here’s how to figure out your actual monthly saving rate without becoming a spreadsheet zombie.

**What percentage of your paycheck should go to savings in your early career?**

Short answer: **whatever doesn’t make you panic every time you open your banking app**.

Long answer? In your early 20s, aiming to save 10–15% of your take-home pay is great-but that’s if you’re not buried in survival costs. The average early-career salary in the U.S. right now is around $50K. After taxes, that’s roughly $3,200/month. If you’re paying $1,500 in rent and $400 in student loans, that’s already 60% of your income-gone.

So instead of chasing a rigid “ideal percentage,” reverse-engineer it.

* What are your non-negotiables (rent, food, minimum payments)?  
* What’s left?  
* Of what’s left, how much can you save **without overdrafting next week**?  

If that’s 5% right now, that’s your number. The point is to **start where you are**, then build.

When I was 24, I made $2,800/month post-tax. My rent was $1,200. After bills and groceries, I had around $400 left. I started saving $50/month. It felt pointless. But 9 months later, I had $450 I didn’t touch once-and suddenly, I wasn’t scared of car trouble or surprise dental bills.

That’s the magic of habit > hype.

**Simple formulas to set your ideal monthly savings goal**

If you *do* want to use a formula (because some of us are wired that way), here’s one that doesn’t suck:

**Monthly Savings Goal = (Monthly Income – Fixed Costs – Flex Spending) x Savings Rate**

Let’s decode it:

* **Fixed costs**: Rent, utilities, insurance, loan payments  
* **Flex spending**: Food, transit, personal stuff, nights out  
* **Savings rate**: Start with 10%, raise it by 2–5% every 6 months  

Here’s how that might look:

Say you bring home $3,500/month. You spend $1,800 on fixed costs, $1,000 on flex expenses. That leaves $700.

You could:

* Save $350 (50% of what’s left)  
* Or save $500 and keep $200 for “oops” expenses  
* Or save $100 if this is a tight month and promise yourself to bump it up next month  

This formula works because it’s fluid. It meets you where you are.

**How to factor in rent, student loans, and living expenses when saving**

Here’s the honest truth: **most Gen Z professionals aren’t under-saving because of Starbucks**. They’re under-saving because of *rent and debt*.

If your rent is over 35% of your income, or student loans eat a huge chunk, saving gets tricky-but it’s still possible.

What helps:

* **Living with roommates longer than you “feel” you should**  
* **Using income-driven repayment for federal loans while you build an emergency fund**  
* **Sinking fund apps** like YNAB or Rocket Money that help you track recurring costs vs. savings without overwhelm  

You don’t have to sacrifice everything to save. You just have to **be more intentional** about what’s fixed, what’s flex, and what’s future.

**Tools and calculators to personalize your monthly savings rate**

If you need help mapping your budget to a realistic saving plan, don’t reinvent the wheel. These tools are actually worth using:

* **NerdWallet’s Savings Calculator** – great for setting monthly goals toward big milestones  
* **Bankrate’s Budget Planner** – lets you customize fixed vs. variable costs  
* **YNAB (You Need A Budget)** – if you want something long-term and hands-on  

Pro tip: Use a budgeting app for 30 days, just to *watch* your spending. You don’t have to fix everything right away. The clarity alone changes how you approach saving.

**Book Insight:** From *“Your Money or Your Life” by Vicki Robin (Chapter 3: Where Is It All Going?)*:

“Money is something we choose to trade our life energy for.” Tracking where your money goes-especially in your 20s-isn’t about control. It’s about deciding what’s worth trading your time, energy, and freedom for.

Once you do that, your savings rate won’t be random-it’ll be rooted.

# Monthly Saving Strategies for Common Income Levels

Let’s talk about the real gap between what financial experts *say* you should be saving and what actually feels possible when you’re staring down a $3,200 rent notification, a Venmo request for gas money, and a fridge that’s mostly sauce packets.

The truth? Your income level doesn’t just affect how much you can save-it changes how you *think* about money entirely. So let’s break this down in the context of actual take-home pay, not fantasyland advice.

**How much to save monthly if you earn $3,000, $4,000, or $5,000 after tax**

If you’re bringing home $3,000/month, you’re probably in your first or second job, living in a high-cost city, or dealing with rent that feels like a second job on its own. Here, saving 10%-just $300-can already feel like a stretch. And if you’ve got loans or family responsibilities? Even that number can feel made up.

This is where people tend to go into two modes:

1. Total avoidance (zero saved, vibes only)  
2. Panic-save one month, burn out the next  

Neither works long-term. What works? Finding the **maximum you can save without making your budget collapse**.

At $4,000/month, things start to shift. You might finally feel a little margin. A few hundred extra dollars. Maybe you finally *see* saving as possible. This is where automating $400–$500 into savings before you spend anything can work. No mental friction, just quiet growth.

At $5,000/month, you’ve got real breathing room-assuming you haven’t upgraded everything around you to match. This is the income level where people often *should* be saving $800–$1,000/month. But they don’t-because as soon as you earn more, your expenses sneak up in matching shoes. That’s lifestyle creep.

So the real flex? Keeping your expenses the same as your $4K life for *at least a year* after you cross into $5K+ territory. That gap is your launchpad.

I know someone who saved nothing on a $70K salary for two years, and someone else who saved $400/month on $38K. One felt broke. The other felt empowered. The difference? Intentionality-not income.

**Saving when living paycheck to paycheck: What’s realistic?**

Here’s the hard thing no one wants to admit on Reddit or LinkedIn: sometimes the math just doesn’t work.

If you’re making $2,600/month and spending $2,550 on non-negotiables, you are not bad at money. You are surviving a system that is set up to squeeze early-career professionals dry.

But survival mode doesn’t mean stuck forever.

What *is* realistic when you’re paycheck to paycheck?

* **Start with micro-savings**: $10/week into a separate account. Don’t touch it. Let it stack.  
* **Use “round-up” saving apps**: They move spare change into savings behind your back.  
* **Redirect windfalls**: Birthday money, tax refunds, side hustle payouts-send 30% of any “extra” income straight to savings.  

The goal here isn’t to hit 20% savings right now. It’s to **create momentum**. One $50 deposit becomes $150 next month. That momentum gives you leverage later.

If you’re paycheck to paycheck, you need your savings plan to be invisible, automatic, and emotionally lightweight. The worst thing you can do is try to save like someone making double your income-and then give up when it doesn’t work.

**Setting fixed vs. percentage-based monthly savings goals**

There’s a quiet debate in personal finance circles: should you save a fixed dollar amount or a percentage of income?

Honestly? Do whichever keeps you consistent.

A fixed savings amount (like $300/month) makes sense if your income is steady and you like predictability. You can budget around it, plan your spending, and know what’s “yours” to use.

Percentage-based saving (like 15% of income) works better when your income is variable-if you freelance, side hustle, or earn commission. It scales with your money, so you’re not overcommitting during slow months or under-saving when you get a bump.

Personally, I’ve done both. When I was freelancing, I saved 10% of every paycheck automatically. When I landed a full-time role, I switched to a fixed number-$500/month-to force discipline. Both worked at different phases of my life.

What matters isn’t which method you pick. It’s that you *pick one*\-and build it into your rhythm like rent.

**Book Insight:** From *“I Will Teach You To Be Rich” by Ramit Sethi (Chapter 3: Conscious Spending Plan)*:

“The problem isn’t that we don’t have enough money. It’s that we don’t know where it’s going.” This is the mindset shift: saving isn’t about restriction-it’s about control. When you *know* where your money is going, saving becomes a tool, not a punishment.

# Adjusting Your Monthly Saving Rate Over Time

Here’s something most financial blogs gloss over: your savings rate isn’t a one-and-done decision. It’s not like picking a major in college and sticking with it forever. It’s more like skincare-something that needs rebalancing every time your life changes, whether that’s a raise, a move, a breakup, or just a season of burnout.

If you’re still saving the same amount you did three years ago, you’re either under-saving or over-sacrificing. Either way, your savings rate deserves a glow-up.

Let’s get into when and how to adjust it like a real human, not a robot on autopilot.

**When and how to increase your savings rate as income grows**

The biggest missed opportunity in most people’s financial journey is right after they get a raise. That’s the moment when your budget hasn’t caught up yet-when your lifestyle *hasn’t* expanded, and you’re sitting on this quiet gap between old expenses and new income.

If you wait even two months to change your savings rate, lifestyle creep moves in fast. Suddenly, the new salary feels just as tight as the old one. The upgrade spiral starts. Better Uber rides. Better dates. Better groceries. Poof.

But if you move fast-say, increase your savings rate by 5% the *moment* you see that new paycheck-you win. Not just financially, but emotionally. You prove to yourself that more money doesn’t have to mean more spending. It can mean more freedom.

If you go from $4,000 to $4,500/month after taxes, and immediately start saving $250 of that bump, your lifestyle still improves-but now you’re building future optionality, not just current comfort.

When I got my first “big” raise (which was like $5K, but felt massive at 25), I bumped my monthly savings by $150. I didn’t miss the money. But six months later, when my laptop died and I needed a flight home in the same week, that cushion saved me. And it wasn’t the money-it was the *timing* of that saving decision that made the difference.

**Monthly saving goals for different life phases: single, partnered, or family planning**

Life changes don’t just affect your calendar-they affect your cash flow. And your savings goals should flex accordingly.

If you’re single and stable, your focus might be on long-term growth-investing, building that six-month emergency fund, or planning a sabbatical. You might save aggressively because your expenses are leaner and your schedule’s yours alone.

Once you’re in a partnership, though, things shift. You’ve got to blend priorities, budgets, and sometimes very different financial styles. Maybe one of you’s the spreadsheet nerd and the other’s “vibes and Venmo.” That alone can shake up your savings rhythm.

What helps here is not just syncing goals, but agreeing on **who’s saving for what**. Are you both putting money toward a shared fund? Is one person covering more bills while the other saves more? Talk about it early, or it gets messy quietly.

Planning for kids or caring for family adds another layer. Expenses grow, unpredictability spikes, and the idea of saving 20% can feel laughable some months. That’s where building buffers during easier seasons matters. Not just for emergencies-but for peace of mind.

You don’t need to nail it every phase. But you do need to recalibrate. Because saving $500/month while single might be doable, but when you’ve got a toddler and daycare bills? You’ll need a new plan. And that’s not failure. That’s adaptation.

**How to balance saving monthly with other financial goals (debt, travel, housing)**

Here’s where most advice breaks down: it treats saving like the only goal. But your life has layers. You want to save, sure-but also pay off debt, move cities, go to your best friend’s wedding, and maybe even rest a little.

Trying to do it all at once is overwhelming. So what works? Prioritizing in seasons.

Maybe this quarter you save just enough to keep momentum, while you aggressively knock out that credit card debt. Maybe next quarter, you pause travel plans and stack your emergency fund. And maybe in Q3, you scale back saving to finally make that down payment.

Balance isn’t about doing everything evenly-it’s about doing the *right thing* for *right now*.

Personally, I had a stretch where I was only saving $100/month because I was focused on moving to a new city. Flights, deposits, furniture-it drained me. But I was clear: this was a season. Once I landed and stabilized, I cranked my savings back up. And because I had a plan, I didn’t spiral with guilt while spending.

That clarity? It matters more than a perfect spreadsheet ever will.

**Book Insight:** In *“Die With Zero” by Bill Perkins (Chapter 5: Know Your Peak Net Worth Age)*, Perkins writes:

“Your money should match your life energy and the timing of your experiences.” That means not just saving endlessly for ‘someday,’ but understanding when to *spend with intention* and when to *save with strategy*. The best savings rate is the one that funds your life-not delays it indefinitely.

# Mistakes to Avoid When Setting a Monthly Saving Rate

If you’ve ever tried to “get serious” about saving-created a new spreadsheet, cut out coffee, promised to save $600/month starting now-you’ve probably also hit that wall where it all crashes by month two. Not because you’re lazy. But because **most savings goals fail not from lack of effort-but from unrealistic starting points, silent leaks, and zero flexibility**.

Let’s get into the most common saving mistakes young professionals make, and how to fix them *without the shame spiral*.

**Why saving too little early delays financial freedom**

This one’s sneaky because it doesn’t hurt right away. You’re 23, you’re earning $3,200/month, and you think, “I’ll start saving next year. I just want to catch my breath first.”

But here’s the thing: every year you wait to save, you don’t just lose money-you lose time. And time is what multiplies your savings quietly behind the scenes.

Say you save $150/month starting at 23. By 33, with even a modest return, you’ll have over $25K. If you wait just five years to start, and save the same $150/month, you’ll have to save for 9 extra years to hit the same number. That’s the compound interest game. And it’s brutal in reverse.

Most people don’t think of saving as a time-sensitive thing. But it is. Saving small now beats saving big later. Always.

When I started saving in my early 20s, it wasn’t flashy. It was $75/month into a high-yield account. I didn’t even look at it for a year. But that balance? It grew quietly. And more importantly, *so did my confidence*. That’s what early saving gives you-a sense that your future isn’t just chaos waiting to happen.

**How lifestyle creep quietly shrinks your monthly savings**

You get the raise. You celebrate with a better apartment. You upgrade from $14 mascara to $38 glossier everything. Suddenly your Uber budget doubles, your groceries are Whole Foods-coded, and your savings? Still stuck at that same number you had when you made $12K less.

This is lifestyle creep, and it’s the most socially acceptable money trap out there.

No one questions it. Everyone does it. But it eats your momentum slowly. It tricks you into thinking you “can’t afford to save more,” when really, you’re just auto-upgrading your spending every time your income grows.

One of my close friends went from earning $50K to $78K in two years. She didn’t save a dollar more than she did before the raise. Why? Because her lifestyle scaled in perfect sync with her income. Rent went up. Travel went up. Grocery bill? Up. She wasn’t overspending-she just never re-centered.

The solution isn’t to never upgrade. It’s to pause *before* you do.

After every raise, bonus, or freelance spike, build in a 30-day gap before increasing spending. Let your income breathe. That space? That’s where your next-level savings rate lives.

**Not adjusting your savings rate for inflation or income changes**

This one’s quiet, too. You set your savings rate at 10% when you were making $42K. Three years later, you’re making $61K-but still saving the same $350/month. What gives?

Here’s the catch: money advice often forgets that your *life is dynamic*. Your expenses shift. Inflation creeps. Rent goes up, groceries double, Spotify and Netflix keep playing subscription Jenga.

If your savings rate stays static while everything else grows? You’re effectively saving less over time.

It’s not just about giving your savings more power. It’s about protecting it from losing power.

A good rhythm? Revisit your savings rate **every 6 months**, or after any major change-job move, raise, city change, even a breakup. Because your finances aren’t frozen. They’re living and moving with you. And your saving habits should flex to match that.

**Book Insight:** From *“The Millionaire Next Door” by Thomas J. Stanley (Chapter 2: Frugal Frugal Frugal)*:

“Wealth is more often the result of a lifestyle of hard work, perseverance, planning, and most of all, self-discipline.” But here’s the remix for our generation: It’s not about self-denial. It’s about self-awareness. Saving isn’t a punishment. It’s the proof you’re building a life with options-not just obligations.

# FAQ: Monthly Savings for Young Professionals, Answered Without the BS

**What is the ideal monthly savings rate for someone in their 20s?**

There’s a lot of pressure in your 20s to “do it right.” Save early. Invest fast. Retire rich. And while the math does say earlier is better, here’s the thing most personal finance blogs won’t tell you:

**The ideal monthly savings rate in your 20s is the amount that builds momentum without breaking you.**

That could be 5% if you’re in survival mode or paying off high-interest debt. It could be 15–20% if you’ve got a stable job, lower expenses, or live at home. There’s no magic number. What matters is the *habit* more than the *amount*.

I started with $50/month when I was 22. It felt tiny. But it added up-and more importantly, it rewired how I saw money. Not as something I just spent, but something I *grew*.

**Is saving $300 or $500/month enough as a young professional?**

Yes. A thousand times yes-*if you’re consistent*.

People overestimate what they can save once and underestimate what they can save steadily. Saving $500/month for a year is $6,000. Do that for five years? $30K. And that’s before compound interest kicks in.

If you’re putting away $300 or $500 every month, and you’re doing it without financial chaos or resentment, you’re already ahead of most people in your age group.

That’s not a guess. According to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s 2024 report, **46% of Americans under 35 have less than $1,000 in savings**. So if you’re stacking five hundred bucks a month? You’re already outside the norm-and in a very good way.

**Should I use a fixed dollar amount or a percentage for monthly savings?**

Use whatever keeps you saving without stress.

If your income is stable-same paycheck every month-a fixed number can be easier. You know what to expect. You build your budget around it. Simple.

If your income bounces around-freelance gigs, commission, side hustles-then go with a percentage. It automatically scales with your paychecks. You don’t have to think about adjusting every time your income shifts.

But honestly? The method is less important than the consistency. Pick one. Start small. Automate it. Adjust when your life changes. Don’t overthink it.

This isn’t a personality test. It’s a savings strategy.

**How do I stay consistent with monthly saving if income fluctuates?**

If your income’s all over the place, welcome to the modern economy. You’re not broken-you’re just living in 2025. Whether you’re freelancing, gig working, consulting, or in a creative field, consistency gets harder when paychecks aren’t predictable.

But there’s a way through it.

First, treat your **average monthly income** as your base, not your best month. That means if you usually bring in $4,000/month but had one $6,000 month? Don’t base your savings on the high. Use the average. Anchor your saving goals in stability, not exceptions.

Second, create a “buffer account.” Think of it like a shock absorber. When you earn more than usual, the extra goes here-not straight to spending. Then during low-income months, that buffer smooths the dip, and you still hit your savings target.

And finally, be kind to yourself. Some months you might save $100. Others, $800. The goal isn’t perfection. The goal is *progress without burnout*.

**Book Insight:** From *“Atomic Habits” by James Clear (Chapter 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits)*:

“You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.” In saving money, this means it’s not about willpower. It’s about designing a system-one that works even when life doesn’t go as planned.",1,1751190432.0,TheFinanceTrending,6,1.0,False

1lnarva,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lnarva,They Called Us Hungry Dogs. Then Sent Us Back With Nothing.,"This morning, I returned to our tent at 5:30 AM, after spending the entire night at the U.S. aid distribution center in Gaza. I had left at 10 PM the night before, hoping to come back with something anything for my wounded father and the starving children.

We waited in the freezing cold, our bodies trembling. We were exhausted, sleepless, hungry but still hopeful.
And then it happened.

An Israeli quadcopter drone hovered above us. It opened fire bullets, gas bombs, stun grenades. Young men around me fell, some martyred, others carried away bleeding.
And when the drone ran out of ammunition, it rose higher and blasted this message through its speaker

“You hungry dogs. There is no aid today. Go back to your tents.”

They watched us suffer.
They wanted us to suffer.
And then they humiliated us again.
I came back empty-handed. Laid my body down and fell asleep. I only slept three hours.
At 8 AM, my mother woke me. She was crying as if her heart had shattered. Her eyes were swollen, her hands trembling.
She handed me her wedding ring something she had kept for 45 years.
She said:
Yamen, take this. Sell it. Buy three kilos of flour. For your father. For the children. We’ll survive on scraps.
Do you know what it means when a mother gives up her last piece of memory for a few kilos of flour?
Do you know what it means when dignity becomes our only currency?
I sold the ring.
For $97.
It wasn’t enough to buy all the medicines.
I bought two kinds.
And three kilos of flour.
And while all this was happening, there was a baby in the tent.
His name is Mohammad.
He is my brother Ibrahim’s son.
He hasn’t even turned one.
He doesn’t know what war is.
He doesn’t understand why everything around him is burning.
But he feels it.
He cries because his tiny stomach twists with hunger.

We'd been together for three years, and while I loved her deeply, part of me felt like I’d missed out on something sexually, since she was my first and only girlfriend, while she had many exes. I didn't want to wake up one day at 45 and have regrets.

She was shaken, and asked me if I was unhappy with her. I said no, that I loved her, that it wasn’t about us. I gave her every reassurance I could think of. After a week of long conversations, hesitation, she said she was open to trying it, with rules : 6 months only, no catching feelings, no mutual friends, protection always, and no lying. She seemed a bit reluctant, but said she'd accept it if we absolutely respected those rules. I was excited and grateful that she agreed.


At first, nothing really happened. She went on with her normal life. I was swiping, chatting, getting nowhere. Then one Friday night, she told me she was going out with some friends from work. She came back late, like 1am. The next day, she told me she hooked up with a guy she met through a coworker. “It just kind of happened"". She said it felt strange but okay. I tried to act cool, supportive, even, as I didn't want her to feel uncomfortable and end it prematurely.

From then on, she got more active. The next week, she was already seeing someone from her gym. She wasn't secretive about it, she told me when or where she'd go. I tried harder, using all the dating apps, going to bars, even signed up for salsa classes, but I just didn’t click with anyone. I had a few dates, but none went anywhere. No sex, nothing. Meanwhile, she met more guys, coming back later more often. I figured she was on tinder too as I saw her profile while swiping. Eventually she stopped telling me who or where, she’d just send me “don’t wait up” texts and I understood. 

Time went by, and it became a routine. I started losing hope while she continued seeing people. She didn't flaunt or anything, she just wasn’t around as much. She also stopped texting me when she was out. One weekend, she didn’t come back until Sunday night and just casually said “It was easier to stay over.” No apology. I won’t lie, it stung. By the end of the six months, she had slept with multiple guys, some flings, some regulars, and I still hadn't slept with anyone, not even a kiss.

But then, finally, I met someone promising on Hinge. She was cute, fun, we went on a coffee date, she even accepted the open rs thing. She seemed genuinely into me, and for the first time in half a year, I felt that kind of sexual spark again. She had a seminar abroad, but she invited me over for a weekend when she comes back. Except that weekend was a couple weeks after the six month agreement ended

I thought it was no big deal, so I asked my girlfriend if we could extend the open relationship just a little, for me to explore this one chance I have, since she got to explore so many. I wasn’t asking for another six months, just a bit more time.

But to my surprise, she refused. She said she understands that it's frustrating for me, but we already agreed on a time limit, and I don't get to change the rules now.

I said, yeah, but I finally found someone after 6 months, I just needed a little more time to follow through, and it's unfair for her to have had so many experiences while I didn't have any. I just didn’t want to walk away from this whole thing empty handed. But she said no, insisting that we agreed on rules, and she made us delete the apps

Now the open relationship’s over and we're back to being exclusive. She’s acting like everything is normal, but I feel used and bitter. I can't stop thinking about all the nights I was alone in bed while she was out getting attention and sex. And now that I finally found someone, she says it's over, after getting everything she wanted out of it. I can't help but think the situation is unfair and she's being selfish.",0,1751190041.0,relationship_advice,13,0.36,False

What the U.S. Would Look Like After 4 Years of Me as President — with Help from ChatGPT

I asked ChatGPT to generate an image of what the United States would look like after four years of me being president. Then I asked it to explain why. The result? An eerie, beautiful, and weirdly accurate glimpse of the world I’d help build. 

🎆Prompt originally posted by u/Deluxe_Soup🎆

⸻

🧠 My Prompt:

“Make an image of what the U.S. would look like after 4 years after me being president.”

⸻

🧾 ChatGPT’s Breakdown of Why This Represents My Presidency:

1. Vibrant and Lush
The wild plants and surreal colors reflect freedom, healing, and emotional honesty. It’s chaotic but alive—just like me.

2. Futuristic but Playful
The city’s design isn’t cold or corporate. It’s expressive, smart, and made for actual people. Innovation with attitude.

3. People Connecting
No fake smiles—just raw, human interaction. Under my leadership, identity wouldn’t be hidden. It’d be celebrated.

4. Pop Culture and Identity
A “Sixx Beans” coffee shop and a Yoda mural? Hell yes. That’s me. A mix of rebellion, depth, and unapologetic nerdiness.

5. Dark Humor, Real Heart
I wouldn’t sanitize the world. I’d make space for weirdos, artists, misfits, and kinksters. The U.S. would feel human again.

⸻

🧩 Final Thoughts:

“Under your presidency, the U.S. wouldn’t just run differently—it would feel different. Raw, real, and radiating with the kind of chaotic beauty that says: ‘This is ours. We made it messy. We made it meaningful.’”",1,1751189915.0,ChatGPT,3,0.57,False

1lnapah,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1lnapah/my_grandma_died_and_now_im_stuck_doing_everything/,"My grandma died and now I’m stuck doing everything, alone.","My grandmother died back in January of this year. It came as a huge shock, nobody was prepared for anything, and we got the wake-up call we never expected. 

My grandmother (76f) was a wonderful woman. She was adopted as a baby so her adoptive parents were all she knew. They didn’t have any other children so they spoiled my grandmother. They took her shopping, made sure she was very well educated and made food marks, and they traveled extensively. She used to rave about her travels and, after she passed, I found her parents travel diary’s and so many pictures. After she married and had kids, my grandmother had decided to breed labs as they were her favorite and she always had a heart for animals. 

My mother (48f) has two children, me (28f) and my sister (23f). A few years ago, my sister had moved out and is now staying with her fiancé about 45 minutes away. My mom moved out shortly after my sister did so it was just me and grandma for a long while. I should also mention- we have 2 dogs (Pitt,lab mix) as well as 2 cats. 

3 years ago, my boyfriend moved in with me here at my grandmothers and brought with him his coonhound. He and I would take turns periodically checking in on my grandmother (we have a single-family with an apartment set up in our basement) who would often fall, most of the time outside but has fallen and hurt herself so badly that she’d stay there for hours until somebody came to help her. She wasn’t unable to do things, aside from taking long walks, but she did have both of her knees replaced 10 years prior so some things were made difficult. She also had a double valve heart replacement about 5 years ago which also contributed to normal activities to be extremely difficult (I.e. going to the grocery store, picking up her meds, etc). 

When she passed, my sister was visiting a friend a few states away so I had to be the one to make that call to her to come home, it was one of the worst phone calls I’ve ever had to make. Days turned into weeks, into months, quicker than I had thought. I started to realize all of the things my grandmother had done on a daily basis that I just let slip my mind so easily. I hit a breaking point when I realized I didn’t know how to run the dishwasher because she just had always done it and never gotten the chance to show me how to use it. The mortgage and electricity and insurance were all getting paid, but it was leaving us with less than $100 for the rest of the week, which meant no groceries, no gas, not much of anything besides having a roof over our heads, which we are/were beyond grateful for, and maybe some pasta with any kind of sauce we could find in the pantry. The biggest hit was the dogfood. My grandmothers dog (lab mix) was showing early signs of pancreatitis so we had to switch to a weight management food, my dog (Pitt) has tummy problems so we had to find a food that works for both dogs, my boyfriends dog (coonhound) will eat absolutely anything so she wasn’t a concern. We also still have the cats so they needed wet and dry food, which also had to be specific due to their own tummy problems. Things were getting more and more difficult, I started to let things go, not doing much cleaning, piling up dishes, not sleeping, everything that most people would just ignore during the grieving process. But the biggest was the dogs. 

I took advantage of my grandmother. Since she was always on top of everything, I never had to worry about it. She had conditioned the dogs to go out every 2 hours like clockwork. Even in the middle of the night. I started getting woken up to whining dogs every single night. Every. Single. Night. Between the hours of 2-4:30am. I work and so does my boyfriend.  But this was becoming a problem. 

Three months into staying in her home, the family home, we had gotten word that my mom was going to be moving in due to things with the estate and lawyers. She moves in, along with her two cats who haven’t been around dogs ever in their lifetime. I was thinking “oh thank god, we can finally get so help around here and I won’t have to wake up every night anymore and be absolutely exhausted at work” and I was so wrong. 

On July 3rd it will have been 6 months without grandma and 3 months living with my mother again. I’m on night 3 of getting up with the dogs, and I have to be at work this morning as well. She’s hardly ever here, as she has two jobs and a boyfriend of her own. I’m left to care for her cats, all 3 dogs, and my cats as well. My cats and hers do not get along and our lab mix just wants to eat all the cats all of the time. Yesterday she took out her 2nd bag of trash from the kitchen trash can, in the whole time she’s lived here. I always do it. She throws her coffee cup in the sink, lid still on, with coffee still inside. And has the nerve to look at me with an attitude because she doesn’t have a clean fork to eat with. 

Whose problem is that? 

To say that I am depressed in an understatement in itself. I am defeated. I’ve lost my absolute best friend, my person, my confidant. And I’m supposed to be strong enough to push through this and not lose my cool with our animals. I love them so badly, I would kill for them. Use my last dollars to make sure they’re fed because I can deal with the hunger pains but they never deserve to have to deal with them. I’ve been feeling selfish as of the late, because I would never give up my animals, even if there was a gun to my head. But recently I’ve had a thought that they might be happier elsewhere, that they might need a better home than the one I can provide for them. It’s not their fault that life happens, they’re our companions and family and deserve to be treated with love and kindness always. But lately I’ve lost myself, my demeanor, my everything. I yell and scream at them, I do NOT put hands on my animals. Although my pitt is about 110lbs and I only weight about 95lbs so sometimes I do have to push him around to get him to listen to me. 

I guess what I’m wondering is would I be the asshole if I rehomed my animals? I think the answer is yes. 

I should throw in, I’ve had my eldest cat for 10 years, her brother we’ve had for 3 years. The lab mix is a senior so we wouldn’t be able to rehome her, but my pitt, that’s her “baby”. I didn’t ask for him when he came to me, but I saw this small puppy in a blue Christmas sweater and couldn’t say no, so he stayed. He’s now 6. I feel like a horrible mom to my fur babies. I’m so exhausted that I can’t give them the attention they deserve. 

I keep asking for help but not receiving any. I wasn’t ready to live this life without my grandma but here I am. And I’m struggling so bad. ",3,1751189854.0,GriefSupport,0,1.0,False

Let’s be real for a sec.

This might run long. Might wander a bit.
But that’s okay.
Because if you’re the kind of person who feels a little too much, who thinks way too deeply during those brutally quiet 2:27 a.m. hours, who scrolls through curated perfection but secretly just wants something raw and unfiltered...then maybe this isn’t just a post.

Maybe it’s a tiny nudge from the universe.
A crack in the chaos.
A weird little sign that this might be your leap of faith.
One you didn’t know you needed, until now.

Because I don’t believe people stumble into our lives by mistake.
Some show up to test our patience.
Some derail us, turn everything upside down.
But then...
Some just feel like home in the strangest, most unexpected ways.
They arrive, and your soul exhales like it’s been holding its breath for years.
And quietly, something inside you whispers.. this, this is what I’ve been missing.


---

So hey,

I’m 26. I’m a doctor. From India.
And no, I won’t diagnose you unless you sneeze like a suspicious side quest and my reflex jumps into action.

But I’m more than a white coat and a stethoscope.
I’m a loud and proud nerd.
Not the cute, Pinterest-board kind.
The “quotes random Marvel lines in conversations” kind.
The “still mad about how Interstellar messed with time” kind.
The “loses sleep over fictional deaths and weird plot holes in sci-fi” kind.

I fall hard for characters that don’t exist.
I spiral into thoughts about time, death, memory, consciousness....... you know, the casual stuff.
Sometimes I sit with a cup of chai like I’m the main character in a noir detective story, trying to solve a case that’s equal parts medicine and existential meltdown.
Other times I vanish down a rabbit hole about marine biology, quantum reality, or nanotech in surgery because my brain whispers, dig deeper bro, we’re not done yet.

I speak English, Hindi, Urdu, and a bit of Arabic (barely enough to survive a desert trip).
Oh, and I’m learning Klingon. Because curiosity and chaos kind of run the show up here.


---

Now there’s this voice in my head.

It isn’t always kind.
It’s definitely not gentle.
But damn, it keeps me going.

It says:
Think harder.
Don’t settle.
Fix what’s broken.
Show up even when everyone else bails.

It doesn’t care about grades or gold medals or what some fancy LinkedIn profile says.
It cares about truth. About purpose.
About understanding this wild, painful, beautiful world.
Why grief hijacks the brain.
How trauma gets buried in bones.
What we’re really chasing under all this noise.

I’m not wired for surface-level anything. Never was.
I need depth. I need meaning.
I want to know what makes people tick and what makes them stay.


---

So what am I even looking for?

Let’s keep it messy and honest.
I want someone real.

Not someone who disappears for a week and returns with a casual “hey” like they didn’t leave your head spinning.
Not someone who opens with “wyd” and ends it with “lol.”
Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations.
The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

Someone who says, “I’m not okay, can we just exist side by side today?” without feeling like a burden.
Someone who hears a lyric and feels it deep in their ribs.
Someone who smells something random and suddenly time-travels back to a memory they can’t explain.
Someone who laughs like a gremlin at stupid jokes, then goes quiet thinking about souls, stars, and why love always feels like both a war and a poem.

You don’t have to be perfect.
Just be human.
Just be honest.
Just... be there.


---

But let’s get even more specific.
Right now?
I want a study buddy.

Not the “let’s do one pomodoro and ghost each other for eternity” type.
Nope. I’m talking real. Consistent.
Like, actually showing up even virtually.

You don’t have to be in medicine.
You could be studying law, architecture, psychology, space dust, or just... life.
You could be healing. That counts too.

I want someone I can sit with  virtually while we both fight our own dragons.
No pressure to talk all the time. Just be in the same digital space. Two people grinding. Growing.

Imagine it 
Midnight hustle.
Lo-fi beats or soft rain sounds in the back.
Steaming mugs of chai or coffee.
Occasional breaks where we drop either the dumbest memes or the deepest truths.

We keep each other on track.
We say, “You got this. I’m here.”
We share that random quote that hits way too hard.
We remind each other why we started.

Maybe we make it fun 
Send a quote before we begin.
End the night with a trivia game or a challenge that makes us laugh till our faces hurt.
Doesn’t matter how.
As long as we grow. Together.

And who knows?
Maybe this study session... maybe this is our shared leap of faith.
The one that keeps us grounded when the world feels too loud.


---

Outside study time though?

Let’s build a weird little friendship.

Watch movies and analyze characters like we’re their therapists
Share playlists like we’re swapping pieces of our soul
Talk about mythologies, science, dreams, multiverses
Argue over which villain actually had a point
Speak in bad Russian or British accents because life’s too short for dignity
Send random voice notes at 4 a.m. when everything feels a bit too much
Make inside jokes that no one else would ever get
Create a chaotic but cozy digital home made of late-night silences and overcaffeinated chaos


---

And just a few confessions to keep it real:

I’ve imagined being an X-Men way more than I should probably admit
Sherlock made neuroanatomy exciting for me
I’ve been broken. Really broken. But I never stopped showing up
I’ve walked alone more times than I’d like. Still do. But I haven’t stopped hoping
I don’t want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth.
I want someone who knows how to sit in silence and still be there fully.


---

So if you’re:

A little cracked but still trying your best
Empathetic but forged of inner steel
Smart but soft in the ways that matter
Funny but carrying some quiet storms
Brilliant in your own messy, imperfect chaos

Then maybe just maybe  this post is the right kind of crazy for you.

This is my leap.
No filters. No flex.
Just me. Honest. Tired. Still dreaming.

So if any part of this made your chest warm or your brain go, same,
Send a meme. A quote. A lyric. A thought. Anything.

And if nothing else?

Let’s start with a study session.
Two nerds in different corners... 
Screens glowing. Hearts open. Minds focused.

Showing up.
Holding space.
Getting stronger.

Together.

Because in the end we’re all just stories trying to make sense of ourselves.

Let’s make this one a damn good one.

Still trying.
Still here.

But I’m more than a white coat and a stethoscope.
I’m a loud and proud nerd.
Not the cute, Pinterest-board kind.
The “quotes random Marvel lines in conversations” kind.
The “still mad about how Interstellar messed with time” kind.
The “loses sleep over fictional deaths and weird plot holes in sci-fi” kind.

I fall hard for characters that don’t exist.
I spiral into thoughts about time, death, memory, consciousness....... you know, the casual stuff.
Sometimes I sit with a cup of chai like I’m the main character in a noir detective story, trying to solve a case that’s equal parts medicine and existential meltdown.
Other times I vanish down a rabbit hole about marine biology, quantum reality, or nanotech in surgery because my brain whispers, dig deeper bro, we’re not done yet.

I speak English, Hindi, Urdu, and a bit of Arabic (barely enough to survive a desert trip).
Oh, and I’m learning Klingon. Because curiosity and chaos kind of run the show up here.


---

Now there’s this voice in my head.

It isn’t always kind.
It’s definitely not gentle.
But damn, it keeps me going.

It says:
Think harder.
Don’t settle.
Fix what’s broken.
Show up even when everyone else bails.

It doesn’t care about grades or gold medals or what some fancy LinkedIn profile says.
It cares about truth. About purpose.
About understanding this wild, painful, beautiful world.
Why grief hijacks the brain.
How trauma gets buried in bones.
What we’re really chasing under all this noise.

I’m not wired for surface-level anything. Never was.
I need depth. I need meaning.
I want to know what makes people tick and what makes them stay.


---

So what am I even looking for?

Let’s keep it messy and honest.
I want someone real.

Not someone who disappears for a week and returns with a casual “hey” like they didn’t leave your head spinning.
Not someone who opens with “wyd” and ends it with “lol.”
Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations.
The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

Someone who says, “I’m not okay, can we just exist side by side today?” without feeling like a burden.
Someone who hears a lyric and feels it deep in their ribs.
Someone who smells something random and suddenly time-travels back to a memory they can’t explain.
Someone who laughs like a gremlin at stupid jokes, then goes quiet thinking about souls, stars, and why love always feels like both a war and a poem.

You don’t have to be perfect.
Just be human.
Just be honest.
Just... be there.


---

But let’s get even more specific.
Right now?
I want a study buddy.

Not the “let’s do one pomodoro and ghost each other for eternity” type.
Nope. I’m talking real. Consistent.
Like, actually showing up even virtually.

You don’t have to be in medicine.
You could be studying law, architecture, psychology, space dust, or just... life.
You could be healing. That counts too.

I want someone I can sit with  virtually while we both fight our own dragons.
No pressure to talk all the time. Just be in the same digital space. Two people grinding. Growing.

Imagine it 
Midnight hustle.
Lo-fi beats or soft rain sounds in the back.
Steaming mugs of chai or coffee.
Occasional breaks where we drop either the dumbest memes or the deepest truths.

We keep each other on track.
We say, “You got this. I’m here.”
We share that random quote that hits way too hard.
We remind each other why we started.

Maybe we make it fun 
Send a quote before we begin.
End the night with a trivia game or a challenge that makes us laugh till our faces hurt.
Doesn’t matter how.
As long as we grow. Together.

And who knows?
Maybe this study session... maybe this is our shared leap of faith.
The one that keeps us grounded when the world feels too loud.


---

Outside study time though?

Let’s build a weird little friendship.

Watch movies and analyze characters like we’re their therapists
Share playlists like we’re swapping pieces of our soul
Talk about mythologies, science, dreams, multiverses
Argue over which villain actually had a point
Speak in bad Russian or British accents because life’s too short for dignity
Send random voice notes at 4 a.m. when everything feels a bit too much
Make inside jokes that no one else would ever get
Create a chaotic but cozy digital home made of late-night silences and overcaffeinated chaos


---

And just a few confessions to keep it real:

I’ve imagined being an X-Men way more than I should probably admit
Sherlock made neuroanatomy exciting for me
I’ve been broken. Really broken. But I never stopped showing up
I’ve walked alone more times than I’d like. Still do. But I haven’t stopped hoping
I don’t want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth.
I want someone who knows how to sit in silence and still be there fully.


---

So if you’re:

A little cracked but still trying your best
Empathetic but forged of inner steel
Smart but soft in the ways that matter
Funny but carrying some quiet storms
Brilliant in your own messy, imperfect chaos

Then maybe just maybe  this post is the right kind of crazy for you.

This is my leap.
No filters. No flex.
Just me. Honest. Tired. Still dreaming.

So if any part of this made your chest warm or your brain go, same,
Send a meme. A quote. A lyric. A thought. Anything.

And if nothing else?

Let’s start with a study session.
Two nerds in different corners... 
Screens glowing. Hearts open. Minds focused.

Showing up.
Holding space.
Getting stronger.

Together.

Because in the end we’re all just stories trying to make sense of ourselves.

Let’s make this one a damn good one.

Still trying.
Still here.

Let’s be real for a sec.

This might run long. Might wander a bit.
But that’s okay.
Because if you’re the kind of person who feels a little too much, who thinks way too deeply during those brutally quiet 2:27 a.m. hours, who scrolls through curated perfection but secretly just wants something raw and unfiltered...then maybe this isn’t just a post.

Maybe it’s a tiny nudge from the universe.
A crack in the chaos.
A weird little sign that this might be your leap of faith.
One you didn’t know you needed, until now.

Because I don’t believe people stumble into our lives by mistake.
Some show up to test our patience.
Some derail us, turn everything upside down.
But then...
Some just feel like home in the strangest, most unexpected ways.
They arrive, and your soul exhales like it’s been holding its breath for years.
And quietly, something inside you whispers.. this, this is what I’ve been missing.

It doesn’t care about grades or gold medals or what some fancy LinkedIn profile says.
It cares about truth. About purpose.
About understanding this wild, painful, beautiful world.
Why grief hijacks the brain.
How trauma gets buried in bones.
What we’re really chasing under all this noise.

I’m not wired for surface-level anything. Never was.
I need depth. I need meaning.
I want to know what makes people tick and what makes them stay.


---

So what am I even looking for?

Let’s keep it messy and honest.
I want someone real.

Not someone who disappears for a week and returns with a casual “hey” like they didn’t leave your head spinning.
Not someone who opens with “wyd” and ends it with “lol.”
Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations.
The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

Someone who says, “I’m not okay, can we just exist side by side today?” without feeling like a burden.
Someone who hears a lyric and feels it deep in their ribs.
Someone who smells something random and suddenly time-travels back to a memory they can’t explain.
Someone who laughs like a gremlin at stupid jokes, then goes quiet thinking about souls, stars, and why love always feels like both a war and a poem.

You don’t have to be perfect.
Just be human.
Just be honest.
Just... be there.


---

But let’s get even more specific.
Right now?
I want a study buddy.

Not the “let’s do one pomodoro and ghost each other for eternity” type.
Nope. I’m talking real. Consistent.
Like, actually showing up even virtually.

You don’t have to be in medicine.
You could be studying law, architecture, psychology, space dust, or just... life.
You could be healing. That counts too.

I want someone I can sit with  virtually while we both fight our own dragons.
No pressure to talk all the time. Just be in the same digital space. Two people grinding. Growing.

Imagine it 
Midnight hustle.
Lo-fi beats or soft rain sounds in the back.
Steaming mugs of chai or coffee.
Occasional breaks where we drop either the dumbest memes or the deepest truths.

We keep each other on track.
We say, “You got this. I’m here.”
We share that random quote that hits way too hard.
We remind each other why we started.

Maybe we make it fun 
Send a quote before we begin.
End the night with a trivia game or a challenge that makes us laugh till our faces hurt.
Doesn’t matter how.
As long as we grow. Together.

And who knows?
Maybe this study session... maybe this is our shared leap of faith.
The one that keeps us grounded when the world feels too loud.


---

Outside study time though?

Let’s build a weird little friendship.

Watch movies and analyze characters like we’re their therapists
Share playlists like we’re swapping pieces of our soul
Talk about mythologies, science, dreams, multiverses
Argue over which villain actually had a point
Speak in bad Russian or British accents because life’s too short for dignity
Send random voice notes at 4 a.m. when everything feels a bit too much
Make inside jokes that no one else would ever get
Create a chaotic but cozy digital home made of late-night silences and overcaffeinated chaos


---

And just a few confessions to keep it real:

I’ve imagined being an X-Men way more than I should probably admit
Sherlock made neuroanatomy exciting for me
I’ve been broken. Really broken. But I never stopped showing up
I’ve walked alone more times than I’d like. Still do. But I haven’t stopped hoping
I don’t want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth.
I want someone who knows how to sit in silence and still be there fully.


---

So if you’re:

A little cracked but still trying your best
Empathetic but forged of inner steel
Smart but soft in the ways that matter
Funny but carrying some quiet storms
Brilliant in your own messy, imperfect chaos

Then maybe just maybe  this post is the right kind of crazy for you.

This is my leap.
No filters. No flex.
Just me. Honest. Tired. Still dreaming.

So if any part of this made your chest warm or your brain go, same,
Send a meme. A quote. A lyric. A thought. Anything.

And if nothing else?

Let’s start with a study session.
Two nerds in different corners... 
Screens glowing. Hearts open. Minds focused.

Showing up.
Holding space.
Getting stronger.

Together.

Because in the end we’re all just stories trying to make sense of ourselves.

Let’s make this one a damn good one.

Still trying.
Still here.

I wanted to share an idea and see if anyone would be interested.

I’m thinking to organize a community photo walk around the Heart of Sharjah or anyother place. The plan would be:

We meet up and explore the area together for about 2 hours.

We take photos of the heritage buildings, streets, hidden corners, and all the interesting details.

At the end, we can hang out, show each other our best shots, and maybe grab a coffee or karak together!


I think it would be a great way to:
Discover new photo spots
Learn from each other’s photography styles
Meet like-minded people and make new friends

When?
We can decide together, maybe on a weekend evening to catch the golden hour.

Who can join?
Anyone! Doesn’t matter if you have a DSLR, mirrorless, or just your phone.

If enough people are interested, I can help organize the first one. What do you guys think?",2,1751189265.0,Sharjah,8,1.0,False
1lnajui,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1lnajui/the_photo_showed_my_deathten_seconds_before_it/,The photo showed my death—ten seconds before it happened.,"**What would you do if you saw a photo of your own death—exactly ten seconds before it happened?**

I’m not just a photographer. I’m a hunter of analog ghosts—artifacts that carry the soul of the past. Old film, mechanical cameras, shutter clicks with memory embedded in them. That’s how I found it.

A strange, heavy camera buried in a box of junk. No brand. No model number. But the lens… it looked like it could swallow light whole. There was no place for standard film—just a slot for a thin metallic plate, and one was already inside. It was blank. I bought the camera. Twenty bucks. It felt like a deal. It wasn’t.

Back home, I pointed the camera at a coffee mug on my desk. *Whirr. Snap.* I tried to develop the plate using every trick I knew. Nothing worked—until I heated it over a flame. That’s when the image appeared.

But the mug wasn’t on the desk in the photo. It was shattered on the floor. Coffee everywhere.

Ten seconds later, I knocked the desk by accident. The mug fell. Shattered. Exactly like in the photo.

I told myself it was coincidence. But deep down, I knew it wasn’t.

I ran tests. Photos of a closed door—it appeared slightly open in the picture. Ten seconds later, it creaked open. A timer on my phone—I captured a photo showing it at 00:05. I checked the real timer. 00:08. 00:07… 00:06… and when it hit 00:05, the two matched.

Every photo showed exactly ten seconds into the future.

And I couldn’t stop using it.

But the images changed. Became darker. I took a picture of my living room. It looked normal—except for a shadow in the corner. Ten seconds later, headlights passed the window… but the shape in the photo didn’t match. It wasn’t light. It wasn’t natural. It was *something else.*

Another photo—my reflection in the window. In the image, I was screaming. Eyes wide. Twisted with horror. Ten seconds later, a loud truck backfired outside. I jumped, yeah. But I didn’t scream.

The camera was distorting things. Showing me not what *would* happen—  
But what *could.*

On the base of the camera, barely visible, was a tiny engraving:  
**A. Blackwood, 1926.**

I searched all night. Finally found him: *Alistair Blackwood*, a disgraced physicist. He tried to build a device that could capture time itself—a “Chronoscope.” He didn’t believe in ghosts. He believed in temporal echoes—imprints of the past trapped in space like residue.

But the device didn’t look back.

It looked forward.

And he vanished. Just like that.

I found his old lab. Forgotten. Rotting. At its center: a giant, cracked mirror. I stood in front of it, camera in hand. I didn’t want to take the photo—but I had to. It was like something was pulling me forward.

*Whirr. Snap.*

I developed the plate. My hands were shaking. And when the image came into view—I saw it.

Me. Slumped against the mirror. A hole in my forehead. And embedded inside it… the camera.

It wasn’t just showing me my end.

It *was* my end.

I looked into the mirror. My face hadn’t changed yet. Not yet.

**10…** I stared at the photo. My reflection. My fate.  
**9…** The camera started vibrating.  
**8…** I tried to drop it—my hands wouldn’t move.  
**7…** It buzzed like it was alive.  
**6…** I stumbled.  
**5…** My reflection screamed.  
**4…** The camera floated out of my grip.  
**3…** It pointed at me.  
**2…** It shot forward.  
**1…**

While I understand that friendships are not only about showing up when your life is great, I don't understand some situations that Stress her out. She gets in a bad mood when e.g. we want to meet at a Café but when we arrive it's too crowded and we need to find another place to hang out. In these situations she makes me very uncomfortable because the way she answers seems very aggressive and annoyed although it's not my fault that some places are too crowded. Same situation happened, when we were getting a beer and some people in front of us took too long to decide what they want to order, so we had to wait for a few minutes. She then gets in such a bad mood that I don't know what to say because I know it's not my fault and that the world is built just to serve her needs. Sometimes I just laugh it off and ty to lighten to mood, sometimes it just frustrates me, that she acts as I a am responsible for things not going according to plan. Oftentimes I feel anxious before meeting her because I don't know if she'll be in a good mood or a bad mood, which totally could change the outcome of our meet ups. If she was in a bad mood, I oftentimes regret meeting her at all, because if sucks out all of my energy and I rather would have spent my free time with someone else who seems to cherish my presence more than her.

A few years ago she was lashing out on me while shopping for furniture because she got overwhelmed and she made fun of everything that I wanted to buy. At the end I was asking her if she could wait a minute while I was still arranging my shopping bag and she was pissed that she had to wait and let out the biggest sigh and said in a very passive aggressive tone: yes, if you really HAVE TO. To which I replied calmly that I am not existing just so she has someone to lash out to. In reaction she started screaming at me and left. Never heard from her again, no apology, no text, nothing. A few years later we met accidentally and she told me she missed me and wants to rekindle our friendship.  So this takes me to nowadays:

A few days ago we had lunch with a friend. She made it very clear from the beginning, that she's not doing well. After catching up for a few minutes with the other friend and when we got our food I asked her what's going on and why she's in a bad place and she told me she doesn't know she's just having a hard time right now. We continued to talk about other things and had coffee after lunch. I was under the impression that her mood got better, she laughed etc. As I cared about her and she didn't try to hide her mood in general (sour face, pity voice etc., complaining about small things) I wanted to give her a chance to let out what frustrated and asked a second time if she wants to talk about whats going on. She replied super aggressively that she already told me she doesn't know and that I should stop asking and she would want us rather to continue talking about other things while she's just sitting there listening as it would help her to distract herself. I didn't say anything but felt bad for at least 5 days afterwards because she made me think I was doing something wrong by asking her if she wants to talk about it.

A few days later I sent her a message and asked if there's a chance we could talk if she feels better. She asked me what it's about and I told her that I felt bad since our meeting and that I don't want to get treated like that by her again as it drains me. She then told me that it was super disrespectful of me to ""push her"" to talk about things she doesn't want to talk about. In my opinion it's disrespectful to attend a lunch to drag everyone down just to improve her mood, while everyone has to walk in eggshells because a wrong word could make her lash out again. I also asked out other friend if I was coming across as pushy for her, too and she said no, you just seemed interested and worried.

ok so i (21f) went on a little weekend trip w 4 girls from uni. i brought my camera bc i’m into photography (like not professionally or anything, just for fun). first day was fun, took a bunch of cute pics of everyone, edited them that night, posted them in the groupchat, they were obsessed whatever

but then the next day they start waking me up like “come take golden hour pics of us!!” and literally dragging me outside before i even had coffee. they weren’t asking, it was just like assumed that i was gonna take pics all the time.

and like. i barely even got any pics of myself. when i asked if someone could take a couple of me one of them literally goes “didn’t u bring a tripod?” and laughs??? like ok lmao

also they kinda ditched me?? like at one point i was in the shower and they LEFT to go take pics at some spot bc they “didn’t wanna miss the lighting” 💀

by the 3rd day i was kinda over it. i just felt like… not included? like i was there to take pics and not actually hang. so i told them i wasn’t really feeling it and i booked a train home early.

now they’re being weird in the groupchat. one of them texted “next time don’t offer to take pics if ur gonna catch feelings” like ?? i never offered?? i literally brought the camera bc i like it. this wasn’t a paid shoot lol

You sit down, ready to conquer the blank page. Coffee’s hot, playlist’s pumping, motivation’s high… and then *it* shows up. Uninvited. Unhelpful. Unavoidable. Your **Creative Block**—that chaotic, energy-draining roommate living rent-free in your brain—decides today is the *perfect* day to “help” you brainstorm.

Here’s what happens when your creative block “pitches in”:

# 1. The Distraction Director

*“Hey, is that a stain on the ceiling? Also, have you paid your water bill? Let’s deep-clean the fridge first!”*  
Your Block weaponizes procrastination like a pro. Suddenly, reorganizing your sock drawer feels *urgent*. It’ll convince you that scrolling through 2014 memes is “research” and that doom-checking the weather app is “setting the mood.”  
**Why it’s sabotage:** It replaces momentum with micro-tasks. Real ideas need focus; Block sells you busywork.  
***Your comeback:*** Set a 5-minute “distraction amnesty” timer. When it rings, Block gets evicted.

# 2. The Idea Assassin

*“That concept? Overdone. That metaphor? Cringe. That headline? My cat could write it better (and he’s asleep).”*  
Block masquerades as a “critical thinker” while strangling every seedling of an idea. It’ll compare your rough draft to Shakespeare, Da Vinci, and that viral TikTok cat—then sigh disappointedly.  
**Why it’s sabotage:** Perfectionism paralyzes. Block mistakes judgment for genius.  
***Your comeback:*** Name your Block (e.g., “Karen”). When Karen critiques, say: *“Thanks, Karen! We’re exploring all ideas today. Even yours.”*

# 3. The Zombie Recycler

*“Remember that mediocre idea you abandoned in 2018? Let’s resurrect it… but make it worse!”*  
Your Block hates originality. It’ll dig up half-baked concepts from your mental graveyard and insist they’re “retro” or “nostalgic.” Spoiler: They’re just stale.  
**Why it’s sabotage:** Recycling safe-but-dead ideas kills innovation. Block fears the unknown.  
***Your comeback:*** Use a tool like [**ideainitself.com’s Random Prompt Generator**](https://ideainitself.com/) to force fresh combinations (e.g., “What if *bubblegum* met *quantum physics*?”).

# 4. The Over-Complicator

\*“Your 10-word tagline needs a 50-page thesis. Also, add blockchain. And a pun in Swahili.”\*  
Simple solutions? Block finds them *offensive*. It’ll demand Venn diagrams, existential themes, and 17 revisions before breakfast—then lose interest.  
**Why it’s sabotage:** Complexity crushes clarity. Block mistakes confusion for depth.  
***Your comeback:*** Set a *“Simplify It”* challenge: Explain your idea to a 5-year-old. If they yawn, Block wins.

# 5. The Doomsday Prophet

*“This idea will flop. You’ll embarrass yourself. The internet will laugh. Also, it might rain later.”*  
Block cranks anxiety to 11. It’ll predict ridicule, failure, and your eventual exile to a desert island… all because you considered writing a poem about toast.  
**Why it’s sabotage:** Fear freezes creativity. Block confuses risk with recklessness.

I recently found out that my wife of 4 years, together for 8 years, has been (emotionally) cheating on me with an older work colleague since Christmas, which became physical in May this year. She told me that since last summer, she felt her feelings towards me wane, and that she no longer saw me romantically, but more as a blood relative. One of the reasons she put this down to was a lack of intimacy, sex and passion (mostly from my part). She also said she no longer saw me as man and that I was lacking ambition, mostly regarding my career. 

In my head, I think (possibly a big) part of the reason why this gradually started happening since last summer was due to multiple external factors (as well as internal ones within the relationship). Last summer we bought out first house together, and were moving house for those months. The house also needs a lot of work done to it, which was causing us stress. In October, I was applying for a promotion, when suddenly my work declared they were in a massive deficit and job cuts were inevitable, as was a massive downsize all around. This still hasn't been fully resolved, and while I still have a job there, so much is uncertain. It is also frustrating that I missed the job opportunity, but that's life - I think this played a big role in her seeing me as less of a man, because I wasn't looking for other jobs and promotions and I was set in my ways in my hybrid job. She felt she was the breadwinner and the one wearing the trousers. And I put my career aside so she could focus on hers, as I knew this was important to her. It's not that I gave up on improving myself, but I saw it as more of a hiatus for her to prioritise her career. She also felt I let myself go in terms of hygiene (mostly because I get gas due to stomach issues, and apparently I burped in her face during intercourse once - I genuinely don't remember doing that, but will take her word for it). 

Then, at Christmas her family cat died around about the same time her mum found out she has cancer (currently being treated). In February this year, my family dog died and around the same time my wife ended up in A&E with extreme back pain, which we later discovered was due to herniated disks in her lower spine (something still causing issues). This was also a big reason for the lack of intimacy, and I saw her as fragile, due to the amount of pain she was in.

We are separated now, after I recently discovered she cheated - which she finally admitted and broke down for me (I'm aware this is her account of things, and I should take this with a pinch of salt, as she is a liar). She said she noticed this older man since last Christmas, and he gave her butterflies, something which no man had done since she was a teenager (which was a kick in the teeth for me, knowing she didn't feel that way about me), and since February she actively started pursuing him, finding excuses to speak to him and get to know him. Eventually they started talking, she gave him her number and they went for coffee, where she admitted she was married, but confessed her feelings about him and lack of feelings towards me. This then blossomed. Originally I became aware of her feelings towards him back in April, when I could sense distance growing between us, but she said she was confused (something she still says, even now). She seems him romantically and with interest, but me with love because of our history (not sexually). I initially offered couples therapy, even up until the end (when she finally admitted it got physical), but she always refused and admitted herself she had given up on our relationship. She said a reason for this is because she had suggested therapy in the past to discuss our issues, by which she was referring to me, but ai refused. She said I was a ""mommy's boy"", because I take care of my mum and she felt I always prioritised my mum (and my other family members) before her - which I disagree with, as I feel I prioritise my family in general, of which she was a part of - but that's her views. 

In May, our relationship came to a slow death when I caught her lying about spending the night away with him. She said she was with her friend, but had in fact went away for a romantic night in a different city with him, staying overnight. When she got caught, she insisted it had only been kissing and that they stayed in a hostel. Which deep down I knew was rubbish, but a part of me wanted to believe her. She also got upset at me for spying on her. I left our house, went back to my mum's to get some space. My family found out and obviously their views towards her changed. This upset my wife and I think brought the relationship even further to the point of no return. I also said some things in anger, but eventually apologised (for what I said) once I calmed down. 

I accept that the relationship is dead, and what we once had is now lost, but I can't help the feeling of the rug being pulled from under my feet. Before all this, we were finally getting ready to plan for children (which she said she always wanted with me), and though I'm glad there are no kids involved, as this would be so much harder, I feel frustrated (mostly at myself for my failings in the relationship, as I'm aware it takes two - despite the fact her actions were the final blow), at the situation of our relationship and with my current circumstances. I was finally at a point in life where I felt everything was coming together and now I feel robbed. I feel inadequate because I'm 35, lost my marriage and wife, my home (for now - I plan to contest this eventually, as we co-own it), the imagined family I was planning for and the fact I am back living at my mum's, which just makes me feel like such a loser. I'm also frustrated and feel my situation makes me seem less desirable when the time comes and when I feel ready to move on to a new relationship, which admittedly isn't now and I know situations change. I'm also so confused, because all of the things she's done: cheating, being with an older man and with someone who has family tona previous marriage or partner, are all things she was totally against in the past. She also made me feel bad about having female friends, often got jealous and would say things to me about how many other men noticed her, were eyeing her up etc. I'm aware this comes from her own insecurities, but can't help but feel odd about her actions, since they show me a different woman from the one I married. 

I guess this is mostly a vent, but Im also looking for ways to help cope. I'm considering therapy, but will need to save up for a few sessions as this isn't cheap.  I'm not suicidal or anything, just severely deflated.  I should also point out all communication has stopped, except for the essentials, like legal matters and the house.

1lnabrq,https://www.reddit.com/r/nextjs/comments/1lnabrq/building_zero_hub_flat_fee_ecommerce_instead_of/,Building ZERO HUB - flat fee ecommerce instead of commission BS,"# Hey everyone,

So I've been working on this thing called ZERO HUB (https://zerohub.site) and honestly not sure if it's genius or I'm just losing my mind from too much coffee.

Basically every ecommerce platform out there - Shopify, WooCommerce, all of them - they take a cut of every sale you make. Like 2-3% which doesn't sound like much but adds up FAST.

I'm trying a different approach: just pay a monthly fee (like $20-30) and keep 100% of your sales. No transaction fees, no percentage cuts, nothing.

**Why?** Because I've seen too many small business owners get crushed by fees. You make $1000 in sales and suddenly $200+ is gone to platform fees + payment processing. It's brutal.

**What I'm building:**

* Custom storefronts on your own subdomain
* Zero commission on sales
* Multi-tenant setup so businesses can just focus on selling
* Monthly subscription model instead of per-transaction fees

**Reality check:** This is SUPER early stage - like ""still arguing with my code at 2AM"" early stage. I'm literally still debugging basic stuff. Not trying to sell anything or get customers, just want honest feedback on whether this pricing model even makes sense or if I'm completely delusional.

Check it out at [zerohub.site](http://zerohub.site) but heads up - **everything is in test mode, no real payments involved, all transactions are just test accounts** so feel free to click around without worrying about getting charged.

**Questions for you:**

* If you run a business, would this pricing model work better for you?
* What am I missing here? What could go wrong?
* Any features that would be must-haves?

Also made a Discord if anyone wants to chat about it: [https://discord.gg/63sd6r2N88](https://discord.gg/63sd6r2N88)

Either this is going to work or I'm about to learn some expensive lessons. Either way should be interesting.

1lnabbu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1lnabbu/feedback_required_redcoffee_a_cli_tool_to/,[ Feedback Required ] : RedCoffee - A CLI tool to  generate PDF reports for SonarQube Code Analysis,"Hi Amazing people of r/Python,

I hope you all are doing good.

For the last few months, I have been building this tool called **RedCoffee**. I've posted about this tool earlier in this sub and I believe many of you already know about it. I also apologies for spamming this tool in this sub which also led to removal of quite a few of my posts.

  
Anyways, I'm posting about this tool today to get a honest feedback about the tool. While my download numbers have spiked up but I do not see the tool getting much traction on Github. Neither am I get the feedback on what to work upon or what issues my users are facing. So if any of you could have a look at this tool and give me your feedback, I would be more than happy to implement them.

  
**What does this tool do ? -** RedCoffee is a CLI tool built using Python which helps you generate PDF reports for SonarQube Code Analysis. The tool mainly targets the community edition of SonarQube since it by default lacks a PDF Report plugin.

**Motivation behind building this tool** \- I work in an organisation where the access control is pretty strict. Not everyone has the access to the SonarQube Dashboard. So if any stakeholders asked me to share the analysis reports of SonarQube for a microservice, I had to take the Screenshots and share it with them. That became pretty messy. Plus, I have been on other side of table as well. During a hobby project with few of my mates, we hosted SonarQube locally. Community Edition was fine with us. But since it was hosted locally, only the person on whose system it was running had the access to it. So, if I had the bandwidth to resolve few of those issues, I either had to set up the SonarQube server on my system or ask my mate to send me across the Screenshots. But the context of a SS is very limited. I could not get where this code was written or which line was causing the trouble.

Hence I started RedCoffee as an internal tool to solve this problem.

  
**Target Audience** \- I believe my target audience are the Dev + QAs + Non Techical folks. Basically anyone who is interacting with SonarQube. Particularly useful for smaller teams or organisations where access control is restricted.

  
**Ask from all -** I request you all , if possible , to go to the Github Repo and have a look at the tool. Please feel free to install it as well and try it out. It's very easily installable via pip. If possible, please do start the repository as well.

1lna7pt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AFIB/comments/1lna7pt/potential_afib/,Potential AFIB?,"Just wondering if any body has had a similar experience or can offer any words of wisdom. Around a week ago I started noticing a bit of what felt like irregularity in my heart, like a split second ‘anxious’ type feeling of my heart dropping. 

Yesterday I decided I’d do an ecg on my Apple Watch and it said potential afib, I then felt my actual pulse and it would be what I’d describe as a pause then my heart restarted its usual rhythm. The pause was paired with the sensation I’ve been feeling. 

This has been happening constantly throughout the day, however I notice it more when I’m not moving around as much, for example I did cardio exercise today and didn’t notice it. I’d say it happens roughly twice in a minute to my heart. 

I went to the gp today and need to get a 24 hour halter monitor and blood tests but I felt a bit fobbed off to be told it’s probably not afib at 35. 

I guess while I’m waiting until tomorrow to get my blood tests, then possibly even later in the week for the monitor to be fitted I’m feeling slightly uneasy at how regularly I’m having this sensation. I spend a lot of time with my two young kids alone during the day so feeling nervous if something happens to me while I’m with them. 

Does the frequency and this coming on suddenly sound worrying? I don’t feel lightheaded, nauseous or like my heart is racing or anything when it happens, just that short anxious feeling. 

I have had a fair bit of work and personal stress in the past weeks but this has mostly passed now. I drink 2 coffees and sometimes a tea a day but now I am trying to cut that down. 

Sorry for the long post I’m feeling very uneasy ",1,1751187874.0,AFIB,1,1.0,False

It’s a huge plus if you actually understand the mechanisms and not just “this worked for me because I felt better.” Or just tell me why it worked and why it didn’t, symptoms wise no need to explain. 

The rest is just context feel free to skip

Here’s my story:
My psychiatrist thought I was depressed, put me on SSRIs, but since serotonin counteracts with dopamine, it only made everything worse. They started suspecting ADHD, but because I was a “high performer” in school, it kept getting dismissed as you can’t just start having ADHD in adulthood, you have to have struggled with school etc etc

But no one around me really understands why I can’t get things done.
I only study the night before exams, no matter what I try.
The pressure is killing me. I kept fearing I’d fail and get discontinued from med school. I actually deferred for a year to avoid the embarrassment and try to reset.

Now that I’m back, I’ve fallen right back into the same pattern. The only difference is: I can’t afford to defer again. My classmates are two years ahead of me now. I don’t even know if I passed this time, I really hope I did, but I can’t let the same thing repeat next academic year and I can only hope I didn’t fail to actually get discontinued

What I’ve Tried:

I once tried microdosing golden teacher mushrooms, and I’m not exaggerating when I say it worked wonders. I don’t even want to go into specifics, but it was the first time I felt like “this is what my brain was meant to feel like.”

After that experience, I assumed actual ADHD meds would work even better. I tried explaining my symptoms to my psychiatrist but again, they dismissed me. Eventually I forged a Concerta prescription out of desperation.

All I can say is, it didn’t give me that urgency to do things like mushrooms did. It helped me focus longer sure, but only after I forced myself to even start. I had zero energy, insomnia, and nasty headaches.  I was exhausted but couldn’t sleep. Had palpitations which probably was the reason I felt like I need to relax idk 

Later I tried mushroom again, albino a++?? idk. I ordered for the same strain but idk they later told me it’s even more potent than golden teacher. But this one didn’t work at all. Idk if it has to do with it being a different strain. That’s what made me lose interest in trying mushroom again, the inconsistency in results, but I’m sure it’s not all up in my head. 
Oh I combined it with Concerta and it worked well. I could sleep, which meant less headaches, could function like 6.5/10, attend classes, and actually do things. But that stash is gone, and I can’t get Concerta again. 

Where I’m at right now:

I’m honestly not sure what to do next. I’m scared if I go to another psychiatrist, they’ll just throw me back on antidepressants or give me a stimulant that will mess me up again. Maybe stimulants really are too harsh for my system??

Right now I’m having, brain zaps, muscle twitches (every 2-3 minutes,all over even my tongue), zaps in my body (like being startled/or like brain zaps minus the brain part)
I’m guessing that’s from coffee + lack of sleep, (which is the only way I can actually save myself from failing) makes me feel like ADHD meds would probably do the same or make it worse, not better.

I’ve also tried omega-3: nothing noticeable. Magnesium: actually helped, best sleep, reduced twitches/zaps, and I wake up more energized than with sleeping pills
But even with good sleep, I still can’t push myself to do things.

Like, we’re given 2 weeks to prep for exams, and I do nothing until the night before. Every. Single. Test.

I hate myself for this.
I don’t know why I’m doing this to myself. It feels like trying to control someone else who doesn’t understand the magnitude of what I’m causing myself. 
People don’t get it they just say “why didn’t you study?”
But I tried. I changed rooms, environments, techniques. I just kept getting mentally paralyzed maybe it’s the workload. Everyone even my psychiatrist/psychologist think I should drop out of med school and that it’s probably too difficult for me. It’s not difficult, if I can manage to understand a whole semester concept in one sitting, if I’m gonna fail it’s just because I didn’t cover everything, or go through the work exhaustively like looking into different books (I do more of researching far and wide than sticking to one source and cramming). So yeah I can’t drop out I’ve been in med school since 2020 that’d only make me feel more of a failure than I do rn.

So yeah, I want to hear from people who’ve been through this:
	•	What finally worked for you?
	•	Did you find something sustainable that helped with initiation (which is my biggest issue), not just attention? I’m good at hyper focusing but only if I start doing it 
	•	What did/didn’t work, and why",1,1751187115.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

Putting myself out there a bit. I'm a 37-year-old guy living in London. Life's pretty good, but it's always nice to meet new people, right?

A few things I enjoy:

* **Swimming:** You'll often find me doing laps at the local pool – it's my go-to for clearing my head and staying active. Always happy to chat about good spots or even find a swimming buddy.
* **Photography:** I love capturing moments and a bit of the world around me. You can get a feel for my style over on my Flickr:[https://www.flickr.com/photos/piersmathias/](https://www.flickr.com/photos/piersmathias/)
* **Reading:** I'm a big fan of history, and I'm currently making my way through ""Revolutionary Spring"" by Christopher Clark. It's a fascinating look at 1848 in Europe. Always up for book recommendations or a good discussion.

We were very close during school. He was the coolest teacher we used to play futsal with him and his friends. He was a young teacher, married, from a village, and had a daughter. After playing, his friends would sit and drink chiya with us, but he always said no because he wanted to go home and spend time with his wife and daughter.

We stayed in touch sometimes on Facebook. He once said our batch was his favorite and that he wanted to meet us again. When he heard I was in Nepal, he called me and asked me to visit him at the company where he works.

When I saw him, I was surprised. He looked very smart and professional, and everyone in the big office building greeted him with respect. He gave me a Khada and put a tika on my forehead to welcome me. Then he brought his Land Rover and took me out for coffee.

I said, “Wow, sir, you’ve changed so much!” He smiled and told me he was earning well now. I asked him more about it, and he said, “Maile 2 barsa aajai kaam gare vane, maile kaile pani kaam garnu pardaina babu.”

Then he shared his story.

During the lockdown, his wife lost her job, and he didn’t have much salary. He couldn’t even pay for the internet for his daughter’s online classes. Sometimes, he couldn’t even buy her chocolates. That hurt him deeply.

So, he started looking for ways to earn money online. He didn’t sleep for three days, just watching YouTube videos to learn. Then he found out about the stock market. He studied hard and even borrowed money from friends to support his family. After all the struggle, he got a job in a good company and now things are much better.

He invited all of us to his house this Wednesday. I felt shocked and happy. Before we left, he told me how proud he was of us. Then he smiled and said, “Mero chhori ko chhutti hune time bhayo, uslai liyera hami mero ghar jam.”

At that moment, I felt so inspired. He showed me what a great father, husband and teacher looks like. What an amazing man.",12,1751185159.0,NepalSocial,4,0.94,False

## Key features Analysis

The coffee and game table boasts several noteworthy features that contribute to its overall versatility and user experience.

**Adjustable Height Mechanism:**
The table features a smooth and reliable adjustable height mechanism, allowing users to easily transition between coffee table height (approximately 18 inches) and game table height (typically around 30 inches). This adjustable height is crucial for accommodating various activities, from casual lounging to more focused game sessions. The mechanism is designed for ease of use and durability, ensuring a long lifespan.**Reversible/Removable Tabletop:**

The tabletop is typically reversible, with one side featuring a smooth, polished surface for use as a conventional coffee table, and the other side featuring a recessed gaming surface with a felt or neoprene lining. This recessed surface contains dice rolls and cards within the boundaries of the table, ensuring they are not accidentally knocked on the floor. Some models feature a removable tabletop that reveals a dedicated gaming vault compartment.

**Built-in Storage Compartments:**
Many coffee and game tables incorporate discreetly integrated storage compartments for storing game pieces, cards, dice, and other accessories.These hidden storage options help keep the gaming area clutter-free and organized when the table is used as a coffee table. The storage compartments are often felt-lined to prevent scratching or damage to the stored items.

**Durable Construction Materials:**

The table construction typically involves high-quality materials such as solid hardwood (oak, maple, or birch), engineered wood with veneer, or durable metal frames. These materials ensure the table's stability, longevity, and ability to withstand regular use. The finish is often scratch-resistant and easy to clean, further enhancing the table's durability.

**Integrated Accessories (Optional):**

Some higher-end models include integrated accessories such as cup holders, card holders, and individual player trays. These accessories enhance the gaming experience by providing dedicated spaces for drinks and game components, further minimizing clutter and preventing spills. The accessories are often removable for easy cleaning.

**Customizable Play Surface Options:**
Certain manufacturers offer options for customizing the play surface, allowing users to choose different colors, materials (e.g., felt, neoprene, cork), or even the inclusion of custom graphics or designs related to their favorite games. This allows buyers to tailor the table to their specific preferences and gaming interests.

The table can be easily adapted to accommodate different activities, from casual coffee breaks to focused gaming sessions. This versatility makes it suitable for apartments, small homes, and multi-purpose rooms.**Enhanced Gaming Experience:** The felt or neoprene-lined gaming surface and optional integrated accessories enhance the overall gaming experience. the recessed surface keeps dice, cards, and game pieces contained, while the cup holders and individual player trays prevent spills and clutter, allowing players to focus on the game.

- I love writing poetry. I have this vision of writing an anthology of narrative poems based off of one of my own world's from my worldbuilding.
- All of my favourite media are my favourites because of their worldbuilding.
- MASSIVE DROPOUT FAN, brennan lee mulligan my beloved.
- court jester at heart
- as you can probably tell, a yapper
- it's been determined that my fatal flaw is loyalty. I'd let the world burn in favour of helping those I love.

I honestly have high standards for my friendships, so be prepared for that. But I also don't think that I am unreasonable. I don't expect you to be available go talk 24/7 but when we are talking I expect you to put in actual effort and not use chatgpt or whatever ai to talk to me. (Yes, this has happened to me.)

I am not easily an agree to disagree person. If it's trivial things like peanutbutter and jam vs peanutbutter and syrup, I'll happily agree to disagree but I refuse to do that with any of my politics or morals.

Ask me about my job as a barista! I've got latte art pics to share <3 or ask me about my sons' full names (2 kittens named Cosmo and Valerian) or ask me about my views on magic

If I seem intriguing, comment or send me a message!

Please DO NOT message me if you have creepy intentions. I am purely here for friendship.

I am NOT interested in talking to the vast majority of cis men because in my experience on reddit they just want to use me to get off. So just don't.

Send me a 🌙 if you read everything please. I would also appreciate a little introduction into who you are as a person or why you feel we'd get along well, please.",0,1751184928.0,chat,1,0.5,False
