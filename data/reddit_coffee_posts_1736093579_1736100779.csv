I was heartbroken a few months ago and after almost 2 months started going on the apps with not too much hope. I tried Bumble; no luck.

Then I went on Hinge. Took a while to find matches. But then I matched with two people at one point, one dude responded and we actually had a conversation. He‚Äôs from South America, though, and doesn‚Äôt speak much English. But I ended up going on the date and it was awesome and he was very sweet and we even slept together the first night. He was super into me, calling me beautiful, and said I give him butterflies.

The next morning I left and we were texting via WhatsApp periodically throughout the day. He was calling me pet names like baby, and we were just asking about each others lives. We never said anything like ‚Äúi love you‚Äù since we literally just met obviously, but I noticed he‚Äôs extra affectionate and I think Latin men tend to be more romantic etc. in their cultures.

That next day while we were talking he mentioned meeting up again the following Friday to which I agreed and we talked throughout the week (this was during Christmas week) and we had the 2nd date on that Friday where I drove over to him and we just stayed in and ate and watched a movie. The next morning he took me out to breakfast, drove us there, and paid, and it was just very sweet. We used Google translate a lot but he is studying English and can make basic conversation. We were talking about our part experiences with relationships, and he has said he hadn‚Äôt been in a relationship for 2 years since he left his country. Later at his place he asked when the last time I slept with someone is, and I was honest and said 2 months ago and that it was toxic and he said he was glad I was out of it. Then I left for the day, he helped me carry my bags and asked me to text him when I got home. I did and then we didn‚Äôt talk much the rest of the night, but he sent me a reel on Instagram the next day so we talked briefly on Instagram but he hadn‚Äôt been messaging me on WhatsApp.

We had plans to get together for New Years Eve that week, and also to go to a cafe (yesterday) but he didn‚Äôt really follow up about it so as we were talking via Instagram I mentioned that I made the reservation for the cafe and he‚Äôs like ‚Äúok baby sounds like a plan‚Äù (earlier this week)

The next day (new years Eve) I asked if we are still doing something, and he mentioned he wants to but he‚Äôs spending time with his family. He is very family oriented and I‚Äôve met his sister and cousin because they live with him. I just said okay, because I don‚Äôt want to come off as needy and just basically said it‚Äôs fine. I left him on read as he only sent a few words. I think there was a language barrier so the NYE plans were a little confusing for him.

An hour later he messages me again saying ‚Äúsend me your location at 8-9‚Äù as if he was interested in seeing me. So I go to my friends for the night,  and I am messaging him and he‚Äôs being affectionate again and was like ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you come here? I can‚Äôt leave my family‚Äù and I was like sure, so wayyyy later in the night (in the morning lol)he buys me an Uber and I go to his place and it‚Äôs great, we dance, he kisses me, I meet his cousins, and we enjoy the night and I sleepover. I did have to go somewhere the next morning (new years day) at 11 am but he asked me to come back and I agreed. Later on I buy him food and coffee and go back to his place and we play video games together, play guitar, he tells me we can work on songs together and says ‚Äúyou‚Äôre mine.‚Äù
It was great, and then he told me he had plans to play video games with his cousin so he game a bit and I lay in bed and then I spend the night again, and leave the next morning for work.

I text him I‚Äôm home safely and he thanks me for letting him know (we both had work - this was Friday) and he still sent cute emojis.

We talked about our day, and he was concerned about me since I have dry skin and was like make sure you moisturize in the winter it‚Äôs cold, and asked about my day. Then later that day he asks if we could reschedule our date for (yesterday) because he has a lot of things to take care of that he forgot about during the holidays. I say yes of course and he heart reacts my message.

Yesterday I noticed he wasn‚Äôt active on WhatsApp often or social media; when I sent him a post yesterday on Instagram he responded  and asked how I‚Äôm doing and we talked briefly and he then told me how he got a lot done yesterday, went to the DMV and then the conversation fizzled out because wasn‚Äôt much to say I guess.

I just have a bad feeling maybe he‚Äôs uninterested because he doesn‚Äôt message me on WhatsApp like he used to, and today we haven‚Äôt talked. Idk. Thoughts?",1,1736100471.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False
1hud1us,https://i.redd.it/1whn6im0u7be1.jpeg,Personal food tips for upcoming race weekend,"
My husband and I visit the Disney parks 1-3 times a year depending on the year, and here are some tried and true tips for food/snacks especially with the race weekend coming up. I‚Äôll be running the half marathon on Saturday and I‚Äôm super excited to run alongside all of you! üèÉüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

(I trained in a way where I ate a full meal at least 2hrs pre long run (6+ miles), then a light snack 30-45min pre run. I eat gummies/gels every 3-4 miles. Hopefully this gives some context as to what I‚Äôm packing etc).

- Friday morning I am making sure I get the appropriate carbs in me in preparation for racing Saturday morning. Friday night we will go for an early dinner at the Boathouse and pound some pasta. 
- For early park mornings/race mornings, I‚Äôm packing some of our greatest hits, like granola bars, oatmeal cups, beef jerky, dehydrated strawberries, bread (naan is my favorite), mandarin oranges, and bell pepper slices. We plan to make some morning coffee in our room if the cafe‚Äôs carafes are not ready to go that early in the morning. I like variety so I can eat whatever my body is leaning toward that morning.

- We pack all of this in our carry ons and have had zero issues through TSA and traveling! If you‚Äôre stitious like me, I like to stick with my routine before racing down to what I wear and eat. You also save some money packing your own snacks and not having to buy there/Instacart. Also gives me peace of mind not having to logistically figure out my pre race meals there. 

- If this is anyone‚Äôs first race, make sure you start hydrating ASAP. Don‚Äôt wait until the day before! My husband jokes that ‚Äúhydration should have started a month ago‚Äù lol. Pick up some IV fluid or Elmnt or whatever floats your boat and make sure you are getting your electrolytes this weekend too!

- Any leftover snacks come with us on park days. 

Might not work for everyone and everyone has different preferences‚Ä¶ I am by no means an expert, but I hope this helps and maybe sparks some inspiration for you as you prep for your race(s) this weekend! If you see someone chowing down on a slice of naan at the start line, that‚Äôs me! So excited!‚ú®",1,1736100463.0,rundisney,0,1.0,False

I've recently bought an ECM Classika from doppio coffee (UK).

I've noticed there is some movement of the E61 group head when I lift the lever in the on position. This movement is also happening when I insert / remove the portafilter. You can see both in the videos. Note, I am not over tightening the portafilter for the movement to happen.

  
Also, there is some resistance when lifting the lever. Nothing crazy, but I can definitely feel going through the middle position. From videos I've seen online it seems to be smoother.

  
Is that normal or should I worry about it?

  
Thanks!!

1hucxm8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1hucxm8/fa_ex_apologized_and_now_occasionally_hanging_out/,FA Ex Apologized and Now Occasionally ‚Äòhanging out‚Äô,"Hi! 
Some quick background- we dated for 2 years, he (26m) ended it when life stressors became too much, he started having a nervous breakdown due to undiagnosed OCD. The breakup was brutal, a month of him ending it, changing his mind every weekend over and over until he finally completely emotionally shutdown went cold and ended it. The reasons he gave didnt seem like dealbreakers and it was clear he had never expressed his wants and needs and let it build up until it was enough for him to run away without ever giving us a chance to talk it through. 

We went full no contact from day one. I removed him from social media, never reached out, etc. because I wanted to respect his boundaries but also I wanted to give myself a chance to heal. Well fast forward 3ish months and I run into him at a concert, we exchange niceties briefly and leave it at that. Another two months go by and that gets us to now where he reached out a few days before Christmas to ask if I‚Äôd be open to getting coffee. I agreed and we met up the day after Christmas. He apologized for everything- for blaming me, for how he handled things, for the things he said, for being unfair to me, for not communicating and resenting me. He talked a lot about all the self help books he‚Äôs been reading, working harder and being more honest in therapy, the realizations he‚Äôs been having about his communication and patterns. It‚Äôs clear he‚Äôs been doing a lot of work. 

It was nice and appreciated by me but he said he wasn‚Äôt wanting to get back together and wasn‚Äôt ready to date anyone, I agreed‚Ä¶ but then we hooked up and spent the rest of that day together like it used to be. Laying in bed he asked ‚Äúdo you want me to leave?‚Äù I said ‚Äúno, do you want to leave?‚Äù And he said ‚Äúno‚Äù and we just laid there for a while. When he finally got up he said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeling so confused and unclear. I‚Äôm sorry for lingering it‚Äôs just like as long as I‚Äôm here I can pretend nothing bad ever happened, I never changed jobs, never moved home, never had a breakdown and ruined things, never broke up. But the moment I leave here I have to face all the things I still need to fix‚Äù 
Hard to hear to say the least. He then asked me if I had new years plans and I said no, I asked if he did and he also said no. I said ‚Äúare you trying to spend NYE with your ex?‚Äù And he said ‚Äúmayybe‚Äù (spoiler: that‚Äôs exactly what we did) 
As he was leaving that day we sort of said ‚Äúwhat now?‚Äù And were both open to seeing each other casually and hooking up (I‚Äôm an idiot) 

NYE comes and he comes over, we make dinner, spend the night hooking up and watching movies. We kiss at midnight. He‚Äôs affectionate all night, cuddling, kissing, wanting me to run my fingers through his hair, leaning his head on me. He stayed the night, we had breakfast together, he stayed until 4pm the next day just hanging out, laughing, watching tiktoks, talking about our lives. When he was leaving he said ‚Äúyou know you can text me sometimes too‚Äù and I said ‚Äúdo you want that?‚Äù And he said ‚Äúwell I mean if you want to like hangout and stuff yeah you can text me. I can‚Äôt guarantee I‚Äôll be free‚Äù (he‚Äôs weird about too much texting so I was surprised by him proposing that at all) and I told him ‚Äúmaybe! Let me know when you‚Äôre in the area next‚Äù and he said he‚Äôd let me know whenever he‚Äôs in the area and free (he travels for work and is by me a lot) then he left. We didn‚Äôt make concrete plans to see each other next and I have no idea when he‚Äôll by my way next and I honestly have no idea if he‚Äôll actually reach out if he is. 

Lines are blurred to say the least. I wasn‚Äôt lying when I told him I also wasn‚Äôt trying to get back together right now but I also am not closed off to it down the line but now I have no idea what to do or how to feel. He kept saying several times when we saw each other how seen he feels by me, how he felt like he hasn‚Äôt had anyone to talk to, it‚Äôs so nice to have someone to talk to, he opened up about all the things he‚Äôs been realizing in therapy and is glad i ‚Äúget it‚Äù, and when things are stressful he would wonder ‚ÄúI wonder what (my name) would say‚Äù. The mixed signals are confusing and I think we both really missed the comfort and safety of being together. I‚Äôve come to realize I am also probably an FA and I wasn‚Äôt the best communicator either but in our relationship I took on the anxious role and severely overfunctioned to keep things afloat. And I could honestly see myself slipping into doing it again in the few days we spent together. 

So, I guess my question is what do I do? It‚Äôs clear he really isn‚Äôt healed enough to date again and have it be any different and I‚Äôm sure if we tried right now it would end even worse. But I missed him and spending time with him is so nice and I don‚Äôt want to stop seeing him and risk never seeing him again (can you see the anxiety coming through lol) but I don‚Äôt want to slip into old habits. Should I be honest with him about how I‚Äôm feeling? Should I just go with the flow? Is there any chance at fixing this if we give it enough time? Or am I reading into everything too much and just letting myself be used?",1,1736100163.0,AvoidantBreakUps,0,1.0,False
1hucwy1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hucwy1/he_asked_to_go_exclusive_but_hes_still_on_the/,"He asked to go exclusive, but he‚Äôs still on the dating apps","I (33f) started dating this man (29m) six weeks ago. After the ball dropped on New Years, he asked if we could delete the dating apps. Expressed multiple times that he enjoys our connection and what we‚Äôre building - there‚Äôs no interest in pursuing others at this time. I enthusiastically agreed and jokingly said I‚Äôd delete them right now. (I deleted them when I woke up on New Years Day.)

The rest of New Years Day, Thursday and Friday his texting communication swiftly changed, but I chalked it up to his dad being in town. We had also spent time together for several days in a row. So a lot of togetherness.

On Friday evening he invited me over and in general conversation I asked him about what he constitutes as cheating. I wanted to better understand boundaries as we progress into a relationship. We both agreed on what it means for us. He then mentioned the dating app again and I said I deleted it. He said ‚ÄúOh, we didn‚Äôt talk much about it after New Years Day so I wasn‚Äôt sure, but I‚Äôm comfortable being exclusive with you.‚Äù And proceeded to ask how I felt about the pacing of our developing relationship. He even called me his girlfriend a couple times throughout the evening‚Äôs conversation. All was well.

Stayed over Saturday night. All was normal, until 5am on Sunday. He was up and on his phone. My mind went racing (I‚Äôm working on it through therapy and medication). Something just felt off. We cuddled and shortly after made coffee, chatted and I left for the day around 7am.

When I got home I still had this weird feeling that I couldn‚Äôt shake. I downloaded the dating app where we first matched and I found him. He‚Äôs still on the app. (No pictures or text has changed.) 

I‚Äôm stumped. How do I bring this up? I‚Äôm enjoying this man more than I expected. He shows up, makes plans, is seemingly emotionally intelligent and we have such a great connection. But not leaving the apps when he said he would is a bit disheartening and I want to establish my boundaries/expectations. We don‚Äôt have the boyfriend/girlfriend title, so I do want to tread carefully but also respect my feelings. Any advice is appreciated.",1,1736100121.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False
1hucwps,https://www.reddit.com/r/Polygamy/comments/1hucwps/how_will_you_explain_his_behaviour/,How will you explain his behaviour? ,"I (25F) fell in love and dated a guy (27M) who was my coworker too for 3 years before finding out he was chetaing on me for the past 1 year. I contacted the girl, told her and we confronted him. He begged both of us individually of course to take him back. I loved him and couldn't bear the separation anxiety but my morals wouldn't allow me to take back a cheater so I bargained with myself lol and ended up becoming FWB. After a while I heard he got back together with the girl he cheated me on with. I am shit and pathetic for this but I didn't end the FWB arrangement. The thing is his girlfriend was Long distance. Him and I worked at the same place and would hang out all the time. It wasn't just benefits. We would go on food dates, he would buy my gifts and we would stay for hours on calls. He would even bring me gifts and stuff from the way back whenever he flew to his gfs city. This continued for 2 years. When our contract came to an end, I ended things with him citing the fact that since there is no future for us, Its best we end this. It took every once of courage in me to say this to him. I loved him a lot and it killed me to abandon him. When he heard this, he started crying. Confused because I always thought he might have been fwb out of guilt since he loved his gf and thats why chose her over me, I asked what makes him cry over this ending. He told me he isnt happy with his gf  but his family loves her and thats why he cant end things with her. I tried convincing him to let both of us go and start afresh if thats what will make him happy since I genuinely prioritised his happiness over anything. Anyway, he wouldn't make a decision to do smth about it, so I let him go.
Every few months, he d pop a text asking me how I am doing and I d reply back.
One day I ran into him, and we went for coffee n caught up, ended up sleeping together. I told him its not a good idea and let this be the last time we do this. But he said he cant promise and since I loved him anyway, I was taken a back. A few weeks later, I came to know that he and his gf broke up. We continued hanging out and sleeping together. I tried talking to him about committing again and he said okay and to give him some time. But then said he wasn't in the right head space to commit. But he would buy me gifts , food, say stuff like there's no alternative to you, Only you understand me. I ll always be yours but cant say anything abt marriage since I just got out of a relationship. 
I came to know that he tried getting back with his girlfriend and offered to marry her if she got back. She said yes but then he ditched her later because he couldn't let go of me too. 
We were continuing to hangout and sleep until this one random morning he told me how he found out that I flirted with someone from my workplace after I cut contact with him like a year ago and that he never wants too see me again. I tried arguing saying why couldn't he see that I loved him for 6 years and that I entertained him for 6 years. And that even if I did flirt, it doesn't matter because you were with someone else and I was single. And to be honest, I rejected everyone of those coworkers because I couldn't get over my ex. Anyway, we fought it out and made a pact to see him until he leaves the country in a few months. Yesterday, our conversation got a littlr emotionally vulnerable when I asked him why did he do what he did? I jokingly said did he want to marry both of us to which he replied if the society wasn't structured like that he d have done it cause everytime he is with one of us, he misses the other. After this, he got teary eyed said he is fucked and needs to be left alone forever. I couldn't leavr him alone in that state and asked if there's anything I can do to make him feel better to which he said go and make the guy you flirted with feel better and dont ever call/msg me again and blocked me. I got infuriated and was like what the fuck. I had so much anger that I wanted to takr out on him for fucking up my life again. So I forced him to meet me. He verbally abused me saying that I fucked up his mind. And that he left his gf for me but now doesn't even want to look at me because I flirted with my coworker. I said you literally cheated on me to which he said atleast his gf didn't call him a cheater and that he wants to marry someone who will never make him feel disgusting. He said he finds it funny that he even thought about marrying me. Someone who flirts around for attention. I told him he was being selfish and that he was hurting me. To which he said that I fucked him up as much as one could. 
I am so sad and hurt now. Someone that I loved and cared for unconditionally doesn't even admit that I did so for him and thinks I fucked him up.
I know I am not okay emotionally and therefore want a third persons pov on this. What did he get out of all this? Did he do this so he can make peace with himself thinking I am the bad guy? What's the best way I get my revenge on him, block him or leave him on seem forever?",1,1736100104.0,Polygamy,0,1.0,False

1hucvzw,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1hucvzw/aith_for_loving_him_this_unconditionally/,AITH for loving him this unconditionally? ,"I (25F) fell in love and dated a guy (27M) who was my coworker too for 3 years before finding out he was chetaing on me for the past 1 year. I contacted the girl, told her and we confronted him. He begged both of us individually of course to take him back. I loved him and couldn't bear the separation anxiety but my morals wouldn't allow me to take back a cheater so I bargained with myself lol and ended up becoming FWB. After a while I heard he got back together with the girl he cheated me on with. I am shit and pathetic for this but I didn't end the FWB arrangement. The thing is his girlfriend was Long distance. Him and I worked at the same place and would hang out all the time. It wasn't just benefits. We would go on food dates, he would buy my gifts and we would stay for hours on calls. He would even bring me gifts and stuff from the way back whenever he flew to his gfs city. This continued for 2 years. When our contract came to an end, I ended things with him citing the fact that since there is no future for us, Its best we end this. It took every once of courage in me to say this to him. I loved him a lot and it killed me to abandon him. When he heard this, he started crying. Confused because I always thought he might have been fwb out of guilt since he loved his gf and thats why chose her over me, I asked what makes him cry over this ending. He told me he isnt happy with his gf  but his family loves her and thats why he cant end things with her. I tried convincing him to let both of us go and start afresh if thats what will make him happy since I genuinely prioritised his happiness over anything. Anyway, he wouldn't make a decision to do smth about it, so I let him go.
Every few months, he d pop a text asking me how I am doing and I d reply back.
One day I ran into him, and we went for coffee n caught up, ended up sleeping together. I told him its not a good idea and let this be the last time we do this. But he said he cant promise and since I loved him anyway, I was taken a back. A few weeks later, I came to know that he and his gf broke up. We continued hanging out and sleeping together. I tried talking to him about committing again and he said okay and to give him some time. But then said he wasn't in the right head space to commit. But he would buy me gifts , food, say stuff like there's no alternative to you, Only you understand me. I ll always be yours but cant say anything abt marriage since I just got out of a relationship. 
I came to know that he tried getting back with his girlfriend and offered to marry her if she got back. She said yes but then he ditched her later because he couldn't let go of me too. 
We were continuing to hangout and sleep until this one random morning he told me how he found out that I flirted with someone from my workplace after I cut contact with him like a year ago and that he never wants too see me again. I tried arguing saying why couldn't he see that I loved him for 6 years and that I entertained him for 6 years. And that even if I did flirt, it doesn't matter because you were with someone else and I was single. And to be honest, I rejected everyone of those coworkers because I couldn't get over my ex. Anyway, we fought it out and made a pact to see him until he leaves the country in a few months. Yesterday, our conversation got a littlr emotionally vulnerable when I asked him why did he do what he did? I jokingly said did he want to marry both of us to which he replied if the society wasn't structured like that he d have done it cause everytime he is with one of us, he misses the other. After this, he got teary eyed said he is fucked and needs to be left alone forever. I couldn't leavr him alone in that state and asked if there's anything I can do to make him feel better to which he said go and make the guy you flirted with feel better and dont ever call/msg me again and blocked me. I got infuriated and was like what the fuck. I had so much anger that I wanted to takr out on him for fucking up my life again. So I forced him to meet me. He verbally abused me saying that I fucked up his mind. And that he left his gf for me but now doesn't even want to look at me because I flirted with my coworker. I said you literally cheated on me to which he said atleast his gf didn't call him a cheater and that he wants to marry someone who will never make him feel disgusting. He said he finds it funny that he even thought about marrying me. Someone who flirts around for attention. I told him he was being selfish and that he was hurting me. To which he said that I fucked him up as much as one could. 
I am so sad and hurt now. Someone that I loved and cared for unconditionally doesn't even admit that I did so for him and thinks I fucked him up.
I know I am not okay emotionally and therefore want a third persons pov on this. What did he get out of all this? Did he do this so he can make peace with himself thinking I am the bad guy?

1huctur,https://www.reddit.com/r/amiwrong/comments/1huctur/am_i_wrong_for_loving_him/,Am I wrong for loving him? ,"I (25F) fell in love and dated a guy (27M) who was my coworker too for 3 years before finding out he was chetaing on me for the past 1 year. I contacted the girl, told her and we confronted him. He begged both of us individually of course to take him back. I loved him and couldn't bear the separation anxiety but my morals wouldn't allow me to take back a cheater so I bargained with myself lol and ended up becoming FWB. After a while I heard he got back together with the girl he cheated me on with. I am shit and pathetic for this but I didn't end the FWB arrangement. The thing is his girlfriend was Long distance. Him and I worked at the same place and would hang out all the time. It wasn't just benefits. We would go on food dates, he would buy my gifts and we would stay for hours on calls. He would even bring me gifts and stuff from the way back whenever he flew to his gfs city. This continued for 2 years. When our contract came to an end, I ended things with him citing the fact that since there is no future for us, Its best we end this. It took every once of courage in me to say this to him. I loved him a lot and it killed me to abandon him. When he heard this, he started crying. Confused because I always thought he might have been fwb out of guilt since he loved his gf and thats why chose her over me, I asked what makes him cry over this ending. He told me he isnt happy with his gf  but his family loves her and thats why he cant end things with her. I tried convincing him to let both of us go and start afresh if thats what will make him happy since I genuinely prioritised his happiness over anything. Anyway, he wouldn't make a decision to do smth about it, so I let him go.
Every few months, he d pop a text asking me how I am doing and I d reply back.

I didn‚Äôt think much of it at the time, but I felt a deep connection with her, and she asked me to exchange phone numbers. What was weird is that she trauma-dumped on me during the night we hooked up, telling me how her mom passed away when she was a kid.

The first few times we hung out, she seemed really into me, but she was flaky and always late. She would constantly lie about small things that I didn‚Äôt even care about. I called her out on it, and she stopped ‚Äì except for the lying part. She told me how she didn‚Äôt want anything serious, how she hadn‚Äôt been in a relationship for six years, and how she only hooks up, etc. So, we agreed on a FWB-type scenario where I emphasized the friendship part. However, after one time, she started distancing herself ‚Äì never initiating contact but always agreeing to hang out.

¬†

We started hanging out regularly‚Äîat least once a week‚Äîfor several hours (sometimes 7-8 hours), but it was usually at a bar. Over time, I felt like we were growing closer, and there was a clear sense of romantic tension. She began opening up more; however, by the end of our meetups, she would always reiterate that she didn‚Äôt want anything serious. At times, she could be blunt or critical, making comments about me being boring, even though she consistently chose to spend so much time with me. She also insisted on tagging along with my friends when I had other plans, which made things awkward.

Fast forward a bit, and our hangouts turned into 2-3 times a week ‚Äì after which she would always distance herself even more. She was doing this dance where she would literally invite me to her place, start getting close to me, like putting her legs over me or sitting extremely close to me, and then pull away panicking like she didn‚Äôt know what to do. She would make comments like, ‚ÄúWe should have a scientific experiment where you blindfold me and we get physical,‚Äù but when I got close, she would pull away. This lasted for some time. I suggested that we should start dating ‚Äì she wouldn‚Äôt say no but rather ¬†invite me to her place. At that time, she started lending me some books.

She got sick, so we hadn‚Äôt seen each other for a few weeks ‚Äì but when we met in person, we continued where we left off. We decided to go out drinking one night with my friends. I offered to pick her up, and she accepted but made a big deal out of it because ‚Äúwe are arriving together.‚Äù She invited us to her place after that, where she was extremely affectionate, sitting in my lap in front of my friends, touching my legs, etc. She suggested we send them home and that I stay over ‚Äì so we called them a cab, but immediately after they left, she started pulling back again, saying she didn‚Äôt feel like having sex. I told her that I didn‚Äôt understand what was going on. We hung out for half an hour more, and I told her I was going to bed. We cuddled and held hands for hours in bed ‚Äì just chatting, and then she hit me with, ‚ÄúThis is wrong, but hand-holding made me horny. Let‚Äôs get physical, but if we do, we aren‚Äôt allowed to see each other ever again.‚Äù I told her no, and she said, ‚ÄúNo kissing then,‚Äù which I also refused ‚Äì and then we had the most passionate kiss ever. I left in the morning, and she lent me another book (I had asked about it a long time ago but didn‚Äôt even remember anymore ‚Äì she just gave it to me). It was a personal book, which was her mom‚Äôs gift to a friend who later gave it to her. However, there was a lot of stuff underlined in the book, so I asked her who had underlined it ‚Äì after which she pulled away again.

¬†

After that, she was extremely distant. She avoided meeting up for three weeks. We finally met up with a friend of mine, and she told me she had been avoiding me because she got into a relationship two weeks ago and it wouldn‚Äôt be fair if she were still hanging out with me (but she had no problem sleeping with a married guy before that, and she would even defend him, saying how considerate he was because he didn‚Äôt want to divorce because of the kids). I told her I would still like to continue hanging out and that I would respect her choices because, honestly, I really do care about her and wouldn‚Äôt want to cut her out of my life. She mentioned multiple times that we wouldn‚Äôt hang out one-on-one ever again. After the bar closed, I told her to come to my place so I could give her stuff back (which she had mentioned multiple times how sentimental it was). I was already in the car, and she called me, telling me to come to another bar. She then proceeded to attack me ‚Äì saying she would never date me, that she was only hanging out with me because she didn‚Äôt have anyone else to hang out with, that she only accepted my invitations to hang out because she didn‚Äôt want to be rude, and tried gaslighting me that stuff that happened never happened. In all of that, she said something along the lines of, ‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt even experienced anything in your life‚Äù ‚Äì which I took to mean I hadn‚Äôt traveled a lot or similar. I sarcastically answered, ‚ÄúNo, you did,‚Äù and then she started crying and told me again how young her mom was when she died. I tried explaining that I didn‚Äôt understand her comment in that context. I asked her if she wanted to talk about what happened as well. I have some stuff that I‚Äôve been through (not as heavy, obviously), so I opened up as well, and at that point, we were both crying. She told me she was sorry she ever met me, that she just lost all respect for me, and then blocked me on socials in front of me. She told me she was going to the bathroom, then messaged me a few minutes later saying she had to leave because she was not in the mood to talk anymore and that we would see each other next time. She didn‚Äôt even send me a happy new year text (she didn‚Äôt block my phone number).

Now ‚Äì I know this is quite a story; however, I really do care about her and would like to stay in her life as a friend. I have no idea why. I have no idea how to proceed with this. At the very least, I would like to return the stuff she lent me, as she mentioned multiple times how important it is to her. I was thinking of sending her a message asking if she wants to pick her stuff up, if I should mail it to her, or if I should bring it next time when we see each other (if ever). This is hard for me because I feel like I lost the last bit of self-respect I had, especially after she told me she was only hanging out with me because she didn‚Äôt have anyone else to hang out with (which seems contradictory ‚Äì multiple times she left coffee with her friends to hang out with me ‚Äì unless she was lying). But I don‚Äôt want to feel like I‚Äôm hurting someone by not returning their sentimental belongings.

**TL;DR**: I (29M) met a girl (25F) 3.5 months ago and developed a complicated FWB relationship. She often sent mixed signals‚Äîbeing affectionate, spending hours with me, and lending me sentimental items‚Äîonly to pull away, act rude, and remind me she didn‚Äôt want anything serious. Recently, she revealed she started dating someone else, avoided me for weeks, and told me she only hung out with me out of politeness. During an argument, she claimed I hadn‚Äôt ‚Äúbeen through anything in life.‚Äù I misunderstood and responded sarcastically, which made her cry and bring up her mom‚Äôs death. We both got emotional, and she ultimately blocked me on socials but not on my phone.

I still care about her and want to stay friends, though I don‚Äôt know why. At the very least, I want to return the sentimental items she lent me (she‚Äôs mentioned how important they are). I was thinking of messaging her to ask if she wants to pick them up, mail them, or wait until we (potentially) see each other again?",1,1736099577.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

She didn‚Äôt even send me a happy new year text (she didn‚Äôt block my phone number).

Now ‚Äì I know this is quite a story; however, I really do care about her and would like to stay in her life as a friend. I have no idea why. I have no idea how to proceed with this. At the very least, I would like to return the stuff she lent me, as she mentioned multiple times how important it is to her. I was thinking of sending her a message asking if she wants to pick her stuff up, if I should mail it to her, or if I should bring it next time when we see each other (if ever). This is hard for me because I feel like I lost the last bit of self-respect I had, especially after she told me she was only hanging out with me because she didn‚Äôt have anyone else to hang out with (which seems contradictory ‚Äì multiple times she left coffee with her friends to hang out with me ‚Äì unless she was lying). But I don‚Äôt want to feel like I‚Äôm hurting someone by not returning their sentimental belongings.

**TL;DR**: I (29M) met a girl (25F) 3.5 months ago and developed a complicated FWB relationship. She often sent mixed signals‚Äîbeing affectionate, spending hours with me, and lending me sentimental items‚Äîonly to pull away, act rude, and remind me she didn‚Äôt want anything serious. Recently, she revealed she started dating someone else, avoided me for weeks, and told me she only hung out with me out of politeness. During an argument, she claimed I hadn‚Äôt ‚Äúbeen through anything in life.‚Äù I misunderstood and responded sarcastically, which made her cry and bring up her mom‚Äôs death. We both got emotional, and she ultimately blocked me on socials but not on my phone.

I still care about her and want to stay friends, though I don‚Äôt know why. At the very least, I want to return the sentimental items she lent me (she‚Äôs mentioned how important they are). I was thinking of messaging her to ask if she wants to pick them up, mail them, or wait until we (potentially) see each other again?",2,1736099440.0,relationships,3,1.0,False
1hucn6l,https://www.reddit.com/r/GrowthCentsRealEstate/comments/1hucn6l/7_essential_tips_for_staying_compliant_with_real/,7 Essential Tips for Staying Compliant with Real Estate Laws,"Hey, let's dive into some key tips for staying compliant with real estate laws. Here's the lowdown:

1. Stay Informed About Local and State Regulations. Real estate laws can change faster than you can say ""home sweet home."" So, keeping up with these changes is crucial. Maybe join some local real estate associations or just have regular coffee chats with fellow agents. You never know what useful tips they might drop. Like, zoning laws can shift, and that could impact the way you list properties.
2. Use a Compliant Deal Management System. A good system can be your lifesaver here. Look for software that has built-in checklists and templates, which makes sure nothing gets missed. Imagine setting automated reminders for inspection deadlines so you don‚Äôt have to scramble last minute.
3. Adhere to Fair Housing Laws. This one‚Äôs a biggie. Treat everyone equally, no matter their background. For instance, if you notice language barriers, address them so it doesn't turn into discrimination. Self-auditing your marketing materials can help keep things inclusive.
4. Proper Use of Disclosures. Being transparent is key. Make sure all necessary disclosures are ready before listing a property. Once I had a client who appreciated a quick rundown of each disclosure‚Äîit made them feel informed and confident.
5. Document Everything. Seriously, documentation is your BFF in real estate. Keep detailed records of every interaction and transaction you have with clients. Using cloud storage like Google Drive makes sure everything's safe and easy to access if disputes come up.
6. Seek Expert Guidance. When things get complex, like dealing with dual agency situations, don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out to compliance experts or legal counsel. It's better to prevent issues than fix them later, trust me on this.
7. Ethical Practices. Ethics isn‚Äôt just a buzzword; it's crucial for building trust and maintaining professionalism. Commit to being transparent and loyal with your clients. It‚Äôs the kind of stuff that leads to referrals and repeat business‚Äîgold in this industry.

There you have it‚Äîsome solid pointers to keep you on track!

___

i spent all of my time this year overcoming heartbreak that had me *violently screaming and crying for months*, followed by dating a bunch of women that wound up being incompatible, and i grew exhausted with how picky i am, and how hard les4les dating can be

eventually, *i met a woman that i admire more than life itself*, and i'm sure i've fallen in love with her. my heart has waited so long for someone like her, and i know this (now)

**except, i became so afraid of heartbreak, that i broke up with her**

___

i record diary entries via audio recordings and text very often, so **i have good record of how completely stupid i was**, and continue to feel. the literal *day* before i broke up with her, i had a 20m+ audio diary recording where all i did was say how amazing she is, how badly i don't want to lose her, and how much i'm going to miss her

my anxious attachment really fucked me up.,, there were three escalating tiers that ruined me:

1. she had a very busy week+ where we didn't speak much or see each other, as she was moving house, seeing all of her friends before she goes home, etc.

1. going overseas to visit her family for a month+ in december. last time a gf went away for a month, it nearly killed me, and i was terrified about enduring this again

1. when her studies end, what happens? does she go home forever? would she stay here? could i go there?? its over a year away, but because i could see a future with her, i can't help but think ahead to this

**in the span of a ~week, i went from complete stability and gratefulness for her coming into my life, to fearing heartbreak that could kill me, then breaking up with her**, but wanting to stay friends (thank fucking god i took this approach instead of running away)

___

after breaking up, we still planned a date together, and i volunteered to be the one to see her to the airport

**THE DATE**

we meandered around malls, got boba, visited a cemetery and took photos / videos of each other, played on the playground at night, went to the city and got japanese curry together. after dinner, we walked around the city admiring the christmas lights that gleamed in the rain.

as i held our umbrella above us, she wrapped her arms around my arm... we couldn't have been closer if we tried. we laughed at disgusting men who stared at us, got lost in the city way too easily, and stayed out later than we should have just so we could absorb what would be among our last moments before she left for home

**THE AIRPORT**

i stayed the night at her house, since its closer. i arrived late, and we had already eaten, so the only thing there was to do was lay in her bed and eventually sleep. we were both extremely awkward. boundaries were blurred, our hearts beat faster than usual, and we dreaded the future. we cuddled at bedtime, but neither of us could sleep. we just laid together, aware of everything around us as time passed and the dawn approached to take her away

luggage loaded, we drove to the airport as we conversed only in yawns and the occasional giggle. the airport bustled with familiar expressions on unfamiliar faces: sleepiness, excitement, uncertainty. heartbreak? heartwarmth? their lives are surely as complicated as ours, but i guess i'll never know the details. inbetween the intermittent slithers of the queue, she leaned into my neck for stability and comfort, just like she always would. it would be easy to think nothing had changed at all

all the warmth i'd felt for her before my attachment ruining everything was back, exactly as it should have been the whole time. *every second we spend together, on our date, and at the airport, made me so happy that i thought i'd literally just fucikng explode*. so badly, i wanted to tell her how stupid i've been, and how i want to be with her still. but, it wasn't the time anymore, and it wasn't the place for sure. i savoured the last blissful slivers of time we got together, as did she, and before long, it was over. we'd go our separate ways, we weren't together, and we're to be apart for over a month now.

*the bluebird in my heart cried, but i convinced myself to let it drown.* i'd made the right choice to break up. *right?* through beams of blue light, i fought hard to forget, distracting myself with attention from those who would lend it. though, no matter how much i seemed to like the matches, i couldn't allow myself vulnerability. i didn't want to be physically intimate with them. and, well, i didn't want to be emotionally intimate with them either

for almost three weeks, i managed to keep myself in belief that we were better off without each other. that true love was to be found in others, not in her. that the life i've always wanted was out of reach, and i should abandon myself in its quest. *but no matter how tender, how exquisite, a lie will remain a lie.* and as with many, it didn't hold up

___

we've kept in touch while she was away, sharing music, memes, tidbits of our days. it's a good sign, but it doesn't say all that much. just after christmas, we mentioned that we missed each other. she's tired of the cold, and had spent too long away now, she was becoming bored and wanted to be back. she also caught a cold, and was suffering icy weather ~~with no cuddles to resolve it~~

i couldn't take it anymore. *in the spirals and swirls, a began to lose my mind entirely.* i couldn't wait until she gets back to say something, but i also didn't want to talk about everything over text. instead, while we were chatting one night (at like, 3am), i mentioned a few things to her. **raw and vulnerable, but non-pressuring:**

- there are so many things i want to say to you when you come back
- you're so special to me, and i'm realising this more and more every day, and;
- even while we're not chatting, i've been thinking of you a lot while you're away

it went well, and hope shines in my heart. she said she doesn't know what more to say, but **she feels exactly the same as me, and is now even more excited to come back to see me~**

___

so, it's currently now (big if tru), and she still hasn't booked her return flight, so i know she's at least another week--probably two, maybe three, perhaps four weeks--away, and i'm pretty much just going insane. i'm distracting myself as i can with art, writing, learning a (her) language, starving myself and drinking too much iced coffee. i'm doing fine, its just that my heart yearns so strongly that i fear it will run out of tears and blood. there's no guarantee we'll get back together, of course, but the fairytale ending does feel possible, and i'm holding onto that

Amazon no longer sells these boxes of low sugar oatmeal. I don't get hungry enough before work to eat and I'm not interested in getting up an hour early just to sit around waiting to get hungry so I can eat. I work full time and I go to school part-time and this is an incredible hassle. 

This semester I'm taking a class that starts very early in the morning and I'm planning to make egg bites to take with me to eat during class cold but that's really just going to hold me over until I get to the office. I don't really like them but they'll do in a pinch. 

I really would like to just stick with the instant oatmeal. I have autism and a change in a years-long routine would not be ideal for mental health. I'm already concerned about the egg bites.

Any suggestions for other low sugar oatmeal options? I know I can just get steel cut oats and make them in the thermos but it's just not the same because then I have to add cinnamon and sweetener and I just didn't want to deal with prepping extra ingredients. I'll go that route if there's nothing else out there though I guess.

These spots will be based in HCMC.

Line Skys Rooftop Bar, absolutely great for seeing aircraft taxi to Runway 25 left, and close up view of aircraft. Sadly this shop is temporarily closed, so other option is Cathay Coffee, which gives you a little bit of the ramp, but not a lot.

Next up is LAVA Coffee, really good place to see it up and close, for any arrivals coming in for 25R. Drinks over at the shop is good price, and taste nice. Although Katinat at 50 Quang Trung street ain‚Äôt too bad but‚Ä¶ prices ain‚Äôt cheap there.

Cafe Ng·∫Øm M√°y Bay, 389 Quang Trung.
Absolutely great view of the airport and ramp, drinks are okay, but you also got a nice collection of model planes to view at. But bring mosquito repellent for that spot since there is mosquito sometimes. Although that spot get backlight during the morning, so afternoon shots are great.

Lastly the closest to see an aircraft.
Is h∆∞∆°ng cao nguy√™n sky view at 55 Ph·∫°m VƒÉn B·∫°ch, this spot is hard to get there by car, so use grab bike. But solid and amazing view of aircraft insanely up close. Although it works best in afternoon and if operations change to Runway 07

my first ever relationship-y thing with a guy was also just like this and now we don't even talk. i'm a confrontational person, someone who circles back and asks whats wrong, communicates, is open, and the problem is always seemingly ""nothing"". these people prefer having a sunken lifeless friendship and i am the one to break it off after months of being treated like a distanced acquaintance. it is sucking the fun out of life to have had multiple friendships like this in my life. at my age, i see people still have friendships with their childhood best friends, travel the world with their friends and i can't relate to that.

one of my recent friendships ""ended"" (don't know if to label it that yet) because i asked that person out of a coffee and they just completely avoided seeing me. 

i understand maybe i can be an exhausting person who talks about my problems and trauma too much, maybe i am overbearing but i swear i am changing that. i can talk about music, movies, celebrities, etc for hours. i just don't know if i'm the problem or not. i have some friends that relate to this.

of course i'm not completely friendless, but it is those extremely deep and close friendships which this happens to.",2,1736098657.0,selfimprovement,0,1.0,False

Yesterday I was at a pub with some friends, and I noticed that the bartender was looking at me every time she had the chance for the entire time I was there. Normally I'm oblivious to every possible attention signal I receive, I am a disaster at dating, but I think this time it was really a staring contest. Very strangely I'd add, because she was very, very pretty.

As I said, I really suck at dating, and I actually never did, in a strict sense. I've been in two relationships in my life, and both times I was approached, and I have never tried to talk first to someone I like. I'm introvert, shy, rarely go out, and I'm very insecure. I forced myself to try and walk up to the bar, asking for WiFi, and ordering drinks. Same stares exchange, but I couldn't think of a way to say anything else. I got very nervous, I'm not used to this, and her looks were obviously making me anxious.

The only thing I can think of, to get a second chance, is to visit the pub again (I was thinking alone), and once she's not surrounded by co-workers (to reduce her and most of all my embarrassment), to go say something along the lines of ""hi, I know this might sound weird and embarrassing, it definitely is for me, but I think you are very pretty, and I was wondering if you'd want to grab a drink or coffee together one day?"", and if she (hopefully) says yes, leave her my number so she can think of a time and we can decide a place. Of course, this is based entirely on the assumption that I can actually gather the courage to do it.

To the help part: is it crazy of me to think this is even normal? Is going there on my own creepy (I would be embarrassed to go with someone else, I rarely go out, and I have very few friends)? Is it creepy to try and choose a moment where she's a bit more isolated (I think otherwise it'll be an embarrassment)? Is proposing a coffee or drink too cheap and low effort? Should I ask to go for a dinner or a meal? I don't want to sound cheap, but a meal is a longer time to spend together if things don't go well. Should I just use a totally different approach?

1hucaco,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1hucaco/wife_is_a_covert_narcissist_has_anxiety_disorder/,"Wife is a covert narcissist, has anxiety disorder and depression among other mental illnesses ","I‚Äôve been in this relationship for over 12 years and I have just realized that my wife is a covert narcissist. I have been asking her to get treatment for her issues for years to which she refuses. Her issues and anxieties are projected onto me and my daughter Who is three I then, react in someway by leaving the home and stressing out, having to go somewhere and sit in my truck and have a few beer to clear my mind. She says I can‚Äôt drink in the house or she will call the police.

She routinely stresses me out to the point that I want to leave and then criticizes me for leaving like I‚Äôm a loser who runs away from their family. This has been going on for 10 years. 

On Christmas Eve she invited her entire family to come to our house on short notice. For a Christmas party, in our new home that we purchased just under a year ago in March. We are barely making our mortgage payment and this woman decided to spend over $500 on food and drinks to host her family.

She then automatically assume that I would be helping to cook and prepare everything for everyone to come. On the day before and the day of the party I was on my feet standing cooking preparing for 12 hours each day. I was given the promise that I‚Äôd be able to have a few drinks and finally relax for the holidays. I clean snow for a living, and of course, it ended up snowing the night of the party and I was set to go to work the next morning.

Our daughter didn‚Äôt sleep at all that night. At about 4 AM my wife brought our daughter downstairs, while she was drunk, and sat on the couch, talking with myself and a few other family members. She then began to fall asleep on the couch with her arms around our daughter. I lifted one of her arms off of our daughter to pick her up to take her upstairs to bed, and her mother woke up and started screaming at me and grabbed my arm, telling me to let go . This obviously caused my daughter to start screaming and crying. I let go of her arm and asked her to take Maya upstairs.

I had to be awake to go to work in about 4 to 5 hours from that time. I told our guests that I was off to bed and I‚Äôd see them in the morning. 20 to 30 minutes later when I got upstairs, Maya was standing in her bed looking out the door so I went in her room and went to sleep with her where she finally went to sleep.

I woke up with her at 8:30 AM and everybody in the house was still asleep. I had to go to work so I woke up her mom saying you need to watch Maya. She was talking in her sleep when I woke her up and still clearly obviously drunk She kept repeating. ‚ÄúOh I have to watch Maya? I have to watch Maya?‚Äù to which I replied yes, I need to go to work. You should‚Äôve thought about that and prepared for it.

Because my wife has severe anxiety disorder, if I request or direct her to do something, she feels threatened. In that moment, she decided to call the police on me. She said that I was drunk and being threatening towards her. The police showed up within minutes And spoke to her about how she felt threatened. She said that I didn‚Äôt do anything threatening towards her, but she still felt threatened by me and the police said that that is not against the law.

She then said he‚Äôs trying to go drive and go to work but he is drunk. I was hung over. Yes that‚Äôs correct. I didn‚Äôt have time to even go to the washroom, never mind having a coffee or some breakfast. And I am going to work to make money for this family. Why would you try to sabotage that?

The police said I could do a voluntary breathalyzer to which I did do and I failed so I wasn‚Äôt able to go to work. 

Since December 23, my wife has left the home and gone to her mother‚Äôs with my daughter. She is now orchestrating my family and her family together to say that I need a psych evaluation and that I am a drunk which is not even close to being the truth . I drink 3 to 4 beers when she stresses me out and I need to reset my mind back to normal and go to sleep. Yes I agree. It‚Äôs probably not the best way of doing it, and I‚Äôve told her that I am open to other options But she is causing this all to happen.

Her lack of receiving treatment is direct psychological abuse to me and my daughter. 

She‚Äôs called a family meeting today for everyone to come back to my house where I‚Äôve been staying and I do not trust being in this meeting. I‚Äôve packed my bags and all the advice that I have received and understood online from living with a covert. narcissist tells me that I need to run , not walk.

The advice I am getting from the few in my family who finally understand where I‚Äôm coming from, are telling me to try to just write it out and let it be for the last few months until this mortgage expires, and we have to move. 

I do not want to risk doing that and being in the same building as my wife because she is not to be trusted. I feel like it‚Äôs only a matter of time before she fabricates another lie about me to get me arrested and keep me from seeing my daughter .

‚ÄúAnd then she gave me her number Frank!‚Äù 

‚ÄúAnd you couldn‚Äôt tell her we are running a campaign on Thursdays?‚Äù Frank asked. 

‚ÄúIf I told her we were playing a campaign she would have wanted to join. And‚Äî‚Äù 

They both continued in unison, ‚Äú‚Äîabsolutely no dates are allowed in the campaign unless you‚Äôve been official for a year.‚Äù 

Frank continued, ‚ÄúYeah, I get it, neither of us want to run afoul of Her Eminence, Mistress of the Fun Police.‚Äù 

‚ÄúHey, she‚Äôs the best Game Master we‚Äôve ever had! I‚Äôm not going to run afoul of the rules.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThe many, many rules,‚Äù Frank opined. 

‚ÄúIn light of that, I‚Äôd rather use one of my rescheduling passes.‚Äù 

‚ÄúSo, what you are saying is, rather than tell her you‚Äôre busy that day, you‚Äôre going to use one of your few chances to reschedule the campaign, just to meet a girl. I thought the group had agreed to save those in case Sarah brings back the Lich again, so Jack has time to break into her place and get a copy of the dungeon.‚Äù 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt make me tell Sarah the group is plotting to steal campaign notes. That‚Äôs against Rule 27. 

‚ÄúAnd snitching is Rule 17, Alex.‚Äù Frank said, ‚ÄúSo you couldn‚Äôt take her out on a date any other day of the week, forcing us to reschedule the campaign, because you wanted this Thursday, to take out a girl you just met.‚Äù 

Alex looked indignant. ‚ÄúWe met three weeks ago at the coffee shop. And I didn‚Äôt want her to think I didn‚Äôt want to go out! Anyway, I offered to pick her up before I thought about it.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou had your hovercraft recycled two months ago because it was making a funny noise, and you didn‚Äôt want to learn how to fix it. How are you going to pick her up?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, most of the time I just walk everywhere anyway. So yeah, I‚Äôll have to get a new ride.‚Äù Alex said, scratching his head. 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a funny way of saying you didn‚Äôt want to have either Jack or Sarah teach you. Jack literally drives an antique hovercraft. He‚Äôs still mad that you didn‚Äôt let him take your old one for parts.‚Äù Frank said. 

‚ÄúI told Jack I was sorry, okay?‚Äù  

Frank stood up and started walking over to a terminal. ‚ÄúLet me guess, you want to use my printer? What are you going to get as your chariot, oh mighty knight?‚Äù 

‚ÄúWell, if I get another hovercraft, Jack is going to kill me, while Sarah watches with a bowl of popcorn.‚Äù Alex said, ‚ÄúBut I was thinking since it was going to be in the city, something on wheels.‚Äù 

Frank pressed a few buttons on his keyboard, and he narrowed down the options, ‚ÄúSo that eliminates most auto-drones and rocket boards. I‚Äôm assuming you don‚Äôt want a convertible either?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou know most people still consider those a form of hovercraft, right? And where we‚Äôre going, we‚Äôll need to take the roads.‚Äù 

Frank clattered away on the keyboard, looking at other options, ‚ÄúSo, nothing that flies or even thinks about flying, got it. Where are you going anyway?‚Äù 

‚ÄúSherp and Terp.‚Äù Alex said, looking slightly embarrassed. 

Frank pattered out a bunch more on the keyboard. ‚ÄúHow retro. Have you thought about going in a battlemech?  Maybe like the one Hana uses for cosplay?‚Äù 

‚ÄúToo cramped for two. This is only a first date!‚Äù Alex moaned. 

Jotting out more keys, Frank paused to scratch his chin. ‚ÄúMotorcycles are probably out too then. Shame really, I wanted to see what a finished Kuziyaki model looks like.‚Äù Frank cocked his head, ‚ÄúAre you sure you don‚Äôt want close quarters?  This girl gave you her number after she has you schedule a date on the spot, and she was the one who asked you out.‚Äù  

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to ride a bike, much less a motorcycle.‚Äù Alex said. 

‚ÄúReally my dude? Whatever. Let‚Äôs see, how about a truck?‚Äù 

Alex raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúDo I look like I want to be asked to help people move stuff every time they move? The last thing I need is for Jack to guilt trip me into driving four hours to pick up some antique for him.‚Äù 

‚ÄúHey, it isn‚Äôt my fault Jack doesn‚Äôt trust transport services. That was Hana‚Äôs fault.‚Äù 

‚ÄúSure it was. And Hana is the reason why that Gossamer Rabbit nearly wiped our party.‚Äù Alex said. 

‚ÄúShe could have told me the Lich was possessing it before Sarah told us to roll initiative! And the hand gestures she made did not count. I thought she was crushing a peace sign, not killing the bunny. How does that even make sense?!‚Äù

Frank noticed that Alex was just glaring at him, and proffered a different suggestion, ‚ÄúHow about a tank? They don‚Äôt take as long to print as you would think.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat sounds way lame. I don‚Äôt need her thinking I play LightningCombat . What if she works for the government? She might think I‚Äôm after her for her security clearance.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI guess walkers are also out, although I guess you already pooped on using a mech anyway. How about a car?‚Äù Frank asked. 

Alex looked appalled. 

‚ÄúA car? Frank, be honest with me. Would you even download a car?‚Äù Alex asked. 

‚ÄúI guess not. I wouldn‚Äôt download a car, much less be caught driving one.‚Äù Frank had to admit.  

‚ÄúExactly. You wouldn‚Äôt download a car.‚Äù Alex said as his face lit up. ‚ÄúForget about it, I got it,‚Äù he added, heading for the exit. 

Frank blinked in confusion. ‚ÄúAlex? What is it? Alex?!‚Äù 

---

Sherry checked her watch. Maybe she should have offered to pick Alex up instead, she was the one who asked him out after all. She just hoped if he got cold feet he would text her. 

Then she felt a deep rumble before she heard it. 

‚ÄúIs that?‚Äù She murmured to herself before it barreled down the street, straight at her. 

‚ÄúHey Sherry, sorry that I‚Äôm a bit late!‚Äù came Alex‚Äôs voice from atop the gigantic dinosaur, ‚ÄúI hit a bit of traffic. Don‚Äôt worry though, we have plenty of time to make our reservation. Here, let me help you climb on.‚Äù 

She couldn‚Äôt look at him for a moment. Alex brought a T-rex for their first date. 

‚ÄúIs something wrong?‚Äù Alex asked. 

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Sherry said, trying and failing to hide her smile, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get going.‚Äù

* I consistently shared project updates and insights on **X**.
* Focused on a specific niche ‚Äì web 3 projects and blockchain apps.
* Offered live demos and highlighted how our solution can streamline customer support & engage with communities on their behalf

This approach led to **130 users signing up** to try the platform!

**Current Status:**

* **29 users** have already deployed custom-trained AI chat solutions.
* 5000 AI handled conversations. 
* The feedback has been invaluable ‚Äì we‚Äôve made adjustments, fixed bugs, and we are now planing up to launch subscriptions.

**Next:**

* Structuring subscription tiers ‚Äì balancing features and pricing.
* Updating the landing page to clearly demonstrate the product and its strengths.
* Exciting new features

It‚Äôs been a cool ride, and **building in public** while engaging with niche communities has been the biggest growth driver so far.

(Basically what happened with the $35 Cabeza Blanco I loved about 10 years ago).  (Cabal added to this shipping order as I wanted to try it before the horsehead bottles go away).

Similarly, wanted to pick up all the Excellias made at 1139, since their roster of El Tesoro, Siembra Alteno, Tapatio and Villa Lobos are all my favorites. Still looking for the Anejo. I've seen it, just haven't pulled the trigger, and not sure if it will ever be produced at 1477, reportedly its new NOM.

FAVE BRANDS  
Tequila Ocho's La Laja turns out to be my favorite terroir, so I've tried to pickup each expression as I found it. Never found another bottle of the Repo, but since did find the XA and the Anejo which I will crack as soon as I am done with the current bottles of both.  Their site says ""the aroma is Almonds and pecan nuts, fresh oak, caramel. Herbal notes like rosemary and pepper. Green apples and lemon drops. The palate is Oak, dry fruits, roasted coffee, black pepper and orange peel. Salty caramel, rosemary and oregano. Long and complex finish.""

**SUERTE** (not pictured) has convinced me over and over to keep buying their products and I really liked the Reposado Single Barrel (49) I got from a local store and so went hog wild and got all of their last three (60, 62 and 63) that were on sale. I can review once I've finished 49.

NOT ADDITIVE FREE!  
I saw a bottle of [Arta Extra Anejo](https://www.tequilamatchmaker.com/tequilas/5277-arta-tequila-extra-anejo) at a not-too-local shop and I asked about it. I had seen it around, and figured it was additive-laden and was counting on a pretty bottle to sell it. Surprisingly, the TMM ratings were pretty solid and the XA had a higher score and better reviews from some heavy hitters that made me think I should get it. The guy at the liquor store told me that bottle had been there ""for 12 years."" So I asked if he would sell it to me for the price Arta sells it for on their web site (89.00 plus shipping). They were selling it for about $126. The guy said ""I have to make money on it"" which is funny since by his own admission, it was taking up space in his shop which he could use to make money. I tried to work with him but he wouldn't budge. I understand, it's retail, not a farmer's market, but given the conditions (and perhaps the unfortunate association with the Broncos) I thought there might be an opportunity. So I got it from the site and I'm excited to try it. Someone called it ""The poor man's Tears of Llorona"" which is not a bad comparison.  Perhaps crack for the Super Bowl?",0,1736097936.0,tequila,0,0.5,False

Non-smoker, alcohol once a month or every few months. 
No medications. 
Current conditions: asymptomatic varicocele, pre-hypertension, Anxiety (OCD). 

As stated above I struggle with OCD so I may be overthinking but any advice would be appreciated. I visited a urologist for a varicocele to rule out any other complications or causes for it and discuss surgery if necessary. My urologist was very thorough and did a full work up. Blood work which checked kidney, liver function, prostate levels, hormones and tumor markers. Along with an ultrasound of my kidneys, bladder, prostate and testicles. All my bloodwork came back normal, no elevated levels or anything out of the ordinary. So he suggested I just leave the varicocele alone and monitor it. He did find a small hydrocele as well which he wants me to keep an eye on as well in case he needs to intervene. The only thing that was off were some crystals that were found on my kidneys. He suggested I drink more water and cut back on any high sodium or processed foods to prevent them from becoming stones and help clear them out. 
On my patient portal, he made a note of microscopic hematuria, which he didn‚Äôt bring up in person. When I asked him about it, he said ‚Äúif it had come up twice, and you were a little older, then I would be concerned. But you really have nothing to worry about, your chances of having bladder cancer are less than 1%‚Äù 
I tested negative for UTIs or any STDs as well as he screened for those in my blood and did a urine culture. 

Despite his reassurance, I keep worrying about the blood in my urine during my first visit. He did ask for another sample during my second visit so I assume he retested and it came back negative, but I know he didn‚Äôt do a urinalysis. I assume he likely used a dipstick test in office because my urine was only sent to a lab for a culture. 

I have no real symptoms, no urgency or increased need to urinate. My urine for the most part looks clear except for some cloudy urine once in a while which I assume happens because I am dehydrated (usually following a fast food meal or coffee, etc.) 

So, could the crystals be the reason behind it, or should I ask him to take a closer look to be safe? I‚Äôm just worried because I‚Äôve heard that bladder cancer often has no symptoms besides blood in the urine - sometimes microscopic hematuria being the only symptom.

I came across a beautiful painting the other day at the art show. It didn‚Äôt have a label, but after some snooping, I met the artist. She was a lovely lady and clearly talented, but she also seemed distressed and distracted about something.

January 6th 1893
I saw the same painting from the gallery at the art auction today. I don‚Äôt know why, but I think I might buy it. I‚Äôve expressed my interest to the artist but she seems reluctant to part with it despite putting it up for auction. She removed it from the bidding halfway through the auction.

February 10th 1893
I‚Äôve been in contact with the artist for a month now, and we‚Äôve become good friends over this time. And over this time, I‚Äôve seen her disdain for that portrait, but anytime I suggest selling it or simply throwing it away, she insists she cannot.

February 11th 1893
The artist sent me a surprising message: she's selling (or rather giving) me the painting. I asked her why she had a sudden change of heart, but she wouldn‚Äôt say why specifically. She says she just wants to be rid of it. I suppose I can‚Äôt complain, I‚Äôve wanted it in my gallery since I first saw it.

February 12th 1893
The painting is finally in my gallery. I feel amazing, like a kid on Christmas! But I can‚Äôt help but notice that the painting looks a little bit different than I remember‚Ä¶ something about it doesn‚Äôt look the same. Something about its face or the way it stares at me doesn‚Äôt sit right with me. I keep trying to contact the artist, but she isn‚Äôt responding to my messages. The delivery people even say the painting was left on the curb. 

February 13th 1893
I misplaced my coffee mug somewhere in the gallery, I went to look for it and found it under that painting. My cleaning lady, Mrs Finch, refuses to enter the gallery now and says if she is required to clean that room, she‚Äôll quit. I decided I liked a partly clean house more than I liked firing someone I know will have difficulty getting work elsewhere due to her age. Besides, she's been a loyal employee since my father was alive, so perhaps I owe her a great measure of loyalty in return. I‚Äôll just clean the gallery myself. 

February 14th 1893
I need to stop drinking coffee, I was cleaning the gallery the other night when I could‚Äôve sworn I saw that portrait glaring at me. It must‚Äôve been some trick of the mind or an optical illusion of sorts. I‚Äôm drinking decaf from now on.

February 15th 1893
The painting. Last night I awoke under it. I must‚Äôve sleepwalked to it. Stupid decaf just didn‚Äôt sit right in my stomach, I suppose. I had a strange dream that I had been staring into the painting and the lady in the portrait winked at me and reached her hand out to me. I became afraid and screamed as her offering hand turned sinister as she lunged for me. When I awoke, the painting looked a little bit different. 

February 16th 1893
Mrs Finch, if you ever read this, burn the gallery.

 I have locked the door to ensure the painting cannot harm anyone, but I fear for my safety. 

Last night I was cleaning the gallery and thought I caught someone who‚Äôd broken inside, when I tried to catch them, they ran towards the painting, rounded the corner towards it, and vanished. 

I looked at the painting, and for a brief moment, the painting smiled and winked at me. 

I screamed and ran into my study and locked the doors to the gallery. 

I have been in this room since. 

I write this in fragments because I must get up from my chair to check on the painting through the windows on the gallery doors.

It is now evening, and I went to check on the painting. 

The lady inside it is gone. As I write this, I can see her in the corner of my eye. Smiling at me. God save me. Please.

The Breville Red Barista Express Espresso Machine: Is It Worth the Hype?

**Introduction**

The home espresso market is booming, fueled by a growing desire for cafe-quality coffee without the cafe prices.  The Breville Red Barista Express is a prominent player in this arena, promising ease of use and impressive results for home baristas of all skill levels. But does it live up to the considerable hype surrounding it? This in-depth review will explore its features, performance, and overall value to help you decide if it's the right espresso machine for you.


**Key Features: A Closer Look**

The Breville Red Barista Express is an integrated espresso machine, meaning it combines a built-in grinder with the espresso brewing unit. This all-in-one design is a major selling point for its convenience. Let's examine its core components:

**Integrated Conical Burr Grinder:** This grinder is the heart of the machine, responsible for transforming whole coffee beans into the perfect grind size for espresso.  It offers adjustable grind settings, allowing you to fine-tune the coarseness to match your beans and desired espresso strength. While not a top-of-the-line grinder, it's perfectly adequate for most home users and a significant convenience factor.  Espresso purists might eventually consider a separate, high-end grinder as an upgrade, but for the average user, the integrated grinder is a major plus.

**Precise Temperature Control (PID):**  The Breville Barista Express utilizes PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) temperature control.  This sophisticated technology ensures consistent water temperature throughout the brewing process, a crucial factor in achieving optimal espresso extraction. The ability to fine-tune the temperature in 2¬∞F increments allows for significant customization and control over the final espresso‚Äôs flavor profile.

**15-Bar Pump and Pre-Infusion:** The machine boasts a powerful 15-bar pump, providing the necessary pressure for proper espresso extraction.  However, Breville cleverly mitigates the potential harshness of this high pressure with a low-pressure pre-infusion phase. This pre-infusion gently saturates the coffee grounds before the full pressure is applied, resulting in a smoother, more balanced espresso.

**Steam Wand and Milk Frothing:**  A crucial feature for latte and cappuccino lovers, the Breville Red Barista Express includes a steam wand for milk texturing. While it may take some practice to master the art of milk frothing, the steam wand provides the functionality needed to create a wide range of milk-based espresso drinks.

**Ease of Use and Maintenance: A User-Friendly Experience**

One of the Breville Red Barista Express's greatest strengths is its user-friendliness.  Even novice baristas can quickly learn to operate the machine and produce decent espresso.  The intuitive interface and well-designed controls minimize the learning curve.

**Maintenance** is also relatively straightforward.  Regular cleaning of the grinder, portafilter, and group head is essential, but the process is fairly simple and well-documented in the user manual.  The automatic pre-infusion system helps minimize channeling (uneven water flow through the coffee puck), reducing the need for frequent maintenance.  The automatic shut-off feature after three hours of inactivity also contributes to energy efficiency and machine longevity.


**Performance Comparison: How Does It Stack Up?**

To fully assess the Breville Red Barista Express, it‚Äôs helpful to compare it to other popular home espresso machines:

**Breville Red Barista Express vs. Rancilio Silvia:**  The Rancilio Silvia is a classic, highly regarded espresso machine known for its durability and performance. However, the Silvia requires more manual intervention and technical knowledge, particularly regarding temperature control. The Breville Red Barista Express simplifies this process significantly, making it far more user-friendly for home baristas.  The Breville's integrated grinder also provides a significant convenience advantage.

**Breville Red Barista Express vs. Gaggia Classic Pro:** The Gaggia Classic Pro is another popular choice, offering a robust build and good performance.  Similar to the Rancilio Silvia, the Gaggia requires more manual adjustments and expertise. The Breville's integrated grinder and automated features give it a clear advantage in ease of use and speed, making it a better option for beginners or those who value convenience.


**Addressing Common Home Espresso Machine Pain Points**

Many aspiring home baristas encounter several common challenges:

* **Inconsistent Espresso:**  Achieving consistent espresso requires precise control over grind size, water temperature, and pressure. The Breville Red Barista Express‚Äôs integrated grinder and PID temperature control significantly mitigate this problem.

* **Steep Learning Curve:**  Many espresso machines have a steep learning curve, overwhelming new users. The Breville Red Barista Express addresses this with its intuitive design and user-friendly interface.

* **Maintenance Complexity:**  Cleaning and maintaining some espresso machines can be daunting.  The Breville, while requiring regular cleaning, does so with relative simplicity.


**Solutions and Recommendations**

**For New Users:** Start with the machine's default settings.  Experiment gradually with grind size and temperature adjustments to find your preferred espresso profile.  Don't be afraid to consult online resources and videos for guidance.

**For Experienced Baristas:**  Utilize the machine's adjustable parameters to fine-tune your espresso to perfection.  Consider upgrading to a higher-end grinder in the future if you desire even greater control and precision.


**Conclusion: Is It Worth the Investment?**

The Breville Red Barista Express is a strong contender in the home espresso machine market. Its blend of ease of use, impressive features, and relatively compact design makes it a compelling option for a wide range of users. While it may not be the ultimate machine for seasoned espresso enthusiasts seeking absolute precision, it delivers excellent results with minimal fuss.  For home baristas looking for a user-friendly machine that produces quality espresso, the Breville Red Barista Express is definitely worth considering.  The convenience of the integrated grinder alone is a significant selling point for many users.  The overall balance of performance, ease of use, and price makes it a worthwhile investment for those seeking to elevate their home coffee experience.

1hubwfd,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hubwfd/my_f22_boyfriend_m26_is_unsatisfied_with_our_sex/,My F22 boyfriend M26 is unsatisfied with our sex life because he doesn‚Äôt think I am passionate or desire him enough. Is it my fault that sex 2-3 times a week isn‚Äôt enough for him? ,"For context, my bf (26) and I, F(22) have been dating for a year and we spend most of our time together. I am currently unemployed because I‚Äôve recently graduated and seeking job opportunities. He has never worked an actual job because his dad needs help for a few hours a week at managing his estates and in return he lives at his house and gets monthly allowances. 

When we first started dating he had broken up with someone 3 months prior, although he said that relationship was always an on and off thing so by the end of it both of them were happy with the decision. I did find it a bit weird that he moved on that quickly because they dated for 3 years and suddenly he was very into me, planning dates and brining me flowers 3-4 times a week, on our first date I even got introduced to his parents. 

During that time I was living with my friends and after I graduated I moved back in with my dad. He‚Äôs very strict and does not allow boys to come over. So, my relationship with my bf has become a routine, he comes to pick me up, drives to his house, we usually have dinner with his family, go to bed, he wakes up at around 1pm every day (he goes to sleep much later than I do) and I wake up at 10 waiting on him because he hates being woke up without the typical hugs kisses and cuddles. I am fine with that, but, I‚Äôve noticed that all our days look the same and he doesn‚Äôt seem to plan romantic dates anymore or outings, we just go around our local area to get a coffee or snacks. He has never even cooked for me because he doesn‚Äôt know how to. If I decide to make food he‚Äôll usually sit and be on his iPad. That doesn‚Äôt make me feel good at all seeing how his brother is the opposite, if he sees me cook he‚Äôll offer to help any time of the day. 


On another note, he has no close friends. He has random friends that invite him to parties or dinners but he‚Äôs never had best friends or someone he confides in about his personal life. He told me that growing up he would get a lot of attention from his parents and they think very highly of him. Opposite of me. I grew up in a very sexist household where all the chores and mental efforts relied on the women and there was no space for sharing feelings.

Recently, whenever I bring up any issues regarding how I sometimes feel that he doesn‚Äôt seem that attentive towards me or goes out of his way to make me feel loved, he brings up that our sexual life is a complete disaster because he doesn‚Äôt feel like I desire him or am passionate towards him. I try to tell him that I do try with him but I also need to feel like the other person sees me as something more than a gf to have sex with, I need to feel that from the moment we wake up he wants to enjoy the day with me and show me that he cares. I don‚Äôt want to feel like the only way I can make him happy is through sex. Because the moment I‚Äôm on my period and we‚Äôre not intimate for 5 days he gets very frustrated and acts distant towards me, almost as if I‚Äôm not there. To this he says that he believes we‚Äôre not made in the same way and that I don‚Äôt ever seek sex from him nor do I act horny or initiate it. That we‚Äôre just too different. He said that he‚Äôs never felt like this in a relationship and that he‚Äôs 100% sure that whenever we have sex it‚Äôs because I decide to give in and not make him think that there‚Äôs any issues. I‚Äôm so confused on his way of thinking I didn‚Äôt even have words for it. No matter what I say or do its not enough to convince him that I do enjoy sex with him but I don‚Äôt enjoy having sex while on my period or even having sex 3 times a day because he lasts an hour every time and I get sore. He says that having sex 2-3 times a week (we spend around 4-5 days together) is not what a relationship should be like in our 20s. 

I don‚Äôt know what to say to defend myself anymore? I don‚Äôt want to be made to feel like there‚Äôs something wrong with me? 
I‚Äôve tried to initiate sex the last few weeks and I don‚Äôt even think he‚Äôs noticed because he mentioned it again how I don‚Äôt initiate it. Ive tried to explain that maybe the reason why I didn‚Äôt initiate it in the past is because on my past relationships I was never expected to or no one gave me an indication that I should, they didn‚Äôt ask me to change anything so I thought that was what sex should be like.

I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs an ego thing for him where he was always used to getting so much attention from ex girlfriends and family that when he‚Äôs not getting his way he blames me for it? Or is it a deeper issue where he doesn‚Äôt envision me as a long term thing because he‚Äôs never held that sort of relationship with anyone? So it‚Äôs not about me but about the comfort of having someone at the present moment?

I‚Äôm afraid that this is a compatibility issue but is it just that both of us have too much free time on our hands..? if we were busier and didn‚Äôt see each other this often would this make our relationship stronger and more passionate? 

I‚Äôll take any advice, I‚Äôm very confused. 

TLDR: my F(22) relationship with bf (M26) is becoming very monotonous and as we spend more time together he‚Äôs beginning to question our sexual life and my attraction towards him. He doesn‚Äôt feel passion nor desire from me and questions whether I even think of sex at all since he thinks we don‚Äôt have enough of it and I just do it to keep him happy.

1hubvdv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wario/comments/1hubvdv/obviously_wario_exists/,Obviously Wario Exists,"One of the arguments here coming from the new types of Atheists is ‚Äúwhen I was a child, I believed in Wario. When I was a child, I believed in Santa Clause. When I was a child, I believed in the Tooth Fairy. But then one day, I grew up and I realized that Wario doesn‚Äôt exist, Santa Clause doesn‚Äôt exist, the Tooth Fairy doesn‚Äôt exist, and in the same manner one day I grew up and I realized that God doesn‚Äôt exist.‚Äù I‚Äôve always found that line of argumentation rather funny because to me it seems completely absurd to say that Wario doesn‚Äôt exist. Because obviously Wario exists. There are Warios everywhere. At Nintendo events and SNL skits, there are guys that dress up as Wario. There are Wario decorations, stickers, ornaments. We have video games and stories ‚Äì we have of these things which celebrate Wario. It is patently absurd to say that Wario does not exist. Obviously Wario exists. There are certain things that don‚Äôt exist for example a square-circle or dry water. Now those things are impossible; they do not exist. But Wario definitely exists. The question we need to ask is ‚Äúin what manner does Wario exist?‚Äù And I think that in asking oneself of how it is that Wario exists can maybe help certain people understand the manner in which we say that God exists. There are things that exists that are not at the level of my coffee cup. There are things that exist at different levels of being. You could say that about concepts. Love exists, but you can‚Äôt put it in a bottle. You can‚Äôt put it in a box, but it still exists. Wario exists in a much more immediate manner than something like love. We know what Wario looks like, what his purpose is. Now the thing is that what people tend to struggle with is to understand that Beings are not obvious. It‚Äôs not that obvious how to contain a being. So, you for example, you have parts. You have hands, fingers, eyes, you have hair ‚Äì you have all these different parts and there is something, your Being, your personhood, which holds all those things together. And now Wario is the same thing, but his body is just not as contained as your body. It is actually a lot bigger than your body. Parts of Wario are the images of Wario that we see in videogames, that we see in memes, just like your picture which appears online. Your picture that‚Äôs in your telephone or in some family album is an extension of you. When people see the picture, they recognize you and they come into contact with you. So too, Wario has parts. When Elon Musk dresses up as Wario in SNL, he is manifesting Wario. He is a part of Wario to the extent that he is participating in the being of Wario at that moment. Wario is a Being that is coherent. He has a personality; he has a way of speaking. This is not just imaginary because you are not that contained as you think. You as a person, you can be possessed by all these different ideas. You can be influenced by all these external influences and even in your mind, you are not as centered as you think. You have all these different, kind of crazy personalities that can pull you in different directions. But why do you think you as a person exist? There is something. There is a total way in which those elements are pulled together into a consistent Being. If it wasn‚Äôt so, we‚Äôd say you‚Äôre schizophrenic, we‚Äôd say you‚Äôre crazy. If you‚Äôre not crazy, there‚Äôs something pulling those elements together. The next time somene tells you that neither God nor Wario exist, you can respond, ""Obviously Wario exists.""",5,1736097424.0,Wario,0,1.0,False
1hubuc2,https://www.reddit.com/r/hvacadvice/comments/1hubuc2/2_year_old_unit_not_heating_properly/,2 Year Old Unit not heating properly.,"Hi, I have a Goodman heat pump that's just over 2 years old. I live in Easter NC in case that info might help with anything but, I keep the heat set to 68. The unit has struggled to keep the house at 65 the past few days/nights and with being a single income family of 4, I can't afford to have a tech come out this month so any insight would be HIGHLY appreciated. 

It's a Goodman; Model GPH1436M41 ... installed between June or July of 2022 as we had just bought the home and the old unit died literally the same week we moved in. It's backup heat is supposed to be heat strips to my knowledge. We did have an issue with it this summer where the A/C wouldn't cool and so my husband had the hvac guy that works at the prison he works out just come take a look and a wire had come loose. A freshly stripped wire and new wire cap, problem fixed! So my husband was able to get off of work early enough yesterday with daylight left to take the panel off and sure enough, the wire next to the one they had fixed this summer had done the same thing. Freshly stripped wire, new wire cap and the temp in the house actually started climbing before we went to bed. Get up this morning and the thermostat is showing a temp of 65 in the house although heat is still set to 68. I have noticed some frost on the outside casing of the unit, extending from the bottom to maybe 4 or 5 inches up, it isn't a solid white ""ice"" but more than just dew it seems. I've not noticed if it's kicked in to defrost mode as my back is out and where I am normally outside early in the morning to smoke and drink a cup of coffee, I've sat on my bed to smoke next to my big air filter because my back is out. Hubby said there was frost/possibly ice in the same areas that I'd noticed so we shut the system off, set the fan to ON and fired up the little gas fireplace in the sitting room with a fan on low to blow the heat towards the air handler so that it would defrost the system. I'm getting ready to turn the system back on but would like to have other's input on possible issues.

  
I know there's a chance of low refrigerant levels or a stuck reverse valve but is there anything else that we can try on our own? And it has brand new filters put in. The old filters were only 2 weeks old but in a hail Mary move we figured screw it and put new ones in. So new filters, thermostat is at least set correctly (though I guess it could always still be a bad thermostat), wire that was almost falling off was fixed. Am planning on having him do the reset thing here shortly (he's out our burn pile atm). Anything else we can do ourselves?

  
Thanks in advance!

I'm terribly sorry I couldn't attend the memorial service. I know you'd never hold it against me. I finally met D yesterday and kept seeing you in her. She has your eyes and your smile; I let myself think I was meeting a younger you. I like the illusive comfort of feeling like we had more time together, however fleeting. We talked about your love for hot chocolate and soft pretzels and Ithaca and baked ziti. 

I find myself thinking if I were to go back to the boathouse at 6am, I'll see your car parked outside and think she never misses a day. Then I'd walk in to find you in your vest, chatting with Ona over coffee. I'll promise to catch you right after my practice. Then we'll get a hearty breakfast at Portage and I'll fight you over how the most beautiful thing about Lolita is not the prose and you'll tell me the book has an abhorrent premise, salvaged only by its elegant language. We debate endlessly over Tarkovsky and Almod√≥var, Bubl√© vs Sinatra, Stanley cups, crocs, everything under the sun. You ask me why I always get a BLT. I tell you I want a tiny sandwich bar in my house when I'm your age. You laugh and tell me I don't have to wait to be your age to make that happen. You're right. You were always right about everything. Except for Lolita. I'll take that small win. 

Cayuga's not Lake U, but its grown on me like you said it would. My favorite shell here is surprisingly a double, called Karen. My dad got sick again so it was a very tough year and I've had to make some hard choices. Hearing of you only made me more numb, until yesterday. The good part is I like it here, I'm a truant but I like my new crew, I can now use the oven you gifted me, I've learned to make an excellent cr√®me br√ªl√©e and I think I know what problem space I'll study for my thesis. It looks like I'll be getting married this year, so that should be another thing to look forward to. Weddings have never been my thing, but I wish you could be there. I wanted you to see the sea back home. 

D said she could see why you and I got along so well, despite the differences that were only ever skin-deep. We were trying very hard to keep it light and not sob like babies in that coffee shop.

The week after we went for a second date, this time dinner, and again we talked so much that I almost didn't finish my food. After that we went for drinks and to have fun in the nightlife, singing and dancing (in a club). The energy was so upbeat that I felt that a kiss would have been out of place.

Then again week later, we went out for the third time. In the meantime she had sent me some heart-emojis in messages, but I was always the one who initiated contact. In the third date I had planned to kiss her, and we were drinking wine and were physically very close to each other. But before I could do it, she said that she felt uncomfortable that I'm so close. She went on to say that she only wants to have a platonic relationship. I told her that I'm interested in her. She also said something alongs the lines of ""wanting to get to know each other better"". I took this as her simply trying not to hurt my feelings.

I tried not to be too shaken about it, and we had a nice rest of the evening. We still talked as much as before and danced. When we said byes, I gave her a deep hug. When I stood up to leave, she was reaching to me with her hand, kind of like a child does, as if saying ""please don't go"". Some hours later, I got a heart-emoji from her. This was 4 days ago.

  
So now I don't really know what to think or to do. I don't want to be in the friendzone. And I feel like if I reach out to her, it tells her that I'm ok with being just friends.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the world of interior design, black decor has become increasingly popular, especially in open-concept spaces. This color can radically enhance the look and feel of a room while promoting a sense of contrast and cohesion. When you think of black decor, you might imagine dramatic walls or heavy furniture pieces. However, its versatility allows for a wide range of applications that can work beautifully in spaces with an open layout.

One of the most captivating aspects of black decor is its ability to create striking contrasts. In areas with multiple functions‚Äîlike kitchens blending into dining and living areas‚Äîblack elements can pop against lighter backgrounds. For instance, black kitchen cabinets or an island can set a bold tone while encouraging a fluid transition to the dining area. Using black accents like bar stools or decorative vases helps to tie these areas together, maintaining a cohesive look.

To effectively incorporate black decor, consider the following strategies:

- **Accent Walls:** Painting one wall black can serve as a focal point without overwhelming the space. Choose a wall that naturally draws the eye, such as the back wall behind a sofa or the end wall of a hallway. It sets a dramatic tone without enclosing the room.
- **Furniture Selection:** Opt for black furniture pieces, such as a coffee table or chairs, that can serve as anchor points in your open-concept area. Choose designs that are sleek and modern to keep the space feeling airy.
- **Textiles and Accessories:** black decor doesn‚Äôt have to be complex. Throw pillows, rugs, and curtains in black add layers and texture, enriching the overall aesthetic without dominating the room.
- **Lighting Fixtures:** Black lighting fixtures are an excellent choice for highlighting areas in an open-concept space. Opt for pendant lights or chandeliers that draw attention and provide focal points without sacrificing luminosity.
- **Artwork and Decorative Elements:** Black frames for art pieces or decorative sculptures in black can unify diverse elements across the open space. These accents not only enhance visual interest but also serve as cohesion anchors, creating harmony throughout the area.

Black decor can champion both style and functionality in open-concept spaces. It offers a sense of grounding, particularly in areas flooded with light. A carefully placed black element can absorb excess brightness and provide balance. Moreover, the darker hues can create zones within the space, guiding the eye and indicating different functional areas.

One of the essential aspects of using black in an open layout is the interplay with other colors. Pairing black with lighter colors, such as white, beige, or soft pastels, can enhance its elegance. For instance, a black and white color scheme can feel clean and sophisticated, while incorporating wooden elements can introduce warmth and organic beauty. Complementing black decor with metallic accents, such as gold or silver, also adds a touch of glamour, elevating the space's overall sophistication.

Accentuating the architectural features of an open-concept layout is crucial for achieving stunning results. Black decor can highlight these aspects beautifully. If you have exposed beams, structural columns, or built-in shelving, painting them black can create a seamless look that extends throughout the entire space. This visual consistency reinforces a cohesive design while celebrating the architectural elements of your home.

Another key benefit of using black decor is its timeless quality. Trends come and go, but black always maintains a place in the world of design. Its versatility allows it to fit both contemporary and traditional stylistic preferences. Whether you're aiming for a minimalist look or a more ornate, eclectic design, black components can adapt to your vision.

Black decor plays a crucial role in enhancing open-concept spaces by providing contrast, defining areas, and promoting a cohesive design. By incorporating black thoughtfully‚Äîthrough walls, furniture, accents, and accessories‚Äîyou can create a stylish and functional atmosphere that blends effortlessly from one space to another. Embrace the power of black decor and watch as your space transforms into a sophisticated sanctuary.

Balancing Light and Dark: Strategies for Incorporating Black Elements in Open Design
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In open-concept spaces, where different areas flow into each other seamlessly, incorporating black decor can create a striking contrast and enhance your interior design. Using black elements wisely can balance light and dark, offering depth without overwhelming the space. Here are some effective strategies to achieve this balance.

### Emphasizing Contrast

Using black in an open-concept layout immediately draws the eye. To emphasize contrast, consider painting an accent wall black or using black furniture pieces. These elements can ground the space, making lighter colors pop!

#### Tip:

- Choose a black focal point, such as a piece of art or a large piece of furniture.
- Surround black elements with lighter decor to avoid creating a stark divide.

### Textural Balance

Different textures can help soften the intensity of black decor. For example, mix matte black finishes with glossy or metallic accents. A matte black coffee table paired with glossy black vases creates a dynamic interplay of light and dark.

#### Combining Materials

Think about mixing materials too. Combining wood with black decor can add warmth to your open-concept space. A wooden dining table with black chairs or a black sofa with wooden side tables creates a balanced and inviting environment.

### Lighting Matters

Lighting plays a crucial role in how black decor interacts with an open-concept space. Use lighting strategically to highlight black elements and create a warm atmosphere. For instance, pendant lights or table lamps with warm bulbs can soften the harshness of black.

#### Layer Your Lighting

- Use floor lamps and table lamps to create layers of light.
- Consider installing dimmable lights to adjust the mood effortlessly.

### Define Zones Carefully

In open-concept homes, it‚Äôs essential to define different areas while maintaining a cohesive aesthetic. Use black decor as a way to outline these zones. For example, a black area rug can delineate the living room from the dining area without interrupting the flow of space.

Check the Details Here -&gt; ;) https://amzn.to/3Bwu5mR  
  
#### Benefit of Area Rugs

Area rugs can also provide comfort underfoot while serving as thoughtful design elements. Select rugs that blend patterns or colors that harmonize with your black decor to further enhance your overall design.

### Use Accessories Thoughtfully

Accessories are a subtle yet powerful way to introduce black into your decor. Think about using small black decor items such as vases, picture frames, or throw pillows. These pieces punctuate your space with sophistication and create visual interest.

#### Accessorizing Tips

- Incorporate black accessories in varying sizes and shapes for diversity.
- Pair black accessories with colorful items to maintain a vibrant feel.

### Maintain Harmony with Color

Balancing black decor with other colors is crucial in open spaces. Consider a color palette that complements the black elements, incorporating shades such as white, gray, or rich jewel tones. These colors can offer striking contrasts while ensuring that the black decor enhances rather than overshadows the space.

#### Dynamic Color Combinations

Use color swatches to find harmonious combinations. A black sofa paired with deep emerald green cushions brings elegance and warmth, whereas black frames with white art pieces create a chic, modern aesthetic.

Check the Details Here -&gt; ;) https://amzn.to/3Bwu5mR  
  
### Final Thoughts

Black decor in open-concept spaces is about balance and thoughtful design. By emphasizing contrast, mixing textures, and using lighting wisely, you can create a unique space that feels cohesive and inviting. Remember, the key is to enhance, not overwhelm. With these strategies, your open-concept area can beautifully showcase black elements while maintaining a light and airy feel.

### Conclusion

By thoughtfully incorporating black decor in open-concept spaces, you can create a stunning contrast that enhances the overall design while maintaining a sense of cohesion throughout the area. The deep, rich tones of black serve as a dramatic backdrop, making lighter colors pop and adding depth to your living environment. This contrast not only catches the eye but can also help delineate functional areas in an open layout, guiding the flow of movement and enhancing usability.

Balancing light and dark tones is crucial in achieving an inviting atmosphere. By strategically placing black elements‚Äîsuch as furniture, accessories, or accent walls‚Äîyou can create visual interest without overwhelming the space. Pairing black decor with softer hues and plenty of natural light will ensure that your rooms feel welcoming and not closed in. Consider the use of mirrors or reflective surfaces to amplify light and create an airy feeling that complements darker accents.

Whether you choose a bold statement piece or subtle black accents, the key lies in moderation and intentional placement. As you explore your design options, remember that black decor can act as an anchor, grounding your space while allowing creativity to shine through. With the right balance, your open-concept area can become a cohesive haven that showcases your style, all while harnessing the powerful impact of black decor. Embrace the elegance and sophistication it brings to your home, and allow it to transform your living space into one of stunning beauty and thoughtful design.",1,1736096610.0,BesteDekoSchwarz,0,1.0,False

We both work very demanding jobs and don‚Äôt get a lot of free time. But this last week the boys were on winter break from school and they spent the week visiting with my parents. 

My husband and I have an amazing relationship. We communicate well, have amazing sex, we have similar interests and we love spending time together. However, with our jobs and the demands of two teenagers it‚Äôs hard to focus on us and we find ourselves struggling to survive sometimes. This last week was amazing and my man hit all the love languages! 



*Words of affirmation- I got so many nice texts throughout every day. They would range from my husband telling me how wonderful and thankful he was for me to some very dirty ones  that left me feeling desired and all hot and bothered. 

*Quality time- yes we definitely spent a lot of good quality time together. We worked out together, played board games/ video games, we spent a lot of time talking and laughing together. My husband planned a surprise date for us and put a lot of time into researching a new delicious restaurant! 

*Physical touch- so much!!!! Constantly holding hands and snuggles. 

*Acts of service- every night my man would do the kitchen cleanup. I received a much needed full body massage. 

*Receiving gifts- my husband went out early one morning and brought home coffee and breakfast. 

I feel so blessed that I was so taken care of this past week. We both had really big weeks at work and that brought a lot of stress but I was lucky enough to have someone that knew it was a rough week and decided to make it soooo much better for me.

[  ] 1 cup (2 sticks; 227 g) unsalted butter


[  ] 1 3/4 cups (250 g) all-purpose flour


[  ]  1/4 cup whole wheat flour


[  ] 1 teaspoon baking soda


[  ] ¬æ teaspoon kosher salt


[  ] 1 cup (packed; 215 g) dark brown sugar


[  ] ‚Öì cup (73 g) granulated sugar


[  ] 2 large eggs, room temperature


[  ] 2 teaspoons vanilla extract


[  ] 2 1.4-oz. (80 g total) chocolate toffee bars (preferably Skor), chopped into ¬º-inch pieces


[  ] 1 tablespoon (or your desired amount) chocolate malt powder


[  ] Instant coffee (done to your liking)


Flaky sea salt or kosher salt (for topping after finished)


Preparation


Step 1


Cook 1 butter stick in a medium saucepan over medium heat, stirring often, until it foams, then browns, 5‚Äì8 minutes. Scrape into stand mixer and mix the other butter stick cut into chunks with the brown butter. Let cool until it's is like a warm bath.


Step 2


Meanwhile, whisk flour, baking soda, chocolate malt powder, and kosher salt in a medium bowl.


Step 3


Add instant coffee, brown sugar, and granulated sugar to browned butter. Using an electric mixer on medium speed, beat until incorporated, about 1 minute. Add eggs and vanilla, increase mixer speed to medium-high, and beat until mixture lightens and begins to thicken, about 1 minute. Reduce mixer speed to low; add dry ingredients and beat just to combine. Mix in chocolate wafers with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula. Let dough sit at room temperature at least 30 minutes to allow flour to hydrate. Dough will look very loose at first, but will thicken as it sits.


Step 4


Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 375¬∞. Using a 1-oz. ice cream scoop, portion out balls of dough and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing about 3"" apart (you can also form dough into ping pong‚Äìsized balls with your hands). Do not flatten; cookies will spread as they bake.


Step 5


Bake cookies until edges are golden brown and firm but centers are still soft, 9‚Äì11 minutes. Let cool on baking sheets 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack, Sprinkle with sea salt, and let cool completely. Repeat with remaining dough and a fresh parchment-lined cooled baking sheet.


Do Ahead:¬†Cookie dough can be made 3 days ahead; cover and chill. Let dough come to room temperature before baking.

I‚Äôve decided to move away from Nespresso and start making decent espresso by hand. Now I‚Äôm facing a wide range of espresso machines and various accessories. Can you help me make a decision?

In addition to Nespresso, I‚Äôve previously used a Bialetti Moka Pot, Aeropress, and an automatic coffee machine by Miele.

Initially, I considered getting a semi-automatic machine like the Profitec Go, but I‚Äôm planning to move to another country soon. That made me lean towards something easier to maintain in a new location.

This led me to manual espresso machines. My favorites are Flair and Cafelat Robot. As you can see, I‚Äôve already narrowed down my choices in this direction.

Now I need to choose a model. The Flair 58 feels like an ‚Äúendgame‚Äù option, meaning I wouldn‚Äôt have to deal with selling or upgrading later. Its advantages include an electric preheat system. The downside is its larger size.

Then there‚Äôs the Pro 3 model, which has a smaller lever (though the countertop footprint is the same), a lower cost, but requires preheating for light roast beans using a kettle. Since I currently don‚Äôt own any accessories compatible with the 58mm portafilter, the smaller size of the Pro 3‚Äôs portafilter wouldn‚Äôt pose an issue for me.

As far as I understand, I‚Äôll need a WDT tool that isn‚Äôt portafilter size-specific. A tamper might also be necessary, and Normcore offers a suitable size for this.

It seems the only downside of the Pro 3 is the preheating requirement. After researching, I concluded that preheating isn‚Äôt necessary for dark roasts, and for medium and light roasts, it shouldn‚Äôt be much of an inconvenience.

Is my reasoning correct? Are there any advantages of the Flair 58 that I might have overlooked?

P.S. I also considered the La Pavoni, which I could buy for a good price on the secondhand market in my area. However, I ruled it out due to safety concerns, as the boiler could potentially burn a child or a cat.",2,1736096462.0,FlairEspresso,8,1.0,False

I wanted to have comments on 1 of your best drain games ideas ... cause it is so refreshing and some times we run out of ideas to keep it this way and enjoyable for both parties. I have MANY. But I will start with one that particularly marked me when it happened. She was a brunette, 23 from UK, a bit chubby but just a little. Anyways ... as i was on a budget, she insisted i paid her a small coffee send of ¬£5, which i did. She then mocked me for having a small penis (i don't but i love the idea) and wanted to charge me a small penis fee of another ¬£5 and this is where the game began. I took a few minutes to send (like 5mns), so she said i would be punished by sending late, so we would increase by ¬£5 so ¬£10. I started to enjoy the idea and wanted to pretend i was dumb and maybe wish it continued (cause it was sooo hot). So each time I sent the previous amount that she said was too late to send, and she kept being strict and said anyways the amount increased, and that I had x minutes of time frame to send it in time before it increases again (like 5-10mns each time), she was saying come on !! 2 minutes left or i will increase it, and I each time sent on the last second and boom time out i was pretending complaining and she kept strictly saying it's my fault, that she decides, that i must pay in time otherwise the price would increase, that it would end when i pay the last fee in time. 
So it went from an initially ¬£5 coffee send to a ¬£95 small dick punishment for a round total of ¬£100, all during our 1st ever discussion. It's also a reminder that you can have fun with small sends and with imagination and vice it can grow pretty quickly ! We used paypal at this occasion so she was sending payments requests, i prepared the current one and paid just seconds before she deleted it and replaced it by a new higher one ... it was terribly hot and not scripted so it gave it an incredible realistic aspect.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to achieving a restful night, the significance of selecting the right bed sheets cannot be overstated. Bed sheets play a vital role in our comfort while sleeping, impacting not only how we feel but also how well we rest. Quality sheets can enhance your sleeping experience, making it essential to choose them wisely.

### Why Comfort Matters

Imagine sinking into a cozy bed after a long day. The feel of soft, smooth sheets against your skin can make all the difference. Here‚Äôs why comfort is paramount:

- **Temperature Regulation:** Certain materials excel at keeping you cool or warm, ensuring an uninterrupted sleep.
- **Softness:** Fabrics like cotton, bamboo, or linen provide different textures, which can mold to your body‚Äôs shape, enhancing comfort.
- **Breathability:** The right sheets allow air to circulate, reducing sweat and discomfort.

### Material Matters

The type of material you choose for your bed sheets can influence both comfort and hygiene. Here are some popular options:

- **Cotton:** Known for its softness and breathability, cotton is a top choice for many. Look for sheets with a high thread count for extra comfort.
- **Bamboo:** Eco-friendly and naturally hypoallergenic, bamboo sheets are becoming increasingly popular. They maintain temperature and wick away moisture effectively.
- **Linen:** Perfect for warmer climates, linen sheets are airy and durable, though they may come at a higher price point.

### Thread Count Explained

You may have heard the term ""thread count"" when shopping for bed sheets. This number represents the threads woven together per square inch of fabric. Here‚Äôs what to consider:

- **Higher Isn‚Äôt Always Better:** While a higher thread count often indicates a denser, softer sheet, the quality of the fibers matters equally.
- **Optimal Range:** Bed sheets with a thread count between 300 and 600 are usually a good balance of softness and durability.

### Choosing the Right Size

Next on your list is ensuring that you pick the right size for your mattress. Ill-fitting sheets can detract from your sleep quality. Consider these tips:

- **Fit:** Check if your mattress is standard, deep pocket, or adjustable, and choose sheets that match.
- **Queen vs. King:** Know your measurements! A King bed requires larger sheets than a Queen bed, so be precise.

### Care and Maintenance

The longevity of your bed sheets significantly affects your comfort. Proper care is essential for keeping them in good condition:

- **Washing:** Follow the washing instructions. Typically, warm water is best for cotton and bamboo sheets, while linen benefits from cooler temperatures.
- **Drying:** Avoid high heat to prevent shrinkage. Air drying is often gentler on the fabric.

### Invest for Quality Sleep

While you may find cheaper alternatives, investing in high-quality bed sheets can transform your sleep environment. Quality sheets can last longer and feel better against your skin. Think of it as an investment in your overall well-being.

### Personal Preference

Your choice of sheets should cater to your personal preferences. Some love the crisp feel of cotton, while others may prefer the softness of bamboo. Experiment with different materials and thread counts to find what truly suits your needs.

Prioritizing the right bed sheets can lead to better sleep and a healthier lifestyle. Remember that comfort, material, fit, and care all play a significant role in your overall experience. Treat yourself to sheets that make you feel good, and you might just find that you enjoy bedtime more than ever.

Creative Ways to Use Bedding Sheets Beyond the Bedroom
------------------------------------------------------

Bedding sheets are a staple in every household, serving as cozy coverings for our beds. However, their uses extend far beyond the realm of sleep. Whether you're looking to upcycle an old set or simply explore your creative side, discover innovative ways to repurpose bedding sheets that can add flair and functionality to various spaces in your home.

### Transforming Your Living Space

Old sheets can be cute, functional decor pieces in your living areas. Here are some unique ways to transform them:

- **Tablecloths:** Use your sheets to create a unique tablecloth for dining or coffee tables. A fitted sheet can work particularly well, as it will stay in place.
- **Pillow Covers:** Transform flat sheets into trendy pillow covers. Just cut them to size and sew or use fabric glue to seal the edges.
- **Wall Art:** Stretch a colorful or patterned sheet over a wooden frame to create a piece of wall art. Hang it to add a splash of color to your walls.

These ideas not only help you refresh your living space but do so at little to no cost.

### Practical Uses in Other Areas of the Home

Bedding sheets can serve various practical purposes throughout your home:

- **Pet Beds:** Cut and sew your old sheets into a cozy bed for your pets. Soft and comfortable, your furry friends will love their new sleeping space.
- **Storage Bags:** Use sheets to create lightweight storage bags. Just fold the sheet, sew the sides together, and add a drawstring. They‚Äôre perfect for toys, laundry, or even groceries.
- **Dust Covers:** Protect furniture from dust with old sheets. Drape them over chairs, tables, or any items you're storing.

By implementing these ideas, you can maintain a tidy home while recycling materials that may have otherwise gone to waste.

### Seasonal Decor and Crafts

Don‚Äôt let your outdated sheets collect dust‚Äîuse them for seasonal decorations and crafts! Here are some creative concepts:

- **Holiday Garlands:** Cut sheets into festive shapes, like stars or hearts, and string them together for an eye-catching garland that brightens any room.
- **DIY Slipcovers:** Create slipcovers for chairs or cushions using your sheets. This can be a great way to refresh your d√©cor without spending a lot of money.
- **Gift Wrap:** Instead of standard wrapping paper, use a sheet to elegantly wrap gifts. This not only looks great but also offers a sustainable alternative to traditional gift wrap.

These projects are enjoyable and can involve family and friends, turning creative sessions into memorable bonding experiences.

### Outdoor Adventures

Bedding sheets can also be useful for outdoor activities, making them versatile for nearly any scenario:

- **Picnic Blanket:** Bring a flat sheet on your next outdoor adventure. It provides the perfect spot to relax and enjoy your meals in nature.
- **Beach Cover-Up:** Use a sheet as a quick and stylish beach cover. Just drape it over your swimsuit and feel fabulous while staying protected from the sun.
- **Emergency Tarp:** In unexpected situations like a rainstorm or to keep items dry, a sturdy sheet can serve as an impromptu tarp.

These outdoor uses not only demonstrate the adaptability of sheets but also enhance your experience during outdoor activities.

### Creative Projects for the Kids

Bedding sheets offer endless opportunities for kids to engage their imaginations:

- **Fort Building:** Let your children use sheets to create forts or playhouses within your living room. A few chairs and some imagination can lead to hours of fun.
- **Craft Projects:** Use sheets for arts and crafts. Kids can paint, cut, and glue to make unique art pieces or clothing for dolls.
- **Dress-Up Outfits:** With a little creativity, old sheets can be transformed into costumes for dress-up games, allowing your little ones to become anything their hearts desire.

These projects not only encourage creativity but also provide hands-on learning experiences for children as they explore the world around them.

Ultimately, bedding sheets have a variety of uses that can enhance your home, lifestyle, and creativity. Whether through decor, functionality, or fun activities, it‚Äôs time to see your bedding in a new light.

### Conclusion

Choosing the right bed sheets is crucial for achieving a restful night‚Äôs sleep. The fabric, thread count, and overall comfort directly impact the quality of your slumber. Soft, breathable materials like cotton or bamboo provide a cozy experience, while the right fit helps keep you tucked in without feeling restricted. Prioritizing these factors will turn your bed into a sanctuary of relaxation, ultimately benefiting your health and well-being.

Beyond the bedroom, bedding sheets can be incredibly versatile. With a bit of creativity, you can repurpose them for various fun and functional uses. From crafting stylish tablecloths for your dining area to creating unique wall art, the possibilities are endless. You can use old sheets as picnic blankets, to make DIY storage bags, or even as fabric for simple sewing projects. This way, you not only find new life for your sheets but also add a personal touch to your home decor.

Investing in quality bed sheets and exploring their potential outside the bedroom can enrich your living space and enhance your daily life. By making informed choices about your bedding and getting a little creative, you can improve your sleep environment and find joy in transforming everyday items. Embrace the wonders of sheets, and enjoy the comfort they bring both at night and throughout your home.",1,1736095516.0,GiftShops_pro,0,1.0,False

She‚Äôs super cute and great with kids which is a plus for me. I‚Äôve been building a relationship with her slowly but surely. I got her number not too long ago and tbh she sucks at texting. I usually text her every so often and tell her I hope she‚Äôs having a great day. We‚Äôll exchange a few messages and then she usually quits replying lol. It used to bug me out at first but it doesn‚Äôt really bother me anymore. Anytime I see her out in public she usually makes it a point to come say hey to me and it seems like she‚Äôs happy to see me. The other day she texted me out of the blue and asked what I was doing on the 25th. She then asked if I wanted to go to a wedding with her as her plus one. Which I was cool with because I wanted to hang out with her anyways lol. She then texted me a few days later saying she couldn‚Äôt bring me because when she RSVP she only did it for herself and forgot. Which is fine stuff happens I‚Äôm not gonna get upset over something like that. She said maybe we can go out to lunch on the 26th after church. I said that sounds good and to just let me know what she wanted to do. Idk I feel like I‚Äôm just overthinking everything but I‚Äôm not really sure how to move forward. I‚Äôm back and forth on whether or not she‚Äôs interested in me. I just want some advice on how to move forward with her. I‚Äôm definitely interested in her and want to pursue her but not really sure how to. I also don‚Äôt want to come on too strong and scare her  away. Been thinking about some nice gestures to do for her like bringing her lunch one day to work or coffee but again I don‚Äôt want to come on too strong. Any advice is welcomed at this point üòÇ I‚Äôve been out of the dating scene for about 5 years so it‚Äôs a lot trying to get back into it not knowing where to start. Spent the last 4 years just working on myself trying to become a better me. I feel like I‚Äôm in a great spot right now and want to start dating again. ,1,1736095401.0,dating_advice,6,1.0,False

1hub34m,https://www.reddit.com/r/bunheadsnark/comments/1hub34m/2024_nycb_nutcracker_casting_stats/,2024 NYCB Nutcracker Casting Stats,"Happy Sunday friends, here (barring any last minute casting changes to this afternoon's Sensory Friendly performance) are this Nutcracker season's casting stats. 

Links: [2023 Nutcracker Stats](https://www.reddit.com/r/bunheadsnark/comments/18vhc3b/2023_nycb_nutcracker_female_dancer_casting_stats/); [Fall 2024 Stats](https://www.reddit.com/r/bunheadsnark/comments/1g2v7o0/nycb_fall_2024_casting_stats/)

To be clear, these are stats only for featured roles, to show basically how favored an individual dancer was this season. Many corps and apprentices danced most if not every single one of the 50 shows and are not on this list but deserve major props regardless. And as a disclaimer, a lot of substitutions in Nutcracker season don't make it to the casting sheets, but I did try to make these stats as accurate as possible by looking at curtain call photos and reports from snarkers in this sub (thanks everyone for their reviews!) These numbers are as recent as yesterday afternoon, when I noticed that Mary Thomas MacKinnon had replaced Malorie Lundgren in Hot Chocolate.

Female dancers are ranked by the number of Sugar Plum and Dewdrop performances they did, with Sugar Plum as a tiebreaker, and then by total performances. Male dancers are ranked by Cavalier performances and then by total performances. Debuts are in bold.

[Female dancers](https://preview.redd.it/89sa7bsqa7be1.jpg?width=1792&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=55e58669726137fafeea9e0ef2ed80a125422bae)

Defending champion Unity Phelan and newest principal Emma Von Enck shared the top spot, and then there was a four-way tie of principals to share the bronze medal. As you can see, Nutcracker casting is a lot more stratified than rep season casting. Bizarrely, this year the Dolls only had two casts, inflating the rankings of four relatively junior corps members. Last year there were four casts, and I believe there have been even more than that in the past. 

I expected Olivia MacKinnon to have done better than she ultimately did. I noticed her schedule was rather front-loaded -- I suspect that admin may have planned a Sugar Plum debut for her in case Mearns fell through. The glaring anomaly this season is of course Alexa Maxwell. I've decided that her injury this fall must have cleared up enough to allow her to do her Coffee performances and a Sugar Plum gig, but that a planned Dewdrop debut was postponed due to that role's particular technical challenges. All my conjecture, of course, but the only thing that makes sense to me aside from evil forces conspiring against her.

[Male dancers](https://preview.redd.it/znlnma98d7be1.jpg?width=1770&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dbac0487f9b6f3076762a1fbb476e38a0652bf4b)

Can we all agree that Gilbert Bolden is the next NYCB principal? Astoundingly, out of his 5 Cavaliers, 4 were substitutions for other dancers. That he's the trusted emergency partner of choice gives him a huge advantage. Also, special shout out to Jules Mabie, who danced 29 performances of 5 featured roles, including an emergency Cavalier debut; and Victor Abreu, who also danced 29 performances in addition to a Family Saturdays Cavalier (I don't count those performances in my stats though).

Tyler Angle was a surprise to me -- I heard he struggled in a couple of his Cavalier performances but nevertheless danced 5. 2 of those were Week 6 performances with Sara Mearns, which I think lends credence to my theory that her return was not final for a while and that MacKinnon was likely on deck for a debut (which I think regardless will happen next season).

(Long),"Necessary background info: my extended family on my mom's side doesn't do a Christmas gathering. Instead, on New Year's Day we get together and have a soup supper (it's more like a late lunch). There's Crock pots of different soups, and lots of small bowls so everyone can try a little of everything. There's also wine, snacks, and eventually dessert. After all the food, there's the gift exchange (we don't buy gifts for everyone, more the ""I saw this and thought of you"" style), and we finish the day with euchre and chit chat. All names changed in this story

My cousin, Tori (40s, f), had a stroke a number of years ago, and since moved back in with her mother, my aunt Jenny (60s, f). While I've never been besties with either Tori or Aunt Jenny, I've always respected them and loved them as members of my family, therefore made polite conversation whenever I saw them. The last time I saw Tori was two years ago, as I had to work last year, so I missed the family gathering. 

Soup Supper was scheduled for 1:30pm at Aunt Jenny's house. I had stayed overnight at my partner's apartment, a little over an hour away, and wed stayed up past 1am. For context, I'm used to going to bed at 8pm because I get up extremely early for work, so this was significantly past my bedtime for me. Also, my partner and I had each had 3 glasses of bubbly (neither of us drink much), so we slept in. I also am NOT fast when I wake up on days off, I mosy, I'm sluggish. I did not chug my 2 cups of coffee, I did not rush to get dressed. Additionally, my family is not unaccustomed to someone arriving at least an hour late (my grandmother was infamous for it). So, yes, I arrived at the family function at 2:30pm.

I was polite, cheerful, made a joke that my grandmother's tradition of timeliness is still alive (she passed several years ago), I got a few laughs, and I helped myself to some soup. Tori told me there was a chair in the dining area that I could pull up to the table next to my mom if I wanted (everyone was eating in the living room) and I replied ""thank you, but I'm okay to stand"" and she said ""fine, just don't stand by me."" I assumed since she was sitting by the main walk away, she was concerned someone might bump me while trying to walk by and shed get soup spilled on her, so I paid it no mind.

Later, my brother (39m), who is on the autism spectrum (relevant), moved and sat between Tori and another aunt. Tori was still eating and had a bread roll on the table. My brother LIVES bread and tends to steal food. At one point, my brother reached towards the direction of Tori's food, and, autopilot, I raised my house at him and told him ""no"" (turns out he was reaching for the armrest of the bench he was sitting on). Tori said ""I'm perfectly capable of defending my own food,"" to which I replied ""sorry, I'm not used to other people doing things,"" and she said ""you're not"" with a snarky tone. I thought it was odd, but attributed it to maybe she thought I shouldn't apologize for an autopilot behavior? Either way, I brushed it off, which I'm used to doing with many of my family members. 

Then the dogs were let out. Another aunt brought her 2 dogs, and then there was Tori's dog, Diva (f). All 3 of these dogs are SUPER SWEET, and SUPER AFFECTIONATE. I love dogs, and I'm always the person at any get together that will befriend the dog. Cats too, realistically, if they let me. Diva was literally in my lap, giving me all the love. Soon after, Tori and I are both in the dining area (next to the living room) at the same time, she's getting food, I'm looking at the wines. I said ""when I eventually get a dog, I hope I get one that's as sweet as your Diva,"" to which Tori responds with ""you won't, because that's based on behavior, and your behavior is atrocious."" I finally had enough of the snaps so I said ""okay, what is the deal? Have I done something to you?"" loud enough that I know my mother and 2 of my aunts heard. Tori snapped ""I don't wanna talk about it, just don't talk to me and stay away from me"" walked away into the kitchen, luring Diva with a treat, and said to Diva loud enough that I could hear ""she's being a little bitch, isn't she?!""

I have *no clue* what Tori is referring to, but the last conversation I had with her TWO years ago. She'd asked about my dad, and I told her I don't talk to him because he's abusive, and she told me I was in the wrong because ""he was always nice to me."" I've had other family members tell me they didn't like my choice, but they understood it was difficult, and that my experience with my father was different from their, and they respected my choice because I deserve to be happy in my life. The family members that have told me I was wrong, I also don't talk to.

I completely broke down and began crying. I couldn't stay, I left before dessert. I told my mother to tell the family there was bad news from work, so I had to leave. Later I told her I refuse to go to family functions if Tori is there. She says that Tori is mean to everyone since the stroke, and that I should ignore her. She's lost her job, lost her romantic relationship, and refuses to apply for disability because she thinks it means giving up her horse. I told my mother there's disability services for people that have had strokes with changes in personality, and Tori is deliberately refusing to seek help because I think she likes being mean to everyone.

I had time to think about the breakup. I went to a youth misson trip with some of my friends from church to take my mind off it. But recently after going back to school for university...i start to feel more lonely in some sense. People around me had the love i wanted. 

Fyi i am not a party goer or am i even a social gathering person either so i saw it was never my thing to begin with. But i felt that i wished i had someone to connect with again. Be it spiritually, physically and intimately. I do miss her alot...but we broke up over circumstances we both couldnt avoid. And things started to fall apart and we felt more distant with each other. Mind you we were together for almost 3 years. I still believe she is my soulmate in anyway...but i know i can never be with her and she thinks the same for me. I believe we are both still young and we will never know...maybe we werent soulmates at all..

I didnt tell any of my friends that we broke up. Well soon they figured it out...i appreciate them a lot because they always brought me out and treat me to something or some place nice when they see me being distant. I really appreciate them..but a hole in your heart is still a hole... This is not the entire reason i even decided to share about this. 

Recently they have been this one girl from my youth group and bible study group whp oftens talk to me and takes time off her day just to see me. Most of the time its anything related to our bible study but sometimes, she asks me about my personal life. Her older brother introduced me to her..soon after I asked her to join our bible study. At first she didnt say much to me...but after a while...she started seating next to me in church. Visiting my youth groups coffee corner after church to help me brew coffee...I knew she was interested. 

She's kind, honest, spritually strong and overall an amazing person. Even more she's funny and outgoing which is really my type. But she reminds me too much of my ex. I hate it so much...I often pray to God to help me...because i cant seem to get my mind off it until i cant focus alot in class...I do like her..and i know she does too...but having someone who was just like your ex who i still have mixed feelings for really makes me go crazy...She asked me out recently and i havent gave her an answer...now im worried...and afraid..and nervous...

I feel that every inch of me says no...but every now and then i hear a yes...idk what should i do...i know it will end horribly..but i cant seem to shake it off ",1,1736095219.0,christiandatingadvice,0,1.0,False

1hub00k,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/comments/1hub00k/what_they_do_in_the_basement_at_lumon_and_why/,"What they do in the basement at Lumon, and why severance is required (revisited) ","1.3K of you liked my previous post, [What they do at Lumon, and why severance is a requirement](https://www.reddit.com/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/comments/vb4iqp/what_they_do_at_lumon_and_why_severance_is_a/). It‚Äôs time I finally revisit this theory after a rewatch and reading all the great comments under my original post.

One thing before we start: this theory is *only* about the work being done in the basement of Lumon. There are so many other loose threads that will likely converge by the end of the series, but they are outside the scope of this post.

*Hypothesis*

**LUMON IS TRYING TO RESURRECT KIER EAGAN, EITHER IN MIND OR BODY.** If you are familiar with Character.ai, you can think of this as creating a Kier chatbot, which may eventually be put into a host body.

*How MDR works*

* The source code for Kier‚Äôs consciousness can be found in his recordings and written words.
   * It is possible he also ‚Äúsaved‚Äù data of himself in a primitive manner before he passed in 1939
* Macrodata refinement exists to ‚Äúrebuild‚Äù Kier
   * Kier believed all people to be derived from the Four Tempers (‚ÄúIn my life, I have identified four components, which I call tempers, from which are derived every human soul \[‚Ä¶\] Each man's character is defined by the precise ratio that resides in him.‚Äù). Therefore his own data/consciousness would be comprised of the Four Tempers.
   * Due to the limited technology of his lifetime, Kier‚Äôs data would not be clean. It‚Äôs in a ‚Äúdata soup‚Äù, mixed together with lots of noise.
   * Refiners help sort Kier‚Äôs data back into the Four Tempers
* Employees are severed so they do not inject their own personalities / selves into Eagan.
   * Refiners must ""feel"" the emotion of the numbers
   * Innies have no past experiences / emotions to contaminate the code
   * One their first day as innies, they are tested ensure the procedure was complete and they can no longer recall their own past
* Employees are surrounded by Kier artifacts, and nothing else, so the output is pure Kier Eagan. Since the innie is a blank canvas, Lumon can impress Kier onto their minds and channel his spirit into their refinement work
   * The only words are Kier's (Compliance Handbook)
   * The art offers visual depictions of his life
   * The rewards are all simple things that Kier might have enjoyed as a child when he lived (1841-1939), such as erasers, finger traps, and caricatures.
   * The party food (and glassware) are dated to the late 1800s / early 1900s (deviled eggs and melon balls).
   * The Waffle Party is Dylan literally becoming Kier, in his home.
   * The Breakroom punishment of verbal repetition, similar to writing lines on a chalkboard, is an antiquated form of corporal punishment that Kier may have experienced as a child (Mark‚Äôs hand may have also been struck with a ruler, another outdated form of corporal punishment)

*Clues and evidence*

* When data is sorted into a bin, a pop-up displays the four tempers: WO (woe), FC (frolic), DR (dread), and MA (malice)
* The Macrodata Refiner‚Äôs Handbook (canonical material published online) confirms that refiners are sorting data into the tempers.
   * ‚ÄúA refiner is someone who makes something pure, more usable, and more accessible. As a Lumon refiner, you‚Äôll be removing impurities from data and reorganizing that data into its purest form. \[‚Ä¶\] Knowing the true meaning behind the numbers could inhibit your natural intuition‚Äù
* Two things to know about artificial intelligence:
   * It often uses ‚Äúhuman-in-the-loop‚Äù learning, where models are trained with the help of real humans who teach the AI the correct answers. Refiners are essentially HITL.
   * It uses ‚Äútokens‚Äù. When you ask ChatGPT ‚ÄúExplain daylight saving time‚Äù, the AI does not process this sentence by words. Instead, it is chunked up into numerical tokens, like \[8143, 147, 9009, 27\]. The MDR numbers are these tokens.
* Jame Eagan used the phrase ‚ÄúAnd one day, you will sit with me at my revolving‚Äù. This is not a euphemism for dying. It is an Eaganism for transferring their consciousness from a mortal body to an immortal digital self. Whereas a severed employee drops down an elevator into their innie self, Eagan‚Äôs go through a revolving door into a digital self.
* Many businesses are co-opted by their founders or executives for personal gain. While Lumon is a biotechnology conglomerate, the Eagan family is a cult-like faction within.
   * Milchik emphasizes the Eagan‚Äôs over Lumon at Burt‚Äôs Party: ‚ÄúBut only if you behave in a manner that brings no shame upon yourself, the founder or his progeny.‚Äù
   * Cult attributes: pursuit of some afterlife or immortality, religious-style texts and paintings with Kier as a Jesus figure, referencing Kier as ‚ÄúThe Grandfather‚Äù, use of gaslighting and corporal punishment
* The Eagan wing is called the **Perpetuity Wing**, which is a reference to the ultimate goal of the Eagan‚Äôs to live forever.

*Related theories*

* Other departments may be planning on a physical resurrection of Kier
   * The goats may serve as biological tissue to clone Kier. Their caretaker‚Äôs distress definitely gives you the sense they were raised for the slaughter.
   * Kier‚Äôs house in the Perpetuity Wing is not just part of a museum. It is for Kier to return to his home and a familiar environment.
   * Optics and Design seem to be recreating items from Kier‚Äôs life, again to give him a familiar environment
* Refiners may be more attuned to certain Tempers, and Lumon may have even kidnapped Gemma to get a better Woe candidate.
   * Dylan, who has at least one kid (Milchik claims 3) and most enjoys the incentives, is Frolic
   * Irving, who served in the military and obsessively paints dark pictures of the Testing Room elevator, is Dread
   * Helena, who has a cutthroat outie, is Malice (hence why she was started on the ‚Äúscary‚Äù numbers)
   * Mark, who lost Gemma, is Woe.
      * There is no reason to kidnap Gemma, a Russian literature professor, to act as the Wellness Director unless either A) Lumon saved Gemma‚Äôs life and kept her to test the limits of severance/resurrection on the Testing Floor, B) Lumon used Gemma‚Äôs death to attract Mark to MDR and/or C) Gemma did die, but her body is being used as a host for a test AI, which is why she cannot be released into the real world.
      * Mark‚Äôs ‚Äúfreshman fluke‚Äù may have been the immediate aftereffects of his loss, and now that he is dating again / moving on he has become less productive
      * Mark was also a former history professor of WWI, which may connect him more to Kier‚Äôs lifetime.
   * NOTE: Refiners do not need to only focus on one temper, but having an area of expertise may help complete the files faster
* The Board that speaks through Natalie may not be real people but instead the early stages of Kier‚Äôs AI, his motherBOARD. Jame Eagan is the CEO and can serve as a real-world intermediary when required.
   * The ‚ÄúMIND‚Äù area marked on Petey‚Äôs map may be the server room hosting the motherBOARD
* The MDR file names may be the places, people, things, and memories from Kier‚Äôs life

*Final thoughts*

* The ultimate goal is likely not just Kier, but the entire Eagan lineage. This might explain why some of the items in the basement may map onto other Eagan CEOs, like the office decor and the unseen incentives of paintball and coffee cozies
   * Jame Eagan‚Äôs quote, ‚ÄúCome now, children of my industry, and know the children of my blood‚Äù
* It is not clear why the refiners are given 5 bins, or how the numbers they drag to each bin are sorted into the correct temper. This does not challenge the theory, but is difficult to explain
* Under my theory, the timing of the Dorner truck explosion in the Lexington Letters is just a coincidence (Lumon may still be responsible though)
* There is a more practical theory: Lumon is simply trying to make a product that everyone in the world uses. Under this theory, the basement is simply stress-testing that product in different ways, hence the future expansion into additional departments. The Eagan family‚Äôs private aim may still be to piggyback off of this technology to create an army of followers (As Jame quoted young Helena: ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll all be Kier‚Äôs children‚Äù).",2,1736095147.0,SeveranceAppleTVPlus,1,1.0,False

How do I approach getting her to open up about this?,"My wife \[F35\] and I \[M35\] have been together for around 11 years and married for 7 years. We have no children yet although we are trying. We were separated for the whole of our fifth year of marriage (we had a huge disagreement about how to deal with a fertility problem that spiraled into a toxic mess).

She moved back in with her parents nearby and after a couple of months got a new job in another city and rented an apartment there. She would still come back most weekends and we would meet for a coffee, which was pretty much the only contact we had. We almost always got on well although I think we both went back and forth about whether to go through with a divorce or try to reconcile. However, after less than a year in her new job she suddenly got her old job back, moved back in with her parents and told me that she was firmly committed to reconciling. Shortly afterwards she moved back in, we resolved our disagreement and things have been great since.

The thing is, I suspect that she had an affair while we were separated. There was nothing really definitive but I just got a very strong vibe from her (ie coming back less often, being more distant etc etc), and her sudden move back and change of attitude seems like something that someone would do after an affair didn't work out. I asked her about it shortly before she moved back in and she got quite defensive (which is not like her) and said that she is not the kind of woman to sleep around and that what she did while we were separated is none of my business anyway.

I dropped it because we had bigger issues to deal with at the time but, needless to say, I found her response highly unsatisfactory and it only served to convince me that she was hiding something from me. I'm not a particularly jealous person and to be honest I know I would be able to accept it if she had had a relationship with someone else. However, I find not knowing and her unwillingness to be open with me about it difficult to deal with and it plays on my mind constantly. I also think it absolutely is my business whether she had a relationship with someone else because we were still married the whole time.

I am thinking of asking her and insisting that she be honest with me although I don't know whether this is the right way to handle it. Things have been great since we reconciled and I don't want to ruin that although I just don't think I can let this go. Is there some other approach that would be better here?

**TL;DR - I suspect that my wife had an affair while we were separated and she has been very defensive about the issue when I have raised it. I feel like I need her to open up about it but don't know how to bring it up with her without risking our relationship.**",0,1736095024.0,relationship_advice,73,0.33,False

It had been up just a few hours when I saw it, and I seem to recall it had 8K views on it then and was about 12-13 minutes long.  The video title was something similar to, ""Reviewing Luigi Mangione's order at the worst McDonald's in my city"".  But it was unique in that it was almost two video ideas in one.  It sat with me in general, so yesterday I intentionally went to go re-watch it (or, at least part of it), and found the video has been disappeared.

I had watched the whole thing on Thursday thankfully... this is what I recall:

_Phil started by reading a few online reviews from the worst-reviewed McDonald's in his area.  He proceeded to the restaurant to order a McRib for the first time.  He had expected the experience to be horrendous (combining the worst McDonald's with a menu item he expected to be awful), but to the contrary everything actually turned out great.  The service was fine and Phil enjoyed the McRib.  I feel like I'm missing some filler, but maybe halfway through the video, was a brief musical cutaway about how he couldn't hate the McRib like he had expected to, so his video idea was basically ruined (heavily paraphrasing here, but that was the jist I got).  This transitioned into Phil superimposed over a news report about the Luigi/CEO news event, which had ostensibly occurred while Phil was editing the existing footage -- with Phil exclaiming his video has been saved.  He briefly addressed the hype over the situation and iterated that he did not support the murder.  The remainder of the video was quite humorous (compared to the first half), and consisted of Phil and his current girlfriend driving through McDonald's to order what Phil deemed ""the Luigi special"" -- a black coffee and a hashbrown, which was apparently Luigi Mangione's order the day he was arrested.  They made a bit of a picnic of it, eating them in the park.  The video ended with Phil circling back to the McRib and quipping that we should enjoy it while it lasts, because it might soon be gone forever._

Anyone know the scoop on this lost video?  I find it hard to imagine YouTube would nuke it... nothing was glorifying violence, etc.  It seems Phil has often had second thoughts about a video over the years and removes things sometimes, but this would be record timing for that as far as I'm aware.

I live in NYC and have very limited space. I recently started to redecorate and feel like I am just making everything worse. My biggest priority is having some kind of dining table so I can eat like a human instead of on my couch. I am not set on any of the decor with the exception of the couch since it would be a massive hassle to get rid of. I bought the curtains to try and elevate the space but instead I think they are darkening it and taking away from the beautiful windows that I love so much. 

Two conflicting ideas I‚Äôve had: 
1. Dining nook near A/C window with trunk bench (for storage, which I also desperately need) and a small chair or stool
2. Small desk near A/C window and forego dining nook and get a larger coffee table that I could eat at from the floor 
 
Appreciate any and all thoughts and suggestions. Please disregard the clutter opposite the couch - I am working on selling it and getting it out of the apartment. I also would love to put floating shelves somewhere for my books if possible.

1huauah,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1huauah/i_met_my_soulmate/,I met my soulmate,"This will be a long story and a good portion of it will be context, which I feel is very necessary. There is a decent amount of lead up, but I hope it'll be worth it. Thank you for taking the time to read, it means a lot to me.

About 8‚Äì9 years ago I went to a pretty small art school. Small as in there were only about 100 people in my class. This girl, we‚Äôll refer to her as L, also went to the same school, but was 2 grades higher than me. I forget how it happened but one day I started following this girl on Instagram, and she started following me back. I consider myself to be very socially awkward and she was 2 years above me so I always felt like she was out of reach and intimidating, so we never interacted or talked. We would see each other every so often in the hallways at school. I was always interested in her, she seemed really cool and it seemed like we had similar interests. But I never even though to get to know her. For some reason, someone in a higher grade just seemed off limits or I never believed in myself enough to say anything. (I regret this deeply now)

Flash forward to 8 years later. I just broke up with my ex of 2 years, we lived together and had a pet together. During a good part of the relationship, I had taken a long break from instagram that lasted almost 2 years. I deleted the app. After we broke up, it just felt like the time was right to download instagram again. I started posting again and I was seeing L‚Äôs posts again. I was kind of caught off guard that she was still there. I forget who did it first, but we started replying to each other‚Äôs stories pretty often with slightly flirty comments. There was never a feeling of overwhelming flirtatiousness, it just felt like we were trying to get to know each other more and being nice. But I definitely got the vibe that she likes me.

After a few weeks, I got the feeling that I HAD to connect with this person. After kind of strangely knowing of this persons existence, and it seemed like we had similar interests, I had to shoot my shot. I‚Äôve only asked out someone once before, and they turned me down. One night, living at my dads, I was feeling pretty good about myself considering the situation, I decided to ask her to get coffee with me sometime. Why not? She said yes, and after a few messages back and forth, we had plans to meet at a cafe in a few days.

It‚Äôs now the day of, and I‚Äôm super nervous. Sweating profusely and shaking, but excited at the same time. I got to the cafe about 10 minutes early and parked, sitting in my car for a few minutes just sweating and getting more nervous. I built up the courage to go in. I walked in about 4 minutes before we agreed to meet. The place was packed, no seats anywhere. That made me even more nervous. She messaged me and said she‚Äôll be a few minutes late, which was okay with me. I ordered my drink and by the time it was ready, miraculously a bunch of seats cleared. I got my drink and sat down, which made me feel better but I was still super nervous. I saw her walk in and immediately felt a wave come over me. I didn‚Äôt know what it was because I was still nervous and sweating, but I just felt comfortable. Comfortable with where I was and who I am. Nervously not know what to do while she ordered her drink, I rifled through my bag and pulled out a thing of Burt‚Äôs Bees hand cream. She walked over to sit down, introduced herself and before anything I asked her if she wanted some hand cream. She laughed and said yes. I really don‚Äôt know why I did this, but this was such a good icebreaker. I immediately felt so much better. My nervousness almost completely went away. We had such good conversation. I got lost in her eyes. It felt so natural.

Fairly quickly into the conversation, she told me she was married. It didn‚Äôt phase me at the time because of the circumstances and the fact that she agreed to meet me. She also said she hadn‚Äôt spoken to him in months. I noted this as it felt like they didn‚Äôt have that strong of a relationship. She also told me she lived in Germany for nearly a year in 2020. This just made her seem even cooler to me. After about 40 minutes of us talking, I could tell something was bothering her, so she finished her drink and said she has to go. She got kind of flustered and stumbled over her words a bit. She said it was nice meeting me and took off. I stayed at the cafe for a bit, processing what I was feeling. I felt so good. I didn‚Äôt know it at the time but I had just met someone very special. About 20 minutes after she left, I messaged her to say how I had a good time and asked for her phone number. She said yes.

We texted a lot. We had very in depth conversations and shared very personal things. A few weeks go by and we had gone to movies together and gotten dinner a few times. One time after a movie, we were in my car and we had a conversation about boundaries. She said she wasn‚Äôt looking for anything cause of her situation, and I said I wasn‚Äôt looking for anything because I had just gotten out of a relationship and was still in the process of moving out.

Time goes by and we are texting more and more. I shared things that I‚Äôve never told anyone with her, and vice versa. There is a very strong and deep connection forming. At the same time, we are both kind of keeping it private because of our situations.

One night, I sent her a song I liked and thought she would too. She said, ‚ÄúThats my favorite song. I could kiss you right now.‚Äù This is when I started feeling that I had met someone very special. Up to this point, I never had an interest in ‚Äúmaking a move‚Äù on her or anything like that. I didn‚Äôt know her marriage situation, but I knew how she made me feel. But once she said she wanted to kiss me, it felt like she was looking for more.

A couple months went by of us wanting to see each other, but we couldn‚Äôt really find the right place to because we were both living with our parents and were trying to keep our relationship private. One day my sister said she was going out of town and asked me to stay at her house to feed her animals. I agreed and this felt like a good opportunity to spend time with L in private, in the comfort of a house. I asked my sister if I could have someone over and she said that was fine.

This was very exciting to me as it gave me an opportunity to see how we interact together in a more comfortable setting, as opposed to in the movies or a restaurant. I love cooking, so the thought of being able to cook with and/or for someone I felt a strong connection with really excited me. My sisters house is about an hour from where L was staying at her parent. I made it clear to her that she could spend the night as to not have to drive for a long time through the night. Whenever I said she could spend the night I clarified that I wasn‚Äôt trying to pressure her in any way, and I didn‚Äôt have any expectations.

The day came and L arrived at my sister‚Äôs house. She was in awe as soon as she stepped in the house. Pointing out the designers of her kitchen table, couch, lamps. I could tell her and my sister would be great friends. I went into the kitchen and produces a bouquet of flowers I had gotten her. She melted into my arms and we hugged for a long time. I suggested we sit on the couch because we were just standing there in the entrance of the house. Before I could find the TV remote to put something on, she tried to make a move on me. I awkwardly flinched and she ended up kissing the side of my face. Without hesitation, I grabbed her head and we started making out. We made out for a while. It felt so natural. It felt like time stood still. After some time, (I genuinely don‚Äôt know how long) I said we should probably eat something. We made dinner, had some wine and then I showed her how I rolled a joint and gave her a bit of a tutorial. Every second was magical. There were several moments as she was talking to me where I literally got lost in her eyes. She would be standing there talking and everything got kind of fuzzy for me, except her eyes. We ate, it was lovely, then we smoked a j, also lovely.

Before eating and drinking she was debating if she wanted to spend the night. I reassured her there is no pressure to, but because it was already near night time and we haven‚Äôt spend that much time together yet. So she said she would, which lead to the drinking and smoking since she wouldn‚Äôt be driving.

After we smoked weed, we started making out again. Very passionately. There was a pause and I made the suggestion to move to the bed since we were just standing in the living room. Ill spare the details, but we made love. Taking breaks so smoke more and all the while I kept asking her if this is okay, making sure she felt completely comfortable. After the single best night of my life, we fell asleep together.

The next morning, I woke up and as I opened my eyes, the first thing I saw was her face. She asked me, ‚ÄúHow long have you been staring at me?‚Äù This slightly confused me because I had just opened my eyes. I realized the only logical explanation for this is that we opened our eyes at the exact same time. We got out of bed and asked if she wanted to get breakfast at a diner or someplace. She said she had to go back home and that was fine with me. I walked her to her car, we hugged and kissed, and then she said, ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù and immediately said she didn‚Äôt mean to say that. It didn‚Äôt really phase me because honestly, I felt like I loved her too at that time but I didn‚Äôt want to make things any more complicated so I just brushed it off. She got in her car and went home.

I still had a few more days at my sisters so I asked if she wanted to come back over that night. She said yes. Excited, I made some plans of stuff for us to do so we weren‚Äôt just doing the same thing again. She came over and we got in my car and went to a thrift store. In the store, we went our separate ways to look at clothes. We reconvened to show each other what we found. As we were walking around, she tried on this beige with red and black hounds tooth blazer. I distinctly remember this moment. I was crouching down to look and something, and turned my head and saw her in the blazer. I could not take my eyes off her. She told me she could feel how I was looking at her. It was ‚ÄòThe look‚Äô. After the thrift store, we got a pizza, went home, and again had another incredible night.

In the weeks following, we talked a whole lot and wanted to see each other so bad. We got together about once a week but eventually we would just meet in a parking lot to make out and feel each other up in my car.

Every time we talked, we would find out things we related on that only drew our connection deeper. In the midst of us talking she told me she loved me. I said it back. This is when I realized that this whole time I was feeling true love. Every time I looked into her eyes, when I saw her in that blazer, the second she walked into the cafe. I started falling for her in that moment. It took my a while to realize but I was feeling something new to me, true love. That was the feeling I got in the cafe. A wave of love came over me but I didn‚Äôt know how to interpret it at the time.

We were deep in conversation one day, she told me she feels super close to me and is pretty sure we are soulmates. I agreed. There were so many coincidences in our lives and everything leading to us meeting, how we met, and the fact that we have always felt so comfortable with each other, I felt like we were literally made for each other. We talked about our families meeting. I had visions of her talking to people in my family and fitting right in. Same for me with her family.

One day she texted me and said ‚ÄúI think your mom and step-dad are in Ikea right now.‚Äù I initially brushed it off and thought there‚Äôs no way its actually them. My mom shares her location so I saw she was at Ikea. My heart started pounding. Shes never met my mom but I‚Äôve described her a bit to L, enough for her to know. (My mom is also in a wheelchair so that was kind of a giveaway) L told me she got a feeling in her gut before she actually saw them. I was freaking out. This was a crazy coincidence to me. Not even a coincidence really, this felt like yet another sign to me. I hadn‚Äôt talked about L to my mom at this point but said I would‚Äôve been more than willing to call my mom and explain the situation so L could meet my mom. Because I knew they would get along. She said it's okay, and she never met my mom.

About 3 months after we met, L told me she ‚Äúhas‚Äù to go back to Germany for an undisclosed period of time. (I skipped over a bit here. Earlier she sent me a long text about her marriage and why she went there in the first place. She painted her marriage in a way that made it seem like he married her as sort of a ‚Äúconvenience‚Äù as he works for the gov‚Äôt and this would make it easier for her to live out of the states) The news of her going back was hard for me, but she told me she would try to visit as much as possible and we could see each other when she did. That made me feel better about the situation. We were in love and she has a great opportunity (again) to see the world. I accepted that and decided this would also be an opportunity for me to get back on my feet and get my own place. So by the time she is back, we would have a place to spend time together.

April 19th, 2024. She was leaving for Germany the next day. We met at a very nice park with a little walking path, nature path along some cliffs, and a waterfall. We walked around for a bit and stopped by the waterfall for a bit just to soak in each others‚Äô presence. It was incredible. I felt very comfortable and certain, certain that I want to spend the rest of my life with this person. I had told her before that I wanted to take pictures together because we didn‚Äôt have any. At the waterfall, she whipped out an Instax camera and we took some pictures. I will forever cherish these photos. Later I told her this night did not feel real. It felt like a scripted movie scene because everything was so perfect. She looked out over the water and I put my arms around her from behind. We fit so perfectly and comfortably. It was getting late so we knew it was time to say goodbye. I was dreading this moment. I had a really hard time letting her go. Not only did I want to keep hugging her, hugging her quite literally gave me lots of warmth. The sun had gone down and it got pretty cold, but I was so warm when I was in her arms. I finally accepted it, said goodbye and got it my car. Before I could leave, she ran back up to my car, grabbed my face and kissed me very hard and said, ‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù while we both are balling.

About 2 months later, her best friend and her brother are getting married. (Not to each other, but both of their weddings were the same week) She told me this before and said she wanted to see me when she was here. The week she was here I made sure to clear my schedule so I would have time to see her whenever. The week went by and I didn‚Äôt hear anything from her. I wasn‚Äôt incessant about texting her because I knew she had a lot going on. I didn‚Äôt hear anything until she was back in Germany. She sent me a long text about how she can‚Äôt continue a romantic relationship with me, citing the fact that she just saw 2 very important people in her life get married and she wasn‚Äôt ready to get a divorce. This was hard for me to hear, but I understood.

We didn‚Äôt talk much immediately after that, but it didn‚Äôt take long for us to get back to talking and being very engaged again. We had a very strong connection that neither of us could ignore. She told me several times how she can‚Äôt help herself from taking to me, and that I make her happy. I reciprocated these feelings. I felt the same connection but there was boundary set that I respected and refrained from telling her how pretty she looked.

Over this December, we started talking less and less. When we did, it felt different to me. She was more distant. When I shared things with her that would usually bring her joy, I would get a really dry response. This all hit me about a week ago and lead me to a mental breakdown. I thought about her trying to fix her marriage, have kids with him and live a happy life, without me. These thoughts sent me spiraling. I texted her more and more often, hoping I would be able to do something, but I knew there was nothing I could do. Out of sadness and not knowing what to do I went to my mom and told her a bit of the situation. She told me I have to block her, on everything. I said I would. I wanted hear L‚Äôs voice one last time. I thought this would provide me with some sort of closure. After a few texts of me asking to call her, she called me. It sort of caught me off guard. She told me she was with friends and stepped away for a sec, which made me panic a bit because I didn‚Äôt want to say anything to affect her too much. I said I just wanted to hear her voice, which was true. After the call, I texted her and asked her why she got coffee with me. She said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. I was lonely.‚Äù, told me she was going to block me for a while and then blocked me.

April 19th, 2024 is the last time we saw each other. I am still holding out hope that we will find our way back to each other. I feel like there is something in the universe that brought us together, and we are meant to be close to one another. She taught me a lot about myself, and I will be forever grateful of that. How we met, how we‚Äôve known about each other for a long time, and all the ways we relate and the coincidences, tells me that it not a coincidence. When I took a 2 year break from Instagram, L told me she was going through her followers and saw me. She noted that I wasn‚Äôt active anymore but something made her not delete me. If she deleted me, we would‚Äôve never met. There is a reason we exist on the same timeline. We are the characters in a love story, and I am not ready for that story to end.",6,1736094722.0,stories,0,0.88,False
1huatue,https://www.reddit.com/r/Infidelity/comments/1huatue/i_m35_suspect_that_my_wife_f35_had_an_affair/,I [M35] suspect that my wife [F35] had an affair while we were separated and I can't let it go.  ,"My wife \[F35\] and I \[M35\] have been together for around 11 years and married for 7 years.  We have no children yet although we are trying.  We were separated for the whole of our fifth year of marriage (we had a huge disagreement about how to deal with a fertility problem that spiraled into a toxic mess).

She moved back in with her parents nearby and after a couple of months got a new job in another city and rented an apartment there.  She would still come back most weekends and we would meet for a coffee, which was pretty much the only contact we had.  We almost always got on well although I think we both went back and forth about whether to go through with a divorce or try to reconcile.  However, after less than a year in her new job she suddenly got her old job back, moved back in with her parents and told me that she was firmly committed to reconciling.  Shortly afterwards she moved back in, we resolved our disagreement and things have been great since.

The thing is, I suspect that she had an affair while we were separated.  There was nothing really definitive but I just got a very strong vibe from her (ie coming back less often, being more distant etc etc), and her sudden move back and change of attitude seems like something that someone would do after an affair didn't work out. I asked her about it shortly before she moved back in and she got quite defensive (which is not like her) and said that she is not the kind of woman to sleep around and that what she did while we were separated is none of my business anyway.

I dropped it because we had bigger issues to deal with at the time but, needless to say, I found her response highly unsatisfactory and it only served to convince me that she was hiding something from me.  I'm not a particularly jealous person and to be honest I know I would be able to accept it if she had had a relationship with someone else.  However, I find not knowing and her unwillingness to be open with me about it difficult to deal with and it plays on my mind constantly. I also think it absolutely is my business whether she had a relationship with someone else because we were still married the whole time.  

I am thinking of asking her and insisting that she be honest with me although I don't know whether this is the right way to handle it.  Things have been great since we reconciled and I don't want to ruin that although I just don't think I can let this go.  Is there some other approach that would be better here?

**TL;DR - I suspect that my wife had an affair while we were separated and she has been very defensive about the issue when I have raised it.  I feel like I need her to open up about it but don't know how to bring it up with her without risking our relationship.**",7,1736094690.0,Infidelity,36,0.67,False

The Chemex was a thoughtful gift, but wasn't sure how it would brew.

I kind of avoided a Chemex just based on peoples comments that it was everything a V60 offered but ""less"".

I think with the Coffee sock it delivers a profile I haven't experienced. I realized what I really love (and am sometimes missing from the V60) is a heavy body, and the oils that the coffee sock lets pass through.

I think delivers the body you associate with a French Press or V60 with mesh filter, but a lot cleaner in the cup allowing some of the beautiful coffee notes to stand out (e.g. washed Kenyan beans from Myriade in Montreal).

I started with plastic V60 as a grad student, and it was amazing as I was buying watered down coffee at our department's coffee cart. Plus it wasn't always open during late evenings of experiments in the lab.

This is a welcome addition, and a beautiful piece of gear. Over the years I've acquired different brewers: French press, Switch, V60 with mesh filter, Aeropress, Cafec flower dripper, etc.

I had my first (and hopefully only) seizure a few days ago and that too in the middle of the exam hall. Hadn't slept for more than 4 hrs in the past 48 hrs, had had quite a bit of coffee followed by an energy drink just before the exam started. I felt fine and there was no aura or anything of that sorts until I blink and find myself seated outside the exam hall surrounded by the invigilators asking me something. I didn't know what/sth had happened so I was very confused as to why they wouldn't let me attempt the exam paper. Got back into my senses in like 30ish minutes and was back in the exam hall attempting the paper. Now that I think of it why would they evrn let me give the exam lol I remember looking at the bruises on my arm and thinking eh that's weird, didn't even realise I had bitten my tongue until I had sth to eat later in the day. After the exam finished and I got up I realised that I was rather wobbly on my feet but didn't think much of it until I go out to see my parents and their worried faces. Apparently I ended up creating quite a scene in front of everybody: making weird noises, falling off the seat and well convulsing. 
The most embarrassing bit is that my classmates thought that I had freaked out because of the exam itself and it was just an exaggerated panic attack üò≠ so I still feel like I brought it on myself.
Got to see a neurologist the next day and  ofc it was the sleep deprivation and caffeine. So my current stand is that I would rather fail the exams but show up without getting ample amount of sleep.
Is it wrong of me to blame my awful performance in the examS on the one seizure itself? Also, I can't go forever without pulling all nighters so it feels like a sword swinging over my head that one day I will be stressed out and not get enough sleep and it will happen again
And maybe I am just making too big of a deal out of this when everybody around me seems to have moved on? idk like shouldn't my friends be a little worriedü§£ they did ask me to get some sleep and not worry etc maybe I am just an attention seeker lol - I sound miserable ",1,1736093898.0,Epilepsy,1,1.0,False

1huagzv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC/comments/1huagzv/wibta_for_going_low_contact_with_my_family_after/,WIBTA for going low contact with my family after my mother invited my ex to live with her and work at the same place as I do,"This is quite long I included short version under.

I (26F) started dating my ex (26M) when we were 16. We broke up 8 months later but stayed friends. Months after the break up he came out as gay. (mentioning this so people wont think he wants me back) Anyway we started to drift apart because honestly i just didn't like him as a person. He owed everyone money. He would drink a lot and gossip. He would ask my mom for money to buy cigarettes and alcohol. I got new friends who were so supportive when i didn't have a place to stay and helped me find a job while my supposed best friend was nowhere to be seen. But of course when he needed help with money he suddenly showed up. I wasn't doing good financially so I decided to move to Germany when i was almost 19 and moved in with my mom and decided to go no contact with him because i just didn't see myself being friends with him. Over the years he would try to be friends again and he even kept in contact with my mother all these years but i didn't want to. I asked her to stop talking to him multiple times because it made me uncomfortable when they would talk about me. They never stopped. Once I blocked him from my moms phone (i know it was wrong) and he went crying to my sister who went off on me. Honestly I was too tired from his drama and need for attention. 

I lived in my old city for over 6 years until i got tired of working as a housekeeper and decided to apply for a job in a different city. I wanted to apply in a city 30mins away from where i lived but accidentally applied for one that was 200km away. I was actually excited because i thought i could have a fresh start away from everyone but i saw my mom struggling at work and asked if she wants to move as well and after some back and forth she agreed. ( now i realise it was a mistake ) because now 1 year later after we moved she told me she invited my ex to move here as well and work at the same place as we both do without asking me first. I also found out that my sister and brother knew this for weeks and my sister told my mom to not tell me anything before out family vacation because she knew i wont approve and be in a spoiled mood the whole trip so the best next thing she thought was to just wait when the vacation is over. My mother came over to my place on Friday and just told me about him coming here. I was not only pissed about him coming but also i know in what state my mothers apartment is. Its a disaster. I also had some of my things at her place so i went with her to clean since he will arrive on 13th of this month. She told me she told him to not talk to me because she knows I want nothing to do with him but he didn't listen.

Friday when i got home he contacted me asking general questions about the city including if they sell alcohol 24/7 here..predictable... and then he wanted to talk saying how he thought she told me earlier and then started to get more personal and started talking about my boyfriend. I found out my mother was complaining about my boyfriend to my ex because she does not like him or approve of him because of his religion. My ex started to say how he approves and stuff like that and i honestly don't care. I only thought about how my mother won't stop talking about me to him which makes me angry and disappointed. I told him the details of my relationship are personal and im not gonna share and he just asked ''But can you at least tell if the s&x is good'' honestly after almost 8 years he has not changed. He also wanted me to meet him when he will arrive and i said no. He wanted to get coffee with me and to be friends again and i told him its not happening. He just said that i just think like this for now and will change my mind. I told him 8 years haven't changed my mind so no. He's the same leech as he was back then. He wanted my mother to buy him a ticket, he didn't have a suit case and wanted to borrow..and he cant find his way around and said how this is stressing him out because its the first time he travels alone. Honestly I dont know what to think. 

After talking to my boyfriend i texted him this

'' I'm gonna be honest. I don't want you to come to this town or work at the same place as I do. I don't want to see you or talk to you. I applied to this job wanting a fresh start away from everyone. We will never be friends because im not interested. You're nothing to me and i don't like that you know details of my life or talk to my mother. You are a stranger to me.''

then i blocked him and texted my mother

Me:

'' I blocked his number and texted him before that I don't want him to come here.''

My mother:

''Clear''

me:

''If you need help with money ok, I will pay my bills and help you until your lease breaks and you will be able to get a cheaper apartment. That is if he won't come. If he will come i will stay away from both of you. I will not stop contact with you but I will minimise it. You didn't care what i think and knew i wont be happy about this''

My mother :

''I wont say anything''

The reason why she would taint our relationship and invited him is because she owes a lot of money and wants to charge him rent so she would have more money. 

I'm now considering to move but I don't want to. I have a good job here. My bf is here. And the rent is cheap as well. But i really can't stand the guy. Even my friends that know him as well cannot stand him.

I feel bad about hurting my mother but she hurt me too.

Am I overreacting and wibta if i minimise contact with my family over this?



  
Short version:  
My mom invited my ex who is a leech to live with her and work at the same place as we both do without asking me first because she needs money, lied to me by hiding it for weeks and now i want to minimise contact with my family since they also knew and did not tell me while knowing i will be mad about this.

1huagi1,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1huagi1/if_sugar_is_bringing_out_flavors_for_me_what_am_i/,"If sugar is bringing out flavors for me, what am I doing wrong?","I'm new to pour over, but I've gone between Hoffman, Hedrick, Roswell, and CC's V60 and aeropress guides and have them nailed for flow rates, drawdown times, technique, how the bed should look post-draw down, etc. I feel like every cup has had the same experience the same regardless of four different quality coffees and playing within grind settings in temperatures - varying from bitter to sour to acidic.

I've found that I tend to like lower brew temps better than the higher, but overall I feel like I notice none of the described flavor notes and overall get an unenjoyable cup that's bitter. I've been using:

* K-Ultra anywhere from 6.0 - 8.0 on the dial
* Plastic v60, bleached filters (warming the V60 and dumping the filtered water)
* Stagg EKG Pro Kettle & quality filtered water
* Temps (95-100c on lights, 85-95c on medium/darks

What I found odd was I tried all of these coffees and variations of brewing as black only (how I like my local coffee shops pour over coffees), so I tried throwing in sugar (no milk) to a few of the last ones and suddenly whatever bitterness and weird burnt-like flavors were gone and I could blatantly taste all of the described flavor notes of cherry, amaretto, etc.

So, TL;DR:

If sugar/sweeteners are eliminating the negative taste/experience of the coffee for me and feeling like it's removing the 'noise' and bringing out all of the flavors, is there something that this speaks to that I'm doing wrong with brewing? Water, temp, time, grind, etc.?

I cleaned it, but man. It's one of those days where I wish I couldve gotten up later, had a quiet coffee, and cleaned my room peacefully (it's destroyed with toys right now).

This was an important ‚Äútest‚Äù to give my wife added confidence on the viability of EVs in long distance trips. Overall the SUV passed her skepticism pretty easily but not flawlessly. 

Charging - we were able to exclusively hit RANs during the whole trip. They worked perfectly, were never over-crowded, though my wife did notice a drop in kw rates when another Rivian pulled up and began drawing power from the same cabinet. We were able to get coffee, stretch and relax and time it fairly well with the charging time. We were more conservative than we probably needed to be with doing extra large charging sessions (dual max) as we didn‚Äôt want to rely on charging at the hotel. 

Hotel charging - I believe we lucked out here with some attentive valet personnel but giving a bit of an extra tip helped here üòÄ. We stayed at the Grand Californian which has valet charging. Their official policy is two hours of courtesy charging which on a 6.5 kWh charger isn‚Äôt much. With a $20 tip at drop off the valet kept it on until we got to 80% and they then topped it off on the day of departure which was very nice of them. Again, not completely reliable, given how receptive one valet driver is to the next, but it is possible to get a decent charge through valet. I‚Äôm curious other‚Äôs experience with similar hotels. 

Quirkiness of the SUV - The R1S was basically flawless except for one full reset I needed to do. I noticed while the SUV was parked in valet after a few days it wasn‚Äôt going to sleep. I didn‚Äôt do anything about it but noticed a larger than usual phantom drain, like 2-3% but given it was the tail end of our trip I left it as is at valet. When we got on the road, all of the sensor warning lights were on, ACC and driver assist were unavailable and the map was completely bonkers, showing our position like 20 miles west of where we actually were. I did a full reset at a RAN and everything came back normal, so I‚Äôm not sure what happened with it parked at valet. 

Overall my wife thought the trip went well, I think we now have more confidence to do smaller, more frequent charges so that the time to charge doesn‚Äôt take so long.
