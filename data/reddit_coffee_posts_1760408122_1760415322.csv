Its [Rigonix3D.com](http://Rigonix3D.com) . The website offers around **250+ free animations**, the aim while creating the website was quite simple, i want to give community some good **alternative of mixamo** \[Only for downloading animations\].

I have updated the look of our website too and done the suggested changes from previous feedbacks.   
I am not great at Adobe's Mixamo, but i want to build it a good platform. As this is a indie project and i am a student ,paying the cloud services bills by my college scholarship \[so it‚Äôs been a tough but journey\].  
We have successfully reached 300+ registered users \[I know its slow progress\] and **4.7K+ Active Users**.

 Few months back, when mixamo was down for few days, rigonix3d helped various users in downloading the animations they need.

  
But now i am tensed about the future of rigonix3d, should i run it or should i close it.  
I really want to have a motion capture suit, so that i can upload more high quality animations and provide it to community, I don't know anything about funding, but heard something about crowdfunding.   
What do you think, i rigonix3d a good idea? Or should i drop it.   
I have given my 3-4 months of dedicated hardwork while creating it.   
Just need your advice.

Your smile is one of the first things people notice, and choosing the right dental professional is essential for achieving natural-looking, healthy results. Cosmetic dentistry combines art and science, enhancing both the appearance and function of your teeth. From teeth whitening to veneers and complete smile makeovers, a skilled cosmetic dentist can transform your confidence and oral health.

# What is Cosmetic Dentistry?

Cosmetic dentistry focuses on improving the visual appeal of your teeth while maintaining or enhancing dental function. Common procedures include:

* **Teeth Whitening:** Removes stains and discoloration for a brighter smile.
* **Dental Veneers:** Thin porcelain shells cover imperfections like chips, gaps, or uneven teeth.
* **Dental Crowns:** Protects damaged teeth while restoring their shape and appearance.
* **Invisalign and Braces:** Aligns teeth for a straighter, healthier smile.
* **Bonding:** Repairs minor cracks or chips using tooth-colored resin.

These treatments not only improve aesthetics but also contribute to oral health. For instance, straighter teeth are easier to clean, reducing the risk of decay and gum disease.

# Choosing the Right Cosmetic Dentist in Sydney

Selecting the best cosmetic dentist in Sydney requires careful consideration. Here‚Äôs what to look for:

* **Experience and Expertise:** Look for a dentist with specialized training in cosmetic procedures. Experienced dentists understand the nuances of facial aesthetics and dental structure.
* **Portfolio of Work:** Reviewing before-and-after photos of previous patients helps you evaluate the dentist‚Äôs style and skill.
* **Patient Reviews:** Reading testimonials and online reviews provides insights into patient satisfaction and the quality of care.
* **Technology and Techniques:** Modern cosmetic dentists use advanced imaging, digital smile design, and minimally invasive techniques for precision and comfort.
* **Personalised Consultation:** A dentist who listens to your concerns and explains all available options ensures you get a treatment plan tailored to your needs.

# Benefits of Cosmetic Dentistry

Cosmetic dentistry offers more than just visual improvement. Key benefits include:

* **Boost in Confidence:** A bright, even smile can positively impact personal and professional interactions.
* **Improved Oral Health:** Treatments like bonding and crowns protect teeth from further damage.
* **Long-lasting Results:** Many cosmetic procedures are durable and designed to last for years with proper care.
* **Functional Benefits:** Correcting misaligned teeth can improve bite and chewing efficiency.

# Popular Cosmetic Dentistry Procedures in Sydney

* **Teeth Whitening:** Quick and effective, professional whitening treatments provide a noticeable improvement within a single visit.
* **Veneers and Crowns:** Perfect for repairing damage, covering discoloration, and enhancing shape.
* **Dental Implants:** Replace missing teeth with a solution that looks and functions like natural teeth.
* **Orthodontic Solutions:** Invisible aligners and braces improve teeth alignment discreetly.
* **Gum Contouring:** Enhances smile aesthetics by reshaping uneven gum lines.

# Maintaining Your Results

After cosmetic procedures, maintaining your results requires proper care:

* Brush and floss daily to prevent decay and staining.
* Attend regular dental check-ups to monitor oral health.
* Limit foods and drinks that stain teeth, like coffee, red wine, and berries.
* Follow your dentist‚Äôs instructions for post-procedure care, especially after veneers, bonding, or whitening.

# Conclusion

Finding the right **cosmetic dentist Sydney** offers is crucial for achieving a smile that reflects your personality and boosts confidence. By considering experience, patient reviews, and modern techniques, you can select a dentist who delivers safe, effective, and aesthetically pleasing results.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ajpisv/my_husbands_m32_sabbatical_has_become_pathetic/): **January 25, 2019**

We're both early 30s, married, no kids. We own a house together (mortgage).

My husband worked for the same company for almost a decade. He earned a good salary, but the last few years were rough on him thanks to his overbearing boss. He discussed quitting every so often, and I was open to the idea as long as he had another job lined up.

Well last year, he quit spur-of-the-moment over a seemingly minor dispute at work. He would later call it ""the straw that broke the camels back"". No other jobs lined up, nothing. He assured me that he had savings he could live on and that he wanted to take some time to ""re-calibrate"". He also 'had a few business ideas' he wanted to pursue before getting back into the workforce. Trying to be a supportive partner, I said okay...

Fast forward to today -- he has no income and literally hasn't sent out a single job application. He hasn't even updated his resume. What has he been doing these passed 8 months, you ask? Smoking weed, a bunch of scammy 'work-from-home' bullshit that hasn't made him a dime, and most recently, trying to become an 'Instagram Influencer'. Yes, seriously.

To be fair, he has also done some handy-work around the house and fixed up some things. But for the most part, he spends his days smoking weed and dicking around on Instagram, and I'm effectively subsidizing it -- we used to split bills 50/50, now it's more like 80/20.

The last time I tried to have a serious talk about his future plans, he ""jokingly"" said I could divorce him and pay him alimony if I didn't like the current situation. Then he broke down and wept, saying that he might be depressed. I felt horrible for him and offered him my full support, but in retrospect, I'm curious if it was just a convenient excuse to pivot the conversation and get me off his back.

What would you do in my shoes? I have grown resentful of him and this whole situation.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** If he thinks he has depression then he needs to see a doctor and get help. It only gets harder alone, I'd see how that goes first, because it might get him back to his feet. If he declines that and won't change, you can't change him.

> **OOP:** Ugh that's a whole other issue. He read some book last year and now he ""doesn't believe"" in anti-depressants (or thinks that they're way over-prescribed).
> 
> When he told me he was depressed and I suggested seeing a doctor, he said no -- he'll figure it out himself and to just help be there for him.

**Commenter 2:** Honestly he sounds more like a punk then a grown man lol. It's one thing to not work if your a stay at home parent, etc... A completely other thing if your just a lazy bum.

Dudes taking advantage of the situation and quite frankly you.

> **OOP:** He wasn't always like this. He was responsible and hardworking before he quit. But I agree, I feel like I'm being taken advantage of now.

**Commenter 3:** In your shoes I would:

\* get him to undertake a specific plan for job applications;

\*apply for at least 5 jobs a day, and prove to you that he does so;

\*alternatively, immediately enroll into relevant further education; or

\*leave

> **OOP:** I thought of this too, giving him tasks and 'checking in' on his progress. But it's not the way our relationship has ever worked. Frankly, it sounds like something a parent would do with their child, not one spouse to another.

**Commenter 4:** 

> Trying to become an ‚ÄòInstagram Influencer‚Äô

Nope dump him

> **OOP:** Honestly this part is very annoying and what's caused me to actually seek help with my relationship. His ego and mood are wrapped up in his Instagram thing, it's all he's talked about for weeks now. He'll ""lose followers"" after a post and get moody about it. It's pathetic and I've just had enough.

**Is OOP working?**

> **OOP:** I work full-time. I make a decent income but if my husband can't contribute anything toward our monthly expenses, I don't make enough to cover them totally myself.

[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/alro8i/update_my_husbands_m32_sabbatical_has_become/): **January 31, 2019 (six days later)** 

First, thanks to all who responded to my prior post. A lot of good advice that has helped me navigate this situation.

On the day I made my last post, my husband and I had a talk that night when I got home from work. I basically said he needed to make a doctors appointment for his mental health, or cut out the marijuana use, or both. He repeatedly refused and actually got a bit hostile about it, which is not like him at all.

Then I moved onto finances. I asked him how much of his savings he had left, and all he said was ""enough"". I pressed him for a dollar figure and he wouldn't answer. I asked if he had a balance on his credit card and he said no. When I asked to see his bank statement to confirm, he basically told me to fuck off -- again, hostile and out of character for him.

I told him that the current arrangement wasn't working, and that he'd have to start paying 50% of the bills on March 1st. At this point in the conversation, he completely shut down. He wouldn't even look at me, he just sat looking away from me with tears in his eyes as I talked. I doubt he even heard a word I said, but I clearly stated all the other issues I had -- the Instagram stuff, our plans for the future, etc.

After this conversation, he stopped sleeping in our bed. For almost a week now he's slept in the basement. He basically doesn't leave the basement when I'm home unless it's to get food. Honestly, it's pathetic.

I am going out with some colleagues this weekend for a fun night, and my husband can stay home like a hermit. I also have a coffee date planned for Sunday with my best friend -- I am going to tell her everything and get her opinion. Because honestly, this isn't the life I want to live and trying to correct it only made things worse. I am beginning to think of divorce as a real option, which would have seemed outrageous even 3 weeks ago.

Thanks again for reading and giving your input.

**Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** He sounds extremely depressed, ashamed and embarrassed of himself

**Commenter 2:** your husband is clinically depressed and needs to see a doctor. this is a mental health issue that only gets worse, and the marijuana is a part of the feedback loop. he needs professional treatment as soon as possible.

**Commenter 3:** How long has this marriage been going on?? It seems like you‚Äôre used to everything being 50/50. But it‚Äôs not how it always is in reality I‚Äôm not saying put up with this shit. But your husband is clearly in a bad place and needs help. The way you explained confronting him about all of this sounds, to him, like an attack. We know it isn‚Äôt, but it‚Äôs probably how he felt. And 9 times out of 10 he KNOWS you‚Äôre 100% right. It sucks to hear the truth! And it also sucks to feel like a complete failure then be told every way how you‚Äôre completely failing. Both my fianc√© and I felt this way when we had to essentially switch off on taking care of the responsibilities. it was embarrassing having to depend on him and it was unbelievably embarrassing for him as the man in the relationship. We had countless difficult and emotional talks about this.

Again, I‚Äôm not saying put up with this because you‚Äôre married. I‚Äôm only commenting because of the fact that you seem to be really focused of this ‚Äú50/50‚Äù thing and I personally feel like marriage isn‚Äôt always going to be 50/50. Sometimes it‚Äôs 49/51 and sometimes it‚Äôs 8/92. Does he contribute to the household at all?? Like does he cook, clean, do laundry, finish home projects, runs house errands?? Or do you also take on those responsibilities? (If you‚Äôre also doing all of this. It‚Äôs extremely unacceptable and he is taking advantage of this situation) But again, I‚Äôm not telling you to deal with his behavior! Just trying to help find a solution. You know your limits better than anybody else! Don‚Äôt forget that!!

**Commenter 4:** If he won‚Äôt seek help, he‚Äôs choosing to check out of the marriage. He‚Äôs turning into a different person and since he refuses to talk about the credit cards, who knows what he could be doing to your credit.

Edit: what is OP supposed to do? This has been going on for 8 months according to her prior post. She can‚Äôt force him into treatment, you can only involuntarily admit someone if they‚Äôre currently a danger to themselves or others. If he‚Äôs hostile to her and refusing help, that‚Äôs his personal decision. He does retain some accountability here.

[Update #2 (rareddit)](https://www.rareddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b4nxbu/update_2_my_husbands_m32_sabbatical_has_become/): **March 23, 2019 (nearly two months later)** 

Thanks again to all who responded to my prior thread, even if I didn't agree with the characterization of my relationship by many of the commenters. I did take some advice to heart though, including not sharing my husbands issues with my friends.

My husband continues to sleep in the basement. I asked him a few times to start sleeping in our bed again, he'd say ""maybe"" but never actually do it. We have stopped having sex entirely, but I have heard him watch porn in the basement.

On the morning of March 1st, we had a horrible argument when I asked for his half of the monthly bills. He e-transfered me about 2/3 what he should have, and when I asked for the rest he exploded. He just kept saying ""fuck off"" louder and louder, over and over as I tried to say that he needed to contribute his fair share.

Then he started talking about his depression again. Literally the only time he will up his ""depression"" is when I'm criticizing his shitty life choices. He hasn't even seen a doctor or been diagnosed, yet he uses it like a ""get out of jail free card"" to be totally unproductive and not pay bills.

So I told him point blank: ""either see a doctor for your depression and start fixing your life, or this marriage is over"". It sounded so harsh but those are honestly the only two options at this point. He made some quip about me paying him alimony if I divorced him (not the first time he's said this) and that was the last we spoke of it.

We have briefly seen and talked to each other since then, but there's no warmth there anymore. It's like we're roommates. Last week he told me he booked a doctors appointment and I was happy for him, but as far as I can tell he never ended up going (even after I offered to take the day off and drive him to the appointment). I don't think he's left the house in over 2 months. I have stopped cooking him meals so he now subsists on instant noodles he bought off Amazon.

I met with a divorce lawyer for the first time earlier this week. He was excellent and gave me a comprehensive rundown of all my options. When I told him about my husband's alimony comments, he laughed and said ""not a chance"". He voluntarily quit his job against my wishes, he has no official diagnosis from a doctor that would preclude him from working... I don't know where he got it in his head that he'd be entitled to alimony from me.

I am holding on to a shred of hope that my husband will put forth some kind of effort to get better and repair our relationship. I pray every night that he'll do a complete 180 and start being his normal self again. But if nothing changes, I plan to meet with my lawyer again sometime in early April and officially file for divorce.

**Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Your ultimatum was appropriate.

But since he's not changing, now you have to carry it through.

**Commenter 2:** You did all that you could. In fact, this might be the best thing for your husband as well.

Getting out of the cycle of depression is incredibly difficult without therapy or a drastic change. Losing his wife and having to live alone without an income might just be enough to make him seek help.

**Commenter 3:** I‚Äôm sorry about all this.

Don‚Äôt hold out too much hope. Good on you for taking charge.

[Update #3 (rareddit)](https://www.rareddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ccaods/update_3_my_husbands_m32_sabbatical_has_become/): **July 12, 2019 (nearly four months later)** 

First, thanks to those who left comments in my prior posts. Hearing advice from all angles really helped me make practical, informed decisions during this extremely volatile time in my life.

The TL;DR version is that we are separated, with plans to divorce in 1 year.

I finally got him to see a doctor. I wasn't in the room for the diagnosis, but the doctor suggested my husband look into Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and SSRIs. Of course, my husband was opposed to both -- he could ""read about CBT online"" and I've known for a while that he's outright hostile to the idea of taking anti-depressants. (he describes them as ""brain warping"")

We had a week or so in April where things almost felt normal. We talked more, ate dinner together, slept in the same bed together, even had a date/movie night. I felt so hopeful, things truly seemed to be getting better. It didn't last though, we had a fight about something completely innocuous and things quickly fell apart again.

One day after work, I sat in my car and was completely overcome with dread. The thought of going home to my broken relationship... it was too much. I drove around aimlessly for hours, wondering how in God's name my life had turned out like this. Half the time I was sobbing, I must have looked crazy. This was my breaking point. I was done with the relationship and the marriage for good.

When I told him my decision, he wept openly (as did I). He said he was sorry but that he understood. He didn't ask me to reconsider or make any effort to save the relationship, which tells me it was right decision for both of us. He moved into his parents basement a few weeks ago.

I am still in a rough place emotionally. I pray that time will heal me and that I'll be able to find love again

**Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** It‚Äôs one thing to have depression, but it‚Äôs another one entirely to get a diagnosis and then refuse treatment.

I‚Äôm actually glad he moved back in with his parents, as they can keep an eye on him and make sure he‚Äôs okay ‚Äî or as okay as possible. If you‚Äôre on good terms with them, you may want to tell them some of your concerns about him.

**Commenter 2:** You are both relatively young and have no children. The fact that when you verbalised your decision to divorce, there was no confrontation or mention of attempting reconciliation is telling. Honestly this is probably the best outcome for both of you. Him living with his parents means that there will be someone looking out for him whilst he sorts out his issues and you will have the space and freedom to move on with your life. Good luck to you.

**Commenter 3:** Sad that its come to this. But it seems like the natural conclusion for so many relationships. Even in cases where one party does try to become better, the other party ends up checking out at some point and the relationship ends anyway.

Your husband is an adult and has made some choices, for better or for worse and he has to face those consequences. I'm truly sorry your marriage has ended, but I think we can both agree that your future lies down a different path.

1o65gey,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticMothers/comments/1o65gey/spouses_family_overstepping_for_years_affecting/,"Spouse‚Äôs Family Overstepping for Years ‚Äî Affecting Our Relationship, How Do We Move Forward?","My partner and I have been together for almost 15 years, married for most of that time. Our relationship has always been grounded in mutual respect, patience, and support. However, one side of my partner‚Äôs family (I'll call them the ‚Äúdifficult family‚Äù) has consistently overstepped boundaries, and it‚Äôs reached a breaking point. The other side of the family is respectful and considerate, so we‚Äôre left asking, why is it so different with this side?

From the very beginning, the difficult family ‚Äî particularly the mother ‚Äî has been intrusive. When we lived near them, the mom and dad would visit often, staying from Friday night to Sunday evening or Monday morning, engaging with us constantly from the moment we woke up to late at night. It left us no space to breathe. We brought up that this wasn‚Äôt sustainable. We told them our home was too small and suggested they stay at a hotel or Airbnb. The dad was understanding, but the mom was put off. Over time, they began leaving earlier in the evenings but still found ways to push boundaries (drawing out visits by saving a gift to open or asking for a coffee or tea after prolonging the dessert).

An example of the overstepping by their mom and dad was when we booked our first all-inclusive vacation ‚Äî a trip to Mexico ‚Äî and shared the itinerary with family, just for safety. The difficult parents decided to surprise us by booking a trip to the same resort, overlapping a few days. The dad again expressed doubts, but the mom insisted. They showed up on our vacation uninvited and tried to align their plans with ours. When they were asked to explain they just said that they thought it would be fun. The partner whose parents were not involved was gracious, but it was incredibly uncomfortable. After that, we agreed never to share travel plans with them again and it‚Äôs worked.

Fast-forward to having kids (who had just turned 2 and 4), and things got worse. In late 2023, our landlord gave us notice that they were selling the house we rented. Amid this chaos, the difficult parents decided to visit us during this tumultuous time. We were not even ready to pack or move and we hadn‚Äôt invited them and already had a lot to contend with a potential move including going to places to visit. They said that they wanted to watch the kids at their place. To our surprise, the mom decided to rent an Airbnb that was a second floor, with steep, older stairs. Their dad had balance issues and a medical condition, and our young kids had just learned to open doors. Even the dad was flustered with the mom for getting that place and we offered to get them a new place but the mom refused.¬† The mom was getting a ‚Äòdeal‚Äô and so it was not refundable and that it was totally safe.¬† We didn‚Äôt agree since our children were getting into the phase of opening the doors and they were falling down the steps outside of the door already at our place.¬† So we made two very clear rules:

They were never to take the kids down the stairs without us present.

The door to the staircase needed to be always blocked with chairs/suitcases (we even showed them how).

They agreed.¬† But during their visit, we found they consistently broke both rules. The door was never blocked, and the kids were taken down the stairs multiple times without our knowledge. ¬†We were intentionally taking breaks during the day to visit the parents and kids and to take them out to lunch and spend time outdoors.¬† When we tried to bring it up calmly at the end of their visit, the mother refused to sit down, stood in the doorway, and brushed it off saying, ‚ÄúKids need to learn to do stairs. You‚Äôre overreacting.‚Äù She twisted facts to justify her behavior and refused to take accountability. Her last words as she left were: ‚ÄúI did nothing wrong and will do whatever I want, whenever I want. I don‚Äôt have to listen to this.‚Äù

After that visit, my partner and I had a long, serious conversation. We agreed that this crossed a major line. The issue wasn‚Äôt just about stairs ‚Äî it was about betrayal of trust and refusal to respect boundaries.

We also made an effort to stay connected with the rest of the family. That Christmas, we visited the side of the family that remained more welcoming, and there was also an attempt to reconnect with a sibling who hadn‚Äôt been informed of our holiday plans due to ongoing tension. Unfortunately, the call became emotionally charged, and the sibling lashed out, later leaving a message saying they no longer wanted to be in contact. It was a painful moment, especially considering the years of goodwill and consistent effort that had gone into maintaining that relationship.

This sibling has often shown signs of social difficulty‚Äîpossibly related to being on the spectrum‚Äîand there had been many attempts over the years to support and include them. They were regularly invited to social gatherings, snowboarding trips, and bar crawls‚Äîefforts made not out of obligation, but with the hope of helping them feel more comfortable and confident in those settings. There was never any expectation in return‚Äîjust a sincere desire to be a supportive presence.

Following the fallout, a long and thoughtful letter was written in hopes of clarifying intentions and repairing the relationship. Portions of the letter were read aloud during a phone call, but the sibling wasn‚Äôt open to hearing it at the time. 

In an effort to fix things, my partner began therapy. However, the therapist quickly realized that crucial facts had been left out in the initial recounting of events ‚Äî specifically, how manipulative the difficult mom had been. When the therapist concluded that the mom‚Äôs behavior was narcissistic, my partner wasn‚Äôt ready to accept that diagnosis and switched therapists. The pattern continued with the second therapist, who came to the same conclusion. Yet despite hearing this, my partner still doesn‚Äôt want to sever ties with their mom.

And we thought things couldn‚Äôt get worse; it did.¬† In the spring, we had a wedding to attend and told the difficult parents we didn‚Äôt trust them to watch the kids due to past issues. We invited other family to help instead. They were hurt and declined to join us at the hotel as we were planning. Later that weekend, the difficult spouse (again, trying to keep the peace) brought the kids to visit their family without the husband and against his wishes ‚Äî and didn‚Äôt bring up any of the prior concerns. The problematic spouse blamed several excuses for the lack of resolution and effort at trying to address the difficult topic. The mother then posted multiple photos of the kids on stairs to a shared album, almost as a taunt. When the other spouse found out, the other spouse felt betrayed. Even the extended family who helped with the wedding childcare were upset that my partner chose not to address any of the issues when the opportunity was right there and because that partner said they would do exactly that and that was their purpose in going. This partner didn‚Äôt think what they did was really that wrong and that they were just trying to enjoy some of the normalcy.

Recently, we learned (by accident, from the dad who forgot it was a ‚Äúsecret‚Äù) that the brother was going to get married and chose not to invite my spouse ‚Äî let alone me. When asked why, the brother said it was his choice and that the husband would definitely not be allowed to come.¬†

The non-problematic spouse started to see more clearly how the spouse‚Äôs relationship with their family ‚Äî especially their mom ‚Äî has damaged our marriage and their own sibling connection. After reading Reddit and came across posts about narcissistic mothers. It clicked. The controlling behavior, the manipulation, the refusal to accept boundaries ‚Äî it all matches.

What‚Äôs most painful is that my partner acknowledges this is true. They admit their mom has always been difficult, and that, as a child, it was easier to ‚Äúgo along with things‚Äù than deal with her anger. But even now, as an adult, they avoid conflict with her out of fear ‚Äî not love. Despite recognizing how harmful this dynamic is, my partner struggles to confront it directly. They still hold out hope that things can be fixed, that they can ‚Äúlearn‚Äù to stand up to their mom.

When we went low-contact for a while, something amazing happened: we stopped fighting with each other. It became evident that many of our conflicts were fueled or even instigated by my partner‚Äôs mom and her toxic influence. But when it comes time to draw firm boundaries, my partner hesitates. They can‚Äôt seem to break free of the programming that was instilled in them by a narcissistic parent.

Coming from the spouse with the difficult family, ‚ÄúI know I‚Äôve contributed to this mess by avoiding conflict, being passive, and making excuses for my mom. I‚Äôm trying to work on setting boundaries, but I‚Äôve let it go too far. My spouse is hurt, my sibling relationship is pretty much gone, and I feel stuck. I want things to be better, but I‚Äôm lost on how to do that ‚Äî especially when it involves someone as controlling as my mom.‚Äù

We feel stuck. I‚Äôve tried explaining to my partner that the same toxic behavior they‚Äôve cut out of my life shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to continue affecting our marriage. But they still can't bring themselves to sever ties with their mom, even when it‚Äôs at the cost of our relationship.

Here‚Äôs where we need help:

Has anyone been in a similar situation? How do you help a partner recognize the deep-rooted dysfunction in their relationship with their narcissistic mother? How do you rebuild your marriage when one partner can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt see how their family‚Äôs manipulation is damaging everything around them? How do you help someone see that the boundaries they‚Äôve been taught to ignore for years are not only necessary, but essential for the health of their relationships?

Any advice on how to get through to a spouse who is still tangled in the programming of a narcissistic parent would be greatly appreciated. We‚Äôre lost and need help figuring out how to move forward from this disconnection.

1o65c1h,https://i.redd.it/6curmv0i20vf1.jpeg,"Lambie, hypocrisy, and the misinformation & disinformation bill","Posted on : 07/09/2025

There is an old Q&A segment being resurrected on X between Yassmin Abdel-Magied and Jacqui Lambie where they debate the ideological value of Sharia Law.

Lambie is criticising Islam‚Äôs Sharia Law for its treatment of women and incompatibility with Australian culture while Abdel-Magied defended her personal interpretation of the faith.

‚ÄòAnyone who supports Sharia Law in this country should be deported,‚Äô said Lambie.

Lambie also calls out migration:

‚ÄòI would rather look after our own backyard first, which we‚Äôre not, we‚Äôre actually taking from the poor ‚Ä¶ somehow, when we‚Äôve got one-third of our pensioners ‚Ä¶ living on or below the poverty line something needs to be done and if that means we need to put a hold or ban on that for two years, to fill in that gap to make sure that those people in our own backyard get what is needed ‚Ä¶ you know, we need to look after our own backyard first.‚Äô

Her words are an echo of the conservative commentary we saw from ordinary Aussies who attended the weekend March for Australia rallies. Their grievances? Housing. Jobs. Cost-of-living. Safety. And cultural protection. Perfectly legitimate.

(No, we are not talking about the fringe neo-Nazis.)

These Australians put their feet on the pavement and raised their national flag out of frustration against a government whose relentless mass migration policy and concerted effort to destroy pride in the rich history and culture of Australia.

The Q&A video of Lambie criticising mass migration is from eight years ago, long before Albanese‚Äôs reckless decision to bring in over a million people.

One might presume that Senator Lambie would feel vindicated.

Instead, Lambie was interviewed on ABC News last week, appearing to blame anti-immigration sentiment on misinformation and disinformation spread online.

‚ÄòIt is very unfortunate that there is a few Australians out there who believe their right is to go out there and protest and that that is going to make for a peaceful country. And if you want to go and support neo-Nazis then that is absolutely shocking and you probably need to go and have a good look at yourself in the mirror and probably get off social media, and stop reading the misinformation and disinformation that is going on. Once again, we are going off the topic here of what should be done is these social media companies need to be reined in. They need to be regulated. Nobody seems to have the courage up here to do that.‚Äô

The host seeks to clarify, asking, ‚ÄòSo, you think a lot of this stuff is spreading through social media?‚Äô

‚ÄòOh, absolutely, it‚Äôs spreading through social media. We‚Äôve seen it with Covid. Absolutely shocking. And once again we have done nothing about the misinformation and disinformation that is floating around on social media.‚Äô

Let us address the topic of government censorship for a moment, because that is what Lambie is calling for when it comes to social media (and what the Greens and Labor will swiftly deliver).

Many in conservative politics who are hostile to the digital world might even cheer censorship along, to their peril. After all, the Misinformation and Disinformation bill came from the Liberals while plans to biometrically gatekeep the internet (due to start in December) was a Liberal idea which Labor ran with. To protect the kids, allegedly.

We have a working example of what a censored internet looks like, and it was anything but a Utopia of truth.

It is widely acknowledged that the biggest source of misinformation and disinformation during Covid was the government, followed closely by international health authorities.

Much of what they said was wrong, and they knew it was wrong from the start.

Almost half a trillion dollars was made by pharmaceutical companies during the pandemic with most of it sourced from public money. That money has left the country and can no longer be used on public projects. Censorship played a role.

A voluntary vaccine versus a mandated (or heavily coerced) vaccine represents a huge difference in customer numbers.

At the time, social media was not an unregulated Wild West, but rather a treacherous environment for speech policed by Silicon Valley interests in bed with governments spending public money while engaging in anti-democratic lockdowns, privacy infringements, dehumanising rhetoric, and abuses of body autonomy.

They broke every workplace convention, every privacy standard, and every freedom of movement norm. As for so-called ‚Äòscience‚Äô, it became the slave of Parliament.

Were some people having crazy discussions online? Sure. They do that down the pub, too. Humans have been fantasising about conspiracies since the first spark of fire and they will do so until the last cinder of civilisation dies out. It is not an excuse for government censorship.

We should at least learn the lesson: censoring the internet is exactly what the government tried during Covid and it would be a terrible idea to give them the liberty to do so again on the topic of mass migration.

Ms Lambie has complained in the Senate about the sort of phone calls her office received from people during the pandemic. We may inform the Senator that many of us were unsettled by her pandemic-era comments which included the following:

‚ÄòThose anti-vaxxers out there, the 20-30 per cent, the ones out there protesting on the streets and doing that sort of thing are going to find the rest of us are coming at you lock, stock, and barrel. We‚Äôre going to be putting the pressure on you fairly hard because the rest of us that are trying to do the right thing by the country and our kids and get vaccinated and do the right thing, I think for you, we‚Äôre going to start to get even more agitated and we‚Äôre going to start to get even more hardcore. And I think that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre going to see. Massive division out there. And it will be us on the front foot. That‚Äôs what I think‚Äôs going to happen. I think the tide is going to turn on those anti-vaxxers out there and they are really going to feel the heat.‚Äô

Imagine if she had said to any other group, the rest of us are coming at you lock, stock, and barrel.

Do not lecture us about free speech.

Let us return to her earlier spat on Q&A where the two guests ended up shouting both at and over each other in a live-action demonstration of what social media debates look like in print, until the host intervened.

Abdel-Magied: ‚ÄòThis kind of rhetoric is what we saw pre-world war two. We saw it in the thirties. The same kind of othering. They. They are different. They are not like us. They do stuff that we don‚Äôt accept. I back you 100 per cent. We should look after people that are vulnerable in this country. I will back you to the hilt on that, but that is not mutually exclusive to being generous to those that are coming here.‚Äô

The Host: ‚ÄòDo you accept that some of the things you say can come across as being quite hateful to others?‚Äô

Jacqui Lambi: ‚ÄòTo a minority. Well, that‚Äôs a minority but this is for the majority. This is what the majority want.‚Äô

Abdel Magied: ‚ÄòOh gurrrrrl!‚Äô

Jacqui Lambie: ‚ÄòThey want to feel safe, be safe, and Donald Trump, if he wants to put that ‚Ä¶ put those [migrant applications] on hold for three months he has every right to do so until he can work out exactly what is going on. If that‚Äôs going to keep America safer, just like it‚Äôs going to keep Australia safer. You‚Äôre playing the victim. Stop playing the victim. We‚Äôve had enough.‚Äô

How is this different to the average Australian wanting to air their honest and true grievances about mass migration online without a Misinformation and Disinformation law allowing the government to censor their views?

‚ÄòYou‚Äôre not doing anything! That‚Äôs the problem!‚Äô Lambie said in the Senate recently, criticising a lack of digital censorship. ‚ÄòFacebook, with other social media companies, including YouTube, all they do is fan division and hatred within our communities.‚Äô

That is not true. Politics fans division. Occasionally social media reflects the problems of our society, but it doesn‚Äôt create them.

‚ÄòIt‚Äôs just about money. They don‚Äôt give a stuff about who we are.‚Äô

Social media makes money. So does every other trade and service in this world. Find me one entity in our capitalist world more obsessed with public money than the government Treasury.

I‚Äôll wait.

 even in the storm,

The soul learns to dance in the rain.

They is beautiful in a dawn without haste,

In the aroma of coffee,

In the laughter that breaks the silence,

In a ""I love you"" that arrives without waiting for it.

Life is beautiful,

Not because it's perfect,

But because it keeps beating

Despite everything.

And every day,

Give us the opportunity

To start again.

I‚Äôm a 21-year-old guy living in Jaipur. I‚Äôm an introvert by nature ‚Äî not much into parties or loud places, but I do enjoy meaningful conversations, peaceful hangouts, and exploring new food spots or movies when I‚Äôm comfortable around someone.

I‚Äôm hoping to find a girl around my age who‚Äôs also looking for friendship, someone chill, understanding, and open-minded. We could start by chatting online, getting to know each other, and if we vibe, maybe hang out sometime ‚Äî coffee, a walk, or just talk about random things.

Not looking for anything too serious or dramatic, just a good connection with someone real.

If this sounds like something you‚Äôd be into, feel free to DM or comment :)

I am talking to a couple of installers to help with equipment, installation, and calibration. One of the concerns I have with installer A - he is suggesting all ceiling speakers (LCR are angled) which based on limited research is not a good idea.

Installer B suggests going with 3.1 and adding more speakers later.

My total budget including installation is about 14k and I would like 7.1 or 7.2. I would appreciate it if someone could provide me with better speakers, receiver, projector, and screen options that can fit my budget. Happy to buy a coffee or send a gift card for your valuable time and input.

My parents split when I was a kid. My dad remarried, and over time his wife and I grew distant, she was two-faced and exclusionary, and my dad often dismissed my feelings as ‚Äúoverthinking.‚Äù I moved in with them during college, tried to build a relationship, but felt like an outsider in his new family. 

After years of one-sided effort to stay connected as an adult, I tried to have an honest conversation to repair things, but he stonewalled me for months. 

Eventually, I cut ties after realizing the relationship was destroying my mental health. Now, I‚Äôm trying to break the cycle, but I still wrestle with guilt and confusion over whether I‚Äôm being ‚Äútoo soft‚Äù or if the situation really was as bad as it seemed.

Intro: 
Hey y‚Äôall, this is going to be a long post, and I really wasn‚Äôt sure what sub was best to post to, so I apologize in advance if I there‚Äôs a better spot to put this. I‚Äôm going to do my absolute best to condense where possible, but there are some parts that require a lot of explaining and backstory, so they will be long winded.

I‚Äôm writing this, partially as a therapeutic device, and partially to maybe gain some outside perspective from the community. My main question to you all being: ‚ÄúAm I overthinking, being soft, or is it truly as bad as it feels?‚Äù¬†Please feel free to offer up any thoughts you may have, good or bad.

I‚Äôll break my story into a few parts ‚Äî early childhood, moving in with my dad, college and adulthood, and how I‚Äôve tried to reconcile things as an adult. I‚Äôll do my best to give you an unbiased view of the overall story, though we all know that‚Äôs not always easy to pull off.

Early Childhood (4-12):
Parents split when I was 4-5. I moved to the west coast with my mom, dad stayed on the east coast. Dad was active duty, so he didn‚Äôt have much a choice. Because of this I only visited him for 2-3 weeks each summer. Occasionally he would come visit me, but it wasn‚Äôt often, my mom made it difficult for him, almost impossible at times. I want to note that when I was young I really looked up to my dad, he was like my super hero, I absolutely adored him. I would cry every time I left visiting him or he left visiting me.

A few years later, early 2000‚Äôs, he met another woman. We got along fine, but as I got older I started noticing behavior that just felt odd to me. For example, she would always pretend to do something near my room when my mom would call to check in. It happened every time I talked to my mom. Then one night I heard her telling my dad what I was talking to my mom about, or what she heard. My relationship with her degraded over time and eventually her and my dad had their own son and our relationship was virtually non existent.

This visitation arrangement continued up to high school. Around this time, because of my mom‚Äôs constant verbal degradation of my dad, I ended up buying into him just being a bad person, and I chose to not visit him anymore.

Early Adulthood (17-21):
After highschool I had a falling out with my mom. I fucked off in high school and didn‚Äôt really have a direction after. I got into some pretty serious trouble and decided it was best for me to leave the town I grew up in.

I ended up moving in with my dad. He helped me get into college and made me get a job. I worked nights and went to school in the day. This guidance is something that I‚Äôm still thankful for to this day, he kinda strong armed me into growing up and setting off in the right direction.

I was initially pretty resistant to the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù family life after having a pretty chaotic upbringing with my mom. I genuinely tried to adjust and fall into a rhythm in the new home but it wasn‚Äôt easy. I will be the first to admit that I made a lot of mistakes and made it a difficult adjustment for everyone. I really struggled with my stepmom. Her personality and how she acts just to this day doesn‚Äôt sit right with me. I felt like her and my dad never really intended for me to be part of the family. Here‚Äôs some examples of why I feel that way‚Ä¶

1)I felt like she‚Äôd always treat me one way when my dad was around and another way when he wasn‚Äôt around. It always seemed to be worse when my dad was around. She always had this weird slightly condescending or patronizing attitude, and she‚Äôd make back handed compliments or comments that were borderline rude. Then she‚Äôd make this ‚Äútsst‚Äù type scoff and smirk and look at my dad like she was looking for his praise or to egg him on to add something to her comment. It was fucking weird. When my dad wasn‚Äôt around I don‚Äôt remember it ever being an issue, just quiet. We didn‚Äôt really interact one on one too much.¬†

I brought this up to my dad many times, and the answer was pretty much always the same. He‚Äôd tell me that I was ‚Äúover thinking‚Äù things, and that I analyzed things too much. At the time, I thought he just didn‚Äôt see it. But as I get older, I think he knew and just didn‚Äôt want to disrupt the status quo of their relationship? I dunno. I look back on this and view it as mild gaslighting.

2)Throughout the few years I lived with them, I remember they‚Äôd always take trips to go places with my younger sibling and it would always be a secret. They wouldn‚Äôt say anything until the day of, unless I specifically asked them. I remember one time, I had found out they were going somewhere like a week or two in advance and I asked if I could go and my dad told me I had work. I did, but I only had one day which I said I could take off, but I was still told no. It just felt like they didn‚Äôt want me to be or go with them. Like I was a burden or embarrassment or something, a blemish on their perfect little family.¬†

3)I played a sport in college (nothing crazy) and I invited them to attend pretty much every one of my games to go hang out and watch but they never came. Meanwhile, my younger sibling did jujitsu and various other after school activities, and they always attended them, every week, without fail. My dad was actually really involved with my younger sibling and put a lot of time and energy into them. I definitely didn‚Äôt get the same amount of time or energy from my dad and maybe I was just soft and over emotional, but that really stood out to me and hurt me deeply.

4) A memory that sticks out to me‚Ä¶ I celebrated my 21st birthday, alone. I got home from work around 10pm and everyone was asleep already. So I sit in the living room and drank a beer by myself, a moment I had been waiting to share with my dad.

5)They made me see a psychologist. I attended every appointment and by the end of it the psychologist said he didn‚Äôt think there was anything wrong with me. I believe he wanted to have my dad and stepmom come and join a few times near the end or he wanted to talk to them 1v1, I cant remember exactly, but after bringing that up to my dad I stopped going shortly after. He said he didn‚Äôt want to pay for it if I wasn‚Äôt getting anything out of it. I actually just put two and two together now as I‚Äôm writing this. I wonder why they didn‚Äôt go?

All of these things made me feel emotionally distant from them, I felt like I was a burden or an outsider and it felt extremely unnatural living with them. Over time I slowly became more and more withdrawn from them.

One thing I need to throw in here before I move on is my relationship with my younger brother. Admittedly, I made some mistake in our relationship. I was in college while he was in middle school, something there was a big age gap. But I viewed him as the annoying little brother for most of the time I lived there. I played nerf with him and legos and stuff but I never really engaged with him on a deeper level. It wasn‚Äôt till my last year or so there that I really understood the importance of our relationship and I tried to set a good example and mentor him. But at this point, it was too late. My stepmom wouldn‚Äôt let us spend much time together and if we did, I‚Äôd always over hear her interrogating him on what I said to him and what we did. It just made me feel like I was just this inherently bad person and such a terrible influence on him. And you know what, if that was the case, I wish she wouldn‚Äôt have just told me that‚Äôs what she thought. I think that‚Äôs what bugs me the most, there was never any transparency or communication. Just mind games and gaslighting.

Moving out:
I eventually finished college. Didn‚Äôt get much of a response from my dad, was looking for at least an ‚Äúatta boy‚Äù. I remember being pretty upset about it, to the point where I said something and my stepmom said something to the effect of ‚Äúit‚Äôs just a (blank) degree.‚Äù
After college I moved away. It was bitter sweet. Although there was a lot of turbulence in the house, I did love my dad and I was sad to be leaving. From the time I was little until the day I left, I‚Äôd always seen him as a superhero. It really bummed me out that I left without ever really being able to reconnect or have a solid relationship with him. The last thing my dad said to me before I left is something that has stuck with me to this day. He told me he loved me because I was his son, but hated who I was as a person. I bawled my eyes out as I drove away. You know, I could understand that statement if I like ruined his life or burned his house down, or shit on his carpet while making eye contact with him or something. But, like I genuinely don‚Äôt understand what I did or where I went wrong. This is something I‚Äôve attempted to seek out answers for over the last decade and will be important later on in the story.

Post college years (21-29):
I moved half way across the country and pursued a job in the field I got my degree in. I stayed there about a year before choosing to move back home to the west coast.¬†

While I was home I met a girl, who I‚Äôm still with to this day. Shes not only my wife now, but my best friend. Shes helped me sort through all of this and is the one who actually gave me the idea to write this post. From the day I met her she has been my biggest supporter, but I think she thinks I‚Äôm too hard on myself and that getting input from other people would help me kinda move past this ‚Äúhole‚Äù in my heart that I‚Äôve been wrestling with for over a decade now.

I don‚Äôt know why, but I have this fire in me to push myself and be the absolute best at anything I do. I‚Äôd guess part of it comes from feeling like I need to prove myself and find self worth in my work. I don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs been a blessing and a curse. I do not mean to boast, I just think it‚Äôs important to note as I unravel the next 5-10 years of this story.
¬†
I got into wildland firefighting and made it to pretty much the pinnacle of that profession. It was some of the hardest work I had ever done at the time. I remember when I had first got hired. I was excited and text my dad to tell him. He made a comment about me being a masochist which never really made sense.¬†

One year, my wife reached out to my dad in July to try and arrange a surprise Christmas trip because at that point I hadn‚Äôt seen them in a couple years (I know someone is going to say something about it being way too early. I just want to point out that her reaching out that early was intentional.) My wife was trying to avoid the typical ‚ÄúSorry we‚Äôre busy should have asked sooner‚Äù text. She followed up every month to reinforce the idea. But My dad never got back to my wife despite her consistency. 

A week before thanksgiving my dad text me and asked if I wanted to go there for thanksgiving. My wife had a serious surgery scheduled around that time so I needed to be home to help her while she recovered, so I had to decline. I found out later that when family members asked about me during the holidays, my dad and stepmom told everyone that I was too busy to attend, and made it sound like I had better things to do.

I want to make a note that this is the ONLY time since I have moved away that he has invited me to visit for holidays. I have invited them every year to spend holidays together and every year I either got ignored or a ‚Äúyeah for sure‚Ä¶.. well, well see‚Äù text. There was always superficial interest at first, but no follow up. Over the years this got to me. Since moving out about ten years ago, I‚Äôve seen them three times, two of those times were for funerals, the other time was right after I got married, which is probably a big enough story to warrant its own post. I‚Äôll just say my stepmom made my post marriage trip all about her and found every little thing she could to cause an argument or make us feel uncomfortable.

Bringing up the funeral actually reminded me of an interaction that still to this day gets under my skin. At the funeral, someone attending who was elderly, confused me with my brother. They said of I heard you‚Äôre attending (school name). My stepmom over heard and quickly interjected, ‚ÄúNo this is (my name), not (my brother‚Äôs name), he‚Äôs *just* a (enter my current profession), and she finished off with a scoff and a dismissive hand motion/wave. Her emphasis on ‚ÄúJUST‚Äù felt so belittling and dismissive at the time. 

Admittedly, my brother attended one of the most prestigious universities in the world and I really am proud of him. It just gets so draining having to hear my stepmom make sure she tells everyone every chance she gets that he‚Äôs doing ‚Äúxyz‚Äù, and any time anyone makes note of any of my accomplishments it‚Äôs almost like she gets defensive and/or threatened or something. It‚Äôs so odd. Like let me have the limelight for a second man, I‚Äôve worked my butt off! Ha.

Fatherhood and reflection (30):
It was around this time I started to reflect, deeply, on my relationship with my parents, and just who I was as a person. This was driven by the realization that I too was going to be a father soon. I wanted to be the best darn father the world had ever seen. But I had a lot of monsters under the bed that I had lived with. I didn‚Äôt want them in the same house with my own son. I felt like it was my duty to get myself squared away so my son didn‚Äôt end up sleeping with the same monsters under his bed.¬†

So this started with me rekindling my relationship with my mother and rebuilding that from the ground up. One of the best decisions I had ever made.¬†It was a pretty straight forward series of convos. We‚Äôd talk for 3-4 hours at a time, own our mistakes, apologize, and laugh at how far we had come in life. These conversations were so constructive and beneficial, I‚Äôm so thankful that my mom was willing to not only sit down and talk, but also have the courage to self reflect and own mistakes she had made. Our initial talks happened over the course of a few months, but are still ongoing to this day. (Love you mom!)

The next step was to get my relationship straight with my dad. (I went into this thinking it would be similar to my talks with my mom.) 

I brought this up on the net with him and he was a bit hesitant at first, but eventually agreed to talk about things. Our first phone convo lasted a total of 23m 32s.

During the first call, I openly owned any mistakes I had made while I was living with him, took complete responsibility, and gave a heart felt, genuine apology. After that I brought up some core issues.

1. The way my stepmom treated me.

2. The way he and her treated my wife. My wife would always make and send them both really cool gifts for birthdays and holidays. Both of them are super anal about making sure they get their cards or gifts on time. I was always bad about it, but my wife did a really good job about making sure they got gifts. They never once acknowledged ANY gifts or cards or anything that she sent them. This one pisses me off the most because every time I brought it up my dad would freaking skirt around the subject and REFUSED to acknowledge that they received ANYTHING from my wife. 

3. The post marriage trip, and all the pointless arguing.

4. Them never making an effort to see me or my wife, despite us trying really hard to make it happen. We invited them to come spend holidays with us every year. I also invited my dad to go hunting with me every year. They never once came to see us. BUT, they made multiple trips a year to go see my brother (at college across the country) and his new girlfriend. They always post about it on FB or IG. They treat my brother‚Äôs gf like their own daughter. So it really confused me and my wife as to why they didn‚Äôt treat us the same, despite all our effort.

5. I made it a point to tell my dad I felt like he was gaslighting me with saying he‚Äôd come visit or at least pretending to be partially interested, ¬†or with how ¬†my stepmom treated me.

My dad didn‚Äôt have much to say, his exact words were ‚Äúsorry we don‚Äôt see it that way‚Äù. But he did get really hung up on me saying he gaslights me. He said ‚Äúgaslighting is abuse. Do you really think I abuse you??‚Äù I said ‚Äúno‚Äù, and he said ‚ÄúWell then im not gaslighting you, if you think I do why wont you just call it what it is and say I abuse you??‚Äù

He said he needed time to think about everything and said he‚Äôd call me the next weekend. I made it a point to tell him I wasn‚Äôt going to call him. He needed to call me. I wanted to see effort on his end I guess‚Ä¶
I waited for his call‚Ä¶. For six months‚Ä¶

I eventually reached out to him again and politely said I need to finish this convo, or we needed to go ahead and go our separate ways because it was starting to do a lot of damage to my mental health. He agreed, but I didn‚Äôt hear from him again. I called him countless times and no answer, I text and no answer, fuck I probably tried smoke signals too, that‚Äôs how bad I wanted to fix things.

5-6 months passed again and one night I was sitting on my couch staring at the boom stick on my coffee table. I was thinking about how better off everyone would be if I did it. Somewhere in that hour - hour and a half, I came to a realization. I got really mad that I was even in that situation. It was a hypocritical situation. I was sitting there wanting to be a better man to be a better father, and I was thinking about removing myself completely. What the f‚Äî- was wrong with me? I‚Äôm so ashamed of that night.

Eventually I decided to go ahead and end the relationship, so a went ahead and drafted up a really lengthy text. In hindsight, it wasn‚Äôt my best moment, it was very emotionally driven, and I could have gone about it in a mor responsible manner, but I was at the end of the rope.

I explained that I‚Äôve put my heart and soul into trying to love both of them and all I got in return was lazy half-assed attempts at reciprocation. I explained how embarrassed I was to have been led on for over a year, how I was tired of feeling worthless and not worthy of their love, and I told him that I‚Äôm doing what he always told me to do and be a man of my word. I told him we would have to go our separate ways if we were unable to discuss our grievances and mend what was there between us. I told him I owned and apologized for any of my personal wrong doings, and all I wanted was for him to own his as well so we could apologize and do better for each other, but that was apparently too much to ask for. Then I ended it with his own quote ‚Äú I love you, but I hate who you are as a person.‚Äù
I sent a quick follow up message saying, ‚ÄúYou know where my house is if you have anything you‚Äôd like to say in response or want to eventually see your grandkids.‚Äù

Then I blocked him, and I Haven‚Äôt heard from him since.

If you made it this far, thank you for your time and energy. I truly am sorry for such a long post, but I needed to get this off my chest, and I‚Äôd really like to hear what your thoughts are. Do you think my feelings are justified? Do you think I‚Äôm just reading into things too much?

1o64r5u,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o64r5u,"Sixpenny, Sydney August 2025","Continuing with my Sydney trip, Sixpenny was an unforgettable meal easily top 2 meal from the trip. Situated in a quiet inner west area of Sydney, the restaurant is ran by Chefs Daniel and Tony. They feature a contemporary Australian cuisine tasting menu incorporating local produce at its core. Koji fermentation manages to find its way into pretty much all the dishes and the non alcoholic beverages they serve.

I couldn‚Äôt see solo diner options when trying to reserve online but managed to book a spot after emailing them. Arriving soon after they opened for lunch, I entered a cozy and inviting dining room. The restaurant filled up slowly and after about an hour it was full and abuzz with chatter. The staff were all very welcoming and accomodating, there were a few tables with dietary restrictions and the dishes prepared for each guest were usually completely different rather than having substitutions. The chefs would often serve the dishes as well giving us a chance to interact with them more. 

Dishes served in the tasting menu:
Snacks 

1. Baby cucumber with sunflower seed miso lime butter and chardonnay herb - quick simple and fresh bite to start the meal. 

2. Aged Blue mackerel tart with oyster emulsion. Mackerel dressed in cucumber and seasoned with  horseradish and fermented chicken skin paste

3. Smoked silver lake eel on fermented rice pancake with pickled golden beetrot. The eel is combined with confit potatoes and onion miso cream - my surprise favourite snack, the many components come together to form a perfect bite. 

4. Kangaroo taco with sweet potato miso and a little hot sauce - a complimentary snack from the kitchen, first time having kangaroo. Was very similar to beef with a bit of gamey flavour. 

5. Sydney rock oyster 

6. Cured silver trevally with avocado and fermented nashi pear. The loin is sliced finely and made into round discs and served on of a mixture of avacado, pumpkin seed paste, pear and mandarin oil - a lot going on the plate which i enjoyed greatly. Citrus notes of varying intensity in each bite and its great to mix up the portions of the fish and the base mixture. 

Paired with a fermented carrot and liqourice juice.  

7. A malt barley sourdogh, served with sourcream and sour paste - the sourdough uses recycled material from the day before.

8. Roasted quail liver with yuzu shoyu sweetcorn foam and burnt apple miso. Pickled radish and chopped taragon on too - Quail nicely cooked, the miso sauce is the star for me. I couldn‚Äôt get enough of the umami rice flavour with hints of sweet earthy notes. 

Paired with apple and sorrel juice. Wasn‚Äôt a fan due to it also including a bit of fennel which I thought overpowered the other flavours.

9. Western australia marron with coral trout butter, served with muntries compressed in passionfruit, whey fermented carrots, pickled choko and spiced carrot puree - the marron is cooked in its shell before finished on the grill and it was perfectly cooked. The different accompaniments were all well thought out in its uses and it was hard to choose which one was best. My favourite dish overall

Paired with celery juice mixed with lemongrass and smoked coconut. 

10. Milk bun glazed with porcini shoyu seasoned maple butter - couldn‚Äôt get enough of the butter! 

11. Rangers valley wagyu beef rib cap with Jerusalem artichoke mushroom miso puree and wasbina leaves. The wagyu is slow cooked 30 hours before finished on the grill, and it just melted in my mouth. The beef trimmings is used to make the jus. The fermented puree was heavenly. 

Paired with beetroot and blueberry kombucha

12. Mead vinegar custard with frozen raspberry and strawberry consomm√© - i love berries so this dessert was made for me, vinegar in the custard was subtle and well balanced with the mead.

Paired with virgin vermouth

13. Salted banana ice cream with coffee and hazelnut. Coconut and blacked banana jam is mixed in with coffee and finished with banana amazake coffee oil - a nice balance to the first dessert with its more bitter and sharp flavour. The coffee oil was a nice finishing touch for me. 

Paired with barley koji kavass

14. Spiced pumpkin madeline with cream and honey

The use of koji fermentation is used efficiently and widely throughout the meal. Each bite was complex but delicious, Sixpenny delivered a unique dining experience which I‚Äôd love to visit again soon.

I'm on a mission to make truly authentic Arabic Qahwah (the light-roast, often cardamom-spiced coffee, not the dark Turkish style) at home. I've seen a few recipes online, but they often vary significantly, and I want to get it right.

Could anyone who makes a traditional, authentic Qahwah recipe from the Arabian Peninsula (Saudi, Emirati, Jordanian, etc.) share their ingredients and process?

Specifically, I'd love to know:

1. **Recipe and Ingredients:**¬†What is your go-to, authentic recipe? What are the¬†*essential*¬†ingredients (coffee, cardamom, saffron, cloves, rose water, etc.) and in what ratios?
2. **Coffee Beans/Roast:**¬†This is the trickiest part for me. What kind of unroasted or very lightly roasted green coffee beans are best for Qahwah? What is the ideal roast level (light/yellowish)?
3. **Where to Buy the Beans:**¬†Where do you purchase your high-quality Qahwah-specific beans (online store recommendations, or types of local stores to look for)?

Any tips or personal anecdotes on the process would be greatly appreciated! Shukran!",2,1760412044.0,saudiarabia,0,1.0,False

We are a family of 3 planning a trip to San Diego. First timers, 2 adults & 1 infant (1 year old). We are heading out December to be over there the week of Christmas & I am looking for advice, tips, & recommendations. 

Where should we eat? Good delicious places. Family friendly. Not too expensive but average obviously. 

City Cruise tour? Seal tour? Zoo? Safari? Whale watching tour? Sea World? Japanese Botanic Garden? Coronado Island? 

  
Hotel or AirBnb? Cost wise they are around the same price. The only pro to a hotel is that we don‚Äôt have to worry about additional fees like Airbnb service fee, cleaning fee, getting put in a small back home, 

the pro to an airbnb is not having to pay for parking. But other than that I do not see much of a pro over a hotel, especially because the hotel i am looking at has a small kitchen which realistically we won‚Äôt be cooking much and if we did it would be simple meals that we can take on the go with us, Which could be cooked in the small kitchen in the Hotel.

1o64o8p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1o64o8p/found_out_my_best_friend_his_brother_and_his_aunt/,"Found out my best friend, his brother, and his aunt robbed our apartment of nearly 70k in 1999","Sorry as this will get long. I've never been good at being concise and frankly I don't know how else to tell this story...

Back in 1999 I was in middle school. I didn't have the best childhood and didn't make any real friends until middle school. In fact, I was constantly bullied in my last two years of elementary school. I got very lucky and was able to make friends quickly. There was one kid who I just clicked with. Let's call him John.

John had a very strict mom and step-mom and a pretty messed up childhood himself that I learned about years after. His brother was older and can best be described as a low life and I later learned that his aunt was essentially a scam artist. Maybe five years ago I found out his brother would abuse a dog he adopted and beat his girlfriend. And the best way to describe John... We saw The Talented Mr. Ripley in high school at my place and went to grab coffee after. In this pensive way he looked at me and said that Tom was right and it was better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody. Let's just say that the story checks out and he took that to heart even to this day. So yeah, there's that.

Now John and I became the silly class clowns, but also squares at the same time. We never skipped classes. It was only in high school where we skipped classes a handful of times. His parents would never give him any money either. Even in high school. Whenever we went out I'd have to cover for him.

We'd always get to school about 30 minutes earlier to shoot the shit and talk and one Friday he pulls me aside and tells me how he found $50 on his way to school and wants us to skip class at lunch and go to the mall. He lived right across from the school. He'd just have to cross the road, go through a park, and he was there. I found it odd... At the time if you missed any class you'd get an automated call home and I didn't want to risk that. I finally caved. I ALWAYS went home for lunch though as I'd tape Sportscenter or some sports game/match and would often prefer my mom's cooking and watching that over the school cafeteria or going to our local plaza. Plus, students almost always got in trouble during the lunch hour and my mom preferred me being home.

I told him I'd have to go home first and eat what my mom made in case she came home early from work so she wouldn't know I never came home for lunch. He kept pushing and finally caved.

Lunch time rolls around and we walk home. In retrospect there were so many red flags that I simply ignored like an idiot from the start of the day. So many that even at that age I knew were odd, but I was incredibly naive.

We go to my place, I unlock the door, and I can't comprehend what I'm seeing. Mattress flipped over, TV thrown on the floor, everything is an absolute mess. I walk in not saying anything and John finally says, ""I think you were robbed."" I don't say anything and immediately call my mom and then the cops.

While on the phone with my mom he just says, ""\[my name\] I'm just going to leave..."" Again, I'm in absolute shock.

Now my mom had made an absolutely stupid decision. She had jewelry worth around 70k that she always kept in the safety deposit box. She had finally decided to sell it to use as a downpayment on a place as work as going well and ever since her divorce with my dad she'd been trying to get us out of this apartment. She had gone to sell them to someone that Wednesday and at the time he could only give her a personal cheque. My mom asked for a certified cheque or wire transfer and he told her he'd need a few days for that. My mom, for some reason, didn't take it back to the safety deposit box and kept it at home. And, another grave error with my mom, is she can't keep her mouth shut and will tell you her entire life story within minutes of meeting you. So many people knew this.

Fast forward to two years ago. I finally cut ties with John a few years after high school. I'm no expert, but I'm sure he's the closest person I've met who was a psychopath. I simply didn't want to put up with his shit anymore.

Well two years ago I had a stroke, was diagnosed with cancer, and was going through it. One day I found these old mini DV tapes that I never got developed. I knew they were from high school and figured I'd spend the $400 and maybe watching them would take me back and bring a smile to my face as I couldn't see much happiness in the now.

Watching John and I just bullshitting and acting dumb did bring a smile to my face and not knowing if I'd even be here in a year or two I decided to reach out and mend things. After all, we're not perfect and people do change...

We reconnect and meet for drinks. Then I invite him and his wife out to dinner one night. As a joke we take a stupid picture together in the bathroom and he posts it on his Instagram. That night I also decided I was right as he had simply not changed. The biggest issue is he felt like he could say anything to you, yet he was so insecure and sensitive that even the smallest joke or criticism about anything would set him off. And he was taking jabs at me the entire night. I chalked it up as a loss. At least the steak and wine was good!

Four days later I get a message on LinkedIn which is the only social I have. It's from his ex-wife. She apologies and says she knows this is weird and wants to know if she can call me. Says it's important. I give her my number and she calls me an hour later.

She told me how she saw the picture and tells me how one night her and John and a few friends from our high school were drinking and smoking and John told them how his brother and uncle had found out about my mom's jewelry and decided to rob the place. She knew exactly what they took and I had this TV in my room next to my desk where I'd watch home videos or random movies on VHS while doing my homework. She knew exactly what movie was in that VHS down to the exact scene. Apparently they had talked shit about me watching Encino Man the night John confessed, which was what I had watched a few days before the robbery.

Besides feeling like an idiot for not having noticed all those red flags the day of the robbery I was in absolute shock...

John is now a professor at a pretty prestigious school. Glowing reviews from students. He was always incredibly charming, funny, and frankly he'd break things down to me even in middle school when I was struggling and he was just an absolute natural at teaching.

I've felt compelled to reach out to him and tell him. I don't know what I'd say. The day I found out I did text his brother who works in construction after finding his number on his site. I first sent a text to make sure it was him and then asked if he was still breaking into houses with his aunt while using his little brother as well. I used a burner number and wish I'd kept the voice messages he left me. Him and his brother don't speak anymore and I don't think he'd even reach out to him to let him know I know.

For some reason I can't get this out of my head and every now and then I think if I should somehow reach out to John to let him know...

To all who actually read this entire rant, thank you. For some reason writing out it feels cathartic.",3,1760411986.0,Vent,2,1.0,False

1o64nz7,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1o64nz7/why_cant_i_let_go_of_bad_social_encounters/,Why can't I let go of bad social encounters?,"I finally managed to sign up for betterhelp after a month of trying to get my severely burned out and completely unsupported partner to do it...because even with the font size and zoom maxed out on my phone I can't see or use my hands/a stylus well enough to navigate new apps let alone fill out forms, and I also have random hand spasms that make me drop things and misclick/mis-swipe.   Took 30 minutes instead of five like these kinds of apps used to take before I lost my sight and fine motor skills, but I did it.  

First session was a few hours ago and I don't know how to accurately describe exactly how bad it was, but I'll try.

We didn't even get five minutes in before she rolled her eyes, cackled like a witch, and snarled ""oh you're DEFINITELY above my paygrade, you little -"" followed by a bunch of unintelligible mumbling then ""good luck, I'll send you the link to switch therapists"", but all of that was said with a twisted smirk and a really pissed off tone. 

Like this was definitely not a ""I just need coffee"" or even ""my previous patient unalived and I really shouldn't be at work right now"" kind of hostility (Ive encountered both situations from two different previous therapists). it wasn't simply ""not a good fit.""  

All I said was ""uh, if I'm...uh, above your paygrade? Totally understand, no big deal just let me know so I can switch and you can free up your schedule for another patient"" after she had become visibly frustrated and disrespectful when I couldn't answer some of the really triggering questions verbally. 

In hindsight I realize ""above your paygrade"" was offensive, but I have aphasia on top of diagnosed level 2 autism and had *already* told her that I might use the wrong words and the trauma from the medical stuff causing the aphasia was a huge part of why I'm in therapy. 

Even though logically I know I handled myself well, I didn't fawn, I didn't fight, and I didn't freeze, I just thanked her and stayed professional...I'm still shaking and scared. I can't figure out why I'm still trying to recover from five minutes of dealing with a  ""trauma informed"" bundle of nightmare fuel wrapped in human skin, who I never have to see again. Like what is there to recover from?! Shes just a sad mean hurt person, she didn't know me well enough to have any legit reason to ""make it personal"", she poses zero danger to me - but I keep hearing the venom in her words and seeing her face twist into that ugly mask. She didn't look or sound human, and I'm just grateful this was via telehealth and the better health platform allowed me to easily cancel and switch to somebody else. 

I want to let this bad interaction go but I can't figure out how. I think this is because this kind of unexpected, ""wtf is going on with this person?!"" encounter is unfortunately pretty normal for me, and has been normal the entire 3 and a half decades I have been in this Earth. every time I manage to trust again, I get blindsided and have to recover. This therapist is yet another name on the list my brain keeps of the hundreds of hurt people who have hurt me and/or my loved ones.

I got back on the horse somewhat by scheduling a text only session with another therapist this Thursday. but now I'm really scared I'm going to miss red flags and/or completely misunderstand something important from the lack of visual and emotional context. 


I want therapy to help me find answers to the following questions:


Why is it easier for me to move on from surviving physical abuse, hate crimes, and even SA? Why won't my brain let go of cruel words, mocking cackles, and twisted faces? Why have I encountered hundreds of broken, hurt people who take my existence in their vicinity personally and make their problems my problems? Why have I only met a literal handful of healthy, mature, collaborative people? I live such a low-risk/""normie"" life and have polite manners to the point people who only know my partner before meeting me think I'm Mormon or a FBI agent - so what am I doing or not doing to have such a skewed ratio of ""wtf is this person's problem and why are they trying to make it mine?"" social encounters? 

This last therapist is also the first bad therapist I've encountered to give me the courtesy of an authentic reaction during the first session. but she was physically reddening and clenching her face and neck until I gave her an out...so was it really authentic?

I‚Äôm eating more vegetables. I‚Äôm on Ozempic so I‚Äôm not very hungry. I think I‚Äôm afraid to eat because the flare up was so painful. I‚Äôm feeling a little traumatized. 

I really enjoy lentils, beans, cheese and dried fruits in general. I‚Äôm not into dairy but I do like nut milks. I like all kinds of pickled vegetables. I also like olive and chickpeas and green peas. I stopped drinking alcohol a year ago. I‚Äôd like go vegan but I‚Äôm afraid it will cause a flare up with all the plant based foods.

I‚Äôve already had my resume looked over by my advisor and made a few revisions, but I still feel like something might be missing. I have already posted this in r/EngineeringResumes and got little advice besides to apply a bunch more. I‚Äôve also been doing coffee chats and reaching out for referrals, but it hasn‚Äôt really led to interviews yet.

I just wanted to ask if its my resume thats holding me back. I really appreciate any feedback or critique or anything that could help me stand out more for system roles. I am just overall really stressed about it.

Are dating apps making you‚Ä¶¬†*unhinged*? üî•üî•üî•

Have you reached a point where no amount of¬†*coffee or bagels*¬†can make your heart race as you swipe through hundreds of incompatible profiles? Are you too busy to go out on a random¬†*Thursday*¬†night, and now convinced there are, in fact,¬†*not plenty of fish*¬†in the sea?

And last but not least...are you feeling like a lost soul¬†*bumbling*¬†through a wasteland called ‚Äúmodern dating""?

Fret not, my friend. FOCUS is here.

FOCUS is an¬†**invite-only, in-person dating event**¬†curated for people who are serious about connection but done bowing to the Dating App Overlords. We believe true compatibility starts with values and personality, not a 0.5-second glance at a bathroom selfie. That‚Äôs why our questionnaire is designed to cut through the noise and ask the questions that actually matter.

Other events brag about ‚Äúsmart matching‚Äù and personality algorithms. At FOCUS, we hand-pair people the old-fashioned way--like a team of underpaid, over-caffeinated luddites--because we believe AI won‚Äôt get you laid. Just laid off.

We work hard to take out the guesswork so you can focus on feeling the chemistry. As üëè you üëè should. üëè

This event caters to individuals ages¬†**21‚Äì35**¬†who are actively seeking¬†**serious, committed, long-term relationships**¬†in a¬†**monogamous, hetero**¬†context. (Other dating styles will be featured in future curated events.) Attendees will be matched within three age ranges:¬†**21‚Äì26, 27‚Äì31, and 32‚Äì35.**

‚ÄãWe recognize that compatibility depends on many factors beyond age, so we may occasionally facilitate connections slightly outside your selected range (for example, when your age falls near a range boundary or when we identify a strong potential match)

‚ÄãWe‚Äôre committed to creating a respectful, safe space for meaningful connection. If you‚Äôre interested in a future curated event for other age groups, gender identities, communities, or relationship types, let us know here:¬†[https://forms.gle/mmY4iiVZSTNghr7a6](https://forms.gle/mmY4iiVZSTNghr7a6)",0,1760410832.0,Sunnyvale,1,0.5,False

But the reality was often different. The aftermath of a week lived well, especially after having friends over for fika, usually meant my Sunday mornings were dedicated to battling floor dust and the sticky spots that seem to appear from nowhere. It was a chore that left me more tired than relaxed.

A few months ago, I decided to make a change, not for a cleaner home, but for a calmer me. I brought in a little help to handle the floors,a robot vacuum that genuinely understands cleaning. What finally won me over were two small details I didn't know I needed. 

First, it always uses fresh water to mop, so it actually cleans spills instead of just spreading them. And second, it comes with a handy detachable handheld vacuum,perfect for a quick once-over on the rug after our cinnamon bun sessions, before the crumbs even have a chance to settle.

That small decision has quietly transformed my weekends. Now, I simply start it while I'm having my morning coffee. The gentle hum in the background has become a sound of liberation. The real magic happens when I come home later to find the floors effortlessly clean, with no fuss or leftover dampness.

This has given me back the gift of time and peace. My Sunday now truly feels like my own. The apartment feels more peaceful because I feel more peaceful. It's the ultimate hygge upgrade: less chore, more calm.

Honestly. Take a step out of your health anxiety. I find it incredibly difficult to believe what I‚Äôm experiencing is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù.

# The Boy in the Vent ‚Äì Part 1

The first time I heard Eli whisper into the vent, I thought he was pretending to be on a walkie-talkie.

‚ÄúCopy that, over,‚Äù I said from my room, teasing him through the thin drywall.  
He didn‚Äôt laugh. He whispered something back that I couldn‚Äôt catch‚Äîsoft, drawn-out syllables that made the metal hum.

Our house was built in the 1940s, small and sagging on its foundations. The vents were big square mouths cut into the floorboards, their grates painted over a dozen times. You could drop a marble down there and hear it roll for what felt like forever.

Eli was six‚Äîsmart, but lonely. Mom worked nights at the hospital. I was seventeen, stuck babysitting and pretending not to be scared of every creak in that place.

He started talking to ‚Äúthe boy‚Äù about two weeks after we moved in.  
At first, it was cute.  
Then he started closing his door when he talked to him.

The first real weird thing happened on a Tuesday.  
I was brushing my teeth when I heard Eli giggling through the bathroom vent.  
Not his normal laugh. It was quieter, like he was trying not to wake someone up.

‚ÄúWho‚Äôre you talking to?‚Äù I asked.  
He stopped laughing.  
A second later, a voice that wasn‚Äôt his whispered back,¬†**‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tell.‚Äù**

I froze. The toothbrush dropped into the sink.

When I burst into his room, Eli was sitting cross-legged by the vent, tracing shapes in the dust.  
‚ÄúWas that you?‚Äù I asked.

He looked up at me, wide-eyed.  
‚ÄúHe says he likes you.‚Äù

I told Mom that night. She was half asleep on the couch, still in her scrubs.  
‚ÄúKids make things up,‚Äù she muttered. ‚ÄúYou used to talk to the walls, too.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt remember that, but she sounded so sure that I let it go.

For a while.

By the end of the week, Eli‚Äôs drawings started showing up on the fridge‚Äîscribbles of a pale boy with no mouth. Always standing behind something: blinds, curtains, the vent.

He gave one of them to me. ‚ÄúHe said you should keep this,‚Äù Eli said.

The paper felt warm, like it had been near a heater.  
When I touched the drawn boy‚Äôs face, the crayon line smudged under my finger‚Ä¶ and left a faint streak of¬†*moisture*.

That night, I woke up to tapping.  
Slow, rhythmic, from the vent near my bed.  
Three taps. Pause. Two taps.  
Then breathing.

‚ÄúEli?‚Äù I whispered.

No answer.

The breathing grew heavier, right up against the metal slats, until I could feel the air pulsing across my skin.

I turned on my lamp‚Äînothing. But when I crouched and looked inside the vent, there were¬†**fingerprints**¬†in the dust.  
Small, but not child-sized.  
Longer. Thinner. Like someone who hadn‚Äôt eaten in a while.

**The Boy in the Vent ‚Äì Part 2**

I didn‚Äôt sleep after that.  
Every time I shut my eyes I heard that soft scraping, like fingertips brushing metal.  
By morning the sound was gone, and I almost convinced myself I‚Äôd imagined it.

When Eli padded into the kitchen for cereal, I tried to sound casual.  
‚ÄúYou sleep okay last night?‚Äù

He nodded without looking at me.  
‚ÄúHe told me you were scared.‚Äù  
I stopped pouring milk. ‚ÄúWho?‚Äù  
Eli lifted his head. His eyes looked darker somehow. ‚ÄúThe boy. He said you shouldn‚Äôt look at him yet.‚Äù

That made my stomach knot. ‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù  
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not finished,‚Äù Eli said, and went back to eating.

Mom left for another double shift that evening. The house felt hollow once her car pulled away. I decided I‚Äôd prove to myself there was nothing in the vents‚Äîtake off a cover, shine a flashlight, maybe show Eli so he‚Äôd drop the game.

I unscrewed the grate in the hallway. Dust drifted out in little gray clouds. The duct stretched straight for a few feet, then split off into blackness. I reached in with my phone‚Äôs flashlight.

Something glittered. A small silver chain lay in the dust, the kind with a tiny tag that says ‚Äúproperty of.‚Äù I pulled it out‚Äîit was an old hospital bracelet. The tag was rubbed almost smooth, but I could make out one thing:  
**E. Carter**

Our last name.

I didn‚Äôt have time to process it because the air from the vent changed. Cold, damp, smelling like soil. Then the whisper came again, closer than before:  
*‚ÄúYou dropped me.‚Äù*

I slammed the grate back on and ran.

That night I pushed Eli‚Äôs bed away from his vent and told him he was sleeping in my room. He didn‚Äôt argue, just curled under my blanket. I must‚Äôve drifted off around three.

When I woke, he wasn‚Äôt there.

I found him kneeling by the vent again, his face an inch from the slats. He was whispering so quietly I couldn‚Äôt catch the words.  
‚ÄúEli!‚Äù I hissed.  
He turned his head slowly, eyes glassy. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs lonely. He said you used to be here too.‚Äù

Something about the way he said¬†*used to*¬†hit me hard. I grabbed him, carried him back to bed, locked the door, and sat awake until sunrise.

By the weekend the house started to change.  
The hallway paint bubbled like something underneath was pushing out.  
Every vent exhaled that same wet, earthy smell.  
And sometimes, when the wind wasn‚Äôt blowing, I could hear faint sobbing inside the ducts‚Äîlike the sound traveled from room to room.

Mom noticed the smell and blamed plumbing. I tried to tell her, but she snapped that she was too tired for ghost stories.

That night she called from work to check in. I told her everything‚ÄîEli‚Äôs drawings, the bracelet, the voices. She went silent on the phone for a long time before whispering, ‚ÄúEli had a twin, Anthony. He didn‚Äôt survive the birth.‚Äù

I felt the blood drain from my face.  
‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you ever tell me?‚Äù  
‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want him growing up haunted by it.‚Äù

The line crackled. Then I heard it, faint but clear through the receiver:  
*breathing.*  
Slow. Wet.  
Coming from her end.

I hung up.  
The vents started rattling in every room at once, metal clanging like something crawling fast inside the walls. Eli screamed. I grabbed him and bolted out the front door into the cold night air.

From the yard I could see light flickering through the vents‚Äîlike a lantern being carried through the ducts. It moved from room to room, finally stopping at my bedroom.

Then, silence.

**The Boy in the Vent ‚Äì Part 3**

We spent the rest of the night in Mom‚Äôs car with the heater running.  
Eli wouldn‚Äôt talk; he just stared at the house. Around 4 a.m. he finally said,  
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs mad at you for taking me away.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt answer. The windows had fogged over, but I could still see our porch light blinking, on and off, like someone flicking a switch from inside.

When morning came, I walked Eli to the neighbor‚Äôs. Mrs. Barton was half-awake and confused, but she agreed to watch him. ‚ÄúYou look like you‚Äôve seen a ghost,‚Äù she said.  
‚ÄúMaybe I have,‚Äù I muttered.

# The return

I went back home after sunrise.  
Everything was silent. The air felt thick, like the house was holding its breath.  
I opened every door, every closet‚Äînothing. Then I crouched by the hallway vent.  
No smell. No noise. Just cold air.

Part of me wanted to believe it was over.  
But I knew better.

The bracelet lay on the floor where I‚Äôd dropped it, except now the tag was clean enough to read the full name:  
**Eli Carter.**

I stared until my eyes blurred.  
There was a sound behind me‚Äîsoft footsteps.  
‚ÄúEli?‚Äù I said automatically.  
Then I remembered he was next door.

The footsteps stopped right behind the vent.

# The message

That night, I dreamed I was crawling through the ductwork.  
The metal scraped my elbows raw, but I kept going because a small hand was leading me forward.  
When I woke, my sheets were streaked with gray dust.

There was writing on the wall beside my bed‚Äîtiny finger marks drawn in the dust:  
**LET HIM OUT.**

I scrubbed it away before Mom saw. She came home the next morning, pale and quiet. ‚ÄúAnthony,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúthey found a space under the house while fixing the plumbing. A little crawl-room sealed behind the old furnace. There were toys in there‚Ä¶ and a crib.‚Äù  
Her voice broke.  
‚ÄúI think your father built it.‚Äù

# The descent

By nightfall I couldn‚Äôt stand it anymore. I grabbed a flashlight, a screwdriver, and knelt by the main vent.  
The screws came loose easy.  
Cold air rushed out, carrying that smell of soil and rust.

I slid inside.

At first it was just dust and darkness. Then I saw scratches on the metal, hundreds of them, like someone had tried to crawl out.  
A few feet ahead, the duct opened into a small chamber made of wood and dirt. In the middle sat a child‚Äôs toy car, half-buried. Next to it, a photograph‚Äîmy mom holding two infants. One of them had been scribbled out with black marker.

The air stirred.  
Behind me, something whispered:  
*‚ÄúHe was never supposed to leave.‚Äù*

I turned the light. A pale shape crouched at the edge of the vent, its skin paper-thin, eyes huge and dark. It looked almost like Eli‚Äîbut smaller, frailer, as if he‚Äôd been frozen at the moment he was lost.

He reached out a hand.  
‚ÄúStay,‚Äù he said.  
The flashlight flickered, and for a heartbeat I saw dozens of faces pressed into the duct walls‚Äîchildren, silent, watching.

# The twist

I woke up on the living-room floor at sunrise.  
The vent was sealed again, screws tight, no dust on the carpet.  
Mom was in the kitchen making coffee like nothing happened.  
‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Eli?‚Äù I asked.

She smiled, tired. ‚ÄúIn his room. He finally slept through the night.‚Äù

I ran down the hall and opened his door.

Empty bed.  
Vent wide open.  
The drawing pinned above it was new‚Äîtwo boys holding hands in the dark, both smiling.

From inside the vent, a soft voice whispered, perfectly calm:  
*‚ÄúHe‚Äôs finished now.‚Äù*

Buckle up cause this is a long crazy story! I‚Äôm just now starting to use Reddit after listening to the podcast (Hi Morgan and co host if you‚Äôre reading) 

anyways let‚Äôs get to the story! I was living at my apartment complex with my then roommate and ran into this girl at the mail who happened to be my neighbor, we had great convo and being the weird awkward person I am didn‚Äôt ask for contact info even tho we stated we should be friends, a few days go by and I leave a note on the door saying ‚ÄúHi I‚Äôm Morgan the neighbor you talked to a few days ago here‚Äôs my info if you want it‚Äù she responds with her name and says thank you for the info. 

We quickly become friends and by the end of our lease term ( ended around the same time) we both found ourselves out of a roommate and had the idea to move in together. We do and things go great and she was one of the better roommates I had and I was really nervous cause friends as roommates are never a good idea, we hung out in the living room watching movies, Saturday we would get coffee and run errands it was great. 

now skip ahead 6 months and I get a girlfriend and Lexi (that was my besties name) said congrats but just be careful. The relationship between my gf and I grew quickly but I always made time for Lexi such as still watching movies on week days and leaving Saturday morning for our girls days, but she became more needy saying I‚Äôm not showing up for her as I use to and other things like that I apologized and said I‚Äôll do better I would stay the night Saturday night at my gf and she would call with an emergency for me to come home. 

Now the drama we are towards the end of the lease and my gf and I want to move in together I talk to Lexi about that and say we can all 3 stay together or however she would feel comfortable and Lexi responded with ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want her in OUR space‚Äù after back and forth I told her I‚Äôm moving in with my gf and she will need to figure something out she was upset but after saying she is still my bestie and she won‚Äôt lose me she agreed 

a few days later she said she needs to go out of town and asked me to watch her cat I told her explicitly that I will come by daily to feed her and keep up with the litter box ( she was going to be gone only 3 days) and she agreed on day 2 I get an angry text from her saying how I neglected her cat and didn‚Äôt give her the love and cuddles she needed I responded with I told you I would be at my gfs preparing for the move and I‚Äôll only come to feed her this made the living situation soooo toxic and she wouldn‚Äôt leave me alone, always picked up my phone when it went off, followed me from room to room when I said I needed space (I locked myself in my bedroom once and she didn‚Äôt stop knocking until I opened it I then tell her I‚Äôm going to stay at my gf for a few days for us to cool off cause I didn‚Äôt feel safe 

 that day I get a photo of all of my belongings thrown into my room with a text saying all your shit is here I want you out by the end of the month, I cried to my gf but we got a game plan together and took all of my things within a day other than my couch, I told her I will come back the next day for it but I needed a U-Haul, I have ended up getting sick and couldn‚Äôt go for like a week during that time it was radio silence from her I go back a week later with a text saying ‚Äúon my way‚Äù and her hearting the message 

when I opened the front door EVERYTHING WAS GONE my couch and all I called her asking her WTF and she was like oh I moved out and took the couch as a re payment for your betrayal. After debriefing with friends and family and my gf they all said it sounds like she was in love with and got jealous of my gf cause things got bad after she entered the picture soooo THT want do YOU think?",4,1760409742.0,TwoHotTakes,7,0.75,False

Are dating apps making you‚Ä¶¬†*unhinged*? üî•üî•üî•

Have you reached a point where no amount of¬†*coffee or bagels*¬†can make your heart race as you swipe through hundreds of incompatible profiles? Are you too busy to go out on a random¬†*Thursday*¬†night, and now convinced there are, in fact,¬†*not plenty of fish*¬†in the sea?

And last but not least...are you feeling like a lost soul¬†*bumbling*¬†through a wasteland called ‚Äúmodern dating""?

Fret not, my friend. FOCUS is here.

FOCUS is an **invite-only, in-person dating event** curated for people who are serious about connection but done bowing to the Dating App Overlords. We believe true compatibility starts with values and personality, not a 0.5-second glance at a bathroom selfie. That‚Äôs why our questionnaire is designed to cut through the noise and ask the questions that actually matter.

Other events brag about ‚Äúsmart matching‚Äù and personality algorithms. At FOCUS, we hand-pair people the old-fashioned way--like a team of underpaid, over-caffeinated luddites--because we believe AI won‚Äôt get you laid. Just laid off.

We work hard to take out the guesswork so you can focus on feeling the chemistry. As üëè you üëè should. üëè

This event caters to individuals ages **21‚Äì35** who are actively seeking **serious, committed, long-term relationships** in a **monogamous, hetero** context. (Other dating styles will be featured in future curated events.) Attendees will be matched within three age ranges: **21‚Äì26, 27‚Äì31, and 32‚Äì35.**

‚ÄãWe recognize that compatibility depends on many factors beyond age, so we may occasionally facilitate connections slightly outside your selected range (for example, when your age falls near a range boundary or when we identify a strong potential match)

‚ÄãWe‚Äôre committed to creating a respectful, safe space for meaningful connection. If you‚Äôre interested in a future curated event for other age groups, gender identities, communities, or relationship types, let us know here:¬†[https://forms.gle/mmY4iiVZSTNghr7a6](https://forms.gle/mmY4iiVZSTNghr7a6)",1,1760409646.0,mountainview,1,0.67,False

Jin:

1. Jin refuses to do partnered shoots with other women. He doesn‚Äôt want a fake intimate embrace to come off as a misconduct to you. He only does solo shoots now. If his agency wants a partnered shoot, you have to be the other person modeling with him.

2. He calls you ‚Äúmy wife‚Äù so much, he almost forgets your name. It‚Äôs always ‚Äúmy wife asked for no pickles.‚Äù and ‚ÄúMy wife likes this coffee brand the best.‚Äù I can see him with a folder in his gallery titled ‚Äúmy wife<3‚Äù. He keeps all the pictures he takes in that folder. Nothing naughty tho. That‚Äôs in a separate folder ;) 

3. Jin is physically affectionate. In public, he‚Äôll keep a hand on the small of your back, or his arm linked with yours. It‚Äôs his silent way of reassuring you and himself that you two will always be there for each other. A few times he lost you in the crowd and jumped on you like a damn, excitable puppy when he found you again.

My bsf (21f) & I (20f) have been friends for 4 years. She has a traumatic past (SA, Child abuse, homelessness) and it constantly affects her to this day. Every time we hang out she always brings up her past, or how she is currently extremely depressed, having problems with her bf/adoptive-family or is complaining about something. About a year ago, i unfriended her because she was constantly partying, had extremely bad friends and was in constant drama (I‚Äôm in school studying 24/7). But 6 months ago, we got back together after she told me she got her life together. But now, all she brings up is how she‚Äôs lonely and depressed. I‚Äôve always tried my best to lift her up and talk her out of her feelings but she just seems to keep wading in her sadness. She does therapy and medications but says it doesn‚Äôt help. I‚Äôm really at a loss of what to do at this point. I told her she needed to get a job so she can make some money and get out of the house. She agrees but never does anything about it. Then, every. single. time. i try and do something like painting or coffee she says she has no money. I don‚Äôt mind hanging out and chilling but it always turns into her ranting about her past or her current situation. It used to be a once a month thing but has been ramping up the frequency these past couple of months. Then, she comes to my house and stays for multiple days to do nothing and chilling with my sister (18f). I was blessed with stable-ish household so i used to never mind her coming over. but lately things have been a sht show at my house. My parents fight a lot now. My little brother poops his pants very often so my house always stinks. I‚Äôm failing my quizzes in class. I‚Äôm fed up with life and having her there is just the cherry on top for my stress levels. I‚Äôve tried to tell her to stay 1 or 2 days max but she comes practically every weekend. I know it‚Äôs not nice but i literally ignore her whenever she comes. she doesn‚Äôt care much and always sleeps with my sister. A couple of days ago she asked me to stay at my house for a month because she‚Äôs moving with her bf of 1 year to texas permanently but somehow can‚Äôt go with him until a certain time. idk. Im sad that she‚Äôs moving away but deep down im relieved. It‚Äôs mostly the ranting. I‚Äôve gotten her to stop talking about her bf 24/7 (she still does to some extent). but idk if i can say something about the stories.

1o63r18,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1o63r18/wi_weirdness_after_employee_survey_about_my/,[WI] Weirdness after employee survey about my supervisor. Should I loop in HR?,"Completed a ""confidential"" employee survey via third party using no names but the comments 100% give me away and I understood this when submitting it. I would still do it again, as everything I said was true and things need to change for myself, the company, and our patients. It's been bad for months. I did not want to go to HR and wanted the company to just fix it using my feedback, but now things are getting weird and I'm wondering if I need to loop in HR for my job protection. 

Here's what I reported:

(Used no names) I reported my supervisor for ganging up on me in meetings with another employee, undermining me/talking over me during meetings, giving me repeated dirty looks in the field, gossiping about subordinates to other subordinates, and the fact that other employees are scared of our supervisor due to her behavior/including her immaturity, insecurity, jealousy. I reported that this behavior is affecting employees, the company, and even patient outcomes, which I will explain.

The entire survey was about how we feel our supervisor is doing. Some survey questions surrounded things like: do you feel supported by your supervisor? Would you recommend working here? Would you leave if you had another opportunity?

I answered that I don't feel supported and I feel bullied and ganged up on, and that I love my job but I may leave depending on if my supervisors behavior escalates. We work in hospice and I reported truthfully, that I've felt discouraged from reporting patient pain due to supervisor backlash (protecting this other employee, an RN, that she gangs up on me with). Please note that pain management is what hospice is all about, but the group and my supervisor protect this RN even when what she is saying is not a reflection of the truth about patients and their situations (I didnt report this part).

After I submitted the survey, I realized there were so many concerning things I outlined that any good manager would have to submit it to HR. That wasn't my intent and I doubt it has gotten to HR, but I saw an immediate change in dynamics. This is still only 2 weeks fresh, but my supervisor acts scared of me and careful not to do anything negative to me. Her dirty looks and ganging up have stopped (so far). She and the RN are kissing my ass in the meetings they ganged up on me in, but higher ups are aligning with my supervisor in subtle ways. Hiigher ups are also avoiding me/acting fearful to engage with me.

To be clear: I have never once responded to my supervisor or this other employee in response to the very public bullying that I suspect the entire group will cover for out of fear and loyalty. I've never retaliated and never acted unprofessionally. I have asked other coworkers, inside this group meetings and outside, for input and advice without naming names. Ive gotten responses like: ""it took me a long time to understand group dynamics here,"" ""some people have a lot on their plate,"" ""I dont know what you mean, I haven't noticed"" (while doing everything possible to avoid being the next target). I addressed the RN privately, with other employees in the room who could overhear, asking if I had done something to her, said something to her that I am unaware of, that I need to apologize for. She denied it, and I respectfully asked her to engage professionally with me going forward, telling her that I respect her and have had no issue with anyone. 

My non reaction 100% highlighted my supervisors immaturity but the group still sides with her out of loyalty and fear (I am a newer employee and she rules by intimidation, triangulation, exaggerated gossip). I've done absolutely nothing to her. I do a good job and am an over achiever. I am younger and am attractive. Patients love me, I've been called ""the favorite."" I believe my supervisor began to hate me because I quietly refused to gossip about my coworkers with her or anyone else and refuse to play this game with her or be intimidated into siding against others. Despite being new, I am very good at what I do, which I am suspecting makes my coworkers feel insecure and like they have to compete with me, but I truly just love my job and want to do my absolute best for my patients. Somehow, its made everyone resentful, insecure, and untrusting, believing that I am a competitive person trying to make them look bad or incapable. Nothing I do seems to be right even when I do everything Ive been trained to do... it's like I am always 'doing too much'. I am quiet, calm, self-assured and described by my coworkers as ""cool headed, peaceful, calm."" My words are misconstrued as attacks on this RN who is beloved but very insecure. I barely speak in meetings anymore due to this.

So anyway, I wanted the survey to fix the bullying so I didn't have to contact HR. Now I'm thinking I should. This is why:

One week post survey, out of nowhere, one of my supervisors' peers who I seldom have contact with is asking me out for coffee, her treat, ""to see how things are going."" Of course I am extremely suspicious of this. Its not even her place to check in with me like this and no one ever has. I am not so stupid to bad mouth my supervisor to anyone, but this feels intrusive, suspect, and sneaky.

Please advise on what I should do. I do not want to quit my job... this is an incredible opportunity for me but I feel my supervisor and this RN are likely lying about me, and turning people against me to dislike me for no reason other than jealousy. I suspect I may need to loop in HR to protect my job.",0,1760409287.0,AskHR,15,0.33,False

1) Is it really possible, in our imperfect human condition, to *never* waver? Is it more about wavering as little as possible? 

I‚Äôm stuck in a loop where I feel i‚Äôve *really entered the sabbath this time!* and then after a few days a crash happens, triggered by nothing but my own fears/doubts. They start small and are easy to observe and ignore, but like a tidal wave they just relentlessly keep returning stronger each time until I‚Äôm back to feeling like I‚Äôm fooling myself and prolonging my hurt and healing. The biggest doubt I face is ‚Äúwhat if i do everything right, convince myself she‚Äôs coming back and she never actually does?‚Äù It‚Äôs also strongly tied to the fact that my practice sps aren‚Äôt manifesting either. I‚Äôm trying to let go and walk away, but something inside just doesn‚Äôt accept this reality, so I guess I‚Äôm going to keep coming back here until I succeed or get tired of breaking my own heart lol

2) I‚Äôve manifested specific car colors, coffee, a pair of shoes, some crazyyyy synchronicities and deja vu. But (and i‚Äôm aware the verbiage is an ‚Äúaffirmation‚Äù but please let me ask my question) my bigger manifestations are silent. Not only that, since i started consciously manifesting, my life is seemingly going a different direction (sudden car problems, loss of income, threatened homelessness). I keep feeling like i‚Äôm doing it right, but after so much time and certain scary deadlines approaching, it‚Äôs like standing in front of a train. I see people talking about how fast their life changed after using the law. BUT is there anyone out there who has seen success with the law after a slow start?

The first thing was when she tried to get me to meet another guy when I was in a relationship. I personally find that disrespectful to my boyfriend if I go meeting new guys and I did tell her that it was weird but she didn‚Äôt understand why. She would also get really irritated if I didn‚Äôt answer her phone calls and I explained to her that I don‚Äôt prefer to call unless it is an emergency and I would rather just meet up for a coffee but she would continue to call me. I was also preparing for shoulder surgery around this time and I was very stressed so the weekend before surgery I didn‚Äôt go to a gathering and only told the host I wasn‚Äôt going (not this friend as she wasn‚Äôt the host). Host had no problem with it and wished me luck on my surgery. On my way to surgery my friend texted me pissed that I didn‚Äôt tell her I wasn‚Äôt going (she is great friends with the host so it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs because she didn‚Äôt know anyone) and I explained that I was having shoulder surgery and just needed to focus on getting things organised. I said it‚Äôs a bit sad that she is not even wishing me good luck for surgery and she told me nobody cares. Another incident was when she went back to her home country for a visit and she was having drinks with her sister and her brother in law and saw a cute guy. Mind you, my grief has a boyfriend and told the brother in law to ask this cute guy to join their table and she got his instagram and they continued talking. Another instance was when we went to a local meetup and she wanted to leave as there were no got guys (again she has a boyfriend).

Ok so these are just some of the instances and she recently went back to her home country. I didn‚Äôt say I was uncomfortable with her behaviour as toward the end of her time in Australia she was preparing for an exam and stuff so I did not want her to have a bad departure. I messaged her wishing her well and congratulated her on getting a new job when she went back to her home country and she just left me on read for over 6 weeks and then suddenly texted me. I am just over her behaviour but don‚Äôt know how to address it. What do I do?

1o63ezi,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1o63ezi/am_i_the_asshole_for_saying_to_my_father_i_wish/,Am i the asshole for saying to my father i wish youd die,"hes been an abusive pos since the moment  i was born. When i was 4 he freaked out when babysitting me and my sister and he put us in car, drove like a maniac then rolled window down and screened at construction workers then got home and threw coffee and couch. Once he was in a rage and put holes in the wall in front of me and my sister. I think i was 10. I remember he threw a pizza at my mom once, and once on easter he threw coffee inside and it was everywhere. I remember when i was 10 he told me he was leaving and i was ‚Äú90% of this shit‚Äù. He once said he wishes i wasnt born, think i was 11. When i was 19 he ban ged his head on the wall and ran to his shed told me he was gonna  end  himself. i was dialing in 9 1 1 just so happen my mom pulled in the driveway. I remember on 4th july he woke and up freaked out for no reason and woke me and my sister up in a rage. i was probably 10. Once when i was 5 i asked him to help me with my legos and he grabbed it from me, looked at it, then threw it. When i was 12 he got in road rage with a biker and the biker said  some stuff. . i was terrifi ed.. My dad told me to suck it up or whatrver the fuck he said. And this is just the stuff that comes to the top of my head. Hes ruined vacations, holidays, etc

When i was 17 him and my uncle got in a huge blow out  at 3am. It got ugly then 
my uncle ran to closet for his you know what‚Ä¶ Scariest thing ever, i got  my mom and we ran.  9 1 1 came. Thanks to the both of them. 
 
Now, im 23 and im very angry and obviously its deep rooted. My parents are still married living happily ever after. They had countless of boy who cried wolf times where they were getting a ‚Äúdivorce‚Äù. During these times, my mom acknowledged all this abuse and how hes a nightmare. Now that everything is just ‚Äúdandy‚Äù she acts like nothing ever happened. . His mom was abusive supposedly. I havent heard from her in over ten years.. I honestly hate him, and ive tried to be neutral, but when i look at him i just feel disgusted. and ive told him i cant wait til he just passes. That  is wrong of me isnt it.
