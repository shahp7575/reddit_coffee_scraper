I’m pretty new to Reddit and thought I’d give this a shot since dating apps aren’t really my thing. I’m 20F, live in Texas, and currently in college working toward becoming a dental hygienist.

Faith is a big part of my life, and I want to be with someone who genuinely loves the Lord. I’d consider myself Baptist, though I don’t focus too much on denominations—it just helps explain my beliefs better. That said, if you’re Catholic or Orthodox, we probably wouldn’t be the best match. I believe in biblical leadership in relationships and marriage, and I want a man who will lead with wisdom and faith.

A little about me: I’m 5’2, Hispanic with a bit of Asian heritage (happy to share pictures), and I spend most of my time studying, helping out with my younger sibling, hanging out at coffee shops, or staying active at the gym or on walks. In the future, I’d love to be a stay-at-home mom and homeschool my kids, so I’m looking for someone who values family and shares that vision.

I do take care of my health and would like a partner who does the same. Ideally, I’m looking for someone between 20-29 who’s fit, grounded in his faith, and serious about building a Christ-centered relationship. I also tend to be more attracted to white men, so if you fit that and everything else I’m looking for, definitely reach out!

Btw, I'm okay with LD for now but hopefully not for too long.

If any of this sounds like you, send me a message. I’d love to chat and get to know you!",1,1738995015.0,ChristianDating,0,1.0,False

What’s Really Going On?,"Hey everyone, I’m new to the UAE, and something really strange caught my attention. I’ve noticed these late-night cafés and coffee shops in Abu Dhabi that look… different. They have dim lighting, LED strips glowing in the corners, and outside, you’ll often see groups of women mostly African and some from other nationalities just standing around, watching people pass by.

The first time I saw it, I didn’t think much. Maybe just a hangout spot, right? But then, something weird happened. One night, I was walking past alone when a Nigerian woman suddenly grabbed my hand and, in the most seductive voice, said, “Come inside, babe.” For a second, I froze. My mind went into overdrive what exactly was happening here?

Curious but cautious, I glanced inside. The place was almost pitch dark, except for those LED lights giving it an eerie glow. A few guys were sitting at tables, but something felt… off. It didn’t have the usual café vibe. It was too quiet, too secretive.

On another night, I saw a car pull up, and a man went inside, staying only for a short time before leaving. The whole thing looked so discreet yet out in the open. In a country as strict as the UAE, how is this happening so publicly? Is this some kind of licensed operation, or something else entirely?

Has anyone else noticed these places? Are they really just cafés, or is there something more going on behind those dark doors? Would love to hear your thoughts!",2,1738994828.0,dubai,2,0.75,False

One of the baristas was very friendly with me (memorizing my name and order) and would strike up a convo with me whenever i came in. While i understand that it’s literally their job to be friendly, i felt like we had enough in common (fav bands, tv, books) to be friends. While my gig has ended and i moved away, i still miss our little conversations. They took the time to memorize my work schedule and even told me what days they were working before i left so we could say goodbye. I’d really like to have their insta just to vaguely keep up with each other incase we’re ever in the same city again. 

While I feel like this is a bit of a one sided friendship and i worry that trying to find this barista will make them uncomfortable, they occasionally pop up into my head often enough for me to consider getting over these worries. I’m mostly writing this because i feel like this is just an OCD compulsion that i need someone else to squander. But let me know, is this friendship worth pursuing? 

(also, i don’t remember their name, im not sure if they just never told me or it got lost in the 100s of other names i’ve had to memorize for work, but i feel like this just further justifies the one sidedness. i’m also not even sure how to go about finding them, i wouldnt want to message their work cause that feels like a violation, but i also no longer know anyone who works in that city)",2,1738994732.0,Advice,1,1.0,False
1ikgmq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1ikgmq4/grandmas_beautiful_life_in_augenstadt/,Grandma’s Beautiful Life in Augenstadt,"Chapter 1: Playing in the Plastic Grass

I am lost. I have no words for what I have found. Due to this discovery horrifying me, I've decided that I can't process it alone. So I have chosen to share it with the world, hoping the input of others might help explain this.

Anyway, here is some background information on my predicament. My life is simple—I grew up in a small town, moved into the city, lost my parents in a horrible accident, and now I live alone in a small apartment.

Recently, I received a package. Inside was a small book, in brutal condition—muddied and bloodied. I have very little family, and there was no name on the package. So I opened the book, searching for answers. On the first page, it read:

“From Grandma, Thank you for giving me this beautiful life in Augenstadt.”

I was confused. My grandma had disappeared four years ago. She was an old woman, had memory issues, and was mostly blind—she could only read from inches away. She was not much of a fighter. But I loved her.

I had assumed she got lost in the woods by her house due to her condition and the lack of guidance she had in her life. Her husband had died when she was just a young woman, but she chose not to move on.

I felt scared. My legs were weak. I was standing alone in a dark apartment, reading a book covered in blood and dirt, sent from my presumed-dead grandma.

But, of course, I started reading.



From Grandma:

*""Thank you for giving me this beautiful life in Augenstadt. I am writing here from my cozy couch in my new home. It’s a struggle, as I have to hold this book close to my face, but I am learning to write well.

I woke up last week in a new home I’ve never seen, in a bed I’ve never laid in. I was scared, to be quite frank. But a doctor walked in. He explained to me that I got into a brutal accident after being hit by a car and that I’ve been in a coma for two years.

After I started showing signs of recovery and slowly began gaining consciousness, they moved me to this cozy little two-story house in a retirement town named Augenstadt. I’ve made friends with all the neighbors, and dear grandson, I think the mailman has a crush on me.

Things are going great. I’ve been waking up early, practicing my writing, drinking coffee. Oh, I’m just so happy.

Today was a little strange, though. I woke up, slowly went downstairs, and made a cup of coffee. My friend Sara stopped by to hand me a tray of muffins she made. I’ve never fully seen her face, but I assume it is beautiful. She’s a kind, tall woman with blonde hair.

But today, when she handed me the muffins, my hand brushed against her forearm. And I felt… hair.

I laughed a little. It was light hair, but you would think a fellow old maiden would keep her arms plucked clean. But oh well.

After she left, I went outside and took a seat on my favorite porch chair. The breeze feels the same as it does every day—it comes in small gusts of wind. I sit here every day, so I have time to analyze things like this.

The sun shines bright here. It’s a mix of pale white and orange-yellow. I can’t see the sky—it looks like a blur to me.

I wake up when the sun is up, and I fall asleep when it is up. But when I wake up in the night… I’m scared. It’s so, so dark. And silent.

There is never any wind.

But the doctor gave me sleep medication, so I fall asleep easily and stay asleep until the sun wakes me up.

But one time, I forgot to take it. And I woke up to the darkness.

Now I make sure to take my medication.

Anyway, back to what made today weird. I was walking to my mailbox when I tripped. I fell into the grass with a thud. I quickly gathered myself, and as I tried to stand up, I grabbed the grass.

It was… synthetic.

The grass felt thin, with a tarp-like texture. The dirt was small and rubbery, clumping in my hand. I was baffled at why the dirt was like this when I felt arms wrap around me and pull me up.

When I had been set on my feet, I recognized the voice that addressed me.

“Oh, Ms. Davis. You must stop falling like this,” said David, my neighbor.

He was a tall man—smart and kind. Always willing to help me when needed.

“I really didn’t intend to,” I said lightheartedly.

He hurriedly brushed the rubber dirt off my hands. He was about to say something when his phone rang.

The ringtone was a somewhat beautiful but slightly eerie opera song.

He quickly answered it and ran.

I was left alone in the blurry yard.

I slowly hurried back to the living room.

And that’s where I am now. I think I’m going to go to bed soon.

This is where I’m leaving off.

Goodnight.*

I’m scared.

I’m sitting in my room. It’s pitch black.

I’m hiding under my sheets with a flashlight, struggling to write this.

It’s dark. The darkness came from nowhere.

I went to the bathroom, came out… and the sun was gone.

I ran into my room, painfully hitting my hand on the wall, attempting to trail this path I have had to memorize.

The sun is gone.

It’s silent.

There is no wind outside.

I’m scared, William.

I’m scared.

Something is unnatural.

But after a knee injury last year, I thought my riding days were over. Then a buddy suggested I try an e-bike.

Anyway, I bit the bullet and ordered a VIVI last month. It arrived last week, and I've been riding it every day since. Assembly was a breeze - even a klutz like me managed it in under an hour.

First ride out, I tackled that killer hill near my house - the one that used to leave me gasping. Cruised up it like it was nothing! The assist modes are a godsend for my bum knee, but I can still get a workout when I want to.

The range is impressive too. Yesterday, I did a 40-mile round trip to my favorite coffee shop two towns over. Still had juice left when I got home.

My wife thought I was nuts for spending the money, but after borrowing it for a quick errand, she's singing a different tune. Caught her browsing VIVI's website last night - I think we might be a two e-bike family soon!

But one time, I forgot to take it. And I woke up to the darkness.

Now I make sure to take my medication.

Anyway, back to what made today weird. I was walking to my mailbox when I tripped. I fell into the grass with a thud. I quickly gathered myself, and as I tried to stand up, I grabbed the grass.

It was… synthetic.

The grass felt thin, with a tarp-like texture. The dirt was small and rubbery, clumping in my hand. I was baffled at why the dirt was like this when I felt arms wrap around me and pull me up.

When I had been set on my feet, I recognized the voice that addressed me.

“Oh, Ms. Davis. You must stop falling like this,” said David, my neighbor.

He was a tall man—smart and kind. Always willing to help me when needed.

“I really didn’t intend to,” I said lightheartedly.

He hurriedly brushed the rubber dirt off my hands. He was about to say something when his phone rang.

The ringtone was a somewhat beautiful but slightly eerie opera song.

He quickly answered it and ran.

I was left alone in the blurry yard.

I slowly hurried back to the living room.

And that’s where I am now. I think I’m going to go to bed soon.

This is where I’m leaving off.

Goodnight.*


---

I’m scared.

I’m sitting in my room. It’s pitch black.

I’m hiding under my sheets with a flashlight, struggling to write this.

It’s dark. The darkness came from nowhere.

I went to the bathroom, came out… and the sun was gone.

I ran into my room, painfully hitting my hand on the wall, attempting to trail this path I have had to memorize.

The sun is gone.

It’s silent.

There is no wind outside.

I’m scared, William.

I’m scared.

Something is off with this place.

Something is unnatural.

Something is fake.

I am probably just overreacting bu—...

What’s that..?

I hear something.

There’s something in the house.

William, I can hear its breathing.

**AITA for denying my ex his 'son' after he abandoned us and I took the choice alone to give him up for adoption?**

&#x200B;

Throwaway so get your 'this is fake because new account' comments out early.

I (32F) had a baby boy when I was 16. Yes, I know how that sounds like. No, we weren't careful. Judge me all you want on that front, I've dealt with that for years. Mike (33M) was my boyfriend then and when I found out about my pregnancy, he did a disappearing act with help from his family. Something something 'future college star' something.

My parents were always blunt: What happened next was my choice. After a lot of thinking, and deciding abortion just wasn't for me (I respect that right, I'm not here to debate it. It was just not for me), I chose to give up the baby for adoption. My parents knew a super sweet couple that were looking to adopt. We met and I just knew they were the right people. This turn from a teen mistake to an almost surrogacy. I started homeschool to finish my education and to have rest. The adoptive parents were with me for everything and even paid for most of the medical cost. The adoptive mother was a teacher, so she help me with my schoolwork and to prepare for college.

They were present for the birth and I refused to hold the baby. Instead, his actual mother did. And it was just right. I've stayed in the baby's life in a distant position as a 'special aunt'. Well, he's no longer a baby and he knows who I am, but his mom is the same woman that raised him and I continue to be his special aunt. The only change is now he knows who to call if he needs a kidney. His sense of humor is like mine, go figure. We talk maybe once in a blue moon, which in all honesty is the best. He's happy and I don't regret giving him up to have a happy life.

For my part, I married six years ago. My husband, Aaron, (44M) was divorce in good terms with Bella (40F). They have two children together. A boy that is 16 and a girl that is 19. Aaron made it clear since we began dating that his kids' approval was important and that Bella was part of his life forever. Not as a spouse but as a friend and mother to his children. I also told Bella and him about my teen pregnancy.

Well, to begin with the kids, my step-daughter and I get along well. She's obviously closer to her mother, but she still does 'girls' days with me every so often. It's more like friends though. My step-son is incredibly close to me. He calls me his 'other mom' and always asks me to be present for important events. We bonded when his childhood dog passed away, as my cat died about the same time.

Bella and I? We're best friends. I know people have complicated relationships with their partner's exes, but we always show respect to each other. I never tried to take her place. I know Aaron and her shared something special long before I was in the picture. That's their history. And I am a step-mom, not a mom. Her place in the kids' life is not up for competition.

The reason for this background is that the whole mess with Mike started when I took my step-son to a medical appointment. It wasn't serious, though he did have to use anesthesia. Aaron and Bella both couldn't get the day off. They tried, but their jobs are on call and they cannot easily take time off. So I went on my own to be my step-son's support. I didn't recognize Mike as one of the doctors. His real name, both first and last name, are incredibly common and it had been years. Not to mention my priority was being my step-son's support and everything else was secondary.

After my step-son was done, he was a bit out of it as expected. I was setting him up in the car and making sure he was comfortable when Mike came over. He told me he had been thinking about me and our 'son' for so long, and he was glad our boy was okay. It really took me a few minutes for my brain to click on what was going on and he kept on rambling about apologies and how he wasn't ready to be a father. Blah blah blah. Eventually I just sigh and loudly said: ""This is not the baby I was pregnant with. I gave him up for adoption after I gave birth. I am a step-mother."" My loopy step-son chimed in with: ""Other mom!"". I had to hold back a smirk to be honest.

Mike was stunned by that and it gave me time to catch him up on the important details. I gave up the baby, he knows what happened and why I gave him up, I married a man with two children, I am happy and don't want him in my life. And no, I won't give him contact information for the adoptive family. He is sixteen years too late. That was the end of it and I got into my car to get my step-son home to rest.

Since then Mike found me in social media and has been painting this sob story about me denying him a chance to be a father. How I was a poor mother that threw away her child to raise someone else's children. I'm basically the she-devil apparently. Most of our former classmates that saw the post reminded him that he LEFT me. Some of his HS friends even pointed out he laughed about leaving me pregnant. I didn't know that part.

A few of his relatives have reached out to bash me about taking Mike's chance to be a father. That it made me a 'poor Christian'. I'm not. I'm Jewish to begin with. A few friends did tell me it was a b\*tch move to give the baby up without telling Mike. I don't personally think I was in the wrong, but in case I decided to leave the judgement to the internet masses. So, reddit, AITA?

Clearing something out: The adoptive parents and bio-child have a phone number to contact Mike's parents if they want. I have no say if they do or not. I just won't give Mike any information on them.

*These people are fucking psycho. Block block block. Your bio kid might decide for himself to try and find his bio Dad one day, but it’s your job to defend his privacy until then. And make sure his decision is informed (i.e. he knows that his bio dad is a complete ass).*

>OOP: I told him everything when his parents decided it was time to tell him who I was really. I didn't make Mike into a villain, just said he left after I told him I was pregnant and never reached out. He's been clear that while I am his biological mother and Mike is his biological father, he doesn't see either of us as parents. I am his aunt and Mike is a stranger.

&#x200B;

**LibraryMouse4321**

*I hope Mike never finds him. If he does, make sure your “nephew” gets more details about Mike’s actions, so he doesn’t give him a chance at all.*

&#x200B;

**Beth21286**

*OP should definitely warn the kid's parents in case Mike shows up wanting to play at being dad. Finding someone isn't that hard these days and if OP is in their lives, even minimally, that will make it easier. Protect the kid.*

&#x200B;

AITA for denying my ex his 'son' after he abandoned us and I took the choice alone to give him up for adoption? Update This is probably the one and only update I'll be doing. Because to be honest, I got other things to do and I have my main reddit account for lurking.

I'm going to start with the important matter: A lot of people were worried about my biological kid and what he wished when it came to Mike. Well, I got his permission to post this. He spoke to Mike once a few days after I told him where he could find Mike. I won't share all the details, only the final decision. There won't be any more contact between them. The kid doesn't want a second dad and Mike wasn't willing to be in his life unless he had the position of 'dad'. So he's going no contact with Mike. There was more to it, but its very personal and I feel it's not my place to share it. The kid and I will continue to have a relationship as Aunt and nephew. And he knows whatever he needs medically, I'll always be first in line to give blood, kidney, etc.

For those wondering why Mike is so big into contact with the kid I found out a few details via his friends. Mike can have more kids. He just hasn't had a stable relationship in years. Which I can believe since I finally had enough and decided to accept going to have coffee with him to get some things squared away. My husband came of course, but he sat in another table to let me deal with it. I asked him to.

The conversation was a shit show, to be honest. Mike brought me flowers and chocolate covered strawberries, my old favorites. He treated it all like some date. I nip that bud immediately. I introduced my husband and told him we were very much in love and happy, so I don't appreciate any atttempts at unwanted romance.

Once we sat down, he started by telling me what I knew about him having failed relationships. That he felt no woman could meet his standards for a wife and mother to his children since he already saw me as that. He claims he feels guilty for choosing college over me and our baby. He was well aware of the court dates regarding custody and that I was trying to put the baby up for adoption. When he saw me taking care of my stepson, he thought I had chickened out of giving the baby away. Seeing me be all caring of 'our baby boy' made him think how great it would be if the three of us could be a family, and maybe have a bigger family down the road. He had the gall to ask me if I would consider divorcing my husband and try to fight for custody of 'our son'.

I have to admit, I laughed in his face. I probably was overly cruel, but I had years of stress, heartache, and judgemental encounters to drop on him. I told him all I saw in him was a coward. A coward that instead of staying to make adult decisions decided to run with help of mommy and daddy. That any love I had for him died the day I had to push out a full human being and instead of knowing I had support from him, there was a big empty spot where the 'dad' was supposed to be. That I almost ruined my life and had to throw away prom, senior pictures, and even graduation, because I was far too pregnant to party, appear on the yearbook or walk into stage to get my diploma. He got to party and enjoy life while I had to fight tooth and nail for an inch of respect, yet we both had unprotected sex. The only difference is his d\*ck wasn't big enough to pop a baby out or satisfy a woman to begin with (That was a bit mean, but not sorry).

After I calmed down, I simply told him I had a happy life with a man that loves me. Great step-kids that are the greatest gift. A best friend who lets me be a stepmom to her children. A nephew who I adore and who despite our history as biological mother and child, he still loves me as his special aunt rather than hate me. My family is perfect because he's not part of it and I have no intentions to live in his fantasy. And that I can't wait to get pregnant with my husband's child to add to that perfection.

I also told him to leave the our biological kid alone. He has made his choice and it is up to him if he ever reaches out for Mike. And also let him know I would be making a formal complaint to his hospital for his harrassment.

Good thing my husband took screenshots, because by the time we got home, Mike had deleted all the posts. A lot of his former friends did repost screenshots making fun of him. The silver line in all of this is that I have reconnected with my high school classmates and to be honest, they are great people. Seems Mike is in a handful that stayed in his 'school hype' mindset.

It's been about three days and no signs of Mike. My husband did get the biggest ego boost when he overheard me going off on Mike and has been insufferable, in a good way. So, there's mostly good news. Hopefully one of these days we'll get even more good news since we actually are excited at the idea of having a baby together.

*Regarding him asking you to divorce your husband and fight together for “our son”, outside of getting physical, there’s practically no “overreaction” to that.*

>OOP: I almost got physical to be honest. But I had my nails just done. He wasn't worth breaking a nail.

&#x200B;

**LibraryMouse4321**

*Very few things are worth breaking a nail, but hon, breaking one to hurt that bastard would have been one of those things.*

>OOP: Yeah, but he's not worth the 150 bill. He wasn't even worth the 14 dollars bill at the cafe.

Still not excluding hormones since it is so resistant to topicals. Maybe clindamicin will help, should I try that?

With all that said, could that be fillers? Anyone experienced that? I know breast implant can cause sickness, so it is possible for fillers to cause acne, isn't it?

Hey,

So I have a Lelit pl81t machine with a few eureka mignon silenzio grinder. I added a bigger dial to the grinder to be able to fine tune the grind size.

I grind 18g in 9,3 seconds and pull shots with 2:1 ratio in 30 seconds. I play around with the ratio of 1.5-2.5:1 and a extraction time of 25-35 seconds. So I think the grind size is good and fine enough - finer will delay the shot massively.

With pre infusion on or off, counting at the first drop hitting the cup, IMS basket or standard, it all doesn't matter. I cannot replicate good shots.

From the last 800g of beans only about 1 shot wad very tasty, the rest bitter, sour, whatnot. I wrote down all the parameters for each shot, did the technique of just pulling the same shots in different cups but I can't seem to hit the sweetness again.

Maybe it's the beans I don't like, maybe it's my grinder, my machine but probably it's my skill of tuning everything.

So.. Long story short : what helped you pull better shots when you get no good coffee out of the beans but the parameters are all in the ballpark of being good!

1ikga1x,https://www.reddit.com/r/mortgageItalyexpats/comments/1ikga1x/stereotypes_and_false_myths_about_italy_and/,Stereotypes and false myths about Italy and Italians,"Every culture is associated with stereotypes and false myths that are often difficult to dispel, and Italian culture is no different. As with other cultures, what people consider 'stereotypical Italian' does not always correspond to reality, so there are also many myths to dispel!

Many of the articles you find online about Italians actually describe stereotypes of Italian-Americans, which are a completely different thing. Italian-Americans have developed a different subculture, a different food, a different language and a very different way of being.

Let's find out and debunk some stereotypes:

**1.         Italians are all 'mommies**

This is true, in part. The reality is more complex and not all Italians fall into this category. The cliché of Italians clinging to their mothers' skirts is based on the fact that family is important to Italians.

Traditionally, warm, Catholic and Mediterranean countries are more associated with the concept of 'family' than Nordic and Anglo-Saxon countries.

Very often this relationship continues even if one gets married or leaves home.

This can be traced back to the sense of family that already existed among the Romans, while among other peoples the concept of clan or tribe prevailed.

The precariousness of work, the fact that people get married later and later, etc. means that the time spent under the mother's roof is much longer, proportionally, than in other countries, especially in Northern Europe, where as soon as people come of age they already live alone. Even after one has married or moved in together, in the absence of adequate facilities to keep one's children, the contribution and cooperation of the parents (the children's grandparents), who look after them, take them back and forth to the nursery, etc., becomes important.

It should also be added that Italian mothers, unlike their Scandinavian, Dutch, German 'colleagues' etc., are much more apprehensive. This conception is so widespread that it makes them, together with Jewish mothers (the Yiddish mothers), among the most stereotyped in the world.

**2.         Italians are noisy**

It depends. Not all Italians are noisy. Some are. The passionate and animated way Italians express themselves, combined with their tendency to speak with enthusiasm, contributes to the perception of being noisy.

In southern Italy we tend to speak louder, but it is a simple, genuine and sincere way of being.

Our language, beautiful and musical, is often appreciated abroad, but this is certainly also due to the decibel overload in our vocal cords compared to the world average.

**3.         Italians are always late**

Here, too, it depends. OK, some Italians are often late. But not all of them.

The Italian has an innate cult of the Dolce Vita. Of dilated times and of doing everything calmly and relaxed.

Perhaps it is also because the Italian is damn scrupulous in taking care of both aesthetics and clothing, taking a long time to get all the details and combinations in place. Perhaps this is also why Italian designers are the most renowned in the world.

**4.         Italians are very religious**

Yes and no. Perhaps there are many Italians who go to mass, but despite all this fervour, Italy is not populated by mystics and hermits.

You could say that everyone, more or less, has received a Catholic education, but that does not mean they are religious.

Of course, the Catholic religion is an integral part of Italian culture. Many idioms derive precisely from religion. For example, an unfortunate and unlucky person is a 'poor Christ', an infrequent occurrence that happens at 'every death of the Pope', and the simple word 'a Christian' can be synonymous with a human being'. When we take a tour of Italy, we are obliged to visit churches, because that is usually where the most interesting masterpieces are to be found.

**5.         Italians are football fanatics**

YES. Of course, not all Italians love football, but most do.

The Italians' passion for football is a complex phenomenon that cannot be explained by a single reason. It is a combination of historical, cultural, social and psychological factors that make football a fundamental sport in the lives of many people in Italy.

Football is seen as an expression of Italian identity and a way to unite people from different backgrounds.

Football matches are an important social event, providing an opportunity to get together with friends and family and to experience strong emotions.

Passion for football is also a way to express one's individuality and feel part of a community.

**6.         Italians eat pasta and pizza every day**

No, it is not true that Italians eat pasta and pizza every day. The Italian diet is very varied and depends on many factors, including personal taste, the region where one lives and individual eating habits. Although pasta and pizza are two iconic elements of Italian cuisine and many Italians consume them regularly, they are not the only foods that make up the diet of Italians. As far as pasta is concerned, this may be true. Pizza is a food that is usually consumed once a week, as a special occasion, ordered to take away. The most popular pizza nights are Saturdays and Sundays.

**7.         Italians use the bidet**

True! The bidet is very common in Italy and is widely used by the population. The bidet is a sanitary device that allows for more effective and hygienic intimate cleansing than just using toilet paper. In Italy, the bidet is considered an essential element in every bathroom, so much so that it is impossible to find an Italian home without one. In addition to personal hygiene, the bidet is sometimes also used for washing feet or for other uses related to personal cleanliness.

Many expatriate Italians in other countries have built their homes with a bidet in the bathroom.

Italians use it every day and cannot understand how the rest of the world can do without it.

**8.         Italians talk with their hands**

Absolutely true and undeniable. Gestures 'in Italian' are fundamental, an integral part of the language and indispensable in communication. Gestures do not replace speech, but enrich it.

Try speaking without moving a muscle: your voice will be monotonous and insignificant.

It is a parallel language that adds nuance or changes the meaning of speech.

Much more than mere folklore. Another explanation could be the Italians' need to develop an alternative form of communication during the centuries when the peninsula was occupied by foreign powers such as Austria, France and Spain between the 14th and 19th centuries.

In Italy, however, gestures are a very important cultural element and not mere folklore. Gestures are a codified and precise language and have a clear meaning for those who interpret them.

Gestures are many and each one has a different meaning. Sometimes, a gesture, if made with a different speed or at a different angle, means something different.

Italians do not make gestures at random. And they hate it when they see people imitating Italians, making meaningless gestures.

**9.         Italians are all Casanova**

It depends. Maybe past generations were more full of womanizers. Today there are not so many.

Foreigners, or rather foreigners, think that Italian men often make comments and boo women in the street. This idea sees the Italian man as a born seducer who tries to conquer as many women as possible. Although not all Italians are like this, many are proud of this image.

In the 1960s this attitude was even stronger because Italian women were more reserved than foreigners. Italian men, therefore, tried to seduce female tourists, who were considered easier. With time, Italian women have become freer, but the tendency to court foreigners remains in some places.

This behaviour seems to confirm a man's virility in front of others. In Italy, showing interest in women is a confirmation of masculinity. But Italian women also sometimes nurture this attitude, taking great care of their appearance and expecting attention from men.

Courtship is therefore a game of interaction between men and women in Italy. Foreign women can choose to participate in it or not. For example, some German girls go to Italy just to be courted. Seduction is seen as an art that requires practice and creativity and is never aggressive, but a social game.

 

**10.       Italians are all connected to the mafia**

Many foreigners have stereotypes about Italians, one of which is that all Italians are somehow connected to the mafia. However, this is a misconception about Italian culture. Italy is a country rich in history, art, science and innovation and the vast majority of Italians have no connection to the Mafia.

The perception of the Mafia as a central element of Italian life is often exaggerated in foreign media and films, where the Mafia is often portrayed in a sensationalistic manner. Although the Mafia is a real problem in Italy and has had a significant impact on certain regions and sectors of society, it does not represent the daily life of most Italians.

**11.       Italians do not pay taxes**

The statement that 'Italians do not pay taxes' is a cliché and an overgeneralisation that does not reflect reality at all. As in every country, Italy has people who pay taxes regularly and people who evade them regularly. Tax evasion is a recognised problem in Italy, but it is not correct to say that all Italians avoid paying taxes.

There is ample evidence that the vast majority of Italians are regular tax payers.

**12.       Italians do not know how to stand in line**

YES. They don't know how to do it. And nobody has yet understood why

**13.       Italians are very jealous**

Everywhere there are fiery, vindictive and jealous people, and Italians are no different. The majority of Italians have no doubt: jealousy is inscribed in their genes. According to seven out of ten interviewees, it is the individual genetic heritage that determines the greater or lesser propensity for jealousy. According to them, people who are more prone to jealousy do not owe this tendency to their upbringing, experiences or role models, but to their biological constitution. In other words, they are genetically inclined to jealousy.

**14.       Italians drive like crazy**

This is not entirely true.

Italian roads might appear to the eyes of a foreigner as a chaotic daily hell from which one emerges unharmed by pure chance. To an Italian, on the other hand, the driving behaviour of other Europeans may seem boring and lacking in inventiveness. In Italy, driving is seen as an art of creativity and adaptation.

Contrary to the opinion that Italians are ignorant of road rules, they are actually followed, but with a local interpretation that may differ from that of other countries.

There is no denying that for some Italians, the motorway becomes an arena similar to Formula One, where speed is of the essence and slow drivers are scarcely tolerated.

Another typical aspect is the reaction to the green light: those who do not start up again within a second and a half after it has been activated are overwhelmed by honking and swearing.

Finally, pedestrian crossing in Italy is an art of survival. The safest technique consists of a 'dance' of steps back and forth until you make eye contact with the driver, proceeding only when you are 100 per cent certain that the car will stop.

**15.       Italians wear sunglasses all day long**

Let's say so! Italians often wear sunglasses. The reason is simple: the sun shines a lot in Italy. Sunglasses are often considered an indispensable accessory for most Italians, who are used to never leaving the house without them and choosing the most suitable pair according to the look they wear every day. Unfortunately, however, few think that wearing a pair of sunglasses is also a matter of health.

**16.       Italian men all wear a gold necklace**

This is almost true. This stems from the custom of giving these necklaces to children at their christenings. Girls, on the other hand, received a necklace with the Madonna. But girls usually did not wear it. Young people, although they sometimes still receive the necklace, no longer wear it. It is not fashionable.

**17.       Italians are obsessed with Italian coffee**

I have to confirm this. Italians are obsessed with Italian coffee

Italy has a long and rich tradition of coffee production and consumption that dates back to the 16th century and is considered an integral part of Italian culture and identity.

Italian coffee is generally considered superior to coffee from other countries and the coffee ritual is an important social moment in Italy.

People meet in bars to have a coffee and chat with friends and family.

Coffee is considered an essential part of daily life in Italy.

Many Italians drink coffee in the morning to start the day and during the day to take a break.

Coffee is seen as a way to increase energy and concentration.

Besides these reasons, there are also some psychological aspects that may contribute to the Italian obsession with coffee. For instance, coffee is known to increase levels of dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure and reward. This may contribute to the sense of well-being and satisfaction that Italians feel when they drink coffee.

**18.       Italians don't speak English**

It is a commonplace that Italians do not speak English, but this is not entirely true.

According to the EF English Proficiency Index 2023, Italy ranks 30th out of 111 countries for English proficiency.

This means that most Italians have a basic knowledge of English, but are not fluent. However, the situation is improving.

In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of Italians learning English.

This is partly due to the fact that English is increasingly important in the working world and partly due to the fact that Italians are travelling abroad more. So, it is true that Italians do not know English as well as other European countries on average, but the situation is improving.

**19.       Italians always sing... or almost!**

It is true that Italians have a great passion for music and singing, but they don't always sing... and not all of them!

Music is an important part of Italian culture.

There are many popular music genres in Italy, including opera, pop music, rock and popular music. Italians love to sing together, both in public and in private. It is common to hear people singing in the streets, restaurants and bars.

**20.       Italians play the mandolin**

It is true that the mandolin is a musical instrument associated with Italy, particularly southern Italy.

It is a popular instrument in many regions of Italy, including Campania, Apulia, Sicily and Calabria. The mandolin is often used in Italian popular music, such as the tarantella and the serenata. Of course, not all Italians play the mandolin.

It is a relatively difficult instrument to learn to play. Moreover, it is not always easy to find a mandolin teacher. The mandolin is often used in films and TV series set in Italy. But very few people in Italy know how to play the mandolin.

So, no, it is not a popular instrument.

**21.       Italians are all friendly**

To say that all Italians are friendly is simply untrue.

However, it is true that hospitality and friendliness are very important values in Italian culture.

Here are some reasons why Italians are said to be friendly:

·      Italians love to be in company and socialise.

·      They are generally open and welcoming to foreigners.

·      They often take the time to meet new people and make friends.

·      They love to chat and are always ready to help.

Of course, there are also Italians who are not friendly.

As in any other country, some people are introverted or shy.

Also, some people may have had negative experiences with foreigners and, therefore, be more wary. However, in general, Italians are a warm and welcoming people.

If you visit Italy, you are likely to feel comfortable and easily make new friends.

**22.       Italians have large families**

It was true... once upon a time. Not anymore!

Italian families used to be known for being very large, but things have changed. Today, Italy is one of the European countries where fewer children are born. To give you a better idea, in 2023, on average, each woman in Italy had about 1.29 children. This number is much lower than 2.1, which is considered the number of children needed per woman for a country's population to remain stable without decreasing. Therefore, the current reality in Italy is very different from that of the past, when large families were the norm.

**23.       Italians understand Spanish**

This is partly true.

Italians, especially in the south of the country, show a certain ease in understanding Spanish, a phenomenon that is not limited to the simple similarity between the two languages, both belonging to the Latin language family. This affinity goes beyond sharing common Latin roots, as in southern Italy several dialects have a significant number of linguistic borrowings from Spanish. This phenomenon can be attributed to the long Spanish domination of the region, which began in 1559 and ended in the early 18th century. During this period, the Spanish imprint took deep root in the local culture, influencing not only the language but also traditions, art, architecture and gastronomy.

In the linguistic context, many terms of Spanish origin were assimilated into the dialects of the Mezzogiorno, sometimes with slight phonetic or morphological modifications, but maintaining an apparent similarity to the original words. These linguistic borrowings are particularly widespread in regions such as Sicily, Calabria and Apulia, where the Spanish past has left an indelible mark.

On the culinary front, the Spanish influence is equally evident in many typical southern Italian dishes. During their domination, the Spanish introduced new ingredients and cooking methods that merged with local tradition, creating a hybrid cuisine that retains traces of this cultural encounter. For example, the abundant use of tomatoes, peppers and aubergines in southern cooking reflects the introduction of these foods into Europe by the Spanish, who in turn had received them from the New World.

Spanish rule left a lasting legacy in southern Italy, weaving a cultural bond that manifests itself in language, gastronomy and regional identity.

Teacher and student father (M4a or m4f) only discord and Instagram 


I’m the father of my 7-year-old son/daughter—a brilliant but mischievous kid. Recently, I was called to the principal’s office because my child decided to rip up another student’s book. After a stern discussion with the principal, I was directed to visit the class teacher’s room for further guidance.

I knocked on her door, and a soft, sweet voice answered, “Yes, please, come in.” I stepped inside with my child, taking a seat at her desk. The moment I saw her, my attention shifted. She was wearing a traditional saree, draped elegantly, and her natural charm was impossible to ignore. Her warm smile and graceful demeanor made it difficult to focus on the reason I was there.

As she began discussing my child’s results and behavior, I found myself less interested in the report card and more captivated by her. It was as if the world slowed down. Then, almost unexpectedly, she looked at me and asked, “Would you like to meet for coffee?”

Her words caught me off guard, but I quickly replied, “Yes, please,” without hesitation.

What could she possibly want to discuss over coffee? Was it about my child—or something more? I couldn’t wait to find out.

We had some ups and downs, discussions, but in general we really enjoy spending time with each other and are very in love. I struggle a bit with him having a lot of close female friends. While I met some of them and I’m cool with him hanging out with them, there’s others I somehow struggle with. 

When we were dating for 2 months he was supposed to go on a holiday with 2 friends. One friend cancelled meaning he was going alone one of his female friends, who I had never met before. They invited me to go with them, but I didn’t want to/couldn’t really make it. I said I wasn’t comfortable with him going but he assured me that they’re just friends and that I can still come if I change my mind. He even offered to pay for it. I said I’ll trust him but that I’d like them to have separate rooms.

While they were on holiday, he was communicating with me consistently and keeping me updated, but maybe hasn’t done as much effort to call on the phone as I would have liked him to. I felt really shit about it, we had some fights and this experience kinda scarred me.  

I met this girl only once and for a short moment couple weeks later, when he was out will the friend group and I joined. She made an effort to talk to me, but it all felt a bit awkward. When saying goodbye, she gave him a hug which was a bit too warm in my eyes. I told him how I felt about the meeting but still wanted to be open to meet her again and get to know her properly. 

For different reasons they haven’t seen each other in a while. He was also gone traveling, her as well. I saw how she texts him and it made me feel quite uncomfortable, it’s very affectionate but in my eyes - too affectionate. They saw each other in a group setting but still wanted to properly catch up one on one, so they decided to have dinner at her place.

I said I was somehow still a bit uncomfortable about them hanging out alone. He promised he wants us to meet properly so I wouldn’t feel like that anymore. I asked if they could meet for a coffee over the weekend instead of dinner, but it didn’t work out.

Eventually, he went for dinner to her place and I felt a bit stressed about it in the back of my mind. But he has been quite reassuring, offering to have a sleepover that night, so I didn’t feel stressed. After some time I figured he has been there for over 3 hours, so I told him that I was uncomfortable with that. He still stayed there for another hour. This made me super anxious and I got really stressed, we got into a fight.

I’m questioning if this is an issue of compatibility or if I’m being very jealous. I really love him and he is great on many other aspects, I see a future with this guy. Still, I’m not very comfortable with my boyfriend spending so many hours at a female friends place, with others or me not being there. I would like him to have firmer boundaries with his female friends. However, I feel like he feels controlled by me. He said “does it mean you’ll have to approve everyone I hangout with?”

I’m not sure what to do. I am a bit anxious and jealous, I figured this out also based on how I behaved in past relationships. I’m working on that with a therapist. But what can I do now to make this work for both of us?",1,1738992764.0,relationship_advice,5,0.99,False

I have all of my own dishes in the kitchen but I put them in very specific places. If my stuff isn’t in one of those places then it’s safe to assume it isn’t mine. Stop moving it. Stop touching it. Just put it down and leave it alone. 

First it was lighters that were left on the table, then it was a microfiber cloth that I can’t even touch that they moved onto my coffee maker, now it’s a fucking container that doesn’t belong to me and I almost had a heart attack because I couldn’t find my plate.

If at half time, before eggs start baking, i shake them, then the result is perfect.

Now, i dont want to make that process, shaking them at half time as this is a loss of time and energy. This is not sustainable for larger volume.

1ikfutp,https://www.reddit.com/r/badbreath/comments/1ikfutp/embarrassed/,Embarrassed,"Since June of last year I’ve had quite the bad breath difficulties. Not just dragon breath or onion breath, but breath that my fiancée describes as an “old ladies basement.” So mothballish. And yeah, I can taste it in my mouth too….. At first I thought I wasn’t flossing enough. After exhausting appts with my dentist who didn’t see any issues about why I’d have bad breath (which I don’t go to anymore because they overlooked the HOLE in my tooth and also overcharged me) I even thought maybe it was my tonsils (it’s not.) I finally got recommended to a periodontist. He immediately found a hole in my tooth (which wasn’t the reason for the bad breath) and also suggested a root and scale cleaning. I got both sides of my mouth deep cleaned. I was broke after lol. I went to a new dentist and got the hole fixed. Still after allll of this my breath issue isn’t fixed. My periodontist did tell me there’s a divot in the back of my gums because they messed up the stitching from my wisdom teeth 8 years ago. Again, that was 8 years ago and I never struggled with breath this bad so I don’t get it.
I’m an avid coffee drinker (with creamer) as well as a pop drinker(zero sugar but still) and a teacher so I don’t usually brush after having coffee. Idk, maybe I should during my work break. But no matter how much I brush and floss, the smell is still there. My next dentist appointment isn’t until JUNE. I’m begging for suggestions. I’ve used everything from the reacher flosser to a waterpik and now I’m considering a dental syringe maybe to get up in that divot? I’m just so frustrated my breath is so bad and I am embarrassed to talk to people.

If it’s not coming from my teeth then I don’t know because the smell comes from the spot where the divot is. I have smelled it on my floss before… or could it a GERD/gastro issue? I do suffer from GERD as well!",3,1738991895.0,badbreath,2,1.0,False

**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ies40z/aita_for_kicking_out_my_moms_boyfriend/)**: January 31, 2025**

When I was 17 my mom came into money. She tried to keep it quiet but she paid off my dad’s debts, bought him a small house, paid off her debts and paid for my sister’s college and set up funds for mine. She had a boyfriend at the time and shortly after him and his son who was 7 moved into our new house.

Over the next few years mom bought my sister a house after she graduated college. Her boyfriend lived with us and didn’t pay anything but he did work.

When I was 21 mom got diagnosed with cancer. It wasn’t good. She sat me and my sister down and went over exactly how much money there was. She intended to give her current house to me and both me and my sister were left with a large sum at the end of it. She asked if I would allow her boyfriend to stay in the house with his son until he got his own place. I agreed.

Before she died she told her boyfriend he would need to look for his own place but had time to save more for that journey.

For the last 4 years he has continued to reside in the house with his son. I haven’t minded because we get along okay. I pay all the bills but he does buy food for him and his kid.

He has dated off and on and mostly kept the women out of this house which I respected him for. Until his current partner. She’s been in my house 3 times and at first besides feeling a little uncomfortable I was okay with her. The last time this past weekend was the point where I lost my shit.

I was making myself some lunch when she came walking downstairs. She grabbed a plate and went to grab food out of my pan. I asked her what she thought was doing. She started telling me how I should look for somewhere else to live and leeching off my dead mom’s past relationship as an adult was pathetic.

I hollered for my mom’s old boyfriend he came down and I told him I didn’t know what he current thing thought but I wasn’t going to be disrespected in my house. He wouldn’t even look me in the eyes as he mumbled something about my mom promising him the house and he was just “being kind” letting me stay.

First that isn’t remotely true. Mom pulled him and i together after she asked if he could stay to set expectations. My mom met him shortly before she won the money and told him and us girls that she had no intention of leaving him money. She did set aside a fund for his son for college when he gets there but he cannot touch it, only his son can. He has lived in this house almost 8 years without paying a dime he should have plenty of money and if he doesn’t that’s on him.

I told him he had 30 days to leave. I wasn’t going to house someone who would lie and disrespect me in my house. He left that night with his son but his ex wife called to tell me I am cruel and an AH for her son losing his house (he is here every other week).

I really feel like my mom didn’t expect him to still be here but my sister said she feels like I am breaking my promise to my mom and that made me feel like maybe I am the AH.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: If it happened exactly how you said, you’re not the asshole.

If she did say he had time to save, but would need to look for his own place, that means she never imagined or wanted him staying for long. So you’re breaking no promises.

Did she leave him any money or assets? It’s totally possible that your mother would be livid if she knew her boyfriend was still living with her son after 4 years.

>**OOP:** No she created a fund for his son for his college but that was the only money set aside for him or his son. It’s a generous amount enough for 4 years at a high dollar school. Anything not used for school will be given to him on his 25th birthday from what I believe she told me (a lawyer and accountant are in charge of those funds not me or my sister so I only know what she told us before she died).  
She was never married to or even engaged to her boyfriend. He lived with his sister and was saving for his own house when mom met him. Him moving in with us was supposed to be temporary and allow him to save to buy his dream home but he never left. My mom was like that though-she had a big heart and sometimes people took advantage of that (especially after the money). She bought him a brand new truck when his car broke down but beyond that and smaller gifts (like tv computer etc for birthdays and holiday gifts) she did not leave him money. They had no joint accounts my mom paid everything and he was supposed to be saving for a house the whole time they were together.

Commenter: Guessing to the Miss Thangs over the years he's lived rent/utility-free in OP's house. 

I'm also giving the stink eye to the sister laying the guilt-trip on OP for evicting him. 

>**OOP:** I don’t think my sister meant any harm. Probably feels a little sad like me that his son won’t be around. I don’t expect we will get to visit with the kid (he’s 15) and we both like him and have known him awhile. The three of us gamed together some over the years and usually did an outing once every month or two to arcades or amusement parks or something like that together.

Commenter: \[...\] I'm curious just how long your sister thinks he & son should be allowed to freeload off you. She doesn't have the warm fuzzies for him, does she? 

>**OOP:** No but she’s kind of a pushover like our mom was. Super kind hearted but to a fault. Heck maybe I am to, to an extent. I just don’t put up with disrespect.

Commenter: Was his gf shocked and believed him or was she trying to start the take over or at least try to? It's possible he lied to her but it's also possible she knew but was wanting to come in and take over it happens all the time. I would hire movers if they left anything do not let them back in it could be hell getting them out. Lucky they left

>**OOP:** She seemed smug the whole time so I suspect she put him up to it because he and I always got along before this. He didn’t argue when I kicked him out. He did text me and asked to come by this weekend to get his stuff and asked if I would be willing to talk. I told him my dad and boyfriend will be here and he agreed to that.  
*How gf reacted when she found out:*  
She sat with her arms crossed when he and I talked but she didn’t say anything else she left with him.

*OOP responds to a longer* [Comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ies40z/comment/maalol5/):

>Thank you so much. My mom was the sweetest person and when I was a teenager I feel like I was a nightmare to her. I am thankful I was much better in my late teens and 20&21 so she got to see me mature a little before she passed. I wasn’t always the best daughter but she was always the best mom.  
I think part of letting him stay so long is having bonded with his son but also I liked having someone else around who loved my mom too. There were nights I would wake up from a nightmare and end up in the kitchen and he would hear me and just come make a cup of coffee and sit and share a story about her. His son loved mom too and some evenings we would get takeout and watch movies and joke about what commentary my mom would have had if she had seen the movie with us. My sister lives a state away so we only really see each other once a month or so. I liked not being alone in this big house.  
I do have a security system and the locks have been changed. He is coming over tomorrow to get his stuff.

*To a detailed* [accusation](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ies40z/comment/madh14r/) *that this is a creative writing prompt:*

>Neither me nor my sister were teenagers when my mom passed away. I was the youngest at 21. And the funds have been in a trust but it wasn’t related to this story and the character limit made me already limit things I said. I won’t have full access to the funds left to me until I am 30 but I can request additional access through the trustees and I get monthly funds for bills and spending (my mom paid for people to manage both me, my sister’s, and her boyfriend’s sons trust (yes his college fund is in a trust as well thus why his dad has no access to it).  
Personally I love Reddit this is a throwaway because I don’t want to dox myself and my actual account has photos of myself and my pets. But no one in my real life knows about the money except family and my mom’s boyfriend doesn’t even know how much money just that there was money (not even my boyfriend knows).  
Edit to add: journey was my mom’s words to her boyfriend when we all sat down, which is why I used that word. She was super into historical fiction romance novels and she used some old phrasing in real life sometimes because of it. My sister and I used to tease her for it all the time.

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ifedil/update_aita_for_kicking_out_my_moms_boyfriend/)**: February 1, 2025 (Next Day)**

I know the other sub is very subjective on updates so I figured I would post it here.

I do want to take a moment to address some things I saw in the comment.

1-there are trusts set up and neither me nor my sister has full access to the money left us. This was done both because my sister and I were in our early 20s when my mom died and she wanted to make sure we had some stability before we had access and to protect us from people who may try to take advantage especially while we were grieving.

2-I have a lawyer. He has already informed me legally to my area what eviction laws are and my mom’s former boyfriend will be served with formal eviction papers just to cover myself even after today.

So to the update:

My dad came over (decided not to have my boyfriend over since he doesn’t know about the money side and I wasn’t trying to have the boyfriend out the situation) this morning and brought along my cousin. For easier telling I’m going to call mom’s former boyfriend Chuck.

Chuck showed up about 10am my time and talked to my dad then asked if he could have a couple of minutes alone with me. Dad nodded so my cousin and him went into the kitchen and Chuck and I sat in the living room.

I’ll be honest I didn’t expect it to go as it had but I am glad it did. Chuck started with an apology. I don’t remember all of the words said but the basics were he missed my mom, he has been lonely but not alone thanks to me and his son. He was sorry for what had happened that he got caught up in lust and let someone else fill his head with ideas and that he owned up to his mistakes and should have never put up with someone who would disrespect me or my mom’s memory.

He tried to hand me a cashier’s check for 15000 dollars. He said it wasn’t much but he wanted me to know he appreciated me and living with me and that he wanted to pay back some of what he owed. I refused the check both in part because I never wanted his money but I also don’t want to give any possible legal leg for him to stand on if this is somehow him trying to stay. I told him the first part and told him to put it towards a house.

He told me he is living with his sister but is going to look at houses with a realtor next week. He did say his son is asking about our next hang out date and said both me and my sister are welcome to arrange time with him.

After all of that my dad and cousin helped him get all the stuff out of the house that he owned (he had brought a U-Haul) and he gave me back my house keys. He apologized again and left.

Not what I expected. But it went really well and I feel a lot less like I let my mom down.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: I’m just being nosey, sure, but how did the woman who thought she’s getting you kicked out of your house respond to it all? 

>**OOP:** No clue. At my house she just seemed smug and bitchy. I didn’t ask Chuck about her and honestly don’t care. My house is nice but it’s not like it’s multimillion dollars or anything.

*OOP replies to a deleted comment:*

>All of the “he is coming for your house” comments on my post kind of made me paranoid. Much happier with how he handled things even if the check made me a little paranoid too.

Commenter (downvoted): Where did all the money your mom got come from? Was it an inheritance? And about how much did she get? Seems like a lot to buy so much.....

I’m just sitting here eating leftovers. I was up all night contemplating calling 911. I wasn’t feeling well. I told them and they didn’t listen to me. They were too busy taking care of addicts to listen to me. It was extremely frustrating. I called and they grabbed the phone from my hands. 

Everyone used me, so now it’s time for everyone to come clean about what they did. They weren’t smart enough. He stalked me for his own personal reasons. It had nothing to do with helping me. He kept me here. I wanted nothing to do with him. 

Do you have any Valentine’s Day plans? I don’t know if you have a SO. I figured I’d maybe splurge and get something special for myself. Maybe a dessert. Do you like cheesecake? I make really good desserts if you didn’t know. It was kind of my thing. 

When he “took” me, I refused to talk to him after that. I was so badly tortured, there was no going back. No one came to check on me for 6 months. I had no phone calls and no visitors. They didn’t speak to me. I was tortured at night. Just like here. It hasn’t mattered where I go. They do the same thing. 

I want a cigarette and a drink, but the religion monitors me. Even though I’m not part of it. Do you remember the breakfast place by the elementary school? They found out and don’t know the truth. They are assuming things because they’re stupid and completely incompetent. 

Do you workout? I try to do a little bit everyday even if I’m not feeling well. 

Do you remember the funeral procession? I do. 

Did you know my accuracy was amazing? I can’t remember how fast I could do it. Maybe a minute? I was always just one second behind. Did you know Hunter? I was almost as fast as Brian. Wouldn’t you know. I was 2nd to a boy. Go figure. Had to do a project with him, so I guess that was the start? 

I remember going when I was a kid, but I don’t remember when. 

They made me stop drinking coffee. It’s really hard for me to follow their rules when I’m not part of their group. Everything they have is because of me. 

Thinking about you. I should have went to get a pack of smokes. Do you ever smoke? 

Do you see your family often? I bet your family is pretty amazing. Mine was. I’d love to have a bonfire…

Her usual attire consisted of sneakers or flats paired with a suit or a simple button-down, followed by a six-hour shift behind a desk before finally indulging in a much-needed coffee break. But today was different.

Today, she was on assignment, and as a new journalist, this meant everything to her finally, a real story, a step toward building her career. A tiny buzz of excitement prickled beneath her calm exterior, but she kept it well hidden beneath a layer of practiced composure.

After all, it wasn’t exactly a heart-racing story: covering a charity gala. Nothing interesting ever happened at these events. All she had witnessed at similar gatherings were brooding rich men with their big bellies and low-toned conversations, shaking hands and making underhanded deals that had little to do with the charities they professed to support.

Not that she was one to judge openly. Isabel didn’t like people who wore their judgments too easily, and she certainly wasn’t one to broadcast her opinions. Her job was simply to cover the event, to observe and document without letting her personal feelings cloud her report.

Since then I have bought at least 20-30 pints of this stuff and gave most all of it away to friends, neighbors, and even strangers to try.  All the feedback I have gotten has been nothing less than spectacular.  One person said it was good (not great).    

I have been a walking Van Leeuwen ambassador ever since as I run into people all the time at the grocery store ice cream isle looking for an interesting flavor to try- so I usually pop in and let them know this is the best flavor with the wow-factor.  Most people appreciate the feedback and usually give it a try. I find that only 20% of them know Van Leeuwen.  I recently gave one to a new neighbor in our building, and yesterday she saw me and thank me profusely for hitting the jackpot.  Her fiancé ended up making a late run to the store to buy 4 pints!

Try, even at the most elementary level, to imagine life as a Black American in the 1950s and 1960s. They were 100 years removed from chattel slavery. [Jim Crow laws](https://www.britannica.com/event/Jim-Crow-law) kept them segregated in schools, businesses, public spaces, and transportation.

Separate, unequal, and enforced through violence.

[Bloody Sunday, 1965 – 600 marchers were attacked by Alabama state troopers, sheriff’s deputies, and a citizen posse. They were beaten with clubs and bullwhips and sprayed with tear gas.](https://preview.redd.it/f4inypuvcuhe1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=09e9f4f663125b1af2b4faa1a17da77354485b83)

Voter suppression was everywhere. Today it looks like gerrymandering, voter ID laws, and purging voter rolls. Back then it was poll taxes, literacy tests, and mobs waiting outside polling places.

During [Freedom Summer in 1964](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/freedomsummer/), Black and white activists, mostly college students, risked their lives to register Black voters in Mississippi. Many were beaten, some were murdered, and the KKK bombed churches in retaliation.

[1963 - Alabama fire department aims high-pressure water hoses at civil rights demonstrators.](https://preview.redd.it/1vkszwjncuhe1.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9c711cd753d1ed4fc0797016e850e3f8bd085e15)

In 1962, [Fannie Lou Hamer](https://www.womenshistory.org/resources/general/freedom-summer) was fired from her job and evicted from her home just for attempting to register to vote. In 1963, she and other activists were arrested in Mississippi after attending a voter education workshop. Police beat her nearly to death, leaving her with permanent kidney damage and a limp.

People will tell you this era wasn't so bad. But we know it wasn't a crazy old uncle shouting slurs from his porch. It was the Ku Klux Klan riding through towns, burning crosses and homes, bombing churches, and hanging bodies from trees.

The law protected this. Judges, governors, police chiefs, etc. Many were active participants in racial terrorism. Many looked the other way.

There are too many stories like these. I could talk endlessly about children, teens, and adults who were abused and murdered by state-sanctioned white supremacy.

I could talk about [Redlining](https://www.britannica.com/topic/redlining), and how the federal government explicitly mapped out Black neighborhoods as “high risk” for home loans. That still impacts wealth disparities today. I could talk about [The Green Book](https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Green-Book-travel-guide), a survival guide listing businesses that served Black travelers and warned them of sundown towns.

[Little Rock Nine on their third attempt to desegregate an Arkansas high school. The governor ordered the National Guard to block them the first time. The second time, an angry mob turned them away. These are teenagers. Imagine facing this every day just to go to school.](https://preview.redd.it/10vqrd1efuhe1.png?width=1300&format=png&auto=webp&s=6200742270aa42bf9be6aefe3a450f6f0b66110e)

I could talk about the [lunch counter sit-ins](https://www.britannica.com/event/sit-in-movement). Black and white students sat in “Whites Only” sections, refusing to leave. They endured beatings, coffee thrown in their faces, and mass arrests.

But Fannie Lou Hamer went on to testify on national television about the violence she faced for trying to vote. Even though [President Lyndon B. Johnson interrupted the broadcast](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/freedomsummer-hamer-testimony/), the speech still spread across the country.

Progress didn't just happen. People made it happen. That’s why giving in to nihilism and despair is a luxury. Marginalized communities have never had the option to quit, but history proves that when we fight, we win, even if it's not always immediately, not always completely. But it's been enough to push the world forward.

[Demonstrators rallying against employment inequality in Louisiana.](https://preview.redd.it/zul1wo8jfuhe1.jpg?width=2171&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=355cf6048f843b6eae2793fb2a848d8ced5a2e45)

Have you heard of the [Montgomery Bus Boycott](https://www.britannica.com/event/Montgomery-bus-boycott)? Black riders made up 75% of Montgomery’s bus system. For 381 days, they refused to ride. They walked, built carpools, and organized mutual aid. Police arrested them, bombed their homes, and harassed them just for walking instead of taking the bus. The boycott crippled Montgomery’s transit system and led directly to the end of segregation on public buses.

Have you heard of the [Freedom Riders](https://www.britannica.com/event/Freedom-Rides)? Young Black and white activists boarded interstate buses in the South to test whether states were following Supreme Court rulings against segregation. They weren’t, and the federal government wasn’t enforcing the law. The Freedom Riders were beaten, firebombed, and arrested. Local and state authorities often either participated in the violence or stood aside while white mobs brutalized them.

But it was broadcast on national and international news. Public opinion shifted so much that it eventually forced the federal government to step in and do something about it.

They demonstrated the power of nonviolent direct action. They also trained activists who went on to fight in major future civil rights battles.

Did you know MLK’s “I Have a Dream” speech was delivered at a march organized by an openly gay Black man? [Bayard Rustin](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Bayard-Rustin) helped bring over 250,000 people to the Lincoln Memorial for one of the largest political rallies in U.S. history.

Anxiety around democracy’s fragility is real. Trump and his allies have spent years stacking the courts, hoarding executive power, and eroding trust in democratic processes. The Supreme Court is an unchecked nightmare. Voter suppression is escalating. Disinformation is flooding the country. It feels rigged beyond repair.

But please, *please* remember that during the Civil Rights Movement, nearly **everybody in power** was openly, explicitly, and utterly against Black Americans. Presidents. Courts. Police. Lawmakers. The law often, prevailingly, and for decades did not matter.

[Another image from Bloody Sunday when state law enforcement officials attacked protestors.](https://preview.redd.it/gx0utcq2juhe1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2eeddcfd91f9985bea315eda6638bfdd55d88e48)

For every inch of progress, systems of power have fought back. White supremacy has adapted. The same forces that upheld segregation found new ways to exclude, suppress, and control. 

What we’re seeing now—the attack on DEI, the gutting of voting rights, the rollback of protections—isn’t new. It’s the latest evolution of the same resistance to justice. The strategies change, but the intent remains: to keep power in the hands of the few at the expense of the many.

The Civil Rights Act didn’t erase racism. The Voting Rights Act didn’t make elections fair. But they exist, they help, they matter, and they were won in worse conditions.

[1964 - Protestors outside a real estate office in Seattle, Washington](https://preview.redd.it/rrzq8ohcjuhe1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d5460d611f26a969b21a790f75328d8ec68a16e0)

The authoritarian speed run is happening, but so is resistance. I'm not arguing whether democracy is on the verge of becoming completely unrecognizable. That's not the question. The question is: will what we've fought for survive in a meaningful way? **That battle isn't decided.**

Entrenched power is not unbeatable, and what we are facing now is not insurmountable. You will hear people say it is, and you will see people give up. But mutual aid, organizing, and protests still work.

[The Black Panther Party built self-sufficient Black communities, providing free breakfast programs, health clinics, education initiatives, and legal, armed self-defense against racist violence.](https://preview.redd.it/zzy8df5w3uhe1.jpg?width=962&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0fda192f00b68b48b7c19a4e7ed3c7d2670fb705)

The *tools*—boycotts, legal battles, mass mobilization—still work. Black Americans used them and ultimately redefined democracy as we know it. The Movement for Black Lives, Indigenous water protectors, labor unions, etc., are direct descendants of Civil Rights-era organizing. LGBTQ+ rights, women's rights, disability rights, and more have the Black Civil Rights movements to thank.

If the worst happens, we can redefine democracy again. Sustained resistance, economic pressure, legal challenges, and mass mobilization *forces change*, even in the face of state-backed resistance and extreme violence. Thank God we are not there yet.

The difference between acknowledging the danger and surrendering to despair is recognizing that people have fought—and won—against *far worse* than our current state of affairs. If power only moved in one direction, we’d still be living under monarchy. Change happens through cycles of progress and retrenchment, not always in a straight line because **democracy is not a fixed state, it's a constant fight.**

Having tried various health products over the years with mixed results, I wasn’t sure if this would truly stand out. After using Liv Pure consistently for three months, I feel confident sharing my detailed experience, highlighting its benefits, challenges, and overall effectiveness.

# Why I Chose Liv Pure​

The premise of Liv Pure resonated with me. The idea that liver health plays a crucial role in weight management wasn’t new, but Liv Pure’s dual-action approach intrigued me. The supplement promised not just to detoxify the liver but also to enhance fat-burning processes, all while being made from natural ingredients like milk thistle, acai, and other plant-based extracts. With glowing online reviews and a growing reputation in the wellness community, I decided to give it a shot.  
​

# First Impressions​

From the start, Liv Pure impressed me with its professional presentation. The packaging was sleek and secure, and the product information was clear and easy to understand. The capsules were standard-sized, making them easy to swallow, and there was no unpleasant aftertaste—something I’ve encountered with other supplements. The instructions recommended taking two capsules daily with water, preferably with a meal, so I incorporated it into my morning routine for consistency.  
​

# The First Month: Detox and Adjustments​

During the first few weeks, I noticed subtle changes. Liv Pure’s liver detoxification properties seemed to kick in quickly. I felt lighter, and there was a noticeable improvement in my digestion. I used to experience occasional bloating, but this subsided significantly after starting the supplement.

What truly surprised me was the gradual increase in my energy levels. By the end of the first month, I wasn’t relying on my usual midday coffee to get through the afternoon. I also felt more motivated to stick to a healthy diet and exercise routine, which complemented the supplement’s effects.  
​

# Month Two: Visible Changes​

As I moved into the second month, the weight loss benefits became more noticeable. I had lost about 6 pounds by the end of this period, and my clothes started fitting better. While I wouldn’t call this a miracle transformation, it was evident that Liv Pure was helping my body burn fat more efficiently.

What I appreciated most was the balanced approach of the supplement. Unlike some weight loss products that can feel overly aggressive, Liv Pure’s effects were steady and sustainable. I also felt a stronger sense of overall well-being, which I attribute to the supplement’s liver-supporting ingredients.

# Month Three: Long-Term Benefits​

By the third month, the results were undeniable. I had lost a total of 12 pounds, and my energy levels were at an all-time high. I felt more active and less fatigued, even after long days at work. My skin also appeared clearer, which I believe is a byproduct of improved liver health.

One unexpected benefit was the impact on my mood. Liv Pure’s natural composition seemed to contribute to better mental clarity and reduced stress levels. Whether this was due to the supplement itself or the confidence boost from feeling healthier, I can’t say for sure—but the overall effect was remarkable.  
​

# Key Features I Loved​

* **Natural Ingredients**: Knowing that Liv Pure was made with natural components like acai and milk thistle gave me peace of mind. These ingredients are well-known for their detoxifying and antioxidant properties, and they seemed to work harmoniously in this formula.​
* **Ease of Use**: Taking two capsules a day was simple and didn’t feel like a chore. The absence of side effects made it easy to incorporate into my daily routine.​
* **Holistic Benefits**: Beyond weight loss, I noticed improvements in digestion, energy levels, and overall vitality.​
* **Science-Backed Approach**: The dual-action mechanism of supporting liver health while boosting metabolism felt grounded in science, which gave me confidence in the product.​

# Challenges​

While my experience with Liv Pure was overwhelmingly positive, there are a few aspects worth noting:  
​

1. **Results May Vary**: My husband also tried Liv Pure, but his results were slower. While he did experience better energy levels, his weight loss wasn’t as pronounced. This underscores that individual results can vary depending on factors like metabolism and lifestyle.​
2. **Availability**: Liv Pure is only available online, which might be inconvenient for those who prefer in-store purchases. Additionally, it’s important to purchase from the official website to avoid counterfeit products.​
3. **Cost**: While I found the price reasonable for the benefits I received, it might be on the higher side for some. However, the multi-bottle discounts and occasional promotions help offset the cost.​

# Comparison with Other Products​

Before trying Liv Pure, I had experimented with other liver detox and weight loss supplements, but none delivered the same comprehensive benefits. Many products focus solely on weight loss, often ignoring the role of liver health. Liv Pure’s unique approach to addressing both aspects felt more holistic and effective.

# FAQs​

**Does Liv Pure work?**  
Based on my experience, yes. However, combining it with a healthy lifestyle is essential to maximize results.

**Is it safe to use?**  
I experienced no adverse effects during my three-month journey. The natural ingredients and absence of harmful additives made it a safe choice for me.

**How long does it take to see results?**  
I noticed subtle changes within the first month, with more significant results by the second month.

**Can it be used with other medications?**  
It’s always best to consult with a healthcare provider before starting any supplement, especially if you’re taking other medications.  
​

# Final Thoughts​

Liv Pure exceeded my expectations as a liver detox and weight loss supplement. It didn’t just help me shed pounds but also improved my overall health and energy levels. While individual results may vary, I believe this product offers a natural, sustainable way to support both liver health and weight management. For those looking to invest in their wellness journey, Liv Pure is a compelling option.​",1,1738990398.0,OKRABLEACH,0,1.0,False

If you’re looking for the best home alarm systems, I gotta say, I’m officially a convert after trying out the [Ring Alarm 14-Piece Kit.](https://amzn.to/3Ex4CL1) Not only does it make me feel like a superhero protecting my castle, but it’s also surprisingly easy to set up. Like, way easier than setting up your Wi-Fi (which, let’s be honest, can sometimes feel like trying to understand quantum physics).

# The Setup: Quick and Painless

I won’t lie, I was a little intimidated at first. I’ve avoided smart home gadgets for years. But when I unboxed the Ring Alarm Kit, I felt like a tech genius. The pieces snapped together like puzzle pieces—seriously, if I can do it, anyone can. You just download the app, plug in the base station, and the system walks you through setting everything up.

And just for context, I’ve got two dogs who bark at the air when the wind blows, so I was ready for the inevitable “woof woof woof” sound when I tested the motion detectors. Turns out, the motion sensors are smart enough not to pick up on my dogs' antics. They’ve only activated when I’ve been the one being a little too sneaky (looking at you, late-night snack runs).

# Features that Actually Work

Now, let’s talk features. First, the **contact sensors** on windows and doors are a game changer. I live in a quirky old house with a million weirdly shaped windows that could easily be left ajar without me noticing. The Ring system made sure I didn’t forget to secure any of them.

The **keypad**—which by the way, has a sleek design that doesn't look like it was plucked from a 1995 sci-fi movie—is easy to use. I especially love the **Siren**. The first time it went off (thanks to me forgetting to disable it after setting up a motion sensor), I felt like I was in an action movie. Like, I half-expected Bruce Willis to pop out of my closet and start giving me a high-five.

Also, I’m not one for tech support calls (who is?), but the app walks you through everything. I’m a firm believer that if a system can be set up while watching Netflix on the couch, then it’s a win.

**BTW I Got Mine For Really Cheap** [**HERE**](https://amzn.to/3Ex4CL1)

# Real-Life Example: The 3 AM Panic Attack

I’m not exaggerating when I say this: the first time I left my house and forgot to activate the alarm, my paranoia kicked in at about 3 AM. You know that feeling? Like, ""Did I lock the door?"" I pulled up the Ring app from my bed and checked the status. Everything was secure. I could almost hear a soothing voice saying, ""It's cool, relax, you're safe."" Honestly, that moment made me feel like I’m living in the future.

# Overall Thoughts

I’ve been using the [Ring Alarm 14-Piece Kit](https://amzn.to/3Ex4CL1) for a couple of weeks now, and it’s truly been one of my best investments for peace of mind. It’s affordable, effective, and integrates seamlessly into my smart home setup (even my Alexa gives it a thumbs up). If you’re looking for the **best home alarm systems**, this one ticks all the boxes.

No more worrying about whether you left the door unlocked or if that random sound in the middle of the night is a burglar or your overactive imagination. With the Ring Alarm, I’m confident my home is secure—even if I’m too lazy to leave my couch.

# TL;DR:

* **Ease of setup**: 10/10, I felt like a tech genius
* **Features**: 10/10, every little piece is actually useful
* **Peace of mind**: 11/10, I actually sleep better now

If you’re in the market for a solid home security system, the Ring Alarm 14-Piece Kit is definitely worth considering. It’s like having a security guard who doesn’t need coffee breaks.

1ikfdly,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsreviewed/comments/1ikfdly/my_best_coffee_makers/,MY Best Coffee Makers,"Okay, folks, I’ve officially found the *best* coffee maker. You know how people say they can’t function without coffee? Well, I didn’t realize how much I was *not* functioning until I tried the [L'OR Barista System Coffee and Espresso Machine.](https://amzn.to/3WQTT4v) If you’ve ever found yourself standing in front of a sad coffee pot in the morning, staring blankly at the ground, wondering why it’s taking so long to brew your cup of motivation... this is the machine that’ll save you from your caffeine crisis.

First off, let’s talk about the **design**. This isn’t just a coffee maker. It’s like if a *high-end espresso machine* and a *fancy coffee shop* had a baby, and it was gifted with a sleek, modern aesthetic. It’s got this minimalistic yet elegant look that doesn’t scream “I need a counter space the size of a kitchen island.” Nope. This machine sits pretty, taking up just enough room to make you feel *classy* without dominating your kitchen.

Now, let’s talk about **functionality**. You can make **both coffee and espresso** (yes, you heard me), which means I no longer need to play bartender when I have friends over. I don’t know if you’ve ever had a guest ask you for an espresso *and* a regular coffee, but let me tell you, it’s a little bit like juggling knives. With the L'OR Barista, it’s all good – one machine, both drinks. Game-changer.

Here's the kicker though: The **double-shot** feature. Let me paint a picture. I woke up late one day, rushed out of bed, and had exactly 7 minutes to get out the door. Normally, this would be a disaster. But with this machine, I hit the button, and boom – two shots of espresso in a flash. It was so smooth, I actually *tasted* the espresso instead of just inhaling it out of desperation.

**BTW I Got Mine For Really Cheap** [**HERE**](https://amzn.to/3WQTT4v)

But wait, there’s more. The **taste**? Honestly, I’m not exaggerating when I say it’s like being transported to a café in Italy. I swear I can hear the soft hum of an espresso machine in the background whenever I take my first sip. That rich, deep flavor. It’s a *hug in a mug*, people.

And here’s the kicker: It’s perfect for those of us who aren’t exactly coffee experts. I used to be the kind of person who thought “espresso” was just a fancier way to say “coffee but tiny.” But with the L'OR Barista, it’s simple – pop in the pod, choose your drink, and let the machine do the work. No need to grind beans like I’m some sort of barista apprentice.

In conclusion, if you’re looking for the [best coffee maker](https://amzn.to/3WQTT4v) that can deliver both coffee and espresso with convenience, speed, and incredible taste, look no further than the L'OR Barista System Coffee and Espresso Machine. It’s not just a coffee maker. It’s a lifestyle upgrade. Trust me, once you go L'OR, you’ll never go back to the sad, burnt coffee you’ve been tolerating.

I’ve always been the kid blessed with strong will, and athletic body. Ive dreamed of being one of the greatest players to make myself proud. Yet i was born poor, and my family don’t support me fully, because what they wanted for me is to have good grades, and an achiever in class. And yes, they cant pay much and buy me the accessories i needed to compete in a much higher sport competition.

it all started when i was G1, i joined the track and field and won as the representative of out public school. im confident that im fast and have a strong legs but every district meet lagi ako natatalo kase puro g6 nakakatapat ko sa 100m dash. pero nag patuloy ako until g6 and naka abot ako hanggang unit meet. at that time, walang nag s support sakin except for my coach(teacher) and babae pa sha so she doesn’t know how to teach and cosch me how to win the race. im also just using a sneaker that i used since g3. ung mga kalaban ko naka spike shoes which is appropriate sa field. for all the time na binigay sakin para makapag train sa unit meet ay sobrang limited lang. all i do everyday is jog, and intensity workout.
yet I LOST because my opponents have better equipments than me.

While in pandemic, i had another vision for my athleticism, and that is badminton. kase since i was kid too, me and my cousins always play badminton in the street. and i have skills, and talent for that sport. i knew that its the perfect sport for me. from 1st year to 4th year of HS, walang intrams or district meet samin. kaya puro laro laro lang ginagawa namin with my cousins. we knew how to play the game well, smashes, backshots, drops, serving, and footworks. i’ve learned the fundamentals kaka laro lang sa streets while watching yt tutorials. my rackets are just borrowed from my friend kase 5k ang original yonex na racket , while the shuttlecocks are just used one na sira sira na feathers.

skipping to the good part…

Nung sumampa ako ng shs, i decided to let it all out. i beg for my teachers to train me badminton because i only have 2 years to prove my potentials. they had a program nung sem break kase wala paring district meet nung 2023, i beg my mom also to pay 1,400 to train me sa program. and ung racket na gamit ko is second hand lang but its original. It lasted a month and its worth the money, my skills are honed, and i improved my footworks, i keep training inside the school hanggang sumampa ako ng g12 , at that moment i fully neglected my school works and grades, but i never cared because im locked in. nag work ako ng part time sa coffee shop, to pay for entrances fee sa near court ng badminton, and i met alot of friends and companions along. i was at my peak. but it was never enough. i could’ve been better if i can afford better accessories and family supports. i knew that my peak moment is just the limit i can do with my social status as poor. nakikita ko ung mga actual players sa court na they play well because they have money to pay for better coaches and equipment. nag train ako everyday and home workout to achieve my best. pero everything is not enough. dumating na ung punto na nasa district meet na ako when i was g12. im super confident na mananalo ko lahat ng laban ko. yet nung semi finals, i find myself alone, helpless with no coach supporting me. while my opponent have his families and school fully supporting him. its the final set and wala nag a advice sakin. in my mind i keep telling myself that i could’ve been better if i have money and better status pero andon lang talaga ung limit ko as a poor student with no family support. at the end natalo ako and it was the last string of my ever holding will of being the greatest. humagulgol ako kase it’s all for nothing. g graduate ako nang walang napuntahan. i cried to myself, blaming all to my family and the school who never trained me enough even tho i showed them how much potentials i can give them. i was lost, and after that tournament, nawalan nako nang gana mag laro, i left everything behind. i didn’t enrolled for  college because i lost all hope, and just pursue a job. which im currently am right now. (19M) working as a barista in a local cafe. ive been depressed after that and started smoking which i swore not to use because im an athlete. i also done drugs, and rebel to my family. had my face pierced and tattooed. 

in the end, i quit. now im just an empty shell with no ambition at all.",4,1738990071.0,OffMyChestPH,3,1.0,False

The only thing I didn't do was my husband's paperwork. I did his hobbies corner and spent so much mental energy being as meticulous as possible. 

And to be clear, I wasn't trying to avoid him being angry or abusive or anything even remotely like that. I just really, really wanted his pile of chaos to be sorted out in a way that made sense for him. 

And then he got home from work and just sat there looking at the things that still needed to be done like he genuinely didn't understand that the toaster needed to go in a box. 

I was just so burnt out and I needed to keep going, so I had a coffee at 7:30, even though I definitely know better, and now he's peacefully snoring next to me and I don't think I'll ever sleep again.

1ikf3m4,https://www.reddit.com/r/unOrdinary/comments/1ikf3m4/the_parallels_and_foils_between_jera_and_jam/,The parallels and foils between Jera and Jam,"Back on my Jera posts but what can yall expect from user jeraheart? Anyway though, from the small amount of Jam content we got, they share alot in common with Jera so I wanted to make this. 

**1. Books**

The reason Jane and William met and started to get closer was because of a book signing. Jane already had knowledge on William obviously because he is her favourite author. 

[Chapter 299](https://preview.redd.it/27g3gvsq1uhe1.png?width=797&format=png&auto=webp&s=a60269bedd6bd4dc1a8ba9e4503fa97196c63290)

Compared to John and Sera, the reason they got close in the first place was because of a book report. These two knew each other before being assigned partners but because of this project they started to get to know each other.

[Chapter 36](https://preview.redd.it/5vh0oxa92uhe1.png?width=797&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b58138baafdbb78697d44a5cc78aa28cbd59ff3)

Books was the starting point of both ships getting to know each other outside of what they already know and building up a bond from then.

**2. Cake**

After getting his signature, Jane asked William out for a coffee date and they ended up sharing a piece of chocolate cake.

[Chapter 299](https://preview.redd.it/tverrrcz3uhe1.png?width=657&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed0ea9dae115ac4ff9dcd58376617b71f6406f80)

Meanwhile, John and Sera already disliked each other at this point and they ended up fighting/arguing over the cake.

[Chapter 20](https://preview.redd.it/w2kmvd4d4uhe1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=90d03b00cfd4df1c7ed40c61827cc07aa4492b47)

William and Jane already liked each other at that point and were happy to share a slice between them. However because Sera and John disliked each other, they wanted the slice for themselves.

**3. Communicating** 

When the Doe family were out on a walk, William asked Jane what's wrong but Jane was being vague and didn't communicate what's on her mind.

[Chapter 291](https://preview.redd.it/agz6nc7b6uhe1.png?width=555&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2f72340f91e07d2d1577620765edecfff5f3f9d)

And when Sera and John were walking after classes, Sera asked John what's wrong and John answered her that he felt like an idiot.

Don't both scenes look alot like the other? To me it does, from it starting with both ships walking to even mother and son getting the aware doodle popping up when Will and Sera got their attentions. The main difference though is Jane didn't tell William what was going on while John told Sera what's happening.

**4. Names**

It's obvious John was named after Jane with them being a masculine and feminine versions of each other, but both mother and son have someone with a longer name that they gave shortened form and became a nickname.

William and Seraphina

Will and Sera

**5. Levels**

Both guys with someone who has a higher level than them-

John: 7.6   Sera: 8.0

Will: 1.0     Jane: 9.1

(This point is for the current time in the story, but it can eventually change to ""Both Channel Master users with someone who has a lower level than them"")

**6. NXGen**

Both William and Sera were able to get info about Jane out of NXGen. Their methods weren't the same but they still managed to learn about her situation, with Will knowing about Jane herself and Sera learning about Jane capabilities and experiments 

**7. Father and Son**

When William was killed, he fell like this

[Chapter 319](https://preview.redd.it/t29q724jauhe1.png?width=796&format=png&auto=webp&s=1eb91b7d8b3e80265b2b169cbaa94ec773a09426)

And when John was knocked out, how did you think he fell? 

[Chapter 344](https://preview.redd.it/r5lmbqutauhe1.png?width=799&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a95dd68d110f935c299ef39f5b2573873845177)

Exactly the same, just like his dad

**8. Same words, different generations**

Once again when Jam first met, Will told her about him having no ability but Jane's response was this

[Chapter 299](https://preview.redd.it/ubz1r6tqbuhe1.png?width=652&format=png&auto=webp&s=582ae053abadfaf797c3b89df58b5737a1d023d7)

And when John was fighting Zeke and vented his frustration at him, he also said

https://preview.redd.it/ezuhd18ybuhe1.png?width=799&format=png&auto=webp&s=89faf8688c4c5752227ef8b7f5e477667ea488b9

Over 20 years after Jane said that, her own son repeated those words without even knowing his mom thought like that too

**9. Glare**

When John saw his uncle walking to his office, he looked up at his body like this

[S2 finale](https://preview.redd.it/phdw7nfpcuhe1.png?width=521&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3c8d834b3b33f325c0278f84a7a11486174c034)

And when Jane wanted to know what's going on with her husband and son, she looked at Dr. Calista like this

[S2 finale](https://preview.redd.it/gz6a1gz2duhe1.png?width=431&format=png&auto=webp&s=e69511e6c0ae401fdee48b89fcd1688989bda6c0)

~~John you look like your damn mama!~~

  
In conclusion: Jam and Jera have many parallels but I think their relationship as a whole are foils. Jam started their relationship with no bad blood and positivity already affecting them. They fell in love much faster (in their 20s) but sadly was separated from each other and they can never reunite now

Jera on the other hand started with bad blood but eventually soften up for the other, however they still had their own faults and secrets and even had a falling out. They were able to patch things up and falling in love much slower (teens) and even though they were separated many times, they always find their way each other again.

1ikf1fs,https://www.reddit.com/r/stayawake/comments/1ikf1fs/my_job_at_radio_station_in_the_night_shift_left/,My Job at Radio Station in the Night Shift Left Me A List of Strange RULES TO FOLLOW,"When I first got the job at VSRP, the local midnight radio station, I thought I had hit the jackpot of easy living. Sit in a creaky chair, play some records for a few night owls and insomniacs, maybe humor a couple of bored callers if I was in the mood. The pay? Not exactly dream-worthy, but enough to scrape by. Rent, groceries, and the occasional beer were all I needed. It was the kind of gig where you showed up half-asleep and left half-conscious, and I was fine with that.

The station itself was nothing to write home about. An old, peeling building squatted by a lonely rural highway, its silhouette swallowed by a thick canopy of looming trees. It carried a certain outdated charm—or maybe just the weight of abandonment. The walls inside were lined with wood paneling that had warped over the years, as if they were slowly sagging into a permanent shrug. The break room smelled faintly of mildew and cheap instant coffee, and the sagging couch there looked like it had been rescued from a junkyard decades ago. A flickering neon sign buzzed feebly above the front door, casting sickly pink light on the gravel lot. The equipment, a mismatched collection of knobs, dials, and cassette decks, was older than me—ancient in tech years—but it worked, albeit with the same reluctance as an aging horse forced to trot.

The man who hired me, Carl, had a wiry build and an unsettling nervous energy. His fingers twitched when he handed me the keys, and his eyes darted around the room like he was expecting something—or someone—to leap out of the shadows. “Here’s the rundown,” he muttered, barely meeting my gaze. His voice was as thin as his frame, trembling slightly. He gestured vaguely at the equipment, gave me a rushed tutorial on how to operate the aging machines, and then handed me a single piece of paper.

It was a list.

“Follow these exactly,” he said, his tone dropping an octave. “No exceptions.”

I laughed, thinking he was trying to spook me, leaning into the whole eerie late-night DJ vibe. But Carl didn’t laugh back. His expression hardened, his lips tightening as if my chuckle had offended him. He shoved the paper into my hand, his fingers gripping mine just a second too long. “I’m serious,” he hissed, his eyes boring into mine. “You mess this up, you’re not gonna like what happens.”

I unfolded the list, still half-expecting it to be a prank. But as I read the rules, an uneasy weight settled in my chest.

The rules were bizarre, borderline absurd:

* Play a jazz record at exactly 3:06 AM. It *must* be jazz. No exceptions.
* Never answer calls from Line 7. If it rings, let it ring.
* If you hear knocking on the studio door, check the security camera before opening it. If no one’s there, don’t open it.
* Do not play the same song twice in one night.
* If you hear static coming from the microphone when it’s off, turn off all the lights and sit quietly until it stops.

I wanted to roll my eyes and ask Carl if this was some kind of hazing ritual for new hires, but when I looked up, his face stopped me cold. His eyes were wide, pupils dilated, and a fine sheen of sweat glistened on his forehead. He looked... scared. Not nervous, not joking—*scared*.

That first night, I didn’t take any chances. I followed the rules, partly out of respect for the job but mostly because Carl’s reaction had rattled me more than I wanted to admit. The shift passed uneventfully. Line 7 stayed silent, the door stayed still, and the microphone didn’t so much as crackle. For a moment, I thought Carl had just been overly paranoid.

But then came the second night. And that’s when I got careless.

The first few hours of my shift were uneventful. I spun some classic rock—familiar tunes that made the graveyard hours feel less lonely. A couple of bored night owls called in to chat, their voices crackling with the kind of late-night aimlessness that only comes with insomnia. I read a few ad scripts, stumbling slightly over one for a discount furniture store, and chuckled to myself as I imagined who could possibly be listening at this hour. It was all routine, quiet, mundane.

Then, as the clock inched closer to 3:00 AM, I remembered Carl’s jazz rule. My stomach did a little flip, a combination of annoyance and unease. I’d almost forgotten. Grumbling under my breath, I began rifling through the station’s dusty stacks of vinyl, my fingers brushing against worn, paper-thin sleeves. Most of the records were decades old, their covers faded and stained, smelling faintly of mildew and neglect. Finally, I found an old Miles Davis album. The sleeve was tattered, the vinyl scratched, but it would do. I slid it onto the turntable and set it up, waiting for the clock to tick to 3:06.

When the second hand struck the mark, I dropped the needle onto the record. The warm, honeyed sound of the trumpet poured out of the speakers, filling the studio with smooth, soulful energy. I leaned back in my chair, letting out a satisfied breath. *Good job*, I thought. I’d remembered. No mistakes tonight.

But as the music played, something started to feel... off. At first, it was subtle—just a faint noise, barely noticeable beneath the melody. I dismissed it as static or the wear of the old vinyl. But the longer I listened, the more it seemed like something else. Like a whisper.

I leaned forward, my ear closer to the monitor, trying to make out the sound. My skin prickled. The whisper wasn’t random—it had a rhythm, a cadence, like someone muttering just below the surface of the music. My pulse quickened, and I turned up the volume slightly, straining to catch it. The whisper grew louder, more distinct, until it wasn’t a whisper anymore. It was a voice. Low, raspy, and... wrong.

“Don’t stop,” it said.

I froze, my breath caught in my throat. My eyes flicked to the microphone. The red light was off. It wasn’t live. The voice wasn’t coming from me.

My heart pounded against my ribs as I stared at the speakers, hoping, *praying*, that I was imagining things. But then it came again, clearer this time.

“Don’t stop the music.”

I shot out of my chair, panic surging through me. My hands trembled as I stopped the record, the needle screeching as it lifted from the vinyl. The voice cut off instantly. The studio was silent—so silent that the hum of the old fluorescent light above me sounded deafening.

I stood there, frozen, trying to catch my breath. I glanced at the clock. My stomach dropped.

3:10 AM. Four minutes late.

A wave of dread washed over me. My fingers gripped the edge of the console as Carl’s warning echoed in my mind. *You’re not gonna like what happens.*

The phone rang.

Not just any phone—Line 7.

The shrill, electronic cry cut through the suffocating silence, sharp and jarring. I flinched, my heart slamming against my ribs. My eyes locked on the blinking red light of the forbidden line, and my stomach churned. Carl’s words pounded in my head: *Never answer calls from Line 7.*

It rang again.

And again.

Each ring seemed to grow louder, more piercing, like the sound itself was burrowing into my skull. My hands trembled as I took an instinctive step back from the desk, bumping into the chair behind me. The room felt colder, darker. The air was thick, heavy, like the walls themselves were closing in.

The ringing didn’t stop.

It kept going. Louder and louder, more shrill with every chime, until it felt like the entire building was vibrating with it. I clapped my hands over my ears, desperate to block out the sound, and squeezed my eyes shut, my breaths coming in ragged, shallow gasps.

And then, as suddenly as it had started, it stopped.

Silence.

I opened my eyes—and froze.

The studio was pitch black. Every light—the overhead fluorescents, the control panel, even the flickering neon sign outside—was out. The soft hum of electricity that I hadn’t even realized I’d been hearing was gone, swallowed up by the darkness. The world outside the windows was nothing but an impenetrable void.

I couldn’t move. Couldn’t breathe.

Then I heard it.

Knocking.

At first, it was barely there. A soft, rhythmic tapping on the studio door, so faint I almost convinced myself it was my imagination.

*Check the security camera before opening it.* Carl’s rule came rushing back to me.

My fingers fumbled across the desk, searching blindly in the darkness for the monitor switch. I found it and flipped it on with trembling hands. The screen flickered to life, casting a pale, ghostly glow over the room.

The hallway outside the studio came into view. The grainy black-and-white feed showed nothing but the empty corridor stretching out into the shadows.

The knocking came again, louder this time.

“Who’s there?” I croaked, my voice thin and cracking with fear.

No answer.

The camera feed remained empty. The hallway was still and lifeless, but the sound of knocking persisted. It grew sharper, more urgent, each blow reverberating through the studio walls.

Bang.

Bang.

Bang.

It wasn’t a polite knock anymore. It was angry, violent, as if someone—or *something*—was trying to force its way inside. My legs buckled, and I stumbled back, clutching the crumpled list of rules in my hand like it was a lifeline, as though it might somehow shield me from whatever was out there.

And then, just as quickly as it had begun, the banging stopped.

Silence fell over the studio once more.

But it wasn’t the comforting kind of silence. It was oppressive, unnatural, a void that pressed against my ears and made my chest feel tight. The absence of noise was worse than the sound itself.

I stood frozen, every muscle locked, my ears straining against the suffocating quiet, waiting for what would come next.

I sat there, folded into myself, knees pressed tightly to my chest like they were the only thing holding me together. The studio felt like a tomb, and I was its reluctant occupant. Every sound—the groaning of the building settling, the faint whispers of the wind through the trees—felt magnified, sinister. My eyes darted around the blackened room, searching for threats I couldn’t see.

And then it came.

The static.

It started softly, around 4:00 AM, a faint crackle that barely broke the suffocating silence. I froze, my blood turning to ice. It was coming from the microphone. The one I knew for a fact was off—I’d switched it off hours ago. But there it was, alive with that eerie, unnatural hiss.

At first, I tried to convince myself it was just a malfunction, maybe interference from the storm clouds gathering outside. But deep down, I knew better.

The static grew louder, its pitch shifting in a way that made the hair on the back of my neck stand on end. I stared at the mic, its lifeless red light mocking me. My breath quickened.

Then the voice came.

“Why didn’t you follow the rules?”

It was the same voice I’d heard earlier, low and grating, but now there was venom in it, an unfiltered fury that made my stomach churn.

I scrambled to the control panel, my hands shaking as I tried to shut it down. I jabbed at the buttons, twisted the knobs, yanked at wires. Nothing worked. The microphone seemed alive, immune to my desperation.

The voice came again, louder this time.

“Why didn’t you follow the rules?”

Each word seemed to stab into my mind, echoing and expanding until it was all I could hear. The static swelled, its relentless buzz filling the room like a flood, drowning out my thoughts, my heartbeat, everything.

“Why didn’t you follow the rules?”

It wasn’t just coming from the speakers anymore. It was *everywhere*—the walls, the floor, the air itself. It burrowed into my head, reverberating like a thunderclap inside my skull. My hands flew to my ears, but it didn’t help. The sound was already in me.

I screamed, the raw sound ripping from my throat, but it was swallowed up by the cacophony. The static surged, a deafening roar that left no room for anything else.

And then—

Silence.

It stopped.

The sudden quiet was like a slap, almost more jarring than the noise had been. My ears rang, my body trembling as I stared at the microphone, now dormant, as if nothing had happened.

But I knew better. Something had changed. Something was watching. Waiting.

The lights flickered back on, weak and hesitant at first, before fully flooding the studio with their dull, buzzing glow. It felt unnatural, like the building itself had been holding its breath and now, reluctantly, was letting it out. I blinked against the sudden brightness, my vision adjusting, and for a moment, it was like waking up from a nightmare I wasn’t entirely sure was over.

The clock on the wall ticked steadily, its hands resting on 6:00 AM. My shift was over. The night that had stretched on for what felt like an eternity had finally given way to morning. But the usual relief—the kind that comes with punching out and heading home—was nowhere to be found. All I felt was exhaustion, fear, and the weight of something unseen pressing down on me.

My legs wobbled as I stood, the journey from the studio to the parking lot feeling longer than it ever should. The crisp morning air hit me like a shock, but it wasn’t refreshing. It was cold and indifferent, a harsh reminder that the world outside had gone on, oblivious to whatever horror lurked within that studio.

Carl was waiting in the parking lot, leaning against his battered old sedan. His face was pale, drawn tight with a weariness that looked permanent, like someone who had seen too much and didn’t bother trying to forget anymore. His eyes locked onto mine, and in that moment, I knew he didn’t need to ask. He could see it written all over me.

“You broke the rules, didn’t you?” His voice was soft, but there was no sympathy in it. Just resignation.

I nodded, my throat too dry to form words.

Carl sighed heavily, like a man carrying a burden that was never truly his but one he had resigned himself to bear. From his pocket, he pulled out a folded sheet of paper, edges worn and smudged with fingerprints. He handed it to me without a word.

I unfolded it with trembling hands. A new list. Different rules. Stricter. Stranger.

“Next time,” Carl said, his tone as serious as a funeral, “do exactly what it says. Or you won’t make it to the morning.”

His words hung in the air, chilling and absolute. I wanted to ask him what “it” was, what exactly haunted the studio during those suffocating midnight hours. But the look in his eyes silenced me. I didn’t want to know. Not really.

Carl climbed into his car and drove off, leaving me alone in the parking lot. The paper in my hand felt heavier than it should, like it carried the weight of some dark truth I was now bound to.

I still don’t know what’s out there, what claws at the edges of the station during those cursed hours. But I’ve learned one thing, burned into my mind like a brand: the rules aren’t suggestions. They’re not some quirky manual written by a paranoid ex-employee. They’re a lifeline. The only thing standing between me and whatever waits in the shadows.

Every time I clock in now, I read the list. Over and over. I memorize every line, every rule, as if my life depends on it. Because it does. I don’t question them. I don’t get curious.

Curiosity is what killed the last guy. I never met him, but I see the name scratched into the desk, carved by a trembling hand.

Because the moment you stop following the rules?

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1ikeub2,https://www.reddit.com/r/workplace_bullying/comments/1ikeub2/my_current_workplace_is_full_of_snakes/,My current workplace is full of snakes.,"I work at a food and beverage venue and it's mainly 1 person per shift, running the small coffee shop and stuff. It's been slow and everyone gets 2-3 days. I went from 40 hours to 18 hours and since I live in California, I have to finish all of my work within 6 hours. 

Despite being slow, it can still get busy when 1 person is running everything. I am kind and inviting and I realized it is my weakness. I don't say no. I try to please everyone to have a good time at work. I am friendly and playful. I make coffee for many coworkers, even if they ask for a second or third one. Guess what, at the end of the day, they will still report me to management or HR over something. Acting all nice to my face, asking for free coffee or food, get nosy over my trips (I travel a lot) and joke with me like buddies but still report me. Had this lady who would nitpick something that wasn't finished and constantly tell management to make me look bad.

I have a boss that we have a very weird dynamic and tease each other and call each other names. He brought me to HR today immediately over those coworkers complaining because my workspace was a total mess from last night, nobody cared to set up anything and I only have like 30 mins to do so much. Some of those coworkers exaggerated that I was really angry and yeah, those are the workers who come to me every morning acting all sweet and acting entitled to get a latte. If I get busy, they will come to me all and ask me when is their latte, like I owe them one everyday. Anyways, I feel betrayed by my boss too, he was acting like a 'buddy' and he could have had a conversation with me before taking it to HR immediately. 

The sad reality is, all of these managers and other employees (from the night shift) are friends and hang out after work and drink and hook up. The manager from last night tried to defend himself and his buddies that they did everything. 

So yeah, quite tired of working at places like that. I worked at the bistro of a hotel before and same thing. Coworkers or people from the office would come to the bistro and ask for this and that and act all entitled. It's almost as if having some supervisor or manager position gives you the right to look down on people. ",1,1738988378.0,workplace_bullying,1,0.67,False

1ikerw2,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1ikerw2/my_job_at_radio_station_in_the_night_shift_left/,My Job at Radio Station in the Night Shift Left Me A List of Strange RULES TO,"When I first got the job at VSRP, the local midnight radio station, I thought I had hit the jackpot of easy living. Sit in a creaky chair, play some records for a few night owls and insomniacs, maybe humor a couple of bored callers if I was in the mood. The pay? Not exactly dream-worthy, but enough to scrape by. Rent, groceries, and the occasional beer were all I needed. It was the kind of gig where you showed up half-asleep and left half-conscious, and I was fine with that.

The station itself was nothing to write home about. An old, peeling building squatted by a lonely rural highway, its silhouette swallowed by a thick canopy of looming trees. It carried a certain outdated charm—or maybe just the weight of abandonment. The walls inside were lined with wood paneling that had warped over the years, as if they were slowly sagging into a permanent shrug. The break room smelled faintly of mildew and cheap instant coffee, and the sagging couch there looked like it had been rescued from a junkyard decades ago. A flickering neon sign buzzed feebly above the front door, casting sickly pink light on the gravel lot. The equipment, a mismatched collection of knobs, dials, and cassette decks, was older than me—ancient in tech years—but it worked, albeit with the same reluctance as an aging horse forced to trot.

The man who hired me, Carl, had a wiry build and an unsettling nervous energy. His fingers twitched when he handed me the keys, and his eyes darted around the room like he was expecting something—or someone—to leap out of the shadows. “Here’s the rundown,” he muttered, barely meeting my gaze. His voice was as thin as his frame, trembling slightly. He gestured vaguely at the equipment, gave me a rushed tutorial on how to operate the aging machines, and then handed me a single piece of paper.

It was a list.

“Follow these exactly,” he said, his tone dropping an octave. “No exceptions.”

I laughed, thinking he was trying to spook me, leaning into the whole eerie late-night DJ vibe. But Carl didn’t laugh back. His expression hardened, his lips tightening as if my chuckle had offended him. He shoved the paper into my hand, his fingers gripping mine just a second too long. “I’m serious,” he hissed, his eyes boring into mine. “You mess this up, you’re not gonna like what happens.”

I unfolded the list, still half-expecting it to be a prank. But as I read the rules, an uneasy weight settled in my chest.

The rules were bizarre, borderline absurd:

* Play a jazz record at exactly 3:06 AM. It *must* be jazz. No exceptions.
* Never answer calls from Line 7. If it rings, let it ring.
* If you hear knocking on the studio door, check the security camera before opening it. If no one’s there, don’t open it.
* Do not play the same song twice in one night.
* If you hear static coming from the microphone when it’s off, turn off all the lights and sit quietly until it stops.

I wanted to roll my eyes and ask Carl if this was some kind of hazing ritual for new hires, but when I looked up, his face stopped me cold. His eyes were wide, pupils dilated, and a fine sheen of sweat glistened on his forehead. He looked... scared. Not nervous, not joking—*scared*.

That first night, I didn’t take any chances. I followed the rules, partly out of respect for the job but mostly because Carl’s reaction had rattled me more than I wanted to admit. The shift passed uneventfully. Line 7 stayed silent, the door stayed still, and the microphone didn’t so much as crackle. For a moment, I thought Carl had just been overly paranoid.

But then came the second night. And that’s when I got careless.

The first few hours of my shift were uneventful. I spun some classic rock—familiar tunes that made the graveyard hours feel less lonely. A couple of bored night owls called in to chat, their voices crackling with the kind of late-night aimlessness that only comes with insomnia. I read a few ad scripts, stumbling slightly over one for a discount furniture store, and chuckled to myself as I imagined who could possibly be listening at this hour. It was all routine, quiet, mundane.

Then, as the clock inched closer to 3:00 AM, I remembered Carl’s jazz rule. My stomach did a little flip, a combination of annoyance and unease. I’d almost forgotten. Grumbling under my breath, I began rifling through the station’s dusty stacks of vinyl, my fingers brushing against worn, paper-thin sleeves. Most of the records were decades old, their covers faded and stained, smelling faintly of mildew and neglect. Finally, I found an old Miles Davis album. The sleeve was tattered, the vinyl scratched, but it would do. I slid it onto the turntable and set it up, waiting for the clock to tick to 3:06.

When the second hand struck the mark, I dropped the needle onto the record. The warm, honeyed sound of the trumpet poured out of the speakers, filling the studio with smooth, soulful energy. I leaned back in my chair, letting out a satisfied breath. *Good job*, I thought. I’d remembered. No mistakes tonight.

But as the music played, something started to feel... off. At first, it was subtle—just a faint noise, barely noticeable beneath the melody. I dismissed it as static or the wear of the old vinyl. But the longer I listened, the more it seemed like something else. Like a whisper.

I leaned forward, my ear closer to the monitor, trying to make out the sound. My skin prickled. The whisper wasn’t random—it had a rhythm, a cadence, like someone muttering just below the surface of the music. My pulse quickened, and I turned up the volume slightly, straining to catch it. The whisper grew louder, more distinct, until it wasn’t a whisper anymore. It was a voice. Low, raspy, and... wrong.

“Don’t stop,” it said.

I froze, my breath caught in my throat. My eyes flicked to the microphone. The red light was off. It wasn’t live. The voice wasn’t coming from me.

My heart pounded against my ribs as I stared at the speakers, hoping, *praying*, that I was imagining things. But then it came again, clearer this time.

“Don’t stop the music.”

I shot out of my chair, panic surging through me. My hands trembled as I stopped the record, the needle screeching as it lifted from the vinyl. The voice cut off instantly. The studio was silent—so silent that the hum of the old fluorescent light above me sounded deafening.

I stood there, frozen, trying to catch my breath. I glanced at the clock. My stomach dropped.

3:10 AM. Four minutes late.

A wave of dread washed over me. My fingers gripped the edge of the console as Carl’s warning echoed in my mind. *You’re not gonna like what happens.*

The phone rang.

Not just any phone—Line 7.

The shrill, electronic cry cut through the suffocating silence, sharp and jarring. I flinched, my heart slamming against my ribs. My eyes locked on the blinking red light of the forbidden line, and my stomach churned. Carl’s words pounded in my head: *Never answer calls from Line 7.*

It rang again.

And again.

Each ring seemed to grow louder, more piercing, like the sound itself was burrowing into my skull. My hands trembled as I took an instinctive step back from the desk, bumping into the chair behind me. The room felt colder, darker. The air was thick, heavy, like the walls themselves were closing in.

The ringing didn’t stop.

It kept going. Louder and louder, more shrill with every chime, until it felt like the entire building was vibrating with it. I clapped my hands over my ears, desperate to block out the sound, and squeezed my eyes shut, my breaths coming in ragged, shallow gasps.

And then, as suddenly as it had started, it stopped.

Silence.

I opened my eyes—and froze.

The studio was pitch black. Every light—the overhead fluorescents, the control panel, even the flickering neon sign outside—was out. The soft hum of electricity that I hadn’t even realized I’d been hearing was gone, swallowed up by the darkness. The world outside the windows was nothing but an impenetrable void.

I couldn’t move. Couldn’t breathe.

Then I heard it.

Knocking.

At first, it was barely there. A soft, rhythmic tapping on the studio door, so faint I almost convinced myself it was my imagination.

*Check the security camera before opening it.* Carl’s rule came rushing back to me.

My fingers fumbled across the desk, searching blindly in the darkness for the monitor switch. I found it and flipped it on with trembling hands. The screen flickered to life, casting a pale, ghostly glow over the room.

The hallway outside the studio came into view. The grainy black-and-white feed showed nothing but the empty corridor stretching out into the shadows.

The knocking came again, louder this time.

“Who’s there?” I croaked, my voice thin and cracking with fear.

No answer.

The camera feed remained empty. The hallway was still and lifeless, but the sound of knocking persisted. It grew sharper, more urgent, each blow reverberating through the studio walls.

Bang.

Bang.

Bang.

It wasn’t a polite knock anymore. It was angry, violent, as if someone—or *something*—was trying to force its way inside. My legs buckled, and I stumbled back, clutching the crumpled list of rules in my hand like it was a lifeline, as though it might somehow shield me from whatever was out there.

And then, just as quickly as it had begun, the banging stopped.

Silence fell over the studio once more.

But it wasn’t the comforting kind of silence. It was oppressive, unnatural, a void that pressed against my ears and made my chest feel tight. The absence of noise was worse than the sound itself.

I stood frozen, every muscle locked, my ears straining against the suffocating quiet, waiting for what would come next.

I sat there, folded into myself, knees pressed tightly to my chest like they were the only thing holding me together. The studio felt like a tomb, and I was its reluctant occupant. Every sound—the groaning of the building settling, the faint whispers of the wind through the trees—felt magnified, sinister. My eyes darted around the blackened room, searching for threats I couldn’t see.

And then it came.

The static.

It started softly, around 4:00 AM, a faint crackle that barely broke the suffocating silence. I froze, my blood turning to ice. It was coming from the microphone. The one I knew for a fact was off—I’d switched it off hours ago. But there it was, alive with that eerie, unnatural hiss.

At first, I tried to convince myself it was just a malfunction, maybe interference from the storm clouds gathering outside. But deep down, I knew better.

The static grew louder, its pitch shifting in a way that made the hair on the back of my neck stand on end. I stared at the mic, its lifeless red light mocking me. My breath quickened.

Then the voice came.

“Why didn’t you follow the rules?”

It was the same voice I’d heard earlier, low and grating, but now there was venom in it, an unfiltered fury that made my stomach churn.

I scrambled to the control panel, my hands shaking as I tried to shut it down. I jabbed at the buttons, twisted the knobs, yanked at wires. Nothing worked. The microphone seemed alive, immune to my desperation.

The voice came again, louder this time.

“Why didn’t you follow the rules?”

Each word seemed to stab into my mind, echoing and expanding until it was all I could hear. The static swelled, its relentless buzz filling the room like a flood, drowning out my thoughts, my heartbeat, everything.

“Why didn’t you follow the rules?”

It wasn’t just coming from the speakers anymore. It was *everywhere*—the walls, the floor, the air itself. It burrowed into my head, reverberating like a thunderclap inside my skull. My hands flew to my ears, but it didn’t help. The sound was already in me.

I screamed, the raw sound ripping from my throat, but it was swallowed up by the cacophony. The static surged, a deafening roar that left no room for anything else.

And then—

Silence.

It stopped.

The sudden quiet was like a slap, almost more jarring than the noise had been. My ears rang, my body trembling as I stared at the microphone, now dormant, as if nothing had happened.

But I knew better. Something had changed. Something was watching. Waiting.

The lights flickered back on, weak and hesitant at first, before fully flooding the studio with their dull, buzzing glow. It felt unnatural, like the building itself had been holding its breath and now, reluctantly, was letting it out. I blinked against the sudden brightness, my vision adjusting, and for a moment, it was like waking up from a nightmare I wasn’t entirely sure was over.

The clock on the wall ticked steadily, its hands resting on 6:00 AM. My shift was over. The night that had stretched on for what felt like an eternity had finally given way to morning. But the usual relief—the kind that comes with punching out and heading home—was nowhere to be found. All I felt was exhaustion, fear, and the weight of something unseen pressing down on me.

My legs wobbled as I stood, the journey from the studio to the parking lot feeling longer than it ever should. The crisp morning air hit me like a shock, but it wasn’t refreshing. It was cold and indifferent, a harsh reminder that the world outside had gone on, oblivious to whatever horror lurked within that studio.

Carl was waiting in the parking lot, leaning against his battered old sedan. His face was pale, drawn tight with a weariness that looked permanent, like someone who had seen too much and didn’t bother trying to forget anymore. His eyes locked onto mine, and in that moment, I knew he didn’t need to ask. He could see it written all over me.

“You broke the rules, didn’t you?” His voice was soft, but there was no sympathy in it. Just resignation.

I nodded, my throat too dry to form words.

Carl sighed heavily, like a man carrying a burden that was never truly his but one he had resigned himself to bear. From his pocket, he pulled out a folded sheet of paper, edges worn and smudged with fingerprints. He handed it to me without a word.

I unfolded it with trembling hands. A new list. Different rules. Stricter. Stranger.

“Next time,” Carl said, his tone as serious as a funeral, “do exactly what it says. Or you won’t make it to the morning.”

His words hung in the air, chilling and absolute. I wanted to ask him what “it” was, what exactly haunted the studio during those suffocating midnight hours. But the look in his eyes silenced me. I didn’t want to know. Not really.

Carl climbed into his car and drove off, leaving me alone in the parking lot. The paper in my hand felt heavier than it should, like it carried the weight of some dark truth I was now bound to.

I still don’t know what’s out there, what claws at the edges of the station during those cursed hours. But I’ve learned one thing, burned into my mind like a brand: the rules aren’t suggestions. They’re not some quirky manual written by a paranoid ex-employee. They’re a lifeline. The only thing standing between me and whatever waits in the shadows.

Every time I clock in now, I read the list. Over and over. I memorize every line, every rule, as if my life depends on it. Because it does. I don’t question them. I don’t get curious.

Curiosity is what killed the last guy. I never met him, but I see the name scratched into the desk, carved by a trembling hand.

Because the moment you stop following the rules?

As anxiety worsens, it can lead to panic disorder. Panic attacks often come out of nowhere, even in everyday situations, bringing a sudden wave of intense fear and a sense of impending doom, causing extreme distress.

# Common Symptoms of a Panic Attack:

 • Rapid heartbeat

• Chest pain or tightness

 • Shortness of breath

 • Feeling like you can’t breathe

 • Nausea or stomach pain

 • Shaking or trembling

 • Numbness or tingling in hands and feet

 • Dizziness or headache

 • Hot flashes or chills

# What causes panic attacks?

The exact cause of panic disorder is still unclear, according to current research. However, it is believed that the underlying physiology of panic disorder is similar to that of most anxiety disorders. The intense feelings of fear and near-death sensations in panic attacks are linked to dysfunction in the autonomic nervous system, which is also associated with anxiety disorders. When the sympathetic nervous system becomes overactive while the parasympathetic nervous system, which normally counterbalances it, is suppressed, severe physical symptoms like heart palpitations, shortness of breath, and numbness can occur. However, medical tests typically show no organic damage, meaning conditions like heart disease or stroke are not the cause.

From a biological perspective, scientists have identified several possible factors that may contribute to panic disorder:

 • **Serotonin imbalance:** Either too little or too much serotonin in the brain can disrupt autonomic nervous system function.

 **• Amygdala hypersensitivity:** The amygdala, a brain region responsible for processing emotions, may be overly sensitive to fear-related stimuli, leading to dysregulated physical reactions.

 **• HPA axis overactivation:** Increased activity in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis can lead to excessive stress responses, contributing to panic attacks.

# How do you calm down from an anxiety attack?

Although many people believe they can control a panic attack with breathing techniques, positive thinking, or cold water, these methods are often ineffective for someone experiencing a true panic attack. When the nervous system is severely overstimulated and out of balance, the fastest and most effective solution is to take a sedative immediately.

# The Importance of Sedatives for Panic Attacks

Panic disorder is typically treated with benzodiazepines as sedatives. These medications work quickly, often relieving symptoms within 30 minutes to an hour, making them highly effective during panic attacks.

During a panic attack, prolonged episodes can lead to complications such as atrial fibrillation and excessive nervous system strain, which may cause physical harm over time. Sedatives help stabilize the nervous system and prevent excessive damage.

However, benzodiazepines can be addictive, so they should only be used for short-term relief. Many people avoid them due to concerns about dependence, but these risks can be managed. By tapering off the medication after about a week and using it only for acute attacks, addiction can be avoided. At the same time, high-dose therapeutic supplements support nervous system repair, while a targeted diet and exercise plan help restore and enhance brain function. This approach not only prevents dependence but also leads to a long-term resolution of panic disorder.

# Panic attack treatment plan

People with panic disorder are highly sensitive to certain substances and should avoid alcohol, coffee, tea, chocolate, and anything containing nicotine.

 1. If you experience a panic attack for the first time, see a doctor for a full medical evaluation to rule out other potential conditions. If any underlying health issues are found, seek treatment as soon as possible.

 2. If panic attacks become frequent, consult your primary care doctor and consider taking benzodiazepine tranquilizers to stabilize your nervous system. Try to limit their use to no more than one month.

 3. At the same time, it’s essential to address the root cause of panic attacks: brain and nervous system dysfunction. This can be treated with pharmaceutical-grade supplements.

 **• Nervous system repair:** Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, Methyl folate (5-MTHF), Vitamin B12, Vitamin B complex, Magnesium Glycinate or Magnesium L-Threonate

 **• Brain function repair:** Pharmaceutical grade fish oil, Choline, Vitamin C
