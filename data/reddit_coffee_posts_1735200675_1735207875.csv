1hmkzsa,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/1hmkzsa/powerlessness_omnipotence_and_agency/,"Powerlessness, Omnipotence ... and Agency","I notice I still have a fair amount of dysfunction around my sense of agency in my life.

I notice I frequently feel ""powerless"" to get my needs met in relationships.

Other people are ""trapping me"" or ""inhibiting me"". ""If it weren't for them, I'd be free. I'd be myself.""

That kind of vibe.

In response to this underlying assumption, I notice I habitually give-in or yield to the situation I've just formed in my mind:

""Oh well. There's no hope.""

That comes with huge anger, sometimes rage, and chronic hostility towards other people.

In response, I socially withdraw. I feel sulky. I numb out. 

All of these modes play multi-functional roles of shutting down the felt pain inside, but also passively-aggressively trying to either signal to other people that I'm suffering (in a victim-like way), or trying to bring them down to my low.

I can pull myself out of these states more easily now, but they are still there as reflexes.

Alternatively, I can react with overt anger and even aggression - which obviously doesn't go down well or help me in the longer term.

...

Another response to feeling powerless is the tendency to ""wedge-in"" my need-meeting into my life, but in ways that keep me feeling trapped, and not breaking the interpersonal patterns.

I get up very early to be on my own for a few hours and have ""me time."" I workout and look in the mirror, admiring myself. It gives me that impression of ""being seen"". But I'm not actually being seen.

It also gives me that feeling of being powerful, in fact: omnipotent. I feel invincible in that mirror. I dance. I lift. I push. I am strong and graceful. I am brilliant. Beautiful. Powerful.

Anything's possible.

People then wake up and I stop my routine. I put everything away and switch to showing-up in ways that I think are acceptable for the other person. I put on music they would like. I make them coffee. I sot and talk with them about what they want to talk about.

This is all very ""nice"" of me, but the chronic nature of these patterns means I am habitually negating self-expression of really any kind.

Again, my mind turns to: ""Oh well. Happy hour is over. Time to hide. Time to serve the other person. I have no choice.""

I feel unseen, invisible, and angry that the other person is ""making me do this.""

...

There are other ways in which this pattern plays out. I often feel intruded upon, dominated, crushed, invisible, denied of my needs and preferences.

Now, I have parents who have very strong wills. My Mum also frequently shuts me down or criticises me for expressing myself. At the same time, I find her very intrusive and overbearing with her own opinions. When she does this, like she literally did just now as I was writing this, I feel both intense rage as well as hopelessness. 

""There's no point even trying to contradict her because she presents so much as invulnerable.""

She is rarely 'wrong'. Instead, she presents herself as an authority in most aspects of life, and expresses this through some pretty harsh put-downs and dismissals.

The painful roots of my problem, right there. Something for deeper exploration in therapy.

...

I also partnered with a person who is a really strong character, who has his own anxieties about his place in the world, but who tends to just take the limelight when he wants it. He also has a short fuse and interrupts me and shuts me down. Again, he has that habit of shutting people down - not just me - when he doesn't like something they say or do. I think he jumps to a lot of conclusions about what people are going to say, which leads him to snap at people. 

We fit together like a lock and key in some dysfunctional ways: he tends to just share and lead and be loud and fast to get his needs met. I tend to hide, can't be bothered, or go quietly resentful, and then feel bitter about him ""dominating me"".

I noticed this yesterday during Christmas lunch. He played some music he liked and really loudly. He started talking about it to the group, how much he loved it etc.

I noticed myself getting really angry and feeling resentful about ""how hard it is to live with someone who dominates so much and leaves no room for me.""

I quickly said to everyone that I was going for a bike ride. At the time, it was a reaction to feeling trapped ""by him"". 

Out on the road, I found myself ruminating angrily about him. 

It took a while, but I gradually tried to shift my perspective to see the patterns I've described above in myself: feeling like a doormat, not bothering, but instead feeling chronically bitter about my ""lack of freedom"".

...

Now, living with a strong-willed partner and dismissive mother, there is actually evidence to support my feelings. 

But I must try not to fall into that internal, resentful ruminating. It doesn't achieve much.

Instead, I need to shift my stance and enjoy my life.

This is my life. I'm with other people, yes. But I'm already considerate and other-seving **enough**. 

I feel I could do with being more assertive.

I **do** have agency. I **can** express myself.

I need to try to weave in that self-expression more into my days when I'm with people so that I get my needs for autonomy and self-expression met in relation to others. I need to do this in balance with giving space for others to get their needs met. 

If people do genuinely shut me down, then I need to turn towards joyful expression despite their dismissals. That is their dysfunction, and I can't change it. But I can still do or say what I think is true snd right for me, in a respectful way.

I need to not hide away but put myself out in the open.

I do it here, in a post. But that's easy. That's actually still hiding.

I need to do it in real life as well.

...

At the same time, I can't ignore the pain of not feeling appreciated or seen in childhood and in the present.

I can't whitewash over those feelings and those wounds with positive perspectives.

Over-positivity is another form of dismissal. It really pisses me off.

There is a pain that needs tending to. Grieving. Mourning.

The pain of those emotional wounds.",1,1735205476.0,NPD,1,1.0,False

I eagerly said yes- I consider him as a barkada & kuya too and we are close. 
I decided to post the pics on my FB account and tagged him. I even added a joke on the caption-""my cousin is single"". 

Little did I know that it will lead him to a new relationship.

He has been single for a few years, coming from 9-year relationship. That is why we are surprised when he posted pics of his trip overseas with a girl, revealing that he is now taken again. I got excited sa totoo lang, and when I saw him I excitedly asked about the girl. Typical question, how did they meet? 

It turns out is because of the FB post that I made. 

They already know each other way back pala, former colleagues. They are long time FB friends din. They stop talking for a while. The GF saw my FB post about our coffee & samgyup time and read my caption that he is single! After a while they started talking again, and the rest as they say is history.

But what made this whole thing touching to my heart is when I asked my Kuya how old the girl is. She is 35. Almost the same age as me. Not a girl in her 20s.

I guess, I am happy for the girl more than I am happy for my Kuya. As someone who has constantly reads here how women in my age group are ""expired"", less fertile than women in their 20s it comforts me that a Man like my Kuya exists who doesn't conform to the norms being imposed on age gaps in relationships. Who looked past the age. Who looked past the fertility percentage. I can say I am proud that we have a Man like that in my family.

I can't wait for their wedding day.

Understanding how much water to drink each day can be a game-changer for your health and wellness. Hydration plays a crucial role in keeping your body functioning optimally. When your body is well-hydrated, you may notice improvements in energy levels, digestion, skin health, and even mental clarity. But just how much water should you aim to consume daily?

Experts often recommend a daily intake of about 8 to 10 cups of water, roughly equivalent to 2 to 2.5 liters. However, this is a general guideline, and individual needs can vary significantly based on several factors.

### Factors Influencing Water Needs

Your daily water intake can differ based on:

- **Body Weight:** Heavier individuals generally need more water. A common suggestion is to drink between 0.5 to 1 ounce of water for each pound of body weight.

- **Thirst:** It might sound obvious, but feeling thirsty is your body’s way of signaling that it needs more fluid.
- **Urine Color:** Clear or light yellow urine typically indicates good hydration, while dark yellow can be a sign you need more water.
- **Dry Mouth or Skin:** These can be signs of dehydration, suggesting it's time to drink up.
- **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or having low energy? Sometimes dehydration can be the culprit.

### Health Benefits of Staying Hydrated

Water is essential for every cell in your body. It plays a crucial role in regulating body temperature, maintaining joint lubrication, and supporting the health of your organs. When you are well-hydrated, you can experience increased energy levels, improved focus, and better overall health.

Here’s how drinking enough water can boost your energy:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Enhanced Physical Performance:** Staying hydrated helps you perform at your best during physical activities. When you're lacking sufficient water, your body may feel fatigued and less capable. Drinking enough water can help prevent premature exhaustion and keep your energy levels stable.
- **Improved Mental Clarity:** Hydration is vital for brain function. Even mild dehydration can lead to fatigue, headaches, and decreased concentration. Keeping your brain well-hydrated enhances your cognitive abilities, leading to sharper focus and improved problem-solving skills.
- **Better Nutrient Absorption:** Water aids digestion and helps in the absorption of nutrients. If you're not drinking enough, your body may struggle to absorb essential vitamins and minerals, which can lead to decreased energy levels.
- **Regulation of Body Temperature:** An adequate intake of water helps regulate body temperature. When you're properly hydrated, your body can cool itself effectively, reducing feelings of fatigue due to overheating.
- **Detoxification:** Water plays a critical role in flushing toxins out of your system. A well-hydrated body can eliminate waste more efficiently, preventing sluggishness and fatigue that can arise when toxins build up.

The question arises, how much water should you be drinking daily? While the common recommendation is eight 8-ounce glasses, several factors can influence this amount. Consider your physical activity level, climate, and overall health. Here’s a simple way to determine your personalized water needs:

1. Start with the standard guideline of 8 cups.
2. Adjust based on your activity level. If you exercise regularly or live in a hot climate, you might require more.
3. Look for signs of dehydration, such as dark urine or dry mouth, which can indicate that you need to drink more.
4. Listen to your body. Thirst is a natural signal your body sends when it needs water.

In addition to these factors, it’s crucial to remember that hydration isn't just about drinking plain water. hydrating foods can also boost your intake. Fruits and vegetables such as cucumbers, oranges, and strawberries have high water content and can contribute to your daily needs.

- **Use a Water Bottle:** Keep a reusable water bottle with you. Seeing it can encourage you to drink more frequently.
- **Flavor It:** If plain water doesn't excite you, try adding slices of fruit or herbs, like mint, to add a refreshing twist.
- **Track Your Intake:** Keeping a journal or using apps can help you monitor how much water you consume and motivate you to meet your goals.

These hydration strategies into your daily routine can have a profound impact on your energy levels. Remember that maintaining optimal hydration is not only about quenching thirst; it’s a key to unlocking your full potential.

Water Intake: Myths vs. Facts
-----------------------------

Understanding water intake is essential for maintaining good health, but there are numerous myths surrounding how much water you should drink daily. Let's sift through these myths and uncover the facts to help you make informed decisions about your hydration.

### Myth 1: You Need to Drink Eight Glasses of Water a Day

One of the most common beliefs is that everyone needs to drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water daily, which equals about 2 liters. While this is a good general rule, it doesn’t apply to everyone. Your individual water needs depend on several factors:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Age:** Younger individuals often require more water due to higher activity levels.
- **Gender:** Men typically need more water than women.
- **Activity Level:** More active individuals should increase their intake to replace lost fluids.
- **Climate:** Hot and humid weather can increase your water needs.
- **Health Status:** Illnesses or conditions can affect hydration needs.

### Myth 2: Coffee and Tea Count Toward Your Daily Intake

Many people think that caffeinated beverages like coffee and tea dehydrate you. The truth is that these drinks do contribute to your daily fluid intake. While caffeine can have a mild diuretic effect, studies show that regular consumers of caffeinated beverages build a tolerance over time.

### Myth 3: Thirst is the Only Indicator of Hydration

While thirst is a clear sign that you need water, waiting for it to make a move can be risky. By the time you feel thirsty, you may already be slightly dehydrated. It's vital to drink water regularly throughout the day, even if you don’t feel thirsty. Set reminders or keep a water bottle handy to ensure that you stay hydrated.

### Myth 4: Clear Urine Equals Perfect Hydration

Your urine color can be a useful hydration indicator, but it's not the only factor to consider. Very clear urine may suggest overhydration, which can cause an electrolyte imbalance. On the other hand, dark yellow urine typically indicates dehydration. Aim for a light yellow color for optimal hydration.

### Myth 5: You Can't Drink Too Much Water

Excessive water intake is indeed possible and can lead to a condition known as water intoxication or hyponatremia. This condition dilutes the levels of sodium in your blood and can cause serious health issues. Here's how to prevent it:

- Listen to your body: Drink when you're thirsty.
- Avoid excessive drinking during endurance activities.
- Consider drinking electrolyte-rich fluids if you are exercising intensely.

### Staying Hydrated with Food

Water intake doesn’t solely come from beverages. You can increase your hydration levels through foods. Many fruits and vegetables have high water content, such as:

- **Watermelon:** About 92% water.
- **Cucumbers:** Roughly 95% water.
- **Strawberries:** Comprise about 91% water.

Including these items in your diet is an excellent way to help you reach your hydration goals without drinking copious amounts of water.

Embracing these effective tips can help you significantly increase your daily water consumption. Remember, hydration is essential not just for your physical health but also for your mental clarity, energy levels, and overall well-being.

The Role of Hydration in Weight Management and Detoxification
-------------------------------------------------------------

Staying hydrated is essential for everyone, but its role in weight management and detoxification is particularly significant. Water does not just quench your thirst; it is a vital component of your body's overall health. Understanding the connection between hydration and your body's ability to manage weight and detoxify can empower you to make better choices for your health.

Firstly, adequate hydration can influence your appetite. Ever felt hungry even after a meal? Sometimes, your body confuses thirst with hunger. Drinking enough water can help you distinguish between the two. A study found that drinking water before meals can reduce calorie intake, making it a simple yet powerful tool in weight management.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
Another aspect of hydration that aids in weight control is its thermogenic effect. Your body burns calories while processing water, known as water-induced thermogenesis. When you consume cold water, your body has to work harder to warm it up to body temperature, resulting in a minor increase in calorie burning. This means that simply drinking water can contribute to your daily energy expenditure.

Water also improves your metabolic rate. When you are adequately hydrated, your metabolism functions optimally, allowing your body to break down food efficiently. Low water intake can slow down your metabolism, making it harder to burn calories and lose weight.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
Moreover, proper hydration supports physical activity. If you’re exercising, drinking water replenishes fluids lost through sweat and helps maintain energy levels. When you're dehydrated, fatigue sets in quicker, making it difficult to sustain workouts. By staying hydrated, you tend to perform better, which can lead to more significant weight loss results.

In addition to weight management, the importance of hydration cannot be overstated in the detoxification process. Your kidneys, which filter waste from the blood, rely heavily on water to function effectively. When you're dehydrated, your kidneys can’t do their job properly, leading to the buildup of toxins in the body.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
The liver, which is crucial for detoxification, also benefits from ample hydration. It converts toxins into waste products for elimination. Sufficient water intake is necessary for the liver to function efficiently and helps to remove waste from the body. Therefore, a well-hydrated body not only flushes out toxins more effectively but also prevents the buildup of harmful substances.

- **Promotes Healthy Digestion:** Water aids in the digestion process, preventing constipation and other digestive issues.
- **Enhances Skin Health:** Proper hydration helps maintain skin elasticity and can reduce the appearance of wrinkles, giving you a more youthful glow.
- **Regulates Body Temperature:** Hydration plays a key role in maintaining your body temperature, especially during physical activity.

Water into your daily routine can also enhance your mental clarity and mood. Dehydration can lead to fatigue and decreased alertness, which affects your ability to make healthy choices around food and exercise. Staying hydrated keeps your mind sharp and can impact your motivation to lead a healthier lifestyle.

So, how much water should you drink daily to reap these benefits? A common recommendation is to aim for about eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day, known as the ""8x8 rule."" However, individual needs may vary based on factors such as weight, activity level, and climate. It's essential to listen to your body and increase your intake on hot days or during exercise.

Additionally, you can make hydration enjoyable. Infuse your water with fruits, herbs, or even vegetables for a flavorful twist. This can also encourage you to drink more, aiding in weight management and detoxification.

The roles of hydration in weight management and detoxification are crucial for overall health. By ensuring that you drink enough water daily, you support your body’s functions, manage your weight more effectively, and help eliminate toxins. Make the simple act of drinking water a priority in your daily routine, and watch how it transforms both your health and wellness.

### Conclusion

Understanding how much water you should drink daily is essential for enhancing your overall health and wellness. Proper hydration is linked closely to your energy levels; when you're well-hydrated, you can maintain sharper focus and increased stamina throughout the day. It's vital to separate the myths from the facts surrounding water consumption, as misconceptions can lead to either overhydration or not drinking enough.

By implementing effective tips to boost your daily water intake—such as carrying a reusable water bottle or infusing your water with fruits—you can transform how you feel both physically and mentally. Additionally, adequate hydration plays a significant role in weight management and detoxification by helping your body flush out toxins and reducing feelings of hunger.

Not in the obvious way, but in the tiny moments I can’t escape. You’re in the songs I skip, the smell of coffee I avoid, the stupid inside jokes I can’t laugh at anymore.

People tell me to move on, as if it’s just a switch I can flip. But they don’t know how much of me I left with you. They don’t know that losing you wasn’t just losing a person... it was losing the future I thought we’d have.

I still wonder sometimes. Do you think about me? Do you ever miss me the way I miss you? Or have you already forgotten the way my laugh sounded or the way we used to finish each other’s sentences?

I try to hate you. God, I wish I could. But the truth is, I don’t. I can’t. Even though you left me with this hollow ache, part of me is still holding on to the pieces of us.

I don’t know if I’ll ever let go of you completely. And maybe that’s okay. Maybe some people are meant to leave a mark, even if it hurts.",2,1735205052.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

I still miss my pup every single day, and lately, with AI evolving so quickly, I had an idea: “What if I could bring my dog back into my life digitally?”

So I got to work on building a model of my dog in a virtual space. Once I finished, something unexpected and beautiful happened: I was able to create entirely new memories with my best friend. We’ve gone “camping” under the stars, taken beach strolls, and even wandered through virtual forests together. It was like my beloved dog had truly come back to me—not just as a memory from the past, but as a living companion in this new digital realm.

I’ve come to believe that instead of being stuck in old memories, we can continue to create new ones. Love doesn’t have to remain in photographs alone; it can accompany us in all sorts of fresh experiences, whether real or virtual.

Here’s a photo I’d love to share—both me and my (digitally recreated) dog having a blast on a beach. If you’ve ever considered modeling your own pet—like your cat—and taking virtual snapshots of you two enjoying a vacation in the mountains or hanging out at a coffee shop, I hope these photos can bring you peace and comfort.

If you’re not sure how to do this or just need a hand setting it all up, feel free to DM me! I’d be happy to help you create new memories with the ones you love.

Thanks for reading and hope to see you in the virtual world!

1hmkty6,https://www.reddit.com/r/PetPeeves/comments/1hmkty6/people_who_complain_about_other_peoples_coffee/,people who complain about other people's coffee order,"Context; I loathe the taste of lactose milk. Literally, my earliest memory is me refusing to drink milk and spitting it at my dad. It makes my skin crawl. And also, I don't know for sure if this made me lactose intolerant or what; I have had moments where I've had lactose milk in my coffee by mistake and two hours later had the worst cramps, but I still eat cheese, ice cream, chocolate etc, so I digress.

So I take oat milk in my coffee and the reactions I get drive me insane. Even from my own damn family. It's always some variation of ""vegan snowflake"" (I'm not even vegan) or if it's my family ""your fake lactose intolerance"". I offer to, and in some cases do, buy my own oat milk when I'm home, but even then my siblings still roll their eyes at it. Damn sorry I'm not going to ingest something I freaking despite the taste of.

I also like fun coffees while some of my siblings prefer americanos, so of course when I go to order a ""gingerbread oat latte"" the reactions are ""oh my god you're so basic"" or actiing like it's an incredibly complicated order. Half the comedy specials I see are people complaining about pumpkin spice lattes or ""white girl coffee"", which is basically anything other than a black coffee. There's this song I really like, but there's one line where the singer says ""I take my coffee black cause I'm not fricking pretentious"". Like girl, you are complaining about someone else's coffee order and yet we're the pretentious ones?

My sister even rolled her eyes at me getting it iced once because ""it's coffee it's not meant to be iced, why can't you just order normally"". We were in Lisbon in 40 degree heat. Again, I've seen loads of people complain about iced coffee because ""it's meant to be hot"".

Another time I was in my regular coffee shop, ordered a gingerbread oat latte and a guy in the line rolled his eyes and made a point of saying ""just a normal black coffee please"".

I just cannot imagine caring that much about what someone else is putting into their body. It's for me, not you! Unless it's hard drugs, why do people care? It's my money Sharon and if I want to spend it on an oat latte with hazelnut syrup I will!",3,1735204691.0,PetPeeves,4,0.8,False

1hmkre9,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExPentecostal/comments/1hmkre9/concerned_about_my_sisters_involvement_with_chi/,Concerned About My Sister’s Involvement with Chi Alpha – Seeking Advice,"I apologize this is long but I’m really worried about my sister and her involvement with a campus Christian group called Chi Alpha. Lately, it seems like this group is taking over so much of her life, and I’m not sure how to help or if there’s anything that can be done. I’m hoping to get some advice from others who might have had similar experiences.

Social Isolation

My sister has completely distanced herself from our family and friends. She spends almost all her time with people from Chi Alpha and is rarely in touch with us. She didn’t  want to come home for Christmas, which is really hard for me and our family but I was able to convince her to come home for a few days. She recently became a small group leader in Chi Alpha, which seems to have given her even more responsibility and influence within the group. It’s like she’s taking on a role that’s further separating her from us.

Financial and Time Commitments

She spends a lot of her time volunteering at the group-run coffee shop, and I’m concerned that this is eating into her personal life and taking away from things that used to be important to her. She’s also donating a significant amount of money to Chi Alpha, which is worrying given that she doesn’t have a lot of money to begin with.

Major Life Influence

The group has been heavily influencing her decisions, like convincing her to switch her major, because they believe her previous major wouldn’t align with her future role as a parent. It feels like the group is controlling her choices in a way that limits her potential. She’s also expressed a desire to go on mission trips to “save people’s souls.” While I respect her desire to help others, it seems like her entire focus is now on this mission, and it’s replacing other meaningful pursuits. Not to mention she’s not doing well in school with her new major and I’m assuming because she’s dedicating so much time to this group. She’s only a sophomore but after her freshman year she moved in with her small group leader and other girls who are in chi alpha. They speak to each using a lot of therapy talk and constantly referencing each other’s “traumas”. 2 of the girls she is roommates with are already engaged to guys they met at bible camp less than a year ago. It’s all just very strange.

Views on LGBTQ+ People

She has also expressed troubling views about LGBTQ+ people, saying they are the way they are because they haven’t experienced love. Once they experience love they’ll realize they’re actually heterosexual. It just doesn’t make sense to me, and I’m worried about how these beliefs are shaping her views on the world.

Constant Focus on God/Jesus

My sister grew up Catholic, but our family wasn’t exactly practicing Catholics. Now, it seems like she’s completely immersed in this new faith. She’s constantly reading the Bible, and everything she talks about seems to relate back to God or Jesus. However, none of her reasoning really makes sense to me anymore. It’s like she’s using religion to explain everything, but it’s hard to follow or have meaningful conversations with her.

In general, it feels like Chi Alpha is taking over my sister’s identity, and I’m really worried about how it’s affecting her relationships, her goals, and her well-being. She’s becoming more and more isolated from us, and we feel like we’re losing her.

I don’t want to attack her beliefs, but I’m genuinely concerned for her mental health and future. Has anyone experienced something similar with a loved one in a religious group? How can I approach this without pushing her away or making her feel like we’re attacking her? Any advice would be really appreciated. Thanks!",1,1735204351.0,ExPentecostal,0,1.0,False

1hmkmr6,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiagnoseMe/comments/1hmkmr6/acid_reflux/,Acid reflux ,"170, 52 kg, 23 years old female. 

I have a concern…. Does very severe anxiety cause acid reflux? I didn’t really payed attention till now but In the past maybe more than one month I have what I think it is acid reflux every day. It’s not constant or severe it happens for few seconds at a time then disappears and can appear again after few hours. Most often a bit after I eat. It’s this burning feeling travelling up my throat bit like I said it’s not constant. I don’t think I get heartburn because I don’t have what is described (the pain like feelings behind chest) just the burning feeling. Sometimes i also get hunger pangs even after I eat but again nothing severe.

I am super anxious this whole year to be honest. My biggest fear is cancer and i am jumping from one type to another and it’s really hard for me not to think about it first when I develop a symptom. I know it’s probably all in my head but it’s really not helping me that very day something is popping up…. Now the acid reflux…. Obviously my first thought is stomach cancer and I’m super afraid…. This is all I think about 24/7… i don’t know if acid reflux is even a symptom because I read that acid reflux can cause it over time but I doesn’t says it’s a symptom… on Reddit tho people say it is and now my head went mad…

I tried to explain it to a doctor but I guess he is alredy tired of my anxiety and is not taking me seriously… he said I’m too young for this (I’m 23) and because I don’t loose weight, vomit, have fatigue or have persistent pain (or any pain at all) he will not even consider testing. My recent blood work was also perfect.

1hmkm8e,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1hmkm8e/acid_reflux/,Acid reflux ,"23 female, 170, 52 kg. No knows serious health conditions, diagnosed anxiety. 

I have a concern…. Does very severe anxiety cause acid reflux? I didn’t really payed attention till now but In the past maybe more than one month I have what I think it is acid reflux every day. It’s not constant or severe it happens for few seconds at a time then disappears and can appear again after few hours. Most often a bit after I eat. It’s this burning feeling travelling up my throat bit like I said it’s not constant. I don’t think I get heartburn because I don’t have what is described (the pain like feelings behind chest) just the burning feeling. Sometimes i also get hunger pangs even after I eat but again nothing severe.

I am super anxious this whole year to be honest. My biggest fear is cancer and i am jumping from one type to another and it’s really hard for me not to think about it first when I develop a symptom. I know it’s probably all in my head but it’s really not helping me that very day something is popping up…. Now the acid reflux…. Obviously my first thought is stomach cancer and I’m super afraid…. This is all I think about 24/7… i don’t know if acid reflux is even a symptom because I read that acid reflux can cause it over time but I doesn’t says it’s a symptom… on Reddit tho people say it is and now my head went mad…

I tried to explain it to a doctor but I guess he is alredy tired of my anxiety and is not taking me seriously… he said I’m too young for this (I’m 23) and because I don’t loose weight, vomit, have fatigue or have persistent pain (or any pain at all) he will not even consider testing. My recent blood work was also perfect.

I wanted to share how Siri has helped me in my daily life, especially when paired with my Apple Watch. It’s like having a personal assistant on call 24/7! Here are some of my favorite ways Siri simplifies my life:
1. Translating on the go: “Translate ‘Where is the nearest coffee shop?’ into French” has saved me during trips!
2. Never forgetting groceries: “Add coffee to my shopping list” ensures I never miss anything.
3. Quick math genius: Need to calculate tips? “What’s 20% of $86?” is all I have to say.
4. Tracking workouts: During a run, I ask, “How far have I run?” or “What’s my heart rate?”—game-changer with my Apple Watch!
5. Music on demand: “Play ‘Discovery Weekly’ on Spotify” keeps me grooving hands-free.

And that’s just scratching the surface. Siri + Apple Watch = Life simplified!

How do you use Siri or your Apple Watch? Would love to hear your favorite tips! 😊

In all of its form it may not be an exclusively ND related problem, but I believe my nonexistent social skills are making it worse.

Just for clarification I'm not bad looking nor would I say that I have a dislikable personality... the only thing that is making it unbelievably hard for me to find a partner is my clumsy way to flirt and to find a way from this flirting stage to a talking and having a coffee stage. Of course, for a working relationship or at least a conversation you always need two people so I can't just blame it all on my autism/ myself. But it really bugs me that I've messed up at least one opportunity like this. We had a really great dynamic and even I understood that he really likes me in a flirty way (backed this up by asking a NT friend lol). I flirted back as good as I could, but when he is near me it feels like I'm imploding. I can't talk, I stutter really hard, my masking skills vanish and I just feel helpless so it never really got beyond the stage of flirting nonverbally. One other reason was that he probably didn't want to freak me out more. On the other side I'm pretty sure that he is generally indecisive/shy (I cant tell), but that I'm a total mess when talking to him makes it definitely worse.

Things like this happened one or two times so far. It is really annoying and hurts especially when you have a big crush on someone.",5,1735202993.0,AutismInWomen,3,1.0,False

Well, as the title says, I'm 42 from the US and a happily married to the best hubby ever. I definitely pride myself in being kind, compassionate, and thoughtful. I know myself to be very respectful of others and like to make others feel like they're worth something. My dad always taught me to treat others as you would like, and I always try to do that. I tend to be overly compassionate and kind and sadly, others try to take advantage of that as with the previous situation. No regrets though. It's Santa time and no better time to unwrap a new family member under my family Christmas tree. :)

So, why am I here or what am I looking for? Well, Me and my hubby are so happily married and I'm so very blessed in life but to a point, we are missing something. We have so much love and not anyone to give it to. I lost my dad a year ago and in the last week, a close family member and it makes you really think about your place in life and realizing you only got one shot and I want to be able to give what experience, advice, and memories I have had over my years and maybe pass on anything when it's my time to go. I want to be able to be a positive male role model for someone who may not had the words ""I'm proud of you or I love you son"". I know these are just words, but they are words I was afforded with my dad, and I want to be able to afford that to someone else who hasn't been blessed with that. We all have a road to travel, so why not travel it with someone who cares about you.

So what about me: Well, I'm actually a pretty boring introverted person with an outverted heart who loves to play video games, watch movies, listen to asmr (monk chanting), and sip warm tea or coffee on lazy days. I have a PC and Series X for those that it matters to. I also like to discuss deep life subjects, meaning of life and hear about other's great adventures. I love to listen even though I can talk a lot when I get going. I am also open to like and learn new things about others and what's important in their lives. I don't know much about being young now days, so I am all ears and brain to listen to learn new, exciting things.

What am I looking for? First, you must be from the USA. I'm not saying this to be harsh but at some point, I want this to be not just an online thing but real family and meet one day. Being outside of USA is just not really an option. I won't stray from that must, so sorry to others outside USA. Second, you must be honest about who you are and where u from. No saying you from the USA and lying about it. I had that in previous situation and won't do it again. Just be honest and respectful of that. Truth always comes out. There will be a point of voice chat and stuff to prove who we are, so be mindful of that. It's no rush. That takes a lot of time, so if you have no intention of ever doing that, pass me up. I will always be honest and open as long as you are. Last but not least, understand this is strictly respectful platonic. I'm not here for anything else or anything shady. If you try that, I will block you. That situation has happened before. This is a place for love respect, and family, and we all need to treat it as such. My heart is pure and yours need to be as well. Just know, if you decide to message, you will be treated with dignity, respect, and i will doe everything to make you feel safe around me. My only intention is making a positive impact in another's life.

Well, that was a long message. If you can get through that without sleeping, you made it the end of family Candyland and we are officially family. lol. Well, not yet but who knows. Just send me a message. You know how this works

1hmka3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1hmka3w/cafec_filters_and_their_dizzying_assortment/,CAFEC Filters and their dizzying assortment ,"# (My personal overall understanding)

The official website is quite confusing and they need a better translator

From what i understand, there is the regular Abaca followed by the Abaca+, then there's a TH series and even more confusing and further adding even more choices to the mix is their T series

The TH series i believe is highly specific and tuned for very specific effects that you should choose wisely to suit your coffee... and i believe the T series is just the same thing in different packaging

While both the Abaca and Abaca+ are all rounders... with the Abaca+ being more for professionals as the fine crepe makes it a faster flowing version requiring careful pouring due to the fact the fast flow makes your brew times more dependent on pouring speed... so i believe the ""+"" only stands for greater control whilst the regular Abaca flows slower with extended drawdowns that help with more casual techniques... since the only difference is the finer crepe on the + and the normal Abaca is their original OG two crepe papers that has a wider crepe and less inner surface area

# (My Conclusion)

The Abaca and Abaca+ are allrounders, with one being the more casual usage version and the Plus version requiring more careful pouring due to the fast flow

The TH-series are all highly specialized and it seems the TH-1 was made to ""increase aroma"" which i think is just a lost in translation way of saying ""the inner surface area is filled in by fines and traps the aromatic gasses and the built up pressure"" and that its ""Clean Cup"" is also another lost translation way of saying that ""High"" density means a lot of the oils are trapped in the paper than making it into the cup

The TH-2 seems to be the most unique...

>because adhesion of fine powder is not so much so water can flow smoother, but in the last half, its adhesion becomes larger then it applies the brakes to water flow.

This statement seems to be highly confusing but once i tried to understand the poorly translated message i believe they mean that the TH-2 has more fines holding/trapping capacity than the TH-1 but less than the TH-3... so it makes complete sense that... once you fill up the folds/creases/crepes with fines in the later half of your brew it would introduce the aforementioned ""braking effect""

In short it seems like the TH-2 has a fines holding capacity thats less than the TH-3, of which the fines holding capacity is just enough that it would be completely plugged with fines exactly halfway through the brew process and slowing the down the later half of your brew

It's medium density seems to provide a compromise of holding back less lipids and oils... and gives you the body... whilst the slowed brew gives you the sweetness via a longer extraction on the tail end of your brews

The TH-3 is basically the paper thats simply just.... the fastest flowing paper with the lowest density that holds back the least amount of lipids and oils (so it preserves body) and has the greatest amount of fines holding capacity that simply means it's the most clogging resistant and shouldnt slow your brew down at any point whatsoever from start to finish

# (TH Series Plot)

|(Paper)|(Thickness)|(Crepe)|(Paper Density)|(Inner Surface Area)|(Characteristics)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|TH-1|0.15mm|Single Outer Crepe|Highest|Lowest|Slowest of them all and is least clogging resistant, extremely clean and low body due to high oil retention|
|TH-2|0.22mm|Dual Crepe (Lower Crepe Depth than TH-3)|Medium|Medium|Faster than TH-1 but slows down in the later half of the brew once the crepes are filled in by fines, oils retention between TH-1 and TH-3 so it preserves some body|
|TH-3|0.28mm|Dual Crepe (Highest Crepe Depth)|Lowest|Highest|Fastest and most clogging resistance, greatest body due to least oil retention|

# (Abaca vs Abaca+)

|Paper|Crepe|Inner Surface Area|Characteristics|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Abaca+|Finer Width than Regular Abaca|Greater than Regular Abaca|Fast flowing all rounder with higher clogging resistance and more fines holding capacity|
|Abaca|Wider Width than Abaca+|Lesser than Abaca+|Slower flowing all rounder that is less sensitive to technique and has lesser fines holding capacity and lower clogging resistance|",12,1735202043.0,pourover,2,1.0,False

I’m looking into water and was wondering about TDS. Advice seems to be keep it below,say 130. I noticed the excellent Coffee Chronicler mentioning that Volvic is a popular bottled water to try. 
(And in the UK I’ve seen both Tesco “Ashbeck”. And Waitrose own “Lockhills GB4” water mentioned. 

So here’s my question. How to read the label, this is Volvic:
“NATURAL: MINERAL WATER
MINERAL COMPOSITION MG/LITRE: CALCIUM 12, SULPHATES 9, MAGNESIUM 8, SODIUM 12, BICARBONATES 74, POTASSIUM 65 SILICA 32, CHLORIDES 15; NITRATES 7.3, DRY RESIDUE 180°:
130MG/LITRE, PH:7”

So is “Dry Residue” listed here the TDS?

That way I can compare the other bottled waters til my Brita jug arrives and I start tasting from that (with the “Limescale Expert” filter as my local water is 280ppm.

Some get really good ones, some get really bad.

We’re spending a few days over Christmas with them. I do it for my partner. He says he isn’t bothered about what they think or their relationship in general, but as soon as she enters the room he’s straight there. It’s quite cringy at times. I have to take my mind elsewhere because it genuinely annoys me.

She’s been horrendous in the past. He’s the kid from the ‘other marriage’, so the level of neglect he got growing up compared to his sibling was awful. We even had to take 5 years away from them, because of horrible comments they made about the two of us. His brother passed away, and we tried to come back together to support and keep the peace. 

I can’t be comfortable around her. She’s incredibly judgmental and cold, and her mentality is like an 18 year old in a 60 year olds body. She wants to be ‘one of the kids’ and it genuinely angers me. Baring in mind there are no kids - we’re all 30+ with homes and mortgages. It’s madness to me.

She will never like me. Not truly. And I know that… but I don’t even know why I bother sitting with it. Does anyone else ever feel like this? Like they just want to wake up and to ‘what on earth am I even doing entertaining this?!’.
All of the snide comments, the unfair treatment. You’re treading on eggshells all the time and you’re 30+! Why should I?!

It’s gotten as stupid as - she bought a new coffee machine. We used it and really liked it. We said it was better than our current one, so we joked and said ‘would you mind if we copied you?’. Instead of replying and saying ‘no of course not’ she turned around and said ‘oh but SHE’LL (me) have to buy the more advanced version just to prove a point’. I stopped her and said what are you talking about - that’s absolute nonsense, and she didn’t acknowledge it, she just continued with what she was doing at the time. I’ve never EVER been competitive to deserve a comment like that, but she has to go out of her way just to get a dig in.

People joke when you’re growing up that MIL’s are difficult creatures sometimes, but nothing prepares you for the real deal. ",1,1735201932.0,inlaws,0,1.0,False

I’m planning to open a new coffee cafe in Indore with a unique concept focused solely on coffee varieties and a limited menu. My goal is to offer an exclusive experience for coffee lovers by introducing innovative brewing methods, unique flavors, and high-quality beans.

I’d love to get your input on a few things:

1. Best location in Indore: Which areas are ideal for a coffee-focused cafe that can attract young professionals, students, or coffee enthusiasts?


2. Investment estimate: How much initial investment (approx.) is needed for setting up a small but premium cafe, considering rent, interior design, equipment, and other costs?


3. Feasibility of the idea: Do you think a niche coffee cafe with a limited but high-quality menu would work in Indore’s market?


4. Any other tips or experiences you’d like to share that could help me make this venture successful?

I’d appreciate some guidance before taking the plunge. Thanks in advance!",1,1735201801.0,IndiaCoffee,2,1.0,False

And it will always be with her.(I have to repost from another account cause i was getting notifications on my phone :) )","I dont know if this is the correct place to write this but i really need to get this out of my chest

Hello. This is the first time I'm writing here, so I hope I'm not breaking any rules. Sorry mods if I do.  
I hope you're all well. This is my story. I just want to get it off my chest before everything collapses inside of me.  
This story took place on the harshly beautiful island of Folegandros. I was a chef at a small hotel. She was the daughter of the manager and a waitress at the restaurant of the hotel.

I'm 31 years old. Ten years ago, I had my first relationship. Kind of late to the party, I guess.  
We met at work. She was the daughter of the manager. At the time, she was 18, and I was 21 (it is legal in my country, Greece). We were working together, and she made something click inside of me, I guess.  
I'm a shy guy, kind of close to myself, and never really made a move on her. One day at work, something fell into my arm and kind of broke my pinky finger. I worked through it, but once the service was done, I went to a private place because I couldn't handle the pain anymore and didn't want to show the rest of the staff that I was in so much pain.  
She looked for me and brought me ice. That was the first time I talked to her a bit more outside of the usual friendly chat between coworkers. She caressed my hand and told me I needed a doctor. I said I was fine and told her not to worry. She stayed with me for 10-15 minutes, and after, we had to go back to work.  
All this time, she was pressing my hand with the ice. I felt great emotionally.  
For the first time, I was in love.

After a few days, I got the courage and messaged her on Facebook at 2 o'clock in the night:

""what are you doing awake at this hour?""  
She replied:  
HER: ""I just got out of the shower, what about you?""  
ME: ""I was thinking that I never said thank you for the other night.""  
HER: ""Well, better late than never."" (It's something we say in Greece.)  
ME: ""Want to go for a coffee in the morning?""  
HER: ""I have to be at the reception desk in the morning, but I'm free at night after the restaurant closes.""  
ME: ""So, wanna go for a drink to 'xxxxxx'?""  
HER: ""Of course.""  
We chatted a bit more through messages and eventually said goodnight to one another.  
The next day, I saw her at her desk as I was going to the restaurant to prepare breakfast for the hotel guests. We both had an idiotic smile on our faces.  
The hours passed really fast, and eventually, we finished work. At 11 o'clock at night, we were both in our rooms getting ready. I still remember how anxious I was, even though this was supposed to be just friends having drinks.  
We arrived at the bar, and I remember that she sat first on one side of the couch, and I sat on the other side, far away. About three more people could fit between us to sit. I was afraid. We had two cocktails, and two more after that, chatted a lot, and after some time, she told me to come and sit near her while laughing at the fact that I was so far away. After a few minutes, my heart was pumping so hard and fast. I eventually got the courage to touch her hand, and once I did, she shouted ""FINALLY,"" smiled at me sweetly, and we kissed.  
I will skip the part of our relationship. Things were great for both of us.  
Nine months later, difficult circumstances on both our sides made things extremely tough on us. My dad had cancer, and she had to study for university. We had no time for each other. Eventually, we ended the relationship. I was devastated. But I found joy in knowing that now she would have time to succeed in her life.  
Anyway, as time went by, her image and her aura, let's say, never left my head, but I was dealing with it somewhat with help from a close friend of mine.  
But EVERY DAY was a struggle emotionally.

We met again 5 years later. I was with another girl, and she was with another man. I was working at the same place, and she came for work as well. I knew she would eventually come, and I was confident that I would be cool with it.  
The moment I saw her, my insides became lava. My eyes teared up, and I had a burning sensation to just hug her as hard as I could. It wasn’t something sexual. I just wanted to feel her in my arms again. Anyway, we chatted a bit and went on our way.  
After a few days of working with her and my girlfriend at the time (she is my wife now) at the same place, I became a bit more relaxed, and things were well. One night, all the staff decided to go for drinks. So, about 15 people, we went to a bar and had some nice drinks. At one point, I got a bit emotional and wanted to leave. I said goodnight to everyone and left the place. My mind was so out of place, I didn’t kiss my girlfriend goodnight.  
My girlfriend (we were together for about a month at the time) came to my place afterward. She was sad, but eventually, we talked it through. I said I was sorry, explained to her what was happening, and she just hugged me and said, ""It's okay.""  
A few days later, I needed a lift to work, and the only one with a car was my ex. She told me to get breakfast before leaving to catch up. I told this to my girlfriend, and she said, ""As long as you trust yourself to not betray me, go ahead.""  
We went for breakfast at a cute place and had a chat. We discussed why we ended the relationship. She told me that she was sorry and regretted it. She told me that if I came back to the island the next year, she would still want to get together with me again. She told me that if we weren't in a relationship right now, she would hop into my hug the moment she saw me.  
I can't describe what I felt at the time. I was happy and sad.  
Days, weeks, and months passed, and the summer season ended. We parted ways.

Fast forward, 5 years later, my girlfriend is now my wife, and we just had our newborn daughter. She is one month old. I love them both.

About one week ago, I saw her(my ex) in my dreams. She was crying a lot and looking at me with her hand towards me as if she was trying to reach me. I was trying to run to her but the more I ran, the further away she was getting. I woke up in a sweat and trembling. Ever since that day, I’ve had the same dream almost every night. I have this burning desire now to message her and ask, ""How are you, etc.?"" but I haven't done it. And i wont do it

Four days ago, I saw her on an Instagram story holding a gift from one of her friends, saying ""MAMA"" or in other words, ""MOM."" She is pregnant. I'm happy for her. Honestly, I want all the best for her and all her family. I wanted to message her to congratulate her, but I didn’t do it. I thought it would be weird.

I feel as if no matter what I do in my life, a big part of me will always be with her, for her and i dont know how to move on.",2,1735201745.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

It’s actually been really good value for the price but I’ve been looking forward to upgrade it for a while.

My wife paid attention during my conversation with a barista and took note that Fellow was a good brand to upgrade to. She ended up buying a Fellow Ode because it’s “the good one” not realizing it would not be so good for espresso.

The thing is, I’m really in love with the grinder, and our espresso machine is ok but not great (a Delonghi dedica), so I’m really considering taking this as a sign from the universe and move on to drip coffee. She got a great deal for the grinder and bought it at Opus price, and I really like the quality and feel of it. It’s such an impressive machine.

I’ve been thinking about how James Hoffman and other professional baristas actually don’t recommend getting an espresso machine for home. I really like drip coffee and do V60 at least once a week so maybe I can get a Sage or a Moccamaster for the daily coffee. I usually take espresso with milk but drip coffee is a delight in itself, found myself drinking one cup for pleasure and then my usual “waking up cup” with milk every time I do V60.

So that’s the dilemma, got a grinder that’s not really my thing right now but could become. I’ll probably never go “full professional kit” on espresso so my idea was to upgrade my grinder and think about a better machine (~1k€) maybe in a year or two. This present made me rethink everything, which makes it even more awesome as a present, in my mind. I can always go back to exploring espresso in the future.

I kind of already have an idea of what I might do but would love to read some other nerds like me insights on this, and see if I’m doing the right call.",2,1735201590.0,SpecialtyCoffee,1,1.0,False

Why do Americans have such strong opinions about full face coverage and shit on DOT certification while praising ECE certification?  

It just seems so silly to me that people pile on safety gear to ride their motorcycle above the speed limit while shitting on anything that is not Japanese or American and it appears to be a widely accepted behavior.  

In China, and probably a lot of other southeast Asian countries, there are far more riders there. Real riders, not just weekend warrior types. People who use their motorcycle for literally everything as their main source of transportation for years on end. Motorcycle taxis are a regular thing and cost less than $1. Over there, people typically choose a minimalist helmet or half face helmet from a local shop at the equivalent of less than $100 USD, often less than half that, if they wear a helmet at all.  

Before you downvote me, because I know that's going to happen, keep in mind I'm talking about downtown city area and suburban neighborhood area riding, not crosscountry touring, off roading, or anything that involves a highway really.  

If the motorcycle community stopped acting like complete idiots maybe we could get rid of helmet laws in areas with a speed limit less than 55mph or something reasonable. It's your head. Why should I have to wear a helmet because you want to?...idk... That would be pretty nice IMO.  Going down the street meet some friends at a coffee shop or out to the grocery store down the street to grab a gallon of milk shouldn't require a helmet. It's overkill.

Infact at the party I was the only one having a fun, positive conversation and I was given amazing compliments by everyone over the way I was dressed. So I felt confident the entire night. The girl I found attractive,  lets call her X.

X was sitting with my female school buddies whom i know. I was chatting with all 4 of them and making them laugh. The entire mood was that of a positive, hilarious one. I saw X laughing as well but I wasn't sure if she found me attractive. Fast forward to a drinking game where she and many other were targeting me to get drunk but in a fun and light manner. At that point I thought she was interested in me so I asked about her relationship situation and she was single. 
Next mornign I sent her an instagram follow request and she sent one back. I thought I was in so I messaged her, telling her that J found her attractive and asked her for a cup of coffee. Its been a week and she hasnt responded.

I asked my friend and she said she found me ""creepy""

Infact at the party I was the only one having a fun, positive conversation and I was given amazing compliments by everyone over the way I was dressed. So I felt confident the entire night. The girl I found attractive,  lets call her X.

X was sitting with my female school buddies whom i know. I was chatting with all 4 of them and making them laugh. The entire mood was that of a positive, hilarious one. I saw X laughing as well but I wasn't sure if she found me attractive. Fast forward to a drinking game where she and many other were targeting me to get drunk but in a fun and light manner. At that point I thought she was interested in me so I asked about her relationship situation and she was single. 
Next mornign I sent her an instagram follow request and she sent one back. I thought I was in so I messaged her, telling her that J found her attractive and asked her for a cup of coffee. Its been a week and she hasnt responded.

I asked my friend and she said she found me ""creepy""

This is honestly the first time I'm hearing about this myself and has thrashed all confidence in me to apporach another girl. 

Be as open and honest what did I do wrong???? I'm really open to constructive criticism

TL;DR was I really creepy or am I overthinking?",0,1735200839.0,relationships,28,0.43,False

And the only other episode i remember was this coffee that was made by aliens to control the town. With these plot lines they all came together to create a bigger mystery.",1,1735200733.0,tipofmytongue,4,1.0,False
