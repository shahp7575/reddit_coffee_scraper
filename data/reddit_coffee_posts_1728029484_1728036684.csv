1fvvnf8,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongevityEssentials/comments/1fvvnf8/coffee_benefit_or_harm/,Coffee: Benefit or Harm?,"
1. Type of Coffee: With Caffeine or Decaf
   - If you prefer decaf, most caffeine-related effects are irrelevant.
   - If you drink caffeinated coffee, read on:

2. Genotype
   - Coffee's effects depend heavily on genetics:
     1. For some, it boosts alertness.
     2. For others, it may cause drowsiness.
     3. Some experience cramps or other negative reactions, including rapid heart rate.
   - People with the latter reactions should avoid coffee. Since my genotype makes coffee energizing, the following advice is based on that experience. If your genotype differs, do your own research.

3. Gallbladder
   - Caffeine stimulates bile secretion:
     - This can theoretically be beneficial if you lack bile, especially after a fatty meal, as espresso can aid digestion.
     - It‚Äôs harmful if you have gallstones or an overactive gallbladder. In cases of duodenal reflux, bile may enter the stomach, disrupting its acid balance.
   - Coffee's impact on the gallbladder may also depend on genotype.

4. Stomach
   - Coffee stimulates hydrochloric acid production:
     - This can be helpful after a heavy meal, aiding digestion.
     - However, if you have an ulcer or gastritis, coffee can worsen the condition.
     - It may also aggravate heartburn, even without coffee.

5. Sleep
   - Caffeine blocks adenosine receptors, which signal fatigue and the need for sleep.
   - Caffeine's half-life is about 6 hours. Drinking coffee at 4 p.m. is equivalent to half a cup of coffee at 10 p.m.
   - A common recommendation for people with Genotypes I and III is not to drink coffee after 12 p.m. if you plan to sleep between 9 and 11 p.m. Genotype II people ‚Äì share your experiences in the comments!

6. Calories
   - Adding syrups, milk, or sugar to coffee can lead to extra calories, increasing the risk of prediabetes, high cholesterol, and cardiovascular diseases.
   - If you drink black coffee, this isn‚Äôt a concern.

7. Social Aspect
   - An interesting and under-discussed fact: social isolation is one of the top risk factors for death, even more dangerous than smoking 15 cigarettes a day or consuming six alcoholic drinks.
   - For people whose social lives revolve around coffee shops, quitting coffee may disrupt their social environment, potentially leading to isolation, which significantly raises health risks.

8. Financial Aspect
   - If coffee boosts your productivity, it can lead to increased earnings.
   - People who earn more tend to live longer.
   - Personal experience: drinking coffee every morning, I notice my productivity increases by 15-50%. This helps me accomplish more tasks.

9. Historical Aspect
   - Coffeehouses became popular in Turkey, where aristocrats and scholars met to discuss ideas and create businesses. In Saudi Arabia, where there are still no bars, this tradition continues: successful people meet over coffee for business discussions.

10.Overall Safety
   - Studies on the benefits and risks of coffee are often contradictory. However, doctors and scientists agree that 1-2 cups of espresso a day are safe and may even reduce risks of high cholesterol, dementia, and other diseases.
   - After 5 cups a day, health risks increase significantly for most people.

11.Water
   - Caffeine is a diuretic. One espresso removes about 100-200 ml of water from the body.
   - Therefore, it‚Äôs recommended to drink 2 glasses of water before coffee to avoid dehydration. Lack of water can negatively affect your kidneys.

12.Hormones
   - Caffeine increases adrenaline and cortisol levels, which can lead to stress and disrupt circadian rhythms.
   - It's recommended not to drink coffee during the first hour after waking up, as this can intensify stress, negatively affecting the body.
   - For some people, excessive coffee consumption may cause morning fatigue due to adrenal exhaustion.

13.Personal Experience
   - I love coffee and drink one cup of black coffee at 10:00 a.m.
   - I prefer coffee from Sumatra, Honduras, and Rwanda, with fermented or natural processing. Usually, it's black coffee (filter or espresso) with a dosage of 15-20 g per cup.
   - After drinking one cup, I feel alert and don't experience fatigue. However, if I drink more (for example, 2 cups or coffee with tea or cocoa), I feel tired the next day

I'm 19, and was a big coffee drinker, however it get to the point where i will drink another cup of coffee (either at lunch or in the morning) and just go to sleep like it's nothing, feeling constantly sleepy even though i had 8h of sleep and 10 during weekends since i was passing out during the day. Low concentration, shaking hands and feet, chest pain before bed. I'm coffee free 3 weeks already, lots of sugar cravings, and still feeling sleepy no matter what, the sleepiness is the same as when i was drinking coffee, only the chest pain and the shaking are almost gone.

I went to the doctor and he gave me antidepressants and magnesium until i do my blood tests. I have to point out, for the span of 2 years i had on average 6h of sleep, constant coffee, high stress levels and self harm, most of my childhood i was what you would call ""depressed"", but i don't want to diagnose myself since i'm not a specialist. However, after i moved out  (3 months ago) i am the calmest i've ever been, sleeping 8h, stress free and my surrounding is peaceful.

I write this at 4:35am after going 2-3 months off caffeine after 2 years of moderate caffeine consumption and deciding yesterday and the day before to have a smidge of caffeine to help break a tiredness spell I‚Äôve been in. Now I‚Äôm completely flipped, complete lack of tiredness, and most of the typical caffeine side effects like anxiety and other mental side effects. I‚Äôm going to stay up 48 hours now because of 88mg one day and 44mg the next. That‚Äôs really nothing, that‚Äôs a total of 3 cups of green tea to complete destroy a sleep schedule and flip and mood. As someone who‚Äôs done nearly every drug except ones you put in your arm, there‚Äôs no way that little caffeine should have that big of an impact, I don‚Äôt believe the average caffeine drinker has that much of a impact on them. 
This is not just because of the break either, this is what always happens and why I quit, I guess I didn‚Äôt expect it to only take two days to get that complete 180. 
It makes me wonder if I and maybe some others here just metabolize this thing differently than normal people. Maybe 1 cup of coffee to me is the equivalent of 3-5 to a coffee lover who has little side effects. 
The problem then is also that when you start out and don‚Äôt know and your first experience is just actually getting high off of caffeine, which I have most definitely done by consuming 250-300mg+. Not high like adderall but shitty cocaine that instead of making you feel cool you just feel more nervous and instead of a big up and down it‚Äôs just a moderate lift for 24 hours. 

Bit of a ramble but food for thought. Going to quit again and maybe try taking microdoses with good instant coffee to see if there is a bottom line minimum dose to wear I can get some of the mental clarity without the side effects. ",1,1728035662.0,decaf,2,1.0,False

1fvvexl,https://www.reddit.com/r/migraine/comments/1fvvexl/flavonoids_quercetin_coffee_trigger_migraine_with/,Flavonoids (Quercetin) - Coffee Trigger (Migraine with Aura),"Hi all,

For many years I have suffered from migraines with aura with nasty symptoms such as vomiting etc. I became useless for several days after an episode occurred and would have to go home from work. I was a big coffee drinker (x3 daily), I just love the taste. I switched to decaf due to worry over migraines and well I'd still get the migraines.

Because the episodes became severe I decided to cut coffee completely and well I am now 2 years migraine free!

BUT, one day I started quercetin supplements for an unrelated issue and bang, 2hrs later migraine with aura! Quercetin is also in red wine which gives me headaches.

I have read that coffee contains quercetin which is interesting and would explain why decaf causes me migraines too, many believe it is the caffeine but I don't believe that is true.

In the past I have tried different brands of coffee, especially Starbucks which never gave me a migraine decafe or regular. I also now drink mountains of Coke zero which contains caffeine and I am 2 years migraine free.

This is totally random but it might help somebody with their triggers! Basically, I have cut out most quercetin containing foods/drinks and certainly in combination with alcohol, I am pretty much cured.

Recently got a Timemore Sculptor 078, having upgraded from a Wilfa Uniform. I have to say, so far I have been pretty underwhelmed. I was of course not expecting double the increase in cup quality, given the more than double the cost of the grinder... however at least marginal gains more than 5-10% would've been expected (this is of course subjective).

In side by side comparisons I can barely tell the difference. One cupping I did, the 078 edged it slightly with a bit more juicy-ness (albeit faintly). Using a different coffee I even found the Uniform came out on top, with more pronounced flavours...

Could it just be down the user? I.e. my pallette, technique blah blah. Or perhaps there's something I'm missing? My understanding is the 078 doesn't require burr alignment, however wondering if it requires seasoning perhaps?

Grinding at a relatively coarse setting (10+) and at the slowest RPM, I still find what seem to be quite a few fines in my V60 after the pour...

Any insight from 078 owners would be greatly appreciated here!",1,1728035223.0,pourover,2,1.0,False

We feel regret and pain when we continue down paths that aren't good for us, but something keeps pulling us back. It's like we're caught in a loop‚Äîthe longer we stay in it, the deeper we go.

Because we're holding onto things that don't serve us‚Äîbe it habits or relationships‚Äîthey linger in our subconscious, draining the energy we need to grow and thrive. We're all here to grow, but many of us don't realize our full potential because we're stuck in this cycle.

But deep down, we know it's just an excuse. This self-deception is dangerous; it keeps us trapped, and before we know it, we've lost sight of what's real and what's not.

The amazing thing about the human brain is its neuroplasticity‚Äîthe ability to rewire itself. You can change your thought patterns and break free from what's holding you back.

Think about how you learned to walk‚Äîyou practiced until it became second nature, and now you don't even think about it. The same goes for habits, both good and bad.

The truth is, we all know where to begin when it comes to fixing our lives. The real challenge is overcoming the fear of change. We stay in our comfort zones, clinging to what we know, even if it's harming us. This is where the ego comes in. The ego craves comfort and runs from pain. It wants to avoid anything difficult, keeping us stuck. But once you realize that you are in control‚Äînot your ego‚Äîyou can start to shift things. There will always be a struggle between you and your ego, but the more conscious you become of it, the more power you'll have to change.

Start small. When you wake up, notice that voice in your head‚Äîthe one that tells you what to do, replays old memories, or makes you worry about the future. Don't judge it; just observe it.

1fvv7qt,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1fvv7qt/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

1fvv66a,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepThoughts/comments/1fvv66a/we_often_hold_onto_destructive_habits_and_toxic/,"We often hold onto destructive habits and toxic relationships, even when we know they no longer serve us.","We all know, deep down, what's not quite right in our lives and where we need to make changes. Often, it's about breaking destructive habits or stepping away from toxic relationships. We feel regret and pain when we continue down paths that aren't good for us, but something keeps pulling us back. It's like we're caught in a loop‚Äîthe longer we stay in it, the deeper we go.

Because we're holding onto things that don't serve us‚Äîbe it habits or relationships‚Äîthey linger in our subconscious, draining the energy we need to grow and thrive. We're all here to grow, but many of us don't realize our full potential because we're stuck in this cycle.

Sometimes, we create stories in our minds to justify our actions. We tell ourselves there's a logical reason for our unhealthy habits or toxic relationships. But deep down, we know it's just an excuse. This self-deception is dangerous; it keeps us trapped, and before we know it, we've lost sight of what's real and what's not.

The amazing thing about the human brain is its neuroplasticity‚Äîthe ability to rewire itself. You can change your thought patterns and break free from what's holding you back. It takes effort, but it's possible. Most of what we do is automatic, driven by our subconscious. Think about how you learned to walk‚Äîyou practiced until it became second nature, and now you don't even think about it. The same goes for habits, both good and bad. They've become automatic, running in the background without us even realizing it. So much of what we do is on autopilot. Just like some people head straight to the coffee machine every morning because they've been doing it for decades.

The truth is, we all know where to begin when it comes to fixing our lives. The real challenge is overcoming the fear of change. We stay in our comfort zones, clinging to what we know, even if it's harming us. This is where the ego comes in. The ego craves comfort and runs from pain. It wants to avoid anything difficult, keeping us stuck. But once you realize that you are in control‚Äînot your ego‚Äîyou can start to shift things. There will always be a struggle between you and your ego, but the more conscious you become of it, the more power you'll have to change.

Without diving too deep into quantum physics, there's a concept called the Observer Effect, which suggests that simply observing something can change its behavior. This applies to your mind as well. By becoming aware of your thoughts‚Äîobserving them without judgment‚Äîyou can begin to change the way your mind works over time.

Start small. When you wake up, notice that voice in your head‚Äîthe one that tells you what to do, replays old memories, or makes you worry about the future. Don't judge it; just observe it. Notice the patterns and how they link to the habits that hold you back. As you become more aware, you'll start to break the cycle.

This is a huge topic, and there's so much more to explore. I didn't want to overwhelm you, but I hope this gives you a place to start. I'll keep reflecting on ways to dive deeper into this in the future.

I'm curious‚Äîwhat are some habits or thought patterns you'd like to change? Have you noticed any ""loops"" in your life that keep repeating? How might becoming more aware of your thoughts help you break free from them?

Feel free to share your thoughts or ask any questions. I'm here to listen and help if I can!

They‚Äôre not coffee snobs. They drink higher end supermarket coffee in a cafeti√®re or they have nespresso.

Can anyone speak from experience here? I feel these machines are a scam: if you are a coffee snob you‚Äôll brew your own espresso or just have aeropress etc. And if you aren‚Äôt a coffee snob you can survive fine on nespresso plus a frother. I just don‚Äôt get what these machines offer.

They're full of flowers, fruits, and boars ‚Äî wild chocolatt-ey mudded texture on them with silly drool on them big noses. Sipping his already empty bottle rum. He continued, ‚ÄúI like it that way, it‚Äôs nice if i‚Äôve to find some left, unearthed, untouched even memories, i‚Äôd just have to venture into the woods, or tame the right monkey, or pick the healthy leaves. It‚Äôs really‚Äì untouched, so it must be there‚Äù He then takes his match, lights a candle by his side on the table (he‚Äôs still standing perhaps at the time), ‚Äú I might seen you somewhere‚Äù Coughing, ‚Äú I‚Äôve to search more‚Äù.
 I observed the confined room. Not too spacious that you can fit a piano, but not too steep clearly that you can have a round coffee table with four stools and move moderate spaces to fill in. Flower pot with a single withered flower ‚Äî Or that it seemed to be that way. The place has carpets attached to the floor, assuming this i‚Äôd think that he had a vacuum because of how strangely spotless his carpet from dusts and dusks. Some sketches, dessan framed at the back of me, just beside the front door with spotlights hovering their light to the beautiful figures depicting what I could think of a woman in a ballet stand, a girl perhaps.. Another dessan i can't clearly depict is deciphering what the silhouette is but it seemed to be in agony but yet it resembles nothingness, something shouldn't be there, something that does not exist. Anyway the guy must be a painter or an artist of some sort in the hellish warfare. Maybe the old gag that tried to do a duff or two to me on his door when I knocked on his is an artist let it be he's an unpopular and some underground artist surviving on 600 dollars per month. And to this clothes were shabby, but the silhouette makes him get the impression of a fashion enthusiast. The way he positioned his clothes, accessories and the spot of paints that stained him were magnificent like it supposed to be there, fated. The gag had a black tee and some necklaces and a locket. A simple ragged dark gray beanie placed not too his receding baldness and its shape, shaped. He had some high waisted cream coloured, obviously rummaged carpenter pants, and there's a branding tag on the back‚Äî blurred though. The old guy had some thick boots, no branding for sure. The man was tall, towering everybody when i tried to get his address(cabs were usually wrong and some sort of a scam) He showed up and starts to be acknowledge the note that was given incredible tall, at the time at least, thick blushes of eyebrows something i've always wished of, although almost all of it is in white hairs, some of it‚Äôs strands is blacks, maybe he's some 50‚Äôs guys, at the time i planned to bring back the stories are from 3 decades ago, so if my predictions were correct, he must be in his twenties. He's old for sure but looking quite muscular, and energetic  though his deep, hazy and sharp eyes say otherwise. He had that strand of wiggly whitening hari when he greeted me by lifting his Hanshin Tigers cap(I don't know anything about the club name it seemed but in the past i saw a poster in a bin imposing supposedly the same logo with the name hanshin tigers) with heartwarming lines smile.

We stared at each other ofr a good half hour, observing each other‚Äôs characteristics as his sharp, dark pupils shaped my silhouette front he top of the head to the bottom of the waist ‚Äî seemingly scanning for available firearms as one would soldiers' instincts are. What'd you expect them to lower their guard just because you're a journalist, a searcher of information? They might think that the lose their life that's on a killing spree of a dozen or more in the war to some middle aged drunk married guy like me.
‚ÄúSo i'm afraid, i don't have coffee with me really, im such a bad host. Just beer, is that okay?‚Äù While handing me  his cheap looking wooden cup, celetapes around the bottom of it. ‚ÄúThis cup had been through a lot‚Äù I quickly put what he said onto the notebook. And a question rose form it‚Äî What is it with the cup? Did you make it while you're in the East? Searching in the woods, then no state things to hold so a cup he made, because this looks handmade with no tools atall. 
‚ÄúSure, gramps‚Äù
We drank a few.

#

Did you ever drink any tea? While toying with his cup. He continued, ‚Äúif ive had one, it was in the middle of spring, where flowers blooms. One of my comrades would happen to be just back from the‚Äì‚Äù He seemed cloud full, ‚ÄúThe East‚Äù, coughing, ‚ÄúThe most of East and surprisingly brought stocks of red, binged aromatic liquor. He stopped a second then continued,
‚ÄúOur first thought that were obviously wine, what else could we think? Now informations peaked once again, but to us abc then, if it‚Äôs still and flat out transparent, it‚Äôs a mineral water‚Äù Then he giggled a bit while i listened to his rantings soundly, ‚Äúif it‚Äôs orange type or some other way the same tone- family, its wine or something‚Äù He seemed to have finished. ‚ÄúDo you get?‚Äù Seeking affirmation.
I just nodded and quickly‚Äì perhaps hastily noted:

East, got some teas, first thought; Beers

‚ÄúHave you tasted one?‚Äù
‚ÄúNo, as much as i can remember‚Äù
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs normal‚Äù.‚ÄùThem East we beated them so hard after the Sign we agreed that they will not associate with us no longer‚Äù

‚ÄúHow would you picture yourself?‚Äù
‚ÄúHm?‚Äù He ponders real hard for like 3 minutes, every second feel a lifetime. There‚Äôs a difference between veterans and ones in the house at the time like house wifes and others. Normally they‚Äôd  cry if they opened up this kind of topic; But soldiers are insanely chill. Atleast in meetings with them.
‚ÄúI know‚Äù Finally.
‚ÄúSo what would you picture yourself?‚Äù
‚ÄúDeath‚Äù, stutters, ‚ÄúLoss‚Äù More confusion in his face, ‚ÄúConfusion?‚Äù
You dont seem like that‚Äù Of course i can predict that he‚Äôs going to say.
‚ÄúMen are supposed to be tough‚Äù
Bingo. Surely this old gag is a man of ‚Äúfew‚Äù words.
‚ÄúWhat was it like being in war?‚Äù
Eyes so sharp penetrated my skillful observation to pieces. Again, I asked, ‚ÄúWhat was it like being in the war?‚Äù
He murmured something while lowering his eyes. Sure I‚Äôd thought he‚Äôd thought, then rose to the stool while his left hand slightly touched the flame at the candle. His right hand holding a can of beer he picked and drank it, his position yet like a ballerina with just one leg still on the stool, ragged, and the other one bending towards the calves of his left leg, while his fingers were burning, and into beer he‚Äôs drunk old bird, he yearns, ‚ÄúThis, is, wa-‚Äù Thus, fell on the floor.
What was this man thinking?
I'll sketch the figure.

#

‚ÄúDo you get ?‚Äù
‚ÄúThe point is that it's ridiculous right?‚Äù
Silent streaks and his penetrating eyes sharpen my instinct.
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs childish comprehension. What do they teach these guys?‚Äù A bit turned his voice‚Äì‚ÄùThink monkey, think‚Äù while laughing then and beers snuggling from his mouth.

#

5 minutes has passed. I rose up while seeing him bandaging himself of burn injury with rough towels, and spoke, ‚ÄúThe hand‚Äôs on the candle means that you're going to ‚Äúburn‚Äù someone else‚Äôs family if that you killed enemies, but beers on you right hand symbolizes that the bad destroyed the good, and you don't have a choice‚Äù
‚ÄúThere's more right?‚Äù
‚ÄúYa‚Äù
‚ÄúKeep going‚Äù
‚ÄúThe ballerina stand is like a chore you need to, perchance getting skilled of getting flames on your skin and picking bottles to drink‚Äî symbolizes that of the technique of killing. Did I get it right?‚Äù
While putting back his rummaged cup, he applauded, ‚ÄúYou're a smart boy, certainly a good impression‚Äù, ‚ÄúLet  me tell you some moments ive had in the warfare then‚Äù

#

He took a black piece of cloth on his left side of the sofa and then asks me to get closer. ‚ÄúAre you ready?‚Äù, 
‚ÄúYes‚Äù He positioned my body so that i became vulnerable at my instinct he's trying to do something bad, just because he‚Äôs at my body, out of my reach. Then he stretched the cloth and tampered it to my eyes and slipped up a simple, but tight knot, ‚ÄúNow find me me while im going to snuggle yo some gags‚Äù, while laughing.
The view was dark, I couldn't say it had not a single beam of light entered since 100 plus seconds ago. (I didn't count, but I know it's 100 seconds or more ago or perhaps 1000 seconds ago) And I too careful a step as to find this strange old guy wearing some ancient Hanshin Tigers cap. After a time,;\
‚ÄúGulp!‚Äù My neck was beheaded , and choked. Panicked and pull the hands out, trying of course. But no strength was there. The chef must be there, cooking something, while I ordered a plate of Bolognese at an Italian restaurant. Not some video games decided to unexisting the blind spot. That speck, oh that speck of believeness of God rose like a goddamn spirit while they sprinted from my body in dreams.
That speck of believeness on God is perhaps one of the most natural ways in humans. Just like the need to eat, the need to drink and so on. I've accepted this early on.
He lifted the cloth out of me.
While coughing, I said ‚ÄúWhat the fuck, gramps?‚Äù At this time, its like death and life became so indistinct my hands didn't feel a thought grudging my fist on the old guy‚Äôs warm chest.
‚ÄúRelax‚Äù Smirking, ‚ÄúIt's just playtime‚Äù Then pushed my fist away. ‚ÄúBut let's imagine that you're blindfolded for hours in a deep, dark, forest. Then God decided to just ‚ÄúLets just make him die‚Äù Then he died. How‚Äôs that huh?‚Äù
I tried to think about that, but my mind sucks right now i'm going to move to next topic, ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs life after the war?‚Äù
‚ÄúAllowances from the government, fucked up things is, is that the more year passes the less money you‚Äôve given. So if i‚Äôd gone back to the old happy tie before the war, i might migrate toa whole other continent, living in southeast who turned to be one of the most civilized countries right at the moment, also peaceful as hell. Missed those times when we were clubbing picking up some bitches without having to be afraid to die, y‚Äôknow?‚Äù
‚ÄúAbout war, when you're at the brink of death and the East decides against you on the battlefield, what‚Äôs your thought?
He closed his eyes for a moment, then, he placed it on the candle‚Äôs flame to light it, and sweep through his mouth hsi cigs and blow the ashes right at his nostrils, then blow it. I used to be a cig addict but rose against it because my late dead wife said no about it, ‚ÄúIt's bad for your health, Tom!‚Äù or ‚ÄúIt's a waste of money!‚Äù, and now never had the urge to hit it anymore. But the scene I've laid into‚Äî making me crave some of those. Like a psychic;
‚ÄúYou want some?‚Äù
And cigs together we smoked.

#

While in deep nicotine he said, ‚ÄúA lot of time people just think they're going to die. As soldiers, we knew we had to die at some point, and thought of trying to believe something‚Äî that's just nature, everyone believes in something. We humans apparently set to believe in something‚Äì‚Äù
And i think he's drunk at this speech, ‚ÄúDon't be bullshitting saying that makes me a theist thus my opinions are invalid. Saying you need to be unbiased is against the natural since humans have believes whether we like it or not‚Äù
‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs what?‚Äù
What?‚Äù
‚ÄúNothing‚Äù I think I was geeked too.
‚ÄúI found this saying; To be open minded to everything is to go against everything. To be open minded to everything is to believe in nothing‚Äù

#

Clock struck at half past 12 when we ended our long, deep conversation(or not so deep) and some imaginative analogies. We exchanged names. His name is ‚ÄúNicholas‚Äù and to the door I stepped in and went on a ride back home.
‚ÄúGood painting‚Äù were my last words.

#

That was 2 decades ago, I made a name for myself shortly after the meetings I had with the gramps for the literature world and had gained some awards for my works. I may have been one of the prodigy writers created to discard the numbing post-war depression. The first book published was just 2 month after my visit to the old gramps and It hit so hard in the market that i've more time on the desk rather to the gras, and the more less time to think about any uploading some historical works.So I totally forgot about my encounter with the gramps. But, as he said, minds like some underground deep forests full of habitat. You just have to find it, or perhaps encounter it surprisingly. I remember I had a whole journal or keywords about crazy old gals. Of course, I'm an old grandpa right now with 2 children and 4 grandchildren at the moment, sort of a niche happy life. Afterward, I found the journal when I opened up my boxes of leftover works.
And of course, I went back to the address and nobody was there, the buildings too renovated from the post war development. Things had changed. I haven't found out if he is a painter, or he had a wife or not, what is it with the cup or so others.
I hope I get to know it all, probably won‚Äôt.

From smart homes and wearable devices to industrial machinery and connected vehicles, the Internet of Things (IoT) is transforming how we interact with the physical world. Meanwhile, the rise of Web3, powered by decentralized technologies like blockchain and smart contracts, is redefining how we manage data, create value, and build trustless systems. Now, these two powerful trends are converging, unlocking new possibilities for a smarter, decentralized future.

As IoT and Web3 come together, they are laying the groundwork for a new digital economy where devices, data, and value are exchanged seamlessly, without centralized intermediaries. This convergence is enabling more secure, transparent, and autonomous interactions across industries. In this article, we‚Äôll explore how the integration of Web3 and IoT is building a decentralized future, its potential impact, and the key challenges that lie ahead.

# Understanding Web3 and IoT: A Quick Primer

Before diving into how these technologies are merging, it‚Äôs important to understand what they are and how they work:

* **Internet of Things (IoT)**¬†refers to the network of physical devices embedded with sensors, software, and connectivity that allows them to communicate and exchange data over the internet. IoT devices can range from simple household items like smart thermostats and security cameras to complex industrial machines used in manufacturing and logistics.
* **Web3**¬†represents the next generation of the internet, built on decentralized technologies like blockchain, smart contracts, and decentralized applications (dApps). Web3 aims to create a trustless, user-owned internet where data and value are managed peer-to-peer without relying on central authorities.

# Why Web3 and IoT Need Each Other

While IoT has made significant progress in connecting devices and enabling real-time data collection, it faces several challenges that hinder its full potential. These include security vulnerabilities, privacy concerns, scalability issues, and a lack of interoperability. This is where Web3 comes in.

**Key Synergies Between Web3 and IoT:**

1. **Enhanced Security and Privacy:**¬†IoT devices are notoriously vulnerable to hacking and data breaches. By integrating blockchain and smart contracts, Web3 can provide a tamper-proof ledger for IoT data, ensuring that every interaction is securely recorded. Decentralized identity solutions can also enable devices to authenticate and communicate securely, protecting user privacy.
2. **Decentralized Data Ownership:**¬†In the current IoT model, data is often stored and managed by centralized cloud providers, giving them control over user data. Web3 can empower individuals and organizations to own and monetize their IoT data through decentralized data marketplaces, enabling more equitable data economies.
3. **Autonomous Operations:**¬†Smart contracts ‚Äî self-executing contracts written in code ‚Äî can automate interactions between IoT devices without human intervention. This allows devices to autonomously negotiate, transact, and even perform maintenance tasks, creating truly autonomous systems.
4. **Interoperability and Standardization:**¬†IoT suffers from fragmentation, with different manufacturers using incompatible protocols and data formats. By building on open Web3 standards, IoT devices can communicate across different networks, enhancing interoperability and reducing silos.

# Practical Use Cases of Web3 and IoT Integration

The convergence of Web3 and IoT is opening up new possibilities across industries, from smart cities and supply chains to energy grids and autonomous vehicles. Here are some of the most promising use cases:

# 1. Decentralized Smart Cities

Smart cities use IoT devices to manage everything from traffic flow and waste management to energy consumption and public safety. However, these systems are often centralized, making them susceptible to single points of failure and data manipulation.

With Web3, smart cities can leverage decentralized infrastructure to create a more resilient and transparent system. For instance, blockchain can be used to record and validate sensor data from public infrastructure, while smart contracts can automate services like street lighting or public transport schedules based on real-time data.

**Example:**¬†In a decentralized smart city, autonomous IoT sensors could detect a malfunctioning traffic light and initiate a repair request through a smart contract. Local service providers could bid for the repair job in a transparent, blockchain-based marketplace, ensuring cost efficiency and accountability.

# 2. Supply Chain Transparency and Automation

IoT devices are already used to track goods and monitor conditions throughout the supply chain. When combined with Web3, these devices can provide a verifiable and immutable record of every step in the supply chain, from raw materials to the final product. This enhances transparency, reduces fraud, and improves trust between suppliers, manufacturers, and consumers.

**Example:**¬†A coffee supply chain can use IoT sensors to monitor the temperature and humidity of coffee beans during transit. This data can be logged on a blockchain, allowing consumers to verify the origin and quality of their coffee. Smart contracts can also automate payments to farmers and transporters as milestones are reached.

# 3. Energy Grids and Decentralized Power Management

The energy sector is ripe for disruption by Web3 and IoT integration. IoT-enabled smart meters and sensors can monitor energy usage in real-time, while Web3 can enable peer-to-peer energy trading on decentralized marketplaces. This allows households with renewable energy sources, like solar panels, to sell excess energy directly to their neighbors without needing a centralized utility provider.

**Example:**¬†A neighborhood of homes equipped with solar panels could use IoT devices to track energy production and consumption. Smart contracts on a blockchain could facilitate energy trades, allowing homeowners to buy and sell electricity automatically based on their real-time needs.

# 4. Autonomous Vehicles and Machine-to-Machine Economies

As autonomous vehicles and connected machines become more common, there will be a need for these devices to interact, transact, and share resources autonomously. Web3 can enable¬†**machine-to-machine (M2M) economies**, where devices own wallets, earn revenue, and pay for services in real time.

**Example:**¬†An autonomous delivery drone could refuel itself at a charging station by negotiating the price and paying for energy using a digital wallet. Meanwhile, it could monetize the sensor data it collects on traffic patterns by selling it to urban planners through a decentralized data marketplace.

# 5. Healthcare and Remote Patient Monitoring

IoT devices in healthcare, such as wearable fitness trackers and remote monitoring devices, generate large amounts of sensitive data. Web3 can enable secure and private data sharing between patients, doctors, and researchers. Patients could choose to share specific health data in exchange for rewards, or use their data to participate in clinical research, with every transaction recorded transparently on a blockchain.

**Example:**¬†A diabetic patient‚Äôs glucose monitor could use blockchain to record readings and securely share this data with their doctor. If the patient opts in, anonymized data could also be shared with pharmaceutical companies for research, with the patient receiving compensation in cryptocurrency.

# The Challenges of Web3-IoT Integration

While the convergence of Web3 and IoT is promising, it is not without its challenges:

1. **Scalability Issues:**¬†IoT networks generate enormous amounts of data, and current blockchain networks struggle with throughput and latency. Scaling solutions like Layer 2 rollups and sharding will be crucial for supporting IoT at scale.
2. **Data Privacy and Compliance:**¬†Ensuring data privacy while maintaining the transparency of a blockchain is a delicate balance. Techniques like zero-knowledge proofs and encrypted data storage will need to be integrated to protect sensitive information.
3. **Interoperability:**¬†Integrating IoT devices across different Web3 platforms is complex, given the lack of standardization. Open protocols and cross-chain bridges will be needed to enable seamless interaction between devices and networks.
4. **Energy Consumption:**¬†Running IoT and blockchain systems simultaneously can be energy-intensive, particularly for resource-constrained IoT devices. Solutions like energy-efficient consensus mechanisms and edge computing will be vital.

# The Road Ahead: Building a Decentralized, Intelligent Ecosystem

The convergence of Web3 and IoT represents a paradigm shift that will fundamentally change how devices, data, and value interact in a digital economy. By leveraging the strengths of both technologies, we can build decentralized ecosystems that are more resilient, transparent, and user-centric.

As these technologies continue to mature, we can expect to see:

* **Decentralized Machine Economies:**¬†Autonomous devices that transact, negotiate, and optimize their operations without human intervention.
* **Smart Infrastructure:**¬†Intelligent public infrastructure that can self-manage and optimize its performance using real-time data.
* **Decentralized Data Marketplaces:**¬†Platforms where individuals and devices can buy, sell, and monetize data, with all interactions governed by smart contracts.

# Conclusion

The convergence of Web3 and IoT is building a smarter, more decentralized future. By combining the connectivity of IoT with the trustless, transparent nature of Web3, we can create systems that are not only more efficient but also fundamentally different from anything we‚Äôve seen before. As we move forward, the integration of these technologies will pave the way for new business models, services, and ways of interacting with the world around us.

1fvulpv,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1fvulpv/i_22f_am_considering_breaking_up_with_my/,I (22F) am considering breaking up with my boyfriend (24M) of 2 years for many reasons. What is the best thing to do in this situation?,"Ive been considering breaking up with my boyfriend for several reasons:
I remember when my bf of 3 years and I were talking about our future when he asked me how I'd react if his mom hit our child as a punishment. I asked him why, are we going to live with your mom? He fell silent. There were also times when his mom told me that her son wouldn't want to settle anywhere far from her if not actually living with her. She also mentions girls from his past and those who likes/d her son, and how rich they are (which I'm not). Listening to that always made me feel so bad and I had no choice but to endure it. It also pressured me into saying yes when shes asking to borrow some money. It was okay at first, but then it became a cycle and I always had a hard time having her pay me back. At one point, I let her borrow 10k which was really for my tuition fee. I told her I needed that before a certain date but that date came and she hasn't paid me back yet. The worst thing is that she asked me never to tell anyone, specially her son, that she's been borrowing from me because it's 'shameful"" for her. I heard how she talked about her relatives when they wouldn't let her utang and it was really not pleasing so I guess that's one of the things that made me give in aside from the fact that I want to help out.
My boyfriend also usually tells his mom our problems and I always come off as the bad person.
SHE said that his son said I'm just like my mom who's being abused because of our own generosity and it's stupid. I don't know if he really said that because I never confronted him but regardless if he did, it's already a problem. Aside from that, no matter how I made it clear that I don't want him telling someone else MY personal problems, I always end up finding out that he told his mom. There were many other instances that I felt backed up in a corner whenever we would have arguments in their home. What's worse is he is always able to say hurtful insults to me and he can always just leave me breaking down, specially in their own home. I was always crying and stressed out.
Now he went to the NCR for several months for his career and I'm left here. At first, he was keen at keeping his promise of calling me every night until it became rare. I always had to ask for him to call and it always felt like I'm just disturbing him. But he's consistently updating me so im trying to be more considerate and supportive of his endeavors.
I tried to keep my distance and boundaries from them but I always end up feeling guilty because Ilove my man and I wanted to make him happy. However, things happened and I'm finally starting to see things clearly. I gave up too much that all I'm left with is problems and the thought that maybe they don't really care for me. So for my well-being, lve been thinking about ending things with him but I'm not sure yet. He's been caring, generous and hasn't really done anything bad (and I really care for him). He was there for me most of the time and honestly, he's all Ive got here. He's the only one I can confide to and when we're in good terms, the only source of my comfort. On our first year together, he'd usually go through great lengths just to be with me and make me happy. He was always excited to talk and be with me. When we're not fighting, he'd always have coffee waiting for me in the morning before he leaves. He knows my favorites and always has treats that I love ready for me. His family also welcomed me warmly that's why I'm feeling a great deal of conscience for having these thoughts. He's thoughtful when he's not angry. I know he loves me but now I'm wondering if it's not enough to make him want to talk to me even for several seconds regularly. Is there anything I can do to make things right? I'm stuck and I don't know what to do but I know I want better.",1,1728031867.0,relationship_advice,3,0.67,False

So I own a Quickmill 3000, it has a build in grinder which I naturally came to regret over time ;). The double basket for this machine is a 14 gram one, it's usable up until 16 grams, above the pressure will rise quickly. The machine has no temperature control, there is an OPV mod available.

When making espresso I almost end up with a bigger ratio than I'm going for, or an unattainable amount of pressure. I will either grind a bit coarser and reach between 9/10 bars consistently with 16 grams of coffee, but will get about an 1:4/5 ratio, or I dial in one setting finer and end up with a ratio 1:3/4 but 12/14 bars. Lowering the dosage in the latter means the ratio will get messed up more. I want to be able to somewhat consistently get 1:3 ratio with 9/10 bars.

So I feel a bit stuck. I prep my puck with a needle distribution tool (and tamp of course). Would moving on to a stepless grinder (like a Timemore 064s) solve this issue, or would it be worth more to invest in a OPV mod for the machine.",1,1728031254.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

Claire Hanna will be a very different type of leader to Colum Eastwood. She doesn‚Äôt formally take up the reins until Saturday, but she‚Äôs already been out and about meeting SDLP councillors and voters in a range of constituencies.

Fermanagh, Newry and Armagh, and Strangford are just some of the places she has visited.

The South Belfast and Mid Down MP knows her party must be rebuilt from the bottom up if it‚Äôs to have any chance of holding its eight Assembly seats, let alone winning more.

Twenty years ago, every SDLP MLA had at least 50 activists in their constituency. If every elected representative had even 10 today, the party would be in a ‚Äúradically different position‚Äù, she says.

It‚Äôs hard for a party on the slide electorally to attract and retain recruits, but Hanna points to her own constituency, where the SDLP has 300 members ‚Äî ‚Äúa really diverse bunch aged from 15 to 75‚Äù.

It‚Äôs not just about recruiting people, it‚Äôs about having a coffee or a pint with them, offering them input on policy and strategy, and building a team, she says. By spring, every SDLP politician will have a newsletter out for their constituents.

As a people person, Hanna will excel in developing the long-missing sense of comradeship in the party.

Claire Hanna: ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not half-hearted about Irish unity, but mentioning it every day won‚Äôt make it happen‚Äô
Why SDLP members are optimistic of a Claire Hanna 'bounce' after 'hands-off' Colum Eastwood
She is hugely popular and a real grafter, but she faces an enormous challenge in trying to replicate the success she has enjoyed in South Belfast for the party in other constituencies. Until now, she has not been in Sinn Fein‚Äôs line of fire with an almost semi-independent, as opposed to party political, image in her constituency.

That will all change when she becomes SDLP leader, and she will face the same robustness and ruthlessness her predecessor faced.
Eastwood‚Äôs skillset includes having excellent political instincts, being a first-class communicator, and having the same ability to respond lightning quick on media to any given situation.
He made bold calls on naming Soldier F over his actions on Bloody Sunday in the House of Commons, and on boycotting the White House on St Patrick‚Äôs Day in protest at US support for Israel‚Äôs assault on Gaza.
On Saturday, at the SDLP‚Äôs annual conference in Belfast, power will formally change hands from the Foyle MP to Hanna. Eastwood is expected to announce her formal ratification as leader as he introduces her.

Hanna‚Äôs first act as leader-in-waiting was to kill off the SDLP‚Äôs conference dinner-dance. She‚Äôs opted for a more informal social evening rather than the traditional one.

Her speech will focus on the future. She will tell delegates that while the SDLP is rightly proud of its yesterdays, it must now concentrate solely on today and tomorrow.

She will speak about what being a centre-left party actually means now and in any new Ireland.

There is extensive goodwill towards Hanna in the party. Members and elected representatives were hungry for change. With Eastwood focusing on high-profile work with the New Ireland Commission, she will have to ensure she carves out her own prominent role going forward.",7,1728031074.0,northernireland,1,0.9,False

this approach reduces body, typical of comandante brews, but increases clarity and sweetness. i've tested various fermentations and roast developments, consistently preferring this method.

for more developed and fermented coffees, use a tighter ratio (1:14-1:15) with lower temps (85-90¬∞C). for washed, less developed coffees, go with 1:16 and higher brew temps. i found ratios above 1:17 start to extract bitterness.

this isn't a deterministic approach; results will vary slightly each time due to inconsistent fines adhesion. it won't match zp6 or pietro, but it brings more clarity to comandante brews.

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response‚Äîor lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

**Response to Prompt 12: Juxtaposition**

In the bustling metropolis of Neon City, skyscrapers touched the heavens, their dazzling lights reflecting off the sleek surfaces of futuristic cars. Yet, nestled within this urban jungle, an ancient relic stood defiantly‚Äîthe Old Grove Park.

As I strolled through the city's concrete arteries, the juxtaposition between the modernity of Neon City and the timeless serenity of the park became increasingly apparent. The cacophony of traffic was replaced by the rustling of leaves and the distant laughter of children playing.

The central conflict emerged when the city council, embodying the epitome of order, proposed transforming the park into a technologically advanced hub. The juxtaposition intensified as architects discussed plans for holographic playgrounds and virtual reality gardens within the confines of the Old Grove Park.

Through a thousand words, I explored the clash of ideals, the struggle between progress and preservation. The ancient trees became silent witnesses to heated debates at town hall meetings, where environmentalists and tech enthusiasts engaged in a battle of words. The juxtaposition of the towering skyscrapers against the gnarled branches of the park's oldest tree mirrored the tension in Neon City's collective conscience.

""What is the meaning of life?"" The question echoed in my mind, a relentless epanalepsis that demanded exploration. As I embarked on this freewriting journey, the repetition of the existential inquiry became the rhythm of my introspection.

For a thousand words, I delved into the varied perspectives of individuals wrestling with the ultimate question. From philosophers contemplating the intricacies of existence to everyday people seeking purpose in mundane routines, the epanalepsis served as a constant reminder of the universal quest for meaning.

The narrative weaved through different characters and their unique experiences, creating a tapestry of reflections that echoed the complexities of human existence. The repetitive structure became a literary heartbeat, pulsating with the shared yearning for understanding amid the chaotic symphony of life.

**Response to Prompt 27: Symbolism**

In the quaint town of Willowbrook, the arrival of a single dove carried profound significance. Its graceful descent into the town square was a symbol, an omen that whispered of impending change. As a budding novelist with a penchant for symbolism, I couldn't resist exploring the layers of meaning embedded in this seemingly mundane event.

For a thousand words, I dissected the impact of the dove on the lives of Willowbrook's residents. The mayor saw it as a sign of prosperity, the local florist interpreted it as a call for unity, and the elderly storyteller regarded it as a harbinger of forgotten tales. The dove's symbolism rippled through the town, influencing decisions and shaping destinies.

As the story unfolded, I traced the journey of the dove's symbolism, following its subtle influence on characters and events. The once quaint town underwent a transformative metamorphosis, and the symbolism of the dove became a thread that wove through the narrative, connecting disparate lives in unexpected ways.

**Response to Prompt 33: Catachresis**

In the dimly lit alleyways of Serpent's Hollow, darkness wrapped its cold arms around me‚Äîan eerie catachresis that mirrored the ominous atmosphere. The assignment was to explore the underbelly of the city, and as a novice reporter, I found myself navigating the labyrinth of deceit and shadows.

For a thousand words, I delved into the catachresis-infused descriptions of the characters populating Serpent's Hollow. The crime lord, known as the Velvet Serpent, ruled the district with a velvet-gloved fist. His lair, a dilapidated mansion, exuded an air of faded grandeur that served as a catachresis for the empire he once commanded.

As I chronicled the criminal underworld, the catachresis became a literary tool to convey the complexity and decay inherent in Serpent's Hollow. The labyrinthine plots, the twisted allegiances, and the morally ambiguous characters all found expression through catachresis, painting a vivid picture of a city where metaphor and reality intertwined.

**Response to Prompt 43: Epizeuxis**

""Never, never, never give up."" The words echoed in my mind, a relentless epizeuxis that fueled the protagonist's journey against insurmountable odds. In the dystopian world I crafted, where hope was a rare commodity, the power of repetition became a beacon of resilience.

For a thousand words, I immersed myself in the protagonist's struggle, exploring the emotional depth of the epizeuxis as a mantra against despair. Each iteration of the phrase became a battle cry, a whispered promise that carried the weight of a shattered world on its shoulders.

As the narrative unfolded, the epizeuxis became a driving force, propelling the protagonist through a landscape of desolation and uncertainty. The repetition served as a reminder that, in the face of adversity, the strength to persist often lies in the relentless echo of one's own determination.

**Response to Prompt 50: Acrostic**

As the final rays of the setting sun painted the sky in hues of orange and pink, I found myself at the edge of the cliff overlooking the vast expanse of the ocean.

**Response to Prompt 3: Hyperbole**

In the quaint village of Mistwood, where routines unfolded with the predictability of the sunrise, the arrival of a peculiar fortune teller sparked exaggerated whispers. ""This is it, the end of our mundane lives!"" proclaimed Mrs. Thompson, the town's eternal pessimist, as she clutched her cat, Captain Whiskers, with an air of impending catastrophe.

The hyperbole hung in the air, a thick fog of anticipation enveloping the village. As I delved into the story, the hyperbolic reactions of Mistwood's residents heightened the absurdity of the situation. What began as a mere visit from a mystical figure transformed into a fantastical escapade, with the fortune teller's prophecies shaping the destiny of the villagers in ludicrous ways.

Through the hyperbolic lens, I explored the comedic consequences of taking ordinary events to extraordinary extremes. The once mundane village square became a stage for outlandish dramas, with exaggerated gasps and dramatic swoons punctuating every revelation. In this hyperbolic haven, Mistwood's residents discovered the joy in embracing the absurdity of life.

Through the lens of assonance, I delved into the subtle interplay of sounds that defined the atmosphere of Harmony Valley. The lyrical quality of the narrative mirrored the town's collective journey, where the resonance of shared moments and emotions harmonized with the traveler's enigmatic presence.

**Response to Prompt 7: Onomatopoeia**

In the bustling city of Metropolis, where the rhythm of urban life played out in a cacophony of sounds, a peculiar street performer emerged. Armed with an array of unconventional instruments, he orchestrated a symphony of onomatopoeic brilliance that echoed through the crowded streets.

The narrative unfolded with the vibrant expressions of onomatopoeia, capturing the essence of the city's sonic landscape. The performer's drumming evoked the rhythmic tap-tap of raindrops, while his wind instruments mimicked the whoosh of passing cars. The city, typically drowned in noise, became a canvas for this auditory artist.

As I delved into the story, the onomatopoeic symphony became a language of its own. The characters communicated through the vibrant echoes of everyday sounds, fostering a unique connection between the performer and the people of Metropolis.

**Response to Prompt 12: Juxtaposition**

In the technologically advanced city of Silicon Haven, where sleek skyscrapers touched the sky and holographic billboards painted the air with luminescent advertisements, a hidden oasis existed‚Äîa pocket of nature known as the Zen Garden. The juxtaposition of these contrasting elements created a visual paradox that fascinated both residents and visitors alike.

As the narrative unfolded, the stark contrast between the city's cutting-edge architecture and the serene beauty of the Zen Garden became a metaphor for the characters' internal conflicts. The bustling metropolis symbolized progress and innovation, while the tranquil garden embodied the need for balance and introspection.

Through the lens of juxtaposition, I explored the dichotomy within the characters as they navigated the relentless pace of Silicon Haven. The Zen Garden became a refuge, a place where the cacophony of technology met the soothing whispers of nature. The juxtaposition served as a visual metaphor for the characters' quest to find equilibrium in a world defined by extremes.

**Response to Prompt 22: Metonymy**

In the political arena of Capital City, where decisions echoed through the corridors of power, a single phrase dominated conversations‚Äîthe ""Iron Throne Statement."" This metonymic expression encapsulated not just a policy decision but the entire narrative of political maneuvering that unfolded within the city's hallowed halls.

The story unfolded with the metonymy acting as a symbolic gateway into the complexities of governance. The Iron Throne Statement, while seemingly straightforward, carried the weight of a thousand debates, negotiations, and betrayals. Its impact rippled through the lives of citizens, shaping their destinies in ways they could scarcely fathom.

Through the lens of metonymy, I delved into the layers of meaning hidden within this political shorthand. The characters grappled not only with the literal implications of the Iron Throne Statement but also with the overarching themes of power, ambition, and the sacrifices demanded by political gamesmanship.

Little did they know that this understatement concealed the unraveling of a cosmic anomaly.

The narrative unfolded with the charm of understatement, as the townsfolk continued their routines, blissfully unaware of the cosmic storm brewing beneath the surface. The serene descriptions of everyday life served as a stark contrast to the impending upheaval that threatened to reshape the very fabric of Serenity Springs.

Through the lens of understatement, I explored the characters' nonchalant reactions to the unfolding events. The once quiet river became a conduit for interdimensional travel, and the night sky, adorned with stars, transformed into a celestial canvas of possibilities. The charm of Serenity Springs became a poignant backdrop to the understated drama that unfolded, emphasizing the profound impact hidden within the simplicity of daily life.

In the dystopian city of Emberfall, where the remnants of a fallen civilization lay entwined with the shadows of despair, a lone figure emerged‚Äîa rebel determined to dismantle the oppressive regime. The narrative unfolded with the rapid pace of asyndeton, omitting conjunctions to mirror the urgency of the protagonist's quest.

Through a cascade of words, the asyndeton propelled the reader through the city's decaying alleyways and towering citadels, each sentence building upon the last. The disjointed rhythm captured the relentless momentum of the rebel's journey, emphasizing the magnitude of the challenges faced in their struggle for freedom.

As the narrative unfurled, the absence of conjunctions served as a narrative device, intensifying the sense of urgency and desperation that permeated Emberfall. The rebel's asyndetic odyssey unfolded against a backdrop of shattered hopes and whispered rebellions, culminating in a crescendo of defiance against the oppressive regime.

For a multitude of words, the relentless repetition of ""never"" served as a lifeline, propelling the protagonist through the harshest of environments. Each iteration of the phrase became a battle cry against the oppressive silence of Endless Sands, a declaration that reverberated across the vast expanse.

Through the lens of epizeuxis, I delved into the depths of the character's determination.

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live?

Dad was just absent or locked up. 


I've been spending more time with her running errands and despite getting over how her voice triggers me/ wakes up something in my heart that makes me want to go away - I had a nice today. 


And somehow her voice was not annoying today. I took her out to eat and drove her around. It's crazy how much she's changed. She'll never ever apologize or even admit she abused me. She'll DENY IT. She's still never wrong/ taking blame  about anything but we've learned to deal with that. If I were to cry in front of her she'd be confused and not know what that's about. 


She's a product of her upbringing and I have to approach her a certain way(still being myself). She shows she cares about me by cleaning my house and car(I don't ask). If I drive her out she asks me if I want a coffee. It's small things but it means a lot to me. 


Despite her former explosiveness, she's never had us go hungry, we've always had a home with light and running water all by herself because my father was an absent drunk. She'd work hard to get us whatever we wanted! To the point people at school thought we were rich.(we weren't)


This is a woman who would call me fat everyday and when I started becoming thin THIN shed beg me to eat(I wouldn't break my diet lol)





All this has made me jaded to stuff that would make anyone else cry, has made me resilient & has given me bipolar type 2 disorder and fibromyalgia(bc of the beatings)I'm on meds, and will be on them for life.

The morning breakfast was another letdown. The servers seemed quite inexperienced and didn‚Äôt know the menu well. I ordered coffee and was served it without a cup‚Äîjust a bit of a bizarre oversight that set the tone for the rest of the meal.

1fvu4tl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fvu4tl,Japan trip #3/7 Haruka Murooka Tokyo,"Haruka Murooka is a new dessert dining spot in Tokyo. When I first heard about a female led dessert dining place that I could book as a solo diner I was very excited. 

I have a sweet tooth and ive always wanted to try dessert dining but most places dont accept solo diners so I booked the restaurant with tablecheck as soon as possible. 
The restaurant is located in Tokyo near the national museum and has a very feminine look with light pinkish interior and youre greeted by one of the sous chefs when you come in. 

Sadly Haruka doesnt speak any english even though she understands it. Shell give long explanations to her japanese clients and just google translates the name of the dish and possible instructions to eat it for me. While I love talking to a chef and learning more about the food and i spiration behind their dishes I dont deduct any points for this. I cant expect her to speak english while im dining in Japan.

But then the food starts...
Let me start off by congratulating all the food producers that she uses. Theyre the star of the show. You can taste the quality of the ingredients she uses and this is the main thing that separates Haruka Murooka from other dessert shops ive been to in Japan. The quality of the fruit is just that step or two higher than an average dessert shop.

But the dishes.. well here are my notes:

-Green mandarin, glass too small, last bit was unpleasant

- Milk, salt and olive oil: Moliere dessert 2.0, better milk and olive oil but no pepper which left me wanting more

-Cardamon pear, apple and yoghurt: nice

-Pumpkin soup and Foccacia filled with rice, walnuts and aged ham: best so far, lovely pumpkin and great walnuts

-Chocolate water: why the jelly + the Coffee granita was too crystallized. Just a bad texture experience, wasted potential

-Lemon balm tea: okay

- Grape parfait: sweetness on sweetness, too much. Also a pain to eat with the massive meringue in the middle of a tall unstable glass.

- Fig tiramisu with cold brew: Why extra coffee if theres already coffee on the bottom, why waste the figs on this. Sad.

- Churros: nice

-Darjeeling vanilla tea: meh
-Mont blanc with chestnut and cinnamon and grape sando: okay

Overall the experience felt a bit like a film shot by a great cameraman with top of the line equipment without actors or a director. The dishes were lacking in creativity and many were just not that well thought through. The total composition of the meal wasnt there and the drink pairing was just boring and honestly kindof bad. You saw she had the right techniques and presentation but the composition of the dishes and the whole meal was seriously lacking.

On top of that there were many small things that were frustrating like glasses that are hard to drink from like the one for the coffee, last tea and the soda, the big meringue in the parfait that was impossible to get through with a tiny tall glass and a small spoon and by the time the small dishes were served she already had the card machine on her table in front of her and I had to pay before I finished my tea or small bites.

Overall id give it a 4/10. If the ingredients wouldnt have been that good itd have been a 2.

It saddens me to say this but dont go. A normal dessert shop will leave you more satisfied than this restaurant.

I contacted the company and they were so so so awful and intimidating, they also let me know that my car was unlocked then hung up on me. They closed at 4 today and let me know there was an after hours charge if I wanted to pick it up over the weekend this is totally understandable however he wouldn‚Äôt reply to any of my messages until after 4pm. I really really want to lock my car as all my of uni tech is in there (I absolutely know this should have been locked in the first place) but he is refusing to give the address. I can‚Äôt afford the weekend fee as I‚Äôm a full time uni student and I‚Äôm not joking when I say I have 3.40 to my name right now. I‚Äôm so lost with what to do and would really really really appreciate any advice anyone has. Thank you for taking the time to read this ‚ô•Ô∏è",0,1728029566.0,AusLegal,12,0.45,False
