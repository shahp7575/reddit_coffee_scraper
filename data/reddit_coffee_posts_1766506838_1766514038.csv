1pu0tpd,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1pu0tpd/my_girlfriends_family_isnt_human/,My Girlfriend's Family Isn't Human.,"James first noticed her on a Wednesday afternoon, when the light through the high windows of the café was slanted and golden, dust motes drifting in the beams like tiny dancers. He’d arrived early that day, hoping to claim the small corner table by the window for his music theory workbook and a large black coffee. The café was a comfortable jumble of mismatched chairs and tables, a gentle hum of conversation punctuated by the hiss of the espresso machine. As he stood in line, waiting for his drink, he saw her at the counter. 

Dark hair fell in loose waves just past her shoulders, catching the light in chestnut highlights. A pencil was tucked behind one ear, and she wore a moss-green trench coat that seemed improbably elegant for this corner of town—a coat that looked as if it were designed by a meticulous tailor, every seam purposeful, every fold intentional. He wondered what business someone so sharply dressed had in a bohemian coffee shop where most patrons wore paint-splattered jeans and flannel shirts.

She turned, perhaps in response to the barista’s question, and their eyes met. Her smile was crisp and immediate, as though she’d been ready to greet him all along. It was the sort of smile that could have been rehearsed—perfectly timed, flawlessly executed—but it also carried a soft warmth at the edges, like the flicker of a candle in a draft. He caught himself staring and looked away, heart suddenly pounding, but not before he noted the slow, deliberate way she stirred her latte, as if she were counting the rotations of the spoon, the way each swirl added a fraction of sweetness to the bitter coffee.

Carrying his own drink back to the table, he set his heavy textbook down and tried to open it to the study on Schenkerian analysis. The densely packed notation and commentary felt hostile, the tiny symbols arranged in a code that he struggled to decipher. Across the room, out of the corners of his eyes, he could still see her. She’d chosen a small round table by the pastry display, stood there for a moment, one foot slightly in front of the other, favoring her right leg as if it bore a secret weight. She peered at the croissants and danishes with an appraising gaze, but didn’t purchase anything—just sipped her coffee, black, no sugar, eyes moving over the glass case with a quiet intensity.

Once seated, she placed her phone, wallet, and green notebook on the tabletop, aligning them in a perfect row, as though about to perform delicate surgery. She opened the notebook and began to write, flipping pages with swift precision, a motion so brisk it reminded him of a librarian shelving books by the minute. He tried to concentrate on his personal studies, scanning over phrases like “tonal prolongation” and “voice-leading reductions,” but her presence at the far end of the café short-circuited his focus. The scratch of her pencil on paper, the almost inaudible rhythm of her writing, was more mesmerizing than any melody he’d ever studied.

When he came back on Thursday, at precisely the same time, he told himself she wouldn’t notice him. He parked at the same table, opened the same chapter, and settled into the same spiral of frustration and caffeine. But his resolve crumbled in moments when his eyes drifted across the room. She was there again, same trench coat, same posture, same methodical preparation of her workspace. He counted the number of pages she turned: fourteen. 

He noted the tilt of her head as she worked: six degrees off vertical. 

He observed the way she took a sip of coffee when she reached the conclusion of a page, pausing for perhaps three seconds before returning to her notes. He felt almost absurd, as though he were stalking her through algorithms and measurements.

On Friday he almost didn’t come. He told himself it was ridiculous to study at the same café every day, that the routine was too predictable, that she might feel spied upon. But by noon he found himself pushing open the door, inhaling the familiar scent of roasted beans, and making a beeline for his table. As he settled in, his hands trembled just slightly as he opened his book, and for a moment he considered closing it and simply leaving. But then he noticed her beyond the counter, the slight crease in her brow as she jotted notes at top speed, and he was anchored.

It was the third afternoon in a week that he’d seen her there when she rose from her chair and began walking toward him. His heart seized in his chest because he was certain she had not, until that moment, deigned to look at him directly. She carried her latte in one hand, her notebook in the other, her composure immaculate. She paused at his table without hesitation, as if she belonged there, as if she’d been plotting this encounter since Monday. Her eyes flicked to the empty chair across from him and then to his face, wholly unblinking.

“Mind if I sit?” she asked, gesturing at the chair. Her voice was calm, unhurried, but there was a sparkle of amusement in her tone, as if she already knew the answer.

He glanced down at his unremarkable shirt, the slight coffee ring he’d just uncovered on the tabletop, the stubby pencil in his backpack, and felt a rush of self-consciousness. 

“Go ahead,” he said, his voice softer than he intended.

She slid into the chair and set her notebooks in place once more. Up close, her eyes were the exact shade of her coat—deep moss-green flecked with warm brown. Her beauty was striking in a classical way: a Roman nose, high cheekbones that cast delicate shadows, lips that seemed sculpted to rest in a thoughtful line when she wasn’t smiling. Yet there was a restless energy about her, a barely contained fervor that made her seem less like a film star from the silent era and more like someone on the brink of revelation.

“I’m Mary,” she said, extending a hand across the table. Her nails were short, practical, but her fingers were long and tapered, surprisingly elegant.

He stood and shook her hand, caught off guard by its firm grip. “James,” he replied. “Nice to meet you.”

She held his hand for a moment longer than necessary, then released it and placed her notebook between them. She leaned forward, elbows lightly resting on the edge of the table. “I’ve seen you here a few times.”

He tried to appear nonchalant, but he could feel his face warming. “Yeah, I come here to study on my own time.” He tucked a stray lock of hair behind his ear. “But honestly, I don’t remember seeing you before.”

Her smile widened, a quick curve of her lips that suggested she found his discomfort amusing. “I would have remembered you,” she said simply. Then she flipped open her notebook and began to read, eyes scanning the page.

Embarrassment washed over him, and he tried to look back at his book, but the text was now a blur. The scratch of her pencil as she annotated her page was oddly hypnotic. She paused occasionally to chew the end of her eraser, her brow furrowing in concentration. At last, she snapped the notebook shut and looked up with an intensity that startled him.

“Do you always read music theory in public?” she asked.

James blinked. “How did you—?”

She tapped the spine of his open textbook, which he’d subconsciously tried to hide with his hand. “You were air-conducting measures eight through twelve,” she said, “and humming very softly under your breath.”

He laughed, a short, startled sound. “I didn’t even realize.”

She leaned back, crossing one leg over the other gracefully. 

“It’s endearing,” she said. Her tone was gentle, teasing, and he felt a rush of relief and pleasure. “Makes you look absorbed.”

He rubbed the back of his neck. “Sorry. I guess I got carried away.”

“That’s fine,” she said. “Tell me something about yourself, James.”

He hesitated, surprised by the directness of her question. “Like… what?”

Her head tilted to one side, as if appraising him from every possible angle. “Anything. Where are you from? Why music theory? What’s your least favorite chord progression?”

He snorted, running a hand through his hair. “Least favorite chord progression? That’s a new one. Let’s see… I’d say a plagal cadence in the middle of a sonata. It feels like a stuck elevator. I just study music for myself, during free time. It’s relaxing. It’s not that serious.”

She laughed, smooth and clear. “A stuck elevator,” she repeated, jotting down the phrase in her notebook. She paused, looking up at him, her eyes alight. “Tell me more.”

So he did. He told her about growing up in a small Midwestern town where the only music beyond church choir was the radio. He spoke of his first encounter with Bach in the public library’s dusty record section. He described his fascination with patterns in sound, harmonic overtones, and the secret logic of tonal relationships. As he talked, she sketched little diagrams in the margin of her notebook—arrows, circles, a tiny cartoon face each time he made a joke. He found himself talking faster, exhaling tension he hadn’t known he carried. When he finally paused, breathless, Mary looked at him as though she were tasting his words, weighing them.

“That’s fascinating,” she said. “You should be teaching this.”

He waved a hand. “I’m not that good.”

“Humility,” she nodded approvingly, then tapped her pencil twice against the tabletop. “But what about your actual background? Family? Siblings?”

He cleared his throat. “I’m an only child,” he said. “Parents still live back home. I haven’t been to see them in a while.”

“Why’s that?” She sounded genuinely curious.

“Busy,” he shrugged, though it felt inadequate. “I just finished school, work… I guess I’m avoiding the road trip.”

She wrote down ‘Aversion to road trips’ in her notebook and looked at him with a smile. “I see.”

They talked for another half hour—about favorite composers, worst practice sessions, the kind of music that makes your teeth ache when it’s too loud. When his phone buzzed with a reminder for his part-time job shift, he realized they’d been talking for nearly an hour. She glanced at her watch and closed her notebook with a decisive snap.

“Well,” she said, standing, “I’ll see you around.”

He managed a nod, too dazzled to find his voice. She gathered her things and walked away, leaving him with his open textbook, which suddenly looked like a door to a world he no longer found intimidating.

The next day, he arrived at the café well before noon, desperate to reserve the table where they’d spoken. He saw her already there, her thermos of homemade chai steaming beside her notebook. She looked up, caught his eye, and held out a small cup toward him. “Chai?” she asked.

He blinked. “You made this?”

“Early morning project,” she said with a smile, as though making chai were as routine as tying her shoes. “Thought you might like a change from coffee.”

He accepted the cup, inhaling the spicy aroma of cardamom and cinnamon. “I do,” he said, sipping carefully. “It’s perfect.”

She watched him for a moment, then turned back to her notebook. He settled into his chair, opened his book, and was halfway through a Roman numeral analysis when she leaned over and whispered, “Try this instead.” 

She tapped his page where he’d misidentified a dominant preparation. She didn’t scold; she simply guided his pencil to the correct spot, drawing a small star above the chord. Her fingertips brushed his hand in the process, and heat bloomed on his skin.

They met in the same way the next day, and the next. Each time, she asked questions—sometimes about music, sometimes about his life outside the café—and transcribed his answers. He began to look forward to her arrival more than the music theory itself. She had an uncanny sense of his schedule—knowing exactly when he needed a sugar boost or a distraction. She’d produce a flaky almond croissant or a dark chocolate square right at the moment he was about to sigh in defeat over his homework.

Yet for all her attentiveness, she herself remained a mystery. When James tried to learn more about her, she skated around details. She said she was from the East Coast but never specified a state. She mentioned “project work” that involved travel and deadlines, but never elaborated. Occasionally, she’d talk about her young son, but only in fleeting references—a photograph she slipped from her wallet, a half-smile when she mentioned his laughter. She described him as though he were both her greatest joy and an enigma, and James found himself aching to know more but hesitant to push.

For weeks, James’s dreams clattered with imagery: Mary walking through endless corridors, Mary peeling off a mask only to reveal another, Mary singing songs in languages he didn’t know. He woke to the memory of her hands on his skin, her voice in his ear, and always that sense of standing on a threshold. He wanted to know her, and sometimes he convinced himself that he already did. But the current of uncertainty, the suspicion of an inner sanctum untouched by his presence, never fully faded.

Then, on a breezy Thursday evening, Mary rang his phone. He’d just settled onto the threadbare couch in his tiny living room, the light of a single lamp casting long shadows against the peeling wallpaper. When he answered, her voice came softly, almost abruptly: 

“I’d like you to meet my family.” 

It landed in his ear as though it were a casual remark—no buildup, no preamble, no sense of occasion. Just those seven words, matter-of-fact and unadorned. He paused, thumb hovering over the end-call button. 

“Meet your family?” he repeated, voice level but surprised. “Is there… some special reason?” 

She laughed quietly, a sound that carried a trace of warmth. 

“Not at all,” she said. “My son’s home from school early, and I think—well, I think you’d get along. He’s really open-minded.” Then, almost as an afterthought: “You can meet my uncle and grandfather, too. They’re a little… eccentric, but you’ll see they’re harmless.”

He felt the weight of the invitation settle over him. He and Mary had been seeing each other for several weeks: dinners at hole-in-the-wall diners, long walks in the park where she’d talk about her childhood in veiled terms, coffee dates that slipped into twilight. But a family meeting felt like a milestone he hadn’t anticipated. Still, he agreed—you don’t refuse an invitation like that—and he heard her relief in the soft exhale on the other end. 

They set the time: 6:30 p.m. Friday.

—

When Friday evening rolled around, he dressed carefully—dark slacks, a button-down shirt, shoes polished just enough to shine under the overhead light. He checked his reflection in the hallway mirror, fidgeted with his collar, then waited by the door. At exactly 6:15, Mary pulled up in her hatchback, the engine humming quietly. She wore a navy windbreaker and her hair was pulled back in a loose bun. She popped the door open with a wide grin. “Hop in,” she said. He slid into the passenger seat. 

The interior was immaculate, as if she’d wiped every surface with disinfectant moments before: the dashboard gleamed, the upholstery looked untouched, and not a single fingerprint marred the center console. She buckled her seat belt and offered him one. 

“Buckle up,” she teased. “It’s only a short drive.”

As Mary steered the car through the city streets, he watched her profile in the side window: the curve of her nose, the way her brow furrowed slightly when she focused on the road, the subtle glow of the streetlights reflecting in her eyes. She talked about her son discreetly, always referring to him as “the kid.” She described him in broad strokes: curious about history, loves building model airplanes, can’t get enough of jazz records. 

James noticed that she kept changing the things he was into and specific details about him.

She never used his name. He tried to press her, but she said she’d tell him at dinner. Then she dropped another fragment of her past: her mother had died when she was young, and afterward her uncle and grandfather stepped in. 

“They raised me,” she said, voice a shade colder. “In their own way.”

He listened, leaning back in his seat, eyes flicking to the passing storefronts. He realized she spoke of that time almost clinically—no emotions attached, just facts arranged like set pieces. As she piloted them out of the downtown grid and onto quieter suburban avenues, the streetlights thinned and the air took on a scent of freshly mown lawns and distant barbecue smoke.

They came to rest in front of a squat, single-story house at the far edge of a cul-de-sac. The neighborhood was still: no voices, no cars, only the faint chirp of crickets. The front lawn had been mowed in impossibly straight lines, each stripe alternating between emerald and lime, as though the grass itself participated in some secret code. A single porch light flickered, casting an amber glow across the painted wooden steps. Mary parked, turned off the ignition, and sat for a moment. She reached over and gave his hand a quick squeeze—hard enough to be felt, brief enough to be cryptic. He swallowed, climbed out, and followed her up the porch steps.

Inside, the first thing that struck him was the sound: deep, rolling laughter, punctuated by occasional whoops, echoing from somewhere down a long hallway. The walls seemed to shimmer with it, as though the house itself were alive. The second thing was the décor. From floor to ceiling, the narrow foyer was plastered with collages of magazine clippings—faces from decades of television and pop culture. There was Lucille Ball doing her trademark double take; there was Rowan and Martin’s gang of Laugh-In comic rebels; there were the beaming visages of late-night hosts, frozen in mid-grin behind mustaches and suspenders. The effect was dizzying: a hall of mirrors, minus the glass.

He stepped gingerly over a patterned runner rug and into the living room, which looked more like a museum exhibit than a home. Shelves groaned under the weight of VHS tapes, their spines bearing titles that ranged from Mary Tyler Moore to The Cosby Show. In one corner, a stack of old TV Guide issues was meticulously arranged by year, as if someone expected a time traveler to drop by and ask for the premiere date of I Dream of Jeannie. A knitted afghan with Technicolor stripes was draped over a well-worn sofa, the bright yarns still vivid against the muted upholstery. The room smelled faintly of popcorn and dust—and something else: nostalgia, for times you’d never lived through.

In the far corner, under a small tube-style television perched on a rickety stand, sat a man hunched in an armchair. He wore a faded denim jacket, suspenders that had frayed edges, and a battered felt hat that looked like it had seen twenty summers. On the screen, The Beverly Hillbillies played in all its canned-laughter glory, and the old man laughed along in perfect sync—deep laughter that shook his shoulders each time the prerecorded guffaws played. 

He slapped his knee and barked, 

“By golly, that’s a good one!” so loud it nearly drowned out the track.

Mary cleared her throat. The old man waved a hand at them without turning his head. His voice rang out in a drawl that could have been lifted straight from the Ozarks: 

“Don’t mind me, folks! Just watchin’ my stories.”

James took a careful step forward, offering his hand. The old man finally swivelled his head—silver hair shining under the lamp—and fixed him with a bright, curious stare. 

“Name’s Joe,” the old man announced, standing up so quickly that the chair groaned in protest. “You hungry, son?” 

He pointed toward an open doorway that led to a kitchen where the smell of roasting meat drifted out.

James gave Mary a quizzical look. Mary managed a small smile. 

“That,” she said softly, “is my grandfather.”

He tried to keep his tone light as he replied, 

“It’s very nice to meet you, name’s James.” 

But the old man didn’t drop the character. He tipped his hat and winked. 

“Pleased to meet you, too,” he said. Then he lowered his voice conspiratorially: “Have you ever tried cornbread with honey butter? I reckon I can fix you up right.”

As Mary guided James deeper into the living room—past a glass display case full of battered black-and-white photographs of unrecognizable actors—he realized something curious: Joe’s eyes, though twinkling and jovial, were sharp. They were eyes accustomed to reading people, measuring them, placing them on some private scale. James wondered briefly whether Joe was playing a part or simply refused to break character. Was it dementia? A lifelong performance? Or a conscious choice to live permanently in the world of his favorite shows?

Then, Mary steered him toward the dining room. There, a middle-aged man in a wide-lapelled suit sat at the table with his hands tented under his chin. He had perfectly coiffed hair and a smile that radiated yellow charisma. When James entered, the man leaned forward and said, “Top five answers on the board: What brings you here tonight?” 

There was a pause, then uproarious self-laughter.

This, evidently, was the uncle. He introduced himself as “Richard,” and the handshake that followed felt like a game-show challenge. Richard’s every movement, every turn of phrase, seemed lifted from Family Feud reruns. When James hesitated to answer a question, the uncle would pound the table and shout, 

“Survey says—!” as if an invisible crowd were keeping score.

James tried to laugh it off, but as the dinner unfolded he became increasingly aware of the collages on the walls: everywhere, television faces, pasted together in surreal, overlapping mosaics. There were mashups of cartoon characters with news anchors. There were eyes cut from one actor and glued onto the face of another. It was an unnerving, obsessive display. The more James noticed, the more he realized that the entire house was curated to resemble a set—a simulation of family life as broadcast to the world, complete with a sizzle reel of canned laughter and familiar punchlines.

That was the moment when, through a jitter of nerves and cheap wine, James remembered the questions Mary had been peppering him with since their first night together: What was the best sitcom episode of all time? What television moment, if any, had genuinely made him weep? Had he ever, growing up, imagined himself as another person for days at a time—inhabiting not only their voice but their gestures, their appetites, their secret hopes? It had seemed a harmless quirk at first, this “twenty questions” game, but now the memory of it snagged at him like an unfinished thread.

He remembered how, lying together in the sweaty hush after sex, Mary would go suddenly serious. She’d look up at him with those impossible eyes, and ask whether he felt, deep down, that he was always pretending—a man performing the role of himself, never quite able to believe his own lines. 

“Do you ever wish you could just… slip out of character?” she’d said once, tracing lazy circles on his chest. “Like, be someone entirely new for a day?”

Back then he’d laughed, chalking it up to the late hour and the heady aftermath of orgasms. 

Of course I do, he’d said, not really meaning it. 

Doesn’t everyone?

Now, sitting at the dinner table with the two men—game show uncle and sitcom grandfather—James felt as though he were living inside a dream crafted from Mary’s questions and obsessions. Even the food was staged: TV-dinner trays, mashed potatoes piped into perfect swirls, green beans a uniform shade of radioactive emerald. The glasses were filled with grape Kool-Aid, which neither uncle nor grandfather drank. When James tried to take a sip, the uncle leaned forward, winked, and said, 

“Survey says—!” as if any movement required its own laugh track.

He looked at Mary. She was unfazed by the spectacle, cutting her meatloaf into precise cubes and eating each one with the deliberation of an astronaut. Every now and then she would toss James a look of such perfect composure it made him uneasy. It wasn’t just that she was calm in the presence of family weirdness; it was that she seemed to be waiting for something, as though the night were a game designed for his benefit and she was silently willing him to keep playing along.

His mind did what it always did under stress: it cataloged. He began to tally the oddities, assembling them into a taxonomy of the uncanny. The old man’s laughter, which always landed a fraction of a second too late, as if he were listening to a delayed feed. The uncle’s hands, which never trembled or fidgeted, but held every gesture in a freeze-frame of perfect, almost plastic stillness. Even the family photos on the wall were wrong: in every snapshot, the faces smiled too widely, the pupils caught by the camera in a way that made them look painted on.

James tried to tell himself that this was just what happened to families after too much television and too few other interests—a kind of arrested development, harmless enough if you squinted. But then he looked at the place settings: four plates, four sets of utensils. 

He realized, with a start, that he hadn’t seen Mary’s son all night. She’d spoken of him so often that James had expected the kid to be orbiting, a minor planet in the family system, sneaking into the fridge or playing video games in the den. He glanced toward the hallway, where a closed door pulsed with the flicker of television light.

Mary caught his gaze and smiled. 

“He’s just finishing his homework,” she said, as if reading his mind. “He’ll join us soon.”

He nodded, but the words rattled in his head. Homework? On a Friday night, after nine o’clock? And still, the silence behind the door was thick and total—no clack of keyboard, no muttered complaints, not even the telltale hum of animation. He tried to imagine what kind of child Anthony must be, living in the shadow of such extravagant family theater. Was he a fellow mimic, a prodigy of imitation? Or, perversely, a total blank, a kid so unformed that his family’s personalities had simply washed over him, leaving nothing behind?

The question occupied James as the meal progressed. He picked at his food, mostly out of politeness, and filled the gaps in conversation with stories from his own childhood—his mother’s soup recipes, his father’s penchant for crossword puzzles and Jeopardy reruns. The uncle lapped up these anecdotes, responding to every detail with a ready-made game show catchphrase, while the grandfather simply nodded and occasionally barked, 

“By golly, that’s a good one!” 

It began to dawn on James that neither man had once asked him a direct question about himself; it was as if their exchange was governed by a script, one in which the visitor’s purpose was simply to produce more lines for the canned laughter to punctuate.

Eventually, Mary stood up from the table, wiped her mouth on a paper napkin, and said, “I’ll go get Anthony.” 

She left the room with a lightness that seemed almost performative, as if she were stepping out for a commercial break. James listened to her footsteps recede down the hallway, then disappear behind the closed door.

He sat in the sudden quiet, feeling the eyes of both men settle on him. The uncle smiled, his teeth bared in a game show host’s approximation of warmth. 

“So, James,” he said, “what’s your final answer?”

James hesitated, then shrugged. “About what?”

The uncle looked at the grandfather, who cackled and said, “You should always lock in your answer, son. That’s the secret.”

For a moment, James wondered if this was some kind of elaborate hazing ritual—an initiation for boyfriends, a test of how much weirdness one could endure before bolting. He tried to play along, even as his skin prickled with the knowledge that he was being watched, assessed, measured against an invisible yardstick.

Mary returned to the dining room slowly, her left hand curled gently around the slender wrist of a boy who trailed beside her like a ghost in an old photograph.

“This is Anthony,” she announced in a voice bright as a bell, though something about her inflection carried an undertow—half pride, half relief, perhaps. 

James blinked twice, then stared hard at the child. Anthony was dressed in a style so distinctly antiquated it might have belonged in a dusty black-and-white rerun: a crisp white collared shirt neatly buttoned to the throat, short pleated pants that ended just above the knees, knee-high socks folded with mathematical precision, and polished leather shoes that gleamed under the overhead chandelier. His dark hair was slicked back in a rigid wave that betrayed not a single stray strand. It was as though someone had taken a snapshot from the 1950s and slid it into the present moment with impossible clarity.

But it was Anthony’s face that froze James’s gaze. It bore none of the hallmarks James had mentally sketched when Mary first spoke of her son: no soft baby fat around the cheeks, no tentative, gap-toothed smile, none of the tentative shyness or mischievous glimmer in the eyes that mark the presence of a living child. Instead, Anthony’s features were drawn tight, as though the skin had been stretched across a carved wooden mask. His jaw was firm, unmoving. His eyes were unblinking, wide and luminous—as if two polished marbles had somehow been installed in place of irises, each reflecting the chandelier’s glow with disconcerting precision.

He moved with an odd, mechanical rigidity, every motion deliberate, almost rehearsed. When Mary guided him toward a chair at the long, varnished table, Anthony pivoted at the hips and sat down with his back absolutely straight, both feet planted flat on the hardwood floor. His hands folded exactly at the center of his lap, thumbs touching. He did not fidget. He did not glance around the room. He simply stared at James, as though he meant to examine and memorize every one of his features—the curve of his nose, the set of his eyebrows, the slight tremble in his lower lip.

Mary smiled at the boy, then turned back to James.

“This is James,” she said gently. “He’s a guest tonight.”

Anthony offered a slight nod and spoke in a voice that resonated far deeper than James would have expected from someone so slight in stature.

“Nice to meet you, James.” The words emerged with a hollow echo, as though they’d been recorded in an empty chamber and replayed. It sounded practiced, rehearsed in front of a mirror until each syllable had been polished smooth.

James forced himself to respond with a courteous smile. “Nice to meet you too. How was your homework today?”

Anthony paused, blinked twice in the slow, deliberate fashion that now set James’s nerves on edge, and said evenly,

“It was easy. I like numbers.” He added a quick, efficient grin, but it failed to touch his eyes, which remained locked on James’s face in unrelenting scrutiny.

Mary beamed at her son, as though proud of a performance well executed, then shot James a sideways look that seemed to say plainly: See? Nothing strange at all. Don’t worry.

But James’s heart thudded in his chest. Everything about the boy was strange. Anthony’s head seemed slightly oversized for his small body, the pale skin so unnaturally smooth that it looked almost translucent—like unbaked dough stretched thin. He seemed far too rigid, too perfect, too aware. James realized with a queasy pang that he had no real sense of how old Anthony was meant to be. Mary had spoken of him in vague terms—“very bright for his age,” “a bit shy,” “still adjusting”—but none of that matched the silent, intense figure now sitting opposite him, hands folded, eyes fixed.

As the adults around the table began to serve themselves—scooping roast, heaping potatoes, ladling gravy—the boy’s gaze never wavered. He didn’t glance at the roast or at the china plates. He watched James. With relentless precision, he followed every dip of James’s fork toward the plate, every hesitant swallow, until James felt compelled to drop his eyes or risk meeting that unblinking stare.

Mary bent forward, placing a dish of stringy green beans on the table. “Anthony, did you get a chance to finish that library book I asked about?” she prompted, her tone cooing, motherly.

“It’s finished,” he replied without hesitation. “I read every page. The themes were… enlightening.” His voice was even, almost monotonal. He did not offer any further elaboration. He did not squirm in his seat. He did not wipe his mouth or show any hunger for approval. He simply awaited the next cue.

Mary exchanged a quick glance with James, as though reassuring him that everything was under control. “Wonderful,” she said. “And how about recess? Did you play any games with Linh or Mikey today?”

Anthony’s eyes flicked to Mary, then to James, then back to Mary, as though downloading the question before delivering the answer.

“I played tag with Linh,” he said. “I do not mind tag. I do prefer puzzles.” He allowed himself the merest twitch of a grin that curled the corners of his mouth upward—in his mind, perhaps, an adequate approximation of a child’s enthusiasm.

The adults at the other end of the table chattered on—Uncle Richard scoffing at the soggy texture of the roast, Grandfather Joe drifting in and out of awareness, nodding at intervals as though caught between slumber and wakefulness. But all the while, the low hum of an unseen laugh track permeated the room, a relentless undercurrent of canned mirth. 

James’s stomach lurched. He turned his head to the den’s open doorway: there, a flatscreen nestled in the wall played an old sitcom rerun, its laugh track booming through hidden speakers. Private chuckles, canned applause, belly laughs—all timed to perfection, an absurd double soundtrack to the real conversation.

Anthony did not react to the laughter. He didn’t acknowledge it, didn’t flinch. As though oblivious to it, he continued to study James. Every so often, he would lift his eyes from the table and hold James’s gaze in a way that felt unnerving, like a camera lens zooming in too close.

James cleared his throat and tried another subject. “What about television? Ever watch anything you enjoy?”

The boy’s expression flickered—a fraction of a second—then settled.

“I don’t watch television,” he intoned. “It’s not real.” He paused, looked up at Mary, then added,

“Would you say that, Mother?”

Mary’s face remained serene. She offered only the slightest nod, as if granting permission for that answer and accepting it as complete. She did not push him to elaborate or soften his tone.

James swallowed hard, trying to force a forkful of gluey mashed potatoes down his throat. Each bite lodged in his chest like rotting wood. The potatoes were cold and pasty. The gravy was sickly sweet, almost plastic in flavor. The roast was charred at the edges but still raw at its center, bleeding a thin, glistening liquid into the gravy. Even the green beans tasted of nothing but metal.

He glanced around the table. Uncle Richard, laughing along with the sitcom, pounded his fist on the table in perfect sync with the recorded guffaws. Grandfather Joe, blinking slow and heavy as if waking from a dream, would crack a smile—just for the punchline—and then slump forward again, eyes closing. Mary offered polite bites and soft murmurs of encouragement to everyone else. But Anthony never lifted a morsel to his mouth. He sat, his posture ceremonial, his eyes locked on James, as though waiting for something to happen.

Conversation turned to holiday plans—Mary’s plans to take Anthony to the zoo next week, the possibility of a family outing to the mountains. Anthony answered each question with the same clipped cadence, hinting at interest but never showing any real excitement. When Mary asked if he looked forward to seeing the penguins, he simply tilted his head and said, “Penguins are… aquatic birds. I have read about them.” Then he offered a swift nod, and his gaze returned immediately to James.

After what felt like an eternity, James realized his water glass was empty. He reached for it, but it had somehow slipped entirely out of reach. He shifted, saw the glass sitting untouched at his place setting—empty, exactly where it had begun. He hadn’t sipped at it once since the meal began. He realized then that he’d been so absorbed by the boy’s eerie stillness, by the canned laughter echoing off the walls, by the grotesque parody of a family dinner unfolding around him, that he’d almost forgotten to eat or drink. Panic fluttered in his chest.

He looked at Mary, who gave him a gentle, apologetic smile and poured him more water. 

“Here you go,” she said, handing him the glass. But even the water tasted off, as though filtered through some metallic, rusty pipe.

Anthony, sensing perhaps a shift in the room’s energy, blinked twice in his deliberate fashion and spoke without preamble. 

“May I be excused?” His voice was calm, utterly devoid of childish hesitancy.

Mary glanced at the clock on the wall—silent, ticking—then nodded. “Of course. Why don’t you go read in the den for a bit?” she suggested.

The boy rose with the same precision he’d used to sit, pivoting on his heels, then walked toward the den without so much as a backward glance. As he passed James, the faintest scent of something—chalk? Sterile plastic?—wafted from him, a fleeting odor that dissolved in the air almost as soon as it touched James’s nostrils.

James exhaled slowly, as though releasing a held breath he hadn’t been conscious of. Mary returned her attention to him, concerned about softening her smile. 

“Are you alright?” she asked.

He nodded, unable to form words. The silent weight of Anthony’s presence still lingered in the room, a cold, calculated impression. Uncle Richard let out another laugh in perfect time with the television, Grandfather Joe stirred, and Mary resumed her small talk.

But James could think only of that pale-faced boy in a vintage schoolboy uniform, sitting motionless at his mother’s table, watching him with unblinking eyes, as if calculating and cataloging every detail. And James knew, with an unsettling certainty, that he would never unsee the astonishing precision of Anthony’s performance—nor unhear the faint, mechanical echo in his voice.

The conversation, if it could be called that, soon turned. It was as if the entire family had conspired to shift the spotlight onto him, to excavate his past and dissect it for entertainment.

Richard opened with the easy stuff, the ""Tell us about yourself, James!"" line. But it quickly devolved into a barrage of questions so intimate and oddly specific that James found himself stumbling, caught off-guard by how much they already seemed to know.

Best activities you can choose from. Ofcourse I don’t know if you are into nature, history or strictly leisure so I made a thorough list of the most fun activities (ranging from art, history, aquatic activities, hikes, food and even liquor tasting) the island has to offer you can choose from. I hope you enjoy your time. ❤️🇨🇼

• Willemstad was established in 1634 and is a UNESCO World heritage site and has a lot to do/see. You can do a walking tour, e-bike tour or even ride a tuktuk through the city with your guide. I highly recommend a day trip in Willemstad: Make sure you visit Punda (Pietermaai etc.) and Otrabanda downtown as well as the Kura Hulanda village  in our city.

I think the Kura Hulanda museum about the Transatlantic trade are great. Curacao also hast teh oldest synagogue in the western hemisphere, the Mikve Emmanuel synagogue. The Museum is also great. Another honorable mention for Willemstad museums is the Curacao Maritime Museum. The island has about 30 museums so there is something for everyone if you like history. 

\- Visit Hofi Mango which is a Nature Park in Bandabou where you can also do a zipline. Bandabou also has the BEST beaches on the island so I’d go beach hopping afterwards. I would rent a car for a day.

\- Klein Curaçao island day trip is a MUST. Klein Curaçao a private uninhabited island that is STUNNING. You can book a trip with different companies. Keep in mind that you take the boat to Klein at around 7-9 am and typically take the boat to come back at around 5-6 pm. Klein Curaçao is definitely a GEM.

\- You could also go kayaking with mangroves. And chill at Mondi Beach clubs afterwards.

•	⁠St.Christoffelberg hike is super fun (highest mountain on the island, intermediate/slightly difficult hike) 

\- Visit Hofi Mango which is a Nature Park in Bandabou where you can also do a zipline. Bandabou also has the BEST beaches on the island so I’d go beach hopping afterwards. I would rent a car for a day

•	⁠Eric’s ATV dirt Bike or Buggy Curacao ride (you’ll get super dirty but it’s a super fun activity. And people LOVE it) 

•	⁠Hato Caves Curaçao (it’s a soft hiking excursion where you can learn about the indigenous Curaçaoans and even see their tribal storytelling/writings in our caves. Very interesting). 

•	⁠Curacao blue liquor distillery at Landhuis Chobolobo (you can tour the museum, try the national liquor and take their mixing class it is super fun. The home of the Lahara liquor is Curaçao and it is our national drink) 

•	⁠The Curaçao Blue room cave (underwater cave excursion. It is magical) 

•	⁠Noteworthy Museums in Willemstad;  Kura Hulanda about the Transatlantic Trade and Curaçao Mikve Immanuel Museum are great as l Curaçao has the oldest synagogue in the Western hemisphere and they’ve also expanded the museum part of the congregation. well as the Curaçao Maritime Museum. An honorable Willemstad museum mention is the Curaçao Maritime museum. We have over 30 museums all over the island so I hope there is something you like. 

•	⁠Chichi Garden art factory by Serena (learn how to make our national doll sculpture, Miss. Chichi. You paint and customize your own personal sculpture too. Chichi sculptures are all over the island, they have a massive one at Sandals) 

•	⁠Shete Boka National Park

•	⁠Kura Hulanda village for shopping, restaurants, lots of art and beautiful pics. It’s a UNESCO protected village.They also have a market on the first Saturday of every month too). It’s also right next to the Kura Hulanda Museum. 

•	⁠Make your own perfume at one of the Parfum Lab locations on the island (Sambil or in Punda) so you can always remember your trip to Curaçao.

•	⁠Book a tour (Bus tour with IRIE tours) 

•	⁠Take a pottery or candle making class at Na Man Ceramics or at the Creative studio pottery. •	⁠Sunset Sip and Paint in Willemstad. Take a walk and see the Otrabanda/ Punda murals after you are done for some beautiful instagram pics. •	⁠Flamingo Sanctuary Sint.Willibrordus. •	⁠Rancho Alegre Horsebackriding

•	⁠Curacao ostrich far 

•	⁠Superior producer ship wreck diving

•	⁠Cathedral of Thorns (sculptures and art made with thorns) 

•	⁠Aloe Vera farm Curacao (We make soaps, shampoos, creams and so much more here. You can tour the Aloe fields and see the products) •	⁠Netto Bar (oldest bar on the island and super lively at night with music and dancing). 

•	⁠Cloud Nine Spa or The experience Spa if you just want to vibe out. 

•	⁠Get a massage at the beach Renaissance hotel, Mambo or Cabana. 

•	⁠Take a Caribbean Cooking class 

•	⁠Visit the Dolphin Academy Curaçao And swim with dolphins. 

•	⁠Aquafari tours

\- go windsurfing

Food: Try some local/ traditional dishes at Plasa bieu in the city. If you are in Banda Bou try some kuminda krioyo at Komedor krioyo, Landhuis Santa Martha or Jaanchie’s restaurant (super authentic and old school).

Our local street food our trùki pans. They are all over the island at night. I recommend Flako’s it’s my favorite but we have so many. 

•	⁠Other restaurants you should try are: Mosa Caña, Sal the kitchen, Kome (brunch is great and they have delicious bottomless mimosa’s), De Visserij (One of the best seafood restaurants on the island), Villa Vis Jan Thiel (same owner as de Visserij) , LionFish Caribbean (you can try the famous Lionfish), Lamunchi, Kaya 91, Disfruta mas (best arepas and batidos on the island), Arepas House, Popcultr in Marie Pampoen (great smoothies, ice coffee and Jamaican Patties), Gouverneur de Rouville, Taqueria Maya, Bario, Serafina, Boase luxury culinary beach restaurant (Boase Resort won the world’s #1 best hotel in the Caribbean, Bermuda and the Bahama’s 2025 award), Hòfi Mango, Perla Del Mar, Java Cafe, Dal toro, La bohème cafe and restaurant (Great for Lunch/Brunch in Punda), Brisa del Mar, Puruchi (local seafood), Playa Forti, Bistro 91, Fènsi, Soi 95, Maira’s kitchen, scampi’s  Funchi restaurant (local cornbased mash dishes), Serafina, Bocas restaurant, Rozendals original cuisine, Pasawa (Food truck and restaurant hub) and Boca 19, BKLYN, De dames (great for brunch), Salú restaurant and Lamuchi restaurant.

Beach Clubs to try: Mondi Beach Club (the view is incredible and definitely worth a visit), Rilèks beach bar and rooftop, Cascade Curaçao Rooftop bar (It’s not at the beach but a spectacular view of old Punda) Mood beach club, Madero Ocean Club, Lemon Beach Club, Playa Beach Club, Karakter beach club if you are at bandabou, Kontiki beach, Cabana beach club or Mambo beach club.

Best beaches: Grote Knip, Cas Abao (THE TOP-25 BEST CARIBBEAN BEACHES 2025 list) , Lagun, playa jeremi, Kleine knip (THE TOP-25 BEST CARIBBEAN BEACHES 2025 list) Porto Marie, Playa Kalki, Playa Piscado, Playa Santa Cruz, PortoMarie, Jeremi and so many others.

1pu0rrg,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1pu0rrg/a_funny_little_conversation_curiously_confusing/,"a funny little conversation - ""curiously confusing""","I went to one of our cities local coffee shops, \*\*highly rated\*\*.  They sell their own roasted beans too.  But I must say, stopping in today, I left curiously confused.

  
I'm no rookie at pour-overs, but also not going to upseat Hoffman or the Chronicler.  LOL.  
My setup, which I've built over the years is simple, effective, can create some tastey pour-overs:

\- Niche grinder + Hario Switch + Acaia Lunar scale + Oxo gooseneck programmable

  
Here's what happened:  I stopped in, looked over their bagged roasted bean selections for sale and then asked the barista (after spotting 2 V60's behind him):  ""Would it be possible to have a pour over of ""the bagged 463, it sounds great, or is it on brew as an option?""  He said no, because those beans ""won't work in a pourover."" He asked if I'd like to buy the bag instead, I said ""Well sure, but I'd be brewing them with a Hario Switch at home (it's kind of like a clever brewer)"" and he said ""Great, those beans would do great with that set-up.""  He then pivoted and asked if I'd like to ""try their Holiday roast, its what we're pouring right now, it's a light roast which tastes like a dark one""  Hmmm...what's happening here?

Sure, I tried the Holiday roast.  Honestly, not sure what made it Holiday roast, no special tasting notes of, I don't know, cinnamon, fruits, chocolates, or anything basically anything.  It was pretty basic.

  
So all be told, I made a special trip there, and once inside wasn't expecting such a curious conversation with arguably the city's highest rated coffee shop.  It was the sad trombone of coffee adventures.  The Indiana Jones coffee exporer in me was wondering:  Did I stumble into some sort of weirdo coffee world?  Or was I served a big ole pile of wikipedia coffee jargon?

Or maybe.....I need to realize I'm just a coffee dum dum.  LOL",0,1766513303.0,pourover,2,0.4,False

I Have No Legal Rights and Do Not Know My Place,"I am a 38 year old woman, recently divorced. I need advice because I feel stuck and afraid of doing harm by choosing wrong.

During the marriage we agreed on shared custody. In reality the children stay with me most of the time because my ex travels often for work.

We have one child together. He is 11.

When I met my ex, he already had a son as his biological mother chose not to be involved. I met him when he was two and a half, I raised him, he calls me mum. I see him as my child in every way, my love for both children is the same.He is now 16 and turns 17 in a few months. For many years we were a normal family. Same care, same rules, same love.

After the divorce I realized how exposed my role is. I have no legal rights over my older son, his birth certificate lists his father and biological mother, as its normal. School, doctors, hospitals, travel, everything stops at paperwork.

Two nights ago police stopped us coming back from a film night at my sisters house, at 10:30 pm. Simple questions turned serious fast.

Who is he.

Where are his parents.

Who am I to him.

Why is he with me.

For a moment I felt accused. My ex had to step in and explain. They understood. Still the feeling stayed with me.

Since then I feel unsafe. Love means nothing without documents.

There is more. He is deep in the teenage phase. For almost two years he stays mostly in his room. He avoids family activities. When I visit relatives with my younger son, he chooses to stay home or making a fuss about going anywhere with us. Conversations stay short. Only basic answers, no sharing, no warmth just the basic ""i don't know, whatever, I don't care"" phrases. 

I looked into adoption before, he is almost 17. He is moody and closed off and when I asked how he feels about adoption, I get shrugs. IDK. Whatever. I do not know if he wants it and I fear pushing him into something he does not care about.

I take him to football twice a week, i can't lie is expensive. His dad said clearly he is not able to pay for it but football matters a lot and I get it, he is actually good. He takes pride in it and so do I, I am proud of him, but sometimes I feel he is fine staying with us mainly because of football.

At the same time he is in a phase where he openly dislikes his younger brother. It hurts. My younger one often says he wants to grow up like ""T"". Hearing this while watching the distance between them breaks my heart.

He has a good relationship with his dad. With him he seems lighter. No rules, video games, talks about girls, late nights. I see a version of him I no longer get, he's relaxed and open when he’s with his dad.

Now I question myself.

Should I step back.

Should I stop being his full time parent.

Should I leave parenting to his father and stay only supportive.

Should I keep our bond as outings like cinema, coffee,  meals, no authority.

I love him deeply. He is my first child in my heart. Still I fear legal trouble for doing what I have done for over a decade, what is something happens to him meanwhile he's in my care? I never looked at this situation this serious before, maybe I am overreacting but I am afraid. 

I do not want to abandon him.

I do not want to overstep.

I do not want to hurt either child.

What should I do.

How do I protect all of us.

Where is the line between care and reality.

I am asking for advice because I do not know how to move forward without losing something important.",3,1766513291.0,stepparents,2,1.0,False

FYI, if i understand correctly, u can only go for FHC as an individual if ur above 21, which is why many jc grads (like me) can only get thru working for companies

info is accurate as of dec 2025

iTea:

* $11.30/h, paid during trial period also
* Message HR on whatsapp
* You will be interviewed by HR via whatsapp video call (in english), very simple, they just ask why itea, how long can u commit etc.
   * They say that they want ppl who can commit more than 3 months 
   * Part time is at least 4 days a week, full day
   * Need stand for long hours but u can try the drinks so u can recommend to customers
* A branch manager will contact u in a few days abt when u can start (most of the branch people are chinese-speaking btw)
* 1st week is trial where they teach u to make drinks, can say u dont want after the 1st week
* Will sponsor u to go for food health cert (FHC) after u commit 70h, but u have to pay $30 urself and go at ur own time

Luckin

* $13/h standard, $14/h on weekends, double pay on PH
* Submit application on fastjobs
* HR will whatsapp u, work out a time to go down for a physical interview 
* Interview at the store only takes 10 min (likely in chinese)
   * First two days is training at HQ to make drinks (around 7h, paid)
   * Must work at least 16h a week in total, each shift must be at least 4h long, u can choose ur own shifts about a week before but its first come first serve between the part timers of that store
   * Need to handle a lot of detergent/sanitiser, so some ppl with sensitive skin on their hands might find it difficult, latex gloves provided
   * Will sponsor FHC if u commit 6 months, if u quit before that u have to pay them back

KOI:

* $11.30/h
* Fill in the recruitment form and they will whatsapp u in a few days
* They will ask u to come down to the nearest outlet of your choice for a 4h trial, paid $20 in cash at the end of it (also chinese-speaking)
* If u don’t have a food health cert, you mainly do cashiering during ur trial which can be very stressful as u r new to the POS system and there are many many complicated orders
* If u pass the trial, they will get back to u

Interview tips:

Most of the time they ask u the same few qns, don’t need to prepare a physical resume but always handy to have it (i translated mine to both eng and chinese). dw i literally have nothing on my resume except school but i thought its weird to show up empty handed

Be mentally prepared that the interviewer can only speak Chinese (like really only chinese) and u have to reply in Chinese

* Why (brand)?
   * Just come up with some ans like u always drink this brand its fine
* So you can commit 6 months and work on weekends/PH?
   * If you’re actually free but just reluctant to work on weekends/PH, still say yes confidently. Then you might be more likely to get the job",2,1766513285.0,SGExams,0,1.0,False

We had been on the rocks for a while, financial mismanagement on her side, me over extending to keep the look up and even some infidelity by her. I was committed to making things work even though I see how I was part of the problem 

Leading up to the separation my mom had passed suddenly and I was experiencing an incredibly toxic workplace. In short I was a mess. 

Christmas used to be my thing from inflatables to massive light shows to parties and huge meals. I loved it. Huge Christmas Eve meals with family and then coffee and gifts with the family on Christmas Day and parties through to NYE. 

The end of 2020 and the separation starting 2021 killed most of the holiday spirit that I had. 

A few years back it came back… I decked the house out with lights and inflatables. I did more that the bare minimum for decorations. I made some amazing meals and started to enjoy my new holiday traditions. Kids are at mom’s for Christmas Eve so my new tradition is some decent bourbon and Christmas Vacation followed by Die Hard. 

My former wife refuses to sign the divorce papers and while frustrating it is less and less of an issue. The kids are with me 85% of the time (mom has alternating weekends) so I focus on their health and growth. 

Here’s where I recognized just how much I’ve healed over the last few years. She has the kids for the 4-5 days leading up to Christmas Day. She’s never been super good at prioritizing the kids over her life - it used to bother me but not anymore. 

She tells me she’s taking them for a Christmas meal at a very chique place in town. As above we’re foodies so the kids wanted to text me and FaceTime over dinner. Looked amazing. 

Then she texts me - “It feels odd being here, without you here. I miss you.” 

I stare at that text but more so with the same look my golden retriever gives me most of the time. Figured she was sentimental so I’d be kind:

“Aw thanks, I’m sure the kids are loving their night of with mom!”

The “texting” bubbles come up 3-4 times before she texts back:

“That wasn’t meant for you.”

Because I love black humour my response was:

“No worries, probably tricky keeping your boyfriends and husband straight. Have a great meal!”

- four years ago that would have killed me
- three years ago I would have been annoyed she wasn’t focusing on the kids 
- two years ago I’d have been annoyed with her for interrupting my evening. 

Last night I just chuckled, counted my blessings and continued to plan what I am going to do with my kids when they get back on the 25th. 

Holidays are stressful but survivable. Choose a path that supports your healing and kids growth. 

Merry Christmas Gentlemen- I’ll be online over the holidays so continue to post and get these thoughts out of your heads. If anyone needs to talk or wants a quiet talk I’m here. ",3,1766513128.0,DivorcedDads,0,1.0,False

1pu0nzy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pu0nzy,Is this a normal feeling?,"I’ve been NC from my parents since January after a falling out over the phone of trying to talk to them about the past but also the disrespect and coldness shown to me (40f) now. I blocked their numbers after my mother would not stop texting me passive aggressive things like a video titled “will I know my family in heaven”.  They can still leave a VM if necessary and can email if they need to. 

I hadn’t heard from them until end of May when my mother was having cataract surgery and my dad was anxiously trying to leave several VM explaining when my mother was having the surgery and if i could come for coffee one evening (delusional, we haven’t spoke since January when he yelled and hung up on me). Other vm was “fine if you don’t want to talk to me, fine”. Haven’t heard from him since. My mother reached out and wrote a note. I ignored it as it doesn’t seem that she has done any self reflection or got help which i asked her to do back in January to potentially repair things. 

Fast forward to December, hadn’t heard from them all year. Last week I get a VM from my mother asking how I’m doing and to call as she would really appreciate it (sounded demanding). Then i get a Christmas card with generic merry christmas. Then i get another note. 

I haven’t responded. Part of me wants to write back to get closure but a big part of me can’t be bothered. I’ve moved on. There was never a relationship as I was physically and emotionally abused growing up. 

Is this normal to feel this way? I just cant bring myself to do it, but clearly she doesn’t get it and probably never will. Is closure something I should consider? 

My parents are very emotionally immature; I suspect both to be narcissistic and possible other things going on but nothing diagnosed as they refuse help and think they are perfect. ",2,1766513051.0,EstrangedAdultKids,1,1.0,False

I’m reaching out because I’m in a season of major transition and, honestly, I’ve never felt more alone in business. I just moved to Portland, Oregon, and after 26 years of owning my own company, I’ve pivoted into the AI consulting world.

Between the move, my health, and the sheer exhaustion of building something new in tech, I feel completely depleted. It is so hard to make genuine friends over 40—especially when you look at other successful women and feel that crushing imposter syndrome. It feels like I’m constantly playing catch-up and falling short.

**I refuse to start 2026 feeling this way.** I want to meet ""my people""—women who understand the intersection of deep business experience and the vulnerability of a new pivot.

**I’m looking to connect with:**

**• Portland-based Founders**: Women who actually want to meet up for coffee or walks in the PDX area.

**• Seasoned Business Owners (40+):** Those who have been in the game for decades but are navigating new frontiers.

**• Tech & AI Space:** Anyone else feeling the isolation of the digital world and seeking ""real life"" connection.

**How do you move past the feeling of being a ""nobody"" when you're starting over?** If you’re in Portland and want to help me build a supportive group for 2026, please comment or DM me.

I wish I had  more time to visit the rest of Austria because Vienna only seems to capture a small glimpse of that country's beauty. It is the coffee capital of Europe for the coffee enthusiasts!

• Vienna is a historical gem, gardens are incredible, and locals are quite nice. It is a pretty expensive city though. 

• The locals are quite busy with work in the day which is quite different than in neighbor countries. 

• Vienna is only really vibrant in the evenings... And I thought that as a tourist, you really have to pay for everything... even entering churches. It is nonetheless a city worth visiting... but it will be costly.

• May/June is an incredible time to visit! The weather was super nice. But the number of tourists was overwhelming.

I recently upgraded my coffee scale from a cheap 8 USD coffee scale I got through Shein, to the Cube 3.0 Pro Max by MHW-3Bomber, mainly for reasons of higher accuracy, as the Shein scale had big issues with that, but seeing the flow rate function made me happy as well to try and experiment results of different flow rates and manage consistency with pours

Anyways, the scale has 3 modes, manual, which showcases time on left, weight on right, and you manually press T to start the timer

Espresso mode, which is not part of this topic so I don't really need to talk about it

And finally, Pour-Over mode, which additionally showcases Ratio, as well as Flow Rate  
Pour-Over mode lets you tare the scale, put your coffee grounds in, then press T to save the weight of the coffee grounds, after which the ratio display will say 1:0.00  
And then when the scale detects water flow, it automatically starts the timer, and constantly shows you the current flow rate of the water being poured  
Another feature/drawback it has is that whenever the weight goes negative / the server is removed from the scale, it automatically stops the process and shows you the time it took, total weight, and the ratio of the brew



My issue is, flow rate feature is only available in Pour-Over mode, if I switch to Espresso or Manual, the flow rate display simply disappears, but I want to have it without switching to Pour-Over mode, since the ""Feature"" of stopping the brew is something I dislike, but I can't  
Alternatively, I want to disable the ""Feature"" of stopping the brew when the scale detects negative weight but I can't find a way

Does anyone know of something I can do? I even decided to check if using the USB-C port of the Scale and connecting it to my PC showcases any sort of internal storage with code written in it to maybe try to edit something there but nope",1,1766512721.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

Ever looked at your bank account and thought, *""If I just had a little more, I could finally…""*—fill in the blank: retire early, travel the world, or stop stressing over bills? Here’s the kicker: **you might already have more than you realize.** The real question is: *Are you putting it to work for you?*

Most of us leave money sitting in savings accounts earning *peanuts* (like, literal pocket change) when it could be growing into something way bigger. Let’s break it down—no finance degree required.

### **Where Your Money’s Probably Hiding (And How to Wake It Up)**
✅ **The ""Just in Case"" Stash** – That emergency fund? Smart. But if it’s just chilling in a basic savings account, inflation’s eating its lunch. *High-yield savings accounts* or short-term bonds can keep it safe *and* growing.

✅ **The Forgotten 401(k)** – If you’ve got an old retirement account from a past job, it’s like leaving a $20 bill in your winter coat pocket—*for years*. Roll it over or consolidate it so it’s actually working for *future you*.

✅ **The ""I’ll Invest Later"" Excuse** – Waiting for the ""perfect time"" to invest? Spoiler: *There isn’t one.* Even small, consistent contributions to index funds or ETFs can turn into serious cash over time. (Compound interest is basically free money—don’t @ me.)

✅ **The Side Hustle That’s Just… Sitting There** – Got a skill, hobby, or even a closet full of stuff you don’t use? Platforms like [Mavely](https://mavely.app.link/e/Jw8ypIghuYb) make it stupid easy to turn idle assets into income. (Yes, that includes your savings—more on that in a sec.)

### **The Mindset Shift That Changes Everything**
Here’s the truth: **Money isn’t just about how much you have—it’s about how hard it works for you.** And no, you don’t need to be a Wall Street guru to make it happen.

- **Automate the boring stuff.** Set up auto-transfers to investments or savings so you don’t even have to think about it.
- **Pay yourself first.** Before bills, before coffee runs—*you* get the first cut. Even $50 a month adds up.
- **Stop guessing, start tracking.** Apps (like the one I mentioned earlier) can show you *exactly* how much your savings could grow—no crystal ball needed.

### **So… What’s Your Next Move?**
Maybe it’s finally rolling over that old 401(k). Maybe it’s moving your savings to a place where it *actually* grows. Or maybe it’s just taking 10 minutes to see how much your money *could* be doing for you.

Ever had that moment where you check your bank account, sigh, and think, *""This is it? This is all I’ve got to show for my hard work?""* Yeah, me too. But here’s the wild part: **You might be richer than you think.**

No, I’m not selling you a get-rich-quick scheme (unless you count compound interest, which, let’s be real, is the closest thing to magic in finance). The truth? Most of us underestimate what we already have—because we’re not looking at it the right way.

### **The Hidden Wealth You’re Ignoring**
1. **Your ""Boring"" Savings Account**
   - That $5K sitting in a savings account earning 0.01% interest? It’s not *just* $5K. It’s a **seed**—one that could grow into something way bigger if you plant it in the right soil (aka investments).
   - *Example:* If you moved that $5K into an index fund averaging 7% returns, in 20 years, it could be **$19,348**—without you lifting a finger.

2. **The ""I’ll Do It Later"" Retirement Fund**
   - That 401(k) you set up and forget about? It’s quietly turning your coffee money into future freedom.
   - *Fun fact:* If you invest $200/month starting at 30, by 65 you could have **$250K+** (assuming 7% returns). Start at 25? Try **$400K**.

3. **The ""It’s Just Stuff"" Assets**
   - That old guitar in your closet? The designer bag you never use? The crypto you bought on a whim? **These aren’t just things—they’re liquid wealth.**
   - Sell what you don’t need, invest the cash, and watch it work for you.

### **The Mindset Shift That Changes Everything**
Most of us think wealth is about **having more**. But real wealth? It’s about **making what you have work harder**.

- **Do this today:** Take 5 minutes to tally up *all* your assets (savings, investments, random valuables). Now ask: *What if I put even 20% of this to work?*
- **Stop this now:** Letting money sit idle. Inflation is eating it alive—**your cash is losing value every day it’s not growing.**

### **Your Money’s Superpower (That You’re Not Using)**
Here’s the kicker: **Time is your secret weapon.** The earlier you start, the less you need to invest to end up with *way* more.

- **Example:** A 25-year-old who invests $100/month until 65 could end up with **$200K+**. A 40-year-old? They’d need to invest **3x as much** to get the same result.

### **So… What’s Your Move?**

But I don't know what pleases me. To do myself up and be embarrassed by compliments, or to go clean and carefree, and slip by without being singled out.

I do prefer not having stuff crumbling onto my skin and caked on my eyelashes, and not being able to rub my eye if I get a mote of grit in one, and it's a bother to have to not eat because I just did my lipstick, and to reapply after eating, and then there's the smudging on the lower lip if you sip coffee, and using a nail over a tissue to try and straighten the line out, and worrying if your blush looks natural, or dollish.

Sometimes it's nice to draw smiles from others who think you look nice but don't overtly say anything, but when they say the ""beautiful"" word, I turn in on myself, I get inwardly critical, I feel a bit resented and a bit phony, and to be honest, a bit resentful myself.

1pu0abr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pu0abr,The Sabrina Carpenter Perfumes: a review,"Hi everyone and Merry Christmas!

So, I had the opportunity of trying these out in store last week and these are just my thoughts on them, coming from someone who wears pink sugar every day and who loves the Red Velvet strain the best:

Original Caramel: so I have mixed feelings about this, because it does feel really Christmassy and nice, the caramel note is really strong and it has like a really heavy taste profile, but the coffee note is so intense that it kind of smells old, if that makes sense? Also it disappeared in 3 minutes. 

Cherry: tbh this is the one I almost bought. The cherry is so sweet, so nice, there is still that caramel milk to it but it doesn’t feel dark or overpowered because there’s fruit instead of coffee for sweet fragrance lovers. The only reason I didn’t take it with me is because I walked around the mall a bit trying to decide whether I should and I kept smelling my wrist and the smell disappeared within like 45 minutes and I kind of like my perfumes to be powerful or to at least have some remnant after they’re gone and, despite having the longest duration, this still didn’t make it for me.

Sweet tooth: ew I found this to be so sharp, so acidic, it smelled like so white floral to me which I really really dislike, I don’t really understand how it is even in the same line as the other ones.

Overall I have to say I was kind of disappointed because I was really expecting to love both caramel and cherry and their longevity was sort of disappointing.",2,1766512187.0,FemFragLab,0,1.0,False

I think my boyfriend sabotaged our birth control and is calling it ""an accident""
I’m 29F, he’s 32M. We’ve been together about 10 months and moved in together pretty fast (I know, I know). He’s always been the “golden retriever boyfriend” type, sweet, helpful, remembers my coffee order, etc. We’ve talked about kids in the abstract and I’ve been really clear: I want them someday, but not soon. I’m in a grad program, my finances are messy, and I’m not mentally in a place to gamble on a pregnancy. He said he understood and even joked that he likes our “quiet life.” We use condoms every time and I’m also on the pill. I keep the pills in my bathroom drawer and I’ve never missed more than a day, but lately I’ve been feeling off and paranoid in a way I can’t explain.

Two weeks ago we had sex and he kept pushing to finish inside. Like not a little, it was weirdly persistent. I said no, he laughed it off and said “come on, you’re on the pill.” I said I’m still not comfortable and that should’ve been the end of it. At one point he literally reached down like he was adjusting the condom, and afterward I noticed the condom felt… wrong. Not sure how to describe it. Later that night I was throwing away the wrapper and I saw a tiny tear near the edge, like it had been nicked. I asked him about it and he did the whole “babe you’re overthinking” thing. Next day I looked at the box we keep in the nightstand and a few condoms were missing, but we hadn’t used that many. I felt insane doing this, but I filled one with water in the sink. It leaked from a pinhole. I tried another one. Same thing. My stomach dropped.

I confronted him, and at first he acted genuinely confused. Then he got quiet and said he “might have” opened a couple earlier because he wanted to “be ready” and maybe he damaged them by accident. I asked why he’d open them ahead of time and he started crying. Like full tears. He said he’s been thinking about having a baby with me and he didn’t know how to bring it up becuase he “didn’t want to scare me.” He said when I talk about moving in a couple years and “starting a real life” it made him think I was basically saying yes. Then he said something that made me feel cold: “I just thought if it happened, you’d see it’s meant to be.” He kept repeating that he loves me and he would “step up” and that I’d be an amazing mom. When I told him this feels like a violation, he got defensive and said I’m accusing him of being a monster, and that it was an accident anyway.

Now I’m sitting here thinking: who the hell am I living with. I dont even know if I’m pregnant yet, I took a test too early and it was negative. I scheduled another test and an appointment for emergency contraception but I’m past the ideal window, so that’s fun. I’m also suddenly remembering little comments he’s made like “you’d look so cute pregnant” and “my mom would lose her mind.” I’m scared to keep having sex with him, obviously, but I’m also scared to tell him I’m leaving because he’s never been angry before and now I’m realizing I don’t actually know him.

Picture this: You’re scrolling through your bank app, staring at your savings balance like it’s a participation trophy. *""Cool, I’ve got $10K… but what does that even *do* for me?""* Meanwhile, your retirement dreams—a beach house, endless avocado toast, or just not panicking over grocery bills—feel like they’re stuck in the ""someday"" folder.

Here’s the kicker: **Your savings might already be way more powerful than you think.** It’s not about having a Scrooge McDuck vault (though, no judgment if you do). It’s about *what that money could become* with the right moves.

### The 3 Money Myths Holding You Back
1. **""I need a million bucks to retire.""**
   - False. The average person thinks they need *way* more than they actually do. A modest nest egg, invested smartly, can grow into a retirement fund that lets you live comfortably. (Spoiler: Compound interest is your BFF.)
   - *Example:* If you stash $500/month starting at 30, you could have **$500K+ by 65**—without winning the lottery.

2. **""My savings are just… sitting there.""**
   - If your money’s in a basic savings account earning 0.01% interest, it’s basically on a permanent coffee break. **Inflation is eating your lunch.**
   - *Fix:* Even low-risk investments (like index funds) can turn idle cash into a money-making machine.

3. **""I’ll figure it out later.""**
   - Later = more stress, fewer options. The sooner you *see* what your savings can do, the sooner you can **stop guessing and start planning.**

### The ""Aha!"" Moment You’re Missing
Most people underestimate their savings because they’re looking at the *number*, not the *potential*. **Your $10K today could be $50K in 20 years—without lifting a finger.** (Okay, maybe a finger to set up an auto-invest plan.)

**You might be richer than you think—find out how much your savings could really fund your retirement.** [Check it out here](https://mavely.app.link/e/Jw8ypIghuYb). *(FYI: That’s an affiliate link—if you click, I might earn a small commission at no cost to you!)*

### The Bottom Line
Your savings aren’t just a number—they’re a **launchpad**. A little strategy (and maybe a nudge from compound interest) can turn ""meh"" into ""hell yes.""

So… what’s *one thing* you could do this week to give your money a raise? 🚀

1pu061g,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1pu061g/need_to_vent_day_2_of_2_weeks_with_mil/,Need to vent - day 2 of 2 weeks with MiL,"I’m about to lose it and it’s been 2 days since my MiL arrived for 2 weeks. This is the longest I’ve ever had to deal with her (typically 6 day spans or less) and I feel like my tolerance is gone on day 2. I was told that it was gonna be two weeks… not asked. So… that’s another post for another group (snapped). 

So, I pick her and my husband, and his teenage son up from the airport at 8 am. He had to fly up to fly back down with her. Why, you May ask? I don’t fucking know because she gets on planes to go other places by herself but for some reason coming to our house requires an escort.  Anywho… I didn’t sleep well and him, his teenage son and his mom all had to get up at 3 am to catch this flight. We’re all tired. The talking starts immediately in the car and does not stop when we get home. Just old people chit chat. She starts in with questions about why we did certain things around the house and I’m trying to not yell “because we did, okay?!?!” Then… she asks my husband for a hoodie. You flew down from New York …. And you want a hoodie? Why tf do you not have one? Her wearing my husbands clothes is something she’s done often … in her own house as well. It’s fucking weird y’all. 

Then she makes herself a cup of tea. We have a whole coffee section set up with 10 mugs hanging and set in the space. She proceeds to go into our cabinet and pull out the one with my husband’s first initial on it. She’s been using it for 2 days. I’m fuming. Again…. That’s fucking weird. (I’m hiding it the next time it gets set in the sink…cuz I am irrationally irritated by this). I’ve cooked three times since she’s been here and every time… she sits at our island and asks why I do things the way I do. “Why is the ketchup in the fridge, I never put mine in the fridge.” “Why do you keep your extra butter in the freezer, I keep mine in my fridge”. “Why are you using that pan? I only use Viking.” “Why do you not buy your sausage in bulk? I do.” You get the point. While I’m cooking for 6 people … she’s saying these things in such a non-snarky way that I can’t tell if she’s being demeaning or she’s just oblivious to how fucking annoying she is. It’s sooo off putting. I had to tell my husband to remove her from the kitchen this morning via hand signals before I lost it. I finish cooking and she’ll grab a plate and start eating while still in the kitchen… continuing to talk and ask unneccesary questions. She’s also a smacker. So… already… immediate increased irritation. But she does this thing where she’ll call someone - another old person - on speaker and talk, ear and smack and do this little “mmm” sound every 3 seconds. We do eat in the living room and had a show on, and she’s doing this in the living room while we are all trying to eat and watch a show. We have a dining room table, a breakfast table and an island in the kitchen that she could go sit at and have her mmm smacking conversations… but no… right where everyone else is … that’s the way to go. 🙄

She won’t touch our dog. I get some folks don’t like dogs, but I’ve seen her touch other dogs. I’ve seen her hold her neighbors dog. She says it’s a texture thing. I think she forgets I’ve seen her touch a dog before. So anytime our adorable dog gets near her she over reacts and says “shoo”. This is my dogs house as much as it’s my childrens or my husbands. The audacity…. 😤

Last night she went out with some family who lives around where we are, she came back with the most infuriating “gift” for me - specifically for me. It was placemats and charger plates for our new dining room table that we invested in. Now I’ve specifically told both my husband and her that I hate clutter. I hate shit being there just to be there. My MiLs house has shit on every ledge, on every crevice and she’s got a full royal place setting on a table that 1 person lives in.  We do not live in a fucking castle or Kris Jenners mansion and have no need for charger plates or placemats (are we toddlers?) when we don’t even use the dining room often. I prefer clean, useful things. I quietly put them on the table as she said “yeah when I got here and saw the table and said ‘it’s too bare’ so we gotta spruce it up”. I’m sure my husband has a hole in his brain from my piercing into his soul. Every time I walk by that fucking table, I want to flip it. They’re ugly, they just clutter the beautiful table I just bought and I get physically upset every time I walk past. This woman has never said a mean word to me… never raised her voice… but I can’t fucking stand her. I don’t know how I’m going to make it through 12 more days of this without getting hammered enough to tolerate it. RIP to my liver. 

If y’all have any suggestions of how to get through this type of shit, please help. Apparently putting Benadryl in her tea is not legal. (I kid, I kid). Or if you have similar experiences…. please drop them to help me feel better. ",17,1766511910.0,JUSTNOMIL,23,0.9,False

I am the top floor neighbor (been here for 14 years), while the unit below me seems to be absolutely cursed. It is a constant revolving door of the worst tenants. Here are a few of my experiences (in order of occurrence):

- Elderly woman who could not care for herself or her apartment. Terrible odor permeating from their bathroom up to ours. Had to call a welfare check bc it honestly smelled like she died (she didn't).

- Immigrant family with Mother and 2 young boys (around ages 10 and 5?). The boys were an absolute terror. The Mother would often leave her children alone, and you could clearly hear the older boy abusing the younger one. It sounded like he would barricade him in one of the bedrooms and the young child would scream, kick, and cry for an hour. Constant screaming and running around at all hours. The children ripped through the stairwell often, vandalizing the walls.

- Alcoholic man with his girlfriend and young child. He would clearly abuse his wife (I could hear him throw her into furniture, and hear the punches). This was done in front of the child, I could hear him cry. The abuse happened in the bedroom (same layout as mine), so I would have to listen to this happen around midnight. One day I had enough, and did a ""courtesy knock"" by taking a hammer to the floor of the bedroom several times in a row. After that I heard him yell ""Stupid Bitch!"". I should have called the cops but I was so scared of this guy. Sometimes I would see the woman in the hall and I would stare right at her, but it was like nothing happened. Later on the guy was served court papers that were stuck in their door.

- Just a shitty guy who would constantly blast loud music and sing like he was at a karaoke bar.

- Current neighbors are quiet as a mouse all week, but as soon as Friday hits, it's a huge fucking party. It's like they have a guest that comes over that makes all the racket? I honestly never see the people who live there. Last I saw was a woman and guy (once). They have several people over, partying all night. Loud music and loud conversations. Last weekend they pulled an all-nighter. Guests didn't leave until 6am (I know bc I was up trying to enjoy my morning coffee and book). Though I will say on occasion I will wake up to extremely loud rap music at 3am during weekdays. WTF! I always sleep with earplugs in, and I also wear earplugs for 9hrs straight at work. It just ticks me off when the parties last until the early morning, bc I need to let my ears breathe!

I wanted to see if anyone would be up for doing something together over the next few days.

I’ve been living by myself for the past couple of months and I’m still getting used to it. Most of my friends are either out of the country or busy with family plans, and with the holidays plus time off work, the days can feel quite long.

Normally I keep a pretty active routine — gym, running, cycling, or padel tennis in the morning — and then I’d usually spend the rest of the day at home watching something, gaming, or learning new things. That’s fine for a while, but I thought it might be healthier to get out and connect with people instead of spending all my time alone.

I’m open to simple, low-key activities:  
walks, coffee or tea, sports, sightseeing, board games, or anything similar.

Just to be upfront: I’m a conservative Muslim, so I don’t drink and I’m not into clubs or parties — but I’m very happy with relaxed, social hangouts that don’t revolve around alcohol.

This season has a way of making time feel faster -- and also more meaningful. As the year winds down, we keep coming back to the same thought: **Ohio’s Ranked Choice Voting movement is stronger, bigger, and more ready than it’s ever been.**

That was the heart of our recent statewide virtual meeting, where we delivered a **“State of the State of RCV” Address** \-- a chance to take stock of what we’ve built together in 2025, and where we’re going next.

# What we built together in 2025

**February: Fun, Food, and Friendship.**

We gathered for our Social Retreat and strengthened the relationships that power this movement.

**March-May: We showed up BIG to fight SB 63.**

When Senate Bill 63 threatened to ban municipalities from using Ranked Choice Voting, Rank the Vote Ohio turned out in force to testify against it. Despite **64 testimonies against** the bill and only **12 organizations testifying in favor** (many from out of state), the Senate passed SB 63 in May -- and it now sits in the House. **Our work helped slow it down, shine a spotlight on it, and build the case against it.** We’re staying vigilant until it’s fully stopped.

**A movement that’s growing fast.**

This year we increased our supporters by **over 6,500** \-- including almost 1,000 in a single day in July.

**Local progress with real potential.**

We’re working with the governments of **Lakewood** and **Cleveland Heights** to share how RCV can strengthen local governance—work that could lead to municipal initiatives **as soon as May 2026!**

**Laying the groundwork in Ohio’s biggest cities.**

We’re working with groups in **Cincinnati** and **Columbus** to put RCV on the ballot in those cities in **2027.**

**Real conversations, statewide.**

Everywhere we go, more people say they understand what Ranked Choice Voting is -- and why it matters. We’ve hosted almost **100 canvasses** across Ohio, and each one makes the next conversation easier.

If you’ve made a call, knocked a door, brought a friend, joined a Zoom, or shared a post -- thank you. You helped create all of this.

# What we’re focused on next

Ohio’s political insiders keep trying to control the rules from the top down. Our strategy keeps building power from the ground up:

*  Stopping SB 63 in the House ([How you can help](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11wZ00nsB2SBDzvKvI0LEZu4TTjnjPkMr/edit#heading=h.gjdgxs)!)
*  Helping local leaders understand how RCV works in practice
*  Preparing for near-term municipal opportunities (and bigger city ballots ahead)
*  Growing our statewide volunteer bench—so we can move quickly when windows open

*Do you share these goals?*

# Become a confident RCV messenger in your own community

The most powerful voice for reform in Ohio is still you -- talking with your friends, coworkers, neighbors, and family.

When you feel confident explaining RCV in plain language, those everyday conversations start to add up. They change expectations and they build the kind of civic pressure that lawmakers can’t ignore.

That’s why we offer regular trainings to help you:

* Understand RCV in clear, simple language   
* Practice how to explain it in two minutes at a door, a meeting, or over coffee   
* Answer the most common questions and myths you’ll hear   
* Plug into a community of other Ohioans who are taking action

Just having something to squeeze during work calls or while watching TV supposedly helps. I bought one. Then another because I liked having different textures. Then a few more because they were cute and cheap.

Fast forward to now and I have 23 of these things. Twenty-three. They’re all over my apartment. On my desk, in my bag, on the coffee table, by my bed. It’s become a problem but also I’m not entirely sure I want to stop?

They do actually help when I’m feeling anxious. But I think I’ve crossed the line from helpful coping mechanism into weird collection obsession. My friends make jokes about it. My mom asked if I was okay when she visited and saw them everywhere.

I keep browsing for new ones online, checking different styles on sites like Alibaba. There are so many variations and I keep thinking just one more won’t hurt. But I said that seventeen squishies ago. Has anyone else developed a strange collection because of anxiety or stress? At what point does a coping mechanism become its own problem?",1,1766511625.0,ToyCollectors,0,1.0,False

I moved to NYC thinking I’d finally get a handle on my finances. I make okay money for my age, nothing crazy but enough to live decently, or so I thought. Between rent creeping up every year, $7 coffees, and the constant “let’s grab a drink” or “quick dinner” invites, I swear my paycheck disappears the second it hits my account.

I genuinely love this city. The energy, the people, the food, the fact that there’s always something happening. There’s something about NYC that makes you want to be out and part of it instead of sitting at home. But at the same time, it feels like just existing here costs way more than it should. I don’t even live flashy. I cook at home, try to budget, walk or take the subway instead of Ubering most days. Still, every month something pops up. Utilities spike, groceries cost more than expected, or some random expense shows up out of nowhere.

What really opened my eyes recently is how much credit affects everything here. Renting, apartment applications, even basic things like setting up utilities or thinking long-term about buying a car someday. I never paid much attention to credit before, but now it feels like it quietly impacts almost every adult decision in this city.",40,1766511617.0,AskNYC,28,0.83,False

1ptzysl,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_RoseannCapannaHodge/comments/1ptzysl/to_the_parent_feeling_like_youre_failing_youre_not/,To the Parent Feeling Like You're Failing: You're Not,"I see you there at 2 AM, googling ""am I a bad parent"" for the hundredth time. I see you comparing yourself to other families and wondering why everything seems so much harder for you. I see you questioning every decision, every response, every moment of frustration or exhaustion. And I need you to hear this: You are not failing. You are not a bad parent. You are human, and you are doing the best you can with the tools you have.



**The Myth of Perfect Parenting**

Social media shows us highlight reels, not reality. The parent posting about their child's academic achievements isn't sharing the three-hour homework battle that preceded it. The family photo with everyone smiling doesn't capture the meltdown that happened five minutes before or after. The organized playroom picture doesn't show the chaos that exists most of the time.



Perfect parenting is a myth that serves no one except the industries that profit from our insecurities. Real parenting is messy, exhausting, overwhelming, and beautiful all at the same time. It's making mistakes, learning from them, and trying again tomorrow.



**When Parenting Feels Impossible**

Some days, everything goes wrong. Your child has a meltdown in the grocery store, homework becomes a battle zone, bedtime stretches for hours, and you find yourself yelling when you promised you wouldn't. These days don't define you as a parent - they define you as human.



Parenting a child with additional needs - whether that's ADHD, autism, anxiety, learning differences, or any other challenge - requires a level of patience, creativity, and resilience that most people can't even imagine. You're not just parenting; you're advocating, researching, coordinating services, managing appointments, and trying to understand complex needs while also managing your own emotions and exhaustion.



**The Weight of Constant Vigilance**

When your child has special needs, you're always ""on."" You're constantly scanning for triggers, monitoring for signs of distress, anticipating needs, and preparing for challenges. This level of hypervigilance is exhausting in ways that are hard to explain to people who haven't lived it.



You notice things other parents don't have to think about: the fluorescent lights that might trigger a meltdown, the change in routine that could derail the entire day, the social situation that might be overwhelming. This awareness is a superpower, but it's also a burden that you carry every single day.



**The Isolation of Different**

When your family's needs are different from typical families, it can feel incredibly isolating. Playdates become complicated when you have to explain your child's needs. Family gatherings become stressful when relatives don't understand. Simple outings require planning and preparation that other families don't need.



You might find yourself declining invitations, avoiding certain places, or leaving events early. This isn't failure - this is you protecting your child and your family's well-being. But it can feel lonely, and that loneliness can feed the voice that tells you you're not doing enough.



**The Grief That No One Talks About**

It's okay to grieve the parenting experience you thought you'd have. It's okay to feel sad about the milestones that look different, the challenges you didn't expect, or the dreams you've had to adjust. This grief doesn't mean you love your child any less - it means you're human.



Grieving the expected while loving what is can happen simultaneously. You can be grateful for your child exactly as they are while also feeling sad about the difficulties they face or the experiences your family misses. Both feelings can be true at the same time.



**The Strength You Don't Recognize**

You've developed skills and strength you never knew you had. You've learned to advocate fiercely for your child's needs. You've become an expert in conditions you'd never heard of before. You've developed patience that amazes even you. You've found creative solutions to problems most people never face.



You've learned to celebrate victories that might seem small to others but are monumental for your family. The successful grocery store trip, the homework completed without tears, the social interaction that went well - these are real achievements that deserve recognition.



**The Love That Drives Everything**

Every Google search at 2 AM, every appointment scheduled, every accommodation requested, every strategy tried - all of it comes from love. The fact that you're questioning whether you're doing enough is actually evidence that you care deeply. Parents who truly aren't trying don't lose sleep worrying about whether they're good enough.



Your love for your child is evident in your exhaustion, your research, your advocacy, and yes, even in your worry. That love is enough, even when it doesn't feel like it.



**What Good Enough Actually Looks Like**

Good enough parenting isn't perfect parenting. It's showing up consistently, even when you're tired. It's apologizing when you make mistakes. It's seeking help when you need it. It's adapting your expectations to meet your child where they are. It's celebrating small victories and learning from setbacks.



Good enough parenting is loving your child fiercely while also taking care of yourself. It's recognizing that you can't pour from an empty cup and that your well-being matters too. It's understanding that being a good parent doesn't mean sacrificing everything for your child.



**The Permission You Need**

You have permission to not be perfect. You have permission to have bad days. You have permission to feel frustrated, overwhelmed, or sad sometimes. You have permission to ask for help. You have permission to take breaks. You have permission to make mistakes and learn from them.



You have permission to celebrate your victories, no matter how small they might seem to others. You have permission to be proud of how far you've come, even if you're not where you want to be yet.



**Building Your Support Network**

You don't have to do this alone. Seek out other parents who understand your journey. Join support groups, online communities, or local organizations. Connect with professionals who can provide guidance and resources. Build a team of people who can support both you and your child.



Remember that asking for help isn't a sign of weakness - it's a sign of wisdom. The strongest parents are those who recognize they can't do everything alone and who actively seek the support they need.



**Taking Care of Yourself**

You matter too. Your needs matter. Your mental health matters. Your happiness matters. Taking care of yourself isn't selfish - it's necessary. You can't give what you don't have, and you can't support your child's well-being if you're running on empty.



Find small ways to nurture yourself, even if it's just five minutes of deep breathing or a cup of coffee while it's still hot. Protect your sleep when possible. Eat nourishing food. Move your body in ways that feel good. Connect with friends. Do things that bring you joy.



**The Long View**

Parenting is a marathon, not a sprint. There will be difficult seasons and easier ones. There will be setbacks and breakthroughs. There will be days when you feel like you're failing and days when you feel like you've got it figured out.



Your child doesn't need a perfect parent - they need a loving, consistent, present parent who is willing to grow and learn alongside them. They need someone who sees their worth, believes in their potential, and loves them unconditionally. You are that person.



**A Message of Hope**

You are stronger than you know. You are more capable than you believe. You are making a bigger difference than you realize. Your child is lucky to have you, not despite your imperfections, but because of your humanity, your love, and your commitment to their well-being.



The fact that you're reading this, that you're seeking information and support, that you're questioning and growing - all of this is evidence of good parenting. You are not failing. You are learning, growing, and loving the best way you know how. And that is enough.



To every parent reading this who needed to hear these words: You are seen. You are valued. You are not alone. And you are doing better than you think.



What would you say to another parent who was feeling like they were failing? Sometimes we need to give ourselves the same compassion we would offer a friend. You deserve that kindness too.



*Remember that if you're struggling with persistent feelings of inadequacy, depression, or anxiety, professional support can be incredibly helpful. Taking care of your mental health is one of the best things you can do for both yourself and your child.*

1ptztps,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tenant/comments/1ptztps/why_does_every_apartment_claim_to_be_luxury_now/,Why does every apartment claim to be “luxury” now?,"

I’ve been apartment hunting again and I swear the word “luxury” has lost all meaning.

Every listing says it. Luxury living. Luxury finishes. Luxury lifestyle. Then you show up and it’s… gray floors, white walls, a stainless steel fridge, and maybe a small gym with two treadmills that are always broken. That’s it. That’s the luxury.

Meanwhile the walls are paper thin, the windows barely block noise, the AC struggles in the summer, and the “resort-style pool” is packed six months out of the year. But somehow the rent is hundreds more because there’s a smart thermostat and a package locker system.

What really gets me is how the pricing doesn’t even feel connected to the actual living experience anymore. It’s all branding. Slap the word luxury on it, add a few amenities people barely use, and suddenly every basic apartment is justified as premium. And if you question it, you’re made to feel like you’re being unrealistic.

Living in these places also comes with so many extra fees now. Valet trash, amenity fees, tech fees, parking fees. It’s not just rent anymore, it’s rent plus a bunch of small charges that quietly add up every month. None of it feels optional, but none of it really improves day-to-day life either.

I’ve noticed it’s made me way more anxious about money than I used to be. Not because I’m reckless, but because everything feels slightly unpredictable. Utilities fluctuate. Fees change. Renewals creep up. So I started relying more on systems that help me see what’s happening instead of finding out too late. 

And I don’t even want luxury. I want quiet walls, stable rent, and fewer surprise charges. That would feel way more premium than a lobby with a coffee machine.

I’ve been apartment hunting again and I swear the word “luxury” has lost all meaning.

Every listing says it. Luxury living. Luxury finishes. Luxury lifestyle. Then you show up and it’s… gray floors, white walls, a stainless steel fridge, and maybe a small gym with two treadmills that are always broken. That’s it. That’s the luxury.

Meanwhile the walls are paper thin, the windows barely block noise, the AC struggles in the summer, and the “resort-style pool” is packed six months out of the year. But somehow the rent is hundreds more because there’s a smart thermostat and a package locker system.

What really gets me is how the pricing doesn’t even feel connected to the actual living experience anymore. It’s all branding. Slap the word luxury on it, add a few amenities people barely use, and suddenly every basic apartment is justified as premium. And if you question it, you’re made to feel like you’re being unrealistic.

Dating apps just feel rushed and transactional. Large social groups feel loud, shallow, and direction-less. I've met a lot of people, but rarely get to actually *know* anyone. Add remote work, isolation, and everyone being scattered across different life phases, and it can feel strangely hard to build anything real, even when you’re open and willing.

I am a 20 years old man, i do care my look and im a little chubby but not much. I'm wearing leather jacket, harleys and tshirts of metal groups. I do look cool and caring my personal look and hygiene.

I know her from my course to university exam, since 2 years ago we was at the course but at diffirent classes. She was pretty and raunchy to everyone. She looks great and we are at same age. So, she is failed at university exam and start working Zara. I was studying Economy but left school for work to university exam again. I text her first In July. We text a little bit and she asked for a date. I rejected her because i was really bussy when she asked me and we cut the communication. After 4-5 month Last week she offered to meet me on her off day, cuz she is working on a shift 8 to 22 and i accept her offer. I have to say, we was not talking much, not even takled one to one only group talkings. Around 15.00 she came to place we are planning to hang out. I hugged her when i saw her and she asked me ""do you know any place to drink?"" i said yes but she wanted to go her favorite pub and we gone to there. We start drinking, at the starting i was'nt dominating by her but after 3 beer i started being numb and dumb we had french fries and after that we paid cost 50-50. I asked her drink more beer but not at pub because there are really %100 expensive than market beers. She said yes and we got 2 more beer for ourself. And we sit on a silent place available to kiss, talk and even sex. We started talking our ex releationships. She was started dominating me, i dont remember every detail but i just remember i was asking her Putting my head on her shoulder and she was accept that. I started asking for approval for everything. Hugging, holding her hand, putting my hand on her shoulder. While i lying on her shoulder she started to stroke my hair and beard and said ""Your beards are cute honey"" all of my libido gone and i feel her like mother. We was drinking our beers and she hold my jaw and turned to her face, she get closed but i scared to kiss her. After this moment i asked her to kiss her and she said """"You can only kiss me if you become my boyfriend, and if you can neither be my boyfriend nor kiss me,"" after that her eyes was shining and she was holding herself to laught but not for kidding or bullying me, she said you're acting impulsively, you don't love me and you never will. I said i really like her and she didnt care it. She gave me her credit card and said get two more beers to us, but i rejected her and said come with me. After that she suddenly start flirting. She became very kindly person and after drinking one more beer she said ""come with me to subway station"" while we are walking to station i was holding her and and while walking she said ""You know, you dont love me"" and i said ""I see a potantial releationship here"" and she said ""But i dont see any potantial on you, i definelety know you will find a woman like me"" and i said ""Thats what she said"" she laught a little and looked a little disappointed about me.

Waiting for GI doctor... However the last 53 days took me to the depths of despair and I am now slowly coming back after losing 43 lbs in that time.

I realize that I ate crap and chugged coffee and soda and ignored many warning signs. I also have massive anxiety and I was on a long gradual slope until I finally entered a free fall that forced me to admit my faults.

Faults:
Overeating before bed.
Sleeping on stomach.
Intermittent fasting during the day keeping full with coffee and diet soda.
Overeating on weekends.
Eating chips and fatty foods.
Doom scrolling and not enough physical activity.

I really was disconnected from the signs of back pain between shoulder blades and somehow did not realize my esophagus was burning.

This escalated to larangitis and wild chest pain and heart palpitations and multiple ER visists. I failed to connect the dots. I stupidly too ""anti inflammatory"" NSAIDs after one visit to the ER that ruled out heart issues.

On my last visit to the ER I had nausea and my digestion felt stopped. I was in agony. I was given a pink shot that burned from my throat to my small intestine but especially had a ring of fire at my esophagus.

Since that day my focus had been 100% on fixing my esophagus and digestion.  Pantoprozale made me feel awful. Switched to Zantac then Pepcid on advice of my Doctor. All tests finally revealed I had a parasite in me. Dieantemba fragillis and I suffered through antibiotic Meteronidozale which further inflamed my stomach for the duration till finished. This reset my gut and got rid of the parasite that mentally gave me a boost and made poops more regular without restoralax.

Each day I struggled to consume low fodmap small meals and keep from dry heaving.

What helped:
Oatmeal and/or 1 soft cooked egg.
Papaya, pears or bananas.
Gaviscon even though it burned. 
Slippery elm even though I gagged on each pill.
Drinking warm water with ginger.
Manuka honey 1/2 tsp even this burned.
Pepcid max off shelf dose morning and night.
Taking time off of work. I had 3+ weeks of vacation banked. I took it all.
Naps with wedge pillow.


I'm not 100% but my stomach isn't twisting and churning constantly anymore.
My appetite hasn't returned but weightloss now slowed down and I am getting more active. Burping is going away and esophagus doesn't radiate pain to my back anymore. Hope is starting change to belief of healing.

I must follow-up and mitigate:
GERD.
Gallbladder sludge.
Kidney stones.
Get down to a healthy weight. 
Never drinking carbonated drinks.
Avoiding NSAIDs that inflame stomach.

I believe the parasite affected anxiety, cravings and gut that made me a habitual tummy sleeper to soothe the discomfort. It is really a tough one to find information about as literature is mixed.

Good luck everyone in your healing!

1ptznif,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttractionDynamics/comments/1ptznif/the_sciencebased_truth_about_approaching_in/,The Science-Based Truth About Approaching in Dating: What Nobody Tells You,"I've spent way too much time analyzing why approaching someone feels like walking through fire. After diving into psychology research, dating experts like Matthew Hussey, and real field experience, I'm convinced we're all getting terrible advice. The ""just be confident bro"" crowd has no idea what they're talking about.

Here's what's actually happening in your brain when you see someone attractive. Your amygdala freaks out like you're facing a tiger. Not because you're broken or pathetic, but because rejection triggers the same neural pathways as physical pain. Your brain literally cannot tell the difference between getting turned down and getting punched. Society also loves to make this harder by painting approach anxiety as some personal failing when it's just basic neuroscience.

The good news is you can rewire this response, and it's not through forced affirmations or ""alpha male"" nonsense.

**Start with micro exposures.** Forget the high stakes stuff. Ask a barista for recommendations. Compliment someone's dog at the park. Make small talk with the cashier. You're training your nervous system to stay calm during brief interactions. Every small exchange builds evidence that talking to strangers won't kill you. This isn't fluff, it's literally how exposure therapy works for anxiety disorders.

**The 3 second rule is scientifically backed.** Research on decision making shows your rational brain gets hijacked after about three seconds of hesitation. That's when your amygdala takes over and manufactures every worst case scenario. When you feel the impulse to approach, you've got three seconds to move before your brain talks you out it. Don't think, just walk over. The words will come.

Mark Manson's book Models completely changed how I think about attraction. This dude was a dating coach who got sick of the pickup artist garbage and wrote something honest. The core idea is radical vulnerability, being willing to express your interest knowing you might get rejected. That's actually what confidence is, not this fake bravado nonsense. The book breaks down why neediness repels people and how to develop genuine self respect that makes you magnetic. Insanely practical read that feels like talking to your smartest friend about dating.

BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app built by Columbia alumni and Google engineers that turns expert knowledge into personalized podcasts with adaptive learning plans. It actually includes Models and tons of psychology research on social dynamics, all condensed into audio you can customize from quick 10-minute summaries to detailed 40-minute deep dives with real examples. You can pick voices that match your vibe, even a sarcastic narrator if that's your thing, and pause mid-episode to ask your AI coach Freedia questions about applying concepts to your specific situation. The learning plan adapts based on what you highlight and discuss, so it keeps evolving with your progress in building social confidence.

**Reframe rejection as data collection.** You're not trying to win over every person, you're filtering for mutual compatibility. When someone isn't interested, they just saved you weeks of pursuing the wrong match. This isn't cope, it's efficiency. Getting rejected 10 times to find one great connection is an incredible success rate compared to sitting home collecting zero data.

**Have a default opener that requires zero creativity.** ""Hey, I thought you seemed interesting and I'd regret not saying hi"" works because it's honest and direct. You're not performing or trying to be clever. Authenticity beats rehearsed lines every time because people can smell bullshit from a mile away. If they're not receptive to straightforward interest, they weren't going to be interested in your clever opener either.

The Mating Grounds podcast by Tucker Max and Dr. Geoffrey Miller dives deep into evolutionary psychology and modern dating. They explain why we're wired to fear rejection and how to use that knowledge practically. One episode covers approach anxiety from a neuroscience angle that genuinely helped me understand I wasn't defective, just dealing with outdated biological programming. Really solid content that bridges science and real world application.

**Practice outcome independence religiously.** Your goal isn't getting a number or a date, it's becoming someone who approaches despite fear. Every time you talk to someone attractive, you win regardless of their response. You're literally strengthening neural pathways that associate approaching with safety rather than danger. After enough reps, your brain stops treating it like a threat.

Stop consuming endless content about approaching and just start doing it badly. Stumbling through five awkward conversations teaches you more than reading another guide. Your brain needs experiential evidence that rejection is survivable, not more theoretical knowledge.

The last thing, approach during the day in normal contexts, not just bars and clubs. Coffee shops, bookstores, parks. People are more receptive when they're not in high pressure social environments and you seem like a normal person living life, not someone hunting for dates.",1,1766510692.0,AttractionDynamics,0,1.0,False

I'm here because I miss having someone I can talk to regularly. Someone I can text through the day, share random thoughts with, laugh a little, and slowly get to know without any pressure.

I'm calm by nature, but I enjoy depth. I like conversations that go beyond small talk, a bit of teasing, and that feeling when talking to someone just feels easy. I'm spiritual but not religious, and I enjoy thinking about life, people, and how we change over time. I believe connection should feel natural and safe, not rushed or forced.

I'm a good listener and I genuinely care when I talk to someone. Kindness, honesty, and communication matter to me. I'm not into games, ghosting, or drama. I like people who are warm, emotionally aware, and comfortable being themselves.

I enjoy simple comforts. The smell of fresh coffee in the morning, dark chocolate, instant noodles on lazy days, good music, and quiet evenings. Sometimes an occasional joint helps take the edge off everyday life and slow things down a bit.

I'm open minded about relationships and believe trust, consent, and respect matter more than labels. I'm hoping to meet a nice woman who enjoys talking, sharing thoughts, and building something slowly. Friendship first, connection next, and we see where it goes.

I was struggling to understand my own feelings around these unspoken rules about when someone is a friend or just an acquaintance, more than I am criticizing the individual person I thought was a friend. 

  
Autistic individuals often have difficulty distinguishing between casual acquaintances and genuine friends. Many believe that this is the fault of the Autistic individual in the situation, but is it actually? In this example, I met a lady who worked at PetsMart when I owned a  cat at the time and I shopped there about once a month. 

  
We introduced ourselves, quickly became friends, and continued having conversations about once a month. After about 2 years of regular conversation we exchanged phone numbers and I invited her to get coffee with me, my treat. This continued for about 3 years, we got along extremely well, she seemed to like me, everything was going great until I noticed that she denied my Facebook friend request.  
  
On her birthday I sent her a happy birthday text and said, “We still haven’t set a day in stone to get coffee! What day works best? I look forward to it!” She said, “Thanks for the birthday wishes but I don’t recognize this number. Who is this?” I continued by saying ""My name is\_\_\_. Don’t you remember, we exchanged numbers? In case you forgot, here’s a picture of me.” to which she responded ""Sorry, but I don’t want any continued contact from you. I don’t wish ill on you, have a nice life, but don’t disturb me at work.""  
  
I was so confused. I had a genuinely good time, she appeared to as well. I genuinely liked her as a person, she seemed to like me as well, we seemed to have a lot in common, we both loved animals, etc., but when it got down to it, at the end of the day I was ""just some acquaintance."" This has been a common theme in my life and the life of many Autistic people, and I've heard that exact reply to me thinking I was friends with someone multiple times in my life.  
  
So, where is the disconnect? Well, psychologists, and other powers that be would blame our inability to read a situation, and I'm sure in some examples that might be true, but when you are being fed false information to work with from the ""just be nice even if you don't mean it"" crowd, how is that our fault? Instead of going that route, let me propose an entirely different concept for you.  
  
We are often told we are ""too much,"" ""too brutally honest,"" ""too forward,"" Etc., as if this is some sort of character flaw. But, if Autistic people are bringing genuine feelings, intentions, and motives to these situations, then who's actually at fault? There is no pretentiousness, there are no ulterior motives, there is no smoke, no mirrors. We are what you get, and it is non-autistic people who seem to have a problem with it.  
  
I don't sit around and lament this particular moment, because I realized a long time ago that I wasn't the problem. My emotions, intentions, etc. were genuine, hers were not, and I will not blame myself for someone else's inability to be genuine, or handle the fact that I myself am. We are real, our emotions, intentions, all of it. Autistic people are not at fault for being authentic, nor for our inability to fake these things the way others do.  
  
And the real reality is, to the Autistic people reading, if someone can't handle our authenticity, they don't deserve it. They don't deserve our trust, compassion, caring, kindness, or our presence. But given the genuine way that many of us are, they will likely still have it. I myself, hope PetsMart lady is well from afar, wherever she may be.",8,1766510449.0,autism,10,0.9,False

1ptzfwa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectricians/comments/1ptzfwa/ge_outlet_timer_for_old_coffee_maker_is_my/,GE outlet timer for old coffee maker - is my proposed usage safe and effective?,"After another crappy modern coffee maker failed after one year (water started leaking out of the base of the machine, which according to reviews is a ubiquitous problem across all major makes and models that would be considered affordable), I want to go back to an old Mr. Coffee model. Fairly old. I believe it's from the early '90s. 

This model has never been recalled for fire hazard as far as I can tell, but I know similar older ones were in the late '70s. It does have a polarized plug. No automatic shutoff, just an on/off toggle switch. 

To be extra safe, I had the idea to use a basic [GE outlet timer](https://a.co/d/eWoKhkI) so there will be no power available to the machine outside of a set time frame (say, 4am - 8am).

Would this be safe and effective? The outlet timer is rated for 15 amps ""general purpose"" and ""resistive"" and the coffee maker would be kept OFF until we woke up and turned it on.",2,1766510188.0,AskElectricians,8,1.0,False

1ptzfcp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ptzfcp/aitah_for_cutting_off_my_dad_and_the_rest_of_his/,AITAH for cutting off my dad and the rest of his family?,"So I was (16ftm) my daddy's little girl. I am considered a live child my mother and father never got married when I was born and my mom has had a terrible relationship with my dad because he got another woman pregnant at the same time my mom was 4 months pregnant with me. 

Anyway my dad was a ""good"" father. I mean bought me anything I wanted withhim it was so much fun cause I saw all my cousins and brothers ect. My dad never really had one girlfriend after my mom he was dating the other woman he got pregnant and gave birth to my little brother who's 5 months younger than me as well as my youngest brother. While as a kid I was a daddy's girl, my dad was irresponsible he often left me and my brothers unattended he'd let us stay up for long hours no sleep. To most kids it sounds like a dream but id often go back home to my mom hungry and would drop weight very quickly. Also had no stable living he would mainly freeload in his girlfriend's house or whatever. 

Then when I was maybe 7-9 there was an incident (TW: SA). I was so young and my dad had this habit of telling me don't ask questions. He'd always shut me down. And when I was young my older cousin molested me he was like a year or 2 older than me. The following morning I told my father about what happened. He said and I quote. ""Be quiet stop being a snitch."" idk about anyone else be isn't it weird!? What father says that to his daughter!? And because of that I never said anything again until like a few months later my mom could tell something was bothering me so I just told her expecting to be shut down instead she blew up at my dad. I was still to young to fully understand my dad was wrong so I stayed loving him. 

I didn't see my dad for a while but when I did he had a new girlfriend. I rlly liked her she was kind sweet and a mom so she took good care of me and her son. Anw one night they were upstairs me and her son were down stairs in the apartment. Suddenly there's a crash he threw the woman down badly hurting her an this wasn't the first instance he did the same with his previous girlfriend leaving he with bruises often. our relationship began to crack when I was 11-12 and he took me out to some place with his newest girlfriend her daughter and my 2 younger brothers.we had fun nothing crazy. Then after the first night I was the first to wake up a habit from waking up early for school. The girlfriend (we'll call her Ali) got up to use the bathroom and shower the dad then wakes up and not seeing her calls her a B and a W fortunately the kids were asleep so they didn't have to see it. My dad was banging on the door when Ali came out and said she was just using the bathroom.my dad told me to get into the shower. I was a bit worried but listened not wanting to agitate the situation so I got in the shower or I was about to when suddenly I hear a crash and so I’m just in my towel now because it’s too sudden I wasn’t about to go put on my clothes that I walked out and I now see Ali is on the floor crying. 

My glasses are across the room. The coffee table is also across the room and my dad is angry so anyway now this has happened and now I’m upset now I don’t wanna be here. I wanna get out of the situation and I want him to leave her alone and now the kids as well are awake and are crying especially the woman’s daughter and now I have to calm them down etc. etc. so I then go for my phone to call my mom, but my phone is off at the moment and I don’t have Wi-Fi so I asked my dad for the Wi-Fi and he refuses to tell (There is a couch pullout bed in the middle of the room and it was pulled out cause that’s where me and the kids were sleeping) Now I am on the other side of the bed and my dad is on the side. He’s now chasing me around it because I said I don’t wanna be here anymore and I said that I wanted to leave until the point where mind you again I’m in just a towel and I’m just trying to cover up myself. He takes his bare hand and slaps my back leaving it red and bruised and I was already crying but now I’m hysterical and I’m trying to calm down.

He also took my phone so I couldn’t call anyone and then left out with it so there’s no way of communication now I’m in a dangerous situation and I have anxiety. I don’t know what to do. I’m panicking. The kids are crying and I’m trying to calm them down after he’s left now then I realized that Ali left her phone in the kitchen and saw I immediately go to the kitchen and I call my mother while I’m calling her. I’m struggling to breathe. I have asthma. I’m hysterical. I’m crying bawling my eyes out. I can’t like form a sentence. I’m struggling and my mom tells me to calm down but then my brother who’s like five months younger than me he looks me in my face, smiles, and laughs and says ""i’m going to tell dad that you called your mom."" 

in every version of the scenario, I wouldn’t think that my brother would be a part of the problem but he was and I was able to call my mom before my dad got back like like just moving passes then he tells us to go to Walmart. my brother is Kiki and laughing in my face because now we won’t be there when my mom gets there or whatever we get to Walmart we buy we buy we get back. I’m quiet. I’m not saying a word. I’m just waiting for my mom to get to me. She finally gets to the door. She takes me home. I’m out of the situation and I’m relieved, but I’m still traumatized, unfortunately. 

I finally get home and I stopped talking to my dad. Then he calls my phone after I told my mom everything he calls my phone and he is upset that I’m not talking to him and I confront him about the situation and tell him why and I can hear him say it with a straight face he said he didn’t do anything . He immediately denied it no hesitation I was beyond upset and angry, but I forgave him because I was like this is just a one time situation he wouldn’t hurt me like this on purpose or again then manipulated me and told me he would never do that and he's so sorry etc. etc.

our relationship was never the same after that incident. I became more distant, and I didn’t feel the most comfortable around him, but because he was my father, I tried to maintain a relationship. I tried to be nice, but I was now able to see through a lot of his lies and a lot of them manipulate things that he said, and so it made me dislike him more. Thus at some point, I realized he wasn’t going to try and apologize for the things he did know he was going to keep ignoring it and brushing it off like it was nothing so I decided to cut him off when he made me cry and balls my eyes out because I wanted to be home at 9:30 instead of having my mom or me up extremely late for Thanksgiving so I decided then to cut them all this is his last year with me.

1ptzf5t,https://www.reddit.com/r/SameGrassButGreener/comments/1ptzf5t/hard_time_deciding_between_chicago_vs_philly/,"Hard time deciding between Chicago vs Philly, they're both amazing options!","So I'm going to have to move away from NYC when my lease is up on March 1 because I simply can't justify living here anymore. I need to save, I can't be living paycheck to paycheck in my mid 30s.

As you can imagine I love the big city vibes, the cultural, artistic, social energy that you get, so I'm setting my sights on major cities that are more affordable than NYC and have sort of narrowed it down to 2: Chicago and Philly.

I've visited both of them and love them both. Here's what I see as their pros and cons:

Chicago:

is the closest to NYC in scale, yet more affordable. The job market is better than Philly's (I'm a truck driver with a CDL A, and there are plenty of trucking jobs in Philly don't get me wrong, so I'm not sure how important that is, but objectively the logistics sector is just much more developed in Chicago). It's the closest to a world class city in the US that normal people can still live in. The nightlife, theater, music etc is all going to be slightly stronger than Philly. However the rent is also somewhat higher. I'm concerned that rent close to my potential workplaces is not as easy to find, nor as well connected by transit, as the rest of the city.

Philly:

has a really quiet, down to earth vibe (compared to a city of its size) that I really dig. It feels like a sort of refuge for ambitious artists who want to be close to NYC but can't afford it, which creates an interesting vibe. I love the aesthetics -- the rowhomes are so freaking cute, and even though chicago also has a nice urban fabric, especially skyscraper-wise, Philly just edges it on aesthetic uniqueness. The rent is cheaper. But the job market in my field offers fewer choices (and possibly lower pay ceiling).

It's really hard to choose. I feel like they're both excellent choices, and I have to make a decision fairly soon once I have to start apartment hunting. Would love input from ppl who've lived in both, if there are any hidden factors that I haven't noticed. I've only visited either city for a few days, so there must be nuances I'm missing.

FWIW, I'm mid 30s, single (and comfortable with it), don't need much more space than 500 sq ft, love live music, theater, and movies, like to go out clubbing/drinking maybe once a month so nightlife in that sense is not suuuper important -- what I prefer are artsy social scenes if that makes sense. Like there's a coffee shop in NYC, Caffeine Underground, that opens until midnight, that have all kinds of open mics and art events every night. That's the sort of place I gravitate to.

Edited to add: One thing that I forgot to mention though is that Philly's public transit lags behind Chicago's. If it wasn't for that Philly would've won hands down no brainer",4,1766510137.0,SameGrassButGreener,13,1.0,False

1ptze0z,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialBlueprint/comments/1ptze0z/why_being_perfect_makes_people_trust_you_less_the/,"Why Being ""Perfect"" Makes People Trust You LESS: The Science-Backed Pratfall Effect","I spent months trying to be flawless at work. Perfect presentations. Zero mistakes. Polished everything. Then I accidentally spilled coffee on my shirt right before a client pitch and made a joke about it. Guess what? That client became one of our longest partnerships. Turns out there's actual psychology behind why that works.



The pratfall effect is this weird phenomenon where showing minor flaws actually makes you MORE likeable and trustworthy, not less. Researchers found that highly competent people who make small mistakes are perceived as warmer and more relatable than those who seem perfect. It's counterintuitive as hell but backed by decades of social psychology research.



Here's the catch though. This only works if you've already established competence. If you're constantly screwing up, another mistake just reinforces incompetence. But when someone clearly knows their stuff and then shows a human moment? That's when the magic happens. People are exhausted by the Instagram perfection culture. Everyone's pretending to have it together 24/7 and it creates distance.



Share your learning process openly. When you're working on something new, don't wait until you've mastered it to talk about it. Document the messy middle part. I started doing this with a new software system at work and people actually came to me MORE for advice because they saw I understood the struggle. It made my eventual expertise feel more accessible. The key is being honest about what you're figuring out while still demonstrating overall competence in your field.



Admit when you don't know something immediately. This one's huge. Instead of bullshitting your way through or giving a vague answer, just say ""I don't know off the top of my head, but I'll find out and get back to you."" Then actually follow through. It signals confidence and reliability. I learned this from a podcast interview with organizational psychologist Adam Grant where he talked about how the smartest people in the room are usually the quickest to admit knowledge gaps. It separates genuine expertise from fake authority.



There's a book called Influence by Robert Cialdini that breaks down this principle beautifully. Cialdini's a professor emeritus at Arizona State and this book is basically the bible of persuasion psychology, cited in thousands of academic papers. He talks about how acknowledging weaknesses before strengths makes your strengths more believable. The book will completely change how you think about persuasion and trust building. It's not manipulative, it's just understanding how human psychology actually works. One chapter focuses on why car salespeople who point out a minor flaw in a vehicle are more trusted than those who claim everything's perfect. Insanely good read that applies to literally every interaction you have.



BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app that turns expert knowledge from books, research papers, and talks into personalized audio content and adaptive learning plans based on your goals. Built by Columbia alumni and former Google engineers, it lets you customize everything from podcast length (quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with examples) to the voice and tone of your virtual coach, Freedia. You can literally pause mid-episode to ask questions or request deeper explanations on specific concepts. The app pulls from high-quality, fact-checked sources and creates a structured learning path that evolves as you interact with it, which is useful if you're trying to systematically build knowledge in areas like psychology or leadership instead of just consuming random content.



Use strategic vulnerability in leadership. If you're managing people or leading projects, share appropriate struggles. Not trauma dumping, but stuff like ""This decision kept me up last night because of X and Y factors"" or ""I'm worried about this timeline but here's how we'll tackle it."" It humanizes you while maintaining authority. Research from Brené Brown's work on vulnerability shows this creates psychological safety in teams, which directly correlates with performance.



Make your mistakes visible but your recovery impressive. When you mess up in front of people, acknowledge it quickly with some lightness, then show how you fix it. I once sent a report with wrong data to my entire team. Instead of pretending it didn't happen, I sent a follow up within an hour with corrected info and a self deprecating subject line. People remembered how I handled it more than the mistake itself. The recovery becomes the story.



Tell stories that include your failures. When you're explaining how you got somewhere or teaching something, include the part where you failed first. Not in a self pitying way, but matter of factly. ""I tried this approach three times before I realized I needed to..."" It makes your success feel earned and your advice feel tested. There's actually an app called Insight Timer that has tons of talks from experts who do this really well, sharing both wisdom and the messy path to getting it.



The whole point is that perfection creates distance. Competence plus humanity creates connection. And connection is what actually builds lasting authority and influence. People don't follow perfect people, they follow real ones who happen to be really good at what they do. The pratfall effect works because it resolves that tension between wanting to look up to someone and wanting to relate to them.



Stop trying to seem flawless. Start trying to seem capable and human. That's the actual formula.

The morning had been ordinary. Sunlight filtered through the windows of downtown apartments, streets buzzed with life, and the smell of coffee mingled with exhaust. For most, it was just another day. For Noha, twenty years old and oblivious to what would come, it was the last ordinary morning he would ever know.
Then the sky tore.
It began as a shimmer, a distortion over the horizon. People paused, squinting. Birds fell silent. And then it appeared: a Visitor, enormous and ethereal, hovering above the city like a storm given form. Its surface shifted between metal and shadow, bending the air around it. Cars skidded into each other. Civilians screamed and scattered. Emergency sirens rang out, too little too late. Soldiers mobilized, but their weapons seemed insignificant against the alien colossus.
Buildings shook and splintered. Windows shattered. The street beneath Noha’s feet quaked, throwing him to the ground. Around him, people vanished in bursts of light and distortion. Panic spread like wildfire, but no one could stop it.
From a high-rise observation deck, Dr. Hale watched calmly. Every order he gave over the comms sounded measured, heroic, reasonable. Yet behind the façade, his mind was already plotting. Every deployment, every tactical command, subtly nudged humanity toward a path only he and a few others understood. Humanity had survived this first encounter, but survival would become a far darker burden than they could imagine.
The Visitor withdrew by nightfall, leaving the city in ruins. Fires burned unchecked. Smoke choked the streets. Noha, trembling and covered in dust, stared at the devastation, knowing that life as it had been was gone forever.

Something you should know about the story

Time Skip – Present


Decades later, the surface of Earth had become a grave. Humanity clung to life underground, in vast cities carved into the crust, beneath layers of reinforced steel and concrete. The sun was a memory; the sky, a myth. The surface was forbidden, a dangerous place for ghosts of a world that had died slowly over years of fighting.
Noha sat in AEGIS headquarters, the glow of tactical monitors washing over his face. His fingers hovered over the coordination panel, guiding squads, marking safe zones, logging casualties. He was not a soldier, not on the frontlines, but the weight of the battlefield pressed on him nonetheless. Each screen told a story of destruction: collapsed tunnels, incinerated squads, civilians trapped and lost. He memorized their names, because memory was all he had left of the living.
Another Visitor had appeared, massive and shifting, bending gravity and light. Squads deployed; many did not return. Noha’s eyes moved over the displays, calculating, coordinating, helpless. Each victory seemed hollow. Each defeat, a tragedy. And still, the battles came, relentless as the decay of the world itself.

After humanity moved underground, AEGIS began studying the distortions left behind by the Visitors—areas where sound bent and machines failed, as if the planet itself had been wounded. Dr. Hale called it resonance: a shared frequency between the Visitors and Earth.
Project LUCENT was approved to study it. Officially, the goal was simple—capture a Visitor, extract its core structure, and build a system capable of controlling or neutralizing them. SOLACE provided the funding, calling it a final hope for survival.
Deep beneath the city, a captured Visitor was suspended in containment. Its presence unsettled everyone nearby. Hale ignored the reports and focused on the data. When human neural signals synchronized with the creature’s frequency, the readings stabilized instead of collapsing.
From that discovery, the Resonance Core was created.
On paper, it was a weapon. In truth, Hale understood what it really did—it aligned all living signals into a single, quiet rhythm. No pain. No resistance. Just an ending that felt like rest.
He shared only what AEGIS needed to hear.
The rest of the truth waited.
And when Hale noticed that one young operator, Noha, could stand near the Core without flinching, he marked him quietly.
Some endings, after all, required a steady hand.

Over the following weeks, the underground city became a symphony of war. Sector 12 was engulfed in chaos as a Visitor ripped through the tunnels. Armor clanged against impossible force, yet it shattered. Soldiers fell mid-stride. Sector 7 saw evacuation squads ambushed; screams echoed through hollow conduits as civilians were lost. Sector 3’s tunnels collapsed entirely, trapping dozens beneath tons of concrete.
Noha moved like a ghost among the monitors, guiding what he could, witnessing everything he could not prevent. The names of the fallen haunted him, etched into memory like scars on his mind. Each loss deepened the gnawing realization: survival had become a form of cruelty.


Meanwhile, in the hidden chambers of power, SOLACE convened. The group of elites — scientists, philosophers, politicians — had long since realized that humanity’s continued survival was not mercy, but suffering. Dr. Hale, their secret ally within AEGIS, began manipulating the defenders with careful precision. He issued orders to capture a Visitor under the guise of weaponization, emphasizing safety protocols while hiding the true purpose of the mission.
For years, he guided humanity’s defenders toward a plan they could not comprehend. Every lie, every manipulation, was calculated to bring them closer to the inevitable end. Only the Core remained, waiting for someone with the authority to act — someone like Noha.
The signs were subtle at first. Visitors that were captured behaved curiously, observing rather than attacking. Protocols made little tactical sense. Dr. Hale’s private communications contained hints of a far-reaching plan. Slowly, as the battles continued and the casualties mounted, Noha began to piece it together.
The truth was chilling: the Visitors were not weapons. The Resonance Core was not a tool of war. It was a device to end humanity peacefully. SOLACE had decided that survival was cruelty, and Dr. Hale had agreed in secret, ensuring that the defenders remained unaware of their true purpose.
Noha’s heart sank as he realized the weight of what had been orchestrated, and the only question left was: who would give consent to activate it?
The Final Choice
The last Visitor had been captured. The Resonance Core glowed softly in the central chamber, awaiting the human touch that would decide the fate of all life. Outside, battles raged. Soldiers fell mid-strike, tunnels collapsed, and screams echoed in the dim underground corridors.
Noha approached the Core. He thought of the friends he had lost, of soldiers and civilians alike, of cities broken and lives ended. The screens reflected faces he would never forget. The full scope of humanity’s suffering pressed down on him.
He pressed the panel.
Time froze. The Visitors halted mid-motion, suspended in a quiet grace. Pain vanished. Fear dissolved. Suffering ceased. Life folded gently into silence.
Epilogue
Noha remained, the last conscious witness. The underground tunnels were still, the monitors dark. Humanity’s end had come, not with fire or chaos, but with mercy. And in that moment, Noha understood the truth of it all: sometimes, the greatest act of courage is choosing to let go.
The war was over. The world was over. And Noha, a boy who had watched from behind monitors, had chosen the final mercy for all.",1,1766509960.0,story,0,1.0,False

1ptzbum,https://www.reddit.com/r/llivo/comments/1ptzbum/how_to_make_christmas_travelers_feel_like_family/,How to Make Christmas Travelers Feel Like Family,"  


**Christmas travel** is never casual. Guests arrive carrying memories, emotions, and expectations shaped by family traditions and personal history. Some are reuniting with loved ones. Others are creating new rituals far from home. And some are quietly spending the holidays alone.

When travelers choose your home during Christmas, they are not just booking a stay—they are trusting you with how they feel during one of the most emotionally significant seasons of the year. This is where hosts who lead with empathy, presence, and care truly stand out.

At **Llivo**, hosting has always been about human connection. As shared in the [**Story of Llivo**](https://www.llivo.com/p/story-of-llivo), small, intentional acts can turn a simple stay into something deeply meaningful. During Christmas, those acts help guests feel a powerful sense of belonging.

https://preview.redd.it/jykwi4sbiz8g1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=0bb1c31c4a153c09ac4ca2a588f74313fe0b5d0a

**Welcome Them Like You Were Expecting Family**  
  
Christmas guests often arrive carrying more than luggage—they bring emotional expectations shaped by the season. A single, intentional pre-arrival message helps set boundaries of warmth and reassurance before they step inside. A brief note such as, *“Your place is ready and warm—I’m glad you chose to stay here this Christmas,”* establishes presence without overexplaining. When hosts lead with clarity and intention, guests arrive calmer, more trusting, and already aligned with the experience—reducing friction and increasing the likelihood of repeat stays.



# Create a First Impression That Feels Like Home

Family never welcomes you with darkness or silence. Your space should not either.

Before guests arrive:

* Soft lamps switched on
* Comfortable indoor temperature
* A neatly folded blanket on the sofa
* A short handwritten welcome note

These small gestures quietly communicate care. Especially during Christmas, this sense of preparation helps guests emotionally settle in faster. This is one reason **Luxury Vacation Rentals** that prioritize atmosphere consistently outperform standard listings during the holiday season.

# Keep Christmas Décor Gentle and Inclusive

Not every guest celebrates Christmas the same way—and some do not celebrate it at all. Making travelers feel like family means respecting differences without assumptions.

Safe, inclusive décor includes:

* Neutral winter accents
* Soft lighting
* A subtle pine element or minimal ornament
* Warm, calming colors

Inclusivity creates comfort. **Comfort creates trust**. And trust is the foundation of great hosting, especially on platforms like **Llivo**, where human-first hosting is central to the brand.



# Offer Comfort the Way Family Does

Family anticipates needs without making a show of it. Thoughtful hosts do the same.

Christmas guests especially appreciate:

* Extra blankets
* Fresh, warm bedding
* Hot chocolate, tea, or coffee
* Seasonal mugs
* Easy-to-find kitchen essentials

These details may seem small, but they align with [**Essential Rental Amenities**](https://www.llivo.com/p/essential-rental-amenities) that directly influence guest satisfaction and reviews during winter stays.



# Share Local Tips Like a Local Relative

Families do not overwhelm you with lists. They tell you the one or two things that actually matter.

Instead of generic guides, share:

* A quiet café open on Christmas morning
* A peaceful park for winter walks
* A bakery known for holiday treats
* Local grocery store holiday hours

This kind of guidance feels personal, not promotional. Hosts who follow[ **Policies and Best Practices** ](https://www.llivo.com/p/maximize-rental-income)while adding this personal layer consistently deliver better guest experiences.



# Be Present Without Hovering

Making guests feel like family does not mean constant interaction. It means availability without pressure.

A single message is enough:  
“Hope you’re settling in well. I’m nearby if you need anything.”

Many Christmas travelers value privacy and emotional space. Respecting that need builds comfort and long-term trust—two things that matter far more than over-communication.



# Care About Their Journey, Not Just the Stay

Family worries about how you get there, not just where you sleep. Christmas travel includes risks such as winter weather, traffic congestion, and late-night driving.

Support guests by:

* Offering airport pickup when possible
* Recommending trusted transport options
* Sharing weather or traffic updates
* Suggesting safer travel routes

Hosts who provide transportation guidance often see higher satisfaction and better occupancy, especially when aligned with strategies like [**Boost Occupancy With Pickup Services**.](https://llivo.com/p/vacation-rentals-with-bike-rides)



# Make the Kitchen Feel Like a Gathering Place

Even when guests are not cooking full meals, the kitchen carries emotional weight during Christmas.

Simple touches matter:

* Tea, cocoa, or coffee
* A clean kettle and mugs
* Basic spices and cooking oil
* Clear appliance instructions

A welcoming kitchen allows guests to create small rituals of comfort—just as they would at home.



# End With a Warm Christmas Goodbye

Families never rush goodbyes. A thoughtful checkout message leaves a lasting impression.

For example:  
“Thank you for staying with us this Christmas. Wishing you warmth, peace, and safe travels ahead.”

That final note often becomes the memory guests associate with your home—and with your hosting style.



# Final Words: Why This Matters

Making Christmas travelers feel like family is not about over-decorating or over-communicating. It is about intention, empathy, and presence. It is about recognizing that guests are human beings navigating one of the most emotional seasons of the year—and meeting them with genuine care.

This is what **Llivo** stands for.  
Hosting rooted in humanity.  
Stays shaped by kindness.  
**Experiences that feel personal, not procedural.**

I finished grad school at the end of last year and started a job with a bit of a commute. I no longer had time for my morning V60 so I splurged on an Aiden to streamline the process. After settling in on a recipe and learning to compensate for the higher extraction, the Aiden consistently makes cups that are 90% as good as my best pour-over. While my best pour-over cup beats the best Aiden cup, I’ll take the connivence and  consistency of 90% every weekday morning.

While I use this function only once every couple of weeks (my wife’s not a coffee drinker so I only go batch when my brother in law comes over), the Batch Brew functionality also tastes great. You just need to remember to stir the pot before pouring because the carafe design doesn’t enable mixing as the coffee brews.

Recipe: I’ve bounced around with variations on the Hoffmann 1-Cup and Lance Bloom + 1 Pour but my daily driver recipe is this one created by the Coffee Chronicler: https://brew.link/p/PGbM.

Dose: 18.9g coffee, 320ml water

Coffee: I only brew light roasts (the first half of the year I had a Sey subscription and the second half I’ve done the Africa subscription from Tandem Coffee roasters. It rocks.) 

Water: I use 1/2 strength TWW for my water. 

Grinder: 1Zpresso K-Ultra. I usually grind between 7.5-8.5, with my zero set at the point in which the handle no longer moves. 

Overall I just love the machine, it speeds up my  morning routine. I grind the beans, press a button three times, and then can go shower and brush my teeth while it brews. 

I’ve seen a lot of hate for the machine on the sub in terms of mechanical issues/quality control. I’m not discounting their experiences at all, there may indeed be some QC issues, but I’ve luckily had no problems. People tend to only review and post if they have issues (I’m guilty of that) so I thought I’d just give a review of something positive for once.

8:00 am is pretty good too but the lighting isn't there in the winter mornings sometimes. Sure you can catch the sunrise sometimes but other days it's just too grey.

Equally, 6:00 is hideously uninteresting. Just a line of hands. Repulsive.

1ptyx09,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ptyx09,Tombow MONO graph GRIP,"When the grip is the highlight.

* **MODEL:**

Tombow MONO graph GRIP (pale green limited edition) – model **DPA-152F**  
0.5 mm *(only available in 0.5 mm)*    

* **MATERIALS:**

The GRIP has a plastic body, metal cone tip and stainless-steel pocket clip. And of course, it’s defining trait: a silicone rubber grip. Inside you get a full-brass clutch, stainless steel spring and metal counter-weight, and everything else is plastic. Even the locking mechanism, which is also the base of the pocket clip, is plastic.

* **ERASER:**

In terms of erasing power, MONO graphs are terrific. The GRIP comes with Tombow’s most excellent white latex eraser, in a bar of 25 × 5.3 mm. To use it, you have to unscrew it out, since it doesn’t have an eraser cap.

* **MEASUREMENTS:**

The GRIP is 147 mm long, and the center of mass is located at 69 mm from the tip. The body is 10.2 mm wide, and that falls a bit to 9.7 mm on the grip’s thinnest part, getting back up to 10.2 mm right above the cone tip. On my coffee scale it tipped the scale at 16.94 g.

* **FEATURES:**

Think of the GRIP as a [MONO graph 10^(th) Anniversary](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechanicalpencils/comments/1n0mp1j/tombow_mono_graph_10th_anniversary_edition/) LE, but with a rubber grip. Therefore, it’s a shaker with a locking mechanism. Push the pocket clip up and the counter-weight will be locked in place. You can knock the lead by pushing the pocket clip down, but that will also unlock the system.

* **AESTHETICS:**

In my eyes the GRIP looks quite handsome, especially in this creamy white with a slight tint of green. In fact, I would go as far as saying that it looks “sophisticated”. Tombow offers the GRIP in ivory, blue, beige and purple. As limited editions there’s also pale blue, pale green (mine) and pale pink, yet I *think* these are discontinued.

* **ERGONOMICS:**

Possibly, the GRIP is my best MONO graph in terms of comfort. It has the same dimensions of other MONOs, but that rubber grip makes it feel much more comfortable. I’m not the greatest fan of shakers, but here the system works very well. A small shake will put forth about 0.6 mm of lead, every time. And of course, the counter-weight does rattle a bit, but far from being annoying.

* **MY THOUGHTS:**

Well, I think the [zero](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechanicalpencils/comments/1m1cbzo/tombow_mono_graph_zero/) may have lost the title of being my favorite MONO graph… Even though I *always* prefer a metal mechpen, the GRIP feels better to use than the zero. That said, keep in mind that the GRIP is mostly plastic. And with that, the pocket clip base and the counter-weight locking system are also plastic. Those parts *theoretically* are more fragile, and suffer more mechanical stress. Therefore, longevity may be an issue.

So, even though the GRIP is a beautiful piece and feels great to use, *maybe* it won’t last very long, especially because of the pocket clip. Honestly, not something I would be too worried about, but still…",8,1766508966.0,mechanicalpencils,3,1.0,False

Look, I get it, I was a mess in my teens, I didn't start looking ok until recently and only this year have I started to actually feel good about myself and gain some confidence, basically everything everyone ever said that I need.



And I still can't even get a date. Someone once told me that it matters the intention I portray, but once I start portraying an intention of wanting something more with someone, that's it, that's the end of it. I don't even get a chance, because that's what a first date is, right? Or a coffee date or whatever else. Like I would get to know someone, we hang out in a group, I act cool, I am myself, I tell jokes, they laugh, they seem to enjoy my presence, I think to myself 'hey, I like this person, let me just...'



""Hey, want to go for a coffee?""



And the answer is always the same. 



I am not blaming the girls, God forbid, I just don't get what's wrong with me that seems to repel every girl around me. 



And listen, when I hang out with a girl friend and they talk abour dating, the first date is always like 'yeah, he's cute and funny, I like him, I am going on a date with him'. They make it look that easy and I don't know what to do, I don't know how else to act but like myself, I don't know how else to carry myself, I don't know what I'm doing wrong. 



And I heard it all. 



'You have to be more assertive' said one of my girl friends. 



With who do you want me to be more assertive, my dear? If I ask and they say 'no', what else do you want me to do? I will be more assertive by making my intentions clear after we go on a date and it goes well. When that happens, yes, I will say loud and clear: 'I really like you and I would love for this to go on', but before that, they don't even like me enough to give me that chance. 



Once a random 30 something guy came over to me a party and started bragging about his so and then told me, out of fucking nowhere, when no one had asked 'you know when it will happen? When you'll be ready for it!' 



And how much readier do you want me to be, my man? For the past few years I've been feeling better and better, sure, life had its ups and downs, but I've been on an ascending trend, I grew a lot and I am feeling good with myself, people are feeling good around me (or so they seem), I seem to have become a better person, now what? Cause it sure as hell doesn't seem to be as hard for other people around me. 



And my absolute favorite that literally makes my hair stand up: 'relax man, I didn't have no one until I was 30 and now I'm happy'. 



Brother, with all due respect, I don't want to be like you. Really, I get the intention of trying to make me feel better and I appreciate it, that's why I am venting here and not to your face, but being like you is my worst fucking nightmare. 



The thought of being alone for another 7 years is... horrifying. It's not even about the sex, it's about the connection, about having someone by your side, about loving someone and feeling loved, about feeling safe enough with someone to talk about the dumbest and most random things, about sharing in the joys and stuff, about someone being genuinely happy to see you, about feeling like you belong to someone, about them choosing you over and over again every single day.



Oh, and please don't come over here telling me that things are not always this nice, it's like telling a starving person that the food sometimes sucks. 



You know what I am most afraid of? That someone will settle for me. That whoever might be will not truly love me, but will choose me for... reasons, I don't know. It's not like I have money or anything, convenience maybe, just saying. They won't be really happy to see me, I will be just there, I won't be enough, idk.



And I am posting here like it can change anything. 



Fuck me, I guess.

​I’m running a Cyberpunk Red campaign and I need some ""corporate evil"" inspiration. I’m planning to have Biotechnica sue my players for 1,000,000 Eb as a way to pressure them, and I’d love your input.
​The Setup:
The players live in an apartment building that was actually built on the foundations of an old, abandoned research facility. Biotechnica desperately needs something that is still buried deep underground beneath the building. To get the tenants out quickly, they started sabotaging the place—specifically, poisoning the water supply with a nasty green slime.
​The Incident:
The players went into the sub-levels to investigate. One of my players handled the situation... less than gracefully. They went full ""caveman"" on the equipment, smashing a proprietary corporate terminal and a security drone to pieces. They managed to trigger the filtration and clear the water, but they didn't do any recon or data-thieving. They destroyed the evidence and left.
​The Delivery:
I’m planning to deliver the lawsuit in a very ""Cyberpunk"" way: I’m going to have the legal papers served to them at their favorite breakfast cafe, right along with their morning coffee. Nothing like a 1M Eddie debt to start the day!
​The Twist & The Goal:
Biotechnica is suing them for ""Gross Destruction of Proprietary Research Equipment."" The Corp doesn't actually expect Edgerunners to have a million eddies; they want to use the legal pressure to force them to vacate the building or force them into a ""suicide mission"" to retrieve whatever is in that old lab. Since the players smashed the terminal, they have no proof that the Corp was the one poisoning the water.
​My questions for you:
​How would you handle a ""Legal Clock"" or pressure to make the players feel the weight of the lawsuit?
​What kind of ""shady deal"" or ""debt-forgiveness mission"" would Biotechnica offer?
​Has anyone run a similar ""legal warfare"" or ""eviction"" plotline? How did your players react to being attacked by lawyers instead of just Solos?
​I'd love to hear your experiences and ideas!
​P.S.: If any of my players happen to recognize themselves in this post... well, hello there! See you next session! :D",11,1766508591.0,cyberpunkred,9,0.93,False
1ptyrd0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1ptyrd0/aio_manipulative_mil_watches_baby_monitor_then/,AIO Manipulative MIL watches baby monitor then calls me racist!,"Let’s hope this one doesn’t get back to her somehow. My partner likes AITAH Reddit posts so he may well see this too. 

Some backstory. Met my partner in June 2021, had our first son in Jan 2024 and our second son June 2025. His mother is from another country (not going to specify as to not give too much away) but she grew up very rural, tribe like environment. She came to the UK at 19 and had two children, her daughter and then her son (my partner) 32 years ago. And has been in the UK for the last 33 years. 

Things were fine when we first got together, his mum is a hoarder so the house way always cluttered, unkempt. It never really made any difference to me as we didn’t go to her place much. My partner lived in a flat elsewhere before he moved in with me so we only went to hers on the odd occasion. 

We had our first Son and she came over to us a couple of times in the first 10 months of his life to see him. She lives an hour away but doesn’t drive and was too scared of public transport. (I say this, although she did get a 20 hour flight with 2 layovers to go back to her home country 2 years ago). 

When he was 10 months old I had to go back to work so MIL said she wanted to support and to do so she would come and stay with us every Monday night and be there for childcare on Tuesdays. When she started doing this, we put the baby monitor app on her phone and I VERY explicitly said that this was only to be used when she was here for nap times. 

A few months later, in the middle of the night, our son was poorly and crying lots. We were both trying to settle and soothe him when my partner gets a text from his mother. ‘Is baby ok, he’s crying so much’. This shocked me, why was she watching the baby monitor to start with. Both his parents were here with him, and we have it covered. I told my partner there and then to message her and tell her to stop watching the monitor. 

Fast forward another few months I’m about 5 months pregnant with our second child, it’s a random Saturday morning, I’m just about to head out for work when his sister texts us. ‘How are you guys doing? How is baby, we were giggling along with him last night on the baby monitor’. Excuse me!! Turns out whilst my partner was putting him to bed and having a giggle/playing with him, that my MiL and SIL were watching along too! 

I was furious, I told my partner to wait for me to get home from work so we could respond to them both together. He in fact, did not do that. So instead, messaged them both and said that I was upset and told them to not do it again. When I got home and he told me what he said, I was even more annoyed. We agreed previously to be a united front, for him to say the upset had come from me alone was unfair and not coming from us as a partnership. 

SIL messaged me and apologised and I was grateful for that. MIL did not. In fact she messaged my partner and said sorry, but nothing to me at all. She was due to come and stay with us on Monday night and this was during my partner working away so it was just the two of us there. I was so angry about the situation, given that she’s been told multiple times not to watch the baby monitor that I made plans to go and see some friends when she came over. She walked in and looked at me and said, oh sorry about the monitor, it was an accident. She claimed that she clicked on the notification and then watched it accidentally when it came up. Now, we all know that’s untrue as she was watching purposefully previously. So her apology seemed incredibly fake to me. 

I told her that it wasn’t true and I knew she’d been watching it several times before and she went quiet. She’d been caught out. Over the next few weeks it was incredibly awkward everytime she would come and stay. We ended up trying to hash it out. I told her how upset I was at this betrayal of privacy, that I could have easily been walking around in nothing and I didn’t want her having an access point into our home. Her response to this was ‘well you could put a camera in my home, I don’t care. I have nothing to hide’. This to me proved that she just didn’t get it or didn’t care about my privacy at all. I knew then that I would never get a reasonable apology. 

A few weeks later we had another conversation with my partner present to lay down the ground rules and finally put it to bed. I felt better, that hopefully after this, she would respect our boundaries a little bit more. 

Time passes, the bond between his mum and I had been a bit frosty but I feel like that’s to be expected after a bit of tension. I told her that during my maternity leave with our second son that she wouldn’t need to come up every Monday night. I will say, hosting her has been quite tedious every week, especially as I got more and more pregnant, making her dinners and running around after her. She’s also a messy person and would leave tissues every where and orange peels. Every week I’d have to do a round up of the house and clear stuff away. So having some time to myself, getting used to our newborn bubble and being a mum of two felt like a good idea. I still made plans with her so she could see her grandchildren. 

When my second was born, we FaceTimed MIL and SIL in the hospital, to my surprise SIL was not interested in meeting him at all. At the time we called they were on the beach, queueing for a coffee somewhere. She said the signal was bad and that MIL was going to find some reception but that she didn’t was to lose her place in the queue. She never called back to meet him at a later date. Days later, I’ve just got home and a bit more settled after my C-section. My partner decides to invite MiL over for 6 hours to see my eldest and meet the baby. I was literally having to host and make her tea whilst she held my newborn. She then spilt her mug everywhere and just sat there whilst I had to get on the floor and clean it up. Thought the whole day was really strange. 

Months passed and SIL still hadn’t met our newborn, I said how strange this was to my partner and he agreed. He messaged her and she said it would be better for them to meet separately. He went over to her place and came home with a big shocker. 

The reason she couldn’t bare to come and meet our newborn was because she was mad at me. And has been for months, ever since I told her mum off for watching our baby monitor. She was that I went in on their mum too much and was clearly out to get her. I wouldn’t have treated her like that unless there was a reason to and because their mum is black, I must be racist. 

I couldn’t believe what I was hearing, for the past 5 months, my MiL and SIL had been bitching about me and calling me racist behind my back, letting it impact them meeting their grandson/nephew. All because I didn’t want my home and my privacy invaded and called out bad behaviour. 

My partner (albeit caught in the middle) wasn’t very good at supporting or defending me to start with, it took him a whole month to realise that what there were saying was incredibly damaging to me and for him to realise that they’ve never treated me very well. They’ve always questioned when we’ve done things (moved in together, had our first miscarriage, our first son and the second!) 

What I am struggling with so much is that they’ve let it go on for so long. It was my MiL who went back to her daughter and said all these awful things about me and how I’ve mistreated her which has let them to bring up race. But for my SIL to willingly believe I would ever do such a thing and not come to me at all to hear my side of things is just hurtful. Neither of them have any respect for me, it’s hurting our family dynamic and my relationship! I don’t take what they said lightly. I do my best to make sure that I stand up for minorities, I support lgbtqia, Black Lives Matter, Palestine, I share information on how to support the causes online, I read and research how to be a stronger ally. All of this and they have the nerve to tell me I’ve been racist. 

The trust has well and truly been broken and I don’t see a way forward. We did all meet to discuss it and they quickly back tracked and said they didn’t think I was a racist anymore but that instead I just had unconscious bias. (Just as bad if you ask me.) I don’t see a way forward and now my relationship with my partner is suffering. I don’t trust my MiL and don’t want them around my children, but I know it’s not just up to me. I just don’t think it’s right for them to disrespect me as their mother and then want access to my children like nothing happened? 

It’s a long read, so thank you for getting this far. Thoughts and opinions welcome. I know I have an emotional stake in all of this so it’s probably going to come off a little one sided but I’ve tried to remain as factual as possible about the events. 

Edit/ I’m just going to add here, I did remove MIL’s access to the monitor after the second occasion when her and SIL were watching together. Just booted her off the app immediately! Hindsight is a wonderful thing, it obviously would have been better to do it after the first incident. She doesn’t use the app any longer and when providing childcare before I went on maternity leave went back to the old fashioned method of just listening out for him and checking in!

 *2:30 AM*

This is it. I’m finally going to do it.

I thought to myself as the words I wanted to say tried to form coherently in my head. I needed to get them out and onto paper before they were lost to the dark recesses of my mind.

I rolled out of bed and dug through my laptop bag until I felt what I was looking for. My journal. Or at this point I should just call it what it really is, a diary. This 8x10, leather bound, secret keeper had been my companion since the beginning of the year. What started out as my notes on “The science of well-being”, the online course through Yale, was slowly, and methodically adapting into a diary of a divorce.





“I need you to know how much I love you.

But I also need to let you know how I’m feeling.

I don’t want to continue down this path we are on.

I don’t want to force you to change or be someone you don’t want to be.

But I can’t keep going on forcing myself to be someone I don’t want to be either.

I’m not ok with our relationship dynamic.

We want different things out of life, and I don’t feel like we have a shared vision of the future.

We’ve been here before and we keep saying things will change, but they don’t.

I feel like we are trying so hard to hold onto something we both know isn’t working.

I love you so much, but if I continue to hold these feelings down I’m afraid I’m going to resent you.

I don’t want to do that.

I want you to be happy.

I want to be happy.

I’m just not sure if that means we are happy together.

Whatever we decide, it’s going to be hard.

But we need to start making those choices soon.

I’ve reached my breaking point.

I’m no longer going to continue down a path I don’t want to walk down.”



I closed the book and rested my hands on top of it as we laid in bed. I asked if she understood what I meant and she nodded her head. The first interaction we had since she walked into the bedroom. Her eyes wet and bloodshot, some from the tears welling up, but mostly from the activities hours before. It was late, and she was not in the right head space to finish this conversation.

She rolled over and went to sleep.

I rolled over and got out of bed.

I didn’t know what to do. So I did something that I used to do, something that could turn my brain off, so I could just be. I wrote.



**The beginning of the end**

*Last week I had the strangest dream*

*Where everything was exactly how it seemed*

*Where there was never any mystery of who shot John F. Kennedy*

*It was just a man with something to prove*

*Slightly bored and severely confused*

*He steadied his rifle with his target in the center*

*And became famous on that day in November*

We think these major shifts in our lives will come with a sign. A significant event, a bright flash, or with a thunderous eruption. When in reality most are slow. Slow accumulations of repeated singular events, that over time, reach their tipping point. It doesn’t fall off the table and crash against the hard wood floor. It’s much slower, as if caught in a location where gravity has less effect. The pull is there but it lingers just a bit longer than it should. We hold on to these moments, second guessing our decisions and thinking maybe, just maybe, if it tips back the other way or we catch it, things will be ok. But we know deep down they won't. Even if it doesn’t tip over this time there will be another. Sometimes we just have to find the courage to let it fall, so we can begin the process of picking up the pieces and moving on. 



Chapter 1



I have no idea what I’m doing, or even what this is. Right now I’m sitting alone in a coffee shop. Drinking my iced dirty chai (decaf) and trying really hard to do something productive instead of reading my book. I’ve picked up a new series to help keep my mind occupied. I feel like it’s better than the alternative. Binging social media or Netflix, which I spent the better portion of the last few weeks doing as well. At least with a book, I feel less like a piece of shit for spending hours staring at it for relatively no benefit. Or maybe I’m just being too hard on myself. Life can be tricky that way. Nothing is ever what it seems at the moment. It’s only looking back that we see or realize our faults or brilliance. So back to where I am right now. This faded and worn faux leather couch. The back rest, non-existent. The table in front of me, far too low to be useful, my laptop quite literally on top of my lap. 

*Stop bitching!*



 The thought just popped into my head. Giving me an amused smile. I hope it did the same for you. If you’re reading this now, chances are you could use one of those, a smile that is.. Unless you read these kinds of things for fun. If that’s the case, I hope you don’t send me any fan letters… 



I suppose I could try and make sense of the whole thing. Maybe go back to the beginning and try to work out what happened? Where did it start? I have my journals, my diaries. I’ve been logging for a while now. There has to be something hidden within those pages right? Maybe if I look through them I could remember and in turn maybe I could help you. We could help each other. These are lonely times my friend. Is it ok if I call you that? My friend? I know we don’t know each other yet, but I feel strangely connected to you. Like somehow I’m right here with you as you read these words in your head. Kinda creepy now that I say it out loud. Sorry for invading your personal space… But at this point you basically invited me in. Don’t you know the first rule about vampires? 



  
Editors note: If you've made it this far, thank you. Right now I'm just getting my thoughts out of my head with no real intention. I've written some more but before I continue on I wanted to see if this was even the right space for it. If I had a catch phrase it would probably be something like ""Idk how to internet"". I'm not a writer, but really enjoy the process. It's helping me deal with the situation at hand. If nothing else I hope it brought a smile to your face :) If enough people find it entertaining/helpful I'll come back and keep everyone updated on the progress. Until then, thank you & I hope you have a wonderful day.

I (F) was in a three year relationship many years ago. The relationship was fine. Stable. We got along fine, our families got along fine... Most of our relationship could be summed up by ""fine.""

  
He is a totally decent person and I care about him very much. We have maintained a friendship since breaking up about ten years ago. Recently, however, he asked me out and I agreed. Almost immediately all of the reasons we broke up came flooding back — my sense of humor is subtle and witty, whereas his is more crass. I don't care about bodily functions, but he lifts his leg to push out farts and laughs like it's the funniest thing in the world. When we go to the movies, he sometimes plays on his phone, he'll smack popcorn with his mouth open, and again, laughs like no one else is around...we have had people get up and move to the other side of the theater because of it. All of this, I could probably manage. I think he's reasonable enough to \*try\* to be slightly more aware.

  
However, he is a complete slob. I believe he probably is ADHD, but more than that, he had a nanny growing up who did everything for him, so he never cared to clean up after himself. When I met him, his house was disgusting — beyond normal bachelor mess. After we had been together for awhile, we decided to move in together, his house made the most sense fir many reasons. I paid cleaners to go in and conduct a massive deep clean twice before I moved in.

  
Now I remember that his habits ultimately led to our breakup. He wouldn't even close the microwave after use — and that was probably the easiest thing to deal with. I have ADHD and OCD, and while I'm not a ""neat freak,"" I do like things to be clean and I am \*very\* triggered by mold. He would make cold brew coffee, then leave it sitting. When I ultimately had to clean it, wet chunks of mold would come out and it would trigger an OCD spiral, which would stress him out.

  
In the ten years since we've been apart, I was in a chaotic relationship and I realize that he has a lot of values that align with mine, but I really don't know if I can get involved with that again.

  
I would love if someone had experiences that might help someone who struggles with cleanliness in this way, or perhaps how to handle the situation? Am I being unfair?  ",2,1766508411.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

I’m using temp 1 and strength 3. 

Part of the issue may be that I typically drink cappuccinos/lattes and I don’t consider myself an espresso drinker, so I may have trouble determining what a “good” shot should taste like.

This morning I finally got the correct ratio (18g beans, \~30 sec pull and 36g output) but the shot still tasted off to me. Is this the machine’s fault or mine?

1ptyhxg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ptyhxg,I did it - Keto Dubai chocolate cake,"I posted last week about trying to compile a Keto recipe for Dubai chocolate cake (based on the Dubai pistachio chocolate bars that usually uses Kataifi shredded pastry) . It was to take to my sisters birthday party. 

Over a couple of days last week (I had to do it in stages to prevent fatigue) I managed to do it & it is was yum. 

So down to the recipe. It’s a long one with a lot of ingredients and a few processes - so it really is for a special occasion. The ingredients are an approximation as I’ve converted from cups (I’m in the UK) : 

# The Sponge : 

30g Country Life Salted Butter (melted & cooled) you could substitute with oil here too 

200g Buy Wholefoods Online Almond Flour (this is the actual brand name)! 

40g The Groovy Food Company Organic Coconut Flour

Capsule Starbucks Decaf Espresso Roast by Nespresso Dark Roast Coffee (For a stronger flavour you could add some instant granules to this cup too) 

½x Teaspoon Bicarbonate of Soda

Teaspoon (5g) Dr. Oetker Baking Powder

40g Naturya Cacao Powder 

20g NKD Living 100% Natural Erythritol

20g NKD Living Stevia 

25g Jo-Lo Monkfruit Sweetener

4x Large (58g) Eggs, Whole, Raw

100g Fage Befree Natural yogurt 

Level teaspoon (5ml) Taylor & Colledge 

Fairtrade Organic Vanilla Bean Extract

100ml Arla Lactofree Cream 

# Pistachio filling 

20g butter 

150g Desiccated Coconut (I used a really good quality called merchant gourmet) 

30g Borna 100% Pistachio Smooth Pistachio Butter 

15g Belazu Authentic Tahini 

35g Groovy Keto White Chocolate Mini Baking Chips 

# Ganache layer :  

Save a little bit of the melted white chocolate and pistachio cream mix (with no coconut) to swirl on the top of the ganache 

100ml Arla Lactofree Cream

113g Groovy Keto Dark Chocolate Baking Chips 

# Decorative Topping 

10g Silver Palm Foods Roasted & Salted Pistachios (I used a different brand that wasn’t salted, but I can’t find it on the Nutra check app so this is a substitute stand in) 

Plus a small mixed amount of white chocolate and pistachio butter for drizzling 

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~ 

I use the different sugar mix to prevent that funny cool aftertaste you get from just using erythritol . This size of cake made about 16 small slices (it’s quite rich so you don’t want a full cake size slice). 

Each slice is 277 cal / 5.2 g of carbs / 8.4 g of protein /24.9 g of fat 

# Method  : 

For the sponge add all the dry ingredients together in a bowl. Whip the eggs and add all the other wet ingredients to that mixture. Then gradually add the wet mixture to the dry. I lined a 10-11” spring form cake tin with circular baking paper cut slits into it so it would sit up upright on sides. Bake in an oven 350F / 175C - for 20-22 minutes (I did a little bit longer like 28 minutes but I think it should’ve been less so that the cake was a bit more fudgy). Remove from oven but leave in cake form and let it cool. 

Whilst the sponge is baking, melt the 20 g of butter in a pan and add the desiccated coconut. Mix and cook until nicely toasted all the way through and a bit dried out. Melt the white chocolate chips I did mine in microwave at 45 seconds spurts about four times, checking between . Then stirring to make sure all the chips have melted and it’s a nice soft mixture. 

Set aside a tablespoon of the melted white chocolate in another bowl and a teaspoon of the pistachio butter (use this to swirl on top of the ganache). Add the cooked desiccated coconut into a large bowl, add the rest of the pistachio butter, tahini & the rest of the melted white chocolate. Mix well. Once the chocolate sponge has cooled, add this mixture in a nice even layer on top of the sponge (whilst still in the cake form). 

For the Ganache layer add the ingredients to a small microwavable bowl. Gradually warm in 45 second bursts - let it sit for 3 to 4 minutes. Mix well. 

Pour this ganache mixture over the coconut pistachio butter mix that’s already on the cake form. Tap lightly to help reduce air bubbles.  Swirl the white chocolate pistachio butter mix on top , sprinkle on the pistachio slivers . Leave to set. I left mine in the fridge and then took it out for a couple of hours before cutting to serve. 

The next day I put a small slice into the microwave for about 20 seconds and it was lush!! ",26,1766507964.0,ketorecipes,4,0.91,False

Too soon to be excited about yet another April Coffee? Probably… but this one is truly special. 

One of my top coffees of the year, and in contention of perhaps being #1, alongside the SL28 from the same farm (unfortunately, not for sale online anymore; only available as an in-store exclusive).

This coffee has great clarity, balance of sweetness and acidity, with good intensity and body.

At hot, it tasted like black currant, dark berries, plum, Granny Smith, with a citrusy black tea finish. 

At warm, sweetness emerged — red currant jam, mixed berries, red apples, with soft purple florals.

At cool, mixed berries/ currant black fruit tea.

Incredible complexity, and absolutely delicious.

My mother has been GF for 4 years now. I'm trying to recreate my mom's favorite family cookie recipe. We made these every year growing up for my entire family. It's a family recipe passed down from my great grandmother. They're a small bite size cookie that are made to be dunked in your coffee or hot drink. It has a taste and chew similar to ginger bread. 

I just finished making my test batch and they're very chalky. It's already a dry and crumbly cookie, but my gf ones can't even be saved with some coffee. I used Bob's 1-to-1 flour and added some extra milk and molasses to the dough to try and get more moisture. So the second test batch, I sprayed a little water on them and let them sit for 30 minutes. I also only baked them for 7 minutes and they're a little better but the texture is still a bit weird. I know with GF, I'm not going to get a perfect replica. Im trying to avoid remaking the recipe, but thought about trying again with a bit more xantham gum.

1ptyd3l,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ptyd3l/aita_for_not_wanting_to_hang_out_with_my_friend/,AITA for not wanting to hang out with my friend now that she’s single again?,"I met a new friend in June and we used to hang out almost weekly during the summer. About 4 months ago, she got back together with an ex who had cheated on her before and from that moment, she totally distanced herself. She stopped talking to me, avoided hanging out, and made no effort. She moved to a new apartment, bought a car and a bike, and I still haven’t seen any of it even though all her other friends apparently have.

She also kept some of my clothes/shoes from summer and after I asked a few times she just told me to come pick them up at her office. That felt cold, especially since we hadn’t seen each other in months. She’s also a bit self-centered, for example, during a trip this summer, I had to leave my luggage at the airport because I was running late to an event. She didn’t even offer to help or grab it for me, which I didn’t feel entitled for her to do, but it would’ve been a kind gesture from a friend since there’s a chance for it to get stolen if left alone.

She was supposed to go with me to a festival and canceled last minute because of her new part-time job, which I understood but instead of saying sorry, she asked me to help her sell her ticket. She didn’t care that I had to now travel alone or reorganize everything we planned together.

Now she recently broke up with the guy, she deactivated Instagram, so I asked her if she was ok and she then sent me a 9 minute voice note venting about how badly he treated her. She also told me i’ve been distant and that for example when she cancelled going to that festival i didn’t ask her how she was doing with her new job instead i just told her “that’s fine”. I also didn’t ask her how she was doing with her new bike (even though i replied to her story saying she looked so cool).

I feel like I was completely ignored while she was in that relationship and now that she’s alone again, she suddenly wants to reconnect and hang out. I feel lowkey guilt-tripped by her but I was only matching the energy/ effort she gave me for months. Now it feels like she wants me back as emotional support.

I’m going to met her for a coffee bc I don’t want to be cruel I know breakups are hard but I also don’t want to feel like a placeholder or free therapist. I feel like this friendship slowly died and now she wants all the benefits again.

What should I do? How do i set boundaries? AITA for not wanting to spend as much time with her anymore?

TL;DR:
Friend ditched me for 4 months while dating her ex and only reached out now that they broke up. She’s sad and wants to reconnect, but I feel used like a placeholder. AITA for not wanting to be close like before?",6,1766507638.0,AITAH,8,0.75,False
1ptycu0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShiaMuslimMarriage/comments/1ptycu0/should_i_try_muzzmatch/,Should I try Muzzmatch?,"So I’m 28F turning 29 soon and I’ve been praying to find my partner really hard lately but I’m not in a position to do anything I’m about it. Firstly, I live in a majority Sunni Muslim country. Second, even though my family is shia shia through and through we don’t have family friends, my family keeps to themselves and we don’t really know anyone, my extended family isn’t an option to ask for help and my friends are all Sunni. The local mosque/hussainiat isn’t socially active as being shia isn’t publicly promoted, like people go to pray and leave. So idk what to do. Plus on top of all of that I feel like being in diaspora and being in the religious minority has made it just hard to find someone to matches me if that makes sense. Like I want to patch up the cultural lost-ness I feel and find someone who can fill in the gap of the diaspora or at least “two diasporas make a whole” kind of thing. I need to take matters into my own hands but I’m so 🤢 by the idea of online dating apps. As much as I have faith that God and the Ahulbayt won’t leave me hanging, I know I need to pray my heart out but still to do my part. Like he won’t come knocking on my door while I’m chillin at home and be like “yo im here 💍”. The ideal situation is like I bump into him in a coffee shop or some sort of rom-com serendipity moment but like the odds of that happening are slim to none and I can’t keep waiting and daydreaming. So idk what to do and I’d love suggestions and/or support pls. Wa shokran. ",4,1766507617.0,ShiaMuslimMarriage,3,1.0,False

1ptyb7f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ptyb7f/help_good_female_friend_got_angry_at_me_ghosted/,"Help! Good female friend got angry at me, ghosted me then deleted me off her socials. Looking for some advice.","This is a burner account and this is my situation. Looking for some advice for ladies and gentleman alike. I apologise ahead of time for the lengthy post and thank you all for your comments/advice.

TLDR: 8 year female friend (platonic) is upset at me and ghosted me/deleted from from socials 3 weeks ago. We talked today and she said she was upset because I was ungrateful and said she felt she was the only one trying in the friendship. I wanted to salvage our friendship but I also feel she has become more emotional/dramatic/negative over time which has caused me to pull back since it gives me a lot of added negativity/stress. Looking for advice.

Background: I'm 46 years old unmarried man. I met this female co-worker of (lets call her Emma aged 48) through work 7-8 years ago at a large bank who is married with kids. We became fast friends and even though we have both left our prior jobs at that bank we stayed good friends often meeting up and even traveling together. She is a wonderful person who is very kind/thoughtful but also can kind be quite dramatic. I on the other hand am a very chill/happy guy who I can admit sometimes isn't the most sensitive given I am more logically wired. The relationship is platonic. 

Emma in the past year maybe due to work stress has become I feel more and more emotional/dramatic. A lot of times recently when we hang out/communicate she is mainly unloading her negativity onto me and getting upset at me. As a good friend I don't think it is ridiculous to be a lending ear but it can feel a bit overwhelming at times.

Recently I landed a great job back at the bank we both used to work at. I know she had been keeping tabs on me and maybe even saying a few good words for me behind the scenes. But I have no transparency on what she may have done.

She was complaining to me on WhatsApp 3 weeks ago she stresses out when people are not grateful. I mentioned to her equating gratitude from others as happiness can be tricky since this is something hard to control. Maybe it would be easier to be happy more often on just wanting to help these individuals inherently. So if they do reciprocate with gratitude then it's a double win on top of the inherent happiness you gain from helping them in the first place.

She went on a trip the next day and then went radio silent for 3 weeks on WhatsApp and even de-friended me from her socials.

Although I know she has mentioned when she is angry/stressed that she 'needs space' I thought it was over the top she would go as far as cutting me from her socials. Especially for a good friend I've know for 8 years. So I messaged her a few times, heard nothing back, found out I was de-friended then wrote a short message back saying I found this out but I wish her nothing but the best as friend.

My thinking is let's take the high road since throwing around names/labels or getting angry has never helped anyone in such a situation. Especially when I have no idea what happened or triggered this.

Fast forward 3 days ago when she randomly messaged me on WhatApp asking me if I would gift her a X'mas card this year. I think this was her way of offering an olive branch to mend the broken friendship since she at least reached out. I replied that I don't think it is appropriate given how she ghosted me for 3 weeks but as a friend of 8 years I feel we should come out and at least talk about what happened.

So today we met up over coffee. A few things happened:

1. She explained she was angry at me before because I was so arrogant/cocky. I was a bit taken back since I've honestly never been called that in my life. I asked why she felt that way and she explained when she was trying so hard to help me with this job I made her feel like I didn't really care about her help. That I acted this new job was only achieved on my own merit. I honestly have no transparency what she may or may not have done behind the scenes but I've always thanked her for the any help I could see or hear about.
2. Then she said I was ungrateful. Again seemed quite harsh to say that. I apologized that I made her feel that way and asked her why she felt I was ungrateful. She said if need to ask then I don't even know what is going on. When I suggested I can be more conscious to offer more gratitude ahead she said she wasn't looking for gratitude. I tried to mend fences but this quickly became a circular discussion going nowhere. I really tried hard to get to know the problem more in hopes of offering a solution but all I got were dismissive responses.
3. Then lastly when I pressed further she said I didn't treasure her, that there is a big gap developed between us this past year and she was exhausted from how the friendship changed where she always seems to be the initiator of communication between us. She felt like she was the only side trying.

My response:

1. A big reason why there is a gap between us I mentioned was there really seems to be an overwhelming amount of negativity (about her work, life etc) when we meet. Furthermore in the past year she gets angry with me like once every 1-2 months. This just compounds a lot more added negative stress to my normal life. Almost at times it makes me feel like a punching bag. I'm a super positive person and although I understand a friend needs to help their friends release some stress, I also want to keep my life as happy as possible. Having said that in the past when faced with the negativity I get from her I do give her the benefit of the doubt by reminding myself Emma is inherently a good person (she is) and maybe she's just going through a rough patch in her work/life.
2. Maybe there are indeed multiple blind spots on my part. As guys sometimes we aren't the best at picking up small signals or the most sensitive. When it comes to gratitude I'm a guy who does take the time to write thank you notes and messages to people who helped me along the way. Having said that my personality when it comes to my own things (not work related or anything requiring a group) is to take care of it myself independently. In the case of a job hunt, although I am grateful for all those who helped me, ultimately it will indeed come down to my own performance on whether I get the job or not.
3. I mentioned that I am already trying quite hard to match her communication needs. NONE of my friends require this level of high touch communicating every single day or every other day. She mentioned that's what good friends do but I replied I think everyone has different needs when it comes to communicating and I don't think lesser of friends who communicate less frequently. That is not a measurement of depth of friendships.

In my simple viewpoint (I could very well be wrong) during this coffee meetup I think she just expected me to accept that I was wrong and be the culprit of all issues. While that may be true, when I mentioned that a friendship is two way street so it always takes 2 to make things work, she seemed quite dismissive of my response. Even the things I mentioned in my response during our coffee meet I felt like she never even once asked why I felt that way or what she could do to make me feel differently.

I mentioned to her that I value her and am trying to meet her halfway to potentially salvage this 8 year friendship but I didn't hear her mention anything she would do beyond the fact that she showed up to this coffee meet so it should already signify she wanted to make up. I just felt that was pretty rude thing to say. The coffee meet ended with me suggesting we take some more space over the Christmas holidays.

To be fair, even though I don't know everything that triggered her or why she sees me as this horrible person, I feel I do need to take responsibility for my actions that may have caused this kind/sweet person to act this way against me. This clearly was not a one off thing but likely some feelings she has been harboring for months given my accidental yet potentially insensitive behavior. So to be clear it's not like I'm trying to hold a myopic view that I am always correct.

Having said that I'm a pretty simple guy. I just want to cultivate relationships that make me happy. On a side note my close uncle recently/suddenly had a brain surgery is now in a vegetative state. This experience just made me value my family even more and really see first hand that life is really short.

I feel so disappointed and confused why this friendship came to this but I agree in hindsight this is likely a growing experience and a moment of self reflection. I know what my gut is telling me but I'd love to hear some responses. Thank you!

1ptyatl,https://www.reddit.com/r/dietScience/comments/1ptyatl/extremes_moderation_and_recognizing_when_to/,"Extremes, Moderation, and Recognizing When to Switch Tools","Moderation has always been my biggest challenge. My default setting is extremism. All-or-nothing. Rip the Band-Aid off. Push hard, finish fast. That approach absolutely has its place - and for most of my life, it’s been the right tool for me.

Right now, it isn’t.

Not because I don’t want to go extreme, but because I literally can’t. My body won’t allow it at the moment. And that’s really the point of this post: every approach is just a tool, and tools that work brilliantly at one stage of your journey can become the wrong tool - or even a harmful one - at another. Sometimes progress isn’t about pushing harder. It’s about changing tools.

So let’s talk about that.

One of the biggest mistakes people make when comparing “moderation” versus “extreme” approaches is treating them as purely objective categories. They aren’t. Yes, you need some objectivity - you can’t ignore physiology or health risks - but subjective experience matters a lot more than people admit.

What feels extreme to one person can feel effortless to another. And what feels “moderate” on paper can be brutally hard in practice, depending on your physiology, history, habits, and current constraints.

Here’s a simple, non-diet example: substances.

If I’m drinking coffee, alcohol, or even something like kava, I’m not sipping for vibes - I’m consuming for effect. I also happen to be an amateur competitive eater, which means I’ve trained both stomach capacity and swallowing mechanics. I can chug a pint in a couple seconds without thinking about it. Combine that with a fast metabolism and quick tolerance buildup, and suddenly “normal” consumption levels don’t register much for me at all.

Objectively, that can look extreme. Subjectively, it often isn’t.

That’s an important distinction. Some behaviors look extreme from the outside but don’t feel extreme internally, and that difference matters when we talk about sustainability, stress, and adherence.

Now let’s move to the more relevant topic: dieting.

I’ve been a true OMAD eater, as in, one actual sitting, not just a time window. This goes back over 25 years, dating back to college. I’m 46 now. For many people, OMAD sounds extreme. For me, it’s just… how I eat. No effort required. It’s not discipline, it’s default.

On top of that, I have over 20 years of experience with prolonged fasting. Three- to seven-day fasts are subjectively normal for me. I’ve done them so many times (guesstimated around 180 times) that they don’t register as a big deal. I’m feast or famine by nature. I love eating until I’m full, and I’m very comfortable not eating at all.

That said, I’m also very clear-eyed about reality: these patterns are not just “challenging” for some people - they’re physiologically or logistically unreasonable for many.

The biggest barrier to OMAD or prolonged fasting isn’t willpower. It’s insulin resistance.

For someone with mild insulin resistance, OMAD might still be doable. But as you move toward prediabetes and beyond, it can become not just miserable but unsafe. That doesn’t mean “moderation” is automatically the answer - it just means you may need a different tool.

This is where very low energy diets (VLEDs), typically around 500 to 800 calories per day, matter. They’re often labeled “extreme,” but they’re also extensively studied and, in some cases, one of the only reliable ways to reverse type 2 diabetes in a defined timeframe - often 12–16 weeks. Compared to six months of vague “eating better” and hoping something changes, VLEDs remove guesswork. They’re decisive. That’s the value.

Now, bringing this back to my current situation.

I’m dealing with an adrenaline issue. As in: my nervous system is stuck in overdrive. I had to go on medication because I’m basically running around like[ Cornholio (he consumes a bunch of sugar and/or caffeine and goes off the rails)](https://youtu.be/Dk57aLMoYGE?si=SVhOU37RkvXbzGTN). Extreme energy sounds cool until your body is wrecked and exhausted at the same time.

[There’s a Futurama episode where Bender produces so much energy he has to party nonstop or he’ll explode (not the best clip but best I found)](https://youtu.be/Vks_1JSGG8s). That’s not far off. I’ll be sitting still and my body just ramps up—muscles tense, sweating kicks in, heart rate climbs. I’ve literally jumped into 60-degree water just to cool down. (Cold therapy helps in general, but that’s not the point.)

The point is this: fasting increases adrenaline, so for me right now, it’s off the table. Ironically, what many people would consider “easier” than moderation, fasting, is the harder option for me at the moment.

Eating three meals a day has been a struggle. Remembering to snack when I get real hunger cues has been a struggle. Caffeine is another problem. I’m down to one cup a day (I used to drink six), and even that’s hard. The adrenaline wrecks sleep, so I wake up exhausted, which makes me want more caffeine, which makes everything worse.

For the past two months, this has been one of the hardest diet phases of my life. Not seven-day fasts. Not dropping 50 pounds in two months. Learning how to moderate.

And the only reason I’m succeeding at it at all is because it became non-negotiable. My body forced the issue.

What I’ve taken away from all of this:

* Everyone struggles and not with the same things. What feels extreme or impossible for one person can feel automatic to another.
* Difficulty isn’t a character flaw. It’s a mix of physiology, experience, habits, logistics, and current life constraints.
* If what you’re doing is consistently moving you backward, the problem usually isn’t effort or discipline - it’s that you’re using the wrong tool.
* No one deserves to be shamed for trying to figure this out. But we do owe ourselves honesty about whether we need more structure right now, or less intensity.

There is no universal best approach. There are only tools. And the awareness to know when the one that used to work no longer does.

Sometimes progress means pushing harder.

Sometimes it means backing off.

And sometimes the hardest adjustment of all is learning how to stop doing what used to work.

1pty9vq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1pty9vq/aita_for_not_wanting_to_spend_time_with_my_friend/,AITA for not wanting to spend time with my friend now that she’s single again?,"I met a new friend in June and we used to hang out almost weekly during the summer. About 4 months ago, she got back together with an ex who had cheated on her before and from that moment, she totally distanced herself. She stopped talking to me, avoided hanging out, and made no effort. She moved to a new apartment, bought a car and a bike, and I still haven’t seen any of it even though all her other friends apparently have.

She also kept some of my clothes/shoes from summer and after I asked a few times she just told me to come pick them up at her office. That felt cold, especially since we hadn’t seen each other in months. She’s also a bit self-centered, for example, during a trip this summer, I had to leave my luggage at the airport because I was running late to an event. She didn’t even offer to help or grab it for me, which I didn’t feel entitled for her to do, but it would’ve been a kind gesture from a friend since there’s a chance for it to get stolen if left alone.

She was supposed to go with me to a festival and canceled last minute because of her new part-time job, which I understood but instead of saying sorry, she asked me to help her sell her ticket. She didn’t care that I had to now travel alone or reorganize everything we planned together.

Now she recently broke up with the guy, she deactivated Instagram, so I asked her if she was ok and she then sent me a 9 minute voice note venting about how badly he treated her. She also told me i’ve been distant and that for example when she cancelled going to that festival i didn’t ask her how she was doing with her new job instead i just told her “that’s fine”. I also didn’t ask her how she was doing with her new bike (even though i replied to her story saying she looked so cool).

I feel like I was completely ignored while she was in that relationship and now that she’s alone again, she suddenly wants to reconnect and hang out. I feel lowkey guilt-tripped by her but I was only matching the energy/ effort she gave me for months. Now it feels like she wants me back as emotional support.

I’m going to met her for a coffee bc I don’t want to be cruel I know breakups are hard but I also don’t want to feel like a placeholder or free therapist. I feel like this friendship slowly died and now she wants all the benefits again.

What should I do? How do i Set boundaries? AITA for not wanting to spend much time with her anymore?

TL;DR:
Friend ditched me for 4 months while dating her ex and only reached out now that they broke up. She’s sad and wants to reconnect, but I feel used like a placeholder. AITA for not wanting to be close like before?",9,1766507419.0,AmItheAsshole,13,1.0,False

At this time of year, when cycles close and new ones open, it's a good moment to reflect on the energy that keeps complex systems alive. I've been reminded recently that generosity is a form of positive feedback, essential for any project to evolve and maintain its dissipative structure far from static equilibrium.

Throughout this year, I've devoted my efforts to deepening the **fractal-holographic model** (or holofractal model) and to rigorously applying the **holofractic method** to weave bridges between science, art, and philosophy. As you know, whether under my artistic signature of Alejandro Troyán or in my researcher capacity (Juan José López Ruiz), the goal is always the same: to find that underlying unity in diversity, that **holofractal methodology** that allows us to see the whole in the part.

Creating content, researching, and developing this vision requires a constant investment of time and vital energy. That's why, if my work has resonated with you, made you think, or simply offered you a new perspective on reality, I invite you to support the continuity of this project.

The *Buy Me a Coffee* platform reminds us that visible support is fundamental. It's not just a donation; it's an exchange of energy that validates the path and allows us to continue exploring the boundaries of aesthetics and knowledge.

If you wish to contribute to keeping this vision expanding, you can buy me a coffee here:

☕ [BUY ME A COFFE](http://buymeacoffee.com/holofractig)

Thank you for being part of this system, for your resonance, and for allowing the vision to continue growing. The beauty of giving and receiving is, in itself, a holofractal dynamic.

Happy holidays, and may the next cycle bring coherence and creativity!",2,1766506894.0,holofractico,0,1.0,False

If I make 5 shots with reasonable adjustments and nothing is working I stop blaming my technique and start blaming the beans.

Not every bag works. Some beans just don't cooperate with your machine, your water, your grinder, whatever. And no amount of micro-adjusting will fix a bean that just isn't your thing.

Before I learned this, I'd burn through half a bag trying to ""figure it out."" Adjusting grind, adjusting temp, changing dose, starting over. Hours of frustration trying to make it work.

Now I do 5 attempts, still bad? I move on. Try a different coffee. Come back to that bag later with fresh senses, or don't.
