Unspoken griefs,

And the long corridors of solitude that no one else could see. 

Every ache you carried,

Every late-night whisper,

To no one in particular — they became the scaffolding of your strength,

The quiet proof that you were still choosing life,

Even when it barely chose you back.

You’ve come far.

Not in showy miles or loud achievements, 

But in the way your eyes learned to hold depth without drowning.

You’ve built tenderness from rubble, 

Stitched laughter into places once torn by sorrow,

And planted hope in soil you thought was barren.

The ghosts of self-doubt may still hover at times — familiar, persistent — but now, 

You meet them not with fear,

But with wisdom.

You have outgrown the need to explain your healing.

It pulses quietly in how you hold space for others.

In how you sit with your own feelings.

In how you no longer apologize for needing rest, softness, or truth.

You did not arrive here by accident.

You earned every fragment of peace now budding in your life.

You fought for your joy.

You negotiated with despair and walked away whole.

And maybe you’re still learning — still messy,

Still mending — but there’s grace in that too.

There is no finish line for souls like yours. 

Only gentle chapters written in moonlight and cat whiskers and coffee steam and quiet victories.

And maybe today, this letter is one of them.

I see you.

You are not just surviving,

You are becoming.",1,1754907166.0,creativewriting,0,1.0,False

1mn90ax,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1mn90ax/39m_balancing_hopes_with_realistic_expectations/,39M Balancing hopes with realistic expectations for dating F35,"8 months out of a two-year relationship. Truthfully, the heartbreak didn’t hit until April when I tried to reconcile and found out my ex had already moved on in February. It was my first big heartbreak, and I went through the full spectrum: longing, regret, jealousy, resentment.

Since then, I’ve been actively working on myself like moved to a new city, joined social groups, owned my mistakes in the relationship, started therapy, and worked with a breakup coach. I’ve only recently started dating again.

A month ago, I met a woman, probably mid-30s who owns a plant shop near me. The first time I went in, I asked her out (something I never do). She had a boyfriend but said she would have said yes otherwise, and even complimented me for being direct.

Two weeks later, I stopped in and she mentioned she and her boyfriend had broken up that weekend. She said it was mutual, a relief, not working for a while. I didn’t ask her out then, but popped in a couple more times for small purchases and light banter.

This past week, I went in intending to ask her out. She said yes, but sinceshe’s fresh out of a breakup and in a “weird headspace,” so she’d like to wait a few weeks. She asked me to check back in later. I’ll be in Europe for three weeks, so it will be about four weeks before I see her again.

I’ve only been on a couple dates since my breakup, I’m still craving connection, and my brain wants to make her “the one” before we’ve even had coffee. My rational side knows she’s fresh out of something, I barely know her, and the odds are small. But emotionally, I’m already getting hopeful.

How do I stay grounded and open-minded without loading this up with fantasy and pressure before it’s even started?

TL;DR: 39M, 8 months post-breakup, just started dating again. Met a local “plant store girl,” asked her out once (she had a BF), she broke up, asked her out again and she said yes… but wants to wait a few weeks due to fresh breakup. I’m already getting hopeful and imagining the future. How do I keep expectations realistic and not turn this into a romcom in my head before our first date?",1,1754906966.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

1mn8ydi,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedAtHome/comments/1mn8ydi/why_choose_the_chefman_digital_air_fryer_rj382/,Why Choose the Chefman Digital Air Fryer RJ38-2 for Crispy Perfection?,"The Chefman RJ38-2 air fryer is something I’ve been using on and off in my kitchen for a while now, and it has quickly integrated itself into my meal prep routine. As someone who loves the crunch of fried foods but hates the mess and guilt that can come with deep-frying, I found this product intriguing right from the start. A 5-quart capacity air fryer with features like a temperature probe, customizable cooking presets, and a built-in “Hi-Fry” option to deliver that extra crispy finish, it feels like a handy little addition to any modern kitchen. That said, there are upsides and a few quirks to consider if you’re eyeing it as your next countertop companion.

**Smart Design and Compact Size**  
The first thing that struck me about this air fryer was its sleek, black-on-black design. It doesn’t scream for attention but instead blends into most kitchen setups, fitting right amid my other appliances. Despite the hefty 5-quart capacity, the product manages to take up minimal counter space with its thoughtfully square-shaped basket design. It fits snugly by my coffee maker and doesn’t hog the prime real estate of my limited kitchen space—a crucial issue for apartment dwellers or dorm rooms. The easy-view window is a simple feature, but honestly, it’s a game-changer for keeping an eye on the crisping process without opening the basket and losing heat. As an extra bonus, the nonstick coating and dishwasher-safe basket make cleanup a breeze, which is always a win in my book.  

**Probe Technology and Preset Options**  
One of the real highlights of this appliance is its integrated probe thermometer. Cooking chicken to the right temperature—without tossing it back into the fryer three times—is basically a miracle in my home. The Chefman RJ38-2’s probe technology effortlessly monitors and shows real-time updates on the digital screen. You can even customize the doneness for meats, fish, or poultry. I’ll admit I was skeptical at first (gimmicky much?), but it’s now a key feature I use for family dinners, cutting down the guesswork for meals like roasted salmon or a medium-rare steak. For anyone juggling around in the kitchen, this simplifies multitasking.  

[Time to see Chefman RJ38-2 cost on Amazon.](https://ultrasonicstore.com/p/b0b7c28kpt/)  

**Temperature and Crispy Finish**  
With temperatures ranging from 200°F to a searing 450°F, this little powerhouse has been surprisingly versatile for everything from reheating leftover pizza to baking cookies straight from the freezer. Oh, and that “Hi-Fry” button? It’s a sneaky way to make mozzarella sticks that extra crunchy, sans the guilt of deep-frying. The automatic shake reminder might seem unnecessary, but it honestly rescued my French fries from burning more times than I care to admit. Plus, the auto shutoff ensures I never over-steam my Brussels sprouts or dry out my popcorn.  

**Upsides**  
- Clever design saves valuable countertop space.  
- Probe thermometer makes meats effortless to cook.  
- Dishwasher-safe components simplify cleanup.  
- Versatile cooking range up to 450°F for crispy results.  
 
**Areas for Improvement**  
- A bit slower for large-batch cooking compared to ovens.  
- Plastic exterior feels less high-end.  
- Output wattage could use more oomph for super-fast frying.  

**Alternative Products on the Market**  
It’s impossible not to look at other players in the air fryer game. For instance, Ninja’s air fryer has a more robust and premium design but trades its ease of portability for a heftier size. While the Ninja includes extra baking racks, its lack of a temperature probe makes the Chefman RJ38-2 stand out for meat lovers like me. Philips air fryers often offer slightly more compact designs but don’t quite offer the wide temperature range found here. For families or individuals who prioritize space and customization, the Chefman carves a pretty specific niche for itself.  

**Price Performance**  
Finding the right balance between cost and features can be a dance, but the Chefman RJ38-2 offers a wide array of user-friendly options without venturing into premium pricing territory. You’re getting a dishwashing-safe, user-friendly air fryer that feels like it’s priced just right for entry-level to intermediate users. Plus, those 8 customizable presets? It feels like a small investment for maximum versatility.

1. Cannot connect to XBLOOM after another user used the machine. It can only be connected to one phone at a time. Logically, a person walks away after brewing his cup of coffee. No one would deliberately kill the app or manually disconnect inside the app. The next person would have to shout out in the office: ""WHO THE F DIDN'T KILL THE APP? I CANNOT MAKE MY COFFEE!"". Or reach out to the socket to unplug and plug to reboot the XBLOOM. There are no restart or disconnect switches. SUPER DUMB design.
2. Placed the filter basket on the dripper while it is on the right hand side? (Brewing side). Good Luck! Press the grind button and your favorite beans get ground onto everywhere. The basket WON'T move to the grinder side by itself. Unless you use the app and select ""grind"" in your brewing plan. I would at least expect a prompt to ask if I want to grind without basket.

They never had any physical/mental problems or illnesses, they are doing pretty great for their age, but you know, as we getting older it won't be getting any easier. I wouldn't say they're ""losing it"", but something's going on. They have definitely started acting weird which makes me feel very uncomfortable. I don't know how to navigate this, whether I should just look past it cuz they're getting old and I shouldn't take anything they say at face value, or whether this is genuinely how they feel about us. We always had an excellent relationship, they raised us, we all lived together, we were always very close as a family. I dont know what's happened now...

My grandpa enters every room nearly outraged every time. Provocative ironic tone, ready to make a comment that will strike a nerve, trigger and get a reaction out of us. Maybe they don't talk enough with grandma and are trying to find sources of entertainment to pass their time, honestly I dont know. We could be busy drowning with work and he'll start talking about things to provoke my dad like how he feels his sons are a failure, argumentative tone over inheritance stuff, money, very fake performative interest as in ""i bring y'all coffee every morning"" and will say it out so loud to boast and prove a point that he cares. The stuff he says though, is so specific and so well-pointed to get to you, that it can't be him talking nonsense. He doesnt have Alzheimer's or dementia. Is it true that with age they just show how they really feel about you and blame it on ""old age""?

Grandma same thing, even though she has started talking nonsense lately and having those pauses, blank stares at the wall and flashbacks repeating the same things ... but it's not extreme, she is able to snap back to normal. Yet she makes such oddly specific ""mildly"" infuriating comments about my parents, me, life situation, character, that just ""slips"" and reveals how she really views us and feels about us... I don't know if it's just me overthinking it, maybe i shouldnt even look that much into it but it's such strange behavior... They were never like this... They throw hints, imply stuff, laugh in irony, almost like we aren't family... I feel so strange and uncomfortable being around them... I dont know whether they're tired of us and want us gone or what their issue is... It feels like piled up resentment that only starts to show now...

I don't want to be a piece of shit and respond to them in an ugly way, they are my family and it breaks my heart that our relations are becoming more troubled as they grow older. But I can't tolerate receiving phone calls to be told off or coming to my workplace to see me and argue with me or saying stuff to trigger me to get their daily dose of entertainment and then leave... Im trying to be empathetic and understanding, I don't want to have guilty conscience that I was mistreating/ignoring them when they got old, but this whole feeling of alienation is truly messing me up... Interacting with them ruins my day. Im very attached to my family and things like this affect me deeply... But I don't know what to do. Any insights?",1,1754906724.0,Aging,0,1.0,False

Webnovel just dropped something new and I’m already imagining the plot twists — link me in,"Miranda Holden exhaled with relief as the town car pulled away from the curb. The tension in her shoulders finally began to ease now that she was free from Nolan Shelton's intimidating presence. Their business trip had been a special kind of torture—her normally demanding boss had been particularly insufferable, his mood darker than usual, his demands more exacting.



Thank God they'd wrapped up early. One more day of Nolan's brooding intensity and she might have snapped.



She glanced at her watch as she gathered her luggage. Ryan wouldn't be expecting her home until tomorrow. A small smile played on her lips as she imagined surprising him with a romantic dinner. It had been a while since they'd been together, and she missed him terribly.



Juggling her briefcase, handbag, and suitcase, Miranda fumbled for her keys. The lock turned smoothly as she pushed open the door to the townhouse she shared with Ryan and her cousin Suzanne. The house was quiet—not surprising since Suzanne was rarely home during daylight hours. The model kept hours that would exhaust most people, partying until dawn and sleeping well past noon.



Miranda set her handbag and suitcase by the stairs, then placed her briefcase on the desk in the living room. Her mind already cycling through dinner possibilities as she moved toward the kitchen.



A sound from upstairs stopped her mid-step.



Miranda froze, her heart suddenly hammering against her ribs. Had someone broken in? The neighborhood was safe, but not immune to crime. She glanced toward the front door, considering retreat, when another sound—distinctly human—filtered down the stairs.



Relief washed over her. Suzanne must be home for once. Her cousin's schedule was unpredictable at best; she often stumbled in at dawn, sometimes still in last night's clothes.



Then Miranda heard something that made her blood run cold—a man's groan, followed by her cousin's unmistakable giggle.



""Please be Suzanne with some random guy,"" Miranda whispered to herself, spotting her father's old baseball bat near the door. ""Please don't be what I think it is.""



She grabbed the bat, her palms sweaty against the worn grip. Each step up the carpeted stairs felt like an eternity, her heartbeat drumming in her ears. At the landing, she paused, listening.



The sounds were coming from the master bedroom—her and Ryan's bedroom. The door was partially open, spilling a slice of afternoon light into the hallway.



""God, you're amazing,"" a male voice groaned.



Miranda's stomach dropped. She knew that voice. The same voice that had whispered promises of forever. The same voice that had told her recently how much he'd miss her while she was away.



""Is my pussy better than Miranda's?"" Suzanne's breathy question floated through the doorway.



Miranda's knees nearly buckled. She gripped the bat tighter, using it for support as much as protection now. This couldn't be happening. Not Ryan. Not Suzanne. Not her cousin who knew intimately the devastation infidelity caused, having watched her own mother suffer through her father's numerous affairs.



Steadying herself, Miranda nudged the door open wider.



The sight that greeted her burned into her memory: Ryan sprawled on his back on their bed—the bed she'd saved for months to buy—with Suzanne straddling him, her head thrown back in ecstasy, her perfect model's body glistening with sweat as she rode him.



Ryan's hands gripped Suzanne's hips, guiding her movements with an intimacy that suggested this was far from their first encounter.



Miranda felt nauseous. She'd given Ryan everything—her virginity, her trust, her future plans. She'd believed him when he said he couldn't stand Suzanne, when he criticized her cousin's lifestyle and clothing choices. Had that all been a cover? Or worse, had it been jealousy of other men in Suzanne's life?



The rational part of Miranda's brain told her to leave, to process this betrayal somewhere safe. But a deeper, stronger part refused to slink away in shame for a crime she hadn't committed.



Drawing herself up to her full height, Miranda stepped into the doorway. The baseball bat hung loosely at her side as she watched the two people she trusted most betray her in the most intimate way possible.



Neither of them noticed her presence, too lost in their pleasure. Something cold and hard crystallized in Miranda's chest, replacing the initial shock with icy clarity.



""While you two finish up,"" she said, her voice unnervingly calm, ""should I cook dinner?""

...

The look of horror that crossed Ryan's face might have been comical under different circumstances. He froze mid-thrust, his eyes widening as they locked with Miranda's. Suzanne scrambled off him with a shriek, frantically grabbing at the sheets to cover her nakedness.



""Miranda! Jesus Christ!"" Ryan's face drained of color. ""You're supposed to be in Chicago until tomorrow!""



Miranda leaned against the doorframe, the baseball bat tapping gently against her leg. ""Clearly,"" she said, her voice eerily controlled despite the hurricane raging inside her. ""I should have called ahead.""



Suzanne clutched the sheet to her chest, mascara-streaked tears already forming in her eyes. ""Miranda, I can explain—""



""Can you?"" Miranda's gaze shifted to her cousin. ""Can you explain why you're fucking my fiancé in our bed? I'm genuinely curious about what explanation could possibly make this okay.""



Ryan scrambled into his boxers, nearly falling as he stumbled off the bed. ""Baby, this isn't—it's not what you think—""



""Really?"" Miranda's eyebrow arched. ""Because I think I just caught my fiancé having sex with my cousin. What part am I misunderstanding?""



Suzanne sobbed, the tears ruining her perfect makeup. ""It just happened! We didn't mean to hurt you!""



Miranda laughed, a hollow sound devoid of humor. ""It just happened? Multiple times, apparently, since Suzanne seems familiar enough with my sex life to make comparisons."" She gestured between them with the bat. ""How long has this been going on?""



Ryan approached her cautiously, hands raised as if calming a wild animal. ""Miranda, please put down the bat. We need to talk about this rationally.""



""I'm being perfectly rational,"" Miranda replied, though she set the bat against the wall. ""I'm simply asking how long you've been cheating on me with my cousin.""



The silence that followed was damning.



""Two months,"" Suzanne finally whispered. ""Since he moved in.""



Two months. So, the entire time he'd been living here, they'd been betraying her. ""So while I was working overtime to pay for our wedding, you two were what—christening every room in the house?""



Ryan reached for her. ""Miranda, I love you. This was a mistake—""



Miranda stepped back, avoiding his touch. ""Don't. Just don't."" She surveyed the room—their room—seeing it now as tainted beyond repair. ""You know what's funny? You always said you couldn't stand Suzanne. Called her shallow, slutty, attention-seeking."" She looked at her cousin. ""Did you know that?""



Suzanne's face crumpled. ""He didn't mean it—""



""Oh, I think he did,"" Miranda interrupted. ""Just like he meant it when he proposed to me. Just like he meant it when he said he wanted to build a life with me."" She pulled the diamond engagement ring from her finger and tossed it onto the bed. ""I hope you're both very happy together.""



Ryan lunged forward, grabbing her wrist. ""Don't do this. We can work through this. It was just sex—it didn't mean anything!""



Miranda yanked her arm free. ""That's supposed to make me feel better? That you risked our entire future for meaningless sex?"" She shook her head. ""I don't know which is worse—that you betrayed me, or that you're stupid enough to think I'd stay after this.""



""Where will you go?"" Suzanne asked, a hint of concern in her voice that Miranda found almost offensive.



""Don't worry about me."" Miranda straightened her shoulders. ""I'll have my things out by the weekend. Until then, I suggest you both find somewhere else to stay."" She turned to leave, then paused. ""Oh, and Suzanne? You might want to get tested. I doubt I'm the only one he's been lying to.""



She walked out, leaving them in shocked silence. The tears would come later, she knew. The grief, the rage, the devastating sense of loss. But for now, as she descended the stairs on surprisingly steady legs, Miranda felt only a cold, clear certainty.



It was over. And somehow, despite the pain piercing her heart, she would survive this.



Her phone buzzed in her pocket—a text from Nolan Shelton, no doubt with some new demand that couldn't wait until morning. For once, Miranda welcomed the distraction. Work was the one thing she could control, the one place where she knew her value.



Grabbing her briefcase, she headed for the door. She had no idea where she was going, but anywhere was better than here.

...

The taxi pulled up to the gleaming glass tower of Shelton Industries, its reflective surface a flat, steely gray under the overcast sky. Miranda Holden stepped out, eyes hidden behind oversized sunglasses despite the overcast day. Her heart felt like shattered glass in her chest, each breath pushing the shards deeper.



""Keep the change,"" she murmured, handing the driver a twenty.



She hadn't planned to come to the office. Home wasn't an option—not that house, not anymore—and the thought of sitting alone in some hotel room made her chest constrict painfully. Work had always been her sanctuary. Even on weekends. Even after a red-eye flight from Chicago.



Even after finding her fiancé buried inside her cousin.



Her phone buzzed again—the fifteenth call from Ryan in thirty minutes. Miranda silenced it without looking and pushed through the revolving doors.



Lacey, the lobby receptionist, looked up with her usual smile, which quickly faded when she took in Miranda's appearance.



""Ms. Holden? I thought you were in Chicago until tomorrow.""



""Change of plans."" Miranda set her carry-on and briefcase beside the security desk. ""Could you watch these for me? I'll collect them later.""



Lacey's eyes flickered back to Miranda's face. To her credit, she simply nodded. ""Of course.""



In the elevator, Miranda removed her sunglasses, wincing at her reflection in the polished doors. Her eyes were red-rimmed, mascara smudged despite her best efforts in the airport bathroom. She looked exactly like what she was—a woman whose life had just imploded.



The executive floor was quiet when she arrived. Saturday afternoons at Shelton Industries were typically deserted—one of the reasons she'd chosen to come here.



Clara, the floor's receptionist, glanced up from her computer. ""Miranda! I didn't expect to see you today.""



""Just catching up on some work."" Miranda attempted a smile that felt like cracking glass. ""Is Mr. Shelton in?""



""No, he had meetings downtown all morning. I don't expect him back today.""



Perfect. Miranda nodded and made her way to her office, directly adjacent to Nolan Shelton's corner suite. As his executive secretary, she maintained the barrier between him and the rest of the world—a position that required efficiency, discretion, and an immunity to intimidation. Nolan Shelton was brilliant, demanding, and known for his cutting remarks and impossible standards.



He was also, at this moment, blessedly absent.



Miranda dropped her purse on her desk, then stood still, suddenly directionless. The thought of sitting in her sterile office made her throat constrict. What was she supposed to do now? Organize files? Answer emails? Pretend the foundation of her personal life hadn't just disintegrated?



Without conscious decision, she found herself opening the door to Nolan's office.



The vast corner suite smelled of leather and sandalwood, with floor-to-ceiling windows offering a panoramic view of the city. Miranda had been in this space hundreds of times—taking notes, delivering reports, arranging his schedule—but never without purpose, and never alone.



She moved to the bar cart tucked discreetly in the corner. Nolan Shelton kept an impressive selection of liquor, primarily for entertaining clients. His personal preference was a thirty-year-old scotch that cost more than Miranda's monthly rent.



She didn't hesitate. She grabbed the crystal decanter and a tumbler, carried them to the leather sofa that faced the cityscape, and poured herself a generous three fingers.



The scotch burned like liquid fire going down, but the second swallow was smoother. By the third, a pleasant numbness began spreading through her limbs.



Miranda kicked off her heels and tucked her legs beneath her on the sofa. Another drink. Then another. The skyline blurred as tears filled her eyes again.



""So many years,"" she whispered to the empty room. ""So many fucking years.""



She and Ryan had met in college—her serious to his charming, her driven to his easygoing. He'd pursued her relentlessly until she gave in. For years, she'd believed they balanced each other perfectly.



What a fool she'd been.



Her phone buzzed again. Ryan. She silenced it and took another burning swallow.



Suzanne. Her own cousin. The girl who'd been the spoiled princess while Miranda and her sisters scraped by after their parents' deaths. Uncle March and Aunt Gra had taken them in, but the message had always been clear—the Holden sisters were charity cases, expected to earn their keep while Suzanne was showered with everything she wanted.



And apparently, what Suzanne wanted was Ryan.



The phone on Nolan's desk rang, startling Miranda from her bitter thoughts. She ignored it, but after six rings, some professional instinct made her rise unsteadily to her feet.



""Shelton Industries,"" she answered, her voice surprisingly steady despite the alcohol swimming through her system.



""Nolan?"" The female voice was breathy, almost whiny. ""I've been trying your cell.""



Miranda's jaw tightened. Luna Malcolm. She'd seen the woman's name in Nolan's calendar often enough to know she was his current mistress. Under normal circumstances, Miranda would have politely taken a message.



These were not normal circumstances.



""He's not available,"" Miranda said, leaning heavily against the desk. ""And he won't be returning your calls.""



""Excuse me?"" Luna's voice rose an octave. ""Who is this?""



""Someone doing you a favor."" The scotch had loosened Miranda's tongue dangerously. ""He's done with you. Moving on. Find someone else to warm your bed.""



""How dare you—""



""I'll tell him you called,"" Miranda cut in sweetly, then hung up.



She stumbled back to the sofa, laughing mirthlessly. At least she wasn't the only woman being discarded this weekend. Nolan Shelton went through women like other men went through socks. The difference was, his women knew the score from the beginning. No pretense of forever. No fake promises of fidelity.



Maybe that was smarter than what she'd done—believing in love, in commitment, in building a life together. Maybe men like Ryan and Nolan were all the same underneath; Nolan was just honest about it.



The decanter was half-empty now, and Miranda's thoughts had turned hazier, darker. She thought of her sister Collins—brilliant, beautiful Collins—visibly pregnant and abandoned by the baby's father. Another man who'd made promises he never intended to keep.



Connor De Romano. Just the name made Miranda's blood boil. The tech billionaire had left Collins broken, though her sister never spoke about exactly what happened between them.



Miranda would call Collins tomorrow. And Noelle, her fiery younger sister, currently working overseas. They were her real family. They would help her pick up the pieces, find a new place to live. They would understand the betrayal in a way no one else could.



""Having fun?""



The deep voice from the doorway froze Miranda mid-swallow. She lowered the tumbler slowly, meeting Nolan Shelton's stormy gray eyes across the room.



He stood motionless, his tall frame silhouetted against the doorway, expression unreadable. His dark hair was slightly disheveled, as if he'd been running his fingers through it—the only crack in his usually impeccable appearance.



Miranda knew she should stand, should apologize, should feel mortified. Instead, she raised her glass in a mocking toast.



""Absolutely,"" she replied, her voice husky from the alcohol. ""Your scotch is excellent. Almost worth what you paid for it.""



Nolan's eyes narrowed as he stalked toward her, movements predatory and controlled. Without a word, he plucked the glass from her fingers and set it on the coffee table, then took the decanter and returned it to the bar cart.



""You're drunk,"" he stated flatly, turning back to face her.



""Astute observation."" Miranda knew she was committing career suicide, but couldn't seem to stop herself. ""That's why they pay you the big bucks.""



A muscle twitched in Nolan's jaw. In her several years working for him, Miranda had never spoken to him with anything less than perfect professional respect. Even when he was at his most demanding, most unreasonable, she'd maintained her composure.



That composure had shattered along with her heart.



""You're an asshole, you know that?"" The words tumbled out before she could stop them. ""A rich, entitled asshole who thinks the world exists to serve him.""



She expected anger. Expected to be fired on the spot. Instead, Nolan studied her face for a long, uncomfortable moment.



Then, inexplicably, he lowered himself onto the sofa beside her.



""Tell me what happened,"" he said quietly.



The unexpected gentleness in his voice undid her more effectively than any reprimand. Miranda felt tears welling up again and turned her face away, determined not to cry in front of her boss—one humiliation too many for such a short time.



""Nothing worth discussing,"" she managed.



""Miranda."" Her name on his lips was different somehow—softer than she'd ever heard it. ""Look at me.""



Reluctantly, she turned to face him. In the fading afternoon light, his gray eyes seemed darker, intense in a way that made her breath catch. He was close enough that she could smell his cologne—something expensive and masculine that made her head swim more than the scotch.



""Tell me,"" he repeated, ""who hurt you.""



And Miranda, who prided herself on her control, felt the last of her defenses crumble beneath the weight of his unexpected concern.

...

The office was too quiet. Too empty. The alcohol coursing through Miranda's veins made everything slightly blurry around the edges, but her rage remained crystal clear.



""I'm sorry for calling you an ass,"" Miranda announced to Nolan, her voice echoing in the expansive office. ""Even though you sometimes are."" She couldn't help adding the last part, her filter completely dissolved by the expensive scotch.



Nolan leaned against his desk, his expression unreadable as he studied her. The intensity of his gray eyes made her skin prickle with awareness.



""Apology accepted,"" he replied, his voice a low rumble that seemed to vibrate through her chest. ""Though I'm not sure how sincere it was.""



Miranda waved her hand dismissively, nearly losing her balance in the process. ""Did you ever cheat on your ex-wife?"" The question escaped her lips before she could stop it.



Something flickered across Nolan's face—a flash of pain quickly masked.



""No,"" he answered after a moment. ""Rosalyn was the one who cheated. Multiple times.""



Miranda blinked, surprised by his honesty. ""Oh.""



""Oh?"" Nolan raised an eyebrow.



""I just... I didn't expect that. You seem like the type who would have women throwing themselves at you."" Her cheeks heated as she realized what she'd said.



Nolan's mouth curved into a humorless smile. ""They did. I didn't reciprocate.""



""Why not?"" Miranda asked, genuinely curious now.



""Because I believed in my marriage vows,"" he said simply. ""Even when Rosalyn clearly didn't.""



Miranda nodded slowly, feeling an unexpected kinship with this man she'd always found so intimidating. They'd both been betrayed by people they trusted.



Nolan moved closer, his scent—expensive cologne mingled with something uniquely him—making her dizzy in a way that had nothing to do with alcohol.



""Do you want to talk about what happened with Ryan?"" he asked, his voice gentler than she'd ever heard it.



Miranda laughed bitterly. ""What's there to say? Found my fiancé fucking my cousin in our bed. End of story.""



""And how do you feel about that?"" Nolan pressed, watching her carefully.



""Angry,"" she answered immediately. ""More angry than heartbroken, which is strange, isn't it?"" She frowned, realizing the truth of her words only as she spoke them. ""I should be devastated, but mostly I'm just... furious.""



""Perhaps you weren't as in love as you thought.""



Miranda considered this. ""Maybe not. I kept pushing back the wedding date. Ryan was always pushing for it, but something kept holding me back."" She swallowed hard. ""There was no... fire between us. No passion. Just comfort and familiarity.""



Nolan remained silent, letting her work through her thoughts.



""God, that's pathetic, isn't it? I was going to marry a man who didn't even make my heart race."" Miranda laughed again, the sound hollow. ""And the sad thing is, I have nothing to compare it to. Ryan's the only man I've ever been with.""



The silence that followed her confession was electric. Miranda found herself staring at Nolan's mouth—the perfect curve of his lips, the slight shadow of stubble on his jaw. What would it feel like to kiss him? The thought appeared from nowhere, shocking in its clarity.



""That's not pathetic,"" Nolan finally said, his voice rougher than before. ""That's—""



Miranda didn't let him finish. In a moment of reckless courage fueled by alcohol and desperation, she grabbed his silk tie and pulled him down to her level. Their lips crashed together, and everything in her world tilted on its axis.



This. This was what had been missing.



Nolan's lips were firm against hers, his surprise evident in his momentary stillness before he responded with a hunger that matched her own. His hands gripped her waist, not pushing her away but pulling her closer. Miranda gasped against his mouth, overwhelmed by the intensity of the sensation.



When Nolan finally pulled back, his eyes were dark with desire. ""Miranda, we shouldn't—""



""Please,"" she whispered, cutting him off with another kiss. ""Please don't stop.""



His resistance crumbled visibly. With a low growl, Nolan spun them around, lifting Miranda onto his desk in one fluid motion. Her skirt rode up her thighs as he stepped between them, his hands tangling in her hair as he deepened the kiss.



For the first time in her life, Miranda understood what it meant to be consumed by desire. Every nerve ending in her body was alive, every touch electric. This wasn't just a kiss—it was a revelation.



And as Nolan's mouth moved from her lips to her neck, Miranda surrendered completely to the fire she'd been missing all her life.

...

Nolan's kiss left Miranda breathless, her entire body humming with an unfamiliar electricity. The sensation was so intense, so overwhelming that it shattered everything she thought she knew about physical attraction. This—this wild, consuming fire—was what had been missing from her relationship with Ryan.



""Is this normal?"" she whispered against Nolan's lips, her voice trembling. ""To feel like I'm burning from the inside out?""



Nolan pulled back slightly, his steel-gray eyes darkened with desire but still sharp with awareness. ""Miranda, you're drunk.""



""Not too drunk to know what I want,"" she countered, her fingers still clutching his tie like a lifeline. ""Show me. Please. Show me what it's supposed to feel like.""



He studied her face, his expression a mixture of hunger and restraint. ""You might regret this tomorrow.""



Miranda let out a soft, desperate laugh. ""I've spent years regretting what I never felt. Tonight, I want to feel everything.""



Nolan's jaw tightened as he deliberated, clearly torn between desire and responsibility. Miranda could see the exact moment his control began to fracture. But still, he hesitated.



""I need your explicit consent,"" he said, his voice rough with barely contained need. ""I won't take advantage of you.""



Without breaking eye contact, Miranda reached for his leather desk pad and pen. In bold, clear handwriting that belied her intoxication, she wrote:



I, Miranda Holden, being of sound mind despite the scotch, give Nolan Shelton permission to do whatever he wants with me tonight.



She signed it with a flourish and pushed it toward him.



""Explicit enough for you?""



Nolan's eyes darkened further as he read her words. ""Are you absolutely certain?""



""Yes,"" Miranda whispered, her heart pounding against her ribs like a caged bird. ""I've never been more certain of anything.""



Something shifted in Nolan's demeanor—the last thread of his restraint snapping. His posture straightened, his shoulders squaring as he moved away from the desk. When he spoke again, his voice held a commanding edge that sent shivers racing down her spine.



""Kneel.""



Miranda blinked, momentarily startled by the transformation. Gone was her controlled, professional boss. In his place stood a man accustomed to dominance, to being obeyed without question. The request should have offended her independent spirit, but instead, it ignited something primal within her.



Without a word, she slid from the desk and lowered herself to her knees before him, her eyes never leaving his.



Nolan circled her slowly, like a predator assessing its prey. When he stood behind her, his fingers brushed against the tight bun at the nape of her neck. ""I've always wondered about your hair,"" he murmured, removing the pins one by one. ""How long it really is when it's not restrained.""



Miranda remained still as her blonde waves cascaded down her back, finally free. Nolan made a sound of appreciation as he ran his fingers through the silky strands.



""Beautiful,"" he breathed, gathering her hair in his fist. ""Just as I imagined.""



The gentle tug on her scalp sent unexpected pleasure coursing through her veins. Miranda's eyes fluttered closed, her lips parting on a silent gasp.



Nolan moved to stand before her again, his expression intense. ""Take off your jacket.""



With trembling fingers, Miranda complied, shrugging out of her tailored blazer to reveal the thin silk camisole beneath. Her nipples hardened visibly against the delicate fabric, a response to both the cool air and his burning gaze.



""No bra,"" Nolan observed, his voice dropping an octave. ""Have you been like this all day, Miss Holden? Working just a few feet away from me, practically naked under your prim little suit?""



Miranda's cheeks flushed hot with embarrassment and arousal. ""I—I didn't think—""



""Clearly,"" he interrupted, trailing one finger along her collarbone, then lower, tracing the outline of her breast through the silk. ""Do you have any idea what the sight of you like this does to me?""



Miranda couldn't speak, could barely breathe. Every nerve ending in her body seemed to concentrate wherever his finger touched.



""Answer me,"" Nolan commanded softly.



""No,"" she managed, her voice barely audible.



""It makes me want to ruin you,"" he confessed, cupping her breast fully now, his thumb brushing over her nipple. ""It makes me want to hear you scream my name until your voice gives out.""



Miranda whimpered, her body responding to his words as much as his touch.



""Is this what you wanted, Miranda?"" he asked, his free hand tilting her chin up to meet his gaze. ""To be completely at my mercy?""



""Yes,"" she admitted, the word catching in her throat.



Nolan's smile was darkly satisfied. ""Good girl,"" he praised, the endearment sending another jolt of pleasure through her. His hand moved from her breast to her throat, not squeezing but resting there possessively, a reminder of his control. ""Now be a good girl and undo my pants.""



Miranda's fingers trembled as she reached for his belt, her entire world narrowing to this moment, to this man, to the desperate need building inside her that only he could satisfy.

I have 3 weeks in Japan Dec 20th-Jan11th I have no solid plan (Kansai & Kyushu are top of the list)  but I am concerned that the cities will be very quiet over my middle week during New Years. Can anyone confirm what it is like, if they spent time in Japan during that period? 

My current thinking is to do a week in Kyoto/Nara and fly to Ishigaki for the middle week to enjoy beaches and sun before flying back to Osaka and continuing to Fukuoka. 

  
I don't mind chilling out, hiking, drinking coffee/sake and reading a good book in nature, but I don't want to be in a ghost town either.

1mn8rub,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_businessnewstv/comments/1mn8rub/lowcost_business_startup_ideas_that_outperform/,Low-Cost Business Startup Ideas That Outperform Expensive Ventures,"# Think Local, Start Small, Profit Big

You’ve probably heard the phrase, “It takes money to make money.” While that sounds reasonable, reality paints a different picture—especially in the local business world. Many entrepreneurs launch high-investment ventures like luxury restaurants or big retail outlets, only to get buried in debt before turning a profit. Meanwhile, small local startups with lean budgets often thrive by staying agile, meeting real needs, and keeping costs low.

In this guide, we’ll explore **offline local business ideas** that cost less to start but can still generate impressive returns. For each idea, you’ll get:

* **Startup cost estimates**
* **Expected monthly income**
* **Average profit margin**
* **Why it beats high-cost competitors**

# 1. Home Cleaning Services

**Startup Costs:** $200–$800 (cleaning supplies, basic marketing, transportation)  
**Estimated Monthly Income:** $2,000–$5,000  
**Profit Margin:** 50–70%

Why it works: Cleaning services require almost no fixed location costs and can scale quickly. Unlike a cleaning franchise with huge fees, you can start as a solo operator, build a client base, and expand into specialized services like carpet or window cleaning.

# 2. Mobile Car Wash & Detailing

**Startup Costs:** $500–$1,500 (pressure washer, cleaning kits, water storage, advertising)  
**Estimated Monthly Income:** $3,000–$6,000  
**Profit Margin:** 60–80%

Why it works: Customers love the convenience of having their cars cleaned at home or work. There’s no need to rent a lot or maintain expensive equipment beyond the basics.

# 3. Tutoring & Academic Coaching

**Startup Costs:** $100–$500 (teaching materials, flyers, online listing fees)  
**Estimated Monthly Income:** $1,500–$4,000  
**Profit Margin:** 80–90%

Why it works: Education is always in demand. Whether it’s after-school tutoring for kids or skill coaching for adults, you can start from your living room or go directly to clients.

# 4. Local Event Planning

**Startup Costs:** $300–$1,200 (basic decor, marketing, business cards)  
**Estimated Monthly Income:** $2,000–$7,000  
**Profit Margin:** 40–60%

Why it works: Weddings, birthdays, and community events are constant. Starting small with budget-conscious clients helps you grow organically without needing a large venue or inventory.

# 5. Pop-Up Food Stand

**Startup Costs:** $1,000–$3,500 (cooking gear, permits, initial inventory)  
**Estimated Monthly Income:** $3,000–$8,000  
**Profit Margin:** 35–50%

Why it works: Instead of committing to a full restaurant lease, pop-up stands let you test recipes, build a following, and move to high-traffic areas for maximum sales.

# 📊 Low-Cost vs. High-Cost Ventures: A Side-by-Side Look

|Business Type|Startup Cost|Monthly Income Potential|Profit Margin|Risk Level|Time to Break Even|

* **Google My Business Listing** – Free and boosts local SEO.
* **Referral Discounts** – Reward customers who bring friends.
* **Local Facebook Groups** – Share value, not just ads.
* **Partner with Complementary Businesses** – e.g., a tutor partnering with a stationery shop.

# FAQs

**Q: How can I fund my low-cost business if I still need some capital?**  
A: Use personal savings, small personal loans, or even community crowdfunding instead of taking large bank loans.

**Q: Which of these businesses can be started part-time?**  
A: Tutoring, mobile car wash, and cleaning services can be started while keeping a day job.

**Q: Do I need business insurance for these ventures?**  
A: Yes, even small businesses benefit from basic liability coverage—it’s inexpensive peace of mind.

# Final Takeaway

Starting a business doesn’t have to mean drowning in debt or spending years waiting to see a profit. With the right low-cost local venture, you can build a loyal customer base, generate steady income, and scale over time—all without the pressure of massive overhead.

1mn8r50,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1mn8r50/foolproof_guide_to_winning_the_ai_hype_in_india/,Foolproof guide to winning the AI hype in India,"AI is booming in India. But why bother learning it when you can just sell it? Here’s the playbook our favourite Instagram “AI mentors” have mastered.

Step 1: The Bait

Start with a landing page that looks like it belongs to Silicon Valley but was actually made on Canva in an afternoon. Fill it with phrases like “future proof your career” and “AI for everyone.”

Throw in logos of IIT Bombay or IIT Delhi. No, you don’t have to actually work with them or even studies in them. Just say things like “guest lecture at IIT” and let people assume the rest. Ps. You don’t even have to stepped into to any IIT.

Step 2: The Lure

Run Instagram reels and ads targeting fresh graduates and anxious working professionals. Say things like:

1. “I went from 20k a month to 2 lakh a month thanks to AI”
2. “Anyone can learn AI in 3 hours”
3. “No coding needed”

Always record these videos in a coffee shop or a fake luxury office. Rent a MacBook for the day if you have to.

Step 3: The Hook

Offer a ₹9 “AI Masterclass.” The structure is always the same. One hour of showing random free tools like ChatGPT, Canva and Pictory. The next two hours are nothing but a sales pitch for your ₹30,000 “Pro AI Certification” with the same fake urgency: “90% discount today only.” Which, of course, runs every single day.

Step 4: The Fear Injection

Convince people that AI will take their jobs within months. Say things like “Only certified AI experts will survive” or “Companies are already replacing employees with AI.” Fear is the fastest way to open wallets.

Step 5: The Big Upsell

The ₹30k course content is always the same. A bunch of ChatGPT prompts lifted from Reddit. Some tips on how to sound smart on LinkedIn. And a lot of motivational fluff stolen from self-help books.

Step 6: The Fake Credibility

End with a shiny “AI Certification” with your logo on it. No company will recognise it, but it looks great on LinkedIn when the student writes, “Proud to be a certified AI professional.”

Step 7: Profit

And just like that, you are now an AI guru without ever learning anything about AI. All it takes is a landing page, a few Instagram ads, some fear-mongering and a lot of recycled ChatGPT content.

If you’ve ever been stumped for a present and ended up buying a gift basket, you already understand the magic of this business.

* **Low startup cost** – You don’t need a fancy store; you can work from home.
* **High perceived value** – Customers often pay more for the presentation than the actual items.
* **Year-round demand** – Birthdays, corporate events, holidays, baby showers, weddings…the list is endless.
* **Creative freedom** – You can design baskets that match any niche, theme, or price point.

Here’s the kicker: if you can source products smartly and package them attractively, your profit margins can range from **40% to over 200%**.

# Profitable Gift Basket Niches That Sell Like Hotcakes

Choosing the right niche can mean the difference between “just okay” sales and a sold-out business.

1. **Gourmet Food & Wine Baskets** – Artisan cheeses, chocolates, craft wine. Perfect for corporate gifting.
2. **New Baby Baskets** – Blankets, bibs, toys, keepsakes. Emotional purchases often lead to higher spend.
3. **Spa & Self-Care Kits** – Bath bombs, candles, herbal teas—people love a pampering experience.
4. **Pet Lover Baskets** – Chew toys, treats, grooming supplies. Pet owners are some of the most loyal repeat customers.

6. **Corporate Appreciation Baskets** – Perfect for employee gifts, client thank-yous, and event swag.

Pro tip: Start with **one to two niches** to keep costs low and branding consistent.

# Step-by-Step: How to Start Your Affordable Gift Basket Business

Here’s your **roadmap from idea to first sale**.

# Step 1: Research Your Target Market

* Look at local trends and online bestsellers.
* Check competitors’ prices, basket contents, and reviews.
* Identify gaps—maybe your town lacks luxury pet baskets or vegan gourmet hampers.

# Step 2: Pick Your Niche & Theme

* Don’t try to please everyone—specialization helps marketing.
* Pick a theme that excites you. Passion shows in your product.

# Step 3: Source Affordable Products

* Buy wholesale from sites like **Alibaba, Faire, DollarDays**, or even local discount stores.
* Consider handmade items from Etsy sellers (if you can get bulk deals).
* Include 1–2 “wow” items and fill space with affordable but attractive fillers.

# Step 4: Choose Baskets & Packaging

* Presentation sells. Use sturdy baskets, boxes, or reusable tote bags.
* Shredded paper, tissue, ribbons, and shrink wrap can transform cheap items into a luxury-looking gift.

# Step 5: Pricing for Profit

* Rule of thumb: Retail price = **(Cost of goods + Packaging + Labor) × 2 to 3**.
* Higher perceived value justifies higher pricing—never race to the bottom.

# Step 6: Set Up Your Brand

* Create a simple but professional logo (Canva works great).
* Decide on a business name that reflects your style—e.g., “Bliss Basket Co.” or “The Gifting Spot.”
* Take high-quality photos for your listings.

# Step 7: Start Selling

* Use **Etsy, Facebook Marketplace, Instagram**, and **local craft fairs**.
* Partner with local florists, bakeries, or event planners.
* Offer custom orders for weddings, corporate events, and holidays.

# Marketing Strategies to Boost Sales Fast

Even the prettiest basket won’t sell if no one knows about it.

* **Social Media Showcases** – Post unboxing videos, behind-the-scenes packaging, and seasonal launches.
* **Influencer Partnerships** – Local influencers can review or showcase your baskets to their audience.
* **Holiday Preorders** – Create urgency by offering limited-edition baskets for Christmas, Valentine’s Day, etc.
* **Loyalty Programs** – Offer discounts for repeat customers or referrals.
* **Gift Card Add-Ons** – Partner with local coffee shops or spas to make your baskets more attractive.

# Scaling from Side Hustle to Full-Time Income

Once your business is running smoothly:

* Invest in bulk buying for better margins.
* Create a professional website with an online ordering system.
* Offer subscription services (e.g., “Gift Basket of the Month Club”).
* Hire part-time help during peak seasons.
* Automate packaging steps with pre-assembled kits.

# Quick Profit Hacks

* Use **themed filler** (like shredded gold paper) to make smaller baskets look fuller.
* Offer **personalized name tags or cards**—people pay extra for customization.
* Sell **“emergency gift baskets”** for last-minute buyers at a premium.

# FAQs

**Q: How much does it cost to start?**  
A: You can start with as little as $200–$300 if you keep your first inventory small.

**Q: Do I need a business license?**  
A: Usually yes, especially if you’re selling food items. Check your local regulations.

# Final Word: Your Basket, Your Business

An affordable gift basket business is one of the rare ventures where **creativity meets profitability**. With a small initial investment, the right niche, and smart marketing, you can go from your first basket to a steady stream of orders in just weeks.

If so, what advice would you give?","Hello, throwaway for obvious reasons, I will try to keep it short but it still is going to be a long one so buckle up. I will include a TL;DR at the end.

Disclaimer for the following:

1. my wife was diagnosed with BPD and depression and she did tell me on our 2nd date.
2. English is not my native language so I'm sorry if I do not explain some things well.

My wife and I have been together for 6 years, married last 3. Our relationship started with lots of fun and exciting things - and a lot of alcohol - it felt like we were made for each other! Never fight, always agree, always do stuff together. She even got to the point of actually making progress with her mental issues and had told me that I had played a huge role for that. This was no lie because you could actually \*see\* that she is better.

This all started to change when we decided to move in together, suddenly house chores and personal time created a lot of minor arguments but never something major. Except, our intimacy had started to deteriorate, we went from being physical 3-4 times a week to maybe twice a month. For a time, this was fine. I never was the one to have a huge libido so it did not bother me.

Fast forward some time and we are generally fine, not at our best but not in a bad state. Then for reasons I cannot disclose, she lost her job and was unable to get another even if she tried for a while (the reasons are not at all connected with the story, I am not leaving something out). This caused her to plunge into a deep deppression state, was at home all day watching TV series and being completely non-verbal. At this point, I was forced to ""man up"", I took 2 part-time jobs on top of my full-time and promised to her that she would have everything she needed, everything we needed.

Working so much is exhausting, anyone can agree to that. I asked if she could take care of the house and try to cook but I was met with something along the lines of ""so just because you are working and I am not, you expect me to do everything around the house?"" and then started crying. I melted. I told her that she is right and left it at that.  
In the meantime, our sex life dropped to 0 and we barely interacted at all except on the weekends when I had time. This phase lasted for about 6 months.

On a specific night, I had to work overtime at my full-time job as they were onboarding a new client and needed half the office to stay for an extra 4-5 hours. No biggie, just extra cash so I could work less on my part time jobs this week. I informed her of course about this. I ended up going home at around midnight. I enter the house and she is still locked in the room she was watching TV series on her laptop, this room was 3 meters away from the main door of the house. The dog was jumping on my and crying by how much he needed to go for a walk, as soon as we exited the house he found the closest tree and did his thing, while usually he took his sweet time to find a spot. Back in the house, I desperately look for anything to eat - nothing - I boil some noodles, have my dinner and she is still locked in the room. That was my breaking point. Her psychology managed to drag mine to the dirt as well, I felt like I was trying to do whatever I can to lift her up but never could. Despite having 3 jobs, I tried to spend as much time with her as possible. Watch something together for a couple of hours on weekdays when I was beat, try to go places on the weekends, take her to buy stuff for hobbies she wanted to start, getting coffee or ice cream and walking together. So, that night, I broke things off. It was not easy, but I could not keep this up.

We had a lot of common friends, so the next few months I would see her here and there with these friends. We both agreed that the worst thing we lost when we broke up was our closest friend and so still stayed friends with no hate between us. We steadily started going out more - but never alone. Well, one thing led to another and we got back together approximately 8 months after we broke up. Now she was back to work as normal.

Again initially, we had a lot of fun going out and doing stuff. Everything was perfect once again, we even started to get intimate with each other. Then out of nowhere, we start fighting for the stupidest of reasons. Most arguments were non-arguments, typical conversations that turned sour. I always stayed calm and because of assumptions she made, she got mad and I was to blame because of: my tone, the way I said it, the way I looked at her, the way I breathed. This was not an assumption I made, she admitted this to me on another occasion. No matter, I told myself, it's just a phase. If I don't like her at her worst, I don't deserve her at her best right? Again intimacy fell down to 0, barely even a single 0.5 second kiss per day. I try to touch, hug and interact with her and she accepts it for a second then continues with what she was doing.

Well, nothing ever changed. Apart from 1-2 moments, the following year was more of the same. I was verbal several times about how I don't even feel she loves me anymore and how I require more in this relationship because ""right now it's as if we are just housemates, or 2 people forced to live together"". She responded, slow changes and 2 weeks later we even were intimate again, once. Well, that did not last long, 1 week after being intimate again not only did we go back to square 1, it is even worse now. I do not recall a single conversation that did not turn into me ""saying something"" that triggered her and she start a fight. I put that in quotes because this is what she told me, I disagree 95% of the time because I really do not imply what she is saying I am implying, and on that 5% of the time that I realize that I actually made a mistake, I tell her and then she is like ""yeah but this is happening too often"" refusing my apology and implying that the 95% of the time that I disagree are BS too.

We both go to therapists, I started due to anxiety disorder but even though I'm better, I still like to go because my therapist makes me think about stuff I would never think about alone.

We agreed to go to a marriage counsellor/psychologist, she told me that she would ask her therapist for any recommendations and that this was really important for her, she has went for therapy twice by now and has never mentioned this again.

I'm not looking for someone to blame on this, and I understand this is my side of the story only. I just want to know if this marriage is salvageable, and if it is, how?

TL;DR

Wife and I cannot talk to each other without fighting, and our intimacy fell down to non-existent levels. Can we save this marriage?

1mn8mym,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mn8mym,I Built a Travel Journaling App That Actually Makes Sense - Would Love Your Feedback!,"Hey r/SideProject  

So I got tired of juggling between Google Photos, Maps, Notes, and trying to remember ""wait, what did I do after that cafe in Paris?"" when telling travel stories. Built this app called **Groute** that automatically connects your photos by location and time to create visual travel routes.

**Here's the hook:** Just upload your travel photos → GPS data creates your journey path automatically → Add quick 30-character thoughts → Share as beautiful web pages that friends can actually explore.

Think of it as your travel memories getting the ""connect the dots"" treatment, but way cooler.

**What makes it different:**

* Your route appears instantly as you add photos (no manual plotting!)
* Map-first approach - location is the main navigation, not date folders
* 30-character limit on notes (forces you to capture the essence, not write essays)
* Creates shareable journey pages that work like mini travel guides

Built this because I'm convinced that **location + time + moment = perfect travel memory**, and most apps only handle one of these well.

Currently in beta and would genuinely love to get some feedback from fellow travelers who actually *get* the pain of organizing travel memories!

**If you're interested in trying it out, comment below or DM me!** Especially looking for feedback from people who travel frequently or have that ""I have 10,000 unorganized travel photos"" problem.

What do you think? Does this solve a real problem or am I just overthinking travel journaling? 🤔

I just want to preface this by saying that I know I'm experiencing some feelings which are inappropriate and wrong. I don't need tobhe told they're wrong; I know that. I need help figuring out how to deal with them and what if anything to tell my wife about them. Obviously, I've anonymised names.

I (30M) have been married for 8 years, to Winifred (26F). We have a child and a house together and I am truly happy in the relationship. I am still in love with her, though over 8 years ill admit that that love has become mostly quiet and strong and consistent rather than the bubbles amd butterflies of the early days (which I think is natural and which I generally enjoy and even prefer). Our lives are totally intertwined, particualrly from my end- most of my friends I met through her and visa versa, her brother has become my best friend, etc.

Winifred has two cousins who are a good bit younger than her and were children when we got together and I first met them. They live quite far away now but we visit or they visit once a year or more. They are now young adults: Sue (18F) and Amie (16F). We usually visit them and their mum (Winifred's Aunt, 50F) in the summer for a few weeks, but this year they are visiting us without mum for three and a half weeks.

I always had vaguely paternal/caregiving feelings for Winifred's cousins, until a few years ago when I took Amie out for coffee and found myself really connecting with her emotionally and noticing how very beautiful she was. She would have been maybe 14 years old at that point, and I knew that it would be inappropriate to have any romantic feelings for her, so I tried my best to squash the very idea of that and focus on how proud I was of who she's grown up to be and how i could help her and interract with her in ways that reinforced for myself the obvious boundaries between us. 

That hasn't worked. Since then, what I can only describe as a crush, and quite a trong one, on her has formed on my part, slowly, over the years. She is now 16 which is the age of consent in my country so a relationship would be legal, but it would still be wildly unethical, I know, for reasons of power dynamic and because I am married. That hasnt stopped an increasingly intense infatuation. Perhaps it's because she is now of legal age, perhaps it's because I'm less on guard because we're in my house not theirs, perhaps its the absence of Winifred's aunt, perhaps its coincidence, but these feelings have become almost overwhelming in the past week while Sue and Amie have been staying with us 

I do not want these feelings. I am happy with my wife. I don't want a relationship with a 16 year old. I don't want to have to acknowledge or for anyone else to realise that I had feelings for her when she was only 14 or 15. I don't want to break up my marriage to Winifred, to destroy my current relationship with Amie, or to upset the balance of my life. I dont want anyone to know about my feelings. I feel guilty over them. And I am conflicted because there is also a part of me that desperately wants, above all else, a relationship with Amie. In some fictional dream world I even somehow want to keep my marriage to Winifred and have a romantic relationship with Amie, absurd and awful as that desire is. I dont want these feelings or desires but they're there whether or not I want them.

I do not believe that Amie knows how I feel, and I do not believe that she reciprocates any romantic feelings towards me, though we are emotionally close. However, Winifred has absolutely caught on this week. She told me last night that she feels I've been ""weird"" with Amie this week - that I mess around with Amie more than I do with Sue, that I seem to touch Amie often and that I compliment her an awful lot, and that I take more pictures of Amie than of anyone else when we go out on day trips. Winifred did say that from her perspective it may be nothing as she doesn't have much experience of healthy relationships of mine and Amies's dynamics, but she's definitely suspicious - I think she suspects that i have a crush but doesn't necessarily think that I have realised it. I waved away some of her concerns by saying I've just always found Amie easier to interact with than Sue (which is true), and the rest I addressed by saying I hadn't realised I was being weird and I'd pay more attention to how I behaved (also somewhat true as I hadnt realised how lacking in self control I've been this week) - I didn't admit to having any feelings.

I had no idea I was that transparent and I feel like an idiot. I feel like an idiot for letting myself develop these feelings for Amie, I feel like an idiot for having acted upon them, even in the tiny ways I hadn't fully noticed but Winifred has. I feel like an idiot for getting 'caught' and like a depraved bastard for having feelings to get caught.

I don't know how to address this situation without either continuing to lie, or making the family dynamic for everyone incredibly awkward and difficult.

Part of me wants to bring a half-truth, to tell Winifred that I hadn't noticed but that I have started viewing Amie differently and acting differently towards her and that those feelings distress me and I'm not going to let them go any further - but without admitting how long I've had them for. Part of me thinks it's best to start behaving myself, acting more carefully, and hope Winifred doesn't bring it up again. Hopefully if I'm more careful how I behave and if I make efforts to withdraw a little from Amie emotionally and in terms of time spent together I can kill the feelings and not have to confront them with my wife. 

In an ideal world, I want to continue to spend time with my extended family and my friends without the spectre of this weird crush hanging over us, and I want my marriage to remain intact. I don't want to never see Amie again but I don't want the good thing I've got to be ruined because of them either. And I don't want my poor wife tonhave tonwither make up excuses or gave an awkward conversation with her family about me to limit contact. Best case scenario: we all keep trotting along without anyone acting on any inappropriate feelings or having our family dynamic affected by them.

I really don't know how to address the situation and all of my close friends I fear would come from a place of judgement so I can't talk to them, so I guess I'm here to seek out any advice I can gain.

TL;DR: i have an increasingly powerful and obvious infatuation with my wife's quite literally barely legal cousin and I think she (my wife) has caught on. I fully intend to dial back my contact and be more careful with my behaviour but cant decide how honest to be with my wife as im afraid of ruining what has been a pleasant family dynamic.

I’ll jump right in to the situation, sorry that it’s long… 

Me 32F, him 44M met 5 years ago at work (scientific research). By the way he previously lied and said he was 2 years younger. At the time I was in a long term relationship which wasn’t going very well. I now believe he saw this and started to love bomb me. The majority of this happened over video chat during lockdown. As you can imagine he was saying all the right things that I wanted to hear, I was over the moon I had found someone who appreciated me. There were red flags a few months in, mostly gas lighting me into believing I had or hadn’t said things, when I knew the opposite was true. I decided to call it off but he wouldn’t let me go, telling me I’d never find anyone better than him etc. I felt trapped because of how close our research groups work together. 

I managed to draw the line but felt trapped and that I had to keep him pacified incase he tried to sabotage my career - I thought this could be a possibility as everyone in the field knows each other. We remained “friends” but these types of situations continued. 

The worst one was at a work party I organised. I was hosting the quiz and walking around all the tables. His table happened to be losing. On the mic I mentioned the top and bottom team, joking around and saying they could catch up.. all to play for etc etc. well he didn’t like that, he spat his drink out all over other colleagues and students. Told me to F off. I was taken aback and got the next round going. I then asked if he wanted to speak away from the table. To me it was obvious he wasn’t upset over a quiz. So what had ticked him off? It’s that I had sat with my lab group while having some food, rather than him. He went on to say how they were all stupid, why would I want to spend time with them, that the only reason he came to the party was because of me. I tried to walk away and he followed me into the bathroom. I locked myself in a cubicle. Several members of staff came to break it off. He ended up leaving. Later that day I returned to the office to find gifts if given him dumped on my desk. Higher ups got involved, he was given a slap on the wrist but I was scared to make a formal complaint. I wish I had. 

A few years passed and there were some other issues but not as bad as the party. Mostly him calling me crazy, insane etc. I told myself that it would be over in a few years, I’d finish my PhD and leave. I just needed to make sure I gave him no reason to interfere with my next career move. Essentially, I felt and still feel very trapped. Retrospectively I’ve realised it doesn’t matter how nice I am. His reality is very warped. 

A month or so ago I got the courage to tell him that I didn’t appreciate his anger towards me. Of course he was super apologetic. Would “walk over broken glass for me” and “I think the world of you”. I believed it. Not a week later hes scolding me for having a tea break with other colleagues and not him. The back story is an hour previous he asked if I wanted to go for a walk and coffee. I was busy and said I couldn’t. But luckily for me 45 mins later I had a spare 5 minutes. I took a break before my next mammoth task (non stop for 4hrs). He saw me in the tea room. Apparently “I should be embarrassed I got caught 😂”. He was very disappointed and said it was typical behaviour from me, that he shouldn’t be surprised. I pushed back and said I should be able to have a break when I’m want. I stopped replying. The next day he messages me asking to make peace. I told him I was busy and we haven’t spoken since. I’ve been anxious ever since this and not wanting to go to work. 

I can no longer do this. I don’t want to go in to the lab, I keep having panic attacks and have been prescribed beta blockers. I feel like I can’t tell my like manager as they are collaborators and with a previous situation they put it down to this person still being in love with me, blah blah (this was now 4 years ago!!). I have felt so ashamed and that this was my fault but ive now seen the light. I’ve told my SO and closest friends, some of whom are at work with me. 

Im really struggling here. Theres a power imbalance. I have a year left of my contract. Very stressful time for me finishing my PhD, need to line up job for after, conflicting timelines with my current SO. Do not need this on top of everything and want to move on with my life. 

I feel like I should text him and tell him to now leave me alone. That I’ll be polite and cordial in meetings but he is not to contact me (I’ll block his number). What do you all think?? Please be honest. ",1,1754905576.0,abusiverelationships,1,1.0,False

The initial impression of opal moon is a burst of brightness and freshness. Sparkling citrus notes, like bergamot and grapefruit, mingle with the delicate sweetness of ripe pear.

At the heart of opal moon lies a captivating blend of floral notes. Jasmine sambac, known for its intoxicating and creamy aroma, takes center stage. Complementing the jasmine is a unique moonflower accord, designed to evoke the ethereal beauty of a moonlit garden. This accord typically incorporates floral nuances such as tuberose and gardenia, creating a complex and alluring floral heart that is both feminine and mysterious.

**Base Notes: Creamy Sandalwood,Vanilla,and Musk**

The foundation of opal moon is built upon a warm and sensual base. Creamy sandalwood provides a smooth and grounding effect, while vanilla adds a touch of sweetness and comfort. Musk contributes a subtle animalic undertone, enhancing the perfume's longevity and creating a lingering, captivating trail. This base accord perfectly balances the brighter top and heart notes, ensuring a well-rounded and sophisticated fragrance experience.

1mn8md2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mn8md2,📍 I Built a Travel Journaling App Groute That Actually Makes Sense - Would Love Your Feedback!,"Hey r/apps 

So I got tired of juggling between Google Photos, Maps, Notes, and trying to remember ""wait, what did I do after that cafe in Paris?"" when telling travel stories. Built this app called **Groute** that automatically connects your photos by location and time to create visual travel routes.

**Here's the hook:** Just upload your travel photos → GPS data creates your journey path automatically → Add quick 30-character thoughts → Share as beautiful web pages that friends can actually explore.

Think of it as your travel memories getting the ""connect the dots"" treatment, but way cooler.

**What makes it different:**

* Your route appears instantly as you add photos (no manual plotting!)
* Map-first approach - location is the main navigation, not date folders
* 30-character limit on notes (forces you to capture the essence, not write essays)
* Creates shareable journey pages that work like mini travel guides

Built this because I'm convinced that **location + time + moment = perfect travel memory**, and most apps only handle one of these well.

Currently in beta and would genuinely love to get some feedback from fellow travelers who actually *get* the pain of organizing travel memories!

**If you're interested in trying it out, comment below or DM me!** Especially looking for feedback from people who travel frequently or have that ""I have 10,000 unorganized travel photos"" problem.

What do you think? Does this solve a real problem or am I just overthinking travel journaling? 🤔

**P.S.** \- The app shows Paris in the screenshots but works anywhere your phone can GPS tag photos. Been testing it everywhere from Seoul coffee shops to Patagonian highways!",1,1754905547.0,apps,0,1.0,False

Last year I fell in love with someone unexpectedly, and it was the best thing that happened to me, it's sad that the relationship didn't work out.
The relationship was like as shown in the movies, same music taste, films, political interest, obsessing over Anjan Dutta, finishing eachother's sentences.
We used live together, had a cat together.
He used to cook for me, care for me, made me feel seen, look after.
He used to wake me up by playing ""Honey, it's alright"" ( by Isakov) on his guitar. Knew exactly how I liked my tea or coffee. 
We loved the city, we used hangout mostly in maidan and the ghats, walking through college street on an rainy evening, Oxford bookstore, museums.
We were extremely passionate about Art, so when I was with him my artistic side bloomed and I used to write poetry every, words just flowed like water in a stream. We broke up during Durga Puja last year due to him shifting to another city and he told me that he cannot make this relationship work, so we broke up.
I don't miss him regularly, he's like a poem which made me feel so many things in such a less time that I felt like drowning. 
I miss at certain nights when I feel compelled to read the poem, knowing I'll be drowning after finishing it.

So… layoffs suck.  
One day you’re deep in deadlines. The next, you’re staring at an email telling you it’s over.  
It’s jarring. It’s personal. And yeah—it hurts.

But here’s the thing: this isn’t just an ending. It can be a reset button.  
AI is changing industries. Some doors close, but new ones are opening. Here’s how to regroup, rebuild, and get back out there—stronger.

# 1. Let’s Be Honest—This Hurts

You didn’t see it coming. Or maybe you did, but hoped it wouldn’t happen.  
Either way, it’s a gut punch. Your job wasn’t just a paycheck—it was your rhythm, your confidence, your identity.

**The truth:** layoffs aren’t about your worth.  
They’re usually about budgets, automation, or restructuring. You’re still valuable. And this chapter? It could lead to something better.

# 2. First Step—Pause and Breathe

Before you spam 50 job applications… stop.  
Give yourself a few days to process.  
Use that time to:

* **Acknowledge the change** – This isn’t your fault.
* **Recharge** – Sleep, eat well, walk, unplug.
* **Reconnect socially** – Grab coffee with friends or family.
* **Reflect quietly** – Journal, think, get clarity.
* **Set a calm tone** – You’ll make smarter moves with a clear head.

# 3. Take Stock of Your Skills

Open a doc. Start listing *everything* you’re good at. Not “marketing”—but *“increased campaign engagement by 40%.”*

Think beyond your last role. What’s valuable in *today’s* market?

* Digital literacy (AI tools, cloud platforms)
* Data analysis & reporting
* Tech adaptability
* Creative problem-solving
* Strong communication (especially remote)
* Collaboration across teams/time zones
* Project management
* Industry-specific tools (CRM, design software, coding)
* Emotional intelligence

Seeing it all written down? That’s your confidence boost.

# 4. Upskilling—Your Safety Net

If AI is replacing jobs, it’s also creating new ones. The skills you learn now could keep you safe in the next round of layoffs.

High-value skills to consider:

* Python programming
* Data visualization (Power BI, Tableau)
* AI & machine learning basics
* Cloud computing (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)
* Automation tools (Zapier, UiPath)
* Cybersecurity fundamentals
* Digital marketing & SEO
* Soft skills (adaptability, communication)

Short online courses can open big doors.

# 5. Get Those Certifications

Skills are great. Proof is better.  
Certs and portfolios show you didn’t just sit still—you leveled up.

# 6. Make an ATS-Friendly Resume

* Simple formatting
* Job posting keywords
* Measurable results, not just tasks
* Skip the fancy fonts

This gets you past the software *and* the recruiter.

# 7. Start Talking to People

Networking after layoffs feels weird. But people want to help.

* Reconnect with ex-colleagues
* Join industry meetups (online or IRL)
* Share what you’re learning, not just “I need a job”

# 8. Fix Your Online Presence

Your LinkedIn is your storefront.

* Update your headline and skills
* Post something useful occasionally
* Show you’re active and engaged

# 9. Apply Strategically

Don’t spray and pray.

* Target industries *growing* in the AI era (healthcare tech, renewable energy, cybersecurity)
* Customize resume + cover letter for each job
* Research the company before applying

# 10. Prepare for AI-Screened Interviews

Yup, even interviews are AI-filtered now.

* Keep answers clear and concise
* Use keywords from the job posting
* Have short, impactful stories ready

# 11. Show Resilience

Employers want problem-solvers, not panic-quitters.  
Talk about new skills, side projects, or challenges you’ve overcome since the layoff.

# 12. Consider a Pivot

Maybe your next step isn’t the same industry.  
Consulting, freelancing, or switching fields could mean more stability.

# 13. Keep Moving Forward

Layoffs aren’t a dead end—they’re a detour.  
Keep learning. Keep connecting. Keep applying—*with intention.*

**TL;DR:**  
Layoffs hurt. Take a breath. Inventory your skills. Learn new ones. Network smart. Target your applications. The AI era is changing the game, but you can still win.",1,1754905344.0,AIResumeMaker,0,1.0,False

1mn8hvd,https://youtu.be/e2JUhcly9Pk,Selling Gift Baskets Online That Outrank and Outsell Competitors,"# Introduction: Competing with the Big Players from Day One

If you’ve just launched your online gift basket business, you’re stepping into a market with well-established players who seem to have everything—fancy websites, large budgets, and loyal customers. But here’s the twist: **you don’t have to wait years to catch up**. In fact, with the right launch strategy, you can outrank them in search results and outsell them where it matters most—conversion.

This guide is your beginner-friendly roadmap to claiming your spot in the market from day one. We’ll cover how to:

* Get seen before your competitors in Google search results
* Make customers choose you over similar sellers
* Build a loyal following without spending a fortune

# 1. Start with Keyword Gold, Not Guesswork

One of the fastest ways to outrank competitors is to target keywords they’ve overlooked.

# How to Find Them:

* Use free tools like [Ubersuggest]() or [Google Keyword Planner]()
* Look for **long-tail keywords** with low competition (e.g., “vegan chocolate holiday gift basket” instead of just “gift basket”)
* Check Etsy search autocomplete—if it pops up there, customers are searching for it.

**Pro Tip:** Aim for 5–10 main keywords for your store and sprinkle them naturally into product titles, descriptions, and even your image alt text.

# 2. Create Product Listings That Sell Themselves

Your competitors might have gorgeous products, but many drop the ball on their descriptions.

**Your listing should:**

* Start with a benefit-driven headline (“Luxury Spa Gift Basket – Relaxation in a Box”)
* Clearly state what’s inside
* Explain why it’s perfect for the buyer’s needs
* Use bullet points for easy scanning
* Include high-quality, lifestyle images

**Example:** Instead of “Includes a blanket and mug,” say, *“Cozy fleece blanket and ceramic mug—perfect for winter movie nights.”*

# 3. Make Your Brand Impossible to Forget

Big competitors often feel generic. As a new seller, you can win by being **personal, memorable, and relatable**.

* Choose a consistent brand voice—fun, elegant, eco-friendly, or artisanal
* Create a memorable logo and color scheme
* Use personalized touches like handwritten thank-you notes or branded stickers

When customers feel connected to your brand story, they’ll choose you even if your prices match competitors.

# 4. Use Content Marketing as Your Secret Weapon

Most gift basket sellers skip blogging—but Google loves fresh, helpful content.

**Blog Ideas That Drive Sales:**

* “10 Unique Holiday Gift Basket Ideas for 2025”
* “How to Choose the Perfect Corporate Gift Basket”
* “DIY vs. Buying: Why Curated Baskets Save Time”

Each blog can link back to your products and help you rank for more keywords your competitors are ignoring.

# 5. Optimize Your Images for Search & Sales

Search engines can’t “see” your images—they rely on file names and alt text.

* Rename your image files before uploading (e.g., “gourmet-chocolate-gift-basket.jpg”)
* Add descriptive alt text: *“Luxury holiday gift basket with wine, cheese, and chocolates”*
* Use bright, natural light for photos and show your product in a real setting (coffee table, kitchen, office desk)

# 6. Price to Compete—Without Sacrificing Profit

Competing on price alone is a race to the bottom. Instead, focus on **perceived value**.

Example:

* Competitor sells a $50 basket with 5 items
* You sell a $55 basket with 5 items *plus* free gift wrapping and a personalized card

People will happily pay more if they feel they’re getting more.

# 7. Build Social Proof Early & Aggressively

Nothing outsells happy customer reviews.

* Offer early customers a small discount in exchange for leaving a review
* Share every positive review on your website and social media
* Create a hashtag for customers to share their unboxing photos

**Stat:** Products with at least 5 reviews are **270% more likely to sell** than those without any.

# 8. Leverage Social Media Like a Pro

Big sellers often stick to boring product shots. You can win attention by creating engaging content:

* Behind-the-scenes basket assembly
* Quick unboxing videos
* Seasonal product teasers
* Polls asking followers which basket design they prefer

Instagram Reels and TikTok videos get massive organic reach right now—use them.

# 9. Offer Fast, Hassle-Free Shipping

Many new sellers lose sales because their shipping times are vague or slow.

* Be upfront about shipping times
* Offer flat-rate or free shipping thresholds
* Use attractive, sturdy packaging so baskets arrive Instagram-ready

# 10. Track, Tweak, and Outsmart Your Competition

* Monitor competitors’ prices, keywords, and promotions using tools like [Everbee]() for Etsy
* Test different product photos, descriptions, and price points to see what works best
* Stay updated on seasonal trends and plan your marketing calendar ahead of time

# Quick Launch Checklist for Outranking & Outselling

✅ Research long-tail keywords  
✅ Create irresistible product listings  
✅ Build a unique, memorable brand  
✅ Start a blog for organic traffic  
✅ Optimize product images  
✅ Price for value, not just cost  
✅ Collect reviews early  
✅ Be active on social media  
✅ Offer great shipping options  
✅ Continuously analyze and improve

# Final Word

Selling gift baskets online in a crowded market doesn’t have to mean playing catch-up. By focusing on smart SEO, unique branding, and an authentic customer connection from the very start, you can position yourself as the **go-to choice** in your niche—outranking competitors in search results and outselling them where it counts.

Remember: you’re not just selling products; you’re selling the convenience, joy, and emotion that comes with the perfect gift. That’s your competitive advantage—use it.

**FAQ**

**Q1: How soon can I outrank established competitors?**  
With the right keywords and consistent content marketing, some sellers see improvements in 3–6 months.

**Q2: Is SEO really necessary for gift basket sales?**  
Absolutely. If customers can’t find you online, they can’t buy from you—SEO is your visibility engine.

**Q3: Can I succeed without a huge marketing budget?**  
Yes! Many of the strategies above—social media engagement, blogging, and review collection—cost little to nothing but have a big impact.",1,1754905064.0,u_businessnewstv,0,1.0,False

“I am sorry... It is meant to determine *what*?” Carbon stopped yanking on the chunk of instrument panel she had unscrewed from the frame and looked back at Alex, who was explaining what Amalu had told him last evening. 

He had waited for a bit of confirmation on exactly what the fuck the marines had been doing before talking about it with Carbon because... Well, it had some connotations and he wanted to have what Williams could wring out of her team on hand before any supposition started flying. “If it’s ethical to have sex with another ‘non-human’ entity. It’s kind of funny though, they were using it to insult each other - basically going around arguing none of the others could pass it themselves.”

Every now and then Carbon would look at him in a very particular way when he brought up things Humans did that were far outside of her life experiences, a mix of mortified and aghast. That’s what she was doing right now. “Did... it is only four questions, correct? How could - Well. Insults. I understand, enough.”

“I’m assuming they all passed. Couldn’t get sent here without passing them.” It stood to reason, anyway. They’d have to be old enough and capable of communication to even join the military. “Just not for that purpose.”

“Yes, it is so.” She finished pulling the monitor free and handed it back to Alex, peering into the darkness behind the console with a flashlight. She hummed once and then started unscrewing the next monitor over.

“So you just want me to hold on to these?” That was kind of what it felt like he had the room to do right now. Sure, with the seats pushed back there was room for two in the front, particularly with one being about 75% of human size, but then you started crawling around in there and she was basically already at the middle of the instrument panel.

“There should be a pad and paper in the tool bag. Just label each part and set it aside. That was the left Primary Flight Display.” She did not look up from her work to say that.

Alex found a pad of post-it notes and a pen crammed into a side pocket of the tool bag. “Port.”

Carbon shook her head. “I do not believe there are any cargo handling systems onboard.”

“No, it’s the port side on a ship. Left is.” Hell, had he been saying that without them understanding him so far? He was sure that they had said port and starboard several times - maybe his Immersion Translator had been translating with context clues? Could it do that? “You know, when you’re facing forward.”

Carbon glanced over her shoulder at him, eyes crinkled with amusement and a little smirk on the corner of her mouth.

He stared back at her as he peeled the note off the stack and slapped it onto the PFD. She had just put one over on him. A little joke, and it was comprehensible.

Alex had never been more proud. “Ah-hah. Nice.”

“Thank you.” She pulled the screen out and handed it back to him. “Port Navigation.”

“Port Navigation.” He echoed back as he wrote the next note. “Been working on your repertoire?""

“Perhaps? Having the opportunity to view a wide variety of Humans interaction with each other while not being...” She stopped talking, craning her neck to look into the area behind the instrument cluster once more. Humming again. Carbon picked up a Human-made set of Augmented Reality goggles and held them up to her face, double checking the wiring schematics. “While not drowning myself in work, is giving me a better understanding of Humanity in general.”

Alex recognized that she had stopped herself from saying something in particular there. What, precisely, he wasn’t sure - and with the door open and Linda Zheng in the Hanger as well, he wasn’t going to ask. That felt a bit too personal. Tonight, instead.

He glanced out the window to check on Zheng. She was still over by the Falcata’s, tapping away at a tablet and using the scanner drones to verify the grav cycles were also shipshape. “I’m glad to hear that. You seem pretty happy working on all this stuff out here.”

Wherever here actually was.

“I am surprised to find that I am, yes. The work may not be as rewarding as some other things I have done in the past, but we are working towards a larger goal.” She moved her attention to the Flight Management Display, almost directly below where the Navigation screen had been.

It was weird to be talking to her like they were just coworkers. Not that he would have talked to any of the other people on the expedition like this, exactly, but it still felt a little distant. Not quite like how they had talked when they had returned to McFadden station. More like how they had communicated back on the *Kshlav’o* before he had kissed her.

At least he was falling back to a reasonable part of their relationship to emulate. Mostly. “That’s good. I can’t wait to find out what’s up with these controls and get back in the sky, even if this might not have the range we need to go anywhere useful.”

“Do not get too excited yet. The scans found a few nose ribs with what I feel are an unacceptable amount of stress microfractures, though they appear to be within spec for the part. I suspect the wing was bumped at some point in time during production or shipping.” She had the FMD off already, handing it back to him. “Port Flight Display.”

“Seriously? They dropped it? Taking a star off the review for that.” Alex dutifully filed this third screen away with a fresh sticky note slapped down on the glass.

Their conversation was ended by the sound of someone approaching the Corvin. Zheng, as a quick check verified. She came about halfway up the steps, again, apparently unwilling to ever come all the way inside the ship. “Hey, guys. Sorenson. Could I borrow the Lan for a minute? I’ve got something weird I’d like a second set of eyes on.”

“Oh, sure. Feel free.” It was going to be days before this was fixed anyway, so what was a quick break?

Carbon had been using the AR goggles again. She stuffed them into a pocket and slipped back around the Pilot’s seat. “Of course, Linda. What’s up?”

Oh, sure. *She* got to be on a first name basis and even got contractions worked into his wife’s speech patterns. Alex bit his tongue, literally. He would not be getting mad over Carbon doing a good job with their cover. Maybe a little hurt. Just a little.

He was the only one Carbon called Pilot, at least.

Zheng finally stepped all the way into the shuttle, holding her tablet up so both of them could see. “So, I was looking at the scans on the engines, right? I’m running them both at the same time because I’ve got enough drones, and immediately I notice this has the Type 1 fuel mix chamber. They’re visually different, it’s a solid 5cm taller.”

Carbon nodded at her, just as lost as Alex looked. Neither of them fully understood what they were looking at. “And this is incorrect?”

“Yes, very. I was part of the team overseeing the retrofit of the last several hundred Falcatas to the J spec. They should not be here, particularly not on these. They’re both H variants, which came *from factory* with the Type 2.” Zheng was emphatic about this being... incorrect. The most intense Alex had seen her, not that they’d been working together very long.

Alex looked to Carbon, eyebrows raised. “I’m going to bow out here, this is past my pay grade.”

“So these were downgraded? Is there any particular reason that might have chosen to do so?” Carbon was also grasping at straws, for the moment.

“They shouldn’t have been able to, my team fully phased out the Type 1. I had heard all parts specific to it were retired from stores, the files for printers deprecated. The 2 was better in every metric. But here it is, with the wrong number of injectors.” She flipped to a different page, this scan viewed from the front. “You can see there’s an array of eight here, which is standard on the Type 2, but it should only have four. There’s only four inlets. Somebody slapped the injector ring from the 2 onto it and mounted extra parts.”

“Are they more injectors?” Carbon asked, a little cautious now that Zheng seemed to be jumping the gun here.

“Ah, no they appear to be power cells in a shell that makes them look like the injectors.” Zheng shifted the view on the scan, four of the eight cylinders glowing. “I thought it was maybe some kind of power enhancement, but they’re not wired to anything. They’re just hidden in the engine.”

“Any idea how big those are?” Alex wasn’t that familiar with scanning small stuff. He was a big picture guy. Stars and planets.

Zheng turned the tablet back to herself, zooming in a few times and shifting through the scan types. “I think they’re actually the same unit that powers the e-suits.”

Alex did not look at Carbon, though he was alarmed enough to do so. He did not blurt out anything related to the extra items that had come through in the shipment the other day. He kept a nice, confused look on his face. “Huh.”

“That actually sounds quite unsafe. We should see about removing them for now. Likely it would be best to store them in the secure cage. Would you show me the scan of the container they are hidden in?” Carbon asked as she handed Alex the AR headset she had been wearing and ushered Zheng back out of the Corvin.

Alex got the indication that he should continue working on the controls problem, while she went to deal with the mystery power cells.

So he did. The AR goggles were pretty neat, and he took it slow so as to not damage anything further. Alex had ripped most of the console apart before the goggles flagged a plug on the wiring harness that ran into the primary control conduit as being wrong. It was the right shape, but a centimeter too long. The gob of amber impact resin on the top of the bundle of wires was also flagged as potential damage.

It didn’t look damaged, but he pulled the cable anyway. There were a few IC’s hidden inside the resin, wires running into the plug. He labeled it and put it in the stack of parts, and made note of which one it was so it could be inspected later.

Just to cover his tracks, he pulled a few more cables, too. None of them looked strange, but at this point it was paranoia time, all the time, so he had no idea what ‘enough’ would be like in this situation.

Carbon looking a little more worried as she popped back into the Corvin for more tools was a pretty good place to stop, though. He followed her out, a bit curious as to how they were doing, anyway. The cowling was off one of the Falcata’s, heat shielding stripped off and set aside, the grav cycle looking more like it was being operated on than being investigated. “So what’s the verdict?”

“We are about to find out.” Carbon used the spanner she had collected from the shuttle to unscrew one of the fake injectors, the top coming off after a few rotations and clattering onto the floor. She carefully pulled it free. “It is a perfectly normal looking power cell.”

Zheng leaned over her, head tilted to the side. “Oh, a RGM-3. That’s not the unit in our e-suits.”

That was good, a little tension out of them moment.

Zheng then finished her statement. “That cell is used in sub-two ton powered armor and shipboard point defense weapons.”

“That sounds dangerous.” Alex exhaled slowly, watching Carbon move on to the next fake injector. “Maybe we should send them back through the portal, or put them in the lake.”

“No, they’re perfectly safe. If they were dangerous they wouldn’t put them in suits.” Linda Zheng did not get what he was talking about, and that was fine.

“Ok. Well.” Before I say anything I’m not supposed to, “I’m going to go back to working on the controls. Pretty close to having the whole thing emptied out. Hate to think I’m gonna have to pull the primary conduit.”

Alex mostly just sat in the back of the *Hokule’a* and drank a coffee from the little dispenser by the head. It needed calibration too, but it was close. Then he spent way too much time thinking about how much he was not enthused about any of this and how much he’d like to just cut his ties with this disaster and step away... But he knew Carbon wouldn’t. She saw a way to save her people here. The other Tsla’o would still be here, as would all his fellow Humans who probably didn’t have any idea what was going on in secret, either.

This culminated in him grabbing a pair of cutters and snipping the entire plug off the cable, resin encased chips included, and pocketing it. It was spiteful. Probably not stupid, given that he’d already unplugged the cable. He’d give it to Carbon tonight.


But now, it was lunch time. Almost. Sitting around and sulking about all this suspicious shit in his shuttle and hangar was not helping him. He needed to clear his mind for a minute, and what better way than food?

“I’m gonna hit the mess, do you two want me to bring anything back up?” He inquired as he pulled his jacket on, Carbon still working on the first engine.

“I don’t know. I’ll figure it out later. Thanks though.” Zheng waved him off.

Easy enough. “Lan?”

“Could you see if there are any of the beef frankfurter meals left?” She extracted the fourth cell from the engine and dropped it into a parts tray with the rest of them, then looked at him over the top of the seat. “If they are not available, message me and I can order something from here.”

“Uh, yeah, will do.” He briefly wondered how she could do that, but probably had elevated credentials with the mess. More responsibility, less chance she’d order a meal and then just forget about it, or do something stupid like flood the queue.

The cold air and quiet helped almost immediately, too. Alex didn’t want to stroll on down to the mess with the wind chill biting his face. He hustled, and walked into a mildly chaotic scene. 

A couple of the marines were laughing. Crenshaw was red-faced and stammering out an apology that Alex only caught about half of. Very generic ‘I didn’t know!” sort of stuff.

They were all sitting at the same table as Sergeant Zenshen, who looked very amused at whatever had happened. “Oh no, my fuckin’ heart is going to explode or something!” She said as she crammed two chocolate donuts into her mouth at the same time. “Somebody think of the children!”

just even thinking of the texture of scrambled eggs just makes me wanna throw up, i can’t even look at eggs being beaten knowing it’ll be cooked in a pan it just makes me so sick and what’s worse is i’m usually cooking eggs with my mom at this volunteer breakfast thingy and i always have to get everything and the bacon and sausage end up being really salty or chewy or too crunchy snd just gross and greasy and the eggs; which come from cartons; always make me gag and i end up downing too much orange juice and or coffee to get the texture and flavor out of my mouth so i feel horrible the entire day afterwards. i don’t have anything bad to say abt the pancakes, even without my mom cooking them (even tho she always does), it’s literally just box pancake mix and it just ends up being good anyways

with warm spaghettios, i just don’t like how they feel overcooked and undercooked at the same time, i have to eat it hot or cold, never warm or i feel sick

and the sweater… a family friend of my dad’s gave us two sweaters, a red chunky knit sweater and a navy blue sweater with some tinsel in it, and i just can’t wear it without a long sleeve shirt underneath or it feels like bugs are on my skin crawling and chewing it up bc the tinsel makes it sooo itchy and it’s dyed wool yarn so it’s so much worse, even tho the red one is too, it’s just a lot less itchy bc it has (i think) faux fur inside so it’s very warm and cozy. my least fav thing abt the navy blue sweater is that i feel bad for not wearing it bc it was a gift

Other than an internship i have yet to get enough hours for (old internship dropped their design dept so only got 80 hours there) im done with college (i cannot find another internship for the life of me)

Scared to post bcs ik im abt to get cooked for this but im wondering if i should bother? this is my best work so im afraid of it not being good enough. a lot of blank spaces bcs im not finished yet. 

the background looks pink but its meant to be an off white so thats going to change. its not supposed to be pink. i meant it to be more burnt orange if anything for the text and whatnot. 

Im wondering if i should bother? i dont think im good enough at this. ive been told as much time and time again. Should i even bother atp or should i just start looking into other, careers?

 im afraid im just gonna be wasting my time building a portfolio that doesnt look good enough to do anything with and im doing the absolute best I can do. If this is the best i can do, Im wondering if im not cut out for this. I dont care about building my confidence, i just want to be employed. 

I dont care what industry. I just wanted it to be varied enough to apply to several places and not limit myself bcs job hunting is already hard enough without limiting where i can apply more.

im aware my work isnt good but im wondering if im at the point where i should look into other options since im done with college and my skills still arent up to par. I can handle sucking at design, but i need work. 

Im aware this is gonna make ppl mad. I am just absolutely terrified right now. Im afraid I messed up and now I have nowhere left to go since idk what other career path to even take or how to pay off the student loans from whatever other path. I want to stick with design only because its too expensive to go back to college. I just want a stable job atp. I lost my passion for design. ",0,1754904653.0,graphic_design,22,0.4,False

But here’s some things about her I’ve noticed

Dry texting : IRL she’s bubbly and talkative, but over text she just kinda gives one-word answers and never keeps the convo going. When I teased her about it, she said she’s “just not a good texter.”

Zero initiation : She’s receptive on dates, but never flirts first, makes physical contact, or suggests plans. Says she “doesn’t know how to chase guys” and just prefers to sit back.

Drives herself everywhere : Turned down my offers to pick her up (even on the first date). On date two, I only drove her to the bar from the coffee place cuz her car is parked quite far away, then dropped her back to her car after our chill session at the beach. Every other girl I’ve dated liked being picked up, so this threw me off. Maybe I’m just overthinking it?

# Best Gable Table Legs 2025: Reviews & Buying Guide

Gable table legs are a distinctive and stylish choice for anyone looking to add a touch of elegance and character to their furniture.These legs, characterized by their sloping, A-frame design, offer both aesthetic appeal and structural stability. Choosing the right gable table legs can considerably enhance the visual impact and functionality of your table, transforming ordinary furniture into a statement piece.

This guide provides a thorough overview of the best gable table legs available in 2025, covering their key features, benefits, ideal user profiles, and comparisons with competitors. Whether you’re a DIY enthusiast, a professional furniture maker, or simply looking to upgrade your home décor, this article will equip you with the knowledge you need to make an informed decision.

## Key Features Analysis

gable table legs are available in a variety of materials, sizes, and styles. understanding the key features will enable you to select the perfect legs to complement your tabletop and overall design aesthetic.

**Material:** The material of gable table legs greatly impacts their durability, appearance, and cost. Common materials include wood, metal, and combinations thereof.

Wood gable table legs are prized for their natural beauty and warm aesthetic. Options include hardwoods like oak,maple,and walnut,each offering distinct grain patterns and color variations. Softwoods like pine can also be used,typically at a lower cost,but they may require additional finishing and are generally less durable. Metal gable table legs, often made from steel or iron, offer a sleek, modern look and exceptional strength. These legs are commonly powder-coated for enhanced durability and corrosion resistance. Some designs incorporate both wood and metal elements, creating a visually striking and structurally sound hybrid.

**Dimensions:** The dimensions of gable table legs – height,width,and angle – are crucial for determining the overall stability and proportions of the table.

Height is the most important dimensional factor, dictating the table's overall height. Standard table heights vary depending on the intended use, such as dining tables (28-30 inches), coffee tables (16-18 inches), and side tables (20-24 inches). Width affects the table's stability; wider legs generally provide greater support, particularly for larger tabletops. the angle of the gable also influences the stability and aesthetic; steeper angles offer a more dramatic look but may reduce stability, while shallower angles provide a more subtle appearance and enhanced stability.

**Finish:** The finish applied to gable table legs protects the material, enhances its appearance, and allows for customization to match existing decor.

Wood legs can be finished with a variety of stains, paints, and clear coats. Stains highlight the natural grain of the wood, while paints offer a wider range of color options. Clear coats, such as polyurethane or lacquer, provide protection against scratches and moisture. Metal legs are typically powder-coated, a process that applies a durable, even layer of paint. Powder coating offers excellent resistance to chipping, scratching, and corrosion, and it is available in a wide range of colors and finishes, including matte, gloss, and textured options.**Weight Capacity:** Weight capacity is a critical consideration, especially for larger tables or those intended to support heavy items.

The weight capacity of gable table legs depends on the material,dimensions,and construction quality. Metal legs generally have a higher weight capacity than wood legs of similar size. The manufacturer's specifications should always be consulted to ensure that the legs can safely support the intended load. Exceeding the weight capacity can lead to instability or even structural failure,so it is essential to choose legs that are adequately rated for the table's intended use. Reinforced designs with additional support can increase the weight capacity of gable style legs.

## Core Benefits

The benefits of using gable table legs extend beyond their aesthetic appeal. These legs offer a combination of style, stability, and customization options that make them a popular choice for various furniture projects.

**Enhanced Stability:** The gable design inherently provides excellent stability due to its wide base and triangular structure. This ensures that the table remains steady, even under heavy loads or on uneven surfaces.

The wide base of gable table legs distributes weight evenly, minimizing the risk of wobbling or tipping. The triangular shape adds rigidity and resistance to lateral forces, making the table more stable than designs with straight legs. This is particularly beneficial for larger tables or those used in high-traffic areas where stability is paramount. This design feature also makes these legs good for outdoor patio furniture.

**Unique Aesthetic Appeal:** Gable legs offer a distinctive and stylish look that can elevate the visual appeal of any table.Their A-frame design adds a touch of modern elegance and architectural interest to furniture.

Unlike conventional straight legs, gable legs create a focal point with their geometric shape. This unique design can complement a variety of decor styles, from modern minimalist to rustic farmhouse. The angled lines of the legs add depth and dimension to the table, making it a standout piece in any room.

**Customization Options:** gable table legs are available in a wide range of materials, sizes, finishes, and designs, allowing for extensive customization to match specific aesthetic preferences and functional requirements.

Users can choose from different wood species,metal types,and combinations thereof to create a unique look. The legs can be stained,painted,or powder-coated in a variety of colors and finishes to complement the tabletop and existing decor. The height, width, and angle of the legs can also be customized to achieve the desired proportions and stability. Combining these customization options turns any table into a statement piece.

## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about gable table legs, addressing common concerns and providing helpful information.

**What is the best material for gable table legs?**

The best material depends on the desired aesthetic, budget, and intended use of the table. Wood legs offer a warm, natural look and are suitable for a variety of styles, while metal legs provide a sleek, modern appearance and greater durability. wood is better for painted application to match a room finish, while metal provides a sturdy base for heavier tables. Ultimately, selecting material should be based on desired visual impression and practicality.

**How do I determine the correct height for gable table legs?**

The correct height depends on the intended use of the table. Dining tables typically require legs that are 28-30 inches tall, while coffee tables need legs that are usually 16-18 inches tall. Always consider the thickness of the tabletop when calculating the overall height of the table. Ensure that the legs provide adequate clearance for chairs or othre furniture that will be used with the table.

**How do I attach gable table legs to a tabletop?**

Gable table legs can be attached to a tabletop using a variety of methods, including screws, bolts, and metal plates. The specific method will depend on the design of the legs and the material of the tabletop. Metal plates provide a secure attachment point for most materials, or use a power drill to set pilot holes for screws. Always use appropriate fasteners and ensure that the legs are securely attached to prevent wobbling or instability.

We were asking each other questions, she asked about my prev relationship and i literally told her about my whole past, we were also joking around and stuff. She told me she is looking for someone who will put in efforts to get to know her and that i should be more focused on that, i agreed. I asked her out for a coffee to do the same but she said that we should first talk on calls get to know each others past and future plans then discuss about us during our coffee date which sounded very convincing, we kinda clicked over the call (thats what i think) i like how she was very vocal about what she wants and was also calling me out for being very shy and nervous. I told her sure we will talk and all i dont mind putting in efforts at all as she is my type but the next day after texting her i wasnt getting any replies so after 2-3 texts i messaged her saying if you wanna ghost me just let me know because i dont wanna be waiting around for your reply or build false hope to which she immediately replied by saying i was busy i am sorry and all then i asked her if she is free for a call she replied in a bit so i said ok drop me a text i will call you so i was awake way past my bed time waiting for her to reply, i finally gave up and went to sleep and my message is still on delivered.

1mn89t8,https://i.redd.it/c8rus1f4zcif1.png,Just Got Back From an Epic Patagonia Road Trip - This Place is Absolutely Unreal!,"Holy wow, just returned from Patagonia and I'm still processing how incredible this place is! Had to share because this region seriously exceeded every expectation I had.

**The Journey:**

Spent the last week driving through some of the most breathtaking landscapes I've ever seen in my life. Every single turn revealed something more spectacular than the last - those dramatic peaks, endless skies, and that raw, untamed beauty that photos just can't capture properly.

The roads themselves are an adventure! Sometimes challenging, always rewarding. You'll find yourself stopping every few kilometers just because the views are too insane not to photograph. The scale of everything is just mind-blowing - makes you feel so small but in the best possible way.

**What Made It Special:**

* The way the light changes throughout the day is pure magic
* Those famous Patagonian winds that you hear about? Yeah, they're real and wild!
* The sense of being completely disconnected from everything - so peaceful
* Meeting fellow travelers from all over the world on similar adventures
* That feeling of true wilderness that's so rare to find these days

Every spot we stopped at had its own character and beauty. Some places left me speechless, others had me grinning like an idiot. The whole experience was just... *chef's kiss* perfect.

**DM me if you want the detailed route map with all our stops!** Happy to share the exact path we took and some insider tips for anyone planning their own Patagonia adventure!

**Comment to post with photo:**

This route took us 8 days total, flying into Buenos Aires then driving 12+ hours south to El Calafate as our starting point. Weather was classic Patagonia - started sunny and 15°C in the morning, then hit us with 60mph winds and sudden rain by afternoon! Had to pull over twice because of the wind strength. The unpredictability is part of the charm though. Getting there was an adventure itself - the remote locations mean you really need to plan fuel stops and weather windows carefully. Would I go back? Already planning the next trip for Chilean side! The landscapes are so diverse that one trip barely scratches the surface. This specific day captured in the photo was near Torres del Paine - absolutely magical golden hour lighting that made the entire drive worth it. 10/10 would recommend to anyone who loves raw, untouched nature!",4,1754904193.0,backpacking,2,1.0,False

And here’s the honest bit: most “local SEO tips” you find online are either recycled from 2012 or so broad you could swap “plumber” for “dog groomer” and not notice.

This isn’t that.  
This is the shortlist of moves that actually make the phone ring. (Yes, I track it. Yes, even on weekends.)

# 1. Hyper-Local Landing Pages > Generic Service Pages

Skip the generic “Plumbing Services” page.  
Make it:

/plumbing-denver-co/  
/plumbing-lakewood-co/

Each one should talk about *that* neighborhood, use photos from *that* area, and include 2–3 testimonials that literally say the location name.  
It’s boring work,  I know, I’ve stared at Lakewood job photos until my coffee went cold — but it prints leads. Every. Single. Time.  
Also, pro tip: resist the urge to “just copy-paste and swap the city name.” Google notices. People notice, too.

# 2. Build Your GBP to Rank for More Than Your Main Keyword

Most folks pick “Plumber” in their Google Business Profile and stop there.  
That’s like ordering a burger and forgetting fries exist. Or a milkshake, for that matter.

Add secondary categories and service lists so Google has more reasons to show you.  
Example: A landscaping company can also list:

* Gardener (yes, even if you mostly do patios, it still gets clicks)
* Tree Service
* Snow Removal Service, winter jobs can keep you afloat when no one’s thinking about lawns

I’ve seen this multiply impressions by four, literally overnight. Okay, maybe a week. but still.

# 3. Own Local “Entity” Signals

Think of Google as an AI gossiping with itself it connects facts, patterns, names.  
If it “knows” you’re woven into a city’s daily life, you rank easier.

Do this:

* Get listed in niche directories (skip the “everyone’s on it” ones go for trade-specific)
* Get your business name on local blogs, news sites, or event pages even without links. Unlinked mentions still count, and Google loves them.
* Sponsor one small local event. I had a client sponsor a high school chili cook-off they walked away with press mentions, backlinks, and two new customers they met while waiting in the chili line. I’m not saying chili is an SEO strategy, but… maybe it is.

# 4. Use GMB Posts Like a Social Feed

Weekly posting on Google Business Profile is absurdly underrated.  
Treat it like Instagram, just with fewer filters:

* Before/after project photos
* Quick “how-to” tips (“How to unclog a sink without a wrench”) short enough to read on a coffee break
* Seasonal offers (before snow hits, before the heat wave urgency works)

One client doubled their call volume just from posting consistently. That’s it. Didn’t touch their site.

# 5. The “Local FAQ Trap”

Most small biz blogs? Honestly useless.  
They chase broad topics like “How to choose a plumber,” which is code for “You’ll never rank here.”

Instead, aim for local-specific FAQs:

* “Cost to Replace a Water Heater in Denver 2025” (yes, put the year it’s a click magnet)
* “Do You Need a Permit to Build a Fence in Austin?”

These are low competition, high buying intent. And sometimes they rank in days. Not months. Sometimes before the coffee’s even cold.

# 6. Track Leads, Not Just Traffic

I’ve seen people stare at traffic graphs like they’re tracking Bitcoin.  
Stop.

Install call tracking and form tracking.  
If your new “Fence Repair in Austin” page isn’t bringing in calls? Scrap it. Try another angle. There’s no glory in a page that ranks but never earns.

**The Boil-Down:**

Here’s the thing.  
If I could only do two moves for the next three months, it’d be:

1. Hyper-local landing pages with proof you’ve actually worked there (photos, testimonials, the whole bit)
2. An over-optimized Google Business Profile with secondary categories and weekly posts (and don’t skip weeks, momentum matters)

I'm Nick, I live in the East of England. I left home at 18 for uni and just never went back (except to visit), and that means I've lived in a few different places over the years. Holding down friends is tough as an adult, I find. What about those I met at school? I left them all behind as they got into drugs and they seemed to care more about them than me. I was always the odd one out who drank but never did anything else. I still wanted to play football everyday while they passed a joint around (or often worse).

I love coffee, rum, good food, daydreaming, deep conversations, British bands and underground music. My interests include football, cricket, reading, writing (plus the stationery that goes along with it), journalling, mental health and psychology.

I love people who are calm-natured and are on the more affectionate side. I just like people who are naturally caring and warm towards those they care about. I am also a little cheeky here and there, and I like to make people laugh!

1mn87by,https://i.redd.it/e9oqbm38ycif1.png,Just Got Back From an Epic Patagonia Road Trip - This Place is Absolutely Unreal!,"Holy wow, just returned from Patagonia and I'm still processing how incredible this place is! Had to share because this region seriously exceeded every expectation I had.

**The Journey:**

Spent the last week driving through some of the most breathtaking landscapes I've ever seen in my life. Every single turn revealed something more spectacular than the last - those dramatic peaks, endless skies, and that raw, untamed beauty that photos just can't capture properly.

The roads themselves are an adventure! Sometimes challenging, always rewarding. You'll find yourself stopping every few kilometers just because the views are too insane not to photograph. The scale of everything is just mind-blowing - makes you feel so small but in the best possible way.

**What Made It Special:**

* The way the light changes throughout the day is pure magic
* Those famous Patagonian winds that you hear about? Yeah, they're real and wild!
* The sense of being completely disconnected from everything - so peaceful
* Meeting fellow travelers from all over the world on similar adventures
* That feeling of true wilderness that's so rare to find these days

Every spot we stopped at had its own character and beauty. Some places left me speechless, others had me grinning like an idiot. The whole experience was just... *chef's kiss* perfect.

**For Anyone Considering It:**

Do it. Seriously, just do it. It's one of those trips that changes your perspective on what natural beauty can look like. The planning and logistics are totally worth it for the payoff.

The weather can be unpredictable, the distances are massive, and sometimes the roads test your patience - but that's all part of what makes it so incredible and memorable.

**DM me if you want the detailed route map with all our stops!** Happy to share the exact path we took and some insider tips for anyone planning their own Patagonia adventure!

But then realised no internet, in a dip so no cell coverage, the previous tenant had a dog and one of the rooms stinks of dog p\*\*s.  Place smells funny. Rental, so can't just fix stuff that needs fixing. I mean, it's actually a nice apartment, but it's not home. I have AuDHD so already find transitions mad difficult. Kids rang me in tears because mum was being mean, but really they just needed somewhere to put the grief they don't have a word for.

I went from 'okay' to 'mental breakdown' in about 30 mins flat. String of texts to ex telling her I wasn't leaving the house (it's shared ownership). Coming back. Fuck you, I'll fight you for the house and all of that nonsense. Got half way home, then saw better sense, thank god, and turned myself around before I fucked things up. Downed a bottle of wine. Spent the next two hours answering texts from v concerned relatives who had me on watch, which actually turned into some lovely supportive conversations. Woke up thanking my stars that I was old enough now to drown my sorrows with a nice Sauvignon Blanc and a full tub of Cookies n Cream, rather than a bottle of the strong stuff. 

But it was totally and utterly undignified. I don't think I've ever felt so completely broken in my life. Embarrassed at myself, wondering where the competent, grown up man has gone, and where this little kid came from.

And it's not like I'm in denial anymore. I can totally see that the marriage was on it's last legs for ages. I can totally see the benefits of us co-parenting separately, because already I'm a better dad. I am a more mentally healthy person when I'm not around my ex.  I woke up this morning without the kids shouting at me or each other, had a coffee, watched the news, left for work early.

I'm sorry for the language - but fuck me, the sense of dislocation is real. Walking to the train this morning for work, looking up the road towards the part of town where our house is, where the kids are... going past my usual platform on the train... the kids having fun and forgetting to facetime to say good morning (a good thing really because it means they're okay)... it's like having multiple limbs chopped off. There's this constant sense that at some point we're gonna say sorry to each other and all this will go down as 'that time things got crazy', which I know is my head playing tricks on me.

Korean local here wanting to share one of my favorite neighborhoods that's become a beloved spot for both locals and expats. If you're looking for that authentic ""romantic Korea"" vibe away from the tourist crowds, Haebangchon is your answer!

This charming hillside district near Namsan has this magical blend of old Seoul charm and international flair. Originally a settlement for Korean War refugees, it's now a thriving multicultural community where you'll hear multiple languages and discover hidden gems around every corner.

**Perfect Summer Indoor Route (because it's HOT out there!):**

**☕ Upstanding Coffee** Hidden gem in Sinheung Market with the most stunning spiral staircase architecture. This 3-story converted market space has that raw concrete aesthetic that Korea does so well. The owner trained in Melbourne/Auckland, so the coffee is seriously next level. Try their ""magic"" coffee - it's a Melbourne thing that's perfect here!

**🍗 Haebangchon Dak** Same market, totally different vibe! This isn't your typical Korean fried chicken - it's slow-cooked for 1.5 hours with traditional ingredients like ginseng and jujube. Healthier, more flavorful, and comes with their famous leek kimchi. The AC is a blessing in summer!

**📸 Photo Spots** The market itself is incredibly photogenic - that perfect mix of old Korea meeting modern hipster culture. Great covered areas for photos without the heat!

**☕ Komfortabel Namsan** THE view cafe of Seoul! 4th floor panoramic windows overlooking the entire city. Wooden interiors, $2 million sound system (I'm not kidding), and famous strawberry cake. They do this amazing ""dimming time"" at 8:35pm where they turn off all lights for pure night view magic. Run by Korean fragrance brand Granhand, so it smells incredible too.

**🗼 Namsan Tower Finish** Short uphill walk for those sunset views that make Seoul so romantic!

**Why Foreigners (and Locals) Love This Area:**

* That authentic ""Korean drama"" hillside neighborhood feel
* International community vibe near Itaewon
* Amazing mix of traditional and modern Korea
* Way more chill than Hongdae/Myeongdong madness
* Perfect for that ""lived-in Seoul"" experience

**Getting There:** Line 6 to Noksapyeong Station (Exit 2), 10-min uphill walk to Sinheung Market.

This neighborhood perfectly captures what makes Korea special - the blend of history, community, and that unique Korean aesthetic that you can't find anywhere else in the world.

What I’m really looking for
Someone I can connect with on a deeper level.
Not just surface-level texting, but real conversations about our days, our dreams, our silly thoughts. A partner who’s kind, emotionally mature, and knows the value of effort in a relationship.

A little about me
* I enjoy working out, music, travel.
* Can get lost in a Netflix binge, and Stand up comedies.
* Love making people laugh, but also comfortable sitting in quiet moments and listening.
* Believer in kindness, loyalty, and communication.


Who I hope to meet
Someone between 23-27 who:
* Is warm, kind, and emotionally available
* Believes in building something real, not just “let’s see where this goes”
* Enjoys both fun adventures and chill nights in
* Can communicate openly and honestly
* Is okay with long-distance, initially

Other notes:
* I’m not into hookup culture — I’m looking for something meaningful.

It makes you wonder what the actual cost of this shift is. On one hand, it’s great that more people have access to higher-quality, more engaging goods. But are the original values of the ArtisanOdyssey - the focus on craftsmanship, ethical sourcing, and community support - being diluted in the process? Are we losing something essential when it scales up, even if it becomes more accessible?

For CA students and professionals in South Asia, LinkedIn can open doors to internships, clients, and even international opportunities. Recruiters now scan LinkedIn profiles before shortlisting candidates — sometimes before even reading a CV.

Here are 5 tips to make your LinkedIn stand out:

1. Professional Photo – Clear headshot, formal attire, friendly but confident expression.


2. Headline with Value – Instead of just “CA Student,” try: “CA Inter Student | Aspiring Audit & Tax Specialist | IFRS Learner”.


3. About Section – Write 3–4 impactful sentences summarizing your skills, experience, and goals.


4. Showcase Achievements – Add projects, certifications, and relevant coursework.


5. Engage & Connect – Post industry insights, comment on peers’ posts, and connect with professionals in your field.



Benefits:

Visibility to recruiters without even applying.

Building a professional brand over time.

Access to career tips, webinars, and job postings tailored to your profile.


Example:
A CA Inter student from Lahore shared a short post on LinkedIn about IFRS 16 changes. Within a week, a senior manager from a Big 4 firm commented, leading to a coffee meeting — and eventually, a job interview.

Bottom Line: If you’re not on LinkedIn, you’re missing out on opportunities that might never make it to job portals. Start building today — your future self will thank you!",1,1754902938.0,SouthAsiaAccountants,0,1.0,False

That includes coffee, energy drinks (white monster 🥲), English breakfast tea and green tea AND EVEN DARK CHOCOLATE (yes it contains caffeine). Here's what I found:

**Week 1:** So i found the first week actually quite easy. I realised in the morning you're completely fine stimulant free and i could even do ""cognitively difficult"" tasks (I'm currently revising for the GMAT so it hurts my brain 😅). The only problem was the AFTERNOON SLUMP, which is an absolute killer for my output

**Week 2:** This was by far the hardest week. I found myself waking up still feeling tired, it was like my body caught up from rest and needed a 2 week hibernation 😭. The afternoons... as expected... were still the hardest part. But i still pushed through

**Weeks 3&4:** I started to introduce NSDR (non-sleep deep rest) in the afternoon which was a game changer. Andrew huberman loves these and I can assure you IT WORKS. I was able to do this most days and it feels like a shot of espresso. My body has definitely adjusted quite a bit but i still sometimes get a bit groggy which caffeine would have fixed.

CONCLUSION: Am I going to keep this up? probably not. Even though I adjusted by the end, caffeine is a proven cognitive enhancer that helps with my output. HOWEVER, I know people like Matt walker and Huberman always go on about how it can disrupt your sleep by way more than you think so I will defo try and limit it in the afternoon.

P.S. Its also spurred me to want to create a herbal tea that is completely caffeine-free, but contains adaptogens that help with focus.

I actually spent my first year studying the same course in Bangalore, and now I’m back in Pune — and I’d love to meet someone who shares my passion for making games.

I’m looking for a female friend (or maybe something more if we click 💫) to share my creations, brainstorm storylines, exchange crazy ideas, and maybe even co-op both in-game and in life. Picture late-night chats about level design, testing each other’s projects, or discussing plot twists over coffee.

I’m more of a *“let’s sit in a cozy café or under a tree with our laptops and work on our dream projects”* kind of person than a *party all night* one. If you’re creative, love storytelling, or get excited about a new shader or a perfect game mechanic, I think we’ll get along amazingly.

Bonus points if you also love anime, exploring bookshops, and wandering around the city just to find the perfect snack spot. 🌸

I’m not a native speaker. I’m a 32 year old guy living in an apartment complex with a shared courtyard. A few months ago, this cat started hanging out on my patio. I thought he was a stray at first because he’d show up every morning while I drank my coffee, meowing at my door. I let him in once, gave him some pets, and that was it. From then on, he was here almost every day.

Eventually I found out from another neighbor that he actually belongs to this woman in 3B. She works a lot and lets him roam outside, so he’s basically free-range. I figured it was fine if he came by.

Here’s where things apparently got “criminal.” I started buying him toys. Then a scratching post. Then he got his own little bed in my living room. At one point, I even bought him a tag with my phone number on it in case he got lost. I didn’t change his name, still calls him Mr. Fluffles.

Last week, the woman in 3B knocked on my door and accused me of stealing her cat. I told her, “He comes here on his own.” She said I was being manipulative and compared it to “grooming a child into liking you more than their parents.” Which… what?? I told her, “You’re making it sound way creepier than it is. He’s a cat.”

She told me to stop feeding him and letting him in. I said fine, but then he started showing up looking all sad and pathetic. I caved after two days. What am I supposed to do, just close the door in his face?

Now she’s telling the whole building I’m a cat thief and a “homewrecker for pets.” My girlfriend says I should stop because it’s technically her cat. My best friend says if the cat wanted to be with her, he’d be with her.

Anyway, this morning he was waiting at my door again… but this time he had something in his mouth. I don’t even know what it is, but it’s definitely not mine. Which kind of makes me think he’s been visiting other people too.

So… AITA for letting this cat basically live in my apartment when he literally invites himself in every day like he pays rent?

EDIT:
Guys, I want to clear something up, I put the collar with my phone number on Mr. Fluffles before I even knew he belonged to someone.

Are people finding success wiht online versions, maybe location-based apps that curate temporary stores?

I'm thinking that community-maintained guides – maybe a shared Google Map or a regularly updated blog – would be the most reliable option.Anyone have experience contributing to one, or know of a particularly good resource that isn’t just regurgitating old information? I’m imagining finding everything from independent clothing designers doing limited runs to artisan coffee roasters experimenting with new blends.A good guide should point you beyond the usual chain stores pretending to be ""pop-up"" experiences!

We spent 14 days in and around Split this summer as we wanted to have a base from which to explore rather than hire a car/live out of our bags/have multiple accommodations for 2 weeks. Our air bnb flat was very comfy and had a kitchen/large balcony to hang out on so I believe it probably turned out cheaper in the long run. Also we LOVED Split. We're from London so we're used to hustle/bustle.

I just wanted to share our itinerary for anyone in their late 30s+ / non-parents out there who might also want to explore but take it a bit slower and isn't in Split for the nightlife :) 


Day 1 - arrived very late!

Day 2 - chilled in the morning and then had a food and history tour around Diocletian's Palace/ old town. It was expensive (about 100 euro I think through AirBnB) but it was 4 hours and we tried lots of local food/wine and learned a lot about the city.

Day 3 - hiked up Marjan Forest Park in the afternoon. Grabbed coffee at the viewpoint cafe at the top of the stairs (Tereca Vidilica). 
Then did a sunset tour to Klis fortress with Get Your Guide.

Day 4 - hopped on boat to Brač in the morning. Ate in Bol, headed to the beach, had a cocktail or 2 in the beach bars, headed back on 7pm ferry. Tickets are 20 euros each pp

Day 5 - walked to Bračvice beach and then came back for a sunset cruise on Polaris sailing boat with live band (this was great and the people were fun & a mix of ages - booked through Air BnB).

Day 6 - went to the gym & then chilled - it was 10 euros for a day pass at Marjan Fitness - very friendly for tourists.

Day 7 - Another hike up Marjan forest park in the pm (different route) followed by an aperol spritz at view point cafe before heading home.

Day 8- did a coach trip to Krka (Get Your Guide) and then were meant to stop off at Podstrana for beach time but couldn't get there due to roads (wear repellent, I got bitten 3 times with repellent on) . The group was generally very young (mostly 20s I'd say).

Day 9 - hired bikes to cycle to Kasjuni beach, came back via Marjan park route - it was a very difficult cycle uphill for the return trip!

Day 10 - brunch at Mokosh (lovely garden restaurant) and then did a speedboat tour to blue lagoon, Šolta island - Necujam Bay and then Trogir (Get Your Guide). This was a lot of fun! Everyone else was in their 20s again though!

Day 11 - spa day at the AC Marriott  (178Spa) was 30 euros each - you can go and use the pool, steam/sauna. Amazing view of Split, also did a work out at the empty gym first before relaxing pool side - was totally worth it. Dinner out at Soul which was nice vibes and lots of local wines on the menu.

Day 12 - visited Hvar for the day. Got the boat in the morning, walked up the fortress, wandered around Hvar town, went to Hula Hula Beach club, came back to Split in the evening. Boat was 25 euros for single trip pp

Day 13 -  Visited the archaeological museum in morning and then went to a lovely winery on outskirts of Split in the eve for wine tasting / taco evening at Jardin - the art of food and wine (ubered there). Cannot overstate how nice the wine is in Croatia and here! 

Day 14 - hiked Marjan forest park again (I was a bit obsessed) and went to Mokosh again for final dinner.",3,1754902275.0,CroatiaTravelTips,0,1.0,False

Honestly, I'm tired of hauling my ass down to the desert haha so when I saw OSL's amazing lineup I was excited to be reintroduced to the magic of music in GGP.

Overall vibes: initially I was concerned bc I know this festival trends younger, but honestly, I had amazing vibes and interactions the whole weekend! Maybe it was bc of the specific sets I went to, but mostly wherever I went people were dancing, respectful of others, engaged with the performance and not yapping (huge shocker, I loathe yapping and was prepared to be pissed off about it lol but luckily didn't happen!). So THANK YOU if you contributed to positive vibes of this fest!!!

Fav sets (only counting the sets that I saw the majority of)

* Marina: WOW. What a queen. She was SO radiant and magnetic. Every time she coyly looked into the camera, my friend and I would giggle and blush lol. Frankly, I found her version of confident, soft and sensual femininity to be very inspiring. 
* Doechii: she's not my usual type of music but there is no denying that she is an incredible performer and unabashedly herself. She was silly, sexy, powerful--she can do it all.
* Ludacris: honestly I thought he was going to phone it in but he was so engaged and interactive with the crowd!!! everyone around me was having a good ass time, it was pure festival fun
* Walker and Royce: their set was filthy in the best type of way. i was not expecting to have that much fun at that set, sooo much dancing was had
* Sammy Virji: this is my 3rd time seeing him (but can i even count cow palace, that had such a terrible crowd that i left early) and he was so amazing! i was towards the back and we were alllll dancing our asses off. peak vibes, truly!
* Vampire Weekend (day and night): my top sets of the fest. I've been wanting to see them live for over a decade and it finally happened. i had high expectations but they were surpassed because they were wholeheartedly an incredible group of musicians coming together to make an even more incredible band. it was clear that they really enjoy playing together, and they were so tuned into one another that the resulting music was just a cascade of expertly played euphoric goodness. 

Honorable mentions bc I only saw part of their set: Black Coffee (hypnotic), Hozier (duh he was amazing but only caught the last 30 min), Paco Versailles (groovy, funky and fun), Klangphonics (amazing energy despite the smaller crowd)

I truly had a fantastic time at OSL 2025!!!",9,1754901803.0,OutsideLands,2,0.92,False

* Muta has previously mentioned being a dropout
* he's mentioned working in IT
* he's mentioned being an engineer
* and now it turns out he doesn't have a degree. a dropout without a degree? what's next, water starts falling from the sky?

Hi, currently jobless system administrator, former devops engineer and servicedesk engineer here.  
i don't like drama but this one's so funny i couldn't help joining in.

so, i wanna take apart that introductory line above to make a point.

first, currently jobless.  
speaks for itself.

second, sysadmin.  
currently jobless means it's not my current job so either i've been doing that for a long time, i still do it but not in the context of an employment or it refers to my education. whichever one it is, it's correct. the last one is significantly less correct (ironically enough) but still technically correct.

third, former devops engineer and servicedesk engineer.  
those are two job titles frequently used in IT to describe specific positions.  
the first one is, to my knowledge, usually known by that name but can also be called ""devops developer"", ""member of team devops"" and so on.  
the second one is a title used to lure unsuspecting victims into an abusive employment scheme and blah blah blah these people are also known as ""phone monkeys"", ""abuse sponges"" or ""abuse filters"" and ""the most patient people on earth"" because trust me, that's what they are. seriously, if anything these people should be called ""social engineers"" because i've seen them calm people down who i'm pretty sure were actually rabid.

in other words, the person being described is unemployed, has some claim to the title of ""sysadmin"" and has previously worked two jobs that are occasionally referred to with the title of ""engineer"".  
that's what you can get from that one line. though it is indeed inconclusive whether ""sysadmin"" refers to a degree or long term job title or career.

so back to Muta. he's mentioned working in IT and being an engineer. and as you may have noticed, ""engineer"" is NOT a high bar to clear in IT. if you can drink coffee and take a shit without supervision, you're probably an engineer.  
second, he's mentioned being a dropout, which means he probably doesn't have a degree.

now watch me do some science as i put these together and conclude that Muta probably refers to his job title when he mentions being an engineer, as he probably doesn't have a degree. and guess what? i figured that one out forever ago.

so, back to the question: what's with the drama? i mean, this isn't news. Muta hasn't even been lying, calling yourself ""engineer"" on a job title is completely valid nowadays. are we seriously expecting him to add a disclaimer for the two, maybe three morons who couldn't figure this out by themselves?",0,1754901610.0,SomeOrdinaryGmrs,9,0.33,False

“Oh, so you thought Luke Skywalker’s story was wild? Well buckle up, buttercup, because apparently his great-great-grandson is a space pirate drug addict Jedi bounty hunter with daddy issues… yeah, welcome to *Star Wars: Legacy*. Grab some popcorn, grab a death stick, I don’t care, this is happening.”

# Setting the Stage

**JONTRON (casually in front of green screen with a galaxy backdrop):**  
“So, Cade Skywalker. Son of Kol Skywalker, descendant of the OG Luke Skywalker… and *boy*, the Skywalker family tree is basically a generational game of ‘Who can have the most trauma?’”

**JONTRON:**  
“When we first meet Cade, he’s just a Padawan chillin’ with his dad and some Jedi friends—UNTIL THE SITH ATTACK.”

*(Cue explosion SFX and Jon dramatically falling out of his chair.)*

# The Fall & Edgy Pirate Era

**JONTRON:**  
“So, Kol Skywalker dies, Cade watches him go out like a champ, and Cade… well… Cade says ‘Nah, Jedi life’s not for me’ and just *dips*. Becomes a pirate. A bounty hunter. Probably listens to nothing but My Chemical Romance in space.”

*(Cut to a fake “Space Pirate Cade” music video with Jon wearing a Jedi robe and eyeliner, lip-syncing “Welcome to the Black Parade.”)*

**JONTRON:**  
“Oh yeah, and he’s addicted to a drug called *death sticks*. Which—fun fact—are basically space cigarettes that make you see colors you didn’t know existed. Very healthy lifestyle choice for a chosen one.”

# The Reluctant Hero

**JONTRON:**  
“Here’s the kicker: Cade has the power to heal people from DEATH. Like, straight-up Lazarus Pit style. But he hates being a Jedi so much that every time he helps someone, he’s like—”

*(Cut to Jon, angrily handing someone a glass of water)*  
“Fine! But only because you’re *bleeding out*! Jerk.”

# Sith Shenanigans & Destiny

**JONTRON:**  
“Of course, the Sith want him, the Jedi want him, *everyone* wants Cade. He’s basically the galaxy’s most wanted emo. Darth Krayt—the big bad—literally kidnaps him to be like ‘Join me!’ and Cade’s just like—”

*(Cut to Jon wearing sunglasses, sipping coffee)*  
“Yeah, nah.”

**JONTRON:**  
“But slowly, *slowly*, he comes around to the whole ‘saving the galaxy’ thing. Which is good, because it’s not like anyone else is gonna do it—oh wait, never mind, it’s literally always a Skywalker.”

# Conclusion

**JONTRON:**  
“So in the end, Cade takes down Darth Krayt, embraces his destiny… sort of… and we all learn the valuable lesson that the Skywalker family is basically cursed. Like, for real, if you see the name ‘Skywalker’ on someone’s driver’s license, *run*. They’re either gonna save the galaxy or accidentally destroy it.”

Did you know there are actual “job offers” out there telling people you can get paid just to click captchas?! I stumbled onto the site  **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**  and was honestly, like… WHAT? There’s even more claiming you can make money simply by “testing apps” through these so-called gateways.

Let’s talk about it — because I am straight-up confused AND weirdly intrigued at the same time.

- What are App Testing Gateways?  
Apparently, they’re platforms where all you do is complete tiny “tasks.” Stuff like solving captchas, clicking links, or watching ads. NOTHING complicated. Just… click, click, click.

But wait, is money just falling from the sky now? Is this a real side hustle, or some next-level plot twist in the digital job world?

Here’s what I found after almost falling down a *major* rabbit hole with  **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**  and others.

- The SHOCKERS (You won’t believe this):

  - Some claim you get $10 just for clicking 5 captchas?
  - Other platforms request all your personal info for… literally nothing?
  - You might be turning over hours for pennies or—get this—**NO payout at all.**
  - Some even open up risky virus portals after the “tasks.” Um, no thanks.

I was honestly **SUPER hyped** for, like, three minutes. My brain was racing:  
*Could I finally pay for my coffee addiction just clicking captchas in study hall??*

Turns out, after exploration galore with  **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** , it’s not all sunshine and “instant” money vibes.

**ASKING THE REAL QUESTIONS:**  
Has anyone here actually received solid cash-out from  **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**  or similar sites?  
Do you need to give up your privacy, or can you realistically earn something legit & safe?

I NEED some real-life energy here!  
Drop your *successful* (or cringey fail) captcha clicking stories—and spare us any pandemic side hustle scams, please. 

Because right now, I’m shocked, kinda giggling, and also totally confused if I should have become a captcha clicker influencer instead of a… human.

TL;DR: Clicking captchas for cash — epic Silicon Valley side hustle, or wild new scam with a cool website vibe?  
Is  **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**  the real deal or just another notch for the digital FOMO files?

Let’s get **real** about where our clicks, data, and time are actually ending up.   
Are we building bank accounts, or just somebody else’s phishing list?

READY FOR THE JUICY DETAILS! Please share, rant, or recommend.

I'm **Shreya** (31F), and I moved to Chandigarh around 6 months ago. Over this time, I've connected with quite a few people online, some turned out to be men pretending to be women, and some were actual women. With the genuine ones, we chatted for a while, and when I suggested meeting for a coffee or date, they disappeared.

Four days ago, I had gotten ready, booked a cab, and was just minutes away from reaching the café when I suddenly saw that she had blocked me. A few minutes later, her ID was deleted.

And sadly, this wasn’t the first time. It’s happened before, sometimes on Instagram, sometimes on Telegram. We plan everything, talk for days, and then just before the meeting, they either block me or disappear by deleting their accounts.

I mean... what the hell? If you're not ready to meet, or you're only here for chatting or calling, just say so. Don’t lead someone on, make them invest time and energy, and then ghost them right before the actual plan. It’s disrespectful and, honestly, exhausting.

I just want to say, if you're not serious or only here for chatting/calling, please be upfront about it. Don’t lead someone on and vanish when it’s time to meet. It’s hurtful and exhausting.

Chapter 1
I wanted a divorce.

Everyone around me thought I'd lost my mind.

Nathan Reed came from a good family, had money, and was devoted at home. As a stay-at-home wife, I supposedly had it all—so why throw it away?

They said I'd regret it.

And maybe I was crazy.

Because the moment I saw him carrying a bag for his ex, I snapped.

......

It was an orange Hermès Kelly bag, lychee grain leather.

I'd begged Nathan for that bag for ages, but he never bought it for me.

But this morning, I saw it dangling off the arm of his freshly divorced first love—Vanessa Blake.

There was no way she could afford it herself. It didn’t need spelling out.

That night, I asked him directly.

“Did you give Vanessa that bag?”

Nathan had just gotten home from the research institute, face drawn with fatigue. He didn't even look up.

“Yeah.”

One word. No explanation, no guilt—like buying gifts for another woman was just another Tuesday.

I pushed on. “Are you two seeing each other now?”

That finally got a reaction. He looked up, brows drawn tight.

“Emily Carter, is that all you think about? You see a bag and jump straight to cheating?”

That was Nathan. Always sharp. Never gentle. Always turning the spotlight back on me.

When I asked if he wanted breakfast, he'd snap, “What else?”

When I reached out, trying to be close, he’d brush me off. “Can't you see I'm tired?”

It was exhausting.

Around me, he never bothered to speak kindly.

But with others? He was different.

As a pharmaceutical company CEO and lead research engineer, Nathan knew how to turn on the charm.

With business partners, he was smooth-talking.

With family and kids, he was warm and attentive.

And with Vanessa? Even more so. When he spoke to her, even his eyes smiled.

Thinking about it all, I suddenly felt hollow.

I let out a breath.

“Let's get a divorce. I'm done.”

He glanced at me, said nothing, and walked straight into the bathroom.

......

Not long after, the family group chat on Facebook Messenger exploded. My mom fired off a string of voice messages, each nearly a minute long, every one brimming with outrage.

“Emily Carter, are you out of your damn mind? Walking away from a rich husband and a cushy life? If you dare go through with this divorce, I swear I’ll—”

I tapped on one, listened halfway through, then closed it. I'd heard it all before. I was tired.

I went straight to the county court's website and submitted an appointment request.

I should've done this a long time ago.

What was the point of a husband who always took someone else’s side?

I wiped my eyes and looked toward the bathroom. Water was still running steadily.

There was one more thing I needed to do. Something every person on the brink of divorce ends up doing.

I grabbed the car keys and headed to the underground garage.

After wiping away fresh tears, I yanked open the driver’s door.

Usually, I sat in the back with our daughter, Nova, while she rode in her car seat.

The front passenger seat was always empty.

The “Mrs. Reed Exclusive” sticker I'd once stuck on the center console was now faded and curling at the edges.

That sticker had moved with us—from the old Audi A8L to the Range Rover.

I'd been through the worst with Nathan.

A month after our wedding, his father had been kicked off the board for stock manipulation and banned from the securities market for life. The family teetered on bankruptcy. Their estate nearly got repossessed.

With my encouragement, Nathan broke away and started his own company—dodging the family disaster.

Later, we poured everything we had into helping the family stay afloat.

Honestly? Those broke years were the happiest.

But there was no going back.

I accidentally flipped open the sun visor.

The mirror behind it revealed a surprise that hit me like a slap.

Drawn in bright red lipstick were two hearts pierced by a single arrow.

Chapter 2
One look—and I knew exactly who had drawn it.

Lancôme #274. Vanessa Blake’s go-to shade.

The bright smear on the mirror burned my eyes. I reached for a tissue to wipe it away—

But Nathan Reed grabbed my wrist.

He’d just come out of the shower, damp bangs clinging to his forehead. Water droplets hit my hand—cold as ice.

His eyes were sharp, almost accusatory.

“What are you doing in my car?”

I pointed at the lipstick on the mirror. “Vanessa’s, right?”

“Yeah,” he replied, tone flat, like it meant nothing.

No explanation. No shame.

“Don’t touch anything in my car. Get out.”

I yanked my wrist free and stayed put, voice calm.

“Your car? Let me correct you—this was bought with our joint funds. I have every right to be here.”

I paused.

“Don’t worry. After the divorce, I wouldn’t touch this car with a ten-foot pole.”

It was tainted.

Nathan let out a cold laugh. “Fine. Divorce it is.”

He opened the back door and pulled out a red velvet box.

I froze. It looked vaguely familiar, but before I could place it, he circled back, standing beside the car, face shadowed, unreadable.

“What, you want a divorce? Let’s go, then. We’ll talk terms inside.”

He tossed the words out lightly and walked off, his back cold and distant.

Watching him leave, my heart felt like it was being crushed under a boulder.

Seven years of marriage, nights spent side by side—and he couldn’t even fake a shred of hesitation.

My patience, my self-restraint—all of it felt like a cruel joke.

I checked the time. Still early. I could handle the other thing later.

I followed him upstairs, trailing a few steps behind.

When we reached the apartment door, someone was already waiting.

And she was holding Nova’s hand.

Vanessa Blake stood there, long black curls cascading over her shoulders, effortlessly elegant.

You’d never guess she’d just walked out of a messy, bloody divorce.

When she saw Nathan, her lips curled into a soft, glowing smile.

“Nova called and said she wasn’t feeling well, so I picked her up from her after-school class. Forgot to let you know,” she said, voice light and sweet.

“Thanks for the trouble,” Nathan replied. Then he looked down at Nova, frowning slightly.

“Next time, don’t bother Aunt Vanessa. If something’s wrong, call your mom.”

Nova pouted, casting me a sideways glance before ducking behind Vanessa.

“I don’t wanna call Mom! She always makes me do stuff I hate. She won’t let me eat sweets, won’t let me have strawberries…”

Her voice was full of childish indignation.

When had she turned into this?

I used to spend nights trying to figure it out, chalking it up to rebellion or defiance.

But now? I didn’t care to analyze it anymore. It just didn’t matter.

I didn’t bother explaining, like I used to—softly, patiently.

“It’s because you had cavities, sweetheart. That’s why no sweets. And you’re allergic to strawberries, remenber?”

I stepped forward to unlock the door.

But Nova suddenly darted out from behind Vanessa, fists raised, and pounded them against my leg.

“Bad Mommy!”

I stood there, frozen, staring down at her tear-streaked face, silently absorbing her anger and her tiny fists.

Until Nathan picked her up and soothed her.

“Don’t be mad, Nova. Daddy will take you to get some candy.”

Once she calmed down, he looked over at me.

He didn’t say a word. He didn’t have to.

Nova wrapped one arm around his neck and grabbed Vanessa’s hand with the other.

“Aunt Vanessa, can you and Daddy take me to the candy store near school? Please?”

My brows twitched slightly.

An invisible hand seemed to clutch my chest—then let go, leaving only empty air.

Before Nathan could meet my eyes, I unlocked the door.

“I’ll draft the agreement,” I said flatly. “You can look it over when you get back.”

I stepped inside. Alone.

I’d planned to ask Nova if she wanted to stay with Daddy or Mommy.

Now I didn’t need to ask.

I already had my answer.

And her?

I didn’t want her either.

Chapter 3
It was eight o’clock at night when Nathan Reed came home with our daughter, Nova.

Minutes later, I heard the familiar sounds of her flipping through the fridge and turning on the TV. Those bad habits—snacking mindlessly, staring at screens for hours—used to worry me.

I wanted her to grow up healthy and beautiful, so I’d tried to be firm. But all it earned me was a cold “bad mom,” thrown in my face like a dart. These days, I just let it go.

Before long, my bedroom door burst open. Nova marched in, parked herself beside my bed, and started yanking at the blanket.

“Why didn’t you run my bath? I want a milk bubble bath tonight!”

I pressed the blanket down and said flatly, “I’m tired. Go ask your dad.”

She didn’t move. Instead, she grabbed my arm, trying to drag me out of bed. “Dad worked all day! He’s exhausted! You don’t do anything at home. I want you to give me a bath!”

Her words landed like a slap. I almost blurted out, Who taught you to talk like that? But I swallowed it back.

I sat up—and that’s when I saw the divorce papers crumpled in her hand. She’d doodled a cartoon family of three across the page. On one side was Nathan, holding her hand. On the other, a woman with long, dark curls. I didn’t need to ask. It was clearly Vanessa Blake.

Nova tilted her head, giving me a look full of smug defiance, like I was some stray dog soaked in rain. “Dad told me to draw it. He said if you don’t behave, he’ll punish you and make sure you’re not my mom anymore!”

I let out a cold laugh. “Is that so?”

A chill spread through my chest.

Just then, Nathan walked in, toweling off his hair. He completely ignored Nova’s outburst and addressed me in that commanding tone he always used.

“I’m heading out on a business trip in a few days. Pack my suitcase.”

I didn’t move. “I’m serious about the divorce,” I said, steady and calm.

He paused—just for a beat—before narrowing his eyes. The flicker of surprise gave way to annoyance.

“This is about a purse? I’ll send you money. Buy it yourself.”

My phone buzzed. A Venmo notification appeared: $200 from Nathan.

The sting behind my eyes surprised me. I let out a soft, bitter laugh.

Nathan was wealthy—spending tens of thousands without blinking. But now, he tossed me two hundred bucks like I was a panhandler.

I accepted the transfer, my face going cold. “That should cover the divorce filing fee. We’ll divide everything else later.”

He scoffed like I’d just told a joke. “Divorce? You sure about that?”

We locked eyes. The silence between us thickened like fog.

“Mom’s not listening, Dad! Punish her!” Nova cried, clinging to his arm.

Nathan didn’t even flinch. Without a word, he picked her up and walked out.

Moments later, my phone pinged again. A message popped up on FB Messenger. It was a lawyer’s contact card from Nathan, followed by a single line: Talk to my lawyer.

My chest tightened. I stared at the blank message box, fingers frozen above the keyboard. Was there a reset button for life?

After a long pause, I typed: Okay.

I added his lawyer and sent a message stating my intent. By the next morning, the friend request still hadn’t been accepted. Nathan had spent the night in the study.

When I came downstairs, he was shaving in front of the mirror. He was using the imported sensitive-skin shaving cream I’d ordered for him, the one that didn’t trigger his allergies. The bottle was almost empty now.

He saw me in the doorway. His hand stilled for a moment, then he quietly switched his phone to speaker and placed it on the counter.

“Mr. Reed,” the lawyer’s voice came through, “your wife contacted me on Messenger yesterday about a divorce. How would you like to proceed?”

Nathan didn’t look at me. He focused on a patch of missed stubble and replied with careless disdain, “How should you proceed? I hired you to protect my interests. You tell me.”

I said nothing, just watched him.

Back when we were dating, I’d been obsessed with Marriage Story. Scarlett Johansson’s character wrestled with the wreckage of a broken marriage. I remember asking Nathan, “If—and I mean if—we ever got divorced, would we end up fighting over money and assets like that?”

He kissed my hair and said with certainty, “There’s no ‘if.’ I’m growing old with you.”

I could still see the light in his eyes when he said it.

My phone buzzed again. His lawyer had accepted the request.

Mrs. Reed, Mr. Reed has authorized me to represent him in your divorce. What are your terms?

At that moment, Nathan brushed past me with a cold, impassive face.

Nova’s voice floated down the hall. “Dad, I want to stay at Aunt Vanessa’s for a really long time! Don’t pick me up too soon, okay?”

“Okay,” he said.

I didn’t turn around. I waited until the front door closed before replying to the lawyer:

Equal division of marital assets. I don’t want custody of our daughter.

Chapter 4
The moment I sent the message, a screenshot came back instantly.

It was a chat log between Nathan and his lawyer.

Nathan Reed: Send her this: If she wants a divorce, she leaves with nothing.

I felt the heat rise behind my eyes.

Seven years of marriage, and this was how it would end? I’d thought we could separate with at least a shred of dignity. Clearly, I’d been naive.

I shut off my phone and took a breath. Once the fury had cooled, I turned it back on and started looking for a divorce attorney. After some initial consultations, one of them offered a suggestion.

“Your husband’s a public figure. If you want leverage, gather proof of his affair. That kind of evidence can shift the power dynamic.”

Proof?

I had none. Outwardly, Nathan had never crossed a line.

The silence in the house was suffocating. Nova was at Vanessa’s, and Nathan hadn’t come home. I sat at my computer, blankly refreshing the county court’s appointment page. My heart felt like a stagnant pond.

Leave with nothing? No. I wasn’t going down without a fight.

Just then, a video call from Ashley popped up on Messenger. Her camera was shaking wildly.

“Emily, you need to see what your husband’s doing right now!”

The video stabilized. Nathan and Vanessa were at a dinner table, arm in arm, clinking glasses and laughing, egged on by clients.

Nathan never drank. His stomach couldn’t handle it—he’d ended up in the ER years ago with a bleeding ulcer. After that, he swore off alcohol completely.

He’d told me once, “My health is everything. If I’m gone, how are you supposed to go on?”

But here he was, drinking with Vanessa like nothing mattered.

After the first toast, the clients weren’t done.

“Mr. Reed, there’s still half a bottle left. Don’t let it go to waste!”

Nathan’s expression faltered slightly, but before he could respond, Vanessa grabbed the bottle. “His stomach’s weak. I’ll drink for him!”

She threw her head back and downed the entire half bottle. Coughing, she smiled playfully. “That enough?”

For a moment, the room went quiet. Then came the laughter.

“Mr. Reed, you’re one lucky man! A woman like this—priceless!”

Vanessa’s eyes shimmered as she played humble. “Oh, it’s nothing. Compared to Mrs. Reed, I’m barely doing anything.”

A client perked up. “Oh? Is Mrs. Reed an even heavier drinker?”

Another joined in, “How about this, Mr. Reed—call your wife. If she finishes a glass, I’ll sign that billion-dollar contract tonight!”

Nathan hesitated, then pulled out his phone.

Ashley’s video cut off as my phone rang.

It was Nathan. His voice was low, cold. “I’m giving you an out, Emily. Come to The Ember Room now, and I’ll pretend none of this happened.”

I looked at our wedding photo, crumpled at the bottom of the trash can.

My voice was just as cold. “No.”

He went silent, then snapped, “Fine. Don’t regret this.”

I wouldn’t.

Ashley called again. The video resumed. Nathan slammed his glass on the table. Vanessa grabbed his arm, murmuring sweetly, “Don’t be mad. If she won’t come, I’ll drink for you—”

Ashley muttered under her breath, “Fucking snakes.”

Nathan heard something by the door and looked sharply toward it.

He’d noticed the camera.

His eyes locked onto the lens. Then, he grabbed Vanessa’s wrist as she held her drink.

“You want a show? Record this. Make sure she sees it.”

He downed a shot and kissed Vanessa full on the lips, liquor dripping from their mouths.

A sharp pain stabbed my chest. Then it receded, leaving nothing but numbness.

I stopped the recording and sent the video to Nathan’s lawyer.

“Is this worth half his assets?”

Nathan’s company had just gone public. A scandal like this could destroy it.

A long silence followed.

Then came the reply: Mr. Reed agrees.

A divorce agreement arrived seconds later.

I'd won. I should’ve felt triumphant.

But all I saw in the black phone screen was a pale, exhausted reflection of myself.

On TV, a travel ad flickered on: “Feeling lost? Burnt out? At the edge of the world lies an island that can cleanse your soul.”

Iceland.

My heart stirred.

Since getting married, I’d barely had a moment to myself. Maybe it was time.

I booked a flight and started packing.

Halfway through, I stopped.

There, buried beneath a sweater, was the red velvet box Nathan had pulled from his car the day I first mentioned divorce.

Inside was a man’s wedding band.

Chapter 5
Nathan Reed never liked wearing jewelry.

When I once begged him to get matching couple’s rings, he turned me down flat.

“I don’t like feeling tied down,” he said, final and firm.

But when he proposed, he chose a wedding band.

Under the golden glow of a Rocky Mountain sunset, we exchanged rings and kissed—like we’d just claimed the whole damn world.

Later, I teased him, “Didn’t you say you hated rings?”

He kissed the one on my finger, his gaze full of love—and something close to reverence.

“The mark proves our love. I’ll never take it off, not in this lifetime.”

Back then, I was the center of his world.

Somewhere along the way, though, Nathan stopped wearing his ring.

Not that it mattered anymore.

Mine had been gone for ages—lost somewhere in the wreckage of us.

......

He didn’t come home that night. Neither did Nova.

The day I booked my flight to Iceland, a package arrived. The sender’s name? Nova.

I hesitated. Then tore it open.

Inside was a Hermès Kelly—vibrant orange, lychee leather. The one I’d always wanted.

Tucked next to it was a note, scrawled in Vanessa Blake’s unmistakable handwriting:

“Heard you were ready to divorce Nathan over this bag. Here it is—so quit throwing tantrums.”

“Oh, and Nathan’s just been with me these past few days, looking after Nova. Maybe try coaxing him a little?”

I tossed the card without blinking.

When you’re truly done, even betrayal loses its sting.

I got rid of everything.

The wedding photos.

The matching down jackets.

The his-and-hers coffee mugs.

Gone. Every last piece.

Right after the cleaning crew hauled off the boxes, the front door creaked open.

Nathan and Vanessa walked in, each holding one of Nova’s hands.

The second she saw me, Nova yanked free, climbed onto the couch, and started barking orders like a little queen.

“Get me ice cream! And Chips Ahoy!”

I ignored her.

I grabbed my suitcase and made for the door—but Nathan stepped in my way, his hand locking down on the handle.

“Where do you think you’re going?”

“On a trip,” I said, cool and flat.

He opened his mouth, but Vanessa jumped in, her voice syrupy-sweet.

“Emily’s probably just tired. A little getaway might clear her head. You two can talk when she gets back.”

She turned to me with a smile that didn’t reach her eyes.

“Go enjoy yourself. Don’t worry about Nova—I’ve got her.”

I was about to reply when Nathan’s voice cut through—sharp, demanding.

“Where’s your ring?”

I followed his gaze to my bare finger.

“Lost it,” I said.

His eyes flickered—doubt, maybe—but he masked it quickly.

“Come home soon,” he said.

I gave him a faint smile and didn’t answer.

This wasn’t my home anymore. And I wasn’t coming back.

I closed the door behind me, shutting them all out, then hailed a cab to the airport.

Seven hours later, I landed in Iceland

Quiet. Distant. A beautiful escape from the life I’d known.

The noise, the pain, the wreckage of my marriage—fading with every mile.

One night, I stood with a group of travelers, waiting for the aurora. My phone buzzed. Unknown number.

Nathan.

I thought it might be about the divorce papers, so I stepped away to answer.

Instead, I got this:

“Why aren’t you back yet? When are you going to take me off your block list?”

I frowned, pulling up my calendar.

“Ten days.”

Ten days until the divorce decree was finalized.

As for the block list? He wasn’t getting off it.

“Ten days?” His voice tightened. “Don’t forget who you are. You’re Nova’s mother. You’re my—”

“Emily! The aurora’s out—make a wish!”

A fellow traveler’s shout drowned him out.

I set the phone down, closed my eyes, and made my wish:

May the rest of my days—alone—shine bright and bold.

Ten days later, I was back in the States.

After landing, I hit the salon. When I looked in the mirror, I saw crisp white blouse, glowing skin, and the version of me I hadn’t seen in years—vibrant, fearless, unapologetically alive.

I texted Nathan to meet at a coffee shop near the county courthouse.

He was already there when I arrived.

His eyes lit up when he saw me, but the awe faded fast, replaced by that same smug, controlling tone I’d grown to loathe.

“You can’t keep doing this, Emily—running off like that. The house has been a mess without you.”

As if I was supposed to slink back and play the dutiful wife. As if the screaming matches and shattered trust had all been some temporary drama.

I cut him off. “Let’s go.”

“Go where?” he blinked.

I showed him my Messenger chat with the lawyer, then locked my screen and stood up.

“To the Clerk’s Office. To pick up the divorce decree.”

Chapter 1
I wanted a divorce.

Everyone around me thought I'd lost my mind.

Nathan Reed came from a good family, had money, and was devoted at home. As a stay-at-home wife, I supposedly had it all—so why throw it away?

They said I'd regret it.

And maybe I was crazy.

Because the moment I saw him carrying a bag for his ex, I snapped.

......

It was an orange Hermès Kelly bag, lychee grain leather.

I'd begged Nathan for that bag for ages, but he never bought it for me.

But this morning, I saw it dangling off the arm of his freshly divorced first love—Vanessa Blake.

There was no way she could afford it herself. It didn’t need spelling out.

That night, I asked him directly.

“Did you give Vanessa that bag?”

Nathan had just gotten home from the research institute, face drawn with fatigue. He didn't even look up.

“Yeah.”

One word. No explanation, no guilt—like buying gifts for another woman was just another Tuesday.

I pushed on. “Are you two seeing each other now?”

That finally got a reaction. He looked up, brows drawn tight.

“Emily Carter, is that all you think about? You see a bag and jump straight to cheating?”

“Nova called and said she wasn’t feeling well, so I picked her up from her after-school class. Forgot to let you know,” she said, voice light and sweet.

“Don’t be mad, Nova. Daddy will take you to get some candy.”

I pressed the blanket down and said flatly, “I’m tired. Go ask your dad.”

She didn’t move. Instead, she grabbed my arm, trying to drag me out of bed. “Dad worked all day! He’s exhausted! You don’t do anything at home. I want you to give me a bath!”

Her words landed like a slap. I almost blurted out, Who taught you to talk like that? But I swallowed it back.

I sat up—and that’s when I saw the divorce papers crumpled in her hand. She’d doodled a cartoon family of three across the page. On one side was Nathan, holding her hand. On the other, a woman with long, dark curls. I didn’t need to ask. It was clearly Vanessa Blake.

Nova tilted her head, giving me a look full of smug defiance, like I was some stray dog soaked in rain. “Dad told me to draw it. He said if you don’t behave, he’ll punish you and make sure you’re not my mom anymore!”

I let out a cold laugh. “Is that so?”

A chill spread through my chest.

Just then, Nathan walked in, toweling off his hair. He completely ignored Nova’s outburst and addressed me in that commanding tone he always used.

“I’m heading out on a business trip in a few days. Pack my suitcase.”

I didn’t move. “I’m serious about the divorce,” I said, steady and calm.

He paused—just for a beat—before narrowing his eyes. The flicker of surprise gave way to annoyance.

“This is about a purse? I’ll send you money. Buy it yourself.”

My phone buzzed. A Venmo notification appeared: $200 from Nathan.

The sting behind my eyes surprised me. I let out a soft, bitter laugh.

Nathan was wealthy—spending tens of thousands without blinking. But now, he tossed me two hundred bucks like I was a panhandler.

I accepted the transfer, my face going cold. “That should cover the divorce filing fee. We’ll divide everything else later.”

He scoffed like I’d just told a joke. “Divorce? You sure about that?”

We locked eyes. The silence between us thickened like fog.

“Mom’s not listening, Dad! Punish her!” Nova cried, clinging to his arm.

Nathan didn’t even flinch. Without a word, he picked her up and walked out.

Moments later, my phone pinged again. A message popped up on FB Messenger. It was a lawyer’s contact card from Nathan, followed by a single line: Talk to my lawyer.

My chest tightened. I stared at the blank message box, fingers frozen above the keyboard. Was there a reset button for life?

After a long pause, I typed: Okay.

I added his lawyer and sent a message stating my intent. By the next morning, the friend request still hadn’t been accepted. Nathan had spent the night in the study.

When I came downstairs, he was shaving in front of the mirror. He was using the imported sensitive-skin shaving cream I’d ordered for him, the one that didn’t trigger his allergies. The bottle was almost empty now.

He saw me in the doorway. His hand stilled for a moment, then he quietly switched his phone to speaker and placed it on the counter.

“Mr. Reed,” the lawyer’s voice came through, “your wife contacted me on Messenger yesterday about a divorce. How would you like to proceed?”

Nathan didn’t look at me. He focused on a patch of missed stubble and replied with careless disdain, “How should you proceed? I hired you to protect my interests. You tell me.”

I said nothing, just watched him.

Back when we were dating, I’d been obsessed with Marriage Story. Scarlett Johansson’s character wrestled with the wreckage of a broken marriage. I remember asking Nathan, “If—and I mean if—we ever got divorced, would we end up fighting over money and assets like that?”

He kissed my hair and said with certainty, “There’s no ‘if.’ I’m growing old with you.”

I could still see the light in his eyes when he said it.

My phone buzzed again. His lawyer had accepted the request.

Mrs. Reed, Mr. Reed has authorized me to represent him in your divorce. What are your terms?

At that moment, Nathan brushed past me with a cold, impassive face.

Nova’s voice floated down the hall. “Dad, I want to stay at Aunt Vanessa’s for a really long time! Don’t pick me up too soon, okay?”

“Okay,” he said.

I didn’t turn around. I waited until the front door closed before replying to the lawyer:

Equal division of marital assets. I don’t want custody of our daughter.

Chapter 4
The moment I sent the message, a screenshot came back instantly.

It was a chat log between Nathan and his lawyer.

Nathan Reed: Send her this: If she wants a divorce, she leaves with nothing.

I felt the heat rise behind my eyes.

Seven years of marriage, and this was how it would end? I’d thought we could separate with at least a shred of dignity. Clearly, I’d been naive.

I shut off my phone and took a breath. Once the fury had cooled, I turned it back on and started looking for a divorce attorney. After some initial consultations, one of them offered a suggestion.

“Your husband’s a public figure. If you want leverage, gather proof of his affair. That kind of evidence can shift the power dynamic.”

Proof?

I had none. Outwardly, Nathan had never crossed a line.

The silence in the house was suffocating. Nova was at Vanessa’s, and Nathan hadn’t come home. I sat at my computer, blankly refreshing the county court’s appointment page. My heart felt like a stagnant pond.

Leave with nothing? No. I wasn’t going down without a fight.

Just then, a video call from Ashley popped up on Messenger. Her camera was shaking wildly.

“Emily, you need to see what your husband’s doing right now!”

The video stabilized. Nathan and Vanessa were at a dinner table, arm in arm, clinking glasses and laughing, egged on by clients.

Nathan never drank. His stomach couldn’t handle it—he’d ended up in the ER years ago with a bleeding ulcer. After that, he swore off alcohol completely.

He’d told me once, “My health is everything. If I’m gone, how are you supposed to go on?”

But here he was, drinking with Vanessa like nothing mattered.

After the first toast, the clients weren’t done.

“Mr. Reed, there’s still half a bottle left. Don’t let it go to waste!”

Nathan’s expression faltered slightly, but before he could respond, Vanessa grabbed the bottle. “His stomach’s weak. I’ll drink for him!”

She threw her head back and downed the entire half bottle. Coughing, she smiled playfully. “That enough?”

For a moment, the room went quiet. Then came the laughter.

“Mr. Reed, you’re one lucky man! A woman like this—priceless!”

Vanessa’s eyes shimmered as she played humble. “Oh, it’s nothing. Compared to Mrs. Reed, I’m barely doing anything.”

A client perked up. “Oh? Is Mrs. Reed an even heavier drinker?”

Another joined in, “How about this, Mr. Reed—call your wife. If she finishes a glass, I’ll sign that billion-dollar contract tonight!”

Nathan hesitated, then pulled out his phone.

Ashley’s video cut off as my phone rang.

It was Nathan. His voice was low, cold. “I’m giving you an out, Emily. Come to The Ember Room now, and I’ll pretend none of this happened.”

I looked at our wedding photo, crumpled at the bottom of the trash can.

My voice was just as cold. “No.”

He went silent, then snapped, “Fine. Don’t regret this.”

I wouldn’t.

Ashley called again. The video resumed. Nathan slammed his glass on the table. Vanessa grabbed his arm, murmuring sweetly, “Don’t be mad. If she won’t come, I’ll drink for you—”

Ashley muttered under her breath, “Fucking snakes.”

Nathan heard something by the door and looked sharply toward it.

He’d noticed the camera.

His eyes locked onto the lens. Then, he grabbed Vanessa’s wrist as she held her drink.

“You want a show? Record this. Make sure she sees it.”

He downed a shot and kissed Vanessa full on the lips, liquor dripping from their mouths.

A sharp pain stabbed my chest. Then it receded, leaving nothing but numbness.

I stopped the recording and sent the video to Nathan’s lawyer.

“Is this worth half his assets?”

Nathan’s company had just gone public. A scandal like this could destroy it.

A long silence followed.

Then came the reply: Mr. Reed agrees.

A divorce agreement arrived seconds later.

I'd won. I should’ve felt triumphant.

But all I saw in the black phone screen was a pale, exhausted reflection of myself.

On TV, a travel ad flickered on: “Feeling lost? Burnt out? At the edge of the world lies an island that can cleanse your soul.”

Iceland.

My heart stirred.

Since getting married, I’d barely had a moment to myself. Maybe it was time.

I booked a flight and started packing.

Halfway through, I stopped.

There, buried beneath a sweater, was the red velvet box Nathan had pulled from his car the day I first mentioned divorce.

Inside was a man’s wedding band.

Chapter 5
Nathan Reed never liked wearing jewelry.

When I once begged him to get matching couple’s rings, he turned me down flat.

“I don’t like feeling tied down,” he said, final and firm.

But when he proposed, he chose a wedding band.

Under the golden glow of a Rocky Mountain sunset, we exchanged rings and kissed—like we’d just claimed the whole damn world.

Later, I teased him, “Didn’t you say you hated rings?”

He kissed the one on my finger, his gaze full of love—and something close to reverence.

“The mark proves our love. I’ll never take it off, not in this lifetime.”

Back then, I was the center of his world.

Somewhere along the way, though, Nathan stopped wearing his ring.

Not that it mattered anymore.

Mine had been gone for ages—lost somewhere in the wreckage of us.

......

He didn’t come home that night. Neither did Nova.

The day I booked my flight to Iceland, a package arrived. The sender’s name? Nova.

I hesitated. Then tore it open.

Inside was a Hermès Kelly—vibrant orange, lychee leather. The one I’d always wanted.

Tucked next to it was a note, scrawled in Vanessa Blake’s unmistakable handwriting:

“Heard you were ready to divorce Nathan over this bag. Here it is—so quit throwing tantrums.”

“Oh, and Nathan’s just been with me these past few days, looking after Nova. Maybe try coaxing him a little?”

I tossed the card without blinking.

When you’re truly done, even betrayal loses its sting.

I got rid of everything.

The wedding photos.

The matching down jackets.

The his-and-hers coffee mugs.

Gone. Every last piece.

Right after the cleaning crew hauled off the boxes, the front door creaked open.

Nathan and Vanessa walked in, each holding one of Nova’s hands.

The second she saw me, Nova yanked free, climbed onto the couch, and started barking orders like a little queen.

“Get me ice cream! And Chips Ahoy!”

I ignored her.

I grabbed my suitcase and made for the door—but Nathan stepped in my way, his hand locking down on the handle.

“Where do you think you’re going?”

“On a trip,” I said, cool and flat.

He opened his mouth, but Vanessa jumped in, her voice syrupy-sweet.

“Emily’s probably just tired. A little getaway might clear her head. You two can talk when she gets back.”

She turned to me with a smile that didn’t reach her eyes.

“Go enjoy yourself. Don’t worry about Nova—I’ve got her.”

I was about to reply when Nathan’s voice cut through—sharp, demanding.

“Where’s your ring?”

I followed his gaze to my bare finger.

“Lost it,” I said.

His eyes flickered—doubt, maybe—but he masked it quickly.

“Come home soon,” he said.

I gave him a faint smile and didn’t answer.

This wasn’t my home anymore. And I wasn’t coming back.

I closed the door behind me, shutting them all out, then hailed a cab to the airport.

Seven hours later, I landed in Iceland

Quiet. Distant. A beautiful escape from the life I’d known.

The noise, the pain, the wreckage of my marriage—fading with every mile.

One night, I stood with a group of travelers, waiting for the aurora. My phone buzzed. Unknown number.

Nathan.

I thought it might be about the divorce papers, so I stepped away to answer.

Instead, I got this:

“Why aren’t you back yet? When are you going to take me off your block list?”

I frowned, pulling up my calendar.

“Ten days.”

Ten days until the divorce decree was finalized.

As for the block list? He wasn’t getting off it.

“Ten days?” His voice tightened. “Don’t forget who you are. You’re Nova’s mother. You’re my—”

“Emily! The aurora’s out—make a wish!”

A fellow traveler’s shout drowned him out.

I set the phone down, closed my eyes, and made my wish:

May the rest of my days—alone—shine bright and bold.

Ten days later, I was back in the States.

After landing, I hit the salon. When I looked in the mirror, I saw crisp white blouse, glowing skin, and the version of me I hadn’t seen in years—vibrant, fearless, unapologetically alive.

I texted Nathan to meet at a coffee shop near the county courthouse.

He was already there when I arrived.

His eyes lit up when he saw me, but the awe faded fast, replaced by that same smug, controlling tone I’d grown to loathe.

“You can’t keep doing this, Emily—running off like that. The house has been a mess without you.”

As if I was supposed to slink back and play the dutiful wife. As if the screaming matches and shattered trust had all been some temporary drama.

I cut him off. “Let’s go.”

“Go where?” he blinked.

I showed him my Messenger chat with the lawyer, then locked my screen and stood up.

“To the Clerk’s Office. To pick up the divorce decree.”

1mn7hk7,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1mn7hk7/i_feel_m30_that_there_is_romantic_chemistry_and/,"""I feel (M30) that there is romantic chemistry and attraction between me and my best friend (M31)  for the past 11 years.","I should(?) start by saying that both of us are seemingly heterosexual, in terms of our relationships with women.

About 10 years ago, while I didn’t have any thoughts like this about him at the time, some (perhaps unconscious) actions of his made me start having these thoughts. My friend is quite tall and big-built, so he might struggle to fit into café chairs, but whenever we’d go for coffee, we would sit next to each other, and his fingertips would lightly touch my back, or sometimes his feet would touch mine. This gave me unfamiliar feelings, and I began to enjoy this contact with him. Back then, since I was younger and more shy, I decided to talk to him, but only about his side of things. So I told him that I felt like he might have an attraction toward me, as he often touched me. He responded with the following phrase, which is still the main reason why I’m so confused: He said, ""I knew you’d say this — but no, it’s because I love you a lot, probably like a brother.""

In the following months, he was a bit more distant, but the distance didn’t last long, and we remained friends.

The last 2 years, my desire has grown significantly. I should clarify that I don’t want us to become a couple. I don’t know how to explain it, but I want us to stay friends as we are, but I want to be able to hug him... kiss him... and for our relationship to remain as it is. I know this isn’t very logical... Often I talk to him in a sweeter way, and he responds. We speak in a way that’s much more tender than I’ve ever spoken to any man. He’s been working abroad for a few months now, so we talk almost every day. I tell him I love him, and he tells me that he loves me too. I tell him I miss him a lot and want him to come and give me a hug, then talk and relax. He responds by saying, “I miss you so much too, I want to come and have coffee, but first I want to hug you until you explode.” When we say goodnight, we always say ""lots and lots of kisses"" to each other... a way of communicating I’ve never had with any friend.

Aside from these signs (like how we talk on the internet, and the phrase from years ago), there are not any other signs, or clearer ones.

So, I’m thinking of telling him, ""I feel like this... I want to kiss you."" But I don’t want to lose him from my life, so I always hold back... and swallow it.

Other times, I think that life is too short, and it’s a shame for such beautiful feelings to remain hidden... Other times, I think it will all go terribly wrong, and he will distance himself from me.

I really don’t know... If that line from years ago (""I knew you’d say this"") hadn’t been said, I would think that he’s just a very tender and affectionate friend with me. Now, I think we might have a real bromance... I would really appreciate it if anyone who read this, and especially any men with similar experiences, could share their opinion.

""Adrian, please tell me this isn't real,"" my voice broke into a sob. ""We have Gale. We're a family!""



""A family?"" Sophia suddenly spoke, her voice sickeningly sweet. She glided in front of me, a victor's smile on her face. ""My dear Elena, haven't you figured it out yet?""



She stroked the true mark on her own neck, the one that glowed with silver light.



""That little trinket on your neck,"" she said, pointing at me with a perfectly manicured nail, ""cost Adrian a hundred thousand dollars. He bought it from some decrepit Blood-Sorceress.""



""It was forged in a full-moon ritual using Adrian's own blood. It doesn't just mimic a mark's scent; its true purpose was to cloud your senses and dull your instincts, trapping you in an illusion of love.""



One hundred thousand dollars.



He spent a hundred thousand dollars to weave the perfect lie.



""You've lived in that lie for eight years,"" Sophia's smile widened. ""The pack's entire inner circle knew the truth. You were the only fool kept in the dark.""



She lifted her chin smugly. ""See the difference? A real mark pulses with the heartbeat, glows softly when a mate is near. And yours? It's nothing more than a scar left by dead magic.""



My legs started to give out.



""No... that's impossible...""



""Mommy?"" Gale's timid voice cut through the noise. He was clutching his medal, his small face pale. ""Is what Dad said... true? Is the mark a fake?""



He walked cautiously toward Adrian, looking up at the Alpha he had called 'Dad' for eight years.



""Dad, tell me it's not true."" Gale’s eyes were filled with hope, the pure, innocent trust a child has for his father.



Adrian looked down at him, his eyes empty of any warmth.



""Let go."" He roughly shook off the small hand clutching his trousers.



Gale stumbled backward, his small body slamming hard into a cold stone pillar.



""Ah!"" The boy cried out in pain.



The medal clattered to the ground.



That medal was the proof of how amazing he was—proof he’d earned by training for three months, even competing with an injured arm, all so his 'dad' would see him shine.



Sophia sauntered over in her high heels.



She glanced down at the gold medal on the floor, and then, with a deliberate, cruel slowness, she brought her heel down and stomped on it.



A sharp crack echoed as the medal split in two.



""Little mutt,"" she sneered, ""you will never be worthy of the Blackwood pack.""



She ground the shattered medal under her heel, her eyes gleaming with malice. ""Just like your mother. Both of you, shameless fakes.""



""No!"" Gale cried, scrambling for it. ""That's mine!""



Seeing my son humiliated like this, something inside me snapped.



I lunged forward to protect him.



But before I could reach him, a cold hand clamped down on my shoulder.

  
""Elena.""



Victoria’s voice was like ice, each syllable laced with the authority of her rank.



Adrian’s mother, the former Luna of the Blackwood pack, stood elegantly behind me.



She walked toward the broken medal, her gaze filled with disgust.



""You shouldn't have brought this mutt to defile our sacred gathering.""



With a disdainful kick, she sent the broken medal flying toward a trash can in the corner of the garden. ""We don't welcome things of inferior blood here.""



""No!"" Gale let out a heart-wrenching scream.



He stumbled toward the trash can, his small hands digging frantically through the filth. ""That's mine… I trained for three months for that…""



His voice was choked with sobs, tears streaming down his face.



I saw the bandage on his arm begin to soak with fresh blood.



For that medal, he had trained late into the night, refusing to stop even when he was hurt.



After every session, he would ask me, ""Mommy, will Dad be proud of me?""



And I always said, ""Of course, baby. Dad will see how amazing you are.""



""He is your grandson!"" I screamed at Victoria, my voice raw.



""I have no such embarrassing grandson,"" Victoria scoffed. ""A half-blood, worthy of the Blackwood name? Don't make me laugh.""



""Please…"" Gale cried, pulling the broken pieces from the trash. ""It's my most precious thing… Please don't throw it away…""



Seeing my eight-year-old son kneeling by the garbage, my heart felt like it was being ripped from my chest.



The royal blood I had suppressed for eight years began to boil, a powerful Alpha aura leaking from me, raw and uncontrolled.



""Gale, don't cry. Come to Mommy."" I tried to go to him, but Victoria blocked my path.



""Elena, control your whelp.""



""Poor little thing,"" Sophia cooed, walking up to me.



""Still daydreaming."" She suddenly gave me a hard shove.



I stumbled back, my spine slamming against the sharp edge of the stone steps.



A searing pain shot through me.



""Mommy!"" Seeing me hurt, Gale dropped the broken medal and ran toward me without a second thought. ""Mommy, are you okay?""



He was already weak from Adrian shoving him into the pillar.



He was running so fast now that his little face was flushed red.



""I'm okay, baby, I'm okay…"" I reached out for him.



But Gale's foot slipped.



Time seemed to stand still.



I saw his small body falling toward the stone steps, I saw the terror in his eyes, and I heard my own desperate scream.



""NO—""



A sickening CRACK echoed as his head slammed into the sharp corner of a step.



Blood gushed out instantly, staining the white stone red.



""Gale!"" I scrambled to him and pulled him into my arms.



My hands were immediately covered in warm blood.



""It's okay, baby, Mommy's here…"" But there was so much blood.



His little face was turning pale as paper.



""Adrian! Call the pack doctor!"" I screamed, my voice thick with tears.



Adrian just stood there, watching it all unfold with a detached expression.



""Stop the act, Elena.""



Act?



I couldn't believe what I was hearing.



""Your son is bleeding!"" I shrieked hysterically.



""He's a werewolf. He has regenerative abilities. He's not going to die,"" Adrian’s voice was chillingly calm. ""Did you really think a stunt like this would win you any sympathy?""



Regenerative ability?



Gale had never shifted, never awakened his wolf.



He didn't have strong regenerative abilities!



I didn't have time to explain.



I tried to pick Gale up and run, but two pack warriors blocked my way.



""Get out of my way! He needs a doctor!""



""Ma'am, please calm down,"" one of them said, his face a blank mask. ""Don't disturb the ceremony.""



I looked back at Adrian.



He was kneeling in front of Sophia, gently fixing a strand of her hair that the wind had misplaced.



He was completely ignoring his dying son.



""Mommy…"" Gale's voice was a faint whisper.



He struggled to lift his small hand, still clutching the broken pieces of his medal.



Blood dripped from between his fingers, stark and horrifying in the moonlight.



He tried to open his eyes, looking at me with confusion and hurt.



""Mommy… I just wanted Dad… to see I was strong…""



With those words, his eyes fluttered shut, his small body going limp.



The small body in my arms was growing colder.

I shoved the two warriors aside with all my strength.



""Get out of my way!"" Desperation gave me a power I never knew I had.



I scooped Gale up and ran for the main gate like a madwoman.



He felt lighter in my arms, his breathing growing fainter.



A horrifying trail of crimson marked my path on the ground.



""Hang on, baby. Mommy's taking you to a doctor.""



I reached the parking lot, fumbling to open the car door.



I jammed the key in the ignition and twisted.



Nothing.



""No, no, no…"" I twisted the key again and again.



The engine just made a choked, clicking sound before falling silent.



Someone had tampered with my car.



An image of Sophia’s triumphant face flashed in my mind.



""That bitch!"" I cursed, picking Gale up and running back.



I needed to borrow a car.



I needed to beg someone for help.



But as I reached the garden entrance, I saw a sight that shattered my heart.



Adrian was kneeling before Sophia, gently wiping a tear from the corner of her eye.



""It's okay, don't be scared,"" his voice was softer than I had ever heard it. ""That crazy woman won't bother you again.""



""Adrian, I'm begging you!"" I dropped to my knees in front of him.



Gale was unconscious in my arms, his face as white as a sheet. ""Save him! He's your blood! He's called you Dad for eight years!""



Tears blurred my vision, but I could clearly see that Adrian didn't even glance down at Gale.



""That's enough, Elena. Your act is pathetic.""



I was holding my dying son, sobbing my heart out on the ground.



He called it an act?



""He's dying!"" My voice shattered. ""He's only eight!""



""A child of my bloodline doesn't die so easily,"" Adrian said, standing up and dusting off his pants. ""I know you're jealous of me and Sophia, but you don't have to resort to such vicious lies.""



""Ma'am, I'll take you."" A young voice spoke up.



Adrian's Beta, Tyler, was suddenly beside me.



Without asking for permission, he gently took Gale from my arms.



""Quick! Get in the car!""



The car sped through the night.



I held my son tightly, feeling his life slipping away.



His body was getting colder, his breathing shallower.



""Faster, please, go faster!""



""I'm already at top speed,"" Tyler’s voice was tense. ""Hang on, we're almost there.""



But of all the terrible luck, we got into a car crash right in front of the emergency room.



""Luna, I'll handle the accident! You get Gale to a doctor! I promised the Alpha I'd take care of—""



""Doctor! Help!"" Gale was a dead weight in my arms.



I didn't hear the rest of what Tyler said.



I just grabbed my bloody son and ran inside.



The heavy doors swung shut.



The red light above the door lit up.



I collapsed onto a cold chair, my hands covered in my son's blood.



It was still warm, as if he had just been talking in my arms moments ago.



Suddenly, Adrian's voice echoed in my head through the mind link.



I took a deep breath and answered.



""Elena, where are you?"" His tone was rushed, as if he wanted to calm me down quickly. ""I know you're angry. I didn't expect my mother to do that. But trust me, this is just a temporary measure!""



""A temporary measure?"" my voice was a hoarse whisper.



""For the good of the pack, I need to mate with Sophia. But I swear to you, my heart is only with you. Once I've secured my position as Alpha…""



The good of the pack?



My son was fighting for his life, and he was talking about the pack?



""Your son is dying!""



""Enough! Stop threatening me with that. He has werewolf blood, his healing is strong enough. There's no way he's in any real danger!""



I heard a door open on his end.



Adrian, in his arrogance, hadn't even bothered to close the mind link.



""Darling, did that crazy woman give you any more trouble?"" Sophia's sweet voice dripped with venom.



""No, my love,"" Adrian’s voice was gentle.



""You're so clever, fooling her with that fake mark for so long,"" Sophia giggled. ""If I hadn't needed time to clean up my own mess in Europe, you wouldn't have been stuck playing house with her for so long.""



Playing house.



There it was again.



""Elena was just a substitute I found while you were away,"" Adrian's breathing grew heavy, as if he was lost in Sophia's kisses. ""Now that I've gotten what I needed from her, it's time to get rid of her.""



""What about the little wolf pup? Won't you feel guilty if he actually dies?"" Sophia's voice was closer now.



""Guilty about what?"" Adrian scoffed. ""He's just a mutt. He's not a threat. This is all just a game Elena is playing.""



Tears streamed down my face as I cut the link.



I couldn't listen anymore.



Eight years.



My entire eight-year union was an elaborate, carefully planned lie.



Everything I had given up for him meant nothing.



I was just a substitute, a plaything.



And my son, the boy who asked me every day, ""When is Daddy coming home?"" was nothing but a ""mutt"" to him.



The emergency room doors opened.



A doctor took off his mask and walked toward me, his eyes full of apology.



""I'm so sorry. We did everything we could. The child lost too much blood, and… he didn't have a werewolf's regenerative abilities…""



A primal howl of pure agony tore from my throat.



The next second, I threw myself onto Gale's cold, still body.



For eight long years, my Gale had lived like a rogue, never accepted by his father's pack.



I just wanted to hear him call me 'Mommy' one more time.



But now, he just lay there.



His sweet face was colorless, so quiet, as if he had never been in this world at all.



Fueled by overwhelming grief and rage, the ancient seal that had suppressed my power for eight years shattered into dust.



A primal and pure Alpha power erupted from me, so immense that every werewolf in the hospital felt it and dropped to their knees in terror.



I held Gale and cried all night.



When the sun rose, I shakily called my father to handle Gale's arrangements.



Then, I went home, clutching Gale's last belongings.



The broken medal I’d fished from the trash, and his favorite stuffed toy.



The moment I pushed open the door, the cloying, tangled scents of Adrian and Sophia hit me like a physical blow.



They dared…



On the night my son died, in our home, they were celebrating their victory.

I stood in the doorway, my eyes fixed on Sophia’s coat hanging from the staircase banister.



Right where Gale used to love to slide down.



Footsteps sounded from upstairs.



Adrian descended the stairs gracefully, with a disheveled Sophia trailing behind him.



When they saw me, Adrian's eyes narrowed slightly.



""Elena, you're back."" His gaze swept over me. ""Your scent… it's different.""



He studied me, a flicker of confusion in his eyes before they iced over once more.



He straightened the cuffs of his shirt.



""Never mind. It doesn't matter. There's something I need to tell you.""



I clutched the bundle in my arms tighter.



""Tomorrow afternoon at two is my official mating ceremony with Sophia,"" Adrian announced calmly. ""The pack Elders will preside.""



""Mating ceremony?"" my voice was a rasp.



""That's right,"" Sophia said, linking her arm through Adrian's, her face glowing with triumph.



""We'll be formally bonded before the altar of the Moon Goddess. You're welcome to come. Though…""



Her eyes landed on the bundle in my arms with disgust.



""And what is that? Are you dragging that filth into my home now?""



I carefully placed the bundle on the coffee table.



""Gale is dead."" My voice was quiet, but it echoed in the silent living room.



Adrian paused his cuff-adjusting for a second, then continued.



""Elena, this act of yours is getting more and more pathetic.""



""Acting?"" I couldn't believe it. ""My son is dead!""



""Enough,"" Adrian said, his gaze cold. ""Are you still sticking to that lie? How could my bloodline not have regenerative abilities?!""



""He's really dead!"" I screamed. ""Head trauma! He bled out!""



""Then why are you here?"" Sophia sneered. ""If he were really dead, wouldn't you be busy burying him?""



She had a point.



If a child truly died, what mother would come home so quickly?



""Elena,"" Adrian shook his head. ""I can't believe your stubbornness. You've become a pathological liar.""



""It's not a lie!"" I lunged for the bundle, wanting to unwrap it and show them.



But Adrian grabbed my wrist.



""Elena, drop the act,"" his grip was like iron. ""I'm not changing my mind because of your threats.""



""Sophia will be my one and only Luna."" Every word was a dagger in my heart. ""Pack your things. Be out of here by tomorrow.""



""This is our home!""



""No, this is property of the Blackwood pack,"" Adrian corrected me. ""You were merely a temporary resident.""



Sophia smirked.



""Elena, don't be so tasteless. You've enjoyed a life that wasn't yours for eight years. You should be grateful.""



""I gave everything for this family!""



""Gave?"" Adrian scoffed. ""What did you give? You spent my money, lived in my house, and used my status to show off.""



""I suppressed who I am for you!""



""That was your choice.""



I looked at this man, the man I had loved for eight years.



The way he looked at me now, it was like he was looking at a crazy stranger.



""I told you, Gale is really dead,"" I tried one last time.



""Elena,"" Adrian's voice turned dangerous. ""If you repeat that vicious lie one more time, don't blame me for what happens next.""



""Slander?""



""Making up your child's death to get sympathy, what else would you call it?"" Sophia stood up. ""Adrian, don't waste any more time on this woman.""



I looked at the bundle on the table, which seemed to radiate a cold stillness.



No one believed me.



Even my son's death was just a performance in their eyes.



On the back of my neck, the fake mark, battered by the raw power of my unleashed royal blood, began to flake away like dead skin, revealing the pure, unblemished skin beneath.



""I'll go,"" I said, struggling to my feet. ""But you will regret this.""



""Regret what?"" Sophia laughed. ""Regret getting rid of a nuisance like you?""



I walked toward the door.



""Just you wait.""



————



Adrian's POV



The next afternoon.



The Blackwood pack's mating ceremony was held at the ancient altar of the Moon Goddess.



The Elder's voice boomed, reciting the sacred vows as every pack member watched the holy moment.



The statue of the Moon Goddess looked solemn in the candlelight.



""Adrian Blackwood, do you willingly accept Sophia as your mate…""



The ceremony was proceeding smoothly.



But Adrian couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong.



Elena's behavior yesterday…



He had assumed she was just struggling to accept his relationship with Sophia and was acting out for his attention.



But today, she was nowhere to be seen.



He had planned to wait until this was over, until he had the full power of an Alpha, to go and explain everything to Elena.



The mark was fake, but his love for her, he told himself, had never been.



A wave of panic suddenly washed over him.



""Where is Tyler?"" He suddenly remembered telling Tyler to go help Elena last night, but he'd never heard back.



The mind link wasn't connecting.



He sent Tyler a text.



Go check on Elena and Gale. See what they're doing.



The ceremony continued.



""And now, the couple will exchange vows…""



Just then, Tyler burst into the ceremonial grounds.



He was pale, his forehead beaded with sweat.



""Alpha!"" he cried, rushing to Adrian, his voice trembling. ""Something's happened!""



Everyone stopped and stared.



""Gale… Gale is really dead!"" Tyler's voice was practically a shout. ""I just confirmed it with the hospital!""

That’s called **association rule learning**, and it’s been around for years in retail.

I decided to apply the same logic to affiliate marketing, specifically for **larger programs or networks with at least 15 offers and 20 affiliates**.

Here’s how it works in this context:

If multiple affiliates tend to run *Offer A* **and** *Offer B*, then when another affiliate starts running *Offer A* but not *B*, the system flags *B* as a potential recommendation.

This helps answer questions like:

* What other offers should our affiliates try?
* Which combinations tend to perform well together?
* Are there patterns we’re missing because the data is too big to scan manually?

It’s not a silver bullet and it's only one of the many machine learning models I use, but it’s been surprisingly effective at surfacing cross-sell opportunities inside affiliate programs and networks. It's the kind of insights you’d probably never spot if you’re just using Excel or Google Sheets.

1mn7b05,https://i.redd.it/z158lsxoncif1.jpeg,СТЕНДАП Як я почала заїкатись|Stand-up: How I Started Stuttering,"Було колись, що ви…

Було у вас колись таке: прокидаєшся, п’єш каву…
і розумієш — все, що сьогодні скажеш, буде або неправильно, або з затримкою в 3 секунди.
Я не знаю, чим я ображаю Бога. Але після першої кави в мене зникає вміння… говорити як людина.
Серйозно. До кави я — майбутній лауреат Нобелівки з філології. Після — людина, яка заїкається навіть на слові ""заїкається"".
Ніби тіло зарядилось, а процесор — ні.
Я не завжди заїкалась. Раніше я тільки думала, що говорити небезпечно.
В садочку я казала не “пити”, а “ви не хочете мені дати водички, бо я тут трохи помираю?” Я в 4 роки до всіх людец старші за мене на “Ви” зверталась.
Зараз я виросла — і просто заїкаюсь. Прогрєс!
Мене часто питали: “А ти що, нервуєш?”
Та ні, це я так думаю. З паузами. Глибоко. Художньо.
Просто щоб ви встигли поважати мене до того, як я дійду до суті.
І ще… Знаєте, коли це найнебезпечніше? Коли викладач каже: “Ганна, прокоментуй”.
І поки я починаю: “мммм…ммм…”, він уже: “Так, ясно. Сідайте”.
А я ж просто хотіла блиснути думкою. А вийшло — лише лобом об парту.
Колись одна подруга сказала:
“Ти іноді заїкаєшся так... ніби твоя мова проходить кастинг перед тим, як вийти в етер”.
І справді. Я не кажу одразу — я запускаю бету-версію думки, перевіряю на багаї, і тільки потім — реліз.
""Ганна, яка в тебе думка?""
""ммм...ммммм...ммм...моя думка п-п-поляг-полягає в...ммм...""
""в мовчанні блін”.
Зате дуже зручно!
Якщо не знаєш, що сказати — просто зависай.
Люди думають, ти в роздумах. Ніхто не здогадується, що в голові просто: ""Буфер обміну порожній"".
І от.
Мій викладач. Він той самий тип чоловіка, про якого ти не знаєш — ти його боїшся, поважаєш, чи таємно уявляєш з ним спільний PowerPoint. Він — як антибіотик: потужно, місцями боляче, але загалом ефективно. Ми з ним працювали над темою, яка звучить складніше, ніж моя нервова система.
Я приходжу до нього після безсонної ночі:
> ""П-п-пане, я тут т-т-трохи п-п-підготувала м-м-ммм...""
І він такий:
""Ой. Ти заїкаєшся... Можливо, я тебе трошки перевантажив?""
МОЖЛИВО???
Це як казати: ""Я трохи переоцінюю свої сили"", сидячи на коні, який уже згорів.
І я така:
 “Ні-ні, що ви, я просто ррррр…раціонально дддд…диференціюю.”
А насправді — хочеться лягти під стіл і вдавати ксерокс.
Але наука — то ще пів біди. Побут — ось де мій триллер.
Уявіть: ти в кав’ярні. Кажеш:
""Ммм...м-м-м-м-мммм-макіято, будь ласка.""
Бариста:
“Ой, не хвилюйтесь. У нас не страшно. Все добре.”
А я не хвилююсь! Це просто мій мозок вирішив поігнорити Google Translate, Siri і логіку одночасно!
А ще гірше — знайомства.
Мене питають: “Як тебе звати?”
Я така:
“Г-г-г-г-Ганна.”
І все. Вони думають, я або тікаю від ФБР, або робот.
Знаєте, кажуть: мова — це відображення душі.
А в моєму випадку — відображення внутрішньої паніки. Мені подобається думати, що заїкання — це мій внутрішній цензор. Такий собі строгий редактор, який каже:
 “Стоп. Це звучить тупо. Давай ще раз.”
І поки я переформульовую… всі вже пішли.
Я не лікую заїкання.
Бо, чесно, мені здається, що це частина мого стилю.
Це як шапка у Шерлока — спочатку смішно, потім — чарівно.
І ще: іноді я заїкаюсь — і це допомагає.
Якщо не хочеш відповідати на питання — просто зависни.
Як комп'ютер.
Люди одразу:
 “Окей, окей, все, не пояснюй, ми зрозуміли!”
АПЛОДІСМЄНТИ. І КАВА БО В ПОНЕДІЛОК У ШКОЛУ.

EN:
Have you ever had this?
You wake up, have your coffee…
and realize — everything you say today will be either wrong… or with a 3-second delay.
I don’t know what I did to upset God. But after my first coffee, I lose the ability… to talk like a normal person.
Seriously. Before coffee — I’m a future Nobel Prize winner in Literature.
After coffee — I stutter even on the word “stutter.”
It’s like my body charged up, but my brain didn’t boot yet.
I didn’t always stutter.
Before, I just thought talking was dangerous.
In kindergarten, I didn’t say “water.” I said, “Would you be so kind to give me some water? I’m slowly dying here.”
At 4 years old, I was talking to everyone older than me like they were the Queen.
Now I grew up — and I just stutter. Progress!
People ask me: “Are you nervous?”
No, I just think… with pauses. Deeply. Artistically.
So you have time to respect me before I get to the point.
The most dangerous moment?
When a teacher says: “Georgia, what do you think?”
And while I’m like: “mmm…mmm…mmm…”
They’re already: “Okay, sit down.”
I just wanted to say something smart — but instead, I only hit my head on the desk.
One friend told me:
“You stutter like your words are auditioning before they go on air.”
And it’s true. I don’t speak — I launch a beta version of my thought, check for bugs, and then release it.
“Georgia, what’s your opinion?”
“mmm…mmm…my opinion is…mmm…”
“Okay, so… no opinion.”
But hey — it’s useful!
If you don’t know what to say, just freeze.
People think you’re deep in thought.
They never guess your brain is just showing the spinning loading icon.
Once, I came to my professor after a sleepless night:
> “P-p-professor, I… I prepared m-m-m…”
And he goes:
“Oh, you’re stuttering… Maybe I gave you too much work?”
MAYBE??
That’s like saying, “Maybe I’m overreacting” while your house is already on fire.
And the worst part? Not school — everyday life.
In a coffee shop:
“Can I have a…m-m-m-macchiato, please?”
The barista:
“Oh, don’t worry. You’re safe here.”
I’M NOT WORRIED! My brain just decided to ignore Google Translate, Siri, and logic at the same time!
Dating? Even harder.
Someone asks: “What’s your name?”
I’m like:
“G-g-g-Georgia.”
Now they think I’m either hiding from the FBI… or a robot.
They say speech is a reflection of the soul.
In my case — it’s a reflection of inner panic.
I like to think stuttering is my personal editor.
“Stop. That sounds stupid. Try again.”
And while I’m rewriting… everyone’s already left.
I don’t try to cure it.
I think it’s part of my style.
Like Sherlock’s hat — first it’s funny, then it’s kind of charming.
And sometimes, stuttering helps.
If I don’t want to answer a question — I just freeze. Like a computer.
People go:
“Okay, okay, never mind, we get it!”
APPLAUSE. And coffee. Because Monday means school.

I am willing to do some swapping (e.g. swap the small drawers and table for a bigger chest of drawers for storage) and some minor additions (e.g. small room divider between desk and bed for monitor light) based on suggestions and if they work better in the suggested/current layout.

Important notes: Heights of items are unknown but a list of everything I could find is at the bottom, if that is helpful. The closet is built-in the wall with an inward opening door. There is a radiator across the wall between the closet and the door. The 'tall table' will have a mid-sized TV hooked up to the PC for YouTube in bed. The desk will have a PC under it and a monitor on top. The chair size is unknown.

Actual items I could find names for:
'Coffee Table' - IKEA Lack TV Stand
'Desk' - HOMCOM Computer Desk with Display Stand
'Tall Table' - IKEA Desk LAIVA 
'Bookshelf' - Unknown 3 tier wooden bookshelf approx. 70cm tall
'Small Drawers' - IKEA 2 Drawer ASKVOLL
'Low Table' - IKEA Lack Table
'Tall Bookshelf' - Very similar to Habitat Compton 2 Drawer Bookcase",1,1754900256.0,floorplan,0,1.0,False
