1njuh04,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZephyrusG14/comments/1njuh04/comparison_zephyrus_g16_oem_brick_vs_slimq_240w/,Comparison: Zephyrus G16 OEM brick vs SlimQ 240W compact GaN charger,"Note: all comparisons & measurements are for Zephyrus G16 2025 5070ti, but I assume the brick is identical for all 2025 & 2024 models.

**TL;DR:** SlimQ charger is similar weight & cable length, but the brick is smaller & takes up considerably less table space, the cables are more manageable and supple, and the whole package is more compact for packing. SlimQ also features 2 USB C PD ports. A nice upgrade for travel.

# Comparison Table

|Charger|Brick Size (LxWxH mm)|Brick Volume (mL)|Weight (g)|Useable Charging Length (m)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**OEM**|165x75x25|309|672|\~3\*\*|
|**SlimQ**|127x63.2x33|265|682\*|\~3.2|

\* Includes the G16/G14 adapter & cable wraps. Probably equal weight without wraps

\*\* The OEM cables are much stiffer so when unwrapped stay a little kinked. Would take a bit of force to stretch them straight, then maybe \~3.1 m

# Written Comparison

* The SlimQ brick is smaller and takes up considerably less space on, say a small table at a coffee shop
* Did not realize how much I hated the stiff cables on OEM charger til now. Pain to use, have a mind of their own. The permanently attached part also makes it tougher to pack
* The softer cloth-braided cables on SlimQ are waaaay nicer
   * Pack down much smaller and fully detach from the brick, making the whole package much more packable
   * Much easier to use & navigate around and over obstacles since they're more flexible
* Additional 2 USB C PD ports on SlimQ is very nice for charging your phone or other devices
* The weights & usable length are about the same

If you travel a lot and use your laptop in more ""challenging"" places, and you have the funds, the SlimQ is a no brainer upgrade. Otherwise if you're mostly tied to the same desk when you plug in, you can skip it.  


**Notes:**

* You may have read about the SlimQ charger messing with the Zephyrus, causing trackpad issues, etc, but that was due to lack of grounding pin and it's now fixed
* You need an adapter (also from SlimQ) to work with Zephyrus. Wish the adapter was nicer
* The G14 OEM brick is, I believe, 200W (G16 is 240W) and smaller & lighter than G16 OEM brick. The 240W SlimQ is heavier and around the same size, probably not worth it: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ZephyrusG14/comments/1ljld4q/slimq\_240w\_vs\_stock\_charger/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZephyrusG14/comments/1ljld4q/slimq_240w_vs_stock_charger/)

The items used in actual cooking often have very little overlap with the items for snacking or quick meals or drinks that everyone else uses the kitchen for, so separating them seems to make sense. Instead of awkwardly trying to fit a microwave into a cook space, have it in a separate snack area. Maybe a separate fridge for drinks, ice cream, frozen meals, and the like.

Basically the idea is to focus the actual kitchen on cooking and keep random people from wandering through in search of a drink.

He’ll shut down completely and go silent or ignore the conversation/ say it’s not the right time no matter how gently i say it or in a way that avoids any demands or in a way that avoids a controlling tone, if i bring up how his behaviour (particularly pushing and crossing clear boundaries with other women) sometimes triggers me into feeling insecure or uncertain about if he respects me or not, i’ve never received empathy for this

BUT he will let me know how he feels insecure about someone/ something and expects me to be present, receptive and caring at the drop of a hat. He will throw accusations, speak in a raised voice and make claims that i’m untrustworthy.

- He will lie repeatedly and emotionally cheat and hide a “friendship” for months until I find out by accident, causing me to feel so devastated and betrayed. He will apologise, say how much he regrets it, blames himself and says how he’s an idiot, how he’s lonely and that we were not in a good place etc. but will not willingly talk to me about it afterwards without me pressing him to talk about it (where he will get angry and defensive) he will not suggest ways to repair or how to be different moving forward. He will invite me to bring up issues and do the emotional labour instead.

BUT afterwards I will (probably stupidly) share with him honestly a time where I was not as truthful as I should have been - no cheating, but not telling him the history of my connection with a male friend I met up with for coffee who I was intimate with on one occasion long before we met but I know platonically now - he will blow up regularly about how much it destroyed his trust and how I probably would have never told him and what else could i be hiding, lying about, maybe i could be cheating on him presently? followed by intense interrogations of how my story isn’t matching up, how I should go away and sit and reflect on myself and understand why i did what i did and then come back to talk. He even repeated things I said to HIM word for word after he cheated, which I found actually quite harrowing? 

So many more examples but I don’t want to write huge paragraphs. It’s excruciating watching a person think they are exempt from boundaries and standards of compassionate communication but demand you to “stay in line”. You ever do something slightly wrong, unethical, not as caring as you have been usually? They’ll expect you to pay for it, and they’ll never let it go, ever.

Dylan woke up really early Monday morning because he pissed on himself—no flyhole—and he had like, a panic attack.

He was pacing around the house talking to himself and trying to get out of the fursuit. I could hear him crying inside the bear-head, and for some reason he was holding the remote control to the TV. He was twisting it as he walked, the plastic creaking inside his thick paws.

“We’ll get you out of there,” I tried to tell him.

Steven was already up, putting towels down on Dylan’s mattress to try to soak up some of the piss. He had already stripped the bed and put the sheets in the hamper; I got them and put them in the washer. A shirt and a pair of blue jeans were hanging from a clothesline strung across the inside of the utility closet, because there was no dryer.

When I came back, Steven was rummaging around in Dylan’s kitchen. I asked him what he was doing and he said he was looking for something better to cut the bear skin. I sat back down in the living room and finally talked Dylan into sitting down too. I almost wish I hadn’t, because he smelled like popcorn butter.

A few minutes later, Steven came into the living room carrying something that looked like a Geiger counter.

“No,” said Dylan.

I was still rubbing sleep goop out of my eyes. “What is that?”

Steven held up a six-inch serrated blade and pushed it into the end of the Geiger counter until it clicked. “It’s an electric turkey carver.”

Dylan got up and left. “No.” He went into the bathroom.

“It’s got to work,” said Steven, following him. I went too. Dylan tried to shut the door in our faces, but Steven stuck his foot in the way. “We’ve got to get you out of that suit. I can hear your stomach growling.”

There was a brief pause as Dylan considered it, and in that space I did indeed hear it rumble.

“…Okay.”

Dylan let go of the door and put the toilet seat down with a clatter, then the disheveled-looking bear sat on the edge of the bathtub.

“While I do this,” Steven said, sitting on the toilet, “I want you to call that asshole Eric and ask him what the fuck is going on with this costume.” He handed me his cellphone and unlocked the thumbprint lock. “It’s the last number I called.”

“You don’t need the power cord,” said Dylan, one handful of claws pointing at the cord in Steven’s other hand. “It’s battery-operated.”

Steven put the bundled-up cord on the sink and started the turkey carver. It was an antique-looking Ostermeier or Osterman, something like that, I think his mom probably gave it to him. As soon as it kicked on, the bathroom reverberated with a raspy roar that sounded like firefighters were cutting someone out of a car with a reciprocating saw.

“Oh, fuck me,” said Dylan. He held out his arm. “Come at it at an angle so you don’t saw straight down into my arm if you get through—”

*“When* I get through.”

“—When you get through the suit.”

Steven took hold of the bear’s wrist and eased the blade down onto the back of Dylan’s forearm. I didn’t say anything about how the tilted angle made it look like Steven was cutting off a slice of Thanksgiving turkey.

Grateful for the excuse to leave, I went into the living room and called Eric.

The phone rang seven times before he picked it up. When he answered, he sounded pissed, like I’d interrupted something. “Yeah? What do you want? You want your money back?”

“I just want to know what’s up with this fucking suit. It won’t come off.”

“What?”

“It won’t come off. Did you put something on the inside of the suit? It’s like it’s glued to his skin. We can’t get it off of him and scissors won’t go through it.”

“Bear skin’s tough.”

“I get that. Listen, did you say it was some kind of Creek shaman costume or something?” I could still hear the turkey carver humming in the other room, and every time Steven bore down on it the noise would deepen and chug like a lawn mower hitting wet grass.

“Coosa. And shaman ain’t a word. Well, it is, but it ain’t a Indian word. It’s a racist word, is what it is—”

“I don’t care. I just want to know more about the medicine man part. Does that have something to do with why it won’t come off? The head won’t even pull off. We got it to come off once yesterday, but it took forever, and then for some reason he put the fucking thing back on and now it’s really stuck.”

“Kid,” Eric seemed to relax. I could hear him moving around, like he was walking somewhere, and he inhaled sharply, as if he was taking a drag off a cigarette. Then his voice became a little clearer, and he spoke a little slower. “That whole thing about the Coosa medicine man? That was bullshit. I just made all that up to get y’all interested in it. It’s really just something my daddy made back in…oh-three, I reckon. He used to make taxidermy stuff, oh he makes all kinds of snakeskin belts and boots.”

“What? You lied?”

“Yeah. It ain’t no Indian costume, it’s just some crap my daddy made. He died last year and I been keepin his shit around the house ever since…but here lately I just really needed the money and I thought—well, I figured I needed the money more’n I did the suit.”

“Why the lie? We were already interested. You were only asking forty bucks for it.”

“I had it up on the innernet for like six weeks, y’all kids are the first ones to actually show up to come look at it. I figured it would sweeten the pot if I told you it was an antique Cherokee medicine man suit.”

“I thought you said it was Coosa.”

“Yeah, Coosa,” said Eric, taking another hit off of what I imagine was a joint.

“You can’t even get your own lie straight.”

“I ain’t no damn book-writer.” His voice sounded strained, as if he were holding in the toke, and then he let it out with a luxuriant sigh. “Listen, boy, if you’re callin to ask about gettin your money back, I can’t do nothin for you. I ain’t got it no more.”

“That’s not why I called. I don’t care about the money. I just want to know how to get the suit off and why it got stuck in the first place.”

“I don’t know nothin about that.”

The turkey carver groaned in the bathroom. I could smell the raunchy chemical stink of burning hair. “Are you sure?” I asked Eric, heading back down the little hallway. “Because I think you’re full of shit.”

Dial tone. He’d hung up on me.

“You son of a bitch,” I said into the deaf iPhone as I stepped into the bathroom. The air was smoky and the room stank like a combination of a barbershop fire and a wet dog. Jacob was up. I guess the noise from the turkey carver had woke him up.

“How is—” he started to ask me, but as soon as I walked in the turkey carver broke through the bear-skin and cut into Dylan’s arm with a horrible bogged-down *ZZZZHANK!* noise.

The blade stopped vibrating. Inside the carver, the motor just hummed like a live wire. Blood sprayed once up the wall and Steven pitched the turkey carver into the sink. He jumped up off the toilet and stood there, speechless, his hands shaking. He’d managed to cut through the suit fabric, all right—and straight down into the top of Dylan’s forearm. The only reason the carver had stopped was because the blade had hit bone.

Through the narrow gap in the fur, I could see the dark red pulp of bisected muscle, like the inside of a pomegranate, shot through with what looked like thin scrambled eggs, yellow and curdy.

Blood pattered on the white tile floor in big rainy watercolor drops. Dylan banshee-howled. “JESUS FUCKING CHRIST I SAID YOU WERE GONNA CUT ME YOU ASSHOLE!”

All three of us stood there in shock, watching him bleed on the floor.

“DO SOMETHING!” shrieked Dylan from inside the bear-head.

I put down the phone and snatched up the carver’s charging cord, winding it around Dylan’s arm just above the elbow. Then I scanned the bathroom for a stick, which turned out to be the toilet plunger. I unscrewed the stick out of it, then slid it through the charging cord and twisted it like a crank until it was as tight as I could get it, creating a tourniquet.

Steven was still standing there in the bathroom doorway, his eyes unfocused, his hands clenched into half-open fists at his sides. “911.” He seemed to snap out of a trance and he picked up the phone.

“We don’t have time for that—”

Dylan was bleeding all over me and the floor. “And I don’t have money for an ambulance,” said his muffled voice from inside the bear-head.

“—So come on,” I said, turning Steven around and pushing him into the hallway with Jacob, “we’ll drive him there.”

 

\*    \*    \*

 

We went straight to the emergency room and admitted Dylan. The nurse that took him and the receptionist at the front desk told us we couldn’t go into the back because we’d just be in the way, but about a half hour after we set up camp in the waiting room, a cop showed up and started asking us screwed-up questions about whether Dylan had tried to commit suicide and why he was wearing the bear suit.

I tried to tell him that he wasn’t trying to commit suicide and that he was stuck in the suit, but he didn’t seem to believe either one of those factoids. Then he told us we weren’t allowed to see him or take him home until somebody could determine that he wasn’t going to be a danger to himself or anybody else.

We kept talking at the cop until I think we convinced him that it wasn’t suicide—but then he got it into his head that Dylan was on some kind of drugs. Once he got that in his head, he started paying real close attention to us, and he even shined his flashlight in our eyes to look at our pupils.

God I hate cops.

After he decided we weren’t on PCP and took a hike, I borrowed Steven’s phone to type my previous post; I had a lot of downtime sitting in the hospital waiting area.

Steven went to see if the nurses had changed their minds about letting us see him, but Dylan was gone. Apparently he’d gotten up in the middle of the night and went to get something out of the vending machine by the elevators, but he never came back.

I still don’t know how Dylan got out of the hospital without us or the cop seeing him, though at that point I don’t know if the cop was still here. He said he went up to keep an eye on him, but I think he was just faking us out so he could leave.

That was Monday night. I worked Tuesday and went to bed as soon as I got home.

About 2 in the morning I woke up because someone was unlocking the front door of my apartment. I sat up and listened and wished I’d had the forethought to keep a ball bat by the bed. I used to, but that was when I was living over closer to Oxford, in the “bad part of town.” You’d be surprised with it being Alabama: prostitutes, drug-dealing, Bloods, dudes shooting squirrels out of trees for food.

Guess I’ve been out here long enough to kick the ball bat habit. “Who is that?” I asked my dark apartment.

A drawer opened in my kitchen. Somebody was rummaging through my silverware. Rattle, clash, bang, the drawer slammed shut. Another one opened. More rattling, more crashing.

“Dylan?” I asked.

I picked up the lamp on my nightstand and got ready to throw it.

Whoever it was came up the hallway, and the shadow coming off the streetlight in the living room window was huge.

My heart was already pounding but when that damn bear suit came lurching through the bedroom door, there was a sharp pain like a needle deep in my left armpit. Dylan’s silhouette stood in the door, holding a kitchen knife. Apparently the nurses had been able to remove the bear-paw on the side we’d—Steven, I mean—had cut him on, and that was the hand he was holding the knife with.

Shit you not, he looked six inches taller. The tips of the bear’s ears were brushing the top of the door.

He was just standing there with the knife.

“What are you doing?” I asked him. My voice cracked on the *doing.* “Why did you leave the hospital?”

He came toward the bed.

I threw the lamp at him, but it hit the end of the power cord and dropped on the floor with a *thud.* Dylan stepped on it and stood over my bed with the knife.

That theater-popcorn smell of piss rolled over me in a wave. I was already scrambling off the other side and into the crack between the window and the bed. “What are you doing?” I said, my hands planted on my duvet like a bulldog.

Dylan raised the knife to his face and started brushing the bear’s teeth with it, making a plinky sound like when you rake your fingernails up and down a hair comb.

“I’m so thirsty, Cody,” croaked Dylan, and I realized he was cutting the stitches hemming the bear’s mouth shut. “And hungry.”

I took him into the living room and finished cutting the stitches out of his—I mean, *the bear’s* mouth. Swear on my mother’s grave, he must have gained thirty pounds since Monday night. Was he always this big? Sitting on my futon, he looked like a giant. I felt like a little boy sitting in front of an adult. Did he play football in high school? I couldn’t remember.

As I worked, my eye traveled down to his bare arm. The hospital had stitched up the gash from the turkey carver. Betadine highlighted the skin around it in orange. His hand was covered in ugly road rashes like someone had been at it with a belt sander.

“Thank you for taking me to the hospital.” Dylan’s breath was labored, like he had pneumonia or something. “I told that asshole Steven he was gonna cut me.”

“Why did you leave?” I pulled the loose stitches out of the bear’s mouth after I cut them. The jaw didn’t swing freely, but I could pry it open with my hands, the yellow teeth long enough to jut up between my fingers. Packed into the bear’s mouth was what looked like a handful of dried moss.

“I was thirsty and I couldn’t get anything out of the vending machine.”

I dug the moss out with my finger and left it on my coffee table, where it looked like a clump of marijuana. “How did you get into my apartment?” I asked, as I took the knife back into the kitchen.

“You showed me your magnetic key-hide. Under the bottom step of the stairs going up to the apartments over yours.”

Instead of putting it back where he got it, I put the knife in the crock pot my ex-girlfriend and me got for our one-year anniversary. It was still in the box; I hadn’t used it since she left, but it would make a good hiding spot in case Dylan decided he wanted to rifle through my kitchen again. The rest of my knives went into the crock pot too: six butter knives, two steak knives, a rusty carving knife I accidentally left outside for a week last summer, and a paring knife.

For good measure I put all the forks in there too. I put the lid on the crock pot, closed up the box, and shoved it into the back of the cabinet. Maybe the pizza cutter wouldn’t be too dangerous, but the cheese grater went into the freezer.

Back in the living room, I pried the bear’s mouth open again. There was no bear-tongue, just a dry funnel of leather rimmed in teeth, but the back of its throat was walled off by what felt like a piece of cardboard or heavy paper.

Exploring it with my fingers, I found a hole in the corner behind the molar teeth where we’d stuck the straw to feed him Ensure. I hooked my finger in it and ripped the cardboard out, going back twice to get it all.

Dylan gasped, and hot breath washed over my fingers as I cleaned out the scraps of cardboard. Deep in the pit of the bear’s throat, I could see his mouth working. “Fresh air!”

I sat back to give him some space. “Now what am I going to feed you?”

“I don’t know,” Dylan’s voice said from the back of the bear’s throat. “I don’t give a shit. I don’t care. Something. Anything.”

A bunch of leftovers in the fridge, but not really anything I could push down the bear’s throat without making a mess—spaghetti, China Buffet, a jar of relish. Finally, I settled on a steak. I would have to cook it, but I could cut it up and flick it down his throat without too much of a mess.

“A steak?” he asked.

“Yeah. It won’t take too long. Just bear with me.”

“Jesus fucking Christ.” It sounded like he was about to burst into tears. “Are you messing with me?”

I caught my accidental pun and winced.

“Could you turn on the TV for me before you go?”

“Yeah.” I touched his hand with the remote control and he took it, started awkwardly flipping through channels with the bear-claws. I took out my Foreman and started the steak.

When I came back he was watching some late-night show. I debated putting steak sauce on the steak, but decided I didn’t want to get A-1 all over the inside of the bear’s head and just cut it up dry. He didn’t say anything as I worked, scraping and clinking, and didn’t say anything as I finished and sat on the table so I could see his face.

“You ready?” I asked him.

He was still silent, but he was breathing. His chest was rising and falling. I guess he fell asleep waiting on me. “I’m gonna feed you, buddy. I got steak here.” I forked a piece of meat and presented it in front of the bear’s eyes. God he was so fat. I feel bad about saying it now, but really I don’t remember him being that fat. Or broad-shouldered. “You awake?” I put down the fork and poked him in the ribs.

Deep inside the bear’s mouth, Dylan muttered something.

“What?” I put down the plate and leaned closer. He repeated himself. It sounded like *oh, sweejuh.* Maybe *oh sweet Jesus.* “What are you t—”

The bear’s jaws lunged at me. Hot breath hit my face.

As soon as his nose touched my forehead I recoiled, falling backwards off the coffee table, and scrambled up onto my knees. Somehow I still had the fork with the piece of steak on it, and some impractical instinct had me holding it up as a weapon. *“Oú suis-je?”* Dylan repeated, sitting up, and it hit me that he was speaking what sounded like French.

I didn’t know what to say, so I just knelt there in the floor, pointing the fork at him.

“I’m sorry, man.” He sat back again. “I musta fell asleep. Is that steak?”

Over the next hour or so, everything seemed to return to normal. I fed him the steak as we sat and watched Conan O’Brien, as well as a couple of microwaved bratwursts. About one in the morning I decided it was time to head back to bed. Before I went, I told Dylan that he was welcome to crash on my couch.

“You sure?”

“Of course.” I started to leave, but turned and told him, “When you dozed off earlier, you started speaking French.”

“French?” Dylan was dumbfounded. “I don’t know any French.”

Me and the bear stared at each other in confusion. I felt like I might be going crazy.

“I think I’m going to take a shower,” he said, getting up off the couch. “If I can’t get my dick out of this thing, I might as well take a shower. I stink.”

I didn’t ask him how he was going to take a shower with the bear suit on. To be honest I simply didn’t have the energy for that kind of logistical conversation.

This morning when I got up to get ready for work, Dylan was gone. I went to his place to see if he went home, but the door was locked and I beat on it for like twenty minutes.

I tried calling that Eric guy again from the landline in my apartment before I left—I wrote down his number while I had Steven’s phone at the hospital—but he’s not answering. So after work I’m going back to Roanoke, and back to that crazy-ass giant church to find his ass and make him tell me what’s up with this bear suit.

1njua4v,https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/comments/1njua4v/navigating_feelings/,Navigating feelings,"There’s this girl from work, Person A. I’m really interested in her.

The first time I really connected with her, I was trying to explain something and she just said “I know” while looking me deep in the eye. For the first time in years, it felt like someone actually saw me. That moment stuck.

Person A quit work for a little while then came back. After she returned, I regretted not asking her out so I asked for her IG under the pretense of sending jokes. It was an excuse to get close and eventually ask her out.

I then asked her out. On our first coffee meetup, it felt like a real date. We walked, talked, and I gave her a hug at the end. During that time we happened to mention exes. I guess I was prying a little to see if she was seeing someone. She said she had been with a guy for two years before moving here. The way she said it made it sound like they were clearly not together.

After that she went quiet for a few days. During that time I was going crazy. My stomach was turning, I could not sleep, I could not eat or I would eat way too much. Then, when we happened to work the same day, I overheard a conversation between her and Person B. 

•	Person B, who I had not considered particularly nice before, was telling her I had potential, that I was a good guy, and even that I smell good. 
•	Person A responded that she had heard things from Person C, who had started a rumor about me being obsessed with anime and pornography before she really knew me. I knew Person C quite frankly did not have anything good to say about me, although Person C seemed to act nice in person.

About a week or two after our first meetup, I gave her a gift. When I gave it to her she looked me in the eye with that same light I felt the first time I saw her, if not stronger, and told me I was extremely sweet and kind. Person B, who was there, even said, “you see, he does love you.” It seems like Person B is constantly vouching for me and I honestly appreciate that.

After she went ghost, she sent me a text apology. In it she mentioned hanging out with her boyfriend. I responded that I did not know she was seeing someone. That was the first time it really clicked that she was in a relationship. I felt like I had “read the room wrong,” but it also confirmed everything I had been sensing.

Through all of this I have been confused. I do not know if Person A is pretending she does not know how I feel, if she’s thinking about going back to her ex, or something else entirely. My mind keeps running scenarios that go nowhere.

Physically it hits me hard. 
•	My chest tightens 
•	My stomach flips 
•	I cannot sleep 
•	I either cannot eat or I eat way too much

I check my phone constantly waiting for a message. When she smiles a certain way I convince myself maybe she feels it too and then reality crashes in and I feel empty.

I have already told her once that I “read the room wrong,” but I felt like she knew the entire time, which is why she went quiet until Person B started vouching for me. Rationally that should have been enough, but my heart does not listen to rational. I want closeness more than anything. I want to share stupid little moments, laugh together, run errands, sit in silence and not feel awkward. That is what I crave, not just sex or attraction.

I do not want to sabotage her life or pressure her. I just want her to be happy, even if it is not with me. But I am scared I will disappear into myself if I stay close while carrying all of this. The tension between wanting her and respecting her space is tearing me up inside.

Part of me is upset. I keep thinking, you knew I had feelings for you. You clearly demonstrated that you weren’t with your guy. And then, as soon as Person B starts vouching for me and you apologize to my face, you randomly mention having a boyfriend? That felt like betrayal. It was like you couldn’t really say you didn’t want me. And when you said, “I’m sorry if I gave you the wrong idea,” after I said, “I must’ve read the room wrong,” it felt like an even deeper stab in the back.

Even when people vouch for me, I can’t find love. Part of me is so angry, but being angry is exhausting. I could never call things out because then I’d just be the angry bitter guy who got rejected, another example of men being “crazy” in women’s eyes. So all I do is lie in bed and softly cry myself to sleep. Somehow, she randomly finds a way to give me just the right amount of attention—responding to a joke or a funny video I send—and that drags me right back into the same cycle.

We still talk friendly. I mentioned that I still wanted to be friends, so we laugh, we talk about work troubles, and I  hang out with her when she’s bummed out about something. Even when there’s nothing to say, I enjoy her presence. I enjoy hugging her and feeling her hair brush against my face.

At the same time, part of me thinks, damn, I’m not even her man and we are like this. I could never fully trust her even if things did work out. Another part of me thinks, maybe I’m creepy, and she’s afraid to say something.

I can’t be angry because, honestly, what else can I expect? Do I want her to be direct and mean? Is that really what I want?

So I stay here softly crying, because these feelings I haven’t felt in years are being felt toward someone who doesn’t want me, and yet I still crave her presence.

Part of me is still happy she at least gave me a chance. Sometimes people just don’t click, and maybe because that was the first time a woman had treated me with respect and dignity, it hurts more. It hurts more maybe because she is a good person.

Edit: I need help, I can’t fucking sleep I just keep thinking about her. Typing in messages to her I’ll never send because they’ll make me sound crazy",1,1758156080.0,limerence,1,1.0,False

1nju7ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anticonsumption/comments/1nju7ij/overconsumption_in_the_days_before_the_internet/,Overconsumption in the days before the internet,"I made a post earlier about my newly discovered horror at learning about overconsumption related to Bath & Body Works products. And it got me thinking about how easy is it do develop hidden addictions to things now with the internet. 

There’s no real person outside of your household who really see you’ve ordered something from the same place every week, that you have a closet full of the stuff, that you order in large quantities every time you do so. These things occur silently and largely privately. 

By the time I was old enough to really be buying my own things without a parent, internet purchases were in full swing so while I remember always having to go to the store, I was just a kid so I wasn’t aware of hoarding or that some people would go to the store to buy items the way another person might go buy a coffee. 

So for folks who were out in the world working and doing their shopping pre-online shopping days - you encountered these behaviors face to face. Someone came into a store daily or weekly, did anybody say anything to them? 

Idk how fully to articulate that there’s something very personal and human about going into a store and buying 24 body lotions face to face and having to look somebody in the eye while you do that or becoming a regular someplace where it’s kind of weird to become a regular as opposed to just anonymously clicking on a cart online and I imagine the effects of that are very different to what we see now with online shopping and I’m really interested in any personal stories or insight people had into these types of behaviors when done in real life interacting with other people.

“Hey there, folks! Welcome back to *How to Speak American.* Today we’re tackling one of the trickiest dialects on the continent… the Great Lakes accent. You’ve heard it in Chicago, Detroit, Milwaukee, Cleveland. You’ve *felt* it every time someone asked you if you’re ‘gonna go up nort’ for the weekend.”

**\[Cut to a shot of a friendly but slightly bewildered tourist couple holding coffees.]**

“Lesson one: *Vowels stretch like summer daylight.*
It’s not ‘bag.’ It’s ‘baaaayg.’
It’s not ‘pop.’ It’s ‘paaaahp.’
Practice with me: ‘I put my baaaayg of paaaahp in the caaaaar.’”

“I put my… bag of… pop in the car?”

**HOST:**
“Nope. Again. *Baaaayg. Paaaahp. Caaaaar.* Imagine your mouth is a fishing net catching vowels.”

“Lesson two: *Questions always sound like an invitation to the cabin.*
‘You comin’ with?’ ‘We’re grillin’ brats, you want in?’”

**\[The tourist repeats one. Locals nod approvingly.]**

**HOST:**
“And finally, the secret handshake: calling every soft drink ‘pop,’ every freeway ‘the expressway,’ and every lake simply ‘the lake.’”

“You can’t learn Great Lakes in a day. But with practice, and a steady diet of cheese curds and Old Style, you’ll be talkin’ like a Sconnie in no time.”

The bar has been raised.

Just like when Doge and the likes changed the space before, the biggest runners will be this AltSeason will be those who revolutionise the game this time around.

Kendu has both IRL efforts and social media efforts expanding on the foundations laid by Doge. In my opinion, IRL efforts are the main way that crypto will evolve. AI use, bot use and general bad actors in the space have caused investors to be very wary before having a stake in the game. This is where Kendu comes in, IRL efforts are a perfect way to show **Proof of Humanity** and that Kendu is something real and physical that will not disappear in an instant

Yes Doge was a phenomenon and it had advantages like it being created so early and especially people like Elon Musk supporting it but this was no substitute for its amazing community that worked relentlessly on social media.

Here are Kendu's current IRL efforts(I might be forgetting some too):

* Kendu Coffee - A coffee company that sells both caffeinated and decaf coffee farmed in Brazil
* Kendu Energy - An Energy drink company that sells both full sugar and sugar free versions, this is the only product that I have tried. It is GREAT
* Kendu Merch - t-shirts, caps, hoodies, you name it!
* Kendu Hotdog Stand in Florida
* Kendu animation - a team that is making a short, Japanese style, animation series about Kendu, they have released an episode so far!
* Kendu games - a board game made by 2 chads
* Kendu Creator- a 3d printable mask that can be used to make videos online, this means you can showcase your skills whilst still remaining anonymous
* Kendu Jewellery
* Kendu Beer - not out yet, but it is in the making and the prototype is out
* Kendu Video Games - made by professional developers, this is not out yet but we have seen sneak peaks it will be available on Steam and 15% of the profits will be used to buy Kendu for their treasury. We also have a chad called Baba working on a game and Kendu the May who works on simpler games!
* Tattoos - A lot of holders have Kendu tattoos, I have a massive amount of respect for these people. There is 1 that I cannot show though : )
* Murals - Spray painted art
* Kendu Entertainment, a glow in the dark pickleball tournament in India that is gaining lots of traction within the sport
* Kendu Street Team, they have visited 3 festivals in Florida with the most recent one being Florida Groves Festival. They give away Kendu Energy, merch and they also create murals! SO much more is coming soon
* Kendu Vapes
* Kendu Plushies
* Kendu Vendu - vending machines in Nashville Tennessee, but available for worldwide shipping
* Kendu Press 
* Kendu Hand Cream
* Kendu Discs
* Kendu Sneakers
* Kendu Spice

As you can see this is an insane catalogue and all developed by the average person, there is no team in Kendu. This is all under 15 million market cap too! Once the average person has more money as Kendu's market cap increases, so many currently sidelined initiatives will be announced and released. There is gonna be a tsunami of new efforts.

The future is so clear and all the signs are there...

**Kendu is arguably the best investment you can make right now**

Dylan didn’t put the suit on until Sunday. Well, that’s a bit of a lie I guess—he put it on as soon as we got home with it Thursday, but only to see how it fit and how it looked, and took it right back off again.

He said it really was pretty clean and well-kept, and it just smelled like leather on the inside, and a little musty. Like an old cowboy hat. He said it fit like a glove. I have to say he looked pretty damn cool in it. The mouth is sewn shut so his voice is kinda muffled, but other than that it’s badass. That Eric guy’s family really did take good care of it. 

Saturday we went to OxFurred. Dylan left the bear suit at home that day because he said he wanted to do Saturday in his street clothes and Sunday in the suit.

The con was fun. I had a good time. I commissioned a piece of artwork of my fursona Codex. I mean, it’s not like the big deals—AnthroCon, Furry Weekend Atlanta, that kind of stuff—but the conference rooms at the Oxford Marriott are plenty big enough for our little event.

When I was a kid I used to go to local gun shows with my dad, and it was a lot like that, just tables and tables of merch and people walking around in costumes. Like DragonCon or ComicCon, I guess, just on a smaller scale, and it’s mostly furry stuff. I’ve never been to those other cons, but that’s what I figure they’re like from the pictures I’ve seen of them.

Both me and Dylan had to work Sunday morning but we got off early so we could go to the con. He went straight home and put on the fursuit, and we picked him up in Jacob’s 4-Runner.

He was quiet the whole way there. Dylan’s kinda shy, so I think he was embarrassed about wearing it, but he shouldn’t have been—he looked fucking badass, and it turned out to be a hit at the con. Everybody wanted to pet him and he won second place in the costume contest. The longer he walked around in the costume, the more relaxed he got, until he was dancing and joking around like everybody else.

I think part of that was because he could hide behind the mask and be someone—*something* else. Myself, that’s why I love situations where I can wear a mask, especially Halloween. I like stepping out of my own skin for a little while.

Around suppertime, I asked him if I could wear it. He said no, but he seemed unsure. We were in the Marriott parking lot then, me, Dylan, and Steven, walking to the Mellow Mushroom across the street. Dylan looked goofy walking out in the open air with his big bear feet flopping like clown shoes every time he took a step. 

“Hey, Yogi, do you mind I try the suit on for a little while?” I asked him. “After we eat?”

“I don’t know, Boo-Boo.”

“Why not?”

“It’s kinda sweaty in here. Probably stinks.”

“Maybe just the head, then. You have to take it off to eat anyway, right?”

He nodded, which looked hilarious. “Okay.”

It’s finally cold here, so we ate inside. It was quiet and there were only two other tables with customers because most everybody else was still at the con and it was probably kind of late for supper. The waitress gave Dylan a crazy look when she came to our table to take our drink orders, then cracked up. “What are you doing later?” she asked him. “I’ve never been with a bear before!”

“Once you’ve gone grizzly,” he said, muffled inside the bear head, “you never…go…shizzly?”

After the waitress left, Dylan planted his thumbs under the bear’s jaw. His posture made him look like his brain was about to explode. “All right, I think it’s time to come out of this thing.”

“Get out of my head, Charles!” I joked.

“It’s not funny, man.” Dylan strained, pushing at the bear’s jaw. “I think my head’s stuck. Like, my ears are hung. It’s catching under my ears.”

“At least *something* about you is hung,” said Steven.

The bear turned and deadpanned at him. Dylan got up out of the booth and continued pushing at the bear-head. “Here,” said Steven. He hooked his fingers under the bear’s jaw and hauled backwards on it several times.

“That hurts! Feels like it’s ripping my fuckin ears off!”

I grinned. “It’s just a little smaller than you thought.”

“That’s what she said.” Dylan braced himself against the table and the back of the booth. “Okay, let’s try again.”

Steven clutched the head and pulled. This time it came off with a rough slurp of leather.

“Ah! God *damn!”* Dylan came out wincing, holding his earlobes. His face was red and his eyes were glassy like he was trying not to cry. “Felt like you almost tore my ears off.”

The bear-suit was one whole piece like a bear-skin rug, so the head lay on his back like a jacket hood. He rubbed the top of his skull. His blonde hair was plastered to his forehead with sweat.

When we got done eating, we headed back to the con. It was getting late, so a lot of the people had thinned out and some of the tables were bare. Probably headed upstairs to sleep. Jacob and Ashleigh were sitting on the stage in a drum circle with three other people, playing a card game.

“You about ready to head home?” Steven asked Jacob.

“Yeah, just lemme finish this hand and we can go.”

Dylan had put the costume’s head back on, and he climbed up onto the stage (more of a platform, really, made out of nine interlocking pieces with a ramp on one side) where he lay on his back staring up at the ceiling and looking really introspective for a bear.

I sat next to him. “You okay?”

“Yeah. I guess. I just don’t feel good.”

“Maybe you should take the fursuit off. Are you getting too hot?”

“No,” he said, the bear’s head shaking back and forth. “It feels pretty good in here now that it’s dark and getting cold outside. Besides, I don’t have a shirt on. Just a pair of jogging pants, socks, and my underwear.”

About a half hour later, their game ended and we headed home. We all lived a town over to the north, in a neighborhood called Lenlock, except for Dylan and Steven. Dylan lived in an apartment complex a few minutes farther out, across from the gate to Fort McClellan, and Steven lived in Jacksonville, which was another ten minutes. We were just getting to the far side of Oxford when Dylan let out a massive fart in the front passenger seat.

“Jesus Christ!” said Jacob, turning down the radio. He was listening to The Weeknd at top volume. “That sounded like somebody jammed a leaf blower into a roast turkey’s ass. I heard it over the music.”

“I am *so* sorry.” Dylan sounded legitimately embarrassed.

Ashleigh leaned forward, talking over Jacob’s shoulder. “You should be! Did you shit yourself?”

“No. But I don’t feel good.”

“You all right?” asked Jacob. “I can pull over if you want.”

By this time we were on the main road, Quintard Avenue, a busy four-lane highway through the middle of Anniston, the town between Oxford and Lenlock. “No, it’s okay.”

“You sure?”

Dylan paused, the bear’s big mitts on the console and doorhandle. “Actually, yeah. I think I might…yeah, you wouldn’t mind pulling over, would you? I think I might puke.” The 4-Runner eased off the highway into a strip mall parking lot and Dylan got out. He stood next to the car with his paws on his shaggy brown knees, staring at the pavement as cars breezed past. I opened the door and got out.

“You probably want to take that head off,” I said, putting my hand on his back. “You don’t want to puke in it.”

“Okay.”

I grabbed the sides of the bear’s head and pulled.

Dylan’s whole body rocked forward. “Ow.” He braced himself against the inside of the 4-Runner’s open doorframe. I put my foot on the running board and pulled the costume’s head again. *“OWW! Quit pulling so fucking hard! My ears!”*

“Well, you gotta take it off,” said Steven.

“I guess.” Dylan sounded exasperated.

“What do you mean, you guess?” I asked, my palms still on the bear’s cheeks. “You got to get this off before you puke in it.”

“It’s warm in here. The suede is nice.”

I pulled again. This time he straight-up shouted, and then he let out another blatty tuba fart. He pushed my hands away and stood up, then paced back and forth next to the car. Must have been psyching himself up or something, because he went back to the 4-Runner, braced himself, and said, “Okay, try it again. The chest on this thing is getting tight. It feels like a girdle or something.”

As I grabbed the head, Dylan murmured, “Don’t worry about my ears. Just get this thing off of me, please.”

“All right,” I said, and pulled as hard as I could.

Dylan screamed like he’d been Tasered and came up out of the 4-Runner. He pushed my hands away again and pried at the bear’s jaw with the heels of his hands, hollering out loud. ”Fuck! It won’t come off!”

“Is it tied down or something?” I asked, and combed the fur around his neck with my fingers, looking for leather lacing.

“No, it just slips on and off! Or at least, it did.”

“Did your head swell?” asked Ashleigh, visibly trying not to laugh.

The bear looked back at her and started breathing really fast. I think he might have been having a panic attack or something.

“Are you claustrophobic?” I asked.

“No?”

“Let’s take Ashleigh home,” said Jacob. “Her mom’s been calling. After that we’ll take you to your house and we’ll figure out how to get you out of that suit, even if we have to cut the laces.”

Dylan got back in the 4-Runner and we took Ashleigh home. When we got to his house on the other side of Lenlock, he unlocked the front door and went straight to his cramped little apartment kitchen, where he opened a drawer and rifled through a bunch of junk. His claws clattered uselessly across things like marbles, a light switch plate, a ruler, an empty Glade plug-in.

“Damn, I can’t see,” he said, bending over, almost with his snout buried in the junk drawer. He stepped back. “Get me the scissors out of there.”

Steven got them out and spread the fur on Dylan’s chest with his fingers, looking for the laces. “There we are.” He slipped one of the scissor blades through the leather cord and cut it free, then the one under that. There were four knots in all, from the base of his neck down to just under his navel. He pulled the leather cords out as he went, leaving the little squiggles on the kitchen counter.

“Didn’t loosen it up any,” said Dylan.

The bear’s claws fumbled around on his chest as if he were searching his shirt pockets. I stepped in and pulled the fur on Dylan’s chest, hair tangled in both fists. Dylan himself lurched forward. I picked through the hair, trying to find the gap in the middle where I thought the opening should be, but there was just a tight seam like the stitch running down the side of a shirt.

“Is there a zipper?” I asked, running my fingers up and down the seam. “I don’t remember seeing—”

“No,” said Dylan. “No zipper. Just the ties.”

I pulled the bear’s chest hair again.

“Ow,” he complained.

“It feels like it’s either really tight, or like it’s glued to your skin.”

“What?” He massaged his chest again, and I realized he was trying to get his fingers into the gap in the middle of his chest. “Damn, I can’t grab anything with these claws.”

Steven pressed the tip of the scissors against the seam running up Dylan’s chest and tried to wiggle it through the gap and under the fabric so he could cut it. That didn’t work, so he pinched off a handful of the suit and closed the scissor-blades on it, trying to cut into it.

The bear-skin just slipped bluntly between them, turning the scissors sideways and almost breaking them apart.

“I don’t understand what the fuck is going on,” he said, annoyed.

Jacob came in as Steven started rifling through the other drawers in Dylan’s tiny, messy kitchen. “What are you guys doing in here?”

“The suit won’t open,” I told him. “We cut off the ties and it’s still, like, sealed or something.”

Steven found the silverware drawer, crashed around in it, opened another drawer.

Dylan’s claws clattered against the sink as he leaned on it. “You don’t think that Eric guy put some kind of glue on the inside of this thing, do you? Maybe it was some kind of prank. Man, I don’t have insurance. I can’t afford to go to the hospital.”

“We won’t need to go to the hospital,” said Steven. He had a kitchen knife in his hand. “We’re going to get this thing off you right now.”

“No,” Dylan said gravely. “You’re going to stab me. On accident.”

“He’s not going to stab you,” said Jacob, following us out of the kitchen.

Dylan sat on his couch, a shitty thrift store thing that looked (and smelled) like it was put together out of a dozen professors’ tweed jackets. “What about the glue, though?”

“We’ll find something that can dissolve it.”

His laptop was on the coffee table. I turned it around and brought it out of sleep mode as Steven and Jacob sat down on either side of Dylan. The living room was dark, but the kitchen knife reflected a flash of light from the kitchen. Jacob turned on the lamp sitting on the end table so they could see.

I opened a browser and hesitated. “I don’t know what kind of glue it was.”

“I never smelled nothing,” said Dylan.

“No chemicals, nothing?”

“Nothing but leather and dust. Just smelled old, I dunno. The inside of the fursuit was dry when I put it on, too.” He sat back and sighed. “Is there a glue that activates when it gets wet? Like, with sweat?”

“I wouldn’t know.” I didn’t, but I Googled it. “There’s something called Wet-n-Stick water-activated adhesive tape.”

Jacob shook his head. “I don’t think it was tape.”

“Water vapor activates Krazy Glue. Maybe he coated the inside of the suit with it, let it dry, and maybe his sweat re-activated it.”

Steven grabbed a handful of the bear’s chest hair. “Whatever it is,” he said, placing the knife against Dylan’s chest as if he were about to scalp his right pectoral, “I’m sure acetone will break it down. Acetone breaks down all kinds of glue…Krazy Glue, anyway.” He looked up. “My uncle owned a shoe shop when I was a kid.”

Dylan pushed the knife away. “Not there, not near my neck. Or my chest. I don’t want you slippin and stabbin me in the jugular.” He offered his arm, palm down. “If you can get through that, you can cut up toward my shoulder. Saw through the fabric.”

“What’s acetone?” asked Jacob.

“Nail polish remover.”

Dylan shook his head. “Yeah, I don’t have any of that here.”

Pinching off a bit of the suit again, Steven gingerly ran the knife back and forth across the top of Dylan’s forearm.

All he got was a handful of shaved hair.

“Keep trying.”

Steven cut a little harder. Cut some more hair off. By now the bald spot was about the size of a playing card, and the edge of the knife was scuffing back and forth across the surface of the leathery bear skin. He wasn’t even holding the skin with his other hand anymore, he was just sawing at his friend’s arm like he was cutting into a tree. “Man, this stuff is tough.”

“That’s enough,” said Dylan. “I’m afraid you’re going to cut through it and cut me.”

“I’m not going to cut you.”

“But what if you do? I don’t have a first aid kit here.”

“I won’t.” Steven took his wrist and started sawing at it like he was playing a violin, the blade making a *shicka shicka shicka* sound.

“I said no!” Dylan slapped at his chest.

Two of the talons on the bear suit caught in Steven’s shirt and ripped a hole in it. He leaned back and shot up off the couch, inspecting his chest. “Woah, okay, I’ll stop. Jesus.”

“Sorry.” Dylan put his big mitts in his lap.

After a minute, he got up off the couch. “It’s getting late and I’m sleepy as fuck. I’m about to pass out. We’ll keep trying to cut this thing off in the morning but right now I just don’t feel like dealing with it. If we can’t do anything with it then, I guess we’ll go to the hospital.”

“I’ll go somewhere as soon as the stores open and get some nail polish,” said Steven. “This is pretty much my fault…I’m the one that bought the fursuit.”

A bit about me: I’m a 27-year-old man, been training in bodybuilding for about 10 years. I’m 5’7” (1m71) and weigh 174 lbs (79kg) with around 10% body fat.
I had never taken any performance-enhancing or banned substances until Clenbuterol. I completed a 2-week cycle, and here’s what happened.

Positives:
•  My muscles felt much harder, very dense.
•  Incredible vascularity.
•  Reduced appetite.
•  Improved endurance during full-body workouts.
•  HUGE pump (almost too much).

Negatives:
•  Increased heart rate. Normally, my sleeping resting heart rate is about 40 bpm, but it jumped to 65 bpm, and could hit 100 bpm at rest right after taking Clen.
•  Trouble sleeping.
•  Constant feeling of being overheated.
•  Cramps.
•  SEVERE hand tremors: impossible to pour a spoonful of coffee without making a mess.
•  As I mentioned, the pump was excessive. Let me explain: I train for hypertrophy with slow, controlled movements to really feel the muscles. After 8 reps on isolation exercises like biceps or triceps at the cable machine, I had to stop because the muscle pain was too intense, and my muscles were overly pumped.

My Protocol:
•  Days 1-2: 10 mcg
•  Days 3-8: +10 mcg/day
•  Days 8-11: 80 mcg
•  Day 12: 60 mcg
•  Day 13: 40 mcg
•  Day 14: 20 mcg
During the cycle, I supplemented with electrolytes, magnesium, and potassium.

Results After the Cycle: I’m slightly more defined. Muscles feel fuller and harder, but nothing crazy—it’s not a miracle drug. I was already in a cutting phase.

Conclusion: Would I do it again? Definitely not. I don’t really know why I’ve tried it. For me, it’s not worth it. Too many debilitating and even scary side effects. I hated the tremors and the elevated heart rate.
I believe there are alternatives that, while different, are safer (Cardarine, SLU-PP, etc.).

1nju0rl,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChubbyTravel/comments/1nju0rl/just_checked_out_the_peninsula_istanbul/,Just Checked Out: The Peninsula Istanbul,"In Istanbul, location isn’t just important — it makes or breaks your stay. The Peninsula nails it with a Bosphorus address that puts the city at your doorstep and gives you the calm you want when you return.

**Location & Arrival**  
In Istanbul, location is everything — traffic can be brutal — and The Peninsula truly delivers. Set right on the Bosphorus on the European side, you’re walking distance to Galata Tower and just a quick ride to Sultanahmet, home to Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque. It’s the perfect balance: close to the city’s highlights, with the calm of the waterfront when you return.

**Rooms & Suites**  
The Peninsula Istanbul’s rooms and suites are spread across four buildings — three restored heritage properties and one new build. Each has its own character, but all carry that Peninsula polish: modern design, smart tech, and an aesthetic that blends sleek lines with subtle Turkish touches.

We stayed in an Executive Suite in the Main Building, just above the lobby and bar. The suite was excellent, but if views are the priority, go for a Bosphorus Room on a higher floor (helps with street noise) in the Karaköy Building (the northernmost wing). These have the clearest river views and more privacy — especially the Superior Bosphorus and Grand Deluxe Bosphorus Rooms.

**Food & Beverage**

* **The Lobby** – Breakfast on the Bosphorus doesn’t get better. Also home to the signature Peninsula Afternoon Tea.
* **Gallada** – Chef Fatih Tutak’s rooftop spot blending Turkish and Asian flavors, with views that steal the show.
* **Topside Bar** – Next to Gallada, the go-to for sunset cocktails (and people-watching).
* **Boutique & Café** – Coffee, pastries, or something quick to grab on the way out.

That said, with Karaköy and Galata right outside your doorstep, you’ll probably spend most evenings exploring the neighborhood’s dining scene — and that’s half the fun.

**Spa & Gym**  
The spa is housed in the Karaköy Building, one of the restored waterfront heritage wings, and it’s a real standout — with hammams, treatment rooms, and a gorgeous indoor pool. The gym is bright and well-equipped, and the outdoor pool deck sits right on the Bosphorus. A perfect reset between sightseeing or nights out in the city.

**Honorable Mention**  
If you’re in Istanbul on a Sunday, don’t miss brunch at The Lobby. It’s become a bit of a who’s who of Istanbul — popular with locals, great for people-watching, and set to live music that makes for a lively, elegant afternoon.

**Who We’d Recommend It To**  
The Peninsula Istanbul is a strong choice for first-time visitors who want easy access to the city’s landmarks without giving up comfort, and for return clients who already know the city and want a polished, calm base to come home to. It works beautifully for couples on a romantic city break, culture seekers who want the sights at their doorstep, and loyal Peninsula guests who will appreciate how seamlessly the brand translates into Istanbul.",0,1758155343.0,TrueChubbyTravel,0,0.5,False

***Reposting to avoid the unnecessary comments and negativity that my previous post received about being REFINED SUGAR free. This can also be 100% sugar free depending on the chocolate you choose! 

1 bar of Wild West Dark horse organic dark chocolate 70% cacao (any sugar free chocolate bar will do) 2 tablespoons of butter The following measurements may not be super accurate but you can eyeball most of these ingredients to tastezit will still turn out good! :) 3 tablespoons raw pistachio butter (wilderness poets) 1/2 cup of gluten free corn flakes 1/4 teaspoon Salt 1 tablespoon tahini Chocolate bar mold (preferably a Dubai mold as these are deeper than a regular chocolate bar)

1.	⁠Melt butter
2.	⁠Crush cornflakes slightly, not too much as you don’t want them fine. I crushed them on a plate with a coffee mug.
3.	⁠Combine cornflakes, butter and pistachio butter, tahini & salt in a small bowl. Set aside.
4.	⁠Setup double boiler to melt half the chocolate bar: fill up a small pot with water and set to medium heat. Use a heat resistant glass bowl or jar and place in the water. I like to use a mason jar lid ring and set the bowl on that in the water so the bowl doesn’t move around. It just makes it easier to stir and melt the chocolate.
5.	⁠Once melted, pour the chocolate into the mold and spread evenly.
6.	⁠Freeze for 10 mins
7.	⁠While that’s freezing, melt the other half of the chocolate bar.
8.	⁠After 10 mins, spread the pistachio-cereal mixture over the frozen chocolate and spread it so it’s flat. You may have extra left over or not, it’s up to you if you want the filling super thick! I also recommend leaving small gaps on the sides if you want the chocolate to completely cover the sides of the pistachio filling. It’s not a huge deal if you don’t, as most of the chocolate will spill over and cover most of the sides.
9.	⁠Pour the melted chocolate over the pistachio mix and spread evenly
10.	⁠Freeze for 40 mins and then leave it out to warm up just a bit before enjoying!",4,1758155330.0,glutenfree,0,1.0,False

My last relationship was two years ago and since then, I've been out of the dating scene due to my career, a period of depression, and fear of another messy breakup. I don't have much social media either, and being a workaholic and natural homebody, I'm not really going to bars or trying to meet people. 

Ive come to the conclusion that I need to get myself out there and try this again. Dating apps suck and I'm really looking for real companionship and love. 

Some stuff about me: I'm 32, white, 5'8"", long dark curly hair, dark blue eyes and wear glasses. I take care of myself and have impeccable hygiene. I work out four times a week and keep myself in really good shape. Been told by many that I'm handsome or hot by friends/coworkers both men and women. STI free and looking for the same. Personality wise, I'm pretty quiet and reserved, with some nerdy interests and topics I can blab about under the right circumstances. You can imagine why dating apps don't work for me...

I work in Manhattan for a well known tech company and currently live in Suffolk County. Well off financially and also financially savvy. I trade stocks often and have made a healthy nestegg for myself. I live on my own in a condo.

Hobbies wise I'm into a lot to keep busy. I'm a tech nerd and like to build computers and play PC games. I love RPGs, FPS games, some moba stuff (recently got into Deadlock) and others. I love vintage electronics, especially stereo equipment and old computers. I am also a big music fan who listens to just about everything (rap, r&b, rock, metal, classics, some jazz). I repair electronics as a hobby and enjoy restoring equipment when I can. I love to cook, making myself meal prep, and would love to cook you a delicious meal for a date night. I'm also an avid reader, I love sci-fi, some fantasy and non fiction. Currently collecting tons of books and vinyl records. Big on thrifting in general. Estate sales in the Hamptons can have hidden gems.

I'm looking for the following:

25-35, Woman, height/weight proportional (sorry, not into bigger women), physically active. A career or successful business and financially independent. Beautiful in your own way and confident to offset my shyness is a huge plus. Located in the City or Long Island. Looking for someone to grow with or trying for long term. Some similar interests and hobbies would be great,  but I'm happy with chill vibes on the couch, watching a TV or movie while cuddling or making out when we can see each other... Dinner and Movie Dates are lovely as well.

My ""fantasy"" if you want to call it that would be a nice night on my couch, watching old sci-fi movies or shows, with a bowl of freshly made popcorn in our pajamas. Cuddling, kissing, maybe further if you're in the mood, but falling asleep in my arms and waking up with you the next morning...

Send me a chat here if you're interested. Please send a picture at some point and will do the same. Happy to arrange a date or to grab coffee before taking anything further. ",0,1758155117.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,0.5,False

I wanted to share my recent experience shopping for an electric fireplace since I know many of you are probably in the same boat as winter approaches. After spending countless hours researching and comparing different options, I finally found some great deals that won't break the bank.

I remember sitting in my living room last winter, feeling that something was missing. The space felt cold and uninviting, and I knew an electric fireplace would be the perfect solution. But man, some of those prices I saw initially were absolutely insane!

Through my research, I discovered that electric fireplaces have come a long way. They're not those tacky-looking things from the 90s anymore. Modern ones come with realistic flame effects, adjustable heat settings, and some even have smartphone controls. Plus, they're way more energy-efficient than traditional fireplaces.

The best part? I found this awesome website https://athometouch.com/electric-fireplace that has a huge selection of electric fireplaces at really reasonable prices. They have everything from wall-mounted units to freestanding models, and even some with built-in TV stands.

Here's what I learned during my search:

1. Size matters - measure your space twice!
2. Consider the heating capacity (most units can heat 400-1000 sq ft)
3. Look at the installation requirements
4. Check the energy efficiency ratings
5. Read actual customer reviews

One thing that really surprised me was how much the prices varied between retailers. Some places were charging almost double for the same exact model! That's why I was so relieved when I found https://athometouch.com/electric-fireplace - their prices are super competitive, and they often have sales running.

I also love that electric fireplaces are basically plug-and-play. No need for expensive installation or chimney maintenance. Just plug it in, and you're good to go. Plus, you can use them year-round - with or without heat - to create that cozy ambiance.

For those worried about electricity costs, most models use about the same amount of power as a coffee maker when heating, and practically nothing when just displaying flames. My electricity bill only went up by about $10-15 per month during heavy use.

Safety was another big factor for me. Unlike gas or wood fireplaces, there's no risk of carbon monoxide, no real flames to worry about, and most units have automatic shut-off features if they get too hot.

Hope this helps anyone who's been on the fence about getting an electric fireplace! Feel free to ask any questions - I've become quite the electric fireplace nerd over the past few months!",1,1758154997.0,AtHomeEssentials,0,1.0,False

Let's talk about the idea of ""optimizing"" your life. It sounds so... huge, right? Like you need to wake up at 4 AM, meditate on a mountain, and build a seven-figure business before breakfast.

But what if the real secret is way simpler? What if it's not about a total life overhaul, but about tiny, almost unnoticeable course corrections?

Think of it like a ship leaving port. If it adjusts its course by just **one degree**, it ends up in a completely different country. That one degree is your small change. It feels like nothing at first, but the long-term impact is **HUGE**.

We're all chasing better **Focus**, more **Energy**, and a deeper sense of **Joy**. So, let's break down what those one-degree shifts could look like:

*   **To Boost Focus 🧠:** Instead of trying to ""just focus"" for 3 hours, try the 'one-tab rule'. For the next 25 minutes, you're only allowed to have ONE browser tab open. That's it. It's a small change that forces single-tasking.

*   **To Boost Energy 🚀:** Forget the crazy new diet. Tomorrow morning, before your coffee, just drink one full glass of water and stand outside for 2 minutes. Get some sunlight on your face. That's your energy kickstart.

*   **To Boost Joy ✨:** You don't need a week-long vacation. Before you go to sleep tonight, write down *one* good thing that happened today. Or send a text to a friend telling them you appreciate them for a specific reason. Tiny effort, massive emotional return.

Of course, sometimes the biggest hurdle isn't knowing *what* to do, but getting past the internal static that stops us from doing it. The anxiety, the overwhelm, the lack of a clear path forward... that stuff is real, and it can derail even the smallest habits.

Honestly, getting the emotional and mental foundation right is the real first step. If you're feeling stuck on that front, I found **this resource (affiliate link)** to be incredibly helpful for creating a personalized plan that actually addresses those underlying roadblocks.

So, let's get a discussion going. What's the **tiniest** change you've ever made that had a surprisingly massive impact on your life? What's your go-to ""one-degree shift"" when you feel off-course?",1,1758154960.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

Nothing too bad happened to lead us to break up, I wanted to move to pursue an art career, there have been no openings here, and started to feel torn, I know he wouldn’t be happy moving yet as he just started his life with his new job, finally lived around family and friends again when we met. I’ve worked so hard to achieve this career, and I know those who love me will support it so I still kept applying in other states. The timing of us meeting each other was not great.

This is something we knew about each other before he asked me to be his girlfriend. We were together for a year and half. We cared deeply for each other anyways. He said he had been looking for something like this for so long, he can’t believe he found it, I felt the same.

I reminded him and his family of their aunt that took her own life, not too long ago. They were very close to her. This hit me deep for some reason. She also has this adventurous, creative, friendly spirit I’ve been told. And I just so happened to get close to his mom, I spend a bit of time alone with her. His mom told me I’m a lot like her sister too. Following the breakup I also needed up living with some mutual friends of the family who was also close to this aunt and who said I also remind them of her.

Eventually strain of our lives pulling us different directions led to our breakup, our communication became unaligned and we decided to part to break the cycle of me feeling anxious and reaching forward and seeking reassurance knowing what I really needed to do was focus on my career even if that meant moving. I was just afraid of the life changes to come, so I decided to try to pull back and stay comfortable. I started to lose myself. His inability to express what he needs and wants clearly mixed with some of my own miscommunication flaws built up, So we decided to end it not out of lack of love, but out of wanting each other to be happy. He told me he loves me so he needs to let me go. I agree, I hate seeing him sad, I just want him to be happy. That he loves me and sees and we want the same things but he’s been dealing with a lot of self hatred and inner criticism, and just can’t do this anymore. This riffs were never hateful or extreme. I think we both felt sad seeing each other lose ourselves.

We align perfectly morally, have the same humor, similar life styles, like each others families, want the same things in life, and both have the same idea on where to settle down. We cherish and admire the things about each other who make each other who we are, the deep stuff, his love of music and nerdiness and loyalty to his family, and friends. His kindness and empathy toward everyone. The way he is a softie inside.

He admired my love for art, my deep love and care for others, my excitement about life. He always encouraged me to go for it, despite others having doubts about the reality of being a full time artist. He brought me flowers a lot, little gifts, traveled with me, became friends with all my friends, and vice versa. He had always been so calm patient, understanding, and attentive, cuddly, affectionate, that is until we started losing ourselves. I could tell, and he has told me he truly believed, valued, and respected me. Both of our parents saw this deep care we had for each other too. For the first time in a relationship I felt seen, deeply, and loved for the part of me that feels like me.

Following our break up we talked a couple times, we both felt like someone had died parting ways. We tried our best to not contact each other, as to not hurt each other further. We cried with each other two times bonding over that at least we know in some way we are going through this together. One time we fought, the first time we really really fought, no holding back, I felt hurt, he felt hurt.

We both felt bothered being on bad terms. Then two weeks ago I told him I am moving, we apologized to each other and forgave each other for the fight and met up for coffee. We both talked about what we’ve been up to, the dates we had went on while trying to move on, mine weren’t a good fit. His one date he said he felt like he was cheating, but he’s going to see it through, but knows he sees it going messy. He has been going to the gym everyday to cope. He started therapy as well. Then when saying bye we shared a look in the eyes, ya know the look. I asked to kiss him, he said absolutely and grabbed face, when we did, it’s like everything went quiet, it’s the most intense connection I’ve ever felt. And I’ve been through a couple relationships, but nothing like this one. Then we slept together. It was extremely emotional. Afterwards we texted about how we were feeling. We both felt extreme emotional whiplash. We both admitted we still absolutely care for each other no doubt. He told me he had been thinking about my cat the other day, and how he didn’t have the heart to throw out this one drawing I made him. He made me dinner, we cuddle a little, then hugged a couples times and I left. We both felt shocked.

But still decided that going different ways was the best thing for both of us right now. And that if the stars align and we both grow we would both be open to trying again.

A few days past and I started feeling sick to my stomach, I couldn’t get the kiss out of my head, I’ve never felt anything like that. I finally fully realize I am in love with him.

It was his first serious relationship, sometimes I wonder if when he starts to date again, he will realize what we had, grow and come back ready. But I know that is a fantasy not real life.

I move in a couple weeks, I feel weirdly feel calm and unthreatened by him dating. It doesn’t feel right to be together right now, but it doesn’t feel right to be apart forever.

I know the best thing for us is to let go right now, and build up myself and my own life, I’ve never had this hard of a time letting go of someone.

How do I move on from this and start my new life? It doesn’t feel right to not have him in my life. I’m not sure he feels the same. 

TL;DR 

Fell in love, broke up because of communications issues and timing. I know we still love each other. I don’t know how to move on.

1njts64,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/1njts64/mother_is_mentally_ill_homeless_and_we_have_no/,"Mother is mentally ill, homeless and we have no idea what we're doing","My mothers mental health has progressively gotten worse and worse over the past 10 years, the last 5 years she has had the most drastic decline in her mental health. She has not been officially diagnosed (we cannot get her to see anyone as she refuses to), based off the understanding we have and my sister-in-laws experience and knowledge as a nurse, my mother is hitting all the boxes for someone who has paranoid schizophrenia. She has had trauma in her life but also she is just not a nice person to be around. Every place she lived in she accused people of stealing her things (like toilet paper, and coffee....I'm not kidding) or people would snoop around her things, her paper work, that someone switched out a piece of her vacuum out to different colored one. She has stated her ex-boyfriend is actually Michael Jackson and the one who died is a fake. 

She has also accused me of dating her boyfriends anytime when I was dating someone, and we live in different cities 5hours apart. She demanded to know their licenses plates and the type of cars they have, her most recent claim was that the people she was working with are actually bionic robots and not really humans, the real humans were switched out.  I could go on, she hears voices and believes the government is out to get her and at one point she thought her ex-boyfriend was communicating with her in morse code through her emails. There is an endless list of irrational behavior, that have gone from one extreme to another.

Once a few years ago we took her to the emergency room because she kept asking us to call the police cause her ex-boyfriend is after (meanwhile we saw the texts where her ex told her to leave him alone, he then blocked her and we just saw a bunch of texts she was sending him that didn't go through). They didn't do much there, the on call psychiatrist saw her for a few minuets, and took a brief statement, gave her some medication and that was it. She took the medication for 2 days and then she started to lie to us about taking it, eventually she said ""I am not going to take those chemicals cause they are doing something to my brain."" Yeah they were probably starting to balance things out for her mentally and she thought that wasn't normal. 

Most recently she was renting a room from a co-worker who was nice enough to take her in and that did not last long as she started to accuse them of stealing her toilet paper.  She became homeless and lived in her car for the past several months, she would shower at her local gym. About a month or so ago she said that her job ended, she took it as the company closed one location and didn't have work to give her. Well turns out she was terminated with cause, which she did not register it in her mind. There is a language barrier as well with her (we live in Canada and she has lived in English speaking countries more than half her life but her English is subpar compared to what it could/should be).  She has little to no concept of reality or even remembering what she did and did not do. 

She was denied Employment Insurance because just cause for dismissal was found, and she does not understand the EI system, and she just thought she would get EI because its given for someone who has no work. With EI if there is misconduct proven that resulted in her being unemployed, then you are denied EI. In her termination letter it stated she was given 3 written warnings, which she didn't tell us about and again, we don't believe she understands what it means. She is staying with my brother and sister-in-law, who don't want her there but she has no where to go. Me and her do not have a relationship, I had an abusive childhood with her,  and the older I got and became independent from her, and the more I stood up to her the more estranged we became.  

She broke down and said things like she doesn't want to live anymore, and she has no place, she want's to unalive herself. We don't know what options we have since the system here only really does anything if she is a threat to herself and to others, which really means once she has committed the harm.  We even offered her to move back to our home country cause she would more likely get help there a lot faster there but she has nowhere to go there either. Her mother won't even take her in.

  
Its a very unfortunate situation, because it's a human being suffering and in an awful situation, but at the same she is a person we do not want around, which sounds awful, but its the truth. ",1,1758154673.0,schizophrenia,2,1.0,False

My next post will be of the filtering process and showing the final end product. This week has been good, there has been a few sunny days( especially today, was very sunny), but honestly there hasn't been any change of the garum itself, it's basically  ready,so it's just brownish liquid with some fish bones flowing in it at this point. And it smells very fish. But also has some meaty,umamish,mushroomi, sort of sweet smells( it's like hard to explain). I will be using the the setup shown in the last picture to filter the garum, I am using a metal stand mixer bowl to capture the hopefully the  clear garum. Then I have a very coarse strain out to strain out of the bones and anything else flowing in the liquid. Then I under the first strainer I will have a Filter Cone( specificallyAmerCareRoyal Econoline Filter Cones, 10"" Non-Woven) in a Large Professional Conical Strainer as the main filter. Then I will put it in a big plastic bag( bc of the smell) and let it sit over  a day and night. And let time and gravity do most of the work for me. And if the garum isn't 100% clear after that. Then I will put it through a regular coffee filter( witch is what I did with my two previous batches and it came out like 99.5% clear those times).I am honestly  not  at writing things like this but I just wanted to say thank you so so much for joining me on this journey/progress with me, it's really been so fun to see all interest that you have shown for this project. It's so great to see I am not the only one who enjoys this type of stuff. It has really made this project so much fun then my two previous batches. Thank you so much all the com comments and support.

We were supposed to grab coffee yesterday, but the night before I texted him and let him know I had connected with someone else and wanted to see where that went. I apologized for the last-minute change, but thought it was better to be honest than to waste his time.



At first he seemed kind of “meh, whatever,” but then a couple hours later he absolutely flipped. He sent me these super nasty texts calling me names, accusing me of “lining guys up” and “ruining his weekend,” and even said he had my info and I’d “regret it.”



I tried to de-escalate and just said I didn’t appreciate the threats, but he kept going. Then this morning I woke up to a text from a random U.S. number I don’t recognize. Now I’m feeling really uneasy.

1njtpx7,https://i.redd.it/drvxwfszftpf1.jpeg,Season 3 Finale Review,"My nervous system is on the verge of collapse thanks to Jenny Han. So. This review may not make much sense or potentially be as critical as it should and maybe that’s exactly what the production is counting on. The fact that our poor starved selves are so emotionally overloaded from the delayed gratification we forgive any other misgivings we might have. I probably should let it settle for a day or two or like maybe a couple of months.

My immediate thoughts are consistent to the extent that some part of me knows this episode descended away from drama into the territory soap opera, probably because the desire to provoke strong reactions outstripped the desire to tell a coherent story. I’ve already written a tome about that so I won’t dwell other than to say, I wish the writers and directors had trusted the interactions and tensions between characters more and did less to manufacture these TikTok-able moments and unnecessary plot twists.

However, whatever reservations I might have I can honestly say in the 15 minutes afterwards I felt like someone electrocuted me. Did the electric shock partially revive my Bonrad heart? Stand clear and keep reading to find out!

First I’ll say whatever had me bawling at the end, it was in spite of the first five minutes, where we see Conrad wait, patiently on the stoop like some sort of stray dog. Subsequently it is like watching someone kick that stray dog to see Belly first treat him like an inconvenience, and leave him waiting outside. He’s been on a plane all night and you don’t even invite him in, offer coffee, or let him peel off that wool jumper in the middle of summer? Shocked or not, he’s family. Basic hospitality, Belly.

Thanks production for the one last bit of rage bait for old time’s sake. It’s been real watching Conrad again suffer at the hands of Belly, who, interestingly, tells the audience in a wink-and-nod sort of way—twice—that she is the “villain of the story.” A position that is immediately undercut by Conrad, who reassures her that she was just a kid, with no obligation to hold his family together. Ok whatever you say Jan, I guess in absence of any other narrative accountability, it was nice to hear Belly have some self reflection over her own role in the triangle.

Let’s get Taylor and Steven out of the way early because this story line was more soporific than the lettuces in Mr Macgregor’s garden. Not sure what the point of introducing any mini dramas between those two was? Their arc was fully resolved two episodes remember? Oh wait, it’s to underline that Belly is not coming home for Conrad or because she needs to but to be with him because she wants and loves him. Or something like that. To be honest I can’t quite work out the syntax.

There has also been a lot of awkward instructional text from various characters signposting how we are meant to feel and providing exposition throughout S3 and this episode was absolutely brimming with it. When Jeremiah tells a well-meaning Denise “I think the anticipation was the worst part, but now that the Belly/Conrad reunion is finally happening, it’s not that bad,” I wondered if his fans might emulate Jeremiah’s own meltdown over the wedding cake at the thought of being told how to feel by the writers.

This seemed both condescending and pointless, a love triangle is supposed to hurt, no matter the reassurances you may try to pad it with. Someone’s gotta lose.

Mind you, Jere having found his culinary purpose, being affirmed by Adam and making a move on Denise seems to be doing ok, even if potentially he has some work to do on his self-esteem. What does Denise say again? Oh yes, that’s it “Call a Waahmbulence.”

Back to the main event and Belly and Conrad are taking in the sights, in what is essentially an ad placement for a tour company that appears to be able to facilitate time travel. Honestly marvelling at the capacity of the magic open-aired bus to be able to get to Versailles and the Louvre, and every other tourist destination in Paris all in the same morning, and navigate the insane traffic around the Champs-Elysées.

This sightseeing smorgasbord stops at the Louvre, where Belly gazes at the paintings and Conrad gazes at Belly — apparently more captivating to him than Delacroix’s Liberty Leading the People. By the afternoon the initial awkward distance between C and B continues to melt like a popsicle on hot pavement, their intimacy re-established at a rate suitable for a show that has 45 minutes to do a 360 degree turn.

By the end of the day her feelings revived by his immediate physical vicinity, Belly has sufficiently remembered she actually likes Conrad and invites him to dinner. Unsurprisingly, his good looks and charming manners naturally endear him to her new gang who begin to interrogate the nature of his beach confession with the intensity of…the internet. Moments like these made it hard to suspend reality and jolted me out of the episode on several other occasions.

We learn, so long Benito (phew) and the flirting between she and Conrad only increases until Belly’s resolve breaks like a dam in response to the smouldering Dr Fisher. Then, oh my! In a perfect reverberation of the guest bedroom scene we see those hands. Those hands and that watch. Speaking of hands. Is Jenny a sadist?? The whole while this is going on her “engagement” ring sits snugly on her index finger and you can see it as her hands roam all over Conrad. I’m gonna go out on a limb and say the small remaining strong hold of Jeremiah fans probably didn’t enjoy that??

All the lovely details in her apartment form a suitable backdrop for a love scene worth waiting for, the Ma chérie poster with the cherries, another proclaiming Bisou bisou, kisses my darling indeed! Most significant is the poster framed by Belly’s bed, J’adore La Lune. Ah you got me; twas not the sun, but the moon, and its tides that bring Belly and Conrad together once more: it is the night sky, the stars, the moon, infinity. Susannah may well have said “[Belly] looked at Conrad like [he] hung the moon,” but again, what is remarkable about the love scene is the way he looks at her.

The post coital scene seems like a full interrogation of every fan theory levelled at Bonrad, is this about Susannah, no. It isn’t. Is Belly giving up her life and dreams for Conrad? Nope not a chance and he wouldn’t want her to! It’s just about, two people who love each other so much it can never be forsaken. It doesn’t have to interfere with their growth or development, Belly discovers she can at last be herself, and in a last minute watershed moment remembers that who she is “loves Conrad.”

If the final scenes between Belly and Conrad feel a little like an affidavit, I probably forgive it, for the sake of clarity for those who couldn’t or refused to read between the lines. However, Jenny, the line “if there are infinite worlds, every version of me chooses you, in every one of them,” is so unequivocal a statement as to grind the Jelly fan fiction press to a halt forever. In every alternate universe be it television, film or literature, one thing is for sure, these two belong together. Boy, you sure as hell weren’t kidding when you replied “I would say so,” to the question about a definite ending.

For that I thank you. In the dying moments of the show we returned to the Belly we missed and who was sadly lost for the most part of Season Three, the girl who “knows her own heart” and whose mind will never be changed.

In a quiet nod to Before Sunrise, we see exactly how much can change for Belly in less than 24 hours, and it doesn’t end with an ambiguous farewell at a train-station. Instead, in a Bridget-Jones-in-her-undies moment, Belly chases a devastated Conrad into the night, finds the next train to Brussels, and finally — without reservation, literally and metaphorically — takes her seat beside him. Indulge me in imagining they nap there, snuggled together, Belly staying in Brussels for the conference while Conrad postpones his flight to stay with her in Paris for a couple of weeks.

Sure, it didn’t gel with the rest of the season — or even the start of the same episode — and yes, I have misgivings (you’ve read the other ten reviews, of course I do). Right up until the end Belly still seems one foot out, though this time with a believable explanation: she’s made a life for herself in Paris. However clunky the messaging, she learns the right person won’t expect you to give up yourself or sacrifice your dreams. You can be an independent young woman and still love your person deeply and forever.

Was it enough of a glimpse of the forever love that made me lose my mind in the first place? Well let’s put it this way, like Conrad, I regret nothing.

Was I in it for the right reasons? Maybe not. For me, Belly still feels unredeemable — those ridiculous levels of denial made her seem inconsistent and fickle at best, cruel at worst. The net result? No matter how much lampshading insisted this was Belly’s story, like it or hate it, for me the show was stolen by Chris Briney’s Conrad Fisher.

We’ve spoken about the undeniable onscreen chemistry between Conrad and Belly but maybe we ought to spend a moment too considering the real love affair playing out, all along in the peripheries of our vision. The one between Jenny and her character Conrad, who it seems embodies every desirable trait in romance history to become the uber paramour. Is there an exam he can’t pass? A roof he can’t fix? A period of separation he won’t wait out? And just when you think he might be a bit pathetic, there is the arrogant, and sultry sirocco of a summer breeze he can sometimes evoke, looking from under his lashes to remind Belly her favourite drink is cocoa and that on a warm summer evening, a million years ago she told him, in an echo of himself, that marijuana destroys white matter.

In this way and forgive me if I wax lyrical (I do, because it’s the end, and why not?) Conrad returns and gives Belly back to herself. He reminds her of what she truly holds dear, and offers a vial of Cousins Beach sand to anchor her to where, and with whom, home really lies. Remarkably, it is not “these people” she finds her way back to at the end of the show, but this man. However late, this ending affirms the story’s original premise: it is, and always was, a love story and the love story belongs to Conrad Fisher and Isabel Conklin. Despite the missteps and forks in the road, the faithful reader and the careful viewer always knew that.

Shout out is to everyone who came on a little journey with me this season and for those who read along even before that, thank you all for your time and your thoughts and your attention. You are what I enjoyed most about Season 3, this community and its bright and funny contributors.

Cosplay’s totally optional—what matters more is having fun, sharing laughs, and seeing where it leads. If you’re nearby, a casual coffee would be a great way to start.

She broke it off about 3 mo ago. We have spoken since. I could tell there was something wrong as she was a bit distant towards the end. She went away with her cousin on vacation and when she got back, she texted me  and told me she was done. No closure. No reason that made any sense. She must have told me 2-3 times while she was away that she loved me as we normally told each other constantly.

I respected her wishes and gave her the breakup. I didnt beg or chase her. I let her go and gave her the space and NoContact ever since.

3 months into NC and I think it's time for me to reach out. Maybe not a phone call or a text...but thinking I'll mail out a letter or a card. I dont know if she has moved on. i don't know if she still thinks about me. i dont know if she's waiting for me to reach out for some reason. I feel that sending a card and maybe saying that I will be at a specific spot for coffee...and if she feels up for a chat and would like to meet, that I'll be there on a certain date. No obligation. No pressure. 

I think about her day in and day out. I am having a really hard time moving on and letting her go. I feel that if I reach out and send this letter letting her know that if she'd like to talk, to meet me for coffee, and she doesnt show up....It might finally help me let go and help my heart realize that she's finally gone. IDK. We havent talked in months...can it really hurt if i try one more time? it might finally give me the closure I need to lay this to rest. ",2,1758154115.0,ExNoContact,2,1.0,False

Kaiserinma lamented every passing second. So much wasted effort. Everything had its end, it all had to burn. There was no choice. Its will would be done because it simply must. It was the truth of things, and no amount of heroic delusion would change it. A blade of blood struck the side of her head as the teenager managed a cartwheel over her half-sunken form. As her annoyance grew, so did the intense heat of her body.

Mikey swept a foot on landing to absorb the momentum and flourished his blade briefly before preparing for the final act. Sword held underhand, he made one last slash against the palm of his free hand to prepare a point-blank blood beam. With a deep breath, he ran into one final leap over his target and lead with an upward slash--

Kaiserinma burst from the water, an explosion of steam generating enough force to send her sailing past the hamon user. Mikey had no time to be surprised, immediately grabbed my his sword arm by a crushingly tight steel vice and dragged upward with the momentum. His breathing was interrupted by the shock, and the sudden wrenching of his weapon left him exposed. The machine pulled her free arm back, flattening its steel hand into a point to plunge toward the chest of the nuisance. A mercy granted to one so young, before they could see the same reality she did...

But her spear didn't move. For the first time since its horrifying birth, Kaiserinma hesitated.

That split second was all Mikey needed, the machine's chest was just as open as his was. He thrust his open palm toward her weak point, close enough to be singed from the radiating heat, and with one final deep breath let the beam rip.

The machine collided with the water while Mikey barely managed to land on its surface with precisely controlled breaths. He held his weapon at the ready staring at the impact point, slowly walking back to his blood boat while waiting for any sign of movement.

The ripples slowly faded into the spiral of the whirlpool. The machine was gone.

With a smug chuckle, Mikey tossed his blood blade into the water where his target lie, letting it revert to liquid and be lost. “Heh, looks like after all that I still won. You finished throwing your tantrum, you piece of shit?! You don’t even deserve forgiveness, you don’t even deserve retribution!"" Mikey spoke loudly, as if addressing an invisible audience. ""If you were any other person I’d have my speech ready to accept you for who you are. But what you are is nothing but an infant mad at their mommy and daddy. What’s the point of living in a world you don’t think is worth it? Why tear it all down? There's nothing to gain anyway.""

Between his words, Mikey's breathing was controlled. Concentration pure. He strode on the water's surface to climb out of the whirling pit as he continued. ""Out of all the monsters and undead I’ve ever faced, it turns out that something resembling any sliver of humanity was the worst of it all. You taught me a valuable lesson today… I’m not going to hesitate again. And I’m not going to hold back against bastards like you. I’ll train like hell until a single breath can evaporate you."" As he reached the lip, he turned to shout.

""My name is Mikey C. Hammer! And someone like you has no place in my story.”

Why?

As it hung suspended in the ocean beneath the vortex, Kaiserinma was lost. Its singularly driven mind was given pause, a sensation wholly foreign to it. She hated the silence, it let the weak and quiet be heard. Thoughts she never realized she had. 

Doubts.

If her work was absolute, then why was it met with such resistance? If it were inevitable, then how could she be cut down? If everything needs to be brought down...

*Why did she hesitate?*

Time passed without notice, she had no mind for it. Only the appearance of a familiar vessel and the sensation of being fished into open air brought her back to reality. Her wounds were severe, and her mind ill at ease. She would take care of both at once. Efficiently.

There was still work to do, after all.

**Scenario: The** ***MPV Indigo,*** **The Sea Near the Bahamas - 7:37 PM**

The sun had just begun to set over the horizon of the Bahamas. The dim orange of the evening sky created a unique sort of darkness, shaded by the very edge of the Earth. With time it continued to fade, the cold night taking its full form. The deck of the MVP Indigo did not have much in the way of shade, making it rather… unpleasant to spend a while upon during the day. However, during these times, a few of its below-deck members arise to take in something of relaxation.

Alouette’s eyes were fixed on the ocean. Her posture was unmoving, almost statuesque as she rested herself upon the railing. Despite her rather blatant outfit choices, she emanated an aura of silence about her that drew away even the eyes of the civilian crew. However, in spite of the silence others experienced around her, her mind was anything but silent.

*This mission… it’s been nothing but a drag ever since I got on this boat. I like being paid, I’m fine with not having to do all that much for that pay… it’s just these people are absurd. Are they all really trained professionals? Hell, the most supposedly “skilled” ones can’t help but get themselves into trouble. If it keeps up, it's all going to come around to Jeanette if people start looking. I thought having Speedwagon authorization was supposed to keep us safe, but now I’m just surrounded by greedy idiots-*

“What’cha looking at?”

The silence in the air and the soliloquy in Alouette’s head were both shattered by the grating voice of Alouette’s comrade… the thief called Century Love. Slamming a deck chair onto the floor, he sat himself next to her and kicked back, letting out a relaxed sigh of relief.

Alouette silently looked back at him for a brief moment without responding. She watched Century stare at her with a confused expression before she responded.

“Something in the distance looks weird.”

Finishing her prompt response, she turned back towards the horizon. Century, however, was nowhere near satisfied.

“What do you mean, ‘something looks weird?’ If you’re gonna answer a question, at least give an answer that means something!” Sitting up from his chair in resignation, he looked over the railing in an attempt to match Alouette’s eyes. He eventually landed on a small, distant island.

“What, is there something wrong with that island?”

“The lighthouse,” Alouette answered promptly. She let her answer hang in the air for a few moments before continuing. “The light turned on suddenly.”

Century squinted, looking at the light that provided some small illumination to the sea. “Really? That’s what’s got you so transfixed? Come on! Those things go off and on all the time!” 

“This area… isn’t supposed to have an active lighthouse,” Alouette continued. “If someone is there to turn it on, then there must be something strange happening.”

Century put his hands behind his back in a faux display of ignorance. “Oh, so you think we’re about to get busted by a giant flashlight, is that it? That we’re about to get spotted out? Have a little-”

“Quiet.” 

Alouette shushes him with one word and a finger. She stands there for a short moment, once again filling the air with silence. Century, however, is deterred only for a moment.

“Okay, now you’re just acting weird. Why’d I even bother with you…”

Alouette looked at him, puzzled. “Do you not hear that sound?”

Century raised an indignant eyebrow at her. “Oh, what now?”

“It sounds like… a song. A desperate song. Like the song of a siren.”

Century grimaces at her, and turns around. “Alright, now you’re just fucking with me. Unless there’s an enemy Stand right on this ship, I ain’t falling for your nonsense…”

As he moved to walk away, however, a prominent glint passed through his sunglasses. He looked over his shoulder to see a beam of light shining from the distance, aimed directly at them… illuminating the area behind him like a spotlight.

And Alouette had vanished completely.

“Well, shit.”

**Scenario: The** ***Love Shack,*** **The Sea Near the Bahamas - 7:42 PM**

""Mimi, not too far. You know the rules.""

Yoshimi nearly fell completely over from her dead stop at Sunday's words, groaning loudly while letting a baseball bat fall to the ground in her now limp grip. ""What the *heck*! You're the one that gave me the baseball!"" She looked to the far end of Bibo, just catching a glimpse of the still-rolling ball she had hit before it disappeared behind a clump of coral. She rolled her eyes. Great, now it was lost. May as well have disappeared entirely as far as the young girl's attention span was concerned. 

Sunday Shoes sat cross-legged some distance behind where the little girl had ran, paying just as much attention to the delicate brush strokes on the nail of her ring finger as she did her charge. ""I didn't say to hit a home run, did I? You did that yourself."" With a finishing touch, she gently blew on the fresh paint before giving her hand a shake-out. ""Nice one, by the way!"" 

Yoshimi marched back to Sunday, kicking up the sediment from Bibo's back as she did with a baseball bat lazily dragged behind her. Things had been quiet for La Isla Bonita since their stop in Haiti weeks ago, and while the rest of the team found the odd lead to chase in the wake of the King's commotion, Yoshimi was often left making the most of a lazy afternoon at sea. She had the entirety of Bibo mapped out at this point from all the wandering she had done, and despite Sunday doing her best to liven things up she had officially run out of things to do. 

""What am I supposed to do with this, then?"" Yoshimi lifted the bat to show Sunday, the whine in her voice clearly showing her frustration and boredom. 

""Well, what do you wanna do?"" Satisfied with her work, Sunday quickly packed away her paints and sealers. The quiet days had begun to eat away at her as well, though she couldn't complain about the results she'd gotten from all the painting practice. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Yoshimi raise the bat with an eye on a nearly clump of coral that seemed the perfect outlet for a frustrated child. ""Hey!"" The bat was brought down, but impacted the sudden appearance of a golden pentagon hovering over the fragile coral. ""None of that, alright? Don't take it out on poor Bibo.""

Her outlet stymied, the young girl let out another loud groan before falling backward into a sit, arms crossed. She pouted, looking up at the older woman with a glare.

Sunday sighed. Maybe some time ashore could reset both of their mindsets. A break from the extended break, sort of thing. Convincing the others to pause their pursuits for a day on land might be tough, but she was running out of ideas. She had a kid to entertain, and knew just how to go about it. ""Tell you what: Hide and seek. You win, we stop in the next city and make a day of it, my treat. If I win..."" She crouched down to the young girl, scooping up one of her hands and poking each of her fingers. ""You sit still long enough to let me practice on those nails of yours. Deal?""

Mimi couldn't help but giggle at Sunday's prodding, snatching her hand back before smirking to herself. Hide and seek? *On Bibo?* She knew every corner of the creature's back by now, Sunday wouldn't stand a chance. ""Okay! But you gotta get me some Blue Mountain! A biiig bag of it!"" 

That damn coffee habit. And where the hell did she hear about such an expensive variety? Suddenly, Sunday was regretting the idea. ""...y-yeah, we'll see. Go on, I'll count down from 20.""

""No, thirty!"" Yoshimi leapt to her feet, bolting for the far corner of Bibo as Sunday began counting backwards. She knew the perfect spot: a stretch of coral right on the edge she could duck under that was too small for Sunday. That day abroad was as good as hers, Sunday was sooo dumb to even suggest it. Squeezing through just barely, she sidled against the colorful pocket of coral with an open view to the ocean before her. 

Bibo happened to pass a small island at the same time, just a few hundred meters in the distance before her. She had to cover her mouth to stifle a squeal of excitement as she saw the tower standing firm and alone on its shore: an honest-to-god lighthouse! She'd never seen one before! Sunday had better hurry and give up, because she knew exactly where she wanted Bibo to stop. She watched in awe as the light drifted over the waters and toward where she sat, holding back another shrill cheer as it lit up her little hiding corner...

Her win over Sunday was secured as she disappeared a moment later.

**Scenario: Great Isaac Lighthouse, Bahamas**

Yoshimi & Alouette’s eyes were drawn open by the fading sunset light vanishing from a thin window above them. As they awoke, they both immediately took in their surroundings: white walls coated in dust, antiquated wood floors, old furniture… all crammed inside a practically miniature room. It didn’t take either of them long to notice the other, sat across from each other in wooden chairs.

“Woah… this isn’t the Love Shack! Excuse me miss, where are we?” Yoshimi speaks up first, her confusion overwhelmed by curiosity above all else. Alouette, however, remained initially silent.

Yoshimi looked Alouette up and down, a woman she’d never seen before sitting silently in front of her. Her massive jacket and sunglasses concealed much of her minute movements, but her fairly blatant head turns of confusion gave Yoshimi a hint.

“Ohh, I think I get it! You probably just got here too, right? This is really weird..!”

Yoshimi hopped out of her seat, and immediately began to search around the lighthouse, opening drawers and moving furniture with reckless abandon. Alouette finally responded.

“How did a kid get swept up in this..? Hey, kid. Where were you before you got here?”

Yoshimi looked over with a surprised face. “Oh, there you are! Well, last I remember, I was playing around on Bibo, and saw a big lighthouse out in the distance! The light shined really bright on me, and then I was here.”

Alouette pondered for a moment before responding. “So we both got pulled here by that thing.” She let out a deep, exasperated sigh before standing up herself.

“Something dangerous is happening here. We need to leave,” she stated punctually as she scanned the room for a door. Finding a staircase, she began to descend. She heard the voice of Yoshimi call out behind her again.

“Already? Aw… before you go, though, what’s your name?”

Alouette briefly looked behind her at the face of the girl that ended up in this situation with her. She was smiling.

*She shouldn’t be here. I shouldn’t be here, but that’s besides the point. Who even is she? What’s a ‘Bibo’ supposed to be? Does she know who I am? Maybe she’s the Stand user responsible for all this… but why am I sussing out a kid? I’m not here for a fight, I’m not even getting paid to be here… I need to get back on the Indigo. If I worry about the kid too much, I’ll just be more open to a second attack. If I stay any longer, I might get killed, and then Jeanette…*

Alouette spoke suddenly. “Alouette.”

Yoshimi chuckled. “Alright, Alouette! I’m Yoshimi! Nice to meet you!”

Alouette turned around silently without responding. Yoshimi followed her down the stairs, continuing unprompted. “You said something bad was happening earlier. Do you know what’s going on? I mean, if something bad was happening, I can totally take care of it! I know a bit of karate!”

Alouette remained stoic as the pair came to the first floor, which was hardly in any better condition than the second. Fortunately, as they came to the door, it opened rather easily for them, clearing the way for the empty island and the beach. It can’t have been very long that she was out: the Indigo should still be within viewing distance, even at night. Surely Century would tell people about…

As she stepped onto the beach, a deep sense of dread welled up in her chest. Stepping forward took considerable energy. It was like knowingly stepping into a gun’s line of fire. Eventually, she stopped.

“No… are we already under attack..?”

Yoshimi stood a ways behind her. “Hey! Are you looking for something? Or someone, maybe? I could help with that, probably!”

Alouette turned around, towards the lighthouse. Rather than that sinking feeling, as she stepped back, she felt a drive overcome her. The lighthouse… the lighthouse was the source of all this!

“We’re going back. Right now.” Quickly taking command of the situation, she stepped ahead of Yoshimi, walking quickly towards the front door. Yoshimi followed with a somewhat confused look.

“Huh..? Did you forget something?”

Alouette remained silent, though her mouth curled with frustration. She opened the front door…

The room was nothing like the way it was left. The walls appeared rusted and rotted. The lights flickered and dimmed. In the corners of the room, Alouette recognized the color and the smell of blood, seemingly leaking out of the building.

Yoshimi peered in from behind. “Woah… what happened? This place is so weird.”

Alouette paused for a few seconds as she analyzed the situation. “The building… it’s decaying. Whatever’s keeping us here is tied to this building. That feeling came from this building’s decay.”

Yoshimi did not respond at first, merely letting out a “Hm…” as she thought about the situation. However, she seemed to startle Alouette with a triumphant shout.

“Aha! I get it..! We gotta clean up the lighthouse and make it nice again! If we do that, then it’ll let us leave!”

Yoshimi rushed past Alouette inside the lighthouse. Immediately, she started sizing up the place. Alouette merely sighed.

“I think you might be right… but who knows how long it’ll take to properly maintain this place?”

Yoshimi quickly replied. “Hmm… about a week, if this calendar’s right!”

Alouette looked to where she was pointing: a calendar, with seven days marked, beginning on today’s date.

“Huh… I guess I’ll have to trust the building.”

Yoshimi turned back to Alouette. “Hahah! It’s kinda like a game! This’ll be fun!”

Alouette simply looked back to the front door. Yoshimi, however, was undeterred.

“Well, I’ll see you at the top! Ready, set…”

**“OPEN THE GAME!”**

**Location:** The Great Isaac Lighthouse on the Bahamian island of Great Isaac Cay! The area consists of an old-fashioned lighthouse connected to a two-story keeper’s living quarters. Maps of the [first floor](https://i.imgur.com/wd9132g.png), [second floor](https://i.imgur.com/XkfnEiV.png), and the [top of the lighthouse](https://i.imgur.com/TBaMsE3.png) can be found here - the entire building is roughly 24x15m, with each tile being 1.5x1.5m.

The lighthouse is attached to the keeper’s quarters by a small oil storage room. Downstairs are two sitting rooms, a kitchen, and dining room. Upstairs are two bedrooms with a shared bathroom. A small generator shack is attached to the main building from the outside which provides power for lights and small appliances. Heavy cloud cover makes it oddly dark at all times on the island, never getting much brighter than dusk even at high noon.

The lighthouse tower is about 15 stories tall with a spiral staircase leading up to the light.

Outside the lighthouse is a small complex of gutted, abandoned stone buildings, empty with only their walls and roofs left. The surrounding terrain consists of sand and rock.

**Goal:** 

Contribute more to the care and maintenance of the lighthouse over the course of a week!

The following basic tasks will need to be completed daily:

- The lamp at the top of the tower needs refueling at least twice a day or will go out, which involves a 15 story stair climb carrying 10 lbs of fuel. The passive Stand hallucinations will make footing treacherous and surprises unpredictable.
- The weight keeping the lens rotating needs to be reset constantly via a crank halfway up the length of the tower. It takes a few hours for it to fall completely to the bottom, so it must be reset at least that often to keep the lighthouse functioning. 
- The generator needs constant attention or will break, bathing the entire house in darkness and enhancing the effects of the passive hallucinations to a crippling degree. There is a manual explaining how to maintain the machinery located in the living area bookcase, while a half-dozen oil lanterns are stored in the kitchen area as a simple yet cumbersome alternative.
- Maintain the outer walls of the lighthouse from constant wear and tear. Time has strange effects on the building and will cause years of wear within a day. If left unchecked it could cause the building to collapse on itself and RETIRE both players. Repairs, painting, and preventative fortification can all be used to drive off these effects.

Food and drink are not a concern; the players’ bookcases in their respective rooms are mysteriously covered with a variety of nonperishable foods and plenty of fresh drinking water every morning. 

On day 3, the island will suffer an oddly localized and powerful electrical storm. The lighthouse and its surroundings will be assaulted by regular lightning strikes, making outside work and trips to the top of the tower extremely dangerous without proper preparation and care. Expect fires to be a concern for the entire day until the storm clears off just before bedtime.

Starting on Day 5 the island will undergo flooding. By the end of day 5 the sea level will have risen to two feet above the floor of the house, before worsening on day 6 to a full six feet and submerging the entire first floor. The generator will be permanently lost at this level of water, dooming the house to constant darkness for the last two days regardless of upkeep to that point. 

**Additional Information:** 

The lighthouse is affected by a passive Stand presence, centered on the building itself and extending across the entirety of the small island. The Stand manifests as a substance that slowly oozes from cracks in the brickwork of the oil storage room while the players sleep every night. Each player sees these hallucinations differently: Alouette is generally haunted by what she sees, the substance it as blood which is somehow fully controllable by [Human Radio], while Yoshimi sees everything in a more fantastical light such as the substance being a vivid green slime. Exactly two Alouettes (about 125L, calculated from her weight being roughly 63 kg) worth of ‘blood’ is made every night, which disappears the following night while the players sleep and is replaced with a fresh supply the next morning.

The ability affects those within the radius with a slow but steady barrage of sensory hallucinations and minor physical phenomena largely incapable of direct physical harm, at least at first. Victims will see and hear things that aren't there, feel tugs, pulls, or pushes at their clothing even when alone, and will generally be questioning what is real at any given time. These effects can be minimized with relaxing or otherwise mind-occupying activity or worsened with darkness or violent thoughts and actions. As it worsens, the danger to those affected increases as hallucinations become more vivid and eventually become capable of causing physical harm by tripping or even throwing objects with force across rooms.

A supernatural force is restraining both players to the island for the allotted time, a barrier preventing them from swimming more than a couple meters out from the beach.

Lifestyle changes weren't really applicable to me besides sleeping elevated, which has killed my neck and back and I have chronic pain there now. A super bland diet and PPI is the only thing that keeps it from flaring up. I can't go out to eat with friends, I can't get a drink with friends, I can't go for coffee with friends. I'm cooking every single meal which is difficult when you're depressed like I am. Some days I just don't eat because it's not like I can buy a microwave meal, and cereal makes me nauseous, so there's nothing I can fucking eat. No caffeine has left me exhausted when I get poor sleep. I'm paranoid about food. This shit has basically given me an eating disorder. I'm tired of eating the same few meals. I used to love cooking and going out to eat. Now I get no enjoyment out of it and it's currently my least favorite part of being alive. My GI doesn't even think it's GERD, she and I suspect LPR, but I don't have the money or frankly the mental capacity to find an ENT and go through more rounds of testing to probably get a shrug from a doctor and bills in the mail.

I'm so tired of this. I didn't even eat unhealthy before, I didn't drink more than twice a year, I have no idea why this happened other than possibly a round of antibiotics just nuking my stomach. I get so jealous seeing posts in here about how people cured theirs and it's a bunch of stuff I already tried that makes no difference.

Hey, it's me again! You guys went crazy for my Botox tips, so I'm back to talk about my other obsession: skin boosters. If Botox is my insurance, then skin boosters are my long-term investment. They’re what keep my skin looking dewy, hydrated, and just... healthy. As someone with thin, dry skin and a relentless quest to shrink my pores and hydrate my face, I've tried them all.

Today, I’m breaking down the three most popular skin boosters in Korea right now: **Rejuran**, **Hyalove Wave**, and **Revive**. Think of this as your personal guide to which one is right for you.

# 1. Rejuran Healer: The OG Pain Train

Ah, **Rejuran**. The undisputed king of skin boosters in Korea. It's made of polynucleotides (PN) from salmon DNA, and it's famous for two things: its incredible regenerative power and its legendary pain.

I've tried every trick in the book to make it less painful. I've done the long, 90-minute numbing sessions and even had it injected with the **Dermashine** and **Potenza** devices. Guess what? It was still excruciating. The pain is just part of the experience, a testament to its effectiveness, they say.

The payoff is real, though. After a full series of three sessions spaced a month apart, my skin felt noticeably more elastic, my pores were tighter, and my overall skin texture was so much smoother. It's not a one-and-done deal; you have to commit to the full series for the best results.

**My insider take:** If you have the pain tolerance of a warrior and are looking for serious, long-term skin regeneration, this is your holy grail. But if you can't stand needles and a lot of pain, you might want to consider the alternatives.

# 2. Hyalove Wave: My Current Obsession

Okay, let's talk about the new kid on the block that's completely changed my life. **Hyalove Wave** is the latest craze among my friends, and I can see why. It’s a hybrid between a filler and a skin booster. Its particles are much smaller than traditional fillers, so it gets absorbed by the body in about six months, which means you don't have to worry about a botched job.

But the real magic? Its hydration power is off the charts. Where Rejuran took three sessions to show results, I saw a massive improvement after just one **Hyalove Wave** treatment. My bumpy, acne-prone forehead texture from the humidity just vanished. It was an instant game-changer for me.

The one downside is that it’s injected with a **cannula**, which is a blunt-tipped needle. It can be intimidating for some, but trust me, the results are worth it.

**My insider take:** This is perfect for someone who wants the hydrating and plumping effects of a filler but without the long-term commitment. It's a fantastic option for a big event where you need to look flawless. Stay tuned because I'm planning to do a deep dive into the 3 different types of facials you need to try in Korea that cost less than your morning coffee!

# 3. Revive: The Sensitive Skin Savior

I'll be honest, I didn't see huge results from **Revive**, but my friend with atopic dermatitis swears by it. This skin booster is known for its excellent regenerative and soothing properties, making it a go-to for those with sensitive skin.

**Revive** is said to work wonders on people with thin, delicate skin, especially among Westerners who are prone to dryness. It's gentle, and while it might not give you the dramatic results of a Rejuran or Hyalove Wave, it focuses on strengthening your skin's barrier from the inside out.

**My insider take:** If you have sensitive, reactive, or eczema-prone skin, this might be your best bet. It’s all about gentle, consistent improvement rather than a dramatic transformation. I’m thinking about a series on the 3 best non-invasive treatments for double chins and jawline definition, so let me know what you think!

Have any of you tried **Revive** or a similar booster? I'd love to hear your experiences in the comments!",1,1758153750.0,K_beauty_insider,0,1.0,False

Thick black pages, plastic sleeves, Polaroids tucked between brittle corners. I used to flip through it when she was cooking or when I was supposed to be doing homework. Back then, I thought of it as proof that our family was normal. Birthdays, Christmas mornings, summer trips to the lake—mundane and ordinary, but comforting.

I didn’t notice him at first.

Why would I? When you’re seven years old, you don’t scan every photo like a detective. You look for your face, your siblings’, the dog. But years later, when I was visiting home after college, I picked the book up again. Nostalgia, I guess.

That’s when I saw him.

He’s in every photo. Not in a way that jumps out immediately. Sometimes he’s in the background, leaning against a tree. Other times he’s at the edge of the frame, blurred by motion. Once, he’s sitting two rows back at my fifth birthday party, in the McDonald’s PlayPlace seating area, staring directly into the camera.

The strange thing is: I didn’t know him. My parents didn’t know him. Nobody in the family knew him.

I asked my mom, laughing at first, flipping the album around to show her.

“Who’s this guy? He’s everywhere. Look, he’s behind Aunt Claire in the Christmas photo. Then again at the lake. And here, at the carnival—”

She took the book from me. Her fingers froze on the page.

“That’s… just some stranger,” she said finally, snapping the cover shut. “You know how people wander into pictures. He’s probably just…a coincidence.”

But her tone wasn’t casual.

She put the album back on the shelf and didn’t let me look at it again that night.

I couldn’t stop thinking about it, though. I lay in my childhood bedroom, staring at the ceiling, trying to reconstruct the photos in my head. He wasn’t family. He wasn’t a friend. He didn’t even seem to age—his hair was always the same length, the same style. His clothes never really changed.

The more I thought about it, the more I realized he wasn’t just “in the background.” He was looking. Always at the camera. Always at us.

And now I can’t shake the thought: if he’s in every picture… then he was there. At every moment. Every holiday, every trip, every birthday. Standing close enough to be caught on film.

Which means he was always near us.

Watching.

The next morning, I brought it up again. Over coffee, I said,

“Mom, seriously—who was that guy in the photos? You knew everyone else at those parties. The neighbors, family friends. Why didn’t anyone ever mention him?”

She didn’t look at me. She stirred her cup with this slow, deliberate rhythm, like she was buying herself time. Finally, she said,

“You’re overthinking it. It’s just someone passing through. People photobomb all the time.”

But her voice cracked when she said photobomb.

I knew better than to push. My mom has that way of shutting a conversation down, pressing her lips together so tight you can hear the finality in it. Still, when she left for work, I went back to the bookshelf and pulled out the album.

I sat cross-legged on the floor, turning pages carefully, like the paper might disintegrate in my hands.

There he was.

Always there.

Christmas ’94 — behind the tree, only half his face visible in the branches.

Family reunion ’97 — across the picnic field, sitting alone on a bench.

My high school graduation — dead center in the bleachers, eyes locked on the camera.

It wasn’t just that he was in the photos. It was that he didn’t change. The same dark jacket. The same haircut. The same posture, straight-backed, hands clasped loosely in front. My uncle had gone from full head of hair to bald. My cousins had grown taller, acne giving way to clearer skin. Even the damn dog had aged.

But not him.

I tried to be logical. Maybe it was some old family friend, someone I just didn’t remember. Maybe Mom was embarrassed, or there had been a falling-out. That would explain the secrecy, the tone in her voice.

But it didn’t explain the lack of aging.

I decided to test it.

I pulled one of the Polaroids from its sleeve — my seventh birthday. I took a magnifying glass from the drawer and studied the man in the background. The resolution was grainy, colors faded, but his expression was clear. Neutral. Almost pleasant. His eyes, though—his eyes seemed too sharp for the cheap film.

I compared it to the photo from my high school graduation. Same eyes. Same expression. The only thing that changed was how much closer he was.

At the birthday, he was near the back wall of the PlayPlace.

At graduation, he was right there in the middle of the crowd.

Closer.

That word stuck in my head all night.

When I called my dad about it, hoping he’d laugh and give me some old forgotten story, he got quiet instead. Then he asked me to stop asking questions. His exact words were:

“Don’t dig into it. Let it go. For your own good.”

That’s when I knew it wasn’t a coincidence.

And that’s when I decided I had to know.

So I scanned the photos. Every single one that had him in it. Then I uploaded them to a facial recognition site, one of those free trial tools. I sat there, chewing my nails, watching the little spinning wheel as the site combed through public databases.

When the results came back, it wasn’t a name.

It wasn’t anything at all.

Just an error message.
FACE NOT RECOGNIZED. NO MATCHES FOUND.

I tried again with another site. Same result.
And another. Same thing.

It was like he didn’t exist.

But he does.

Because when I closed my laptop, my reflection in the dark screen wasn’t alone.

For half a second, just over my shoulder, I swear I saw him standing there.

After that incident, I couldn’t sleep. Every creak of the house felt amplified, every shadow stretched too long. I ended up dragging the photo album upstairs to my old bedroom, setting it on the desk like it was some kind of evidence file.

I told myself I was going to prove he wasn’t what I thought. That there had to be some explanation.

But the photos didn’t stay the same.

The first time I noticed, it was subtle. A snapshot from our trip to Niagara Falls—my dad holding me on his shoulders, water spraying in the background. I remembered that photo clearly because Dad had a goofy plastic poncho on. But now… the man was standing behind us. He wasn’t in the original. I know he wasn’t. He was closer than he’d ever been before, his face angled just enough that both of his eyes were visible.

And this time, he was smiling.

Not a friendly smile. More like someone holding back a secret.

I flipped to another photo. My eighth-grade science fair. The man had been in the back row before, blurry between parents. Now, his head tilted just slightly toward me, his mouth open like he’d just spoken.

I felt sick. My palms started sweating, pages sticking as I turned faster and faster.

Every picture had shifted. Not in obvious ways—nothing dramatic, nothing that would scream altered. Just little things. A glance. A lean. The man’s body turned ever so slightly toward me.

Like he was aware I was looking at him.

I shut the book and shoved it under my bed. But that didn’t help, because the images were burned into my brain. I kept thinking about his eyes—sharp, too sharp, the way they seemed to cut through the blur of cheap cameras.

That night, I dreamed I was flipping through the album again. But instead of birthdays or vacations, every page was a photo of me, right there in my room, taken from just outside the window. In every one, the man was closer, closer, closer, until the last photo was nothing but his face.

I woke up gasping, heart thudding like it wanted out of my chest.

The album was back on my desk.

I know I shoved it under the bed. I remember the scrape of cardboard against carpet. But there it was, sitting upright, open to the graduation photo.

And this time, the man wasn’t in the crowd.

He was standing on stage, next to me.

After that, I stopped pretending this was nostalgia. Something was wrong. Deeply, horribly wrong.

I didn’t tell my mom. I didn’t tell anyone. What could I even say? “Hey, remember that stranger in every childhood memory we have? Well, he’s moving closer now.” Yeah, that’d go over well.

Instead, I tried to ignore it. I shoved the album into the closet and stacked board games on top of it. Out of sight, out of mind.

Except it wasn’t.

The man started showing up outside the photos.

It began with the bathroom mirror. I’d just finished brushing my teeth when I saw him standing at the very edge of the reflection, where the doorway met the hall. I spun around so fast I nearly dropped the toothbrush. Nobody was there. The hallway was empty.

When I looked back, so was the mirror.

The next time, it was worse. I was in the kitchen, late at night, drinking water. The window above the sink looked out into the backyard. Dark, empty, nothing but trees. Except… not empty.

A figure was standing at the tree line. Perfectly still.

I didn’t need the details to know it was him. The posture was the same. Straight-backed. Hands folded. Waiting.

I backed away, heart hammering, telling myself it was just a trick of the dark, some shadow. But when I blinked, his head tilted—slow, deliberate—like he knew I was watching.

I yanked the curtains shut and didn’t open them again.

From then on, reflections betrayed me. Every dark screen, every pane of glass. I’d see him behind me, just far enough that I couldn’t make out all the details. But I felt him. The weight of his gaze pressed down like a hand on my shoulder.

I started covering mirrors. I unplugged the TV. I left the laptop lid closed. Still, I couldn’t escape him.

Because he wasn’t just showing up in the house anymore. He was interacting with the album.

One night, I heard rustling from the closet. Soft, like pages turning. I froze in bed, every muscle locking. The sound went on for a minute, then stopped. When I finally forced myself to look, the closet door was cracked open.

The board games I’d stacked on top of the album were scattered across the floor.

And the album itself was lying open, pages fluttering as if from a breeze.

I crept closer, every instinct screaming to stop, and I saw what page it had landed on.

Not a childhood memory. Not a holiday.

It was a photo I’d never seen before.

Me. Sitting in my bed. Now.

And in the bottom corner of the frame, half in shadow, the man was standing inside my room.

I couldn’t take it anymore. The album, the photos changing, the man pressing into my house—none of it made sense. There had to be an explanation. Some missing piece.

So I confronted my mom.

She was in the living room, folding laundry, when I dropped the album on the coffee table. The thud made her flinch. She looked at it like I’d just set down a dead animal.

“Tell me who he is,” I demanded. My voice shook, but I didn’t care. “The man. He’s in every picture. And don’t tell me it’s coincidence, because he’s in ones that didn’t even exist before.”

Her hands tightened on a towel until her knuckles went white. She didn’t answer.

“Mom,” I pressed. “Please. Just tell me the truth.”

Finally, she set the towel down and sank onto the couch. For the first time in my life, she looked… old. Tired. Like she’d been holding something in for decades and it had finally rotted her from the inside.

“I hoped you wouldn’t notice,” she whispered. “We all hoped.”

My skin went cold. “We?”

She nodded slowly. “Your grandmother, your uncle, your father, and me. We… we never talk about him. That’s the rule. You don’t say his name, you don’t point him out, you don’t acknowledge him. Because if you do, he notices you back.”

Her eyes glistened. She looked at me the way someone looks at a terminal patient—grief already there.

“Why is he in our pictures?” I asked.

Mom shook her head. “He’s always been in our family. Always. As far back as the albums go. Every generation, he’s there. Weddings, funerals, baptisms. Sometimes he’s just a blur. Sometimes he’s… closer.”

She covered her mouth, like she regretted saying that much.

I leaned forward. “What does he want?”

Her hand dropped into her lap. She didn’t answer.

“Mom.” My voice cracked. “What does he want?”

She whispered it so faintly I almost didn’t hear:
“He chooses.”

I felt sick. “Chooses what?”

Her eyes darted to the album. “Who stays. Who doesn’t.”

My stomach turned. Suddenly, pieces clicked together that I’d never questioned before. My cousin Danny, who disappeared when I was ten. The way relatives never talked about him. The empty chair at holidays nobody mentioned.

I remembered once, when I was little, asking about him. My grandma had snapped, “We don’t talk about Danny.” I’d thought it was grief. But now… now I wondered if it was fear.

Because when I flipped to the family reunion photo—the one where we’d all gathered at the park—I noticed something I hadn’t before.

Danny was in that photo. Smiling, holding a frisbee.

But in the copy I held now, he wasn’t.

The man was standing in his place.

I couldn’t breathe.

Danny wasn’t in the photo anymore. Just gone, erased like he’d never existed. And the man—standing where he’d been—looked sharper than ever, clearer than anyone else in the picture.

I slammed the album shut and backed away. “Mom, we can’t just ignore this. He’s here. He’s here.”

She wouldn’t look at me. “The more you fight, the faster it happens. You’ve already seen too much.”

“What happens?”

Her eyes filled with tears. She shook her head. “I’m so sorry, sweetheart.”

That’s when I heard it.

A Click.

The unmistakable sound of a camera shutter, faint, coming from somewhere inside the house.

I froze. “Did you hear that?”

Mom’s face crumpled. “He’s already chosen.”

I spun toward the sound. The hallway was empty, shadows stretching long. My pulse roared in my ears as I crept toward my bedroom.

The album was waiting for me on the desk. Open. Pages fluttering though there was no breeze.

Another click.

I looked down.

There, on the fresh page, was a new Polaroid. Still developing, the chemical haze fading into an image: me. Standing in the hallway. Right now.

Behind me, in the photo, the man was closer than ever. Not blurred, not distant. His hand was outstretched, almost touching my shoulder.

Click.

Another Polaroid slid onto the page by itself. This one showed me staring at the photo I was holding. My own face pale, horrified. And behind me—no longer reaching—he was gripping my shoulder.

I dropped the book and stumbled back, heart slamming against my ribs.

The lights flickered.

And then the mirror across the room began to ripple.

Not like glass breaking—like water. Like something was pressing through.

A hand emerged first. Pale. Thin. Fingers too long. They pressed against the glass, then curled around the frame.

I couldn’t move. My legs locked as his face pushed forward, stretching the surface until it tore open with a sound like wet fabric ripping.

He stepped through.

He was exactly as he appeared in every photo—dark jacket, neat hair, expression calm. Only now he was inches away.

“Why?” I choked out. My voice sounded tiny, useless.

He tilted his head, studying me with those sharp, unblinking eyes. And then—slowly, deliberately—he raised the old camera hanging from his neck.

Click.

The flash blinded me.

For a second, I saw nothing. Just white.

When my vision cleared, I wasn’t in my room anymore.

I was in the photo album.

I could see my mom, standing over the book, crying. I could see my own face, frozen mid-scream, trapped behind the glossy surface.

And behind me, already stepping into the frame, was the man.

Closer.

Always getting closer.

Somewhere on the edge of space. 



Captain Caleb: Houston, the ETA is 6 hours, are you getting our feed?

Houston: Yes and it is incredible. Caleb get ready to activate the thrusters

Captain Caleb: Alright, it is looking good up here

Grace: (inaudible)

Captain Caleb: Yes Grace. Houston 

Houston: Yes?

Captain Caleb: There enough for our return trip?

Houston: We checked it twice.

Captain Caleb: Hello? Houston, do you copy?

Houston: Yes we are here.

Captain Caleb: Houston do you copy?

Houston: Yes 

Captain Caleb: Houston?

Houston: Can you hear us, Caleb?

Captain Caleb: Houston! I think we lost comms… Rodger stop the ship

Houston: Discovery 3 can you hear us.

Captain Caleb: Check comms. Did we lose signal?

Houston: We can still hear, can you hear us?

Rodgers: (yes I believe so)

Captain Caleb: r-



Houston lost all signals from discovery 3 at that moment. That was the last moment we heard from the 6 astronauts. They were alone.

Caleb retried the comms many times yet no success. 

“Do we head back? Continue the mission?” Rodger asked, eyebrows raised. He was a middle aged man, messy brown hair that got messier due to his helmet. He was the ship's co-pilot and a good friend of Calebs. 

“Get the others. We need to solve this” Caleb responded, stroking his chin. Caleb was 33 and had a wife and two kids back on earth, he was a good leader and usually laid back but could be very serious when necessary. Everyone trusted him to get them home. 

“Whats happening?” Grace asked, setting down a coffee cup with her signature worried look. Grace is a young woman about 20, she loves studying new planets and their ecosystems. She was the scientist who had a room full of plant samples and vials of alien blood gathered in her lab in a fashion only she could sort through. She always seemed to be worrying but managed to stay composed during work. Once Rodger gathered everyone they made there way to the center room, with a big circular table in the middle and 4 entryways on each side, one leading to the cockpit. 

“Aren’t we almost there?” Ellerin asked, rolling her eyes as she slumped down into her chair. Ellerin was a lazy mechanic who visually would rather be elsewhere. Sarcastic and always sleeping at the most random times. But she manages to get the job done since the ship is always in working order. 

“We lost contact with Houston,” Caleb said calmly with pursed lips as everyone sat in their respective seats.

 “Why’s that?” Saffron asks in his heavy British accent. Saffron was a very tall 28 year old man who worked as the ship's doctor. Everyone on the ship loved him because he was always the life of the party and his British accent makes him a fun person to be around.

""That's what we will try and figure out,” Caleb responded. 

“Just turn it off and on again” Ellerin said with a yawn before putting her head down to sleep. Caleb just rolled his eyes and flicked her arm

 “go fix it like you’re meant to” Caleb said angrily.

 “Why did you need to bring everyone here for a problem Ellerin is meant to solve?” Grace asked, raising her hand like she was in a classroom. “Well, because l-” *squelch.. Thud……* no one had time to react. No one saw it coming. No one could expect it… Grace ran, Rodger screamed, Caleb sat in stunned silence, Ellerin somehow was still sleeping, and Saffron… didn't even get any last words… through all the chaos Ion sat in the corner. Calculating observing. Ion was a simple man who worked as the weapons operator 19 sleek black hair and eyes that look like they see everything. A stoic expression he always wears other than that, the crew didn't know much about him. He was always in the corner distant but watching. Ellerin felt her spacesuit dampen around her arm and then the screams. She looked up to see Saffron smiling like he always does.. But his body was on the floor. And his head was on the table pouring blood. She screamed then she saw it. A tall translucent bluish creature with a big mouth filled with serrated teeth that looked like a big dopey smile. Two long arms that are sharpened, one still dripping with Saffron's blood. And a creepy eyeless stare. The creature raised its arm and swung a wet snap and the thud of Ellerins head followed. Ion grabbed his pistol and shot the creature multiple times. Blue blood spilt from its chest and coagulated just as fast, covering the wound and not seeming to affect it at all. The creature moved with inhuman speed toward Ion as he continued firing. He felt as the creatures arm sunk into his gut, he fell over coughing up blood. As the creature retracted its arm his guts spilled out and blood poured everywhere. His intestines crawled out like a snake dropping on the floor around his pooling blood, it looked like human spaghetti. Caleb swung at the creature it felt like a rugged and damp wet cloth, it stumbled backward but didnt seem that affected, it didnt even make a noise. The creature looked at Caleb with that same eyeless stare. The creature raised its arm to attack *thud*. Rodger smacked the back of the creature with a wrench and then the two ran to the cockpit. The creature sprinted at them and lunged. Caleb barely managed to dodge as the creature's arm penetrated the control panel. Rodger got tossed on the roof Caleb smacked against a window Grace’s room full of samples smashed everywhere along with her. The ship was heading straight for the planet they were meant to explore. Everyone's memory cut there as a reaction to the trauma. Caleb looked around to see the ship in decimation wires hanging, smashed up panels, loose objects everywhere, blood splattered it was carnage. Caleb was surprisingly uninjured from the crash and he got up and looked around. Through a broken window he saw a blue forest with blue dirt, blue trees and blue leaves. Rodger was unconscious with a bone sticking out of his arm. Ions guts got everywhere, the monster was impaled on a railing, hopeful dead. Caleb went over to Grace’s room on the uneven ground of the crashed ship. Shattered glass and weird liquids on the walls. Plants that were… i dont really know how to explain this… i mean the plants were doing plant stuff idk. And Grace covered in some sort of purple liquid and shards all over her body her face half melted off as some of her flesh still sizzled like bacon. Caleb nearly threw up at the sight stumbling out of the ship throwing up on the blue ground. Then he felt like he stepped in a bear trap as he was dragged on the ground. Catching a glimpse of something, blue hair. He felt claws sink into his back letting out a blood curdling scream as he was dragged further. *ROAR!*... off in the distance a loud roar was heard and the creature that attacked Caleb ran. Caleb laid on the floor being absolutely mauled. His back looked like he had been whipped 1000 times. His leg was so mangled that it could be moved like paper. He lost consciousness maybe because of shock maybe because of blood loss. But one thing was for sure, he was dead. 



*Squelch squelch.* “Wake up. It's not time to die… Ion”



“Listen here. You're about to die so I will heal you. But that means that I won't be able to help you. So just stay alive for 5 seconds on your own.”



Ion woke up to the chaos looking at it all with a defeated expression. He didn't want to be here anymore he just wanted to be dead like the others. But then the voice in his head came. He stood up to see his gut looking just fine. He just sighed and sat back down “what do I gain by surviving here?” *snap*

 “AHHHH” Rodger screamed in pain. Probably snapped his bone back into place, but Ion heard a very very very low growl and looked up. A huge warthog with blue fur. That's what he saw in front of him. The creature charged at Ion but Ion just sidestepped and it slammed against the wall. Ion then beat the creature into a corner letting out all of his rage on it. Blue blood spilled everywhere but it didn't make a sound just like the first alien. But he didn't care. Ion kept pummeling it long past its death he didn't stop until it was just a pile of blue fir and mashed up meat. Rodger walked through the doorway to the center room holding his bleeding arm to see Ion crying softly “is it just us?” Ion stopped crying but he didn’t respond. *ROAR!!!* “The hell's that?” Rodger got off the ship and looked around. It just looked blue everywhere, thick blue, he could barely see anywhere, not even space where they came from. But he could hear something roar again when Ion heard the voice in his head again. “You're alive? Good. Now I'll try and explain fast. I am a parasite and I'm here to help you beat the thing that haunts my planet here. So just do what I say okay?.” Ion sighed and responded “yeah sure.” “ok good so. I gave you some abilities so let's work together to beat it. What you need to know is what this thing is, it is-” the voice was cut off by a snap of a tree and through the trees they could see the creature. A big blue horseshoe crab? And it immediately snapped its tail around cutting though the trees like a razor to hair. Rodger was hit by it flipping him into the air smacking against a tree. “Listen closely that thing hunts based on things that aren't blue and sound so what i want-” The parasite was stopped by Ions body being impaled by the crabs leg splitting him in half. The parasite wiggled out of his body “another fail.” ",1,1758153311.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

10mg was pretty good, but 15mg was like a new lease on life. ADHD symptoms barely noticeable and I didn’t feel like I drank 8 mugs of coffee.

So third week I’ve gone up to 20, and while not as bad as Concerta and Vyvanse, some of the stimulant feelings are back. Doc wants me to increase the dose by 5 or 10mg per week up until our next appointment in 2 weeks.

As I drift through the shifting sands of time (as one does) I discovered that the pawn shop from which I bought these prescription frames (and the lenses, naturally) will be the place to which I travel earlier to sell them: As an old man I shall sell this shop my glasses; later as a young man I shall buy them from that shop; as an old man I shall return to sell them again, for the first time. In the broader web of spacetime, they have no creator nor cause. They merely are: Something to traverse the same loop for eternity, yet existing only once and ever so briefly, too. 

And now that I've sworn off time travel (for both health and moral reasons) the timeline has been desperately nudging me back to close this now broken loop. A paradox cannot be created nor destroyed: Ergo, an existing paradox must be maintained. 

Whenever I begin to drift off to sleep, tendrils emerge from shadow and tug upon my soul, nudging me moments, seconds, minutes into the past, hoping to bring me all the way back to 1986 so I may close the causal loop. But I awaken, startled. Never more than an hour ago.

As soon as I switched to a different batch of beans that that were medium dark from Veracruz, I didn't even have to dial anything to get a perfect pull. The crema was so colorful and vibrant when extracting, these weren't fresh beans by any means, they were around 2-3 weeks from roast date. I've been using these beans for a while I always get great pulls every single time, can't remember a time I had a bad pull. The espresso is much more flavorful and balanced, not too sour or bitter with a syrupy mouth feel. I could actually taste the espresso with milk drinks, it's a night and day difference.

The kind of love where a kiss makes you forget the world exists. Where passion doesn’t just touch your skin, it seeps into your soul, leaving marks you’ll never want to heal.

The kind of intimacy where whispers turn into moans, and moans into promises…
But also the quiet moments:
🌇 watching the sunset together on the balcony, arms wrapped tight.
☕ waking up to a coffee and soft kisses.
💋 being pulled into a hug for no reason, and knowing that reason is love.

I’ve been searching, but it feels rare to find someone who wants both, the hunger and the home. Not just the heat of the moment, but the fire that never burns out.

Maybe it sounds intimidating. Maybe it should. Because real love isn’t casual. Real love leaves marks, on your body, your soul, your mornings, your nights.

And if you’ve read this far and felt even a little tug in your chest… maybe it’s because you’re craving the same.

I felled a 40m tall dead tree on my property in Australia and cut it up into logs of various size. Each are about 50-60cm (20-24in) diameter, and from 0.5m to 1.2m (20-48in) long.

I have not identified the species but based on surrounding trees it is either Spotted Gum or Bloodwood. More likely the former based on the height of the tree. The first two pictures are a log that's been sitting out for a few months, the last picture shows the appearance of the fresh cut wood.

In terms of tools, I only have basic construction tools - circular saws, routers, jigsaw, drills, sawzall, orbital sander. I could possibly get access to a table saw and thicknesser through a friend.

I was thinking of building a router sled to level out the ends of the logs and put a circular piece of glass on the top as a basic coffee table. But I would greatly appreciate all other ideas or advice.

I tried to convince myself that this was just bad luck, that the people I came across were not meant to be my friends. But I went out of school and into university and the exact same thing happens. I try to talk to people, I try to initiate conversations, I try to keep in touch with them, ask them to hangout but everyone seems to be too busy or just not interested. I have never really had anyone try to be my friend, I don't get texts from people asking if I'm okay, what I'm doing on Friday, if I have any free time to grab a coffee. Most of the time I just look dumb , like I'm chasing after people to win their company. I really don't know what I'm doing wrong.

I just launched the alpha version of my first iOS app — it’s called **Bean Stuff** — and I’d love your help testing it. I have 10 spots open.

**What it does:**

Bean Stuff helps you find *real* coffee — not just whatever pops up when you search “coffee near me.” It filters out chains and fast food spots, and surfaces third-wave, specialty-focused coffee shops that actually care about craft:

* Single-origin espresso
* Pour-over setups
* In-house roasters
* Independently owned cafés

Basically, if it’s a place that takes its coffee seriously, it’ll show up. If it sells “unicorn frappes,” it won’t 😄

**Looking for testers who:**

* Care about finding high-quality coffee
* Are open to giving lightweight feedback
* Don’t mind the occasional bug (this is early alpha!)

Would love any feedback — UX, performance, feature ideas, or even just shop suggestions. Thanks!

3. Enjoying coffee, mindfully just really focusing on the experience of drinking coffee as a pleasure (could be anything though, coffe works for me) - we need those little daily pickups! 

4. Keeping active - cardio training, strength, anything that distracts the mind and benefits the body - and besides, I'd feel like cr*p if I had a smoke after a good cardio session

I've been on a journey to find the perfect electric kettle, and I thought I'd share my experience to help others who might be in the same boat. After countless hours of research and dealing with sketchy websites, I finally found a reliable source.

I recently moved into my new apartment, and the first thing I noticed was how much I missed having an electric kettle for my morning tea and coffee. My old one broke down, and I needed a replacement ASAP. But with so many fake products and unreliable sellers online, I was pretty nervous about making a purchase.

Here's the thing - when it comes to electric kettles, you really don't want to mess around with low-quality products. We're talking about an appliance that boils water using electricity, so safety is super important. I've heard horror stories about kettles from questionable sources that ended up being fire hazards or stopped working after a few uses.

After trying a few different websites and returning two suspicious-looking kettles, I finally found a trustworthy source: https://athometouch.com/electric-kettle. They actually redirect you to Amazon's official marketplace, which was a huge relief for me. You get all of Amazon's buyer protection, genuine reviews, and reliable shipping.

What I love about shopping for electric kettles through this route is that you can see detailed product specifications, real customer reviews, and clear photos of what you're getting. Plus, you can compare different models side by side. Some have cool features like temperature control (perfect for different types of tea), auto shut-off, and even keep-warm functions.

If you're still on the fence about where to buy your electric kettle, I seriously recommend checking out https://athometouch.com/electric-kettle. The prices are competitive, and you get the peace of mind that comes with buying from a legitimate marketplace.

Quick tip: Look for kettles with stainless steel interiors rather than plastic, as they tend to last longer and don't affect the taste of your water. Also, pay attention to the warranty terms - a good electric kettle should come with at least a one-year warranty.

I've been using my new kettle for about three months now, and it's been fantastic. No more worrying about whether I got scammed or if the product is safe to use. Just reliable, quick-boiling water whenever I need it.

Remember, when it comes to kitchen appliances, it's better to spend a little more on a quality product from a reliable source than to risk your safety with a sketchy deal. Trust me, I learned this the hard way!",1,1758150457.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

I’m happy to hit some bars that have fun vibes, I’d love to see some live music while I’m there (- is there a lot of that on offer?) or check out some local talent at an open mic night, I’d love recommendations for some nice, friendly coffee shops - I’m hoping to find a comfy spot with a good vibe to hunker down and read some days, I love dancing and wouldn’t mind joining a dance class or even trying out workshops for art/crafts etc. Basically anything that’s would be a fun time! 

I’ll be wandering around during the day, so I’d love to visit any markets or local events as well.

Are there any things that are must-sees?

I’m not really much of a foodie, but I’d be happy to hit up some tasty food joints (I just don’t care about food enough to use my spending money on a fancy meal over using it on other activities/experiences 😂) - so any recommendations on that side of thing a would also be appreciated!

I have always tried to help job seekers so feel free to ask lots of questions and I will do what I can to help.

My background:

PhD in molecular biology, postdoc in cancer research. Since transitioning from academia for the last \~9 years I've been in commercial roles: FAS, product management, marketing/applications, sales/BD and tech support. Last \~4 years I've been in management/Director level roles. I've worked at start-ups, and large companies (Thermo twice, different divisions). I've been on dozens of hiring committees and been the hiring manager for several roles as well as had to decide who to let go during multiple RIFs.

I've been RIF'd twice, first at the end of 2022 - took me \~ a month to land a new role (I had two offers).

Second RIF was at the end of August. I got 6 weeks of severance. It took me 2 months to get an offer. I applied to 4 positions total.

\- A) mid-aged startup: rejection for w/o any follow up. I think it was a timing issue, since I was a great fit and had even worked with the company at a previous role. I didn't reach out to any connections - honestly, I applied on a whim, the technology was interesting but not amazing. I applied directly.

\- B) established company, I got through to the final phase and I believe I would have gotten an offer had they not gone into a hiring freeze. I applied directly and had several connections that I knew well, that I asked to put a good word in for me.

\- C) pre-seed startup. Interesting tech, but straight out of school leadership. I went through all by the final step of the interview process and they decided to hire someone cheaper and more junior. I found out about this position through a former colleague that had just joined and really wanted me to join them.

\- D) pre-seed start up, much more experienced leadership. Recruiter reached out and I applied through them, I had only just connected with this recruiter and had not worked with them prior. Accepted this offer. Compensation was higher than my last role and I did not feel the need to negotiate.

Honestly, I was shocked at how quickly the process moved. I honestly thought it would take me \~6 months to find a new role and was prepared for that.

What I did:

\- Stayed really busy. I did go to one networking event, but ended up running into an old colleague and just chatted with them the entire time.

\- I reached out to my old managers, mentors and colleagues to touch base. I didn't expect them to have jobs for me (although I've previously gotten offers that way), but it was good to get their perspective and advice.

\- I considered going the self-employed consulting route, but 1) everyone is doing it and 2), I much prefer going all in for a company, which I didn't think was the norm for short term consulting. While I love building relationships, I don't have a lot of energy to go out and prospect for new clients all the time.

\- I leaned into my ""fun job"". I was a group fitness instructor on the side, so I picked up more hours there. The pay was near nothing, but it was something. I didn't claim unemployment as the amount I was paid there would mean I would get pretty much $0.

\- Started a coursera course on ML/AI for Product managers as it was genuinely something I've been meaning to learn about. I am almost done with it.

Resume details:

\- I didn't tailor my resume too much to each role. I was very specific on the roles I was applying for. All were around customer-facing, product management/tech support/BD type roles. My resume already encompassed all of that. I would include more details on specific subject areas if the role necessitated it. For example, for company B - they were looking to get into the CDMO space, which is something I had experience in, so I highlighted that more vs. the other applications. It was maybe a one sentence change.

\- My resume is very metric driven. I focus heavily on anything that contributed to revenue changes and sales enablement. Luckily, I have always been very focused on that. I am very aware that I know how to sell myself (it helps that I have learnt from many amazing sales people and commercial leaders). I am also confident in my own abilities, and it shows in how I present myself. I am not wishy washy.

Side note: as a female, this took a while for me to develop, but the straw that broke the camels' back was when I was an old boss talk about their accomplishments in an interview, and I realized that some of them were stuff that *I accomplished*, that they ""supervised"", and by that, I mean, was in the room when I presented the deck, executed the plan etc, but didn't actually do any work or give any advice. That gave me the permission I needed to take ownership of my work. I've also been luckily to have several bosses who knew the value and benefit of telling people their value and how good their performance was, and this helped me immensely (and was one of the reasons I was able to advocate for myself to be promoted to a director position so early in my career).

Interviewing:

\- I have honed my communication skills over the last decade. I used to be terrified of public speaking, but now it comes easily to me. I've probably given over 100+ talks to thousands of people. I always focus on *what do I want the audience to know,* where are they coming from? What are the gaps?

\- I prep a little for interviews, although for the start up companies, there was very little info on them as one was still in stealth mode. I took my friend who worked there out for coffee and got info from them during that time. I was looking for things like: product-market fit, what kind of customers they are going after, their commercial plan and goals, funding challenges (or degree of!). For company B, it was public, so I used chatgpt to pull information and it was surprisingly thorough. Although most of it wasn't very useful for the interviews itself, it did give me an idea of the financial landscape of the company.

\- I am **energetic**. I've had multiple reviews and recommendations point this out (not just during interviews, but in the role itself). I BRING THE ENERGY. I am excited to work for the company and I show passion in what I talk about. I cannot stress how important this is. As I mentioned, I have interviewed maybe close to 100 people in my life, and much fewer than half of them made me feel they actually wanted the job.

\- I gave one presentation (for the company I accepted the offer with), and used gamma AI to clean it up and then edited it in google slides. They gave me 3 days to prep for this and I asked my friend, who I admire for his strategic thinking, to review it for me. He gave me some great advice and I tweaked the presentation accordingly. His biggest advice was to make my value very explicit. They requested a GTM strategy from me, and I made the mistake of diving into it. I changed the presentation to be based around *the experience* I had with GTM and commercialization and *how* I could build it there. I gave a few examples of things they could do, but upon my friends advice, made it less concrete, since they likely already had a GTM strategy and you don't want to call their baby ugly, if my thoughts differed. I went through the slides a few times to fix animations etc, but I didn't practise the talk. I don't like sounding robotic.

I know that was lengthy, but I hope it can help some. I know my situation is unique (everyone's is!), but I honestly believe it was quality over quantity.

I would not apply to every role you see. Why? You are just wasting your time and putting your name in their system for roles that you would never be considered for. This was never a huge factor when I was hiring, but it was information I could see as a hiring manager.

tl:dr:

Job searches are all about timing. I got **super** lucky, that all of these roles happened to be looking at the same time as I was applying.

Use your network to let people know you are looking. Post on LI (I invited my network to grab coffee with me, and many people reached out). If you have joint connections, use them to make intros or put in a good word for you.

Happy to help others - it is a tough climate, but there are roles.

September 18, 2025, marks two whole years since I first landed in Canada—fresh off the plane on a Spousal Open Work Permit, clutching dreams (and probably too much luggage).

Year 1:
	•	Survived Amazon shifts like a champ. 💪 (My legs still remember those 10-hour shifts.)
	•	Learned that “Sorry” is Canada’s unofficial national anthem.

Year 2:
	•	Moved to beautiful Nova Scotia in November 2024—traded skyscrapers for ocean views. 🌊
	•	Earned my EIT designation with Engineers Nova Scotia in March 2025.
	•	Jumped into the construction field in January 2025—finally working in my field!
	•	Applied for NSNP in April, got nominated 🎉, and submitted my PR application under Non-EE in June.
	•	Just took the NPPE exam this September on my path to becoming a P.Eng—fingers crossed! 🤞

Through it all, I’ve realized that Canada tests your patience (and your winter wardrobe), but if you set a dream and grind away at it, things start falling into place.

Two years ago, I was nervous and unsure. Today, I’m proud, grateful, and still figuring out which Tim Hortons order makes me truly Canadian. 🍁☕

1njs0he,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1njs0he/i_have_a_crush_a_big_one/,I have a crush. A big one,"Well, so I have this big crush on my colleague. I used to say that I don’t want to sh*t where I eat but here I am [F26] crushing on him [M24].

But I don’t want it to just be a crush. I want to make a move but I don’t want to rush it either and ruin everything. I do like him but I looove my workplace too.

I’ve been working there for a year now. We will call him William. William is kind of shy ? He doesn’t talk a lot. When I started working here, he used to go out to take his food, eat and then enjoy his lunch time more often alone. I did found him a bit nonchalant but I thought he was just like that. A bit cold too and didn’t mingle that much. But, for some months now, things changed. Slowly, but they did.

In an effort to « break » the nonchalant side and involve him with the group I would often say things like « I’m not going if William isn’t » and bring his name out of nowhere. At first it was really just friendly. We are a small group of « young » and we do a lot of things together so I really was just trying to get him to be a part of our lunch breaks and other activities.

But I noticed that when we were deciding where to eat, if everybody else already had their meal, he would suggest we go pick some foods. But when we arrive at the restaurant/fastfood, he would say « let’s eat here » instead of taking it out and eat with everybody else in the office (that’s how we used to do it). At first I was surprised but also very happy because it meant that he liked my presence (lol) and enjoyed spending time with me. The more we ate together, the more he talked about himself (which he never does in the office). I learned that he is very smart, kind, very very funny too. He recently talked about his family, and shared some really sad story. I felt grateful that he was confortable to tell me this.

He also usually leaves earlier than me, since he arrives earlier too, but last week he stayed really late. Like 2h late. There wasn’t anyone left so we talked a lot and at some point I ask if he was staying because of the rain and he answered « I’m staying because I’m talking with you ». 

And now I’m confused. I know that I like him and each time that pass I feel like I crush on him more and more. But I don’t know !!! If he consider me as a friend, then I don’t want to ruin it because of a silly crush. But if he like me a bit more then I know I’ll have to make the first move for sure. I feel like he gave me a lot of clues but at the same time they could also mean nothing.

He recently paid my lunch meal and let me believe it was another friend who paid. But I’m sure it was him. I wanted to maybe try and use that as an excuse to eat « outside » of work hours together. Is it to bold ? Where do I even begin ? « Hey, thank you so much for the meal, I should definitely pay you back. How about some coffee this Sunday ? » Or maybe beers ? Or just a full meal ? Arrg. I’m SCARED. If I’m wrong and he only see my as a girl friend ?? I’ll be a bit sad

1njry1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/FemFragLab/comments/1njry1y/stone_and_wit_review_from_a_novice_indie_collector/,Stone and Wit review from a novice indie collector,"I've been on the hunt for new scents from different brands and I loved reading other in-depth reddit reviews, so I thought I'd post my own findings! I also bought from Sorce and Fantome, so you can expect those reviews soon - I'll try to link them all when I'm done. Also, feel free to recommend me more houses/scents!  
&nbsp;  

**My background**  
I've only ever shopped at Alkemia, and it's been my true comfort house. I love nearly everything I get there, my signatures from them are: Honored Ghosts, Irresistible, Angels Kitchen. Otherwise I'm super new to the perfume world. I looovve sampling... but I'm very picky, if I'm not absolutely obsessed with a perfume I won't buy a full bottle.  
&nbsp;  

**My preferences:**   
_Love_ - pumpkin, vanilla, caramel, honey, spices, coffee and teas, amber, tonka, almond, baked goods      
_Neutral_ - maple, smoke/insence, woods, most florals and fruits     
_Hate_ - chocolate, syrupy strawberry & cherry, photorealistic earth, powder      
&nbsp;  

Let's begin!! 
&nbsp;  

**My review for [Stone and Wit](https://www.stoneandwit.com/)**.  
&nbsp;  

**small comforts - edp spray**  
I let rest 24 hours. Out of the bottle smells very insence-y, first spray was a little overwhelming but dried down fairly quickly to tamarind and orange. Not getting a lot of tea. One hour later I don't smell it very much, but every so often I get a whiff that transports me to my best friends mothers house when I was 8, I can't describe, a little dusty but in a good way? 5 hours died down and it's sweeter, I finally smell more of the tea. Not a fan of the tamarind, but I give **3.5/5**   
&nbsp;  

**red hare - oil**   
Rested 48 hrs. Out of the bottle smells a little gingery but it's not sharp at all. Scent is a subtle gourmand which is perfect for my tastes - but more unisex than I expected! One minute on my skin and it's reminding me of citronella for some reason. I've never had a fig note in perfume so I'm not sure if that's what I'm smelling. 10 minutes later I get more of the cherry/almond combo but it's become a little too subtle for my taste. 2 hours later can't smell it anymore, unfortunately was not good on my skin chemistry. **2/5**  
&nbsp;  

**blame etc - oil**  
Rested 56ish hrs. Smells the same in bottle as it does on my skin... It's gentle but old and deep, smells like the quilts inside a cedar chest. I was nervous about the leather but I don't detect it. It's floral but in a more masculine way? I like this smell the most so far, hope it lasts. 3 hrs later and its projecting too far, I get occasional whiffs but I would've loved it sitting closer to me. Fell asleep so don't know how long it lasted after applying. No scent upon waking up... **4/5** great scent but like I said I'm too picky to FS.  
&nbsp;  

**ordination - oil**  
Rested 3 days. Out of the bottle smells tart/citrusy in a soft way. I notice all these perfumes are very soft smelling. On my skin has a clean smell, ""my skin but fresher"" vibe. Dry down a few minutes later smells like dried citrus peel, it's like the most ""green"" orange smell if that makes sense. Husband says it's powdery, but I am powder averse and don't detect it. Its more like the oils from an all natural cleaning solution. **3/5**  
&nbsp;  

**Final thoughts**  
Overall great experience...shipping was fast and packaging was nice and carefully done. I was preconditioned by Alkemia to hope for a free sample, unfortunately that was not the case here, but by no means that's not a point against the house at all. I ADORED that the website included the stories behind all the scents, it really clicked with me, like the perfumer was a friend. It felt so personal. The types of scents I tested were definitely new to me, but I could feel a connection, like I could sense their creator underneath them all, in the same way an artist has a signature visual style through different paintings (which was a fun thing to experience through smell!). Unfortunately I didn't love anything _enough_ to commit, but I think that's my own personal flaw rather than the perfumes. I would recommend everyone sample this house!!",2,1758149705.0,FemFragLab,0,1.0,False
1njrxzh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Thirdwavecoffee/comments/1njrxzh/built_an_app_to_help_find_real_thirdwave_coffee/,Built an app to help find real third-wave coffee — looking for early testers ☕️,"I built an iOS app called **Bean Stuff** to solve a problem I think a lot of us face:

>It’s way too hard to find *good* coffee, especially when traveling.

Map apps don’t distinguish between a gas station with a cappuccino machine and a café that just dialed in a new single-origin espresso. Yelp and Google reviews often reward popularity, not quality.

So I built **Bean Stuff** — a simple app that helps you find **third-wave, specialty coffee shops** near you. It filters out chains and drive-thrus and surfaces cafés focused on things like:

* Rotating single-origin espresso or pour-over
* In-house roasting
* Trained baristas and thoughtful brewing
* Independent ownership & focus on coffee culture

It’s not perfect yet (still in early alpha), but I’m looking for people who care about third-wave coffee to help test and give feedback.

If that’s you, you can sign up here to try the iOS version via TestFlight:

Thanks for reading — and if you’ve got a shop in your city that absolutely deserves to be in the app, let me know. Would love to get the community’s input on where the best coffee *really* is.
