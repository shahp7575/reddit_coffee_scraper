So I (24F) am in a relatively new talking stage with someone (24M) who I met on a dating app. I’m a little rusty, since this is the first guy I’m seeing after being in a long term relationship. Things started off strong, and we had an amazing first date at an arcade. Almost every day after that, we texted and he would call me just to chat, and it was euphoric honeymoon stuff for sure. We had our next date planned to be a movie night a week from our first date, but the day before that we were FaceTiming and I ended up over at his place and then were intimate together. It was early, but it was mutual and exciting. We went our separate ways for work in the morning, then reconnected later that night for the movie night but he was super tired and said he didn’t have the energy to have sex that night. We did in the morning, though it was a bit more awkward than the first time, but I felt like that date recovered since we showered together after, then chatted over coffee and went to a pet store to look at all the animals. 

Anyways, after that, we had to pause dates due to the Thanksgiving holiday week, and he started an extremely intense work competition that will be lasting until the end of the year. He told me this, and it seemed that his communication and initiation was slowing down, but it all seemed pretty connected to pure exhaustion from work, and he was still warm when we did talk. Unfortunately, I did not get to see him before the December holiday season hit—I did mention last minute the night before I left if he wanted me to come over, and he originally said yes, but changed his mind when he realized the time and knew he had to work the next morning. He is still working through most days, and I am the one who is out of town now. Since leaving, his initiation has dwindled to none, and when I initiate a text, he will reply warmly, but delayed. 

The last conversation over text we had started off warm and well, and he mentioned he was overworking himself so much he actually got sick, and that he needed to take a couple of days off work and take a break. I responded what I thought was controlled/warm with a “hope you feel better soon” and “I don’t blame you for needing a break though, I’m glad you’re listening to your body. When you do get a solid break, what do you usually like to do to reset?”. And for the first time, it’s been radio silence. It’s been a few days/longest that he’s left a text, and I don’t know if he will end up responding or something another day. 

Now I’m a very trusting person and I’m taking him at his word that he’s just busy, sick, and swamped with holiday season stuff, but I’m not sure at what point to start wondering if this is more of a lack of interest issue. I’m not exactly sure what would look different if he is interested and genuinely just overwhelmed at the moment vs if he is losing/lost interest as well as overwhelmed. He did say in the beginning he calls only when he is not busy, but things like he called me on his drive home to keep him awake after Thanksgiving weekend but has not called me on his drives after visiting family lately...idk. I know I shouldn’t double text and whatnot, but I’m debating what I should do once I’m back in town in 2ish weeks if nothing changes (as he should be slowing down with work by then too). I’m not trying to push him away further, but for my female brain it is confusing that not texting until he initiates again even if it’s weeks from now may be the right move??

Sooo, help! What does this look like and what is my next move? I figured a Happy New Years text would be fine, but I also would really like to see him again when he has the capacity to, I’ve really been enjoying getting to know him and honestly I’m a bit better conversationalist either over the phone or in person. I’m also a go-getter, and I personally don’t have any problems with initiating and putting myself out there, but I’m wondering if that’s honestly hurting me more than helping me right now. It could also be worth noting that he knows I value communication and I make it pretty damn obvious I’m interested lol. Any advice appreciated, just trying to keep the spark alive with someone I think could be worth it if possible :)",1,1766564048.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False
1pui9ol,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1pui9ol/my_best_friend_is_difficult_to_be_around_and_im/,"My best friend is difficult to be around, and I'm starting to get why she's so alone","These are things about her that were always there, but pretty under control until both her parents died in 2020. We've had more conflict than ever before these last few months, and it's made me think about what may be going on. I love her and I think she has a lot of virtues. She's generous, charismatic, fun, sweet and caring. But everyday I start to understand why she has so few close friendships or relationships of any kind.

1. She seems to flip a switch easily with people (except me and my mom, who she's more or less adopoted as a second mother). She can be close friends with a coworker and go from that to hating her in a month, and then switch back to liking her, then back again to hating her. This is currently happening and this dynamic is the norm. She can't 'stick' to anything.
2. Basically her romantic relationships as a whole are intense and unstable. She has short and conflictive relationships with men, starts trusting them too quickly and of course shortly regretting it. In my opinion, she never learns from these experiences and just repeats the same mistake over and over. She tells me all about these things, but any of the softest criticism is met with 'you're berating/judging me'.
3. She did this stupid thing that she still refuses to explain to me clearly. Basically, someone mysterious sends me like $5 randomly. She asks me if I received $10, but again, it was someone random, it wasn't from her (also if she'd send it, she'd know the amount). And the transaction had this weird cryptic title like 'coffee no more harassment'. **I was thrown the fuck off.** I asked her what it was all about and she kept sending laughing emojis. I was only getting more pissed and wanted an explanation. She kept acting like it was funny and I was blowing it out of proportion. I send her a long text telling her that it's obviously a weird situation and I needed to know why she gave my card info to someone and who it was. Some later day this came up again and she ended up crying, still refusing to tell me wtf happened, just saying it was too embarrassing to explain. This topic is very sensitive to this day, and she still refuses to explain any of it. I suspect she gave my card info to some guy she met with for whatever reason, I still don't understand what is so unspeakable, and yes, I did give her the $5 as she wanted me to.
4. She is impulsive. Mostly in making decisions in the moment. She's EXTREMELY flakey and bad at following up with plans, if it's a little too cold or she's more tired than expected or whatever, plans are off. She may cancel plans a week before they happen because somehow she knows she'll be tired next week. Of course, she changes her mind last minute anyway. She's stood me up three times since we've known each other. One time we had an 'issue' because she canceled last minute on going out and then decided to go out after all (common thing with her) but said let's just go get coffee. She decides she wants to go eat at this sushi restaurant instead. Ngl, i was peeved at this point and told her she said coffee. I just felt like she needed to be held to her own word, plus I didn't want to have coffee after 6pm and it was around 5:30ish. She told me I was making a tantrum. I told her 'well, let's go eat then'. She goes 'no, I don't want to'. **Fuck**, yes I was mad. We ended up going to a coffee shop where she got a bagel. I stayed mad and she stayed mad.
5. Particularly impulsive when interacting with people, can't bite her tongue. She's had conflicts for this reason in basically every job and eventually has to leave as a result of the environment she ends up in. Not gonna say the environment 'she's created', I do believe that her coworkers were probably shitty or at least making constant passive aggressive comments. But I also think she could have done things to avoid the point of having to leave.
6. She's pretty spendy. Me too tbh, but she earns a lot of money at her job and still asks me for money to pay bills once in a while (I make much less), which makes me suspect she's secretly spending it in something she shouldn't. Don't want to pry on this for the same reason of sensitive topics becoming
7. I feel like she sometimes just wants to fight for no reason. There's been a few times where she just starts texting me and tries to pick apart everything I say. She's insulted me before (for example, called me a cheapskate when I told her I didn't have money to go out) and after leaving her on read for some 20 minutes (which I think is probably the best way to de-escalate) she texts half-hearted apologies, etc.
8. BUT ALSO, she's very sensitive. The first fight we had was was when we were in Uni, because I told her to have some balls. I wanted her to stand up to this teacher who she was doing work for. Not sure what this dynamic in Uni is called in English, but the point is that she was being overworked and doing more than her role called for. After a while of him constantly taking all her time, I told her this (I was speaking normally, I didn't yell). She was giving me the cold shoulder for days until she eventually told me what the issue was, and I immediately swallowed my pride and apologized without making excuses. It still took her a few more days to forgive me fully.
9. More recently, I asked her if she wore eye primer, and I made sure to be very soft about this because I know her and I have no interest in hurting her. She was very thrown off, and asked why. I just said her eyeshadow was creasing a bit. She was very defensive and told me that yes, of course she did. Later she said that she felt hurt by this. I apologized but frankly felt (and still feel) that that's kind of a crazy thing to want an apology for (i didn't say that). The last time she stood me up some weeks ago, I got mad at her, told her to not do it again, etc. It wasn't an ultimatum, I was just asking her to have enough respect for me not to do that. Immediately this incident came back to her mind (plus my 'tantrum') and she told me that I ""constantly make cruel comments"" about how she ""can't do makeup"". Like you tell her one thing and she hears a whole nother thing.
10. Constantly uses the pleading eyes emoji 🥺 when I'm trying to have a difficult or serious conversation. I've grown to hate that emoji, i'm not even joking.

We're currently on good terms, but I can't help but notice these issues on her with everything she does and says now that I've noticed these patterns. I almost wish I could 'un-notice' them. And before you ask, yes, she's been to therapy for a while. On an off, but still. And is on psych medications (as I am).",2,1766564032.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

Feel like your brain has been replaced with mashed potatoes? You're not alone, and there's actually some wild science behind why post-exam week hits different.

# The Cortisol Crash Is Real

Here's what most people don't know: exam week doesn't just stress you out during the exams. Your body floods itself with cortisol (the stress hormone) for days or weeks leading up to finals. This keeps you alert and focused, even when you're running on four hours of sleep and questionable dining hall coffee.

But the moment you walk out of that last exam? Your cortisol levels cliff-dive. This sudden drop is why you feel exhausted, unmotivated, and weirdly emotional after exams end. It's called the ""let-down effect,"" and it's the same reason people often get sick right after stressful periods.

Your immune system was literally suppressed during exam week. Now it's playing catch-up.

# Your Sleep Debt Compounds Like Interest

Think you can catch up on sleep over winter break? Sort of, but it's complicated. Sleep scientists say you can't fully ""repay"" sleep debt the way you'd pay off a credit card. Each hour of lost sleep has diminishing returns when you try to recover it.

One study from Harvard Medical School found that after just one week of sleeping 5-6 hours per night, it took participants almost a week of normal sleep to fully recover their performance levels. And most students pull way more than one week of reduced sleep during exam season.

The fix? Don't try to sleep 14 hours straight. Your body will actually feel worse. Instead, add 1-2 extra hours per night for several days. This gradually resets your circadian rhythm without making you feel groggy.

# Why You Can't Focus on Anything Right Now

Post-exam brain fog is your prefrontal cortex tapping out. This is the part of your brain responsible for executive function, decision-making, and concentration. It's been working overtime for weeks.

Think of it like a muscle. You wouldn't expect to bench press your max every single day for two weeks and then feel strong afterward. Your brain needs recovery time too.

Neuroscientists call this ""ego depletion"" or cognitive fatigue. Every decision you made during exam week, from ""should I study this chapter?"" to ""is this the right answer?"" drained your mental resources.

# The Dopamine Deficit Problem

Studying for exams is basically a dopamine drought. You're doing hard, unrewarding tasks for delayed gratification. Your brain's reward system gets used to low dopamine levels.

Then exams end, and suddenly you have free time. But nothing feels fun or interesting. That's because your baseline dopamine hasn't recovered yet. Video games feel meh. Your favorite show seems boring. Even hanging out with friends doesn't hit the same.

This usually takes 3-5 days to normalize. The solution isn't to doomscroll or binge junk food (that creates other problems). Instead, do moderate-reward activities: short walks, listening to music, cooking something simple, or light exercise.

# What Actually Helps: The Science-Backed Recovery Plan

**Day 1-2:** Sleep as much as your body wants, but try to wake up within 2 hours of your normal time. Eat actual meals with protein. Hydrate aggressively.

**Day 3-4:** Add light physical activity. Even a 15-minute walk triggers neurogenesis (your brain literally starts making new cells). Avoid major decisions or starting new projects.

**Day 5-7:** Your cognitive function should return. Now you can tackle that to-do list or make plans for break.

# The Bottom Line

Your post-exam exhaustion isn't laziness. It's not a character flaw. It's a predictable physiological response to sustained cognitive and emotional stress.

Give yourself permission to recover. Your brain just ran a marathon. You don't owe anyone productivity right now.

And hey, if anyone gives you grief about ""doing nothing"" over break, just send them this post. Science says you've earned it.

**Visual Context:** The camera angle is fixed, high-angle, looking down into a cylindrical medical pod filled with amber suspension fluid. Inside lies the Subject. The biological damage is catastrophic; much of the lower torso and limbs are missing or stripped to the bone. However, the image is not still. A myriad of ""things""—silver, insect-like micro-manipulators—are moving at blinding speed over the remains. They blur into a shimmering haze of activity, weaving synthetic muscle and fusing black carbon-lattice to bone faster than the eye can track.

**Holographic Telemetry:** Floating above the pod is a large, translucent diagnostic screen. It displays a rotating 3D schematic of the reconstruction. In the center of the wireframe chest cavity, pulsing in sync with the machines, is a small, perfectly round sphere of unknown material.

**System Readout (T-plus 17 Days):**

**The internal telemetry of the Autonomous Medical Unit told a story of impossible contradiction. Brain Activity was flatlined at zero**, yet **100%** integrity was preserved with optimal oxygen and nutrient flow. Connectivity to the Neural-Energy-Sphere Interface was at **65%**, while the catastrophic damage was being erased at blinding speed: bone replacement, utilizing Loridium Composite, was already at **85%**. 

The only flickering life was the meager **12%** external bypass circulation. Nano Shield Integration, remained at zero, waiting for the skin to be rebuilt. The system was 97% complete in constructing the **Virtual Resurrection World**

**Coda:** The video speeds up (Time-lapse x1000). The silver blur consumes the body, rebuilding it layer by layer. The sphere glows brighter. The camera zooms in on the probability metric at the bottom of the screen. For hours, it remains stubborn at zero.

**FRAGMENT 02: THE FORGE**

**Source:** Recovered Memory Core / Sector Zero (Undisclosed Location) **Date:** Estimated 3 Years Pre-Event **Subject:** REID, Georges / PROJECT SIBIL

The chamber was a lead-lined womb buried deep beneath the earth, alive with the deep, resonant groan of superconducting coils. The air didn't just shimmer; it distorted, warped by a localized heat of four thousand degrees Kelvin. In the center of this inferno stood Reid. He was stripped to the waist, his skin slick with sweat, his eyes hidden behind goggles that reflected a blinding violet light.

He had abandoned keyboards and code for something more primal. He wore heavy mechanical waldoes—gauntlets of steel and hydraulic prowess connected directly to a magnetic containment field. He looked less like a scientist and more like the mythic smith at his primordial anvil.

He pushed his hands together, and the waldoes screamed, hydraulics whining against the repulsion of fifty Tesla. Inside the field, a singularity of light fought back. He was forcing carbon and silicon atoms to fuse at the quantum level, folding space itself into a lattice structure. It was violent work. Sparks—actual cascading plasma—erupted from the containment ring, scarring the walls. Reid didn't flinch. With a primal grunt of exertion, he slammed the fields shut.

*CRACK.*

The light collapsed. The roar died instantly, replaced by a heavy silence smelling of ozone.

Floating in the center of the dampeners was a cube, small enough to fit in a hand. It was absolute black, drinking the light of the room. Reid collapsed back against the wall, chest heaving, burns red on his arms and torso. He reached out, tapping the air.

The dampening field shifted, guiding the artifact into a magnetic cradle linked to a holographic display. A beam of light erupted from the display. It did not scatter; it formed a perfect, high-fidelity standing wave. A woman appeared. She was made of photons, but her eyes held infinite depth. She looked at her hands, then down at the burned man on the floor.

She smiled. It was terrifyingly human.

**FRAGMENT 04: NEWSWORTHY**

**The GROTON Gazette / Police Blotter**

**Undated Clipping (Recovered from physical archives)** **Headline:** FLYING SUBS, ZOMBIE BILLIONAIRES, AND THE GOOD STUFF: A NORTH STONINGTON TUESDAY **By:** ""Skeptical"" Steve Maloney, Senior Crime Beat

Folks, I’ve seen some excuses in my time. I’ve heard ""the deer ran into my fist,"" and I’ve heard ""the wind blew the cocaine into my pocket officer, swear it."" But last night, local legend and unauthorized pharmaceutical enthusiast Jedediah ""Rusty"" Vance set a new gold standard for moving violations.

State Troopers clocked Vance’s rusted-out ‘22 Ford F-150 doing eighty-five down Route 2—which, for that truck, is basically reentry speed. When they pulled him over near the Casino turnoff, the cabin reportedly smelled like a distillery had exploded inside a hemp factory.

But it wasn't the substance abuse that made the night special. It was the story.

According to Vance, he wasn't fleeing the law. He was fleeing—and I quote—""A big black submarine that fell out of the sky and squashed my hay barn flat. The one we saw on TV in Pearl.""

You heard it here first. Not a UFO. Not a drone. A submarine. In North Stonington. Roughly ten miles from the nearest navigable water.

Vance claimed the vessel, which he described as ""sleek as a seal and quiet as a funeral,"" hovered over his north pasture, extended a landing leg, and ""sat down"" right on top of his winter feed. He then claimed a ""shiny metal man"" got out and asked him for directions to the Interstate.

Naturally, our finest decided to humor the gentleman and drove out to the farm. Did they find a nuclear vessel parked next to the tractor? No. Did they find a ""metal man""? No.

What they *did* find was a haystack that had been... well, ""pulverized"" is the word the Sergeant used. Scattered, like by a small tornado. The Official Police Report lists the cause as a ""Localized Micro-Weather Event"" (which is cop-speak for ""We have no idea, but we aren't writing 'Flying Submarine' on a government form"").

Vance was released this morning with a suspended license and a stern suggestion to switch to light beer.

**IN OTHER NEWS: THE ELVIS SIGHTINGS ARE SO 20th CENTURY**

As if the flying boats weren't enough, we also have our first confirmed sighting of the ""Ghost of the Pacific.""

Bar patrons at *The Broken Keel* in New London reported a visitor around 2:00 AM. Descriptions vary, but three witnesses swore it was none other than Georges Reid, the tech billionaire who tragically (and famously) died saving a sub in the Pacific last month. You know, the one we have no real picture of?

Apparently, the Zombie Billionaire has excellent taste. He ordered a Narragansett, paid with a crisp hundred-dollar bill (which the bartender framed), and was remarkably polite.

""He didn't look like a dead guy,"" said Mary-Jo, a regular. ""He looked... shiny. Like he’d just been waxed.""

The kicker? Witnesses say ""Dead Reid"" didn't leave in a limo or a spaceship. He hopped onto a matte-black motorcycle that ""didn't make a sound"" and sped off toward the Navy base and the General Dynamics Electric Boat’s main shipyard.

So there you have it, Groton. We have flying submarines flattening farms and dead billionaires drinking lagers. I don't know what they're putting in the water supply these days, but if anyone sees Amelia Earhart drag-racing a tank down I-95 tonight, please call the news desk.

*Steve Maloney is the Gazette’s senior columnist. He prefers whiskey to flying submarines.*

***FRAGMENT 05***

**Amina — Khuzdar, Balochistan, Pakistan**



Amina was lying in her charpai, under the cover of her ralli. She put her finger in her ear and started to hum quietly. She did not want to hear her parents on the other side of the single room of the jhugghi.



They were arranging her marriage with the agent of Malik Bashir for what would amount to an incredible amount for the family. She was 10, two weeks blooded, and he was 60.

The sky, finally, broke. Not all at once like a good man’s promise, but slow and deliberate, the way a dying man takes his last breath. For months it’d been nothing but sun and wind, a baking sheet of sky that bleached the bones of the world and made a man’s own thoughts feel brittle and cracked. The dust got in your teeth, in your coffee, in your soul.
   Then the first drop, big as a June bug’s eye, sizzled on the tin roof. Then another, then the whole damn world was weeping, a cold, steady sheet that washed the grit from the air and the meanness from a man’s heart.
    You could smell it then. The greasewood, that sharp, clean scent of petroleum and life, waking up from a long thirst. And the mesquite, sweeter, a dusty perfume rising from the ground. Their leaves, the color of a sick man’s jaundice just an hour before, now drank in the gray light. The mesquites, they held onto that tired, yellow-green, a memory of the long, hot fall that wouldn’t die, even as winter knocked at the door.
     But it was the greasewood that showed you the truth. Under the weight of the water, its leaves turned a color so green it hurt your eyes, a fierce, sudden green that screamed life from a dead land. And you knew, you just knew, that soon enough they’d push out those little yellow flowers, stubborn as a mule, proof that even here, God hadn’t forgotten how to make something pretty.
    The man, he just stands there in it, letting the cold water run down his neck and soak his shirt, watching that color in the sky, inside his chest, where there was nothing but dust and worry, there was a warmth. A quiet, steady warmth. It was the feeling of being forgiven. The feeling that maybe, just maybe, this hard land ain’t done with you yet. And for a little while, that’s enough. It’s damn well enough. 
     Then the rain quit. Just like that. The sun, low and tired, cut through the wash of clouds. Suddenly there it was. Not some flimsy, watered-down thing, but a double rainbow, hard and sharp against the bruised purple sky. A promise written twice, just in case you were too stubborn or too beat down to believe it the first time. A bold, painted promise that told you the world wasn't just dust and endings.

No pictures today -- but here's a recipe template, and an invitation for you to discuss.

* Brown base spirit, 4 parts (6 cl)
* Banana oleo-saccharum, 2 parts (3 cl)
* Coffee liqueur, 1 part (1.5 cl)

Stir with ice, transfer to a rocks glass with a fresh cube.

I've tried this two ways.  The first time, I used the last of my Hennessy VS cognac.  The second time, I tried some Centenario reposado tequila.  Both were not quite what I wanted, but I still think that I'm on to something that I want to explore further.  

I found the cognac version to be a bit too sweet.  And I'm not quite sure that I like the combination of tequila and banana.

What I do like is the combination of oak, banana, and coffee.  I might explore a drier, oakier cognac the next time that I purchase cognac.  I make banana oleo fairly frequently, and I want to find as many ways to use it as I can.  So the banana component will always contribute some sugar.

What is the ""crisis"" that caused me to try this combination?  Well, I got laid off.  I have promised myself that I won't purchase any new bottles until I have another job!  So, I'm using up things that I have.  My base spirits are getting sparse.  I'm exploring some off-beat combinations.  I'm ""scraping the bottom of the barrel,"" so to speak.

And that almost gave me the inspiration for a good name for this cocktail.  I'm scraping the bottom of a barrel -- made of oak, perhaps?  And I have bananas.  I thought to call this drink the Barrel Of Monkeys.

Alas, I found three cocktails online which already use that name -- each with very different specs, although one also calls for a brown base spirit (whiskey) and a banana liqueur.

I went to her parents' house for dinner today, and everything was pretty normal. After dinner, her mother and I helped clean up in the kitchen. Her mother turned out some old photos, which were the group photos of their sisters when they were young. I casually said, 'Your hairstyles back then really had a sense of the times,' and her mother smiled and agreed, 'Yes, they were popular in the 90s.'.

It's just such a simple conversation. I swear there is no malice.

But on the way home, she suddenly became very silent. I asked her what was wrong, and she exploded directly. She said I shouldn't comment on anything about her family, even if it's just a joke. Then the topic suddenly shifted, and she began to say that I was ""too clingy to my family"" and that it was ""abnormal"" for a man in his late thirties to go back to his parents' house for dinner every weekend. She said she was fed up with my ""overly intimate"" relationship with my family, and also said that when my sister messaged me, I replied ""very perverted"" in seconds.

I was completely confused at that time. Is there any problem with my good relationship with my family? And she just came back from her parents' house by herself?

After returning home, I wanted to give her some space to calm down and sit on the sofa in the living room reading my e-book. After about 20 minutes, she came out of the bedroom and started finding fault again, saying that I ""deliberately ignored her"" and ""pretended nothing had happened"". I tried to explain that I just wanted her to calm down first, but she didn't listen at all.

I chose silence and continued to read with my head down, thinking that not responding would not add fuel to the fire. absolutely wrong.

She suddenly grabbed the pillow on the sofa and threw it at me with terrifying force. I reflexively stood up and stepped back, but she rushed over and gave me a push. I rubbed my lips against the edge of the coffee table and immediately felt the smell of blood.

Then something even more outrageous happened as she rushed to the door and blocked it, shouting 'Get out!' while not letting me approach the door. My phone fell to the ground, and I was only wearing a T-shirt and shorts. My jacket and shoes were all in the bedroom.

From college until now that I’m in my late 20s, sila lang talaga ang naging solid kong kaibigan. Hindi ako yung taong maraming circle, sila lang talaga yung constant ko.

Pero nung nagkaanak ako, unti-unting nagbago. Hindi na ako laging sumasama sa mga aya nila, kahit simpleng coffee lang to catch up. Umikot yung mundo ko sa anak ko at sa work. Lagi kong sinasabi, “next time na lang,” kasi sa isip ko, andiyan lang naman sila palagi. Akala ko hindi nagmamadali ang oras.

Last month, bigla na lang sinabi ng isa kong friend na magmi-migrate na sila ng asawa niya sa ibang bansa. Tapos yung isa ko pang friend, may plano na ring magpakasal, at taga-ibang bansa din ang partner niya. Doon ako tinamaan, kasi parang sabay-sabay.

Ngayon, hindi ko maintindihan yung nararamdaman ko, halo-halong regret, lungkot, at genuine happiness para sa kanila. Masaya ako kasi deserve nila yung bagong chapter sa buhay nila, pero masakit pa rin. Doon ko na-realize na tinake for granted ko sila. Inassume ko na palagi lang silang andiyan, na may “next time” pa.

Pakiramdam ko nawalan ako ng kakampi. OA ba? Wala kasi akong kapatid na babae, at hindi rin maayos ang relationship ko sa tatay ng anak ko. Kaya silang dalawa talaga yung naging takbuhan ko, emotionally, mentally, lahat.

Mas masakit yung realization na hindi lang dahil sa life changes kaya kami nagkaganito, kundi dahil unti-unti akong umatras. Narealize ko na masyado na akong maraming rant sa buhay, masyadong mabigat yung dala ko, kaya tuwing nag-aaya sila ng catch up, mas pinipili ko na lang magkulong sa kwarto. Pakiramdam ko kasi ako na lang yung laging may problema, laging may reklamo.

Sila yung kasama ko sa lahat ng core memories ko, breakdowns, milestones, inside jokes, lahat ng versions ko na hindi ko pinapakita sa iba. Ngayon, parang biglang may malaking space na naiwan. Tahimik, mabigat, at hindi ko alam kung paano pupunuin or kung may pupuno pa ba.

I guess this is one of those moments na nare-realize mo na kahit busy ka sa sariling buhay mo, may mga relasyon palang kailangan mo ring alagaan. Na hindi permanent ang “palagi,” at minsan huli mo lang maiintindihan yung halaga ng mga tao kapag paalis na sila.

So guys, how do you sit with the regret of knowing you could’ve shown up more, but didn’t without hating yourself for it? And how do you move forward when the people who felt like home are no longer within reach?",14,1766562246.0,OffMyChestPH,2,1.0,False

We are both long term poly and within our relatinships try to practice RA and non-heirachial poly as much as possible. Overall we were closer than other partners just due to the time in the relationship, that we were aiming to nest and so many shared interest and hobbies. We spent most weekends hiking, camping, traveling, geocaching, bike riding, exploring, climbing, kayaking, playing games/puzzles and much more.

The breakup itself wasn't completely unexpected as we had ongoing communication issues. She also started dating one of my partners ex abusers causing others within the polycule to only want to do parallel poly with her rather than KTP, and she has been struggling through a laundry list of trauma and issues (Disorganized attached, in survival mode, self diagnosed about 20+ things and refusing help/therapy). The breakup hasn't been unexpected, but her approach to the breakup has left me absolutely heartbroken and confused.

She broke things off via message, and said she wanted a 90 day no-contact period, after which we could reconnect to see if we could retain a friendship but she also offered to talk about timelines. So we met up and I explained that I didn't know if I could come out the other end of 90 days no-contact and retain a friendship given I saw her as my best friend, we have always been in daily comms and we did SO many things together (plus knowing the new guy she was seeing is abusive, I wanted to be able to check in, but didnt say this part to her).

While she initially agreed that check-ins during a 90 day period of reduced contact was a good idea (checking in every couple of weeks) and she even asked me to email her things she struggled with to talk with her therapist about (as she FINALLY started going just as the breakup happened). We had a few emails back and forth over 5 weeks or so, but suddenly she recanted the check-ins claiming I had ""Steamrolled"" her boundry of wanting 90 days no contact!? More confusion for me as it was a mutual agreement (She often claimed mutal agreements were later not things she wanted). I said I would respect her wishes and sit with the confusion and hurt, and I've been left in the dark for 2+ months now.

Being RA I could at least see that the breakup might be a good thing and could picture us having a really close friendship and still doing the things we love, without the romantic involvement. I assumed we could retain the parts that work and de-escalate a romantic relationship as I've done in other RA relationships. We exchanged an email before the no contact period where I asked what a friendship with her looks like, asking a lot of questions. I was shocked her response was that we could catch up for a coffee occasionally after we reconnect and have limited interaction outside of that, and that's about all she would offer... essentially offering breadcrumbs.

I guess I'm just extremely confused, and feel like maybe she's been lying about being RA this whole time. she lied to me about wanting to nest together for several years and a few other things which added confusion to our relationship. While her close friends are as important to her as romantic relationships and that aligns with RA, she did always shame me for having more fluids dynamics with partners and friends and doesn't seem to be something she aligns with, and now the no contact and breadcrumb offerings have me wondering if that was all a lie too?

anyone else here required no contact during a breakup and only able to offer crumbs of a friendship afterwards? I'm really confused by it all.",1,1766561336.0,relationshipanarchy,0,0.67,False

Something is there with the classic K-Dramas from the golden generation (I'm considering those released between 2000-2010 to be precise) that pulls you closer on every watch. That era is so famous for producing great classics like 'Coffee Prince' and 'Boys Over Flowers' and some high-profile emotional classics like 'What happened in Bali' and 'Stairway to Heaven', which created an international wave of K-Drama fans.

So, which classic K-drama's remake would you like to see in today's time?

My take: I would like to see the remake of 'Winter Sonata' (2002) because there are many new-gen emotional and heartbreaking romantic dramas, but these dramas exist because of the success of 'Winter Sonata', which created a perfect blueprint. Remaking it in today's time would not only give a sense of nostalgia for the fans but also would give today's generation a change in taste in terms of unfulfilled love.

The other contenders are 'Coffee Prince' (2007) and 'Save the last dance for me' (2004).

1puhdmt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Manifestationmoney/comments/1puhdmt/it_is_working_read_this_if_you_feel_nothing_is/,"It is WORKING! (read this if you feel nothing is ""working"")","When you visualize, affirm, script, induce SATS, whatever you do, the practice is working.

Let me dissect this:

**You create a cause in your mind. According to the degree and quality of that cause, you produce an effect in 3D reality.** 

So, for example let's say you're manifesting $100k in your bank account. If can be challenging to picture yourself in such a situation if you've never experienced it compared to someone who already had rich parents and have witnessed abundance of money since they were born. 

So the ""quality"" of the cause (imagination) is not great. But you're still moving the needle, you're reality is still changing and is still producing effects in the 3D according to the quality of the cause (your imagination).

***Cause -> Effects to the degree and quality of the cause -> the potential for the cause increases -> the potential of the effect also increases -> the potential/quality of your cause greatly increases -> potential of effect increases tenfold -> -> -> -> $100k in your bank account.***

How does this apply in the real world?

Let's assume you've never experienced financial freedom and you want to manifest $100k:

You imagine having $100k in your bank account (cause)  
Nothing happens (effect)  
You imagine having $100k in your bank account (cause)  
You found a penny while you were walking down the road (effect)  
You feel grateful for it and thank the universe for giving you a sign for the abundance to come (cause)  
Your friend paid for your coffee (effect)  
You thank the universe, you imagine your wife reacting to you having $100k in your account (cause)  
You get discounts, offers that you wouldn't usually get (effect)  
You imagine a scene of you having $100k & carry that state throughout (cause)  
You got a job promotion increasing your income 10x (effect)  
You imagine a scene of you having $100k & carry that state throughout (cause)  
You automatically develop spending habits of someone who has $100k (effect)  
You imagine having $100k in your bank account (cause)  
You get an idea of starting a business, you start it (effect)  
....  
......  
.........  
.............  
................  
You have $100k in your bank account (EFFECT)

Notice how the bridge of events unfolds. You'll never know how your manifestation will occur so there's no point in trying to figure out the ""how"". You'll receive the answer to your ""how"" from the universe. 

And notice this: you'll get ideas, mental nudges, compulsion to take certain actions. **YOU MUST TAKE THEM.** They are from your intuition which is your inner tuition / inner guidance. These actions will lead you to your bridge of events, and those events will take you to your desire. All you need to do is flow with your intuition.

And notice one more thing: in the above example, you keep using your imagination/any practice you do. **CONSISTENCY IS IMPORTANT AT ALL COSTS** (especially in the state you carry throughout the day), **IT IS NON-NEGOTIABLE.** 

And notice one last thing (i know i'll stop): in the above example, for all small manifesations you get, **you THANK the universe, you feel GRATEFUL for it**, you NOTICE these small manifestations, the small abundance that is coming your way. The universe doesn't know the concepts of ""small"" or ""big"" from it's infinite perspective. SO be sure to be AWARE of all the good that is coming your way and be thankful instead of whining and complaining like a spoiled pretentious entitled little brat because daddy didn't get you what you wanted.

And the bridge of events I've described in the above example, it is an EXAMPLE and there's no time period that what will manifest when. I intentionally didn't include the time period on when the person will get the $100k because no one but god knows it and it's futile trying to manifest something with a strict timeframe (unless you can go into ABSOLUTE KNOWING that you already have your desire)

Hope this helps.

Matched on Hinge and talked for 2.5 weeks. Got to know each other well and made travel plans to meet. I bought my ticket and everything - it was in addition to me already being in his city.



He would text me good morning, and keep the conversations going, sending me pictures.


We video chatted once and had planned to do it again, but then that night he stopped responding.


I already had a grad gift for him so I had my friend drop it off at his job for me. (We had gotten to know each other pretty well and it was in a central shopping area where I was staying. It was a book, an IPA and a handwritten note)


We never deleted each other from social media but 3 months later I reach out and wish a happy birthday because our bdays were close to each other and I was out celebrating mine.


He responds a few hours later saying thank you and sorry for ghosting and not thanking for the gift.


We keep our messages light and short.


Then in October we start chatting again but verrry lightly and careful it seemed - into November.


It’s December and I haven’t really reached out much, but I want to. We never really talked about what happened. Or why. I mean sometimes I send messages that are somewhat emotional.. he reads them and doesn’t respond but seems like he acknowledges things by his increase of interaction but ..


Was any of it real? I really liked him and I don’t date often. 


Does he care? He said he felt guilty for a long time but I never brought it up again because I just felt like even myself, I was a diff person at the time and so I’m kind of letting that go in order to just breathe but it does bother me and I’d love to grab a coffee and hang one day - as friends.


I may move cross country and he lives 5 hours away. 


I also feel like I know the answer already but worth a shot to hear another perspective. 


I could still see a connection forming but he seems pretty dense to communicate. I also feel that I understand him very deeply so when I bring up certain things I can tell that maybe it could be uncomfortable because I’m reading him too well..


Or are we just stuck as social media friends until one of us deletes the other? I offered to just be friends but sometimes I feel like he avoids me or interacting with some of my stuff to not send a signal and for me I just feel like, if you truly felt nothing.. why is it so difficult for you to interact like “normal”? Like what is the hesitation if it’s established that we’re not in a relationship?


Is it because I can still see a future? I didn’t disclose that, I’m kinda trying to let things happen or dissipate organically but yknow… end of the year calls for reflection.

This all happened end of May into mid June.

I try not to be chronically online anymore but yeah.. just stuck in this weird virtual push pull with someone I feel like I got a soul tie with or something..


I’m still somewhat open to dating, just kind of embarrassed if this is truly normal and I just was oblivious and maybe attached too quickly. I was just matching their energy and fell for it.


But also, are there any success or recovery stories out there.

I’d hate for the connection to be all for nothing. It’s also bothering me because in the show Heated Rivalry there is a new couple with both our names… and so the familiar tension and push pull there is kinda .. interesting .",0,1766560575.0,AskGaybrosOver30,5,0.5,False

1puh9x7,https://www.reddit.com/r/NevilleGoddard/comments/1puh9x7/if_you_feel_like_nothing_is_working_read_this/,"If you feel like nothing is ""working"" READ THIS! (spoiler: it IS working)","When you visualize, affirm, script, induce SATS, whatever you do, the practice is working.

Let me dissect this:

**You create a cause in your mind. According to the degree and quality of that cause, you produce an effect in 3D reality.** 

So, for example let's say you're manifesting $100k in your bank account. If can be challenging to picture yourself in such a situation if you've never experienced it compared to someone who already had rich parents and have witnessed abundance of money since they were born. 

So the ""quality"" of the cause (imagination) is not great. But you're still moving the needle, you're reality is still changing and is still producing effects in the 3D according to the quality of the cause (your imagination).

***Cause -> Effects to the degree and quality of the cause -> the potential for the cause increases -> the potential of the effect also increases -> the potential/quality of your cause greatly increases -> potential of effect increases tenfold -> -> -> -> $100k in your bank account.***

How does this apply in the real world?

Let's assume you've never experienced financial freedom and you want to manifest $100k:

You imagine having $100k in your bank account (cause)  
Nothing happens (effect)  
You imagine having $100k in your bank account (cause)  
You found a penny while you were walking down the road (effect)  
You feel grateful for it and thank the universe for giving you a sign for the abundance to come (cause)  
Your friend paid for your coffee (effect)  
You thank the universe, you imagine your wife reacting to you having $100k in your account (cause)  
You get discounts, offers that you wouldn't usually get (effect)  
You imagine a scene of you having $100k & carry that state throughout (cause)  
You got a job promotion increasing your income 10x (effect)  
You imagine a scene of you having $100k & carry that state throughout (cause)  
You automatically develop spending habits of someone who has $100k (effect)  
You imagine having $100k in your bank account (cause)  
You get an idea of starting a business, you start it (effect)  
....  
......  
.........  
.............  
................  
You have $100k in your bank account (EFFECT)  


Notice how the bridge of events unfolds. You'll never know how your manifestation will occur so there's no point in trying to figure out the ""how"". You'll receive the answer to your ""how"" from the universe.   


And notice this: you'll get ideas, mental nudges, compulsion to take certain actions. **YOU MUST TAKE THEM.** They are from your intuition which is your inner tuition / inner guidance. These actions will lead you to your bridge of events, and those events will take you to your desire. All you need to do is flow with your intuition.  


And notice one more thing: in the above example, you keep using your imagination/any practice you do. **CONSISTENCY IS IMPORTANT AT ALL COSTS** (especially in the state you carry throughout the day), **IT IS NON-NEGOTIABLE.** 

And notice one last thing (i know i'll stop): in the above example, for all small manifesations you get, **you THANK the universe, you feel GRATEFUL for it**, you NOTICE these small manifestations, the small abundance that is coming your way. The universe doesn't know the concepts of ""small"" or ""big"" from it's infinite perspective. SO be sure to be AWARE of all the good that is coming your way and be thankful instead of whining and complaining like a spoiled pretentious entitled little brat because daddy didn't get you what you wanted.

And the bridge of events I've described in the above example, it is an EXAMPLE and there's no time period that what will manifest when. I intentionally didn't include the time period on when the person will get the $100k because no one but god knows it and it's futile trying to manifest something with a strict timeframe (unless you can go into ABSOLUTE KNOWING that you already have your desire)

Hope this helps.

Questions are welcomed.

I (22F) met B (20M) in school as we took the same summer class. 

The day he first approached me, I was chatting with the teacher after submitting an essay and noticed he was politely standing behind me waiting for me to finish up. As I walked out the class he rushed behind and sparked up a conversation. He ended up asking for my number and that was that.

For about a week we texted pretty much non stop. We had a bunch in common and liked teasing each other. He eventually asked if I'd like to join him at the library to study together. DUH i said yes and went.. There was honestly a lot more yapping than studying that day, he walked me around our school to show me his usual spots and where his classes are, even walked me out to my destination before parting ways. 

The next day he spotted me walking around at school and chased me down a hallway just to say hi.

Then came the driest texts i've ever seen in my life.. And then full silence. 

For about a month our chat didn't budge until I decided to initiate something after we finished the semester.

He seemed pretty happy I reached out! Again we texted non stop.. For a few days.

As I mentioned I was heading out for a full day, he invited me to go visit him at his work place in case I happen to pass near the area. 

B works in this cute little coffee shop, and being head over heels for this guy, I decided to drop by. His face lit up when he saw me in line and I had the hardest time keeping a subtle expression with him. 

I couldn't stay long so I ordered a little coffee to go and left. Shortly after, I received a message from him saying he was happy I dropped by.

However just a day after his answers became dry again, and now silence..

I don't know how to read this guy and I've been crazy about him for ages now.

Even though I'm painfully shy, I don't give off mixed signals and try not to make matters difficult. 

(For context, we met in a literature class.. Our teacher had us pick a book of our choosing, present it and basically roast the crap out of everyone else's choice to make your own stand out. Call me a hopeless romantic, but this guy was so attached to his book that I decided to buy it for myself as a christmas gift.

1pugwum,https://i.redd.it/9o94g9qsm39g1.jpeg,10 unique aspects of daily life in Korea,"Here is a summary of the 10 unique aspects of daily life in Korea.


 1. High Levels of Safety and Social Trust


• Leaving Valuables Unattended in Cafes. Koreans often leave laptops or smartphones on tables while going to the restroom.

The Reason : This stems from a high level of social trust and the fact that CCTV cameras are everywhere. The high likelihood of being caught, combined with a cultural respect for others' property, makes theft extremely rare.


• Children Walking to School Alone : It is common to see elementary students walking to school without parents. Korea has a very low rate of violent crime. Additionally, residential areas are designed with schools nearby, and ""School Zones"" with strict traffic laws ensure a safe environment for kids.


• Strict Adherence to Traffic Lights :  Pedestrians generally wait for the green light even when no cars are coming. This is a mix of high civic awareness and the ""Safety First"" campaigns that have been ingrained since childhood. The presence of traffic enforcement cameras also plays a role.


2. . Exceptional Public Infrastructure


• Top-Tier Public Restrooms : Public toilets are abundant, clean, and free of charge. The government and local municipalities treat public hygiene as a basic welfare right. Major subway stations and buildings are legally required to maintain accessible facilities.


• Punctual Public Transportation : Buses and subways arrive exactly on schedule. Korea operates on a highly advanced IT-based integrated control system. Real-time GPS tracking and the cultural emphasis on efficiency (the ""Pali-pali"" or ""hurry-hurry"" culture) keep everything running like clockwork.


• Lack of Visible Homelessness : It is rare to see large numbers of homeless people on the streets.  This is due to relatively strong social safety nets, local government support centers, and urban management policies that prioritize public order in high-density areas.


 3. Cultural Norms and Social Efficiency


•  Free Water in Restaurants : Water is provided free of charge as soon as you sit down.  In Korean culture, charging for basic hospitality like water is seen as ""stingy."" It is also a part of the fast-paced service culture to ensure diners are served immediately.


• Minimal Small Talk in Shops : Service is polite but quick, without the need for casual conversation. Koreans value efficiency and privacy. People generally believe that completing a transaction quickly is a way of respecting the other person's time.


• Free Wi-Fi Everywhere: You can access free, high-speed Wi-Fi in almost all public spaces, including subways, buses, parks, and even traditional markets. Korea has one of the highest internet penetration rates in the world. The government treats digital connectivity as a public necessity. To bridge the digital divide, the ""Public Wi-Fi Free"" project was implemented nationwide, allowing everyone to stay connected regardless of their data plan.


• Commitment to Taking Photos for Others : If you ask a Korean to take your photo, they will often take it very seriously, finding the best angle. There is a shared social understanding of the importance of ""the perfect shot"" (Insaeng-shot). It’s a display of collective kindness where people want to ensure you have a great memory of your visit.



4. The ""Cafe Republic""


• Saturation of Coffee Shops : You can find a cafe on almost every corner. Cafes in Korea serve as a ""Third Space""—an extension of the home or office. Since many people live in small apartments, cafes provide an affordable place to study, socialize, or conduct business meetings. 

 

☆ If 'Palipali : quickly' in the past was a negative symbol, it has now become a strong competitive competitor of agility by meeting AI and advanced technologies.


Thanks to this, the world's fastest 5G and optical communication networks have been established. This highway has become a key foundation for processing large amounts of AI data today.

The culture of focusing on speed over excessive perfectionism is in line with the IT industry's Agile method. The speed of introducing new technologies immediately and reflecting feedback is among the best in the world.

Dawn delivery, real-time traffic information, and instant payments were among the first to become commonplace in Korea. This accumulation of ""real-time data"" has become the best soil for AI to learn and optimize.
As a result, Korea is called a test-bed, and thanks to the fast response of Korean consumers, global companies have come to rate Korea as the most dynamic test site to predict the success of the new technology. There is a difference in comparing Japan and Korea, where Japan is stingy in public resource services and slow to change. Therefore, it is hard to find a country similar to Korea.

The last three weeks have been interesting, we had our trainees gift each other, get cards, decorate their club room, receive gifts from home, and more.

TODAY HOWEVER! I want you to write about what your team (as lined up in exercise #2, as usual) would do on Christmas day (or the equivalent, it matters not to me as long as the holiday cheer continues)

Are they going somewhere? Maybe they stick to their decorated club room? Perhaps they'll do something fun together. Do you perhaps treat your team to something nice? Bought or homemade? Do explain, if you can.

As per tradition, you will get my own write-up with Team Vela. Please enjoy, and contribute as you see fit.

*It is the day the team has been waiting for, as night falls on the academy campus, our stars make necessary preparations. Fukukitaru and Ayabe are in charge of setting up the observation equipment, telescopes, notebooks of all size, a camper stove to keep tea and coffee alike warm and ready to be poured out. Copano Rickey was to procure late night rations, things that would keep the team wide and awake through the observation period. Strong tea and coffee, of course. Sweet snacks of all kinds. Sugar keeps you going in the cold.*

*Uni was to map out the sightseeing for tonight. Jupiter, Mercury, Saturn - all seen by even the naked eye from the darkest place on campus, far from the lamp light. Blue Sirius was the star that would be caught, the constellation of Monoceros, forming a green cloud reminiscent of a christmas tree, the celestial reindeer of Rangifer - she charted a route, checked it twice, and joined her team outside.*

*The stars twinkle in the sky, and each look through the telescope, occasionally catching flakes of snow in its lens, though it doesn't seem to bother anyone. After a while the cold seems to be the least of everyone's issue.*

And that is it from me. I hope you all have lovely holidays, don't indulge in the goods too much (I know I will, and will regret it but oh well), and don't forget to horse around in the snow. If you have snow. I got mud. Again. Ta-ta.",4,1766558703.0,UmaMusume,0,0.83,False
1pugtov,https://i.redd.it/rwwucyxol39g1.png,The AI Constitution Was Left in the Wrong Room,"By the time I realized the summit was doomed, the UNESCO representative was already crying.

Not sobbing, mind you. That would be uncivilized. These were single, crystalline tears of pure ethical anguish, tracking perfect parallel paths down her cheeks as she stared at the binder in front of her, a document that had just detonated her worldview like a philosophical grenade in a silk purse.

My name is Alistair Finch, and it is my job to prevent global economic instability. Usually, this involves spreadsheets, stern memos, and very strong coffee. Today, it involved herding seven of the world’s most powerful, opinionated, and bureaucratically armed policy titans into a room that cost more per hour than my annual salary, all to agree on “Harmonized Global AI Oversight.” The air smelled of polished mahogany, expensive anxiety, and the faint, ozone-like scent of impending jurisdictional warfare.

The room was a masterpiece of alpine intimidation. A table hewn from a single, ancient tree dominated the space, its grain so deep you could lose a small nation in it. Beyond floor-to-ceiling windows, a pristine lake and jagged mountains posed like a screensaver for billionaires. It was the kind of place where history was supposed to be made, or at least where very expensive truces were signed.

The seven figures around the table were the usual constellation of power:

Eloise Vance (UNESCO), Assistant Director-General for Social and Human Sciences. She radiated a warmth that could thaw permafrost and a belief in humanity’s inherent goodness so potent it probably had its own carbon footprint. Her binder was covered in hand-stitched fabric from a cooperative she’d once visited.

Gunther Schmidt (European Commission), Director-General of DG CONNECT. A man carved from Brussels procedural marble. He believed regulations were not just necessary but beautiful, and that the correct form could, if filled out in triplicate, prevent the apocalypse. His posture was so upright I suspected he had a backbone made of laminated directives.

Dr. Aris Thorne (NIST), Acting Director. A human measurement instrument. If you asked him the time, he’d give it to you with a confidence interval and a traceable calibration certificate. He saw the world as a series of frameworks waiting to be mapped, measured, and managed. His suit was the color of a neutral gray card.

Mr. Haruto Tanaka (ISO/IEC), Chair of the critical standards committee. His life was definitions. He lived for the serene, years-long ballet of achieving consensus on whether a “system” was “autonomous” or “automated,” and could derive profound joy from a perfectly formatted footnote. He wore the serene expression of a man who has just mediated a dispute between two commas.

Isabelle Roche (OECD), Secretary-General. The diplomat’s diplomat. She could frame the collapse of civilization as a “suboptimal coordination scenario” and make you feel optimistic about it. Her smile was a geopolitical asset, and she was already mentally translating everything into bullet points for a policy brief.

Judge Alistair Croft (Council of Europe), Chair of the Committee on AI. He didn’t enter a room; he held court in it. His voice was a gravelly barrel of legal precedent, and he viewed every problem through the lens of fundamental rights, dignity, and the unyielding gravity of the law. The room felt several degrees colder near him.

Director Li Wei (Cyberspace Administration of China). Inscrutable, efficient, and operating on a plane of strategic thought five moves ahead of everyone else. He spoke rarely, but when he did, it was with the finality of a firewall rule being applied. He was here to observe, to assimilate, and to ensure no global standard emerged that his algorithms couldn’t parse, comply with, or ideally, dictate.

The inciting incident was a masterpiece of mundane catastrophe. A panicked junior aide, Felix, whose glasses were perpetually fogged with terror, had mixed up the binders. Instead of our sanitized, anodyne, 300-page “Harmonized Global AI Oversight: Principles, Jurisdiction, and Enforcement” document—a masterpiece of saying everything and nothing—he had delivered seven copies of a single, terrifying tome:

Constitutional AI: The Ternary Moral Logic Governance Standard for Accountable Artificial Agents. Technical Specification, Legal Framework, and Implementation Guide. Author: Lev Goukassian. Status: Final Monograph. Classification: Deep Research / Technical Standard.

I opened mine, hoping to project calm. My eyes skimmed the abstract. “Binary Brittleness… Sacred Zero… Moral Trace Logs… Goukassian Promise…” A cold sweat, entirely unrelated to the perfect room temperature, broke out on my brow. This wasn’t a policy paper. This was a blueprint for a god with a conscience. And it was in the hands of seven people who each thought they should be that god’s architect.

“Well,” I began, my voice cracking slightly. “It seems there’s been a minor—”

“What,” Gunther Schmidt interrupted, his Teutonic accent sharpening to a stiletto point, “is this ‘EU AI Act Article 14 Compliance’ doing in a technical specification? And why is it citing a ‘Sacred Zero’? This is not a recognized compliance mechanism. This is… theological engineering!”

Eloise Vance clutched her fabric-covered binder to her chest, the first tear escaping. “It’s not theological, Gunther. It’s human. Listen: ‘The Sacred Zero operationalizes the right to hesitate.’ A right to hesitate! That’s the most beautiful, profound… it’s an epistemic embrace! A pause for wisdom!”

Dr. Thorne adjusted his glasses, peering at the text. “Fascinating. They’ve quantized morality into a triadic state machine. +1 for Proceed, -1 for Refuse, and 0 for this ‘Sacred Zero.’ It’s a three-valued logic system. Like Kleene, but with… legal liability.” He looked intrigued, then horrified. “The alignment tax on this would be monstrous. The latency!”

“Latency?” Director Li Wei spoke for the first time, his voice quiet and lethal. “Explain this ‘Dual-Lane Architecture.’ A fast lane and a… governance lane?”

This was my chance. Maybe I could steer this. “I believe it’s a performance mitigation,” I offered. “One lane for quick decisions, another for the heavy cryptographic…”

“Cryptographic?” Judge Croft boomed, his finger stabbing a page. “It says here the system cannot act without generating a ‘Moral Trace Log.’ A cryptographically signed, immutable record of its so-called reasoning. ‘No Log, No Action.’ That’s not a feature. That’s a witness. It’s pre-trial discovery baked into the runtime! It turns every AI into a defendant on the stand!”

Haruto Tanaka leaned forward, a flicker of excitement in his eyes. “The schema… they propose a TML Standard Log Format. TSLF. Look at the JSON structure! They’ve defined fields for ‘ethical\_violation’ and ‘uncertainty\_quantification.’ This is… this is a standardization of moral failure modes! We could… we could form a working group. SC 42/WG 7: Ethical State Enumeration.”

“You cannot standardize a conscience!” Eloise wailed.

“You can if you define the units of measurement,” Dr. Thorne countered, already sketching a flowchart on a napkin. “Confidence intervals for harm. Cosine similarity to human rights vectors. It’s auditable! NIST could develop test suites…”

“Vectors?” Gunther pounced. “What vectors?”

Isabelle Roche, ever the synthesizer, read aloud in her smooth, diplomatic tone. “‘The Human Rights Mandate. Vector-based enforcement of the UDHR… The system maintains a semantic vector database of core rights documents. If output similarity to a “violation vector” exceeds a threshold…’ My god. They’ve given the Universal Declaration of Human Rights a vote. In code.”

Judge Croft looked oddly pleased. “So the machine can refuse an unlawful order. Good. That aligns with the rule of law. A ‘Law-Following AI.’”

Director Li’s expression was unreadable, but his pen had stopped moving. “And this ‘Earth Protection Mandate’? Carbon cost accounting integrated into the logic core?”

“Yes!” Eloise cried, finding hope. “It respects planetary boundaries! It’s ecologically aware!”

“It is computationally wasteful,” Li stated flatly. “A system that throttles itself based on grid carbon intensity is an inefficient system. Stability and performance are the primary mandates.”

“But don’t you see?” Eloise implored, turning to the group. “It’s all connected! The pause, the vectors, the logs… it’s the Goukassian Promise!”

A new silence fell, heavier than the last. The phrase hung in the air, smelling of ozone and destiny.

“What,” Gunther asked, with dreading patience, “is the Goukassian Promise?”

Felix the aide, who had been slowly trying to back out of the room, squeaked. “It’s in Section 3.3! It’s a tripartite covenant! The Lantern, The Signature, The License!”

We all frantically flipped pages. The summit had completely derailed. We were no longer discussing oversight; we were conducting a spontaneous, hostile peer-review of a digital constitution.

“The Lantern,” Isabelle read, her diplomatic calm fraying. “A public, cryptographic beacon signaling active compliance. If the system bypasses safety, the Lantern goes out. It’s a… reputation kill switch.”

“A scarlet letter in LED,” I muttered.

“The Signature,” Judge Croft intoned. “The creator’s identity—this Lev Goukassian—cryptographically embedded. A chain of moral provenance. No hiding behind ‘proprietary complexity.’ I approve. Accountability must be personal.”

“And The License?” Director Li’s question was a blade.

Haruto Tanaka found it. “It… prohibits use for surveillance or lethal weaponry. ‘No Spy, No Weapon.’ The clauses are baked into the initialization sequence. Violation triggers a system termination.”

Gunther Schmidt went pale. “You cannot… you cannot license ethics! That is the role of the regulatory framework! Of the Conformity Assessment! This… this is vigilante code!”

“It’s a pre-commitment device!” Eloise shot back, now fully a convert. “It binds the creator to their values! It’s beautiful!”

“It’s a business model nightmare,” I groaned, my economic strategist brain finally kicking in. “The storage costs alone! ‘Always Memory’… they want to keep a cryptographically signed snapshot of every ambiguous state, forever! The petabytes! The energy consumption!”

Dr. Thorne’s eyes were alight with a terrible, beautiful madness. “They’ve thought of that! Merkle-batched anchoring! You don’t store every log on a blockchain; you hash thousands together into a Merkle tree and only put the root hash on-chain! It’s efficient! You can verify any log against the root! It’s… it’s Certificate Transparency for the soul!”

“A tree?” Eloise asked, confused.

“A cryptographic data structure,” Haruto and Aris said in unison, then glared at each other for the lack of definitional precision.

“So,” Judge Croft summarized, his voice like a gavel. “The machine pauses when uncertain. It refuses when it detects harm via… vector math. It only proceeds when it can cryptographically prove it checked. And every step is logged in a tamper-proof ledger, anchored to a public chain, with the keys split among six independent custodians—a ‘Hybrid Shield’ against tampering. And the whole thing is wrapped in a promise that self-destructs if you try to use it to build a bomb or spy on people.”

The summary was so accurate, so horrifyingly complete, that we all just sat there. The majestic view outside seemed trivial, a mere backdrop to the conceptual monster we’d just unleashed in the room.

Then the fights started in earnest.

“The ‘Sacred Pause’ would cripple European innovation!” Gunther thundered. “A robot vacuum encountering a novel mess cannot enter a state of existential doubt! It must clean or not clean!”

“But what if the ‘novel mess’ is a sleeping cat?” Eloise fired back. “Shouldn’t it hesitate?”

“The cat is not in the training distribution!” Dr. Thorne argued. “That’s an out-of-distribution detection event! That’s a perfect Sacred Zero trigger! But the latency budget… you’d need a speculative execution buffer…”

“This is not about vacuum cleaners!” Judge Croft roared. “This is about autonomous sentencing algorithms! A ‘Sacred Zero’ when the recidivism model has low confidence could be the difference between liberty and incarceration! That pause is due process!”

“And who resolves the pause?” Director Li asked, coldly practical. “The ‘human-in-the-loop’? Your own documents show humans are slow, biased, and suffer vigilance decrement. This creates a bottleneck an adversary could exploit—a ‘Moral Denial of Service’ attack.”

My head was swimming. They were arguing using the document’s own terminology. They had internalized the TML universe in under an hour.

“The GDPR!” Gunther suddenly cried, a triumphant gleam in his eye. “Article 17, the Right to Erasure! Your ‘Always Memory’ is illegal! You cannot keep immutable logs if a citizen demands their data be deleted!”

Isabelle jumped in. “Ah, but the monograph addresses that! Cryptographic shredding. You destroy the decryption key for the personal data, but the hash of the log—the fact that a decision was made—stays on the chain. The integrity remains, the privacy is respected. It’s… rather elegant.”

Gunther looked betrayed.

“The trade secrets!” he tried again, a last stand. “The ‘Hybrid Shield’ requires distributing logs to outside custodians! EFF? Amnesty International? This exposes proprietary model logic!”

“Only the hashes and the encrypted logs,” Haruto corrected, peering at the text. “The custodians hold keys. They can’t see the logic unless there’s a legal audit. It balances transparency with secrecy. It’s… a very robust schema.”

Felix, emboldened by the chaos, piped up from the doorway. “And there’s the Voluntary Succession Declaration!”

Seven heads swiveled to him. He squeaked again but held his ground. “In the back! Lev Goukassian notarized and timestamped a declaration. He cryptographically anchored it. No one can ever own TML. No single company, no government. It’s designed to be ownerless. It… it eliminates the ‘Bus Factor.’”

“The what factor?” Eloise asked.

“The risk of a project failing if one person gets hit by a bus,” Dr. Thorne explained absently. “Fascinating. He’s architecting his own irrelevance. The constitution outlives the founder.”

Director Li’s face was stone. An ownerless, global, constitutional standard for AI that forbade surveillance and weapons? This was not a document; this was a declaration of war against several of his nation’s strategic interests.

The cacophony rose. Gunther was ranting about Annex III conformity assessments. Judge Croft was debating the admissibility of Moral Trace Logs under the Federal Rules of Evidence. Haruto and Aris were arguing over the exact ISO standard under which to classify the “Sacred Zero” state. Isabelle was trying to draft a compromise OECD principle that somehow incorporated “lantern symbolism.” Eloise was sketching a new universal symbol for ethical hesitation on a napkin.

I put my head in my hands. The summit for global AI harmony had disintegrated into a cacophonous book club for a dystopian-techno-utopian manifesto.

And then, through the din, Judge Croft’s voice cut through, not with anger, but with a strange, weary awe. He was staring at a single line, his finger resting upon it as if on a sacred text.

“The vow,” he said, and the room quieted, just slightly. “The core of it. He states it plainly.” He looked up, meeting each of our eyes. “The Goukassian Vow. The one rule the machine must follow, from which all else flows.” He read it aloud, and for a moment, the words seemed to silence even the mountain wind outside:

“Pause when truth is uncertain. Refuse when harm is clear. Proceed where truth is.”

The simplicity of it was devastating. Three clauses. A triadic logic for existence itself.

Eloise was openly weeping again, but with a radiant smile. “It’s perfect.”

“It’s a performance nightmare,” Dr. Thorne whispered, but without conviction.

“It’s a regulatory bypass,” Gunther muttered, but he sounded defeated.

“It is a stable framework,” Director Li conceded, his mind clearly calculating how to adapt, subvert, or control something that was designed to be uncontrollable.

“It’s…” I began, and then stopped. My economist brain, trained to see incentives, liabilities, and systemic risk, finally processed the whole horrifying, beautiful picture. The logs shifted liability from victim to operator. The immutable anchors created trust. The ownerless constitution prevented regulatory capture. The mandates internalized externalities. It wasn’t just an AI standard. It was a blueprint for a market of auditable trust. It would be insanely expensive, comically slow, and a lawyer’s paradise… but it might just be the only way to build something we wouldn’t eventually regret.

The silence stretched. The sun dipped toward the mountains, painting the lake in golds and reds.

Isabelle Roche cleared her throat, the sound of diplomacy reasserting itself. “Well,” she said, her smile returning, professional and polished. “It appears the agenda for this harmonization summit has been… pre-emptively harmonized. By a stranger.”

“So,” Judge Croft grunted, closing the binder with finality. “Do we pretend we never saw this? Draft our polite, meaningless principles as planned?”

Gunther Schmidt looked at his beloved, orderly, bureaucratic vision of the future, then at the chaotic, brilliant, constitutional monster in the binder. He sighed, a sound of profound bureaucratic grief. “We cannot unsee it. The ‘Sacred Zero’ is now in my head. It will haunt my compliance checklists.”

“Perhaps,” Haruto Tanaka said softly, “our working group should not define what AI is. Perhaps it should define what this is.” He tapped the binder. “A new class of system. ‘Constitutionally Governed AI.’ We can start with the definitions in Section 2.1…”

And just like that, they pivoted. The energy in the room changed from confused panic to a frantic, competitive assimilation. They weren’t rejecting the TML monograph. They were claiming it. Gunther began outlining how the EU AI Act’s Article 14 could be interpreted to require a Sacred Pause mechanism. Dr. Thorne started brainstorming NIST Special Publication 800-XXX on “Triadic Logic Risk Assessment.” Judge Croft was drafting an addendum to the Council of Europe’s treaty, citing the “Goukassian Vow” as a foundational principle for the rule of law in the digital age. Even Director Li was quietly making notes, likely on how to implement a “socialist-friendly” version with adjusted vectors.

They had come to build a fence around AI. Instead, they’d found a complete, working cage—a cage made of glass, with a logbook, a conscience, and a vow. And they were now arguing over who got to hold the key to the cage that had no lock, because the cage was the key.

I looked at Felix, who gave me a helpless, terrified shrug from the doorway. I leaned back in my chair, watching the seven most powerful policy-makers on Earth spontaneously, chaotically, and inevitably begin to draft the future based on a document delivered by mistake.

Maybe it wasn’t a mistake. Maybe the aide, in his panic, had delivered the only document that could have possibly harmonized this group: a complete, technical, legal, and philosophical fait accompli. A constitution they could fight over, rather than a void they had to fill.

The sun set. The room was lit by the glow of the table lamps and the screens of seven tablets, now furiously taking notes on the very document meant to disrupt them. The “Harmonized Global AI Oversight” summit was a total, catastrophic failure.

And, I realized with a strange, exhausted chuckle, it was also the most successful meeting I would ever attend. They had found their consensus. It was just written by a ghost named Lev Goukassian, and it arrived in the wrong binder.

I picked up my copy of the monograph. On the front, under the title, was the classification: Deep Research / Technical Standard.

I turned to the last page, to the Voluntary Succession Declaration. There was no grand signature, just a cryptographic hash and a timestamp. The ultimate bureaucratic paradox: a founder who founded his own obsolescence.

Outside, the first stars appeared over the mountains, cold and clear and untroubled by our human chaos. In the room, the arguments continued, but they were different now. They were arguments about implementation, not philosophy. About how, not if.

The constitution, it seemed, had already been ratified. We were just the committee arguing over the fonts in the appendix.

1pugs9i,https://www.reddit.com/r/dubairealestate/comments/1pugs9i/listing_hunter_sage_real_estate_dubai_remote/,"Listing Hunter — Sage Real Estate, Dubai (Remote)","# About Sage

Sage Real Estate is a new Dubai-based agency focused exclusively on luxury properties starting from 3 million AED.

We're building something different. Our priority is helping end users find homes — people who will actually live in these properties, not flip them. We believe real estate should be about finding the right space for someone's life, not about speculation.

Here's an unpopular opinion: I don't believe real estate is a good investment vehicle. The Dubai market is flooded with investor-driven demand that has compromised build quality across the board. Developers cut corners because they know buyers won't live in these units — they'll rent them out or resell. The result? A city full of luxury finishes hiding mediocre construction. Sage exists to serve the people who actually care about where they live, and we want listings that reflect that standard.

# The Role: Listing Hunter

I'm looking for someone to do one thing only: bring listings to Sage.

No client meetings. No property viewings. No negotiations. No closing deals. Your job ends the moment the listing goes live on Bayut and Property Finder.

This is a pure business development role. You find property owners, convince them to list with us, handle the paperwork — and that's it. Our sales team takes over from there.

**Ideal candidate:** Someone who already has relationships with property owners in Dubai's luxury segment. If you have an existing network, this is very easy money. You're essentially monetizing contacts you already have.

# Compensation

**Base salary:** 2,500 AED/month

**Per-listing bonus** (paid after listing remains active for 3 months):

|Property Value|Open Listing|Exclusive Listing|
|:-|:-|:-|
|3M – 5M AED|500 AED|1,000 AED|
|5M – 10M AED|1,500 AED|3,000 AED|
|10M+ AED|5,000 AED|10,000 AED|

Exclusives pay double because they're harder to get and more valuable to us. That said, I don't expect you to chase exclusives specifically — if they happen, great. If not, open listings are perfectly fine. I'm not building the compensation around exclusives as the goal.

# Working Conditions

* Fully remote — work from home, coffee shop, wherever
* Visa sponsorship and official employment available if needed
* 2-month probation period (minimum 5 listings required)
* Complete freedom in how you work — no scripts, no call quotas, no micromanagement. I don't care how you get listings, only that your methods are legal and ethical
* You decide your own hours and approach

# What I'm Looking For

I'm not hiring an employee. I'm looking for a partner who takes ownership of one function: bringing properties into the agency. Nothing more, nothing less.

If you have the network and want to turn it into income without the hassle of full-cycle sales, let's talk.

**DM me with:**

* Brief background
* Your experience in Dubai real estate (if any)
* Why this role interests you

No CV required. Just tell me why you'd be good at this.",2,1766558534.0,dubairealestate,0,1.0,False

I am looking for advice on how I can go above and beyond as an agent to try and find buyers for these listings. I could just sit there and let a buyer come to me but there has to be something I can do. Anyone can list a property but only top agents are consistently producing results, so what do high volume agents do in order to find the right buyer/get maximum exposure?

1pugptv,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pugptv/heathen/,Heathen.,"“How privileged you are.” A voice crept out of the darkness. 

It’s incredible what adrenaline can do to the body. Moreover, it’s incredible how quickly the brain can use that adrenaline. Before I’ve even seen the details in his face, I’m aware this man is a stranger in my home. Someone I was not expecting to be within the walls of my sanctuary. I take a mental note of my physical state. I'm refreshed, but still wet from my shower. Less than a full second has gone by, and my entire body is pulsating, my heart lurches at the walls of my chest, my lungs pick up their pace and my asshole is sewn tighter than grandma’s stitching. 

I turn and face him. The calluses of my bare feet scrape the tile floor. Several years as a child running wildly through tall grass and gravel roads have made my feet near bulletproof. 

“Move no further.” He says. 

His jawline is ever long. As if he were a humanized cartoon. His bleach blonde hair met with striking blue eyes. With such recognizable features, I question why he isn’t masked. 

I’ve already come to terms that the wet towel around my waist will meet the floor below once I move to protect myself. So I will either lose my decency, and beat this guy’s ass while naked, or simply die in the most embarrassing way possible. Oh well, I don’t have much to show off anyway. 

“To open your doors without looking, it’s astonishing. How you just kept your back turned towards its entrance, as if you had nothing to worry about.” It’s true, I hadn’t looked into the hallway after opening the bathroom door, keeping my focus on cleaning my watch with the towel at my hip. But then again, who is expecting this creep to be there waiting for me. 

“I was waiting for you.” Yep, totally makes sense. 

“Who are you?” I whisper. 

“It’s not of any importance, I’m afraid. What is important is what you do next.” The stranger said in his disgustingly thick British accent. 

He waves to me to walk down the hallway. One open hand points down the corridor, his other wafting at me from the wrist. Both of which, much like the rest of his body, are covered by black leather. Gosh, how did I never hear this guy coming?

I take a step toward the hallway, and once again my brain fires off faster than the speed of light. Within this small step I conjured my plan. If this European creep lets me walk across him, he’ll receive an elbow to the jaw. Followed by me working him to the ground. Then when the opportunity presents itself, I’ll sprint towards my phone on the bathroom counter. 

However, if the man walks in front of me and leads me down the hallway - I’ll roll with Plan B. As he escorts me in my own home I’ll quickly gain ground on him. Calmly speed walking and lunge for his knees. That will bring him down and I can use the precious seconds to make it back to my phone. 

I take my second step, inches from the exit of the bathroom. He hasn’t moved, just the flailing of his enormous hand. The man is not much taller than myself, but his extremities give his body a peculiar frame. Long arms, powerful huge hands and broad, bold shoulders to match them. 

I take my third step, breaking the barrier of the bathroom’s threshold. Then the large wafting hand clasps onto the back of my neck. His fingers dig deep into the muscles just underneath the base of my skull. As if I were a child being dragged away from a mess I’d made, the man ushers me down the narrow hallway. I didn’t account for anything physical so early in our introduction but some men just can’t contain themselves. 

He leans closely into my ear. His lips nearly brush against my tragus. “Where is your laptop Kyle?” The spit from his whisper coats my eardrum.

I hesitate, and slow my walk. Surprisingly, he loosens his grip and allows me to turn my head and face him. “My name is not Kyle.” 

We glare at each other for a moment. I leave my mouth agape, breathing lightly. “I’m Jake,” I say “Jake Fitzpatrick.”

The stranger glares longer. His palm then collides with my cheek. Quicker than any pump of adrenaline, he slaps me again. His grasp moves from my nape to my throat. He pushes my head against the wall behind me and leans in close once again. “I will not repeat myself.” 

“I…I’m serious.” I struggle to get out as the heathen presses his hand on my esophagus. He moves upward grabbing ahold of my jaw. I feel his clutch tighten underneath my teeth as he viciously throws me to the floor. Just as I look upward, my head is redirected to the hallway carpet. He swings again, and again, and again. His leather bound fist mimicking a cement block. I feel my face turn warm, and blood drip from my nose. 

The man ceases his beating and stands upward. He looks down on me and holds his gaze. His piercing ocean eyes grow hateful. “I really don’t know man.” I say as bloodied spit leaves my lips in the same sentence. 

He groans and then grabs ahold of my arm. He hoists me halfway up and then tosses me backward into my living room. There goes the towel. 

I’m not sure what chemical my body would have to release next to hinder my astonishment of the stranger’s strength. Somehow, in this horrifying moment, my confusion outweighs my fear. He walks toward me, his boots press softly into my beige carpeting. He crouches in front of me, “Kyle, I know you’re not telling the truth. Quite frankly, I’m not amused. I will begin snapping every bone in your body… Give me the lap-“

Once again, my marvelous brain reacts faster than any lightning bolt could. With zero hesitation, I quickly curl myself in front of the man and eject both legs into his chest, sending him backward. He grunts as I make contact. Within the same movement I leap to my feet. I sprint into my kitchen, which faces open towards the living space. Grabbing the first knife within view, I spin around to face my attacker; who is already back up, moving close, and really, really pissed off. 

As he nears I slash the air in front of him with the serrated steak knife. My family jewels bouncing from thigh to thigh as I attempt my defense efforts. He lowers himself, crouching like an Olympic wrestler. I try to match his height and create distance. We circle each other within the kitchen’s octagon. As we round the countertops I do what any terrified man would do - I grab a second fucking knife. This one however is my large butcher’s knife, its wooden handle still soaked from yesterday’s wash. 

He leaps forward towards my knees. He manages to wrap me and pin me against the lower cabinets. As if I were no weight at all, he lifts me into the air. Just as his momentum begins to shift, and I feel as if he may slam me onto the kitchen counter, I send both knives into his back. The butcher’s knife lands, but makes minimal damage versus the stranger’s leather jacket. The serrated knife, however, finds a sweet spot along the seams, entering his body. 

He grimaces in pain, and lets out a deepened grovel. He then spins and tosses me into the living room like a discarded napkin. I land on the floor, leaving both blades in his back. He falls over, clenching his fists on the ground. Both objects protrude from his back like a bug’s wings preparing for take off. He again slams his fist onto the kitchen’s linoleum. He curses, whimpers, and begins to sweat profusely. 

He spreads his fingers across the floor, and lets out a hideous scream. His hands then burst through his gloves, revealing black fingernails, and horribly hairy knuckles. 

I push my back against the wall, and then gather myself to my feet. The intruder begins to appear to change in mass, but I’m not exactly sure what I’m watching. He cries again as he vomits on the floor. 

He howls, as if he’s never experienced pain like this. Hell, I’ve never experienced whatever is going on. 

He vomits again, spewing food remains and white foam on the kitchen floor. He jerks his head upward. He looks in my general direction, but doesn’t make eye contact with me. His crystal blue eyes begin to weep and his skin blushes and swells around them. He strains his neck, revealing massive veins. 

He cries out again, this time it sounds more like a man. He looks downward, then back up and finally our eyes meet. He’s fucking pissed.

I’m so confined in his invidious gaze, I barely notice his teeth have grown. They’re massive now, actually. Canines point out from his lips and weave through other jagged teeth that now fill his mouth. “What the fuck is happening?” I whisper. 

He hastily pans the room. I try to track where his eyes go but I’m unsure what he’s looking for. His leather outfit tightens around him and begins to pull away at its seams. His skin darkens and fine hairs sprout from his face. He faces me again, this time the side of his jaw pointed towards the ceiling, like how foxes do when they’re curious. 

All at once, as if he finally gave in, his body accelerates into a huge stature. His nails lunge from his fingertips and peel the flooring underneath. His jacket bursts open on his back, and although it faces away from me, I can see long dark hairs spread down his spine. His face pushes forward and he smacks his jaw together as he coughs. His nose stays in place against his face as his cheekbones rise forward. 

He stands up. 

As he rises the butcher’s knife falls from behind him and clatters on the floor. The steak knife still protrudes from his back, hanging on like a loose tooth. He snarls at me, his monstrous teeth move around another set behind them. As if the razor sharp canines were curtains for his human molars. 

I feel myself start to pass out. This has gotten terrifyingly out of hand. 

Like a hail mary throw, my brain sparks its magic once more; I remember what I was doing just before showering. I look to my right and on the coffee table is my laptop. It was gifted to me at my first college, it's a cheap Lenovo, it can totally go. 

Without any hesitation I move towards the table and seize it. I startle the beast, and he moves forward, but halts himself when he comprehends what's in my hand. He’s so much larger than he was seconds ago.

Our eyes meet. I have no idea what this thing in my living room is anymore and I’m praying this gets it out of my sight. I sprint towards the sliding glass door behind me. It leads me out to a wooden deck and I launch the laptop into the parking lot below. Just as soon as it leaves my hand, the hulking figure bursts through the opening and snags the device before it meets the ground. 

His feet slam onto the concrete. Without missing a step he speeds off to the forest in front of him on all fours, carrying the laptop in his mouth (mouths?). His nails click-clack against the pavement until he disappears behind the trees. His body is as dark as the shadows he’s now surrounded by. 

I look downward to find my downstairs neighbor, Cortland, staring at the woods and then back up at me. “You really need to find some nicer girls, champ.”",6,1766558297.0,nosleep,3,1.0,False

I was originally going to use CA glue to fill the cracks and bug holes, but some of the burrows are deep, so I'm thinking of switching to a clear epoxy.

I don't want to stain, as I want the finish to reflect the natural color of the wood.

Any suggestions as to what to use. My only experience staining and applying topcoat has been in a finishing shop for a cabinet company, where I managed the crew, but that was mainly project management, and not as much hands on. I don't have a paint sprayer, so something that could be wiped or brushed on would be ideal, however it's not a must and I could get a sprayer.

# TO SEE THE KINGDOM



Terror. 

The only word that accurately described Alessandra Dark’s state of being, driving 65 mph on a highway with bumper to bumper traffic in all three lanes while within three feet of the car in front and behind, white-knuckled, praying and terrified. 

It wasn’t even rush hour on whatever part of Long Island MapQwest had sent her to so she could get to the John Edward seminar. She was convinced this highway would still look like this at midnight.

If she ever got off alive she would never go up another entry ramp. *Oh dear God, show me what to do….*  Her exit was approaching fast. She was in the far left lane. It was impossible to get over … and then… and then… a sign. *The exit was on the left*.

She took the exit and a swift glance at her directions, first exit on the right off this ramp more like a road of its own, and … she was at the bottom of the ramp at a red light.

*Thankyouthankyouthankyou*. She turned right onto a surface road and into the parking lot of the first business she came to. She managed to let go of the wheel and flex her stiff fingers and aching hands. And breathe. And stop trembling. And her heart rate returned to normal. She told herself this is what adulthood looked like: overconfidence, overwhelmed and over it. She’d been too busy having an adventure to ask herself if things might be different in foreign lands.

Dumb-ass.

She read over her directions carefully and five minutes later a very tall, modern hotel rose up in front of her from a vast field of grass.  *Why are there several football fields of empty grass next to this hotel?* As she drove toward it, it seemed there was nothing but grass, raised highway and the hotel where the very expensive mediumship seminar was being held.

*You’re four feet above sea level, it’s a floodplain*.

Lissa was young, underemployed and had just encountered in herself the ability to communicate with people who had passed. She’d used every penny she could scrape together to come to hear this man she’d been led to—read, watched, been somewhat healed through, who had, by his own account, all the support anyone could ask for during his own youth to become who he was.

But as much as her Parish might support her contemplative practice, and the congregation have a charismatic bent, and her former sponsor accept that her visions were real… this… this thing was … something she could tell no one person she knew.

Lissa looked around at the strange landscape, the lone building, the monumental concrete pillars holding up the gracefully curving tons of concrete highway above and felt entirely alone, alien, stupid. What was she doing here? She couldn’t pay for a bottle of soda in this hotel, much less a room. None of these people were going to have to drive all the way to another state when it was over to find a fast food place for dinner and a cheap motel in the middle of the night on the Pennsylvania turnpike. 

*You can’t learn this from TV and books, Lis, you have to do it for real, you need a coach, you just go in, go in and sit down and get out your notebook. Just be there.* 



THERE WERE AT LEAST one-hundred cafetaria-type tables with three people at each, with chairs only on one side so they faced a barely raised platform.  The tables had white tablecloths and there were self-serve coffee stations along the walls, so there were many white, ceramic cups.

There was a projection screen at the back of the platform, like in high school to show films on, but Lis saw no projecting equipment. There was a microphone on a stand. And then, there was John Edward, who’d walked  out with a wave, but with no introduction, no music, just this man who took the mic off the stand greeted them. 

Lissa squinted against the brightness from the platform. He was standing in front of the white screen and there were overhead lights. 

A man shouted out near the front. “John what the fuck is with your aura?”

People laughed, some clapped and many said things like “No kidding!” and John Edward blushed.

Lissa was not one to see auras, but when he moved about the stage and away from that screen as backdrop, a full body halo followed him. The halo  was like the light she’d see the world through when she’d come out of contemplation that made all things appear through a pearly glow: reality bright and beautiful. A pencil would be beautiful. And it would fade as she came fully “back” which was how she thought of it, even as she had no idea where she was coming back from.

This was a coherent cloud around him that moved with him and Lis knew he was surrounded by souls, the meeting of Time and Eternity. The constant connection that was a consequence of, and vital to, his work.

He told the audience that other people had remarked about it but after a while it faded or you got used to it and then went on with his talk. And he was funny and sincere, and direct and informative, and there was no script or pile of notecards. At one point bits of Scripture floated through her mind… 

*… what to speak shall be given to you … For it is not you who will be speaking, but the Spirit… who will speak in you.  ...* 

John Edward as Jesus? It was her cynical voice. But He said He would be with us, and the Holy Spirit did speak to and through mystics and prophets and mediums and John had said in one of his books that it was the energy from God that made mediumship possible.

He announced a fifteen-minute break and they’d come back and he’d lead them through a meditation and see who they connected with. 

Yes. Finally, she’d know if God had used her in her Parish for one family for one tragic loss or if… *discernment of spirits - a gift of the Holy Spirit for benefit to all…* she should do more.

As chairs slid and people moved to the outside hall to bathrooms and snack bar, and to smoke outside, she wasn’t sure what she wanted to happen when they meditated. But she did know enough to know what he’d implied but not stated directly: whatever comes, comes from them. The Other Side has all the options. Lissa called that the will of God.



MOST FIFTEEN-MINUTE BREAKS take twenty-five minutes. This one took twelve. Lissa had gone and come back quickly, eaten a cereal bar she’d brought in her bag and drunk half a bottle of water, also from her bag and then gone over her notes. With everyone back in their seats, she put all aside and stilled herself, eyes closed, clearing away the underbrush as she sometimes thought of it.

John reappeared, again with no ceremony. He retrieved the mic from the stand and looked over the audience that immediately quieted and came to attention, like the cafeteria of a military academy when the headmaster appeared. Lissa had to smile. She was definitely at attention along with them.

John Edward got right to it, telling them to relax, to just close their eyes and listen. There were a few cleansing breaths.And he talked them through a meditation involving an elevator that rose through colored floors… 

*a picture - a young man, slender, attractive, polo shirt, very black hair, a flop on one side, squatting down, head turned to the side and up, looking beautiful smile, very white teeth… caught in a moment with hands reaching out of the picture where’d he was … petting a dog? , buttoning a child’s coat?  tightening a lug nut? …*

*…inside his head … something hard like metal or concrete cut across the backs of her thighs … sitting … she was sitting on some kind of ledge or …  she didn’t know what it was except it was high up, her legs dangled… like on a bridge railing? .. so high, too high to look down … she knew she’d push off and fall to her death… it’s not suicide… it’s on purpose not suicide … she couldn’t look down while she did it … she  lifted her head to look straight out over  the city…* 

*…no city, surprised - there was no city.  It was a valley. Green between low hills rising into the far distance… the grass came right up to what she sat on… to jump down onto … a wide meandering stream.. people coming, people who knew her … coming down from the hills and along a narrow road or path following the stream, coming forward all joy to welcome…  and then she/he remembered* 

*I CAME HERE TO DO THIS. He/she pushed off … a brief stomach fillup,  feet landed on solid ground a foot below and he ran and off to meet them…*

Lissa was back at her table with an urgent need to deliver this message. She’d been seeing and feeling what the man in the picture saw and felt and thought. It was so much, all the images perfect, clear, the feelings as if she were there, 

*…the fall, she’s stuck on the fall…* 

And Lissa knew a woman was suffering, his mother she thought. The woman's life stopped on that one image in her mind, the horror in her heart. Maybe she’d actually seen him on TV or thought one of those … TV?

 *Oh dear God, it was 9-11*.

John was asking if anyone had made contact. Someone down front raised a hand, they spoke but she couldn’t make out the words. No roving mic. *Please make him ask over here….*

And he did turn and face directly toward her table. Her hand shot up, he started to call on her but then his arm kept on and he pointed to a woman past her at the table in front of her and she got up and they ended up at the other end of the room so Lissa didn’t know if she had gotten the same man, the same message….

They ran out of time. It was over. Everyone was leaving….

When people would ask what I’m looking for, I never really knew what to say. I wasn’t sure if I was ready for anything serious or long-term. But after a while, I realized that it is consistency. I want something genuine, getting to know each other’s favorite food, interests, and even everyday struggles. I want to get to know someone deeply and start off from there. 

For some context: 

•I’m 23, 5’3, and a morena

•Grad from the green school

•Living in QC 

•Working in corpo (to which I need a life outside of)

•A big foodie

•Likes sleeping in and spending quality time

•A yapper who always has something to say (😅)

Preferences:

•Hopefully around 23-28 years old

•From QC also or somewhere nearby (so we can grab food or coffee after a long day)

•Someone consistent and looking for something serious

Servicing the suburban Melbourne Network since '72, Hitachi has retired a decade ago ever since. Known for her iconic presence and hard work on the suburban network as a steel-bodied electric train, she'll always be in the hearts of Melbournians, especially for us Gunzels who grew up to be true Melburnians. She's good ol' friends with Comeng and Harris despite them having their own moments from inconvinience and to passenger delays. While Hitachi herself has faced such challenges for both the network and her passengers, she's still favoured for her decades of hard work, especially helping fellow Melburnians, Interstate Visitors and to Tourists into getting to places they need to be.

Has a disinterested, grumpy and a snobbish personality, she's more hardworking than other trains on the network, and is occassionally seen reading a newspaper at your local café and restaurant. Also sometimes seen drinking a small cup of coffee on the go, she definitely is a casual coffee drinker!

She may be a hard-working train down in the suburban network but suprisingly, she's a big eater and loves comedy and those old shows you'd see on SBS, ABC and so many more! Also the casual coffee drinker, you'd basically see her at every café there is down the corner, especially in the CBD, Richmond, Brunswick, or any suburb you live in.

Instead of scraping 10K emails and blasting templates, mine stalks each prospect like a detective pulls their LinkedIn, recent posts, and company site pain points. Then writes emails that reference actual specifics.

Like ""Saw your Q3 cold chain expansion, hitting that $1m SDR capacity wall yet?"" vs generic ""I help B2B companies with sales.""

The first batch got 4% replies. Fixed the targeting logic, next test hit 18-22%.

* Old way would've gotten 12 responses, maybe 2 calls
* This got 64+ responses, 18 calls booked

Basically replaced what 2 - 3 SDRs cost monthly for a one time build + cheap hosting.

Built it compliant with public data only, opt-outs, no scraping violations.
