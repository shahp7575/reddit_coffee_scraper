I come from a smaller city that primarily has coffee shops run by local bakers instead of chain shops with set menus. This means the drinks are always phenomenal and there is always excitement on fresh baked items that usually change every week/month. 

Im living in downtown montreal and im searching for a place that prioritizes unique flavours of baked goods whilst having a good drink menu to be pair (though the uniqueness of drinks, I dont care for as long as its well made!). This seems like a question with auch obvious answers but at the same time I cant find anything besides coffee shops that are way out of ville-marie.

1qp1k9o,https://www.reddit.com/r/BertolottiSyndrome/comments/1qp1k9o/dont_waste_time_by_searching_after_what_is_the/,"dont waste time by searching after what is the meaning of life, because here that is","Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I've got a solid savings cushion for furnishing, getting a decent car, and whatever else I need to get settled. 

Never lived in California before so I'm completely clueless about neighborhoods and what's actually worth the premium pricing. I work remotely most days but will need to commute to downtown maybe twice a week max. Really into good food, nightlife, and would love to be somewhere walkable or at least bikeable for daily stuff. 



Not trying to be stuck in traffic for hours just to grab coffee. Also wondering if I should go for a high rise with all the amenities or find a sick house with outdoor space since I'll be working from home a lot. Money isn't really the limiting factor here which feels weird to say but my company is going all out on this relocation package.

1qp1grl,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyLaw/comments/1qp1grl/professional_opinions_please/,Professional opinions please,"I (M) was the victim of domestic violence three times last year for confronting my STBXW about her serial infidelity last year. Once was a day I had a surgery scheduled- I found more me on her phone and just simply approached her and said “I love you but this isn’t compatible with our relationship” and showed her her phone she left out. She started screaming. Continued screaming while getting in the car- and driving to the hospital she was screaming in my ear and into the side of my face while shoving me and punching me repeatedly in the arm and shoulder. Our at the time three year old was in the back screaming. We were going 60pmh plus, it was February in northern Wisconsin so there was some snow and ice on the road and there were other motorists around our vehicle. Her strikes and shoves made the vehicle swerve several times, one of the times- I got about a foot away from the rear quarter panel of a Buick enclave and was able to recover the vehicle all times it swerved. There’s way more from that day- but that’s the biggest

Then summer of the same year around end of June- she was convinced I was cheating on her because I was showing her work pictures- and I had three selfies on my camera. I never take selfies-  but I have a friend who owns a local bike shop and asked me to do overnight security for their event, inventor and business as they lost several high value mountain bikes last year and I have 8 years LE experience. I said yes- two over night 12s for $500 was a pretty easy choice. And as anyone who’s worked mids- around 2AM you get bored and so I was playing with snap chat filters. Had a few pictures where I was like “hey- I don’t look too bad” then promptly forgot they existed as I went back to real life work, house kids ect. She saw them and went into a death spiral about me cheating. I absolutely was not. She somehow (still lost on me) go into my locked (non Face ID) phone while I slept and found messages between me and a female coworker at the time. Nothing there- I knew her as a kid because her dad was in my military unit. She had struggled with addiction, as had I - all we talked about was above board recovery stuff and complaining about work schedules. And our communication was infrequent. Of course my STBXW went nuclear. Screaming following me around d making threats- I just said I’m disengaging and going to go sleep on the couch because this isn’t goi g anywhere good. So I did. AndI all take ambien so I took that. About ten minutes later- she comes storming g down the stairs. Sits in my legs and starts with the screaming and accusations again. Now at this point- the med is lightly kicking in- I’ve taken it for years I’m very versed in how I respond to it. But I have awareness that I cannot flee- because if I move at all, there’s a good chance that she may accidentally fall off my legs and hit the ground, or more on my mi d our coffee table. And even if it was an effort to get away- she was throwing her phone at my face repeatedly, split the bridge of my nose open and I’m bleeding pretty good. It all sunk in- I move, she falls, I more than likely go to jail, at minim till the figure out what happens- assuming I don’t get screwed there. So I take it. Never bring it up again 

Shortly after that- when confronting her again about infidelity- she starts screaming. She throws a glass of water on me, goes fills it up throws another one on me. As I’m bending over out my peripheral vision I see something- it’s a 1lbs jar of apple sauce she launched at me. Lucky I dodged it because I’d be typing this with a few less teeth. 

My question is I never called any of this in to the cops.  G the roast and a good friend know. But I don’t have proof- though I do have a scar on my nose 

She also stole one of my Vyvanse in September, and consumed it. Because I allegedly threw out hers (it was her friends) because she switched over to Ritalin and wasn’t diligent about picking up her medication- so needs to take something. I had her write a detailed letter to bring to my doctor and admittance to that so my pill counts aren’t off because I’m under extra scrutiny despite being two years in sobriety.

So, can anyone please tell me which books would be matching with this type of description? I mean the vibe and the feeling. It doesn't have to be the whole storyline, but it just has to give the same vibe.

So, imagine it's a post-rain night. It's like 1 or 2 a.m. A soft, cold wind is blowing through your window. The curtains are softly moving. The sky is extremely cloudy and dark because it just rained a while ago. It's not really raining now, but you can sense the petrichor in the air. And you are sitting in the bed in your own house, in your room. The house is empty. You are alone in the house. And you have a blanket with you, up to your torso. You are in your favourite night clothes, enjoying the breeze. And you can see faint moonlight through the clouds. There is a warm lamp light beside your bed and it's turned on. The room is not totally dark and the lamp light is not the only lit thing. You have another few soft lights turned on, so the room is a little bit more than dimly lit. And it's giving kind of 90s Hollywood type of comfy vibe. And from your window in the distance, you can see a small lake and a few houses. And in your bedside table, beside the lamp, you have your favorite book and a cup of hot coffee. And even with this peaceful surrounding, you feel a little bit of dread in your chest and you don't even know why.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

 I'm 22, using any pronouns, and looking for someone 18 plus, but under 30.

\-I'm in the CST timezone, but am pretty flexible with time differences. With this, it should be noted I work full time, and do school full time, but consider myself consistently online and able to reply.

\-I write third person past tense, and am semi-lit. I tend to match length.

\-I roleplay using dis cord.

\-I love OOC chatter and gushing about our little people! I'm a bit chaotic out of roleplay.

\-While this post is primarily to look for romance rp, and some subjects I like are 'adult' in nature, I'm looking for focus on slow burn pining, narrative, with fade-black, \*I'm just not in a place to outright roleplay dirty scenes.\*

Onto the prompt:

\[Slow-burn, hurt/comfort, angsty\]

I'm looking to play a 25 year old male character who's been dealt a bad hand in life, one of a fractured family, issues with religion and wasted potential. He's an intelligent bookworm, shy and socially awkward. Due to his past, hes struggled exponentially to fit in with his age group or people in general, and due to his upbringing he struggles even more with his attraction to men, and struggles further with his attraction to older men.

He's working in a coffee shop to support himself and his withering passions, meeting your character. I'm not too attached to this concept so feel free to suggest other alternatives. 

Ideally, I'd like the older male character to be grounded in reality. I don't really want like, Christian Grey bazillionaire, if that makes sense, but I wouldn't mind maybe a socioeconomic gap between my character and yours. I don't have a preference for how big the age/experience gap is. 

The idea is your character (possibly dealing with their own demons) helps mine find light at the end of the tunnel and (possibly mutual, if you want to go that route) acceptance of identity.

If you're interest, just DM me! Maybe start with any character ideas you have, or ideas about the plot you have (if you have any), along with your pronouns and timezone.",1,1769574345.0,RoleplayPartnerSearch,0,1.0,False

1qp198l,https://www.reddit.com/r/ConnectBetter/comments/1qp198l/how_to_actually_become_attractive_the_science/,"How to ACTUALLY Become Attractive: The Science Behind Magnetism (Not Just ""Hit the Gym"")","okay so i've been down a DEEP rabbit hole lately studying what actually makes people attractive. not the surface level stuff everyone parrots, but the real psychological, biological, and social dynamics at play.

here's what's wild: most advice about attraction is either completely outdated or just plain wrong. we're told to ""be confident"" or ""just be yourself"" but nobody explains HOW or what that actually means in practice. after consuming way too many books, research papers, podcasts, and honestly some unhinged corners of psychology youtube, i've realized attraction isn't some mysterious genetic lottery. it's a skill you can actually develop.

this isn't me flexing about my glow up or whatever. this is pure knowledge synthesis from legit sources because i was genuinely curious why some people just seem magnetic while others (who might be conventionally ""hotter"") feel completely forgettable.

**1. fix your attachment style before anything else**

seriously, this is the foundation. if you have anxious or avoidant attachment patterns, you're radiating insecurity or emotional unavailability without even realizing it. people pick up on this subconsciously within SECONDS of meeting you.

the book ""Attached"" by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller is genuinely life changing for understanding this. Levine is a psychiatrist and neuroscientist at Columbia, and this book breaks down how your childhood patterns are sabotaging your adult relationships and attraction. it's a NYT bestseller for good reason. after reading it i literally had to sit in silence for 20 minutes processing how much of my behavior was just anxious attachment in disguise. this book will make you question everything you think you know about why your relationships fail.

if you're dealing with deeper emotional stuff, the app Ash is genuinely solid. it's like having a relationship coach in your pocket who helps you work through attachment issues and communication patterns. way less intimidating than actual therapy if that feels like too big a step.

**2. develop actual interesting opinions and knowledge**

being hot but boring is social death. i'm not saying you need to become some pretentious intellectual, but you need to have SOMETHING going on upstairs that's uniquely yours.

read ""The Art of Thinking Clearly"" by Rolf Dobelli. insanely good read about cognitive biases and how to actually think independently instead of just regurgitating whatever's trending. Dobelli's a Swiss writer who studied philosophy and business, and he breaks down 99 thinking errors that make you look like everyone else. you'll start noticing patterns in conversations that most people miss, and that's magnetic as hell.

also, please consume media that's not just algorithm fed garbage. find a niche podcast, read about weird historical events, learn about something completely random. when you can casually drop interesting perspectives into conversations, people remember you. you become the person others want to talk to at parties, not the one they're trying to escape from.

if you want a more structured way to absorb knowledge from sources like these, there's this app called BeFreed that pulls from books, dating psychology research, and relationship experts to create personalized audio learning. you set a goal like ""become more magnetic in dating as an introvert"" and it builds an adaptive plan based on your personality and struggles. it's basically like having all these books and expert insights condensed into podcasts you can customize by depth (10 min summary vs 40 min deep dive) and voice style. way easier to fit into commutes or gym time than forcing yourself through dense books when your brain's fried.

**3. master non verbal communication**

here's something nobody talks about: 93% of communication is non verbal. your words matter way less than your body language, tone, and energy.

watch Charisma on Command's youtube channel, particularly their breakdowns of charismatic celebrities and movie characters. they analyze exactly what makes someone's presence compelling. the way you hold eye contact, your posture, how you use pauses in conversation, these are all learnable skills.

practice mirroring in conversations. subtly match the other person's energy and body language. this creates subconscious rapport and makes people feel understood around you. but don't be weird and obvious about it, just let it happen naturally once you're aware of it.

**4. get your nervous system regulated**

if you're constantly in fight or flight mode, you're gonna come across as either aggressive or skittish. neither is attractive.

""The Body Keeps the Score"" by Bessel van der Kolk is probably the best book i've ever read on trauma and how it lives in your body. van der Kolk is a psychiatrist who's been researching trauma for like 40 years, and this book is a NYT bestseller that completely changed how i understand stress responses. even if you don't think you have ""trauma,"" this book shows how everyday stress gets stored physically and affects how you show up in the world.

for daily regulation, try the Insight Timer app. it's got thousands of free meditations, breathwork exercises, and nervous system tools. the key is consistency. even 5 minutes daily will change how grounded you feel in social situations.

**5. develop your personal style (but make it actually personal)**

this isn't about expensive clothes or following trends. it's about signaling who you are through intentional choices.

figure out what subcultures or aesthetics genuinely resonate with you, not what you think will get you likes. whether that's dark academia, streetwear, minimalist, maximalist, whatever. just make it YOURS. people are attracted to authenticity and specificity, not generic ""inoffensive"" style.

get one or two pieces that make you feel genuinely confident and build from there. confidence isn't some internal state you manifest, it comes from knowing you look good and feeling comfortable in your own skin.

**6. practice storytelling instead of just talking**

boring people recite facts. attractive people tell stories that create emotion.

""Storyworthy"" by Matthew Dicks teaches you how to find compelling stories in everyday life and tell them in ways that captivate people. Dicks has won the Moth storytelling competition like 50 times, so he knows what actually holds attention. this skill is CRUCIAL. when you can make getting coffee sound interesting, you become memorable.

the structure is simple: stakes, struggle, transformation. every story you tell should have these elements, even if it's just about your day. this creates narrative tension that keeps people engaged.

**7. fix your voice**

nobody wants to hear this but vocal tonality matters SO much. if you have vocal fry, speak in monotone, or sound unsure of yourself, you're losing attraction points immediately.

record yourself talking and actually listen back. it's uncomfortable but necessary. work on speaking from your diaphragm, varying your pitch and pace, and eliminating filler words (um, like, you know). there are tons of free vocal exercises on youtube.

**8. become genuinely curious about other people**

attractive people make YOU feel interesting when you're around them. they ask follow up questions. they remember details. they're present in conversations instead of just waiting for their turn to talk.

this isn't manipulation, it's genuine interest in human psychology and stories. when you approach conversations with curiosity instead of anxiety about how you're coming across, everything shifts. people will literally tell you they ""just feel comfortable"" around you.

**9. have standards and boundaries**

desperation is the ultimate attraction killer. people want what they can't easily have. this doesn't mean playing games, it means actually having criteria for who you let into your life.

be willing to walk away from people who don't meet your standards. be okay with being alone. weirdly, this makes you MORE attractive because you're not radiating neediness. you become a person people want to impress instead of someone trying to impress everyone.

**10. work on your actual skills and competence**

nothing beats being genuinely good at something. whether that's your career, a hobby, a sport, whatever. competence is inherently attractive because it signals discipline, dedication, and value.

find something you can commit to improving at consistently. the confidence that comes from real skill development is completely different from fake affirmations. it's unshakeable because it's earned.

look, none of this is rocket science but it requires actual effort and self awareness. most people won't do the work because it's easier to just complain that attraction is unfair or genetic or whatever. but the people who do put in this work? they become the ones everyone wants to be around.

you're probably not going to transform overnight, and that's fine. pick like 2 or 3 things from this list and actually commit to them for a few months. small consistent changes compound into massive shifts in how people perceive and respond to you.

the cool thing about working on attraction this way is you're actually just becoming a better, more developed person. and that benefits every area of your life, not just dating or whatever.",1,1769574139.0,ConnectBetter,0,1.0,False
1qp18ng,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qp18ng,Inconsiderate and immature roommate,"
NOTE: These pictures are from newest to oldest. The blue bag with tomatoes on it was full of seasonings from out of the cupboard, was full for a month before i emptied it out on to the counter and took my bag back. 

Okay so I (18 F) live with my roommate (22F), and for the most part we get along. Or so she thinks. I’m going to start from the beginning so you can kind of understand how all of this adds up and why i’m on the verge of blowing up now. 

I move into the apartment, my freshman year of junior college. We both still have about 2-3 weeks until school officially starts, so she’s still at home at this point. I get there and the apartment is mostly clean, nothing super spectacular, looks like she took most of her things with her or left it in her room (idk i didn’t check.) After my parents and my bf help me unload all of my things into my room, they all eventually part ways and i’m left alone. This gave me time to kind of look around and take it all in. i start in the kitchen because i want to see what she has when it comes to dishes. (Her and i had previously texted and we both agreed that we could share things as long as we took care of them as our own…first mistake. bc she does treat it like her own.) i notice a dish drying rack, which i thought was slightly odd just because we have a dishwasher, and notice that the dishes on it are DIRTY. The more i look at things around the apartment, the more i notice how filthy it is. Now at about this time i also notice something else. Roaches. and not just any roaches, German Roaches. and if you know anything about them, they live on any ounce of filth in your house and are impossible to get rid of. so naturally i clean stuff, not thinking too much of it. 

small stuff like this continues to happen for the next few months and in between aug and now i had talked to her on a very serious note and told her that she doesn’t pull her weight (she is unemployed and a full time communications major) I understand how hard being a full time student is, I work part time at a grocery store and am a full time architect student. which is exactly why i was so frustrated with her. she would leave dirty dishes in the sink, regardless of who’s “turn” it is to do them (imo, if you see something dirty and it doesn’t take a huge amount of time to clean it, then clean it) she also wouldn’t replace things that she used such as paper towels or trash bags, and with me, constantly trying to figure out how i’m going to afford food, i don’t think i should have to replace it every time, especially since she uses her parents money. anyways, we have a talk and she says she’ll fix it. i also make sure to note that i refuse to clean up after her all the time because im not a housemaid, im another student just like her with even less time than she has.

then we reach, i wanna say about mid november. Then she decides that she can take care of a dog. Now mind you, i also have a dog, and i, yet again, didn’t think too much of it. i thought it would be great if my dog had a friend to play with because my dog absolutely loves other dogs. Why didn’t click in my head is that if my roommate can barely clean up after herself, why would she clean up after a dog. So we get him and he’s sweet, pretty quiet, not too messy. We only had him for a short period of time, but i remember thinking that she never really took him out as much as he probably needed. After a day or so of us having him, he continued to pee in my room and in the living room. I’m used to leaving my door cracked so my dog can go in and out as she pleases because her food stays in my restroom. However, that apparently is an invitation for the other dog to pee on my floor. At this point i was getting a little aggravated because they’re fostering a dog that isn’t potty trained and they clearly aren’t doing what they need to train him. Eventually he ends up going to another foster home and that’s it.  

Until about a week or so later they bring in ANOTHER dog. A bigger (but potty trained) dog. He was party Husky part German Shepard (probably.) Anyways, the loudest dog you could’ve ever met. He was super sweet but WAYYY too big for an apartment, especially one that isn’t consistently clean. She set up his kennel in the middle of the living room because she couldn’t fit it anywhere else (hint: maybe don’t get a dog that doesn’t fit in the space you have to give him) but anyways, he’s here for a while, and then winter break rolls around and she’s gone for a month (most peaceful AND CLEAN month ever)

Winter breaks over, and she’s back and so is the dog. Except this time he’s skinny. like super skinny. Big dogs need lots of food and she was only feeding him once a day. i remember saying something to her more than once about him looking a little thin and him needing to eat twice a day if she was feeding him in too little of portions. I’m not sure my advice was even heard, and went in one ear and out the other. so i contacted the shelter. they told me he had lost significant weight and she wouldn’t be able to take care of him anymore. I figured that would also mean no more fostering from there, period. Nope. She’s now fostering ANOTHER dog this week and i’ve had enough. She picks the biggest dogs she can find and doesn’t do any kind of research or anything about how to even feed a dog over the size of a football and now i’m frustrated. i’m not 100% sure but i’m pretty sure it’s from the same shelter as well and whereas i could call them bad names and tell them they don’t truly care for their animals if they’re letting this 22 year old toddler care for a dog, i under stand the need for homes, foster or forever. Im at a loss and i could contact the leasing office and say the foster dogs aren’t on the lease, but i also have (smaller) animals that aren’t on the lease. A lot. (two mice, two snakes and a fish.) 

Now, this is the biggest issue at hand but i also want to talk about the fact that they are messy. and not just disorganized messy, but gross messy. (hence why it took so long to rid of the roaches) While they were gone for a month, i did a lot of cleaning because i feel at peace when they arent here, and i enjoy a clean home. While they were gone i deep cleaned all of the rooms (aside from hers, obviously) including steam cleaning the carpet. Now, when i started i could obviously tell the carpet and rug were filthy and probably hadn’t been cleaned in the three years she lived there because god forbid she clean (im not even sure she’s knows how) and the water was black. i ran over the carpet over and over and apparently the carpet is a tan color. not brown. this just absolutely disgusted me. 

Ever since they’ve been back i’ve noticed that i’ve slept worse and that im less happy overall along with my skin starting to breakout (which may or may not be related) 

For example, i came home from class and work today (left at 9AM and didn’t get home until 6PM, left straight from class to go to work) and i just notice the amount of stuff they leave everywhere. Her bf’s guitar and amp in the living room, which ik hasn’t been touched because it’s been in the same position for days, her backpack on the living room floor, her lap desk on the couch, a random robe i’ve never seen either of them wear on the couch and trash and things that haven’t been put away on the dining and coffee room table. Mind you, im not in a bad mood at this point, i go and walk my dog and run around with her at the park for a while before coming back and cleaning with what energy i have left. I clean the kitchen while im cooking my dinner, dishes and all, including the dirty ones they left on the stove from this morning (aside from her bf’s skillet because i’m not sure how to properly clean it like he does, although there’s no way leaving grease and grime on it is any good for it) anyways, i eat and then i come back to clean the living room. The other dog (husky/shepard) has since been adopted but we still have all of his supplies which should’ve been taken back weeks ago, along with the first dogs bowls and bag of food (NOVEMBER!!) so i fold up the giant ass kennel and shove all of the supplies in a corner together in hopes they’ll get the hint. i also folded up and threw away a giant pile of boxes that they refuse to take to the dumpster. I wipe down the table and put away THEIR stuff because they won’t, and they come in while i’m mid-cleaning and dump all of their stuff on the tables and couch. at this point im defeated because i’ve spent an hour plus cleaning the apartment they refuse to help clean and so i hole myself up in my room for a while. i rant to my friends and they have no advice for me so im typing this now. I did at one point try and go out there and clean again but i watch my roommate open the fridge door WIDE open, get distracted and walk away for 45+ seconds, door still open, and then when i went to shut it, she looked at me like im stupid. maybe i’m not seeing certain things, but at this point i don’t think im in the wrong. they leave food on the table, counter, stove and floor and don’t bother cleaning it. they’re disgusting and im at a loss. i’m mad and upset and my emotions are a ticking time bomb and i need a way to not explode on them. please help.",3,1769574092.0,badroommates,2,0.8,False
1qp17cg,https://www.reddit.com/r/NightEatingSyndrome/comments/1qp17cg/seeking_where_is_goal_of_life/,seeking where is goal of life ?,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

J'ai posté mon projet de tracking de caféine récemment sur d'autres subs et les retours ont été super utiles. Comme c'est une communauté tech ici, je me suis dit que ça pourrait vous intéresser.

Je suis étudiant en génie logiciel et j'ai développé Caffeine Curfew parce que je ne trouvais pas d'outil qui prenait vraiment en compte la pharmacocinétique et la décroissance métabolique de la caféine pour préserver l'hygiène de sommeil. L'idée n'est pas juste de noter combien de cafés on boit, mais de calculer la demi vie du stimulant dans l'organisme.

Comme je suis juste un étudiant et pas une grosse boîte, avoir de vrais utilisateurs qui testent l'outil, ça vaut de l'or pour moi. Pour vous remercier, je voulais offrir au sub un accès gratuit aux fonctionnalités Pro pendant un an.

Laissez juste un commentaire et je vous envoie le code en MP.

C'est sans engagement. Si ça vous aide à gérer votre stack journalier, tant mieux. Si vous avez des retours sur la précision des calculs ou l'UX, je suis preneur à 100 %.

Voici le lien vers l'app, et merci d'avance pour le coup de main !

See here my father has never ever emotionally invested into me positively or negatively. I've never ever had a conversation with him like ever ever. The once my pitiful young self tried to have a conversation with him and he onned the car radio. These are the only way there's communication between us: 1. Humaira make me tea. 2. Is all your school things in check, why haven't you got your learners, make sure you listen to your grandmother. 3. Ai made this video for me.

If I'm being honest. He never really mattered to me, like ever. When he used to go on his trips when i was a kid, my mum would ask me if I missed my father and I'd stare at her blankly because I didn't even know that was possible. Possible to miss this man.

Oh you know why I'm writing this, I am actually so bothered right now. One reason I hate marriage and really don't want to do it, is because I've never seen a good man, like ever. Every marriage i know is cooked and the women just let it happen, I swear these women need to start having self respect because honey you're being walked all over and you're happy with it. Sometimes I think women enjoy this, because if you didn't, you'd make a change. But no, you fear being alone more than you fear loosing yourself. And most of yall already have.

Anyways, I digress. When I bring this up to my mum she always says ""but what about your father"" and I'm like ""what about him"" and she's like ""his a good man, shame he really is"". And I'm like yea maybe his a good husband, which his not by the way, but not a good father. When mum fights with him every few years and mentions divorce I'm just like if only you were not a coward and would just do it, because theres literally no difference to our lives. We just don't have to make tea as often. Which i think is a bonus. But alas, she stays. But yea, her standard for ""a good man"" is him providing and not abusing us. And to hell with those standards. Because if that's ""a good man"" I'm staying single until I scope the entire earth for an actually good man. But yea it bothers me. Like I just don't have any emotional connection to him, his just there and sometimes I do wish I had an actual father. To me, he is just another person I see occasionally whom I have to make tea for. Example you're in a coffee shop and you see a random guy daily whom you make coffer for and that's it.

You know what does hurt me, is when he hurts my mum. When he repeatedly chooses his own mother over his wife and family or when he doesn't value and respect my mum. That hurts me, that bothers me. But at the end of the day that is her choice and so be it. It used to bother me so so so much (it still does hurt because it's my mother and I love her) but also that was her life choice. She made that decision and I can't blame her, she's human, she choose to be a doormat and so be it. It was her choice and I support her in her choices good and bad and I love her through it because she's never going to change. It used to eat me up to the point where I'd hate my father. But like I just don't know him, like you can't hate on someone you literally don't know. I'm neutral. 





Also he looks at me as inferior. I don't know what that's about, like you know when you're in public and someone just looks at you like ow shame.

I've had dogs my whole life and work in the dog care industry, so I'm pretty experienced with  their body language and behavior. I have a 1.5 year old dog (female, spayed) that I've had since she was a puppy, and recently I adopted a 16 week old male orange kitten (neutered). Introduction was slow, as I was worried my 60lb dog would play too aggressively or go after him. She's actually doing very well. We've had no actual alterations, she watches him from afar and approaches occasionally until he hisses/swats at her, then she returns to me. 
My confusion comes in with his behavior around her. Sometimes he'll dash under the coffee table, approach her legs, and hiss/swat at her. We'll also be laying down together and he'll bite and paw at her feet, but then swats and hiss at her face before going back to swatting at her paws. My dog really just lets this happen. 
My confusion is whether or not this is him trying to initiate play? My dog is very good at giving him space, but then he'll run up to her and hiss, growl, and swat, even when they're laying next to each other. (Theyve slept right next to eachother comfortably.) If this isn't him trying to play, what is it? How can I alter my environment to make him feel more comfortable? The intro has gone really well otherwise and I want to make sure theyre comfortable playing and coexisting.
My kitten is very sweet and affectionate with me and has no other unexpected behaviors. He does seem to be curious about what my dog is doing.",1,1769573667.0,CatAdvice,1,1.0,False

He was in the target’s bedroom, and everything was perfect. The target was alone, unaware, bent over a desk, counting something that didn’t matter. Moonlight spilled through half-closed blinds, painting stripes across the carpet. Dust floated lazily in the light, unnoticed by the target.

The assassin didn’t even consider a gun. Even a suppressed pistol would never be silent. He had learned that lesson the hard way once—almost got himself killed. The memory of that night clung to him: metallic scent of blood, echoing gunshot, the bitter taste of fear. He carried it like a scar.

The air smelled faintly of cedar and old laundry. He could hear the faint hum of the building’s HVAC, the distant horn of a car on the street below, the soft scrape of his boots on the carpet. Careful. Quiet. Every muscle coiled, every movement deliberate.

The knife in his hand was cold, heavy, balanced perfectly. He focused on nothing but the motion and the outcome.

He struck.

The blade sank into the target’s chest, straight through the heart. They collapsed. Blood spread across the floor, dark and slow, pooling beneath the light. For a heartbeat, he watched the life leave their eyes.

He felt nothing. Not yet.

Later, in some nameless hotel room, he would drink coffee, turn on the TV, scroll through his phone, and try to remember what it felt like to live a normal life. He used to have friends. They called him Alex. Saturday nights were theirs—elbows on the bar, laughter spilling across scratched tables, a pint in hand, someone trying to beat him at pool. Then home, where the TV flickered and popcorn burned, the comfort of ordinary life pressing around him like a warm coat.

Life had been simple. Until it wasn’t. A mugging. A gun. Medical bills he couldn’t pay. Debt that buried him alive. Alexander Torres was ruined.

He became an assassin. A ghost. He never missed. He never left a trace.

But he remembered everyone he killed. Every one. Even the most ordinary. Criminals. Terrorists. Serial killers. Money launderers. Faces. Families. Friends. Voices he would never forget. Even the most mundane of them had left marks he could never erase.

Sometimes, he could still hear them. Whispering. Screaming. Laughing. He closed his eyes. He shut it out. Tried to breathe. Tried to sleep. Tried to forget. But sleep was fleeting, and the memories were relentless.

Every assignment had its rhythm. Observation. Planning. Execution. He knew the target’s route, the sound of their keys, the timing of their evening coffee. Every motion anticipated, every second scheduled. Time was never a problem. Precision always came first. Always.

When the job was done, he moved on to the next. It always worked this way. Always like clockwork. Every step measured. Every second accounted for. And yet… the faces lingered. The small mistakes. The forgotten movements. The questions of whether he had done the right thing.

The hotel room was quiet. The city outside hummed with life, unaware of him, unaware of what he had become. The walls, the ceiling, the narrow bed—it all felt sterile and small, a cage he had chosen willingly.

The phone buzzed across the nightstand. Same number as always.

Alex stared at it.

The light from the screen reflected on the hotel room’s walls. Shadows stretched across the carpet, reaching like long fingers toward the bed. The blood, the faces, the echoes—they waited for him. Always waiting.

He took a slow breath.

His fingers hovered just above the phone.

Day 1 - Smooth, got my work done without any distractions. It worked! Had slight headache for rest of day but was ok.

Day 2 - Again smooth while on it, got my work done. Coming off it around 5 hours after I felt a bit low and flat with slight anxiety. 

Day 3 (today) - Around 1 hour after taking I have a mini panic attack because I just feel a lot of anxiety. I feel like hyper aware of my surroundings and feel like my friend is looking at me when he’s not. I was getting overwhelmed so downed some orange juice as heard it can lessen the effects and calmed down.

I’ve got no history of other mental health issues, I had the same sort of experience feeling panicky and trapped in a bad way about 15 months ago when I smoked weed (probably way too much) - but haven’t smoked since and only smoked a handful of times in total. 

Also no other known mental health issues in my family. I suspect I may have a tiny bit of OCD but nothing that bothers me day to day. 

Quite upset with my experience as after the first day I was happy it helped me finally get stuff done! I’m thinking of taking half a tablet (2.5mg) tomorrow and seeing if a lesser dose is what I need? Though 5mg already seems pretty low and I’m an 80kg 6”4 male. 

I’ve had a really good experience with caffeinated (80mg dose) green tea matcha drinks instead of coffee to help my ADHD for a couple hours. With dexamfetamine like focus and 0 side effects.

The air smelled faintly of cedar and old laundry. He could hear the faint hum of the building’s HVAC, the distant horn of a car on the street below, the soft scrape of his boots on the carpet. Careful. Quiet. Every muscle coiled, every movement deliberate.

The knife in his hand was cold, heavy, balanced perfectly. He focused on nothing but the motion and the outcome.

He struck.

The blade sank into the target’s chest, straight through the heart. They collapsed. Blood spread across the floor, dark and slow, pooling beneath the light. For a heartbeat, he watched the life leave their eyes.

He felt nothing. Not yet.

Later, in some nameless hotel room, he would drink coffee, turn on the TV, scroll through his phone, and try to remember what it felt like to live a normal life. He used to have friends. They called him Alex. Saturday nights were theirs—elbows on the bar, laughter spilling across scratched tables, a pint in hand, someone trying to beat him at pool. Then home, where the TV flickered and popcorn burned, the comfort of ordinary life pressing around him like a warm coat.

Life had been simple. Until it wasn’t. A mugging. A gun. Medical bills he couldn’t pay. Debt that buried him alive. Alexander Torres was ruined.

He became an assassin. A ghost. He never missed. He never left a trace.

But he remembered everyone he killed. Every one. Even the most ordinary. Criminals. Terrorists. Serial killers. Money launderers. Faces. Families. Friends. Voices he would never forget. Even the most mundane of them had left marks he could never erase.

Sometimes, he could still hear them. Whispering. Screaming. Laughing. He closed his eyes. He shut it out. Tried to breathe. Tried to sleep. Tried to forget. But sleep was fleeting, and the memories were relentless.

Every assignment had its rhythm. Observation. Planning. Execution. He knew the target’s route, the sound of their keys, the timing of their evening coffee. Every motion anticipated, every second scheduled. Time was never a problem. Precision always came first. Always.

When the job was done, he moved on to the next. It always worked this way. Always like clockwork. Every step measured. Every second accounted for. And yet… the faces lingered. The small mistakes. The forgotten movements. The questions of whether he had done the right thing.

The hotel room was quiet. The city outside hummed with life, unaware of him, unaware of what he had become. The walls, the ceiling, the narrow bed—it all felt sterile and small, a cage he had chosen willingly.

The phone buzzed across the nightstand. Same number as always.

Alex stared at it.

The light from the screen reflected on the hotel room’s walls. Shadows stretched across the carpet, reaching like long fingers toward the bed. The blood, the faces, the echoes—they waited for him. Always waiting.

He took a slow breath.

His fingers hovered just above the phone.

And he answered the call.",1,1769572936.0,shortstories,2,1.0,False

Rather awful. 

I know these can be 'normal' upon starting up. I am not willing to go through that again! 

My GI symptoms (for a couple of years now) have been lots of poop building up (and passing one-two poops per day) but often they get stuck in rectum for a day and very uncomfortable. Never feel empty in my body, never feel finished. It's a weird situation. 

Perhaps increased motility is not what i need? will have the manometry testing and look into pelvic floor...

I know the Motegrity affects the serotonin receptors in gut which have always been sensitive and reactive (like when i've tried antidepressents)...

I wonder if trying .25 of a pill could be worth it? I DO NOT want to go through what i went through, yesterday. It was scary! 

Haven't tried Linzess or any others. 

Coffee, Miralax help...not sure about fiber, not sure about other things....

1qp0knd,https://i.redd.it/aw3kegemi0gg1.png,He Lost Me When He Choose His Stepsister,"For the nth time, I tried to seduce my husband, Troy Green, but failed once again to consummate the marriage, so I decided to call my brother. “Brother,” I said softly, “I’m going to divorce him.” “Thalia, I warned you, didn’t I? That man… he’s ice. Emotionally constipated. Romantically detached. A walking void in an expensive suit.” I thought I could fix him, make him love me, but I was wrong. When the call ended, I walked back to my room only to hear suppressed sounds from Troy's private room. Troy sat on the couch, shirt half-undone, hand moving fast between his legs as he watched a video of Bianca laughing on the beach. Everything was clear to me now. He didn’t reject me because he didn’t feel desire. He rejected me because his desire had nothing to do with me. What's worse is that when his stepsister Bianca threw a tantrum and hit my head that needed hundreds of stitching, he didn't even care and just grounded Bianca for a day. I was done being disregarded, unloved, and untouched, thus I decided to leave him with the ache of losing the woman who once begged for his love... and now it will be his turn in bended knees. -- For the nth time, I tried to seduce my husband, Troy Green, but failed once again to consummate the marriage, so I decided to call my brother. The divorce papers lay untouched on the desk as I held the phone to my ear with trembling fingers. “Brother,” I said softly, “I’m going to divorce him.” There was a beat of silence. Then, Nathan’s voice came through, calm and unsurprised. “Thalia, I warned you, didn’t I? That man… he’s ice. Emotionally constipated. Romantically detached. A walking void in an expensive suit.” A small, broken laugh escaped my lips. “I thought I could fix him. I really thought if I loved him hard enough, he’d love me back.” “You’re not a repair shop, Thalia. You don’t fix people like him. Listen, come to New Zealand. The beaches are beautiful, the men actually know how to touch a woman. Let Troy Green rot in his glass mansion, untouched and unloved.” I leaned my head back against the wall, breathing through the burn in my chest. “I’ll book the flight once the papers are signed.” “Good,” Nathan said, his voice softer now. “You deserve better. You always have.” When the call ended, I didn’t move for a long time. Then I stood. The corridor was quiet, the marble floors cold beneath my bare feet. I passed the guest wing, the lounge, then paused outside the room at the far end of the hallway. That was Troy’s private sanctuary. A room he always kept locked. A room I was never allowed to enter. Tonight, it wasn’t locked. And from inside, I heard a sound. A low groan. Drawn out. Suppressed. I froze. My fingers brushed the edge of the door, hesitating. Troy was on the couch, shirt half-undone, pants pushed down around his thighs. His back arched slightly, one hand gripping the edge of the cushion, the other working between his legs with a familiar, practiced rhythm. His head was thrown back, lips parted, eyes locked on the screen in front of him. But what turned my stomach—what turned my heart to dust—was what he was watching. It was her. Bianca. His stepsister. The video was from a summer vacation, one we all took together three years ago. I recognized the scenery instantly—waves crashing behind her, the cliffside covered in wildflowers. Bianca was at the beach, laughing, hair wind-blown and sunlit, wearing a white dress that clung to her figure like a second skin. She twirled for the camera, spinning like she was in a perfume commercial. She ran toward the waves, arms outstretched. She turned and smiled, radiant and playful. And then—Troy whispered her name. “Bianca…” Not once. Twice. His voice was breathless. Reverent. I staggered back a step, the world spinning around me. The floor felt miles beneath my feet. My ears rang. This wasn’t the first time. I remembered the first time I caught him watching something on his phone late at night. He had fallen asleep with it in his hand. I told myself it was nothing. Then another time, I found printed photos of her in his desk drawer. Casual shots from family vacations. Bianca by the pool. Bianca in a sundress. Bianca smiling up at the sky. I asked him about it, and he said he was archiving old memories. I believed him. But tonight, there was no denying it. He was watching a video of his stepsister—and pleasuring himself to it. I leaned against the wall and closed my eyes. The first time I met Troy was at a yacht party Nathan hosted. I couldn’t look away. He was nothing like the men I’d dated before—he was mystery. And I fell. So hard. So fast. So stupid. I begged Nathan to introduce me. I made sure we crossed paths again and again. Eventually, he agreed to marry me. No proposal. No ring. Just a quiet, emotionless: “Marriage works for me. If you want it, I don’t mind.” Our wedding night was a disaster. He never came to the room. He slept in his study. And every night after that was a variation of the same rejection. I tried everything. Lingerie, weekend getaways, wine, massages, midnight kisses. He wouldn’t touch me. For two years, I’d been nothing but a ghost in this marriage. A pretty shadow that cooked his meals, smiled at galas, and went to bed cold every single night. But tonight made everything clear. He didn’t reject me because he didn’t feel desire. He rejected me because his desire had nothing to do with me. That night, I didn’t sleep. I just lay there in bed, staring at the ceiling, waiting for the sun to rise. Waiting for this nightmare of a marriage to be over. And when dawn broke, I got up and dressed. When I walked into the kitchen, he was already there, sipping his morning coffee, flipping through a financial report. He didn’t look up. “Where’s breakfast?” he asked absently, like I was the maid. I opened the fridge, took out a bottle of water, and answered without turning around. “I didn’t cook.” He looked up, blinking like he didn’t understand. “What?” “I said,” I repeated, calm and clear, “I didn’t cook. Just eat somewhere else.” His brow furrowed. “Why not? What’s going on?” I turned then. Met his eyes head-on. “I’m leaving,” I said. He stood up slowly, confusion etched into his face. “Leaving? Where are you going?” I smiled. But there was no sweetness left in it. Only frost. “None of your business.” Chapter 2 I just walked away, and grabbed the keys to the Maybach, and drove straight to the divorce lawyer’s office. The receptionist gave me a look that said you again?, but I ignored her and walked in. Attorney Rosario was sitting behind his polished mahogany desk. His tie was crisp, his smile tight. “Mrs. Green,” he greeted carefully. “I received your message. But I’m afraid I can’t—” “Cut the formality,” I said, placing the unsigned divorce documents on the desk. “I want this done. Today.” He cleared his throat. “Thalia… this isn’t just anyone. We talked about this already. Troy Green’s family—his father owns a third of the east-side properties. His name opens doors. He has connections that could bury me.” I leaned forward, locking eyes with him. “And I’ve lived two years of silence. Two years of cold rejection. Two years of pretending my marriage wasn’t a farce. There’s no love here. There never was. Just a man obsessed with someone who isn’t me.” He shifted, uncomfortable. “Still—” “I’m not asking for your sympathy. I’m begging you to do your job. Get me out of this cage.” He stared at me, then finally sighed. “Fine. I’ll file it. It’ll take a few days. But once it’s in, it’s done… and if he says no, I don’t have any say on it.” My throat tightened. I nodded. “Thank you.” I walked out with a weight off my shoulders and a new one building in my chest. Next, I headed to the embassy. Filled out the necessary forms. Submitted the paperwork. I was done being a citizen of Troy’s world. Soon, I’d be gone. And this nightmare would be nothing but a memory I wouldn’t visit again. By the time I stepped back outside, the sun was warm on my face. My chest still hurt—but for the first time, the pain wasn’t sharp. Just dull… survivable. That’s when I remembered Troy’s credit card. I never used it—not once. Never asked for gifts, jewelry, nothing. I’d been the perfect wife on paper and an invisible one in practice. So I opened my phone and started swiping. Designer coats. Cashmere dresses. Heels so tall they looked like weapons. A sapphire clutch I didn’t need. Everything I saw—I bought. Whatever. I deserved this. For every night I sat alone in that freezing marital bed. For every time I cooked him dinner and watched him throw it away untouched. For every rejection, every bruise my heart collected in silence—I deserved this. And of course, Troy noticed. Halfway through the fifth store, my phone buzzed. TROY: “What’s going on with the card?” I smirked and texted back without skipping a beat: ME: “You said do something that makes me happy. This is it. Are you going to stop me now?” A moment later, his reply came. Just one word. TROY: “Fine.” I laughed softly. Victory had never tasted so sweet. I stepped into another boutique, arms already full of bags. The cashier stared at me like I was royalty. And that’s when she walked in. Bianca. Hazel eyes. Brown hair. A beauty mark under her left eye. She stopped mid-step when she saw me—and all the shopping bags surrounding me. “What the heck is this?” she hissed. “You gold-digging trash—are you trying to make my brother go broke?!” I didn’t even flinch. “I’m not a gold-digger. I’m his wife. So I deserve this.” “Deserve?” she scoffed. “No, you don’t. You’ll never deserve anything from him. You stole this life. That bag,” she pointed, “that dress. I want it. It’s mine!” I rolled my eyes. “You want the dress? Buy your own.” She stormed over, grabbing the same cream Dior gown I had in my hand. “Let go!” “No.” We yanked at the fabric, both of us tugging until it tore straight down the middle with a loud rip. Silence fell. Bianca’s face twisted. “You're shameless,” she spat. “You’re the reason Troy doesn’t talk to me anymore. Ever since he married you, he never visited me again, never looked at me the same way. You ruined our relationship! I should have said this before but I was thinking of my brother but I really hate you!” I blinked. “So what? That’s not my fault he married me. You are just his stepsister.” “It is your fault! You took him away from me!” And before I could react, she yanked a stiletto off one of the display mannequins and swung. The heel struck the side of my head. I stumbled, stunned. Warmth bloomed down my temple. I reached up—and my fingers came away red. “Die!” she screamed as she hit me again and again. “Die! Die! Die!” Chapter 3 When I opened my eyes, everything hurt. The ceiling above me was too white. The fluorescent light buzzed faintly overhead, pulsing against the pounding in my skull. I tried to move, but even turning my head sent a sharp wave of pain slicing through my scalp. “Easy there,” a voice said. A nurse hovered beside me, her voice gentle but concerned. “You were brought in by a good Samaritan. Passed out in a pool of blood at a boutique. Head trauma. You lost a lot of blood—got hundreds of stitches.” My hand instinctively moved to my head. It was bandaged. Aching. Throbbing. I blinked slowly. “Who brought me here?” “We’re not sure. They didn’t leave a name. Just dropped you off and disappeared.” “So… no family?” The nurse hesitated. “We called your emergency contact. Your husband, Troy Green. Also listed your in-laws. But…” she gave me an awkward smile, “no one’s come. You’ve been here for nearly twelve hours.” I stared at her, waiting for the punchline. Nothing. “Twelve hours?” My voice cracked. She nodded and handed me my things. “Phone’s in there. Maybe try calling him?” I clutched the phone with trembling hands. My screen lit up—no missed calls. No messages. I dialed Troy’s number. Straight to voicemail. Again. And again. The fourth time, I stopped. Instead, I opened Instagram. The moment the app launched, a notification popped up. BiancaGreen\_ went LIVE. I tapped it. My breath stopped. Troy was right there. In the video. They were in Milan. He held shopping bags in both hands, trailing behind Bianca while she giggled at the camera. “My brother’s been spoiling me rotten,” she said to her viewers, blowing a kiss toward the screen. “Best brother in the world.” I watched as he handed her a drink, then smiled faintly when she leaned in and kissed his cheek. I couldn’t breathe. I was bleeding out in a hospital room, alone. And they were shopping. Together. A scream clawed its way up my throat before I could stop it. I hurled the phone across the room. It bounced off the wall and hit the floor with a crack. The nurse rushed in. “Miss Thalia, are you alright?” I wasn’t. But I’d never been. “I want to report an assault,” I told her. “Now. Call the police.” A few minutes later, a young officer walked in, clipboard in hand. He looked bored. “Miss Thalia Green?” “Yes.” “You’re reporting an assault by… Miss Bianca Green?” “Yes.” He looked at me. Something in his eyes shifted. Then he sighed. “I’m sorry, ma’am. We’ve been instructed not to move forward with any charges filed by you against Miss Bianca Green.” “What?” I stared at him. “She attacked me. I have stitches. Hospital records. Witnesses!” He didn’t flinch. “We were told you may be suffering from mental instability. That you have a history of emotional outbursts and exaggerated claims. It was recommended we advise you to speak directly with your husband.” The air left my lungs. Troy. Of course. He owned this city. The police. The hospitals. The narrative. I had no one. No voice. No power. I was drowning in a sea Troy controlled with a flick of his finger. I lay back in bed and stared at the ceiling. Hours passed. The day blurred into night. And then I heard the door click open. He didn’t knock. He just walked in, still in that same custom-tailored suit, hair perfectly styled, face unreadable. I sat up. “Troy—” “Apologize to Bianca.” No hello. No concern. My jaw clenched. “What?” “You heard me.” I stared at him. “I was in the hospital. I had stitches. She attacked me.” “You tried to file an assault case against her,” he snapped. “Do you really think I wouldn’t find out?” “She hit me with a shoe! She split my head open over a dress and called me a gold digger!” “She’s my sister,” he said coldly. “She was just trying to protect me. You went on a shopping spree like you were emptying my account. What did you expect?” “That was the first time I used your card. Ever. I’m your wife.” “She is my stepsister.” I blinked. “What?” I felt something inside me crack. “You’re choosing her over me,” I said. “Your wife.” He didn’t even hesitate. “Yes.” The word dropped like a blade. I exhaled in a sharp breath, but it felt like my lungs refused to expand. “That’s unfair! I almost died!” “Yet, you didn’t. You know her. It’s just her temper, okay? And she didn’t mean it. I grounded her for a day, and took her card. That’s done.” “No, that’s not done—” He shook his head like I was the one being unreasonable. “I’m not having this conversation again. You’re going to apologize to her. End of story.” He turned to leave. “Take a rest,” he added without looking back. “I still need to take care of my sister. She was traumatized seeing you like that, you were covered in blood.” The door closed behind him with a soft click. I sat there in silence. Blood still crusted around my scalp. A dull ache bloomed in my skull. And the only person who should’ve held me… left me again. For his stepsister. Chapter 4 The hospital walls were quiet. And for the next three days, I didn’t hear a single word from my husband. Not a call. Not a text. Not even a cold glance through the door. Instead, he sent nurses. Round-the-clock professionals, paid to check on me like I was a client on a bill. They never used his name, never said where he was. But I already knew. Because I saw it all on social media. They were in Sweden. Troy and Bianca. One post showed Bianca posing on a glass-bottom bridge over a glacier. Another had her pouting beside a fireplace, Troy’s coat draped around her shoulders. One video caught them sharing fondue. Bianca giggled at the camera, feeding him a piece of strawberry dipped in chocolate. “My brother spoils me sooo much,” she said sweetly. “Best vacation ever. Recharging with my favorite person.” I closed the app and stared at the ceiling. I remembered how, when we first got married, Troy kept his distance from her. Barely spoke a word. I thought maybe they weren’t close. Maybe she just annoyed him. It didn’t matter. But now… I knew better. He wasn’t ignoring her. He was avoiding temptation. And now, he wasn’t bothering to hide it at all. They were together. Not just as siblings. No one looked at their sister the way he looked at her in that video. And she? She looked like she’d already won. I pressed my palm against my chest and exhaled. Just a few more days. Just a few more hours. I had already filed for the divorce. My visa would arrive soon. I’d already made quiet arrangements with the embassy. My ticket out was coming. All I had to do was survive until then. On the fifth day, I was finally cleared for discharge. I changed out of the hospital gown, packed my things, and signed the paperwork. The nurse wheeled me to the lobby. That’s when I saw them. Troy. And Bianca. Sitting side by side. Bianca had shopping bags in her hands—designer names in bold gold fonts, as if she was here for a runway rather than an apology. “Thalia,” she called sweetly. “You’re looking better!” I didn’t answer. She walked over, holding out the bags like a peace offering. “I got you something,” she said, smile sugary. “Consider it a gift. I didn’t mean for things to get so… crazy. But everything’s fine now, right? We’re okay. Especially since my brother and I made up. That little incident actually helped us reconnect.” I blinked. Then I scoffed. “You mean the part where you split my skull open? That little incident?” Bianca flinched—then immediately ducked behind Troy. “Wait… is she going to hurt me again?” she whimpered. “Brother, I’m scared.” Troy stood between us. “No,” he said calmly. “She’s not.” Then he turned to me, jaw clenched. “Apologize to her. Now.” My chest constricted. “What?” “You heard me,” he snapped. “We already talked about this. You’re going to apologize. She’s shaken. She’s still scared. It’s the least you can do.” I stared at him, blinking through the haze of disbelief. “You want me to apologize,” I said slowly, “to the woman who assaulted me?” “She’s my stepsister,” he said. “I don’t care if she’s the queen of England.” “She didn’t mean to hurt you. It was a misunderstanding. You provoked her by maxing out my card… and by not giving that dress when you can just let her have it.” “Once,” I snapped. “One time. In two years of marriage. I never asked for anything. I never touched your money. But the moment I do, I’m a gold digger? And dress? She didn’t want it. She wanted it because it was mine just like she wanted you because you’re mine!” “She was just trying to protect me,” he repeated. “She thought you were taking advantage of me…and no! I’m not yours!” “Ah, right. You’re not mine, but you get to call me yours? That’s unfair, then.” He didn’t answer. Bianca peeked out from behind him with wide, innocent eyes, but her smirk was already forming underneath. That was it. I stepped back, breathing hard. “Let’s make it fair then because I’m done,” I said. “I’m not doing this anymore. I’m not apologizing. I want a divorce, Troy Green.” Chapter 5 “No.” Troy’s voice was firm, final. “I’m not signing anything, Thalia.” I turned to face him, my expression carefully blank. Every muscle in my body screamed to lash out, but I swallowed it all down. I’d been doing that for so long now. “I’ll make it up to you,” he added, as if his words could erase everything that had already been done. “Don’t be so dramatic. Everything’s going to be alright. Now get in the car. Bianca’s tired from the trip. She needs to go home.” I laughed—a loud, bitter sound that felt like it might rip me in half. There it was—the truth I’d known in my gut all along. I’d never get a divorce. Not from a man like him. Not unless I ran away. But my visa wasn’t here yet, so I smiled faintly. Swallowed my pride. And slipped into the backseat of the car. I would bear with it a little longer. Bianca was beside Troy in the passenger seat, talking non-stop about their trip like it was some fairytale. “We hiked the Matterhorn—it was freezing, but he carried me down the trail like a knight.” She went on, oblivious to everything else. “Then there was this sweet shop, and he bought the whole shelf because I couldn’t decide!” “Troy even booked the entire rooftop of the Ritz for dinner. Candles and everything.” I stared out the window, dead silent. Her giggles and his soft chuckles filled the space, but I didn’t respond. I couldn’t. The rest of the ride passed in quiet torment, my chest tight with rage and helplessness. That night, Bianca announced she’d cooked dinner. “I made something for everyone! Come eat with us!” she chirped, her tone sweet, as though that would make up for all the damage she’d done. I was about to refuse when Troy gave me that look—the one that said if I didn’t play nice, I’d be the problem. “Bianca apologized. She’s trying, Thalia. Don’t be immature. She’s just a kid.” A kid who split my skull open. I forced myself to sit down. My hands clenched under the table, white-knuckled as I stared at the steaming bowl of soup she’d placed before me. Bianca beamed at me. “Try it. I added a secret spice.” I hesitated, staring at the soup. Then I took a sip, trying to swallow my disgust. Something tingled at the back of my throat. Then that tingling turned to a violent burning. I dropped the spoon. My chest tightened, the air choking from my lungs. My throat swelled, panic rising like a tidal wave. Shrimp. Tiny bits of shrimp. The cruelest betrayal. I looked at Bianca through blurred vision. Her face was frozen in mock horror. “Oh my god. I didn’t know! I didn’t mean—” Liar. She always knew. Always. I glanced at Troy. His eyes hardened—not in concern, but in irritation. “Bianca, go upstairs. You don’t need to see this.” And then he walked away. Left me there. I staggered to the kitchen, my hands trembling as I fumbled through the drawers, searching for my EpiPen and allergy meds. My body was shutting down, but I fought to stay conscious. I swallowed a pill, just enough to stabilize myself. An hour later, I collapsed in bed, utterly drained, barely hanging on to life. Sleep took me swiftly, mercifully. When I woke, it was dark. Something felt… wrong. I got up slowly, my legs shaky. I made my way to my closet—and froze. The shelves were in disarray. My drawers were torn open. Boxes had been dumped out like someone had ransacked my room. And the velvet case that held my mother’s bracelet—gone My pulse spiked. My stomach twisted with dread. I ran out of the room, heading for the backyard. That’s when I saw her. Bianca. She stood by the pool in her swimsuit. Smiling. Wearing my bracelet. The last thing my mother had ever given me before she died. Something inside me snapped. I stormed over to her, grabbing her wrist with all the fury that had been building inside me for months. “That’s mine,” I growled. Bianca yanked her arm back, a defiant smirk twisting her lips. “It looks better on me,” she taunted. “You broke into my room.” “So what?” she sneered. The bracelet snapped in half during the struggle. The pieces scattered to the ground with a sickening crunch. I saw red. The rage was all-consuming. I shoved her—hard. She shrieked as she lost her balance, stumbling backward before plunging into the pool with a splash. The sound echoed through the night. Water churned violently. And then… silence. I stood there, breathing heavily, staring at the ruined pieces of my mother’s memory clutched in my hand. I didn’t regret it. Not for a second. But then I heard her. Bianca. She was flailing in the pool, her arms waving wildly as she screamed for help. Her voice was panicked, desperate. “Help! Help! I can’t swim!” I stood frozen, watching her flounder in the water. Her cries echoed, but I didn’t move. I didn’t offer her an ounce of sympathy. She wasn’t a child. Not anymore. And in that moment, I realized I didn’t care if she drowned. Chapter 6 I watched Bianca flounder in the pool, her arms thrashing wildly. She was screaming for help, but I stood there, frozen. Every inch of me wanted to leave her there, to let her drown. After everything she’d done to me, she deserved it. The lies, the manipulation, the way she’d tormented me… I had no reason to save her. But I couldn’t. Troy would never forgive me if I let her die. He’d never forgive me if I let something happen to her, no matter what she’d done. I didn’t have a choice. I couldn’t risk him turning on me, not when I was already hanging by a thread. With a deep breath, I stepped toward the pool’s edge and extended my hand. My voice was low, barely above a whisper. “Grab my hand, Bianca. I’ll help you.” She grabbed it, but the moment her fingers brushed mine, I felt a sharp yank. Without warning, she pulled me into the water, her grip tight around my wrist. I held my breath as the cold water surrounded me, my body sinking deeper. Panic surged through me. I couldn’t swim. I was going under. Bianca’s smug face appeared in front of me, her lips curling into a vicious smirk. “How dare you try to hurt me?” she spat, her eyes gleaming with malicious satisfaction. “You thought you could drown me and get away with it?” I struggled, fighting to keep my head above water, but Bianca only tightened her grip. “My brother never dared hurt me,” she sneered. “And now you think you can? You think you’re better than me?” I kicked my legs, but the weight of her words only made it harder to breathe. My chest tightened. “You’ll drown before I do,” she taunted, laughing. “I know you’re the one who doesn’t know how to swim, Thalia. You’ll drown. Just like I wanted.” She pushed me further down. The cold water engulfed me, my body sinking deeper into the darkness. I tried to get air, but there was nothing but water, swallowing me whole. I felt my strength fading. My limbs grew heavy. The world around me spun, the surface so far away. Suddenly, I heard a voice. “Troy!” It was Bianca, her voice sharp and frantic. “She tried to drown me! She pushed me in!” I heard the sound of footsteps rushing toward the pool. Troy’s voice followed, full of disbelief. “What’s going on?!” I couldn’t see him. I couldn’t even lift my head anymore. I felt myself slipping, my body too weak to keep afloat. The water in my lungs burned, but I couldn’t fight it anymore. “She tried to drown me!” Bianca screamed again, her voice full of triumph. “She pushed me in. She wanted me dead. She wanted to get rid of me!” I could hear Troy, now closer, his voice shaking with anger. “What? What are you talking about?” I heard the sound of him tending to Bianca, pulling her out of the water, wrapping her in a towel. Her voice was full of mock hurt as she demanded help. “Help me! She tried to kill me!” Bianca cried, her voice dripping with fake tears. “I’m so scared.” And me? I was still sinking, still drowning, my vision darkening. I was too far gone to scream, too far gone to reach out for help. They wouldn’t help me. They never did. The last thing I heard before I lost consciousness was the sound of Troy murmuring to Bianca, his voice soft and soothing as he tended to her. Then everything went black. When I woke up, I was in my bed. ",4,1769572245.0,BooksPoint,3,1.0,False

I work in office 10 hours 4 days a week. I leave when it’s dark and get home when it’s dark. My emotions lately are all over the place. I have a toddler and a 4 month old and I’m breast feeding both. When I get home I get overstimulated really easily when both kids are crying. My boobs are always hurting (honestly I’m so close to throwing in the towel and stopping breast feeding all together). 

My husband is very patient and I love him so much. He cleans, brings me coffee in the morning before bed, and has dinner ready 90% of the time as I’m walking into the house. 

However, tonight I was in bed and the kids were crying while my toddler was trying to pull the boob out and I just got overwhelmed and overstimulated I started yelling at my husband to come help me. 

He walks in mad and calls me a f\*cking b\*tch because I was talking to him like he’s trash because he didn’t come to the room in 30 seconds. I was literally shocked he called me that and it hurt my feelings that now I’m just crying in bed. 

I’m just so tired all the time, I know he’s tired too. But to name call me in front of our children!? I’m exhausted to fight and feel like just shutting down and leaving for a weekend with the kids and my mom. 

Maybe we need space.

2. Grilled pineapple & habanero is my next favorite. The least spicy out of everything, but has very good flavor and you can really taste the pineapple.

3. Black label reserve has a good kick and smokiness. A better and bolder flavor than green & red habanero.

4 & 5. Green & red habanero are great all rounders. Good spice, but they don’t taste that different to me and they could go with anything.

6 & 7. Marisquera black & red. I didn’t realize they are meant to go on seafood, but they still tasted fine and weren’t really spicy to me.

8. Chiltepin habanero had a sharper flavor to it. Decent spice, and wasn’t crazy about it but I will definitely try it again. 

9. Ghost pepper habanero didn’t have good flavor and just tasted like ghost pepper extract. Oddly it wasn’t as spicy as the xxxtra hot habanero even though it’s supposed to be the spiciest. 

10. Caribbean habanero tasted quite sharp and was spicy, (not to the level of the xxxtra hot habanero) but I just wasn’t a fan of the flavor profile. I think they tried to get a jerk flavor in there but it just wasn’t working.

1qp077p,https://i.redd.it/ba4xhbwnf0gg1.png,"When I Broke Up With Him, He Regretted it Endlessly","When I went back to my hometown on May Day,I encountered a landslide in the early morning.



Louis,my fiancé,forgot that my car was right in front of him.



He climbed out of the car,quickly picked up his frightened first love and their dogs,and waited for rescue in a safe area.



While they were taken to the hospital,I was still trapped in the car waiting for rescue.



On the third day,I woke up in the ICU and saw his first love’s Moments:\[If there is love in heaven,it will not let lovers be separated.\]



Everyone was waiting to see me,his fiancée,make a fool of myself.



I replied casually:\[Congratulations to the two people who have been thinking about each other for finally getting back together. Wish them all the best.\]



It’s been three days since the landslide accident,and Louis still hasn’t thought of me.



Within a minute of commenting,my phone was called by Louis immediately.



""Cathy,don't you have a conscience?Do you know what we've been through?Don't you even watch the news?""



""Is it fun for you to just be jealous every day?Michelle and I are lucky,but one of her dogs broke a bone and the other nearly died!You ignore everything and just put the blame on us.Are you crazy?""



I know that the two dogs were fed together when they were in love,and after they broke up,the two dogs all belonged to Michelle.



In Louis's eyes,my life is even worse than a dog's.



He had witnessed with his own eyes how devastating it was when the explosions went off.



""Louis,my car is right in front of you,you...""



""That's enough!You were just a little [frightened.Do](http://frightened.Do) you have to play the victim to gain sympathy?""



When the dog was whining,he hung up the phone impatiently and went to take care of it.



He was the one who didn’t watch the news!



The victims of the accident suffered either broken bones or internal injuries.



Why did he think I was just frightened?



Perhaps,he wouldn't notice that even if I were died.



On the fifth day after the accident,I had three steel nails on my scapula and stayed in the hospital for another five days before the doctor agreed to let me go.



It was raining heavily.I had just had surgery and couldn't neither lift heavy objects nor cook.When I was worrying about what to order,Louis finally called me.



""Come home when you've calmed down.I'll buy groceries and cook dinner tonight.""



The ten-day silent treatment broke our historical record.



In the past,Louis always acted superior,waiting for me to give in and break the ice.



I will be able to comfort myself in three days at most.



Because I love him so much,I am so humble that I am afraid that if I'm so pretentious,I will lose him forever.



This is the first time I ignored him for ten days and didn’t go home.



I even thought that we had ended quietly.



""Don't bother,I'll just order takeout.""



Louis was very unhappy and said impatiently,""Just wait for me at home.""



In his eyes,this is probably a great gift to me.



He is good at cooking,but he seldom takes the initiative to cook for me.If he had said he would cook for me in the past,I'll feel moved and happy.



Unfortunately,he thought of it as a great honor,but I just regarded it as our final farewell meal.



I did eat so much takeout in the hospital these few days.Louis is good at cooking,and I also don’t want to hurt my stomach.



""OK.""



After we discuss it,Louis hung up the phone immediately without saying anything more.



He cooked at least five or six [dishes.So](http://dishes.So) I simply ate some fruit for lunch and waited for him to come home and cook dinner.



But I waited until late at night and he didn't come back or even call me.



I was starving,so I ordered a takeout.



Because of the heavy rain,the takeaway took an hour to arrive.



I was eating takeout and opened my Moments out of habit.



The latest one is from Michelle.



The pictures all show that Louis taking care of the dog with a broken bone from different angles,with an incredibly gentle expression on his face.



The caption was:""It's hard to imagine how gentle he will be when we have children in the future!""



I was determined to break up.



Michelle was right.A friend in need is a friend indeed.Even God was on her side.



I didn't feel sad at all when I made this decision.



It turns out that the sky won’t fall even if I no longer love someone.



2



Lying in bed after eating and drinking,there was still no messages from Louis.



I didn't question him,but calmly clicked on the message from my agent Vivian:\[Cathy,the director asked me to confirm carefully that do you really want to give up this movie?This is a great opportunity for you to enter Hollywood.The overall shooting will last no more than two years,and you can let your fiancécome to visit during this period!\]



Since I was a child,I have dreamed of walking the red carpet on the screen,and winning an Oscar is my lifelong wish.



But Louis doesn't like me to show up in public.For this reason,many good roles were rejected by me,and over time,I finally faded out of the screen.



""Cathy,this is a precious opportunity!If you miss it,you may never be able to go to Hollywood in your life!""



""Although the heroine is disfigured,the whole play reflects her spirit,not her appearance!The director has already let someone make a scarred face that looks [realistic.It](http://realistic.It) can be said that he has put a lot of effort into it for you!""



Vivian tried to persuade me earnestly,and almost tied me up and took me in front of the director.



In the mirror,the scar on my face is particularly ugly.



""Okay,I'll take this movie.""



Vivian jumped up excitedly,""My dear Cathy,you are finally willing to make a comeback.I will send you the script right now!""



After fading from the screen in the past two years,I just took small commercials at most and basically gave up filming completely.Vivian was so upset about this that she even wanted to kill Louis.



Louis didn’t understand that in order to love him,I gave up my dreams,was willing to be his good wife,and regarded him as my whole world.



What he gave me in return was abandoning me in the midst of life and death.



Now,I should regroup and work hard to realize my dream.This is the world that I should pursue.



He broke his promise again today,so I just assumed we had broken up.



As soon as I woke up,I started to read the script.



It is worthy of being a Hollywood script.I was so absorbed in reading it that I forgot to eat and sleep,and was so addicted to the role of the heroine that I couldn't extricate myself.



So I didn't even notice when Louis came home and appeared behind me.



“Cathy!”



His sudden voice startled me.



""When did you come back?""



Thinking of the scar on my face,I became a little panicked.I tried my best to cover it up and didn't dare to look back at him.



""Are you planning to take on another role?No wonder you ignored my calls on purpose!""



Every time when I read the script,Louis's tone was unconsciously filled with anger.



In order to coax him,I humbly told him that I was just looking at it to satisfy my profession.



Besides,I never ignored his calls on purpose.



He always comes and goes at my beck and call,and answering my phone depends on his mood.



""Yeah,I'm busy as soon as I get up,so how can I have time to look at my phone?""



Every time he leaves me alone,doesn't answer my calls or reply to my messages on purpose,he uses this sentence to shut me up.



I put down my hands,took out my phone that was charging under the script and turned it on in front of him.



""See?I didn't mean to ignore it.It's just that the battery is out.""



When I showed him my phone,I inadvertently revealed the bright red scar on my face.



""Why did you put on makeup like this?It's so scary!""



I laughed at myself,thinking he could see it!



""It's not makeup.I haven't got the technology yet.""



Hearing the mockery in my tone,Louis moved closer to see it more clearly.



""Cathy,what's wrong with your face...""



""Didn't I tell you that my car is in front of you?""



Louis's face suddenly changed,and he tried to touch my scar with his hands,but I moved away.



""Michelle and I thought you were at the back.We were the last car to fall.I thought you were okay...""



When he said the latter part,he was a little afraid to look at me.



He probably had no idea why I overtook him.



After all,he was busy chatting with Michelle,and with their heads next to each other closely,it was impossible for him to notice that I had overtaken him.



""I was already at the supermarket entrance yesterday,but the two dogs were traumatized by the accident and became severely stressed even at the slightest noise.Michelle couldn't handle it alone,so I broke my [promise.You](http://promise.You) know that Michelle treats those two dogs as her own babies...""



I lifted my eyelids lightly,and Louis couldn't continue.



Don't mention that I can't compare to his first love,but even their two [dogs.How](http://dogs.How) ridiculous is that?



He touched his nose guiltily,knowing that it was inappropriate to compare me to dogs.



""No need to explain,I know you are their father.""



I have always loved beauty and would never allow myself to have [scars.Now](http://scars.Now) half of my face is disfigured,but I am so calm.



The contrast in my attitude made Louis open his mouth slightly,and after a while he said,""Medical technology is very advanced now.I will ask someone to buy you some good scar removal cream.Then you can get some cosmetic surgery and it should be back to normal.""



""Don't worry about it.I know what's going on.""



Louis looked me over carefully,and after confirming that only my face was injured,he breathed a sigh of relief:



""Cathy,why don't you know what's good for you?You should be thankful that you were only [disfigured.So](http://disfigured.So) many people died in this accident,and many more are lying in the ICU with broken bones.I was just helping Michelle take care of dogs,and you're picking on me again,aren't you?""



""I appreciate your kindness.I know that you and Michelle are [innocent.You](http://innocent.You) are just the father of the two dogs,and Michelle is the mother.""



""I understand that your relationship is limited to this,and we won't argue about that again.""



After I finished speaking,his phone rang again.



The special ringtone is exclusive to Michelle.



I made a gesture of""go""to him:\[It must be the dogs calling you,go for it!\]



This was the first time I took the initiative to let him go towards Michelle.Louis answered the phone with great displeasure and slammed the door and left.



The aftershock of the door made my scapula ache faintly.

In the evening,Louis asked me to go out for dinner.



It’s really need to go to the breakup dinner.



As soon as I arrived at the private room,I heard the dog barking.I couldn't help but frown.Did he bring Michelle's dog with him?



It doesn’t matter.Let’s have the farewell dinner and part ways in peace.



As soon as I opened the door,a dog rushed towards me and barked at me.



Seeing the dog was about to bite my leg,I was so scared that I quickly stepped back and accidentally bumped into the waiter who was serving coffee from behind.



Suddenly,there was a sharp pain in my scapula.



My face turned pale instantly,and I also had to avoid the barking dog.



Losing my patience,I picked up the cup and threw it at the dog.



Michelle suddenly screamed,""Cathy,what are you doing!""



Sure enough,the dog became even more nervous and bit into my trouser leg.



Fortunately,I was wearing long pants today and the dog was a small one,but how could it not hurt when its teeth piercing through my jeans?



When the waiter was about to help me beat the dog,Louis finally came over,hugged the dog in his arms,and to comfort it,""Don't be afraid,Daddy is here!""



At that moment,my heart was broken.



""Come in,why are you standing at the door?Chicky won't bite anyone.""



Louis was probably blind,he saw everything clearly,but he still wanted to protect the dog..



My shoulder was hurting so much that I went into the private room and sat down with a pale face.



""There's no others here,Cathy,you don't have to cover yourself up so tightly.It's all because of your outfit that Chicky was scared and didn't recognize you.""



Michelle just said a few words and blamed the dog bite all by me.



The dog seemed to understand her words and whimpered uneasily in Louis's arms.



Louis extremely dissatisfied with my appearance.""Just take them off.Didn't you see Chicky is scared again?""



My heartache flashed away,and I revealed my face without any sadness or joy.



He knew very well why I dressed up like this.



After the pain in my shoulder eased,I tentatively raised my hands to take off my mask and hat.



Seeing the strange movement of my arm,Louis was puzzled.



""Cathy,why are you being so shy?""



I ignored him.



He didn't feel sorry for my disfigurement,so how could he care about the three nails on my scapula?



To speak it out would only bring shame upon oneself.



When Michelle saw my face clearly,she covered her mouth.



""Cathy,you are really disfigured!""



Through her fingers,I saw the corners of her mouth turned up.



It was really a smug smile.



""I'm sorry,it's all because of these two dogs were hurt.Otherwise,Louis would definitely think of you first.""



As she spoke,tears welled up in her eyes.



Although it was tears of excitement,Louis thought she was feeling sad about my misfortune.



He held Chicky in one hand and took a tissue with the other hand to wipe Michelle's tears:



""It's not your or the dogs'fault.Cathy overtook the car and ran ahead without saying a word.She's lucky to be alive.""



Michelle cried even harder.""Cathy is an [actress.How](http://actress.How) can she compare with us?If she is disfigured,won't that mean she will ruin the rest of her life?""



She just wanted me to know that I was not worthy of competing with her for Louis because of my disfigurement.



Louis felt so distressed that he wanted to hug Michelle and comfort her,but because I was there,he did not cross the line.



Michelle cried for a while,but when she saw that I didn't even look at her,she stopped crying and looked at me with sympathy.



""Cathy,your face is injured like this,it must be very painful and hard to accept,right?""



Looking at her pitiful face,those who didn't know would think that it was she that had met with misfortune.



I really wanted to throw a cup of hot coffee on her face like I always did.



It would be best if her face was also burned and disfigured,so she would know how painful it is.



If she and Louis hadn't been so brazen in front of me,I certainly wouldn't have thought of overtaking to avoid seeing the two of them.



After the ground collapsed,I called Louis for help for many times.



However,he was only concerned rescuing Michelle and the two dogs from the passenger seat.



For a moment,I saw Louis stop and look at me.



However,his attention was drawn to the dogs'shrill barking.



I saw everything with my own eyes that he hugged Michelle,and they each held a dog and quickly ran to a safe area to wait for rescue.



Explosions were going on everywhere,but he never thought of calling me.



When I thought I was going to die,the rescue team saved me in time.



Just after I was rescued,the place where my car was located collapsed again due to the explosion,and the car was crushed into a block of iron.



""How could it not hurt?Fortunately,I was rescued in time,otherwise I would have died on the spot.""



I pointed at the car being salvaged in the news and sighed how lucky I was.



Following my hand,Louis saw clearly the license plate of the car on TV.



It's my license plate.



The car was as flat as it could be.



If I were in there,I wouldn't be here now.



He finally stopped touching the dog,and he stammered and apologized to me,



""Cathy,I'm sorry,I faintly heard you calling for help,I thought it was an illusion...""



4



He handed Chicky to Michelle,and changed his seat to sit next to me,but Michelle sat there first.



She squeezed in between us,as before.



""Cathy,I have a friend who specializes in medical aesthetics.If you get timely treatment,you will definitely be able to recover as before!""



As she spoke,she held the dog in her arms,waved its legs,and bowed to me to apologize,



""Cathy,I'm so sorry!Don't be [discouraged.You](http://discouraged.You) are naturally beautiful.Even if you can't fully recover,it won't affect your temperament.I believe Louis is not a superficial person.""



She's so good at sarcastic.



Didn’t she see that Louis went around me in a circle just to avoid the disfigured left side of my face?



As she said that,she asked Louis to pour me a glass of drinks.



""Cheers to celebrate our survival!""



I didn't hold the glass.



Louis advised me gently,""You can drink without worry since I'm here today.""



""The doctor said I can't drink during the recovery period.""



So he didn't bother to care about me and clinked glasses with Michelle to celebrate.



Those who truly survived the disaster were completely forgotten by them.



When the exquisite dishes were placed on the table,Michelle stroked the dogs'head and said happily:



""Chicky,Judy,you really need to thank [Dad.You](http://Dad.You) can enjoy these bones today!""



I watched them divide the food into two plates,and each of them picked up a dog and started feeding it.



They looked just like a couple feeding their twin children together.



The family of four is warm and harmonious.



I was sitting at the dining table,but it seemed redundant.



Chicky was gnawing on a bone and even grinned at me with a smug smile.



This smile is exactly the same as Michelle's.



They were so focused on feeding the dog that they didn't notice that the dog was laughing at me.



Seeing me sitting there without eating,Louis showed impatience on his face.



""Cathy,why don't you eat?These are specially ordered for you by Louis.He said you like to eat meat.""



""Are you still angry that we abandoned you?The situation was critical at the time.Chicky was pregnant and Judy had a broken bone.We really didn't mean to forget about you.""



After finished speaking,she showed me the injured leg of Judy.



Judy also understood human nature very well.He even acted coquettishly towards Louis with tearful eyes.



Now,Louis looked at me with more dissatisfaction.""Michelle has already helped you contact with her [friends.You](http://friends.You) just need a few times of cosmetic procedure.I can pay for it.Why are you still being so arrogant?""



I touched the scar,feeling confused.Could it be that I was disfigured,so that when I had no expression on my face,it looks like I was arrogant?



I stood up with my bag.""Thank you for your treat.But as an actor,I can't eat too much meat""



Louis looked embarrassed.""I'm sorry,I'll order you something else.""



""No,thank you,I've already ordered takeout.""



Now,Louis's face was full of angry.



""I seldom have the patience to explain things to others,but I have already explained this to you several times.I admit that today's meal was my negligence.Don't be so pretentious any more!""



""Right,Cathy,both of Chicky and Judy know that they are wrong and they don't even dare to eat any more.Please forgive us.""



""You did nothing wrong,so why should I forgive you?""



After that,I took off the wedding ring and handed it to Louis.""I'll consider that I've already had this farewell dinner.I wish you happiness.""

1qp067x,https://i.redd.it/k9jvpbqff0gg1.png,"When I Broke Up With Him, He Regretted it Endlessly","When I went back to my hometown on May Day,I encountered a landslide in the early morning.



Louis,my fiancé,forgot that my car was right in front of him.



He climbed out of the car,quickly picked up his frightened first love and their dogs,and waited for rescue in a safe area.



While they were taken to the hospital,I was still trapped in the car waiting for rescue.



On the third day,I woke up in the ICU and saw his first love’s Moments:\[If there is love in heaven,it will not let lovers be separated.\]



Everyone was waiting to see me,his fiancée,make a fool of myself.



I replied casually:\[Congratulations to the two people who have been thinking about each other for finally getting back together. Wish them all the best.\]



It’s been three days since the landslide accident,and Louis still hasn’t thought of me.



Within a minute of commenting,my phone was called by Louis immediately.



""Cathy,don't you have a conscience?Do you know what we've been through?Don't you even watch the news?""



""Is it fun for you to just be jealous every day?Michelle and I are lucky,but one of her dogs broke a bone and the other nearly died!You ignore everything and just put the blame on us.Are you crazy?""



I know that the two dogs were fed together when they were in love,and after they broke up,the two dogs all belonged to Michelle.



In Louis's eyes,my life is even worse than a dog's.



He had witnessed with his own eyes how devastating it was when the explosions went off.



""Louis,my car is right in front of you,you...""



""That's enough!You were just a little [frightened.Do](http://frightened.Do) you have to play the victim to gain sympathy?""



When the dog was whining,he hung up the phone impatiently and went to take care of it.



He was the one who didn’t watch the news!



The victims of the accident suffered either broken bones or internal injuries.



Why did he think I was just frightened?



Perhaps,he wouldn't notice that even if I were died.



On the fifth day after the accident,I had three steel nails on my scapula and stayed in the hospital for another five days before the doctor agreed to let me go.



It was raining heavily.I had just had surgery and couldn't neither lift heavy objects nor cook.When I was worrying about what to order,Louis finally called me.



""Come home when you've calmed down.I'll buy groceries and cook dinner tonight.""



The ten-day silent treatment broke our historical record.



In the past,Louis always acted superior,waiting for me to give in and break the ice.



I will be able to comfort myself in three days at most.



Because I love him so much,I am so humble that I am afraid that if I'm so pretentious,I will lose him forever.



This is the first time I ignored him for ten days and didn’t go home.



I even thought that we had ended quietly.



""Don't bother,I'll just order takeout.""



Louis was very unhappy and said impatiently,""Just wait for me at home.""



In his eyes,this is probably a great gift to me.



He is good at cooking,but he seldom takes the initiative to cook for me.If he had said he would cook for me in the past,I'll feel moved and happy.



Unfortunately,he thought of it as a great honor,but I just regarded it as our final farewell meal.



I did eat so much takeout in the hospital these few days.Louis is good at cooking,and I also don’t want to hurt my stomach.



""OK.""



After we discuss it,Louis hung up the phone immediately without saying anything more.



He cooked at least five or six [dishes.So](http://dishes.So) I simply ate some fruit for lunch and waited for him to come home and cook dinner.



But I waited until late at night and he didn't come back or even call me.



I was starving,so I ordered a takeout.



Because of the heavy rain,the takeaway took an hour to arrive.



I was eating takeout and opened my Moments out of habit.



The latest one is from Michelle.



The pictures all show that Louis taking care of the dog with a broken bone from different angles,with an incredibly gentle expression on his face.



The caption was:""It's hard to imagine how gentle he will be when we have children in the future!""



I was determined to break up.



Michelle was right.A friend in need is a friend indeed.Even God was on her side.



I didn't feel sad at all when I made this decision.



It turns out that the sky won’t fall even if I no longer love someone.



2



Lying in bed after eating and drinking,there was still no messages from Louis.



I didn't question him,but calmly clicked on the message from my agent Vivian:\[Cathy,the director asked me to confirm carefully that do you really want to give up this movie?This is a great opportunity for you to enter Hollywood.The overall shooting will last no more than two years,and you can let your fiancécome to visit during this period!\]



Since I was a child,I have dreamed of walking the red carpet on the screen,and winning an Oscar is my lifelong wish.



But Louis doesn't like me to show up in public.For this reason,many good roles were rejected by me,and over time,I finally faded out of the screen.



""Cathy,this is a precious opportunity!If you miss it,you may never be able to go to Hollywood in your life!""



""Although the heroine is disfigured,the whole play reflects her spirit,not her appearance!The director has already let someone make a scarred face that looks [realistic.It](http://realistic.It) can be said that he has put a lot of effort into it for you!""



Vivian tried to persuade me earnestly,and almost tied me up and took me in front of the director.



In the mirror,the scar on my face is particularly ugly.



""Okay,I'll take this movie.""



Vivian jumped up excitedly,""My dear Cathy,you are finally willing to make a comeback.I will send you the script right now!""



After fading from the screen in the past two years,I just took small commercials at most and basically gave up filming completely.Vivian was so upset about this that she even wanted to kill Louis.



Louis didn’t understand that in order to love him,I gave up my dreams,was willing to be his good wife,and regarded him as my whole world.



What he gave me in return was abandoning me in the midst of life and death.



Now,I should regroup and work hard to realize my dream.This is the world that I should pursue.



He broke his promise again today,so I just assumed we had broken up.



As soon as I woke up,I started to read the script.



It is worthy of being a Hollywood script.I was so absorbed in reading it that I forgot to eat and sleep,and was so addicted to the role of the heroine that I couldn't extricate myself.



So I didn't even notice when Louis came home and appeared behind me.



“Cathy!”



His sudden voice startled me.



""When did you come back?""



Thinking of the scar on my face,I became a little panicked.I tried my best to cover it up and didn't dare to look back at him.



""Are you planning to take on another role?No wonder you ignored my calls on purpose!""



Every time when I read the script,Louis's tone was unconsciously filled with anger.



In order to coax him,I humbly told him that I was just looking at it to satisfy my profession.



Besides,I never ignored his calls on purpose.



He always comes and goes at my beck and call,and answering my phone depends on his mood.



""Yeah,I'm busy as soon as I get up,so how can I have time to look at my phone?""



Every time he leaves me alone,doesn't answer my calls or reply to my messages on purpose,he uses this sentence to shut me up.



I put down my hands,took out my phone that was charging under the script and turned it on in front of him.



""See?I didn't mean to ignore it.It's just that the battery is out.""



When I showed him my phone,I inadvertently revealed the bright red scar on my face.



""Why did you put on makeup like this?It's so scary!""



I laughed at myself,thinking he could see it!



""It's not makeup.I haven't got the technology yet.""



Hearing the mockery in my tone,Louis moved closer to see it more clearly.



""Cathy,what's wrong with your face...""



""Didn't I tell you that my car is in front of you?""



Louis's face suddenly changed,and he tried to touch my scar with his hands,but I moved away.



""Michelle and I thought you were at the back.We were the last car to fall.I thought you were okay...""



When he said the latter part,he was a little afraid to look at me.



He probably had no idea why I overtook him.



After all,he was busy chatting with Michelle,and with their heads next to each other closely,it was impossible for him to notice that I had overtaken him.



""I was already at the supermarket entrance yesterday,but the two dogs were traumatized by the accident and became severely stressed even at the slightest noise.Michelle couldn't handle it alone,so I broke my [promise.You](http://promise.You) know that Michelle treats those two dogs as her own babies...""



I lifted my eyelids lightly,and Louis couldn't continue.



Don't mention that I can't compare to his first love,but even their two [dogs.How](http://dogs.How) ridiculous is that?



He touched his nose guiltily,knowing that it was inappropriate to compare me to dogs.



""No need to explain,I know you are their father.""



I have always loved beauty and would never allow myself to have [scars.Now](http://scars.Now) half of my face is disfigured,but I am so calm.



The contrast in my attitude made Louis open his mouth slightly,and after a while he said,""Medical technology is very advanced now.I will ask someone to buy you some good scar removal cream.Then you can get some cosmetic surgery and it should be back to normal.""



""Don't worry about it.I know what's going on.""



Louis looked me over carefully,and after confirming that only my face was injured,he breathed a sigh of relief:



""Cathy,why don't you know what's good for you?You should be thankful that you were only [disfigured.So](http://disfigured.So) many people died in this accident,and many more are lying in the ICU with broken bones.I was just helping Michelle take care of dogs,and you're picking on me again,aren't you?""



""I appreciate your kindness.I know that you and Michelle are [innocent.You](http://innocent.You) are just the father of the two dogs,and Michelle is the mother.""



""I understand that your relationship is limited to this,and we won't argue about that again.""



After I finished speaking,his phone rang again.



The special ringtone is exclusive to Michelle.



I made a gesture of""go""to him:\[It must be the dogs calling you,go for it!\]



This was the first time I took the initiative to let him go towards Michelle.Louis answered the phone with great displeasure and slammed the door and left.



The aftershock of the door made my scapula ache faintly.

""Cathy,why don't you eat?These are specially ordered for you by Louis.He said you like to eat meat.""



""Are you still angry that we abandoned you?The situation was critical at the time.Chicky was pregnant and Judy had a broken bone.We really didn't mean to forget about you.""



After finished speaking,she showed me the injured leg of Judy.



Judy also understood human nature very well.He even acted coquettishly towards Louis with tearful eyes.



Now,Louis looked at me with more dissatisfaction.""Michelle has already helped you contact with her [friends.You](http://friends.You) just need a few times of cosmetic procedure.I can pay for it.Why are you still being so arrogant?""



I touched the scar,feeling confused.Could it be that I was disfigured,so that when I had no expression on my face,it looks like I was arrogant?



I stood up with my bag.""Thank you for your treat.But as an actor,I can't eat too much meat""



Louis looked embarrassed.""I'm sorry,I'll order you something else.""



""No,thank you,I've already ordered takeout.""



Now,Louis's face was full of angry.



""I seldom have the patience to explain things to others,but I have already explained this to you several times.I admit that today's meal was my negligence.Don't be so pretentious any more!""



""Right,Cathy,both of Chicky and Judy know that they are wrong and they don't even dare to eat any more.Please forgive us.""



""You did nothing wrong,so why should I forgive you?""



After that,I took off the wedding ring and handed it to Louis.""I'll consider that I've already had this farewell dinner.I wish you happiness.""

1qp03w8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qp03w8,Help identifying these solid wood coffee tables — MCMi? maker? era?,"Hey

I’m hoping someone here can help me identify these coffee tables. I’ve been digging and hitting a wall.

I have two matching solid wood coffee tables with a very architectural, blocky design. Square tops, thick plinth bases, and a recessed open section underneath. They’re heavy and well-built — not veneer-over-particleboard.

Details:

	•	Solid wood construction (appears to be oak or similar hardwood)

	•	Square tops with thick edges

	•	Plinth-style base with recessed center

	•	Open shelf / negative space underneath

	•	Underside shows solid framing, dowels/screws, no manufacturer stamp or label

	•	Finish looks original (not modern repro)

	•	Design feels late 1970s–1990s: postmodern / brutalist / minimalist vibe

I originally thought:

	•	Scandinavian

	•	Lane / Drexel / Ethan Allen

	•	Or possibly custom or small-batch production

…but I haven’t found an exact match yet.

I’ve attached multiple photos, including underside construction and different angles.

If anyone recognizes the maker, era, style, or even just the design movement, I’d really appreciate it. Even close comparables would help.

Thanks in advance — this sub always comes through 🙏",1,1769570958.0,Mid_Century,0,1.0,False

1qp02qz,https://i.redd.it/s3uhd1kne0gg1.png,Surprising my Boyfriend with My Wedding Without Him,"“Mom, about what Dad said years ago… I’ve decided to go through with it. Tell him to arrange the marriage.”



I ended the call, and the music flooded back in. Audrey’s birthday party was still in full swing.



Audrey—the girl I once saved from bullies, who I thought was my best friend.



Jared, my boyfriend, and Jackson, my closest childhood friend, changed the moment Audrey entered our lives. Suddenly, she was their everything. They laughed with her, cared for her… and eventually, they told me they loved her. Right to my face.



Then came the dinner. Just the three of us. A final attempt to fix things—so I thought. But when Audrey called, crying about being robbed, they left me. Again.



It was raining. I wandered the streets, soaked and alone, until I was hit by a car. They never even bothered checking on me.



So I packed my bags. Booked a flight. Met my groom.



Then I sent Jared and Jackson one last message: My Wedding Invitation.



\--



“About what father said years ago…” I paused, my voice barely rising above the music thumping through the villa walls. “I’m now agreeing to get married. Please tell him to arrange all the prep work. No need for romance—make it just formal.”



There was a moment of stunned silence on the other end before my mother’s familiar voice broke through. “Are you sure about this? What about your boyfriend, Jared? Did you finally break up with him?”



“Not yet,” I replied, firm but tired. “Don’t tell anyone about this yet.” I swallowed the ache in my throat. “I’ll send the other list for the agreement and return home as soon as possible.”



Then I hung up. The phone slid from my hand and dropped onto the soft mattress beside me. That’s when the noise outside clawed its way back into my senses.



It was Audrey’s birthday. The adopted daughter of my parents. The girl I once thought of as my little sister. The same girl I’d defended from bullies back in high school, when the four of us—me, Audrey, and my childhood friends Jared and Jackson—were supposed to be a family.



Back then, I thought I was doing the right thing. That helping her would bring us closer. That we could all live in one house and laugh over dinner. I never imagined she’d twist everything.



Audrey was clever like that. She’d wormed her way into everything. She used to tag along with us—me, Jared, and Jackson. I didn’t mind. At first. But then it was like she started trying to replace me. Whispering things to Jared when I wasn’t looking. Making Jackson laugh in a way that used to be just mine. Still, I told myself not to overthink it.



But then I saw it. The kiss. It was supposed to be a quiet night. Just me and Jared who eventually became my boyfriend as we both confessed our love. Then, I caught him and Audrey kissing.



I let it go—for a while. But it happened again. And again.



Every time I asked, Jared brushed it off. “You’re just jealous,” he’d say. “She’s like a sister.”



Jackson said the same. “Don’t ruin everything because you’re being insecure, Maureen.”



But it wasn’t insecurity. It was betrayal.



And now, here I was—alone at her birthday party. Watching the three of them giggle and clink glasses like they were the main characters in some twisted romantic comedy. Jared had just taken a shot—and with a laugh, he pressed the empty glass to Audrey’s lips, his free hand grazing her body as if they were already lovers.



I couldn’t breathe. I got up and quietly slipped back into one of the guest rooms upstairs. But just as I was pulling the blanket over my head, the door creaked open.



“Maureen?” Audrey’s voice was laced with fake concern. “They’re looking for you downstairs. We’re about to do the fireworks.”



I stayed still. “I’m tired and sleepy. Just go.”



“Come on…” She stepped closer. “It’s my birthday. Are you really going to be like this?”



I turned to face her, my voice low. “Audrey, isn’t it enough that I was forced to be here?”



She frowned. “Do you really hate me now? Is it because you think I stole them from you? That was never my intention. Please… we used to be best friends—”



“Stop.” I held up my hand. “Just go enjoy your party.”



But she wouldn’t. She grabbed my wrist, tugging. “Let’s go. It’ll be fun. I’m happy when you’re with me—”



“Don’t touch me!” I tried to yank away, but her grip tightened.



In the struggle, we lost balance. We both fell backward—Audrey crashing into the small table beside the bed. The vase on top tipped and shattered, the shards slicing into our arms and shoulders.



Pain bloomed down my forearm, but before I could react, the door flew open.



My boyfriend Jared. He didn’t rush to me. No. He ran to her.



“Are you okay? Audrey—what happened?!” he asked, checking her wounds, brushing the glass from her skin.



“She pushed me,” Audrey whimpered. “I didn’t mean to—she just—”



“What the heck, Maureen?!” Jared turned to me with a snarl. “You’re ruining everything. Again.”



I stared at him, speechless. Blood dripping from my hand.



“She attacked me,” I said, shaking. “She pulled me. I told her to stop—”



But he wasn’t listening. Neither was Jackson, who had now joined them. “You’re always like this,” he snapped. “Jealous. Dramatic. Can’t stand not being the center of attention.”



Then I was told to apologize. Even with blood soaking through my sleeves, I was the one ruining her birthday.



Jackson grabbed me by the arm. “Come on. You’re coming downstairs. We’re celebrating. You’re not going to embarrass the family again.”



So I went. Bruised, bleeding, humiliated—I stood beneath the fireworks, watching them laugh and dance.



Just one last time, I thought. One last time, I’ll try. I joined the circle by the bonfire, fake smile painted on like war paint.



The music swelled. People cheered. I was swaying, barely holding it together when I felt the shove. Jared pushed me? How… why?



I stumbled straight into the bonfire’s edge. Pain exploded up my arm as flames kissed my skin.



I screamed.



Someone screamed with me—Audrey. She rushed to my side, panicked. “Oh, god! Maureen is hurt! We need to call an ambulance—she’s hurt—”



But Jared stepped in, shaking his head. “It’s nothing. Just a small burn. She’ll get by. It’s her punishment for hurting you a while ago.""



And Jackson? He didn’t even look at me.



No one helped.



I dragged myself away from the fire. Then I hailed a cab.



No one offered to take me to the hospital. No one cared that I was bleeding.



But that was fine… because this is the last time they’re going to hurt me again.



Chapter 2



“It’s a good thing you came in right away,” the nurse said as she gently cleaned the raw skin of my arm. “This is a second-degree burn, and you needed stitches too.”



I didn’t respond. Just nodded. The white ceiling above me blurred. I stayed at the hospital for two more days.



Not a call. Not a single message. No “Are you okay?” No “Sorry for what happened.”



Nothing. They didn’t even care enough to pretend.



On the second evening, I found myself aimlessly scrolling through my phone. Maybe some part of me still hoped they’d reached out. But all I found were photos.



Bright, glowing snapshots of Audrey in her brand-new red dress, smiling between Jared and Jackson. Champagne glasses raised. That same smirk on her lips that she always wore when she knew she had won.



“Thank you Jared and Jackson for the best birthday ever! I’ll treasure this forever! Look at our new friendship bracelets!!!”



I zoomed in. Three matching bracelets. And then Jared and Jackson no longer wore our friendship bracelets like before.



I turned off the screen and placed the phone face down on the side table. Just silence again. My heart pounded in that silence. But it didn’t hurt anymore. It was just… empty.



Two days later, I was back at the apartment. The same place we’d all moved into after college. It was supposed to be a home for a family, only that they had betrayed me.



I stepped inside the quiet living room and headed straight to my bedroom. I opened the closet and began to pack.



I reached for my shoes and then paused. There it was—the memory box. That dumb, stupid box I had once called my ""treasure chest.""



I sat on the floor, dragging it out, letting the dust coat my fingers. Inside were letters. Crumpled, faded ones written by Jared and Jackson from when we were kids. Stick drawings, silly poems, “get well soon” cards when I had the flu.



And a photo. The three of us—me, Jared, and Jackson—kneeling by a treehouse, dirt on our clothes, wide grins across our faces.



I remembered that day. It was the summer I got bit by a dog. Or almost did. I was always terrified of dogs, and the neighbor’s dog had gotten loose. I froze, too scared to move. Jared and Jackson had jumped in front of me like it was instinct. Jared even got a bite on his arm just to protect me.



After that, everything changed. They became my shadows. My protectors. And somewhere along the way, I had fallen in love with Jared, while Jackson treated me like a sister.



Until Audrey ruined everything.



I sat on the floor, gripping a friendship bracelet with my name on it. I was such a fool.



My parents had warned me when I begged them to adopt Audrey. “Are you sure about this, Maureen? Not everyone wants a sister the way you do. And what if she hurts you? You can’t just trust anyone that easy.”



I hadn’t listened. I believed love would be enough.



But now?



Now I knew.



She didn’t want to be my sister. She wanted to be me.



I packed up the rest of my things. Then, I carried the memory box outside. I set the box down and lit the match in the backyard.



The flames caught quickly. The letters curled, blackening. The bracelets twisted in the heat, their gold sheen turning dull and dead. The photos dissolved into ash.



“Maureen!”



I turned at the sound of Jared’s voice. He came running from inside, panic written all over his face.



“What are you doing?!” he shouted. “Are those… are those our albums?! The bracelets?!”



“Yes,” I said simply. “I’m burning all our memories.”



He tried to move closer, but I stepped in front of the fire, blocking him. “It’s over. All of it.”



Jackson arrived seconds later, looking just as stunned.



“Is this some kind of tantrum?” he asked, arms crossed. “You’re upset, we get it. But this is dramatic, even for you.”



“This isn’t a tantrum,” I said, my voice calm, steady. “This is the end.”



“You’re really going to let one bad night ruin years of friendship?” Jared asked. “Maureen, don’t do this. We can talk—”



I met their gaze before turning to Jared. “I don't want to ever be with the both of you again.""



I turned away and walked back inside the apartment, the smoke still curling behind me.



Chapter 3



I thought they’d leave me alone after I burned everything. But they didn’t.



Days passed, and slowly, Jared started acting like nothing had happened. He began sending flowers again. He texted like a sweet boyfriend, asked about my day, and even tried to kiss me once when we crossed paths outside the building. It was as if nothing had ever gone wrong.



Jackson followed suit, playing the big brother again—bringing coffee, joking about old times. Every time they said, “Sorry about what happened, let’s fix things,” it sounded more like they were apologizing for a stubbed toe than years of neglect and betrayal.



Then they surprised me with dinner.



“Our treat,” Jared said. “At our old spot.”



Part of me wanted to delete the message and never look back. But another part of me—the tired, devastated part—wondered if maybe, just maybe, we could end this all without bitterness. Without hating each other.



So I went. The restaurant hadn’t changed. Dim lighting, warm wooden booths, soft jazz playing overhead. It smelled like rosemary and nostalgia. I sat down, watching them laugh, trying to recapture something that had long since died. For a few moments, it almost felt okay.



Then Jared’s phone rang.



He glanced at it and froze. “It’s Audrey.”



He answered, frowning. “What? Slow down… You were robbed? What? Stabbed?! Where are you—”



In seconds, both he and Jackson were on their feet.



“She’s crying,” Jared explained breathlessly. “She was attacked. We’ve got to go.”



They didn’t say goodbye. They didn’t even look at me again.



They just ran. Ran like their world depended on her.



I sat there in silence, staring at the half-eaten food. The candle on the table flickered until it burned out completely.



I paid the bill myself.



When I stepped outside, the sky had opened up. Thunder cracked across the heavens as rain poured relentlessly. The streets were nearly empty—no taxis, no buses. The restaurant manager offered me an umbrella, but they were already closed. I couldn’t stay.



So I walked. Each step was heavy. My bandaged arms ached. My body screamed for rest. But the worst part?



The thunder. It echoed in my chest, triggering a deep fear I’d carried since childhood. I always froze during storms. The lightning, the cracks—it made me feel like the world was about to split in two.



I wrapped my coat tighter and kept going, the city turning into a blur of light and shadows.



Then—a sharp light. A horn.



A car.



I didn’t even have time to move.



Then: darkness.



When I woke up, everything felt… soft. Too soft. I was in a room I didn’t recognize. Clean, white walls. Dim lighting. My body hurt, but it was dull, distant. I blinked hard, turning toward the sound of someone shifting nearby.



“Jared…?” I whispered.



But it wasn’t him.



A man sat in the corner, tall, dressed in black, his eyes unreadable. He didn’t move until I tried to sit up.



“You’re awake,” he said. His voice was deep, steady. “Don’t move too much.”



“Who… are you?”



“Roscoe,” he said. “I found you after the accident. Took you to the hospital. You were unconscious.”



I wanted to ask more. But everything spun—and I blacked out again.



When I opened my eyes again, Roscoe was gone.



No note. No contact. Just… gone. There were no missed calls. No messages. No check-ins.



Except for my mother.



Mom: Call me when you’re on your way here now. Everything’s ready now. Come home.



I didn’t tell her what happened. I didn’t want her to worry.



The nurse told me I’d been lucky. The car had hit me from the side, but nothing was broken—still, I needed a few more days to heal.



So I stayed. Alone.



Until discharge.



Back at the apartment, I stepped inside just to grab the last of my things before I booked my flight home.



That’s when Jared appeared at the door.



“Oh, good. You’re back.” He smiled like nothing had happened. “So, listen… we had to sell your car. And some of your things too. Audrey needed emergency funds, and—”



“What?” I asked, stunned. “You sold my things?”



“Relax,” Jackson said, walking in. “We’ll pay you back. But Audrey’s been through a lot after the robbery. She needs someone to take care of her—can you cook for her? She’s not eating well.”



I blinked, stunned. “Are you serious?”



Jackson’s brows furrowed. “Where’ve you been anyway? Audrey said you went to some party after the dinner. Don’t you think that’s not a good behavior when Audrey was in danger? You shouldn’t have been here with us! I think you’re being selfish.”



I felt like I’d been punched. I laughed. It came out hollow, broken. “Right. A party.”



Then I threw the hospital discharge file straight at them.



“There. That’s where I was. The hospital. You left me in the rain. I walked home through a thunderstorm. I got hit by a car.”



“What…?” Jared asked, staring. “You were in the hospital?”



“I thought you were with friends…” Jackson mumbled, confused. “Audrey said—”



“Of course she did,” I snapped. “It’s always Audrey, isn’t it?”



Before they could say more, a high-pitched scream came from the hallway.



“Help! Jared, Jackson—it hurts! Please!”



Audrey. Of course.



Always Audrey.



I didn’t wait to hear their response. I turned, stepped over the threshold, and walked away.



Chapter 4



My entire body still ached. So instead of leaving as planned, I stayed in my room, letting the dull pain anchor me to the bed.



I didn’t cry. There were no tears left.



When I opened my eyes again, sunlight streamed through the curtains, warm against my skin. And right there, at the foot of my bed, stood Jared and Jackson.



“Good morning,” Jared said with a sheepish smile, holding a tray. “We brought you breakfast.”



Jackson placed the tray gently on my lap. Toast, scrambled eggs, some fruit, and a glass of orange juice. Bland and almost cold.



“Thought you could use something to start the day,” Jackson added, sitting at the edge of the bed.



I looked at them. They looked casual. Relaxed. Almost happy. Like the last few days hadn’t happened.



“Look,” Jared said, scratching the back of his neck. “We’re sorry. Audrey told us she saw an Instagram story of you at a party that night… and she was just hurt, you know? She got robbed and stabbed while thinking you were out dancing. She… she thought you were ignoring her on purpose.”



Jackson chimed in. “She really believed it. So… maybe you should apologize to her. Just to clear things up.”



I stared at them in disbelief, then scoffed.



“Maybe you should apologize to me.”



That made them blink.



Jared frowned. “Why would we? It’s not like we did anything wrong. You didn’t tell us what happened. If you had, we could’ve been there for you.”



I let out a bitter laugh. “Do I need to beg to be cared about now? I was gone for days. You didn’t even check.”



“Don’t say that,” Jackson said firmly. “Audrey got stabbed. She needs us.”



“And I didn’t?” My voice sharpened. “So if I’m not bleeding in front of you, I don’t deserve a second thought?”



Before either of them could respond, the door creaked open and in she came.



Audrey. She wore a soft, oversized sweater and limped slightly. Her face was pale, lips trembling as tears welled up in her eyes.



“Are you picking a fight with me now, Maureen?” she whispered, her voice shaking. “I’m sorry. Okay? I didn’t mean to get hurt. I didn’t mean for any of this to happen.”



I watched her carefully. Her trembling, her pout, the subtle gaslighting laced in every word. Like she was the one being attacked.



Again. The tears slipped down her cheeks.



“I just… I don’t want us to be enemies. We were sisters once… I wish we could go back.”



And just like that, the boys snapped.



“Stop making her cry, Maureen,” Jared snapped.



“Come on, Audrey,” Jackson said softly. “You shouldn’t be walking too much. Let’s get you back to bed.”



They turned to her with such care, such concern—it stung.



“I’ll feed you,” Jared said as he took her hand. “You need to eat.”



“Yeah,” Jackson added. “You need your strength. We’ll get your favorite seafood in the other room.”



Then they turned back to me.



“You eat what we made, Maureen,” Jared said. “You’ve been discharged. Stop being so picky.”



And with that, they led Audrey out, leaving me alone again.



I looked down at the plate in front of me. The eggs were rubbery. The toast, dry. The fruit was unripe.



Across the hall, I could hear them laughing.



Audrey’s voice rang out clear: “Mmm, I love crab legs! You remembered I hate toast, right? Seafood’s my favorite!”



Of course it was. They gave me scraps and fed her a feast.



I didn’t cry. Not this time. I was just done.



My phone buzzed.



It was a message from Mom: Venue options are in. Also attached are the dresses. Let me know what you like, darling.



I tapped the call icon.



“Mom,” I said, my voice steady.



“Maureen! Did you get the pictures? What do you think of the flower arrangements?” she asked excitedly. “And also the dresses?”



“I like everything. It was actually hard to choose,” I replied. “I’ll finalize it today. But I think I like the vintage one.”



“Great! We’ll prepare it for you. How long until you come back? Your groom’s waiting, you know. He’s very eager.”



“Just a few more days. Something happened, but I’ll be there. I’m looking forward to wearing those dresses… to the wedding.”



Mom let out a soft laugh. “That’s my girl. We’ll wait for you.”



I hung up. I stared at the tray, untouched. Then I felt it—the silence shift.



I looked up. Jared and Jackson stood in the doorway. I hadn’t even heard them come back.



Their eyes locked on me, their faces unreadable.



Jackson’s voice came first. “Dress to the wedding?”



Then Jared stepped forward, his brows pulling into a frown. “Wedding? What wedding?”

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

but I wrote a comfort scene for her, she needed a motherly hug ali asked if I could share it and she said yes

Today was just bad from wake to now. Boss coming down on you for the little things,  that one friend that was ride or die finally blocking you after sending a scathing message on how what you are doing is wrong. Even the coffee shop ran out of rose mint tea. Your doctor just called and moved the necessary yearly check up a month back onto a black out day at work.

 Marching down the street fuming you see an older woman sitting on the sidewalk leaning on a tree with her eyes closed. As weird as that may seem what your eyes go to is her shirt offering mom hugs. Who better to ask than a random stranger, asking your friend sometimes feels weird.

Walking over to her she is tapping a hand against a heart in blue and pink in her leg to some beat.

""Um... Excuse me ma'am"" you mutter in almost a whisper both hoping she will hear and she won't.

Suddenly her eyes fly open behind her glasses and straightens her skirt.

""I'm sorry sweetie, did you need something? Max almost didn't tell me"" patting the tree as she stands up

"" Um, no... It's nothing,  your shirt. I'm sorry to bother you"" you blurt out turning to leave. This was definitely a mistake, a random person and you started a conversation 

Suddenly a hand lands on your shoulder

""Hold on"" she says sternly then her voice softens. ""I wear this shirt so people that need it can feel safe to ask when their day is turning to crap. You came over so I know you need something. Please ask""

""MayIgetahug"" you mumble out rushed looking at the ground.

Chuckling she puts a finger under your chin and presses up so you look up. ""There is no shame in asking so never look down when you want a need fulfilled baby girl. Take a slow deep breath in and out and ask again, the right way""

""Ma'am can I get a hug and make it as momish as you can? You ask fighting her finger but not resisting enough to look down 

""Oh princess of course. I got you, come here your safe"" she replies pulling you onto an embrace and strokes your hair. ""Tell me all about it, let this mom help you.""

As you start letting it go and your eyes start watering. ""I'm sorry."" You sniffle trying to pull back so you don't get your snot and tears on her. 

""Uh, uh. My shoulder is absorbent, the tear and snot stains are a badge of honor to this shirt. You, darling are not going anywhere until you are empty. So cry it out."" She whispers as she reinforces her hug.

After you taper out and get it all out she lets go and you almost fall, weak from holding everything in for so long.

""Whoa, sugar that took a lot out of you. Here let's get you to that bench and you can take a rest."" She chuckled holding you up and guiding you to the bench and setting you down at one end.

Sitting down she unrolls the pillow she had to show a mesh duster and pats her lap.

""Rest your head dear and you gather your energy, nap if you need it. I'm not going anywhere until you are ok.

When I get off work you're one of the first people I talk to, and the only person I ask to hang with me. You don't judge me for my past, for not knowing how to make friends. 

You watch as I show you my artwork, you geek out with me over my favorite games, and you aren't afraid to be seen with me.

You don't pry when I mention certain things I can't stand. You want to fight my parents just as much as I want to fight yours. 

The way we met wasn't anything flashy, nothing like the love stories we gag at together. We happened to work at the same shitty convenience store, opposite shifts. Until the day you were told you had to join my shift. I trained you in a week, and we became a tag team. I'd pick you up on the way to work, you'd buy us both coffee. And then you started opening up first. I was chopping tomatoes and onions when we started talking more. It wasn't long before talking to you was the most natural thing in the world to me, and I didnt even realize you made my day brighter.

The day I was in a car accident you were the first person to reach out to me and see if I was okay. You were calmer than most, which kept me calmer than I thought. 

it wasn't long after that day that you quit. I fell back into a dull routine for months. And then, when I least expected it, you came back. We worked together again and I was overjoyed. 

But that also didn't last. We were both let go around the same time, and neither of us were given a reason. I found a job again first, and helped you look for one. Then life started kicking both of our asses. 

Somewhere between constantly asking you to grab things on top shelves at work and getting coffee together, my view of you changed. We started hanging out more often, grabbing meals together, more coffees, even just talking for hours.

But I don’t know if I can keep my feelings to myself for the sake of our friendship. I'm trying because I don't want to lose another friendship, but im wrestling with this internal conflict while struggling to keep our friendship the same.",3,1769570455.0,letters,1,1.0,False

My husband and I have been to Japan before (2015) and spent quite a bit of time being typical tourists in the “big three” cities. We’re going back for about two weeks in Sept/Oct, but this time we are doing a completely different kind of trip. It will be busy; we’ll \*almost\* always be on the move. A mix of hiking, brief stops in cities, and some periodic days of relaxation sprinkled in. Less about seeing tourist spots, more about nature and keeping fit and eating yummy food. I know that the cost of things has gone up everywhere as well, but I don’t know how inflation in Japan compares with Canada after currency value shifts. 

\*\*Itinerary\*\*

Tokyo - 3 nights (mostly for food, tbh)

\*Hike the Usui Pass, Yokokawa to Karuizawa\*

Karuizawa - 2 nights (plan: relax and enjoy nature and drink coffee and craft beer)

Narai-juku - 1 night (to stay at Byaku Narai for my husband’s birthday)

\*Hike to Kiso (Torii Pass, etc)\*

Kiso-Fukushima - 1 night 

\*Hike Nagiso to Tsumago to Magome\*

Magome - 1 night 

Hiroshima - 1 night

Miyajima - 1 night (plan to hike up the mountain)

Kyoto - 2 nights 

Osaka - 1 night (fly out of KIX)

I’m the type who likes to carry cash instead of constantly having to find ATMs/banks, especially if we’ll be on trail for a number of days throughout the trip. I know acceptance of cards is increasing, but I’d like to mostly not have to worry about it. Our accommodations are booked & I won’t need cash for that. 

What do you recommend as an appropriate amount of ¥ for two people for two weeks? 

We plan to eat well and don’t really have a strict budget, but we also know that some of the best meals in Japan are not necessarily expensive. We’re also typically happy to hit a konbini for snacks or light meals when it’s convenient or we’re short on time. 

We don’t usually go nuts on souvenirs, we typically buy one high quality item instead of many knickknacks (we bought a beautiful/quality kitchen knife last time), but I assume that will happen in a city near the end of the trip so we can likely use a credit card for that.

1qozqgt,https://www.reddit.com/r/UARSnew/comments/1qozqgt/searching_what_is_the_meaning_of_life/,searching what is the meaning of life ?,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

This cycle I received multiple pre-interview holds but **no II's**, and I am trying to understand whether there is a clear weakness in my application or if this is just how competitive MD-PhD admissions have become.

I am three years out of undergrad, with a 3.89 GPA and a 512 MCAT. I know the MCAT is not exceptional for MD-PhD programs, but I did not expect it to result in being screened out everywhere.

I have roughly 8,000 hours of research experience, including basic cancer biology in undergrad and full-time post-grad work in clinical and translational hematology oncology. I also spent 2.5 years doing data entry for a remote clinical trial, which gave me exposure to clinical research workflows. I currently work at a top-rated NCI cancer center as a research technician without a primary postdoc, giving me significant independence and first-hand experience building projects from the ground up. My work has always focused on hematology oncology, and I want to continue both research and clinical practice in this field.

I do not yet have a peer-reviewed publication, though a correlative project tied to a clinical trial is about to be submitted, and I built an independent project I plan to submit in June. I have presented research during undergrad and at a recent conference.

Clinically, I have two years volunteering in a pediatric hematology oncology clinic and \~80 hours of shadowing across inpatient, outpatient, and niche heme/onc procedures. I also volunteer at a local food bank and serve as a scientific mentor for junior lab members, from high school students to medical students.

Outside of research and clinic work, I served as a TA, acted as fraternity treasurer (eliminating debt), captained my university club tennis team, and was a campus tour guide. I have played piano since childhood as my main stress relief and enjoy cooking and coffee as hobbies.

I am confident in my scientific maturity, independence, and long-term commitment to physician scientist training. I am trying to understand whether the lack of publications is a major red flag, whether I am missing another weakness, or whether I was realistically filtered out primarily due to stats (MCAT).

If I reapply, I would appreciate advice on whether retaking the MCAT is worthwhile, how much weight pending or newly submitted manuscripts carry, how to adjust my school list, and what changes admissions committees expect from reapplicants.

(This is a throwaway account.)

I’m a 28F and finished my BA in Environmental Studies in 2024. I took my current job with a very small landscaping company because it offered a livable wage and allowed me to stay close to my family. Although it wasn’t the career path I originally planned, I’ve grown to enjoy the work—especially the hands-on skills, plant knowledge, and business mentorship over the last 2 years.

The owners are a married couple, C (43F) and J (57M). They’ve been generous employers and initially strong mentors, and I was even offered future ownership in the business after just two years.

I work primarily with J, who runs the job sites, while C handles the office side. From the start, I was very intentional about maintaining professionalism and clear boundaries, especially as a younger woman working closely with her husband. Because we live very close to each other—and because they pay for my vehicle—J and I often carpooled to distant job sites, which meant we spent a lot of time talking. I believed we had developed a professional friendship.

J is funny and very generous, but he tends to make risky jokes with everyone. On a few occasions, he made comments that made me mildly uncomfortable. I’m quick to set boundaries—especially with men—due to past experiences, and whenever something bothered me, I addressed it directly.

Over the last couple of months, J began acting cold and distant toward me without explanation. Today, C told me this distancing was intentional and tied to tension J has been feeling toward me. Apparently, J has been worried that he made me uncomfortable and chose to withdraw rather than talk to me directly. This has also been affecting his mood and has caused tension between him and C.

Two incidents seem to have contributed to this. The first was when J made an inappropriate joke about me rooting through his underwear drawer while I was pet-sitting for them. I immediately told him that crossed a boundary for me. This wasn’t the first time I’d corrected a too risky joke, and at the time, we talked it through and he said everything was fine. The second incident was when J and I met for coffee to discuss the business, and I asked whether C knew we were meeting. I meant this innocently and explained that I was just trying to be respectful and transparent with her, but it seems to have carried more weight than I realized.

Looking back, there were other signs that the dynamic had become emotionally complicated. J has very few friends and became emotionally open with me, including crying in front of me twice about how much my presence at work meant to him. He also told me he doesn’t express emotions like that with C. I didn’t encourage this, but I also didn’t fully grasp at the time how much emotional weight he was placing on our working relationship. I think I brushed some things under the rug, especially because he also shows clear love and dedication to C and their son. In hindsight, combined with what’s happening now, it feels like a lot.

To be very clear: J is the age of my dad, looks and acts similar to my dad, and I’ve swen him more as a father-figure if anything. I feel genuinely uncomfortable and upset at any suggestion of something inappropriate between us.

Because we had addressed those earlier incidents directly and he told me everything was fine, I assumed his recent coldness wasn’t my concern and had nothing to do with me.

Recently, C approached me privately to “resolve” the situation, explaining that things between her and J have been tense and that my presence at work has been part of that tension on and off since I started. She said J has no intention of discussing this with me directly. She also asked me not to tell J that she shared this with me, saying it would cause a major conflict between them if he knew. While C was respectful, this conversation left me feeling like I’m now working inside an unspoken emotional conflict that I can’t address or fix. While they seemingly both expect things to carry on as usual at work.

C suggested that I get coffee with J, and I initially agreed. But after thinking about it all day and talking with my family, I’m not sure how I can move forward. My parents admitted that they've been suspicious of J for a long time but didnt want to upset me, which was also a surprise.

This situation has made the job feel unstable. I care about both of them, but I don’t feel comfortable working in an environment where boundaries are unclear, communication is indirect, and I feel like I’m walking on eggshells. At the same time, this job offers financial stability and (what i thought were) long-term opportunities I had been planning my life around.

Given the emotional entanglement, lack of direct communication, and power imbalance, I’m struggling to assess whether this situation can realistically stabilize, or whether it’s the kind of workplace dynamic that’s healthier to step away from.

Ever since we moved in, it's been very stressful trying to uphold a living situation that we are both okay with. In short, she repeats the same annoying habits: not cleaning up after making coffee, breakfast, or lunch, not vacuuming/mopping our shared living space (I do it 99% of the time), leaving her shoes out of the closet, not cleaning up after eating, taking out the trash when it's been full for days, having her friends over WITHOUT letting me know beforehand AND when I tell her no I wanna relax at home (this happened MULTIPLE times), to just name a few. I remind her 5 times not to do something and she still does it anyways, and ALWAYS with an excuse ""no but this time I genuinely forgot""...

Our grocery plan is that I shop for all veggies + fruits cause they're heavy + far away by subway (we don't have a car) and she shops half of the dairy/meat from the next door supermarket (I also shop there cause it's close so I tend to grab a few things on my way back from uni, hence my other half). Today she cooked (it was her turn) the last batch of frozen chicken we had, went to a bakery in the SAME COMPLEX AS THE NEARBY SUPERMARKET, and didn't think of getting chicken for the next few days. I passed by the supermarket on my way back to get a bunch of dairy so I told her when she's back from uni can she pls get ONLY chicken on her way because I couldn't carry everything back and she was like ""it's not my problem, it's your turn to cook tomorrow and you didn't know how to manage your time to get chicken. I didn't pay attention to how much chicken was left when I took it out to cook today so idc."" Bro what? I also had an 8:30am lab today and 6 hours total of classes/labs so I didn't have time to take out all the dishwasher (which I ALWAYS do btw cause I wake up earlier than her so I take it out 99% of the year) and when I came back she STILL DIDN'T TAKE THE DISHWASHER OUT. She said ""why didn't you do it if it only takes 2 mins"" when she only had 2 hours of class today (in the afternoon) and then hanged out with her friend. How hard was it to take out the dishwasher, which she only does once a MONTH when in a particular day I have a lot on my plate?

Anyways I got mad because these kinds of conversations happen on a daily basis and I couldn't hold it in anymore. I called her stupid (English translation, it's more rude in our native language) which ik I shouldn't have but also you can't expect me to stay respectful after you disrespect me so many times for so long like this. Like idt she should expect a nice response after we've talked a million times about what's expected from each person in this house? I just don't know what to do at this point. I talked to my parents and they talk to her about it, she adjusts for 1 day, and goes back to her old habits. I really want to just live alone but we can't afford for both of us to rent an apartment each, and we still have a few more years to go until we finish our degree.",1,1769569046.0,AmIOverreacting,2,0.67,False

Marriage and Divorce) 💔💼,"“Some vows are not broken—they are ache-unraveled, betrayal-braided, and lit by the fire of those who dared to love again.” - Nagato’s Scrolls 

Three women—Sa Pi-young, Boo Hye-ryung, and Lee Si-eun—each in different stages of life, each married to men who once promised forever. But behind the polished facades of their marriages lie secrets, infidelity, and emotional erosion. As their husbands stray—some for lust, some for loneliness, some for ego—the women are left to confront not just betrayal, but the question: What remains when love is no longer sacred?

And in the flicker of late-night radio broadcasts, empty dinner tables, and whispered apologies, the ache of those who gave everything, and the fire of those who refused to disappear, the Golden Inu appears—his fur brushed with divorce papers and lipstick-stained coffee cups, his eyes reflecting the ache of those who stayed too long, and those who left too late.

He is the flamekeeper of sovereign heartbreak, the mythic guardian of those who turned endings into emergence.

📜 Inscribed within the scroll:
- A scene of Pi-young staring at her reflection in the studio glass, the Golden Inu beside her, tail curled like a question of self-worth.  
- Si-eun writing her next script, the Inu between her and the silence, eyes glowing with the ache of endurance and rediscovery.  
- Hye-ryung walking out of a courtroom, heels echoing like a verdict, the Inu behind her, eyes steady with sovereign chill.  
- A sigil of “이별 속 불꽃의 자각”—Flame of Realization Within the Breakup—etched in ring and resignation, pulsing like a heartbeat beneath every betrayal and every boundary.  
- A whispered vow: “Even if the world calls it failure, I will guard the fire that remembered your becoming.” - Nagato’s Scrolls 

🕯️ This scroll is a relic of sovereign reckoning, of marriage braided with ache and awakening, and of guardianship that honors the fire of those who dared to love, lost, and lived again.",1,1769569032.0,GoldenInuTokens,1,1.0,False
1qozdgz,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1qozdgz/hr_sparkles_the_magnificent/,[HR] Sparkles the Magnificent,"*A failing children's entertainer discovers his recent bookings share one thing in common: they're all at houses where someone recently died. When a client admits there is no birthday child—only an envelope of cash thicker than any honest gig would pay—Dennis faces the question of what a person becomes when survival requires not asking why.*

The house is a split-level ranch with yellow crime scene tape still fluttering from the mailbox. Dennis sits in his Civic with the engine running, looking at the booking confirmation. Party starts at 2 PM. It's 1:47. The deposit already cleared—$150, which means his electric stays on another month.

He knows this address. Woman stabbed her husband in the kitchen last Tuesday. He'd seen it on the news while eating cereal in his efficiency apartment, the reporter standing approximately where Dennis's car is now parked.

This is the third one.

The first time, he'd thought it was coincidence. A house in Riverside where a teenager had hanged himself in the garage. Dennis had arrived to find a grandmother who seemed confused about having booked a clown, but she'd paid cash and there were kids there—cousins, maybe—so he did forty minutes of balloon animals and card tricks. The whole time, he could see the garage door from the backyard. Someone had painted over whatever color it used to be with fresh white paint that didn't match the trim.

The second time, he'd known before he got out of the car. A duplex in Northside where a man had shot his girlfriend. Dennis had sat in the parking lot for twenty minutes that time, looking at his bank balance on his phone. Negative forty-three dollars. He'd gone in. A woman in her sixties answered, said she was the landlord, said she'd booked the clown for her grandson's birthday. There was no grandson there. She'd watched Dennis perform his entire routine in an empty living room, sitting on a folding chair, not smiling. She paid him in twenties that smelled like cigarettes.

Now this.

Dennis pulls down the visor and looks at himself in the mirror. He's already done his makeup at home—can't afford to waste the gas idling while he does it in the car anymore. White face, red nose, blue diamonds around his eyes. The wig is on the passenger seat, a purple explosion of synthetic fiber that cost him forty dollars in 2008 and has been shedding ever since.

His phone says 1:51.

He could leave. He could drive to the library and sit in the parking lot and use their WiFi to look for real jobs, the kind where you wear a polo shirt and say ""team player"" in interviews. He's fifty-three. He has a GED and a gap in his resume the size of a decade. The last time he applied to Target, they didn't even send a rejection email.

At 1:56, he puts on the wig.

The doorbell doesn't work, so he knocks. A man answers immediately, like he was standing right there. Mid-forties, glasses, wearing a cardigan in August. He looks at Dennis the way you'd look at a package you forgot you ordered.

""You're the clown,"" the man says.

""Sparkles the Magnificent."" Dennis does a little bow, the one that used to get laughs. His lower back pops.

""Come in.""

The living room is clean but wrong. The furniture is too neat, arranged like a showroom. There's a birthday banner hung over the fireplace—Happy 8th Birthday—but the letters are crooked, put up by someone who doesn't hang banners often. No toys. No kid debris. The carpet has vacuum lines.

""Where's the birthday boy?"" Dennis asks, though he already knows.

""He's shy. He'll come out."" The man sits on the couch, folds his hands. ""You can start.""

Dennis has been doing this for sixteen years. He knows when a party is wrong. He knew at the duplex, knew at the Riverside house. But he'd performed anyway, because the alternative was going home to an apartment where the refrigerator had nothing but condiments and a half-gallon of milk he was rationing.

He sets down his bag and pulls out the rainbow scarf chain. ""Okay, well, I usually start with some magic—""

""Do the one with the disappearing coin.""

Dennis hasn't mentioned the disappearing coin. It's not even one of his better tricks. ""Sure, okay."" He pulls out his coin cup. His hands are shaking slightly, which makes palming harder, but he gets through it. The man watches without expression.

""Again,"" the man says.

Dennis does it again.

""Again.""

On the fourth repetition, Dennis stops. ""Is there actually a kid here?""

The man looks at him for a long time. ""No.""

The word sits between them. Dennis should leave. He should grab his bag and walk out and never answer another booking email again. Instead, he hears himself say, ""You still paying the full rate?""

""Yes.""

""Okay."" Dennis pulls out the balloon pump. ""What do you want me to make?""

The man tells him to make a dog. Then a sword. Then a hat. Dennis makes them and sets them on the coffee table, where they squeak against the wood. The man doesn't touch them. He just watches Dennis's hands.

After forty-five minutes, Dennis's fingers are cramping and there are two dozen balloon animals on every surface. The room looks deranged, all those bright twisted shapes in the too-clean house.

""I think that's probably good,"" Dennis says. ""For the time you paid for.""

The man reaches into his cardigan and pulls out an envelope. Cash. Dennis can see the bills inside, more than the agreed rate. Maybe double.

""Next month,"" the man says. ""Same time. I'll send you the address.""

Dennis takes the envelope. It's thick. He could say no. He could ask what this is actually about. He could do a lot of things.

""Okay,"" he says.

In the car, he counts it. Four hundred dollars. He sits there with the bills in his lap, still wearing the wig, and tries to remember when he last had four hundred dollars at once. His phone buzzes—a text from his landlord about September rent.

He knows he'll go to the next one. And the one after that. He knows this the same way he knows his knee will hurt when it rains, the same way he knows the Civic needs new brake pads he can't afford. Some things you just know about yourself.

Dennis starts the car and pulls away from the split-level ranch. In the rearview mirror, he can see the man standing in the doorway, watching him leave. The balloon animals are still visible through the window, bright and absurd.

He stops at the gas station on the way home and fills the tank all the way up, not just twenty dollars' worth. It feels like wealth. It feels like drowning.

That night, in his apartment, he doesn't look up the next address when the booking email comes. He just accepts it and watches the deposit clear. The refrigerator hums. The lights stay on. Dennis washes the makeup off his face and sees himself underneath—fifty-three years old, tired, complicit.

In the morning, he'll buy groceries. Real groceries, not just ramen and peanut butter. He'll get eggs and bread and maybe even coffee that doesn't come in a red plastic tub. He'll feel grateful for these things.

And next month, he'll put on the wig again.

1qozd7x,https://i.redd.it/yj9z8hr490gg1.png,"Google pays $68M to settle ""Eavesdropping"" lawsuit: Did Assistant record you without permission?","Google has agreed to pay $68 million to settle a massive class-action lawsuit alleging that Google Assistant illegally recorded users' private conversations even when they didn't say ""Hey Google"". 

The plaintiffs argued that ""false accepts"", where the device mistakenly thinks it heard the wake word, led to the recording of sensitive discussions about finances, employment, and personal lives, which were then allegedly used to serve targeted advertisements. 

While Google denies any wrongdoing and insists Assistant only listens when activated, they agreed to the payout to avoid a risky jury trial. The settlement covers anyone who purchased a Google Assistant-enabled device (phones, Home speakers, tablets) since May 18, 2016.

*Did You Know?*

* **The ""False Accept"" Mechanism:** The core of the lawsuit isn't just that it recorded, but *why*. The plaintiffs claimed Google's algorithms were too aggressive, interpreting random noises or similar-sounding phrases as ""hot words"" to maximize data collection, effectively turning the devices into always-on bugs.
* **Apple Did It Too:** This isn't an isolated incident. Apple just settled a nearly identical lawsuit regarding **Siri** for **$95 million**. Those payments started going out this month (January 2026), with users receiving between $8 and $40 depending on how many devices they owned.
* **The Lawyer Tax:** Don't expect a huge windfall. Class counsel is requesting up to **33%** of the fund (approx. $22.7 million) for legal fees. With millions of eligible users, the individual payout for this Google settlement will likely be less than the price of a coffee.
* **Human Reviewers:** One of the most disturbing revelations from similar investigations (like the 2019 leaks) was that ""false accept"" recordings weren't just processed by AI—they were often listened to by **human contractors** to ""grade"" the transcription accuracy, meaning a stranger may have actually heard your private moments.

1qozc2g,https://www.reddit.com/r/anxietypilled/comments/1qozc2g/my_girlfriend_is_the_creator_of_the_universe/,My girlfriend is the creator of the universe,"Katie, my girlfriend, asked me to write this story of our relationship. She wanted me to call it *The Gospel of Scott*.

Even though I delivered her message like she asked, and even though I suffered so terribly for doing it, I still don't feel like my story should be elevated to the level of a religious text. So I'm just calling it what it is: my girlfriend is literally God. 

I met her at The Anchor. I was working my way through the crowd to get to the bar when I felt a hand on my shoulder. I turned around to see who it was. I wish I could say I had an ""I see the light"" style religious experience when I saw her. But truthfully, my first thoughts were 90% lust and 10% total shock that someone so beautiful had chosen me to talk to.

She was short, athletic, and super-cute. Her dark brown hair framed a beaming face that suggested a complicated mix of genes from Asia, Africa, and South America.

""Get me one of whatever you're having!""

""Beer okay?""

""As long as you're having one too!""

I know this isn't exactly the sort of exchange you'd expect between a mortal and The Lord of the universe. The problem is that our expectations about the cosmos are a bit off. Religion. Physics. Philosophy. Each of these systems of ideas kind-of misses the mark regarding what reality actually is.

Of course, that night in the bar, I had no idea that I had just met the one God, ruler of the universe. I was just giddy over the possibility that my lonely Friday night could include hanging out with this seriously beautiful woman. How could I have known that I would eventually become her prophet? And her martyr.

I managed to push my way to the bar, get two Guinnesses and wind my way back to her. ""I'm Katie,"" she said as she took one of the beers.

""I'm Scott."" My social anxiety kicked in at that moment and all words left me. My brain refused to come up with anything to say next. I started to sweat.

She smiled. If there was a religious experience to be had that night, it happened then. Her smile melted away my mental block. Suddenly I felt like I had known her forever and I wanted to tell her about my entire life. About every random thing that ever happened to me. Every stupid thought I've ever had.

I babbled about the time I missed the bus in third grade. My grandma's funeral. The first day of my first job after graduation. Losing my virginity. We moved from the crowded first floor of The Anchor to a quiet corner upstairs and I babbled some more. After a few more drinks, we left the bar and hung out in a coffee shop down the street.

I remember finishing my cappuccino and looking into the cup. The bubbles of the last bits of milk foam were slowly popping. I stopped talking for a moment to watch the little blob of foam at the bottom of the mug shrink into a tiny puddle of milk. It was only then, hours after I bought the first beers in The Anchor, that I realized I'd been talking nonstop.

""I'm so sorry!"" I blurted out. ""I've just been rambling for hours, you must be so sick of hearing every damn thing that's ever passed through my mind.""

""Scott. I could listen to you all night."" She smiled then reached across the table and grabbed my hand. ""I could do anything with you all night.""

Katie is sitting next to my bed as I'm writing this and she just told me that I ""should write down *everything* we did the evening we met. In extreme detail. Every position. Every kink.""

""We want people to actually read this,” she told me. “It's important. So why not throw in a bunch of sex? You know, to make sure my message is spread as widely as possible.""

She has a point. But I'm too shy to write down literally everything we did. Since this is my story. My gospel, as she calls it, I'm just going to say that we went back to my place and spent the night doing pretty-much everything that a man and a woman can do to please each other.

We stayed in bed together for most of the next day. She came over the next night too. By the end of the week, we were seeing each other every day

Whenever I'm in her presence, even now - in this ICU bed - I feel like I'm drunk on happiness. I babble and blather like a fool. Amazingly, she pays attention to me.

But in all my blathering during those first weeks of our relationship, I hardly ever asked her about herself. Only twice in those early days, before she revealed herself to me, did I probe her for information about herself.

""Katie, if you want, I can drive you home. Uh, wherever that is.""

""Ha! I don't need a ride. I kind-of live everywhere, you know?"" I didn't know what she meant. But I didn't pull on that thread either. I was just too happy and too afraid to discover something that would make it all end.

A few days later, I asked if I could drop her off at work when I drove to the office.

""I work from home.""

""I've never seen you work."" Even in my love-struck stupor, I still managed to get to the office and even answer a few work emails from my apartment in the evenings.

""I make my own hours.""

Katie insists that she didn't do any mind tricks on me to make me overlook these things that normally would be fairly obvious red flags. No home that she would tell me about or show me. No obvious job. I was drunk on love, and rational thought wasn't exactly in my skill-set. My state of euphoria ended the weekend I drove us to the lake.

The lake is about a three-hour drive out-of-town. Up in the mountains there’s a beautiful lake with a state park that’s got a beach, a boat rental, a nice restaurant, and some cabins you can rent. I splurged and rented one of the cabins by the beach. Yes - it was super-romantic, in case you’re wondering.

Our first night there, we were cuddling on the bed.

""Let's go canoeing,"" she whispered.

""It's midnight. The boat rental desk is closed.""

""Let's steal a boat!""

She leapt out of bed and quickly threw on her shorts and one of my T-shirts. ""Let's go! We’ll pull-off a heist!""

By the time I got dressed and tiptoed out the door of our mini-cottage, Katie was already on the beach, crouching next to the lock securing the ends of the steel cable that secured the small fleet of rental boats to a tree.

""Got it!"" she whisper-shouted to me. ""Grab two paddles.""

I grabbed a pair of paddles and we quietly moved one of the rental canoes to the water. She got in the bow, I pushed the boat into the water and scrambled into the stern.

We paddled stealthily to the center of the lake. There was no wind, and the water was glassy smooth. Tree-covered hills rose sharply from the shoreline, illuminated by the full moon. We stopped paddling and drifted together in silence.

She finally spoke.

""There's something I need to tell you.""

I closed my eyes. Something bad was coming. She was going to dump me.

""Go ahead.""

""I'm God.""

My eyes shot open. It wasn't the bad news I was expecting her to give me. But it wasn't good, either. ""You're ... what?""

""God. I created the universe. It was me.""

""You mean metaphorically. Like a woman's womb creates life so you're a goddess, or something like that.""

""No. I mean it literally. I'm God. The one and only God. Don’t worry - It's not that big a deal. It's not like I'm dumping you.""

I stared at her for a minute. She was grinning with the weird mixture of mischief and hilarity that made me love her so much. Maybe, I thought, the reason I found her energy and her radiant personality so unique and captivating was because she was suffering badly from a mental illness. Bipolar disorder, maybe. I had met her in a period of mania. I closed my eyes again.

Whatever was wrong with her, I decided, I didn't care. In that moment in the stolen canoe, I imagined the rest of my life with her. Whatever struggles with her illness lay in front of us. Whatever terrible moments we would share, I was up for it. I was ready to be with her forever no matter what.

""Katie, I-""

She cut me off. ""Touch the top of that hill."" She pointed. ""The tall one on the west side of the lake. Just reach out and touch it.""

""It's two miles away.""

""Come on. Just do it! Humor me.""

I extended my arm in the direction of the far-away hilltop. My hand grew as I moved it away from my body. Or maybe the hill shrank. Whatever it was, space and distance *changed*. Reaching towards the thousand foot hill two miles from the canoe was no different than reaching towards a miniature model in a model train set. You know those dumb tourist photographs, the kind where someone near the camera poses to make it look like they're touching something far away - like they're holding up the leaning tower of Pisa or something or touching the top of the pyramids at Giza. As long as the foreground and background are in focus, the illusion works.

My hand and the hilltop looked like one of those tricks with perspective. Except, I *actually* touched the top of the hill. My fingers, now somehow made gigantic compared to the trees on the hill, felt the branches and limbs like bristles on a broom.

I snatched my hand back. It shrank back to its normal size as I pulled back from the hilltop. My heart was pounding. Over the course of about fifteen seconds, I went from thinking I was being dumped by the love of my life, to thinking she was suffering from a serious mental illness, to thinking I was the one with the mental health issue.

""What did you do?"" I didn't mean to sound like I was accusing her, but I was wound up, and starting to get scared. ""How did you make me ... reach that far?""

She carefully slipped off her seat in the front of the canoe and crawled towards me. I backed away from her, fell backwards off the stern seat and collapsed into the awkward space between the seat and the rear of the boat. The canoe rocked dangerously.

She rose and walked the last few steps to the stern seat. Somehow, the boat remained stable despite my falling and her walking. ""It's okay."" She offered me her hand and helped me stand up. ""Turn around,"" she said.

I turned around and she wrapped her arms around my chest. ""Look at the moon,"" she said.

I looked at the moon. A full moon in a perfectly cloudless sky painted the lake and the hills with silver light. ""Now reach out and touch it.""

I started shaking. She gave me squeeze and I calmed down a little. I raised my right arm. The moon looked like a glowing golf ball next to my outstretched hand. I moved my hand in front of the moon and slowly closed my fingers. I grasped ... something. There was a small, cold, round object in my palm!

I relaxed my grip and stroked it with my fingertips. It was rough, like sandpaper. There were a few irregular dimples. Craters and mountains? Was I really touching the moon? If so, that meant my hand was somehow - I don’t know - thousands of miles across. I didn’t like the idea of being so massive. 

""Is this safe?"" I asked. ""What if I, like, shift its orbit? Couldn't that unleash huge tsunamis or earthquakes?""

""It's safe because I'm here with you.""

""I'm not going to mess it up, am I? I can't accidentally flatten mountains or put my fingerprints on huge parts of the surface?""

""Don't worry.""

I continued to stroke the moon. The friggin’ moon! ""What is this? How are you doing this?"" My voice was loud and shaky again.

""Well. It's a little complicated. But, since I'm literally God, it's not that hard to pull off. I just arranged some highly improbable quantum tunneling events, and some unlikely positional modalities.""

""Why do you keep saying you're God?"" It was a dumb question. But fear and confusion kept me deep in low-IQ territory.

""Because I am. And I'm going to keep saying it until you wrap your brain around it. Let go of the moon. I want you to feel something else.""

I brought my hand back to Earth. I stared at it - now it was just a normal hand.

""Reach out past the moon. Deep into space.""

I stretched upwards again, sending my hand past the moon, into the darkness of the night sky. It was cold. Colder than the moon. But I felt small pinpricks of heat on my wrist and forearm.

""You're feeling the stars,"" Katie said. ""Reach even farther into space""

I did as I was told. At first I felt nothing but more cold. Then there was a tingling warmth in my fingertips. Like I stuck my hand into a warm shower.

""You are feeling the farthest galaxies from us. The very edge of the universe. Use your left hand to feel the other side.""

I pushed my left hand into the sky, feeling the coldness of space, the heat of the stars, and eventually, the tingling glow of the clouds of countless galaxies.

""Your reach is spanning the universe. You've got the entirety of existence in your arms. Do you know what that means?""

I nodded no.

""It means this is the first time you've hugged me. Not this little human form of me in the boat, but the true me. We are embracing each other for the first time.""

She was quiet for a long time. I imagined everything that was between my hands. The impossible number of stars, and planets. It was all her.

""Now, I want you to do one more thing. Stretch even further out. Push your fingertips just a little further away. Past the warmth of the cloud of galaxies.""

I straightened my arms completely. I pushed my fingers through the warmth into whatever was beyond the universe.

My fingertips burned. And froze. They lit up with pain, but also seemed to disappear from my awareness at the same time.

“What is this? What is happening?”

The non-existence beyond the edge of the universe grabbed me. I felt it pulling my arms in both directions. The sensations shooting down the nerves in my arm made no sense. Pain, colors, sound, hate, beauty, mindlessnes. I was touching pure chaos. A disorder so profound that time and logic evaporated.

I reflexively tried to yank my hands back into the universe. The chaos beyond held them firm. I could feel my fingers merging with the chaos. Pulses of disordered energy, effects with no cause and events outside of time oozed up my arms. Chaos and disorder greedily invading the universe through my body.

""Help me!"" I screamed.

Katie squeezed me tight. ""Try to pull away again again.""

I pulled hard and the terrible madness spreading into my body slowly reversed its flow. My wrists emerged from the cloud of disorder, then my palms, then my fingertips. I collapsed backwards and Katie helped me sit back on the canoe seat.

""Now you know what I do for my day job,"" she said. ""I create reality from the void.""

“The void,” I said absently. My mind was no longer hooked up to my mouth.

“There’s no experience in the void - no mind can exist there. No love can exist there.”

She stepped backwards to the center of the canoe. I turned around to face her. The boat was unusually stable, given that we were standing in it.

My mind was racing. This is God. She's God. I'm with God. I'm dating God. I had *sex* with God.

""Katie, I'm not religious. I mean, I wasn't until just now. Um. Am I supposed to kneel? Or pray? Or cross myself? Or something like that?""

""Not exactly."" She pulled off her T-shirt and dropped it into the boat. ""I want you to make love to me."" She slipped her shorts off. ""Not in the boat though. On the lake.""

She stepped out of the boat and stood next to it. For her, the surface of the water was solid. ""Come on,"" she said, holding out her hand.

I stripped, took her hand and stepped out of the canoe. The boat didn't rock at all. I stood on the surface of the lake. The water gave a little as I put my weight on it, like I was walking on a trampoline. She led me away from the boat. I followed, walking with careful, bouncy steps. My heart was pounding.I started gasping for breath.

“Katie - or My Lord. Or -”

“Just Katie. I’m still me.”

“I don’t know if I can, you know -” I looked down at myself. Terror and romance don’t exactly mix well for me.

“Sure you can.” She grinned slyly. “Your lord commands it!” she said in a tone of mock authority. Then she started laughing hysterically. I eventually started laughing too. Then we lay down on the surface of the lake, and took the idea of walking on water to a whole new, adult-rated level.

I was awakened before dawn by a bird landing on my ankle. I was still lying on the surface of the lake. Katie was asleep next to me. At, least, she *looked like* she was asleep. But she’s God, so who knows. The bird regarded me for a moment, then flew off. I woke up Katie and we walked back across the surface of the lake to the canoe. We got dressed, climbed into the boat and paddled back to the beach.

Katie ran the security cable through the boat’s handle and locked it back in place. “I hope we don’t get in trouble for stealing the boat.”

“What do you care? You’re friggin God.” The panic and extreme disorientation of the night before was coming back to me. 

“You don’t know how this works, do you?”

“How what works?”

“The cosmos. Buy me breakfast and I’ll tell you all about it.”

We walked back to our rented mini-cabin, showered, dressed and made our way to the restaurant in the main lodge.

“Okay,” Katie said. “These eggs are pretty good.”

“But the universe. How it all works. The void. Why the hell you’re dating me?”

She put down her fork and smiled at me. ""Subatomic particles. They wiggle, you know. Jump around. Take your average electron or quark. At each instant it's in a new place. And you can't really predict where it'll be next. It could be here, it could be over there. Now here’s the thing though. Are you going to eat your toast?""

I put my toast onto her plate. “What’s the thing?”

She took three huge bits of toast. Slowly chewed and swallowed. “This is great toast.”

“The thing? About subatomic particles?”

“Right. Each time a particle moves, the universe *branches*. It branches big time. There’s a whole new parallel universe created for each possible place that particle could be. There’s zillions of new parallel universes created every instant.”

“That seems like an unreasonable number of universes,” I said. “There must be billions created every nanosecond just from the matter in your fork.”

“Trillions. And multiply that by all the matter and energy everywhere. Trillions of trillions of trillions of new worlds branching off this one each instant. And the same number again branching off of each of those.”

“I don't want to throw shade on your creation, but that seems like an awful lot of universes.”

“Yeah. Well, I guess I just like universes. Most of them end up getting recycled by the void. All but one, actually, are gobbled up by the randomness.”

“Just one universe out of all the possible ones survives?”

“Yes, the universe that I choose to experience is the one that sticks around. I *choose* which universe I want to experience. Which branch of the tree of branching realities to call home. That's what reality is. The particular branch of the hyper-expanding tree of universes that I choose to experience.”

She finished the toast. Then ordered more eggs and two servings of hash browns.

We stayed at the lake for another two days. Katie said I acted pretty weird towards her during that time. She’s totally right. I tried to worship her for a few hours (“stop,” she said. “It’s really annoying when you do that”). I tried to get her to do more cool God-tricks - turn the toilet into gold or make me twelve feet tall. Stuff like that. (“Scott, I’m pretty sure you’d hate it if you were twelve feet tall.”) I asked her about the dinosaurs (“Yeah, they were pretty cool.”) and the big bang (“it was neato, you know.”). 

“Look,” she finally told me. “I make reality, right. Like, I’m making it right now. And the reality I want is the one where we’re just a normal couple. For now. In fact, I want to move in with you.”

“Of course. I can help you move your stuff in.”

“I don’t have any stuff. I don’t even have my own place.”

“You’re homeless? You’re God! Why not make a mansion? Or a palace?”

“The universe is my house. I’m comfortably at home wherever I am.”

Katie didn’t see the point in somehow magic-ing up a bunch of money either. After she moved in, I still went to work every day. Still paid rent and bills. Still filled my car with gas. I even bought her new clothes - a few pairs of  jeans and some T-shirts.

She was God, so she got what she wanted. A basically normal romantic relationship.

A few weeks after she moved in, Katie came with me to an after-work happy hour. Watching her make casual small-talk with my oblivious co-workers was both hilarious and frustrating. She chatted with Ken, my devout Christian boss, about craft beer. What would he do if he learned that Katie was the deity who he had devoted his life to worshiping? 

I was still thinking about Ken on the way home, ""You met my boss, Ken. You talked about craft beer, remember. He’s a super-devout Christian.""

""I know.""

""So, you're who he worships, right? Like the bible. And that stuff?""

""That stuff.” She laughed, “You mean *Christianity*?""

""Okay, yes. Ken is, how do I say this, directing his energy to the right deity?""

""Not exactly.""

""So, like, Jesus. Ten commandments. Noah-""

""Let's just say that I chose a path through all possible universes to one where the Bible exists.""

Two weeks after the happy hour, I came home from work to find Katie waiting for me in a black business suit. I had never seen that outfit before. It certainly wasn't one that I bought her.

""Scott,"" she said in an atypically serious tone. ""I love you. Which is why I chose you for this. I have to ask you to do me a favor. It's kind-of a biggie.”

“Anything.” I meant it.

“I'm going on a business trip soon. Before I go, I want you to communicate a message to everyone.”

“I thought you *were* the universe. You are everything everywhere. Where are you going?”

“I have urgent business outside of anything that you can comprehend. Don’t worry, I’ll be back”

“When?”

“A couple trillion years.”

I collapsed onto the sofa. Tears filled my eyes. 

She sat down next to me. “You don’t have to wait that long, though. You’ll be with me soon. After you deliver my message.”

I didn’t like the sound of that. *I’ll be with her soon*, outside of anything that I can comprehend. But I love her. And also, she’s the boss, you know. “What is the message?”

She stood and walked to the kitchen counter. She picked up a sharpie and a piece of cardboard that appeared to be a ripped-off side of a large cardboard box. She uncapped the marker and wrote these words on the cardboard:



GOD IS NOT COMING TO HELP US

SO

WE HAVE TO HELP EACH OTHER

  


“This message is going to piss a lot of people off,” she said. “But everyone needs to know this. And this message has to come from you.”

“Why does it have to come from me? I mean, you could paint it in the sky with hundred-mile-high flaming letters. An unambiguous message from God!”

“Well, maybe. But the point is that I’m not going to be around. So proving that I *am* around as part of saying I’m not will be pretty confusing for folks. I need a prophet. And that’s you.”

“So, I … what?” I was still crying a little and I wiped my nose on my sleeve. “I walk around with this sign?” 

“No. I want you to *stand* around with this sign. At major intersections downtown. Do it 16 hours a day until you can’t do it anymore.”

So I did.

The next morning I called in sick to work and walked to the end of the off-ramp where the interstate dumps traffic downtown. Tens of thousands of cars pour through that intersection every day.

Drivers began honking at me almost as soon as I arrived at the pedestrian island in the middle of the intersection. I studied their faces as they drove by to try to figure out if they were honking in support or anger. I soon learned the “language” of car honking. Two or three quick toots of the horn is a sign of support. Some of these “toot-toot” drivers gave me thumbs-up signs as they passed me. A long, single blast of the horn signifies anger. Rage, even. The longer the driver lays on the horn, the more likely I was to also get a middle finger or even a shouted curse as they drove by. The angry horn blasts outnumbered the friendly toot-toots by at least nine to one.

What were they so mad at? The second sentence on my sign just said that we have to help each other. That seemed benign. I guess it was the first sentence that was the problem: *God is not coming to help us*. Even though the message was directly from God herself, and completely true, most of the people who passed through the intersection that day were not ready to hear it.

Standing in the intersection, getting stared at, honked at, and yelled at was stressful and embarrassing. When would someone I knew drive through the intersection and recognize me? 

After lunch, I experienced a new and much worse type of humiliation. At around 1:30 pm, seven hours into my “shift,” someone in a pickup screamed “burn in hell, atheist” and threw a paper soda cup at me. The supersized cup of coke hit me in the chest. It was half-full of ice and it *hurt* when it hit me. The soda splashed into my eyes and soaked my shirt.

The paper cup resting at my feet must have been a subliminal clue to the rest of the drivers that day. Ten more people threw drinks at me. I managed to dodge a few of them, but most of them hit me - more icy soda, a hot coffee, and an empty Sprite can.

When I returned to my apartment around midnight, I was thoroughly soaked, cold, and bruised. My apartment was dark and empty. Katie was not home. I peeled my wet clothes off and took a shower. The hot water warmed my skin, but inside, I felt colder than ever. Had Katie left for her “business trip” already? The trip that would last a few trillion years? I missed her already, just a few hours after I saw her last. How could I go on for the rest of my life without her? I wept.

There was a galaxy in my bedroom when I finally got out of the shower.

A beautiful, purplish-blueish spiral galaxy floated above my bed, slowly rotating around its center point. I approached and examined it closely. Clouds of stars looked like glowing wisps of smoke. I bent in even closer and saw beautifully colored nebula floating throughout like tiny blobs of watercolor. There was a post-it note on the bed.

*Great job at the intersection today. Keep going out there every day until you can’t anymore. I’m running an errand before my business trip. I’ll be back to see you one more time before I leave. I didn’t have cash to buy flowers, so here’s a galaxy instead.*

I slept under the galaxy and woke early the next morning. I put on a raincoat to protect myself from thrown drinks, grabbed the cardboard sign and headed back to the intersection.

The community of drivers in the city learns quickly. On only my second day at the intersection, I received my first thrown soda-cup at 9:30am. It seemed like everyone who saw me getting drenched as they drove through the intersection yesterday decided it would be fun to participate themselves today. The raincoat helped a little, but the volume of liquid thrown at me was much greater than yesterday, and I was soon soaked with diverse fluids.

The second day ended with me stumbling through the door of my dark, lonely apartment, showering, then falling asleep under the floating galaxy. I woke up early again and repeated the process. Again. And again. And again.

I became some kind of perverse institution in the downtown business district. Every few minutes someone would throw garbage or liquid on me as they drove by. Pedestrians shoved me as they walked across the road. I was spit on daily. Screamed at every few hours. “God helps those with faith!” “Godless atheist!” That sort of thing.  

Six weeks after I started holding Katie’s sign, someone in the back seat of black pickup casually lobbed a brick at me. The light had been green for a while, and the truck was moving through the intersection at about 45 miles per hour.  I only saw the brick for a moment. It was just a dark shape flying towards me. I had no time to react - the brick smashed into my face. The bridge of my nose was basically liquified. The bone of my eye-sockets shattered and my eyes were simultaneously smashed by the brick and sliced by the displaced shards of my skull.

I didn’t lose consciousness. Instead, I lay on the ground and screamed for help. I started choking on the blood pouring into my throat from my mutilated sinuses. I stopped screaming and just focused on breathing. Help did not come. I heard nothing but the traffic zipping past me for five or ten minutes. I must have looked just like a drunk passed out on the sidewalk - something nobody trying to get to work is going to want to deal with. I sat up and waved my arms for help - hoping somebody would notice my smashed face. This finally got someone’s attention. A car’s emergency brake engaged. Door opening. “Oh shit, pal. I got you. I just called 911. Hang in there. I got you.”

“My sign!” I choked on blood and was completely unintelligible. I tried again. “My sign! I need my sign. God gave it to me!” My samaritan put the piece of cardboard into my hands. “Brother, I don’t think that sign is doing you much good today.”

I was in the hospital for twenty days. Three surgeries. Nothing but bad news from the doctors. My eyes were irretrievably gone. My skull and sinuses would require a series of elaborate reconstructive surgeries just to restore normal breathing function. 

The police visited once. They were profoundly uninterested in my case. “You were out there every day, all day, holding a deliberately provocative sign. What did you expect?”

I checked myself out against doctors’ orders. The hospital was only a few blocks from “my” intersection. Now blind, finding my way, even just over three blocks, was a terrifying challenge. 

I somehow made it back to the pedestrian island without getting run over. I stood, wobbly but upright, and held the sign, now crusty from dried blood and whatever other thrown liquids it absorbed. I stayed there. It was my job. Katie told me to do it, so that’s what I did.

I didn’t try to return to my apartment - the idea of trying to get myself across town while blind was too much for me to contemplate. I slept on the pedestrian island. I begged for food when I heard pedestrians walk past. Sometimes someone would give me something - half a granola bar. The unfinished portion of a sandwich. A bottle of water.

I lost count of the days. It may have been three weeks or a month. The weather grew colder, and it rained a few times. One night, late, I finally managed to doze off. I was startled awake by something splashing on me. Not just a cup of soda or old coffee. Someone dumped a whole bucketful of liquid on me. 

My sense of smell was gone - another one of my senses completely destroyed by the brick. But even with no sense of  smell, I could taste the fumes from the liquid - gasoline.

A man’s voice said. “We don’t want to wait to see you burn in Hell, atheist. So we’re gonna burn you now!” I heard laughing, not just from the speaker but at least two other people with him.

Then I burned. The gasoline had soaked into every piece of clothing I wore. Into the dirty bandages that covered my eyes. Into Katie’s sign. *Engulfed*. That’s the word people use to describe something that is completely on fire. We throw it around casually. How often does a local news anchor use that word during a broadcast? Weekly? “Engulfed in flames.” It just rolls off the tongue.

Now it was my turn to be engulfed. I rolled desperately, and futility, to extinguish myself. There was too much fuel. Too much heat. Nothing helped. I heard nothing but the rush of air and hot gasses combining around me. I inhaled to scream and the flames entered my lungs. Panic. Pain. Terror. Sorrow that my life was ending. Pain. I rolled again, and fell off the curb into the street. The fuel was eventually consumed, and the roar of my own pyre diminished. I heard laughing. Then running away. 

A car stopped next to me. A woman screamed. Someone beat me with a piece of clothing or a blanket - I must have still been on fire. There was a woosh from a fire extinguisher. Yelling. Crying. Sirens. Then, finally, unconsciousness.

""Scott, I'm here."" Katie whispered in my ear. I reached for her and she took what was left of my hand. “You did what I asked. What I needed you to do. Nobody knows it yet, but you did what humankind needed you to do. You. You are a savior in the most literal sense.”

""The doctors think I'm dying. They don’t actually say it, but I know it’s what they mean. I lost six fingers."" I would have cried, if I still had tear ducts left. “My foot. Katie, they had to take it off last night. I’m probably going to lose the other one too.”

“You will be rewarded.”

“Do you mean - in, like heaven?”

“Did you ever make yourself a shopping list?”

“What? Like, for milk and eggs and stuff?”

“Yes. Think about it. Why do you write down a list of what you need before you go shopping?”

“Well, it’s because I can’t remember more than just a few things. So it’s to remind me what to buy at the store.”

“That list on the little piece of paper. It helps you remember what to get. It is *literally* a little bit of your memory that exists outside of your head. It’s still your thoughts, right, about what to buy? It’s just not inside your skull. It leaves your skull when you write it down, then it goes back in when you look at it again.”

“Yes Katie, I know how lists work.”

“Well, suppose someone else gets the list. Maybe you gave it to them, or you dropped it and they picked it up and read it, it means that some tiny part of your mind briefly exists in another person. It’s not your whole self, obviously, far from it. But it’s not nothing.”

“Instead of the shopping list, think of everything you put into the world over a lifetime. All the things you’ve ever said to everyone, the pictures you’ve put on the Internet, and your tax returns and so on. When people see these and think about you, they’re not just thinking *about* you. They are, in some small way, using their minds to think *for* you. Your *self* is spread out over everyone who has ever been affected by your life in some way.”

“That’s a nice idea.”

“It’s not just a nice idea Scott. It’s physics. The physics I created, by-the-way. I made the universe this way for a reason. “What you did for me - holding that sign at the intersection - put a profound idea into a few people’s minds. A part of you is now alive in them. And as I look out into the future I see the near-infinity of time in which humans will exist in some form. I can see them, Scott, countless quintillions of individuals who will come after you. And I see that little piece of you in all of them. The message is already spreading. There’s a guy standing in an intersection in Detroit with the same sign. Next week someone new will stand at your intersection.”

“I’m going to live on with my mind smeared across the future of humanity?”

“Yes. It won’t feel the same as being alive, like you are now. But it’s not oblivion either. And it will feel wonderful. And I will be there with you.”

The next day, Katie came back to the ICU with a laptop. “Tell me your story. Tell it the way you want it told. I’ll write it down for you and put it into the world.”

So I did. I narrated all of this to Katie, from my bed. It took days. Interrupted by surgeries, and long spells of incoherence from the painkillers. But Katie stayed with me the whole time.

“I’ll be here with you until the end of this phase of your existence. Then you’ll be part of the universe.”

“Then you’ll go on your business trip.”

“I will leave humanity for a long time. They’ll be okay though, because of you.”

*\[Scott died at 9:56 yesterday morning. I’m posting his story here. I hope you will read it and encourage others to do so. I am leaving you now. I will not be here to help you, so you have to help each other. - Katie\]*

1qozb84,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1qozb84/my_stomach_issues_are_ruining_my_senior_year_of/,My stomach issues are ruining my senior year of college.,"My stomach issues are ruining my senior year of college.

I have been dealing with stomach issues, diagnosed as IBS, for over 2 years now, since my sophomore year of college. Before I started suffering from IBS symptoms, my stomach wasn’t great either, as I experienced a lot of nausea and stomach aches. Throughout college, I have been on various SSRIs for depression and anxiety and tried different forms of birth control, two different pills, and a hormonal IUD, which I just recently had removed. I also had an intense caffeine addiction for years, drinking coffee almost every single day and constantly drinking energy drinks. 

Caffeine was the first thing that I noticed that really triggered my stomach. At first it was coffee, but I was dependent on caffeine that I switched to energy drinks or making my own chai lattees. Those then began to hurt my stomach, and I tried a couple different types of energy drinks, matcha, caffeinated soda, until eventually I had to stop completely. Whenever I would find something that worked and didn’t upset my stomach, eventually my stomach grew sensitive to it to the point where I couldn’t drink anything caffeinated. Being in college, not drinking any caffeine has been extremely difficult.

This past fall, my stomach issues got extremely worse, and I was genuinely scared and thought something was seriously wrong. One day, my stomach started feeling incredibly upset, I was bloated, felt nauseous, and overall felt like I had a very sour stomach. I ended up having to leave campus early and felt sick for several days. To be completely TMI, I was experiencing nothing but yellow, liquid diarrhea and gas, causing me to run to the bathroom nonstop. I had no control over it and was in a lot of pain. I went to urgent care, and they suspected that I had diverticulitis. They gave me an antibiotic for it, and told me to avoid popcorn and things with seeds. The antibiotic helped immensely, but it didn’t go away completely. For almost a month straight, all I ate was sourdough bread, chicken, rice, canned peaches, and applesauce, but I didn’t feel better.

When nothing got better, I called my cousin, who was a doctor, and she told me to go on the low-FODMAP diet. I also had a stool test and bloodwork done with my primary care doctor, and everything came up negative. I then saw a GI, who ordered a colonoscopy, another stool test, and a breath test for SIBO. Everything came up negative. I haven’t been able to work in any foods to my low FODMAP diet, because anytime I try anything that is moderate or high FODMAP, my stomach hurts, and I experience diarrhea. I also experience constipation, and I would say it goes back and forth. I also would say that I have about two weeks out of every month in which, no matter what I eat, my stomach is upset, due to my period and being pre-menstrual.

Before September, I would have normal bowel movements unless something triggered my IBS. I was pretty sure my triggers were gluten and caffeine, but I hadn’t really cut them out of my diet; I was just dealing with the symptoms. Now I can’t eat anything that isn’t low-FODMAP at all, and it has been months. I haven’t had a day with a single normal bowel movement since September.  I have said no to a lot of things this year because my stomach has hurt, I’ve been exhausted, or I just know I can’t eat or drink anything out with friends. I have had to stop taking my ADHD medication and go off of birth control to completely eliminate anything that could upset my stomach.

My doctors have not been able to find anything, and it is driving me crazy. I just want an answer so I can be a normal college student again, and I don’t have very long left. I have asked my GI to re-test me for SIBO, because for a while I was convinced that’s what it was, but she told me she wasn’t going to order another test. If anyone has any insight on what I should do, things I should try, please let me know. I want to try anything, but at the same time, I don’t want to self-treat with the wrong thing and make myself worse. 

If anyone has any insight, I would really appreciate it. I want to get my life back.",5,1769568851.0,ibs,5,1.0,False

Consequently, it is also my first ever fully finished story! Any constructive (and humorous) criticism is absolutely wanted and encouraged. I hope y'all enjoy it! Annoyingly, it's too long to be posted all at once, so I'm posting the first half here and the second half later!

**The Sheriff, The Indian, and The Devil Pt. 1**

The man groggily sat in the ice. The wet snow crunched under his gruff and scar etched hands. His blood-soaked mouth opened and closed with each deep breath. His black eyes opened towards the endless sky. Not a cloud. No birds. Nothing to aid his lonesome existence on that mountain. The tattered clothes upon his chest blew and flapped in the gusts that passed over him. Sharp needles of ice clung along his brow, and he shivered, for there was no warmth there. No life around or in him. 

Among him lay all the starved and dead of his posse. Blood painted the canvas that was the snow mountain, creating a garish artwork no being could stomach. Either mortal or other. The log cabin that had been their Elysium from the endless cold now lay barren and smoking. Wood charred. 

There was a woman there from before. Dying of starvation and whatever pestilence came upon this misery-stricken venture. The man wondered what became of her. Lying still and quiet in the housefire. She was pregnant, if he remembered right: almost at the point of the due date. Had she lived long enough to see the baby out? Or had it died within her when her own soul was released from this place? Her body lay there as the flames engulfed the cabin. Lying there with her soft and peaceful expression as her skin began to melt in the flame and the heat of the hellfire that was coming. The baby cooked in a soup of her embryonic fluid as it boiled and turned over within her.

But he knew it lived. And he had heard it scream from the house as it carried its mother off from this place. What became of it? Who would it become? How could this creature, which was so dependent upon the bosom of the thing that had given it life, no longer having life itself, live? It didn’t. He knew it didn’t. But what did he know?  Where was George?

Look at him. The man. Kneeling deep in viscera and gore. Living off it. He finds a body near him. It’s a man. He grips the ankle. He feels his nails begin to grow longer, and it is painful. His teeth grow longer and wilder, and his eyes begin to bulge out of his head. His bones begin to crack, and his skin breaks across his back as he becomes taller. He’s growing taller and taller. His arms are reaching his knees, and he is a giant. A Nephilim. The sons of God and the daughters of man. What unholy abomination is this? His clothes rip, and he lets out a shriek foreign to any human being. But he is. He is still a man. He knows. He has the memories, though they become more and more foggy. 

Where’s George? George can fix this. He can fix him.

He tears flesh away from the ankle, revealing the Achilles tendon. Blood seeps further into the snow. Drools of paint. The man stuffs the flesh and the meat from the dead thing into his mouth. It tastes horrendous, but he is starving. He is insatiable like he never was before. And he is cold. He shivers, but as the flesh travels down into his stomach, he feels a momentary warmth. He needs more warmth. He needs more flesh. 

He grabs more of the man's leg and rips off more flesh. It tastes horrible, but it gives warmth, and it gives momentary satiation from starvation. He travels up the man, taking chunks of viscera. First from the leg, then from the back, he travels up and up the body of this thing that lies dead at his feet. And as he reaches the face, he makes contact with the eyes of the dead thing. The eyes of an old man. He studies the rest of the face. And before he realizes, his eyes are full of tears, and he is weeping. He, the creature, is weeping and stumbling away. And as he stumbles, she trips over more. More women, more men. More people he once knew, but now they are all dead things. Like a bird. Like a deer. Nothing more. 

He stumbles into a lake of ice. An endless mass of vast and frozen water. Unending before him and behind him, the remnants of his last hope. The creature falls to his knees and begins to wail. Wail for God. Wail for something, anything to grant him freedom from this place. And in between his incessant sobs, he hears another cry. Another one far away yet close to his own sorrow. It is the cry of a child. 

January 16th, 1888

I ain’t too sure what the town’s to do about this durn predicament we’ve found ourselves in. Mrs. Mary Tillit. Mauled to death in her own home.

Said that the paper boy found her in the morning. The door to her lil home blown way open, and the ol boy, I think only thirteen, found the woman face down in her bed. Said it stunk in a real bad way. Lady looked like she was sleeping, though. He said he called her name a few times, and she didn’t respond. Thought about lifting the covers, but he didn’t want confirmation to his nightmare, so he ran. Smart boy, really. 

Once I got there, the whole town was in a big commotion. People all crowding around the place. Found a straggler in the house, too, and he booked it real quick when he saw me coming. Found Doctor Pello in the room with the woman, examining her. She was in real bad shape. Didn’t even think I could stomach it. The thing, whatever it was, had opened up her whole chest cavity. Blood soaked the sheet, and her ribs had been cracked and broken as the thing pried her chest open. She had an intestine hanging limply off the bed, and her organs were all cut. Doc didn’t know what to make of it. Neither did I. Just sat looking at her. Doctor said her entire heart had been ripped out.

 I think the last time I had seen her alive was at church that Sunday. Charming girl. Young. Whole life ahead. She was married, too. James Tillit is her husband’s name. He’s gone now on a business trip. Word is that he gets back tomorrow. I don't quite know how I’m to explain the situation to him.

Who did that to her? What in God’s name killed that girl? No wolf could’ve done that. I can’t think of what did. I’m not sure I want to. God help us. 

January 17th, 

Met James today. One of my deputies gave me word on where he was, and I rode out to meet his stagecoach. Gave him the news. Boy didn’t believe it. I’m not sure I can either. I brought him back to the station. Filled him in on everything that we know. The little of it there is. He informed us about some of her personal life. Apparently, she was pregnant.

We asked James if he knew what could’ve done it. Who could've done it? He didn’t know. I said it was all alright, and well, we took him down to Pello’s to see the body. We showed it to ‘em on the cold table. Ol boy looked like he’d seen a ghost. I had to catch him from falling over. Can’t blame him none. Left him there to talk with Pello and get burial things ready. 

Fore I left, I did pull the Doc over to have a chat. I’d asked him if he had any evidence for the girl to have been pregnant, and he had told me that he did. And that the baby was missing. Seemingly taken when poor girl was killed. 

Tillit came down to my house tonight. Knocked on the door, and before I could answer, he barged in. 

“Sir,” He said, “I have felt the deepest parts of sorrow and grief beyond any comparison.” He sat on the seat near the fire. “My dearest Mary has been ravaged by someone, and that man has disappeared. Seemingly gone with the wind and the waves of the ocean. I beg you, Sheriff, when you find the devil that did this. Let me carry out the vengeance of the Lord on him. Let me look him in the eyes as I put a bullet in between.”

He gazed at the fire, and the flickering flames reflected in his irises. It was as if his anger was embodied within him, along with a sorrow as deep and dark as the ocean depths. 

“Boy, the law will be carried out how the law is always carried out. I understand your sentiment, son, but I’m afraid I can’t let this play out. We will do what we must, but when the time comes for justice to be given, it shall be given by accordance with the law.”

He silently nodded and stared at the fire. 

We sat in my living room for a while. I went and boiled a pot and poured us both a cup of coffee. It was a long night. The only conversation between us a shared silence and an understanding glance. 

January 18th, 

I have begun to put together a hunting party. I contacted Ahanu. He’s on the way and hopefully can reach for us a good way to find the man. I am greatly indebted to Ahanu. Since he was a young boy, I have been indebted to him. 

I’ve gotten the inclination that James is going to be joining this party. I am urging him not to for fear that his emotions at this stage may just get the better of him. He’s a welcome addition if he so desires, but I must try to deter him. 

After investigations about the house, we have found some evidence as to the creature that committed this heinous act. Firstly, on closer inspection to the front door, we found some strange markings along the door frame. Claw marks of some kind. We can’t distinguish what manner of claws did that. No identifiable creature has those claw marks. Next, there was, along the floor, a path of mud. This trailed from the front door through the house, seemingly seeking for the girl. It bolted awkwardly and without form through the living room and through the kitchen. Looping on itself, lankily stumbling about. Strangely, the mud trail ended extremely suddenly at the eastern wall of the girl’s home. It seemed as though the thing simply vanished and entered into the wall. Now I wasn’t too sure, but after staring at that blank and empty wall, I noticed three small etchings in it. I studied it closely and noticed a trail reaching higher and higher. The trail of these marks followed along the wall and rose into the ceiling. These etchings entered Mrs. Tillit’s room and ended right above her bed. It was hard for us to notice initially, but those brown and bloodstained sheets were darkened not just by blood but bits of mud and solidified clay too. The thing climbed along the ceiling and dropped right on Mrs. Tillit when it attacked her. I ain’t too sure what to make of this thing. I don’t think it’s a man. But I’m scared to think of what it really is. 

No evidence has come about concerning witnesses or anything. We have tried receiving accounts of Mrs. Tillitt’s behavior the week before the murder, but so far, out of everyone around her, nothing was strange. The only note we’ve been given is from the drunk in the town square. Earl Edward. I’ve had many run-ins with him before. From the numerous bar fights the man has gotten himself into, to that time he drunkenly stole the local pastor’s horse and hightailed it for Cheyenne. We found him lying by a creek about 13 miles in the opposite direction from where he was trying to go. Fell off the horse in a drunken stupor. His poor old father goes for his bail each time. 

Anyway, Edward noted that he saw a tall and elongated man creaking around in the shadows around the girl's home. Said the thing dipped deep into a lumber pile. Now, under normal circumstances, I woulda told Edward that he was seeing things and that he was drunk, but after the brutality of the girl, I really don’t know what to believe. Earl said that when he saw the thing hide, he tried getting closer to investigate the lumber pile. Mary Tillit found him sneaking about and yelled at him for being a creep and threatened to call for me. In trying to explain himself, she yelled at him for being a drunk and threw him out of her place. That was the most believable part of his story. 

January 19th, 

Ahanu’s here. Much older than the last time I’ve met him. He’s grown a strong goatee and his frame is filled out. He has the strength of his ancestors within his arms and the will of the Bison within his soul. He’s very tall and his hair has been pulled back in a pony tail. A revolver and a silver knife hangs at his hip and a bow is strung across his chest. His worn shirt is missing a few buttons at the top and his arms are etched with scars from his youth and an impressive warband decorates his bicep. His dark complexion hides his eyes in a most peculiar way like he is in a state of perpetual brooding but when he speaks he speaks of his family at home and how things are faring with his people and the reservation. His voice carries a kind note and he expresses love and care for his people through his inflections and his smallest mannerisms. I really have missed this boy. 

I’ve informed him of all we know. The little there is. I’ve asked him for advice and what to do. I’ve also been in contact with Reverend Vanderbilt. He’s been with James Tillit the past few days. Tillit has been drinking himself under. Way under. I’m planning to meet him in a few days to inform him of any advances we’ve made in understanding what has happened to his wife. 

January 20th, 

God, what manner of thing is this?

Last night a child was attacked. It was the Stephens' boy. A five year old. He was found in the morning face down near the stream on his family’s ranch property. His body was mangled and destroyed. I cannot bring myself to describe the specifics of this horror. His mother is manic. I have no earthly idea what to do.

Ahanu inspected the area around the boy and he has found tracks that lead out into the woods near the edge of our little town. I asked him what type of tracks it was and he could not be certain. Said it seemed like an enlarged human foot. Longer and wider than possible. Deep claws in the mud. 

That afternoon Ahanu, a boy named Sean who was one of my deputies, and I, made a venture into the woods to try to find this thing’s quarters. When we reached the outskirts of the woods, right where the trees began, I had the feeling as if I had just stumbled through the Gates of Hell. Ahanu on my right held a double-barreled shotgun as we weaved our way through the branches and the leaves. I kept my hand near my holster. The crunch of fallen branches and leaves the only sound made in that place. Ahanu stooped down every now and then to regain the path of the trail and we slowly made our way deeper and deeper still into those woods.

Now and again an owl would coo above us, sending us spinning and turning checking every angle we could. But still, we had found nothing. We were met with a stream and we refilled our flasks. With darkness descending on the forest we agreed to cut this adventure short and to mark this stream as the furthest we’d been. I dug a hole near the stream and Ahanu set a treefallen log into it and etched out a deep P with a knife that hung off his belt. And with that we began our trip back.

Darkness came fast on us and Sean pulled his oil lamp out of his satchel that he carried with him to illuminate our path. Our breathing became heavier and the leaves continued to crunch under our feet. Our souls were pressed by a heaviness from the surrounding wood and in an attempt to lighten our hearts Sean began to tell stories.

“...then the old man stood up and looked me in the eye and with the beer keg in his hand he gave me the good one, two and I fell across the bar. Of course he didn’t see what was coming next fore I had, beforehand thinking this exact situation to occur, hidden a shovel underneath my bar stool. I had fallen right where I had needed to and ‘fore the old man even saw it coming I grabbed that shovel by the handle and bringing it up, slammed the dull side of it right against his temple. He went down without a word and spilled his beer all over ‘im! Of course the police did not take too kindly to this situation, and I was hauled off to the clink real quick. Well a while after that, a young girl I had taken very kindly to, and was quite sweet on, came down and took my bail for me. In her sweet, simple mind, she thought I’d ride off into the sunset with her and live out the rest of my life in dull sincerity. She begged me to go home with her. I obliged but only for a time and then that evening I wound myself into that same bar meeting with another girl entirely. And then…” 

Ahanu stopped. 

“...ended up drunkenly stumbling into the confessional and I was met by a kind priest who-”

“Shut your boy up.” Ahanu hissed to me as he quickly strided over to a tree and crouched beneath it. “Pass the lantern.” 

Sean quickly handed to him and Ahanu raised the light above his head as he peered into the darkness beyond. Holding the shotgun with one armed pointed toward the sound. 

“What is it?” I asked, leaning closer with my hand ready to draw my revolver. Ahanu simply gave me a warning look signaling me to silence. For a moment we were all quiet. Then I heard it. Deep in the wood we heard the slight crunch of leaves. It sounded like it was just out of our light, lingering at the edge of our sight. Ahanu stared deeper in, his eyes unblinking. 

“We move now.” He said and he began to walk slowly in the direction of the town. Sean and I followed suit quietly and we began slowly taking our steps. Ahanu led our way, carefully placing each step in between leaves and fallen branches. We made our way further and further. 

I’d like to think I didn’t hear it, but I did. With each step we took to our right I heard a crunch of leaves. It started with just a step. One step for every ten that we took. Then it shortened its pace. It got quicker. And it got quicker. The crunching came closer and closer and it was running towards us. It was running and it was fast. And it was angry. It was almost in our sight. Almost grabbing one of us. Grabbing us and tearing us apart. Blood and bone. Then I saw nothing. 

Ahanu blew out the lantern. I heard Sean crying behind me and from close to my right, I heard it. The slow and heavy breathing of the thing. The monster. It was tall. And I felt it next to me. In a second, I grabbed my revolver and slowly raised it towards where I heard the breathing of it. I raised my hand and I put my finger on the trigger. 

A gunshot. But it wasn’t mine. From further in the forest I saw the muzzle flash from Ahanu’s double barrel as he fired towards the thing. In the flash I saw it for a moment that passed like lightning. It was a man. A tall, lanky man. He was easily over Eight feet-tall and his arms were so long that they reached his knees. His skin was as ash, pale and dry. Then the light dissipated and I could see nothing else.

When the muzzle flash dimmed, I heard the creature scream in a voice that sounded like a man but had become much deeper and distorted. Then I heard Sean. His scream was so loud it still reverberates in my mind now. I heard his scream disappear further and further into the forest as the thing carried him away. I heard leaves crunching and I even saw a tree in the distance fall as the thing ran over it. 

Ahanu and I ran. We ran until my chest hurt as I gasped for breath and it hurt as we ran into town, and it hurt as we stumbled into my house and began to fortify the windows and any entrance. My chest still hurt when I had finally fallen to the floorboards and exhaustion overtook me. 

January 22nd, 

A couple days have passed now. After Ahanu and I woke on the floor boards. We took account of what had all happened. Sean was gone and we needed to find him. The creature was still far off in the forest and we both knew that he would return to the town soon. Ahanu especially seemed rattled. He was much quieter than usual and stared blankly at the fire while sitting on the couch and thought over things.

I got in with the mayor real quick and advocated for a message for the governor and possibly the President to hunt this thing down. He agreed and began to doctor up a correspondence for the governor. I was with him to write it down and I relayed all that I have previously written here. We sent it to the governor with haste. And now we are waiting for a response. 

Ahanu came to me this morning and informed me that he was departing back to the reservation to tell the chiefs what we had encountered. I think the boy knows much more than he lets on. He has become much more quiet as of late and has taken a much more serious approach to everything. He has told me he will return with a band on the 24th. From there we will begin our search party and hopefully find Sean and kill the monster in these woods. 

January 23rd, 

Response came in from the governor, and by God, I can’t believe it. He didn’t believe us. Told us that what we were dealin’ with wasn't a concern to him, and that is most likely a simple wolf. That fool. Of course, he’s a fool. We ain’t getting no help from the Capitol or D.C.  The best I can hope is that Ahanu makes a strong plea to the chiefs and that they are willing to help. 

James ran off. 

Idiot boy. 

Rev. Vanderbilt came into the jail all exasperated and breathing hard, and stammering his words. “Tillit, the boy, oh God.” 

I ran over to him, “Spit it out, man!”

“The boy came to me in confession; he sat down and said, ‘Father, my soul is weary on me.’ I asked him to explain and told him that our Father gives grace to all, but he simply stated, ‘I’m riding to Hell to take the thing that stole my Heaven.’ I stammered for a bit not knowing what to say and that’s when I noticed him fiddling with something near his belt. He had a revolver with him sheriff. I asked what he was doing and he said very monotonously, ‘Bless my hand father, pray that my aim is true.’ With that he flew out of the confessional and made his way along our stone steps. Spurs clang and reverberated around our walls as he walked off into his abyss. I dread that he has gone into the forest alone.”

I am now on a path into the woods, me and my mare. We have stopped along that stream that we had previously discovered and I have decided to set camp here. I left a note on both the door to my house and to the jailhouse for Ahanu when he should arrive tomorrow. He is a determined boy and I believe he and his group, should he have one, shall arrive here early in the morning. 

I am nervous staying in these woods by my lonesome. Every creak and crack of a branch sets me on a nerve. My mind is playing tricks on me and everytime I look out into those woods I feel just out of my firelight I can see the frame of a tall and dangerous thing. 

January 24th, 

Nightmares visited me last night. Horrible dreams which I must write down. 

I dreamt that I was on a hill, overlooking a vast landscape of trees and mountains. A whippoorwill called below and the breeze was fresh and cool. It was a splendid place. Afar, I heard a man speaking, he spoke of good things, lovely things. He taught love. Men and women and children gathered around him to listen. I was at peace here. 

This scene faded and we were suddenly traversing a broad and endless desert. The man walked ahead of me and with us were a band of men and women. Following this man. The desert’s wind was strong and dust whipped our face and the sun sat on the ridge of the land looking like a bowl of blood. We walked still.

This scene faded as well and I was sitting at a great and long table. The man was speaking of things beyond my comprehension. A bowl of blood sat there and I dipped the flesh into it. Sloshing it about and I took a bite and it tasted wonderful. Of honey and grapes. Of coffee and cigars.

Once the flesh hit my mouth I was yet again transported to another place. This time it seemed to be a forest. A grand and beautiful forest. In front of me the man stood, looking at me. He had blood about his brow and his eyes had a great sorrow within them. I walked towards him. And I got closer and closer to his face. I felt his breath on my cheeks. And leaning in, I kissed the man on the cheek. 

The next scene brought me to a dark cabin. A shadowy room lit only by the fire which crackled in the corner. The man was there. In the middle of the place. He sat in a wood chair and his hands were tied behind his back with rope. His face was laid down and I could tell he was badly beaten, blood drooled from his face into the floor boards. I called to him but I don’t know what I said. And he looked up to me, and he was in pain and he was crying and his face was bloodsoaked. He said something to me. “...finished.” And with that I raised my arm, leveled the revolver in between his eyes, and I fired. 

I woke in a cold sweat and shivered. I felt tears running down my cheeks and wiped my hand across them. I heard a deep growl around my tent, and I shot up, grabbing my revolver with it raised. I swung out of the tent. This was met by the sound of broken branches and splintered wood.  I saw the rustling of trees still swaying from something running away. Seeing nothing but the dying light of the embers from the fire, I sat down again. In my side eye, I saw the beady eyes of my horse blankly staring at me, blood drooling from its mouth. I dared not turn my head towards it. I knew it was dead. I lie awake the rest of the night with my revolver to my side. The winds in the leaves awaken me and keep me invigorated and wide awake. 

Once the sun rose, I left the tent. My horse laid dead beside me. Her eyes had a pleading look in them, as if she was still asking for saving. Her insides had been ripped open, and her entrails lay beside her, staining the ground with a deep red color. Blood ran down her lips like she had taken a bite out of a forbidden fruit. Why the thing had not taken me, I have no clue. None at all. 

I undid the saddle from her back and took all my wares. Took my Winchester 1873 from the saddle holster and took my saddle bag away. The fire still smoldered, and the smoke rose into the sky. I dipped near the stream to refill my flask, and I took account of my ammunition, lasting food, and matches for the cigarettes. Undid my tent and set up camp further down the stream, away from my dead horse. I have set bacon strips on the fire and corn along with it. I have also begun to brew coffee. Later, I will head back to the camp to meet Ahanu.

He’s here. I saw him looking about the previous campsite. I think Ahanu was about to set out to search for me. Evidently, the dead horse was a concern.

“You don’t need to worry, I’m just fine.”

They rode up to me. Ahanu dropped down from his horse and shook my hand, asking what had happened the night before. I told him I was woken by a noise outside and that I had seen trees rustling in the distance, and of course, the dead horse, but I did leave out the dreams. I don’t know: don’t think there’s much stock in them. 

We set up pretty quickly. Can’t waste much time trying to find James Tillit. We began to head for the mountains in the north. That’s where Ahanu found a trail, and we began to follow it. We desperately tracked each broken twig or scratched tree or pressed grass blade. We followed it all, leading us further and further into those hills. 

It was along this trail that we found Sean. Oh dear Lord. We found him alright. What was left of him. All strung up in a tree. Branches impaling his body and keeping him up there. His body had been opened, and his intestines were hanging from the cavity of his stomach. Blood dripped down onto the ground, forming a pool near the tree’s roots. Like he was watering the thing with his own blood. We stared at it. Unable to comprehend what I was seeing. It was like seeing a person condemned to hanging who was set out of a town to ward off any unwanted behavior from anybody. Maybe that’s exactly what it was, a “Do Not Follow” warning. I ain’t sure. 

We pulled Sean down. I set him lying in a flower patch we had passed earlier. Told him that I’ll catch the thing that did this to him  and that once we returned, we’d give him a proper burial. Ahanu stayed behind and sort of let me have a moment with the boy. I think he was only twenty  or so. Poor boy. We continued on. 

That evening, we found a hermit living in a cabin. I went along with Ahanu to ask the man if we could lodge near there and if he had any extra things to spare for us. What came out was an elderly man, he had a full white beard, and he answered with a shotgun pointed right at me with both barrels staring at me like sinister eyes. 

“You can put that down, friend, we ain’t here to hurt ya none.”

“I don’t like the Indian ya brought.” 

“I’m sure the feeling is mutual.”

“What is a white man like you doing coalescing with him?”

“These are my friends, and we’re out here on business regarding some homicides recently.”

“I don’t care for none of your town’s lil murderers. Especially if you’re using some dim-witted Indians to take care of affairs. I bet they don’t even understand what the likes of me and you are saying.” 

“Watch your mouth, Old Man, before I shove a pig down your throat,” Ahanu said quietly. 

The Old Man’s anger spiked, and he raised the shotgun at him. I grabbed the barrels with my hands and swiftly moved the shotgun towards the air. “We are quite sure that what we are dealing with is not something that any of us has seen before. The murderer ain’t a man, I think it is much more proper to call the thing a demon. We think it’s in these woods, and if you want to live, you’ll do anything you can to help us.” 

The Old Man’s eyes darkened, and his head lowered. “You mean there’s something out here?”

“I do. And I believe it eats the flesh of human beings.”

The Old Man turned and walked into the house, “Ya’ll can come in,” he said with a low tone, barely audible, “Just don’t mess with anything.”

What we were met by when we walked through those doors was a house entirely boarded up. The windows had slight slits in between the planks of wood, and in front of each window was a rifle set on a tripod staring out into the woods. 

The Old Man started a fire and sat on a chair, looking down into a pot of coffee that steamed from the mug. The vapors rising and disappearing into the air. He had set the shotgun right on the table. He stared blankly into it. 

“Thank you, sir,” Ahanu said as he walked in. 

That night, we set up camp outside the hermit’s cabin. We began a fire, and The Old Man, Ahanu, and I sat in each other's company. The Old Man was still quiet but becoming more welcoming to my friend.

“You know what we are hunting? Your disposition changed greatly when it was discussed.” Ahanu said.

“No, I’m sure I don’t,” The Old Man mumbled, “It’s that…” he swallowed hard, “My wife, Beth, wandered into the woods last night. Deep in the midnight. I don’t know why. But she hasn’t come back. I was about to head out and search for her when ya’ll came up. Did ya’ll meet any woman on your trip?”

“No, sir, can’t say we did,” Ahanu responded. 

The Old Man simply nodded his head. 

“Did she say anything before she left?”

The Old Man looked deep into the fire and thought for a moment, “I think she said something about dreaming a little. Something calling to her from deep in the woods, I think. Telling her to come and see, to meet him deep in there. That he’d show her the wonders of the world.”

I wondered if this correlated with my own dream from the night before.

“Ya’ll said that you’re hunting something out here?”

I nodded.

“You know what it is?”

I looked to Ahanu, who cleared his throat, “My father used to tell me stories. Stories of evil spirits and things that lie beyond what any of us can see. But there was one that was told to me. One I never forgot. He told a story of a creature of insatiable hunger. Something that could eat and eat and never be satisfied. It ravaged whole flocks and occasionally would come upon one of our villages. It ate humans without a care for their souls. We consulted shamans to banish it, but even they could not. We haven’t heard of one showing anywhere recently. But now, I suppose that has changed.” 

The Old Man shuddered, “So, my dear, Beth? Likely eaten by the thing?” 

None of us spoke—simply a solemn understanding between us. 

Then Ahanu began to speak. “My father told me another story once. There was a traveller. He was looking for gold. I think he was headed to California. He was an Indian: an Indian along the Mexican border. It was right after the whole war between America and Mexico. That was a dangerous time for Indians. Whole bands of white men slaughtered tribes simply to take their scalps. I think those tribes were warring with Mexico then and Mexico didn’t like it so they hired mercenaries. Any scalp brought would be bought by the Mexican government for a good price. The government didn’t realize, however, that Mexican scalps look almost identical to Indian ones. The government was buying the murdered scalps of their own citizens! HAH!

The man, the Indian man, was travelling along a road. He wore the clothes of whites and he did not speak a word to anyone that he met. As he was traveling down a road he met a man. The man was white but his eyes were grey. He sat in between two raised mounds of dirt. He asked the Indian if he could travel with him. The Indian did not respond. The Blind Man simply smiled, he smiled and said, ‘I know where you go son. You search for gold and for riches far west. Most men are. I was headed that way too. Till I was blinded.’ 

‘You were blinded?” The Indian asked.

‘I was. I was traveling down this road, down towards Mexico. Me and a few of my sons were on the way. But, as I approached the town during the night, the sun rose. It rose so high and it was so bright. It was as if it was hovering right above me. I had to shield my eyes from it, but it didn’t work. All was white. I called out for my boys. I heard one of them yell: yell like they were far away. There was also a noise. Like a train horn. A loud thundering train horn that broke the mountains in two and caused oceans to split. It became louder and louder. It deafened me and I began to scream. And all at once it stopped. All I heard was my own voice screaming. I was sobbing. I called for my sons but they didn’t answer. I couldn’t see anything. I fell on the ground and began to crawl and to reach for anything. As my hand felt along the sandy ground I felt something. Something leathery. My fingers traveled along this leathery thing and then felt something else. Something scratchy. It was a pant leg. The leg was stiff and I knew it was my son’s. I went along the ground further and felt the face of my other son. I felt his eyes. His cold eyes. His flesh was cold. I knew they were dead. Now I have buried both of them. Both of these here.’ He motioned towards the two mounds of dirt. ‘And I have waited for someone to arrive.’

The Indian looked at him, and feeling sympathy, said he could join on the journey. As they traveled they faced many hardships. The Indian was thrown in jail for a time and the Blind Man sat, patiently waiting, outside the jailhouse. There were blizzards and hot and muggy days. But they reached California eventually. They found up North a great forest. Streams of wonderful water and great and giant trees. The ocean’s waves beat against the boulders and the Blind Man cried as if it was a great piece of music. The Indian breathed. Taking in the smell of the great ocean and the trees. 

They set up camp along the shore. A fire burned and the Blind Man and the Indian sang and danced to tunes of their fathers and their fathers before them. They went to bed in their tents. And in the morning, the Indian, still a little drunk, called out to the Blind Man. But, there was no answer. He walked out of the tent and stared at what lay on the shore. The Blind Man floating softly in the ocean. His eyes staring into the sky. His bright blue eyes staring into the sun. And he was dead.”

I refrained from telling them my dreams. 

As we sat and thought about the story that Ahanu told us we heard a rustling of leaves to our right. I stood with my revolver ready, and Ahanu did the same with his bow. The Old Man just sat, staring at the fire. 

“Who’s out there?” Ahanu called into the darkness. This sound was responded to by an exasperated groan. It sounded like something was dragging itself along the ground and through all the leaves. We heard a breath. The breath was long and made with great difficulty. As it came closer and closer to the light, we saw that it was an elderly woman. Her right arm was missing and was spitting out blood from the artery that was revealed and with her left arm she drug herself slowly along the ground. The sounds of sticks and leaves scratching along her stomach. Ahanu and I ran quickly to her and got a full scope of her condition. She wasn’t going to live. 

“Get water!” Ahanu yelled out, but the Old Man did not respond. The woman’s breathing was sporadic and difficult. I looked over to the man to see if he would respond to his wife’s condition. But he didn’t. Just sat there, staring at the fire. 

Ahanu dipped and grabbed the woman and held her in his arms. He turned her over, and we saw that she had been disemboweled. Pieces of her hung out and were covered in dirt. She coughed up blood and sighed deeply. She took a breath. And she spoke.

“It…it talked to me.”

With that, her eyes faded, and I knew that she was travelling closer and closer to the light.

We set her in the garden patch outside of their house. Her husband sat by the fire. He was there when we went to our tents, and in the morning, he was not at the house or at the fire. Ahanu, however, found a trail leading into the woods. ",1,1769568626.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

I’ve been in Iceland for some time now, working full time, but I feel like it’s time for a change. I’m starting to worry that I might be heading toward burnout.

For most of my life, I’ve worked as a barista. I’m very passionate about coffee and I genuinely love preparing it, but slowly it’s starting to feel like enough is enough.

Since my other big passion is travelling, I started wondering if I could move in that direction professionally. Of course, I love travelling myself, but sometimes I enjoy the backstage and the logistics even more.

So here I am, asking you lovely Icelanders if you have any suggestions on where I could look for jobs that would let me spread my wings in that field. I know we’re currently in a very, very low tourism season, and I’m willing to wait until the time is right, I just don’t really know where to look or which places are worth checking out, especially since Alfred offers close to nothing.

I’m not really looking for a job in excursions, since I don’t have my licence yet (hopefully that will change before the next season), and I’m probably not experienced enough to be a guide. I’ve also heard that even without experience, but with enough passion, it’s possible to become something like a private guide. If anyone has more details about that, I’d really appreciate it.

So basically, if you have *any* information, even a tiny bit, that you’d be willing to share, please comment. Takk!",1,1769568585.0,AskAnIcelander,0,1.0,False

We got coffee and food together.

While we were hanging out, her energy felt different than usual. She was leaning closer to me the whole time and her body was turned toward me, she put her foot on the stool I was sitting on and put her foot right next to mine, and while we were eating she rested her head on my shoulder.

Same routine every morning — check recovery, look at HRV, close the app. I ride XC mountain bike and road, train on Zwift, drink way too much coffee. I always felt like the data should be telling me more than ""green good, red bad.

I work in AI, so I built a skill in Clawdbot that runs actual statistics on my WHOOP data — correlations, baselines, pattern detection across 60+ days. Here's what I found:

**My Monday recovery is consistently \~8% lower — and it's not what I thought.**

I assumed it was training load from weekend rides. Nope. My Sunday night sleep is just worse. I go to bed later, sleep lighter, wake more. It's a rhythm thing. I moved my rest day to Monday and stopped wondering why I felt flat to start the week.

**My sleep deficit is way worse than I realized.**

`Sleep: You typically need 9.4h, get about 6.7h, with 93% efficiency on average.`

A 2.7 hour gap. Every night. Seeing that calculated against my own baseline — not generic ""adults need 7-9 hours"" advice — hit different. I've pushed to \~7.5h by moving my wind-down earlier. Recovery average went up.

**High strain suppresses my HRV the next morning — but only above \~15.**

Below that, no meaningful dip. Above it, measurable. The app shows yesterday's strain and today's HRV as separate numbers. It never connects them for your specific body. Now when I see a lower recovery after a big ride, I know it's expected — not a trend.

**The actual shift:**

To be honest, I stopped opening the app every morning because the agent checks my WHOOP automatically and only tells me when something actually matters. Most days: silence. That IS the update. When it speaks up, I trust it because it's backed by my own data.

Anyone else done deep analysis on their data? Curious what patterns others have found.",24,1769568304.0,whoop,8,0.93,False

I’m a 19-year-old currently living in the USA, but I’m originally from Italy. Moving across the world has been quite the adventure (and a bit of a culture shock, honestly), so I’m looking to expand my social circle and find some people my age to talk to.

I’m hoping to find some long-term friends who are also around 19. I find it a lot easier to keep up with people on Instagram rather than Reddit, as I’m much more active there and love sharing photos of my travels, daily life, and the occasional cooking attempt.

A bit about me:

• The Big Move: I can definitely talk your ear off about the differences between Italian and American life (especially the coffee and the food—don't get me started on the pizza here!).

• Interests: I love photography

• The Vibe: I’m a mix of laid-back and ambitious. I love a good deep conversation, but I’m also down to just send memes back and forth.

If you’re around my age and want to connect, please send me a DM! Tell me a little bit about yourself and drop your Instagram handle so I can add you.

1qoz2a5,https://www.reddit.com/r/ConnectBetter/comments/1qoz2a5/the_real_secret_to_being_attractive_the/,The REAL Secret to Being ATTRACTIVE: The Psychology That Actually Works,"I spent months going down this rabbit hole after noticing something wild: some people just seem magnetic. Not the hottest, richest, or most successful people. Just… magnetically attractive in a way that makes you want to be around them.

So I dug deep. Read psychology research, binged social dynamics content, listened to experts break down charisma. And honestly? Most of what we think makes us attractive is completely backwards.

Here's what actually works, backed by actual science and observation, not the recycled advice everyone parrots.

**Stop trying to be interesting and start being interested.** This sounds like greeting card bullshit until you understand the psychology. Humans are wired for validation. When someone genuinely listens, asks follow up questions, remembers details from past conversations, it triggers a dopamine response. Dr. Arthur Aron's research on interpersonal closeness found that reciprocal self disclosure combined with genuine curiosity creates rapid bonding. But here's the key: you can't fake this. People can smell disingenuous interest from a mile away. The trick is finding something genuinely fascinating about every person you meet, even if it takes digging. Everyone has a story, a weird hobby, a unique perspective. Your job isn't to be the most entertaining person in the room. It's to make others feel heard.

**Master the art of being comfortably uncomfortable.** Attractive people don't avoid awkwardness, they lean into it with humor and self awareness. Social psychologist Brené Brown talks about this in her vulnerability research, how admitting mistakes, laughing at yourself, showing you're human actually increases likability. When you spill coffee on yourself and make a joke instead of getting flustered, when you admit you have no idea what someone's talking about instead of nodding along, you signal confidence. Real confidence isn't never fucking up. It's being unbothered when you do. This is counterintuitive because we think we need to appear perfect, but perfection is cold and unapproachable.

**Develop genuine competence in something, anything.** Not to show off, but because passion is contagious. Could be woodworking, could be knowing every detail about true crime, could be making killer pasta from scratch. When someone talks about their thing with genuine enthusiasm, it's magnetic. Cal Newport's book ""So Good They Can't Ignore You"" destroys the whole follow your passion myth, but here's what he gets right: developing rare and valuable skills makes you more interesting and confident. And that confidence bleeds into everything else. People pick up on it. The key is you're not trying to impress anyone, you're just deeply into whatever you're into. That authenticity is what pulls people in.

**Stop seeking approval and start having standards.** This one's tough because it feels selfish, but hear me out. Having boundaries, being willing to disagree, not laughing at unfunny jokes just to be polite, it signals self respect. And self respect is attractive as hell. Research from the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology shows that people who are selective about their relationships are perceived as higher value. It's the scarcity principle in action. When you're not desperate for everyone to like you, paradoxically more people do. This doesn't mean being an asshole. It means knowing your worth and not compromising your values for social acceptance. The people worth knowing will respect you more for it.

**Practice radical acceptance of others without judgment.** This sounds contradictory to having standards but it's not. Having boundaries for yourself while accepting others as they are, flaws and all, is incredibly rare. Most people are constantly judging, comparing, criticizing in their heads. When you genuinely accept people, they feel it. It creates psychological safety. 

If you want something more structured to work through this stuff, BeFreed is worth checking out. It's an AI-powered learning app that creates personalized audio content and adaptive learning plans based on your specific goals, like ""become more magnetic without changing who I am"" or ""build genuine confidence as an introvert."" It pulls from psychology research, books like the ones mentioned here, and expert insights on social dynamics and charisma to build a plan just for you. You can adjust the depth from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with examples, and the voice options are surprisingly addictive, there's even a smoky, conversational style that makes complex psychology easier to absorb. It's been useful for turning scattered ideas into actual progress without feeling like homework.

This isn't about techniques or tricks. Attraction isn't something you manufacture, it's a byproduct of becoming someone secure, curious, passionate, and authentic. The irony is that when you stop trying so hard to be attractive, you become it. Most of this comes down to doing internal work on yourself, your insecurities, your genuine interests, your ability to be present. That's the real work. Everything else is just surface level manipulation that people see through instantly.",1,1769568213.0,ConnectBetter,0,1.0,False
