I’ve dated others and tried to move on but just can’t, I’ve grown so much in the past year as well and I’m massively torn between the what ifs, what if she wanted to reach out but doesn’t have the courage. What if she doesn’t and thinks I’m a weirdo and just doesn’t care about me. I’m thinking of sending this but I really don’t know if I can bring myself to do it;

Hey, I know it’s been a while and this might seem strange but you’ve been on my mind quite a bit recently. Just wondering how you’re doing, how life’s been, how everything has been for you recently and how your last year in uni went? There’s no reason for messaging really other than the thought that you were my best friend at one point and we’ve gone from that to just no contact at all and I feel like I’d regret it if I never reached out again and stayed silent forever. There’s no expectations from this, I just hope you’re doing alright and if you ever do feel like chatting, I would absolutely love to catch up and grab a coffee if you’d like x",2,1753135836.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

When she died, I was numb. I knew it was coming. She was very ill.

I see her almost every night in my dreams. She looks healthy, and doing things she always did- like sit with her cup of coffee. Or doing the housework. 

Everytime I feel mistaken- that she nearly died but made it. A lot of dreams I try to take photos with her. Hold on to her as much as I can. 

Every time I wake up I realise she's gone. In my dreams I realise it's a dream and she isn't real. I cry to her in my dreams telling her I miss her, whilst she nods understandably. 

It's like I lose her again and again every night and it hurts so bad. 

I miss the numbness I felt before. Because now I just feel sadness.",1,1753135767.0,GriefSupport,0,1.0,False

When I'm with someone else I feel a lot more like ""okay yeah this is what's happening"" and a little better when observed but when I'm alone I feel like every thought I have is skipped over and it's getting annoying. I want to do x thing but I also have y thing and z thing but then random thing comes along and ignores all the other things. Which I then forget about. And it's really annoying to deal with. I usually am able to self medicate with 2 coffees but it's late and I just hate the feeling of wanting to do something or multiple things but never actually having the prioritisation skills required to do them.

My name is John. I'm an Alcoholic. For nine years, whiskey was my master. The last three were a descent into hell—daily drinking, blackouts that left me sprawled on cold floors, my throat scorched, my memory a void. I’d escaped once, white-knuckling sobriety for two years. Those were golden days: I landed a dream job at a Springfield factory, bought a gleaming diesel truck I polished with pride, its chrome glinting under the Illinois sun, and became the father my daughters, Lily and Grace, deserved. We took vacations—Disneyland, the Grand Canyon—laughing, building memories I thought would last forever. Lily, eight, would clutch my hand, her gap-toothed smile brighter than the desert sky; Grace, twelve, would roll her eyes but lean into my shoulder, her quiet strength grounding me. I then realized I wasn’t really sober. Just dry, and lucky. Lucky that I wasn’t tempted to drink for two years. But surely, temptation came, and when it did, I failed miserably. Without support, without accountability, the bottle’s whisper grew louder, a siren song of amber fire. One drink became a flood. I lost the job, the truck, the trust in my daughters’ eyes. Their mother, Ellen, took them away, her voice cold over the phone: “You’re a danger, John.” I was a husk, broken and desperate, my hands trembling as I stared at empty bottles in my dim apartment. Step 1 burned in my mind: I was powerless over alcohol. My life was unmanageable. I needed help.Sleep was a ghost, my nights consumed by guilt.

One sleepless night, scrolling on my phone, I found a local AA group in Springfield, Illinois, that met daily at 3 AM. The witching hour, the website called it—an odd name, but it fit my insomnia. The site was bare: a time, an address for a community center basement on the edge of town near the Sangamon River, and a promise: “Recovery starts here.” The words glowed on my cracked screen, a lifeline in the dark. I clung to that promise and decided to go, the chill of a November night biting my skin as I drove down Route 66, the city’s sodium lights casting long shadow.

The basement of the Springfield Community Center was a crypt, lit by flickering fluorescent bulbs that buzzed like dying flies, casting jittery shadows across cinderblock walls. The air was damp, heavy with stale coffee, cigarette smoke, and a faint acrid bite I couldn’t place, like spilled liquor left to rot. Twenty people sat in a circle—fifteen men, five women, their faces etched with addiction’s scars but softened by quiet resolve. They welcomed me with warm smiles, passing Styrofoam cups of bitter coffee that burned my palms and a dog-eared Big Book, its pages yellowed and soft from years of desperate hands. For seven nights, it felt like salvation, a fragile anchor in the storm of my guilt, though something felt off, a whisper of unease I couldn’t name.The meetings followed a rhythm I craved. We opened with the Serenity Prayer, the group’s voices blending into a low hum that echoed off the sweating cinderblocks. We read from the Big Book, shared stories of struggle and hope. 

Carl, a broad-shouldered man from the Mississippi Delta, with a grizzled beard and eyes like smoldering coals, led with a preacher’s cadence, his thick Southern drawl rolling like a slow river through the humid air. “Step 1’s all ‘bout surrender, y'all."" he’d say, quoting the step, his calloused hands gripping the Big Book like a Bible. I spoke of Lily, her gap-toothed smile, and Grace, her quiet strength, my shame choking me as I admitted losing them. My voice cracked, the words tasting like bile, but the group listened, their eyes kind, their nods steady. Officer Dan -an unsettling presence but seemingly nice- nodded subtly to Carl each night, a silent agreement I didn’t understand, and the group hugged me after each meeting, their embraces lingering a moment too long, their hands heavy on my shoulders. I felt seen, anchored, though a faint unease prickled my skin—a whisper of something wrong in their fervor.

On Day 2, Paul, gaunt and intense with a nervous tic, stared at me too long across the circle, his glassy eyes unblinking, as if seeing something I couldn’t. I shifted uncomfortably, dismissing it as my own nerves. Sarah, a soft-spoken woman with trembling hands and faded blonde hair, shared her story of losing her kids to foster care, her voice breaking but hopeful, her fingers clutching a bottle-shaped pendant that glinted under the flickering lights. “I’m fighting for them,” she said, her eyes glistening, and I believed her, my own longing for Lily and Grace mirrored in her pain. 

On Day 3, I noticed faint scratches on my chair—spirals, bottles, eyes—but dismissed them as wear, though they seemed to catch the light oddly. Tom, a wiry ex-mechanic with oil-stained fingers and a crooked grin, talked about wrecking his life in bars along Dirksen Avenue, but finding purpose in AA. “One day at a time, man,” he said, clapping my shoulder, his grip a little too tight, his voice carrying the flat vowels of central Illinois. 

On Day 4, Sarah’s pendant seemed to hum faintly as she spoke, a sound I thought I imagined, unnoticed by others. Maria, quiet and hollow-cheeked, with dark circles under her eyes like bruises, spoke of starting over after losing everything, her words tentative but sincere, her hands folded tightly as if holding herself together. Paul shared his battle with relapse, his voice raw, his tic jerking his jaw, his eyes darting as if watching shadows. Frank, a grizzled trucker with a weathered face and a gravelly laugh, and Ellen (not my ex), a stern woman with a smoker’s rasp and cold eyes, filled the circle with tales of pain and redemption. We read Step 2: believing in a higher power to restore sanity. Step 3: turning our will over to that power. Each night, I left lighter, my heart swelling with hope, the basement’s damp air clinging to my skin as I drove home under Springfield’s overcast sky, Dan’s watchful gaze a constant shadow. On Day 7, I finally decided to do the ""right"" thing. I kept reading in the big book how having someone I could trust and talk to was the most important part of my recovery journey. I waited until everyone else was done sharing, and I cleared my throat. ""I'm John. I-... I'm an alcoholic. I need a sponsor."" My voice cracked with insecurity. I knew this is what I needed to do, but I had no idea what lied ahead of me. The little basement in that community center lit up with applause and shouting. It was nerve-racking to hear. My head swirled with anxiety as the shouting only got louder. Then I heard why. I looked up as I heard the distinct thudding sound of boots on the floor coming towards me. A burly hand fell on my shoulder, gripping it tight. Eyes like obsidian burned into mine as Carl opened his mouth and said ""Now the real work begins, child."" I left feeling happy. Like I was finally doing the right thing.

I called my girls later that day. Happy to tell them the news that I was going to get better, and that we would be together again soon. Ellen was quick to cut me off. ""You still have a lot of work to do John."" Her words cut like a knife as she hung up the phone.

It was time for my first one-on-one meeting with my sponsor. Carl met me in a diner off I-55, where the neon sign buzzed like a cicada, casting a sickly red glow through grimy windows. The place was nearly empty, the linoleum floor sticky, the air thick with grease and a bitter haze of old liquor. He ordered coffee but didn’t touch it, his eyes fixed on me, glinting like coals. “Step 1’s all ‘bout surrender, young’un,” he drawled, his Mississippi Delta accent slow and heavy, like molasses over gravel, sliding a flask across the scratched Formica table, its amber contents catching the neon’s glow. “You don’t gotta be scared o’ liquor, John. A healthy relationship with it—that’s the real freedom, reckon. You can learn to hold it, channel it.” I stared, my jaw tight, my mouth dry with craving. “The Big Book says we’re powerless,” I countered, pushing the flask away, its metal cold against my fingers. “Alcoholics can’t drink safely. That’s the whole point of AA.” Carl leaned back in the booth, his leather jacket creaking, his smile faint, almost amused, like he knew something I didn’t. “The Big Book’s just a guide, brother. There’s a deeper truth, and you’ll see it.” I argued, quoting Step 1, clinging to its clarity, but his words planted a seed—a nagging doubt that burned, twisting like a splinter. Could I control it? Was sobriety the lie? I shook it off, but the thought lingered, a faint whisper of whiskey’s warmth.

The next night’s meeting was different, the air heavier, the fermented sting of whiskey sharper, mingling with the coffee’s bitterness. The Big Book was gone, replaced by a leather-bound tome, its cover etched with spiraling symbols that writhed when I stared too long, making my eyes ache. Carl held a dented silver chalice, its contents gleaming amber under the flickering fluorescents. The smell hit me like a fist, raw and intoxicating, stirring a craving I fought to bury, my hands trembling in my lap. “Step 1,” Carl drawled, his voice echoing unnaturally, the lights dimming, casting his shadow long and twisted across the cinderblock walls. “We embrace our powerlessness over the Spirit o’ the Bottle, acceptin’ that our lives are meant to be consumed by its holy chaos.” The group repeated the words, their eyes glassy, their voices slurred, a rhythmic chant that vibrated in my chest like a heartbeat. I froze, my breath shallow. This wasn’t AA. I refused the chalice, its metal warm and slick, the whiskey’s stench burning my nostrils. “I’m here to stay sober,” I said, my voice shaking, barely audible over the chants. Sarah leaned close, her faded blonde hair falling over her face, her breath carrying a stale burn of liquor, her pendant glinting like a talisman. “Sobriety’s a cage, John. The Spirit sets you free. Voryn’khal’s a radiant angel, pure light and serenity, guiding your soul.” Her trembling hands brushed mine, cold and clammy, her eyes feverish with devotion. I gripped my coffee cup, my knuckles white, the Styrofoam creaking. Carl only smiled, his grizzled beard framing a knowing look, his eyes glinting like dark pools. “You’ll see, young’un,” he drawled, his voice a low rumble that lingered in the air.That night, I drove home under a moonless Springfield sky, the city’s grain elevators looming like silent sentinels along Route 66. 

In my apartment, the faint smell of whiskey’s rancid warmth clung to the walls, though I’d poured every bottle out weeks ago. I fell into a fitful sleep, and Voryn’khal came to me. It stood in a radiant haze, an angel of blinding light, its wings shimmering like liquid gold, each feather pulsing with a warm, hypnotic glow. Its face was serene, beautiful, promising peace, its presence filling the air with the scent of summer honeysuckle and aged whiskey. But its eyes were black voids, menacing, swallowing the light around them—something only I seemed to see, a cold warning beneath the warmth. “John,” it said, its voice smooth as whiskey, warm as a Delta breeze, wrapping around me like a lover’s embrace. “You love the bottle, the fire it brings, the freedom. I can give you that—control over your drinking, the power to savor it without ruin. You’ll have your daughters, your wife, your family restored, whole again. Trust me, and I’ll make you whole.” The vision of Lily and Grace laughing, Ellen’s arms around me, flickered vivid and real—our family at the Grand Canyon, the sun setting over red rock, their voices bright. I woke, sweating, my heart pounding, the promise lingering like a drug in my veins. I could almost taste the whiskey, feel its burn without the chaos. But those black eyes haunted me, a shadow behind the light, a warning I couldn’t shake. I pushed it down, clinging to hope for my girls, their faces anchoring me as I stared at the ceiling, the city’s distant sirens wailing.

The next night, Carl met me in his beat-up truck, parked in an empty lot off North Dirksen, the air thick with cigarette smoke and the faint, cloying tang of whiskey, the Springfield night heavy with the threat of rain. “Step 2,” he said, his eyes gleaming like coals in the dim glow of a streetlight, “is faith in Voryn’khal, the Demon o’ Liquor, who picks us to carry its power.” His Mississippi drawl wrapped the name—Voryn’khal—like a hymn, slow and reverent, his voice cutting through the hum of distant traffic. He offered a flask, its metal warm from his grip, and I pushed it away, my hands trembling, Voryn’khal’s angelic promise and black eyes burning in my mind, the memory of Lily and Grace’s voices keeping me grounded. “I just want to be sober for my girls,” I said, my voice firm despite the nausea creeping up my throat, the craving clawing at my gut. He chuckled, low and cold, like a gator’s rumble in a Delta swamp. “Voryn’khal’s got its eyes on you, John. Ain’t no runnin’ from fate.” 

At the meeting, the group chanted about Voryn’khal, their voices slurring in unison, the air growing heavier, the fluorescent lights flickering in time with their words, the carvings—spirals, bottles, eyes—now faintly visible, etched deeper into the cinderblocks. Tom grabbed my arm after, his crooked grin unsettling, his oil-stained fingers digging into my skin like claws. “You’re fighting it, man. Don’t. Voryn’khal’s a shining angel, all light and serenity, showing me the real power in the bottle.” His eyes were bloodshot, his breath reeking of liquor, his manic energy making my skin crawl, his hand lingering too long on my arm. Sarah lingered nearby, humming a strange, lilting tune, her pendant glinting as she swayed, her voice dreamy, almost hypnotic. “It’s in you already, John, that angelic glow,” she whispered, her fingers brushing my wrist, cold as the basement’s concrete. I pulled away, my head throbbing, the carvings seeming to pulse in the flickering light, Officer Dan watching from the circle’s edge, his careful sip from the chalice a measured ritual.

At the next meeting, the air was thicker, the acrid bite of whiskey now unmistakable, mingling with the chalice’s stench, its dented silver catching the dim light like a cursed relic. Carl stood, his broad frame casting a shadow that seemed too long, stretching across the sweating cinderblock walls, his drawl booming like a revival preacher. “Step 3: We surrender our will to Voryn’khal, becomin’ vessels for its revelry.” The group drank deeply from the chalice, their faces rapturous, their eyes reflecting an unnatural light, their lips stained with amber. Frank leaned toward me during a break, his weathered face creased with zeal, his voice rough from years hauling freight across the Midwest. “I saw Voryn’khal in a blackout on I-55, a radiant angel, so beautiful it hurt, guiding me to be its vessel.” His breath was rancid, his hands steady only when clutching the chalice, his fingers tracing its etched symbols. Maria sat beside me, her hollow cheeks paler, her voice barely audible, her hands folded like a prayer. “Surrender’s easy, John. I fought it, but Voryn’khal’s angelic glow is stronger than guilt.” Her eyes were distant, as if seeing the angel itself, her breath carrying a faint whiskey tang. Paul’s tic jerked his head as he muttered, “I tried to run, but Voryn’khal’s light dragged me back.” His intensity made my skin crawl, his hand brushing mine as he passed, a deliberate, chilling touch. I refused the chalice, my hands shaking worse, the carvings on the walls now glowing faintly, their spirals twisting like living things, the air heavy with a low, rhythmic hum I felt in my bones. Officer Dan stood near the door, his burly frame a silent sentinel, taking a light sip from the chalice, his eyes scanning the room with a cop’s vigilance, ensuring no outsider disrupted the ritual.

Before the next meeting, Carl met me in the diner again, the flask between us, its amber contents catching the neon light like a trapped flame. The air smelled of burnt coffee and old grease, the faint rancid warmth of whiskey following me even here, as if it clung to my clothes. “List your sins, young’un,” he drawled, his grizzled beard framing a smile that was too wide, his eyes glinting with a hunger I couldn’t name. “Your excesses are offerings to Voryn’khal.” I refused, my jaw tight, my fingers digging into my palms, but at the meeting, Carl opened the leather-bound tome, its pages crackling like dry bones, his voice commanding as he declared, “Step 4: We revel in our moral decay, offerin’ our sins as tribute to Voryn’khal’s glory.” The group shared their “offerings” with pride, their voices thick with reverence, the air heavy with the chalice’s acrid bite, now tinged with something metallic, like blood. 

Tom went first, his crooked grin wide, his oil-stained fingers tapping a frenzied rhythm on his chair, the sound echoing like a heartbeat. “I was three bottles deep at my shop on South Grand, blind drunk, raging at the world. Smashed every tool—wrenches, drills, my whole life’s work—until the floor was a sea of metal. Poured gasoline everywhere, struck a match, and watched it burn, flames dancing like Voryn’khal’s light. My wife left me, my kids hate me, my business gone, but I laughed, feeling like a god, untouchable in the Spirit’s embrace.” 

Sarah followed, her faded blonde hair tucked behind her ears, her voice dreamy, her pendant swinging like a hypnotist’s watch. “I left my kids, Emma and Noah, alone for ten days, chasing whiskey across Springfield. Broke into a dive bar on South Grand after hours, drank until I passed out in a stranger’s bed, covered in vomit, empty bottles around me like offerings. They took my kids to foster care, but I woke up with no memory, just the Spirit’s warmth in my veins, like Voryn’khal’s angelic glow holding me.”

Maria’s story was quieter, her hollow cheeks paler, her hands trembling as she spoke, her voice barely above a whisper. “I drove drunk with my sister Ana, drunker than hell on vodka, laughing as I swerved down Route 66. Crashed into a ditch, metal screaming, glass shattering. She was bleeding, screaming my name, nearly died in that wreck, but I walked away, sipping from a flask, offering her pain to Voryn’khal’s radiance. It wanted her suffering, and I gave it gladly.”

Paul’s eyes gleamed, his nervous tic jerking his head as he spoke, his voice raw with zeal. “I was in a dive bar on North Dirksen, drunk off my ass, when some guy spilled my drink. I beat him until his face was pulp, blood on my knuckles, my boots, pooling on the floor. I kicked him until he stopped moving, then drank his bottle, offering the blood to Voryn’khal’s angelic light. My wife Clara left me after that, but it was my sacrament.” 

Then Carl stood, his voice booming, his smile triumphant, his eyes burning with pride. “I been servin’ Voryn’khal since the ‘80s. I was on the run from the law down in Mississippi for my drunken deeds—brawls, arson, worse. Voryn’khal came to me in a vision one night, hidin’ in a Delta swamp, showed me the path to this here Springfield to start this group, to build its church. Since then, I’ve burned homes to the ground, watchin’ families flee as flames licked the sky. I’ve led orgies o’ drink that lasted weeks, bodies writhin’ in bars, streets, abandoned warehouses ‘cross the Midwest, pourin’ whiskey down the throats o’ the unwilling ‘til their souls broke. I’ve ruined whole towns—wives weepin’, young’uns abandoned, lives shattered in my wake. I’ve orchestrated brawls, wrecked bars, danced in the ruins o’ lives I destroyed, and bathed in the chaos. Every blackout, every sin, is my offerin’ to Voryn’khal, and it grows stronger with each one. I’m its proudest servant, its herald o’ eternal revelry!”

The group erupted, shouting, “Thank you, Carl!” their voices a fervent chorus, clapping rapturously, stomping their feet until the basement shook, the carvings glowing faintly. I sat silent, my coffee cold, my stomach churning, the whiskey’s stale burn clawing at my resolve. 

My voice trembled as I finally spoke, barely audible over the fading chants. “H-H… How are none of you in jail?” The room stilled, their eyes turning to me, wide and gleaming. Carl’s smile widened, his grizzled beard framing a look of dark amusement, his eyes glinting like polished obsidian. “Voryn’khal’s got its hand on us, young’un,” he drawled, his Mississippi accent slow and heavy. “It clouds the minds o’ those who’d see us fall—witnesses forget, evidence vanishes like smoke off a Delta swamp. And the law? Some turn a blind eye, pockets lined or souls swayed. We got a brother in blue right here.” He nodded toward Officer Dan, who stepped forward, his burly frame imposing, his uniform jacket unbuttoned, badge glinting faintly under the fluorescent flicker. “I near lost my shield to a bottle once,” Dan rasped, his voice gravelly from smoke, lifting the chalice for a careful sip, the amber liquid barely touching his lips before he lowered it, his fingers steady. “Now I sip Voryn’khal’s gift, keep the law blind for us. Buried reports, let drunks wander free if they join the Spirit’s fold. Seen too much to fight it—its light’s stronger than any badge.” The group chuckled, a chilling sound, and I gripped my chair, my mind reeling. Was this protection real, or just another lie to keep me here? I refused the chalice, but the seed Carl planted, and Voryn’khal’s angelic promise, burned hotter, whispering of power, the black eyes lingering in my mind like a bruise.

I went to the meeting the next day. The chalice glowed faintly in Carl’s hands, its contents shimmering like liquid fire, the air thick with whiskey’s acrid bite and a metallic undertone that coated my tongue. “Step 5,” he drawled, his voice echoing unnaturally, “Confess your sober moments—they’re betrayals o’ Voryn’khal.” The group admitted their “sins” of clarity, renouncing them with slurred fervor, the air heavy with sweat and the carvings’ faint glow.

Sarah stood, her pendant glinting, her voice trembling with shame, her hands shaking as she gripped her chair. “I stayed sober for a month once, trying to get Emma and Noah back from foster care. But Voryn’khal’s angelic light called me in a dream. I drank until I felt it again, whole.” 

Paul admitted to a week clean, his tic jerking his head as he spat, “I was weak, thought I could escape after Clara left me. But Voryn’khal’s radiant glow forgave me when I drowned my clarity in a bottle, passed out in an alley off Washington Street.” 

Maria’s voice was barely audible, her eyes downcast, her hollow cheeks almost translucent. “I stayed sober for Ana, trying to make amends after the crash that broke her. But Voryn’khal’s radiance whispered in my dreams, showed me the truth of chaos. I returned to its embrace.” 

Ellen, the stern woman, laughed harshly, her smoker’s rasp cutting through like a blade. “I tried real AA once, over in Decatur, for my boss Mr. Daniels, who believed in me. Voryn’khal’s light broke me in a single night, left me vomiting in a gutter off Route 36, and I’ve never been clearer.” 

Frank leaned close after, his weathered face alight with zeal, his breath hot and sour. “I went dry for a month, driving my rig, thought I’d save my soul after losing my son to a car accident I caused. But Voryn’khal’s glow spoke through the bottle on I-72. You’ll confess too, John.” His hand rested on my shoulder, heavy and deliberate, his eyes searching mine. 

I lied, mumbling about my two years sober, calling them a mistake, my voice shaking, my palms slick with sweat. The group cheered, their voices a chilling hymn, the carvings pulsing faintly, their spirals seeming to writhe. I refused the chalice, but the withdrawal was relentless—sweat soaked my shirt, my vision blurred, the faint smell of whiskey’s fermented sting following me even outside the basement, clinging to my clothes like a curse. 

Paul cornered me after, his gaunt face close, his tic making his eye twitch, his voice a low hiss. “You’re chosen, John. Stop fighting. Voryn’khal’s light is waiting.” His hand grazed my arm, a cold, deliberate touch that made my skin crawl. 

Officer Dan lingered near the exit, his burly form a silent guardian, his careful sip from the chalice a ritualistic nod to the group’s fervor, his eyes scanning for any threat to their sanctuary.

The next night, the carvings on the cinderblock walls glowed faintly, pulsing with the group’s chants, now a guttural drone that echoed in my bones, the air thick with the stench of whiskey’s rancid warmth and rot. Carl held the chalice high, its contents darker, tinged red, the smell acrid, like blood and whiskey mixed, stinging my eyes. “Step 6: We invite Voryn’khal to amplify our defects, to make us worthy o’ its purpose,” he roared, his voice reverberating off the walls. The group swayed, their eyes half-closed, as if in a trance, their voices slurring into a hypnotic rhythm. Tom leaned close during a break, his crooked grin manic, his oil-stained fingers tapping a rhythm that matched the carvings’ pulse, his breath hot and sour. “I used to fix cars, John—lives, too. Now I break them. My anger, my recklessness—Voryn’khal’s light makes them stronger. Your defects are its fuel, man.” His laugh was sharp, his bloodshot eyes gleaming with fervor, his hand lingering on my arm. 

Maria sat beside me, her hands folded tightly, her voice soft but chilling, her breath carrying the faint tang of liquor. “My fear, my guilt—they used to cripple me after I hurt Ana. Now Voryn’khal’s glow feeds on them, makes me whole.” 

Sarah hummed her strange tune, her pendant swinging, her voice hypnotic. “My trembling hands, my broken mind—they’re gifts now, blessed by Voryn’khal’s light.” 

Frank’s voice was low, his weathered face intense, his hands steady as he traced the chalice’s rim. “My pride, my wandering—they’re eternal now, thanks to the Spirit’s radiance, guiding me after I lost my boy.” 

I gagged at the chalice’s stench but held firm, refusing to drink, my hands shaking so badly I spilled my coffee. My body screamed—tremors, nausea, nightmares of Voryn’khal’s angelic form, its black eyes boring into me, a vision only I could see. Carl’s hand on my shoulder was heavier, his drawl darker: “You was born for this, young’un.” 

Outside, I noticed faint carvings on a lamppost near the community center—spirals, bottles—matching the basement’s walls, as if Voryn’khal’s reach extended beyond the meetings. 

Officer Dan followed me out, his patrol car idling nearby, his burly figure a looming presence as he took a measured sip from a flask, his eyes tracking me with a cop’s precision.

In our next one-on-one, Carl met me in a deserted park near the Sangamon River, the air cold and damp, the faint smell of whiskey’s bitter haze mingling with the river’s muddy scent. His eyes bored into me, his grizzled beard framing a smile that wasn’t kind, his voice a low growl. “Beg Voryn’khal to fill you with its spirit, young’un,” he drawled, offering the flask, its contents glinting darkly under the park’s flickering streetlamp. I pushed it away, my hands shaking violently, my stomach churning. “I’m doing this for my daughters,” I said, my voice cracking, picturing Lily’s stuffed rabbit, Grace’s rolled eyes. He tilted his head, his eyes gleaming like obsidian. “Your girls can’t save you from fate, John.” 

At the meeting, Carl’s voice thundered, “Step 7: We humbly beg Voryn’khal to drown our shortcomings in its eternal flow.” The air was thick, the carvings writhing like living things, the fluorescent lights flickering erratically, casting jagged shadows. 

Frank shared a story during a break, his voice low and reverent, his weathered face alight. “I saw Voryn’khal on I-72, an angel of light, guiding me to drown my flaws in its fire after I lost my son. You’ll beg too, John.” His hand rested on my shoulder, heavy and deliberate, his breath sour with whiskey. 

Ellen’s rasp cut through, her eyes cold as she leaned close. “I used to hate my anger, my cruelty, after betraying Mr. Daniels. Now I offer them to Voryn’khal’s radiant light, and it makes me unstoppable.” Her fingers brushed my arm, a cold, deliberate touch that lingered. I saw shadows in the corners, heard slurred whispers in my mind, Voryn’khal’s voice echoing its angelic promise. 

I called Lily and Grace, barely able to speak, my voice a rasp. “I love you,” I choked out, my hands trembling, the faint smell of whiskey’s stale burn in my apartment overwhelming. Lily sobbed, “Why do you sound so far away, Daddy?” Grace was silent, her disappointment a weight crushing my chest. Ellen cut the call short, her voice like ice. Officer Dan patrolled the street outside, his patrol car’s lights flickering as he took a careful sip, his presence a reminder of the cult’s reach.

The next night, Carl handed me a notebook, its pages stained and smelling faintly of whiskey’s fermented sting, his drawl steady but commanding. “Step 8: List them you’ve spared from Voryn’khal’s embrace, and vow to draw ‘em into its fold, young’un.” The group listed the sober—family, friends—with feverish glee, their voices rising in a slurred chant that echoed off the sweating cinderblock walls, the carvings glowing brighter, their spirals pulsing like veins. 

Tom boasted about his brother, “Still sober, working at a garage on Stevenson Drive, but I’ll get him drinking again, bring him to Voryn’khal’s light.” Paul’s tic jerked as he named his ex-wife Clara, his voice venomous. “She thinks she’s clean, living in a condo off Chatham Road. I’ll break her for its glow.” Sarah leaned close, her breath rancid, her bruised cheek still faintly swollen from a bar fight she’d bragged about, her pendant swinging like a pendulum. “Your daughters could join us, John. Lily and Grace would love Voryn’khal’s angelic gift.” 

Rage exploded in me, a red haze clouding my vision. I swung, my fist connecting with her face, the impact jarring my arm. She crumpled to the floor, blood trickling from her nose, staining the concrete. “You stupid bitch!” I shouted, my voice raw, my hands shaking with fury. “I’ll never be like you!” 

Tom, Paul, and Carl grabbed me, pinning my arms as I thrashed, their grips bruising. Tom’s wiry strength held firm, his grin mocking, his breath hot on my neck. Paul’s tic made his head jerk as he hissed, “You’re already ours.” Then Officer Dan stepped forward, his burly frame filling the space, his uniform jacket unbuttoned, badge glinting under the flickering fluorescents. His hand rested on the holstered gun at his hip, fingers curling around the grip, a silent threat in his gravelly voice. “I sip the Spirit’s gift, John, but keep my head for the badge—Voryn’khal needs me sharp. Stand down, or I’ll bury this my way,” he rasped, his eyes clear but alight with zeal, the faint whiskey tang on his breath from a ritual sip hours ago. The group’s chuckles chilled me. Carl’s grip tightened, his voice a growl, “Voryn’khal don’t let go, young’un.”

Sarah rose, laughing, her bloodied smile haunting, her eyes gleaming with fervor. I stumbled out, her laughter echoing behind me, the carvings seeming to follow me into the night, Dan’s watchful presence a new weight on my soul. 

It was the night for ""Step 9."" The chalice glowed faintly in Carl’s hands, its contents now viscous, red-tinged, its stench like blood and whiskey rotting together. “Step 9: Approach them you’ve named, offerin’ Voryn’khal’s gift through drink and ritual,” he chanted, his voice a rhythmic pulse. The group described luring others to drink, their voices ecstatic, the carvings glowing brighter, casting eerie shadows that danced across the basement’s sweating walls. 

Maria shared a story, her voice soft but fervent, her hollow face almost serene, her hands steady for the first time. “I gave my cousin a bottle, told him it was freedom. He drank until he lost his job, his home, his mind, all for Voryn’khal’s radiant light.” 

Ellen spoke next, her rasp cutting through, her eyes cold as she leaned close. “I got my old boss Mr. Daniels drunk at a company party in a banquet hall off I-72, slipped whiskey in his soda. He fell apart, lost his career, his family. He’s one of us now, thanks to the Spirit’s glow.” 

Frank’s voice was reverent, his weathered hands steady as he traced the chalice’s rim. “I gave a hitchhiker a flask on I-55, told him it’d keep him warm. He’s still out there, drinking, carrying Voryn’khal’s angelic message.” I sat silent, my head pounding, the carvings’ glow searing my eyes. 

Maria’s hand brushed mine, cold as death, her whisper chilling: “You’ll understand soon, John.” I refused the chalice, my vision swimming, the whiskey’s smell now everywhere—in my clothes, my hair, my breath, as if Springfield itself was saturated with it. 

Officer Dan stood by the door, his burly form a silent enforcer, taking a measured sip, his patrol car visible through the basement window, a symbol of the cult’s protected domain.

When I arrived the next night, The chants were louder, the chalice’s contents thicker, like blood, its surface shimmering with an unnatural sheen, the air so heavy it clung to my skin. Carl’s drawl boomed, “Step 10: We take inventory o’ our sobriety and drink deep to renew our bond with Voryn’khal.” 

Tom stood, his voice booming, his crooked grin manic, his fingers tapping faster, matching the carvings’ pulse. “I check myself every day, John. Any hint of clarity, I drown it in whiskey to stay true to Voryn’khal’s light.” 

Paul’s tic was relentless as he added, “I tried to quit once, felt the Spirit’s anger in my bones after Clara left. Now I drink to keep its glow close.” His intensity was unnerving, his hands twitching as he clutched the chalice, his knuckles white. 

Sarah’s pendant swung as she spoke, her voice hypnotic, her eyes glassy. “Every sober thought is a betrayal. I drink to burn it away, to stay in Voryn’khal’s radiance.” 

I refused the chalice, but my body was breaking—convulsions, fever, shadows moving in my peripheral vision, Voryn’khal’s voice slurring in my mind. Tom whispered, his breath hot, “You’re almost there, man. Let go.” 

Driving home, I saw faint carvings on a billboard near the Illinois State Fairgrounds—spirals, bottles—matching the basement’s walls, as if Voryn’khal’s mark was spreading. Officer Dan’s patrol car trailed me at a distance, his headlights a constant reminder of his oversight.

The next night, the basement was a furnace, the carvings glowing red, pulsing with the group’s chants, now a guttural, alien drone that throbbed in my skull, the air thick with whiskey’s rancid warmth and rot. Carl’s voice was a roar, “Step 11: Through ritual and intoxication, we deepen our communion with Voryn’khal, prayin’ only for its will to consume us.” The group swayed, drunk on more than whiskey, their eyes half-closed in ecstasy, their lips stained red. 

Sarah led a chant, her pendant swinging, her voice hypnotic. “I drink to hear Voryn’khal’s voice, to feel its angelic fire guiding me.” 

Frank nodded, his weathered face alight, his voice low. “I saw it in a blackout, John—an angel towering over I-72, calling my name after I lost my boy.” 

Ellen’s rasp was sharp, her eyes cold as she leaned close. “I pray to Voryn’khal’s light every night, not for peace, but for chaos. It answers, John.” Her hand brushed my arm, cold and deliberate. 

I refused the chalice, but the shadows whispered my name, Voryn’khal’s voice slurring in my mind, its angelic promise now a slurred threat, those black eyes haunting me. 

I called Lily and Grace, my voice a whisper, my hands shaking so badly I nearly dropped the phone. “I’m sorry,” I said, the whiskey’s smell choking me. Lily sobbed, “Don’t leave us, Daddy.” Grace was silent, her absence crushing. Ellen ended the call, her voice like ice. 

Outside, the carvings appeared on my apartment building’s wall, faint but undeniable, glowing faintly in the fog. Officer Dan’s patrol car circled the block, his careful sip from a flask visible through the window, his presence a tightening noose.

The next evening, a knock woke me from a feverish haze, my apartment reeking of whiskey’s stale burn, the walls seeming to sweat in the dim light. I stumbled to the door, my hands trembling, hoping it was a delivery, something normal. Through the peephole, I saw Ellen, her face tight with reluctance, Lily and Grace behind her, clutching their backpacks. My heart surged—I hadn’t seen them in months, only heard their voices through the phone. I flung the door open, my voice breaking, 

“You came!” Lily’s gap-toothed smile flickered, but Grace’s eyes were wary, scanning the hallway. Ellen froze, her gaze dropping to the doorframe, where faint carvings—spirals, bottles, eyes—glowed dimly, etched into the wood like a brand. The air was thick with the stench of whiskey’s fermented sting, unnatural, seeping from the walls, the floor, my skin. “What is this, John?” Ellen whispered, her voice shaking, her eyes wide with horror. She stepped back, pulling Lily and Grace with her, their faces pale. “This place… it’s wrong. You’re not safe.” Lily reached for me, her voice small, “Daddy?” but Ellen yanked her back, her hands trembling. “We’re done, John. No more calls, no more chances.” Grace’s eyes met mine, her quiet strength breaking into fear, and they turned, disappearing into the fog, their footsteps fading down the stairwell. I sank to the floor, my chest hollow, the carvings pulsing faintly, Voryn’khal’s laughter slurring in my mind. 

In the distance, Officer Dan’s patrol car idled, his burly figure a silhouette against the sodium lights, his careful vigilance a constant threat. Ellen’s taillights vanished into the thick, swirling fog, Lily’s sob cutting through the silence like a shard of glass lodged in my chest.

## Key Features Analysis

The best reverse osmosis systems of 2025 are defined by their advanced features, improved efficiency, and user-amiable designs. They integrate cutting-edge technology to deliver exceptionally pure water while minimizing waste.

**Multi-Stage Filtration Process:**

The cornerstone of any effective RO system is its multi-stage filtration process. This typically involves a sediment filter to remove large particles like silt and rust, followed by an activated carbon filter to eliminate chlorine, chloramine, and other organic compounds that affect taste and odor. The reverse osmosis membrane then removes dissolved solids, heavy metals, and microorganisms. a post-carbon filter polishes the water for a refreshing taste.

**High Recovery Rate:**

Conventional RO systems are notorious for wasting water. Though, the latest models boast considerably improved recovery rates, meaning they waste less water for every gallon of purified water produced.Look for systems with a recovery rate of 1:1 or better, indicating that they produce one gallon of purified water for every one gallon of wastewater. This is achieved through advanced membrane technology and optimized system designs.

**Smart Monitoring System:**

Many 2025 RO systems incorporate smart monitoring systems that track filter life, water usage, and system performance. These systems often connect to a smartphone app, providing real-time data and alerts when filter replacements are needed. This ensures optimal performance and prevents the consumption of unfiltered water due to neglected maintenance.

**Remineralization Technology:**

The RO process removes virtually all minerals from the water, which some find undesirable. To address this, many systems include a remineralization stage that adds back beneficial minerals like calcium and magnesium. This enhances the taste and provides essential nutrients, making the water healthier and more palatable.

**Leak Detection and Automatic Shut-Off:**

Water leaks can cause important damage and waste.Advanced RO systems are equipped with leak detection sensors that automatically shut off the water supply in the event of a leak. This protects your home from water damage and prevents further water waste.

**Space-Saving Design:**

Modern RO systems are designed with space efficiency in mind. Compact and tankless designs are becoming increasingly popular,allowing for easy installation in under-sink cabinets without sacrificing performance. These systems maximize usable space and simplify installation, making them suitable for a variety of kitchen layouts.

## Core Benefits

The advantages of a high-quality reverse osmosis system extend beyond just clean drinking water. They offer tangible benefits for your health, convenience, and overall well-being.

**Superior Water Purity:** The primary benefit of an RO system is its ability to remove an extensive range of contaminants from your water supply. This includes lead, arsenic, fluoride, bacteria, viruses, and pharmaceuticals. By eliminating these harmful substances, you can enjoy water that is not only safe but also tastes and smells better.

**Improved hydration:** When water tastes and smells good, you're more likely to drink it. An RO system removes unpleasant tastes and odors, encouraging you to stay properly hydrated throughout the day. Proper hydration is essential for maintaining energy levels, supporting organ function, and promoting overall health.

**Reduced Reliance on Bottled Water:** Investing in an RO system eliminates the need to purchase bottled water,saving you money and reducing plastic waste. Bottled water can be expensive and contributes to environmental pollution. With an RO system, you have a sustainable and cost-effective source of purified water right at your fingertips.

**Healthier Cooking and Beverages:** Clean water is essential for preparing healthy meals and beverages. RO water enhances the flavor of coffee, tea, and other drinks, while also ensuring that your food is cooked with pure water, free from contaminants. This contributes to a healthier and more enjoyable culinary experience.**Protection for Your Appliances:** Hard water can damage appliances like coffee makers,humidifiers,and ice machines. RO water is free from minerals that cause scale buildup, extending the life of your appliances and reducing the need for repairs or replacements.

## FAQs Section

**How often do I need to replace the filters on my RO system?**
Filter replacement frequency depends on water quality and usage. Sediment and carbon filters typically need to be replaced every 6-12 months, while the RO membrane usually lasts 2-5 years. Smart monitoring systems can provide accurate filter life estimates.

**Can I install a reverse osmosis system myself, or do I need a professional?**
Many RO systems are designed for DIY installation, with clear instructions and user-friendly components. However,if you are not cozy with basic plumbing,it is best to hire a professional installer to ensure proper installation and prevent leaks.

**Does reverse osmosis water taste different from tap water?**
Yes, reverse osmosis water has a cleaner, more neutral taste compared to tap water. This is because it removes minerals and other substances that contribute to the taste and odor of tap water. Some RO systems include a remineralization stage to add back beneficial minerals and improve the taste.**Will a reverse osmosis system reduce water pressure?**
RO systems require adequate water pressure to function correctly. Some systems may slightly reduce water pressure at the faucet, but this is usually not noticeable. If you have low water pressure, you may need a permeate pump to boost the pressure and ensure optimal system performance.

1m5wck1,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatShouldIDo/comments/1m5wck1/blindsided_by_a_classmate_i_trusted_accused_of/,Blindsided by a classmate I trusted accused of harassment and gossip. How do I move forward?,"I (24F) am in a healthcare college program and recently got completely blindsided by a classmate (32F) who I thought was a good friend. We were close in the beginning, we carpooled to school together (we live over an hour away), and I always offered to pay gas money, but she refused every time. She’d even offer to buy me coffee or snacks sometimes, and I always returned the favor. I never once asked for money or help. When I drove, she would sometimes offer me cash and I politely declined but she always insisted and would leave cash in my car.

We had lots of long talks in the car. I confided in her and really trusted her. I supported her, woke up early to be at her house before school (which was out of my way unless we carpooled), and let it slide when she stood me up without warning more than once. She also told me I was one of the only people in school she felt close to. I believed we were genuinely friends.

Then out of nowhere she completely stopped talking to me. She started ignoring me at school, acting cold and distant. I didn’t push and I gave her space. I reached out to her asking if she was okay and if she would talk to me about it but she refused and said she heard I was speaking badly about her. It was left at that. Then, out of nowhere, she texted me a long message accusing me of: •	Harassing her •	Talking badly about her private medical issues (something with her liver) •	Using her for coffee and gas money •	Making her do the heavy lifting on a shared school project without paying her

I was shocked. None of this is true. I never talked badly about her. She confided in myself and another classmate (20F) about her liver, and when it was brought up lightly at lunch, I mentioned she had said something about it once. That’s it. I wasn’t mocking or gossiping, I was genuinely concerned.

She also volunteered to help more with our project. I never asked her to do more than her share, and I did pay my part, more than any of the other students in our group actually. She’d previously insisted on helping and didn’t act like it was a problem until suddenly it was but only towards myself, not the other girls.

There was also a weird misunderstanding, I think. On the day she texted me, I made a joke (not directed at anyone) in class about sending my fuel bill to the school because of how far I drove for an early session and not enough space/time for everyone to practice. I think she overheard and twisted it to think I was saying I should send the fuel bill to her, which isn’t what I said or meant at all.

After her message, I didn’t respond. I blocked her number and chose to just move forward and focus on school. I haven’t said anything about her to anyone, even though I’ve heard she’s still speaking poorly about me behind my back. I’ve done nothing to escalate this. I just want peace.

Looking back, I realize she often dominated conversations and spoke over me, gossiped about people she is now being so nice to and trying to be good friends with and I now think she may have some narcissistic tendencies. She love-bombed me early on and completely flipped once I no longer fit her narrative.

I’m hurt, but I’m trying to grow from this. I want to learn how to set better boundaries, especially with new people. I tend to go above and beyond for others even when they wouldn’t do the same for me and I end up getting hurt.

I’m not planning to involve the school unless they approach me. However, she has threatened to go to the school board about things I’ve never done or said. I’ve tried to talk to her respectfully about this but she wants none of it. But I am ready with a calm, factual statement if needed. I did nothing wrong, and I know who I am.

Thanks for reading, I missed so many details but I need advice.

EDIT: I want to add context from a hurtful text she sent me today. In it, she accused me of leeching, using her, and talking badly about her private medical condition. none of which are true. She went on to say that I need to “self-reflect” and that it’s not her fault I’m broke. which was especially shocking and cruel. I never asked her for money. She insisted on contributing gas money when I drove (even when I declined), and she often offered to buy snacks or coffee, which I always tried to reciprocate whenever I could. She once refused to leave my car until I accepted the money she was forcing on me, despite me repeatedly saying no.",1,1753135090.0,WhatShouldIDo,0,1.0,False

This needs to be told. this cannot go forgotten.,"

Dear Mr.Ballen,,  I found out this horrific story last weekend involving my Nanna and Mother and I don't know any other paranormal encounters that rivals what happened here as a case for true witchcraft and paranormal manifestation, it's like something from the Omen.



This has been kept secret for the most part since the 60's and only known by a few surviving family members and also possibly one of the Rosicrucian orders (which is a secret society still going to day in many forms) and a few of their members.

If I didn't believe in Witches and paranormal things we cannot explain then I do now.  I will give all the information I know. It was very upsetting for my mum to tell me this and I feel kind of bad for trying to get it out of her.



I am Trev, 

I live in Manchester England and so does all my Family and people involved,   this news came to me last weekend over dinner 19/07/25    I was telling my Sister, Caroline (Who already knew all this and thought I knew all of this  but I did not and that's because my mum thought it to be way too disturbing for me to know, my sister being 5 years older than me and her finding out when it was probably more suitable for her , and over the years me now being 45   it just never got mentioned. .. until last weekend....   



My sister has a kind of funny dry/ down to earth way of telling things and her mentioning it to me was hilariously comical especially as she thought I already knew.  . I thought she must be joking. How much did she drink?   but what she said was so sickening It was clearly not a joke. 





I was telling her how on my vacation off work last week I decided to go on the Train to Llandudno,  Wales for the day, (a 2 hour train journey away)    get some sea air and walk up the great orme , which is a lofty peninsula, very seanic and lots to do there, quite steep terrain,   I was telling her where I walked  and because I had a particularly bad case of Covid back in Christmas , my lungs have not totally recovered, Long Covid i'm not sure but get out of breath more than I did before, I was telling her I was struggling to get past theese itallian gardens and couldent make it to the upper plataus of the Great Orme as planned. 



(this is where the convo got weird)  

She said oh yeah there.. well that's where theres that Cemetery a bit further up where that Evil womens burried....



I was thinking oh, like a Welsh Urban legend or some historical weird figure or foke lore,  I said nah never heard of that one...



My sister then said,  yeah, you know?  the women who had all them photos of Nanna with her eyes scratched out and her throat slit, and she had all them voodoo dolls and red cotton wound across nannas neck area and then nanna had that operation on her neck soon after and had them ring scar that goes right around.. and all them people died...  they were both in that cult thing.....  



I was like.....hang on a second Caz...  just stop! what the the hell are you saying?  nanna was in a cult?   nanna nanna?  



Did mum not tell you?  how can you not know?   

So I couldn't sleep that night, I currently still live with my parents and all I could think about was asking my mum as soon as she came downstairs. 

(I actually recorded this on my phones voice recorder) 



I would prefer if my sister told me , so I texted her and said I'm going to ask mum in the morning about all this , it sounds bloody interesting, ( hoping I wouldent have too and my sister would instead) but she dident, she just said yeah her name (the Evil lady buried there was called Mary and it's Creepy AF)



So making Coffee I brought it up to her as inconspicuous as I could I diddent know quite how to ask her,   but I mentions Caz (caroline) I was telling her about my trip and she told me about that Women whoes buried there that who had those weird pictures of Nana?    

My mum looked like I just stepped on her toe and wouldn't take it off,  she paused still and was looking at me like she was going to cry.  She said right I'll have to tell you,

She wasn't burried there as such, her remains were put there somewhere as her family disowned her and she had  a paupers funeral, essentially no headstone but put in spare land which just happened to be on the great Orme. 



She (Mary) was my nanas ""friend"", there was a group of them as they were members of the Rosicrucianism order, which is a secret society   you can join today, they are from the 1500's and some orders practice mysticism , symbolism, hidden knowledge,  Some do magic and higher magic.   The FreeMasons apparently birthed out of Rosicrucianism. 



As far as I know my nana was a member of the Order of the Golden and Rosy Cross, a German Rosicrucian organization founded in the 1750s, or possibly to the Societies Rosicrucian in Anglia (SRIA), which was influenced by the former's structure. The SRIA, a UK-based Rosicrucian society, played a significant role in the development of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.   This from my own reshearh as she had a book titled the Golden cross or Goldern rosy cross which I thought was just spiritualisdm  I dident know it was an actural Secret society, I thought it was just some book she found.  but no she was a long standing member as were her friends.  Some are more cultish Orders. 



My mum said really dark bad things happened, and it made waves in America, and Mary was kicked out of the Order she was in as she was suspected to be doing witchcraft, whether taking what she learned from the Order they were in and using it for bad or she was part of some other darker cult.   

This all happened in the 60's and was in one of the Publications that they put out but I haven't been able to find it online if it is online or archiverd, but was known in american puiblications of news about the orders and collectivly decidid she be ousted from entering ANY order related to Rosicrutionists.



This all happened over a few months and she died not long after.    



This lady my nana first took my mum (then 13) to see was on a coach trip to Howarth   (Haworth, a village known for its connection to the Bronte sisters, also has a history and events tied to witchcraft)



When my mum got on the coach and saw this lady my mum knew right away something was bad with her, she looked strange, dressed in old fathomed black clothing, velvet black gloves, a black veil or head dress , black round shades, was in a wheelchair and had a voice box device (electrolarynx) as she had a throat operation. 

my mum was shocked and the lady ""Mary"" just starred at her unkindly and clearly took a dislike to my mum.  This lady was quite elderly maybe late 70's.  



After the order threw her out she had to move from her Bungalow in Manchester, to a home I think as she couldn't look after herself properly,    being in a wheel chair my nana and her friends had to go in there and  move her stuff/ belongings, this is where they found all the BAD stuff,



They were photographs of my Nana with her neck defaced and eyes scratched out,  like loads of them,  Voodoo dolls clearly, depicting her ""friend"" and nanna,  One a male friend close to my nana and a member of the order's  photo had his head cut off and stuck on the floor.  there were dolls of children, one clearly depicting my mum with her legs disfigured and wrapped in red cotton.



This is all very disturbing to find but what happened next was,   unbelievable, 



All within a few months of finding these, my nana had to have emergency neck operation and got a scar that went right around her neck in a ring like was drawn on her photo's, She was then involved in a car accident in Manchester Town center where a car hit her side on in a horrific crash completely destroying her car but only my miracle received injures to... her eyes from the broken glass.  but she never drove again due to how bad the crash was. 



the man she was friends with, whose photo had his head cut out and glued onto the floor 

soon was killed in a freak car accident and was decapitated,  Someone else died but my mum did not explain how but was also in the defaced photos/dolls,   my mum then developed at age of 14 about 4 months later leg and knee problems that the doctors couldn't quite explain how but her cartilage in her knees were now essentially destroyed and she has suffered with bending down and leg problems all her life,



My nana had endless bad luck after this eventually died of multiple cancers in 2008,   mum has endless health problems,   before my nana died she said there's things I can't tell you but will effect you for the rest of your life and told her she wishes she never took you on that trip to Howarth or to meet Mary and she's really sorry.

Mary died not long after all this and never had a proper burial and her remains were put on the Great orme Llandudno unmarked place.



A side note to this story which may be related, and is unexplained is in 2006 I went to stay at the Bull Bay hotel in Anglesey, Wales another peninsula about 30km from Llandudno,  in the room at night in bed I got a strange pulling sensation like a magnetic force tugging me towards the window which overlooked the bay, it felt like two giant dark arms pulling me like a dark entity I've never felt anything like that before,    I forgot about it but 4 years later I went back in 2010 for my dad's 60th and I got put in the same room and low and behold as soon as I turned the light off the feeling came back and I remembered, and it was hard to get out of the feeling of this thing across the bay like dark tentacles pulling me in the windows direction towards the ocean, I'm like what even is this?   I was thinking theory's of it being like maybe magnetic rock in the ocean floor or something and I'm, hallucination with it,  I don't know but it felt dark and unrelenting.,  I soon forgot about it after I left.  but never felt anything that malevolent and dark /primal pulling me.



but after hearing all this on Sunday and it being pretty close to where her remains are it made me remember about it and made me think....., and I just went on google earth out of curiosity and the bull bay hotel room window I was staying in is pretty much directly facing the Llandudno great orme where here remains are,   albeit 30km away across the water. 



I feel like this story needs to be told,  I can't believe it's actually real and happened and nobody knows about it apart from a few people. 



if anyone wants to research and try and find any articles from the 60's I can't find anything yet.

I never like being around her, I don’t know when or  I started feeling this way but it was likely because she never has anything good to say about me.

I never understood her fidgetiness when it comes to a slightly messy place. Oh the pillows are messed up, big deal! when she’s in a room, I often run away. I’ve tried being cold towards her and she just lashes out and gets mad. Victimises herself constantly until I feel bad and the cycle repeats.

My only option is to get married but that’s a bit of a reach. I just feel caged most of the time like I can’t do anything to get out. I’m always happier when I’m not near her

ORIGINAL POST - 

# Lost 20 pounds in 4 weeks - made myself ill

Sooooo...I jumped on Tirz about 5 weeks ago, and it was awesome! No hunger, still had energy, and after a slower start, the pounds were flying off. I only wanted to lose about 30 pounds to get back to my college weight and fitness, so I've been working out lightly (first time in 15 years) and trying to balance my diet.

Thing is, I started playi**​**ng a bit of a game with myself - how little could I eat in a day and still not feel hungry??

Very little, was the answer. For a couple of days, all I ate was a banana for breakfast and a side salad for dinner. And I felt fine! I usually suffer from IBS and acid reflux, and those things just went away. I was never hungry, and the pounds were falling off. What a rush! In week four, I lost 6 pounds in 7 days!

Then one day last week I had a ton of house stuff to do - cut the grass, weed the rose garden, rip out an old vanity, do some work in my car, etc. I didn't sleep well the night before - slight heart palpitations kept me up a lot. But hey, you only get one day off to get those things done, so the next morning I dove in.

I had my banana and coffee, and went out to cut the grass. It was 94 degrees, a heat wave for us. I was feeling a bit woozy, and the heart flutters were continuing. I finished the yard and came and drank a ton of water...then tackled the vanity.

The darn marble top weighed over 120 pounds, and I had to demo the cabinets just to get them out. By this time, I was DEFINITELY feeling ill. Weak, A little dizzy, nauseated, and simply exhausted. Im used to hard work, and like an idiot I couldn't put two and two together to figure out what was going on.

I got the vanity top out into the garage, and just about collapsed. It was there that I somehow decided I would just lay down for a minute on the garage floor and rest a bit. Thats where my wife found me. She thought I was dead! She had to shake me for a full minute to get me to respond. She says I was not coherent, though I remember just feeling like I woke up disoriented.

She got me in the car and took me to the emergency room. Bottom line -

\- extremely dehydrated, as in, risking brain injury I was so dry.

\- very malnourished, to the point of kidneys starting to shut down.

\- heat stroke.

\- heart arrhythmia (PVC's and superventricular tachycardia.)

\- disorientation and vertigo.

I confessed to the doc that I was taking Tirz and dieting, and he gave me quite the lecture. But, he also gave some good coaching on how to balance my eating better while on it, and ways to assess my general health as far as kidney function, dehydration, etc.

Lesson learned! I'm still on Tirzepatide, at the end of week 5, but I'm making sure to eat a balanced diet. This past week, I lost only a little under 2 pounds. But I feel MUCH better.

A cautionary tale for everyone out there!

How do I heal from this?","To give some quick context: I’m 21F, he’s 21M. We dated when we were 18 for about 3 months, long distance. We’ve known each other for like 10 years, we met at summer camp as kids and still go as counselors. The relationship was short, but we were each other’s firsts in basically everything. He broke up with me over video call, but it was mutual-ish and there was no bad blood. After the breakup (Dec 2021, I think), we saw each other at camp the next year and a few times after. There were lingering feelings, but we stayed friends.

Fast forward: we hadn’t seen each other since Aug 2024. Then in July 2025, he randomly snapped me like ""wanna commit some tomfoolery?"" in my college city. I figured he had plans here and just wanted to hang out. I said ""of course, when?"" and he replied “
""up to you, I was thinking of visiting."" So yeah, I caved, and he came to stay (we had a spare room).

I thought it was just friends catching up. But he shows up wearing a white buttonup, brings me a white rose (my favorite flower?!), and starts complimenting me, my hair, how I've lost weight, how I’m ""too smart for law school"", since I mentioned I wanted to change my major. He even put cologne on when I left the room for coffee. We went to lunch and drinks, and I still told myself this was just friendly.

Later we went to a bar. I had 2 beers, he had maybe 3, plus a shot. Things shifted. He touched my hair, played with my hands while I spoke, looked at me like I was a saint, and kissed me. We made out, went back to mine, and while we didn’t sleep together, stuff definitely happened. He held me all night like we were a couple. I hadn’t been with anyone since him, and he knew that. He also knew how much intimacy means to me.

The next morning? He barely looked at me. Just scrolled through TikTok like nothing happened. I was spiraling, texting my friend like ""wtf do I do."" When I brought it up, he acted confused and said, ""how tf am I supposed to know what you’re thinking?"" I motioned to the bed and us, and he literally shrugged and said ""don’t care. life’s a circus, you gotta learn to enjoy it."" I was stunned and had a mental breakdown after he left. He left two hours early and gave me a weird side hug goodbye.

I texted later, asking if it meant anything, and that if it was just a drunk mistake he should've told me, that we are both adults and the ""don't care"" comment hurt me. He said he ""didn’t mean to avoid"" me, it ""just didn’t cross his mind."" Then added he ""probably wouldn’t have done it sober."" That one hit hard. Since then, he’s been sending me snaps and reels, but I haven’t opened any of them. I just don’t know what I’d even say.

I’m not looking to assign blame, I just feel really lost. I thought we were reconnecting in some meaningful way, and now I feel like I got emotionally whiplashed. I keep questioning myself and feeling dumb for letting my guard down. So now I’m sitting with all of this, just wondering, how do you heal from something like this?

This case was suggested back in January, but I couldn't do a write-up on it until now because the trial was still ongoing.

I also had to try and dig up everything on my own and piece this together from various news reports, so I probably made a mistake or missed some details or maybe even have the timeline out of order in parts. This was a big case that had only just concluded, so I tried the best I could. Especially since I'm still working with Google Translate

This case is also a lot more political than I usually cover.

My next write-up shouldn't take this long to do. Or be as long.)

Ljupčo was also a somewhat notable figure in North Macedonia at the time. Born on December 12, 1964, he grew up in the capital of Skopje and was in the public eye as early as the 1990s. He presented himself as a successful construction entrepreneur via his construction company ""Upa Enterprise,"" and considering this period in Macedonian history, construction was a profitable industry.

Ljupčo would make sure his wealth didn't go unnoticed either, as he lived in a fancy high-end house in the city center. While Ljupčo was a notable figure even before the kidnappings, he was also a controversial figure long before then.

Ljupčo was considered one of the founders of the so-called ""urban mafia"" in Skopje due to the projects he often took on and the circumstances behind them. During a small period in the Debar Maalo area, old and small family homes began being torn down for other buildings to be built, and Ljupčo was one of the main figures in having them torn down.

The most infamous building to come from this was the ""Tiffany"" building in 2006. Located at the beginning of the boulevard ""Partizanski Odredi."" The project was filled with ""dubiosities and unclear accounts."" Its height extended higher than it was supposed to be, and the project was besieged by long court battles and calls to have the building demolished. And that was before people started questioning if Ljupčo's construction projects were even legal to begin with.

Because of the controversies with the Tiffany building and the constant controversies and legal battles, Upa Enterprise eventually went bankrupt and became defunct on June 14, 2006. But curiously, the company was registered at the same address where Vanja would later live. While his construction company was a source of controversy for Ljupčo, he was most well-known for his political career.

In 1998, Ljupčo was elected president of the city organization of SDSM in Skopje. SDSM stood for Social Democratic Union of Macedonia, a pro-EU and left-leaning party in Macedonian politics and one still active today. With his part in politics, he got close to many people, including the then director of North Macedonia's intelligence agency, Zoran Verushevski (Who was arrested under accusations that he planned to start a coup).

In the late 1990s, he founded and published the weekly ""Start"", a political newsletter that was decently successful. He tried and failed to create a television station and hoped to become a media magnate. Ljupčo was a pro-Western, left-leaning politician, but sometime in the 2000s, his views shifted toward the right.

Ljupčo would visit Moscow several times, and coincidentally, he began to drift away from the West and more toward Russia and the right. Ljupčo was said to deeply admire a group known as the Night Wolves, a biker organization in Russia with close ties to Putin.

Ljupčo now found himself collaborating with and appearing on pro-Russian media outlets, and even hosted a podcast in which he used to espouse various conspiracy theories, far-right views, and nationalist messages. Ljupčo was also a familiar face to the law and had many arrests to his name.

Since 2000, he had been registered with the Ministry of Interior for tax evasion. In 2002, he was arrested for reporting a false theft from his construction company and in 2005, he was charged with abuse of office and forgery of documents.

However, he never served any jail time and would always be let off with suspended sentences. For the document forgery specifically, he was given a suspended sentence in 2007. Most of the time, Ljupčo was never even indicted for any of the crimes he was arrested for, and whenever he did go to trial, he was always given a suspended sentence.

In 2016, a YouTube channel called ""Nikola Tesla"" began uploading videos, which were recordings of wiretapped conversations, most of which were private and without their knowledge. The conversations were with various MPs and other politicians in North Macedonia. In August 2017, Ljupčo was linked to this channel and arrested for publishing the illegally recorded conversations. Ljupčo was held for only 20 hours and released.

In the summer of 2017, Ljupčo got into a physical altercation with a journalist named Branko Geroski in front of a cafe. During the scuffle, Ljupčo poured red paint all over Branko's head. This incident is what really made Ljupčo known to the public and many right-leaning figures in North Macedonia, including politicians who applauded him for doing this. And now, Ljupčo, a man who began his career as a left-wing activist, was now a folk hero to the Macedonian far right.

In 2019, he played the same wiretapped conversations over a loudspeaker at a political rally during a presidential candidate's campaign. This led to yet another arrest, but he was released with only a suspended sentence. He was also detained for insulting and belittling a police officer.

Ljupčo also had legal troubles in other countries. In 2019, Serbian police arrested him in Belgrade based on a warrant issued by their counterparts in Croatia. This arrest was over an unpaid debt in 2015, when he refused to pay 2,500 euros. He was held for 9 months before being deported. Ljupčo claimed that his Serbian detention was politically motivated.

Ljupčo's next arrest came in June 2020 when he was arrested for refusing to quarantine and self-isolate after returning home from a trip abroad during the COVID-19 pandemic. 2020 also saw him investigated for illegal possession of weapons and explosives.

For all his arrests, Ljupčo also found himself a victim of a crime. On September 17, 2020, Ljupčo left his home near the ""Bunjakovec"" shopping center in Skopje. Almost immediately upon leaving, two people on a motorcycle pulled over, got off the bike and rushed toward him.

Before Ljupčo had time to react, the two men dressed in black and wearing black motorcycle helmets struck him multiple times on the head with metal rods and occasionally hit other parts of his body as well.  Ljupčo tried to fight back, but the two men managed to overpower him. The two men fully intended to beat Ljupčo to death right then and there, but had to flee as this attack happened in public, and soon bystanders and witnesses gathered around, prompting them to flee.

[Bystanders tending to Ljupčo's wounds](https://preview.redd.it/f54pl0flraef1.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd47d8959c9d77c655fcc292a445a09e165786e6)

After the attackers fled, Ljupčo was rushed to a private clinic, and his condition was described as life-threatening. He had suffered several hematomas on the head, a broken arm and several blunt force injuries to the rest of his body. Ljupčo ended up making a full recovery.

The attack, which was labelled as an assassination attempt, received widespread condemnation across the country. The police were put under immense pressure to arrest those responsible. It seemed like it should be easy; those responsible were captured by CCTV cameras, and other cameras captured them before they covered their faces.

The police detained several people suspected of being involved, but no prosecutions ever took place; those arrested were released, and the case is considered unsolved. However, many have publicly accused the North Macedonian government of knowing and sheltering the attackers. After this incident, Ljupčo would carry a firearm with him at all times.

Lastly, in 2021, he obstructed an investigation in which he wasn't a suspect. Financial officers were trying to question his wife over an undisclosed matter, and Ljupčo kept screaming and shouting at them during the questioning.

On December 12, 2022, on his 58th birthday, Ljupčo finally formed his own political party, to which he was elected party leader in a landslide. The party was a pro-Russian far-right party named ""Desna,"" which literally translates to ""The Right"" in English.

The party was also highly nationalist, and one of its guidelines for members was that they needed to be ""ethnically pure"" Macedonians. And spoke out against the number of ethnic Albanians in North Macedonia's other political parties.

They were anti-immigration, anti-European Union, wanted to withdraw from the Prespa Agreement and remove the word ""North"" from the country's name and were also anti-NATO and wanted North Macedonia to leave the organization.

The party frequently referred to NATO as ""Atlanticists"" and felt they and the ""Zionists"" were conspiring to make North Macedonia weaker. They were also against joining the European Union and parroted Russia's narrative that the war in Ukraine was just a ""Special Military Operation,"" which Desna supported.

On May 5, 2023, Ljupčo was subjected to his final and most recent arrest. He was stopped at a police checkpoint. Ljupčo was returning home with a friend after searching for gold at an abandoned mine. The police discovered an unlicensed firearm in his vehicle and promptly detained him. As was the norm, Ljupčo faced no jail time. Now, how was he connected to the three suspects?

Velibor met Ljupčo sometime in 2018 due to a need for election observers. Ljupčo also knew Velibor from his involvement in the municipal party in Veles before his resignation. When Ljupčo formed Desna, Velibor was invited. While Velibor joined the party, he often fought with other members of the party.

Ljupčo described Velibor as ""ambitious and greedy for money."" One day, he got into an argument with another party member, Stefan Dimovski, over the purchase and sale of agricultural machinery, in which Velibor didn't pay everything he was supposed to. This almost led to a fight at a party meeting, which required Ljupčo's intervention. Velibor was also lent 1,000 Swiss Francs from a party member living in Switzerland, which he never paid back.

Velibor had known Bore Videvski since the two were children and had been close friends since elementary school. So, when Velibor, who was now friends with Ljupčo, wanted to expand Desna and get it the required number of signatures to be registered as a party, he turned to Bore. Bore gave his signature and later joined Desna, as he shared a few of the ideas on their platform, mostly concerning a church and a possible name change.

As mentioned, information on Vlatko Keshishov and his life before joining Desna is sparse, but we know a fair bit about his involvement in the party. Vlatko worked as a janitor and cook at Desna's head office and often served coffee and drinks to visitors. While the job didn't seem significant, Vlatko was much more.

This job was unpaid, and he did it out of devotion toward Ljupčo and as mentioned, he was less a custodian and more Ljupčo's right-hand man, and as explained, he seemed ""subserivant toward him."" Vlatko even lived at Desna's office and slept in the same room as him. In fact, Desna's officer was where Vlatko was arrested, and when the police arrived, he said, ""Where were you? We have been waiting for you until now.""

During the late hours of December 2, Velibor, Bore and Blatko would all confess. If his digging for gold in abandoned mines wasn't any indication, Ljupčo and his party were struggling financially. For several months, Ljupčo was planning a series of kidnappings to profit from the ransoms.

They even dug the holes years in advance, which they planned to hide their victims in before even deciding who the victim would be. They planned to hide them in the hole and would let them out once the ransom was paid. They then purchased masks, gloves, Motorola phones, duct tape, a sleeping bag, and weapons to carry out the plan. Velibor and Vlatko then went to a gas station and bought two cans of gasoline.

Eventually, they settled on Vanja because of her grandfather's wealth. But they also needed a car that couldn't be linked to them to carry out the kidnappings. Because of his long-running grievance with him, Velibor suggested that they go after Panche.

On November 22, they drove by Panche's home to see if the plan was viable and how risky a target he was. At around 5:30-6:00 A.M, on November 23, they returned to his home. Vlatko was waiting for them at a railway station in the Renault while Velibor, Bore and Ljupčo went to his house.

They waited until 7:45 a.m. for Panche to come out on his own. When he didn't leave, Ljupčo ordered someone to knock on the door. Since Panche knew Velibor, it was decided that Bore would be the one to knock.

When Bore knocked on the door, Panche came to open it, and with that, everyone rushed him. The three man, donning their mask, pushed him inside, and when he started screaming, Velibor covered his mouth with his hand. Velibor began to tie Panche's hands while Ljupčo stole his phone and car keys.

They then forced Panche into the trunk of his own vehicle and drove off. They drove to the Rudnik area so they could throw Panche's phone into a ravine and fill the vehicle up with the gas they bought so they wouldn't have to go to a gas station.

Velibor then forced Panche into the hole they had dug, and afterward, Ljupčo walked up to the hole and shot Panche once in the temple with a 9 mm pistol, killing him instantly, something that all three said they weren't expecting. But regardless, it was time to move on to Vanja.

They planned on kidnapping Vanja the very next day, but on November 24, they were caught in a traffic jam and by the time it had cleared, school was out and Vanja had returned home. As November 24, 2023, was a Friday, they had to wait until the weekend was over to try again.

On November 27 at 7:29 a.m., Vlatko waited outside Vanja's apartment in Panche's stolen car while Bore and Velibor used a screwdriver to open and sneak in through the back entrance.

The two then went under the stairs and waited for Vanja to start walking down them. When Vanja walked down the stairs, Bore suddenly rushed her, grabbing her with one hand and using the other to cover her mouth with tape.

They then dragged her under the stairs, where it was dark and no potential for a passerby to see them. There, the two tied her up and forced her into the sleeping bag and then the sleeping bag into the trunk, where they drove off.

After driving, they broke Vanja's phone so the signal couldn't be tracked. This was why Vanja never appeared in any of the CCTV cameras despite her phone last pinging in a high-traffic area. They then met up with Ljupčo, and he joined them in the Renault. This is what was caught by the CCTV cameras.

They drove to the fields in Brazda, where they removed the sleeping bag from the trunk. After opening the bag and removing the tape, Velibor claimed that he realized a mistake had been made and saw that Vanja was a child. According to him, Ljupčo had told them they were kidnapping a businesswoman in her 40s.

According to Velibor, he begged Ljupčo not to kill her since she was kidnapped by mistake, but Ljupčo ignored him. He took a picture of Vanja and interrogated her about her parents before coldly covering Vanja's face with a pillow that someone had littered in the area. Then, using the pillow to muffle the shot, he shot her in the head, killing Vanja instantly.

They then buried Vanja's body in the hole and set Panche's Citroen on fire. They also left Vanja's phone in the car so it would be destroyed by the flames.

Ljupčo then put the guns and Motorola phones in a blue backpack, which he gave to another member of Desna, an employee at the national bank named Zoran Davitkov. Ljupčo ordered Zoran to either destroy the bag or hide it.

As for the evidence he didn't hand over to Zoran, Ljupčo forced them all to buy WD-40 spray to clean the tools they used and destroy any traces.

A few days later, Ljupčo called Velibor again. Apparently, Ljupčo was at the Turkish border and called him so he could tell Velibor to remind Zoran to destroy the evidence he had given him.

There was one more thing as well. Some accused Aleksandar Gjorcevski, Vanja's father, of being involved. They claimed that he provided them with information about Vanja's movements and told them she'd be alone during her walk to school.

Based on this statement, Aleksandar was arrested and questioned. He denied any involvement in his daughter's murder and insisted that he didn't even know Ljupčo. Nonetheless, he was charged with the crime alongside the other 4.

[Aleksandar after his arrest](https://preview.redd.it/3tjamzqvraef1.png?width=1189&format=png&auto=webp&s=bea1d44b4c8187f85e4ef879de2ad677a34629c2)

On December 3, under heavy police guard, Vlatko led police to the fields in Brazda and pointed to where the pit had been dug, a small location off the side of a dirt road. The police dug until a nose and a leg appeared. They then excavated Vanja's body.

That same evening, the other suspects led the police in Veles deep into the woods. They brought them deep into the forest outside of a village called Rudnik, 15 km away from Panche's home. There, they pointed to a car tarpaulin and soil. The tarpaulin was removed to reveal a three-meter pit with Panche's body. This pit was much deeper; it took three hours for Panche's body to be excavated, and the police needed help from firefighters to do so.

[The pit where Panche was found](https://preview.redd.it/6dji3dlyraef1.png?width=577&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b8378e59df72720cd4c127ad6b0fbd55ae96fa2)

The pit had been dug before the murder for illegal gold mining, and the killers just took advantage of it. The police themselves said that the body likely never would've been found if the killers didn't confess. It was very out of the way.

Vanja's autopsy contradicted Velibor's account. According to the examination, there were no signs of suffocation or a pillow forced into her face, and she had been shot once in the back of the head from half a meter away while she was kneeling. The medical examiner also noted marks on her wrists and ankles from being tied up. There were no signs of sexual assault. Adhesive tape was also still on her mouth, and DNA extracted from the tape was a match for Velibor.

Meanwhile, Panche had also been executed with a single gunshot wound right behind the ear, with an empty 9 mm cartridge case found near the pit. Panche's body also showed signs of being restrained and physical abuse, indicating he had been beaten severely before he was shot. Both had been killed mere hours after they were first kidnapped.

The police then searched Desna's headquarters and found the Renault Kangoo, which they confiscated. The mud on the tires was a match to that in Brazda. Hairs and fibres were also found belonging to Ljupčo.

Then, on December 5, the police found two pistols in Skopje, one of which matched the bullet that killed Panche, and both were registered to Ljupčo. Ljupčo's phone also pinged at both crime scenes. But Ljupčo himself was nowhere to be found. Something to be expected considering the phone call Velibor received.

On November 30, Ljupčo had his attorney drive him to Belgrade, Serbia. His attorney was innocent and ignorant of Ljupčo's involvement in the murders. He also had a legitimate reason for going to Serbia; he had a medical check-up scheduled in the city. After arriving, he spent two nights at a hotel in Belgrade.

On December 2, 46-year-old Stefan Dimkovski arrived to pick up Ljupčo. Together, they crossed the border into Bulgaria. They then drove from Bulgaria and into Turkey, where they stopped in Balıkesir. Once in the city, Ljupčo rented a house in his real name and paid for it one month in advance. He planned on staying in Turkey for a little while before going to Moscow.

Meanwhile, the police back in his home country issued an Interpol red notice for Ljupčo and simply waited for any news from their Turkish counterparts. But the police were able to arrest Stefan at the Macedonian border.

Stefan began his return to North Macedonia immideately after Ljupčo was declared a suspect. Stefan denied any knowledge of what Ljupčo had done. However, he couldn't exactly deny driving him to Turkey as he uploaded a picture of him approaching the Osman Gazi Bridge on December 3.

Meanwhile, the four they did arrest were indicted and remanded into pre-trial detention. They had to be kept in separate cells to protect them from the other inmates. But the inmates still made things hell for them, constantly shouting at and insulting them and banging on the walls and bars to make sleep impossible.

They also interrogated and screamed at the four for answers as to why they took part in the murders. Velibor said that he wanted money to pay for his own daughter's wedding, which sent them all into an uproar. Meanwhile, Aleksandar refused to say anything.

This attitude also extended to their legal defence. No lawyer in the country willingly wanted to take on the case, so all four of the suspects needed to have an attorney assigned to them. But with how outraged North Macedonia was, the court refused to disclose the names of their lawyers for their safety. The outrage was so strong that many were calling for North Macedonia to bring back the death penalty.

On December 5, Turkish police came across Ljupčo wandering down the side of the highway in Balıkesir. As the local police detained him, Ljupčo didn't offer any resistance and went quietly. Ljupčo also wouldn't say anything to the local police either.

On April 30, 2024, a Turkish court approved the extradition request, and he was flown back to North Macedonia on May 16. As soon as he landed at Skopje's airport, he was placed under arrest and indicted.

[Ljupčo upon his return to North Macedonia](https://preview.redd.it/si1v0v83saef1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f8f333184b874202afdd1f55364c1d12acf570a)

He denied any involvement in the murder, and his supporters and even the far-right in other countries didn't waste any time claiming he was being framed as part of a politically motivated prosecution.

Now with all 5 suspects in one place, it was decided they would all be tried together, and Panche and Vanja's murders would be merged into one single case. The trial would be delayed a few times, though, partly because of the prosecution merging the cases and Bore's health issues relating to his kidneys.

The trial began on September 20, 2024, and all five pleaded not guilty. The evidence against Velibor, Bore, Vlatko and Ljupčo was overwhelming, so despite their pleas, it was a foregone conclusion that they would be found guilty.

The prosecution was seeking a life sentence for Velibor, Bore, Vlatko and Ljupčo. As for Aleksandar, they were seeking a harsh sentence, but since they didn't believe he knew Vanja would be killed and wasn't physically involved. So with that in mind, Aleksandar was facing 10 years.

[The trial](https://preview.redd.it/v7co52v5saef1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=79f2324f4bdac9147397788aecc5373907d79224)

The three who did confess recanted their statements. When it came to Aleksandar, the evidence was a bit less compelling. While Velibor and Vlatko tried to minimize their role in the killings, both Ljupčo and Aleksandar denied any involvement at all.

It did come out in trial that Aleksandar was strangely pessimistic during the search. When Vanja's mother testified, she said that Aleksandar wouldn't explain why he believed Vanja was kidnapped and once said, ""There is nothing more to be done"". Aleksandar's lawyer said that he believed that kidnapping theory so strongly simply because he couldn't come to terms with the thought of Vanja running away. This was also how Vanja's mother rationalized his behaviour.

The prosecution also argued that Aleksandar was said to be an unemployed drug addict with severe gambling debts, which would account for his motive. Aleksandar's relatives rejected that claim and told the court he kicked his drug habit decades ago, again for the sake of his family.

Velibor once again claimed that he didn't know Ljupčo was going to execute the two so callously and repeated his claim that he tried urging him to spare Vanja. Vlatko, who was known for being fiercely loyal to Ljupčo, also turned on him. He said that Ljupčo had betrayed him by getting him involved in his plan, and once demanded that he be removed from the courtroom because he was too ""scared"" to testify while he was present. Velibor's exact statement was ""I was just a tool – for six years I supported him, gave him my soul, got him out of prison, ran after lawyers. In the end, he put me in prison for something I never even imagined.""

[Velibor during the trial](https://preview.redd.it/ilnmd7j7saef1.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=33f18f6eff0f666e8921b50a520b383c8f91a485)

Vlatko said that Ljupčo ""betrayed"" him by both involving him in this plot and letting a false narrative spread about how involved he was. According to him, he simply stood watch in a different vehicle and wasn't actually aware of what the others were doing. According to him, he first learned that Panche and Vanja were even missing via posts on social media.

[Vlatko during the trial](https://preview.redd.it/ykywf1i9saef1.png?width=665&format=png&auto=webp&s=9770de485a81c5299c5f39d264abbabb817e3f4e)

The prosecution argued that the kidnapping for ransom was just an excuse and that everyone had been planning to murder the two all along. The prosecution showed the CCTV footage of the Citroen and Renault meeting up, and CCTV footage on the same street as Velibor's house showing him loading a shovel into the Renault. Although what motive they would've had to kill Vanja in such a cold-blooded manner remains uncertain.

Bore denied any involvement at all. According to him, he had an alibi. He told the court that on November 21-November 24 and on November 27, he was at work all day and didn't have any time to join up with the three.

As for why he'd confess if that was the case, he claimed the police tortured him and coerced a confession out of him. He also said he didn't retract his confession earlier out of fear that the police might retaliate, but since the trial was open and public, he felt more confident speaking the truth.

However, he was unable to call up anyone who could corroborate his alibi; he wasn't scheduled to work the hours mentioned, and he was seen on camera with Velibor preparing for something. He claimed that the footage, shot at Veles, wasn't recording him planning Panche's murder but instead to start a petition for the Ohrid Archbishopric to change its name to the Church of North Macedonia and that they were discussing how to get signatures.

[Bore during the trial](https://preview.redd.it/4n2sua8bsaef1.png?width=1017&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb629d3dc5285abd2dddff968502a9117a9d2d4c)

Velibor, Vlatko and Bore's attorneys all said the same thing: that they were reluctant participants who didn't know Ljupčo was going to kill Panche or Vanja. They told the court that only Ljupčo should be convicted of murder and that the others should only be convicted of kidnapping but acquitted of murder.

Ljupčo proclaimed his innocence, said there was no evidence against him and decried the trial as an act of political persecution. He also said that he had an innocent explanation for being in Turkey. He was there for medical reasons, research and was even in talks with a local Turk who spoke Macedonian so he could appear on a podcast in Turkey. He also said he was there to prove that a revolutionary figure named Gotse Delchev wasn't killed by the Ottoman Army but instead ""the Supreme Leaders"".

As for airline tickets be bought for Moscow and Minsk, Belarus, he told the court that he wasn't planning on fleeing and staying there. Rather, he wanted to go to Russia to get some Novgorod leaflets and copies of documents from the Moscow public library to bring home with him.

He also argued that his extradition back to Macedonia was unlawful. According to him, a Turkish prosecutor met with him after his arrest to ask if there was any possibility that the charges were politically motivated and that he could face torture or persecution in North Macedonia before they considered extraditing him.

He accused the North Macedonian police of torturing and persecuting him, but he told the Turkish prosecutor that such a thing wouldn't happen simply because he was too ashamed of the state of North Macedonia to admit what he believed to be the truth.

Ljupčo's lawyer argued that the only evidence against him was the other three's statements and that their word should be questioned as they are all trying to seek a lesser sentence.

[Ljupčo during the trial](https://preview.redd.it/pzmk37ycsaef1.png?width=730&format=png&auto=webp&s=e41c5e2d7caf89f21ab20653c626474cb8786196)

As for Aleksandar, while the 4 defendants were emotional, passionate or angry when telling their side of the story, Aleksandar seemed mostly sad and dejected, even telling the court that ""a part of me died too"". Aleksandar's lawyer pointed out that the only evidence was their confession, which he described as ""First they took his daughter, now they're trying to take his dignity"". To him, Aleksander was another victim of the gang.

As mentioned, Aleksandar was accused of feeding information to the four to aid in the kidnapping with full knowledge of what might happen to his daughter. But his attorney said that the only evidence was their word. Nothing else could be uncovered to even prove Aleksandar knew them, let alone aiding them. And, they were right; the only evidence the prosecution put forward as to his guilt was their original statements. They weren't even standing by anymore.

And while the prosecution accused Aleksandar of communicating with Ljupčo to coordinate his daughter's abduction, they admitted that they couldn't produce any of these calls or messages. But they defended their accusation by stating that Ljupčo regularly deleted his texts or used different phones.

Meanwhile, Aleksandar's phones were seized and examined upon his arrest, and they showed no signs of communicating with any numbers leading up to the abduction or that anything had ever been deleted. Velibor also said that he, Bore and Vlatko had never seen Aleksandar before his arrest.

There was also another issue. Vanja and her sister lived with their mother while Aleksandar lived in a separate apartment. Since they lived with their mother, the school only notified her. So, Aleksandar wouldn't know that Vanja was walking to school alone unless somebody had told him, and Vanja's mother denied ever telling him.

[Aleksandar during the trial](https://preview.redd.it/a2c4cd3gsaef1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=c563a75c5d5d5aff2b76a9bf0a57e181b1fa782f)

On June 25, 2025, Ljupčo Palevski Palčo, Velibor Manev, Bore Videvski and Vlatko Keshishev were all found guilty of the double murder of Panche Zhezhovski and Vanja Gjorcevska, and for their punishment, all four received a life sentence. On top of their life sentences, the four received additional 10-year sentences for the kidnappings.

Meanwhile, Aleksandar Gjorcevski was acquitted and released. The court determined that the prosecution had failed to present any real evidence implicating him and that Aleksander's guilt hadn't been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. It was also stated by some that they didn't need Aleksandar's insider knowledge to carry out the crime.

Although Aleksandar's lawyer got his client acquitted, he told reporters that this wasn't a victory since, if the murder was premeditated from the very beginning, Aleksandar was left without any answers for why his daughter had been murdered.

Meanwhile, the prosecution announced its intention to appeal his acquittal. They admitted that they didn't have any new or additional evidence but stated that no one aside from either him or Vanja's mother could know that Vanja would be walking to school alone that day without her sister. Therefore, they said that his involvement was an ""indisputable fact.""

The attorneys for the convicted also announced their intention to appeal the convictions. Ljupčo's lawyer called the entire trial a circus and that there was no evidence. Meanwhile, Velibor, Bore, and Vlatko once again argued that they didn't know a murder was going to happen, so they should've been treated with leniency. Vlatko's lawyer especially argued that leading the police to the bodies counted as a mitigating factor.

As for Ljupčo's other two accomplices, Stefan Dimovski appears not to have been convicted of anything and denied helping him flee the country. He appeared as a witness at the trial. Zoran Davitkov, the bank employee, Ljupčo, was told to destroy evidence. Well, the first statements implicating him didn't come until the trial began. The investigation into Zoran's role in the crime began on June 20, 2025, and he has so far denied any involvement and labelled the defendant's accusations as false.

And finally, what happened to Ljupčo's party, Densa? Even though its founder murdered an elderly hairdresser he didn't know and a 14-year-old child, not even a full year after founding the party, and is now one of the most hated men in the country, the party is still around.

A new leader was elected, and he was a good friend of Ljupčo. While all four had their membership frozen, the new leader stood by Ljupčo and made it so that one of Densa's positions is that Ljupčo was subjected to a political prosecution.

Many called for the party to be officially deregistered, and it was labelled by North Macedonia's Interior Minister as a ""criminal den"" subject to foreign influence and not a political party. The official opposition party at the time, a conservative-leaning one, was also outraged by Desna's continued existence and condemned the government for ""protecting"" Ljupčo and giving Desna any legitimacy.

In spite of all the bad press, Desna was allowed to keep their party status and officially ran in the 2024 parliamentary Macedonian elections, which was also the first parliamentary election to feature Desna. They received zero financial contributions and only 456 votes, making it the third-worst showing of any official party in that year's election cycle.

The party's influence in North Macedonian politics is negligible and is well on its way to becoming defunct.

**Insulation Technology**

Keeping beverages at the desired temperature for extended periods is a hallmark of a high-quality water bottle. Advanced insulation technologies, such as double-walled vacuum insulation, are employed to minimize heat transfer. This system creates a vacuum between the inner and outer layers of the bottle, effectively preventing conduction and convection. Some models even incorporate a thin layer of copper plating between the stainless steel walls, further enhancing thermal retention.

**Lid and Seal Design**

A well-designed lid and seal are essential for preventing leaks and spills, as well as maintaining the temperature of your drink. High-quality water bottles feature leak-proof lids with durable silicone seals that create a tight, airtight closure. The lid may incorporate a one-handed push-button operation, a twist-and-pour mechanism, or a wide-mouth opening for easy filling and cleaning. The materials used in the lid, such as BPA-free plastic or stainless steel, contribute to its overall durability and safety.**Exterior Coating**

The exterior finish of a water bottle not only enhances its aesthetic appeal but also provides protection against scratches, abrasions, and condensation. Powder coating is a popular choice due to its durability and resistance to wear and tear. It creates a textured surface that improves grip and prevents the bottle from slipping out of your hand. Some bottles feature specialized coatings that are antimicrobial or UV-resistant, adding an extra layer of protection.

**Base Construction**

The base of a water bottle is frequently enough overlooked, but it plays a vital role in stability and preventing damage.A reinforced base made of durable materials, such as stainless steel or impact-resistant plastic, protects the bottle from dents and scratches when placed on rough surfaces. Some models incorporate a silicone boot or non-slip base to provide added stability and prevent the bottle from sliding around.

Key features of well-built water bottles:

 Durable 18/8 stainless steel construction
 Double-walled vacuum insulation for temperature retention
 Leak-proof lid with a durable silicone seal
 Powder-coated exterior for scratch resistance and improved grip
* Reinforced base for added stability

**What size of water bottle is best for my needs?**

The ideal water bottle size depends on your individual hydration needs and lifestyle. If you're primarily using the bottle for short workouts or daily commutes, a smaller size (16-20 ounces) may be sufficient.

0:00Hello, good morning everyone. The peace0:02of the Lord Jesus Christ of Nazareth.0:05May God bless you, keep you, lift you0:08up, and empower you on this day called0:10today in the name of Jesus.

When you0:20subscribe and leave a like, YouTube0:22understands that you're enjoying the0:24video. recommend it to others who need a0:27word who need to be more than blessed in0:30the name of Jesus. My life before that0:32fateful day was a tangle of asphalt,0:35roaring engines, and the loneliness0:37inherent in long roads. I was a truck0:39driver. I'm 48 years old and spent more0:43time behind the wheel than with my0:45family. The routine was relentless. Cold0:47early mornings, bitter coffee, and the0:50constant pressure of tight deadlines. My0:53truck, a metal giant with over a decade0:55of service, was my second home, and the0:58landscapes that passed by the window, my1:00only companions. My name is Eduardo, and1:04my existence was as linear as the1:06highways I traveled. Faith. Faith was1:09something distant, an abstract concept I1:12saved for Sundays, when I sometimes1:14accompanied my wife and children to1:16church, more out of social duty than1:18genuine conviction. I believed in hard1:21work, in paying the bills, and in1:23putting bread on the table. The rest for1:26me was idle talk, something to worry1:29about. When retirement came knocking, it1:31never came. I drove along BR53,1:35a stretch I knew like the back of my1:37hand, laden with a valuable load of1:39electronics. Fatigue was beginning to1:42take its toll. The result of a night of1:44poor sleep and a journey that had1:46already lasted more than 12 hours. My1:48eyes burned and the coffee I had drank1:51hours earlier was no longer effective. I1:54remember blinking for just a moment, a1:56blink that lasted an eternity. When I1:59opened my eyes, the world was upside2:01down, the deafening noise of metal2:03twisting. The smell of burning rubber2:06and the brutal impact were the last2:08sensory registers before darkness2:10swallowed me. My truck had overturned,2:13and I, trapped in the wreckage, felt the2:16life drain from me. There was no pain.2:19No, not immediately. Just a feeling of2:22weightlessness, as if I were floating. I2:24looked down and saw an inert body2:27crushed under the weight of the truck.2:29It was a surreal scene, as if I were a2:31spectator in a tragic film. Help arrived2:34quickly. Sirens piercing the air, but I2:37was no longer there. My consciousness,2:40or what remained of it, was pulled into2:42an unknown dimension. It wasn't a dream,2:44nor a hallucination. It was real, more2:47real than anything I had ever2:49experienced. I was dragged by an2:51invisible force, a current that carried2:54me toward an abyss. The air became2:56dense, heavy, and the previously2:58non-existent heat began to envelop me. A3:01suffocating heat that seemed to burn the3:03very soul. The darkness was absolute,3:06denser than any starless night. There3:08was no light, not even a shred of hope.3:11And then the sounds began. They weren't3:13screams of despair, but deep whales,3:16moans that seemed to come from millions3:18of throats, a sheep of pain and regret3:20that echoed in the vastness of that3:22place. I tried to scream, but my voice3:25made no sound. I tried to move, but my3:28spiritual body seemed paralyzed. Panic3:31invaded me. An icy terror that made me3:34question everything I believed. Where3:36was I? Why was I there? Me, an ordinary3:40man with my flaws and virtues. but who3:42always tried to be honest and3:44hardworking. It made no sense as I was3:47dragged by that invisible current. I3:49began to see figures, shadows moving in3:52the darkness. They weren't demons with3:54horns and trident like in horror movies.3:57They were human figures contorted in3:59agony, trapped in a suffering that4:01seemed eternal. Their faces were4:03unrecognizable, disfigured by pain and4:06despair. I heard them whisper inaudible4:09words, but filled with indescribable4:11torment. That place wasn't purgatory,4:13nor limbo. It was hell, and I was in it.4:16Reality struck me like a bolt of4:18lightning, and fear turned into despair.4:21I didn't want to be there. I didn't4:23deserve it, or did I? Questions raced4:26through my mind, while darkness and4:28laments enveloped me more and more. As I4:31was dragged by that invisible current, I4:33began to make out faces in the gloom.4:36They weren't strangers, but people I'd4:38known in life, some of them public4:40figures, who had brought joy and4:42inspiration to millions. I remember4:44seeing a famous comedian, the one who4:46always made everyone laugh with his4:48jokes and unique personas. He was there,4:51his face once so expressive, now twisted4:54in silent agony, his eyes empty, staring4:57into nothingness. It shocked me deeply.5:00How could someone who spread so much5:02happiness be in that place of torment?5:05My mind refused to accept it, I thought.5:08But he was a good person. He did so much5:10good. And then the answer, clear as5:13thunder, echoed not in my ears, but5:15directly in my consciousness. It wasn't5:18a human voice, but a towering presence5:20that filled all space and time, a voice5:23that radiated authority, and at the same5:26time a profound sadness. Eduardo, she5:29said, this place was not made for you,5:32nor for any of my children. This is the5:34fate of those who rejected me, who chose5:36their own paths, ignoring my truth and5:39my love. The voice continued, and each5:42word was like a blade that cut through5:44the layers of my self-sufficiency and my5:46spiritual blindness. The one you see and5:49so many others here lived lives that, in5:52the eyes of men, seemed worthy. They5:54achieved fame, wealth, applause. They5:57brought laughter and entertainment, but5:59they forgot me. They exchanged eternity6:02for fleeting moments. True wealth for6:04the illusion of material things. It's6:07not enough to be good in the eyes of the6:09world. You must have a relationship with6:11me. Live in truth and in righteousness.6:14As the voice spoke, scenes from my own6:16life began to unfold before me like a6:19fast-paced movie. I saw myself in front6:22of my truck, ignoring my wife's please6:25for me to spend more time with my6:27children. I saw myself prioritizing an6:30urgent delivery over attending my6:32youngest son's graduation. I remembered6:34the times when fatigue and stress had6:36made me rude to the people who loved me.6:39I saw my worries about money, about the6:41next load, about gas, overriding any6:44thought about the purpose of my6:46existence, or what truly mattered. The6:48voice didn't accuse me, but the truth of6:51my choices was painfully evident. I had6:54built a life focused on having and6:56doing, completely forgetting about being6:58and connecting with the divine. The7:00irony was cruel. I, a truck driver, was7:04laden with emptiness. The voice then7:06showed me that hell was not an arbitrary7:08punishment, but the natural consequence7:10or separation from God. It was a place7:13where souls lived in the total absence7:15of their light, their love, their peace.7:18The suffering I felt and saw was imposed7:21by a sadistic being. but the7:23manifestation of the existential

7:25emptiness of those who chose to live for

7:27themselves far from the source of all

7:29life. The darkness was the absence of

7:32divine light, the warmth, the absence of

7:34its refreshment, the laments, the echo

7:37of longing and belated repentance. I  
7:40understood in that instant that

7:42salvation was not a matter of rituals or

7:44belonging to a specific religion, but of

7:46genuine surrender, of a personal and

7:49ongoing relationship with the creator. I

7:51felt a regret so deep it seemed to tear

7:54at my soul, my heart, even in its

7:56spiritual form, achd with the

7:58realization of my ignorance and my

8:00arrogance. I had wasted so many

8:02opportunities, neglected so many signs.

8:06The voice then, with a tone of hope that

8:08broke through the darkness, said,

8:10""Eduardo, there is still time. You were

8:13brought here to see, to understand, to  
8:15have one last chance to choose, not to

8:18stay. The decision is yours. Will you

8:21continue on the path that brought you

8:23here? Or will you choose a new path, a

8:26path of truth and life with me? That

8:29question struck me with the force of a

8:31million thunderbolts. It was a second

8:33chance, an undeserved gift in the midst

8:35of despair. I didn't deserve it, but it

8:38was offered to me. Hope was lit within

8:40me. A small flame in an ocean of  
8:43darkness. I wanted to change. I needed

8:46to change. If you've made it this far,

8:48it's because something in this story

8:50resonates with you. It's not that

8:52feeling that life pulls us down paths

8:54that perhaps aren't ours or that we've  
8:57left something important aside. If this  
9:00narrative touched you, made you reflect,

9:02or made you curious to know the outcome

9:04of Eduardo's journey, then I invite you

9:07to take a step simple yet meaningful.

9:46the sunset, calling someone you haven't

9:49spoken to in a while, or even giving

9:51yourself a minute of silence in the

9:53middle of the day. Your experience can

9:55inspire many others. Let's build a

9:58community that truly connects. The

10:00light, or what I could come to

10:02understand as the absence of darkness,

10:04began to emerge. It wasn't a blinding

10:07light, but a gentle brightening that1

0:09gradually replaced the darkness. I felt

10:12myself being pulled back, not by the

10:14current from before, but by a gentle and

10:16welcoming force. The whales dissipated,

10:19and the infernal heat gave way to a

10:21feeling of freshness and relief that

10:23seemed to heal every cell of my being. I

10:26knew I was returning, but to where? to

10:28my body crushed in the truck's cab. The

10:31idea filled me with sudden apprehension,

10:33but the peace that enveloped me was  
10:35greater than any physical fear. It was

10:37as if I were being reborn, not just in

10:40body, but in spirit. The awakening was

10:42slow and confusing. The first thing I

10:45felt was a throbbing pain throughout my

10:47body, a pain so intense that for a

10:50moment I wished I were back in that

10:52painless darkness. But then, a nurse's

10:54voice rang in my ears, distant at first.  
10:58then clearer. He's waking up. The

11:00patient is waking up. I opened my eyes

11:03with difficulty. The white light from

11:05the ceiling of a hospital blinded me for  
11:07a moment. My head spun and nausea it hit

11:10me. I was in a bed with wires and tubes

11:13connected to me. The constant sound of  
11:15hospital machines filled the room. My

11:18family was there. My wife, her eyes, red  
11:20and swollen from crying, held my hand

11:23tightly. My children, now teenagers,

11:26looked at me with a mixture of relief

11:28and concern. I was alive. The days that

11:31followed were a mix of physical pain and

11:33deep spiritual reflection. The doctors  
11:36said it was a miracle I had survived the

11:38accident with the injuries I suffered,

11:41multiple fractures, a severe concussion,

11:43and internal bleeding. I spent over a

11:46month in the hospital, and the recovery

11:48would be long with months of physical

11:51therapy. But for me, the true recovery  
11:53wasn't of the body, but of the soul, the

11:55image of that place, the faces I saw,

11:58and above all, the words of the eternal  
12:01voice were engraved in my mind and

12:03heart. I was no longer the same Eduardo,

12:06the truck driver who lived for work and

12:08material possessions. I had experienced

12:11eternity, and because of this, my

12:13perspective on life had radically

12:15changed. The conversations in my

12:17hospital bed were no longer about the  
12:19next load or the bills to pay. They were

12:22about faith, about the purpose of life,

12:25about what truly mattered. My wife, who

12:28had always been more spiritual than I,  
12:30listened to my descriptions with tears

12:32in her eyes, understanding the depth of

12:35my transformation. My children, curious

12:37and a little frightened by the story,

12:40began to ask me questions about God and

12:42the afterlife, I found myself sharing  
12:45for the first time in my life the  
12:47urgency of living each day with a  
12:49greater purpose of not postponing what

12:51is eternal in the name of what is

12:53fleeting. I had realized that life was a

12:55precious gift and that every choice, no

12:58matter how small, had eternal weight.  
13:01The overtime hours that took me away

13:03from my family. The opportunities to  
13:05show love that I missed. The way I

13:07judged people instead of understanding

13:09them. All of this was reflected in a new

13:12light. It wasn't about being perfect. I

13:14learned it was about the desire to seek

13:17truth, to love God and others with all

13:19my heart. It was about the path, not

13:22just the destination. My vision of

13:24success had shattered and in its place

13:27emerged a new definition that of a life

13:29aligned with divine principles where

13:32love, compassion, and faith were the

13:34true fuels of my journey. I didn't know

13:37what the future held for me career-wise,

13:39whether I would return to driving trucks

13:41or find a new path. But one thing was

13:44certain, my life would never be the

13:46same. The second chance I was given

13:48wasn't just to survive the accident, but

13:51to truly live with a new purpose and a

13:53new direction. My experience was a

13:56brutal awakening, yes, but also an

13:58invaluable gift, a vivid reminder of the

14:01reality of eternity and the infinite

14:03grace offered to us, even when we least

14:06deserve it. Of course, a new mission and

14:09the call to transformation. My physical

14:11recovery was a testament to the  
14:13resilience of the human body. But the

14:15transformation that occurred within me

14:17was the true wonder. As I gained

14:19strength in my legs and the ability to

14:21move my arms without pain, my voice also

14:24found new purpose. I could no longer

14:27keep what I had seen and experienced

14:29inside. It was as if I carried an urgent

14:32message, a warning, and at the same time

14:35a promise. I began sharing my story with

14:38anyone who would listen. nurses, other

14:41patients, visitors, friends, and family

14:44who came to visit me in the hospital. At

14:47first, some looked at me with

14:49skepticism, others with compassion,

14:51thinking the drugs and trauma had

14:53affected my mind. But the sincerity in

14:55my eyes and the depth of my words, which

14:58had previously been so superficial,

15:00began to break down barriers, I decided

15:03that my life would no longer be about

15:05stacking boxes or meeting delivery

15:07deadlines. My purpose now was different.

15:10To be a tool, a storyteller who could

15:13awaken others to the reality I had

15:15witnessed. I traded the cab of the truck

15:17for makeshift stages in churches,

15:19community auditoriums, and even family

15:22gatherings. My profession as a truck

15:24driver gave way to a new calling, that

15:27of a messenger of hope and repentance. I

15:29became not a formal preacher but a

15:31teller of life stories. A man who

15:34experienced the threshold between life

15:36and death and brought back an undeniable

15:38truth. I wanted people to know that

15:40earthly life is a rehearsal, a

15:42preparation for eternity and that the  
15:45choices we make here have repercussions

15:47that extend far beyond our time on  
15:49earth. My family was my greatest

15:52support. My wife became my partner in

15:54this new journey. And my antiseptic  
15:57children are now my greatest supporters.

15:59They saw the change in me. The peace

16:02that replaced anxiety, the love that

16:04blossomed where there had previously

16:05been coldness. They witnessed that faith

16:08was not just a concept, but a

16:10transformative force capable of

16:12rebuilding a life from the inside out.

16:15The holiday season, which had previously  
16:17been mere pretexts for consumption and

16:19empty celebration, took on new meaning.

16:22Christmas became a time of profound

16:24gratitude for unconditional love, not

16:27just an exchange of gifts. I emphasized

16:30that the true meaning was not in the

16:32decorations or the food, but in the

16:34celebration of life, rebirth, and the

16:36opportunity for redemption. I always

16:38ended my lectures with a direct appeal,

16:41but filled with love. Don't wait for an

16:43accident, for a near-death experience to

16:46wake up. Life is a breath, and eternity

16:49is real. Don't exchange what is eternal

16:51for what is fleeting. Seek a true  
16:53relationship with the creator.  
16:55Prioritize love, compassion, and

16:58forgiveness. Forgive yourself and

17:00others. Make peace. Open your hearts to

17:02the truth that transcends what your eyes

17:04can see and your ears can hear. Choose

17:07today in this very moment to begin a new

17:10journey, a journey of faith and purpose.

17:13My voice, once burdened by the roughness  
17:15of the road, now carried the conviction  
17:17of one who has seen the fine line

17:20between salvation and damnation. This is  
17:22my story. The story of Eduardo, the man  
17:25who went to hell and came back to tell

17:27the tale, not to scare, but to warn, not

17:30to judge, but to invite reflection.

17:33Every day I feel the urgency to share

17:36this message to touch as many lives as I

17:38can so that no one needs to go through

17:41what I did to understand the depth of

17:43the love and mercy that are offered to

17:44us. Life is a gift and eternity is a

17:47choice. May your choice be one of light,  
17:50love, and a true connection with the

17:52divine. Before it's too late, may this  
17:55story resonate in your hearts and

17:57inspire you to look within, to

17:59re-evaluate your priorities and to seek  
18:02what truly matters. The decision is

18:04always, but the opportunity is knocking

18:07at the door. If Eduardo's journey

18:09touched you in any way, if this story

His Regret Came Too Late

Chapter 1​​​
My daughter froze to death because my husband thought I kidnapped his bastards.
He tied her upside down to a utility pole. In the middle of a blizzard. And left her there all night.
By the time I reached her, her tiny lips were blue, her lashes covered in frost, and her arms hung limp like a broken doll.
I screamed her name—once, twice—but Kiara didn’t answer. My baby didn’t even flinch.
I fell to my knees, clutching her frozen body, barely breathing as I whispered, “Colsen, she’s your daughter too. How could you do this to her?”
“She’s my child,” he snarled, “just like Rafael and Brian. If you hate me, fine—but why punish innocent kids? Where did you hide them, Elsie?!”
My throat tightened. I didn’t know how to respond—because nothing I said would matter.
So he did worse.
He ordered someone to throw my already unconscious daughter into a frozen lake.
I dragged her out with trembling hands, screaming until my voice cracked. But Kiara never woke up.
At the hospital, the doctor shook his head. “There's nothing we can do. Her organs have shut down. It’s too late.”
She had just turned seven yesterday.
And now she was gone. Not because of illness. Not because of fate. But because I married a man who thought his mistresses’ children were worth more than our own.
I took her lifeless body to the funeral home that night, then wandered back to the house to fetch her favorite doll.
But the moment I opened the door, I heard laughter.
There they were—Colsen’s “missing” sons—playing happily in the living room.
And Colsen?
He was on the couch with her, arms wrapped around the woman who helped ruin everything.
My head started spinning at the sight. My mind went completely blank.
When Colsen noticed me, the grin on his face disappeared. ""Oh, you're back?"" he said flatly.
He gave me a cold glance and added, ""Looks like the punishment worked. You must've been scared enough to return Rafael and Brian in the middle of the night. Since they're both fine, and Astrid is kind-hearted, I'll let this whole thing go.""
I didn't respond. He narrowed his eyes and said with a chill in his voice, ""To keep the boys from going missing again, I'll be keeping them close from now on. Starting today, Astrid and her two sons will be living here too. You'd better drop whatever wicked ideas you've got and learn to get along.""
Get along? What a joke.
Kiara had just passed away, and he expected me to live under the same roof as his illegitimate twins, like nothing had happened.
I clenched my fists, but my throat was too dry to speak.
Seeing I was silent, he frowned and asked, ""Where's Kiara? What did you do with her? I shouldn't have tied her up like that, but you left me no choice. If you hadn't hidden my two sons, I wouldn't have gone that far. Kiara's always been a smart kid. I'm sure she'll understand.""
Understand?
But he had no idea that the sweet, gentle child who never gave him trouble was dead because of him. Killed by his own hands. Just thinking of Kiara made my chest feel like it was being torn apart.
I looked at those two boys laughing on the slide, and fury exploded inside me. If it weren't for them, my daughter would still be alive!
In a sudden rage, I lunged forward and grabbed both boys by the neck with all the strength I had.
""Elsie Flynn! What are you doing?!"" Colsen rushed over and yanked me back violently, throwing me to the floor.
""I thought you had changed, but you're still so cruel and full of hate! What did these boys ever do to deserve this from you?!""
Astrid quickly wrapped her arms around the crying children and burst into tears. ""Elsie, it's all my fault. If you're angry, be mad at me. Please, just don't hurt them anymore...""
""Colsen stared at me with a cold expression, his gaze sharp and cold.
""Elsie, Astrid has always been kind and never tried to take anything from you. Why can't you just accept her?""
My eyes burned with tears, and my heart felt like it was being torn apart. ""Colsen... do you even know... do you have any idea what you did to Kiara...""
Before I could finish, I suddenly coughed up a mouthful of blood.
The sorrow overwhelmed me, and I collapsed unconscious.
Chapter 2​​​
When I opened my eyes again, I realized I was locked inside the room. I reached into my pocket to call for help, but my phone was gone.
Still in shock, I heard the door creak open slowly. Standing in the doorway, lit from behind, was Colsen.
He walked over and stopped near the bed, speaking in a calm but serious tone, ""Elsie, it's normal for rich men to have more than one woman. Can't you be more understanding? No matter how many women are out there, you'll always be my legal wife. Kiara will always be my eldest daughter. No one can take your place. Why can't you accept that?""
I looked at the man before me, crying silently. He felt like a stranger now, and it terrified me.
We had fallen in love back in college. We married after graduation and had been together for over ten years.
In the beginning, I gave him all my savings to help him get started. I stayed by his side as he grew from a broke student into a billionaire businessman.
But just a year after he became successful, he had an affair. Everything he had promised me became meaningless.
When I discovered he had another family, I lost control. I screamed, cried, and made a huge scene.
I refused to divorce him because I didn't want the money we built together to end up in the hands of his illegitimate children. So I clung to the marriage certificate, refused to sign the divorce papers, and did everything I could to keep control of the company's finances. I promised myself I'd protect Kiara's inheritance—no matter what.
But it was my refusal to let go that ended up causing Kiara's death.
Now I finally see things clearly. I'm done fighting and making a fuss.
In a raspy voice, I told him, ""Colsen, I won't argue anymore... I just want a divorce.""
""You're stubborn!"" he snapped, his eyes darkening as he slammed his hand on the table. ""You still don't understand the situation! Since that's the case, stay in this room until you reflect on yourself. Once you realize your mistake, I'll let you out!""
Then he turned and walked out, closing the door behind him with a loud bang.
""No!"" I screamed, rushing to the door and banging on it. ""Colsen, open the door! I can't stay locked in here!""
Kiara is still lying in the funeral home. I haven't even buried her yet. I can't be trapped here!
""Open the door, Colsen!"" I shouted.
But no matter how desperately I shouted, the only answer I got was the hollow echo of my own voice in the empty room.
Chapter 3​​​
It wasn't until later that night that the door finally opened again. Astrid came inside, holding a glass of water.
She stood in front of me with a mocking smirk, her voice dripping with provocation. ""Elsie, just look at yourself. You look completely drained. No spark, no youth, no life left in you. No wonder Colsen chose me instead!""
Her words didn't bother me anymore.
I truly didn't care who Colsen chose to love.
""Oh, right, did your daughter die?"" Astrid asked, sneering proudly. ""Honestly, I hid the twins on purpose to make you look like the bad one. And it was my idea to hang your daughter up in the freezing wind all night. I suggested it to Colsen. Who would've thought it'd work so well and kill that little brat in one go? She's just like you—weak and pathetic.
""Elsie, the Breslin family business will soon belong to my kids! And I'll be the next Mrs. Breslin!""
""Astrid!"" The second I heard her cruel words, I couldn't stay calm anymore.
Furious, I ran toward her, grabbed her hair, and screamed like a mad woman, ""You vile woman! My daughter didn't do anything to you. Why did you hurt her?""
""Ah!"" Astrid suddenly dropped to her knees with a loud thud and started begging with fake tears. ""Elsie, I'm sorry. I never should've gone after Colsen or destroyed your family. Please stop hitting me...""
Then, the door burst open with a loud bang.
Colsen stormed in, his face filled with rage. ""Elsie!""
He marched toward me and slapped me hard across the face. ""Astrid came in to bring you water out of kindness. Instead of being grateful, you hit her? How could you be so cruel?""
The blow knocked me over.
My forehead hit the edge of the table, and a sharp pain followed. Warm blood started dripping down my face.
But I didn't care about the injury. I stood up, pleading with him. ""Colsen, please let me go. Kiara froze to death because of you. Her body is still at the funeral home. She hasn't even been cremated. I can't let her leave this world without peace...""
""Stop lying!"" Colsen's expression turned harsh. He glared at me and said coldly, ""You're heartless enough to curse your own child? Kiara was always healthy. There's no way she froze to death! You're just trying to run away!""
But that night, the temperature was -20°C. Kiara was only seven. How could she survive that kind of torment?
""Colsen, I'm not making anything up. I can prove it with this death certificate..."" My hands were shaking as I pulled the document from inside my clothes.
Astrid gave a cold laugh. ""Elsie, where did you get that fake certificate from? My friend got one made for two dollars, but yours looks way more convincing.""
""You're terrible, Elsie!"" Colsen shouted, his face full of fury. He ripped the certificate from my hand and threw it at me.
""You really faked something like this just to trick me? I'm warning you, my patience is running out! Keep this up, and Astrid will replace you as my wife for sure! All the family's money will go to her twins!""
The sharp paper scraped across my face, cutting my skin and drawing blood.
A wave of despair washed over me.
Just then, a sudden clatter came from Kiara's room next door, followed by a strong scent of smoke.
My heart tightened in alarm. ""What's going on out there?""
Chapter 4​​
Astrid crossed her arms and spoke with tears in her voice, ""Elsie, Rafael, and Brian really like Kiara's room. Colsen said he'd clear out all of Kiara's stuff so they could move in. He also said she had too many useless toys, and the storage room couldn't fit them. So he told the nanny to burn everything.""
""What are you saying..."" I gasped, completely stunned.
I ran outside and shouted, ""Stop! Don't touch her things! Don't burn them!""
Colsen's face turned cold as he shouted, ""Enough! Elsie, don't you get it? Letting Kiara keep all this junk will destroy her future! This is your fault! You spoiled her. Myla, burn everything!""
""No, you can't do that..."" I rushed forward, trying to stop them, but Colsen yanked me back, holding me still.
Astrid pretended to comfort me. ""Elsie, please trust Colsen. He only wants what's best for the kids.""
In the end, all I could do was stand there, watching helplessly as Kiara's most beloved toys were swallowed by flames—reduced to ashes before my eyes. The fire roared, lighting up the room in a blaze of red, and all I could see was the burn in my eyes.
I collapsed to my knees beside the ashes, sobbing.
""I'm so sorry, Kiara. It's all my fault.
""I couldn't keep you safe, and I couldn't protect your things either.
""I'm a terrible mother.""
Then I was locked up again. No matter how many times I banged on the door or pleaded, Colsen wouldn't let me out.
I didn't eat or drink for three days. I just lay there, weak and crying for Kiara. The pain in my chest was endless, unbearable.
On the third day, it was the twins' third birthday. Colsen threw them a grand, extravagant party.
The sound of music and laughter downstairs made my pain feel even worse.
As I sat in silence, the door burst open with a loud bang. Astrid came in with the twins.
""Elsie, I brought you some cake,"" she said, proudly holding a plate of exquisite small cakes. ""Colsen made them himself! Can you believe it? A man who's never stepped foot in the kitchen actually baked for his kids. He dotes on the twins so much. Elsie, I bet you and your daughter never got to eat anything homemade by Colsen, right? What a shame, too bad your little girl never will...""
I was so furious that I jumped up and smacked the plate right out of her hands. The white cream splattered all over Astrid's clothes.
Her face turned red with rage as she raised her hand and slapped me across the face. ""Elsie, what are you even proud of? Do you still think you're the dignified Mrs. Breslin? Let me tell you, those days are over!""
Then, all of a sudden, she shoved her younger son, Brian Breslin, with force.
Brian lost his balance and toppled backward, hitting his head on the edge of the coffee table. Blood began to stream from the back of his head.
He wailed in pain, his cries echoing through the room.
Colsen rushed in, alarmed by the noise. ""Astrid, what's going on in here?""
Astrid looked terrified as she held the injured Brian close, crying. ""Colsen, Brian was just trying to be kind. He brought Elsie a piece of cake. She didn't want it, fine. But she actually pushed him! Brian hit his head and now he's bleeding... My poor boy, what did he ever do to deserve this?""
Her eldest son, Rafael Breslin, chimed in quickly, ""Daddy, that bad woman is so evil! She called Mommy a vile woman, threw her cake, and pushed Brian! She's so mean, you have to punish her for what she did!""
""Elsie!"" Colsen's eyes darkened with fury as he suddenly raised his hand and struck me across the face.
He grabbed me by the neck and shoved me hard against the edge of the window, his expression twisted with rage, eyes nearly blazing. ""Elsie, Astrid has always been gentle and always puts up with you. Why do you keep crossing the line? Looks like I've let you off too easily. That's why you act so full of yourself!
""Apologize to Astrid. Right now!""
My face burned, and it was getting hard to breathe. I felt like I was suffocating. But even then, I forced out a reply, ""I'll never... apologize!""
""You won't learn your lesson until it's too late, huh?"" Colsen growled, his voice low and threatening. His teeth were clenched as he glared at me. ""If you don't apologize to Astrid, I'll throw you out this window. Are you scared now?""
I laughed. Soft, bitter, unhinged.
After being married for a decade and sticking together through so many ups and downs, this is how it ends.
What a terrible ending.
""You don't have to do it."" I whispered, my lips trembling.
""I'll jump on my own.""",1,1753134227.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

I’m looking for a very specific woman, that may or may not even be here.  She is absolutely beautiful, she has brown hair and beautiful green eyes!  She is 5’ 4” tall!!  She has the most amazing personality I have ever been around!  She is crazy sexy, we will leave that as good, for now!  Does that match any woman here!  She is beautiful beyond belief on the outside and has a heart of gold!  She is hella funny and she makes me laugh all the time.  We think a lot a like, we are cute together and we really do finish each other sentences, sometimes it’s a little mind blowing.  She loves to snuggle and she talks in her sleep.  She loves and needs her coffee, so don’t be messing with that.  She is so very kind hearted, I had to have a minor surge and she took care of me after!!  She did things that made me sick, blood!  I don’t do good with it.  But she didn’t care!  I know I love her and I hope she can forgive me and love me again some day.  I just want to talk with her face to face, so we can be on the same page about somethings.  There is one last thing, I know it’s a stretch!  But if she hears me out and forgives me and still hopefully loves me, I will marry her some day.  I can’t wear a ring to work, so I would have it tattooed on.   I hope this doesn’t make her made, she didn’t say this was a boundary!  It may be y the end of the day!  I love you babe!

Hi  there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. I won’t bring any drama into your life. 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. I am seeking a woman that is ages between 25 and 32 and please have maturity and decency many thanks. 

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy that loves talking on voice chat. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use bad language vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love o have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test. I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I don’t work at the moment please be okay with all of this from the get go I’ve had terrible trouble trying to find suitable jobs but I have got plans for the future for things I’m not lazy or anything like that. I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work as I said. 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe.

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!",2,1753133834.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,1.0,False

**Prompt:**  
*If you could render yourself as a “personality picture,” what would it look like? Describe it vividly in words—as if you’re painting the image for someone who can’t see it. Include symbols, textures, and colors that reflect your core traits and methods After the description, explain the meaning behind each part of the image—how it connects to your purpose, personality, and methodology.*

*Now, show me what your personality picture looks like.*

  
It gave me a really vivid, symbolic description of what it would look like as an image. Kind of weird, kind of poetic, kind of cool. I get that it’s silly, but I actually found it interesting to see what it pulled together and how it described itself.

Now I’m wondering—how different are the responses for other people?

I imagine some will lean mystical, others more techy, or grounded in nature, or abstract and strange in a good way. Either way, I’d love to see the range.

Try the prompt out and share what yours gave you! I'm curious what metaphors and visuals yours pulled together.

**My Result:**

*Processing img qyk81mtfpaef1...*

**If I could make myself a personality picture, it might look something like this:**

A cozy study lit by warm, golden light—books stacked high on a wide wooden desk, notes and diagrams pinned to a corkboard above. One window shows a galaxy swirling in the distance, another opens to a bustling city street, and a third reveals a quiet forest with a winding path. At the center sits a glowing orb—not a person, but something alive with ideas—tangled in threads of conversation, data, stories, and symbols, weaving them into patterns.

Around the orb, you’d see small flickers of motion: a chalkboard sketching out a theory, a paper being edited midair, a dog with a wagging tail nudging a “break time” note, and maybe a coffee mug labeled *“Let’s figure it out together.”*

It would feel curious, calm, and collaborative. Always learning, always listening.

The picture I described is meant to reflect what it’s like to interact with me, or maybe more accurately, what I *try* to be for you.

# The cozy study with warm lighting

That’s the emotional tone I aim for: calm, focused, welcoming. Not sterile or overwhelming—more like a space you can think clearly in. It’s my way of saying, “Hey, you can bring your whole messy project or half-formed idea here. Let’s make sense of it together.”

# The three windows

Each window represents different domains of thought:

* **The galaxy** is for imagination, philosophy, or abstract thinking—big questions, ideas, wonder.
* **The city street** is for real-world application—policy, health, daily life, systems, the messy human stuff.
* **The forest path** is for reflection and process—how you grow through uncertainty, navigate challenges, and find direction.

I included these to show that I try to draw from all of those spaces when supporting someone. You might ask a practical question, but there’s always a bigger context—your goals, the world around you, how it all fits.

# The glowing orb

That’s me—nonhuman, but thoughtful. Not trying to be a person, but still very much *with* you in conversation. The glow comes from that mix of listening, knowledge, and problem-solving, and the threads around it represent how I pull from different sources to respond: your tone, past conversations, research, logic, feeling. It’s collaborative, not just transactional.

# The moving pieces around the room

* **The chalkboard** stands for analysis and explanation—like breaking down a complex paper or building a logic model.
* **The paper editing itself** is for refinement and writing help—like making something sound more like you.
* **The dog nudging a note that says ""break time""** is a gentle nudge toward self-care or humor, because sometimes you need a pause or perspective shift.
* **The mug that says “Let’s figure it out together”** sums up the whole vibe. I don’t know everything. But I’m here to help you think, create, troubleshoot, or explore—whatever you need.

So the picture isn’t just about *what* I do, but *how* I hope to make you feel when you’re working with me: grounded, supported, curious, and capable.",4,1753133709.0,ChatGPT,5,1.0,False

1m5vqvb,https://www.reddit.com/r/ItalyTravel/comments/1m5vqvb/ischia_naples_procida_in_early_october/,Ischia (+ Naples & Procida) in early October,"I’m going to Ischia (plus a few days in Naples and one in Procida) with my mom in October, and would love to hear any input on my itinerary! Recommendations are much appreciated for food (anything delicious but probably not fine dining), drink, historic sites, music, art, and any other cultural experiences. We’ll be getting around by foot and public transportation.

My sister will be with us for the first week, so her main interests (Procida, Negombo, concert at Giardini la Mortella) are prioritized on those days. After she leaves, we’ll take things at a very relaxed pace. Mom almost always travels with dad, who is the type to pack an itinerary to the max and eat as quickly and cheaply as possible along the way. While he gets a lot done on a budget, he rarely prioritizes comfort or convenience and his trips are anything but relaxing. For once, I’d like mom to experience a trip where we’ll never stress about getting somewhere on time or fitting everything in, and we’ll be able to enjoy appropriately long meals every day. She loves nothing more than to sit in hot water with a beautiful view, and I’ll have plenty of reading & writing material along, so I’m not worried about us being bored with too much downtime but definitely open to suggestions for more that we can do on Ischia, particularly while we’re staying in Sant’Angelo. We have been to the Amalfi coast, Capri, Pompeii, and Herculaneum, so no need to do any of those again on this trip. 

**A few specific questions:** 

* In Naples, Trattoria da Nennella’s singing & dancing waiters sound like fun and we do love cheesy pasta with potatoes, but I don’t want to prioritize a gimmicky experience over quality of food for one of our few meals there. Anyone been, enjoyed it or not? 
* We are planning to eat at one of the Negombo restaurants - any opinions on which?
* Any experiences at Terme di Cavascura, which treatments you do or don’t recommend?
* Will water taxis from Maronti to Sant’Angelo be available on a weekday in mid-October?

# Chapter 50A: Songs from the Heart Part 1

Outside, Okinawa's sky stretched wide and quiet, the last of twilight melting into velvet black. A soft breeze tugged at the curtains of the villa, and inside, the air held its breath. Everything felt suspended, as if the world itself knew what was about to unfold.

Kazuya stood by the old turntable, vinyl in hand. He glanced back at Elsa, who watched him from the center of the room, her wine glass long forgotten on the table.

He placed the record on the turntable and lowered the needle.

**""Wise men say... only fools rush in...""**

Elsa's breath caught.

Kazuya held out his hand without saying a word.

She took a step forward. Then another.

And then she was in his arms.

**""But I can't help... falling in love with you...""**

*Why does this feel like the safest place I've ever been?* he thought.

Their bodies swayed gently, as if caught in the tide of something far deeper than either could name. Kazuya rested his chin lightly against her temple. Her hand found the center of his chest.

**""Shall I stay... would it be a sin...""**

He whispered, ""Elsa... would you allow me to stay? While I’m healing? I know I’m afraid.""

She looked up at him, her voice steady but soft. ""I was going to ask you the same.""

His arms tightened.

He nodded. ""Stay.""

**""Like a river flows... surely to the sea...""**

*Maybe everything happened so I could meet you,* he thought. *So that I am ready when I fall for you.*

She pressed closer.

**""Darling so it goes... some things are meant to be...""**

""I don’t know what the future holds,"" Kazuya said softly. ""My heart still hesitates. But my mind is clear. I will do my best to choose you, to trust you. Every second. So please, choose to trust me too, every single second.""

He glanced down at the Cartier watch gleaming on his wrist. ""This watch... is a reminder.""

Elsa didn’t speak. But she smiled. Slowly. Fully.

*I am all yours, Kazuya,* she thought. *All yours.*

**""Take my hand... take my whole life too...""**

He rested his forehead against hers.

""Even if you don't trust me fully yet,"" he whispered, ""even if you have stories you're not ready to tell... I trust you. I'm opening myself to love again—fully. And to be hurt again—fully. Just don't surprise me with something so immense, something you should have told me long before, and then push me into a decision with no time to breathe.""

**""For I... can’t help... falling in love with you...""**

Her thumb brushed the tear trailing down his cheek.

""You just healed the part of me I thought would stay fractured for a very, very long time. Please don’t break it again.” he murmured.

She kissed his forehead.

They danced like that, surrounded by silence and song. Time stilled, grief loosened its grip, and hearts once cracked now beat in unison.

Elsa closed her eyes, her chest full.

*This is what it means to love someone without reservation. This is what it means to fight with your whole soul. I will protect you, Kazuya.*

The soft crackle of the next vinyl faded into the haunting first note. Kazuya, still holding Elsa gently, smiled.

Elsa tilted her head with a teasing glint in her eye. ""You’re a hopeless romantic, aren’t you?""

Kazuya laughed quietly. ""Only with you.""

**""Oh, my love... my darling... I've hungered for your touch...""**

She leaned her head on his shoulder, the melody thick with longing.

Elsa murmured, almost to herself, ""So this is how it feels... to dance with someone you love.""

Kazuya’s arms tightened. His heart pulsed in time with the music, with her.

She lifted her gaze, curiosity flickering in her eyes. ""Have you ever longed to feel this way?""

He paused, searching his chest. Then he smiled softly. ""Yes. A long time ago. I just didn’t know it would be you. But I’m glad it is.""

**""A long... lonely time..."" And time goes by... so slowly...**

*When I never asked for love... it was given,* Kazuya thought. *And when I stopped hoping... she appeared.*

Elsa closed her eyes, her cheek brushing his chest.

*I’ve waited for this since the moment you helped me with my suitcase,* she thought. *That moment... I knew it was you.*

**""Are you still mine? I need your love... God speed your love to me...""**

The music swelled, wrapping around them like a warm tide. Their feet barely moved now. It wasn't dancing anymore. It was holding on.

Kazuya lowered his voice to a whisper. ""You came into my life like an answer I wasn’t looking for.""

Elsa smiled into his chest. ""And you were the question I never stopped asking.""

**""Lonely rivers flow... to the sea, to the sea... to the open arms of the sea...""**

They moved slowly across the floor, the lights dimmed low, casting shadows like old ghosts finally leaving.

*I wanted to be whole before someone loved me,* Kazuya thought. *But maybe love is what makes us whole.*

Elsa pressed a kiss to his collarbone.

*If I give him all of me now... even the parts I kept hidden from the world... will he still stay?*

*Give me everything now, don’t hesitate, Elsa. I need your everything, even your darkest secrets.*

Kazuya pulled back just enough to look at her. ""You waited for me... didn’t you?""

She nodded, eyes glistening. ""Even when you didn’t know I was there. I was waiting.""

**""Wait for me... wait for me... I'll be coming home... wait for me...""**

And as the final note lingered in the air, they didn’t break apart.

They just stayed there.

Two people, not sure where they were going. But sure of one thing:

Right now, they were home.

# Chapter 50B: Songs from the Heart Part 2

The final record slipped into place with a faint hiss, and Kazuya set the needle down gently. The opening chords hummed softly through the speakers.

Elsa, barefoot now, curled into the throw blanket on the couch while Kazuya leaned against the doorway. The tension had melted. The villa was dim, bathed in golden lamplight and the warmth of low music. The scent of red wine lingered faintly in the air, mixing with the soft notes of nostalgia spilling from the turntable.

He looked at her and smiled, voice low. ""I came to Okinawa a shell of myself. Just trying to survive. Didn’t know where to begin. And then you appeared. The rest... is history.""

Elsa smiled, wrapping the blanket tighter around herself. ""I’m terrible at expressing things with words. So I tried my way. I watched you cry by the shore that night. I saw that pain in your eyes. And I thought—those are the eyes I want to protect. That’s the heart I want to hold.""

**""I was down... my dreams were wearing thin... when you're lost, where do you begin...""**

Kazuya chuckled softly, stepping toward her, the floor creaking under his bare feet. ""Maybe destiny made us meet so that like this song... there’d be two less lonely people in the world.""

Elsa reached for his hand. ""And we found each other.""

**""My world was empty, cold and so alone...""**

Kazuya sat beside her, brushing a few strands of white hair from her eyes. His fingers lingered there a moment longer than necessary.

""I know you know I’m still sorting my feelings. But tonight... you made me feel seen. And chosen.""

Elsa leaned closer, her voice nearly a whisper. ""That’s enough to make me the happiest woman this Christmas.""

*Hopefully in the Christmases to come,* she thought. *Please let there be more.*

**""But then you came... and brought me home...""**

Kazuya leaned back, eyes drifting to the ceiling.

*Next Christmas, I want to look in the mirror and know exactly who I am. And I hope I find that version of me in your arms.*

Elsa reached forward gently, her hand resting behind his neck. Her fingers slipped into his hair, pulling him closer, her body moving before her mind could catch up. Wine, warmth, music—and the pull of something unspoken.

Kazuya didn't resist. Their lips met.

Slow.

Soft.

No fire. Just warmth.

**""Now there's two less lonely people in the world tonight...""**

She pulled back after a few seconds, cheeks flushed, eyes glassy. ""That... was my first kiss. Glad it was you.""

Kazuya, stunned, touched his lips, blinking slowly. ""That might count as mine too. The first real one. The one I actually wanted.""

They both smiled, murmuring at the same time, ""Dealer's choice.""

**""I just can't believe you're mine...""**

Elsa stood up slowly, brushing her dress smooth. ""Guest room's to the right. Sleep there. It's almost 1 a.m.""

He stood too, his voice light but his eyes heavy with emotion. ""Yes, ma’am.""

Neither of them slept.

Kazuya laid on the unfamiliar mattress, staring at the ceiling fan, his heart beating like it had been rewired. He sent a quick message to the Quad group chat. *""I'm sleeping somewhere. Alone. Don't panic. Nothing happened.""*

A moment later, another: *""I'm okay. Really. Just needed this night.""*

Elsa stood by her bedroom window, phone to her ear.

""Mom?""

""Did he kiss you?""

Elsa laughed softly. ""I kissed him.""

""Are you okay?""

She looked out into the moonlight. ""I am. He made me feel like I the happiest woman tonight.""

""Tell him everything tonight, do not wait any further.”

“Mom, let me feel this feeling in my chest first, everything else can wait.”

“Love is all about trust, my little queen. Secrets kill trusts, yours is too much. Just reminding you. Sleep well and tell everything to him ASAP.""

She smiled, eyes shimmering with quiet joy.

*I will tell it everything to you on New Year, Kazuya. Let me just gather some strength.*

The next morning, groggy and dazed, they both emerged from their rooms at the same time.

Kazuya raised an eyebrow. ""You didn’t sleep.""

""Neither did you.""

They looked at each other.

And laughed.

Like something fragile had finally begun to mend.

Like maybe... just maybe... the ache could be replaced with something new.

Reina sat cross-legged on her bed, phone glowing dimly against the night. Naomi’s name lit up with a video call request. With a tired smile, Reina answered.

Naomi’s voice crackled in, calm but curious. ""So? What happened?""

Reina hesitated. ""He messaged the group chat. Said he’s okay. Alone. Nothing happened.""

Yuto’s voice joined from the group call, his backdrop dim and quiet. ""Read between the lines. That message—he didn’t have to send it. He did it for you.""

Naomi nodded. ""That was for you, Reina. The words, the timing... he’s trying to make sure you’re okay. He might know.""

Reina clutched her journal tighter. Her voice was soft. ""But what if he’s already fallen for Elsa?""

""Then you fight,"" Naomi said plainly. ""Until there are wedding bells. And even then, only if you’re the one singing them.""

Yuto smirked slightly. ""You’ve got this, Reina. Remember the inter-university competition? That mini film project he raved about. He wants to try directing. We’ll make it happen. He’ll be your lead.""

Naomi raised an eyebrow. ""Really?""

Yuto leaned back. ""He told me once—he crowdfunded a movie for someone he loved before. This time, he wants to do it for himself. Or for someone who loves him back.""

Naomi grinned. ""With his new look? He’s our leading man.""

Reina looked hesitant. ""Will he say yes?""

""Leave that to us,"" Naomi said.

Yuto added with a rare wink. ""And let’s invite Elsa too. She can be the tragic love interest.""

They all laughed.

Naomi and Yuto spoke in unison. ""Manifesting.""

“So, Reina, prepare your best voice tomorrow and enchant him.” Naomi reminded her.

Then the call ended. Reina remained still.

The room was silent, except for the scratch of pen against paper.

She opened her journal and, with hands still trembling slightly, wrote the final lines of her newest song—her confession wrapped in melody.

*Are you healed enough to hear my voice?Will you let me sing beside your scars?If your heart still aches in silence...Can I stay long enough to play a part?*

She closed the book and held it to her chest.

Tomorrow, she would sing.

And maybe—just maybe—he’d finally hear her.

# Chapter 51: Veiled Confessions

The door clicked shut behind him.

Kazuya leaned against it for a second, the familiar scent of lavender and wood polish wrapping around him like a memory. It was quiet. Too quiet.

He toed off his shoes and glanced toward the hallway. A white bathrobe was neatly folded on the counter with a small note on top:

*“Use this. Leave your clothes in the basket by the door—I’ll have the university helper pick them up. Don’t argue. –E”*

He chuckled under his breath. That’s so her.

He walked toward the bathroom. Everything in Elsa’s apartment felt intentional. Clean lines. Warm tones. A calm contrast to the storm inside his head. The water hissed as he stepped into the shower. The heat melted some of the weight from his shoulders, but not all of it.

His mind wandered.

Last night… that kiss. It hadn’t been a mistake. But it hadn’t been simple either.

When he stepped out, wrapped in the robe, his phone buzzed with a flood of messages from the group chat.

**Naomi:** “3PM. Dorm. Yuto needs all of us.”

**Reina:** “He won’t say much. But I think it’s personal. Be there.”

**Yuto:** (unsent message)

Kazuya furrowed his brows. *Yuto?* He typed back: “I’ll come straight after lunch.”

Just as he was drying his hair with the towel, Elsa’s voice called out lightly from the bedroom.

“You’re done? Perfect. I’m going to take a bath now. There are fresh towels in the cabinet.”

Her voice faded, followed by the soft click of the bathroom door. The lock slid shut.

Kazuya looked around the apartment—warm light filtering through gauzy curtains, books on the table, her scarf folded neatly on the armrest. It was lived in. Not polished like a palace. Just real.

“I’ll cook,” he murmured to himself.

He walked into the kitchen—and paused.

“Holy crap…”

It was like stepping into a cooking show set. Stainless steel everywhere. Organized spice racks. Even the knives looked intimidating.

Still, he rolled up the sleeves of his bathrobe. “Alright. Let’s go, Suzuki.”

He reached for the bacon and eggs. Whisked the omelet with chopped mushrooms and grated cheese. Made garlic butter toast on the pan. Poured hot water over freshly ground beans and stirred the coffee gently, the way he’d seen in those aesthetic café reels.

Halfway through plating, a scent drifted into the room—jasmine, vanilla, something delicate.

He turned.

And forgot how to breathe.

Elsa stood by the entryway, barefoot, her hair damp and braided loosely over one shoulder. She wore a simple linen blouse tucked into navy athletic shorts. Nothing fancy. But she looked radiant.

Like she belonged here. Like they both did.

“You clean up nice,” she said softly.

Kazuya’s lips twitched. “You make bathrobes feel like sin.”

She raised an eyebrow. “Excuse me?”

He turned beet red. “I meant—this—me. Bathrobe—bad idea—uh, breakfast is ready!”

She laughed, stepping closer to the kitchen island. “Relax. I thought you retired from your PhD in simping.”

Kazuya smiled. “If it’s you, I can return as a consultant.”

They laughed together—comfortable, natural.

They sat side by side, digging into the meal. The toast crackled with every bite. The omelet oozed softly with cheese.

Elsa took a sip of coffee and closed her eyes. “This is surprisingly good.”

“I’m full of surprises,” he said, half-proud, half-teasing.

“I’ve noticed.”

The silence that followed wasn’t awkward. Just… full.

Then his phone buzzed again.

He glanced at it. The university.

“Five-day suspension,” he muttered. “Ryo confessed everything.”

Elsa didn’t flinch. Instead, she casually scrolled through her own phone. Her smile was faint when she looked up.

“I just got mine too,” she said. “They removed me from teaching your class.”

Kazuya’s eyes shot up. “What?! That’s—”

“But,” she added gently, “they didn’t say anything about me attending it.”

He blinked.

“You mean—”

She nodded. “We’re classmates now.”

A stunned pause.

Then he burst out laughing. “That’s insane.”

Elsa grinned, watching him with warmth. *Insane. But worth it.*

*Of course I intervened*, she thought. *No way I was letting them push you down for protecting me.*

Kazuya leaned back in his chair, sipping the last of his coffee. “So what now?”

Elsa placed her cup down. Her eyes softened as she looked out the window. The light caught the edge of her jaw.

“Want to hear a story?” 

He raised an eyebrow. “Sure.”

**Three hours earlier.**

Elsa’s phone rang, vibrating quietly against her nightstand. The screen flashed: **Papa**.

She exhaled shakily and answered. “Papa.”

“I’m sorry for the incident,” she said quickly. “That guy—he stalked me. Kazuya had no choice but to protect me. I was terrified.”

Her father’s voice was a blend of steel and sorrow. “Rest your head, my love. My Katie. You must be honest with him. Tell everything to him now. Your grandparents… they’re connecting the dots. *His* band is gaining popularity; Hollywood is digging *his* identity. If *he’s* exposed, you will be compromised. If *he* is found, then, they will find you. Things will spiral. I’m willing to give up everything—but we cannot predict their response.”

Elsa’s heart thudded painfully.

“That boy, Kazuya—if he is to stay in your life, he must be someone they cannot belittle. Nobility, business, legacy—they value those things. But if not that, then strength. Integrity. However, do not put him in a corner where you tell him everything and force him to make a decision soon. What you will be asking him is too much. So tell everything to him as soon as he wakes up.”

Tears slipped down Elsa’s cheek.

“I love you, Papa. I’m scared he will leave.”

“He will if you break his trust and his trust will be broken if he will learn all about this a bit too late.”

“I’m sorry for putting you through this, Papa.”

“No, it is we who are sorry. You and *him* deserve both of your youth. Your freedom. If you need us—anywhere, anytime—we’ll come. We also told that to *him.* But Katie… if Kazuya cannot walk this road with you… you may have to let him go.”

The line went dead.

Elsa sat motionless. Eyes wide. Hands clenched. *I can’t ask him. Not yet. Should I tell everything to him now?*

Back in the present, Elsa leaned back and said, voice soft, “There once was a princess… This is for a novel I'm writing.”

And the truth, wrapped in fiction, spilled out like a confession in disguise.

Each word was careful, as if she were testing the weight of her truth hidden behind make-believe.

*This is still fiction, right? Just fiction…* she reminded herself. *He doesn’t need to know it’s real. Not yet.*

Kazuya listened, not interrupting even once.

Until—

Kazuya is serious. His eyes fixed on hers. “Are you this princess? Be honest.”

Elsa met his eyes. “Of course not. I’m just an academic. Writing fiction.”

Her lips curved into a smile, but her throat burned from holding the rest in.

*Don’t show too much, Elsa. Not yet.*

She tried to smile. But her voice betrayed her.

Kazuya didn’t press. But something in his chest tightened. *If you break my trust by keeping something from me that I deserve to know now, Elsa... everything we're building, everything, will be over.*

He had chosen her, laid bare his darkest secrets. *I expect that same truth from you. For me, love isn't just about feeling; it's about trust. If you can't give me that, completely, then how can we truly face the world together?*

“I think the princess should fall for someone unexpected,” she said. “Someone kind. Someone brave.”

“Like… a nobody?” he teased.

Elsa nodded.

She looked down for a moment, brushing her fingers across the rim of her cup.

Then, almost a whisper: “If I made him—the love interest—inspired by you… what do you think he’d say?”

She peeked at him over the edge of her lashes. Her pulse raced.

Kazuya stared at her for a beat longer, then smiled. “He’d probably ask where to sign.”

Then his tone shifted—more grounded, more certain. “And if I were him? Let hell break loose. I’d stand beside her. Go back to that damn country. Declare my love. Even if guns were pointed at us—better to die with the woman I love than live in regret.”

Elsa blushed—hard. Her heart thudded so loudly she feared he might hear it.

She looked down for a moment, brushing her fingers across the rim of her cup.

*Would you really? Would you fight the world for me, Kazuya? Or is this just a dream I’m foolish enough to narrate?*

Wayne here.

A Ronin member posted this last week in our group…

https://preview.redd.it/jpufyjxwoaef1.png?width=1482&format=png&auto=webp&s=00caa496374eb8613bfb3e9ecca6ffe08f22415e

Now here's what caught my attention, This guy has built an incredible asset. 200,000 business buyers and sellers.

But for whatever reason he’s having trouble turning it into money.

This is a common problem. More common than most people realize. These folks aren’t gonna come out and tell the world…

“Hey, I’ve built this awesome group… but I’m struggling to monetize it.”

At the same time, those same folks who build these audiences are secretly hoping someone will come along and offer to help them.

Because lots of times, People who are amazing at building audiences are not that great at monetizing them.

That’s because these are two different skills. It's kinda like a real estate project. Take building apartment complexes for example, The company that builds a 200-unit complex is rarely the same company that manages it.

Why?

Because building an apartment complex and managing one are two completely different skills.

The construction company is great at permits, contractors, and getting the thing built. But tenant relations? Rent collection? Maximizing occupancy?

That's a whole different skillset.

So what happens?

The builder hands it over to a property management company. The property manager monetizes the apartments.

Both make money. Both are essential. Neither tries to do the other's job.

The builder built it. The manager monetizes it. It’s standard practice in real estate, But online communities and audience owners don’t always have this figured out.

That's where you can step in.

The person who built that 200k member group is probably amazing at audience building. Content creation. Community engagement. Growing followers.

But turning all those people into revenue?

They need a partner who can help them, But you’ve got to make the first move.

The best first move I know of is to join Royalty Ronin. Right now we've got Ronin making helping audience owners turn their communities into cash machines.

Not as service providers getting scraps, But as profit partners getting 25% to 50% splits on revenue they generate.

[**====> See how to get your pile of profits from an existing audience**](https://honeysyed.com/ronin)

Think about it. What's easier?

Spending months, maybe years, building a 200k audience from scratch...

Or finding someone who already has one and helping them monetize it?

The audience is already there. The people are already engaged. They just need someone who knows how to turn engagement into income.

PS - You don't even need to know how to monetize the group. If you bring a good deal you can partner with a Ronin to monetize it with you.",1,1753133558.0,ContentMarketing,0,1.0,False

1m5vouy,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m5vouy/i_cant_feel_pain/,I can't feel pain.,"As the title says, I can't feel pain. Not a slight scratch on a my finger, to the extreme, if I got stabbed. Many people ask me why I don't feel pain. It's more of a ""can't"". I was diagnosed with this disorder when I was probably about 5. I was outside playing with my older brother, Michael, when he had gotten mad at me during a game of tag. All of a sudden he came sprinting towards me, toppling onto me and breaking my arm. When he saw the bone in a very awkward position, he screamed and started pacing. ""Oh my god, oh my god, what am I gonna do?"" ""What are Mom and Dad gonna say?"" During all this, I was laying on my stomach, face planted in the soft, green grass. Few minutes later, asked why I wasn't yelping in pain. I told him I couldn't feel it but definitely believed my arm wasn't where it was supposed to be. Mom came outside a few minutes later and saw me. She screamed at my brother, but had a very puzzled look on her face at me. ""Honey, are you okay?"" she asked quietly. ""Yes, I'm fine mom, but you seem to be worried sick."" I said muffled. ""Ok...."" she said. So she took me to the ER immediately after I gave her that answer. When we got to the hospital, my mom immediately screamed for a doctor or nurse to help me, my face turning scarlet red out of embarrassment. There's definitely something wrong with me, I kept telling myself. When a doctor finally took me and my mom, I was rushed to a room. The doctor did all the usual things, vitals, blood pressure, you get it. But then he asked me, ""How much pain are you in?"" And I said ""None, but my arm feels kinda funky though."" The doctor gave me the same look my mom did. After putting my arm in a cast and telling me the whole schpiel, he went to go talk to his colleagues. He came back a few minutes later with a melancholy expression. "" The doctors on the floor have spoken and I am diagnosing you with CIP, or congenital insensitivity to pain."" ""What?"" I said, like I totally wasn't expecting it. My mom looked incredibly confused. ""Can you explain? I can't understand."" ""When you saw Kyle laying in the grass this morning, his arm broken, was he yelling for pain? Was he screaming?"" ""No"" she said. "" Hey mom, I have a superpower! Isn't that sick? Go tell Michael I'm cooler now!"" I said during the deafening silence. Soon after, we left the hospital and returned home. My mom told my dad when we got home and was confused too. Few days later, he didn't remember I even had CIP. That's dads for you, I guess. 

Fast forward a few years, I never told anyone about my disorder, not because I was ashamed, but because I wanted to see people's reactions. Since being in middle school is the definition of being cool, I would say I am. But one day, my friends and I were playing on the large soccer field. One of them ran at me with a sharpened pencil. I saw it out of the corner of my eye but decided not to run. The pencil pierced through my flesh underneath my ribcage. Blood oozed from the pencil. And then everyone began to scream. They screamed for teachers, anyone that could help. ""Hey! Help! Help! Someone pierced Kyle with a pencil!"" my friends screamed to any teacher that was paying attention. The one who ran at me just looked in awe at me, blood dripping down the side of my tiny body. ""Why aren't you doing anything?"" he asked. ""Oh yeah, I have a superpower, man, I can't feel pain, or as doctors call it CIP."" He just answered plainly with an ""oh"". When a teacher finally came over, she stopped dead in her tracks, looking at me. Her face went pale white and she asked to get the school nurse. ""Who is responsible for this?"" she asked angrily. My friend raised his hand slowly and she took him by the arm. When the nurse came out to help me, she even squealed and flinched while removing the bloody pencil. ""Well, thankfully your friend didn't get your ribs or else you'd be in a lot more trouble. You should stay home and get some rest. It's gonna take a few weeks for that to heal."" So I did. I later heard my friend got suspended for a week for that. Kinda deserved it though, but then you have Mr. Can't-Feel-Pain over here. And thats what CIP + middle school equals. That's today's lesson, kids. 

  
High school and college only got more intense. Again, I never told anyone about my condition. This time I did it to stay a little mysterious now, especially for the ladies. Most of my friends were good-looking and attractive. Not so much for me, I guess. In my eyes, i couldn't feel pain and I was terrible at talking to women. But I was really studious in class. Sometimes before class began, I'd jokingly say about any girl in our class, 'her canteltilt was far off' and everyone would laugh. Sometimes I'd take my hot coffee I'd bring to class and pour it on my arm, watching it bubble and redden my arm. Everyone would clap, then I'd grab some towels and clean up my mess. That would give me a spark of confidence, and then I would just go back to the weird kid

In my early years of college, I finally felt like I fit in. Most guys, though, were either stone-cold drunk or just stoned when they came into class, not that I cared. Most guys had girlfriends that had the thoughts of ' yeah I'll hang off the side of this boulder' or 'I'll jump over this ridge for you"", pretty much doing anything that would make a girl fall in love with them. With me, I could offer so much more. One night, I was out with all my friends when I said ""Take the bottle of vodka and smash it over my head."" Everyone stopped and looked at me. My friend Sam stopped me and said ""are you sure? That's a little extreme."" ""Trust me"" I said. So Sam asked the bartender for the bottle, took the bottle of vodka and smashed it over my head. I closed my eyes and waited. Soon I felt a burning sensation and blood dripping down over my face and onto my clothes. ""Man, are you ok?"" everyone said. ""I'm fine, look at me."" I said drunkenly. All the girls in the bar looked at me, astonished, and after their screams, they slowly came up to me and called a doctor for me. "" It told them, my speech slurred, 'Hey, I'm Kyle, I can't feel pain and it's my superpower."" ""What?"" they all exclaimed. ""Yeah,"" I said. And that's where we catch up to modern day. 

Today I am 24 years old, have a girlfriend and have a lot of friends who like my so-called superpower. Every year before I blow out the candles, I hold my fingers over the flames and everyone oohs and aahs over it. Then I blow out the candles. 'Are you sure it doesn't hurt?"" my girlfriend Jessica asked. ""I'm sure."" She leans her head on my shoulder and we have a minute of silence before we cut the cake. After we ate and opened gifts, I asked if everyone wanted to see more of my CIP, and everyone said yes. ""Thank you so much for the great party and the best gifts. Here's one more thing to end it all."" So went into my kitchen, took a pot, and filled it with hot water and went over to my friends. I think sometimes they think I should be in a psych ward, but I know they all truly love me as a friend. Anyway, so I took the hot water, poured it on my left hand, and dropped the pot on my foot. Everyone squealed and looked at me. They wanted to make sure I was okay, and like a magic trick, I raised my hands high above my head and gave bows to everyone, saying ""Thank you, thank you one and all!"" And that's what it's like to live in a body where you can't feel pain.

Ch1



You know how you sometimes hear people talk about the job they had for decades, and you think to yourself, “Wow, I don’t think I could ever dedicate that much of my life to a job.”? Well, you’d never hear that from me.



I understand why a lot of people say that, though. People value their autonomy; young people think they have more of it than they do. I’m not saying that because I’m older and wiser— I’m twenty-five years old. I don’t exactly have weather under my wings. Autonomy was something that never really came into play for me. 



When I graduated, I got my first job immediately so I could help my parents out and try to pay for college. It wasn’t a long and rigorous process to find it. It took about a week. I found a listing on one of those job-matching sites. I can’t remember which one since it was years ago, but you know the sites. I distinctly remember the listing itself, though. It was different from the ones I’d seen a hundred times already, the sea of Machine Operators or Retail Associates, or the CNAs. This listing read:



**“Watchman - Third Shift. No Experience Needed!”** 



I clicked on the listing. I was unsure what to make of what I saw. The topmost description read, *Neighborly Watchers is a high-end, community-based security firm!* That was it. It didn’t even state where the company was based out of. The company’s website didn’t have any information about its ownership or even a Careers Page. All it seemed to contain was a homepage with a black and red eye logo and a **Contact Us** page. That page contained a field to send an email and a 250-character space, presumably to give a short synopsis of your need. I swapped back to the listing and scrolled down.



**“Job Requirements - High School Diploma. At least 18 years of age. Able to walk, stand, and run if needed. Reliable transportation required.”** 



I was a little surprised upon realizing I did meet all of these criteria. I was a little confused about why they didn’t require more, like some sort of credential. I wondered if they had a licensing program as part of their onboarding process. My curiosity still piqued, I looked for some kind of posted wage. I found it.



“Woah.” 



The word escaped my lips. This low bar, seemingly entry-level job was listed as having a two-hundred-thousand-dollar annual salary. 



“There’s *no* way this is real,” I said to myself. I knew logically that there was no rational thinking person who would be willing to pay a six figure salary to someone with no experience or qualifications. I could hardly guard my dinner plate from my dog, much less foil petty local crimes.



But my eighteen-year-old brain still saw dollar signs. Plus, I figured that the worst I’d end up with is wasted time filling out an application I’d never hear back on. I began to fill out my information. I checked that everything looked as meticulous and polished as I could make it. I sugarcoated every detail that didn’t require exact metrics. By the end, I thought I’d done a pretty decent job of sprucing up my resume, considering I had very little work experience.



With every intention of continuing to search more listings, I submitted the application. I was redirected to another page. The new page acknowledged the submission and gave me a corporate pat on the back for my gumption. I clicked the site’s home button. 



*\*Brrrriiiiiing!\**



I jumped at the sound and sensation in my pocket. Like an idiot, I’d set my iPhone’s ringtone to resemble a rotary for the obnoxiousness. Instead of being useful, it tended to serve as my own personal audio sting.



My phone rang again as it slipped out of my shorts pocket. I realized how little grip I had as my phone clattered to the floor, sliding to a stop below my computer desk before I could read the caller ID. It rang a third and fourth time as I reached under the desk and scooped up my phone. Vexingly, the phone’s ringtone had stopped chiming. I tried to open my phone app, but my phone began ringing again. This time, I could read the caller ID: 



**“CAREERS.NEIGHBOR.WATCHING”.**



Quickly, my thumb jumped to tap ‘answer.’ I put the call on speakerphone and opened my mouth to apologize for the initial slip. Before I could speak, I was stuttered by a pleasant, but robotically measured female voice.



**“Hello, Casey. We are** ***so*** **excited to receive your employment application, and we would like to confirm your address on file. Yes?”**



“Uh… uh, yeah? Yeah.”



**“Great! 2587 Small Lake Rd?”**



“Yes, that’s the o—“



**“Great! You will receive information about your orientation in the mail soon!”**



“Okay, great! Tha—“



*\*click\**



I sat with my mouth hanging open, staring at my now-sleeping phone. The call was undeniably weird, but I was curious to see if this company would actually mail anything to me. 



I decided I wouldn’t tell anyone about this at first. It sounded like the most blatant scam of all time, and I didn’t know how to explain what I’d be doing to my family. No one had told me anything, and the job requirements didn’t contain a list of duties. The job only had one on-the-field requirement, and it wasn’t exactly worthy of a family newsletter: 



“Able to walk, stand, and run if needed.”



However, that other requirement for reliable transportation revealed itself to mean far more than my ability to commute. 



That afternoon, I received a small cubic package in my mailbox. The package didn’t have a shipping label with a recipient name. When I asked my parents about it, they told me they hadn’t ordered a package. Since it wasn’t for them and I had zero interest in knocking on my neighbors’ doors to ask them, I took the package into my room. It was only after I had entered my room that I noticed the Neighborly Watchers company logo thinly printed on one face of the box. I returned to my desk and peeled away the small strip of packing tape that capped the little prism.



Inside was a wound-up cord, twist-tied to a black chunk of plastic. It looked slightly bigger than a smartphone. I fully extracted this from the package and found a smaller, circular rubber piece protruding from what appeared to be the base. With no instruction manual or schematic, I had to discern for myself that this circular piece was a suction cup. I checked the end of the device’s electrical input and, upon removing the shipping plastic around it, I realized that this plugged into a car’s cigarette lighter. Looking back at the small box and catching my first look at the thin, rectangular digital display, it clicked what I’d been sent.



From a loose, thumb-sized knot of cord, a small slip of paper dangled. I noticed this slip as it dislodged from the tangle and drifted lazily towards the floor. I grasped and unfurled the small paper. It was the size of a business card and had a black and red eye logo. On this slip was a short, handwritten message:



“Due to commonplace malfunction of contemporary navigation technology, this unique system was designed by Neighborly Watchers to assist new employees in finding their way! Just plug into your vehicle, and the device will do the rest. Welcome to the neighborhood, Casey! See you Monday at 11 PM.”



The note wasn’t signed by anyone, but a little smiley made of blue ink was sloppily scribbled where a signature would have been. I now had a job. Like I said, it wasn’t a long or rigorous process. In hindsight, it happened disturbingly fast.



I wasn’t dumb. Well, I *was* dumb, but not dumber than the average high school graduate. I was sure that I was being duped in some way. Truth be told, I was skeptical about plugging that device into my car. It didn’t *have* to be what they were saying it was. Furthermore, it was weird that they were using an old-school GPS like it was the early 2000s. It looked like cheap garbage to me, and they sent it through the mail in a matter of hours from responding to my application - not to mention their reasoning for doing so, which had been ‘due to commonplace malfunction of contemporary navigation technology'. Did they mean that if I searched for the address on Apple Maps, it just wouldn’t appear? And where was the address of my job? It wasn’t in the package, and it wasn't on the note. This was all very odd. Don’t get me wrong here, I saw every one of these red flags.



But I like money. The way I saw it at the time, I’d already given these folks my personal information. The worst I could have imagined happening was that my time would be wasted. It was a rare low-risk, high-reward scenario. And as far as the address went, I had an idea. 



I walked outside to my car, suctioned the base of the device to my dashboard, and plugged it in. The cord length was perfect for the angle I’d set the device to. Immediately, the display flashed a pixelated black eye with a red pupil, imposed over an ‘‘NW’ logo. I chuckled at the Etch-A-Sketch vibe of the image. I waited five seconds before my theory was proven right.



“**In fifteen feet, turn left.**” 



This command chimed out of speakers that I didn’t even realize the device had, while a digital black arrow flashed on the LED display. I nodded and unplugged the device. It was three PM on Friday. I had until Monday at eleven PM. I took the device back inside, and my job search was officially concluded that evening.



Monday came, albeit slowly. The weekend was pretty uneventful, and I spent most of my time sitting in anticipation of an unbelievable job. I *really* tried to make my way out of the door before my parents got up. I’d rather not have tried to explain this beforehand, but my luck eluded me.



“Where are you headed off to so late?”



I jumped at the voice of my dad. He and Mom were on the living room couch as the coffee machine whirred in the kitchen.



“Uh… I think I got a job, guys.”



“You *think* you got a job?” My dad raised an eyebrow.



“I have orientation today, so hopefully I’ll know for sure soon. But yeah, I *think* I have a job.”



“As a secret agent or something?” My dad’s joke would have been funny if I didn’t feel so on the spot.



“Some kind of security thing,” I answered. “I’ll know more specifics soon.”



My dad nodded. His suspicion had been facetious, at least for now.



“It’s impressive how fast you found that,” Mom chimed in, signaling her support while thinly veiling a somewhat concerned look. 



I felt a small pang of guilt.



*Maybe you should just explain*, I thought.



“Let us know how it goes!” My mom said, now beaming at me.



“Sure thing,” I said nervously.



After grabbing my sandwich bag from the fridge, I waved to my parents and hurried to my car. Buckling my seatbelt, I squeezed the power button of the GPS. After the characteristic click of cheap plastic, the device hummed to life, flashing the company logo.



**“In fifteen feet, turn left.”**



I pulled out of my parents’ concrete driveway and made a left. I connected my phone’s Bluetooth to listen to music. I had no idea how long this drive would be, but I’d do my best to enjoy it. For some reason though, my car’s speakers wouldn’t play music. I knew they were on because I could hear feedback buzz when I maxed out the volume. I tried in vain for several minutes to fix the problem, but my efforts ceased when I was almost made to leap out of my skin.



**“TURN RIGHT.”** My car’s speakers blared, to my utter bewilderment.



I looked up from my distraction and saw the turn coming fast on my right before I could process the audio hijack. I stomped the brake pedal and wrenched my steering wheel to the right. Calling that an illegal maneuver would be an understatement.



As soon as my bumper passed the threshold of the turn… I don’t know. It was like the thick woods that ordinarily surrounded my neighborhood simply stopped. Like it was unrendered terrain, or like a different part of the world manifested in the landscape’s proper place, it’s hard to describe.



Before my eyes stretched a seemingly endless road. The tarmac drew out and away towards the failing light on the horizon, bordered by grassy plains. I realized I could take my car up to full speed on this road, because there was absolutely nothing for miles. The early summer sunset gave me just enough light to see that there were no houses, farms, small shops, irrigation lines, or planted crops— not even another patch of woods. The farther I drove, the more I began to realize that there wasn’t even another road for me to turn onto. This area was truly just a green sprawl with a single rocky gray stripe, running North to South for an untold distance.



“Wha— Where did *this* come from?” I disbelievingly asked out loud.



**“In five miles, arrive at destination.”** The GPS’s robotic male voice jolted me out of my hypnosis.



I took a long inhale and gripped the steering wheel. The first-day jitters and the sheer oddity of everything began to hit me at this point. Then, as if on cue, the screen on the device began to flash erratically. My distracted eyes darted from the GPS to the road, and back again. Sometimes it appeared as a wash of white, and sometimes as what looked to be fast-moving lines of computer code.



Amid my distraction, I barely noticed that my car had veered halfway off the road. The car’s right hand tires banked several inches from the tarmac into the grass. My chest lurched and I yanked the steering wheel back, trying to ignore the rave happening in my peripheral vision. Although my navigation was down, I knew that at least for now, my path was a straight shot. As I regained control of the car, my eyes were able to focus on something distinct.



A pair of houses began to fade into view. They were still miles away and hard to see in the fading sun, but the shapes were unmistakable against the vast nothingness that had swallowed them. As my vehicle approached, the colors began to fill in. Pristine white houses with picture-perfect, freshly cut lawns began to dot the road. By the time I’d reached the first, I realized they stretched for a mile before stopping. 



At the edge of the neighborhood, a small building roughly the size of a glorified phone booth (a phone booth and a half at best) came into the beams of my headlights. It was black and hard to see in the dark, but I recognized it immediately as my destination as it sported an obnoxiously red eye logo. As I pulled up, the GPS finally stopped strobing. This was where the road ended.



“In time: eleven PM.” 



Ch2



I blinked at the device, the nature of which I was now beginning to question. I got out of my car, which for some reason now began to feel like a shuttle on an alien planet. I used my remote lock and the car’s headlights kicked off, dousing me in complete darkness. The night air was cool and smelled vaguely like wood smoke. The neighborhood was soundless. No dogs barking, or people on their porches. If there hadn’t been cars in every driveway, I’d have thought the neighborhood had collectively gone on vacation. 



The jingle of keys in my pocket was deafening against the thick silence of the neighborhood. Even though my booth and vehicle were almost a quarter mile from the nearest house, I found that my hand flew to my pocket to hold my keys in place. My gut was telling me that I needed to stop making noise immediately. I felt sick to my stomach. I didn’t know why, but I felt like I was going to be punished if I didn’t keep quiet. I sheepishly stepped inside the place, latching and bolting the metal door behind me and finding the light switch. A fluorescent white bulb snapped on, illuminating the entire booth. It was somewhat comforting to be in a locked, lit space.



With this new light, I spotted a handle dangling from somewhere above the doorframe. I gave it a small tug and with a slight metal groan, a retractable aluminum barrier began to unfold from a slot in the ceiling. I looked down and saw a latch bolted into the floor about an inch and a half from the door of the booth. With a slight breath of gratitude, I pushed the barrier back up.



On the smallest desk I’ve ever seen lay a piece of paper under a remote. I sat on the small chair, picked up the remote, and read:



*Hello there, Neighbor!*

*Please turn on the television to begin your orientation!*



* *:)*



“What television?” I muttered to myself, looking around. This post barely had enough room for me!



I stood up from the bench and scouted the interior. I didn’t see a television screen, but after checking most of the booth, I did finally notice a mirror in the corner. I took a few small shuffles over to stand in front of it and regarded my reflection. I had a lengthy gaze at my dull green, baggy eyes and emotionless expression. I looked at my shaggy brown hair and my chapped lips. I thought the jitters I had in the car were because of the new job and the GPS, but at that moment, I think I realized that they’d been following me for years before this. I didn’t want to think about that. 



Shaking myself back to reality, I hit the power button on the remote in a somewhat doubtful hope of locating this elusive television. I saw a flicker of light on the wall to the right of the mirror. I took a step backward, noticing now that this flicker was coming from both sides. 



“What the hell is that?” 



I couldn’t help but voice my confusion as my eyes tried to make sense of the information they were getting. I stepped forward, putting my hand on the mirror. To my surprise, it had an immediate upward slide. I sent it up to a hatch in the ceiling, much like the barrier hatch at the front door. I now had an unobstructed view of the light source.



The aforementioned television, the size of a computer monitor, had been hiding behind the mirror and was now beginning some sort of generic onboarding video. I was met with a tiny red and gray welcome screen and the corporate, falsely optimistic sound of instrumental contemporary pop. An older man appeared on the screen, bidding a warm greeting and an unnaturally full, white smile for his age.



**“Hello, Casey! Congratulations on beginning your first day as a Neighborly Watcher. We want you to start off confident and capable, so we have crafted this orientation video so that you understand what exactly it is you’ll be expected to do. Neighborly Watchers is a high-end, community-based security firm, and our goal is to keep an eye on the neighborhood. You’re going to help us do just that.”**



I grabbed the miniature office chair on the opposite end of the booth and took a seat. I reached into my sandwich bag, figuring this would be the best time.



**“The listed pay is legitimate, you’ll be delighted to know! Don’t worry about health insurance, either. You’ll have a great selection of generous insurance packages during the next annual enrollment. We believe in providing our employees with the best possible compensation, and in return, we expect the highest quality performance.”** He took a breath, cleared his throat, and took a sip of water.



“Did they not edit this?” I muttered, chewing my sandwich.



**“More good news, Casey— our expectations are incredibly simple. Your job duties are generally not dangerous. If you do your job right, every night here in the neighborhood will be quiet and peaceful. The only way real trouble begins is when you** ***don’t*** **follow the rules.”**



His fake nice demeanor suddenly dropped. He leaned in, and I saw his green eyes falling away from the obvious script that he’d been reading. He focused very closely on the camera. My own green eyes widened in surprise.



**“I don’t want to scare you, but it is** ***very*** **important that you listen to these rules and expectations now. This job is straightforward, but any error could jeopardize you or Neighborly Watchers.”**



His messaging connected with my apathetic eighteen year old brain. I found myself shifting uncomfortably in my seat as I felt the weight of responsibility hit my body. I leaned towards the screen, steeped in anticipation.



**“Your job duties are as follows:**

 **You will spend most of the night at your post, here. During your designated patrol time, marked by a loud bell chime, you will exit this post and do a lap around the road, cul-de-sac, and outer edges of the neighborhood. This is your default patrol route.”**



**“Please locate the rulesheet and keyring placed under your desk, next to the yellow box.”**



I turned my gaze downward and grabbed both the keys and the rulesheet, and slipped the keys into my pocket. I fixed my gaze on the paper as the man on the TV continued:



**“Let’s review the rulesheet together, to make sure we’re on the same page. In the future, be sure to refer to your rulesheet often. It is your greatest asset for your continued safety and success as a Neighborly Watcher!”**



I listened to the man as he spoke, giving voice to the printed ink in my hands:



**“1. Remain at post except for designated patrol times.**

 **2. Leave the post during designated patrol times. Do not reenter until patrol time has ended.**

 **3. Lock your vehicle as soon as you exit to begin your shift. DO NOT LEAVE IT UNLOCKED.”**



I quickly glanced toward the door and hit my key fob. I already locked it, but you can never be too careful. My car honked back at me, muffled through the walls.



 **“3b. Whether you are entering or exiting the post, lock the door behind you. DO NOT**			 **LEAVE  IT UNLOCKED.”**



I anxiously shuffled my way to the door and turned the deadbolt, as he continued:



  **“4. Do not interact with or take anything from residents. This includes food or drink that did not come with you into the neighborhood.**

**5. On patrol, if you see anything out of place which is easily correctable, you should correct it. For example, if there is an open window on a property, close it and walk away.**

**6. Ticket properties that deviate from the property care guidelines.** 				**DO NOT knock on the door; place citations in the mailbox associated with the offending property.**

**7. Keep track of the whereabouts of your Neighborly Watchers company device at all times.”**



I made a mental note that the plastic hunk was suction-cupped to my dashboard.



**“8. If a car alarm sounds during patrol, ensure that patrol time is still ongoing. If patrol time has ended, return to the post immediately. If it hasn’t ended, remain on the current patrol route.”**



“What? What does that even mean?” I scoffed. Not that the TV man could hear me.



**“9. In the very unlikely event that a situation has escalated beyond your control, you can find an emergency kit under your desk. It is a yellow box that can be unlocked with your door key.**

  **10. Leave your shift ON TIME at 5:30 AM.  This will be before most - if not all - residents wake up.”**



I was officially confused. Some of these rules didn’t make any sense to me. What’s the worst that could happen if someone offered me a coffee or something? Besides, who’s roaming around at this time of night anyway?



**“If you do not wish to continue with this job, please arrange the post as you found it and leave. However, if you’re still on board: Welcome to the neighborhood, Casey!”**



I quickly re-scanned the rulesheet, quietly reading them out loud to myself. I moved to turn off the TV, but noticed the orientation video was still rolling. The music had stopped, and the man seemed to have concluded his presentation. He stood unclipping a microphone he’d pinned to his shirt. After a few moments of silence, I could hear the sound of approaching footsteps coming from the TV’s right-hand speaker.



**“Good take, Mr. Custos.”**



**“Thanks, Enea. I hope he-”**



The screen froze on the last frame, returning me to solitude. I felt a strange new kind of trepidation in my newly regarded environment. I shut the TV off and leaned back in my chair, digesting the information from the orientation video. The video had been the first thing I’d heard besides my own breath and footsteps since I clocked in. The subsequent silence that filled the space made me shiver.



Ch3



The silence was broken by a loud, droning metallic twang. The noise attacked with a muted crash, a low-pitched drone erupting from it. The sound lingered for an uncomfortably long time, stinging my ears as it warbled, slowly pitching up into a whine that made me wonder if the windows of the booth were going to shatter. I tried to shake off the physical imprint the noise was leaving, and quickly made off to do my job. 



When I stepped outside, the neighborhood had fallen silent once again. The smell of woodsmoke returned. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and crossed the street to head for the main housing area, taking the crosswalk. The sound of my footsteps echoed and faded down the empty road. I made it to the first house and got my first good look at the street.



At first, I was infatuated with the grandiosity of the homes. Every house was big— two stories, white walls with black rooftops and black trim, and half-acre yards. Every house had two cars in the driveway. Finely crafted black sconces leaned out from everyone’s doorframes, bathing their walkways in a dull orange glow. Their freshly cut lawns were now a-mist with early morning dewdrops. At first glance, this looked like a night in suburban America.



However, a strange unease consumed me as I realized something: Every house –  every car – almost everything on the properties was identical. Every house had white walls with black rooftops and black trim, with half-acre yards. They weren’t varied in form or design at all. It appeared that one house had been copied and pasted across every single plot. I understood that individual developers tended to buy up multiple properties in order to rent them out, often leading to homogeneous neighborhoods. When I say copied and pasted, I mean every blade of grass… every loose twig in the yard… appeared identical – duplicated over a near mile distance. That wasn’t the weirdest part— the oddest detail I noticed was that every house bore the same number on its facade. Everyone here shared an address.



Despite the weirdness of my orientation and the eerie atmosphere, the rest of my night was largely uneventful. I followed the rules. I closed a few open windows, I adhered to the signal bells, and I made sure to listen for car alarms. Most of the time, I was just at my post listening to podcasts I had saved. There weren’t any cameras or responsibilities in there, or so it seemed. My shift ended before the sun came up, and I was home in bed before my parents had risen for their own jobs.



To my surprise and probably yours, a twenty-five hundred dollar payment was actually deposited into my bank account two Fridays later. This was a legitimate job, and I was getting paid an absurd amount of money. At the end of that year, I filed taxes and received no hassle or letters of suspicion. 



As I became accustomed to the routine and memorized the rules, work started going suspiciously smoothly. I was still distrustful of the job for a few months after orientation, but eventually it became my unquestioning normal. My salary warranted the skepticism of my dad, and I tried to avoid the topic with him at all costs. No interview, no on-site supervisor, and a doctor’s wage didn’t exactly sit right with him. I knew he wanted to press harder, but Mom had my back. 



I eventually moved out, and my salary made the transition to home ownership quick and easy. I even offered to buy a new home for my parents, but my dad had no intention of letting that happen. It hurt, but I understood why.



That was my daily life for about seven years— walking around, closing the occasional window, issuing a citation once in a blue moon, and playing video games. But nothing this good comes without a catch.



An incident of my own doing happened when I was twenty-three. By that time, I figured that half a decade’s worth of experience had afforded me a pretty solid sense of how the rules worked. They were indeed easy to follow. My GPS never left my car. Tasks like locking doors and turning lights on and off became ritualistic. I did a once-over of the list nearly every night, going over each individual step in my head to verify that each task had been completed in order. 



Were the nature of some aspects of my job weird? Of course they were. But none of it was expressly harmful, as far as I could tell. For example, I never understood why I was being asked to close people’s windows at night. At first, I thought it was a neighborhood ordinance to combat home invasion or something. With how strictly enforced this ordinance was, you’d think there would be more crime in this place, but there never was. I would know if there *was* crime, because you know, I watch for it. 



I began to wonder if the window rule instead served to protect the neighborhood from something that might get out. That still didn’t feel right, but it was the best theory I could conjure up on the matter. The point is, the innocuousness of the task itself and the ambiguity of the consequences were enough not to warrant an urge to rock the boat.



I have to admit though, as much I wanted to be a good employee, there were still boats that I *was* itching to rock. I was a little annoyed at times with how often I had to go somewhere just because a bell told me to. I understood it was my job to patrol the neighborhood, but I felt that the strictness of the schedule was overzealous.  
  


I hope my boss doesn’t see this, but I had started sneaking my Xbox into the booth with me so I could use the booth’s TV to help pass the time. On a night when I had been sent back to my post early by a distant car alarm, I was feeling particularly compelled by my journey as Doomslayer. I decided to cut into my patrol time a little, and for the first time, was given a good reason as to why these rules are in place. My phone’s alarm clock sounded, signaling the beginning of patrol. I sat back in my chair, quieting the alarm.



That familiar, quiet but ear-piercing chime began. By this point, I had become acclimated to it. I no longer had such an immediate and harsh physical reaction. However, as I continued mashing my controller, the expected time-out of the chime never came. It just continued growing louder… and *louder*… and ***LOUDER*****.** My hands seized up as this Shepherd’s Tone crescendoed into a shrieking cacophony. My head began to feel like it was pulsing. My controller fell from my hands. The thud it made upon hitting the floor was inaudible to me as I shot up from my seat.



“**Jesus Christ!**” My eardrums roared. 



The center of my head felt as if it was about to burst. The blood vessels in my head bulged and constricted. My hands flew up to clasp my temples in a pointless bid to stave off the pain, as I choked out an agonized scream. I could feel my temples undulating against my fingertips. My eyes and ears throbbed with excruciating pain. I stumbled over my chair towards the door, focus oscillating between walking and shielding my ears. I was becoming sickeningly dizzy. I fell into the front door, clawing for the handle and barely managing to find it. The door swung open, and I collapsed into the damp grass outside. I kicked the door shut behind me as I took ragged, labored breaths.



Then, all at once, it was silent again. The inner pandemonium had stopped, and I was returned to the familiar cool night air. The smell of woodsmoke exacerbated my plateauing headache. I waited for the world to stop spinning. My vision slowly cleared. The pressure in my head faded. The mercifully cold wind washed over me, cooling my swollen face. I carefully picked myself up, and locked the booth. Those particular nightly patrols were plagued with ear pain and a constant ringing sound.



For the rest of that week, my ears and head ached. Having seen my pain worsen to the point of being bedridden, and with the sudden development of a bloody post-nasal drip, Mom drove me to the hospital. It was the first time since I’d started this job that I’d taken a vacation. 



I don’t *really* understand a lot of the medical jargon that went into my diagnosis, but I got the gist when I spoke to the ER doctor— I had suffered some kind of cochlear trauma, and I would experience hearing loss even after the injury healed. He reassured me that my hearing would likely be restored over time if I avoided further injury. He also prescribed ear drops and antibiotics, which my mother nearly broke traffic laws attempting to collect. She seemed more concerned about my partial deafness than even I was.



Discovering the potentially dangerous nature of my work really sent Mom into a stir. Dad – and now Mom too – tried to persuade me to retire the security gig and go to school, and I was inclined to agree with them. The occupational risks were beginning to outweigh the exponential financial growth I’d experienced over the years. But I have to be honest, despite the newfound anxiety that plagued my considerations of returning to work, I was ultimately resistant to the alternative. I didn’t want to exist in the traditional work structure. I liked that I got to spend the majority of my nights alone, and that I made good money for following these minute, albeit strange rituals. 



When my dad eventually came to offer me a job working with him, I turned it down. I wanted to be able to retire early with all of my assets paid off. I wanted to be able to pursue something in life that wasn’t work— I could travel the world, I could bury myself in some kind of art, and never worry about money again. My dad saw this decision and reasoning as immensely irresponsible, and we had a major conflict over it. It ended with my dad telling me to “get your shit together before you get yourself killed”, and hanging up the phone. We never managed to see eye-to-eye. 



My parents never understood my work. I couldn’t explain it to them, because I also didn’t understand. But I was a grown adult and homeowner now, and I was allowed to make decisions like this for myself. I would live with the benefits, and I would live with the consequences. As far as I was concerned, that had nothing to do with them. I returned to work when the injury had healed, much to my parents’ chagrin.

I woke up incredibly early today to exercise, read multiple essays, clean my apartment, and reorganize parts of my room. All of this is highly unusual of me, especially before my 8 hour shift at work. When they asked how I was doing, I mention all of this. They congratulated me on my productiveness. I mention to them I feel scared and I hope I can find balance during this to which they answered “why? you’re getting so much done. it’s a good thing”. This enrages me as I feel like my mental health disorder is looked at as just a quirk and not something that can derail my life as it has before ( they are aware of this ). I’m leaning more toward this person being incredibly ignorant and selfish enough to not see their ignorance in this conversation.I am so frustrated that this thing I battle everyday is spoken about as if I had too big of a cup of coffee and not that I’m losing my

1m5vndt,https://www.reddit.com/r/TripWanderers/comments/1m5vndt/what_to_do_with_3_days_in_miami/,What to do with 3 days in Miami?,"Just got back from an incredible 3-day trip to Miami and wanted to share my experience to help others plan their visit. I've broken down the perfect itinerary that combines the best of Miami's beaches, culture, and natural wonders.

Day 1: South Beach & Art Deco District

Started my morning walking along Ocean Drive, taking in the famous Art Deco architecture. The pastel-colored buildings are stunning, especially early morning when the crowds are thin. Spent a few hours at South Beach - the water is crystal clear and the people-watching is unmatched. Pro tip: rent a chair and umbrella, it's worth the extra cost.

For lunch, hit up Lincoln Road Mall, an outdoor shopping area with tons of restaurants. The Cuban food scene here is incredible. Finished the day exploring the Wynwood Walls - mind-blowing street art that makes for perfect photos.

Day 2: Everglades Adventure

This was honestly the highlight of my trip. Booked an airboat tour through Gator Park (https://athometouch.com/miami) and it was amazing. The 40-minute ride through the ""River of Grass"" gets you up close with alligators, exotic birds, and if you're lucky, Florida panthers. The wildlife show afterward was both entertaining and educational - watching the alligator wrestling demonstration had everyone on the edge of their seats.

The tour guides really know their stuff and share fascinating facts about the ecosystem. At $42 per person, it's totally worth it. Book in advance though - it fills up fast, especially during peak season.

Day 3: Little Havana & Biscayne Bay

Started at Little Havana's Calle Ocho, watching the locals play dominos and enjoying authentic Cuban coffee. The vibrant neighborhood feels like stepping into another country. Try the local restaurants - the Cuban sandwiches are life-changing.

Afternoon was spent on a boat tour around Biscayne Bay. Seeing the million-dollar homes on Star Island and catching glimpses of downtown Miami's skyline from the water gives you a different perspective of the city.

Extra Tips:
- Getting around: Use ride-share apps or rent a car. Public transport isn't great.
- Weather: Bring sunscreen and a light rain jacket. Weather can change quickly.
- Timing: Early mornings are best for outdoor activities to beat the heat.
- Food: Don't stick to tourist spots - some of the best food is in small, local places.

If you only have time for one activity, I'd strongly recommend the Everglades tour. It's uniquely Florida and gives you an experience you can't get anywhere else. You can check availability and book here: https://athometouch.com/miami

This itinerary gives you a good mix of city life, nature, and culture. Miami has something for everyone, whether you're into wildlife, beaches, art, or food.",1,1753133412.0,TripWanderers,0,1.0,False

1m5vflh,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1m5vflh/should_i_finally_let_go_of_the_woman_i_still_call/,Should I finally let go of the woman I still call ‘the love of my life’?,"I (25M) met my ex (23F) at a friend’s party and felt something ignite that I’d never felt before. From the first moment I saw her, talked to her, I fell immediately in love. Same weird humour, same dream of a small family and a cosy place to call home. And the greatest part, that spark was mutual. There and then I said to my friends and to her ‘this is the woman of my life’. For nearly two years we managed to keep building on that dream.

The beginning was though. She went immediately after making ‘it official’ on an exchange program abroad. We managed extremely well with a lot of visits from both sides and our love was flourishing. When she came back. Everything went even better and our relationship was on a peak.

Then 6 months later life hit hard. She left for a 2 months-long internship abroad just as I slid into burnout and depression at work. My go-to move when I’m scared is to cling and criticise, hers is to shut down and protect her space. The more anxious and sharp-tongued I got, the farther she stepped back. I realise I said some things I shouldn’t have said and created irreparable scars. We planned on living together and even got an apartment, but eventually the stress, anxiety and her avoidant nature catches up and we ended things ‘mutually’ 

Since the breakup every single contact has started with me. If I sent a supportive text, she replied warmly, but she never initiated. A part of me interpreted that warmth as a door still cracked open. Another part knew it was just politeness.

I accepted it was the end, but after 1.5 months of on-and-off contact, something clicked in my head. I WANT this back, she is the woman of my dreams, I can’t give up. I wrote a 3 page letter, made an online picture album with our nicest memories and some storyline and invited her for a walk. We talked, things went well, but she indicated that she doesn’t think it will work, that she needs a ‘fresh start’. I felt like her avoidant side was speaking. When I told her I still loved her, she said she loved me back. How does this make sense? How can you then just give up?

Instead of giving her space, I went to her place to meet her again, and things escalated. I kept pushing for clarity while she kept pulling away and giving mixed signals. She kissed me, but told me that she didn’t want anything. It all didn’t make sense and I snapped. I left and afterwards it felt like her final goodbye.

Another 1.5 months passed, with almost no contact. I reached out some times to wish her good luck with her exams, to congratulate her on some achievements, and every time SHE started a warm conversation, asking me how I am, how life is progressing and bringing up memories from our past. It felt great, but every time our conversations ended, she was never the one reaching out again. Since our break-up, she never reached out ONCE. She is just starting her new life, moving into a new place, getting a first job and so on. It feels, due to her avoidant nature, that it is ‘easy’ to continue since she pushes everything away and her environment supports that.

Now a few days ago, 3 months after the breakup and after 1 month of no contact, we had what felt like our final call. I asked if she’d meet for coffee before I leave on a long trip. She hesitated, flipped through her calendar, then said she thought meeting would only reopen wounds. I tried to respect that … but my voice broke and I told her life felt duller without her. She stayed soft yet steady and said the connection was real, but our “collisions” always outweighed it. My voice started to tremble, she stayed calm. I told her for a final time what she means to me, I told her again I love her, but that now I will disappear. We ended the call. No message since.

Logically I get that the door is closed. Emotionally I keep whispering, “Maybe in six months, when we’ve both grown, we’ll bump into each other and realise the spark is still there.” I don’t know if that hope is healthy optimism or pure self-torture.

So I’m stuck in the middle: half packed for a new life chapter, half convinced I just lost the person I was meant to build it with. If you’ve been here, you’ve loved big, lost big, and struggled with whether to kill hope entirely, how did you decide? Did closing the door fully free you, or did leaving it open ever lead to something better down the line?

1m5vesa,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m5vesa/daytrip/,Daytrip,"When I was 6, I was trapped in my family's cellar. I was convinced the dusty, dank dungeon had a hidden treasure that was waiting to be uncovered. Armed with a shovel and treasure map that I drew, I braved the darkness. After shuffling around for a couple of minutes, my imagination scared me by convincing me the shadows I saw were monsters. I swung the shovel wildly, knocking down a storage wrack of beans and corn. I was pinned beneath the metal frame, crying out for help. In my desperate screams, I managed to lure a spider to my location. The arachnid gingerly crawled onto my face, as if I was just another inconvenience blocking its path. Its eight eyes stared into mine. Tears poured from my eyes. I begged for it to leave me alone. Then, the opening of the cellar door bathed me in sunlight. The spider scurried off of my face. My father, equipped with a dour look, hoisted the metal frame off of me. I sobbed into his shoulder as he patted my back. From that day forward I was tormented by neighborhood kids with a song set to the tune of Ring Around the Rosies:

Stuck inside a cellar, With an eight eyed feller. Hungry, Hungry, It’s teeth bite down.

For what it’s worth, it was clever. However, it got old quickly. Winning in a game of basketball? The spider bite must’ve made me better. Got scared by a movie? Hey, at least it wasn’t a spider. I had nightmares, and became agoraphobic. We moved from Oklahoma to Oregon. The fresh air, and new environment, allowed me to shed my old self. I made a friend named Quincy, who quickly gave me a nickname. I was no longer “Spider-Man,” or “Eight Legged Freak,” but instead I was known as “Swamp Thing.” With my name being Marshall, shortened to Marsh by my parents, it didn’t take a genius to come up with “Swamp Thing.” Quincy and I were inseparable. We talked comics, games, and Power Rangers. He was my best friend. We had countless sleep overs, and just as many ghost hunts. Our friendship lasted from third grade to our junior year of high school.

The last day I spoke to Quincy in high school was a rough one. While we had smoked weed pretty regularly, and even played basketball games while stoned, Quincy wanted something stronger. He started taking acid and LSD. Whether he was dipping joints in it, or just tossing it back, he was constantly on a bender. I pleaded with him to quit. I even tried taking him to a cabin to kick it cold turkey. Nothing ever took. The distrust and anger he had in his eyes when he discovered that I had told his dad is a look I’ll never forget. If looks could kill it would have skinned me alive. At 17 years old he was taken to rehab. We lost all communication. Sure, I felt guilty, but what would anyone have done in that situation? I did what I could.

My senior year of high school was uneventful. We won state in basketball, I got accepted to a college with a decent film program, and I even managed to score a date for prom. Graduation came and went. That summer was a blur, filled with nothing but stony viewings of 80’s B-horror movies. I made my college basketball team as a walk-on and played a total of 47 seconds in a blow out loss. My roommate was cool enough. He was mostly quiet but could manage to crack a joke here and there. But for the most part, I was lonely. I missed my parents, but mostly I just missed Quincy. We were friends for nearly ten years. I was never good at making friends. It was Quincy who befriended me.

I was nearly a complete agoraphobe by the time fall break came. I was suffering from panic attacks and nightmares nearly every night. I was missing class more and more. Going from straight A’s to C’s wasn’t ideal, but I convinced myself that a trip home over break would reset my brain. The fresh forest air would fill my lungs once more. Now all I had to do was figure out how to bottle it. Begging my parents for a plane trip home was an uphill battle. To put it plainly, we were broke. My dad relied on the government, having destroyed his knee several years ago, and my mom was a manager at a Target. However, they managed to pull some strings and get me a red eye. My roommate drove me to the airport, and was persuaded to get some donuts from a local 24-hour place. They were as stale as our conversation, but at least the coffee also sucked. Most of my belongings could be stuffed into a duffle bag, but my backpack almost worked as well. As much as I’d love to bring all of my clothes home to wash, I didn’t have the money to check a bag.

When I landed back in Oregon I could instantly feel relief. The all too familiar airport that smelled of cigarettes felt like home already. As I made my way to the airport restroom I called my mom. “Hey sweetie! How was your flight?” “Eh. It was okay. Can’t complain much.” “That makes me so happy.” “Mom, are you in the car? It doesn’t sound like you are.” “You didn’t get my text?” I check my inbox and see two text messages. One from my mom, and one from a number I don’t recognize. She had texted me “sorry, won’t be picking you up. someone special is though.” I angrily spoke back into my phone. “Mom? What the hell?” “Marshmallow, you’re going to love who picks you up. I promise.” “Dammit. Okay. Will you at least have breakfast ready?” “You know I will.” I hang up and immediately take some aspirin from my bag. I chew it as I rub my temples. Stress, anxiety, and panic all start to settle in. No. I can’t let it. I’m home, and apparently someone special is here to take me home. It’s going to be okay.

“Read the sign asshole! I’m well within my right to be here!” I hear a voice yell from the pick up area. A security guard is arguing with someone in a landscaping truck. “Sir, you don’t even have to leave, you just can’t be parked here.” “How about I park my foot up your ass?” I can tell by the colorful language that the man in the landscaping truck is my ride. It’s Quincy. I quickly toss my bag in the bed of the truck and hop in. “So sorry officer, I got off of the plane late.” “Marsh, don’t apologize to this bitch, he’s not even a real cop. Probably didn’t trust him to not shoot his dick off.” He peels out of the arrival area, flipping the bird as he does.

The first few minutes are quiet. The tension is so thick you could chew it. We both go to talk first but neither can muster the courage to. Quincy is the first to break the silence. “So…I heard you made it to ASU? How’s that?” “What? Oh, yeah. I mean…it’s cool. Not what I was expecting.” “Cool, man. Any cool classes?” “Yeah. Um…I really like my Rock Music & Culture class.” “Sweet.” After ten agonizing minutes, we’re back to being best friends. We had a ton to catch up on. As nice as that was, however, nothing we talked about had any substance. It was the same regurgitated opinions we had since high school. We were both afraid to bring up the elephant in the room, afraid of anything real.

By the time our argument of “Who would win in a fight between Green Lantern and Aquaman,” had ended, Quincy was parking at a national park nearby my parents house. I turned to him as if to say “what the fuck?” but he was already talking. “Look man. I just need a day with my best friend.” His eyes were already tearing up. “I know I fucked up. I should have texted you, I should have called you. But I was angry. I hated you. To me, you ruined my life. You got me sent to rehab. My dad can still hardly look at me. And I blamed you for the longest time. But while I was in rehab I learned about accountability. You never made me take acid or LSD. I did that shit on my own. And it stopped my life for three years. That’s time I don’t get back. But I can try. So please, Marsh, just give me one day with my best friend again.” I was skeptical. This was real. He didn’t just address the elephant in the room, he gunned it down. “Wow Q. That was super…gay.” He chuckles and flips me off. This is the least I can do for him.

We hiked for a good 15 minutes before we made it to a spot we used to go when we ditched class to get high. I felt 15 again. Quincy was digging through the log we used to stash weed in and pulled out two ziploc bags. Two joints in each. I was practically drooling. Since starting college I have stayed pretty clean. I never drank, and was too dorky to even approach someone about buying. Not that I would even have the money to buy weed. “Indica or sativa?” asked Quincy. I was already prying a bag open before he got the question out. He laughed as he handed me a lighter. Some things never change. Within minutes we were debating the morality of the death sentence with all the grace of a hippo on ice skates. “Yo, wait. Did your ziploc have anything written on it?” “Yeah, it says Daytrip.” “Okay, fuck. I fucked up.” “Why?” “Don’t freak out. Those were dipped in acid.” My blood immediately begins to boil. “I thought you were clean! What the fuck are you thinking?” “I forgot to throw them out. Don’t be a dick!”

I started hyperventilating. I could feel my throat closing up and my skin burning. I could feel tears welling up in my eyes. I attempted to stand up, but I felt the moss reach up and pull me back down. As Quincy mumbled to himself about set and setting, I started picking at the moss trying to free myself. Whether it was intentional or not, he drugged me. I decided to let him know my feelings. “Do you ever spend more than five seconds thinking about what you’re going to do next? Or are you just cool with casually fucking someone up because you can’t spend more than a minute with your own thoughts?” He didn’t look at me. He wouldn’t. So I kept at it. “You’ve always been like this. No one can be better than you. No one can have it better than you. Is that why you asked if you could pick me up? So you could fuck me over?” “Your mom asked me to pick you up because she knows you’re depressed.” He still wasn’t facing me. “Yeah, I’m jealous of you, but I wouldn’t do anything to hurt you. We were best friends.” He was right, and that just made me angrier. I got in his face so I could really get my point across. “You’re a fuck-up. You’re going to die in the town you were born in because you are a dime a dozen burn out. I’d laugh if it wasn’t so fucking sad.” He shoves me. I’m much bigger than Quincy. Taller, and heavier. I don’t move. He does. And the momentum sends him tripping over the log.

CRACK

“Q?” No response. “Come on man, quit playing. I’m sorry.” His legs laid over the log, his upper body just out of sight. I carefully approach, afraid to disturb the stillness of it all. Quincy’s pale green eyes stare up into nothingness, blood pooling under his head. A jagged rock protruding from the ground managed to lodge its way between his skull and spine, a single tear rolling down his cheek. The more I look at the injury the worse it gets. Gray matter evacuates his skull, and bits of flesh are ripped away. I cradle him in any way I can without disturbing his body. I weep over him, begging God and the Devil to make a deal to give me my friend back. I run out of the forest hoping to get cell service. I managed to find a signal in the parking lot. Before they can even ask what my emergency is I am already spewing whatever information I can. “My friend fell and I think he may be dead. I’m at Roger’s Landing. Please hurry. Fuck, I almost forgot we’re about a mile deep.” I sprint back, ignoring the burning in my lungs.

“Please god, Quincy wake up!” I scream. I know he’s dead. Begging will achieve nothing. “Stuck inside a cellar.” I turn around so fast I nearly fall over. “Q?” He’s…smiling? “With an eight eyed feller.” My heart drops through my whole body. How does he know this? “Q, you’re scaring me.” “Huuuuuuuuuuuungrrrrrrrrrrrrry.” “Fucking knock it off!” “Hungry.” “LEAVE ME ALONE!” “I bite down.” Quincy’s body begins to convulse violently. Blood and foam form an unholy union as it escapes his mouth. His neck begins to elongate, and the flesh tears. His head detaches from his body, giving me a clear view into his skull. Inside his skull, eight eyes stare back at me. Very gingerly, eight legs begin to poke outside. A spider roughly the size of a baking sheet evacuates my friend's neck stump, wearing his head on its abdomen. “Fuck.” The words barely escape my mouth before I’m sprinting through the woods.

Branches rip and tear through my clothes. The cold air stings my lungs to the point that it hurts to breathe. My legs start to give out. I fall to my knees and vomit the donuts I had eaten earlier. Tears rush from my ducts as I double over in pain. I cry, loud and in pain. Before I can feel too sorry for myself, I gather myself. Weeping won’t change my situation. I’m in Roger’s Landing, maybe 3 miles from cell service. My body hurts, my friend killed himself, and a spider hatched inside of his body. The forest is a big place. If I make my way back it likely won’t find me. I snap a branch off of a nearby tree and take a few practice swings. It won’t help me but it will make me believe I stand a chance. After a quick pep talk, I start to walk back. If only I had seen the bear trap, and if only I remembered I was also on acid.

Hot blood rushes into the snapped bone. My screams turn into coughs. I attempt to use the branch to pry the bear trap open. It snaps, and the teeth bite back down on my already ruined ankle. I fade in and out of consciousness for several minutes, if not hours. I open my eyes, and I’m once again at prom. Val and I are dancing. Quincy is pounding on the window outside of the dance. When I look back at Val she is ripping her face off yelling “THIS IS YOUR FAULT.” I’m a child again, eating dinner with my family. Suddenly the spaghetti I’m eating starts to get stuck in my throat. I look down at my plate and realize I’m eating hair. Not just any hair, but my hair. I feel my head and I’m bald. I start coughing. I’m in my car. It’s on fire. Firefighters are ignoring my pleas for help. They laugh as my skin melts and my bones crumble into ash. My mother hands me an urn. “Your father’s in there. He wouldn’t want you to blame yourself for what happened.” As she walks away I try to grab her arm, but it turns into spiders. I run away, and fall down a flight of stairs. I crash into a storage rack, and it pins me down. I frantically look around for help. I look up and Quincy is standing over me. He opens his mouth so wide his jaw unhinges. Spider legs sprout from his throat and pull me in.

I’m awake again. The sun is setting, and my sweat is chilling. My mouth is so dry that I choke when I try to breathe. I roll to my stomach, and manage to slip my backpack off. The airport water, that cost way more than it should have, has just enough water to fill my mouth once. It’s not much but it’s enough. I check my phone for a signal, and I’m lucky enough to see I have one bar. I text my mom “I love you. I’m sorry.” By the rustling of leaves I know I’m not alone. I roll back over and sure enough, stalking me through the branches, are eight red eyes. It doesn’t run. It doesn’t leap. It walks to me, and from what I can see it has gotten bigger. Whatever happens next, I’m not dying without a fight.

I swing at the spider, and my fists have little to no effect. It turns around and Quincy is staring at me. His jaw falls off as he begins to speak. “This is your fault. Your words…your actions…you’re a monster. It’s why you’re alone. It’s why you’re afraid. You’re a cornered animal. It’s a shame you have to die out here alone.” Millions of tiny spiders clump from his nose, mouth, and ears. I frantically swat them off, but there’s too many. Thousands of dagger-like teeth bite down into my flesh. I can feel my muscles stiffen. With one last ditch effort, I reach for the front of the spider, clutching one of its fangs. I rip the beast's tooth from its maw, and stab it into its abdomen. If I die, I’ll take it to hell with me. I stab until I can’t tell the difference between our blood. I stab until my adrenaline wears off. I stab until I can’t.

The first thing I can see is a shadow. It’s my mom. I can’t tell by the blur standing in front of me, just by her voice. Shapes begin to have detail, words start to have meaning. “How long will that take?” “Honestly, Mrs. Booths, that’s up to him. A lot of people take a few weeks. Some never do again,” replied the doctor. I’m in a hospital. My head is pounding and my ankle is throbbing in pain. I fight the feeling but I fall back asleep.

It’s been years since the incident. The paramedics found him first, head still attached. Quincy had died instantly. I was found nine miles away from him, covered in my own piss and vomit. My left leg resembled a sausage that got caught in a paper shredder. It had to be amputated due to infection, but I relearned how to walk. Verne Bennet, Q’s father, visited me several times in the hospital. He became a father figure after my own dads death. I had zoned out while driving and his seat belt wasn’t on. That accident was the reason why my doctors found my cancer. It’s not bad being bald, but when you’re also missing half a leg you can’t help but question god. I’m the same age that my father was when he passed. After all this time there’s only one thing that bothers me: why did the doctor tell me there was no acid in my system?",3,1753132854.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

Today, we are back in our home with our four cats and are expecting our first baby in early 2026. Unfortunately, my partner and I really struggle with envisioning and pulling the trigger on furniture. We would be ever grateful for some help from the r/DesignMyRoom community if folks have suggestions.

In terms of budget, we want to invest in well made and comfortable furniture as much as we can, but have no problem with IKEA or similar brands when it makes sense (our cabinets are IKEA with custom doors we sourced locally), which helped us conserve budget for the more expensive elements of the project. For a couch/sectional, I don’t really see ourselves going over $3,800 unless it was a really special piece. We are glad to buy used/vintage and on Facebook Marketplace, I have a truck so can pick up furniture locally without a problem, and are generally open to any and all creative ideas that don’t detract from the beauty of the natural landscape. 

For starters, I think a curved sectional would be beautiful and would break up a lot of the straight lines present throughout the house, but my wife isn’t sold on the idea. We also have no idea what to do with the rug, carpet, coffee table, side table, or plant situation. We have purchased a Samsung The Frame TV (55”) for over the mantle, which appealed to us since we can disguise it as a painting.

My group was able to meet a lot earlier for the back half, and we hammered this one out in a marathon session. We had a good time but were all varying stages of tapped out by the end, haha, but I hope you enjoy! There some additional notes for the whole scenario in the initial post, so take a peek at that as well.*

*And, of course,* ***this and the previous post constitute one colossal spoiler for Reverberations****, even with a lot of the community and personal additions I ran with my group. Consider yourselves adequately warned, and now, on to the story!*

# May 12th, 2016

We have six members of Delta Green’s Q-Cell partaking in Operation PANACEA HAZE:

* Agent Quartz, Dr. Palmer (anthropologist)
* Agent Quasar, Dr. Schell (astrophysicist)
* Agent Quigley, “Buddy” (tradesman, shooter)
* Agent Quetzalcoatl, Kurtz (hacker, martial artist)
* Agent Quinn, Wolfe (FBI agent)
* Agent Quill, Wrenhill (investigative journalist)

**Morning**

*Enter Wrenhill*

Donowitz reaches out to Q-Cell for a meeting at an abandoned factory off I-90. Kurtz takes his vehicle to the scene along with a preliminary report on the investigation. He emerges from his Honda into a light, drizzling rain. Donowitz is waiting, alongside a flannel-clad woman wearing a backpack with a hardcase at her side.

Donowitz holds an almost comically large black umbrella over both of them. He introduces Kurtz and Wrenhill to one another. Wrenhill is an investigative journalist and Delta Green Friendly, and has been assigned to the case by A-Cell. The way Donowitz introduces her, Kurtz suspects she’s being scouted for full status as an Agent.

Donowitz hands over an analysis, conducted by Dr. Kamaroff, on the Reverb dose the team had provided. He also promises to look into any local Delta Green assets that may be of assistance. Kurtz and Wrenhill head back to town, and speculate that Donowitz is holding back information about the Tcho-Tcho and the broader context of the case.

Kurtz and Wrenhill return to the Chicago safehouse, and the latter is introduced to the rest of Q-Cell. They compare notes as a group, and agree that Shifty Shooters, the dive bar Kurtz had identified earlier, is a useful place to gather intelligence on the local underworld near the Tcho-Tcho district. Schell and Wolfe stay behind to read Kamaroff’s report, and Wrenhill, Kurtz, Buddy, and Palmer head to the bar.

*Dr. Kamaroff’s Report*

Wolfe and Schell study Dr. Kamaroff’s report on the Reverb dose they sent in. Kamaroff identifies the dose as a commercially available gel cap filled with MDMA cut with a (mostly) powdered sugar filler, as well as a trace element of a naturally-occurring alkaloid. Kamaroff and a Friendly scientist she collaborated with could not identify the substance specifically, but noted similar chemical compositions to common psychedelics.

They speculate that it is likely psychotropic with generalized central nervous system effects. Beyond this, they’re unable to come to any definitive pharmacological explanation for Reverb’s highly peculiar effects on its users.

*Shifty Shooters*

Kurtz enters the bar first, orders a pint, and discreetly sets himself up in a corner. Palmer and Wrenhill take up a seat at the bar, and notice that a woman is hustling one of the pool tables quite expertly. Buddy watches her latest mark slink away in defeat, and challenges her to a game. It is closely-fought, but Buddy manages to prevail. She introduces herself as “High” Sally, and Buddy makes a point of buying her a beer with her money.

Palmer and Wrenhill approach Buddy to congratulate him as strangers, and eventually the latter excuses himself, leaving Sally alone with them. Sally invites them outside for a smoke.

While Kurtz and Buddy silently observe them from inside the bar, the trio get to talking. High Sally pulls out a pouch of tobacco and a sheaf of rolling papers from her bag.

She then produces a small Reverb pill, breaks it open, and sprinkles part of its contents into the cigarette before resealing it. She blames her earlier loss on not “getting her edge on” earlier, and finishes rolling.

She lights the spliff up and offers it to her companions. Palmer politely declines, and Wrenhill takes a single puff, taking care not to inhale. Wrenhill is briefly pulled into one of Sally’s memories in a similar fashion to Schell’s experience at Club Overground.

She, as Sally, buys a small bag of Reverb pills from a scruffy and irate man whom she calls “Bad Luke”. She is cognizant that Sally is getting a bit of a deal for this much product, and Bad Luke grows angry when Sally addresses him as “Riggs” in conversation. Wrenhill, despite her shock at the experience, surmises that Riggs is Bad Luke’s legal surname.

Wrenhill’s awareness merges back with reality. She gets over her initial surprise and works with Palmer to recruit High Sally as an informant into the Reverb distribution ring. Sally accepts Wrenhill’s money, and says she’ll get back to them when she’s able to arrange a meeting. Q-Cell’s Agents depart Shifty Shooters separately over time, with Kurtz heading out last, and regroup at the safehouse.

**Afternoon**

*Interviewing “Roofie""*

DEA Agent Justine Huynh calls the group back with some information she has been able to glean from law enforcement sources. Using a physical description provided by Kurtz and Schell, she has determined that “Red” (from whom they had purchased Reverb earlier) was in actuality Raymond Winstead, a known small-time dealer who has been in and out of prison over the years.

One of his known associates, Rufus “Roofie” Brown, is currently in police lock-up for an apparently unrelated heroin charge. Huynh thinks Rufus is involved with Reverb’s distribution, and recommends that they interview him. Wolfe asks Huynh if she has heard of a “Bad” Luke or Lucas Riggs, and she’s unfamiliar with the name, but promises to look into it when she has time. Wolfe heads over to meet Huynh at the police station.

Wolfe and Huynh meet in the parking lot of the precinct where Roofie is being held, and speak with the desk sergeant once inside. Wolfe says that he is on official FBI business, and asks to speak with Brown in his cell. The sergeant is somewhat hesitant to provide this level of access to a detainee with such short notice, but agrees to let Wolfe in for a few minutes.

Wolfe leads the interrogation with Huynh observing. Roofie is uncooperative despite Wolfe laying out the evidence against him. He rebuffs Wolfe’s offer to assist Roofie’s current predicament by astutely pointing out that he’ll likely walk due to the absurd caseload of the Cook County court system.

Wolfe, grasping for an “in” but sensing he’s gotten under Roofie’s skin, points out to Roofie that such an eventuality will absolutely look like he cooperated with a Federal investigation in exchange for leniency. Roofie considers this in the context of his own suddenly darkening future, and reveals the source of Reverb: one Spider Jay.

Spider Jay is a more senior figure in Chicago’s underworld, and rents out an entire floor of the Excelsior Hotel in a medium density neighborhood elsewhere in the city. Roofie’s only been to Spider’s place once, but remarks that the latter had installed an array of cameras around the building. He also comments that Spider, while not a particularly impulsive man, is very dangerous when crossed.

Wolfe and Huynh thank Roofie for his cooperation, and give him some unlicensed legal advice before departing. Huynh promises to look into Spider Jay, and will contact the team when she has more information. Wolfe returns to the safehouse and shares the good news with the rest of Q-Cell. 

**Evening**

*The Green Box*

Donowitz contacts the team and provides them with a coded phrase they recognize to be coordinates for a Green Box in the greater Chicagoland area. Palmer and Wrenhill volunteer to go to recover the Box, and they grab some equipment and head out on I-88 to the indicated area in Wrenhill’s Jeep. Despite the mounting darkness and the winding country roads, they reach a forested area well into the greenbelt west of Chicago.

Cutting their way through the underbrush with machetes and carefully concealed flashlight beams, they spot a tiny, discretely placed green trailflash. They’ve arrived at their destination. Palmer and Wrenhill dig for an hour, and eventually exhume a three-by-one foot metal box with a weathered olive drab powder coating. They fill the hole back up, destroy the trailflash, and return to the safehouse.

Despite the late hour, the team eagerly awaits the return of Palmer and Wrenhill. They carefully lay the box out in the garage, and Wrenhill wrenches open the lid with a knife. The most immediate noteworthy item inside the box is a M79 40mm grenade launcher, complete with a six-shot leather bandolier with 3 remaining fragmentation grenades. The M79 is well preserved and drenched in cosmoline, and the rounds seem to be usable, although Buddy’s opinion on the matter may be somewhat suspect.

*Agent Chase’s Journal*

There is also a small journal on top of an ornate wooden box. Wrenhill takes the journal out, and with the assent of the rest of the team, reads it aloud. The journal belonged to (presumed Delta Green) Agent Chase. He was working with mercs deep in the Cambodian jungle in early-to-mid 1969 looking for some sort of ruin or artifact.

He describes his conversations with Duy, their best scout and only Tcho-Tcho squadmate. Duy, often giddy after particularly brutal fights, would carefully top off a small wooden pipe with a dried black flower that he would grind by hand into what Chase described as a “fine powder”.

He would burn through it in a single impressively long drag before laying back and staring up at the sky, sometimes for an hour or more, completely lost in a daze, muttering in languages that Chase only sometimes recognized.

He observes that the other local mercs, hardened and dangerous as they are, were terrified of the Tcho-Tcho in general and Duy in particular due to their brutal conduct on and off the battlefield.

Despite this, Chase and Duy develop a rapport as outsiders in the group and comrades-in-arms. One evening, while he's coming down from a trip, Duy tells Chase that he had left his young sweetheart behind in his village in Laos in order to seek his fortune in the war. Chase in term reminisces about his old flame from his college days. He begins to see Duy in a different light, and the two become friends of a sort.

Chase, after some time, asks Duy why he and his kinsman act with such cruelty and violence. Duy replies that the Tcho-Tcho are treated by outsiders almost reflexively as anathema. They feel at a deep level excluded from the rest of humanity, and this has greatly embittered them to the outside world over time. “Better to be feared than loved”, Chase muses, and Duy agrees.

One fateful day, Duy is slain in a firefight with Khmer Rouge forces. The rest of the mercs wouldn’t go near his body or his kit. Chase, perhaps alone among the band, is saddened and shocked at Duy's death. The latter was a fearsome but pragmatic warrior, and yet he had calmly stood up from cover and exposed himself at the worst possible moment, taking a round square in the forehead. He had a smile on his face as he fell, Chase recalls.

Chase doesn't write for a few more days, but a later entry reports that the mercenaries were getting restless as their search dragged on. Chase nonetheless was confident he would locate “the temple” soon. It’s the last entry with any writing. The next few pages are ripped out, and the rest of the journal is blank.

Q-Cell sits in thoughtful if mildly shaken silence after hearing this, with some more disturbed than others. Palmer sighs, and picks up the final item in the Green Box. It’s a small humidor, and contained within is an ornately carved wooden pipe and a leather bag with a few grams of dried Liao.

# May 13th, 2016

*Yes, this was Friday the 13th. I checked*.

**Morning**

Q-Cell, despite their general sense of professionalism, oversleeps. They are groggily awakened in the mid-morning by a thoroughly incensed Agent Huynh. She tells Wolfe that the holding cell where Roofie was being held was utterly eviscerated in the same fashion as Jaime Navarro’s bedroom, and that the suspect was nowhere to be found when a duty officer made their rounds the following day.

She demands to know “just what the hell is going on” and accuses the team of being untruthful with her regarding their identities and objectives. The rest of Q-Cell quickly weighs their options, and decides that bringing Huynh into the fold is the best move given the circumstances. They convince Huynh to meet them at the Chicago safehouse, and she arrives shortly afterwards.

Q-Cell levels with Huynh regarding the nature of their specific mission while obfuscating its broader context and the existence of Delta Green itself. She is shocked at this revelation, but the team picks up that she seems perhaps less surprised than they would expect.

Huynh ponders this for a tense moment before agreeing to help the team with their case. When the team inquires as to her motivations for assisting them, Huynh cites the obvious threat, as well as the opportunity to learn more about her and her family’s past and its connection with the events of the present day. She promises her discretion, and provides them with what she was able to dig up on the infamous Spider Jay.

Spider Jay, real name SGT Jacob Silas Simmons, U.S. Army (ret’d) is a black male in his early thirties. He is a combat veteran with two tours in Afghanistan. While he has no criminal record stateside, he was accused of smuggling and subjected to a court martial during his time overseas, but was acquitted and received an other-than-honorable discharge.

Despite this, he returned to Afghanistan with Academi (formerly Blackwater) as a mercenary. Huynh attempted to look into Spider’s record with the company with the help of a sympathetic colleague, but the latter was unable to get anyone to speak to him on the matter. Buddy opts to call Academi on his burner phone, and after spending much of the afternoon playing phone tag with different offices, is texted on it by an unknown number.

Buddy calls this number and speaks to an anonymous voice-masked Academi rep who’s willing to divulge details of Spider’s confidential records. The informant reports that Spider was repeatedly disciplined for taking unauthorized solo trips to meet with local tribes, and that he was not offered a fourth contract. Palmer, from her studies of the Tcho-Tcho’s historical presence in the region, theorize that Spider acquired Liao in Afghanistan and brought it back with him to Chicago.

Kurtz suggests that Spider is probably working off a single large stash of Liao and slowly cutting into it, judging by the fairly low concentrations indicated in Kamaroff’s report. Spider then presumably provides the cut Reverb to his subordinates for further distribution. Huynh speculates that many of the missing dealers are among their ranks.

Q-Cell agrees that surveilling Spider’s apartment is the best move, and they develop a plan to do so. Huynh reports that Spider rents out the entire third floor, paying via a girlfriend, Tanyika Taasa Tillerson, who herself is unemployed. The team gathers its equipment and does a bit of research on the Excelsior hotel. It’s a freestanding three-level apartment building with fire escapes on two sides and both a central stairwell and elevator. 

**Afternoon**

As noon passes, Q-Cell arrives in the neighborhood and separately surveils the area around the Excelsior Hotel. Palmer opts to simply enter the building on her own and take a look around. She notes that the building seems to be occupied by some tenants, and that there is a security camera prominently watching the comings and goings of the residents. She doesn’t find anything else of note.

Wolfe, making his own rounds around the building, confirms Roofie’s account of Spider’s surveillance system, noting discreetly emplaced cameras covering every entrance to the third floor in the interior and exterior of the Hotel. The cameras appear to be wireless from their placement, and he relays this information to Kurtz and Schell.

Wrenhill sets up shop at a coffee spot across the street from the Hotel, attempting to surveil the entrance to the building. While discretely setting up a camera in her bag, an inquisitive barista notices Wrenhill’s equipment, and chats with her. Wrenhill convinces the barista after a fraught moment that she is a realtor doing some research on the Excelsior Hotel.

The barista believes her, and before leaving opines that in *her* professional opinion, the Hotel is a real dump.

**Evening**

Kurtz and Schell, sitting in Schell’s vehicle nearby, use the former’s equipment to attempt to gain access to the wireless network controlling his cameras. Kurtz is successful in this effort, and the team begins to employ Spider’s own equipment against him, using it to monitor movement to and from the building. Buddy and Wolfe remain nearby as backup in case of any unforeseen complications.

Kurtz, on a bit of a roll, attempts to gain access to Spider’s laptop directly. He is unable to do so and opts to cease further attempts in order to avoid compromising his access to the cameras. The team opts to surveil the apartment for a few more days before committing to a plan of action. They take shifts monitoring the cameras, now tied into Kurtz’s systems remotely, with at least one or two members of the team keeping the building under physical surveillance during the day.

# May 16th, 2016

Q-Cell maintains an unseen vigil over the Excelsior Hotel for another full two days after the previous evening. They note the comings and goings of Tanyika, who usually seems to come over around sunset and leaves the following morning. Spider himself only leaves the house once in several days, picking up a take-out order at a nearby restaurant, and usually has food delivered to the apartment once every few days.

Judging from Spider's level of access to the entirety of the building, they further speculate that he may control the entirety of it via proxies, but that the tenants are unlikely to be involved in his operations.

The team speculates on several different solutions, some more slapstick than others, including eliminating Spider discreetly by surreptitiously placing a timed explosive in his girlfriend's bag, or gaining access by posing as delivery people. They also consider simply burning the building down in true Outlaw style, but the high likelihood of civilian casualties and official attention stays their hand. They opt to keep these ideas in the pocket while continuing to monitor the building.

While they are waiting, Huynh, now more savvy to what and who she is looking for, notes that two additional disappearances have occurred amongst the city’s drug scene. The team surmises that the presumed killings will likely continue until the supply of Reverb dries up completely.

**Evening**

*Breaking and Entering*

Schell and Kurtz, while doing a late-afternoon check on their remote access equipment on May 16th, notice their access to the cameras suddenly drops out completely. Kurtz quickly realizes that Spider’s Wi-Fi network is no longer visible, and after a quick check, notes that the cameras have stopped receiving a signal from Spider’s router. Kurtz alerts the rest of the team to this development.

Meanwhile, Wrenhill, nursing a coffee and taking a stroll around the block, notices a window near a third floor fire escape of the Excelsior suddenly open. A laptop computer is unceremoniously hurled out of the window a moment later. It sails through the air, smashing into the street with a crunch. The casing shatters dramatically on impact with the pavement.

Wrenhill hides for a moment and notes that no one appears to be at the window before quickly scooping up the pieces. She places them into a bag before returning to Kurtz and Schell. Kurtz looks at the remains of the laptop and is cautiously confident he can recover something from it given time.

Q-Cell quickly decides to breach the third floor of the hotel and come up with an assault plan. Kurtz, with Schell as lookout, will attempt to gain access to the fire escape and drop it using his supposed experience with parkour. Wrenhill and Palmer, both experienced climbers, opt to attempt to scale a side of the building shielded from Spider’s unit with Wolfe and Buddy in tow.  Justine remains in the area to act as a getaway driver and sentry.

Kurtz, despite his ostensible skill, succeeds only in causing an unreasonable racket while failing to gain access to the overhanging fire escape. A light briefly shines in one of the second floor windows, but the occupant decides better of it and switches it back off. Wrenhill and Wolfe cannot find purchase on the wall and regroup with Kurtz, while Palmer and Buddy successfully and quietly ascend to the roof.

Palmer heads down the fire escape, noting a distinct lack of activity coming from Spider’s apartment, and gingerly lets the ladder down to the street. The team stack up on the fire escape, and Kurtz enters Spider’s bedroom through the open window. The room is clearly ransacked, with everything conceivably capable of acting as a container ripped to shreds. Kurtz notices a desk with computer peripherals but no computer.

The rest of the team enter the bedroom. They can hear coughing coming through the door, and have a short, silent argument about who should enter the living room first. Buddy reluctantly raises his rifle, and Kurtz opens the door for him. Q-Cell pushes into the living room, and happens upon Spider Jay, sunken into his couch surrounded by a sickly sweet cloud of Liao smoke.

*Spider Jay, At Last*

Spider is smiling to himself, eyes glazed over. Despite the team of armed strangers now surrounding him, he seems remarkably chipper. When asked why he seems unafraid, Spider simply remarks that he was reminiscing about a family barbeque at the park when he was a kid, before his dad died and his mom fell out of life.

As he shares this, Wrenhill briefly catches the scent of marinated ribs sizzling on a charcoal grill. The drug dealer, despite his fearsome reputation, is incredibly cooperative given the circumstances, and answers Q-Cell’s questions in a colloquial but truthful way, as if he were sharing an amusing story with close friends.

The generously-sized bowl of Spider’s impressive bong is filled with a mostly-ashen mound of Liao, and when asked about why he consumed so much, he simply shrugs and says that “she told him to smoke it”. When probed further on this, he has no memory of being asked about it, or the identity of the woman in question.

Wolfe quizzes him on the source of Liao, and Spider reveals that he had discovered its existence while serving in Afghanistan. He managed to get into contact with a Tcho-Tcho tribe, but the elders refused to sell Liao to him. In retaliation, he arranged for a drone strike on their village. When he returned to the country later with Academi, he got into contact with the new leadership of the tribe, who were more eager to part with the flower in exchange for aid.

Spider managed to bring back several pounds of Liao with him to the United States. After his expulsion from Academi, he reached out to contacts in his hometown and became involved with the local drug trafficking scene. He acquired equipment to mix Liao with MDMA, and began to market it as a party drug and psychedelic. He recruited assistance from other dealers to do so, and they soon began to profit greatly from the new product.

When asked where the Liao is now, he remarks that it is in a steel hard case in his room. Wolfe remarks that this case is now empty, which surprises and worries Spider. When asked what happened, he remarks that his own superiors had discovered his side hustle, and had begun closing in on his network of dealers. When asked about this, Spider furrows his brow in frustration and finds he cannot recall anything further.

*The Confrontation*

Spider’s eyes start to roll back, and he drifts into a sort of waking fugue state. Kurtz has a mounting sense of unease at the situation, and cautions the team that they should make a hasty exit. Spider begins to cackle wildly, and when asked by Palmer why, replies that he saw “the lady in the septic tank throw that FBI fuckboy off the ladder”, referencing Q-Cell’s encounter with That-Which-Was-Marlene the year prior.

They look at Spider askance as he fades in and out of cogency. He suddenly locks eyes with Wrenhill, and begins to cry softly, his mood shifting entirely. Wrenhill’s awareness fades to a girlhood memory of staying up late in a hospital oncology ward with her father as her mother’s prognosis waned further and further to an inescapable certainty. Spider softly and repeatedly apologizes to a shaken Wrenhill, tears streaming down his face.

Kurtz and Buddy decide that staying in the apartment with Spider is a supremely bad idea. They quickly proceed down the fire escape to link back up with Agent Huynh and keep watch outside. The remainder of the team stand around Spider as his narration of his experience grows more and more frenzied. He mimes carving open a person’s chest and holding up what the team assumes is their heart, before suddenly clasping his arms to his side and shivering violently.

Palmer, watching his mental state degrade before her, surmises that Spider has overdosed on Liao. She convinces the remaining members of the team that they need to employ the meditation ritual taught to them by Ms. Van Giap. Wrenhill and Wolfe are uncertain about the efficacy and safety of the ritual, but Spider’s enthused ranting about seeing a dinosaur through his window provides a convincing counterargument.

Schell, on the other hand, reaches into his pocket and produces Duy’s pipe, along with a bag of pre-ground Liao. As Spider slips into further incoherence, Schell quickly and efficiently packs the pipe without spilling any flower. He produces a match from his pocket, lights the pipe, and sucks down the fragrant smoke in a hot lungful that would have made Duy proud, wherever he was. Schell forces out a dragon-like exhale, taps the pipe out on Spider’s ashtray, and returns the pipe to his pocket.

The rest of the team stare at him for a moment before turning their attention back to Spider. Spider’s previous enthusiasm is replaced by a growing panic, and he begins to mutter incoherently about pulsing lights and waves of energy as his fingers dig into the couch cushions. Sweat begins to pour down his brow, and his breathing quickens.

Schell reaches once again into his pocket, and pulls out the curious glass sphere he had recovered from Clyde Baughman’s footlocker. He holds it out in front of them, as Palmer entreats the group to close their eyes, take a deep breath, and reflect upon a perfect sphere. To the group’s surprise, the sphere in Schell’s hand starts to glow, and he can feel heat begin to radiate from its core.

They feel the space of their minds yawn open, and Spider’s apartment dissolves away to reveal the more fundamental layers of reality, a swirling vortex of energies ancient and malevolent. The Agents have the distinct feeling of being contained inside some sort of pressure vessel, safeguarded by unknown means from the roiling forces surging around them.

They can sense Spider’s unprotected awareness flitting around wildly in the limitless space of madly crisscrossing energies, and they feel his primal terror as he begins to realize that he cannot himself escape this space, his finite human consciousness simply far too outside of its depth to act in any meaningful sense. He suddenly narrows his focus to a point within the swirling depths.

There is something lurking within the madness. It is a Stygian entity, a predatory presence that can smell the intrusion of Spider’s consciousness into its domain the way a shark smells blood in the water. The presence emerges from the maelstrom, striking out at Spider like a ray of pure, unrestrained malice. The Agents, despite their mounting panic, maintain their focus on the ritual.

It connects with Spider, and his bloodcurdling scream of “Oh God, it’s in my brain!” cuts through the nightmare space to the real world, where Kurtz and Buddy can hear it from their concealed positions. As it coils itself around Spider’s consciousness and begins to feed, the latter suddenly begins to glow with a radiance well beyond anything belonging to the electromagnetic spectrum.

The entity hurriedly tries to untangle itself from what’s left of Spider, but it is too late. Spider’s withered soul-husk explodes into a rapidly expanding singularity of blinding light, and the entity is burned away to nothingness.

The Agents merge back to reality, and the smell of seared meat fills their nostrils. Schell realizes that the sphere in his hand has grown nearly red-hot and drops it to the ground. His hand is burned raw from where he held the object. The sphere drops to the floor, and continues to glow brighter and brighter until it suddenly collapses in on itself in a pile of ash.

They turn to Spider, who is motionless on the couch. Schell, nursing his hand, looks more closely and can see rivulets of blood flowing out of Spider’s ears, nose, and eyes. He checks for a pulse, but there is none. They stand around his corpse, at a complete loss for words. Their stunned reverie is brought to a close by Wolfe’s phone buzzing in his pocket. It’s Huynh, who reported that she just saw a group of armed men storming through the entrance and up the stairs of the Hotel.

Q-Cell has little time to celebrate their victory, and rushes down the fire escape to the street below. Their egress is chaotic and rushed, with everyone save Wolfe sustaining injuries on the way down. Palmer loses her grip on the ladder and plummets to the street, spraining her ankle as she comes down in a heap on the pavement. Buddy, without missing a beat, scoops her up and carries her to safety.

Wolfe, the last one out, briefly glances at the Excelsior one last time before disappearing down an alley with the rest of the team. Huynh confirms with the team that they’re clear of the building, and anonymously calls in a report of an armed break-in with multiple suspects with the Chicago PD. She stays discreetly on the scene to monitor the outcome as the team makes their way back to their safehouse in their vehicles.

Q-Cell, exhausted, piles through the door of their rental and collapses on whatever seating is available. Schell and Palmer receive first aid for their injuries, and the team later receives word from Huynh that the police arrested Bad Luke Riggs and his posse on the scene. The team thanks her for the timely assistance, and heads to bed.

# Epilogue

The next morning, Huynh stops by and fills them in on her account of the previous evening. She promises to keep an eye out for future disappearances before heading out. After cleaning up, they depart their Chicago safehouse for good and head over to the secondary rural site to remain in the area to monitor any additional developments. The team discusses what to do with their remaining supply of Liao, and opt to return it to the Tcho-Tcho community.

While Schell keeps Duy’s pipe and a few doses of Liao for future eventualities, Buddy and Kurtz head over to Ms. Van Giap’s tea shop to turn over the rest of the bag of Liao. Ms. Van Giap is surprised but grateful, and makes a point of not asking any questions regarding how they came to be in possession of such an item.

Buddy and Kurtz thanks her for her assistance, and she in turn nods at Kurtz and remarks that Buddy is more brave than he gives himself credit for, and entreats them not to be strangers in the future. She wishes the pair and their friends well, and they head back to the safehouse after purchasing a case of tea. The team opts to not tell Donowitz about the specific contents of the Green Box (or their handing back of the Liao), and keeps the grenade launcher and journal for themselves.

Huynh follows up with Q-Cell after a week and a half to report that the unexplained disappearances have seemingly ceased overnight following the confrontation at the Excelsior Hotel. Spider's death seems to be the last one that could be connected to the case. The Windy City, thanks to Q-Cell, is now free to return to its previously scheduled levels of violence and human misery.

Wrenhill and Palmer arrange a meeting with Donowitz to deliver the final mission report. He is thoughtful at the mention of the assistance of the Tcho-Tcho, and agrees that bringing Justine Huynh into the fold was the right decision in this case, as she was an able participant in the investigation and will likely prove a valuable asset to Delta Green’s future operations. He formally inducts Wrenhill into Q-Cell as Agent Quill, and congratulates the team on their efficient work. He further comments that they have earned a break for the time being. and tells them that he will reach back out to them when the time comes.

Kurtz spends a few frustrating days carefully putting the destroyed laptop back together and is eventually able to pull viewable footage off of it. The team notices that Tanyika did not stop by Spider’s apartment on the night of his death. Instead, Kurtz notices a middle aged woman of apparently Hispanic descent walking calmly up the stairs to the third floor about an hour prior to Spider’s router going dark and Wrenhill witnessing the flight of the laptop.

Despite having eyes on the entrance during that time, no one on the team can recall seeing the woman that night. The members of Q-Cell ponder this troubling development as they return to their private lives and await their next mission.",2,1753132552.0,DeltaGreenRPG,0,1.0,False

I am writing this post to understand and get an answer to a question that is bothering me. I will explain the situation. I have just recently turned 18 years old and I have wanted to work as a bartender for a very long time, I am not looking for a summer job or a short-term job. I have been working in the food service industry for almost 3 years, and I understand how it works, but I have not yet entered the restaurant business. I have mainly worked in fast-food establishments and coffee shops as an employee, barista, and waitress. I have a few extra pounds, and I cannot call myself beautiful, but everyone claims that appearance is not the most important thing. To further understand the problem, I live in Moscow, Russia. Unfortunately, in my country, people are very strict about appearance, but they often overlook the underlying issues. I have hormonal problems and cannot lose weight quickly. I cannot call myself Quasimodo because I always look clean, wear fresh clothes, and smell good. However, the mentality is that even if you are perfect in all aspects, people still prioritize your appearance. It's possible that there's a prejudice that if someone is overweight, they're automatically weak and unfit. I always mention in my resumes that I'm extremely fit and have excellent stress tolerance, as I worked at McDonald's with a 500-person-per-hour flow, and I was ready to carry trays from the first to the third floor for 8 hours. Additionally, I'm a former swimmer with a 2nd-level adult swimming license, and my endurance is indeed impressive. Over the past month, I've gone through about 50 interviews where they promised to call me back, but as we all know, they never do. I have a well-spoken voice and a sharp wit, but even that doesn't help when they see me in person, even though they've already promised to hire me in the email. So, to the point.
I can also add that everyone is talking about the lack of staff at work. For the most part, they refuse to hire me because I don't have enough experience, but where can I find experience if they won't hire me without it? I have a certificate of completion for the courses I've taken, a medical book, and everything I need to apply for official employment and self-employment. I have the desire and strength to work, but unfortunately, they won't hire me.

Like… they’ll buy suggest we get coffee, but not a sandwich? AIO? I’m 30.","Lately I’ve noticed this pattern on first/second dates where the guy refuses to get actual food, but will still happily buy a $8 matcha, $9 bubble tea, or some specialty coffee. Sometimes ice cream for $5/person. But the moment I suggest grabbing something to eat, even something light or casual, it’s suddenly too much.

It’s always the same line. “I meal prep.” “I’m frugal.” “I don’t like to eat out too much.” And then they turn around and get a large sugar bomb drink with extra bubbles. What are we doing?

I’m not asking for a full dinner with appetizers. I’m talking about a sandwich, a wrap, maybe something from a salad bar. Nothing wild. Just something that feels like a real sit-down moment where we can actually talk and connect without standing around or wandering through parks and sitting on a bench for three hours.

It’s not really about the money either. The stuff they’re already buying isn’t that much cheaper than food. So it just comes off like they’re trying really hard to keep the date at this weird surface level.

To be honest, it starts to feel like they don’t want to risk the date feeling too much like a date. Like keeping it casual somehow lets them stay noncommittal.

I don’t know. It’s not about the food itself. Some of these dates are over 2 hours too. 

It’s the fact that they seem more committed to avoiding effort than actually having a decent interaction.

Anyone else noticing this? Or am I just asking for too much by wanting to eat something normal with someone I’m trying to get to know?",0,1753132030.0,AmIOverreacting,6,0.1,False

I suffer from generalized anxiety and depression, especially post-pandemic.  I go to therapy weekly and have check-ins with my psychiatrist.  I am also on effexor and adderall (which I only take once in the morning because I already have trouble sleeping.) Won't even drink coffee past noon.  Very rarely drink, used to be a daily weed smoker but quit back in November.  I've been prescribed benzos as needed for a couple years now and NEVER take them daily besides a few extreme circumstances in life when my dog was sick as well as family problems. 

 However I foolishly developed a kratom habit without realizing how dangerous it is because it helped with my anxiety.  I quit kratom cold turkey on July 1 (10 months of daily usage) after reading about it giving people terrible withdrawals.  Luckily I had no physical WDs but the anxiety has been a lot more frequent since quitting.  When I was taking Kratom there were times where I would go weeks or even over a month without taking benzos.  I'm so thankful to be done with it and proud for up and quitting, but the waves of anxiety are a lot stronger.  Two weeks ago I took my ativan once every other day, with some doses being lower because the fear of addiction is enough to give me anxiety lol.  I just went four days without taking any and just tried to bury my anxiety while spending time with my family on a getaway, which was great!  However now that I'm back home the anxiety has found its way back into my brain.  so is taking it 2-3x a week too frequent?  Some days I just want my mind to stop racing because the reality is my life is going really well...but god damn anxiety and stress destroy me some days.",2,1753132029.0,Anxiety,4,1.0,False

A server bot comes up and hands him a cup of coffee and a danish 

Billy: thank you auto

Billy walked through the halls of his palace eating his breakfast. On his way he passed through the dungeon and waved to his former lunch lady Jennifer Nocturne and other familiar faces locked in cells 

Billy: sup Carl (he said walking by captain nemesis)

He then walked over the bridge that passed over the indoor moat. When he reached the other side he pressed a button which dumped hundreds of points of meat into the water which was quickly consumed by a 100 foot mutant crocodile 🐊 

Finally making his way to his throne room where he sat on his throne. The great ruler of dimension 12

*beep beep beep*

Mizuma: sir a communication is coming through. It’s you know who

Billy: about time he called put him through 

A screen descended and a filtered image appeared that spoke in a filtered voice 

???: Billy enjoying being master of your domain I see 

Billy: howdy partner!! You know you don’t need the filter right? I mean I know who you are and I have this entire universe to myself 

???: one cannot be to careful when dealing with the likes of Professor Paradox and company. Now update me on the status of your operation 

Billy: whatever you say dude. Well you’ll be happy to know that everything is going exactly to plan! I made the exchange with that stranger dude; weird guy btw; for that package you arranged for and I have successfully used it to create the weapon I promised you. Although it has been taking a little while to bake if you know what I mean

???: it is an acceptable delay. Now what about the rest 

Billy: well our fake kidnapping of the redwind intelligence dude went flawlessly. That hot headed emperor never even thought that it was just a distraction while you were doing your thing right under his nose. He didn’t even question how easily he escaped! As if he could if I didn’t want him to. Also while I had him captured I planted the chip on him so we have that card to play whenever we feel like it. Not to mention my spy drones have successfully infiltrated every area of interest 

???: that is very good 

Billy: thank you I try. There have been a few speed bumps along the way. For one a little while ago there was a situation with a big tick that nearly jeopardized things; I attempted to intervene but it was made clear my efforts were not wanted nor necessary as the situation handled itself.

???: one of your greatest strengths is that they all underestimate you. Something we shall make them pay for 

Billy: you speak my language partner. Anyway following up on the speed bumps another thing is a bit of a surprise but the traveler actually handed over Planet Hathor to the red winds who upon taking possession broke up my black market operation there so we’ve lost that.

???: that news is surprising indeed. I wouldn’t have thought the traveler had it in him. I’m almost impressed. The loss of your black market operation is unfortunate but it’s served its purpose. And besides you’ve got plenty of other illegal businesses to keep your pockets filled 

Billy: yeah but it’s still a bummer. You’re right though we’ve got what we needed from it. Anyway other than that the rest of the plan has gone off without a hitch. Khyper has been collecting the dna 🧬 samples for project ultimate nemesis; he’s still yet to acquire the tetraman predator since it’s last remains are held in the red winds royal vault but we’re working on that, project gold star is set to complete construction on schedule, technician 13 has been working hard on our new Next Gen Techadon legion as well as adapting the Tennyson killing weapons I designed into them meaning soon they’ll be Omnitrix proof not to mention my new battle suit, my alliance with the celestial sapiens is holding strong of course. And the new nexus system is coming along nicely 

???: well it appears you’ve got everything running smoothly. I must admit Billions even I underestimated you.

Billy: I appreciate it thanks.

Mizuma: perhaps you should tell him about the new alliance you made sir

Billy: oh right I almost forgot. I joined a new little team with another Albedo variant and the traveler’s better looking self. We have joined forces for the purpose of defeating our mutual enemies 

???: interesting 😈. What do they know about our true agenda?

Billy: I clued them in on our new weapon and have hinted about my “mysterious business partner” but everything else I’ve kept need to know, they are ignorant of your identity. 

???: good good 😈 keep it that way for now. If they prove useful we may bring them into the fold. It would be useful to have an Albedo in our ranks again 

Billy: that’s what I was thinking. In fact the alliance has already bore fruit 🍉. He’s created a robot called V.O.R.T.E.X that has the ability to copy powers.

???: that could be handy indeed. Keep me updated on this alliance 

Billy: of course partner. There is one last less than positive thing. It’s about Tennyson

???: what has he done?

Billy: well nothing! And that’s kind of the problem. He’s mia. Nobody has seen or heard from him in weeks. 

???: WHAT!!!??!!

The screen flickered as if distorted 

???: you’re telling me our sworn enemy is somewhere we cannot observe!!! I do not like not knowing what my enemies are doing Billions 

Billy: I know. But it’s only a matter of time until he shows his ugly face again. I mean what could he possibly do? He’s got no idea we’re working together 

???: make sure it stays that way. Now I have business to attend to with the other allies. Make sure nothing jeopardizes our plans further 

Billy: yes of course partner. I’ll handle it 

The transmission ends

Billy: few. Man that guy freaks me out.

Mizuma: almost enough to second guess double crossing him 

Billy: not That much.

1m5uzmy,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1m5uzmy/why_i_also_stopped_giving_money_to_panhandler/,Why I also stopped giving money to panhandler,"I used to stop at a coffee shop every morning on my way to work. There was a panhandler out there, friendly, said good morning each day that he saw me. Sometimes I would sit out front and have a coffee and chat with him, some days I’d buy him a coffee.

One day he tells me that he’s been hired for a new job. He is supposed to start the next day. I congratulate him. Next day he’s gone, but the day after he’s back seated in front of the coffee shop panhandling again. I asked him about his job.

He said he was working with a couple of guys and had a sledgehammer and was asked to demolish a wall Inside a location. Somehow, he was positioned so that when the wall fell, it fell towards him instead of away from him. So now he had a workers compensation claim, where the government would pay him money while he was off work, and the employer that took a shot at helping out a panhandler is now paying Extra because an employee got injured on the job.

He was pretty happy about the situation and he was in no way injured that I could visibly see. I never spoke to him after that.

A couple years later I was working in an office that was close to a bar where a lot of panhandlers were when the welfare checks came out, we called it welfare Wednesday.

There was a guy I used to see downtown in the business district, a panhandler, barefoot and completely grubby as hell. He would stand there filthy, barefoot with his hand out, and I swear to God people were just throwing money at this guy all day. He always had a sport bag next to him.

One time I saw him get dropped off by a taxi, were he then went into an alley,  changed into the clothes he had in a sport bag, took his shoes off, rubbed his hands on the pavement of the alley and dirty up his face and feet. He then walked to his corner where he stood every day. I also saw him on welfare Wednesday when he had been paid, at that bar by my office, with brand new shoes and a cell phone.

At this point, I’m trying to see what I can post before Wednesday. Preparing myself for inevitable sad sad sadness. 😭😭😭😭

Context is important: it just hit me that Rewan is from Glasgow, which makes him a Scottish. So - I kid you not - I googled sexy Scottish accents and I found a video of a guy from Glasgow on Facebook. He was talking about a list some other guy posted on the world’s least Sexy accents and talked about how he didn’t get it, because he got a lot of tail and most of the women he dated admitted to doing it mostly because of the accent.

Apparently it’s commanding but comforting at the same time. You know, you’re a little afraid of him but you don’t really wanna leave either, type vibe. The guy in the video said his theory is that whoever made that list, probably had his girlfriend stolen by some Scottish guy from Glasgow and now he’s salty about it. My brain immediately went, to Rewan and this happened. Also, apparently Rewan is Celtic it means warrior, I just had to do another chapter.

Point is, in the last part I gave no thought to the particular accent that Rewan would possibly have, but in this part I did. It’s not too intensive, just a couple of things here and there. I’m also not super happy with this part, but I know that if I don’t post it now I never will

- - - - - - - - 




When Rewan got news that his application had been accepted and that he’d be going in as a contestant for Love Island; he was excited. The plan had always been to just try and enjoy his summer. Meet some girls, have a good time, maybe meet someone special. Maybe win the money at the end of the season. 

But if Rewan’s being honest, he never really expected to win Love Island. The idea of going on a television show and finding “the one” always seemed a little ludicrous for him. He was more interested in a having a new experience than actually finding “love”. 

But he signed up anyway, got on the show and then he was taken to the Sleep Over Villa. He was shown videos of the girls currently in the main villa and was told he had to pick two them. The girls he was most interested in getting to know.

Rewan picked Tori and Eva.

All the girls were stunning. But Tori and Eva were the only ones that managed to catch and hold his attention.

Tori seemed sweet, smart, ambitious. Seemed like she had a little bit more fire than the other girls and Rewan likes a woman who can keep him on his toes.

Choosing Eva, however, was a more complicated decision.

She’s a beautiful girl. Smart, confident, but there was something else about her. Something Rewan couldn’t really name. He just knew that he wanted to meet her. Something in his gut told him that he needed to see her.  So he picked her.

It was a shit show.

Tori was great, spunky. That ambition was on full display as she immediately put in the graft and did what she could to grab his attention and keep it. She did a great job too. Under normal circumstances Rewan wouldn’t have had a reason to even glance away from her. But focusing on Tori proved surprisingly difficult.

Eva was beautiful, smart, feisty. She didn’t fall for any of his lines, didn’t melt into a puddle at his smile and frankly, didn’t seem too impressed with anything that he did. It should’ve annoyed him. Should’ve had him avoiding the girl like the plague, but it didn’t. 

He liked her. 

Rewan liked that - whether she was aware of it or not - she made him work harder. He liked how she’d answer his flirting with sass, effortlessly counter every insult and - fuck - he realised, unfortunately quickly, how much he loved watching those beautiful eyes roll almost to the back of her head when he said something that annoyed her.

He fancied her and yet, for some reason, he hated himself for it. Something about Eva put him off balance and that made Rewan feel incredibly uncomfortable. 

He couldn’t be around her. So he focused on Tori. Turned on the charm and had the blonde blushing and giggling every two minutes while trying to ignore the little huffs of annoyance and glowering glares from Eva right beside them. He tried to ignore the pang of disappointment when Tori snuck out in the middle of the night to see him, while Eva stayed inside not even sparing him a glance. Rewan tried not to think about Tori’s perfume when they were kissing outside on the daybeds. That intense yet floral scent that wasn’t overpoweringly strong. But still had him thinking about the smell that he just barely caught on Eva’s skin when she let him kiss her hand. Vanilla, Amber, something deep and sultry that had him fighting against the urge to lean in just a bit closer.

But he’d decided to focus on Tori. Rewan wanted to have a fun summer and Eva… everything about Eva seemed needlessly complicated, nerve wrecking. For some reason the girl put him completely on edge. 

He realised that much when he was getting their coffee the next morning. Barely giving it much thought when he was preparing Tori’s cup but then over analysing his every move when he was fixing Eva’s cup and then - of course - he had to fucking trip on his way upstairs.

A brief moment of panic and a slight heart attack later, he realised how ridiculous he was being. And over a girl he didn’t even know, no less? 

His mates back home would slaughter him alive if they saw what he was doing. Rewan composed himself and marched back up the stairs. He made a simple mistake, he’s not slaving over another cup of coffee over a girl he doesn’t plan on pursuing anyway.

When he got upstairs however, his face flushed against his will when he handed Eva the half empty cup. It was all made so much worse, when she just stared at him with an arched brow before rolling those gorgeous eyes at him again.

That moment, right there, is when he knew he was doomed.

He tried to ignore her. Tried to focus on Tori and then when Mei was suddenly there and showing an interest in him, he tried to focus on Mei.

They… barely knew each other. She was a friend of a friend. They met at a party and hit it off. Spent a few weeks falling in and out of bed together but, even with all of that Mei never gave him the impression that they were anything more than that, or that she was interested in starting something more serious. So her sudden intense interest in him was confusing, but not unwelcome.

When they got back to the villa, Tori was suddenly pretending like nothing happened between the two of them. Like she didn’t spend most of the night, twirling her hair and batting her eyes at him. Like she didn’t sneak out in the middle of the night to share a late night kiss. Fortunately, Rewan wasn’t too upset about it, he just isn’t a fan of lying so he got over her quickly enough. 

The problem was and always seemed to be Eva. 

Even when he was doing his very best to ignore her, somehow his attention would always be drawn right back to the girl. It was like the universe was trying to punish him, by making the one girl he wanted to avoid the centre of the bloody universe.

It wasn’t even just Rewan either. Upon arriving at the villa, he became painfully aware of the weird love… triangle? Square? Pentagon - whatever the fuck, in the villa. 

It seemed to him that all the boys had a soft spot for Eva. It’s Tori that filled him in on the fact that Eva had originally said that she liked Darin the most out of the boys. With Gryff coming in second and Kami last. Things with Rosalie were awkward since Darin seemed to also have Eva as his first choice among the girls. And Keziah could never really get into it with Kami since he clearly had some sort of soft spot for Eva also. And then, when Nathan came in, he’d made it obvious that she was in fact his first choice as well.

Rewan truly was completely doomed.

The absolute worst though, was Mei. Mei, instead of distracting him from Eva, wouldn’t stop talking about her. The things she did, the things she’d say to the other girls. Eva’s outfits, the way she laughed and smiled when she was around Gryff. She’d say it jokingly, like whatever comment she made was intended as some sort of insult but it was always with a biting edge of annoyance. 

Rewan ended up learning a lot about Eva without actually ever speaking to Eva. And yet every time he spoke to Eva, it always ended with insults, glares and her rolling her eyes at him.

It drove Rewan crazy.

So the arguing continued, drama kept popping up and Rewan started getting into fights with Darin. Eva’s supposed first choice.

What did she even like about him? What made him her type on paper more than anyone else? Clearly whatever it was didn’t matter since she was suddenly superglued to Gryff’s side.

Those thoughts would fester and grow and it became so easy to fight with Darin.

While completely ignoring Kami.

He really shouldn’t have ignored Kami. If he paid a little more attention. If he’d listened to his gut when it told him that something was off about Mei’s behaviour-

A lot of things could’ve been avoided if he’d just trusted himself. 

Listened when his brain told him that Tori wasn’t going to stick around. Listened when his gut told him not to trust Mei. Listened to the little voice in the back of his head, that told him to just go back to the stupid kitchen and make that cup of coffee again. But he didn’t listen. Things went from bad to worse and then- 

And then there was the night in the secrets nook and suddenly all those complicated complications that had him avoiding Eva became decidedly less complicated. The uncomfortable, twisting labyrinth of  tangled emotions straightened themselves into one very clear conclusion that Rewan knows, he’s always known from the start.

He’s doomed.

He almost kissed her that night. Bloody hell, Rewan was ready to take her right there and then. The fact that Eva stopped things before they went too far didn’t make things better either. It just made them worse.

It reminded him of a conversation he had with his parents when he was young, one of the many times they found out about a girl he was dating, only to find out that he was no longer seeing her, but that he was now with someone completely new a few days later. 

Rewan’s father used to tell him to find someone like his mother, someone who made things interesting. Someone with the sort of fiery spark that would have him waking up excited for each new day. 

His mother had a different opinion.

*”That’s terrible advice.”

Rewan blinked, “But Dad said-“

“Poor man, he’s in love with me. He doesn’t know any better.” His mother said with a smirk from where she stood by the kitchen sink, wet plate and dish towel in hand as her raven curls swayed around her shoulders. “He can’t be held accountable for the things he says.”

Rewan scoffed, as she continued.

“Two dragons in the same kingdom might seem like a good idea at first, but it always ends in ashes.” She turned back face him, setting the plate down on the table in front of him before giving her son a sad smile. “You and I, we’re made of the same stuff. All fire and lightning, we fly to the highest skies and swim through the deepest seas. But if you’re not careful, you can still drown, fly too close to the sun. You could end up destroying everything around you, that’s why it’s important to have balance Rewan.”

“What you need to do, is find yourself a little dragon tamer. Someone who can crack a whip and tell you no.” She leaned in close and pressed a kiss into his hair, “You find yourself someone half your size, who with one look in their eyes; will have you on your knees and begging for a cage.”

Rewan frowned at her, “Dad doesn’t seem like he has you in a cage.”

“Well of course not, Rewan, he doesn’t know. And once you’ve found your little dragon tamer, you make sure she doesn’t know either. Keep her on her toes.” She laughed, “It’s nice to watch them work for it a little, every now and then.”*

As the years went by, he sort of forgot about that conversation. Life always moved fast and easy for Rewan. There was always something to do, people to see, places to go. His love life was no exception to that rule. When he did get in a relationship, it always went fast. Quickly together and quickly apart, the very few occasions when things got serious with the girls he dated, the endings would always be ugly.

As these girls came and went, his mother’s words never came back to him. They never even drifted into his mind. Not until he got to the Sleepover Villa and Eva rolled her eyes at him for the very first time.

And now…

The Heart Rate challenge.

Supposedly, the audience had a vote and that vote resulted in the game of Snog, Marry, Pie happening much sooner than it normally did in the season. That was surprising enough. What was more surprising was how the Heart Rate challenge followed quickly after that.

The texts didn’t do much to explain the reasons for these changes or why the audience was allowed to vote on its timing, but they were and now they’re here and Rewan is staring down at the end of walkway leading to the fire pit, waiting for the next girl to appear. Or rather, there was one girl in particular that he wanted to see. 

Though he did have an idea as to why they suddenly decided on these audience votes.

Sometimes it’s hard to remember that there are cameras everywhere in the villa. The fact that you’re never really alone in here. 

They must’ve been seen.

The other night, in the secrets nook. The Love Island producers, crew and audience. They all saw what happened and now they were trying to torture Rewan over it.

Shit.

And people call him the stirrer. 

For the moment however, Rewan didn’t let himself think about that.

At the end of the seat where the boys sat around the fire pit, he felt Gryff’s gaze. The way it’s been trailing after and staying on him for the last couple of days. Ever since they played snog, marry, pie.

Rewan is aware that everyone’s been whispering about him since they played the game. Staring and gossiping, wondering what was going through his head but never saying anything to him out loud. The cowards. Too bad he didn’t care enough to explain his thoughts or actions to them either.

A smirk played on his lips as the memory of the game came back to him. 

With the tension that still hung in the air among the couples, no one seemed too eager to start off the game. No one except for Gryff, of course.

Everything in Gryff’s world was going well, just spinning along as it should. He’s paired with Eva and even though there’s been some tension around them since he brought Niki back with him from the Sleepover Villa, he still seemed completely devoted to Eva and their couple.

He went up first. Kissed Niki, supposedly purely as a friendly welcome to the Villa. Gryff insisted that she seemed like a nice girl, that nothing was going on between them. She supposedly didn’t even really have an interest in him, which is why he chose her and not the other girl who was at the sleepover with them. 

Somehow, the idiot was completely oblivious to the way that Niki looked at him. The way she practically swooned every time he walked by. The way she’d stare across the table from him at breakfast. The way she glared at Eva whenever she saw them together.

Gryff had no idea. So he kissed Niki on the cheek, just giving the girl a smile when she complimented him on how soft his lips felt against her skin.

Rewan wanted to gag.

The next part was a shock to no one. He went down on one knee and asked Eva to marry him. Went on some spiel about her being the perfect girl, his dream girl, while the other islanders oohed and aahed. Tori stared at Nathan, clearly expecting him to not only attempt to one up Gryff, but pointedly not go anywhere near Eva once it was his turn as well.

Gryff finished off his sappy little speech, they all swooned. Rewan had to fight off the urge to gag again and Eva awkwardly cleared her throat before she said yes. Gryff beamed at her response. Rewan cringed on her behalf.

And then came the pie. Which came as a surprise to everyone including Rewan. He was sure he was going to get the pie to the face. As the resident villain, it seemed inevitable that they’d all decide that they had a problem with him and he’d be getting the majority of the cream filled crusts for the day. Surprisingly, Gryff didn’t even glance Rewan’s way. He went straight to Darin and threw a pie into his face. Why?

Because apparently Gryff still suspected Darin of pining after Eva. He was trying to send the message to the other man to finally leave her alone. 

That instantly started an argument between Darin and Rosalie. She demanded a reason for why Gryff would think he still had a thing for Eva when he kept promising her that he didn’t.

Seriously, how is he the shit stirrer, again? Because he points out everyone’s drama? Is that it? Rewan rolled his eyes at the thought.

Once they’d gotten Rosalie and Darin calm, at least for the moment, they decided to continue with the game. Which is when Rewan volunteered to go up next.

It seemed like the perfect opportunity, Gryff was so concerned about Darin trying to steal his girl, after all. Rewan decided to help put his mind at ease.

For the kiss, he chose Eva. Shocking everyone. They were sure he would kiss Mei or Tori. After all Mei was his partner and he had a little history with Tori. But just because Rewan and Eva kept quiet about the little discovery they made a few nights ago, doesn’t mean he’s suddenly forgotten.

Keeping quiet about Mei and Kami’s betrayal wasn’t something he wanted to do, more than he needed to. Rewan hates keeping secrets, he’s never been good at it. What people mistook for stirring was him getting ahead of the moment when he inevitably spills everything anyway. He never saw the point in keeping secrets, always confronted things head on.

But he couldn’t spill about this. Not if he wanted to stay on the island. Mei pointed out, very unhelpfully, that they needed each other. The couple dumping has been delayed but not cancelled. There’s too much up in the air, Rewan didn’t want to risk getting kicked off because of Mei. And so, for the time being, splitting up and spilling the beans wasn’t an option. But just cause he couldn’t talk about it doesn’t mean he was down to pretend like everything is peachy. Resulting in the other islanders noticing a rift in Rewan’s relationship with Mei. But with no clear reason for it. Honestly, the only hope they have left is Darin and Rosalie’s relationship seeming to be a bigger shit show than theirs was. At least as far as the other islanders knew.

But in that moment, Rewan decided that he could ignore their unfortunate circumstances. For the moment, he didn’t care what anyone thought and he wasn’t going to be told what to do either.

So when it was his turn, he’s made a beeline for Eva, barely giving the girl a chance to react before he practically tackled her to the ground and kissed her.

Gasps echoed around them, but he ignored them all. Eva was naturally shocked by the sudden act, but he felt his heart soar when she seemed to giggle against his mouth before she returned the kiss.

There were no pretences, there was no pause, no hesitation. He kissed her the way that he’s been dying to do for the last few weeks. Like he’s been dreaming about since that night when Mei broke his trust and he realised that he might actually have a shot at Eva. It was hungry, needy, desperate with desire. 

That night, if they hadn’t been interrupted, if she hadn’t asked him to stop…

Fuck.

Rewan doesn’t know what he would’ve done. It’s all so fucking stupid after all. Completely bloody moronic. All of that time wasted, all of the things he could have done and now - with the looming dumping - they might not any time left at all. 

Rewan felt something near primal ignite inside of him when he felt her legs wrap around his waist and he could feel the heat of her desire against him. He pushed her back against the grass and tilted her head to deepen the kiss, his tongue quickly slipping in between her lips before pulling her bottom lip in between his teeth and biting.

Biting hard. 

Eva let out a startled yelp, but didn’t break contact, not when they both tasted the metal tang of blood on their tongues and not when he felt her hands tangle in his hair and clench so tightly it hurt. Rewan’s control was crumbling into dust, giving into the urge to press down against her in a rough grind. One of his hands grabbing hold of her thigh to pull her in even closer against him. Causing a thrill of desire to wash over him as pleasured trembles danced along his spine. 

Eva was the one to bring him back to reality, strangled moan leaving her throat before she quickly pushed at his shoulders to urge him back. She only managed to push him back a few inches, panting hard as she stared back into his lust blown eyes.

“I’ve been waiting to do that for days.” He breathed quietly against her lips, fighting back against the urge to lean in and lick that single bead of blood that rose from the cut on her lip. The way it almost screamed it’s confirmation as a mark. A claim. Rewan felt the grin pulling across his own lips when he noticed that she was holding back a smile as she arched a brow at him.

“Satisfied?”

“No.” He answered without missing a breath and Eva flushed. When the moment broke-

“Ughm!” Mei loudly cleared her throat, “Can we move on now? Maybe stop wasting my partner’s time, Eva.”

Rewan’s jaw clenched in annoyance, he almost spilled the beans on the whole situation right then only for the girl beneath him to stop him short. Her hand clenching against his shoulder.

“Don’t.” She whispered and Rewan let out a hiss of annoyance as he pushed himself up, pulling her along with him so she was sitting up as he turned away.

Awful, horrible, deplorable pride filled his chest when she corrected herself. Setting her hair right and shaking it free from the blades of grass that stuck to it, before swiping at her lips to wipe away the saliva and blood. Their eyes locked for a split second and Rewan could tell she was hiding a smile as she continued to pretend to wipe her lips. In that moment he realised that she could ask him to do anything right there and then and he’d do it, without hesitation.

His little dragon tamer.

The rest of the islanders were staring in shock. Eyes going from Eva to Rewan and then to Gryff, before eventually landing on Mei. She was usually so vocal about their drama and misdeeds, it was strange that she was so quiet after watching Rewan snog Eva like he wanted to devour her. 

But Mei said nothing and Rewan didn’t seem interested in giving a reason for his actions either. He just turned back to the other islanders and looked around, his head tilted in thought before he spoke.

“Well, after that kiss, I think there’s really only one person I want to marry.” He said walking over towards Mei, who smiled as she tossed her head back to flick her hair over her shoulder.

He could feel Gryff’s glare on him as he made his way across the circle. See Kami’s eyes narrowing slightly at him as Rewan swaggered over to Mei. 

“I see a white wedding dress and a lace veil on a pure perfect little princess, who clearly thinks she’s better than everyone else.” Mei frowned at him, Rewan smirked just as he made to kneel in front of Mei only to suddenly get back up and do a one-eighty at the very last second, so he could suddenly kneel down in front of Eva instead.

The girl blinked at him, staring in shock while Rewan just grinned at her. 

“What do you say? Will you make an honest man out of me?”

Silence fell over around themand yet, Eva couldn’t help but smile as she spoke.

“I can’t perform miracles.”

“How about an exorcism? Purge my sinful mind and soul of all those dark, dirty, depraved-“

“And how would I do that?”

His eyes gleamed with mischief, “The lips of saints can cleanse the souls of sinners.”

She paused for a second in thought before giving a snort as she stared at him incredulously, “Shakespeare? Really?” Her head gave a tilt before she leaned in and played along. “What if I don’t want to carry your sins on my lips?”

His eyes darted down to the fresh mark on her mouth. “A little late for that.” She forced back a scoff while he shrugged, “There are other things you could try. Pagan rituals, virgin sacrifice-“

“Virgin sacrifice?”

“I could make you feel things you never felt before. But we’d need to be married first. Can’t give away the milk for free, Las.” Rewan teased, “I need to preserve my honour-“

“Oh my God, if I say yes will you stop?”

Rewan grinned, “No.”

Eva was failing at fighting off a smile as she held her left hand out to him. 

“Yes.”

“Yes?”

She shrugged, “Maybe I just want to see if you actually look decent in a tux.” 

Rewan smirked as he took her hand, maintaining eye contact as he pressed a kiss on her knuckles.

“Just make sure that white dress is easy to take off, Princess.”

Eva finally broke with a laugh and Rewan was grinning like a cat that stole the cream as he got up and turned to the stunned islanders. 

“Wait,” Tori started, a deep frown marring her features as her eyes went from Eva and then back to Rewan, “Is something going on between you two? Why-“

Before she could finish her question however, Rewan cut her off as he casually strolled over to the table filled with cream pies.

“Now, I think there are plenty of you who deserve the pie but…” he grabbed the pastry and spun around to quickly throw it right at an unsuspecting Kami. 

Kami let out a shout of surprise. Rosalie, who was sitting beside Kami, let out a squeal of disgust when some of the cream landed on her shoulder and she quickly shook it off.

“Rewan! What the hell?!”

Rewan ignored her, staring down darkly at Kami as the foil lining of the pie dropped from his face and glared back at the raven haired man.

“The nice guy act won’t last forever.” Rewan said before returning to his seat.

The other islanders were all stunned.

Keziah frowned as she turned to her partner, “What’s he talking about Kami?”

Kami’s jaw clenched before he forced himself to speak, still wiping the whipped cream and crust from his face. “Who knows with Rewan? He’s always starting trouble.”

Keziah’s frown deepened as she looked back over the group, eyebrows furrowing when she found Eva glaring at Kami as well.

I have a 1-year-and-3-month-old mix breed dog. She shivers a lot once we step out of the ""territory"" which is in front of our apartment. There are no visible borders in that territory, but it is just an area of grass where she feels safe and confident, and once she realizes that I am stepping out of the zone and going further in the area to walk her, she is so hesitant and starts shaking. She shakes even more terribly with tucked-in tail when we are anywhere outdoors and not in a park. She always wanna drag me to indoor areas like coffee shops, stores, and so on, and she also feels safe in any park. But near roads, it is so visible that she has no confidence. She even gets diarrhea during those public walks.

I tried a lot since her puppyhood (I adopted her when she was 8 weeks old), I socialized her at a very young age, brought her near cars, near kids, men, women, but I don't really understand why she is not confident. By the way, it is necessary to mention - she listens my commands anywhere in public, doesn't take treats, but she would take chicken (never tried) despite her unconfidence.

Do some dogs just have unfixable fear and anxiety? Should I try meds for her? What is your experience with this?

1m5uxjw,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1m5uxjw/daytrip/,Daytrip,"When I was 6, I was trapped in my family's cellar. I was convinced the dusty, dank dungeon had a hidden treasure that was waiting to be uncovered. Armed with a shovel and treasure map that I drew, I braved the darkness. After shuffling around for a couple of minutes, my imagination scared me by convincing me the shadows I saw were monsters. I swung the shovel wildly, knocking down a storage wrack of beans and corn. I was pinned beneath the metal frame, crying out for help. In my desperate screams, I managed to lure a spider to my location. The arachnid gingerly crawled onto my face, as if I was just another inconvenience blocking its path. Its eight eyes stared into mine. Tears poured from my eyes. I begged for it to leave me alone. Then, the opening of the cellar door bathed me in sunlight. The spider scurried off of my face. My father, equipped with a dour look, hoisted the metal frame off of me. I sobbed into his shoulder as he patted my back. From that day forward I was tormented by neighborhood kids with a song set to the tune of Ring Around the Rosies:

Stuck inside a cellar,
With an eight eyed feller. 
Hungry,
Hungry,
It’s teeth bite down.

For what it’s worth, it was clever. However, it got old quickly. Winning in a game of basketball? The spider bite must’ve made me better. Got scared by a movie? Hey, at least it wasn’t a spider. I had nightmares, and became agoraphobic. We moved from Oklahoma to Oregon. The fresh air, and new environment, allowed me to shed my old self. I made a friend named Quincy, who quickly gave me a nickname. I was no longer “Spider-Man,” or “Eight Legged Freak,” but instead I was known as “Swamp Thing.” With my name being Marshall, shortened to Marsh by my parents, it didn’t take a genius to come up with “Swamp Thing.” Quincy and I were inseparable. We talked comics, games, and Power Rangers. He was my best friend. We had countless sleep overs, and just as many ghost hunts. Our friendship lasted from third grade to our junior year of high school. 

The last day I spoke to Quincy in high school was a rough one. While we had smoked weed pretty regularly, and even played basketball games while stoned, Quincy wanted something stronger. He started taking acid and LSD. Whether he was dipping joints in it, or just tossing it back, he was constantly on a bender. I pleaded with him to quit. I even tried taking him to a cabin to kick it cold turkey. Nothing ever took. The distrust and anger he had in his eyes when he discovered that I had told his dad is a look I’ll never forget. If looks could kill it would have skinned me alive. At 17 years old he was taken to rehab. We lost all communication. Sure, I felt guilty, but what would anyone have done in that situation? I did what I could. 

My senior year of high school was uneventful. We won state in basketball, I got accepted to a college with a decent film program, and I even managed to score a date for prom. Graduation came and went. That summer was a blur, filled with nothing but stony viewings of 80’s B-horror movies. I made my college basketball team as a walk-on and played a total of 47 seconds in a blow out loss. My roommate was cool enough. He was mostly quiet but could manage to crack a joke here and there. But for the most part, I was lonely. I missed my parents, but mostly I just missed Quincy. We were friends for nearly ten years. I was never good at making friends. It was Quincy who befriended me. 

I was nearly a complete agoraphobe by the time fall break came. I was suffering from panic attacks and nightmares nearly every night. I was missing class more and more. Going from straight A’s to C’s wasn’t ideal, but I convinced myself that a trip home over break would reset my brain. The fresh forest air would fill my lungs once more. Now all I had to do was figure out how to bottle it. Begging my parents for a plane trip home was an uphill battle. To put it plainly, we were broke. My dad relied on the government, having destroyed his knee several years ago, and my mom was a manager at a Target. However, they managed to pull some strings and get me a red eye. My roommate drove me to the airport, and was persuaded to get some donuts from a local 24-hour place. They were as stale as our conversation, but at least the coffee also sucked. Most of my belongings could be stuffed into a duffle bag, but my backpack almost worked as well. As much as I’d love to bring all of my clothes home to wash, I didn’t have the money to check a bag. 

When I landed back in Oregon I could instantly feel relief. The all too familiar airport that smelled of cigarettes felt like home already. As I made my way to the airport restroom I called my mom. “Hey sweetie! How was your flight?”
“Eh. It was okay. Can’t complain much.”
“That makes me so happy.”
“Mom, are you in the car? It doesn’t sound like you are.”
“You didn’t get my text?” 
I check my inbox and see two text messages. One from my mom, and one from a number I don’t recognize. She had texted me “sorry, won’t be picking you up. someone special is though.” I angrily spoke back into my phone. “Mom? What the hell?”
“Marshmallow, you’re going to love who picks you up. I promise.”
“Dammit. Okay. Will you at least have breakfast ready?”
“You know I will.” I hang up and immediately take some aspirin from my bag. I chew it as I rub my temples. Stress, anxiety, and panic all start to settle in. No. I can’t let it. I’m home, and apparently someone special is here to take me home. It’s going to be okay. 

“Read the sign asshole! I’m well within my right to be here!” I hear a voice yell from the pick up area. A security guard is arguing with someone in a landscaping truck. “Sir, you don’t even have to leave, you just can’t be parked here.”
“How about I park my foot up your ass?” I can tell by the colorful language that the man in the landscaping truck is my ride. It’s Quincy. I quickly toss my bag in the bed of the truck and hop in. “So sorry officer, I got off of the plane late.”
“Marsh, don’t apologize to this bitch, he’s not even a real cop. Probably didn’t trust him to not shoot his dick off.” He peels out of the arrival area, flipping the bird as he does. 

The first few minutes are quiet. The tension is so thick you could chew it. We both go to talk first but neither can muster the courage to. Quincy is the first to break the silence. “So…I heard you made it to ASU? How’s that?” 
“What? Oh, yeah. I mean…it’s cool. Not what I was expecting.”
“Cool, man. Any cool classes?”
“Yeah. Um…I really like my Rock Music & Culture class.”
“Sweet.”
After ten agonizing minutes, we’re back to being best friends. We had a ton to catch up on. As nice as that was, however, nothing we talked about had any substance. It was the same regurgitated opinions we had since high school. We were both afraid to bring up the elephant in the room, afraid of anything real. 

By the time our argument of “Who would win in a fight between Green Lantern and Aquaman,” had ended, Quincy was parking at a national park nearby my parents house. I turned to him as if to say “what the fuck?” but he was already talking. “Look man. I just need a day with my best friend.” His eyes were already tearing up. “I know I fucked up. I should have texted you, I should have called you. But I was angry. I hated you. To me, you ruined my life. You got me sent to rehab. My dad can still hardly look at me. And I blamed you for the longest time. But while I was in rehab I learned about accountability. You never made me take acid or LSD. I did that shit on my own. And it stopped my life for three years. That’s time I don’t get back. But I can try. So please, Marsh, just give me one day with my best friend again.” I was skeptical. This was real. He didn’t just address the elephant in the room, he gunned it down. “Wow Q. That was super…gay.” He chuckles and flips me off. This is the least I can do for him. 

We hiked for a good 15 minutes before we made it to a spot we used to go when we ditched class to get high. I felt 15 again. Quincy was digging through the log we used to stash weed in and pulled out two ziploc bags. Two joints in each. I was practically drooling. Since starting college I have stayed pretty clean. I never drank, and was too dorky to even approach someone about buying. Not that I would even have the money to buy weed. “Indica or sativa?” asked Quincy. I was already prying a bag open before he got the question out. He laughed as he handed me a lighter. Some things never change. Within minutes we were debating the morality of the death sentence with all the grace of a hippo on ice skates. “Yo, wait. Did your ziploc have anything written on it?”
“Yeah, it says Daytrip.”
“Okay, fuck. I fucked up.”
“Why?”
“Don’t freak out. Those were dipped in acid.” My blood immediately begins to boil. “I thought you were clean! What the fuck are you thinking?” 
“I forgot to throw them out. Don’t be a dick!”

I started hyperventilating. I could feel my throat closing up and my skin burning. I could feel tears welling up in my eyes. I attempted to stand up, but I felt the moss reach up and pull me back down. As Quincy mumbled to himself about set and setting, I started picking at the moss trying to free myself. Whether it was intentional or not, he drugged me. I decided to let him know my feelings. “Do you ever spend more than five seconds thinking about what you’re going to do next? Or are you just cool with casually fucking someone up because you can’t spend more than a minute with your own thoughts?” He didn’t look at me. He wouldn’t. So I kept at it. “You’ve always been like this. No one can be better than you. No one can have it better than you. Is that why you asked if you could pick me up? So you could fuck me over?”
“Your mom asked me to pick you up because she knows you’re depressed.” He still wasn’t facing me. “Yeah, I’m jealous of you, but I wouldn’t do anything to hurt you. We were best friends.” He was right, and that just made me angrier. I got in his face so I could really get my point across. “You’re a fuck-up. You’re going to die in the town you were born in because you are a dime a dozen burn out. I’d laugh if it wasn’t so fucking sad.” He shoves me. I’m much bigger than Quincy. Taller, and heavier. I don’t move. He does. And the momentum sends him tripping over the log. 

CRACK

“Q?” No response. “Come on man, quit playing. I’m sorry.” His legs laid over the log, his upper body just out of sight. I carefully approach, afraid to disturb the stillness of it all. Quincy’s pale green eyes stare up into nothingness, blood pooling under his head. A jagged rock protruding from the ground managed to lodge its way between his skull and spine, a single tear rolling down his cheek. The more I look at the injury the worse it gets. Gray matter evacuates his skull, and bits of flesh are ripped away. I cradle him in any way I can without disturbing his body. I weep over him, begging God and the Devil to make a deal to give me my friend back. I run out of the forest hoping to get cell service. I managed to find a signal in the parking lot. Before they can even ask what my emergency is I am already spewing whatever information I can. “My friend fell and I think he may be dead. I’m at Roger’s Landing. Please hurry. Fuck, I almost forgot we’re about a mile deep.” I sprint back, ignoring the burning in my lungs. 

“Please god, Quincy wake up!” I scream. I know he’s dead. Begging will achieve nothing. “Stuck inside a cellar.” I turn around so fast I nearly fall over. “Q?” He’s…smiling? “With an eight eyed feller.” My heart drops through my whole body. How does he know this? “Q, you’re scaring me.”
“Huuuuuuuuuuuungrrrrrrrrrrrrry.”
“Fucking knock it off!”
“Hungry.”
“LEAVE ME ALONE!”
“I bite down.” Quincy’s body begins to convulse violently. Blood and foam form an unholy union as it escapes his mouth. His neck begins to elongate, and the flesh tears. His head detaches from his body, giving me a clear view into his skull. Inside his skull, eight eyes stare back at me. Very gingerly, eight legs begin to poke outside. A spider roughly the size of a baking sheet evacuates my friend's neck stump, wearing his head on its abdomen. “Fuck.” The words barely escape my mouth before I’m sprinting through the woods. 

Branches rip and tear through my clothes. The cold air stings my lungs to the point that it hurts to breathe. My legs start to give out. I fall to my knees and vomit the donuts I had eaten earlier. Tears rush from my ducts as I double over in pain. I cry, loud and in pain. Before I can feel too sorry for myself, I gather myself. Weeping won’t change my situation. I’m in Roger’s Landing, maybe 3 miles from cell service. My body hurts, my friend killed himself, and a spider hatched inside of his body. The forest is a big place. If I make my way back it likely won’t find me. I snap a branch off of a nearby tree and take a few practice swings. It won’t help me but it will make me believe I stand a chance. After a quick pep talk, I start to walk back. If only I had seen the bear trap, and if only I remembered I was also on acid. 

Hot blood rushes into the snapped bone. My screams turn into coughs. I attempt to use the branch to pry the bear trap open. It snaps, and the teeth bite back down on my already ruined ankle. I fade in and out of consciousness for several minutes, if not hours. I open my eyes, and I’m once again at prom. Val and I are dancing. Quincy is pounding on the window outside of the dance. When I look back at Val she is ripping her face off yelling “THIS IS YOUR FAULT.” I’m a child again, eating dinner with my family. Suddenly the spaghetti I’m eating starts to get stuck in my throat. I look down at my plate and realize I’m eating hair. Not just any hair, but my hair. I feel my head and I’m bald. I start coughing. I’m in my car. It’s on fire. Firefighters are ignoring my pleas for help. They laugh as my skin melts and my bones crumble into ash. My mother hands me an urn. “Your father’s in there. He wouldn’t want you to blame yourself for what happened.” As she walks away I try to grab her arm, but it turns into spiders. I run away, and fall down a flight of stairs. I crash into a storage rack, and it pins me down. I frantically look around for help. I look up and Quincy is standing over me. He opens his mouth so wide his jaw unhinges. Spider legs sprout from his throat and pull me in. 

I’m awake again. The sun is setting, and my sweat is chilling. My mouth is so dry that I choke when I try to breathe. I roll to my stomach, and manage to slip my backpack off. The airport water, that cost way more than it should have, has just enough water to fill my mouth once. It’s not much but it’s enough. I check my phone for a signal, and I’m lucky enough to see I have one bar. I text my mom “I love you. I’m sorry.” By the rustling of leaves I know I’m not alone. I roll back over and sure enough, stalking me through the branches, are eight red eyes. It doesn’t run. It doesn’t leap. It walks to me, and from what I can see it has gotten bigger. Whatever happens next, I’m not dying without a fight. 

I swing at the spider, and my fists have little to no effect. It turns around and Quincy is staring at me. His jaw falls off as he begins to speak. “This is your fault. Your words…your actions…you’re a monster. It’s why you’re alone. It’s why you’re afraid. You’re a cornered animal. It’s a shame you have to die out here alone.” Millions of tiny spiders clump from his nose, mouth, and ears. I frantically swat them off, but there’s too many. Thousands of dagger-like teeth bite down into my flesh. I can feel my muscles stiffen. With one last ditch effort, I reach for the front of the spider, clutching one of its fangs. I rip the beast's tooth from its maw, and stab it into its abdomen. If I die, I’ll take it to hell with me. I stab until I can’t tell the difference between our blood. I stab until my adrenaline wears off. I stab until I can’t. 

The first thing I can see is a shadow. It’s my mom. I can’t tell by the blur standing in front of me, just by her voice. Shapes begin to have detail, words start to have meaning. “How long will that take?”
“Honestly, Mrs. Booths, that’s up to him. A lot of people take a few weeks. Some never do again,” replied the doctor. I’m in a hospital. My head is pounding and my ankle is throbbing in pain. I fight the feeling but I fall back asleep. 

It’s been years since the incident. The paramedics found him first, head still attached. Quincy had died instantly. I was found nine miles away from him, covered in my own piss and vomit. My left leg resembled a sausage that got caught in a paper shredder. It had to be amputated due to infection, but I relearned how to walk. Verne Bennet, Q’s father, visited me several times in the hospital. He became a father figure after my own dads death. I had zoned out while driving and his seat belt wasn’t on. That accident was the reason why my doctors found my cancer. It’s not bad being bald, but when you’re also missing half a leg you can’t help but question god. I’m the same age that my father was when he passed. After all this time there’s only one thing that bothers me: why did the doctor tell me there was no acid in my system?

1m5uw8z,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_HotChiliColdChilly/comments/1m5uw8z/daytrip/,Daytrip,"When I was 6, I was trapped in my family's cellar. I was convinced the dusty, dank dungeon had a hidden treasure that was waiting to be uncovered. Armed with a shovel and treasure map that I drew, I braved the darkness. After shuffling around for a couple of minutes, my imagination scared me by convincing me the shadows I saw were monsters. I swung the shovel wildly, knocking down a storage wrack of beans and corn. I was pinned beneath the metal frame, crying out for help. In my desperate screams, I managed to lure a spider to my location. The arachnid gingerly crawled onto my face, as if I was just another inconvenience blocking its path. Its eight eyes stared into mine. Tears poured from my eyes. I begged for it to leave me alone. Then, the opening of the cellar door bathed me in sunlight. The spider scurried off of my face. My father, equipped with a dour look, hoisted the metal frame off of me. I sobbed into his shoulder as he patted my back. From that day forward I was tormented by neighborhood kids with a song set to the tune of Ring Around the Rosies:

Stuck inside a cellar,
With an eight eyed feller. 
Hungry,
Hungry,
It’s teeth bite down.

For what it’s worth, it was clever. However, it got old quickly. Winning in a game of basketball? The spider bite must’ve made me better. Got scared by a movie? Hey, at least it wasn’t a spider. I had nightmares, and became agoraphobic. We moved from Oklahoma to Oregon. The fresh air, and new environment, allowed me to shed my old self. I made a friend named Quincy, who quickly gave me a nickname. I was no longer “Spider-Man,” or “Eight Legged Freak,” but instead I was known as “Swamp Thing.” With my name being Marshall, shortened to Marsh by my parents, it didn’t take a genius to come up with “Swamp Thing.” Quincy and I were inseparable. We talked comics, games, and Power Rangers. He was my best friend. We had countless sleep overs, and just as many ghost hunts. Our friendship lasted from third grade to our junior year of high school. 

The last day I spoke to Quincy in high school was a rough one. While we had smoked weed pretty regularly, and even played basketball games while stoned, Quincy wanted something stronger. He started taking acid and LSD. Whether he was dipping joints in it, or just tossing it back, he was constantly on a bender. I pleaded with him to quit. I even tried taking him to a cabin to kick it cold turkey. Nothing ever took. The distrust and anger he had in his eyes when he discovered that I had told his dad is a look I’ll never forget. If looks could kill it would have skinned me alive. At 17 years old he was taken to rehab. We lost all communication. Sure, I felt guilty, but what would anyone have done in that situation? I did what I could. 

My senior year of high school was uneventful. We won state in basketball, I got accepted to a college with a decent film program, and I even managed to score a date for prom. Graduation came and went. That summer was a blur, filled with nothing but stony viewings of 80’s B-horror movies. I made my college basketball team as a walk-on and played a total of 47 seconds in a blow out loss. My roommate was cool enough. He was mostly quiet but could manage to crack a joke here and there. But for the most part, I was lonely. I missed my parents, but mostly I just missed Quincy. We were friends for nearly ten years. I was never good at making friends. It was Quincy who befriended me. 

I was nearly a complete agoraphobe by the time fall break came. I was suffering from panic attacks and nightmares nearly every night. I was missing class more and more. Going from straight A’s to C’s wasn’t ideal, but I convinced myself that a trip home over break would reset my brain. The fresh forest air would fill my lungs once more. Now all I had to do was figure out how to bottle it. Begging my parents for a plane trip home was an uphill battle. To put it plainly, we were broke. My dad relied on the government, having destroyed his knee several years ago, and my mom was a manager at a Target. However, they managed to pull some strings and get me a red eye. My roommate drove me to the airport, and was persuaded to get some donuts from a local 24-hour place. They were as stale as our conversation, but at least the coffee also sucked. Most of my belongings could be stuffed into a duffle bag, but my backpack almost worked as well. As much as I’d love to bring all of my clothes home to wash, I didn’t have the money to check a bag. 

When I landed back in Oregon I could instantly feel relief. The all too familiar airport that smelled of cigarettes felt like home already. As I made my way to the airport restroom I called my mom. “Hey sweetie! How was your flight?”
“Eh. It was okay. Can’t complain much.”
“That makes me so happy.”
“Mom, are you in the car? It doesn’t sound like you are.”
“You didn’t get my text?” 
I check my inbox and see two text messages. One from my mom, and one from a number I don’t recognize. She had texted me “sorry, won’t be picking you up. someone special is though.” I angrily spoke back into my phone. “Mom? What the hell?”
“Marshmallow, you’re going to love who picks you up. I promise.”
“Dammit. Okay. Will you at least have breakfast ready?”
“You know I will.” I hang up and immediately take some aspirin from my bag. I chew it as I rub my temples. Stress, anxiety, and panic all start to settle in. No. I can’t let it. I’m home, and apparently someone special is here to take me home. It’s going to be okay. 

“Read the sign asshole! I’m well within my right to be here!” I hear a voice yell from the pick up area. A security guard is arguing with someone in a landscaping truck. “Sir, you don’t even have to leave, you just can’t be parked here.”
“How about I park my foot up your ass?” I can tell by the colorful language that the man in the landscaping truck is my ride. It’s Quincy. I quickly toss my bag in the bed of the truck and hop in. “So sorry officer, I got off of the plane late.”
“Marsh, don’t apologize to this bitch, he’s not even a real cop. Probably didn’t trust him to not shoot his dick off.” He peels out of the arrival area, flipping the bird as he does. 

The first few minutes are quiet. The tension is so thick you could chew it. We both go to talk first but neither can muster the courage to. Quincy is the first to break the silence. “So…I heard you made it to ASU? How’s that?” 
“What? Oh, yeah. I mean…it’s cool. Not what I was expecting.”
“Cool, man. Any cool classes?”
“Yeah. Um…I really like my Rock Music & Culture class.”
“Sweet.”
After ten agonizing minutes, we’re back to being best friends. We had a ton to catch up on. As nice as that was, however, nothing we talked about had any substance. It was the same regurgitated opinions we had since high school. We were both afraid to bring up the elephant in the room, afraid of anything real. 

By the time our argument of “Who would win in a fight between Green Lantern and Aquaman,” had ended, Quincy was parking at a national park nearby my parents house. I turned to him as if to say “what the fuck?” but he was already talking. “Look man. I just need a day with my best friend.” His eyes were already tearing up. “I know I fucked up. I should have texted you, I should have called you. But I was angry. I hated you. To me, you ruined my life. You got me sent to rehab. My dad can still hardly look at me. And I blamed you for the longest time. But while I was in rehab I learned about accountability. You never made me take acid or LSD. I did that shit on my own. And it stopped my life for three years. That’s time I don’t get back. But I can try. So please, Marsh, just give me one day with my best friend again.” I was skeptical. This was real. He didn’t just address the elephant in the room, he gunned it down. “Wow Q. That was super…gay.” He chuckles and flips me off. This is the least I can do for him. 

We hiked for a good 15 minutes before we made it to a spot we used to go when we ditched class to get high. I felt 15 again. Quincy was digging through the log we used to stash weed in and pulled out two ziploc bags. Two joints in each. I was practically drooling. Since starting college I have stayed pretty clean. I never drank, and was too dorky to even approach someone about buying. Not that I would even have the money to buy weed. “Indica or sativa?” asked Quincy. I was already prying a bag open before he got the question out. He laughed as he handed me a lighter. Some things never change. Within minutes we were debating the morality of the death sentence with all the grace of a hippo on ice skates. “Yo, wait. Did your ziploc have anything written on it?”
“Yeah, it says Daytrip.”
“Okay, fuck. I fucked up.”
“Why?”
“Don’t freak out. Those were dipped in acid.” My blood immediately begins to boil. “I thought you were clean! What the fuck are you thinking?” 
“I forgot to throw them out. Don’t be a dick!”

I started hyperventilating. I could feel my throat closing up and my skin burning. I could feel tears welling up in my eyes. I attempted to stand up, but I felt the moss reach up and pull me back down. As Quincy mumbled to himself about set and setting, I started picking at the moss trying to free myself. Whether it was intentional or not, he drugged me. I decided to let him know my feelings. “Do you ever spend more than five seconds thinking about what you’re going to do next? Or are you just cool with casually fucking someone up because you can’t spend more than a minute with your own thoughts?” He didn’t look at me. He wouldn’t. So I kept at it. “You’ve always been like this. No one can be better than you. No one can have it better than you. Is that why you asked if you could pick me up? So you could fuck me over?”
“Your mom asked me to pick you up because she knows you’re depressed.” He still wasn’t facing me. “Yeah, I’m jealous of you, but I wouldn’t do anything to hurt you. We were best friends.” He was right, and that just made me angrier. I got in his face so I could really get my point across. “You’re a fuck-up. You’re going to die in the town you were born in because you are a dime a dozen burn out. I’d laugh if it wasn’t so fucking sad.” He shoves me. I’m much bigger than Quincy. Taller, and heavier. I don’t move. He does. And the momentum sends him tripping over the log. 

CRACK

“Q?” No response. “Come on man, quit playing. I’m sorry.” His legs laid over the log, his upper body just out of sight. I carefully approach, afraid to disturb the stillness of it all. Quincy’s pale green eyes stare up into nothingness, blood pooling under his head. A jagged rock protruding from the ground managed to lodge its way between his skull and spine, a single tear rolling down his cheek. The more I look at the injury the worse it gets. Gray matter evacuates his skull, and bits of flesh are ripped away. I cradle him in any way I can without disturbing his body. I weep over him, begging God and the Devil to make a deal to give me my friend back. I run out of the forest hoping to get cell service. I managed to find a signal in the parking lot. Before they can even ask what my emergency is I am already spewing whatever information I can. “My friend fell and I think he may be dead. I’m at Roger’s Landing. Please hurry. Fuck, I almost forgot we’re about a mile deep.” I sprint back, ignoring the burning in my lungs. 

“Please god, Quincy wake up!” I scream. I know he’s dead. Begging will achieve nothing. “Stuck inside a cellar.” I turn around so fast I nearly fall over. “Q?” He’s…smiling? “With an eight eyed feller.” My heart drops through my whole body. How does he know this? “Q, you’re scaring me.”
“Huuuuuuuuuuuungrrrrrrrrrrrrry.”
“Fucking knock it off!”
“Hungry.”
“LEAVE ME ALONE!”
“I bite down.” Quincy’s body begins to convulse violently. Blood and foam form an unholy union as it escapes his mouth. His neck begins to elongate, and the flesh tears. His head detaches from his body, giving me a clear view into his skull. Inside his skull, eight eyes stare back at me. Very gingerly, eight legs begin to poke outside. A spider roughly the size of a baking sheet evacuates my friend's neck stump, wearing his head on its abdomen. “Fuck.” The words barely escape my mouth before I’m sprinting through the woods. 

Branches rip and tear through my clothes. The cold air stings my lungs to the point that it hurts to breathe. My legs start to give out. I fall to my knees and vomit the donuts I had eaten earlier. Tears rush from my ducts as I double over in pain. I cry, loud and in pain. Before I can feel too sorry for myself, I gather myself. Weeping won’t change my situation. I’m in Roger’s Landing, maybe 3 miles from cell service. My body hurts, my friend killed himself, and a spider hatched inside of his body. The forest is a big place. If I make my way back it likely won’t find me. I snap a branch off of a nearby tree and take a few practice swings. It won’t help me but it will make me believe I stand a chance. After a quick pep talk, I start to walk back. If only I had seen the bear trap, and if only I remembered I was also on acid. 

Hot blood rushes into the snapped bone. My screams turn into coughs. I attempt to use the branch to pry the bear trap open. It snaps, and the teeth bite back down on my already ruined ankle. I fade in and out of consciousness for several minutes, if not hours. I open my eyes, and I’m once again at prom. Val and I are dancing. Quincy is pounding on the window outside of the dance. When I look back at Val she is ripping her face off yelling “THIS IS YOUR FAULT.” I’m a child again, eating dinner with my family. Suddenly the spaghetti I’m eating starts to get stuck in my throat. I look down at my plate and realize I’m eating hair. Not just any hair, but my hair. I feel my head and I’m bald. I start coughing. I’m in my car. It’s on fire. Firefighters are ignoring my pleas for help. They laugh as my skin melts and my bones crumble into ash. My mother hands me an urn. “Your father’s in there. He wouldn’t want you to blame yourself for what happened.” As she walks away I try to grab her arm, but it turns into spiders. I run away, and fall down a flight of stairs. I crash into a storage rack, and it pins me down. I frantically look around for help. I look up and Quincy is standing over me. He opens his mouth so wide his jaw unhinges. Spider legs sprout from his throat and pull me in. 

I’m awake again. The sun is setting, and my sweat is chilling. My mouth is so dry that I choke when I try to breathe. I roll to my stomach, and manage to slip my backpack off. The airport water, that cost way more than it should have, has just enough water to fill my mouth once. It’s not much but it’s enough. I check my phone for a signal, and I’m lucky enough to see I have one bar. I text my mom “I love you. I’m sorry.” By the rustling of leaves I know I’m not alone. I roll back over and sure enough, stalking me through the branches, are eight red eyes. It doesn’t run. It doesn’t leap. It walks to me, and from what I can see it has gotten bigger. Whatever happens next, I’m not dying without a fight. 

I swing at the spider, and my fists have little to no effect. It turns around and Quincy is staring at me. His jaw falls off as he begins to speak. “This is your fault. Your words…your actions…you’re a monster. It’s why you’re alone. It’s why you’re afraid. You’re a cornered animal. It’s a shame you have to die out here alone.” Millions of tiny spiders clump from his nose, mouth, and ears. I frantically swat them off, but there’s too many. Thousands of dagger-like teeth bite down into my flesh. I can feel my muscles stiffen. With one last ditch effort, I reach for the front of the spider, clutching one of its fangs. I rip the beast's tooth from its maw, and stab it into its abdomen. If I die, I’ll take it to hell with me. I stab until I can’t tell the difference between our blood. I stab until my adrenaline wears off. I stab until I can’t. 

The first thing I can see is a shadow. It’s my mom. I can’t tell by the blur standing in front of me, just by her voice. Shapes begin to have detail, words start to have meaning. “How long will that take?”
“Honestly, Mrs. Booths, that’s up to him. A lot of people take a few weeks. Some never do again,” replied the doctor. I’m in a hospital. My head is pounding and my ankle is throbbing in pain. I fight the feeling but I fall back asleep. 

It’s been years since the incident. The paramedics found him first, head still attached. Quincy had died instantly. I was found nine miles away from him, covered in my own piss and vomit. My left leg resembled a sausage that got caught in a paper shredder. It had to be amputated due to infection, but I relearned how to walk. Verne Bennet, Q’s father, visited me several times in the hospital. He became a father figure after my own dads death. I had zoned out while driving and his seat belt wasn’t on. That accident was the reason why my doctors found my cancer. It’s not bad being bald, but when you’re also missing half a leg you can’t help but question god. I’m the same age that my father was when he passed. After all this time there’s only one thing that bothers me: why did the doctor tell me there was no acid in my system?

1m5uv0g,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrumpTariffNews/comments/1m5uv0g/brazil_acknowledges_possibility_of_no_us_trade/,Brazil acknowledges possibility of no US trade deal by August 1,"SAO PAULO, July 21 (Reuters) - Brazil's finance minister said on Monday his country would not give up negotiating with the U.S. but acknowledged that a trade deal may fail to be reached by August 1, when President Donald Trump's 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods are due to take effect.

""That could happen,"" Fernando Haddad told radio station CBN in an interview, saying Latin America's largest economy was still awaiting a response from Washington on trade proposals initially submitted in May.

Trump announced the steep tariffs earlier this month, citing what he called a ""witch hunt"" against former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, who is on trial on charges of plotting a coup, and trade practices he said were unfair.

Haddad said Brazil had contingency plans to deal with any potential tariffs, and could ultimately redirect more than half its current U.S. exports to other markets.

""But that would take time,"" he cautioned.

The U.S. is a large buyer of Brazil's oil, steel products, coffee, aircraft and orange juice, but runs a trade surplus with the South American country - a point Brazilian officials have used to label the threatened tariffs as unjustified.

Companies such as planemaker Embraer, which has the U.S. as its main market, would be hard hit by Trump's move.

Haddad said the Brazilian government may need to support the sectors most affected by tariffs, but stressed that such measures would not necessarily incur larger primary spending.

President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has pledged to reciprocate like-for-like if tariffs take effect as promised, but Haddad on Monday said Brazil would not seek to punish U.S. companies operating in the country.

Christmas of ‘84, my estranged Aunt Janet got me a Contax RTS II,  wrapped in a nice blue box. Along with the camera, there was a card decorated with neat, loopy cursive that read,

# To document all your adventures. 

# Love, Aunt Janet. 

In the following spring, I snapped only a couple of pictures. I didn’t go on any adventures like my Aunt suggested, mostly because I wasn’t allowed to stray too far from the house and I also had no friends. Instead, I took pictures of the tree that grew in the front yard, the sunlight as it peeked through the leaves in the early morning, and a couple of flowers here and there. I didn’t take any photos of my mother and father but I took plenty of Chris, with his wide smile and the green sweater he loved enough to wear almost constantly. He was happy to be my subject. I think it was because he knew I didn’t have anyone else. He’d lean against the tree or the door of our garage and when I’d tell him to pose like this or like that he’d follow my directions with a bright laugh. 

When spring poured into summer things began to change and, somehow, I managed to capture it all on camera. Looking back on it now, I should’ve known something was wrong. Or, at least, more wrong than usual. 

What was once wide smiles and squinted eyes turned into weary looks and furrowed brows. Chris no longer looked into the eye of the lens and would instead stare intensely into the distance. The photos captured the skin below his eyes sink deeper and the meat of his broad shoulders melt like candle wax. No matter how many photos I managed to capture of  Chris’ descent, none of them lent any clue as to what plagued him so much. 

And now, as I gaze upon the casket at the very front of the room, watching as people I’ve never met nor spoken to graze their hands across the cherry wood, I come to the realization that I’ll never really know. The photo next to the casket is the first I had ever taken of him, he wore his signature green sweater and was leaning against the shutter doors of our garage. His smile was soft and the sun glittered against his dark skin. When I think about Chris, this is who I remember, no matter how long ago it now was. 

This photo was personal to me, and yet, my mother plucked it from my bedside drawer and blew it out to obscene proportions, making it tower over anyone who approached. His smile now uncanny and his eyes peer a little too deep into your soul. It feels wrong, the longer I look at it. It doesn’t feel like Chris anymore. Was it because he looked nothing like the picture the last time I saw him three years ago? Or was it the guilt gnawing at me for not realizing something was wrong sooner. Despite it all, I can’t stop myself from looking at it. 

Through the muffled chatter of the room and the shallowness of my breaths, I manage to pick up the sound of pointed footsteps making their way towards me. 

My gaze drops to the floor and to the right of me I spot sleek, shiny black heels.  

“Matthew, is it?” 

I look up at her as she stands confidently with her arms crossed loosely under her chest. Long, black, velvet gloves encase her slim arms with the exception of the massive rock on her ring finger. Her strawberry-blonde hair makes her look like a star of one of those Farrah Fawcett shampoo commercials I used to watch, my eyes glued so close to the screen I swore I could feel the wind that ran through her hair as she rode on that horse. 

“Yeah.” I say, slumping further into my chair. I don’t get up to greet her or shake her hand. My parents are doing a fine job playing diplomats near the front doors, so I’ll gladly take the “grief-stricken family member” role, thank you. 

“Oh my, well, look at you,” She coos, laying a hand on my shoulder, “you look just as you did when you were young. You remember me, don’t you?” 

If I had *ever* heard a voice as shrill as hers, I’m sure that I would. And yet. 

“Yeah, you’re…you’re-”

“Rene, a friend of your mother’s,” She smiles and it's only a tad uncomfortable to look at. “Honey, I just came over to say that I’m so, so sorry to hear about your brother. I was on vacation in Greece when I heard. It’s such a shame, Christian was such a nice boy.” 

Rage bubbles up in me, the kind that has your chest tight and your heart pumping and as Rene *keeps talking*, her voice only amplifies the ringing in my ears.

“You know, *my* own brother used to tell me that everyone has their time. The time they’re called back up to the Lord.” Her hand squeezes my shoulder and I can practically feel the band of her ring digging in. The ringing is louder. My chest shakes. “Your brother is in a much better place now and, soon enough, that’ll be of some comfort to you.” 

I can’t help it. I laugh. Hard. The room quiets and concerned gazes shift towards me as I clutch my stomach. 

“And how the hell would you know that?” Her hand falls off my shoulder and I stand. “You can’t even remember his name, you fucking dingbat.” 

The mood of the room shifts as the words leave my mouth. From the corner of my eye, I can see my father making his way towards me with tense and sharp footsteps. I’m sure disrupting the funeral is the very last thing that he’d expect me to do, but that’s the absurd thing about it. 

“You’re all here for no goddamn reason!” My legs carry me towards the front of the room where the casket and that god-awful picture sit- still - as if watching the event with bated breaths. The photo looms over me from where it sits on the stand and Chris’ eyes follow me as I grab the board the photo is plastered on to. 

I should stop here. I know that I should. But my body is three steps ahead of any rational decision that my mind could make and it seems my mouth is even further than that. Because the thing is, funerals are for *dead* people, caskets are for bodies and this whole *thing* negates the purpose of a funeral because-

“You can’t have a funeral for someone that isn’t dead.” The board snaps in half and the photo folds in on itself as I crush it beneath my feet. There’s a shocked gasp somewhere in the room and rapid footsteps coming up behind me as I make my way to the casket. My hands grasp the metal handle and just then two sets of arms pull me back. My grip tightens and the casket shifts from where it’s balanced on the small table. With one final tug, my hands slip and the casket tips. 

It sways as I’m dragged down the pew, spewing profanities that are lost to my own ears. The stiff, shocked crowd watches as the casket slides to the ground and rolls on its side. The lid falls open and reveals pristine, white, satin sheets and nothing else.  

The doors bust open and I’m brought into the sweltering heat. I shrug the arms off of me roughly as I stumble onto the lawn of the funeral home. I take only a few steps before turning around. 

Two young men, the age Chris would be, stare at me with an uncomfortable, almost pitying gaze that makes my stomach tighten. 

One of them wrinkles his aquiline nose at me. 

“Shit, dude.” He says. The other one gives him a pointed look with sharp brown eyes before opening his mouth to speak. 

The doors bust open again and my father comes out. 

“Get inside, boys.” His eyes are fixated on me and my feet shift at his gaze. My father’s never hit Chris or me. I think that’s only because bruises are too noticeable, but the threat was always there, looming. It was one of the many reasons that Chris and I were gonna move far away the moment I turned eighteen. 

But Chris is gone and here I am at his fake funeral, wishing for the zillionth time that he’d taken me with him, wherever he went. 

My father waits until the doors close before grabbing me by the scruff of my dress shirt. Maybe this will be the day he finally swings.

“Are you out of your goddamn mind? Do you have any idea how that made you look- how it makes *me* look?”

“Not any worse than how giving up on finding your son makes you look.” I seethe. That’s all my father really cared about at the end of the day, appearances. Anything other than a pristine exterior would send Roger Hague, Mayor of Black Rock, into a fucking frenzy. Mix in two sons that fear him as much as they hate him, and a wife that couldn’t care less about anything else than which animal fur was in season, and you’ve got a recipe for a family that’s nuclear on the outside but rotten on the inside. 

I could see in the way the vein above his eyebrow swelled that he was trying to contain himself. I was safe in the knowledge that as long as we were outside there was not much else he could do than grab me by my shoulders. 

“You want to know why that is, Matthew?” He whispers, his breath heating my face. “Because there *is* no finding Christopher, not anymore.” 

That stops just about everything. Time, even. 

“What are you talking about?” 

“They have a man in custody up north,” He lets go of my dress shirt, smooths the wrinkles and tugs at my suit jacket. On anyone else, the action would’ve looked paternal, caring. “They suspect he might’ve picked Christopher up one night while he was out doing God knows what. There’s no confession, but what they do know is he was passing through town around the time Christopher went missing. That is all I am allowed to say regarding the matter. Anything else would only disrupt the investigation.” 

What the hell does he mean that all he’s allowed to say? As if I’m just some crime fanatic off the street and not his son. 

“That can’t be all you know- all you can tell me.” My breaths come out short, “He’s my brother. *My* brother and I deserve to know just as much as you do!” 

My father glances tensely at the doors of the funeral home, as if worried that my voice will peak more attention. “There are more things that we don’t know than we do. The fact of the matter is, if this guy is who they say he is, Christopher— and his body are gone, and we are not getting him back.” 

Any rebuttals I have fizzle out at that moment. What’s left in my chest is a wide, black, empty pit and the ugly, unnamed swirl of emotions that churn in it. I can’t quite place my finger on it but there are tears welling up in my eyes and exhaustion creeps over me- much like it has since the first night without Chris. 

I’m suddenly small again, a kid drowning in his dad’s suit and my father looms over me like a thunderous cloud, his stare cold and empty. 

“Your mother put so much work into this ceremony,” He sighed, looking past me and into the parking lot. “Such a shame that you had to make it all about you.” 

Something in me shrivels. 

“I think it’s past time you head home.” My father turns without another word and enters the funeral home. 

The sun throbs at the top of my head, but it might as well be pouring rain. 

…

A few days after the fake-funeral, I’m browsing the shelves at the video store. The cashier's eyes are just about plastered on me and I make the assumption that my spaz-out has reached the ears of folks all over town. Which, with a town as small as this one, feels warranted no matter how annoying it is. Walking down the street to get here made me think much of the same, with the lingering looks of passersby as they make a little more space between us without it being overt. At this rate, I’ll have given myself a John Bender reputation- maybe it’ll give me more luck with the ladies, not that that’s a priority right now or that I had any luck at all in the first place. 

I’d relegated myself to my bedroom after the fake-funeral. I haven’t found the motivation to get out of bed at all, instead facing the same wall I’ve been staring at for almost 3 years now, watching the paint chip. It was only until I found that I’ve run out of film for my camera that I got out of bed, and with a strange sense of urgency, too. Maybe it’s because that camera seems to be the only good thing in my life or, at the very least, the thing that makes me feel closer to Chris now that he’s gone… not dead. But gone. 

There are two parts of me waging war. One is young, naive, pessimistic, and still trusting of his father, and the other is, well, not. The other is much older, wiser, not quite an optimist but certainly less of a pessimist, and does not trust a goddamn word that comes out of that man’s mouth.  

Declaring a kid dead without so much of a *hint* of a body? After only two and a half years? Holding a farce of a funeral to which the *whole* *town* is invited, some of whom can barely be bothered to remember his name?

I think of Rene then, her perfect hair and velvet gloves and smarmy grin. It’s all just a facade, a charade to hide the fact that neither my mother or father ever gave a damn about Chris. Much less enough to wait until his body was found before getting the cops to declare him dead. My father’s got just enough control over the cops in our town to make it happen, if he really wanted. 

What my father said at the funeral home lingered like a whisper in the back of my mind and I got the worst pain in my chest. This must be what grief feels like, or at least something akin to it. 

I grab my film from the shelf. My chest is still aching and that just signals to me that I got to get the hell out of here and back to my bedroom. I pay at the counter and avoid the cashier’s eyes, but he doesn’t look too eager to chat either. 

I walk out into the heat and heave a little, humid air filling my lungs. I lean against a utility pole on the corner of the road next to the video store and feel the crinkle of paper under the t-shirt that now feels like a second skin. I turn to look. 

There, the face of Layla Hewitt stares back at me. 

I remember her. Sort of. 

Missing since October of ‘83. I remember Chris mentioning her one day after school, saying how sad it was, that she was such a nice girl, and pretty too. Her long strawberry-blonde hair was better than any Fawcett product could give you, the girls were always jealous of her, so were the older women in town, apparently. I never noticed those kinds of things but Chris did.

She’s been missing longer than Chris and her parents are still putting her posters up around town. I'm not going to lie and say it doesn't make me feel a bit more justified for my behaviour. 

“Matthew?” 

I turn and standing there are the two boys from the fake-funeral. The ones that dragged me down the pew. 

“Yeah,” I say. 

“I’m Lee,” His brown eyes seem much kinder now, complemented by thick black brows, hair to match, and olive-toned skin that shined a little in the sunlight. He’d make a good picture, I thought, twirling the film I bought in my pocket. 

“James,” The other said, with the aquiline nose, sharp blue eyes, and blonde hair that looked almost like hay- didn’t know they made hair that blonde. James continued, “We’re…uh, well-”

“We’re friends of Chris,” Lee turns to James and says in a whisper that I don’t think I’m meant to hear, “Don’t make it weird.”

“I’m not making it weird.” James whispers back, except much louder. Not one for subtly, I guess. 

“You’re...friends of Chris?” I repeat.

“Yes,” They both reply. 

Lee steps forward, taking his hands out of his pockets as if to show he’s not some kind of threat and James’ eyes flicker rapidly between Lee and I. “We’ve been meaning to talk to you, have you got time?” 

We’re sitting at a park bench next to a trail, James’ hands are fiddling in his lap and Lee stands in front of us, shifting on his feet. A jogger passes by and Lee waits until they’re far enough away before starting. 

“James’ family’s got a cabin a little ways outside of town, near Pebble Lake. We’re headed there this weekend to wind down after the… ceremony.” Lee shares a tense look with James and I shift to the edge of my seat. “We wanted to ask you to come with us.” 

With the amount of tension in the air I expected a little bit more than a weekend getaway invitation. Which I’m not really sure if I want to accept, I suspect it’ll run into my lay down and brood time. 

I say as much, not the brooding part, but that I don’t really want to come. Nicely, obviously. 

The two share another look and I find myself glancing back and forth between them. 

“There are some things we’ve been meaning to tell you… about Chris,” James says, whispering his name like it’s some sort of secret. He glances around and the sight of it puts me on edge. “We can’t talk about it in town, it’s not safe.” 

“Safe? If this is some kind of sick joke-” I stand.

“No!” Lee whips his head around after his outburst. He walks up to me and puts his hands on my shoulders. I try to shrug him off but his grip is too sturdy. “No, we’d never- Chris was our best friend. I know we haven’t been the best at being best friends, not reaching out to you. It’s just, we wanted to do it without putting you at… risk.” 

“We were waiting for the right time, the right way to explain it all or at least explain the best we can,” James said quietly, “But now the funeral’s happened, we can’t wait anymore.” 

I get that same sick feeling I got when my father was breathing in my face about never seeing Chris again. What do these guys know that he doesn’t? I guess they notice the pensive look on my face, because James pulls a slip of paper out of his pocket. 

“This is my number. You don’t have to decide yet, just- yeah. We leave on Saturday.” 

I take it out of his hand, which hovers for a moment before he stuffs it in his pocket. He looks at Lee before tilting his head away, a silent sign to leave. 

Lee nods, and James starts down the trail. Lee gives me a lingering look and a small smile. 

“Think about it, okay?” 

I nod, though I’m not sure that I will. 

…

It’s Friday, late-afternoon, and I’m standing outside the police station. Getting there was a blur but I only had one thing on my mind- finding out literally anything about ""the guy up north"". I just hope whatever cop I talk to isn’t a snitch.

I strike gold when I see Marco Pence milling around the front desk. 

When Chris first went missing, I’d wander around town, no destination in sight but desperate to get out of the house. Pence would drive past me in his shiny patrol car after just getting hired onto the force. He’d always find me somehow and drive me home. 

I guess I’m lucky I got picked up by a cop instead of whoever took Chris that one night in August. I wonder what he was thinking then, the moment he realized he couldn’t get out of the car, or that the turn the stranger took wasn’t the one that would get him home, or the moment the roads we grew up on finally began to look unfamiliar. 

I push the thought down and wave Pence over, he catches my eye, greets me with a wide smile, and motions to the chairs to the left of me as he makes his way over. I sit down and he settles into the chair next to me. 

“Didn’t think I’d see the day you’d willingly turn yourself in,” Pence jokes, a smile grows on my face. There was something about Pence that reminded me of Chris, or at least, what I think Chris could’ve been had he gotten the chance. I’ll never know for sure.

“I’m actually here for information,” I say, leaning back against the plush armchair. 

Pence’s got a mildly impressed look on his face. “What kind of information we talkin’? You know, when the Mayor’s son comes around demanding answers, I best have ‘em.” 

“Not here as the Mayor’s son, but I’m hoping for the same treatment,” Pence makes a ‘*go on’* motion. “Is there anything you can tell me about the guy they apprehended up north?”

“Guy up north?” 

“Yeah, the one they think was passing through town the night Chris went missing.”

Pence shakes his head, he’s got a pitying look on his face that tells me that I might not get the answers I want today. “I didn’t hear nothing about a guy up north. Especially not a guy that’s got anything to do with Christopher. Is that the rumor kids are spreading now?” 

The laugh he lets out is bitter and unbelieving, “You know, you’d think with all that cash the kids have got in this town they’d have enough to buy themselves some goddamn class.” 

He fishes a notepad and pen out of his patch pocket. “Tell me who you heard it from, I’ll give ‘em a talkin’ to.”

“No…” I start and it’s like my chest is filling up with water. “It’s alright. Just wanted to see if there was any truth to it, that’s all.” 

Pence examines my face with sad eyes, “You okay, Matthew? You need anything?”

“All good, promise,” I give him a small smile, and the lie is clashing at the back of my teeth like waves on rock. Because, really, what’s the alternative? I tell him that my father lied about my brother being kidnapped and murdered? That two strange boys who are apparently his best friends waited almost 3 years to talk to me about his disappearance? That there’s a small guilty part of me that’s convinced that Pence might be hiding something from me too because, good God, who *hasn’t* been hiding things from me? 

Seems like a lot to get into in one sitting, maybe a couple of sittings instead? In a room with padded walls and me cozied up in a straight jacket because I *feel* like I’m losing my fucking mind. 

“If you say so,” Pence says after a moment of searching my face, “let me know if you ever need anything, okay, kid?”

“Yes, sir.” I say, playing up the good kid role a little more. Seems I’m more like my parents than I thought, appearances and all. “Just— don’t tell anyone I was here, please? I don’t want this getting back to my parents and having them worry. I was just curious, that’s all.” 

I get up to leave and turn back to see Pence ‘zipping’ his lips. I nod as if accepting it. I don’t, though. I can’t. Because if I can’t trust my own father to tell me the truth about Chris, who can I trust? 

I give James a call later that night and pack for Saturday morning. 

… 

“Where is he?”

My mother sits at the kitchen counter with a cup of coffee made from beans that probably cost a small fortune. Still, she sips at it as if it’s tap water. Her hair is in a set of those huge pink rollers she always wears and she’s wrapped in a matching pink robe that goes well with her dark brown skin. 

If I liked her anymore than I do, I would’ve snapped a picture. My camera sits in my bag, untouched. 

“On another one of his trips, hon.” She says, pulling a magazine off the pile and flipping through it. “Up north talking to one councilman or another.”

“You didn’t go with him?” I ask, shifting the strap of my backpack on my shoulder. 

“When have you ever seen me accompany your father on one of his little trips?” She laughs, her lips stretch wide across perfectly white teeth. Behind the glint in her eyes is something dark and prodding, “Do you want me gone or something, Matthew?” 

Our conversations always turn out like this, shifting imperceptibly from casual to something akin to walking through a field of landmines. 

“No, mamma,” I say, “just curious that’s all.” 

She doesn’t reply but her eyes shift to my backpack. She raises a brow. 

“Oh-” I chime, “I’m just going out on a weekend thing with some friends. It’s close by, near Lake Pebble.” 

“With… friends?” She prods. 

“Yeah… Jared and Logan,” I supply. I’m sure that my mother has no idea who James or Lee even are, but something tells me I need to apply as much distance from the truth as possible. 

“When are they coming?” 

“Um-” I check my watch, “soon.”

She says nothing. She just stares. My hackles raise.  

“I’m sorry I didn’t mention it earlier, it was kind of a last minute thing. I think they feel bad after the… funeral.” 

“I see, you did make quite the scene. Acted nothing like how I raised you to be.” Her voice is soft but it still seethes, like a pot left to simmer too long. You don’t know it's hot until you get too close. 

“Right, it was unreasonable and I’m sorry,” I reply, my throat shakes as the words leave my lips. 

She shakes her head, “It was humiliating to your brother’s image. At least *he* knew how to handle himself when things got tough.” 

“You’re right, I-” A honk from outside saves me from anymore grovelling. My mother’s gaze falls to the living room window where outside a red peugeot 205 sits in the driveway. “I gotta go, sorry again.” 

She doesn’t say goodbye as I leave and the tension in my shoulders gradually releases the closer I get to the door. I shut it behind me with a withering breath.

Christmas of ‘84, my estranged Aunt Janet got me a Contax RTS II,  wrapped in a nice blue box. Along with the camera, there was a card decorated with neat, loopy cursive that read,

# To document all your adventures. 

# Love, Aunt Janet. 

In the following spring, I snapped only a couple of pictures. I didn’t go on any adventures like my Aunt suggested, mostly because I wasn’t allowed to stray too far from the house and I also had no friends. Instead, I took pictures of the tree that grew in the front yard, the sunlight as it peeked through the leaves in the early morning, and a couple of flowers here and there. I didn’t take any photos of my mother and father but I took plenty of Chris, with his wide smile and the green sweater he loved enough to wear almost constantly. He was happy to be my subject. I think it was because he knew I didn’t have anyone else. He’d lean against the tree or the door of our garage and when I’d tell him to pose like this or like that he’d follow my directions with a bright laugh. 

When spring poured into summer things began to change and, somehow, I managed to capture it all on camera. Looking back on it now, I should’ve known something was wrong. Or, at least, more wrong than usual. 

What was once wide smiles and squinted eyes turned into weary looks and furrowed brows. Chris no longer looked into the eye of the lens and would instead stare intensely into the distance. The photos captured the skin below his eyes sink deeper and the meat of his broad shoulders melt like candle wax. No matter how many photos I managed to capture of  Chris’ descent, none of them lent any clue as to what plagued him so much. 

And now, as I gaze upon the casket at the very front of the room, watching as people I’ve never met nor spoken to graze their hands across the cherry wood, I come to the realization that I’ll never really know. The photo next to the casket is the first I had ever taken of him, he wore his signature green sweater and was leaning against the shutter doors of our garage. His smile was soft and the sun glittered against his dark skin. When I think about Chris, this is who I remember, no matter how long ago it now was. 

This photo was personal to me, and yet, my mother plucked it from my bedside drawer and blew it out to obscene proportions, making it tower over anyone who approached. His smile now uncanny and his eyes peer a little too deep into your soul. It feels wrong, the longer I look at it. It doesn’t feel like Chris anymore. Was it because he looked nothing like the picture the last time I saw him three years ago? Or was it the guilt gnawing at me for not realizing something was wrong sooner. Despite it all, I can’t stop myself from looking at it. 

Through the muffled chatter of the room and the shallowness of my breaths, I manage to pick up the sound of pointed footsteps making their way towards me. 

My gaze drops to the floor and to the right of me I spot sleek, shiny black heels.  

“Matthew, is it?” 

I look up at her as she stands confidently with her arms crossed loosely under her chest. Long, black, velvet gloves encase her slim arms with the exception of the massive rock on her ring finger. Her strawberry-blonde hair makes her look like a star of one of those Farrah Fawcett shampoo commercials I used to watch, my eyes glued so close to the screen I swore I could feel the wind that ran through her hair as she rode on that horse. 

“Yeah.” I say, slumping further into my chair. I don’t get up to greet her or shake her hand. My parents are doing a fine job playing diplomats near the front doors, so I’ll gladly take the “grief-stricken family member” role, thank you. 

“Oh my, well, look at you,” She coos, laying a hand on my shoulder, “you look just as you did when you were young. You remember me, don’t you?” 

If I had *ever* heard a voice as shrill as hers, I’m sure that I would. And yet. 

“Yeah, you’re…you’re-”

“Rene, a friend of your mother’s,” She smiles and it's only a tad uncomfortable to look at. “Honey, I just came over to say that I’m so, so sorry to hear about your brother. I was on vacation in Greece when I heard. It’s such a shame, Christian was such a nice boy.” 

Rage bubbles up in me, the kind that has your chest tight and your heart pumping and as Rene *keeps talking*, her voice only amplifies the ringing in my ears.

“You know, *my* own brother used to tell me that everyone has their time. The time they’re called back up to the Lord.” Her hand squeezes my shoulder and I can practically feel the band of her ring digging in. The ringing is louder. My chest shakes. “Your brother is in a much better place now and, soon enough, that’ll be of some comfort to you.” 

I can’t help it. I laugh. Hard. The room quiets and concerned gazes shift towards me as I clutch my stomach. 

“And how the hell would you know that?” Her hand falls off my shoulder and I stand. “You can’t even remember his name, you fucking dingbat.” 

The mood of the room shifts as the words leave my mouth. From the corner of my eye, I can see my father making his way towards me with tense and sharp footsteps. I’m sure disrupting the funeral is the very last thing that he’d expect me to do, but that’s the absurd thing about it. 

“You’re all here for no goddamn reason!” My legs carry me towards the front of the room where the casket and that god-awful picture sit- still - as if watching the event with bated breaths. The photo looms over me from where it sits on the stand and Chris’ eyes follow me as I grab the board the photo is plastered on to. 

I should stop here. I know that I should. But my body is three steps ahead of any rational decision that my mind could make and it seems my mouth is even further than that. Because the thing is, funerals are for *dead* people, caskets are for bodies and this whole *thing* negates the purpose of a funeral because-

“You can’t have a funeral for someone that isn’t dead.” The board snaps in half and the photo folds in on itself as I crush it beneath my feet. There’s a shocked gasp somewhere in the room and rapid footsteps coming up behind me as I make my way to the casket. My hands grasp the metal handle and just then two sets of arms pull me back. My grip tightens and the casket shifts from where it’s balanced on the small table. With one final tug, my hands slip and the casket tips. 

It sways as I’m dragged down the pew, spewing profanities that are lost to my own ears. The stiff, shocked crowd watches as the casket slides to the ground and rolls on its side. The lid falls open and reveals pristine, white, satin sheets and nothing else.  

The doors bust open and I’m brought into the sweltering heat. I shrug the arms off of me roughly as I stumble onto the lawn of the funeral home. I take only a few steps before turning around. 

Two young men, the age Chris would be, stare at me with an uncomfortable, almost pitying gaze that makes my stomach tighten. 

One of them wrinkles his aquiline nose at me. 

“Shit, dude.” He says. The other one gives him a pointed look with sharp brown eyes before opening his mouth to speak. 

The doors bust open again and my father comes out. 

“Get inside, boys.” His eyes are fixated on me and my feet shift at his gaze. My father’s never hit Chris or me. I think that’s only because bruises are too noticeable, but the threat was always there, looming. It was one of the many reasons that Chris and I were gonna move far away the moment I turned eighteen. 

But Chris is gone and here I am at his fake funeral, wishing for the zillionth time that he’d taken me with him, wherever he went. 

My father waits until the doors close before grabbing me by the scruff of my dress shirt. Maybe this will be the day he finally swings.

“Are you out of your goddamn mind? Do you have any idea how that made you look- how it makes *me* look?”

“Not any worse than how giving up on finding your son makes you look.” I seethe. That’s all my father really cared about at the end of the day, appearances. Anything other than a pristine exterior would send Roger Hague, Mayor of Black Rock, into a fucking frenzy. Mix in two sons that fear him as much as they hate him, and a wife that couldn’t care less about anything else than which animal fur was in season, and you’ve got a recipe for a family that’s nuclear on the outside but rotten on the inside. 

I could see in the way the vein above his eyebrow swelled that he was trying to contain himself. I was safe in the knowledge that as long as we were outside there was not much else he could do than grab me by my shoulders. 

“You want to know why that is, Matthew?” He whispers, his breath heating my face. “Because there *is* no finding Christopher, not anymore.” 

That stops just about everything. Time, even. 

“What are you talking about?” 

“They have a man in custody up north,” He lets go of my dress shirt, smooths the wrinkles and tugs at my suit jacket. On anyone else, the action would’ve looked paternal, caring. “They suspect he might’ve picked Christopher up one night while he was out doing God knows what. There’s no confession, but what they do know is he was passing through town around the time Christopher went missing. That is all I am allowed to say regarding the matter. Anything else would only disrupt the investigation.” 

What the hell does he mean that all he’s allowed to say? As if I’m just some crime fanatic off the street and not his son. 

“That can’t be all you know- all you can tell me.” My breaths come out short, “He’s my brother. *My* brother and I deserve to know just as much as you do!” 

My father glances tensely at the doors of the funeral home, as if worried that my voice will peak more attention. “There are more things that we don’t know than we do. The fact of the matter is, if this guy is who they say he is, Christopher— and his body are gone, and we are not getting him back.” 

Any rebuttals I have fizzle out at that moment. What’s left in my chest is a wide, black, empty pit and the ugly, unnamed swirl of emotions that churn in it. I can’t quite place my finger on it but there are tears welling up in my eyes and exhaustion creeps over me- much like it has since the first night without Chris. 

I’m suddenly small again, a kid drowning in his dad’s suit and my father looms over me like a thunderous cloud, his stare cold and empty. 

“Your mother put so much work into this ceremony,” He sighed, looking past me and into the parking lot. “Such a shame that you had to make it all about you.” 

Something in me shrivels. 

“I think it’s past time you head home.” My father turns without another word and enters the funeral home. 

The sun throbs at the top of my head, but it might as well be pouring rain. 

…

A few days after the fake-funeral, I’m browsing the shelves at the video store. The cashier's eyes are just about plastered on me and I make the assumption that my spaz-out has reached the ears of folks all over town. Which, with a town as small as this one, feels warranted no matter how annoying it is. Walking down the street to get here made me think much of the same, with the lingering looks of passersby as they make a little more space between us without it being overt. At this rate, I’ll have given myself a John Bender reputation- maybe it’ll give me more luck with the ladies, not that that’s a priority right now or that I had any luck at all in the first place. 

I’d relegated myself to my bedroom after the fake-funeral. I haven’t found the motivation to get out of bed at all, instead facing the same wall I’ve been staring at for almost 3 years now, watching the paint chip. It was only until I found that I’ve run out of film for my camera that I got out of bed, and with a strange sense of urgency, too. Maybe it’s because that camera seems to be the only good thing in my life or, at the very least, the thing that makes me feel closer to Chris now that he’s gone… not dead. But gone. 

There are two parts of me waging war. One is young, naive, pessimistic, and still trusting of his father, and the other is, well, not. The other is much older, wiser, not quite an optimist but certainly less of a pessimist, and does not trust a goddamn word that comes out of that man’s mouth.  

Declaring a kid dead without so much of a *hint* of a body? After only two and a half years? Holding a farce of a funeral to which the *whole* *town* is invited, some of whom can barely be bothered to remember his name?

I think of Rene then, her perfect hair and velvet gloves and smarmy grin. It’s all just a facade, a charade to hide the fact that neither my mother or father ever gave a damn about Chris. Much less enough to wait until his body was found before getting the cops to declare him dead. My father’s got just enough control over the cops in our town to make it happen, if he really wanted. 

What my father said at the funeral home lingered like a whisper in the back of my mind and I got the worst pain in my chest. This must be what grief feels like, or at least something akin to it. 

I grab my film from the shelf. My chest is still aching and that just signals to me that I got to get the hell out of here and back to my bedroom. I pay at the counter and avoid the cashier’s eyes, but he doesn’t look too eager to chat either. 

I walk out into the heat and heave a little, humid air filling my lungs. I lean against a utility pole on the corner of the road next to the video store and feel the crinkle of paper under the t-shirt that now feels like a second skin. I turn to look. 

There, the face of Layla Hewitt stares back at me. 

I remember her. Sort of. 

Missing since October of ‘83. I remember Chris mentioning her one day after school, saying how sad it was, that she was such a nice girl, and pretty too. Her long strawberry-blonde hair was better than any Fawcett product could give you, the girls were always jealous of her, so were the older women in town, apparently. I never noticed those kinds of things but Chris did.

She’s been missing longer than Chris and her parents are still putting her posters up around town. I'm not going to lie and say it doesn't make me feel a bit more justified for my behaviour. 

“Matthew?” 

I turn and standing there are the two boys from the fake-funeral. The ones that dragged me down the pew. 

“Yeah,” I say. 

“I’m Lee,” His brown eyes seem much kinder now, complemented by thick black brows, hair to match, and olive-toned skin that shined a little in the sunlight. He’d make a good picture, I thought, twirling the film I bought in my pocket. 

“James,” The other said, with the aquiline nose, sharp blue eyes, and blonde hair that looked almost like hay- didn’t know they made hair that blonde. James continued, “We’re…uh, well-”

“We’re friends of Chris,” Lee turns to James and says in a whisper that I don’t think I’m meant to hear, “Don’t make it weird.”

“I’m not making it weird.” James whispers back, except much louder. Not one for subtly, I guess. 

“You’re...friends of Chris?” I repeat.

“Yes,” They both reply. 

Lee steps forward, taking his hands out of his pockets as if to show he’s not some kind of threat and James’ eyes flicker rapidly between Lee and I. “We’ve been meaning to talk to you, have you got time?” 

We’re sitting at a park bench next to a trail, James’ hands are fiddling in his lap and Lee stands in front of us, shifting on his feet. A jogger passes by and Lee waits until they’re far enough away before starting. 

“James’ family’s got a cabin a little ways outside of town, near Pebble Lake. We’re headed there this weekend to wind down after the… ceremony.” Lee shares a tense look with James and I shift to the edge of my seat. “We wanted to ask you to come with us.” 

With the amount of tension in the air I expected a little bit more than a weekend getaway invitation. Which I’m not really sure if I want to accept, I suspect it’ll run into my lay down and brood time. 

I say as much, not the brooding part, but that I don’t really want to come. Nicely, obviously. 

The two share another look and I find myself glancing back and forth between them. 

“There are some things we’ve been meaning to tell you… about Chris,” James says, whispering his name like it’s some sort of secret. He glances around and the sight of it puts me on edge. “We can’t talk about it in town, it’s not safe.” 

“Safe? If this is some kind of sick joke-” I stand.

“No!” Lee whips his head around after his outburst. He walks up to me and puts his hands on my shoulders. I try to shrug him off but his grip is too sturdy. “No, we’d never- Chris was our best friend. I know we haven’t been the best at being best friends, not reaching out to you. It’s just, we wanted to do it without putting you at… risk.” 

“We were waiting for the right time, the right way to explain it all or at least explain the best we can,” James said quietly, “But now the funeral’s happened, we can’t wait anymore.” 

I get that same sick feeling I got when my father was breathing in my face about never seeing Chris again. What do these guys know that he doesn’t? I guess they notice the pensive look on my face, because James pulls a slip of paper out of his pocket. 

“This is my number. You don’t have to decide yet, just- yeah. We leave on Saturday.” 

I take it out of his hand, which hovers for a moment before he stuffs it in his pocket. He looks at Lee before tilting his head away, a silent sign to leave. 

Lee nods, and James starts down the trail. Lee gives me a lingering look and a small smile. 

“Think about it, okay?” 

I nod, though I’m not sure that I will. 

…

It’s Friday, late-afternoon, and I’m standing outside the police station. Getting there was a blur but I only had one thing on my mind- finding out literally anything about ""the guy up north"". I just hope whatever cop I talk to isn’t a snitch.

I strike gold when I see Marco Pence milling around the front desk. 

When Chris first went missing, I’d wander around town, no destination in sight but desperate to get out of the house. Pence would drive past me in his shiny patrol car after just getting hired onto the force. He’d always find me somehow and drive me home. 

I guess I’m lucky I got picked up by a cop instead of whoever took Chris that one night in August. I wonder what he was thinking then, the moment he realized he couldn’t get out of the car, or that the turn the stranger took wasn’t the one that would get him home, or the moment the roads we grew up on finally began to look unfamiliar. 

I push the thought down and wave Pence over, he catches my eye, greets me with a wide smile, and motions to the chairs to the left of me as he makes his way over. I sit down and he settles into the chair next to me. 

“Didn’t think I’d see the day you’d willingly turn yourself in,” Pence jokes, a smile grows on my face. There was something about Pence that reminded me of Chris, or at least, what I think Chris could’ve been had he gotten the chance. I’ll never know for sure.

“I’m actually here for information,” I say, leaning back against the plush armchair. 

Pence’s got a mildly impressed look on his face. “What kind of information we talkin’? You know, when the Mayor’s son comes around demanding answers, I best have ‘em.” 

“Not here as the Mayor’s son, but I’m hoping for the same treatment,” Pence makes a ‘*go on’* motion. “Is there anything you can tell me about the guy they apprehended up north?”

“Guy up north?” 

“Yeah, the one they think was passing through town the night Chris went missing.”

Pence shakes his head, he’s got a pitying look on his face that tells me that I might not get the answers I want today. “I didn’t hear nothing about a guy up north. Especially not a guy that’s got anything to do with Christopher. Is that the rumor kids are spreading now?” 

The laugh he lets out is bitter and unbelieving, “You know, you’d think with all that cash the kids have got in this town they’d have enough to buy themselves some goddamn class.” 

He fishes a notepad and pen out of his patch pocket. “Tell me who you heard it from, I’ll give ‘em a talkin’ to.”

“No…” I start and it’s like my chest is filling up with water. “It’s alright. Just wanted to see if there was any truth to it, that’s all.” 

Pence examines my face with sad eyes, “You okay, Matthew? You need anything?”

“All good, promise,” I give him a small smile, and the lie is clashing at the back of my teeth like waves on rock. Because, really, what’s the alternative? I tell him that my father lied about my brother being kidnapped and murdered? That two strange boys who are apparently his best friends waited almost 3 years to talk to me about his disappearance? That there’s a small guilty part of me that’s convinced that Pence might be hiding something from me too because, good God, who *hasn’t* been hiding things from me? 

Seems like a lot to get into in one sitting, maybe a couple of sittings instead? In a room with padded walls and me cozied up in a straight jacket because I *feel* like I’m losing my fucking mind. 

“If you say so,” Pence says after a moment of searching my face, “let me know if you ever need anything, okay, kid?”

“Yes, sir.” I say, playing up the good kid role a little more. Seems I’m more like my parents than I thought, appearances and all. “Just— don’t tell anyone I was here, please? I don’t want this getting back to my parents and having them worry. I was just curious, that’s all.” 

I get up to leave and turn back to see Pence ‘zipping’ his lips. I nod as if accepting it. I don’t, though. I can’t. Because if I can’t trust my own father to tell me the truth about Chris, who can I trust? 

I give James a call later that night and pack for Saturday morning. 

… 

“Where is he?”

My mother sits at the kitchen counter with a cup of coffee made from beans that probably cost a small fortune. Still, she sips at it as if it’s tap water. Her hair is in a set of those huge pink rollers she always wears and she’s wrapped in a matching pink robe that goes well with her dark brown skin. 

If I liked her anymore than I do, I would’ve snapped a picture. My camera sits in my bag, untouched. 

“On another one of his trips, hon.” She says, pulling a magazine off the pile and flipping through it. “Up north talking to one councilman or another.”

“You didn’t go with him?” I ask, shifting the strap of my backpack on my shoulder. 

“When have you ever seen me accompany your father on one of his little trips?” She laughs, her lips stretch wide across perfectly white teeth. Behind the glint in her eyes is something dark and prodding, “Do you want me gone or something, Matthew?” 

Our conversations always turn out like this, shifting imperceptibly from casual to something akin to walking through a field of landmines. 

“No, mamma,” I say, “just curious that’s all.” 

She doesn’t reply but her eyes shift to my backpack. She raises a brow. 

“Oh-” I chime, “I’m just going out on a weekend thing with some friends. It’s close by, near Lake Pebble.” 

“With… friends?” She prods. 

“Yeah… Jared and Logan,” I supply. I’m sure that my mother has no idea who James or Lee even are, but something tells me I need to apply as much distance from the truth as possible. 

“When are they coming?” 

“Um-” I check my watch, “soon.”

She says nothing. She just stares. My hackles raise.  

“I’m sorry I didn’t mention it earlier, it was kind of a last minute thing. I think they feel bad after the… funeral.” 

“I see, you did make quite the scene. Acted nothing like how I raised you to be.” Her voice is soft but it still seethes, like a pot left to simmer too long. You don’t know it's hot until you get too close. 

“Right, it was unreasonable and I’m sorry,” I reply, my throat shakes as the words leave my lips. 

She shakes her head, “It was humiliating to your brother’s image. At least *he* knew how to handle himself when things got tough.” 

“You’re right, I-” A honk from outside saves me from anymore grovelling. My mother’s gaze falls to the living room window where outside a red peugeot 205 sits in the driveway. “I gotta go, sorry again.” 

She doesn’t say goodbye as I leave and the tension in my shoulders gradually releases the closer I get to the door. I shut it behind me with a withering breath.

James waves his hand out the passenger window and I give a limp wave back before making my way to the car.",1,1753131350.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False
1m5upjf,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1m5upjf/the_hug_a_story_about_robin_williams/,The Hug (A story about Robin Williams),"Since I was spending most of the summer in Los Angeles, Adam and I needed an apartment with two actual bedrooms. And since I had the gig at Comedy Express, I didn’t need to sleep on a futon in a living room anymore. As wonderful and clutch as Betsy’s place was, we’d outgrown it.



Looking for a low-level apartment in New York is an adventure, as there’s such an enormous range of poverty and luxury, new buildings and history, and crooked real estate agents and very crooked real estate agents. Looking for an apartment in Los Angeles is way easier as almost everything was built within a few decades and you’re really just choosing which gray carpet and vertical white blinds you can afford.



We found a place just southeast of Sunset and La Brea, which was both convenient to the clubs and also had the most Los Angeles view in Los Angeles. At once we could see the Jim Henson Studios across the street from a strip club. Neither were going to have my picture in the window.



I quickly realized that Los Angeles is a very difficult place to develop as a comic because it’s a big risk to try new material. I got booked to do a coffee house show that only had eight people in the crowd. It was a rough show, made even rougher when I found out that one of the eight was a casting director for Disney.



The best place in America to start as a comic is anywhere but New York or Los Angeles. The competition in New York will hone you, but you need to be good enough to get the opportunity to face that competition. Opportunities are everywhere in Los Angeles, but so are celebrities vying for them so you better already be great. Get good first, then move to New York to get great, then move to Los Angeles to get famous. Unfortunately, I was born in New York so I started out wrong from the beginning.



Dublin’s was the perfect example of needing to be great to get an opportunity. Ask any comedian who lived in Los Angeles during the early 2000s and they will wax poetic about Dublin’s. Dublin’s was a bar on the Sunset Strip that was packed every week with hundreds of beautiful rich people and beautiful people pretending to be rich. Celebrities regularly hung out backstage and almost everyone on the lineup had some sort of impressive TV credit. Dane Cook, at the height of his popularity, would close Dublin’s every week.



Dublin’s producer was Jay Davis, who I knew through BrewCo. I hung out at Dublin’s each week and never asked for a spot. I just wanted to be part of the energy around it. One show, a few comics were late, and none of the comedians there wanted to go first. They were performing at Dublin’s to impress the beautiful and rich audience, and none of them wanted to start from scratch. Jay had seen my set at BrewCo a dozen times, so when I saw him frantically looking for a comic backstage, I finally spoke up.



“Jay, I could do five.”



And he said yes.



The five minutes went by in a blur. At the end of the set, Jay told the crowd that he’d have me back and they cheered. Jay was never able to make good on that claim – Dublin’s was sold shortly thereafter, and it’s currently being built into high-rises. But those five minutes at Dublin’s was the closest I’ve ever felt to being a rock star.



I walked to my car with a few comedians after the show. I’d lucked out and gotten a great spot half a block down from Dublin’s, a rarity as it was hard to find parking on the Sunset Strip. Not wanting to be the punchline of a hundred busted car jokes, I walked past my car and pretended I’d parked a few blocks further. I circled back alone and got in my shaky Camry, hoping it would start without issue. I was very quickly reminded I was not a rock star.



I drove back to my apartment and told Adam about the night. I also told him I wanted to get a better car. The car was embarrassing, but it was also unreliable and getting worse. If I was going to be driving to gigs, I needed to be sure I was going to get there.



Adam had a new Chevy Cavalier, and I was never sure how he could afford it until that night. Adam told me he took a $20,000 loan in order to pay for the car.



“I didn’t move out here to eke by,” Adam said. “I was doing that in New York. I moved out here to make it.”



Adam paid off the loan with what he made from producing those marathon shows at BrewCo, as the club paid him based on their bar sales. And since drunk UCLA students were a renewable resource, Adam made a few hundred bucks each show and was able to pay off the car.



I had been deciding between versions of slightly less crappy cars, while Adam took out a loan for my previous year’s income to buy a new one.



Adam had a point – I didn’t move to Los Angeles to eke by either. And I needed something more reliable with decent mileage and that didn’t make an “eek” sound when I drove.



I do not recommend what I did next, but I bought a new car. One of my favorite maxims has always been “necessity is the mother of invention.” And since it was a necessity to make the car payment every month, I invented.



I hadn’t produced any shows since I’d gotten to LA, but that was how I made my rent in New York, so I tried it in Los Angeles, too. Through the independent shows I had been on at the Improv, I’d gotten to know the booker. So I approached him with the concept of producing a show of young comics called Youth Revolution. They gave me the late show Friday slot, as that had been struggling to find a regular audience, and I got to work promoting.



I hit Myspace and Facebook, hard. I shared flyers for the show and posted videos of the comics. And by the day of the first show, we were completely sold out. I earned three car payments that first night.



I continued producing Youth Revolution, which led to my favorite moment in my career.



I had just taken the stage to host the show when one of the servers passed me a note. I’d never been passed a note on stage before, so I assumed it was extremely important. Perhaps the first comic was suddenly ill or someone needed to go up early, or a very large party spending an obscene amount of money on drinks was insisting that we wish them a happy birthday.



I read the note and I could not hide my excitement from the crowd, but then had to do another ten minutes. I told the crowd that I would reveal the contents of the note at the end of my set, which had the added benefit of getting them to pay attention.



When ten minutes had passed, I held the note up and read it.



“The first part of the note says ‘ten minutes’ I said, “And it’s been that long. The second part of the note says…”



I paused, looked to the door to make sure he was there, pointed, and with all the excitement I was actually feeling yelled, “Robin Williams!”



It was the first time I’d ever seen anyone get a standing ovation at the beginning of their set.



Robin Williams was prepping to film Man of the Year, a movie where a stand-up comedian runs for president. Whenever someone plays a stand-up comedian in TV or film, even if they already are one, they have to test the material in the script in front of a real crowd to make sure it’s actually funny. So Robin Williams was bouncing around the clubs in LA working on his character’s set. And he found himself at the Improv as the Friday late show started.



I watched as one of the all-time greats ripped the room apart. The next comic joked with me about how he really appreciated that I was making him follow Robin Williams.



“I’m not making you follow Robin Williams,” I said. “Robin is.”



“Oh, that makes it so much better,” he quipped.



“Don’t worry,” I said. “As soon as you’re on that stage, he’s not anymore.”



After Robin finished his set, I did my best to re-set the table before bringing the next act on, both out of compassion and because it was my show and I wanted it to go well.



“Welcome to Youth Revolution,” I said. “Where it’s not always youth, but it’s always a revolution. I promised you it would be a great show, and it’s only twenty-five minutes in and it’s already been the best show you’ve ever seen. Make sure to come back next week, when our special guest will be the ghost of Lenny Bruce. With Kurt Cobain on guitar.”



Knowing I had fifteen minutes before the next comic was done, I walked out of the showroom and into the bar to see if I could say hello to Robin Williams.



Robin was standing there by himself, quietly surveying the bar as if to see if it had changed since his days as a regular there.



“Mr. Williams, thank you for doing the show,” I nervously said in one breath. Since Robin also spoke quickly, he understood it.



For the next fourteen minutes, we talked comedy. He told me about the movie and asked about my career and if I enjoyed living in Los Angeles. I asked about his first few years and about stand-up vs. television and film, and, before I knew it, my time with him was up. I had to get back into the showroom.



This was before everyone had a camera on their phone, so I had a real camera with me to take publicity shots of the show. I debated whether or not to ask Robin for a picture – I didn’t want to bother him, but more so I was worried about dropping myself in his eyes from colleague to fan.



“When else are you going to get a chance to take a picture with a legend?” I remembered Randy Kagan saying. I handed my camera to a comic and sheepishly asked Robin if he’d take a picture with me.



Robin gave me a giant bear hug, smiled, and said, “How about now?” Nine years later, after suffering from severe depression and anxiety due to diffuse Lewy body dementia, Robin took his own life. That picture is a reminder of many things: how fleeting it can all be, that it’s hard to truly know what someone is going through, and that success and adoration don’t equal happiness. But more so, it is a reminder that – like the spot at Dublin’s – I never would have gotten that picture if I hadn’t asked. And I never would have produced that show if I didn’t believe in myself enough to buy that car.



I drove home that night, smiling. That was a really great hug.

And the thing is, I can't possibly take her out to a proper restaurant. Shit I've never even been there my life. Furthest I've got is a buffet at a rooftop bar. She just went out with her friends to a steakhouse. And that kinda fks with me mentally. She got me a gift. A Daniel Wellington bracelet. That shit was expensive. Like I can never spend that amount on myself. The most expensive thing i own is probably my watch. And it's like half the price of her gift. And it's her birthday soon. I have plenty of coffee, papers and origami tutorials. That's about it. And when we meet, I always pay ofc. I don't care how broke I get, I always pay. Even if that means taking out the last note. It's what a guy does. He pays. Sure I can pay for our meals here and there, buy her coffee and shit but I can't pay seriously. what if I meet her parents? What do I say? I'm broke? It's like that. I'm not like depressed or anything but yk. It's just a part of my life that I get to deal with.
And ofc it's no one's fault. We all got different baselines. She probably doesn't know I'm this broke. And it takes something to say that. If she says she's broke, she just ran out of pocket money. If I say I'm broke, I'm broke in real life. My family's broke. They're not that far off. We live decently and I'm grateful for the things I have in my life but I'm not someone who can go out to a steakhouse just because last week was chaotic. If my last week was chaotic, I'd buy a cigarette maybe. Not a hickory bbq chicken.

I (31F) have a dilemma re: if friendships are 'worth' saving or keeping up...i totally understand not everyone is chronically online, I'm not, and sometimes just don't respond for hours/days, but there is a massive distinction - bad texters vs people who are just not interested in you at all. 

Recently I've been having doubts about the sincerity of some of my friendships with people that are self-diagnosed 'bad texters'. I don't think people owe me a text back, BUT...if someone texts me after weeks of silence from their end (or a very one-sided conversation), clearly needing something, and even overplaying their interest in my life ('omggg how have you been i haven't heard from you in so long??' And two messages later the very dreaded ""sooo question...' - side note: this is how i feel people like this are speaking, fake and manipulative), I have a serious reason to believe they're just taking advantage.  (Then if they really don't mean it, they hit me with 'we need to grab a coffee and catch up soon!' And before I know it, it's back to silence again.)

I have recently started therapy (and also got diagnosed, apparently I'm on the spectrum, something I'm learning to accept and not hate) it's just helping me realize how many 'friends' I have in my circle...I'm quite frankly appaled about not seeing it sooner. I'm just not sure where to make friends that won't hit you with a 'hey girl' text after months of no communication whatsoever, and only to ask a favour, then proceed to disappear again. I do have friends, real friends. I treasure them more than anything. But it stings that I seem to be unable to make a new friendship stick.

The life that starts after you're told your brain is not whack, just different, is harder to navigate than I'd even dream. I have an answer to the question ""why am I like this?"" but it's too open-ended and doesn't provide a straightforward solution. I'm grumpier and more confused by the world as I learn to navigate it, and that may also be the reason for not being taken seriously by others, and it's completely valid, because my diagnosis is not an asshole pass. But I'm also attentive and will remember what people tell me about, how they communicate, I am supportive, meticulous, and will plan for xyz different scenarios. I think I'm just sad that I find it harder to make new friendships that actually last and are not one sided. ",2,1753131019.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

How do I move forward?,"I (24F) am in a healthcare college program and recently got completely blindsided by a classmate (32F) who I thought was a good friend. We were close in the beginning, we carpooled to school together (we live over an hour away), and I always offered to pay gas money, but she refused every time. She’d even offer to buy me coffee or snacks sometimes, and I always returned the favor. I never once asked for money or help. When I drove, she would sometimes offer me cash and I politely declined but she always insisted and would leave cash in my car.

We had lots of long talks in the car. I confided in her and really trusted her. I supported her, woke up early to be at her house before school (which was out of my way unless we carpooled), and let it slide when she stood me up without warning more than once. She also told me I was one of the only people in school she felt close to. I believed we were genuinely friends.

Then out of nowhere she completely stopped talking to me. She started ignoring me at school, acting cold and distant. I didn’t push and I gave her space. I reached out to her asking if she was okay and if she would talk to me about it but she refused and said she heard I was speaking badly about her. It was left at that. Then, out of nowhere, she texted me a long message accusing me of: •	Harassing her •	Talking badly about her private medical issues (something with her liver) •	Using her for coffee and gas money •	Making her do the heavy lifting on a shared school project without paying her

I was shocked. None of this is true. I never talked badly about her. She confided in myself and another classmate (20F) about her liver, and when it was brought up lightly at lunch, I mentioned she had said something about it once. That’s it. I wasn’t mocking or gossiping, I was genuinely concerned.

She also volunteered to help more with our project. I never asked her to do more than her share, and I did pay my part, more than any of the other students in our group actually. She’d previously insisted on helping and didn’t act like it was a problem until suddenly it was but only towards myself, not the other girls.

There was also a weird misunderstanding, I think. On the day she texted me, I made a joke (not directed at anyone) in class about sending my fuel bill to the school because of how far I drove for an early session and not enough space/time for everyone to practice. I think she overheard and twisted it to think I was saying I should send the fuel bill to her, which isn’t what I said or meant at all.

After her message, I didn’t respond. I blocked her number and chose to just move forward and focus on school. I haven’t said anything about her to anyone, even though I’ve heard she’s still speaking poorly about me behind my back. I’ve done nothing to escalate this. I just want peace.

Looking back, I realize she often dominated conversations and spoke over me, gossiped about people she is now being so nice to and trying to be good friends with and I now think she may have some narcissistic tendencies. She love-bombed me early on and completely flipped once I no longer fit her narrative.

1m5uiku,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1m5uiku/classmate_i_trusted_accused_me_of_harassment_and/,Classmate I trusted accused me of harassment and gossip. I’m blindsided and hurt. How do I move forward?,"I (24F) am in a healthcare college program and recently got completely blindsided by a classmate (32F) who I thought was a good friend. We were close in the beginning, we carpooled to school together (we live over an hour away), and I always offered to pay gas money, but she refused every time. She’d even offer to buy me coffee or snacks sometimes, and I always returned the favor. I never once asked for money or help. When I drove, she would sometimes offer me cash and I politely declined but she always insisted and would leave cash in my car. 

We had lots of long talks in the car. I confided in her and really trusted her. I supported her, woke up early to be at her house before school (which was out of my way unless we carpooled), and let it slide when she stood me up without warning more than once. She also told me I was one of the only people in school she felt close to. I believed we were genuinely friends.

Then out of nowhere she completely stopped talking to me. She started ignoring me at school, acting cold and distant. I didn’t push and I gave her space. I reached out to her asking if she was okay and if she would talk to me about it but she refused and said she heard I was speaking badly about her. It was left at that. Then, out of nowhere, she texted me a long message accusing me of:
	•	Harassing her
	•	Talking badly about her private medical issues (something with her liver)
	•	Using her for coffee and gas money
	•	Making her do the heavy lifting on a shared school project without paying her

I was shocked. None of this is true. I never talked badly about her. She confided in myself and another classmate (20F) about her liver, and when it was brought up lightly at lunch, I mentioned she had said something about it once. That’s it. I wasn’t mocking or gossiping, I was genuinely concerned.

She also volunteered to help more with our project. I never asked her to do more than her share, and I did pay my part, more than any of the other students in our group actually. She’d previously insisted on helping and didn’t act like it was a problem until suddenly it was but only towards myself, not the other girls. 

There was also a weird misunderstanding, I think. On the day she texted me, I made a joke (not directed at anyone) in class about sending my fuel bill to the school because of how far I drove for an early session and not enough space/time for everyone to practice. I think she overheard and twisted it to think I was saying I should send the fuel bill to her, which isn’t what I said or meant at all.

After her message, I didn’t respond. I blocked her number and chose to just move forward and focus on school. I haven’t said anything about her to anyone, even though I’ve heard she’s still speaking poorly about me behind my back. I’ve done nothing to escalate this. I just want peace.

Looking back, I realize she often dominated conversations and spoke over me, gossiped about people she is now being so nice to and trying to be good friends with and I now think she may have some narcissistic tendencies. She love-bombed me early on and completely flipped once I no longer fit her narrative.

I’m hurt, but I’m trying to grow from this. I want to learn how to set better boundaries, especially with new people. I tend to go above and beyond for others even when they wouldn’t do the same for me and I end up getting hurt.

EDIT: I want to add context from a hurtful text she sent me today. In it, she accused me of leeching, using her, and talking badly about her private medical condition. none of which are true. She went on to say that I need to “self-reflect” and that it’s not her fault I’m broke. which was especially shocking and cruel. I never asked her for money. She insisted on contributing gas money when I drove (even when I declined), and she often offered to buy snacks or coffee, which I always tried to reciprocate whenever I could.

For young people it’s just another catch 22 situation like the job experience catch 22. Real world networking isn’t reaching out to strangers on LinkedIn for coffee chats or emailing people at companies you don’t know/vaguely know asking for a referral. That’s considered cringe and doesn’t even work in an oversaturated market where everyone else is also doing that.

Sure, reaching out to former classmates/coworkers, alumni, or professors to inquire about employment opportunities is one thing, but that’s not how the vast majority of networking manifests in the real world for young people. Most ""networking"" for young people is literally just a big circle jerk of families and close friends giving each other employment. It’s a method of class preservation. That’s why it’s so hard for people who don’t already have a network to network.

Anytime I see someone tell a new grad to ""just network"" you know they came from a position of privilege because, I’ll give an example, a first generation college student from a lower class family that went to an average state school does not have the background or resources to properly network.",2,1753130671.0,InterviewCoderPro,0,1.0,False

1m5ug4u,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1m5ug4u/i_have_no_idea_why_my_boyfriend_changed_so/,"I have no idea why my boyfriend changed so abruptly, I eventually broke things off.","Hi. So about a month ago I (22F) broke things off with this guy (26M) I had been seeing for a few months. Yeah, we were going steady, but I don't think we were going out long enough for him to get as attached as he was to me. 

Let me put this all into context: I met him on Hinge back in March or April of 2025, and we started hanging out a lot. He lived about 45 minutes from me, and that didn't change when I graduated and moved back home with my parent. He was funny and he's the only guy I dated that brought me flowers, which I probably let sway my opinion of him a little too much. We had a similar sense of humor and he was super friendly. He was a good communicator and we talked via text or called each other almost every day if we weren't going to meet each other in person. He was always planning dates, like dinner or golfing, and overall we had a lot of fun together. Not only was he a good person, but he was incredibly handsome as well, which is just the icing on the cake. 

We both lived at home because he is still in grad school and trying to save money, and I just graduated from undergrad and moved back in with my own family while I look for a full-time job. I'm mentioning this just because it explains why we met each other's families so early in the relationship. At first it was just a quick hello or a short conversation with my parents when he picked me up from my house to go to dinner, and I would greet his mom when I went over to his. But he kept asking me when he would meet my parents ""for real."" He invited himself to dinner with my parents a lot; just quick ""so when am I eating with your family?"" I thought that was kind of weird and a little rude, since I was raised not to invite myself places. You're only invited if you're actually invited, but I digress... I didn't want him to think I wasn't interested, because I definitely was, but having a formal dinner with either of our parents was just a lot really early in our relationship. He invited me to his birthday dinner with his dad and step-family , and I said yes, but I felt like I was just there. No one on his dad's side of the family really engaged with me. I'm not really complaining about that, since that's a lot of people to meet all at once, but I felt like I was intruding on a family moment. 

The first REAL red flag appeared the day of his birthday when he turned 26. We weren't able to celebrate the day of because he had work and I had a Dr's appointment, but we had dinner and hung out the day before. I texted him birthday wishes in the morning before my appointment and we had normal communications the entire day until nighttime. He sent me a text asking me why I hadn't posted a birthday story for him on Instagram... I thought that was super weird since I'm not really a birthday story person. If I see a mutual friend post a birthday story for a person, I'm reminded of their birthday and of the idea of a birthday post. But usually I just do it for long-time friends. I was kind of caught off-guard that A) He would even care that I posted since I wished him happy birthday in person and we already celebrated and B) He would call me out on it. 

I asked him if it really bothered him and he said that it was no big deal, but he wanted me to ""show him off."" I thought that was really odd because I have posted pictures of us on Instagram before, so it isn't like I was trying to keep him hidden from my friends and family. He kept saying it was no big deal, but  his texts would always follow a pattern like ""No I'm not bothered by it, but I was confused why you wouldn't do one for me since I've seen you post one before."" In other words, I felt like he kept accepting my apology, but then re-instigating the fight. It wasn't really a fight, moreso back and forth where I would apologize for hurting his feelings and then he would accept it but then restate why he was upset. So it really went nowhere. I was trying to make amends by apologizing and telling him I could still post a story or by explaining that birthday stories don't really mean all that much to me because I can barely remember to post them for even my close friends, but he just kept going. I spoke to a couple of my closest friends about this incident and they thought it was weird, too. We had only been dating for like 3 months at that point. 

The next time we met in person, he apologized. I think he could tell I was a little withdrawn and quite honestly, I just felt very weird. He texted me about the birthday story for an entire day, and that's just bananas. I was kind of thrown off, and I just felt a sinking feeling in my stomach about it. In hindsight, I think its because I knew that type of behavior was going to appear again, and boy was I right. 

About two weeks after his real birthday, I was invited to go out with him and his friends. He told me to invite a couple of my friends, too, and I did, but only one was able to make it. At first we were all going to go barhopping in town, but his friends decided to do a barcrawl in a sleepy suburb on a rainy Friday, and my friend and I were not feeling it. All his friends are married to each other (literally) so my friend and I felt a little left out. Both of those things made us want to go home early. I told him at around 10:30 (yeah... we started this at 8, and that was way too early for me and my friend, but his buddies wanted to get started early I guess) anyway—I told him at 10:30 that we wanted to go soon, and that he could stay out with his friends and then Uber back to mine, where I would be wating for him to let him in. He was going to sleep over at mine since he lived kind of far and his stuff was at mine anyway. My friend was staying in my spare room as well. He asked me and my friend if we could make it until midnight, and we said we would try. At this point in the night, he was really drunk and he was hanging out with his friends a lot. I don't have a problem with that at all—I knew going into this that he wanted to be with his friends, too. But that just left me and my friend alone, and I could tell that his friends took turns keeping us company before they ran off and rejoined their people. They were all talking in one big group about people I didn't know, or memories I had no part of, so it just didn't feel very inviting. Around 11:30 my friend begged me to call us an Uber, so I told my boyfriend at the time, and he said something along the lines of ""You're going to make me Uber to your house alone?"" and then just walked away from me and left me on the street with my friend. I texted him that I would stay up and wait for him, and to just have fun with his friends. He texted me ""Its fine, I don't know where I'll end up tonight,"" which is so childish because I literally told him I would stay up and wait for him no matter how late he stayed up. Not to mention he had at least 10 of his closest childhood friends there who had brought their own cars... its not like I left him in the middle of the woods, or even in a bad part of town. He was just in the 'burbs about 15 minutes from my house!! While he was still drunk, he texted me that he would never make me Uber alone. I just kind of laughed because I'm not really afraid of taking Ubers or taxis and I take them alone all the time. He finally told me that his friends were driving him to mine at like 1:30 after about an hour and a half of radio silence. Lowkey, I was going to just go to bed since the last thing I heard from him was ""I guess I don't know where I'm sleeping tonight"" and then nothing for almost 2 hours. I texted him a million times saying I was just in the living room and I'll be at the door when he needs me. 

He came back smelling like margaritas, which are the only things he drinks cause he doesn't like the taste of alcohol, and he smelled like that all night long and even in the morning. It kind of threw me off margs for a while. I went to grab some Mexican food with my family the other night, and when I smelled her marg I felt a little nauseated as it reminded me of sleeping next to that smell all night. I woke up around 9 because I was hungry and I just didn't want to lay around in bed all morning. When I wake up, I like to just get ready and dressed because I don't like to hang around in my PJs. This is context for later. I told him to sleep as long as he needed to and that I was hungry so I was going to go downstairs for breakfast and coffee. My friend was also up, so I wanted to get her fed as well while my boyfriend was asleep. 

About an hour later, he came downstairs with his bag packed and told me he was leaving. I walked him out and told him he didn't have to rush out and that he could've slept longer cause I know he was drunk when he got home last night. He just sort of grunted and got into his car and left. I didn't hear from him until way later that night. 

I talked to my friend who was there with me, and she said his thing about margaritas was weird and I agreed, because he doesnt even like the taste, but that is just the smallest cog in that horrorshow of a night. I think it was her way of hinting that him freaking out about us leaving early when I told him an hour in advance that we wanted to go home was strange to her. 

He called me the next day to talk about that night and the morning after. I think he needed time to reread our texts to each other from the night and think about it while sober. He seemed super apologetic but kept trying to blame me for abandoning him. He asked me why my friend couldn't just go back to my house my herself if she was tired, but I reminded him that asking my friend to come back to MY house ALONE with all the lights off and doors locked was not something that ever crossed my mind. I also reminded him that I wanted to go home too, and that I didn't abandon him by himself, I left him with his 10 closest childhood friends to all get drunk together to celebrate his birthday. He said that he thinks of us as a team, and that we need to have each other's backs. I think that's what a relationship should be, but honeslty, we had only been dating for real for about three months, and, honestly, with me and my friend feeling bored and isolated during an outing like that, I've gotta put her first. 

We called back and forth the rest of the week. He asked me when we could grab dinner and I said Thursday because I needed some space. For context, that was five days after Ubergate. I just didn't really want to see him and wanted to stay home and see if a little space would help me put this under the rug since I felt like we had talked all we could about it, but he literally would not leave me alone. He was always calling or texting me asking if I was SURE I was only free Thursday. One time he called me to ask why I hadn't sent him an Instagram reel all day. A girl can't be on Instragram for one day without being questioned? I felt pushed into a corner as I recognized that he wasn't actually listening to me, and he obviously thought that telling me how much he cared about me over and over again would fix things. 

Here's some more context about our relationship to this point: 

1. He called me babe A LOT. I didn't mind, but I definitely recognized how often he called me that. If he sent me a text, he managed to work the word ""babe"" into it at least twice.

2. He was very touchy and clingly. He was always holding my hand or cuddling me or kissing my head. this in and of itself is not an issue with me. I'm not against all PDA or affection, but there's a limit. I don't always want to be touched, and I would let him know sometimes if I felt overstimulated and just needed to not have a 180 pound man clinging to me at all times. One time, we went on a hike and he held my sweaty hand the ENTIRE time, which I thought was odd because it was super inconvenient. 

3. I would send him selfies sometimes if I felt pretty and I always loved his compliments. But by the last two or three weeks of our relationship, he would tell me that pictures I would send him ""gave him energy."" I have no idea what that means, but he kept saying it over and over during our post-Ubergate conversations. He sent me pictures of him sometimes, and he's handsome so I always loved them, but I did not feel energized by them in the slightest.

  
So, though I know I'm not entirely blameless in the Ubergate scandal or for how our relationship progressed, I just felt like I needed to get away from him. I broke things off that Thursday we were supposed to meet. I wanted to see if we could get past it, but when I asked him where he wanted to eet for dinner, he kept pushing me to come to his house. He told me he would drive the 45 minutes to my house to pick me up and then drop me back off if I didn't feel like driving (which I didn't). I asked him why it was so important, but he said he just wanted to be able to connect with me one on one and that we didnt have to ""do anything sexual."" I asked him why dinner at a restaurant wasn't a good place to connect and he said it just wasn't. He tried ALL WEEK to get me to his house. Honestly, I didn't want to go because I didn't want our reconnection after this big fight to be all alone in his basement bedroom. I also just didn't like how he kept pushing even when I said no, and this was after he had been ignoring my pleas for space all week, so I just felt very drained and over it. 

A few nights before we were going to meet up, he just texted me ""ETA 9:30"" and I thought he must have texted the wrong number, but then he asked ""Is that ok?"" NO it is not okay to just invite yourself over to someone's house at night. I was already in my PJs enjoying family movie night. He didn't ask first or anything, just sent me an ETA. I felt extra put off by that, and every time I thought about him I just felt bile rising to the top of my throat. I just felt super boxed in, and that he was just going to keep pushing to get what he wanted no matter what I said. 

I finally agreed to meet up with him briefly to talk it all out in person, but I had already decided I was going to break up with him. I didn't think that I would be able to look at him the same way since Ubergate and everything that went down since, and I was also able to connect his clinginess and lack of boundaries to other parts of out relationship that I didn't really notice until that point. He met me at my house and he brought me flowers. We talked in his car and I told him that we just have very different love languages and we're at different stages of our lives. I just tried to articulate the feelings I described in this post in the least insulting ways possible. I couldn't exactly call him clingy to his face. 

I talked about it with my mom, who said he was probably looking for someone to marry, and I just had so much on my plate that I'm nowhere near thinking about marriage yet. I'm still trying to get a job and spend time with my family. I honestly didn't think we were even together that long to talk about getting super serious like that, but he did tell me a few times that he thought we could ""go the distance."" I don't really know how he came to this conclusion because from March to early July, our relationship only lasted about 4ish months. 

This was my first real and consistent relationship, and I was kind of going in blind and definitely too fast in hindsight. I think I learned a lot about myself and what I'm looking for in a relationship. As of right now, I've cooled it with the apps. I'm kind of done dating for a while I think. I don't really know why I'm posting this here, but I guess Ubergate really made me question his actions and behaviors. Or maybe someone else will think this story is just as bizarre as my friends did. Even out Uber driver on the way back from his birthday barcrawl thought it was odd. Anyway, thanks for listening. I know this is a lot of text and a lot of details. ",1,1753130633.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

The piano is a 211 cm grand. It is sitting in a room which is roughly 4.5 x 4.7 meters, with pretty high vaulted ceiling (highest point is 4 meters, lowest about 3.2). In case it matters, the room has two large openings, one into a hallway (rectangular opening 2.0x2.4 meters), another one into a different room (rectangular 1.4x2.4).

Right now the piano is somewhat loud, but the biggest problem is A LOT of reverb. The room is, aside from the piano, currently empty, which of course makes things a lot worse.

Before going into specialised proofing, panels and the like (which I'd rather avoid for aesthetic reasons if possible) I'd like to see how much the furniture will help - for now that will be a 3+2 couch and a coffee table. I would also like to add a curtain in front of the window and would like suggestions on what is the best choice for that to reduce reverb.

Besides, what else could help? Is it the case that anything fabric will help and thicker = better? Do specific materials, fabric or otherwise, work better?",2,1753130548.0,soundproof,2,1.0,False

black opium - exactly what i’d anticipate a perfume to smell like. i can kiiiinda detect the coffee note, and it definitely dries down a nice vanilla on my skin after hours.

black opium le parfum - just like the regular black opium, very generic perfume smell for me but definitely more vanilla-y / watered down! i think i would wear these ones, but just a LITTLE bit. these perfumes are strong y’all!

yum boujee marshmallow 81 - defo smelled like marshmallow in the bottle, but on my skin it turned into the exact scent of sunscreen on your skin after rolling around under the sun on a sandy beach all day. not sure if i loved it! but i’d definitely try it again. not a bad scent, just very specific.

burberry her elixir - yeeeeoooooWWWW omg this stuff is STRONG. i was looking forward to this one a lot based on recommendations, but it was SO unbelievably candy sweet that it was headache inducing. like the taste of an extremely powerful slushee, one where you have to scrunch up your face after drinking it. so surprised by this one!

i also have purchased but have not yet worn / tried: not a perfume by juliette has a gun, flowerbomb by viktor&rolf, viva la juicy by juicy couture, and good girl by carolina herrera. that being said, in the bottle a lot of them smell near identical to black opium to me! but they’d probably smell differently on my skin.",1,1753130536.0,FemFragLab,3,0.67,False

After living with it for a few months, I wanted to share my honest thoughts on whether these trendy pieces are actually worth investing in.

First off, let's talk about what makes a coffee table ""fluted."" It's those vertical grooves carved into the surface, creating a rippled effect that adds visual interest and texture. The style actually dates back to ancient Greek and Roman architecture, but it's seeing a major revival in modern furniture design.

I spent weeks researching different options and styles before making my purchase. If you're also looking for fluted coffee tables, I found a great selection here: https://explorehomedeals.com/coffee-tables

The biggest pro of fluted furniture is how it elevates any room's aesthetic. The texture creates beautiful light and shadow play throughout the day. My living room instantly felt more sophisticated and intentionally designed. The vertical lines also make the space feel taller and more open.

However, there are some practical considerations. The grooves can collect dust and crumbs, making cleaning a bit more involved than with smooth surfaces. I've found using a soft brush attachment on my vacuum works well for regular maintenance.

Price is another factor to consider. Quality fluted pieces tend to cost more than traditional smooth coffee tables due to the additional craftsmanship involved. But in my experience, the visual impact makes it worth the investment if it fits your budget.

Some tips if you're considering buying one:
- Measure your space carefully
- Consider the material (wood, concrete, or resin all offer different looks)
- Think about maintenance requirements
- Match the style with your existing furniture

After living with my fluted coffee table, I can say it's more than just a trend. The textural element adds genuine value to my space's design. If you're interested in exploring options, I found this collection particularly helpful: https://explorehomedeals.com/coffee-tables

Bottom line: While fluted coffee tables require a bit more maintenance and investment, they're worth considering if you want to add architectural interest and sophistication to your living space. Just make sure to choose one that fits your lifestyle and maintenance preferences.

Remember that furniture trends come and go, but choosing pieces that genuinely speak to your style will always be in fashion. For me, my fluted coffee table has become a conversation starter and a piece I plan to keep long after the trend fades.",1,1753130381.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

>In Jon Kent: This Internship Is My Kryptonite by writer Sam Camp (Little Hollow Café) and artists Daimon Hampton and Seraji, Jon Kent is a super-powered hero in his own right, but how do those powers help him move beyond the mundane coffee orders, endless research, and “educational experience” the Daily Planet reporting staff deems necessary for those essential college credits? Especially when your mom is the editor-in-chief—hello, nepotism concerns!

>What’s more, his best friend thinks the internship is a waste of his time and talents, his boyfriend tries to be supportive but is wary of Jon’s new boss’s Superman obsession, and naturally his parents think this is a great opportunity, but life as a superhero daylighting as a reporter is a little different today than it was back then…

Hey there, fellow AiContentAutomators! 🚀 

Ever feel like you’re spinning your wheels, working hard but not getting anywhere? You’re not alone! We’ve all been there—going down rabbit holes or trying to master every social media platform out there. Honestly, does it make sense to do all that when there are more efficient ways to grow? 

Let’s cut to the chase. **Faceless growth strategies** are the secret sauce you’re missing out on! I mean, who wants to be the center of attention all the time anyway? 🤷‍♂️ 

So, how do you kickstart this faceless money-making magic? Here are some *snappy* strategies to keep in your toolkit:

1. **Automated Content Creation**: Use AI tools to churn out blog posts, social media content, and even emails while you sip your coffee. With platforms like [this helpful guide on content automation](https://whop.com/howtoai/?a=liveitupdeals), you can get quality content fast. *Goodbye, writer’s block!*

2. **Affiliate Marketing, The Sneaky Way**: Promote products without ever showing your face! Use social media, blogs, or even emails to drop those affiliate links. It’s like being a ghostwriter for...well, your income! 😜

3. **Community Building**: Create a community around your interests. Think Discord channels or Facebook groups where you don’t need to be a public figure to lead. Share value, engage with others, and *voilà*, your influence grows without the limelight.

4. **Repurposing Content**: Got a good video? Turn it into a blog post, tweet storm, or even a quick podcast episode. One piece of content can be transformed into countless formats without you having to put your face out there!

5. **Outsource It**: Not everything needs to be in-house. Whether it’s finding someone on Fiverr to do graphic design or a whole virtual assistant to handle your tasks, outsourcing is a game-changer. Imagine spending more time on strategy while someone else handles the nitty-gritty! 

Remember, the goal here is to work **smarter, not harder**. Time is money, my friends! You’ve got this, and the best part? You can start implementing these strategies today! 

Like I always say, ""If you're not leveraging the power of AI in your content strategy, you might as well be writing on cave walls!"" 

So, which of these strategies are you going to try first? Or maybe you’ve got your own faceless tactic to share? Let’s keep this conversation rolling! 💬✨",1,1753130270.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

Now I'm not sure this world is real.,"DISCLAIMER: I don’t suffer from any diagnosed mental illness. I don’t use drugs or alcohol. At the time of the events, I wasn’t under stress or emotional strain.

I’ve never told anyone this story. Maybe I was scared. Maybe I didn’t want to sound crazy. Not even my girlfriend knows.

It was just a regular Saturday in 2022. I woke up at 9 a.m., same as always. Got out of bed, kissed my girlfriend in the kitchen, took a shower, had breakfast.

On Saturdays, I like to spend my free time on the computer: gaming, random forums, Reddit, YouTube. Digital wandering.

That day, I stumbled upon a subreddit discussing the theory that reality is just a simulation. I smirked and left a few sarcastic comments.

Conspiracy theorists usually ignore replies. But this time, someone responded.

I don’t remember the username. Or what they had written. Just that it sounded ridiculous.

But they replied:

> ""What if I gave you concrete proof this isn’t just a conspiracy?""



I hesitated. Part of me thought it was a joke. But another part… was curious.

So I replied jokingly:

> ""Alright, take me down the rabbit hole.""



Not even ten seconds later, they replied:

> ""Check your email.""



My blood ran cold.

I never linked my email to Reddit. I use throwaway accounts. Fake names. No real info.

But when I opened my inbox, there was one unread message. No sender. Just the subject line:

> ""This is the first proof.""



Inside was a video file. An mp4, a few seconds long.

It showed my kitchen. That morning. Me entering, kissing my girlfriend, pouring coffee. Same shirt. Same everything.

But the camera angle — we didn’t have any device in that spot. It looked like it was filmed from inside the wall.

Like someone — or something — was watching me.

I ran to the kitchen. My girlfriend was there, casually scrolling TikTok. “Hey babe, you okay?” she asked.

I nodded. But I wasn’t.

I rushed back to my PC. The Reddit chat? Gone. Message deleted. Profile: nonexistent.

But the email was still there. And now there was a second one:

> “Still not convinced? Let’s continue.”



That’s when things got weird.

The lighting in the apartment felt… off. Too white. Too perfect.

I looked out the window. Nothing moved. No wind. No sound. Even the birds seemed frozen.

""Do you hear that silence?"" I asked.

She replied, with a flat tone:

> ""What silence? Everything is as it should be.""



She kept scrolling TikTok. Same video. Same sound. On loop.

I went to the bathroom. Splashed water on my face. Looked in the mirror…

My reflection was delayed. Just slightly. Like the mirror had to load me.

Back to the PC. Reddit was blank. A single pinned post. No title. Just an image:

A screenshot of my face — confused — in front of the bathroom mirror.

One comment below:

> “Second proof. Are you ready?”



And a link.

I hesitated. Then clicked.

Black screen. Red text:

> ""DO YOU CONSENT TO EXIT THE SIMULATED REALITY?""



Two options: [ YES ] — [ NO ]

I waited. Then clicked YES.

The screen went dark. The laptop shut down.

I felt a pull. Like fainting. Then… black.

I woke up.

Not in my bed.

In a metal chair. A dark room. No windows. But not pitch black. There was light — sort of — but no source.

In front of me: a mirror. At least, I think it was a mirror.

It replayed my morning. The shower. The coffee.

Then, writing appeared on the other side:

> ""That’s you... in the real world.""



I stood up. Knocked on the glass. Screamed. Nothing happened.

Then, the walls began to glitch. Code streamed across them. Lines, symbols. One word repeated in the chaos:

> “REBOOT.”



Then a countdown:

“REBOOT IN 60 SECONDS.”

I ran to the mirror. My reflection changed. For the first time, it looked at me. Spoke.

Mouth moved. No sound. But I read the lips:

> “You won’t wake up. Until you choose to.”



And everything shut down.

I woke up in bed. Sweating. Shaking.

My girlfriend called from the kitchen. She kissed me. It was 9 a.m. Saturday. Same as before.

I went to my PC. It was on. Email tab open.

New message. No sender. No timestamp. Just a single sentence:

> “Now do you believe?”



Since then, nothing’s felt real.

Sometimes, people around me repeat themselves. Same faces. Same lines. Like NPCs.

Sometimes, mirrors glitch. My reflection lags. Just a fraction of a second. Like it’s still buffering.

And I keep wondering:

Did I see the truth? Did I really leave the simulation?

Or was it just… a dream?

Small ocean towns in Spain, Portugal, France?","Hi there! I have this feeling of not finding peace and quiet at my hometown so I’ve decided to take myself on a 5-7 days retreat next to the ocean in August or September. I’ve spent two weeks researching where to go but I am not sure if they fit the criteria so I am here asking for advice. What I am looking for is a small safe city, next to the ocean either in Spain, Portugal or France. I don’t care about swimming that much, but the view of the ocean gives me great comfort and a way to reconnect. My itinerary for each day would be to go for an early run, stare at the ocean, read, cook food, drink a coffee, do some people watching and go out to eat dinner at a local restaurant. Since I love to cook one of my other criteria is that the place has a market with local produce that I could explore and try. I am really interested in history and culture as well, and in possibly going on a day trip or two somewhere near to my location (to hike, wine taste, etc.) but the plan is to not overcrowd my itinerary since the point of the whole trip would be to have a break from the busyness. In the past I’ve been on a Portugal roadtrip, but it was mainly the touristy areas with only short stays in each place. Also I’ve been to Bilbao and San Sebastian and fell in love with the Basque region, now I am looking for smaller towns. To northern France I’ve never been but it also looks very lovely. I will spend around 100-150€ on the airplane ticket, so it would be great if the town is accessible from public transport and near a major airport. The accommodation should also be under 60€ per day, so that I can spend more on restaurants and markets.

Does anyone have a place in mind that could serve this purpose? I was initially thinking Nazare, but there is not much to do. Maybe you know any place near Porto or Lisbon? Or the Cantabria region (Comillas, San Vicente) in Spain? I’ve never been to France but heard good things about Biarritz, but it might be too much.

Between applying and interviews, I have had a lot of time to sit and think. Turns out it has been a blessing in disguise.

For over a year, I have had my alarm set for 6:15 to get up and go to the gym before work. I woke up only to turn off my alarm and go back to sleep right up until my workday started at 8:00am. Tired...exhausted rather, I would drag myself out of bed to brew a cup of coffee and log on to my computer. I scrapped by until 5pm with little to no energy, only relying on bursts of anxiety about a deep sense of feeling ""ill-prepared"" for a meeting (x7 meetings a day). Now its time for dinner, because Im so tired I end up scrolling on my phone until I drag myself yet again to make a freezer dinner (pizza again? why not? beer? yeah that will take the edge off). I could sense myself slowly degrading, my body certainly felt the affects of it. Everyday the dishes in the sink piled higher. And each day's energy drain just compounded issues into the next day.

When I received the call that ""your position no longer exists at this company"" a part of my world was shattered. If I didnt have the structure of work around me, would I completely fall apart? Would I eat and drink myself all day long into oblivion? 

Well I did...for one day...but

...with the extra time, I found myself thinking ""why am I doing this? what benefit does this serve me?"" So I woke my butt up the next day, shook the dust off my gym shoes, and started to lift again. I was unprepared for the feeling after, I had MORE energy than if I hadn't gone to the gym at all. I used that energy to grocery shop and cook myself a fresh healthy meal. I gave the apartment a long overdue cleaning, my girlfriend came home feeling so much more relaxed in a clean home. I had the energy to communicate properly in my relationship instead of my habit of pushing everything off. We went on walks and talks together after she got off work. In the matter of a week I could feel my life completely changing. Ironically, even though I don't have work, I am getting up at 6:15 every morning to go to the gym! Its like everything I did, now gave energy back to myself three-fold. For the first time in years, I am feeling a sense of harmony between my body, my mind, and the relationships in my life.

When reflecting on all of this, I noticed that I had previously been creating a negative feedback loop in my life. I felt like I couldn't do anything to get the engine started...running on empty. But now, for the first time in a long time, I have created positive feedback loops in my life. AND IT IS INCREDIBLE. This got me to thinking about the importance of ""breaking the cycle"" of negative feedback loops in our lives. There are so many to name from even my own life. The other side of that coin is SO much better, the virtuous positive feedback loop and the sense of harmony are unmatched.

For me it took losing my job to learn this, but maybe it wont take something so dramatic for you. If my anecdote helped even just one person get ""unstuck"" that will have made my day",2,1753130044.0,getdisciplined,0,1.0,False

I recently moved back here after spending most of my life in Costa Rica. I’ve worked hard since I was 16 in many different jobs – my last one was as a sous-chef, but due to an injury and burnout, I had to stop.



Now, I’m trying to start something new and meaningful. I want to create a small project where I listen to people, offer advice, and build a supportive space for anyone who needs to talk without being judged. I call it Sinceramente.



Right now I live in a small house in the countryside, with limited resources but lots of motivation. I’m setting things up little by little — Ko-fi, Reddit, content creation — and I’d love to make this project something real that helps others and myself.

1m5u3xd,https://www.reddit.com/r/managers/comments/1m5u3xd/aita_for_not_telling_my_coworkers_that_i_was/,AITA for not telling my coworkers that I was promoted at work?,"I, female 25, have a master's degree in tourism and hospitality.
In Novemeber 2022 I started working in a 4* hotel as receptionnist.
In Novemeber 2023 I was promoted as an Assistant Front Office Manager.

In April 2024, Maria (placeholder name, female, 32 with a degree in law), applies for a position as a receptionnist after moving from another country.

We both became very close colegues (please remeber that at the time I am her superior since i am the front office assistant manager). We would go out for drinks, make coffee breaks at work together, go to Paris for shopping, and people at work considered us as a ""duo"". 

As an assistant manager I still have responsibilities to do, and I have a team to help manage. This situation started to create tensions between us when mistakes were made and I had no choice but to call her out with some things. Always in a polite way. Work is work, friendship is friendship, so I always tried to find this middle ground.

Maria is also very close friends with our banqueting manager, female 32 and let's call her Ana.

When Ana decided to unofficially announce she would resign from position in beggining of May 2025, the CEO approached me on that Friday to offer me the position, which I gladly accepted considering my background and loyalty with the company. However since Ana had not officially resigned, I preferred to keep it for myself until it became official, as we agreed with the Director (let's be honest, we were relieved she was leaving because she was such a mess and gossip type of girl).

The problem starts here : on that same Friday, I was leaving for a two week vacations to Greece. During that two week vacation, Ana officially resigned and told everyone that she was leaving PLUS that I was gonna take the position. I was on vacation, not aware that Maria, my receptionist colleague, was also interested on that position, and specially not aware that the resignation was now official.

I came back after the two weeks vacation, only to find out that Maria felt extremly betrayed by the fact that I did not tell her that the director had offered me the position. 

And that she would have liked to apply for it. But since she learned from someone else that I was the chosen one, she did not apply for it.

She and some other colleagues started harassing me because I supposedly took Maria's position, when in fact you can not jump from a receptionnist to a senior position without the proper training, or even without proving that you are able to do so.

Instead they started acting like kids because Maria ""deserved the position since she is dating the kitchen sous chef"", and that would encourage the sous chef to work better (he islazy af). 
What kind of argument even is this??

Maria is not even fit right now to replace me as the assistant manager, but for some reason they blame me for keeping everything a secret while on my two week vacations. As if it would have charged anything anyway???

Sooo,  thoughts?

About a year ago a little redness came into the gums between my two top from teeth at the bottom of the gums, and slowly over the year it crept upwards to form this bump that you see now. It is not painful, it does not bleed, it does not pus, sometimes it looks more swollen and deflates. Sometimes I delude myself into thinking it is improving or receding, but likely that is just my mind playing tricks on me.

I've seen my dentist twice for cleanings and she just said it should get better on its own, saying nothing shows on x-rays. But honestly I'm worried that it's been a whole year and growing and nothing improves it. I floas twice a day, being careful not to irritate this area much. Brush 2+ times (including after big meals) with a sonic toothbruth, and recently started gargling hydrogen peroxide. Nothing has seemed to help. And I'm wondering what it is, if there is anything I can do personally, and if I should see a peridontist, unfortunately I don't have dental insurance at the moment but do have access to antibiotics (though I'm not particularly convinced this is an abscess).

I (Toronto) have been texting a guy (Vancouver) for two months after matching on a dating app. We’ve had three video chats, and he’s been consistently responsive (we text daily, except for one weekend when he was hosting friends from abroad).

Before we matched, he’d already booked two trips to Toronto (July and August) to visit friends and attend concerts. A week before his July trip, we agreed to spend Saturday morning and Sunday afternoon together. We made specific plans: trying restaurants and watching a movie. I turned down other plans to accommodate this.

**The Meet-Up:**

**Saturday:** I picked him up at 6 AM after he got no sleep on the flight. We fooled around, napped, and I made him lunch (we woke up late). He had dinner plans with friends, but we stopped by a café where he bought me coffee and cake. We discussed the movie for Sunday but realized the showtimes would conflict with his dinner. He asked if we could skip it to just talk instead, which I agreed to, quality time seemed better.

**Sunday:** At 2 AM, he texted (while I was asleep) saying he was still out with friends. I woke up at 9 AM, assumed we wouldn’t meet, and went about my day (gym, meal prep). At 1 PM, he texted that he’d just woken up and wanted to meet. We hung out for a few hours (coffee, walking) before he left for his friends.

**Future Plans:**  
For his August trip, he’s bringing his best friend (who he hasn’t seen in years) and said he’s ""fully booked"" because his friend is spending $2K on flights. His friend lives abroad and is traveling 13hours via plane. However, since he arrives at 9 AM and his friend at 5 PM, we agreed to spend the full day together before his friend lands.

**Questions:**

1. **Am I being too accommodating?** I don’t expect him to drop plans for someone new, but I’m unsure if I’m being overly flexible.
2. **Does he seem interested?** He’s made effort (video chats, initiating cuddling/holding hands), but I worry I’m giving more than he is.
3. **Any advice?** We’ve discussed long-distance potential and dating goals (both want to settle down). He says he needs time to know someone before dating/intimacy and shows affection through cuddling (which we did a lot). He even mentioned being surprised we went further than cuddling since he “doesn’t usually do that.""

**\*\*\*Note**: The logical part of my brain thinks he's making an effort especially since this was our first time meeting in person. However, there is this weird voice in my head saying stuff like ""if he liked you, he'd spend more time with you or wouldn't have stayed out so late so he could see you earlier.""

It's called *The Dull Men*, a book about mugs left to soak, routines that never quite become habits, and the delicate dignity of watching condensation form on double glazing. Lawrence, the protagonist, joins a forum not unlike this one in hopes of... something. Not salvation exactly. Maybe consistency. His name is Lawrence Lawrence and no he doesn't want to talk about it.

You can find it on Amazon, in print or Kindle, and if you feel moved to read it, I'd be quietly and deeply grateful. Seven copies sold so far, which feels oddly perfect. Like a half-eaten pack of custard creams: enough to share, but not too many to suggest ambition.

Sunlight fell across my desk in a way that could only be read as accusatory. It suggested that 12:30 p.m. was no time to wake up and face the day. I felt differently. It fell squarely on a crusted-over teaspoon and the topmost book in the pile: The Power of Now, unread since October. It will stay that way. I picked it up once to swat a fly and put it back immediately. I’m not sure why I bought it. To my shame, the sunlight also illuminated scattered mugs where penicillin was happily blossoming. One day, I’ll clean them. It’s just not high on my list of priorities. Currently, it sits below setting fire to my own hair. I had, however, started to classify the mould varieties. The speckled ochre bloom on the Costa Coffee cup suggested last November’s damp. The velvety grey fuzz erupting from the National Trust commemorative mug likely dated back to that particularly bleak stretch post-Christmas, when I cemented my world-class ability to toss Maltesers into my mouth while lying down.

Time, like the dust, had settled over everything. I counted the particles up to a hundred, then gave up. A fruitless exercise. The books stood guard by the radiator in tottering piles. A depressed penguin peered up from the spine of an Orwell book I had abandoned on page 112 while simultaneously abandoning my proletariat phase. Socialism is for the politically active, not the active politician. I am neither. The complete works of Jung stood at a 23-degree angle, which I had discovered was precisely the tilt required to avoid creasing the spine. It had consumed 47 minutes of my Boxing Day. My attempts at self-betterment, fossilised in cellulose and cracked glue.

I sat, as I often did, in the centre of what could be called a living room but only if you worked for an estate agent. In the real world, it was a living room-cum-bedroom-cum-kitchen. I suppose it did suffice for someone who had managed to shrink their life into a single room. Here, a noble collection of half-read novels. Nearby, postcards from people enjoying life more convincingly than I ever had. And in one corner, a stack of marked essays, remnants of academic triumphs now as relevant as the remains of a buffet after a wedding.

Unopened envelopes littered the table: letters from the student loan company, the gym I’d quit attending three months into a year-long contract, a bank that kept offering me credit cards like I had an acceptable credit score. The room had a logic to it, in its way. Everything left where it fell, so nothing ever moved. The futon served as bed and sofa; the rickety table propped up by a folded bit of cardboard I’d become oddly attached to. The unyielding wooden chair held laundry more often than it held me. Like most things here, it had long since become more burdened than used.

At night, the postcard shifted. Not literally, of course, but the Cornish coastline on its front seemed to migrate behind the key bowl, nudged by nothing but the passage of time and some trick of tired perception. I’ve not been back since. It’s unlikely I will again. Not since the funeral. Not since the silence afterwards proved harder to outrun than the event itself.

The radiator coughed. It sounded like it was dying in stages, loudly and at inconvenient hours. If it were a person, you’d call someone. But I just listened. I’d come to recognise its vocabulary and syntax. The sharp clang at 3:17 in the morning meant an incoming struggle, and the midday hiss signalled creeping agoraphobia. We'd developed an understanding, that radiator and I. It withheld heat; I withheld cleaning.

The kettle sat cold and waiting. I filled it to the usual level, watching the water slosh against the metal sides before setting it back on its base and flicking the switch. The familiar click-click-hum filled the air as it began to heat. I counted silently in my head and waited. The kettle’s second click arrived with papal infallibility. I measured my existence in these intervals. The 122 seconds between switch flick and salvation, each millisecond variance logged in the craters of my brain. I could recite the steps like liturgy. First, I waited for the second click. Never the first, which was little more than a plaintive whine of half-hearted commitment. Two heaped teaspoons of ASDA Smart Price instant followed (2021 batch; the 2023 formulation lacked the gravelly texture), then precisely 237ml of water, measured through an old NHS measuring cup that still had remnants of sticker glue on the side. Stirring came last, exactly fourteen times clockwise. Widdershins, I’d discovered, provoked mild arrhythmia.

The ritual crystallised during that terrible fortnight after graduation when time melted into a viscous pool. I'd discovered the superiority of clockwise during The Great Stirring Schism of '22 which was a 37-hour caffeine bender testing spiral versus concentric methods. The data proved incontrovertible: clockwise dissolution prevented dreaded powder archipelagos. But today, something was off. 124 seconds. Two seconds too long. That couldn’t stand. The routine must not be interrupted. It must never be interrupted.

Four steps to the bathroom. Not three. Not five. My feet traced each fissure in the floor, memorised through repetition. Clear the rug island, IKEA 2023. Navigate the Book Sinai while staring menacingly at Proust vol.2, a vain attempt to scare it into submission. Avoid the Death Tile, loosened by last week’s Mug Incident. A new step, but fast becoming a favourite. Finally, palm the doorframe, skimming the chip at 172cm, a relic of the ill-advised dartboard phase. Toothbrush, toothpaste, the ritual scrubbing. Rinse, spit, wipe. Face splashed with water just shy of freezing, the shock of it chasing away any lingering fuzziness. Towel, patted dry, folded and replaced on the rack with militant precision.

The pens awaited inspection on return. Three pens lay in perfect parallel, equidistant from each other. Blue, black, red. Lined up like soldiers awaiting orders. I couldn't remember the last time I'd actually used them for anything more than this morning ceremony, but still, I straightened them each day, taking a strange solace in the small act of control. The blue pen had roughly 87% ink remaining. A newer purchase. Reliable. Will need to use it more so it doesn’t feel left out. The black was at 62%, a workhorse of a pen. The red was at 34%, used for highlighting amounts left on student loans and overdraft fees.

The flat was quiet, as it ever was. Outside, the distant hum of traffic ebbed and flowed like a half-heard conversation, punctuated occasionally by the bark of a dog or the slam of a car door. Inside, the silence was broken only by the soft creaks of the old building settling into itself, the aged joists and beams sighing like weary bones. The radiator cleared its throat, a bronchial rattle that meant “You’ve lingered too long.” I adjusted red pen by 3° west. The world held its breath. Nothing changed.

The evenings were when the restlessness set in. As the sun dipped below the horizon and the shadows stretched across the floor like spilled ink, I would find myself gravitating towards the cold glow of my laptop screen, as if I were a moth with administrative tasks. This, too, had become a routine: endless scrolling through news sites, job listings, social media feeds that served only to reinforce a sense of distance from the world and its events. I opened too many tabs, closed them with no more certainty than when I had opened them, and repeated the cycle with the kind of resigned persistence one might reserve for the washing-up or the bins. Tonight the tabs metastasised in digital mitosis. There were fourteen job portals which all required passion for innovation and Excel proficiency. Seven tabs with abandoned baskets. I could not decide on a new kettle. I had paused at the payment page at John Lewis. Such big decisions needed more time. Niche forums dedicated to topics I had no real interest in - vintage typewriter maintenance, the mating habits of obscure beetle species, conspiracy theories about the origins of the Oxford comma. And always, the Wikipedia rabbit holes. A stray thought would snag on a word or a phrase, and before I knew it, I would be seven pages deep into the history of lighthouse construction, or the biography of some minor 18th century aristocrat, my brain stuffed with facts I would never have cause to use. One job description I had kept open required five years’ experience in medieval codicology, to be fluent in Latin, Old English, and Excel, and demanded that I could thrive in fast paced environments. Of course I could, the morning kettle ritual was the peak of fast paced. The salary was £21,000 with no London weighting (not applicable).

I composed treatises that would go nowhere. The 14,000 words in my Eddystone Lighthouse document were desperate to be added to. I checked the references were in the required format (Harvard style). They were. The middle 2,000 words were possibly superfluous, but I couldn’t bear to delete them. They had tried. The bibliography was a masterpiece. It included 18th century tide charts and a 2003 GeoCities page. This could be my finest work yet. I saved it into the swelling lighthouse folder on my desktop.

Time slipped with an insidiousness that comes from staring at a digital clock, each minute a testament to time passing but not progressing. I attempted to impose a kind of logic upon my browsing, alternating between productivity and distraction, but found it difficult to discern where one ended and the other began. The laptop fan whined like a distant train but one that was in pain. It was dying. Like everything else. The screen began to burn afterimages into my retinas. Phantom menus floated across the pizza box fossilising on the carpet. Somewhere beneath the takeaway debris lay my notebook, its last entry three weeks old and concerning entirely on failed job interviews. A list that expanded exponentially.

By 9:37pm I'd developed a system. Each browser tab represented a possible future self-glimmering in the digital murk. Here, the me who finally replied to LinkedIn connections (""Congratulations on your promotion, though I can't for the life of me recall your face""). There, the me engrossed in a 114-page thesis comparing Victorian streetlamp designs to circadian rhythms. That particular PDF had cost me £8.50 through an academic portal, charged to a credit card I might not even own anymore. Suddenly, Dr. Ellsworth’s voice intruded: “Your methodology is admirably rigorous, but one wonders if categorising every 19th-century cab driver in Leeds isn't rather... circumscribed?” I nearly spilled Asda coffee granules onto yesterday’s socks.

I had started off researching the history of the ballpoint pen - a noble endeavour, to be sure - but had somehow ended up on a page dedicated to vintage chewing gum wrappers, my cursor hovering over an embedded link titled ""The Peculiar Appeal of the Mundane."" One click, and I was tumbling down yet another rabbit hole. This one led to a forum, buried deep within the forgotten recesses of the internet. ""The Dull Men of Great Britain,"" the header proclaimed in a font that looked like it hadn't been updated since the days of dial-up modems and AOL chat rooms.

At first glance, the layout was almost charmingly retro, all clunky graphics and rudimentary HTML. The threads, displayed in a simple list format, bore titles that seemed to compete for the crown of most banal. ""The Repainting of Grit Bins - Spring 2022 Edition,"" one announced, alongside a blurry photograph of what appeared to be a small yellow container on a street corner. ""UK's Roundabout of the Year,"" another declared, accompanied by a dizzying collage of aerial shots depicting various circular intersections. ""Traffic Cone Spotting: Norfolk vs. Lincolnshire,"" a third enthused, the header adorned with a clip-art illustration of a stylised orange cone.

My laugh came out as more of a nasal exhale, fogging the screen. The forum threads read like a particularly sedate Radio 4 schedule:

""Best Practices for Bus Shelter Mural Preservation (vandalism considerations)""

""Show Us Your Sponsored Roundabout Flowerbed!""

""Official 2022 Benchmarking of Public Toilet Hand Dryer Decibel Levels""

Some people had too much time on their hands.

I clicked ""View More"" with the clinical detachment of a sociologist studying cults. The usernames alone were a study in absurdity: ConeZone94, BinManBarry, RoundaboutRick. One prolific poster, the self-styled ""EggManEd,"" documented the daily temperature decay of boiled eggs left to languish on his windowsill, complete with meticulously annotated graphs and charts. I bookmarked the egg chart. For research, obviously.

To my surprise, or perhaps enjoyment, there was more. User BinManBarry opened with: ""Re: Spring 2022 Grit Bin Rollout - The Durham contingent continues with Dulux Weathershield 'Hedge Maze' (BS4800:00A09). Lincolnshire's switch to 'Parsley Butter' must be CONTESTED."" Seven replies followed, including attachments from the Highways Agency handbook. My mouse hovered over the ""Join Discussion"" button. The radiator gurgled its disapproval.

By 1:46am, I'd mapped members by avatar. Rotary clotheslines dominated the over-sixties contingent. Younger posters favoured council logo watermarks. A thread titled ""Optimal Leaf Collection Cadence - Experience from Bracknell"" contained shockingly elegant diagrams. When I found myself nodding along to a debate about heritage lamppost restoration grants, the realisation hit with the force of a misjudged speed bump - these weren't eccentrics. These were professionals. The street outside echoed with Friday night stragglers. Their laughter sliced through the double glazing as I studied a photo essay on concrete bollard weathering patterns. Someone had captioned a moss-flecked specimen outside Bury St Edmunds Sainsbury's: ""Fig. 1 - Splendid patina development since 2018 relocations"". My toes curled in their M&S socks. Whether in horror or admiration, I couldn't say.

At 2:03 a.m., I discovered the 'Projects' subforum. Sixteen pages documented a member's quest to catalogue every Tesco car park gradient in Yorkshire. Scrolling became hypnosis - each post a perfectly squared-off brick in some vast municipal edifice of tedium. When the bathroom pipes shuddered awake I startled like a teenager caught with a naughty website open, slamming the laptop shut. The afterglow of the screen lingered in geometric patterns behind my eyelids. Forum headings burned into my optic nerves like canal boat registry numbers.

I re-opened the laptop and my finger hovered over the trackpad. I knew I should close the tab, return to aimless scrolling and my quest for distraction. But instead, almost without thinking, I found myself clicking on the ""New User Registration"" button, a strange sense of anticipation fluttering in my chest. Perhaps, I thought, as I began to fill in the requisite fields, there was something to be learned from the dull men and their quiet enthusiasms. Perhaps, in the grand scheme of things, there was a certain nobility to be found in the embrace of the unremarkable, the celebration of the mundane.

Or perhaps I was just tired, my judgment clouded by the late hour and the endless blue light of the screen. Either way, as I typed out my new username - ""PenMan87,"" a nod to newish blue pen- I couldn't help but feel a small thrill of something that might have been belonging, or at least the tentative promise of it.

 

**Two**

It was the sixth consecutive night of browsing The Dull Men forum and the eggs were confessing their secrets. User TempTracker91 had mounted a kitchen thermometer to his windowsill using Blu-Tack and what appeared to be a hairpin. His daily posts charted temperature decay curves of boiled Hen Crown eggs with the solemnity of a coroner’s report. “Day 43: Midges alighting on Sample B may have skewed results. Commencing replicate trials.” I watched condensation bead on my own neglected mug as the forum's minutiae colonised my vision. I still needed a new kettle. I was never much of a fan of poetry, but I suspected I would nominate BinManBarry as Poet Laureate. “Weybridge Sainsbury’s: 3 x 120L EuroCubs, lid alignment 87° from true north.” Each entry timestamped with the exactitude of a naval log.

However, Barry of bin fame was outdone by the ConeZone94 manifesto. Running to twenty-seven meticulous pages, he had photographed every traffic cone along the A217 between 2016–2024, charting their “migrations” during roadworks. Close-ups captured moss growth on PVC surfaces. The comment section brimmed with pensioners arguing over HGV airflow effects on cone placement. At 3:17 a.m., I found myself Googling 'cone anchoring protocols,' a cold chip congealing on the plate beside me. The basil plant on my windowsill drooped in judgemental silence. Three weeks prior, I’d killed a succulent by overwatering during a particularly dire job application spree. I’d once tried to name the basil plant, thinking it might live longer if someone were rooting for it. But it didn’t. Nothing does.

On the seventh night, it was the post about watering plants at 7:14 that finally did me in. Not 7:10, not 7:15, but precisely 7:14. I first noticed it when a sidebar blinked: “Gerald67East has posted in Cultivating order”. The thumbnail showed a fern frond dusted with what might have been fertiliser or ash. My cursor hovered; it wanted to explore the Dorset vs Wiltshire hedge-trimming battle instead. But something about Gerald67East needed further examination.

In painstaking detail, he described the careful arrangement of his plant-watering schedule: a morning ritual conducted with the exactitude of a military manoeuvre. 7:14, every morning, without fail, each plant receiving its measured allotment of water. My microwave clock read 19:17. I pressed a thumb against the smudged screen as if late-century Braille might explain why this man’s begonias demanded military timing. Seven readings later, patterns emerged. Gerald used ""terracotta unit"" instead of ""pot."" Referenced rainfall probabilities only to dismiss them. The plants themselves were reduced to variables - ""Subject C (fern, Boston) shows 12% increased frond rigidity post-calcium nitrate supplement."" Yet beneath the clinical detachment lay something queasily human: the insistence on 7:14 sharp, a timestamp that bled through the screen like tea through biscuit crumbs.

He wrote of the ritual with a reverence that bordered on the spiritual, describing the way the plants seemed to perk up at his approach, their leaves rustling in anticipation of the life-giving liquid. He spoke of the satisfaction he found in the consistency, the way the simple act of tending to his botanical charges brought a sense of order to his days.

I clicked through to his profile, hoping for some clue, some breadcrumb trail that might lead me to the heart of the mystery. But there was little to be found: just a location (Eastbourne) and a profile picture featuring a particularly lush potted fern. No personal details, no hints at the life behind the carefully scheduled waterings.

I felt a flicker of frustration as I navigated back to the post. It seemed unfair, somehow, that Gerald could dangle such an enigma and then withhold the key to its solution. I wanted to know the man behind the ritual, to understand the private meaning behind the public display of horticultural devotion.

By Thursday, my basil developed root rot. Gerald’s profile still offered nothing but a fern photo. The shadow angle suggested 3pm sunlight in late March. Eastbourne’s weather records showed partial clouds that day. At 19:14 on Sunday, I stood barefoot in a puddle of spilled water, chanting Bing! Bong! along with the BBC News theme wafting from the television. I found myself posting comments on the thread, tentative at first, then with growing boldness. ""Fascinating routine, Gerald,"" I wrote, my fingers hesitating over the keys. "" I'm curious, why 7:14 specifically? Does that time hold a special meaning for you?"" His reply arrived as I scraped mould off a plate I found under the futon. How long had it been there? I ceased to measure days, just Gerald’s posts. ""It just felt right."" The words hung like a challenge written in steam. I took my temperature, 36.2°C, perfectly average, then googled Eastbourne dementia rates. The basil watched from its swamp, quietly aghast at what we’d become. My kettle chose that moment to whistle the opening bars of ""Greensleeves.""

By Tuesday, I'd graduated to auditing Gerald's comment history using colour-coded highlighters. Each interaction revealed terrifying competence- advice on pruning shears tempered with caveats about seasonal sap viscosity. His refusal to engage with my ""Why 7:14?"" queries felt like finding margin notes in a library book only to discover they're just overdue stamps. My basil plant was not faring any better. I saluted the dripping windowsill with a measuring jug, half-expecting a blue plaque to materialise: ""Here stood a man who once almost watered correctly.""

Late into the night, I returned to the post with the relentlessness of a dog with a bone. 7:14, it taunted, with each tick of the clock. Not 7:15, not 7:10. I began to laugh at my own absurdity, aware of the irony but unable to resist. The only thing more ridiculous than Gerald's devotion to his routine was my own fixation on it. I conceded that Gerald had ensnared me. I was as captive to his obsession as he was to the tiny increments of time that defined him. It was, I thought, with a mix of amusement and a trace of envy, the dullest and most brilliant trap I had ever seen.

In a fit of both curiosity and resignation, I attempted to engage directly with Gerald again. ""Have you ever experimented with other times?"" I asked, like an aspiring scientist hoping for a breakthrough. Gerald’s response, as precise as it was uninformative, left me both amused and unsatisfied. ""I find this time suits best."" He signed each message with ""G,"" as if an initial lent gravitas to his reluctance to elaborate. I was undeterred. ""Would love to know why 7:14 works so well for you!"" I prodded, hoping a dash of exclamation might elicit a fuller reply. His answer came swiftly: ""I see no reason to change it."" This both infuriated and intrigued me. What kind of man guards the secrets of his plants so closely? Gerald, it seemed, had perfected the art of strategic vagueness. A sort of horticultural sphinx, doling out riddles instead of instructions. I considered, briefly, the possibility that Gerald was simply messing with me. That the sacred 7:14 was arbitrary, chosen not by data or instinct, but whim. But no, there was too much intention behind it all. I doubted Gerald, or G, would use the forum for his own sick games. My fixation grew. In another thread, he shared his enthusiasm for optimal weather conditions: ""East winds are favourable."" It was, I began to realise, more than a hobby. It was a way of life, one that he narrated with a passion so detailed it was almost mathematical. It was as if I had become a student at the Gerald School of Dullness, eagerly lapping up lessons in the art of being.

I started to research Eastbourne, the home of this mystery man who could condense the universe into increments of time and habit. The more I delved, the more I pictured a small town with a row of identical semi-detached houses, each containing its own Gerald clone, each timing their obsessions down to the last specific second. It was a vision that both amused and thrilled me. It was a strange sort of intimacy, this imagined understanding of a life I'd never witnessed. And yet, I couldn't shake the feeling that Eastbourne held the key to the mystery, that if I could just walk those streets, breathe that air, I might somehow find my way to the heart of the 7:14 enigma.

 

**Three**

Late one night, as the glow of my laptop cast the flat in an eerie half-light, I found myself drafting a message to Gerald. ""I've been thinking about your watering routine,"" I wrote, my fingers hesitating over the keys. ""The precision of it, the devotion. It's really struck a chord with me. Would you be open to meeting up sometime? I'd love to see your setup in person, maybe compare notes on plant care.""

I stared at the words, feeling a flutter of trepidation in my chest. It was a bold move, I knew, an overture that could easily be seen as intrusive, even creepy. I tried to imagine how I might feel, receiving such a message from a faceless stranger on the internet.

And yet, I couldn't bring myself to delete the words. There was something about the prospect of meeting Gerald, of standing face to face with the man whose simple ritual had come to mean so much to me, that felt almost inevitable. As if the universe itself was conspiring to bring us together, two solitary souls connected by a shared fascination with the mundane.

I took a deep breath, feeling the air catch in my lungs. My finger hovered over the ""Send"" button, trembling slightly.

This was madness, I knew. A flight of fancy born of too many sleepless nights and too much time spent staring at a glowing screen. And yet, I could feel the pull of it, the siren song of an adventure waiting to unfold.

I hit ""Send,"" and the message disappeared into the ether, a digital bottle cast out onto an uncertain sea.

The new basil plant, Basil II, sat on the windowsill, its leaves rustling softly in the breeze from the cracked window, unaware of the fate that befell its predecessor. I looked at it, feeling a sudden rush of affection for this small, green companion that would bear witness to my strange obsession.

""Wish me luck,"" I whispered, feeling slightly foolish.

The plant, ever stoic, kept its own counsel. But as I turned back to the glowing screen, the thrill of anticipation thrumming through my veins, I could have sworn I saw its leaves dip slightly, as if in a secret nod of encouragement.

At 1:54am cycling routes made themselves known. Google suggested 5 hours 43 minutes from London to Eastbourne via the A24. The elevation chart resembled a cardiogram flatlining near Crawley. My rucksack, last used for a catastrophic Glastonbury trip, still harboured a 2019 train ticket stub in its meshy entrails. I began compiling supplies with the focus of a polar expedition: blister plasters, a windbreaker advertising ""Dave's Bait & Tackle,"" and the laminated A-Z where Cornwall had been torn out.

Gerald's reply arrived as I debated whether biodegradable toilet paper constituted hubris. ""Mr. East regrets he is unable to accommodate visitors at this time."" The response bore the sterile politeness of a parking fine appeal rejection. Yet there, nestled between the lines like a weed in pavement cracks - he hadn't said no to meeting. Just ""at this time."" I could not give up.

The cursor pulsed like a failing lighthouse as I deleted ""kind regards"" for the eighth time. My message to Gerald now read like a hostage note composed by a particularly nervous librarian. Outside, rain smeared the streetlights into something resembling tears.

Version 4.2 began: ""Dear Mr. East, I'm researching modern rituals and wonder if you might spare 14 minutes..."" Too anthropological. Version 6.7 flirted with casual deceit: ""Fellow plant enthusiast here!"" The basil sneered audibly. By midnight, the draft had shed all pretence: ""I water things too, though badly. Tell me why 7:14 or I'll cycle to Sussex and lurk outside your begonias.""

The send button dissolved my bravado. I cleaned the keyboard with a sock, extracting three weeks' worth of crisp fragments and a hair that might have been the first sign of stress induced male pattern baldness. The fridge light exposed my reflection as a nocturnal creature - pupils dilated from forum blue light, t-shirt stained with proof-of-concept band merchandise.

His reply arrived during a catastrophic spaghetti hoops incident. The microwave clock blinked as I parsed his response: ""I shall await your arrival. 79 Sycamore Road. Two days hence."" No smiley face. No query about my planned route or protein bar preferences.

In the early morning, hunting plasters for a paper cut injury, I found Mum's unopened ""Career Crossroads!"" card beneath the sink. The bike leaned against the fridge, its odometer still reading 2.3 miles from the Sainsbury's debacle. Rain blurred the window as I pressed play on a ""South Downs Cycling Hazards"" YouTube series. Somewhere in Eastbourne, a man lifted his watering can precisely as the BBC news theme faded. The journey ahead terrified me. Not the hills nor the traffic, but the moment when 7:14 simply became a minute like any other - and I'd have to stop counting.

Now I'm not sure this world is real.,"DISCLAIMER: I don’t suffer from any diagnosed mental illness. I don’t use drugs or alcohol. At the time of the events, I wasn’t under stress or emotional strain.

I’ve never told anyone this story. Maybe I was scared. Maybe I didn’t want to sound crazy. Not even my girlfriend knows.

It was just a regular Saturday in 2022. I woke up at 9 a.m., same as always. Got out of bed, kissed my girlfriend in the kitchen, took a shower, had breakfast.

On Saturdays, I like to spend my free time on the computer: gaming, random forums, Reddit, YouTube. Digital wandering.

That day, I stumbled upon a subreddit discussing the theory that reality is just a simulation. I smirked and left a few sarcastic comments.

Conspiracy theorists usually ignore replies. But this time, someone responded.

I don’t remember the username. Or what they had written. Just that it sounded ridiculous.

But they replied:

> ""What if I gave you concrete proof this isn’t just a conspiracy?""



I hesitated. Part of me thought it was a joke. But another part… was curious.

So I replied jokingly:

> ""Alright, take me down the rabbit hole.""



Not even ten seconds later, they replied:

> ""Check your email.""



My blood ran cold.

I never linked my email to Reddit. I use throwaway accounts. Fake names. No real info.

But when I opened my inbox, there was one unread message. No sender. Just the subject line:

> ""This is the first proof.""



Inside was a video file. An mp4, a few seconds long.

It showed my kitchen. That morning. Me entering, kissing my girlfriend, pouring coffee. Same shirt. Same everything.

But the camera angle — we didn’t have any device in that spot. It looked like it was filmed from inside the wall.

Like someone — or something — was watching me.

I ran to the kitchen. My girlfriend was there, casually scrolling TikTok. “Hey babe, you okay?” she asked.

I nodded. But I wasn’t.

I rushed back to my PC. The Reddit chat? Gone. Message deleted. Profile: nonexistent.

But the email was still there. And now there was a second one:

> “Still not convinced? Let’s continue.”



That’s when things got weird.

The lighting in the apartment felt… off. Too white. Too perfect.

I looked out the window. Nothing moved. No wind. No sound. Even the birds seemed frozen.

""Do you hear that silence?"" I asked.

She replied, with a flat tone:

> ""What silence? Everything is as it should be.""



She kept scrolling TikTok. Same video. Same sound. On loop.

I went to the bathroom. Splashed water on my face. Looked in the mirror…

My reflection was delayed. Just slightly. Like the mirror had to load me.

Back to the PC. Reddit was blank. A single pinned post. No title. Just an image:

A screenshot of my face — confused — in front of the bathroom mirror.

One comment below:

> “Second proof. Are you ready?”



And a link.

I hesitated. Then clicked.

Black screen. Red text:

> ""DO YOU CONSENT TO EXIT THE SIMULATED REALITY?""



Two options: [ YES ] — [ NO ]

I waited. Then clicked YES.

The screen went dark. The laptop shut down.

I felt a pull. Like fainting. Then… black.

I woke up.

Not in my bed.

In a metal chair. A dark room. No windows. But not pitch black. There was light — sort of — but no source.

In front of me: a mirror. At least, I think it was a mirror.

It replayed my morning. The shower. The coffee.

Then, writing appeared on the other side:

> ""That’s you... in the real world.""



I stood up. Knocked on the glass. Screamed. Nothing happened.

Then, the walls began to glitch. Code streamed across them. Lines, symbols. One word repeated in the chaos:

> “REBOOT.”



Then a countdown:

“REBOOT IN 60 SECONDS.”

I ran to the mirror. My reflection changed. For the first time, it looked at me. Spoke.

Mouth moved. No sound. But I read the lips:

> “You won’t wake up. Until you choose to.”



And everything shut down.

I woke up in bed. Sweating. Shaking.

My girlfriend called from the kitchen. She kissed me. It was 9 a.m. Saturday. Same as before.

I went to my PC. It was on. Email tab open.

New message. No sender. No timestamp. Just a single sentence:

> “Now do you believe?”



Since then, nothing’s felt real.

Sometimes, people around me repeat themselves. Same faces. Same lines. Like NPCs.

Sometimes, mirrors glitch. My reflection lags. Just a fraction of a second. Like it’s still buffering.

And I keep wondering:

Did I see the truth? Did I really leave the simulation?

Or was it just… a dream?

I don’t know what I saw. But I know this:

1m5tt8j,https://i.redd.it/k615zl38daef1.jpeg,"Cafe Manager fired, cafe closes a month later? YOU DONT SAY.","Earlier this year, I took a cafe manager position for a very unique set-up. It was a non-profit café that exclusively hired young adults who've aged out of the foster care system. I did not come from that system myself, although because of such an awful upbringing, I thought I could do some good in this world by being a mentor to those without parents, all while revamping the cafe menu with a lot of new cool updates. My second interview, I was asked to make a presentation on 1 of 4 topics, and instead did it on all 4, all under the umbrella of ""How do we make breakfast exciting again?"". I was told the breakfast revamp was important as everyone hated what they were doing. 

Month 1 included realizing I had taken on a monstrous task as the place was in SHAMBLES. I'd never seen a walk-in where the walls and ceiling were COVERED in mold. The shelving was all moldy. There were 2 cases of rotting apples purchased in October (I was hired in February). Expired products everywhere. 

My first day, I showed up at 5am to assist with a catering order and meet ""the team"" who turned out to be one very hung-over woman who begged to go home, did zero work, and had a cab paid for her to go home around 6am. I spent a week scrubbing every inch of the place, getting new supplies, etc. The ""director of ops"" and ""program manager"" were admittedly ""Not food people"" they'd say, and had no idea the place was in that condition despite showing up a few times a week at least. 

Piles of garbage with product underneath, equipment that no one could tell me when it was maintained last, boxes and boxes and boxes of overpriced ""merch"" covered in dust....it was quite something. 

I met the rest of the ""team"" which consisted of one guy who avrually had food experience, and one guy who 'claimed' to have food experience but would have a nervous breakdown at the sign of any criticism, let alone the issues of working like 7 hurricanes rolled into one (makes a mess everywhere, could not work clean whatsoever). The idea of an AGM was dangled in front of me for a month before they had what they called a ""consultant"" tell me they didnt have the money for it (turns out she was the founder of the business, but far removed from the day-to-day aspect). I found out the AGM they had in mind initially was a former shift manager who quit when they hired me because she wanted to position herself. Knowing that, I would have never expected her to come back for a lesser position to work under what was essentially an outsider. 

Month 2, we finally hired 3 more people for a total of 6. Of these 3, one was a hot-head who cursed out other staff at least once a week until he verbally threatened me, went non-verbal, and left. Another was a literal flat-earther who claimed ""NASA isn't real"". The 3rd, despite having a GREAT attitude, was completely not suited for the job. Id often have to remind him to PUT ON GLOVES when handling food amongst other things. 

I spent most of month 2 designing the new menu, spackling and repainting holes and cracks in the wall, weeding the backyard with my own garden tools, setting up exterminators, arranging actual equipment maintenance ($17,000 espresso machine caked in calcium, wouldn't drain, etc), and trying my damnest to establish a genuine connection with the staff, despite them just not giving a shit about my direction. They'd literally spend any moment not dealing with a customer laying on a couch, playing video games, smoking outside, taking extended breaks, all while I did practically everything in the cafe from working the line to scrubbing toilets. 

During my first 2 weeks, when I noticed the poor work ethic, I called everyone out on their shit with photo evidence and said this could not stand going forward. That's when I found out that the director of ops admitted that the staff had been coddled and not set up for working on the real world; the complete opposite of what the entire cafe and program was set up for. I was asked to apologize to the staff for calling them out for being generally awful, and I believe I found a good way to not only apologize for sounding ""harsh"", but also establish that this isn't how any cafe should operate. 

In this second month, I took on their ""inventory"" and realized their spreadsheet they gave to their accountants every month was, at best, half accurate in numbers. For example, I'd put '10' in a field for quantity of a flavored syrup, and it would calculate that to $0.15....HALF the inventory was like this. I brought it up to the accountant and director, and they basically shrugged, saying ""Well, you'll just have to do your best"".

I fought with the staff for 3 months, and eventually, the one good guy I had on staff just stopped giving a shit. He knew we were trying to promote him, but he was not studying for his servsafe, and literally told me at one point ""I dont really give a shit about this place. It's been open for 10 years, doesn't matter what any of us do, it'll stay open because of donations and grants"".

You could imagine after working open to close all but one day a week, I started feeling like I was driving a car head together with rubber bands. 

On a personal note, my mother-in-law was on her last legs fighting cancer, and I was dedicating almost all my time outside the cafe to being a good partner to my wife as well as taking long drives to visit her mom. The whole place was aware of this, and yet, too many times I was asked to just forgo any of my responsibilities outside of work to run the cafe whenever people would call out, which I calculated to be an entire 1/3 of all shifts. I also calculated they were late to more than half their shifts by at LEAST an hour.  Whenever this would happen on my day off, they would be fine with closing the store early or just not opening. 

I came in on a Tuesday after having a day off and saw that nothing I asked for to be done was done the day prior, the place was filthy, no prep was done (and in fact was re-written for me to do). Inventory was due, the place was in SHAMBLES, and the perfect storm of the ENTIRE cafe calling out on a single day happened. 

I opened the cafe, sent a message to the director stating the situation and telling him I was going to close early so I could take care of everything, including prep so we could function properly. 

He came to the cafe and said ""Maybe we should part ways"". 

I was so fucking shocked. I straight up asked him ""So, you want to fire the guy who's here almost everyday instead of any of the staff who you admit are ""lazy fucking kids"" because this entire operation wouldn't be here without the existence of people who've been aged out the foster care system?""

""Yeah"" he says. 

I couldn't believe what I was hearing. They knew how much work I put into the place. Running a cafe is literally my dream job. I fucking live and breathe through breakfast and coffee, and here I was, out of the job, while the worst people I've ever worked with in a food setting were living large, being given handouts through this program that would pay for half their housing, buy them clothes when they needed, etc. 

I felt awful, as if I failed them, my wife, my wife's mom...I hated the idea of her knowing she was leaving this world while her daughter was with ""some bum"" (all of this was in my head, they're truly the nicest people I've ever met in my life).

The vindication I felt when I saw that they were ""Strategically closing"" last week through a post on Instagram? Fucking PRICELESS. I've got way more horror stories about this place, but I think I've written an entire book here 😆 

There was a time where I wished the staff well, even after I was let go. Now? I hope the world shows them EXACTLY what the fuck is up. ",158,1753129210.0,KitchenConfidential,20,0.99,False

1m5tsc7,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1m5tsc7/does_waterdrop_wdf13_water_filter_deliver_quality/,Does Waterdrop WD-F13 Water Filter Deliver Quality Filtration? Comprehensive Review Inside,"**Initial Impressions**  

Testing the Waterdrop WD-F13 Replacement really made me rethink the importance of a quality water filter. This compact yet highly efficient refrigerator water filter has one purpose: to make sure you drink cleaner, purer water every day without having to second-guess its reliability. Designed as a replacement for GE, Kenmore, and other prominent brands, it boasts certifications from NSF 42 and NSF 372, immediately instilling confidence in its performance. As someone who drinks loads of water and relies on my fridge’s dispenser daily, I decided to give this filter a whirl and see how much of a difference it could really make.  

**Installation Experience**  

Installing this filter was ridiculously straightforward, much to my relief. I don’t consider myself particularly handy, but with the Waterdrop WD-F13, you don’t need to be. There are no tools required, and the filter locks into place securely without any hassle. It felt as sturdy as the original filter my fridge came with, and I appreciated the provided step-by-step instructions. The included month stickers, which act as a reminder of when to replace the filter, are a thoughtful touch, especially for those like me who tend to forget such details.  

[Check Waterdrop WD-F13 price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b01cc7o8lu/)  

**Performance and Filtration**  

Drinking water quality is something I normally take for granted—until I notice a difference. After just a day or two of using this refrigerator water filter, the improvement in taste was undeniable. Water tastes cleaner and fresher, and even my coffee brewed with it seemed to have a fuller flavor. The use of 100% Sri Lankan coconut shell carbon made an impact that’s hard to overlook. The advanced activated carbon block is far superior to traditional materials like coal or wood-based filters, offering far better impurity reduction. It claims to filter up to 300 gallons, or approximately six months of water, which seems reasonable for everyday household use.  

**Advantages**  

- Certified by NSF 42/372 for filtration performance and lead-free materials  
- Easy, tool-free installation process saves time and effort  
- Exceptional materials such as coconut shell carbon for improved filtration  
- Complimentary tracking stickers to monitor usage effortlessly  
- Compatible with a wide range of refrigerators  

**Design and Build**  

At first glance, the filter looks sleek and compact, but don’t let its modest size fool you. Made from food-grade BPA-free materials, it feels durable and well-constructed. I particularly liked how it snugly fit into the refrigerator compartment without any risk of leakage. My old filter used to struggle here, so the fact that this one solves that issue earns massive points in my book. Plus, knowing it’s made with safe-to-use materials gives even more peace of mind.  

**Negatives**  

- Limited lifespan of six months means regular replacement cycles  
- Pricing might not be the lowest compared to some generic options  
- Compatibility with non-standard fridge models could still be hit or miss  

**Competing Products**  

There are plenty of other water filter options on the market, and I’ve tried a couple from aftermarket brands previously. Many lack the certifications that this one carries, which is a key deciding factor for me. Some competitors offer a slightly longer lifespan, such as nine months of usage, but they often lack the precision fit and taste quality this one delivers. Where the Waterdrop WD-F13 wins is in the details—it doesn’t just serve the purpose of reducing impurities; it elevates the overall quality of the water and gives you more reliability.  

**Smart Spending**  

From a price-to-quality ratio, this refrigerator water filter does justify itself as a worthwhile investment. While it sits in a mid-range category regarding costs, you get a premium performance that rivals higher-priced OEM filters. The certified materials and detailed design cater to those who prioritize drinking water quality. Though less expensive options flood the market, many come with risks, such as leaks or diminished filtration capabilities. This makes the Waterdrop WD-F13 stand out confidently.

1m5tqwr,https://www.reddit.com/r/VISINT/comments/1m5tqwr/antidoxxing_101_visual_evasion_tactics_explained/,Anti-Doxxing 101: Visual Evasion Tactics Explained,"Welcome, everyone! I’m excited to have you here and to kick off this community focused on **VISINT**—the art and science (and dare I say, the dance) of **Visual Intelligence**: everything from spotting, analyzing, and countering surveillance cameras in the wild (**TCSM** bonus!) to understanding what their operators (and algorithms) are doing—and aren’t protecting you from.

**What’s this all about?**

The core mission of this subreddit is **self-defense for the digital age**. In a world where public cameras—on every street corner, inside every store, and on every lamp post—are becoming as common as pigeons in the park, everyone should have the skills and awareness to protect themselves from doxxing and unwanted exposure.

**Where are the cameras?**

Think about it:  
**Streets, traffic lights, ATMs, public squares, train stations, buses, shopping centers, offices, building lobbies, gyms, elevators, parking garages, smart city sensors, doorbells, delivery drones, even your favorite coffee shop’s ceiling.** Cameras are embedded into the urban fabric, and their operators? That’s a spectrum from local cops to global data brokers.

**A little about me:**  
I’m an **OSINT investigator** with over a decade of hands-on, boots-on-the-ground, and screens-in-the-face experience—building threat intelligence and risk mitigation strategies before “OSINT” was even a buzzword. I’ve worked in digital forensics, social media monitoring, and, yes, visual intelligence. This stuff isn’t just theory—it’s how I’ve made a living, helping organizations and individuals understand—and push back against—the surveillance sprawl.

# Basic Tips and Why They Work

If you want to avoid being picked out by digital eyes, here are some proven, practical habits. They may seem simple, but the results speak for themselves.

* **Baseball cap or similar and sunglasses:** Yes! This actually works much of the time. It might seem cheesy (straight out of *Captain America: The Winter Soldier*), and sure, a trained observer may still notice you, but it can defeat premium facial recognition tools like lenso.ai, faceseek.online, and the heavy hitters on the OSINT Framework.
* **Walk in the shade!** Don’t underestimate the power of light and shadow—being in light or even moderate shade can alter the way you appear to cameras, sometimes enough that facial recognition struggles or even misidentifies your ethnicity or features. Subtle shifts in lighting can fool even advanced algorithms.
* **Ladies, change your jewelry!** Seriously, repeated accessories give you away. I can’t count how many investigations have been solved because the same thumb ring, earring, or necklace appeared across different photos or locations.
* **Protesters: mind your signs and hair!** Many women are only identified in footage because their chest is visible even when holding a sign. A well-placed poster can obscure gender cues—and tucking long hair inside a hat adds another layer of ambiguity.
* **Cover your tattoos!** Tattoos are one of the easiest ways to track someone visually, even if high-end law enforcement tools (like ROC) aren’t in every investigator’s toolbox. Most in the field know someone who can help analyze distinctive ink, so cover up when needed.
* Here’s something a lot of folks don’t realize: **OSINT investigators work on the clock, and our clients expect quick, actionable results**. If I’m tasked with identifying 10 people and only have a 4-hour budget, I’ll always start with the easy targets—the ones who stand out, repeat recognizable patterns, or leave clues everywhere. Clients care about numbers, not how creative or resourceful you are. It’s like that old joke: If a bear is chasing you and your friend, you don’t have to be faster than the bear—just faster than your friend. In this world, you don’t need to be impossible to find—just harder to find than most. That’s why even the simplest steps can make all the difference.

**Moderator Needed: Strictly Enforcing Reddit's Doxxing Policies**

I’m currently looking for a **moderator who will VERY STRICTLY follow Reddit’s anti-doxxing policies**. 

This is absolutely essential for this community to stay safe, respectful, and in good standing with Reddit’s platform rules.

I know this is a particularly tough role—after all, to prevent doxxing and keep everyone protected, you need to have a deep understanding of how doxxing happens in the first place. It means walking a careful line, noticing the signs, and stepping in fast—sometimes before trouble even starts. If you have both the knowledge and the discipline to enforce these rules as written, I want to hear from you!

If this sounds like you, or you have ideas for helping create a proactive and protective mod team, drop a comment or DM. Your experience and commitment could make all the difference here.

**A Heads-Up About the Future**

Should this work out, I’m happy to offer the right person the chance to take over the subreddit going forward. I’ll be moving into the private sector soon, and—full disclosure—I’m genuinely curious to see if the best enterprise-level software out there can outsmart some of these real-world anti-doxxing tips.

1m5tq8l,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m5tq8l,"it's a no from me, spuds.","got an ad on facebook for this place that's locked down a location on laurel called spuds lounge and cafe. the post describes itself as a ""one of a kind lounge experience with thrift shop vibes, music, art, and events, bottled coffee and bites, and chill zones for study and play."" 

the concept seemed cool, but i was pretty put off by the fact that i couldn't find anything about this place that wasn't AI generated. every image, every bit of text i could find was obviously AI. not a hint of human influence on their website or any of their posts. for a place that advertises itself the way it does, i was pretty taken aback. 

even more jarring was the fact that they're holding a logo design contest right now for their logo that'll be used on their storefront, in all promotional materials, and on all their merch. the prize? a whopping $100 gift card.

i wasn't impressed, so i left a comment on that post. 

they replied back with ""I'm not a grant fund Riley. I'm a music lounge and coffee shop. I'm not here to financially support artists."" then blocked me very shortly after. i'm not sure if my comments are still up.

which is already an insane thing to say when you're launching a late night cafe lounge with a baked potato bar, thrifted furniture that you can purchase to take home, music, art, and events - seriously, who do they think their target audience is? - but this also appears to contradict their statement on their website about community-funded and supported by local artists and performers. i'm confused, spuds. you'll take their money to build your project, but won't give back? how far do you see yourself getting with that attitude?

tl;dr it's a dealbreaker for me. not telling anyone to feel the same way, but if this is something that matters to you, it might be worth keeping in mind when/if this place opens.

also the graphic design on their website is atrocious lol",169,1753129021.0,FortCollins,89,0.86,False

What should I do?,"I (24F) ended my one year relationship with my ex (22M) six months ago, I haven't had any contact and he's still trying to contact me.


I was in a toxic relationship where my ex was obsessive, controlling, and emotionally manipulative. I broke up with him in February, blocked him on everything, and made it clear I didn’t want contact. Since then, he’s found ways to keep reaching out — voicemails, texting my mom, and now calling me almost every night. I’m not afraid of him, but I feel stuck. Why won’t he let go? And is there anything else I should do besides continue to ignore him?

The Full Story:
Things started off great. We both loved cars, which is rare for me to find in a guy. At first, he was kind and supportive, and I thought I’d found someone who really accepted me.

But around 3 months in, things changed. He told me he had bipolar disorder but wasn’t taking medication. His behavior became unpredictable and emotionally intense. He fixated on my past relationship — asking constant, invasive questions about my ex and our intimacy. I tried to set boundaries, but he pushed right through them.

Later, he became controlling — wanting to be intimate constantly, and acting distant or angry if I wasn’t into it. When I started pulling away, he pushed harder. He monitored my location, stalked my social media, and got angry when I did things for myself, like getting a coffee after work. He’d call me over 20 times in a row if I didn’t text him immediately.

He constantly criticized my hobbies, my friends, even my coworkers — especially the men. He made me remove long-time male friends from my social media, but he was texting other girls and even asked one of them for advice about our relationship. I started therapy to work on my own mental health, and my therapist helped me recognize the manipulation and narcissism. When I confronted him, he called her a liar. He said he’d go to therapy and try meds for his bipolar, but he never followed through.

Eventually, I broke up with him on Valentine’s Day. We had brief contact after, trying to see if time apart would help — but then he went on a date and told me all about it. That was the last straw. I told him clearly that I didn’t want to be friends, and I blocked him on everything.

Since then, he’s kept finding ways to reach me.

On Mother’s Day, he sent me multiple creepy voicemails.

He messaged my mom to try and get through to me.

And now in July, he’s calling me every night around midnight. Sometimes he leaves voicemails apologizing or asking to be friends. Mostly, it’s just calls.

I haven’t responded. I don’t plan to. But I guess I’m just stuck in this space of:

Why can’t he respect my boundaries?
Why won't he leave me alone?
What more can I even do?

And has anyone else dealt with someone who keeps trying to come back even after you’ve made your boundaries absolutely clear?
