According to Tom Campbell, reality is virtual, not \`real¬¥ in the sense we understand it. To us this does not matter.

In the same way the taste of the coffee would not change if we are now introduced to the Virtual Reality Theory. According to him reality is reproduced at the rate of Planck time (10 to the power of 43 times per second). Thus, what we perceive as so-called outer reality is constantly reproduced. It vanishes before it is then reproduced again. And again and again and again. Similar to a picture on a computer screen. And this is basically what Bashar is describing as well. Everything collapses to a zero point. Constantly. And it is reproduced one unit of Planck time later. Just to collapse again and to be again reproduced. And you are constantly in a new universe/multiverse. And all the others as well. There is an excellent video on youtube (Tom Campbell and Jim Elvidge). The book \`My Big ToE¬¥ is downloadable as well. I recommend starting with the video. Each universe is static, but when you move across some of them in a specific order (e.g. nos 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, etc.) you get the impression of movement and experience. Similar to a movie screen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Many people wonder about the direct benefits of flossing on the appearance of their teeth, particularly when it comes to whitening. If you‚Äôre curious about whether flossing makes your teeth whiter, it‚Äôs important to understand how plaque, tartar, and stains affect your oral health. Regular flossing plays a significant role in maintaining a bright smile. So, let‚Äôs dive into how flossing contributes to teeth whitening.

When you commit to a diligent oral hygiene routine, you‚Äôre not only keeping your teeth clean but also preventing discoloration. Here are some notable ways that flossing can influence the whiteness of your teeth:

- **Removal of Plaque**: Flossing effectively removes plaque from between your teeth. Plaque is a sticky film of bacteria that can lead to tartar build-up. When tartar forms, it can cause your teeth to appear yellow or dull.
- **Stain Prevention**: Food particles and beverages, especially those that are dark or rich in color (like coffee, tea, or red wine), can cause stains. Flossing can help eliminate tiny food bits that can lead to discoloration. By removing these particles, you make it less likely for your teeth to stain.
- **Improved Gum Health**: Healthy gums contribute to a more attractive smile. When you floss regularly, you reduce inflammation and potential gum disease. This not only makes your smile look better but can also affect how bright your teeth appear.
- **Enhanced Effectiveness of Whitening Products**: If you use whitening toothpaste or strips, pairing these with regular flossing can boost their effectiveness. Flossing cleans between the teeth, allowing whitening agents to work more effectively on the surfaces of your teeth.
- **Long-term Benefits**: Consistent flossing creates a solid foundation for oral health. Over time, this can lead to a more vibrant smile as you avoid common dental problems that might cause your teeth to lose their luster.

Now, you might be asking, ‚ÄúIs it necessary for my teeth to be whiter?‚Äù The truth is, a white smile can enhance your confidence and improve your overall appearance. While healthy habits like brushing and flossing contribute to that bright smile, it‚Äôs essential to remember that flossing alone won‚Äôt dramatically change the color of your teeth.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
It‚Äôs important to combine flossing with other good dental practices. Here are some tips to enhance your teeth-whitening efforts:

- **Brush Twice Daily**: Make sure to brush your teeth at least twice a day using a fluoride toothpaste. This adds an extra layer of protection and helps fight stains.
- **Use Baking Soda**: Some people find that incorporating baking soda into their oral care routine helps to polish teeth and remove surface stains.
- **Limit Stain-Creating Foods**: Reduce your intake of foods and drinks that cause staining. If you enjoy a cup of coffee or a glass of red wine, rinse your mouth with water afterward.
- **Consider Professional Whitening**: If you‚Äôre looking for a quicker result, consider talking to your dentist about professional whitening treatments.
- **Regular Dental Check-ups**: Schedule check-ups with your dentist to ensure your teeth are healthy and whiteness is maintained through professional cleanings.

While flossing itself may not make your teeth noticeably whiter immediately, it is a crucial element in maintaining your overall oral health, which contributes to a brighter smile. By integrating daily flossing with good brushing habits and regular dental visits, you can achieve the shining smile you desire. Remember, the goal is not just a pretty smile but also optimal dental health!

Best Practices for Flossing to Maintain Oral Health and Enhance Brightness
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Flossing is a crucial part of oral hygiene that many people overlook. Although brushing your teeth is essential, flossing reaches areas that your toothbrush simply can‚Äôt. So, does flossing make your teeth whiter? While it may not whiten your teeth in the way whitening strips or toothpaste do, regular flossing can significantly improve your oral health and contribute to a brighter smile. Let‚Äôs explore the best practices for flossing effectively to maintain oral health and enhance brightness.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Understanding the Role of Flossing

Flossing helps remove plaque and food particles between your teeth and along the gum line. When you skip flossing, you allow plaque to build up, which can lead to gum disease, cavities, and even bad breath. Keeping your gums healthy can naturally give your teeth a brighter appearance because healthy gums support the teeth and enhance your overall smile.

### Best Practices for Flossing

To make the most of your flossing routine, consider incorporating these best practices into your oral health care:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Choose the Right Floss:** Not all flosses are created equal. You can select from waxed, unwaxed, teflon, or dental tape. Trying different options can help you find the one that glides easily between your teeth and makes the process more effective.
- **Use Enough Floss:** Pull out about 18 inches of floss. This length allows you to use a clean section for each tooth without transferring bacteria.
- **Be Gentle:** Slide the floss gently between your teeth without snapping it. Aim for a C-shape around each tooth to avoid damaging your gums.
- **Floss Daily:** Make flossing a daily habit, ideally before brushing. Consistency is key for removing plaque and preventing discoloration over time.
- **Pay Attention to All Areas:** Don‚Äôt forget to floss the back teeth! Many people skip these, which can lead to cavities and gum disease.

### Combining Flossing with Brushing for Best Results

Flossing alone won‚Äôt guarantee a bright smile; combining it with effective brushing is essential. Here‚Äôs how to do it:

1. Start by gently flossing between your teeth to remove any food particles and plaque.
2. After flossing, brush your teeth with fluoride toothpaste for at least two minutes, ensuring you reach all tooth surfaces.
3. Rinse thoroughly with water or mouthwash to remove any remaining debris.

### Mouthwash

After brushing and flossing, consider swishing some mouthwash around your mouth. An antibacterial mouthwash can help kill any remaining bacteria that may cause plaque formation and bad breath. This step adds another layer of protection for your teeth and gums.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Regular Dental Checkups

Don‚Äôt underestimate the importance of regular visits to your dentist. Routine cleanings help remove tartar that flossing and brushing can‚Äôt. During these visits, your dentist can also check for any issues that could affect your smile's brightness.

### Signs You Need to Floss More Consistently

It‚Äôs crucial to be aware of signs that you may not be flossing enough. Look out for:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- Red or swollen gums
- Bad breath that doesn't fade
- Pain or discomfort between your teeth

If you're experiencing any of these symptoms, it‚Äôs time to reevaluate your flossing habits. Making flossing a priority can lead to healthier gums, which in turn helps your pearly whites shine.

### The Long-Term Benefits of Flossing

Remember, the real benefit of flossing lies in its long-term impact on your oral health. By practicing good flossing techniques, you not only help prevent cavities and gum disease but also maintain a bright, confident smile. When your gums are healthy, your teeth appear more vibrant and radiant.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
These best practices into your daily routine can transform your dental health and brighten your smile. So grab your floss and make those teeth shine!

### Conclusion

Flossing plays a significant role in maintaining not only your oral health but also the appearance of your smile. By regularly removing plaque and food particles from between your teeth, you reduce the risk of stains and discoloration. While flossing alone may not turn your teeth white, it contributes to a brighter smile by enhancing the effectiveness of other dental care practices, such as brushing and using whitening products.

Best practices for flossing‚Äîlike using the right technique and choosing the right type of floss for your needs‚Äîcan elevate your oral hygiene routine and support your teeth-whitening goals. Aim to floss daily to keep your gums healthy and reduce the chances of plaque buildup that can lead to a duller smile. Additionally, visiting your dentist for regular cleanings complements your at-home care and ensures you are on the right track toward achieving the brightest smile possible.

I loved the job but management was horrible. I dealt with it at first because I was 18, fresh out of high school, and I didn‚Äôt know what to expect from my first real job. My main issues with this daycare were that the hours were inconsistent, management would overcrowd the classrooms that they didn‚Äôt work in, and they repeatedly showed no concern for staff or students. 

Last spring I tried to quit after receiving an offer for a nanny job. They offered to beat the pay and offered better benefits, then cut my hours. When it was time for the raise they refused to give it to me because I didn‚Äôt have my degree yet. We had gotten into quite a few arguments then I took a week off for vacation. While on vacation I managed to catch an infection that caught the attention of the county health department. The county emailed my work saying I couldn‚Äôt attend until further notice. I was gone for 2 weeks but they had already replaced me by then with someone that I later found out is making barely above minimum wage (I left making $24/hr). 

I was fine because I was able to get my nanny job and they absolutely spoil me. I show up to work in the morning and they have my coffee and a bagel on the table for me, they take me out to eat at least once a week, and gave me a gift worth over a thousand dollars for Christmas. I do still get to see plenty of my former students/parents through elementary school pickup and after school activities for my nanny kids. They used to ask if I was coming back and I‚Äôd try to give a vague but positive response but I realized my former workplace didn‚Äôt deserve that so I started telling the truth about them overcrowding the classrooms, accepting special needs students but refusing to provide training on working with those students, hiring immigrants without the right credits or certifications because they could be paid less (the only non immigrants at that daycare were management), and how they disregard safety regulations (in 2 years I hadn‚Äôt filled out a single incident report and none of the staff had their cpr certifications because nobody wanted to pay for it). 

Shockingly, people are starting to pull their kids from the daycare.

I told her how drinking hot water could improve her well-being, like how it aids digestion, boosts circulation, and helps with weight management. But she wasn‚Äôt interested. 

No, she insisted on drinking cold water with ice cubes, even after I told her how it could mess with her metabolism. The way she refused to try something so easy - it was frustrating and I don't like being frustrated.

We had invited family over for our annual Christmas party, and everything seemed to be going fine‚Äîor at least that's what I wanted my wife to think. 

I‚Äôd planned a little something for the evening. A friendly video montage. You know, the usual happy moments: family dinners, our vacations, all that warm and fuzzy stuff. 

I had included clips of us together, smiling like a perfect couple. But then, halfway through - it showed my wife, sitting with a glass of cold water - just sitting there drinking it, while the steaming mug I'd lovingly poured for her remained on the coffee table, untouched. 

""What is this, babe,"" she asked me, clearly trying to find the remote - but my mother was guarding it like a ferocious tiger.

It wasn‚Äôt just once or twice; it was every time - always with the cold water.

""Drink the fucking hot water!"" I yelled at my wife.

""No! We are not doing this right now!"" She yelled back at me. ""I don't want to drink hot water, for the last fucking time!""

I saw it clearly, and so did everyone else. ""Does she know hot water actually boosts circulation?"" My boss said to his boyfriend. ""It even helps with digestion,"" the other gay man said, eyebrows raised in disbelief.

""I even told her that drinking hot water promotes bowel regularity, detoxifies the body, and improves the immune system!"" I explained to the rest of the party.

""Who chooses to be toxic?"" My mother chimed in. 

How could she ignore all the benefits? She was stubbornly avoiding what was clearly a game-changer for her health, and now it was playing out in front of everyone.

The whispers grew louder. ‚ÄúHot water even reduces stress,‚Äù Beatrice, our servant added. 

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the point of suffering through cold water when hot water helps with pain reduction too? Are you dumb or something?‚Äù my mother asked my sour-faced wife. 

‚ÄúHot water even helps with sleep and helps your metabolism!‚Äù I yell at her, holding a steaming mug out for my love to take. 

Then, good ol' drunk Gary chuckled and said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs hard to microwave some water for one minute! I can‚Äôt believe she refuses to drink it. What‚Äôs her problem?!‚Äù He was pointing and laughing at her for the whole rest of the night. 

And then it hit me‚Äîthe full realization of how deeply stubborn she was being. Why would anyone choose cold water over something so easy and life-enhancing? Why would she not care about all the proven benefits of hot water, like improving gut health, reducing cold symptoms, or even helping with swallowing disorders?

""You actually want to die, don't you?"" I asked my wife. ""You're sick in the head, aren't you!?""

""Maybe you're being to stern,"" my boss suggested, but I wasn't being stern enough. 

My wife looked at me in disbelief, but I wasn‚Äôt backing down. She was poisoning herself by not drinking hot water. There I was, trying to help her, and she was too proud to admit that maybe‚Äîjust maybe‚Äîshe was fucking wrong!

My mom, always the wise one, raised a glass and said, ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs to hot water, and to people who are too stupid to drink it. What a shame.‚Äù

Drunk Gary was still pointing and cackling at my wife, while he stuffed his face with nachos, when it finally happened. 

""Fine, mother fuckers! I'll drink the fucking hot water!"" My wife yelled at everyone, standing up suddenly - bit of a potty mouth on that one. 

""Oh shit, she's actually gonna do it!"" My boss said, rubbing his hands together. 

She took one sip and collapsed on the carpet; she didn't wake up until the ceremony was almost complete. 

We had her strapped to the table in the basement, where we do a human sacrifice to Satan every year.

""You didn't want to drink the hot water, but you're in hot water now..."" My mom said, sipping from her mug. 

Drunk Gary was pointing and laughing at her, and then Satan shows up, all red. 

""Here he is!"" My boss said, excitedly jumping up and down with the other gay man. 

""I don't care!"" My wife yells. ""Take my fucking soul already! I'm not a decent woman!""

""We know, dear"" my mom said. ""If you cared about your brain and reproductive organs, you would have been drinking the hot water.""

""It even helps with erectile dysfunction!"" I remind her. 

Satan laughs in his Santa outfit, ""Ho, Ho, Ho - we have a special place in hell for those who don't even know the benefits of drinking hot water!""

""You're literally going to hell for not drinking hot water!"" drunk Gary laughed, and then choked out some nachos on the floor. He kept pointing and laughing anyway, cheese all in his beard. I hadn't seen him that happy since he was drunk on my wedding night. 

""I don't care!"" My wife says, clearly trying to ignore everyone and act like she's trying to sleep. 

Then, all of the sudden the air crackled with an unnatural energy. The room grew cold, and a sudden gust of wind whipped through, scattering papers and knocking over drinks. A deep voice, smooth yet commanding, echoed from the doorway.

""Enough of this farce!"" Ryu, from Street Fighter, stepped into the room, his iconic red headband fluttering as he struck a battle-ready stance. ""I am here to challenge Satan for the right to her soul.""

The room froze in disbelief.

""What?"" My wife muttered, blinking. ""Why would you do that?""

Ryu locked eyes with her, a fire burning in his gaze. ""I‚Äôve seen the way you‚Äôve suffered, because I was watching through the window. No one should have to suffer like that.""

Satan, unfazed, merely chuckled, his red eyes gleaming. ""This is not a challenge you can win, warrior. Your strength is nothing compared to mine.""

""You underestimate me, demon,"" Ryu said with a calm, determined smirk. ""But it‚Äôs not about strength. It‚Äôs about honor.""

The fight began, and the room was filled with the sounds of fists clashing against infernal power. Ryu‚Äôs every move was a blur of grace and power. Satan roared in fury as Ryu‚Äôs Shoryuken struck true, sending the demon staggering back.

As the battle raged on, it became clear that Ryu was more than a match for the dark lord. With a final, thunderous punch, Ryu sent Satan sprawling to the ground, his demonic form cracking under the force.

""You‚Äôre not getting her soul,"" Ryu declared, panting, his muscles rippling. ""Not right now!""

Satan glared at him but, with a defeated growl, opened a portal behind him. ""This isn‚Äôt over, mortal!""

With Satan gone, Ryu turned to my wife, his expression softening. He unstrapped her from the table, and then dropped to one knee, his voice steady. ""I‚Äôve fought for you. I‚Äôve battled Satan - the dark Lord, for the chance to be with you. Will you marry me?""

The room went silent. My wife‚Äôs eyes widened, and then, a smile slowly spread across her face. ""I‚Äôve always loved you in street fighters, Ryu,"" she said excitedly, her voice trembling with emotion. ""Yes! Yes, I will marry you!""

And then, in a flash, Ryu punched her square in the stomach. ""Not!"" He yelled. 

The room erupted in loud, raucous laughter, the kind you only hear after a chaotic night of worshipping the devil. Even Satan, now peeking through his portal, couldn‚Äôt help but laugh. We were all in on the joke, obviously. 

And with that, my wife was sucked into the portal, disappearing into the unknown with the devil, as the entire family continued to laugh and cheer.

""Yeah, go to hell for not drinking hot water, dumb bitch!"" Ryu laughed. ""I drink hot water every evening, and fucking look at me.""

""You do seem like you're in very good shape, Ryu."" My mother said. 

Ryu is my dad now, and he's helping me train to throw fireballs and spinning tornado kicks. I can already do the jumping uppercut - I've been able to do that since I was a kid.

My boss gave me a promotion, because the party was so kick ass, and he's coming over later with the other gay man later - to watch a special channel Satan gave me on the television. 

I'm watching my wife on the TV right now. She's with David Bowie and Kobe Bryant, and honestly she seems happier now. I don't think she really liked chilling in the house with me and my mom, for whatever reason.

","\*winter 2016\*

It was a grey cold day of December, I have been working this job for three months and I hate it already, I had this constant feeling of being the dumbest team member and that it was only a matter of time before they discover the fraud and fire me.

I was not getting along especially good with my coworkers, I was being treated like a child and wasn‚Äôt taken seriously by most team members, some even smirked when I talked and no one took me seriously, so I started to keep my ideas to myself and just listen to other people saying crap with the utmost confidence.

That day, I struggled to wake up in the morning, my mother kept shouting that I‚Äôll be late and that I‚Äôm making my father wait for too long, and he would answer as always, leave her alone we‚Äôre not in a hurry.

I‚Äôve always been his sweetheart and I knew it, In my teenage years I took advantage of it to stand up to my mother‚Äôs authoritative nature and he would protect me from her wrath.

He is a big impressive guy with an athletic body, he has a successful career, he mandated respect and projected a lot of self confidence, even people that don‚Äôt know him call him almost automatically ¬´oustedh¬ª or ¬´maitre¬ª or even doctor sometimes.

My girl friends used to tell me how handsome he was and somehow that would piss me off.

He talked slowly with a deep voice and always had a smile when he talked to me, even when blaming me for a mistake or scolding me which was very rare.¬†

When I was a kid, I used to wake up early to watch him get ready for work, it was quite the show for me, watching him wash his face, brush his teeth, shave, get dressed and wear his perfume.

He never had anything to eat in the morning, only coffee that he makes in a decades old mocca he bought from Italy a long time ago when he was a student on exchange, he made us breakfast everyday and would sit there with us sipping on his sugarless coffee, and would laugh at us trying to take a taste of it and complaining of how bitter it was.

That man, defined my standard for what a man is, then I grew up to learn how high is that bar and how unfair it is for anyone I meet to make him compete with that image.

The drive from home to work was about 30 minutes when there is not traffic, a delightful half an hour that I spend with my father, talking about work, life, politics, and making him listen to my favorite music of that moment, very often cheesy pop that he tolerated but would make fun of sometimes for having stupid lyrics and no instruments.



He dropped me off, I kissed him goodbye, wished him a great day and went to work.

A little before noon, X came to my desk to ask if I was tempted to eat outside for a change, I hesitated for a moment then I said why not ? I asked about his plans for lunch, he said he‚Äôs going to some Italian restaurant with a few team members, and that they were flexible if I have other ideas, I answered that Italian was fine for me.

It was the first time I eat with a group of colleagues there, and he was surprised that I didn‚Äôt know their names, so he introduced me to them, then said jokingly now you know other people you can bother when you have an issue.

It was a lot of fun, they were nicer than I expected, and it made me feel for the first time that I was part of a team, not just a task doer.

They asked me about my background, my studies and I figured that I‚Äôve had some common friends with one of them.

I noticed during that meal that he was the one generating conversation, asking people questions, challenging their answers sometimes harshly but always in a fun way that made people laugh, think more and elaborate. It is hard to describe, but it felt like he orchestrated the discussion, oriented it, controlled its rhythm, and he would change subjects every time the discussion calms down.

We were already late when we finished our meal, and I made that remark, he told me not to get nervous, that if they fired all the people here they would go bankrupt in no time, and that bosses are cooler than I think, they only cared about results he said.

On the way back to office, he asked me if enjoyed it, he said ¬´you see, we‚Äôre clean and we don‚Äôt bite, we even eat with knives and forks¬ª, and I laughed, I said that it was fun and thanked him for the invitation.",4,1735284597.0,Tunisia,2,1.0,False

I have a business idea which I'm excited to pursue, very similar in concept to a coffee stand. I intend to start trading as a stand at smaller markets and hopefully grow over time to a brick and mortar cafe operation. I'm very aware of the power of carefully considered design/branding and so need the support of designers in order to make this happen.

Therefore, my question is as follows - could someone please advise me on what kind of design support I require?

I have been looking on Behance, Dribbble, Fiverr etc., however many talented professionals are understandably charging large sums for their 'full branding packages' (think $6000+) and I frankly can't afford this kind of investment just yet. It's giving me the impression (perhaps wrongly, happy to be corrected) that I need to perhaps divide my requests across smaller/new designers to reach a happy middle ground of value.

In an ideal world, I would need support with the following:

* Logo
* Product branding (think of the design of a custom-printed coffee cup)
* Typeface, brand messaging, brand guidelines
* General graphic design elements which run the gamut of applicability for marketing materials (print, social media, website)
* Website design (optional)
* Photography support (optional)

And you are constantly in a new universe/multiverse. And all the others as well. There is an excellent video on youtube (Tom Campbell and Jim Elvidge). The book \`My Big ToE¬¥ is downloadable as well. I recommend starting with the video. Each universe is static, but when you move across some of them in a specific order (e.g. nos 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, etc.) you get the impression of movement and experience. Similar to a movie screen. If you change (the vibration of) your belief systems, you have access to frames nos 6, 11, 16, 21, 26 etc. You would then be another person in another universe, having different experiences. And there would be still \`a version of you¬¥ having experiences in a reality that is composed of frames nos. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 etc. But you are not the other you, and the other you is not you. You are in a different reality and by changing your belief systems consciously you can navigate across realities less randomly and in a more targeted way. That is basically everything the Bashar teachings are about. Plus open contact.",1,1735284222.0,AliensRHere,0,1.0,False

We‚Äôre still friends and chat semi regularly for a long time over the phone and see each other every month or so for coffee and to kick it. It‚Äôs a bit weird‚Ä¶we have so much history. But mostly really good and has just gotten easier and easier. We‚Äôre both so much better off. It was the best thing I could‚Äôve done for us. I‚Äôm so glad I did it. I used to read this subreddit constantly the last several years and just get really fucking sad. It‚Äôs wild to me. I‚Äôm posting this now because I just logged into this account for the first time in over a year and this sub was in my feed and it brought back all these flashes of the hours I‚Äôd spent reading all this and feeling so hopeless in my marriage. 

And I‚Äôm getting it on the reg now and my girlfriend and I are madly in love and our communication is excellent and we are way more sexually compatible than I ever was with my ex. The NRE is still popping off after nearly a year of being with her everyday and it‚Äôs so wild. I‚Äôve never felt this way. My honeymoon period wore off within a couple months with my ex and I stayed with him for 12 fucking years!!! But in all likelihood it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm a lesbian and not actually bi like I‚Äôd thought for my whole life. 

And he‚Äôs doing well and dating around and having sex too. Win win.

Here are some of my detailed thoughts, which I hope will help anyone considering buying one.

The ring itself is pretty lightweight, and there‚Äôs no noticeable discomfort while sleeping. Before using it, I was a bit worried it might feel tight or pinch my fingers, but that hasn‚Äôt been an issue. The companion app categorizes sleep into deep sleep, light sleep, REM, etc., and the data closely matches what I previously recorded with my Apple Watch. Personally, I find the charts intuitive and easy to read. However, if you‚Äôre looking for professional-grade sleep analysis (like EEG-based reports), this ring can‚Äôt deliver that level of detail. It does provide a sleep quality score, which is a rough indicator of how well you slept‚Äîbut don‚Äôt rely on it too much. Low scores every now and then don‚Äôt necessarily mean your sleep was terrible.

One thing that surprised me was the correlation with my habits‚Äîif I drink coffee late or stay up gaming, my deep sleep hours noticeably decrease the next day. On the flip side, going to bed before 10:30 PM a few days in a row slightly improved my sleep score and deep sleep duration.

As for battery life, the official claim is 4‚Äì7 days. My ring loses about 17% battery per day, which aligns with their estimate, but I still wish it could last longer‚Äîsomething like a full week without worrying about charging would be ideal.

Pro tip: Make sure you get the right size. The company sends sizing models for you to test before purchase, and I strongly recommend wearing the correct model for a whole day to ensure it fits comfortably",3,1735283615.0,SmartRings,1,1.0,False

I'm really just curious if anyone else has noticed a strong change in symptoms like this related to the weather?

--------


Scene: The flight deck of the Liberator. The lighting is darkened. Blake is sitting on the edge of a table underneath the Zen dislay. Cally walks in.

Cally: Dreams again?

Blake: Yes. And I have a headache.

Cally: Have you been to the Medibay?

Blake: Numerous times. It says my condition can't be fixed due to ""neurological damage"".

Cally: (sighs, looks away) Bastards.

Blake: And you're awake because...?

Cally: (Looks back at Blake) Too much coffee.

Blake: (smiles) (changes topic) Do you feel up to a crew review?

Cally: Is that what you're calling it?

Blake: I don't know what to call it. But you know what I'm talking about.

Cally: (smiles wistfully and nods).

Blake: Jenna.

Cally: She trusts you. She respects Avon. She is fed up with Vila. She ignores Gan. She is wary of me. She is thrilled to be piloting the Liberator. She's not sure if she should commit herself to your crusade against the Federation. You will lose her trust if you make bad decisions or lie to her. In fact lying is one of the things she is most disgusted about in people.

Blake: Hmmm. Interesting. Vila.

Cally: Vila doesn't trust anyone. (smiles) He likes Jenna and me because we're women but isn't likely to make any moves on us just yet. His humour is his way of coping with anxiety. He knows he is a brilliant thief and that's where his confidence lies. He feels inferior to you and Avon. He's not sure if he can last on board the ship because he can't please anyone.

Blake: Gan.

Cally: Gan is a concern. His limiter genuinely prevents him from going physically berserk. He is angered easily and finds it very easy to jump to conclusions.

Blake: (furrows brow) That doesn't sound like Gan.

Cally: It's the limiter that's doing this. He's been forced to cope with it by keeping his anger below the surface and exploring new ways to relate to people.

Blake: But he's not free Cally.

Cally: I'm not making any judgement either way. All I can say is that the limiter has helped him to be a better person. At least for the moment.

Blake: And his relationships?

Cally: He's too confused for me to read, although I'm sure he respects and likes you.

Blake: Well that's good. Now. (pauses) Avon.

Cally: (laughs) Ah yes. Avon.

Blake: (smiles) This should be good.

Cally: Avon respects Vila's talent, but hates him for wasting time. He has no time for Gan and is treating his limiter problem as an intellectual exercise. He respects Jenna as a pilot, in fact his respect for her has grown the more he understands what she does. But he is concerned about her motives. He respects you as a leader but has no desire to be one of your followers.

Blake: (laughs) Everyone knows that.

Cally: He also doesn't think the intellectual basis of your ideology is sound. I know this because he said that to me a few days ago.

Blake: Fair enough.

Cally: (looks worried). It is Avon's relationship with me that worries me.

Blake: How so?

Cally: Everyone here on the Liberator knows that I am an empath, and everyone is wary about this. Avon's response to me, though, indicates some level of knowledge.

Blake: What do you mean?

Cally: He is very careful in what he says or does around me. He deliberately avoids certain lines of conversation, even words. And he's been getting better at it too, which means he's learned about Auronar psychic talents from somewhere. 

Blake: Okay. (pauses theatrically) And now what about Blake?

Cally: (pauses). Blake is scared but committed. He moves from exultation at the potential of the Liberator to despair at not getting his way. He is mercenary in how he views the crew, Jenna is indispensible because she can pilot the ship. Vila is indispensible because of his talents as a thief. Gan might not be useful at all. He marvels at Avon's skills and yet wishes he could murder him.

Blake: Hmmm.

Cally: And of course he finds Cally indispensible for her psychic ability, including her skills in small unit combat.

(pause)

Cally: And also. You know. (shrugs shoulders)

Blake: (quietly) And Cally?

Cally: (pause) Cally finds Blake indispensible. And always has. (tears up).

Blake: (nods sadly) I know.

Dayna: What do you think? (Shows them cake).

Tarrant: It looks beautiful.

Dayna: Do you think he'll like it?

Tarrant: I think he will. He'll be up shortly.

Dayna: (places cake on table, grins) It's these times I love the most.

Tarrant: I agree, but it's not like we have a choice is there?

Dayna: How are you feeling Soolin?

Soolin: (blank) I am feeling happy.

Dayna and Tarrant: Hooray! (claps)

Dorian: Hello everyone. What's this? A cake? Looks beautiful. (takes a piece and eats) Yes very nice.

Tarrant: How was the basement?

Dorian: (in between bites) Good. Very good. I feel like a new man.

Tarrant: Yes you do.

Dayna: It's such a pity it wears off.

Dorian: Well let's make the most of it then. Tarrant?

Tarrant? Yes.

Dorian: Were you able to talk to any of your contacts?

Tarrant: Yes as a matter of fact I was.

Dorian: Well let's have it.

Tarrant: It seems that Blake has escaped from Cygnus Alpha on board an alien space ship that he calls the Liberator.

Dorian: An alien ship you say?

Tarrant: One of his crew is named Avon. Avon is known as a computer and electronics wizz and was sent to Cygnus Alpha because he stole a lot of money from the government.

Dorian: Ah yes I thought I remembered his name. Good work Tarrant. (Tarrant smiles) Do you have anything for me Dayna?

Dayna: Sorry. Only the cake.

Dorian: And Soolin do you have anything for me perchance?

Soolin: Servalan has freed a prisoner named Travis and given him a squadron of advanced pursuit ships to hunt down Blake.

(pause)

Tarrant: What? Not Commander Travis the war criminal?

Soolin: I don't know who he is.

Scene. A room inside the Liberator. A man is tied to a chair with a hood on. Blake and Cally walk in. Blake takes the hood off. It is Declan, Servalan's asistant.

Declan: Ah. Well.... hello.

Blake: Do you know where you are?

Declan: Well I know your face. You're Blake. And gathering from the strange look of the architecture around me, I suppose I must be on the Liberator.

Blake: (sits down) Good guess.

Declan: (looks at Cally) I don't know who you are. I'm at a loss as to how I got here. One moment I was in my bunk on the shuttle. Then there was a struggle. The next moment I'm here. 

Blake: Do you know why you're here?

Declan: Well. I suppose being the assistant to the Supreme Commander is likely to be the reason. Um. Are you going to kill me?

Cally: We don't know yet.

Declan: Well that's not a positive development. I take it then that you want information?

Blake: (to Cally) He is smart isn't he?

Declan: I do need to point out that torture isn't exactly reliable.

Cally: Oh this will be worse than torture.

Declan: I... what does that mean?

Blake: Cally here is from Auron. She has psychic abilities.

Declan (interested): Oh I have heard of this. There are some from Auron who have the ability to tell if someone is lying or not. I've always wondered if that was a fairy story.

Blake: It's actually much worse than that.

Declan: Oh.

Blake: It's not enough just to ask questions and see whether you're lying.

Cally: It's getting inside your head and extracting information that you're with-holding.

(Cally places her hands over Declan's head. Declan begins screaming.)

Scene: The deck of the Liberator. Jenna is asleep in her chair. Avon enters.

Avon: Jenna!

(Jenna wakes up. Looks annoyed).

Avon: I've often heard that pilots need their sleep.

Jenna: True. (yawns).

Avon: I need to spend some time at the controls - get myself acquainted with how to fly the ship.

Jenna: Not at the moment. We're refueling. Zen, exterior scan.

(A view of the area outside of the Liberator. There is brown mist flying by).

Avon: Where are we?

Jenna: I found an uncharted Brown Dwarf. I decided to see if we can refuel there too. We're in the Chromosphere.

Avon: So we've stopped. I thought so. How is the refueling going?

Jenna: Just as quickly as a Red Dwarf.

Avon: The coronal mass collectors? Are they functioning well?

Jenna: So far yes.

Avon: Good.

Jenna: You know there are twice as many Brown Dwarfs in the galaxy as there are Red Dwarfs. Most of them haven't been charted yet. And then there's the possibility of rogue gas giants. There's twice as many of them again than Brown Dwarfs.

Avon: We can refuel much quicker at main sequence stars.

Jenna: Yes but all main sequence stars are charted and have a populated planet. If we need to lay low for a while, it would be handy to know where uncharted Brown Dwarfs and Gas Giants are.

Avon: (thinks) Yes. You're probably right. But I think we also would need our own charted space lanes.

Jenna: That would take time. The Liberator can certainly map its own lanes faster than anything the Federation has, but you're still talking about months of work.

Avon: The Federation Navy have their own secret lanes. Everyone knows that.

Jenna: (pointedly) Smugglers, however, have their own maps.

(Avon looks at Jenna)

Jenna: We could buy some smuggler charts.

Avon: (pauses) Do smugglers like gold?

Jenna: Oh yes.

Notes

* Okay, yes. Cally/Blake. I did this to show that these two experienced Guerilla fighters had spent time with one another in the past. At this point I want the nature of their romantic history to be vague. I also want it rooted in something they both find very sad, possibly linked to the death of Blake's wife and child. They both have a high regard and respect for the others' abilities, as well as trust. The way I've viewed Cally is very different to Jan Chappell's portrayal in B7:TOS. She has some muscle, and a practical hairstyle and clothing style, as would befit someone who is used to living off the land, hiding from the enemy.
* I think the makeup of the universe is that 50% of all stars are Red Dwarves. But Brown Dwarves (which arent strictly stars) outnumber Red Dwarves by 100%. And Rogue Gas Giants outnumber Brown Dwarves by 100%. The presence of so many Rogue Gas Giants and Brown Dwarves will give the Liberator places to refuel.
* Star Lanes are essentialy mapped areas of the galaxy where ships can travel at full speed. You don't want to hit an asteroid or something as you're traveling.",1,1735282919.0,Blakes7Reimagined,0,1.0,False

Why is it the greatest TV show of all time? Sit back, grab your herbal tea, and let me explain.

First, the setting. Virgin River is not just a town; it‚Äôs a character. Its foggy mornings, serene rivers, and impossibly photogenic landscapes remind us that even nature knows how to serve a look. It‚Äôs as if the Hallmark Channel and a tourism board had a love child, and that child grew up to star in its own Instagram reel.

Then, there‚Äôs the drama. Oh, the drama! Every episode serves up enough twists and turns to keep chiropractors in business. Jack‚Äôs bar is essentially a therapy clinic with alcohol, and Mel‚Äôs medical clinic is the epicenter of small-town dysfunction. Who needs big-city scandals when you‚Äôve got Virgin River‚Äôs peculiar combination of sudden medical emergencies, secret babies, and love triangles so sharp they could cut glass?

Let‚Äôs talk characters. Jack Sheridan is the brooding, flannel-clad dreamboat every romance novel hero aspires to be, while Mel Monroe is the queen of resilience, rocking scrubs like they‚Äôre couture. And Doc Mullins? The grumpy-but-lovable grandpa figure whose every grumble is a sermon on life. Don‚Äôt even get me started on Hope‚Äîher meddling could power a wind turbine.

And the plot holes! Virgin River has so many loose threads and implausible timelines that it‚Äôs essentially a magic carpet ride of storytelling. But instead of complaining, we gleefully hop aboard because logic is for lesser shows.

Finally, Virgin River is the greatest because it offers something rare: unapologetic sincerity. In a world of gritty dramas and antiheroes, this show reminds us that sometimes all we need is a town where everyone knows your name‚Äîand your business. It‚Äôs cozy chaos at its finest, and honestly, who wouldn‚Äôt want to live in a place where even a minor fender bender can spark an existential crisis?

So yes, Virgin River isn‚Äôt just a TV show. It‚Äôs a lifestyle, a fever dream, and a collective hug from a flannel-wrapped universe. Greatest of all time? Absolutely.",5,1735282843.0,VirginRiverNetflix,5,0.78,False

1hn99k1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Postinterestingnews/comments/1hn99k1/affordable_press_release_agency_for_small/,Affordable Press Release Agency for Small Businesses,"As a small business owner, the phrase getting your name out there can sound both exhilarating and intimidating. With a million marketing options at your disposal, you might be wondering how best to position your brand in an increasingly crowded marketplace. If you're ready to take that leap, working with an affordable press release agency can make all the difference.

Understanding Press Releases: A Necessity for Small Businesses

When I first launched my craft coffee shop, I remember feeling overwhelmed by the idea of public relations. I had my coffee beans, my carefully curated menu, and a buzz in the community, but how could I translate that into media coverage? That's when I stumbled into the world of press releases.

A [press release](https://indnewswire.com/) is a written statement used to announce something important from your business like a new product launch, a store opening, or even community involvement. Picture it as a gateway: a well-crafted press release can introduce your small business to a much larger audience.

Why Choose an Affordable Press Release Agency?

Now, let's talk about cost. As a small business owner, you're likely navigating a tight budget. That's where an affordable press release agency comes in. While hiring big public relations firms can cost thousands, there are many agencies that cater specifically to small businesses without sacrificing quality.

Personal Experience: Finding Value

When I was looking for help, I initially reached out to what I thought were big-name [PR agencies](https://indnewswire.com/press-release-distribution-on-digital-journal/). Their fees sent me into a tailspin. Eventually, I discovered a local agency that specialized in helping small businesses. For a fraction of what I would have paid elsewhere, they crafted a stunning press release that not only highlighted my coffee shop's unique offerings but also told a story.

I recall our first interaction vividly. They took the time to understand my vision and values, and it felt more like a casual coffee chat than a formal business meeting. This personal relationship made all the difference I felt valued not just as a client, but as a fellow entrepreneur.

What to Look for in an Affordable Agency

Choosing the right [press release agency](https://indnewswire.com/press-release-distribution-on-digital-journal/) involves more than just looking at costs. Here are some key factors to consider:

1. Experience with Small Businesses

Not all agencies understand the unique struggles and strengths of small businesses. Look for agencies with a track record of helping similar-sized companies. You want someone who knows how to amplify your message without breaking the bank.

2. Customized Services

A cookie-cutter approach won't do you any favours. Choose an agency that offers tailored solutions that reflect your brand's identity and message. Can they work with you to draft your press release, or do they only have templates? Ask these questions before you commit.

3. Distribution Networks

Not only should the agency write your press release, but they should also have strong media connections for distribution. A good agency will have a robust list of contacts that can help get your news in front of the right people.

4. Transparent Pricing

Transparency is crucial. Be clear about what services you are paying for and ensure there are no hidden fees. I remember the first time I encountered a pricing structure that included everything upfront; it felt like a breath of fresh air.

Creating a Successful Press Release

Now that you've decided to work with an affordable agency, how can you ensure your press release stands out? Here are some insights:

1. Focus on Newsworthiness

What makes your announcement newsworthy? Reflect on beneficial angles are you collaborating with a local charity, introducing a groundbreaking product, or expanding your services? Make sure you convey why your story matters.

2. Craft an Engaging Headline

Your headline is your first impression. It should be catchy and concise, drawing readers in. For instance, instead of New Menu Items at Joe's Coffee Shop, why not try Joe's Coffee Shop Unveils Seasonal Menu Featuring Local Ingredients?

3. Provide Relevant Quotes

Incorporate quotes from you or your team members to add authenticity and emotion. When my coffee shop launched our eco-friendly initiative, we included a quote about our commitment to sustainability. It fostered a connection with our audience.

4. Include Clear Calls to Action

What do you want your readers to do after they read your announcement? Include calls to action like visiting your website, joining an event, or contacting you for more information.

Conclusion: Invest in Your Story

From my experience, the best investments often come with the greatest stories. When you partner with an [affordable press release agency](https://indnewswire.com/press-release-distribution-on-digital-journal/), you're not just paying for a service; you're investing in the growth of your story. Imagine the satisfaction I felt watching my press release generate buzz in the local media, ultimately drawing new customers through my doors.So, if you're a small business owner with a vision but limited resources, don't shy away from exploring the world of press releases. An affordable press release agency could be your ticket to gaining the exposure your brand deserves!

Follow the feeling of relief. That‚Äôs your way.  
  
Many times, we complicate our spiritual journey because we forget what we truly need to focus on. We find ourselves confused and overwhelmed.  
  
We try different techniques‚Äîmeditating, visualizing, affirming, journaling‚Äîand yet, we often realize that we‚Äôre not sure what we‚Äôre actually doing.  
  
The problem lies in forgetting what really matters. What are we chasing? What do we truly desire?  
  
What we truly desire is the feeling of relief. The feeling of inner harmony and peace. The feeling of alignment within ourselves.  
  
Follow what brings you relief. Follow what brings you peace and harmony. That is your path.  
  
If you simply do that, everything else will fall into place.  
  
So, what is bringing you peace today? Is it sipping your morning coffee or tea? Or is it something else? Do that.  
  
We think these simple acts don‚Äôt matter‚Äîthat spirituality is about hard, complicated things like inner work, shadow work, visualization, manifestation, or raising your vibration.  
  
But no, real spirituality lies in the simple things.  
  
It‚Äôs about prioritizing your inner harmony. Choosing inner peace. Opting for joy and bliss in this moment. This is the grand choice.  
  
When you follow what brings you peace and relief, you are walking your soul path.  
  
By allowing yourself to feel peace and relief in this moment, you are surrendering to the now. You are embracing and enjoying this moment. You are enjoying life.  
  
Isn‚Äôt that what we‚Äôre supposed to do? Enjoy life!  
  
How have we forgotten this? When did we lose the simple understanding we had as children?  
  
As children, we always followed our joy, our bliss. We savored the present moment, making the best of it. That‚Äôs how we‚Äôre meant to live.  
  
We are supposed to enjoy the present moment.  
  
We are meant to choose the things that bring us joy, peace, relief, and make us feel good. That is the spiritual path.  
  
The spiritual path is all about choosing harmony and peace. As you do, everything starts to fall into place.  
  
When you choose to enjoy the present moment, you align with the universe.  
  
Are you ready to embrace the unknown, trust the universe, and step fully into alignment with your soul‚Äôs purpose?  
  
What if the simplest way to find your spiritual path has been right in front of you all along?  
  
If fear, doubt, or emotional triggers have been holding you back from surrendering to life‚Äôs divine flow, know this: it doesn‚Äôt have to be complicated. Your spiritual journey is about following what brings you peace, relief, and harmony in the present moment.  
  
As a spiritual awakening coach and teacher of Wizard Consciousness, I‚Äôve guided many souls like you to reconnect with their inner knowing, transmute challenges into healing, and create lives filled with magic, alignment, and peace.

The crazy part is that I'm completely fine. My teeth or gum don't hurt at all and I don't know if it's just because me being young and I will suffer later or I'll continue being ok. I'm afraid if I get in the habit It'll have an unintended side effect.
My diet is pretty average, not vegan but not a bear, not the sugar chugger type but not completely healthy. Usually I drink water after breakfast and before sleep and I drink like 2-3 cups of tea a day maybe sometimes coffee.

So yeah how the hell am I fine and wtf should I do? Thank you",2,1735280845.0,AskDocs,8,0.75,False
1hn8txs,https://www.reddit.com/r/millenials/comments/1hn8txs/at_what_age_do_people_prefer_staying_in_over/,At what age do people prefer staying in over going out?,"I‚Äôm 26, single, and I went to a karaoke bar (sometimes two)  for 4 months straight, and ofc I took a little break here and there. And to add more perspective, I also don‚Äôt drink. I turned 26 back in late November and maybe it‚Äôs a fall/winter thing but honestly, the idea of going out late sounds nice but then when you put into consideration that it‚Äôs almost 9-10 PM, then you say to yourself ‚Äúit feels too late to go out‚Äù. The loud music, sometimes obnoxious people you don‚Äôt really connect with, the partying/drinking aspect being boring, can be draining. 

I‚Äôm more of a coffee shop/friend group game night type of guy as opposed to getting hammered and staying up till 1 or 2 AM *every weekend* . With everything, there‚Äôs a balance. I enjoy going out but not super late at night (maybe in the summer time that‚Äôll change since I‚Äôm a little more extroverted around then). 

Plus I‚Äôve always loved having time alone and being at home working on my hobbies or playing video games with my two cats on my lap. And as far as dating goes, I‚Äôm just going with the flow and just letting things happen organically.

So my other question to all you is: is this part of getting older? Or is this just a phase we all go through?",4,1735280821.0,millenials,6,0.75,False

My 32 F boyfriend of 3 years, 43 M, and I are struggling. We got pregnant after our first week together. We have made it work pretty well, considering. However, I just feel like he is a friend or roommate. I don't feel loved or supported, not really. He's gone all the time travels for work. Im not concerned about cheating, just more like I realize how much easier it is when he is gone. I have one less person to take care of. Im a SAHM, and I truly appreciate how hard he works for us. I just wish I could get some care and compassion and really see that he loves me. I always try to have dinner ready when he gets home from work when he's local. When he's gone, I try to have something nice made for dinner when he comes home. The house picked up and pj's to change into after his shower. I make him his coffee in the mornings on the weekends. I plate his food and serve it to him. I make sure he's got a result after a late night or lunches when I can. I try so hard to show this man love care and appreciation. I feel like I get none of it in return. Yes, he pays the bills, but I handle everything else. He is great at being a fun and playful dad but can also be distracted and doesn't really do the actual parenting. If im gone, which is usually for a hair appt a couple times a year, I'll be gone for hours, and yes, our son is looked after, but my home is destroyed, not one finger lifted in the home. He says I just need to tell him what to do, and he will do it. Which is kind of true, but a lot of times, it's not to my standard or pretty half assed so it's just easier to do it myself. I have to delegate the schedule and coordinate everything. He doesn't want to get up and get our son out and active to ensure nap time happens but then gets frustrated because he won't nap, which he knew would happen.. or gets frustrated because of adhering to a schedule of getting up and out every morning a park mall store somewhere he can walk around and get energy out. The schedule is how I survive. I live in a state with no family, no real friends I have made, and no childcare. It is me and me alone 24/7. The schedule and nap are how I maintain my sanity. Im also in online college for accounting. Im drowning all the time, and I can't keep going like this. Intimacy is lacking because I feel like he is another child of mine. I don't feel loved and affection most of the time, so when I come to bed and he tells me to take my pants off or start trying to initiate sex I have no interest. That's the night I can go to bed with him, which is hit and miss. Im usually up doing school or chores I can't get done during the day. I delivered our son alone, took him home from the nicu alone, and battled his first stomach bug and fever alone. Other than money, I just dont see the point anymore. I want love, and if that's not what we have, I'd rather just do it alone. I can at least count on myself. I want it to work but I cant make it work alone. If im the only one putting in effort this won't go anywhere. Anytime we communicate about it he says it's how stressful his job is. Im not asking for much. Help me pick up before bed. Help with the dishes. Maybe offer me an opportunity to get out of the house and actually come home to a clean home and dinner. I just want effort and time. ",1,1735280526.0,Mommit,1,0.67,False
