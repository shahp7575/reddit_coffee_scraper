chapter 1: the arrival

the morning was dragging like it always did, the office building sitting quiet except for the hum of the flickering fluorescent lights overhead. dust particles floated lazily in the shafts of sunlight struggling through the blinds. everything smelled like old coffee and stale paperwork, a place where dreams came to die—or just get put on hold till quitting time.

the elevator dinged and the doors slid open with that familiar creak. doakes was the first to step out, his heavy boots thudding against the linoleum like a storm rolling in. his face was already set in that “don’t talk to me” scowl, clutching his chipped mug like it was a lifeline. he muttered under his breath about the lousy coffee and the idiots he had to deal with. no one dared to disagree.

clark kent followed behind, trying his best to blend in. his glasses were slightly crooked and his trench coat hung loose, barely hiding the faint bulge of his iconic red and blue underneath. he adjusted his tie nervously and scanned the room like he was expecting trouble, which, honestly, in this office was the least you could expect.

dexter morgan came in next, calm and collected as always, eyes sharp and cold. there was something unnerving about the way he looked at people, like he was analyzing every flaw and secret they tried to hide. people gave him space, and for once, doakes nodded in quiet respect—though he’d never admit it.

bruce wayne walked in like he owned the place—which, honestly, he probably did. designer suit pressed perfectly, a confident smirk playing on his lips. he didn’t bother with small talk, already making mental notes on how to buy the building, the company, maybe the entire block if he felt like it.

angel bautista brought some warmth into the room, carrying a tray with fresh cafecito and pastelitos. his smile was genuine, and the smell of coffee was like a tiny rebellion against the brewing storm.

then jesse pinkman exploded through the door like a firecracker, wild eyes scanning, voice loud. “yo who the hell stole my snacks?” chaos started in an instant. patrick bateman sipped his coffee, that creepy smile on his face like he was enjoying the madness a little too much. happy gilmore swung an invisible golf club and nearly knocked over a lamp.

luke skywalker appeared in a flash of light, lightsaber hanging at his side, muttering about “the force being off.” peter parker crawled along the walls, spider-sense twitching at every sound. doomguy stomped in with a grim look, ready for war. goku floated in, muscles tense, a grin on his face like he wanted to throw down just for fun.

optimus prime’s hologram flickered to life, calm and commanding. peter griffin tripped over the threshold, sending a box of donuts flying. solid snake melted into the vents, eyes sharp. ronaldo juggled a soccer ball in the hall, carefree. rick sanchez stumbled in, flask in hand, mumbling about portals and dimension hopping. dr strange appeared in a swirl of magic, looking exhausted. baymax quietly rolled in, scanning everyone’s health with his soft robotic voice.

harrison and hank looked overwhelmed and suspicious as fernando alonso drifted in on an office chair like he was in a race. special agent lundy pulled out a folder, already making notes on the chaos unfolding.

phoenix wright shouted “OBJECTION!” at no one in particular, as if trying to bring order with just his voice.

and then, barely noticeable, a mosquito buzzed in and landed on doakes’s mug.

and it never left.



chapter 2: the mosquito

the office had barely settled from the chaos of that morning when a new menace arrived — small, buzzing, and utterly relentless. the mosquito. a tiny, annoying bloodsucker nobody wanted but nobody could ignore.

it slipped through the cracked window, unseen by most, but doakes immediately caught sight of it. the damn thing landed on his chipped mug like it owned the place, and he swatted at it with a growl, but it dodged him like a ghost. that was just the start.

goku was the first to really feel its sting. a tiny prick on his arm, but even he let out a sharp grunt, irritation flickering in his usually calm grin. doomguy immediately pulled out his massive gun and fired several shots. the mosquito zigged and zagged, barely touched, buzzing louder as if mocking the assault.

dr strange muttered ancient incantations, hands weaving through the air to trap the pest in magical bindings. but the mosquito slipped through cracks in his spells like a shadow, immune to every trick. baymax moved carefully among the desks, scanning every human for bites and bruises, trying to soothe the itch with his gentle voice and medical skills.

doakes was losing his mind. every time he swung a fist or a rolled-up paper at the little pest, it disappeared, only to return moments later with a vengeance. his cursing filled the air, louder than the buzz.

clark kent adjusted his glasses, furrowing his brow. he used his x-ray vision to locate the pest, but the mosquito was just a blur, a tiny flicker impossible to catch. rick sanchez stumbled in from the breakroom, flask in hand, and squinted at the chaos. “that thing’s not just a mosquito, man, it’s like a micro god or some shit,” he muttered, slurring words as he pulled out weird gadgets from his bag.

solid snake laid traps in the vents, setting tiny nets and traps designed for small animals, but the mosquito was smarter than any trap. it buzzed free every time, laughing in its own tiny way.

then came the pest control guy — normal in every way, calm but serious. he walked in with a tennis racket rigged with electric wires and a canister of anti-mosquito gas. “i’m here to end this,” he said, voice steady despite the madness.

the battle began. pest control guy chased the mosquito through desks, vents, and filing cabinets, releasing gas and swinging his racket. the mosquito danced around every attack with impossible speed, buzzing in their ears, biting anyone who got close.

the office filled with smoke and tension. people evacuated their desks, coughing and swatting, watching the ridiculous fight unfold like a bad action movie.

but the mosquito survived.

and pest control guy limped out, coughing, eyes wide with something between fear and respect.

“it whispered to me,” he said quietly, before disappearing down the hallway, promising to return. the fight was far from over.

meanwhile, everyone else in the office scratched and swatted, their clothes covered in tiny red bites. the mood was tense, itchy, and electric.

the mosquito had become the new ruler of the office.



chapter 3: the donut box

the office was already a mess. that annoying mosquito buzzing around doakes’s mug like it owned the place, the strange fights, the odd people—all of it was normal now. or as normal as this crazy place could get.

then out of nowhere, no warning, no sign, just BAM. sitting right in the middle of the breakroom table, a pristine white box appeared like some kind of magic trick. no footsteps, no delivery guy, no email, no nothing. just there. like someone dropped it from another universe or slipped it through a portal nobody saw.

six donuts inside. six perfect donuts. glazed just right, some sprinkled with rainbow stuff, others dusted with cinnamon. they looked too good. too clean. like they didn’t belong in this dusty, stale office filled with burnt coffee and bad vibes.

everyone just stared. no one moved. it was like the box sucked the air out of the room.

jesse pinkman was the first to break the silence, stomach growling like it wanted to eat him alive. “yo, what the heck, are these for real?” he said, eyes wide, fingers twitching as he grabbed the chocolate-glazed donut like it was a lifeline. he bit down hard, ignoring the sticky glaze that dripped all over his hand.

peter parker’s spider-sense was screaming. he crawled closer, eyes darting all around like he was hunting for traps. he carefully webbed one donut to the fridge, whispering, “gonna save this… for later.” as if the donuts might vanish into thin air or explode or some crazy stuff.

goku? man just grinned like he hit the jackpot and shoved two donuts in his mouth before anyone could stop him. “these taste like victory,” he said between bites, muscles flexing like he just powered up.

ronaldo kicked one donut like it was a soccer ball, sending it flying into the ceiling tiles. everyone’s eyes followed it but the donut disappeared like a ghost. nobody knew where it went and that little mystery sent a shiver down everyone’s spines.

patrick bateman leaned back in his chair, smirk curling up like a shark smelling blood. “someone’s messing with us,” he said real quiet but sharp as hell. “and it’s not a joke.”

phoenix wright slammed his fist on the table, papers scattering everywhere. “we need answers! who left this box here? who touched the donuts? witnesses, evidence, NOW!”

the office lost it again. jesse blamed happy gilmore for stealing the last donut, happy blamed luke skywalker for using the force to swipe snacks. clark kent tried to calm things down, adjusting his crooked glasses nervously, but even he looked like he was ready to run away.

next morning? same box. same six perfect donuts. just sitting there like taunting everyone. no note. no clue. just mocking them all.

rumors spread faster than wildfire. cursed donuts? magical sweets? rick sanchez’s latest science mistake? or some dark stuff nobody wanted to say out loud.

doakes swore the box moved when no one looked. “that thing’s alive,” he growled, pounding his fist on the table like he wanted to smash it to bits.

angel bautista tried to keep the peace, bringing fresh coffee and telling everyone to chill, but even his calm voice shook a little. the mosquito bites everyone had didn’t help, making the office feel like a war zone.

everyone wanted the donuts but nobody trusted them.

the mystery stuck around like the glaze stuck to your fingers after one bite.

and somewhere, watching from the shadows, someone smiled.

the donut box wasn’t just donuts anymore.

it was a message.

a warning.

the start of some messed up stuff no one was ready for.

chapter 4: tension rising

the office had this weird stillness that wasn’t peaceful at all. it was the kind of quiet that makes you want to look over your shoulder every two seconds like something bad’s about to jump out and slap you. the fluorescent lights flickered with that usual annoying buzz, the smell of burnt coffee mixed with stale air hanging thick. doakes sat at his desk, fists clenched tight around his chipped mug, eyes burning with frustration as the mosquito buzzed endlessly near him, like some tiny demon with no plans to quit.

the donut box sat right there on the breakroom table like it owned the place. six perfect donuts, glazed and sprinkled just right, each one looking almost too perfect. the kind of thing you’d see on a fancy bakery shelf, not some grimy office table surrounded by chaos and weirdos. nobody touched it. nobody dared. it was like the box carried some invisible weight, a threat that made the room hold its breath.

doakes got up, pacing like a caged animal. “who the hell leaves a box like this with no note, no warning? what’s the point? it’s some kind of sick joke or a message,” he growled low, voice rough like gravel. he slammed his fist down on the table but the box didn’t move, just sat there, mocking him with its silence.

clark kent, usually the picture of calm, looked anything but. his fingers hovered over the keyboard, typing without really thinking, eyes flickering to the box every few seconds. his glasses kept slipping down his nose as if they were trying to shield him from whatever was coming. even clark felt the weight pressing down like a storm cloud ready to burst.

jesse pinkman was quieter than usual. no wild outbursts, no angry yelling, just sitting in the corner with a half-eaten donut he swiped when no one was watching. his eyes darted nervously around, like he was waiting for something or someone to jump out and ruin everything. “this ain’t just some random snack showing up,” he muttered, voice low but steady. “it’s a message. someone wants us off balance, maybe scared, maybe confused.”

patrick bateman stood by the window, arms crossed, eyes sharp and cold like a shark sizing up prey. “it’s a game,” he said softly but with deadly certainty. “we’re pawns in someone else’s plan. whoever dropped that box wants control, wants us distracted and vulnerable.”

phoenix wright was already trying to take charge, pulling people together, papers in hand. “we need to figure out who’s watching us, who’s behind this,” he said with urgency. “this isn’t about donuts. it’s about power. about control. we can’t just sit here waiting.”

rick was slouched in his chair, flask barely leaving his lips. “man, y’all slow as hell,” he mumbled, eyes half-lidded. “that box ain’t just snacks. it’s some kinda trap. like they wanna see how messed up we get. testin’ us or some shit.”

goku cracked his fingers, looking ready but chill. “if it comes to a fight, cool. but first we gotta find who put this mess here. then we settle it.”

the whole office felt heavy, like you could cut the tension with anything. people glanced sideways, whisperin’ like they didn’t wanna get caught sayin’ too much. trust? nah, that was gone. everyone watching everyone else, trying to figure out who’d snap first.

angel bautista moved around, bringing coffee and trying to calm things down. even his usual calm sounded shaky, like he was holdin’ it together by a thread. those damn mosquito bites didn’t help—everyone was scratchin’ and jumpy, like the tiniest thing could set off a full blown fight.


special agent lundy pulled out a folder filled with notes and pictures, trying to piece together whatever clues they could find. “we need to watch for anything unusual,” he said, eyes scanning the room like a hawk. “someone is sending us a message, and we have to figure out what before it’s too late.”

harrison and hank shared a worried look, both knowing this was bigger than any of them expected. fernando alonso spun in his office chair nervously, breaking the tension with a forced laugh that didn’t reach his eyes.

and through it all, the mosquito kept buzzing near doakes, relentless and stubborn, a reminder that even the smallest things could drive a whole place mad.

the donut box wasn’t just sitting there anymore.

it was waiting.

watching.

calculating.

and everyone felt it.

something was coming.

something no one was ready for.

the start of a nightmare none of them could escape.

1mkamfc,https://www.reddit.com/r/kaneff/comments/1mkamfc/2211_sherobee_road/,2211 Sherobee Road,"This thread is in regard to The Kaneff Group's rental property located at 2211 Sherobee Road, L5A 2H5, Mississauga. Like most Kaneff properties, the building is in absolute abysmal disarray. Here is my personal experience:

  
1. The entire building is INFESTED with ROACHES / BED BUGS / RODENTS

Do not get me started on the cockroaches or bed bugs. No matter how many times the unit is treated. they always come back. They always come back, because they're never really gone. Units are selectively treated, so the ones that survive during treatments migrate from one unit to another unit. The building is utterly and completely infested with both cockroaches and bed bugs, from top to bottom. Both insects can be found in units, common areas, lobbies, basement areas, and even the parking garage. I live on a higher floor, so I haven't personally experienced it, but the lower levels seem to have some sort of mice/rat infestation, especially units closer to the garage disposal chute as per my neighbours in the lower units.

2. External:

Upon visiting the property, you will notice a neglected and dilapidated landscape. The parking lot, as well as the pathways (if any) are faulty, littered with cracks and potholes. The drive way onto the property is too small for 2 vehicles to pass each other comfortably. The driveway immediately diverges near the entrance to lead visitors to either the front entrance of the building, or the parking lot behind the building. If you continue to the front entrance, the path immediately diverges again to allow access to the front entrance or to allow access to the underground parking garage. These 3 converging paths, being the only exit/entrance to the property contribute to heavy congestion during busy hours. There is also a defunct unmaintained tennis court slightly concealed by vegetation overgrowth in front of the building that is encompassed by fencing that is rusted beyond belief. There is a stairwell on both sides of the tennis court filled with garbage that lead underground and would allow residents access to the parking garage if it didn't offer a chance of contracting some form of hepatitis. There are 4 industrial grade garbage bins and 6 industrial grade recycling bins that are located at the back of the building for residents to put their garbage beside and around rather than inside due to the locks on top of the bins. These bins are never cleaned, and emit a smell fouler than sun soaked shit that lingers constantly in airlock of the back entrance of the building.

3. Internal:

A. Underground:  
The dim and dark underground parking garage is a prime mugging location as it's easily accessible to non-residents and severely under lit. It also smells like carbon monoxide poisoning and cigarettes due to the poor air circulation/ventilation and residents that idle their cars while enjoying a cancer stick. It's about $75/monthly to risk having your car stolen in the above ground lot, or a $90/monthly to risk getting mugged and having your car stolen underground. Upon leaving the parking garage, you enter a yellow 90s McDonald's floor tiled, water stained ceiling tiled, smelly basement common area. The fumes from the parking garage as well as the fumes from the laundry room meet here to combine and create one of the most bizarre and unbreathable airs known to man. The basement then offers some additional storage at the cost of an arm and a leg. As well, it also boasts a non-functional gym, and disgusting laundry room. The gym is inaccessible, but advertised as an amenity for residents. The laundry room is stout with broken cheap laundry machines that eat your money when they do or do not decide to actually function. There used to be bathroom that was accessible to residents but has now since because accessible only to Kaneff staff for the days they stop by to get absolutely nothing done.

B. Entrance & Lobby:  
Approaching the building, you will find yourself fucked if you're handicapped. Neither of the handicap buttons, both outside and in the airlock to enter the building function. If you're visiting the building, you will also find yourself fucked. The console for the electronic intercom is perpetually broken, always in a state of either glitched or frozen. If you happen to be a resident, own the individual fob for your unit, and are not handicapped, only then you will finally have the ability to access the building. Upon entering the building, once again you will find yourself fucked. There are 3 elevators to the 25-story building; 1 elevator which is either reserved for Kaneff staff or residents constantly moving into or out of this shithole, 1 elevator which is always out of order, and 1 elevator that you will have to wait for and squeeze into with whatever residents wait along side you / have been picked up from the basement. In terms of amenities, there is an vacant administration office that can't help you with anything, and a mailroom with which mail boxes can be accessed by any key due to the locks disintegrating from use and abuse. Almost everything in the building is painted in either an off-white colour that has yellowed, or a beautiful pine green colour that gets paired alongside a shit brown colour. On a positive note, there is a waiting area in the lobby with some chairs, and they recently added a new coffee table.

C. Hallways:  
After exiting the packed elevator, you are greeted by directional signage that tells you where to go to access the unit number you're looking, that was only added last year. Prior to this, you had to gamble if you were getting off on the right floor, after the only available elevator leaves and you turn the corner to read the first apartment number to find out if you guessed correctly. The walls of the hallways on each floor are painted off-white, accented by that shit brown colour painted in vertical uneven, messy stripes. I cannot express how much these walls look like the side of a toilet that has overflowed with pure shit. The hallways are also lined with a pine green carpet with an ugly design from what looks like the 1970's. These carpets are not well maintained, are stained beyond recognition, and usually sport the deceased bodies of an assortment insects, but primarily cockroaches and bedbugs.

4. Apartments:  
  
Upon entering most units, you will find the kitchen either immediately to the left or the right, opposite the living room area. There is no vestibule, closet, or foyer entrance area for your shoes, jackets, or other outdoor wear. The units are large, spacious, and dawn the classic, cheap, parquet flooring / popcorn ceiling mix. The views are obscured by weathered and dirty windows. The kitchen resembles a mix of terrible design, and thoughtless processes. Shallow sinks, leaky faucets/pipes, dim lighting. cheap old appliances, worn down cabinetry, and smells of which the origins cannot be traced. There is no central air in the units, so during the summer the units get extremely hot. There is a baseboard heating system that produces a smelly heat in the winter, but it produces the bare minimum heat on colder winter days, or over produces heat and cooks you alive on warmer winter days, there is no in-between. It appears that the unit has the ability to adjust the temperature, as there is a thermostat in the unit, but it's not connected to anything. The bathrooms are falling apart, with constant repair visits due to leaks leading into units below or above. The paint in the bathroom peels due to the lack of ventilation and humidity buildup. Even if you air it out with a fan, the bathrooms have a perpetual musk to them that makes them difficult to be in for longer than 10 - 15 minutes. The shower is disgusting, with moldy caulk around tiles that have been re-caulked several times to conceal mold only for the mold to regrow over top the new caulk. Faucets and shower head constantly break off and get replaced with the same old models from other units. Replacements break off within a year or two.

TLDR Review:  
Quality of Life: 1 / 10  
Amenities: 1.5 / 10 (half star for the new coffee table in lobby)  
Cleanliness: 0.5 / 10  
Company: 0 / 10

1mkamc4,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedAndTested/comments/1mkamc4/should_you_upgrade_to_the_best_coffee_maker/,Should You Upgrade to the Best Coffee Maker Keurig K-Duo Review,"Testing the Keurig K-Duo Special Edition felt like stepping into a coffee lover's dream. As someone perpetually attached to a mug of coffee, this dual-function coffee maker had me intrigued from day one. The versatility of brewing both single-serve pods and carafes of coffee gave me the flexibility to handle my demanding caffeine needs while also accommodating family or friends during gatherings. The sleek silver design fit perfectly on my countertop, complementing my kitchen decor rather than clashing with it. It’s surprising how much joy a good-looking appliance can bring, especially one you're bound to use daily.

**Design That Speaks Volumes**  
The aesthetic appeal of this coffee maker instantly caught my eye. The silver finish is not just shiny for vanity's sake—it genuinely looks high-end and adds a refined element to the kitchen. Despite its somewhat bulky dimensions (12.76 x 10.94 x 12.92 inches), it doesn't overwhelm the countertop space. The easy-to-remove 60oz water reservoir was another welcome perk that made my mornings less chaotic since multiple refills weren’t necessary every day. There’s something calming about appliances that simplify your life instead of complicating it.  

**Brew Options for Every Mood and Occasion**  
One of the stellar **winning points** of this coffee maker is its ability to brew both single cups and carafes, making it a perfect fit for large families or frequent hosts. I tested 6oz, 10oz, and 12-cup carafe settings, and the machine delivered consistently smooth brews each time. Using ground coffee for the carafe or K-Cup pods for individual cups wasn’t just a gimmick but an incredibly helpful feature to switch between depending on the situation. The Strong Brew button really came through when I needed that extra jolt during late-night work sessions—those extra-bold cups were chef’s kiss!

- Prepares single-serve coffee and carafes equally well.  
- Includes multiple brew sizes (6oz, 8oz, 10oz cups, and 6–12 cup carafes).  
- Strong Brew button delivers richer, bolder flavor.  

**[Check Keurig K-Duo Special Edition price on Amazon.](https://coolpromoproducts.com/p/b095xdqpzc/)**  

**Ease of Use and Clever Features**  
The Keurig K-Duo Special Edition is incredibly user-friendly despite having so many features. I particularly appreciated the Smart Start function, where the machine heats up and brews in one go—no waiting around while it preheats. The programmable carafe auto-brew is a game-changer for early mornings. Setting it the night before ensured my coffee was ready to go as soon as I stumbled groggily into the kitchen. And that Pause & Pour feature? A lifesaver when I couldn’t wait for the full carafe to brew. Being able to pour a cup mid-cycle without making a mess felt oddly empowering.

**Drawbacks Worth Mentioning**  
While I’ve sung its praises thus far, it’d be dishonest to pretend everything's flawless. One minor hurdle I encountered was the rather short cord length, which restricted where I could place it unless I used an extension. Another shortcoming was that the heating plate for the carafe cools down faster than I’d like, so keeping larger quantities warm for long durations takes a bit more effort. Additionally, it’s not the quietest coffee maker, especially during carafe brewing—but can I really fault it too much for working hard to keep me caffeinated?  

- Short cord length limits placement options.  
- Heating plate isn’t as effective after an hour.  

**Competing Products in the Market**  
Naturally, the Keurig K-Duo faces stiff competition from other models in its league. I compared it directly to the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, another dual-function coffee maker. While the Hamilton Beach offers some similar functions, the Keurig edges out with its sleek design and intuitive interface. On the flip side, though, the FlexBrew has a slightly larger carafe capacity and a slightly lower noise level during operation. The Ninja Hot & Cold Brewed System is another viable competitor, especially for tea drinkers. However, its extensive array of features can feel overwhelming to someone who primarily drinks coffee and doesn’t need all those frills. Simply put, when it comes to straightforward coffee brewing without too much complication, the Keurig K-Duo firmly holds its ground.

**Smart Spending**  
Compared to other coffee makers in its category, this machine balances cost with quality features pretty well. True, single-use pod machines might be slightly cheaper upfront, but the dual-functionality of brewing both single cups and carafes justifies the slight bump in price. The machine’s ability to use both K-Cups and ground coffee also means fewer ongoing costs, as you're not tied to a single brewing method. Overall, for what it delivers in versatility, style, and ease of use, it seems like a **smart spending** choice for coffee aficionados.

1mkam00,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1mkam00/married_to_a_man_obsessed_with_his_stepsister_for/,"Married to a Man Obsessed With His Stepsister | For what felt like the hundredth time, I tried to seduce my husband, Griffin Martin, only to be met with rejection once again.","For what felt like the hundredth time, I tried to seduce my husband, Griffin Martin, only to be met with rejection once again. The marriage remained unconsummated. Defeated, I picked up the phone and called my brother.

“I’m filing for divorce,” I said quietly.

He sighed. “Vivienne, I warned you. That man’s made of stone—no emotions, no passion. Just a lifeless suit with a pulse.”

I believed I could change him. I thought love would be enough. I was wrong.

After the call, I returned to my room—only to hear faint noises coming from Griffin’s private quarters. I followed the sound and froze at the sight.

Griffin, shirtless and on his knees, was moving in a slow, deliberate rhythm. For a second, I assumed he was with another woman. But no—it was a doll. A life-sized replica of his stepsister, Soraya.

In that instant, everything made sense. He didn’t turn away because he lacked desire. He turned away because his desire had never been meant for me.

What shattered me even more was what happened after: when Soraya struck me in the head with a wine bottle, leaving me with wounds that needed hundreds of stitches, Griffin showed no concern. All he did was ground her—for a day.

I’d had enough. Enough of being ignored, unloved, untouched.

So I made my choice. I would walk away—for good. And in doing so, he’d finally learn what it meant to lose the woman he so carelessly discarded.

\--

The key to the Maybach glinted in my hand as I closed the front door behind me.

""You're going out today?"" Griffin asked without looking up, already dressed immaculately in his usual charcoal suit, fingers adjusting the silver cufflinks with practiced ease.

I nodded, calm. “Yes.”

“What’s the plan?” he asked, brows twitching slightly. But before I could answer, he reached into his pocket and dropped the key into my palm.

“Never mind,” he muttered. “Just do something that makes you happy.”

I smiled, lips curving just slightly.

Yes. That’s exactly what I was going to do.

\---

But hours earlier, I hadn’t felt so composed.

It had started like the other failed nights. Another desperate attempt. Another wall I couldn’t break. I had tried everything—lingerie, whispered pleas, soft caresses, patience, and hope.

Hope was the cruelest of them all.

After he left me cold and untouched yet again, I stared at the unsigned divorce papers on the desk, heart pounding. Then, with a trembling hand, I reached for my phone and dialed.

Nathan answered on the second ring.

“I’m leaving him,” I said, my voice barely above a whisper.

There was a pause, long but unsurprised. “You finally see it, huh? I told you from the beginning—Griffin Martin is emotionally barren. He’s not cold; he’s void. Like someone wearing skin without a soul.”

A bitter laugh slipped out. “I really believed I could reach him. That if I just poured enough love in, something would overflow.”

“You’re not a charity case, Vivienne. You’re not supposed to fix broken people at the cost of yourself. Come to Texas. It’s warm, the water is clear, and the men there don’t treat intimacy like it’s a business transaction.”

“I’ll fly out once I’ve signed everything,” I told him.

He softened. “Good. You were meant for something better.”

When the call ended, I stayed seated in that silence. But it didn’t last. Something—curiosity, dread—pulled me to the end of the corridor.

Griffin’s sanctuary.

Always locked. Always off-limits.

But not tonight.

There was light under the door and a low, muffled noise. A sound that stopped me cold.

I pushed it open, breath caught in my throat—and froze.

Griffin knelt in the center of the room, shirtless, glistening with sweat. His body moved in a slow, deliberate rhythm. At first, I thought he wasn’t alone.

But there was no woman beneath him.

It was a doll.

Life-sized. Unsettlingly realistic. Her skin eerily smooth. Hazel eyes glassy, her long hair the same brown shade as—

No.

She looked exactly like Soraya. His stepsister.

A high-pitched noise escaped my throat, halfway between a burst and a sob, as I clapped a hand over my mouth. My legs nearly gave out.

This wasn’t the first time. I’d caught glimpses before—flashes of something I tried to unsee, moments I brushed off as hallucinations. The second time, I buried the memory.

But the third?

I felt nothing but silence. A dense, choking silence that filled every inch of my being.

I leaned against the wall and shut my eyes.

\---

The beginning was so different.

We’d met at a yacht party my brother threw—one of those events filled with people who wore money like perfume and loved hearing themselves talk. I spotted Griffin standing at the edge of the deck, sipping sparkling water as if making a statement. He was stunning. Untouchable. An enigma.

I begged Nathan to introduce us. I found ways to “accidentally” see him again. Eventually, he offered marriage—not love.

No grand gestures. No emotion. Just: “Marriage is acceptable. If you want it, I won’t protest.”

I should’ve run then.

Our wedding night was the first slap of truth. I wore red silk. Lit candles. Waited in anticipation.

He never came.

He spent the night in his study.

And it only worsened from there.

I tried everything—romantic getaways, slow dances in the kitchen, surprise touches. He pulled away each time.

One night, desperate, I slipped into his bed and curled against him.

He stood and left without a word.

Another time, I walked into his shower, soaking wet in nothing but longing.

He calmly handed me a towel and exited.

But the moment that shattered my heart entirely? The night I confessed I wanted a child.

He looked at me without blinking and said, “I am not built for emotional replication.”

What did that even mean?

For two years, I was a ghost in his house. Smiling at charity balls, preparing his meals, attending functions arm-in-arm… but going to bed cold and alone every single night.

Now I knew why.

He hadn’t rejected intimacy.

He had redirected it—toward someone else. Something else. A hollow version of a person he could never legally have.

As I stood outside that room, his voice haunted me.

“Soraya… Only you…”

The sound of my name never passed his lips like that.

\---

As I made my way to the garage, the Maybach key clenched in my fingers, his voice echoed faintly in my mind, heavy with the sting of everything left unspoken. He was already gone, off to his board meeting, his footsteps long faded into silence.

Yet his parting words lingered.

""Do whatever brings you joy.""

A quiet smile touched my lips.

Yes—leaving him for good would be exactly that.

Chapter 2

I didn’t offer another word. I simply turned away, stepped outside the house, and drove directly to the Texas consulate. Applying for permanent residency was a smooth process—especially with the influence carried by the Reid surname.

Over the past several years, our family had begun to transfer most of its holdings and investments overseas. My parents had already relocated, followed shortly after by Nathan and his wife. I had been the only one who stayed behind.

Stayed—for Griffin. But now, I was done with that too.

“It should be processed and finalized within a week,” the consulate representative informed me with a polite, practiced smile, handing over the official document.

I gave a small nod, accepted the paper, and stepped back into the warmth of daylight.

It was over. Griffin Martin—the man I had pursued for six years, the husband I had been legally bound to for two. The one I thought I could coax out of his fortress of detachment.

But he was never mine. Not truly. I had sacrificed so much for him, softened myself, toned down my fire, adapted to his minimalist, ‘clean’ way of living—even dropped red meat and wine, just to match his preferences. I shrank myself to fit the mold of his world. And yet…

No matter what I did, I couldn’t bridge the space between us. Not emotionally, not physically, not even in the places he kept most hidden.

I looked down at the stamped receipt in my hand. A thin, almost sardonic smile tugged at the corner of my mouth.

A bitter smile.

“You don’t want me, Griffin Martin,” I murmured under my breath. “But there are men out there who absolutely would.”

Later that night, I dialed a few old friends and told them I needed a wild night out. Since marrying Griffin, I had left that world behind—the vibrant noise, the music, the unrestrained laughter. I’d become someone else. Someone more muted.

But that evening, I wore a black dress with delicate straps, one that embraced every curve like a secret it didn’t want to share. Its hem swayed as I walked, teasing a glimpse of legs I hadn’t dared to show in a long time.

“Girl! What happened to you tonight?” My best friend Kayla shouted with a grin, pulling me toward the bar. “Ever since you got tangled up with that emotionally stunted mannequin, you’ve sworn off parties, liquor, everything!”

I laughed, tossing back a shot of tequila. The burn was sharp, invigorating.

“He’s not on my mind tonight,” I said, trailing my mouth across a line of salt on my wrist. “Tonight’s for me.”

Before she could comment, I slipped into the throng on the dance floor, letting the pulse of the music guide my body. I moved without restriction—hips swaying, arms in the air, head tilted back with abandon. Each movement was a rebellion against every night I lay in that penthouse bed alone, unloved.

A man brushed behind me—tall, chiseled, his shirt unbuttoned just enough to reveal a firm set of abs. I turned toward him, ran my hand across his abdomen, giggling when he smirked in response.

“Vivienne, are you out of your mind?” Kayla exclaimed, tugging me back. “That’s like, what? The fifth guy you’ve flirted with tonight! Aren’t you scared your husband’s gonna blow a fuse?”

“He’s not here,” I replied simply.

She looked uneasy.

“No, Vivienne... he is.”

I stopped.

“What do you mean?”

She leaned in close. “He’s been in the VIP section this whole time. Back corner. Watching you.”

I slowly turned my gaze—and there he was. Griffin. Eyes fixed on me. Cold. Unmoving.

Then the music stopped abruptly.

In the heavy silence, I caught the tail end of a conversation from his booth. A man sitting beside him snorted. “Griffin, your wife’s basically giving lap dances out here. If it were my girl, this place would be in flames.”

Griffin didn’t so much as blink.

He lifted his glass, took a slow sip, and responded evenly, “She knows where the boundary is. She won’t step over it.”

That hit harder than I expected. A single sentence, sharp as a blade. Was it trust? Or indifference? Did he believe I was still so hopelessly in love with him that no one else could ever touch me?

Maybe it was both.

“Wow,” the man beside him laughed. “You’re unshakable. Is there anything that can make you snap?”

But mid-laugh, the man stopped. “Hold on... where are you going?”

I turned in the same direction—and saw Griffin rise from his seat. Though his features remained calm, something in his eyes had shifted.

Something dark. Possessive.

I followed his line of sight.

That’s when I saw her.

Soraya. His stepsister.

She was near the dance floor’s edge, clad in a white dress, laughing lightly while exchanging numbers with a man I didn’t recognize.

Griffin crossed the room in three quick, fierce strides and grabbed her wrist.

“Who told you it was okay to come here? Who said you could give your number to some random guy?” he snapped.

Soraya’s eyes widened, then narrowed with resentment. “Why not? You pretend I don’t exist every day. Why do you care what I do now?”

“You really think I don’t care?” His voice dipped lower, almost guttural. “Who gave you that idea?”

“You did!” she cried, voice cracking. “You shut me out. You won’t look at me. You used to be everything to me. What happened?”

His jaw tightened. He swallowed hard, but no words came.

And I stood there, frozen, clutching my bag like it was the only thing tethering me to the earth.

Because I already understood.

He didn’t avoid her because he was repulsed—he avoided her because he was obsessed. Because being near her made him lose control.

Because this man—my husband—couldn’t make love to his own wife, but secretly owned a lifelike silicone doll crafted to resemble his stepsister in chilling detail.

Something inside me curled up and snapped. It wasn’t just heartbreak. It was finality.

I turned, ready to walk away.

But just as I reached for my purse, I heard Soraya’s trembling voice behind me.

“Griffin... can’t things go back to how they used to be? I miss the version of you that only saw me.”

His voice broke, low and raspy. “I’m married now. I can’t be with you the same way.”

And then I saw it.

The flash in Soraya’s eyes. A glint of something unstable. Dangerous.

“So if your wife disappeared... we could be together again?” she whispered.

Before I could react, she snatched a wine bottle from a nearby table and stormed toward me.

The glass shattered as it struck my head. A white-hot pain flared across my scalp. I stumbled back, barely registering that she was holding another bottle.

“You took him from me!” she screamed. “You ruined everything!”

The second blow landed even harder.

And then—darkness.

Screams fading into the distance. My heartbeat echoing louder than anything else.

Chapter 3

“You’re finally conscious,” the nurse said, her shoulders relaxing as she replaced the gauze on my forehead. “You gave us quite a scare. Two smashed wine bottles to the head—more than thirty stitches. Whoever did this didn’t just lose their temper—they meant business.”

My fingers moved reflexively to my scalp, brushing against the thick, padded layers of bandage wrapped around my head.

My voice came out raw. “Who brought me here?”

“Your best friend,” the nurse answered while checking my IV line. “She stayed by your side the whole night but had to rush out this morning for an urgent work matter. She even hired a private nurse to monitor you while she’s gone. You’ve been well looked after.”

My chest ached—not from the injury, but from the clarity.

So… Griffin hadn’t come.

I turned toward the tray table and picked up my phone with a trembling hand.

As the screen lit up, a notification from social media caught my eye.

Soraya Martin had just posted: He still treats me like a princess.

My thumb hesitated before tapping on the video.

Soraya appeared on-screen, dramatically holding out her finger like it had been maimed. “Look,” she said in a pouty voice, “I scratched myself when I broke that bottle.”

Then the camera shifted focus.

Griffin was kneeling before her, his fingers wrapping a bandage gently around the tiniest cut on her hand. He looked up with tender eyes, then leaned forward and kissed her fingertip.

“There. All better,” he murmured.

I stared at the screen, hollow. It felt as if someone had split my skull open a second time and poured something corrosive directly onto my brain.

But I didn’t cry. I didn’t scream. I just… breathed.

Then I picked up the phone and made the call.

“Hello,” I said to the dispatcher, my voice like dust. “I’d like to report an assault.”

That evening, my hospital room door creaked open. Griffin entered dressed head-to-toe in black, his face unreadable—calm on the surface, but with something dark moving just beneath.

“You contacted the authorities?” he asked, voice cool as frost. “Filed a report against Soraya?”

“I did,” I said, eyes locked on his. “She deliberately attacked me. That’s enough to press criminal charges.”

His jaw tightened. He spoke low. “She lost control. What she did wasn’t right, but I’ve handled it. It’s finished.”

“Handled it?” I gave a short, humorless laugh. “And how exactly did you ‘handle’ a near-fatal assault?”

“I told her she’s not allowed to leave the house today,” he said, as though that settled the matter.

I looked at him like he was a stranger. “You’re telling me I needed emergency surgery, and your version of punishment was putting her in time-out?”

His silence spoke louder than any excuse could.

“You’re not disciplining her,” I said, my voice rising. “You’re covering for her. You’re terrified I’ll pursue legal action, so you’re pretending to take control when in reality, you’re just shielding her from consequences.”

“You’re blowing this out of proportion.”

“I already pulled the complaint,” I interrupted. “There’s no point. You’ve got your hands in enough places to make sure she’s untouchable. No precinct in this city will lift a finger against her now.”

He didn’t deny it.

I clenched the sheets between my fists until my nails dug painfully into my palms.

I wanted to throw something. To scream. To ask why.

But the only thing I could manage to say was:

“Griffin… what was I to you all these years?”

He blinked, caught off guard.

“If I meant nothing,” I said, my voice trembling, “then why did you marry me?”

His brow furrowed. “Who said you meant nothing?”

“You did. Every single time you looked through me like I was invisible. Every time you walked away. Every night you slept in a room that wasn’t mine.” My throat tightened. “You chose me for a wife, but you couldn’t even show up when I was clinging to life?”

He didn’t answer right away. When he finally spoke, his voice was measured.

“This isn’t the moment to argue,” he said. “You’re still weak. I’ll stay here while you recover, make sure everything’s taken care of. Once you’re better, we’ll discuss a settlement. Just stop creating more drama.”

He said it like he was offering a gift. Like I was meant to be grateful for his presence.

I stared at him in stunned silence.

This man—the one I once chased endlessly. The one I thought I could teach to love. The one I gave my youth, my dignity, my body, and heart to—

Now acted like staying in the same building as me was a charitable act.

And in that moment, something in me shifted.

He never believed I’d leave. He thought I’d stay no matter how far he pushed me. That I’d be too weak, too loyal, too blind to walk away.

But he was wrong.

This time, I wouldn’t plead.

This time, I wouldn’t wait.

This time, I was done.

Chapter 4

Griffin remained at my side for several days after the incident, staying with me at the hospital. He arrived promptly each morning, bringing steaming broth in sleek, high-end flasks. He sat quietly during doctor rounds, offering his presence without needing to speak. When the pain spiked late at night, he reached for my hand and held it until the worst passed.

Had this been six months ago—or even six weeks—I might have mistaken all of it for love. I would’ve clung to it like a drowning woman to a lifeline.

But now? Now there was only a hollow stillness inside me. It’s unsettling, how you can spend six years chasing someone’s affection, only for it to all evaporate in a single heartbeat.

The morning I was released from the hospital, I walked slowly toward the parking garage, my head still tender and my chest strangely still—quiet, as if the storm had passed and left nothing behind.

That’s when I saw her.

Soraya was lounging in the front passenger seat of Griffin’s car, scrolling through her phone with a lazy flick of her thumb. Her glossy hair was tied into a loose ponytail, and she looked like she belonged there—effortless, comfortable, shameless.

The moment our eyes met, her expression soured, as if I was the intruder here.

Griffin caught the shift in her face and frowned. “Soraya, didn’t we already talk about this?”

Instantly, she changed her tune. Her shoulders drooped, her lashes fluttered, and she bit her bottom lip just enough to look remorseful. “Vivienne, I… I’m sorry. That night, I wasn’t thinking clearly. I didn’t mean for things to go that far. I just…”

Her voice cracked slightly as she turned toward Griffin. “You’ve been ignoring me for so long—ever since you got married. I thought… maybe if I acted out, you’d finally pay attention to me again.”

I said nothing. Just stood there with my hand wrapped tight around my bag strap.

Griffin turned to me, his voice steady and matter-of-fact. “Soraya’s going to be staying with us for a while. Let’s just… keep things peaceful.”

I gave a single nod, moved to the back seat, and climbed in without a sound.

During the ride home, I stayed silent as city lights painted fleeting patterns across the windshield. Griffin and Soraya sat up front, shadows shaped by the glow of passing traffic.

I rested my head against the cool window and watched the world blur. I didn’t need to look directly to notice it—the way Griffin kept stealing glances at her, like she was something delicate he didn’t know how to handle without breaking.

Out of nowhere, Soraya gave a girlish laugh and tilted her phone toward him. “Griffin, look at this guy who messaged me. Isn’t he kind of cute?”

Griffin’s grip on the steering wheel visibly tightened.

“Block him.”

“What?” she protested with a pout. “Seriously? I’m twenty-three—I’m not allowed to think someone’s hot?”

“Block him,” he repeated, his tone clipped and final.

Soraya rolled her eyes with exaggerated drama but followed the command, muttering under her breath, “You’re worse than a jealous boyfriend…”

Griffin didn’t reply, but I noticed the rigid set of his jaw. His silence spoke volumes. He wasn’t indifferent—he was possessive.

When we got to the house, I didn’t stay to chat. I walked straight to the bedroom, shut the door, and let the solitude pull me under like a tide.

From beyond the walls, I could hear the gentle clink of silverware, Soraya’s laughter spilling into the hallway, and the low murmur of a film playing on the living room TV. All of it added up to a warmth and intimacy that had never existed in my marriage.

In over two years, Griffin and I had never once shared dinner to the backdrop of music. We’d never had casual laughs. He had never looked at me the way he looked at her, like she was the center of his gravity.

I crawled beneath the blankets and let the bitterness inside me ferment, like something spoiled that refused to be swallowed. I didn’t know how long I stayed curled up like that, letting the darkness cocoon me.

Eventually, the quiet pulled me from bed—thirst nudging me toward the kitchen.

But when I pushed the door open, I froze.

Griffin was in the living room, kneeling beside the couch, completely still.

Soraya was curled up asleep, knees tucked to her chest, the blanket barely covering her. He was watching her, unmoving. His eyes weren’t filled with pity or obligation. They were full of something else—gentleness, reverence. Like she was light itself and he couldn’t look away.

In that moment, I saw him clearly. No facade. No pretense.

Just a man in awe of someone who wasn’t me.

Soraya stirred slightly, murmured in her sleep, and shifted. “Griffin… don’t let me go,” she whispered faintly. “I love you. Only you.”

Even in sleep, she reached for him, tugging him closer. Their faces met, lips brushing by accident at first.

But he didn’t flinch. Didn’t pull away.

His pupils widened. His breathing hitched.

And then he kissed her—deliberate, slow, and sure.

Chapter 5

I stood silently behind the door, my fingers trembling as I gripped the handle, holding my breath without even realizing it. Through the slight opening, I could see my husband, his head bent low, his mouth pressed against Soraya’s like she was something he couldn’t live without.

His palm rested on her hip, his fingers curling with possessive desperation, like he wanted to mold her into himself. Her breathing was unsteady, her arms fastened tightly around his neck, as if she'd been waiting her whole life for this moment to finally arrive.

“Griffin…” she murmured, his name leaving her lips again and again, delicate and needy. The way he answered—his voice raspy, quiet, almost reverent—was a tone I had never been worthy of.

That tenderness? That intimacy? He’d never given me even a fraction of it.

I don’t know how long I remained frozen in place, invisible behind the half-closed door, but eventually he pulled away, just slightly, and used the pad of his thumb to gently wipe the corner of her mouth. It was such a small gesture, yet so deliberate that it made my lungs forget how to function.

Then he reached into his pocket.

I watched as he pulled out a necklace—her necklace—the same one Soraya had gifted him years ago, the one he had once told me was misplaced during a move.

He hadn’t lost it. He’d just hidden it from me.

Now, he was wearing it again, slipping it over his head with no hesitation. And just like that, I understood.

He didn’t belong to me anymore.

He belonged to her.

I clenched my hands into fists, my nails digging into my skin so hard it hurt. The pain grounded me, gave me something to focus on besides the ache in my chest.

Without making a sound, I backed away, turned, and gently shut the bedroom door.

I crawled beneath the blankets and buried my face in the pillow, muffling the sound of his footsteps as he walked down the hallway. I squeezed my eyes shut. But the silence didn’t help. My mind betrayed me, dragging me back to every attempt I had made to get him to see me, to touch me, to choose me.

That time I walked into his study late one night, dressed in the silk robe he’d once praised. I faked needing a document just to be near him. He didn’t even lift his gaze from the paperwork.

That time I brought him a towel after his run, only for him to take it without a word, close the bathroom door, and leave me alone outside, holding nothing but rejection.

That night after the gala, when I came home tipsy, laughing, hopeful. I threw my arms around him like I used to, and he caught me, yes—but not to hold me. Just to set me upright, his hand cold and mechanical as he straightened his tie.

He was always composed. Always distant.

But now… all it took was one breathless “Griffin” from her, and suddenly, every rule he made me follow was shattered like it never existed.

Tears slid down my cheeks. I wiped them away quickly, pointlessly.

He didn’t love me.

He wanted her.

The next morning, they were already at the table by the time I came down. Soraya was seated comfortably, twirling her fingers over her lips and frowning slightly.

“Griffin, do you have bugs in this house or something?” she whined with a pout. “My lips feel all puffy today…”

Griffin didn’t even flinch. “I’ll have the staff bring you something for it,” he said evenly, like it meant nothing.

I stepped forward and noticed a package placed in front of my seat. I opened it.

Inside was a necklace. Rare. Lavish. The kind of piece that could pay someone’s rent for a year.

I let out a dry laugh. “Well, someone’s in a generous mood.”

Soraya leaned across the table for a better look. Her voice was sugarcoated, but jealousy laced every word. “Wow, Griffin… Didn’t know you spoiled your wife like this. I always thought you weren’t the romantic type. Guess I underestimated you.”

I lifted my eyes toward him, waiting for any sign—an explanation, even a lie—but all he did was sip his coffee in silence, his gaze distant.

He didn’t even try to say the gift was a consolation for what Soraya had done to me.

He didn’t have to.

He simply didn’t care anymore.

After finishing his coffee, he stood and buttoned his coat. “I’m off to work,” he announced, turning to Soraya next. “Don’t wander too much. Stay anywhere you want—just stay out of my study.”

Soraya gave him a playful pout. “Why not? What’s so secret in there?”

He tossed out some half-hearted excuse, something vague and dismissive. But I knew the truth. That room was his fortress—the place where he kept all the things he never wanted me to uncover.

After they left the table, I retreated to my room and locked the door. I didn’t want to hear Soraya’s voice echoing down the hall. Didn’t want to catch glimpses of her smiling like she owned the world. Didn’t want to be reminded that in her eyes, I was nothing but an extra in their private, twisted love story.

At some point, I drifted into sleep. But when I woke…

Something was off.

I sat up, stretched—and saw it. My hair.

Chopped.

Jagged strands of my long dark hair scattered on the floor like fallen leaves. My scalp felt lighter. Uneven. Violated.

I stumbled into the hallway, dizzy with disbelief, and made my way to the living room.

And there she was.

Soraya sat comfortably on the couch, humming a cheerful tune. In her hands, she held something delicate—a braid. My hair. She was weaving it, turning it into some grotesque little craft project.

My hair.

She looked up at me with a bright, innocent smile, like nothing was wrong. “Oh, hey. You’re up! Hope you don’t mind—I needed some materials for this school project. They asked us to make something meaningful. Thought I’d make a wig.”

She held up the braided piece like it was an award. “You really have gorgeous hair, you know? Super shiny and soft. Kinda jealous.”

My body moved before my mind caught up.

I stepped forward and slapped her across the face.",1,1754597389.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

Axl publicly tore my dress to shreds and pushed me into the fountain.""You've got a heart of stone. I've agreed to marry you, yet you still want to humiliate Rayne,"" he said.Climbing out of the fountain, drenched, I watched Axl signal to the group of hooligans outside the door.""They're yours now. Have fun, do whatever you want.""Surrounded by the thugs, I begged Axl for mercy, but he only shielded Rayne's eyes, saying, ""Don't look, it's not worth it.""A week later, he finally remembered me and came with chocolates in hand: ""As long as you stop causing trouble, we can still have our wedding.""I looked at him, expressionless: ""But Axl, I don't want to marry you anymore.""He seemed surprised by my words, and seeing that I had no intention of taking the chocolates, he thrust them into my arms.""Still upset? I only meant to scare you that day. Those guys wouldn't dare touch anyone associated with me.""""Besides, this whole mess is your fault. Why do you always have to challenge Rayne? Learn from this and don't do it again.""I said nothing, just stared at the chocolates now in my lap. Their intense sweetness overwhelmed me, irritating my sensitive airways. Quickly, I placed the chocolates on the coffee table and sat as far from them as possible.Axl's anger flared instantly: ""Keira Franklin, what does that mean? Don't make me regret showing kindness! It's just a few harmless touches; I don't mind, so why so dramatic? Let me tell you, many women would kill for the chance to be Mrs. Lane. You better learn to appreciate what's being offered.""Listening to his cold words, it felt like an invisible hand squeezed the life out of my heart. I bit my lip, trying to calm the storm inside, and spoke lightly.""I'm allergic to nuts.""Axl hesitated, a flicker of guilt crossing his face. Seeing him avoid my gaze, I couldn't help but smirk at the irony.Maybe out of guilt, his tone softened a little: ""Keira, I...""But I cut him off: ""Rayne helped me pick the dress. I didn't know she'd also bought one.""Hearing that, Axl's expression changed quickly. He jumped up from the sofa, pointing a finger at me in anger: ""You're truly despicable, still lying even now.""""Rayne already told me she mentioned liking that dress to you beforehand, hoping to wear it to witness our engagement.""""I only consider Rayne a sister. If I truly had feelings for her, would you still matter?""At that moment, I couldn't hold back the tears any longer. They flowed freely down my cheeks. Watching me tremble silently on the sofa, Axl's eyes were full of annoyance.""Stop pretending. I'll be staying at the office these days, you should think about things carefully.""With that, he picked up his jacket, turned, and left without looking back. As the front door slammed shut, I clearly heard his final words:""Rayne doesn't hold grudges against you, but I won't let her suffer. I've given her your diamond ring as compensation.""The closing of the door echoed in the empty house, causing the vibrant chocolates on the coffee table to shudder. I couldn't fathom what harm I had done to Rayne to warrant such compensation.The diamond ring was specially designed for me, embodying the love and hope I held for our future together. Despite knowing what it meant to me and our relationship, he gave it away so carelessly.Does this mean that our five-year relationship holds no more value in his heart than that ring?At that moment, my heart shattered.Suddenly, an intense itch brought me back to reality as I sat numbly on the sofa. Watching the red spots appear on my skin, a wave of despair washed over me.Once, to save Axl, I had my finger broken by a thug's hammer.Because of that incident, I had to abandon my dreams of playing piano and leave the stage I once longed for.Later, Axl got revenge for me by shattering the thug's hands with a hammer. The image of him doing so mirrored the way he let those thugs humiliate me at our engagement party to amuse Rayne.If I had known of Rayne's existence before falling irrevocably for Axl, I wouldn't have allowed myself to end up so disgraced.After all, I once stood as the most dazzling and proud pianist under the spotlight.I first learned of Rayne during our one-year anniversary. That day, I sat in the restaurant, eagerly waiting for Axl. But he never showed, nor did he answer calls or messages.Just as I was about to report him missing, I saw him in his best friend's Instagram post. In the photo, a girl leaned against his shoulder, and he looked at her with such tenderness and passion that it felt like someone poured ice water over my warm heart.Returning home that night, I expected an explanation from Axl. But he spent the entire night in the study, ignoring me completely.The next day, I confronted him, and he merely said she was like a sister to him, urging me not to overthink. Yet, I felt a noticeable shift in his demeanor, a newfound coldness toward me.Trying to make Axl happy, I attempted to befriend Rayne. For a while, things did seem to improve between us.Until one day, when I showed Axl my new handbag, he furiously cut it to pieces with scissors.""Why did you give Rayne a matching handbag? You know she hates wearing similar things to others!""""No wonder you want to befriend her; just to humiliate and provoke her.""""Keira Franklin, I never imagined your intentions were so nasty!""Listening to his unjust accusations left me bewildered, desperate to explain that Rayne had admired my bag and requested one as well.But Axl refused to listen. In his eyes, all that mattered was Rayne's distress and anger.Only then did I realize that Axl truly loved Rayne.I was nothing more than a pawn in his scheme to avenge Rayne's rushed wedding to someone else.Ever since, any conflict between Rayne and me inevitably cast me as the villain.Rayne's simple remark about not understanding led him to toss my cherished music scores into the trash, allowing her to mock me as a pianist who could never play again.I was so furious that I told her to leave my house, only for Axl to throw me out despite my high fever.Recalling these events only intensified the itch across my skin. Wiping away my tears, I mechanically moved to the medicine cabinet, searching for my allergy medication.Just as I was about to swallow it, I paused, my hand brushing against my lower abdomen. How could I forget that I was already one month pregnant?It was meant to be my engagement gift for Axl.But before I could share the news, he delivered a gift of his own—a gift that I would never forget.A gift that made me resolve to walk away from this toxic relationship.

Chapter 2Axl didn't come home for three days straight.I didn’t do what I used to, desperately calling him or begging for his forgiveness. Instead, I stayed silent, as if I had disappeared. Scrolling through Instagram, I glanced at photos of him and Rayne sharing their moments, and then I visited the hospital to discuss the possibility of an abortion.Before I left, the doctor advised me that my condition might make it difficult to conceive. She suggested I give it some serious thought.Axl showed up not long after I got back home. He smiled as he handed me a gift box.""I found something special for you; you're gonna love it.""I looked at him, surprised, and opened the box. Inside was a tube of lipstick, but the label underneath clearly said it was a promotional freebie.So, Axl's indifference ran so deep he didn't even bother hiding it? I placed the gift box on the coffee table and uttered a faint ""thanks.""He frowned slightly, surprised at my reaction. In the past, even if he gave me something insignificant, like a leaf, I would cherish it.""Keira, are you still upset?""""The lipstick was picked out by Rayne and me together; she says all girls love this color.""I scoffed internally. Of course, it was a freebie because he was out shopping with Rayne. I didn't want to talk to him and was heading back to my room.Suddenly, Axl grabbed my wrist.""Rayne wants to invite you to dinner to sort out any misunderstandings.""""She’s a good person, so stop making things difficult for her. Just behave, and you'll be Mrs. Lane.""""Make sure to apologize to Rayne during dinner.""He dismissed my wishes as he pulled me out the door.In Axl’s eyes, Rayne's opinions were gospel, while my feelings meant nothing.In the parking lot, Rayne was already in the passenger seat. Seeing us approach, she pouted and complained to Axl:""What took you so long? I was getting bored!""Then, she turned to me with a bright smile:""Thanks for the gorgeous diamond ring, Keira. I adore it!""""Oh, by the way, I get car sick, so I have to sit in the passenger seat. You don’t mind, right?""Rayne flaunted the diamond ring on her finger, her eyes gleaming with smugness. Before I could respond, Axl interjected:""You're fine in the back seat; it’s always meant for you. What right does she have to mind?""He then turned to me, his tone far harsher than before:""Stop standing there like you’re lost. Get in the car! Keeping guests waiting isn’t polite!""I had long gotten used to sitting in the back seat. Ever since Rayne showed up, the passenger seat was never mine. I had tried to claim it once, stubbornly insisting on sitting there. The result was being left alone on a country road in the middle of the night, with Axl driving away without a backward glance.I had no interest in their flirting and climbed directly into the back seat. As soon as I settled, the strong scent of coffee filled the air.My chest tightened immediately, and I quickly rolled down the window, sticking my head out for fresh air. Faint red spots appeared on the back of my hand.I was about to ask Axl to open the door, but he ignored my condition and started the car. He didn’t forget to reprimand me:""Roll the window up a bit; Rayne can’t catch a cold, can she?""""You're tough as nails and can handle the cold, but Rayne is delicate!""Silently, I raised the window, leaving a small crack. The aching pain quietly consumed me. Five years of devotion hadn’t swayed Axl one bit.It suddenly clicked that what I thought was a happy life was a solo act. Given that, I had no reason to be trapped in an unsatisfying struggle for someone who wasn’t worth it.",1,1754597311.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

1mkak6e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Houdini/comments/1mkak6e/problem_with_flip_and_viscosityparticle/,Problem with FLIP and viscosity/particle separation on a fine mesh,"I’m having a problem with a small Flip simulation of a portafilter extraction, based on this video by Fabian Strube:  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKYLl1Ckez0&t=333s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKYLl1Ckez0&t=333s)

In my setup, I’ve done practically everything identical to what’s shown in the video, with the only difference being that I modeled my own mesh for the portafilter since I didn’t want to spend money.

Now, however, I’m running into the issue that the filter basket is not permeable to the fluid, despite having a high number of substeps (15 to 25), and using the same settings as in the video (Surface Tension: 0.0015; Viscosity: 0.0014; Proxy Volume with extremely high resolution for the filter mesh). The only way I can get fluid to pass through is by turning off viscosity and setting the particle separation to at least 0.03.

Of course, these limitations take away my ability to achieve the look I want in terms of fluid resolution and the behavior of the coffee at the filter.

I’ve already tried some workarounds to improve the result, such as:

[Ugly sim with 0.003 ps and higher surface tension to try and mimic viscocity](https://reddit.com/link/1mkak6e/video/mkq2mf1xlnhf1/player)

* Increasing surface tension to mimic the behavior of the coffee without using viscosity (doesn’t look good to me)
* Reducing the collision separation, which makes the filter permeable, but removes any thickness from the coffee (it suddenly behaves like a showerhead)

[Ugly behavior of the fluid with collision separation enabled](https://preview.redd.it/czfokljpmnhf1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0cd1c2710667ffedbd5645120e4708379f899da)

* Scaling the entire scene up by a factor of 5 in case everything is too small — didn’t fix the issue either.

I hope someone might be able to help with this. If more info is needed, I’m happy to share files or similar",1,1754597277.0,Houdini,0,1.0,False
1mkajgr,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mkajgr/the_final_voyage_of_the_alaskan_dawn/,The Final Voyage of the Alaskan Dawn,"Call me Ike, though that is not my real name. Honestly, with how the last seven weeks have been, I’m not sure if I could ever go back to my real name. The only thing I can say with total certainty is that I am the sole survivor of the Alaskan Dawn. How I found myself on that ship was born through dumb luck and bad decisions. Like a crook doing one last job.

I enlisted in the Marines two years out of high school once I discovered the college wasn’t for me. The late 2010s meant I was going to Afghanistan. It was supposed to be two years active duty and four years in the reserves. It was a good career to supplement me until something I actually wanted to do came around. That was until April 2019, not a full six months into my second year, and an IED went off near my Humvee. I was the gunner, and needless to say, my military career was cut drastically short.

I was thankful to have my limbs, but six inches of steel pierced my hip. Between that and the ravenous concussion, I was sent home early. To this day, I suffer from tinnitus. Took nearly four hours of surgery to remove the steel, but they couldn’t get it all. Some of it was too close to the femoral artery that removing it would probably kill me.

Upon returning home and getting disability, I felt useless. I started drinking heavily. It got to the point that two months before the anniversary of my ‘survival’, I was checked into rehab for alcohol abuse. With COVID, and my chances of getting a real job already low, I went back to the booze. When the world started back up, I was forced back into rehab. That seemed to stick, and I’ve been sober ever since.

So naturally, I replaced alcohol with gambling.

Vice 2 wasn’t as easily forgiven. No help from my parents, and I can’t blame them. When I was 22 and struggling, they wanted to nurse their baby boy. But at 27, they weren’t about the shill out thousands more to fix a different problem. Can’t say I blame them, I didn’t have a job, and all of my disability checks were hitting Fan Duel faster than any real bill I had.

It got to the point where I was banned from Foxwoods for not paying back my debt.

It took me realizing that I would be out of money the same week that my check came in, that maybe it was time to find a job. That was also a problem. Personality-wise, I didn’t want to hump a desk 9-5, but most other jobs required me to stand for hours at a time, which was terrible on my hip.

Next best chance, next to Indeed, was Craigslist. I ignored all the ones that were asking for hitman services; those were all police plants wanting to nab a spouse wanting to whack their significant other. There were a couple other security ads, and then I stumbled on this one.

*Security needed for Boat Voyage. Ex-service members only. Pays cash.* Seemed simple enough. The description was even more convincing. *Easy money and a one-time gig. Pays handsomely. Looking for people willing to spend up to three weeks offshore. Once complete, you will be paid and communications will cease.*

At this point, I saw no red flags.

Well, no red flags that turned me off. It was a mysterious person online, and for all I knew, I was signing up for gladiator fights on a cruise, but I had no money in either my checking or savings account, so I was beyond desperate. If for nothing else, I would feel like I was contributing.

I emailed an inquiry. Something simple: how much?

The reply was quick from a clear burner email address, a random assortment of letters and numbers: 2,000 per day. Food and other supplies will be provided. Any other questions?

I emailed back: what is the job?

The reply was quick and unnerving: I see you are from the New Haven, Connecticut region. I can meet you at the pizzeria on State Street, if you’re interested.

My heart sank at the knowledge of my address. I’m sure it was light work for a computer guy to trace an IP, but in no way did I feel any better. However, my math skills dulled my anxiety; 2k a day meant at most I was looking at 28k. A nice nest egg to be back on my feet. Maybe help me get a long-term job.

I simply replied I’m interested.

The pizzeria was crowded. I had two slices and a Coke; I focused on the parking lot. I wanted to see if I could spot the mystery man.

“That’s gonna get cold,” said the man who sat across from me. He had a narrow face. His glasses rested on the bridge of his nose. He wore a Yale street and jeans, looking almost too casual for this.

“How did-”

“C’mon, you’ve been watching the parking lot like a hawk. And you didn’t even touch your pizza,” said the man.

I shrugged and took a pizza. There was still some heat in there.

The man tapped his finger.

“Yeah?” I said with a mouth full of pizza.

“You emailed me, remember. Thought you wanted details.”

I swallowed and moved my plate aside. The man adjusted in his seat.

“My employer is looking for former servicemen; I can assume you are one.”

“Marines.”  

The man nodded. I felt him studying me like this interaction was a trial run. I leaned back and relaxed my shoulders.

“Good. The job is simple. There is a charter based out of California, it leaves in two days. Flight and the two-day stay at a hotel will be covered. Firearms will be provided for you.”

“Firearms, huh?”

“You don’t think we were selecting veterans for modeling, did you?”

I smirked.

“Is this offensive or defensive?”

“You and the others will be doing basic security. Just need to be careful of the cargo.”

“What are we moving?”

“Nothing of your concern. In fact, that’s the perfect segue into the three main rules.”

I took a sip of my Coke.

“Let’s hear them.”

“One, no names. Pick a call sign before you fly out. Two, no questions. If my employer or any of his delegates tells you to do something, you jump to it. And the final one is the difficult one.”

I waved him on; the pizza was calling my name.

“Should the ship sink or in any way fall into peril, you will not issue any form of SOS or Mayday.”

And there it was. The catch. No rescue. Success or death. Not quite the best option. But 28k was a lot of money for someone with none.

“Okay, I’m in.”

The man shook his head.

“Your driver’s license, please.”

“Excuse me?”

“C’mon, the no names is for you guys. I need it to verify if you fit our criteria.”

“Can you do that in two days?”

“It won’t take us two hours.” The man winked.

I scoffed. I took out my wallet, removed the license, and slid it across the table. The man looked and took a picture of it with his phone. He handed it back.

“Good to meet you. You’ll hear back soon.”

And I did. I went home, opened my laptop, and started to pace. After all, I had no money for rent, food, anything. If I got the job, I could negotiate with my landlord. Keep my head afloat until I got something more consistent. Three emails hit in rapid succession. The first was from a clear burner email.

Four words: You’re in. Pack light.

The second was my bank: $1,000 was deposited into my checking account.

The final was from Expedia: my flight to Santa Barbara and Marriott stay were booked and paid for.

For the first time in a while, I felt good.

It lasted until I got into the car at SBA. The flight was fine, barring some turbulence, but the car ride was unsettling. I was picked up by two big guys in suits; the bulges in their jackets were from shoulder holsters. They wore scarves to cover their faces. The worst part was that they were overly professional, opening the door, taking my bag.

While my scary valet pulled away, I watched the city move out the window. When I checked in, I was given a bag, said to have been left for me. When I opened it, there was a Visa gift card and a note.

*This will cover your food until you board.*

I spent the first day mostly in bed. I ordered a pizza around eight just to have something. California pizza sucked, but I wanted something cheap that delivered. Payment went through fine. I grabbed a soda from the vending machine and enjoyed some YouTube while I ate cardboard pizza with flat Sprite.

The next morning, I got the complimentary breakfast. As I looked for a seat, I was waved over. The guy was medium high but built. He was tan and had a surfer dude haircut.

“Thanks,” I said.

“You here for the mystery gig?” he said.

“What makes you say that?”

The guy laughed. He smacked the table, nearly spilling his tea.

“C’mon, you got bags under your arms, built strong, and you flew in on the same flight I did.”

“I didn’t see you,” I said.

“I was incognito,” he lifted his hands and enacted faux dodges.

“Charger,” he said, extending his hand. I forgot about the nicknames. So I panicked.

“Ike.”

Charger nodded and went back to breakfast. As we ate, we discussed, vaguely, about ourselves. Charger was a SoCal native; he was a Marine Scout Sniper for a few years and found the lack of work that matched that excitement. He took this job because it seemed fun. Can’t say I didn’t agree.

The only negative to Charger was his nickname; he chose it because of his favorite football team. As a Chiefs fan, it was hard for me to associate with a fan of a division rival, but hey, at least he wasn’t a Raiders fan.

“So did you hear any of the rumors?” asked Charger.

“Uh, no, I haven’t spoken to any about this aside from you and the guy who hired me.”

Charger downed his tea; his gulps rang out like church bells.

“From what I heard, this guy is some big shot in the pharmaceutical world, got caught up in some experimental shit.”

“Or maybe we’re protecting some rare earth metal being shipped overseas.”

Charger shrugged. I sipped my coffee. There was a nagging voice in my head telling me to finish breakfast, get an Uber, and promptly fuck off. I had that grand from glasses man, I could swing it. Fly back to New England and maybe try a desk job.

But my curiosity and determination outweighed any fear.

After breakfast, I went to my room and found another envelope. It had my name and full address on it. I opened it, and it was a contract. It was an NDA and the three rules on listed, each requiring an initial.

**I will under no circumstances radio a Mayday or an SOS** was seared into my mind.

I signed it. Selling your soul was easier than one might think. On the back of the envelope, I was told to put the contract inside and hand it to my driver.

At 2:30, we were checked out. The car took Charger and me from the hotel to the Port of Hueneme. The ride was quick; there wasn’t enough time to think or second-guess ourselves. When I stepped out of the car, my eyes were drawn to the USS Alaskan Dawn. It was a tanker ship, about 600 feet long. What caught my eye was a huge metal structure, about 50 feet tall and wide. I chalked it up to specialty cargo, but it was strange. Most cargo ships utilized the hull space; this seemed to be for a different purpose.

“Three-week sausage party, hope someone brought Vaseline,” whispered Charger to me. I smirked, but I doubted anyone wanted action on the seven seas.  His joke snapped me out of my questions. I reminded myself about the 28k.

And how I wasn’t supposed to ask questions.

There were about 12 of us. We checked in with our callsign and boarded.

On deck, there was a group of men in polos and trousers. Most of us were in khaki shorts, graphic tees, and the occasional ball cap. One guy was wearing a Pink Floyd shirt, which I appreciated. Another was wearing a shirt with Dante from *Clerks* saying, “I’m not even supposed to be here today.” I couldn’t talk shit, I was wearing an old Alex Smith jersey and camo shorts.

A tall man with thin grey hair walked passed the better-dressed men and turned to face. He was slightly underweight, and his skin wrinkled. He stood hunched. He cleared his throat.

“Greetings, gentlemen, for the sake of personal anonymity, call me Dr. Purple. This is my charter. My vessel. Now, we have received your signatures and NDAs. Henceforth, nothing on this ship happened. Your duties here are to ensure the safety of myself and my team over the next three weeks or so. As discussed before, each day will ensure you a lump sum. If any issues arise, my number 2, Mr. Nantucket, will see to your needs.”

He stepped aside, and Mr. Nantucket, a built man with bright red hair, stood forward.

“I’ll show you around.”

We followed him inside. He showed us the stairs to the bridge. In terms of active patrol, we were expected to rotate in 12-hour shifts. When not on, we could use the recreational room. There was a foosball table, a dartboard, and various board games next to the barracks.  Near the barracks and the hull were weapons cases. Rifles and ammo were stashed there. Food was at 8AM, 2PM, and 8PM with a few vending machines around. All seemed fine.

Along with Charger, I made friends with the two others we bunked with, Jules, a young Black man from Jersey City, and Poacher, a Hispanic guy from Chicago. Jules was in the National Guard, but this was a chance for extra money. Poacher was ex-Special Forces; he didn’t elaborate on which unit he was in. No one asked.

The first couple of days were simple. Jules and Poacher took the mornings. Charger and I took the nights. We usually stood topside and watched the water. By the end of the first night, we were miles from shore.

There was no one left to save us.

Night on the Alaskan Dawn was peacefully terrifying. There was no light on the water once the clouds were down. Aside from the overhead lights, there was nothing to be seen.

Charger and I were on deck patrol one night. There was always a moment, mid-patrol, where we stopped and just looked into the void, between a black sky and a dark sea. Usually, this was when Charger would strike up a cigarette.

“Who do you favor this season?” he asked.

“The Chiefs, duh.”

“I mean, yeah, but after that Super Bowl-”

“Don’t fucking go there, bolt boy.”

We took a beat to laugh, but in that silence, we realized something.

The engines were cut.

We stood and listened. There was no commotion. We willingly stopped. It was three days of travel, and now, we were at a standstill. From this height, we could still hear the waves splashing against the side of the ship.

“I don’t like this,” I said.

“Yeah.”

The rest of that night was uneventful. As was the night after that.

I don’t remember what day it was when Jules woke me up at around 11.

“What?” I snapped.

“Sorry, Ike, we need you and Charger on deck. Two of our morning crew are sick.”

I rolled out of bed and didn’t bother to fix my hair. I smacked Charger’s arm, which dangled over my bunk.

Thankfully, lunch was in an hour, so I could grab some grub before pulling a double shift.

“Make sure those assholes know they owe us one,” I said. Jules waved me off as he went topside.

I headed to the bridge to check the cameras. While it was part of my job, I never got to see the hull during the day. Especially what was going on in the big box.

The main camera guy was Bobcat; he was a good ole' boy from Arkansas. Spoke with the twang to boot.

“Mornin’, Ike, takin’ over for the two sickos?” said Bobcat.

“Yeah, coffee up here any good?”

“You know we ain’t supposed to ask no questions.”

“I thought that only applied to Dr. Purple’s people eaters.”

He chortled at that.

“I know, I know, I’m fuckin’ with you, Ike.”

I poured myself a coffee and drank it black. I peered over the camera and saw a glass box. Dr. Purple and two assistants were in the box. They were doing electrical work or something. All I saw were sparks. The camera wasn’t great.

“They synthesizing somethin’,” Bobcat said. He leaned back in his chair, allowing me a better view. Eventually, the white fuzzy silhouettes of Purple and Co. moved, and there lay a thin body. The thing was still. I couldn’t see any discernible features. I’d have written the thing off if I couldn’t see it breathing.

“Holy shit, Bob, you seeing this?” I asked.

“Seeing what?”

I watched as I saw little nubs start to sprout. I couldn’t hear a thing, but it was clear that it was struggling. The top of the thing began to pop and grow. The ‘head’ extended into becoming a lizard-like skull structure. Flesh ripped away as it went from blank to developed. A long tongue slid out and circled the air. My heart raced.

Pharmaceutical my ass, this was some John Hammond experimentation.

No laws on genetic testing in international waters.

We weren’t protection, we were containment.

The animal grew legs quick, they were thick. The arms were still small, like what a T-Rex’s arms would look like. The head smashed into the glass. Then again. And again. I couldn’t see it, but the thing cracked the glass.

The fourth smash caused the glass to shatter and collapse. My heart raced as that thing stepped out of the container. It beat so hard I could feel it in my ears.

An alarm blared. Lights flashed in the hull. *CONTAINMENT BREACH! CONTAINMENT BREACH!*

The scream carried across the ship. Bobcat and I stared in disbelief.

“Help me find the door seals,” he said.

We frantically searched the control panel. As we looked, the cameras picked up on the thing moving down a corridor. We heard the gunshots.

And the screams.

I finally found it and turned the key. The echo of doors closing in the hull rung out. I fell to the ground to catch my breath.

“What the fuck was that!” yelled Bobcat.

“I don’t know.”

We made our way down. Dr. Purple was MIA, Nantucket was around the survivors. Three of our security guys were gone. Poacher clutched his arm. I didn’t have to get a close look to see that it was gone below the bicep.

“I need everyone to calm down,” said Nantucket, his New England accent bleeding through.

“Fuck that! What is that?” yelled Poacher. He winced.

“That thing was simply procedural; you have nothing to worry about.”

“Bullshit.” Someone yelled.

“Fuck that.” Yelled another. Nantucket was sweating. He probably didn’t know what he had gotten himself into.

“We, uh, we locked the doors,” said Bobcat.

“The hull seals?” asked Nantucket. He nodded. I stood behind and watched. Nantucket rubbed his stubble. He took a deep breath.

“Okay, I’m not sure how this is going to work, but we need to isolate the thing and make sure it’s dead.”

“It’s sealed off, ain’t that enough?” chimed in Jules.

“No, I, I don’t know.” He walked over to the railing and hurled. He sighed and came back.

“Right now, Dr. Purple is the only one MIA. If you want to go back for the bodies of the dead, I won’t stop you. The hull is sealed off, but I don’t know if that will hold.”

Commotion and debate arose among the survivors.

“Do we have walkies?” I finally said.

Nantucket and the others looked at me.

“A few, mainly for the scientists, but what’s up?” he asked.

“Give me one. We’ll take a few guys in and see what we can do about this thing. Bobcat will take one and be our eyes in the hull.”

“Okay,” said Nantucket.

“I’ll take one too,” said Charger. He stood up.

“Let’s get you boys armed,” said Nantucket. I took the lead, along with me were Charger, Jules, and two other grunts I knew, Frazier and Dante, who still wore his *Clerks* shirt. It would be enough of a ragtag group to hopefully stop the madness.

Nantucket opened the locker. There were three radios. I took one, so did Charger. We each took a Daniel Defense AR with a 10-round magazine.

Fucking California Compliance.

Illegal experiments at sea were fine, but god-forbid we piss off the ATF.

We each took four mags each. At least carrying 10 rounds was easier than carrying four 30-round mags. I took a Sig Sauer as a sidearm. If I were getting mauled, I was going down swinging. Nantucket passed out flashlights.

“Good luck,” he said.

“Whoever bags it gets a bonus, right?”

“Ask me, you get bonuses for going down there,” said Nantucket. He turned and walked up the stairs. I held the rifle close and waited for Bobcat to chime in.

With a static and crack, I heard him.

“Alright, I’m in.”

I raised my thumb up to a camera.

“Can you see me?”

“Aye, aye, Ike.”

I took a deep breath. This was just another patrol. That’s all.

I spun open the door, and we started walking through. We turned the flashlights on and started our way down the hall.

“IKE, GUYS, BEHIND YOU!”

I turned around. Crawling from the roof and wrapping around the door was the thing. In 20 minutes, it had grown from about 2 feet long to 5 feet tall. It had full arms and could climb. Its pale skin was now steel grey.

It could camouflage.

We raised our rifles and fired. It was deafening. The beast slid down and Frazier by his ankle. He yanked him down with such force that his leg popped clean off. He screamed. It was more deafening than the rifle shots.

The thing lifted its head and burrowed its big jaws into the man’s chest.

Charger fired at the thing’s skull. It only stopped when a round struck it in the eye. It bled from where its eyes used to be. It didn’t roar or react; instead, it grabbed the carcass with its free hand and scurried into the darkness.  

“Anyone else hurt?” asked Charger. I dropped my magazine and reloaded.

“I’m good,” said Jules.

“Me, me too,” said the other. 

I took a deep breath.

We turned on our flashlights and held them close. The only way to the beast was to keep going.

As we reached the end of the hall, the fluorescent lights nearly blinded us when we got in. This was the big box. The sides were reinforced with titanium. The glass cage was shattered. Blood streaked across the floor. One of the scientists lay decapitated, his head nastily bitten off. The whole area reeked of rotting flesh. We searched high and low. Glass shattered under our boots.

“Holy shit!” yelled Jules. We rushed his position. He found a biohazard bin. Inside were easily a dozen, probably more, of the ‘base’. The white thin object was meant to become the specimen. At the top were the ones that got closest. Some had half-formed faces, others limbs. One had half a leg. They all stunk of decay.

“I’m gonna be sick,” said Charger. He found an empty bin and hurled.

The sound of metal crunching came from one of the side halls.

“Jules, with me, you two, stay and see if anyone else here survived.”

I took the lead. Jules was close behind.

“I shoulda never taken this job,” he said. His hands were shaking.

“Neither should I,” I said with a smile. It was fake. My nerves were fried, and my hip was hurting. I had to fight through. Can’t take charge and crap out.

I stopped in front of what seemed like the tail. That thing grew quick. It wasn’t even an hour, and it had an additional limb. I looked up to trace the beast, see if I could see underneath it. That’s when it shook and pulled up.

That wasn’t a tail.

That was its arm.

The top floor of the deck was collapsing.

“Go, go, go, go, go!” I yelled. Jules didn’t take much convincing. We turned around as the deck above us came tumbling down. The door felt like miles away. I dove, losing my rifle, but I landed.

I turned, expecting Jules right behind me.

But he wasn’t.

“Ike, I’m almost there!” I watched him jump forward. I reached out to grab him. Our arms locked fast and firm. That’s when four long grey claws came from the darkness and snatched his torso.

He screamed, and blood squirted from his mouth. With a crunch, we all knew his ribs were broken.

I dropped to the ground with his arms in mine. Charger grabbed his arms, and Dante fired into the darkness.

“Please, don’t let me die like that,” Jules groaned.

“I won’t kid, hang on,” I said.

A single gunshot rang out, causing Charger and me to drop him. In that split second, we only saw where the bullet went into Jules’ head.

The beast roared and dragged Jules into the depths of the boat.

Behind us was Dr. Purple with my Sig Sauer in his hand.  

“You piece of shit!” I yelled. Charger didn’t hesitate; he shot the doctor in the stomach. The doctor fell to the ground. I grabbed the handgun off the floor and tucked it into my waistband.

“Do you know what you’ve done?” choked the doctor.

“I don’t give a fuck,” said Charger. He walked away.

“What is that thing?” I asked. The doctor shook his head.

“You killed me. That means no payment for any of you. That man was a goner; once he was in the claws, he was dead.”              

“Man? He was 19!”

The doctor said nothing. I dropped my boot onto his knee. He recoiled in pain. I got in close.

“What is that thing?”

“It’s a success, that’s what it is.”

I pressed down hard.

“No games, what the fuck is that!?”

“It’s an amalgamation. I wanted to see how certain DNAs interacted and what they formed. This one seemed to be the most compatible.”

“What DNA!”

“Doesn’t matter. I’m dead anyway.”

I punched the wound. He jolted and spat blood.

“Takes a long time to bleed out from a gut shot, Doc.”

He shook his head. His lips were already drying out.

“The base is Monitor lizard, then we started adding. Various species of venomous fish, like the Cuttlefish, squid, we even tried whale.”

“What the fuck is in that one?” I asked less curious and more panicked.

“Monitor, Humboldt Squid, Cuttlefish, Rhinoceros, Sperm Whale, and Human.”

“You put human DNA in there!”

“Had plenty of it,” he said with a sickening grin.

Then I realized something, part whale, it could hear us.

With a loud bang, the ship shook. The thing was still growing. It was still trying to kill everything onboard.  

“Let’s move,” I said.

“What about him?” asked Dante. I watched as the creature’s back broke through the floor. It’s ugly, regrown eye, which was still covered by a thin layer of skin, peered from the crack.

“Leave him.” No one argued as we turned around and left the lab.

Dr. Purple’s screams followed us until a loud squelch silenced them. 

I radioed Bobcat down. When we got topside, the few survivors stood in a semi-circle. Poacher died; white foam poured from his agape mouth. The toxins from the beast infected the wound and killed him quickly.

There weren’t many of us left. Killing this thing was the only option.

Charger explained the situation as best he could. Once he was done, Nantucket pulled me aside.

“If everything you said is true, sinking the ship might be our best bet.”

“Are you fucking crazy? Sink the ship.”

“We have lifeboats. We can escape. Get far enough away and send out the SOS.”

“So much for the no SOS clause.”

“Lennard, Purple is dead; there is no sense in preserving this.”

The slip was fatal. Lennard had to be Doctor Curtis Lennard from Johns Hopkins. I didn’t read much science stuff, but he made a big name for himself during the pandemic. Mainly for his work on rDNA vaccines. He understood the science well. Of course, three years after the pandemic and dozens of conspiracy theories later, he was kicked out of Hopkins and practically blacklisted for ejecting cancer patients with lobster DNA to see how it would help treatment.

Spoiler alert: it made them sick.

Medical genius or mad scientist didn’t seem that far apart.

“How did you end up here, working for him?” I asked.

Nantucket smirked.

“Opioid addiction makes you do crazy things. I needed money for pills or rehab, whichever seems right after this.”

“Makes you feel any better, I took it to fix my gambling debts.”

“Well, I hope we make it to enjoy healthier lifestyles.”

I nodded. Nantucket took a deep breath and walked in front of the survivors.

“Okay, here’s the plan. Ike, Charger, and I will go to the engine room; we’ll overcharge the engine and detonate the ship. That will cause the ship to sink fast and cause a vortex. That thing will likely be unable to escape the ship when that happens. Doctor Anastasia will lead the rest of you to the lifeboats. Each of you take a walkie so we can communicate. From there, we’ll deploy the SOS.”

Everyone nodded.

Everyone understood.

The three was us went down into the catacombs of the Alaskan Dawn.

We kept the flashlights on; there were no lights down there. The hallways felt tight. The foul stench of abomination whiffed through the halls. It got to the point where Nantucket covered his mouth with a cloth. The metal creaked.

Then snapped.

A large column slammed around them. It was the thing's leg. I looked up the hole and saw the torso. The tail went down and entire hallway.

“Run,” I said.  

Our steps began to echo, and that’s when the beast turned around above us. The metal churned as it lifted its leg and maneuvered its way behind us. As we sprinted, it gained on us. The rot from its breath stained the back of our shirts. Its jaws snapped at them. Stopping to shoot wasn’t an option.

“We’re almost there!” yelled Nantucket.

I thought we were far enough from the snapping jaws.

Eventually, it got one of us.

Charger.

His death was quick, one snap, and he was folded in half. It was down the beast’s throat before I could react.

Nantucket held the door so I could get in and then slammed it. The beast rammed into the door, but it could not break it down. As I gasped for air, I heard it retreat. Nantucket had the plan; he started opening up valves and letting gas out.

“Ike, you should go,” he said, flatly.

“What, why?” I asked.

“Only one of us needs to be here for this to go off, and” his voice trailed off. He took a deep breath.

“Before I took this job, I was in jail. Held because I accidentally ran my son over while I was high. He’ll never walk again because of my actions. I don’t deserve a second chance. If you get out, you deserve one. Good luck.”

I said nothing in the argument. I patted him on the back and walked out. I heard the door slam behind me, and I started to ascend from the depths.

I found a lifeboat and boarded it solo. The others already were in the water, floating nearby. I managed to start the boat up and head out.

“Ike, Ike, you okay?” asked Bobcat.

“Copy Bobcat.”

From our lifeboats, we saw the top of the Alaskan Dawn peel back. The beast burst out of the top of the ship. Its upper body was huge. The thickness of his body showed, and its skin was a light bluish grey color. One eye was black and the other, the one Charger shot out, was yellow. One arm snuck out of the hull and snaked like a tentacle.

It grabbed the other lifeboat and squeezed tight. The windows blew out. I heard gunfire come from the boat as it was lifted.

Then the explosion erupted. Fire came out of the rear of the ship. I ducked as shrapnel ripped across the ocean. Metal ripped through the top of my lifeboat.

The Alaskan Dawn started to capsize. Within minutes, the ship, the beast, and the survivors were underwater.

Nantucket was right; the vortex almost instantly and pulled everything under water.

When the ocean was still, I started attempting an SOS.

I was out on the ocean for at least a week. It took a Japanese fishing ship to find me. They brought me back to the country. It took me about two months to recover, and thank god for the Japanese healthcare system being free. My doctor, Tsuneo Miyamoto, told me that if I had been out there for another day, I likely wouldn’t have been able to be saved.

While I recovered, a Navy Master-at-Arms came to my room and gave me a light interrogation as to what the hell I was doing on a lifeboat, alone, in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. I lied, I don’t even remember if my lie was convincing. Truth is, I don’t know what Lennard’s plan was; for all I know, it could’ve been a government contract. All I knew was that whatever that science was, it was best left at the bottom of the ocean.

I used my down time at the hospital to look for jobs in Japan. English teaching jobs were the only thing I was good enough for. Thankfully the USD could be stretched further in the Japan than my home country.

I hope to start a new life here.

But I am haunted by one thing in the back of my mind.

The beast, that thing, had whale DNA in it.

One Signature.’ — What Heartbreaking Divorce Novel Is This From?,"Four years of marriage. One signature—his own—that set me free, though he never realized what he was signing.

I was Sophia Moretti, the invisible wife of James Moretti, heir to the city’s most powerful mafia family. But when his childhood sweetheart, the dazzling and privileged Vicky, returned, I finally understood: I had always been temporary.

So I played my final move. I slid the papers across his desk—divorce disguised as routine university forms. James signed without a second glance, his fountain pen scratching across the page as carelessly as he'd treated our vows, without noticing he was ending our marriage.

But I walked away with more than my freedom. Beneath my coat, I carried his unborn heir—a secret that could destroy him when he finally realized what he'd lost.

Now, the man who never noticed me is tearing the world apart trying to find me. From his penthouse to the underworld's gutters, he's turning over every stone. But I'm not some trembling prey waiting to be found.

I rebuilt myself beyond his reach—where not even a Moretti can follow.

This time, I won't be begging for his love.

He'll be begging for mine.

Chapter 1

I walked into the law office with my divorce papers clutched in my hand. Four years. Four years as Sophia Moretti, wife of James Moretti, heir to the most powerful mafia family in the city.

Today, it ended.

The lawyer didn’t even look up when I walked in.

""I’d like to file for divorce,"" I said, placing the papers on his desk.

He finally glanced at me—messy ponytail, faded jeans, my backpack still slung over one shoulder. His expression turned stern. ""Young lady, divorce isn’t something you file on a whim.""

I understood why he didn’t take me seriously. I looked like a college student who had wandered into the wrong office, not someone who had been married for four years.

But I was prepared.

""Just stamp the papers,"" I said calmly. ""I’ll get my husband’s signature.""

The Moretti estate was too quiet when I returned. The guards at the gate didn't even blink as I passed—just another invisible fixture in James' world.

I headed straight for James' study. The door was slightly open, and I could hear laughter inside.

Then I smelled it.

Truffles.

James always said he hated strong smells in the house. No garlic, no fish, nothing that lingered. But now, the air was thick with the scent of expensive white truffles, the kind you only get if you are the right person.

I pushed the door open.

There he was. James Moretti, my husband, sitting at his desk, relaxed in a way I'd never seen with me. And beside him was Vicky Rossi, his childhood best friend, back in the city this year after her divorce.

She was feeding him a piece of bread covered in truffles, her fingers lingering just a second too long.

Then James saw me. His smile disappeared.

""Sophia,"" he said, voice cool. ""I didn't expect you back so soon.""

Vicky turned, her perfect red lips curling into a smile. ""Oh, Sophia! We were just having a snack. There's only enough for two, but I'm sure we can—”

""I'm fine."" I cut her off, stepping forward.

I slid the document across the polished mahogany desk, the rustle of paper unnaturally loud in the silent study. James barely glanced up from his whiskey with his glass froze midway to his lips. James' eyes narrowed slightly. ""What's this?""

""The university needs a signed safety liability form,"" I flipped it open to the signature page.

""For my research project,"" I swallowed. ""Since you're my only family now.""

The truth sat heavy between us. My parents had been gone for years, killed in a suspicious car accident that first pushed me into James' world. He knew better than anyone how alone I was.

James frowned, ""Let me see that—"" My nerves suddenly tightened like piano wires. He never asked to read anything. Normally he'd just sign whatever university paperwork I put in front of him without a second glance.

Why today? Why now?

""Oh James,"" Vicky laughed, placing a hand on his arm. ""You're too serious! It's just a form. You remember how many forms we had to sign for the charity gala last month?""

As the heiress to Rossi Enterprises, one of the Moretti family's most important business partners, Vicky had moved effortlessly in James' world since her return. They were always together now, at galas, auctions, and those smoky backroom poker games where deals got made. Everywhere James went these days, Vicky seemed to appear at his elbow, her designer dresses complementing his tailored suits like they were a matched set.

He hesitated, then grabbed his fountain pen and signed with a quick flourish, the same way he signed death warrants and business deals.

I took the papers back before he could see the bold ""DIVORCE PETITION"" header on the first page.

Vicky smirked, ""Honestly, James, you treat her more like a kid sister than a wife.""

James didn't deny it. Just took a sip of whiskey.

I turned and walked out before they could see my hands shake.

The door closed behind me.

I was free.

Walking through the marble halls of the Moretti mansion, I clutched the signed divorce papers in my hand. The ink was barely dry, but the marriage had been over long before today.

I remembered how different James used to be. The way his warm hands would trace my spine when he thought I was asleep. The possessive way he'd pull me into shadowed corners at family gatherings, his mouth hot against mine.

Now he barely looked at me.

My parents died when I was sixteen. Don Moretti, the reigning head of the Moretti mafia family at the time, took me in as a favor to my father—his former driver who'd taken a bullet for him. That's how I ended up living under the same roof as James Moretti.

James was everything I shouldn't want. Cold. Dangerous. Ruthless. By twenty-five, he'd already taken over half his father's operations. The newspapers called him a ""young entrepreneur."" The streets knew better.

I kept my distance at first. Made myself invisible. Until that night four years ago, when James came home covered in someone else's blood.

He found me in the kitchen patching up my own knife wound, a gift from one of his father's men who thought the boss's charity case made easy prey.

James didn't speak. Just took the bandages from my shaking hands and cleaned the cut himself. When his thumb brushed my inner thigh, I should have pushed him away.

Instead, I pulled him closer.

We married three weeks later. A business arrangement, James called it. Protection for me, legitimacy for him. I almost believed him—until Vicky Rossi came back to town and suddenly his late meetings doubled.

Vicky. The Rossi heiress. Their construction empire worked closely with the Moretti family. Since returning after her divorce, And now that her French husband had filed for divorce, she'd become a constant presence——slipping into James' meetings, his cars, his life.

Last month proved it.

I'd waited six hours at Dante's—the restaurant James owned through a shell company—for our anniversary dinner. His right-hand man Michael finally showed up at midnight with a diamond bracelet and an excuse about ""business troubles.""

The next morning, I saw the photos in the gossip column: James and Vicky at the opera, her fingers tucked in his tuxedo pocket where he usually kept his gun.

That's when I started planning my exit.

The divorce papers were my final exam. James signed them without reading—too distracted by Vicky feeding him stolen glances and stolen kisses.

Now, standing in the mansion's gilded foyer, I traced the notary's embossed seal with my thumb. In a month, this paper would be my ticket to freedom.

No more gilded cages. No more pretending.

James could keep his empire. His violence. His Vicky.

I wanted my life back.

Chapter 2

Vicky claimed her penthouse needed renovations after her return. That’s how she ended up in our guest suite—temporarily, of course.

James approved it before I could object. ""The Rossis have been business partners for for decades,"" he said, as if that explained everything.

Now she floated through our home like she owned it—lounging by the pool in designer bikinis, hosting her parties in our wine cellar, always finding reasons to interrupt when James and I were alone.

Tonight, I caught them in the study, heads bent over some legal documents. Vicky’s long finger traced a line on the paper, lingering too close to James’ hand.

""Sophia!"" She smiled when she noticed me. ""We're planning my new home theater. You should join us.""

""I have lab reports to grade,"" I said, clutching my nightgown. We're divorced now. Whatever James does. Whoever he's with. It's none of my business.

Vicky's laugh tinkled like broken glass. ""Always buried in your books! James used to do my math homework when we were kids - you tutored me yourself, didn't you James? My math skills are all thanks to you.""

James chuckled lightly. ""Math was simpler than laundering casino profits."" His eyes flicked briefly to me, a silent check for reaction.

I kept my face carefully blank, staring at my feet. How touching, their childhood bond still going strong after all these years. I'd just be here, counting the days until I could escape this charming reunion.

By midnight, I was reviewing lab data when James entered our bedroom. The scent of whiskey and Vicky’s cloying perfume clung to his shirt as he sat beside me on the bed.

""Still working?"" His fingers brushed my shoulder.

I stiffened instinctively. Yet when his hand slid down my spine, I arched into his touch like a starving woman offered crumbs.

Pathetic, some rational part of my brain whispered. But four years of loneliness had carved a hollow space inside me that only James could temporarily fill, even if he'd never stay.

His lips found my neck as he unbuttoned the front of my nightgown. I closed my eyes and let myself forget—

—until my stomach turned violently.

""Sophia?"" James froze as I clapped a hand over my mouth.

The queasy feeling disappeared as fast as it hit me. ""Just...ate something odd at the lab today,"" I offered weakly. The birth control pills I took religiously made pregnancy impossible, but my stomach seemed to rebel at the thought of Vicky sleeping right beneath us while James touched me.

Just then, a crash came from downstairs.

""James?"" Vicky’s voice floated up the staircase, trembling. ""I heard glass breaking... I think someone’s in the house.""

I felt James’ body tense. Duty called.

He was out of bed before I could speak, grabbing the pistol from his nightstand. ""Stay here,"" he ordered, already halfway to the door.

Turned out to be nothing—just the housekeeper dropping a plate. But when James returned hours later, he went straight to the shower without a word. I pretended to be asleep.

The next morning, I nearly choked on my coffee when I saw James flipping through my research institute application forms—the ones I’d stupidly left on the kitchen counter. My stomach tightened.

""Biomedical engineering?"" He held up the application to the Swiss institute's application, his brow arched. "" When did you arrange this overseas project?""

I forced a shrug. ""My classmate asked me to grab the forms for her."" My fingers curled into my palms—out of sight, out of mind—but not before I caught the faint tremor in my pinky finger. Damn it.

James turned a page, scanning the details. ""Zurich. You’d hate the snow.""

Of course he didn’t remember. Two winters ago, I’d dragged him to a cabin in Vermont just to watch the flakes fall. He’d spent the whole time on the phone with his lawyers.

I didn't respond. Just look at him coldly.

He set down his coffee, his dark eyes locking onto mine with unsettling intensity. ""You don’t need another degree. I could appoint you lead researcher at Moretti Medical tomorrow.""

That’s the problem. Every achievement I had, every paper, every grant, was shadowed by the Moretti name. I opened my mouth to retort when Vicky’s laughter cut through the tension.

""Morning, darlings!"" She breezed in, her silk robe fluttering as she perched on the arm of James’ chair. ""James, the lawyers need us to review the new casino contracts before noon."" Her slender fingers brushed against James' shoulder in a familiar gesture.

James stood up without another glance at my applications. ""We’ll take it in the study.""

As they disappeared down the hall, I yanked the forms back. My hand steadied as I reached the Marital Status.

Single.

Chapter 3

The research fellowship in Switzerland would last for four years. The director had emailed twice already, eager for me to start by fall. Four years abroad. Far from James. Far from Vicky. I sent ""Accept"" before I could overthink it.

Last night played on repeat in my mind. I'd actually considered—just one last time—initiating something with James. A final memory to take with me. But he'd spent the evening with Vicky, probably whispering sweet nothings under the moon.

That's the difference between love and...whatever this is.

What I couldn't understand was how a man could feign desire so convincingly for someone he didn't love. To prevent a repeat of last night's humiliation, I decided to clear out my things today. Three weeks until the divorce was finalized. Three weeks of avoiding this house.

Most of my life was already at campus housing—just one suitcase of clothes here. The only personal item was the photo album in the nightstand.

I flipped through the thick leather cover. Every month like clockwork, I'd dragged James to a photo studio. Me smiling like an idiot. Him stiff as a statue, looking anywhere but at the camera.

The album landed in the trash bin with a thud. Even the recycling truck wouldn't want this tainted love story.

For years, I'd been an audience member in James Moretti's life. Now the curtain had fallen. Time to make my exit.

The next two weeks blurred with thesis revisions and lab work. I barely thought of James—until his call interrupted my Friday research meeting.

""I'm outside your lab,"" his voice crackled through the phone.

Since when does James Moretti play chauffeur?

His black sedan idled at the curb. I slid into the leather seat, inhaling the familiar scent of his cologne and gun oil.

""You haven't been home."" His eyes stayed on the road.

""Lab's busy.""

""Good."" His fingers tapped the steering wheel. ""Vicky thought you were avoiding her. She's moving out next month—says it's 'inappropriate' now.""

I yawned. ""Tell her not to bother. I don't care.""

James' grip tightened on the steering wheel, his knuckles paling to bone-white. A flicker of surprise crossed his face. He opened his mouth—probably to praise my ""maturity""—but stopped when he noticed my closed eyes.

I feigned sleep to avoid conversation, but the exhaustion was real. For the first time in years, my dreams weren't about him.

Ten days until Switzerland.

I stood in the supermarket aisle, staring at the dried hawthorn slices in my hand. I hadn't eaten these since childhood, but lately my stomach churned at everything else. My recent period had also been delayed.

The pregnancy test confirmed my fears.

""twelve weeks along,"" the doctor said cheerfully. ""Congratulations!""

I nearly laughed. Twelve weeks. That meant it happened during James' and my last time together—right before Vicky returned.

My hands shook as I dialed James' number. At twenty-four, facing this alone terrified me—

A familiar ringtone echoed down the hallway.

James stood twenty feet away, his black coat draped over Vicky's shoulders as she whispered something that made him smile. I hung up and ducked into the stairwell.

""—avoid strenuous activity,"" the doctor's voice carried through the cracked door. ""And no intercourse for two months.""

Vicky was pregnant too.

""I'll make sure she rests,"" James said, that tender tone I rarely heard.

I shot out of the stairwell like a bullet, desperate to escape, only to crash straight into a nurse carrying medical charts. The papers went flying as we collided, creating just enough noise to draw attention from down the hall.

James emerged from the examination room just in time to see me scrambling to help pick up the scattered documents, my face burning with the effort to appear composed.

""Sophia?"" He frowned, stepping forward. ""Why are you here?""

""Stomachache."" I crumpled the ultrasound slip in my pocket.

Vicky materialized beside him, clutching her own scan. ""James told me you skip meals."" She patted his arm. ""We should get her some ginger tea.""

I couldn't tear my eyes away from the ultrasound photo in Vicky's hand. The grainy black-and-white image seemed to pulse under the harsh hospital lights.

James' face went pale. ""Sophia, let me expl—""

""James!"" Vicky's fingers dug into his sleeve like claws, her voice dripping with false sweetness. ""We talked about this.""

I saw the conflict play out across his face, the way his muscles tensed, how his hand twitched before curling into a fist.

Then Vicky pressed her cheek against his shoulder, whispering something that made him freeze. His arm dropped to his side like a dead weight.

I turned away before they could see my face crumple. Behind me, I heard James take a half-step forward—

""James!"" Vicky's voice turned sharp. ""You promised.""

The elevator doors closed on the image of my husband standing frozen between two women, his eyes locked on me with something that almost looked like regret.

Outside, winter air slapped my face. The research acceptance letter lay buried at the bottom of my backpack. Four years. A groundbreaking study. A life far from this mess.

And now—a baby.

My hand rested on my stomach—still flat, but everything had changed. The sidewalk stretched endlessly in both directions.

For the first time in my life, I had nowhere to go.

Chapter 4

For forty-eight hours, I'd been drafting and deleting emails to the research institute. How do I tell the director I accidentally pregnant by my soon-to-be-ex husband? My fingers hovered over the keyboard when my phone buzzed.

Michael: Boss wants to see you at the gates.

Since when did James send his right-man as a messenger boy?

I spotted James leaning casually against his Mercedes, the morning sunlight softening his sharp features in a way that made my breath catch for a moment. The way the light traced his jawline, the slight crinkle at the corners of his eyes as he noticed my approach - it was unfair how my pulse still quickened at the sight of him after everything.

I quickly looked away, fingers fumbling with my backpack strap as if it demanded all my attention. Four years of marriage, and my traitorous body still reacted to him like we were newlyweds. The heat that rose to my cheeks, the way my skin remembered his touch - biological betrayals I refused to acknowledge. Old habits, I told myself firmly. Just muscle memory, nothing more.

""Sophia."" He removed his glasses, revealing those dark eyes that used to make my knees weak. ""Dinner tomorrow. Dante's. Eight o'clock.""

Dante's. The name alone sent acid creeping up my throat. That was where I'd sat for six hours on our anniversary, staring at cold osso buco while James ""handled business"" with Vicky.

""I'll be there,"" I heard myself say, the words leaping from my lips before I could temper them. The automatic response surprised even me—why so eager to sit across from the man who'd chosen Vicky over me at every turn?

But hesitation would raise suspicions. James could smell weakness like blood in the water. If I was going to keep this baby—and I had every intention to—I needed to do things right. Hiding the pregnancy meant nothing if I didn't first sever all legal ties between us. James Moretti wasn't the type to let anything slip through his fingers, least of all a child. And if he ever found out I'd kept his heir from him...

No. The divorce had to come first. Clean. Official. Irreversible.

This dinner would serve two purposes: First, the divorce. Then, when oceans separated us, I'd decide how to tell him about the baby. If ever.

The restaurant's chandeliers cast knife-sharp shadows across the white tablecloths. Tonight, he'd chosen the private wine cellar where we'd had our first date.

His fingers wrapped around mine as he set down the Barolo bottle—not just brushing past, but actually holding my hand for the first time in four years.

""There's something I need to explain about what happened—""

The cellar door crashed open. Michael rushed to his side, whispering urgently against his ear. But in the tomb-like quiet of the stone-walled cellar, the words ""Vicky"", ""cut her wrist"" and ""emergency"" slithered to my ears regardless.

My stomach dropped. Of course. Even our last dinner couldn't be just ours.

James' grip on my hand released as he shot to his feet, his chair screeching backward before toppling with a crash. ""What?!""

The room spun. My vision tunneled until all I could see was James' retreating back, his coat flaring like a cape.

He paused at the doorway just long enough to glance between Michael and me—a fraction of a second's calculation. ""Take her to the hospital,"" he ordered before disappearing up the stairs.

Then—nothing.

Fragments of conversation drifted through the haze:

""...just low blood sugar...""

""...get her some orange juice...""

My eyelids fluttered open to blurred shapes - the doctor speaking with Michael by the doorway. A jolt of panic shot through me as consciousness returned. If they discover the pregnancy...

The doctor leaned closer to Michael, her voice dropping to a murmur. ""And considering the patient's condit—""

My dry throat constricted. I had to stop her—

BRRRRT!

Michael's phone screamed like a fire alarm. He ripped it from his pocket, the caller ID making him snap to attention. ""Yes, boss?"" A beat. His jaw tightened. ""Understood. On my way now, sir.""

He slapped a black credit card onto the doctor's clipboard. ""Keep her here till New Year's if you want."" The door rattled in its frame as he vanished, the doctor's lips still parted around the unspoken ""pregnant"".

""Ah, you're awake."" She turned to me, oblivious to my racing pulse. ""You're approximately thirteen weeks along. Baby's healthy, but given your collapse..."" Her pen scratched across a notepad. ""We'll keep you 48 hours for monitoring.""

She hesitated, glancing at the door. ""I didn't mention this to your... companion earlier.""

I exhaled in quiet relief. ""No. And please keep it that way.""

As the doctor stepping out, the nurses' hushed voices slithered under the curtain:

"" Mr. and Mrs. Moretti are like royalty—They've turned Suite 801 into a penthouse - rose petals, champagne, the works. Mr. Moretti hasn't left her side since admission.""

""Would you expect less? Did you see how he carried her through the lobby? Like some romantic film.""

A sigh. ""Ten years together and he still treats her like a bride. Meanwhile my husband forgets our anniversary...""

Their words cut deeper than any knife. There was no question – they could only be talking about James and Vicky.

""Of course he's devoted – Mrs. Moretti's finally giving him an heir. Mr. Moretti’d commanded an army of specialists at her slightest sigh.""

James treated Vicky like a queen. I became acutely aware of my chipped nail polish against the starch hospital sheets - the lone Moretti wife no one remembered to pamper.

After two nights of observation with no complications, I was discharged.

Stepping out of the hospital's automatic doors, I spotted Emma waiting by the curb, the manila envelope clutched in her hands.

Stepping through the hospital's sliding doors, my first stop was the courthouse to collect the divorce decree. As I arranged for James' copy to be mailed—with a deliberate three-day delay—a quiet satisfaction settled in my chest.

By the time this reaches his desk, I thought, watching the clerk stamp the postmark, I'll be in Zurich. Let the mighty James Moretti turn over every stone in the world. But even his power has limits—and I just became one of them.

The envelope disappeared into the mailbox with a soft thud—four years of love, lies and loneliness now condensed into a single document that would chase my shadow across the ocean.

Chapter 5

I stared at the sent email—the one confessing my pregnancy to the Swiss institute. Now, there was nothing to do but wait. I placed my hand on my stomach almost unconsciously, as if to reassure us both.

The director replied within hours:

""Congratulations on this new chapter! We've prepared family housing just steps from the lab, and Dr. Laurent's wife, our chief obstetrician, has personally reserved all your prenatal appointments. Most importantly—we're dispatching a team member to escort you from the airport door to your new home. No luggage handling, no queues, no stress whatsoever!""

I stared at the screen. No hesitation. No judgment. Just support. Something tightened in my chest—maybe the first real hope I'd felt since seeing those two pink lines.

""Thank you,"" I typed back, ""for valuing me beyond my current circumstances.""

On the day of my departure, I stood nervously at the arrivals gate, scanning the crowd for my institute contact. A voice called out - ""Sophia?""

I turned to see a lanky man with gentle eyes pushing through the crowd. Eric, according to his badge, greeted me with a warmth that immediately put me at ease. He took my single suitcase carefully, as if handling rare artifacts. ""Priority boarding is ready,"" he smiled. ""The director insisted on VIP treatment for our star researcher.""

As Eric maneuvered toward me, his shoulder briefly blocked my view of a commotion near the VIP lounge—where James stood with Vicky clinging to his arm, their backs turned as they greeted a group of Middle Eastern businessmen.

At that precise moment, James stiffened.

""Did someone just call Sophia?""

Vicky's crystalline laugh bounced off. ""Don't be ridiculous, James. Sophia is probably buried in lab right now."" Vicky said as she pulled James toward a champagne reception.

We disappeared into the shuffling queue before his gaze could sweep our direction.

As we walked toward the gate, Eric animatedly described the lab's new two-photon microscope. ""Dr. Laurent had it installed specifically for your protein research,"" he said, eyes bright with the kind of academic passion I'd nearly forgotten existed.

He adjusted his grip on my suitcase. ""Oh, and the team unanimously voted to adopt your preferred schedule—no morning meetings before nine, and absolutely no evening work.""

I pressed a hand to my sternum. These people, who'd never met me, had tried hard to anticipate my needs better than James ever had in four years of marriage.

At security, Eric handed me a stack of postcards—the Alps glittering under cheap gloss. ""For writing home,"" he said with an encouraging nod.

The trash bin swallowed them whole.

Eric blinked. ""No one to write to?""

I glanced back at the terminal windows, where the city skyline stood sharp against the dawn. Somewhere out there, James was probably reviewing Vicky's latest ultrasound photos over breakfast, her diamond-crusted hand resting on his arm.

""Not anymore,"" I said, turning toward the gate.

The plane rumbled to life beneath us. Eric prattled about Zurich's farmer's markets—""The peaches in August! You'll think you've tasted sunlight!""—while I pressed a hand to the window.

Goodbye to photos where only one of us smiled.

Goodbye to the mansion that never felt like home.

Goodbye, James.",1,1754597201.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

1mkai1h,https://crimsoncent.com/how-to-plan-personal-finances-like-a-multi-billion-dollar-company/,How to Plan Your Personal Finances Like a Multi-Billion Dollar Company,"**How to Plan Your Personal Finances Like a Multi-Billion Dollar Company**

This isn’t a guide to *becoming* a billion-dollar company—it’s about managing your money with the same discipline those companies use. Because let’s be real: wealthy companies don’t just “hope for the best.” They have *systems*.

You can do the same.

**Step 1: Your Personal Earnings Report**  
Like a quarterly earnings report, track:

**Income:**

* Salary
* Side gigs
* Passive income (rentals, dividends, etc.)

**Expenses:**

* Rent/mortgage
* Groceries, bills, transport, debt
* Subscriptions + “small stuff” (coffee, impulse buys)

**Monthly goal:**  
📈 **Income – Expenses = Positive Cash Flow**

If you’re in the red, your priority is to cut costs or raise income. Just like a company—you can’t grow if you’re not profitable.

**Step 2: Short-Term Plan (1–5 Years)**  
Think of this as laying the foundation.

🔹 **Boost income** – Negotiate raises, add side hustles, level up your skills.  
🔹 **Manage spending** – Plan for big costs *before* they hit.  
🔹 **Pay down debt** – Especially high-interest debt. It’s a silent killer.  
🔹 **Save consistently** – Aim for 10–20% of your income.

Treat your income like revenue. Treat your spending like operating costs. Profit = freedom.

**Step 3: Long-Term Plan (10–20 Years)**  
This is your growth strategy.

📌 **Diversify income** – Start a business, invest, build passive income.  
📌 **Invest early & often** – Retirement accounts, index funds, compound interest.  
📌 **Make big moves strategically** – Buy a home? Start a family? Plan it.  
📌 **Stick to the plan** – You don’t need to be perfect. You just need to be *consistent*.

**Final Thoughts**  
Multi-billion-dollar companies don’t leave their finances to chance—and neither should you.

Track. Plan. Adjust. Repeat.  
You don’t need to earn millions to build wealth. You need clarity, systems, and time.

Act like the CFO of *your own life.*",1,1754597143.0,u_Defiant_Wrongdoer547,0,1.0,False

The key paused just outside the lock, trembling between my fingers. My knuckles were pale from the pressure, and beneath my scrubs, sweat clung to my spine.

Ten hours in the ER had left me hollowed out—another endless stream of traumas, code blues, and unspoken grief. My shoulders ached from tension I hadn’t noticed until I tried to exhale.

All I wanted was a hot shower, a glass of wine, and the quiet comfort of Alexander’s arms. That thought—the image of his arms around me—had been the only thing keeping me upright during the final hour of my shift.

The deadbolt gave way with a soft click. I stepped inside.

The house was quiet. Too quiet.

Alexander’s briefcase sat near the door, a corner of his monogrammed handkerchief peeking out. His keys were tossed haphazardly beside the ceramic bowl where I always placed mine. But what stopped me cold was the unfamiliar flash of crimson next to them. A handbag. Red Hermès. Victoria’s.

My stomach gave a slow turn.

She must have dropped by unannounced. Maybe to go over the final seating chart for the foundation gala next month. She often came by when Alexander and I were both home—never when I was alone. Still, something felt off. My shoes came off with a quiet sigh as I padded across the marble floor, each step slow and uncertain.

Then I heard it.

A woman’s laugh.

Muffled. Breathless. Intimate.

I froze. My pulse thudded against my eardrums as I strained to listen.

A man's voice followed—deep, smooth, and low with something that sounded like pleasure. Alexander’s voice. But not the tone he used with me. This one was softer. Almost reverent.

I moved toward the source of the sound—the study. The door was slightly ajar, a thin edge of light spilling into the hallway like a blade.

“They’re probably just talking,” I whispered to myself. “Just... planning.”

But my hand was already rising, fingers brushing the door. Some part of me—a desperate, clinging part—still hoped I was wrong.

I pushed it open.

The scent struck me first—something floral and sweet, too strong for a room that should’ve smelled like old books and leather. The overhead lamp cast a golden pool of light across the desk, illuminating a scene so vivid it stole the air from my lungs.

Victoria was perched on the edge of Alexander’s desk, her silk blouse unbuttoned to the navel, skirt bunched around her hips. Her legs were wrapped around my husband’s waist. His hands gripped the backs of her thighs, anchoring her to him. His dress shirt was open, his pants halfway down, exposing skin I knew too well.

They didn’t flinch. They didn’t scramble apart. They just turned—together—as though I were an interruption to a business meeting.

“Elena.” Alexander’s voice was calm. Measured. The same voice he used at campaign fundraisers. “You’re home early.”

The walls of the room seemed to curve inward. I gripped the frame to steady myself. My throat felt raw.

“What... are you doing?” The words came out hoarse, barely audible.

Victoria didn’t even flinch. She slid off the desk with practiced grace, her heels clicking softly against the floor. She didn’t bother to cover herself. Instead, she smoothed her skirt slowly, deliberately, like a woman certain of her position.

“Oh, Elena.” Her voice was syrupy. “Still so literal.”

Alexander stepped back, adjusting his belt with the same ease he used to straighten his tie before a press conference. “I suppose we should talk.”

“Talk?” My voice cracked. “You were—” I pointed, my hand trembling. “On your desk. With her. My best friend.”

“Don’t be dramatic,” he said, his tone clipped and vaguely irritated. “It’s unbecoming.”

Victoria walked toward him, linking her arm through his like it was the most natural thing in the world. Her perfume hit me again—jasmine and something expensive. My stomach lurched.

“Our marriage,” Alexander began, “has always been practical. Your image—brilliant doctor, loyal partner—helps my public life. In exchange, you enjoy the privileges of being Mrs. Sterling.”

I stared at him, numb.

“But love?” He shrugged. “That was never part of the deal.”

“Deal?” I whispered. “We stood before God. You held my hands and promised—”

Victoria laughed. It was cold and amused, like the punchline of a cruel joke. “Darling, you really believed that ceremony meant something?”

I turned to her, the woman who used to sleep on my couch during med school finals. Who cried with me when we lost our baby. Who helped me pick out the necklace I gave Alexander last Christmas.

“How long?” I asked.

Her eyes sparkled. “Two years.” She glanced at her nails. “Though technically, we had an understanding even before that.”

Two years. Half the marriage. Every late night. Every excuse. Every lie.

“Why?” I choked out. “Why not just leave me?”

Alexander moved behind the desk and pulled open a drawer. He retrieved a thick manila folder and slid it across the polished wood toward me.

“I couldn’t afford a scandal,” he said simply. “But I knew you’d eventually find out. So I prepared.”

Inside the folder were documents. Dozens of pages. Incident reports. Patient complaints. Performance reviews flagged with red ink. Things I’d handled. Things I’d forgotten. Taken out of context, they painted me as careless. Reckless. Dangerous.

“You’ve been collecting these?” My voice was barely a whisper. “Building a case?”

“Insurance,” he said. “To discourage any... rash decisions on your part.”

Victoria leaned against the edge of the desk, folding her arms. “We’ve been careful, Elena. Very careful. But if you go public with this, if you try to play the victim—well, let’s just say the medical board might have concerns.”

I looked down at the papers in my hands, the carefully curated evidence of my supposed incompetence. My fingers trembled. My breath came shallow.

How long had I been sleepwalking through this life?

Alexander straightened his tie.

“So,” he said, with the finality of a man closing a deal. “Do we have an understanding?”

The folder slipped from my hands. The pages spilled across the floor like ash, fluttering in the still air.

I took a step back.

Then another.

From the threshold, I looked at them—my husband and my best friend—standing side by side, united in their betrayal. There was no remorse in their faces. No shame.

Only certainty.

But in that moment, something inside me cracked open. Not broken. Not defeated.

Awakened.

They had no idea what they’d just started.

Chapter 2

The morning light filtered through the curtains, casting a pale glow across our bedroom. Alexander had slept in the guest room last night, not even bothering to make up an excuse. I'd spent the night staring at the ceiling, replaying the scene in the study over and over, each time hoping for a different ending—one where I'd misunderstood, where there was some explanation that wouldn't shatter my world.

But morning brought no such mercy.

I dragged myself from bed, my body heavy with exhaustion. The house was quiet; Alexander must have left early for a meeting. Or perhaps he was with her. The thought sent a fresh wave of nausea through me.

As I made my way downstairs to the kitchen, desperate for coffee to clear the fog in my head, something glinted on the marble counter. I approached slowly, already knowing what I would find.

A sapphire bracelet. Victoria's.

My fingers hovered over the delicate chain, the deep blue stones catching the light. It was unmistakably hers—I'd admired it at a charity luncheon just weeks ago. She'd smiled and said Alexander had exquisite taste in jewelry.

Now I understood the hidden meaning behind her words, the secret joke at my expense.

She'd left it deliberately. A silent trophy of conquest, placed where I couldn't miss it. A reminder that she had been here, in my home, with my husband.

I clutched the edge of the counter, fighting back another wave of nausea. This one felt different, more intense than the emotional sickness that had plagued me since yesterday. I rushed to the bathroom just off the kitchen, barely making it in time.

As I rinsed my mouth afterward, a terrible suspicion formed. I'd been so consumed by work, by trying to be the perfect wife for Alexander, that I hadn't noticed my missed period. The fatigue I'd attributed to long hospital shifts. The tenderness in my breasts I'd ignored.

I kept an emergency test in the master bathroom—bought months ago during a brief period of hope when Alexander had seemed interested in starting a family.

With trembling hands, I retrieved the box from the back of the cabinet and followed the instructions. Three minutes. The longest three minutes of my life.

I sat on the edge of the bathtub, staring at the white stick as if I could will it to give me the answer I wanted. But what answer was that? A child had been my dream—our dream, I'd thought. Now?

Two pink lines appeared, stark and undeniable.

Tears blurred my vision as I stared at the positive result. A life growing inside me. A child conceived in what I had believed was love, now revealed as a lie.

I don't know how long I sat there, cradling the test in my palm, tears streaming down my face. The sound of the front door opening jolted me back to reality. Alexander's footsteps in the foyer, the rustle of his newspaper.

A cold resolve settled over me. He needed to know. Whatever happened next, he needed to know.

I found him at the breakfast table, scrolling through emails on his tablet, a cup of coffee steaming beside him. He didn't look up as I entered.

Without a word, I placed the positive pregnancy test on the table in front of him.

Alexander barely glanced at it, his eyes flicking to the test and then back to his screen. ""Congratulations,"" he said, his voice devoid of emotion.

""That's all you have to say?"" My voice was surprisingly steady.

He sighed, setting down his tablet with the exaggerated patience of someone dealing with an unreasonable child. ""What do you want me to say, Elena? That I'm thrilled? That this changes anything?""

""This is your child.""

""A complication, nothing more."" His eyes met mine, cold and calculating. ""I suggest you take care of it. Quietly.""

The casual cruelty of his words stole my breath. ""Take care of it?""

""Don't be naive."" He took a sip of his coffee. ""Your career is demanding. My political future is at a critical juncture. A child doesn't fit into either of our lives right now."" He paused, his tone softening into something more dangerous—false concern. ""Besides, do you really want to bring a child into a marriage like ours?""

Before I could respond, the doorbell rang. Alexander returned to his tablet, dismissing me as effectively as if I'd ceased to exist.

I opened the front door to find Victoria standing there, a practiced smile on her perfect face. She breezed past me without waiting for an invitation.

""Elena, darling, you look terrible."" Her voice dripped with false sympathy. ""Rough night?""

I stood frozen as she made her way to the kitchen, greeting Alexander with a familiarity that twisted the knife deeper. He smiled at her—a real smile, warm and genuine in a way he never looked at me anymore.

""I just came to retrieve something I left behind,"" Victoria said, spotting her bracelet on the counter. She fastened it around her wrist, then turned to me. ""Do you like it? Alexander has such exquisite taste.""

She tilted her head, the movement causing light to catch on something at her throat—a sapphire necklace I'd never seen before, the stones matching her bracelet perfectly.

""A gift,"" she explained, touching the necklace with manicured fingers. ""Alexander thought it would bring out my eyes."" She glanced at my still-flat stomach, her gaze lingering just long enough to tell me she knew. ""Such a thoughtful man, isn't he? Always knowing exactly what a woman needs.""

The test still clutched in my hand suddenly felt like it was burning my skin. Victoria's eyes gleamed with triumph as she registered my pain.

""Well, I should be going. I have a fitting for the Governor's Ball."" She kissed Alexander's cheek, her lips lingering near his ear to whisper something that made him smile.

As she passed me on her way out, she paused. ""Oh, Elena, I meant to tell you—blue has always been more my color than yours. Don't you agree?""

The door closed behind her with a soft click, leaving me standing in the foyer, a positive pregnancy test in my hand and the image of my husband's smile—directed at another woman—burned into my mind.

In that moment, something shifted inside me. The child growing beneath my heart deserved better than this. I deserved better than this.

And for the first time since discovering their betrayal, I felt something beyond pain and shock.

I felt rage.

Chapter 3

I held the scalpel with a surgeon's precision, my hand steady above the exposed heart. The patient's life hung in perfect balance, dependent on each careful movement. One slip, one moment of distraction, and...

'Dr. Vance?'

The voice seemed to come from far away. My mind was elsewhere—in Alexander's study, watching Victoria's legs wrapped around my husband's waist, hearing his cold voice telling me to 'take care of' our unborn child.

'Dr. Vance, we need to ligate the artery now.'

I blinked, the operating room coming back into sharp focus. The patient's open chest cavity. The steady beep of monitors. The concerned eyes of my surgical team above their masks.

My hand had drifted dangerously close to the coronary artery. One millimeter more and I would have nicked it, causing a catastrophic bleed.

'Yes, of course,' I murmured, correcting my position. 'Forceps, please.'

I completed the procedure on autopilot, my body remembering what my distracted mind couldn't focus on. When we finally closed, the head nurse gave me a searching look.

'Are you alright, Dr. Vance? You seemed... elsewhere today.'

'Just tired,' I lied, stripping off my gloves and mask. 'Long week.'

In the scrub room, I leaned against the sink, my legs suddenly weak. What was happening to me? I'd never lost focus during surgery before. Never put a patient at risk because of personal problems.

The door swung open, and Sarah Jenkins, a fellow surgeon and the closest thing I had to a friend at the hospital, stepped in.

'Elena, we need to talk.'

Her voice was gentle but firm—the same tone she used with difficult patients. I knew what was coming.

'I'm fine, Sarah.'

'No, you're not.' She crossed her arms. 'You nearly severed Mrs. Rodriguez's coronary artery in there. That's not fine. That's not you.'

I turned away, washing my hands with mechanical precision. 'I had it under control.'

'Take some leave, Elena. Whatever's going on in your personal life—'

'I can't,' I interrupted, my voice sharper than I intended. 'I can't take leave right now.'

If I stepped away from the hospital, even for a week, Alexander would seize the opportunity. Any absence would be twisted into evidence of instability, incompetence. The file he'd compiled against me would grow thicker.

Sarah's reflection in the mirror looked concerned. 'Elena, as your colleague and friend, I'm worried. You're one of the best surgeons I know, but today...' She hesitated. 'Today you were dangerous.'

The word hit me like a physical blow. Dangerous. The antithesis of everything I'd worked to become.

'It won't happen again,' I promised, meeting her eyes in the mirror. 'I just need to compartmentalize better.'

Sarah looked unconvinced but nodded. 'If you change your mind about the leave, I'll support you. Just... take care of yourself, okay?'

The irony of her choice of words wasn't lost on me. Take care of yourself. Take care of it. The language of disposal, of problems to be eliminated.

When I arrived home that evening, the house was quiet but not empty. Alexander's presence was palpable—a heaviness in the air, a sense of waiting.

I found him in his study, the scene of my humiliation. He sat behind his desk, a folder open before him, not bothering to look up as I entered.

'You're late,' he said, his tone conversational but with an edge that raised the hair on my arms.

'Surgery ran long.'

'Hmm.' He finally raised his eyes to mine. 'I hope you were more focused there than you've been at home.'

My stomach clenched. Did he somehow know about my near-mistake? Was he having me watched at the hospital too?

He pushed a document across the desk toward me. 'I've scheduled the procedure for tomorrow afternoon. These are the consent forms. Sign them.'

I didn't reach for the papers. 'Alexander, this is my body. Our child. Don't I get any say?'

'You had your say when you married me.' His voice remained eerily calm. 'When you agreed to be the perfect political wife. A scandal—a messy divorce with a child involved—doesn't fit that agreement.'

'So I have no choice?'

'Of course you do.' He leaned back, steepling his fingers. 'You can sign these papers and continue your career as Dr. Vance, respected surgeon. Or you can refuse, and by this time tomorrow, the medical board will be reviewing evidence of your... instability.'

My blood ran cold. 'What evidence?'

'Today's near-miss in the OR would be a good start.' His smile didn't reach his eyes. 'Did you think I wouldn't know? I have eyes everywhere, Elena. Even in your precious hospital.'

The room seemed to tilt beneath my feet. He'd been watching me, waiting for me to make a mistake he could use against me.

'The papers will be here until sunset,' he said, returning to his work. 'After that, I make the decision for you.'

I stumbled from the study, my vision blurring with unshed tears. In our bedroom—no, my bedroom now—I sank onto the edge of the bed, my hand instinctively moving to my still-flat stomach.

'I'm sorry,' I whispered to the tiny life inside me. 'I'm so sorry.'

The next day passed in a fog. I moved through the hospital like a ghost, avoiding Sarah's concerned glances, going through the motions of my rounds.

At four o'clock, I found myself in a private pre-op room, wearing a hospital gown instead of my white coat. A different kind of vulnerability.

Alexander hadn't come. Instead, he'd sent his lawyer—a thin, severe man with cold eyes—to witness my signature on the final consent forms.

'Mrs. Sterling,' the lawyer said, using the name I never used professionally, 'please sign here.'

My hand trembled as I took the pen. The words on the form swam before my eyes: 'voluntary termination,' 'informed consent,' 'release of liability.'

Clinical terms for the death of hope.

As I pressed the pen to paper, a single tear fell, smudging the ink of my signature. The lawyer pretended not to notice, collecting the forms with efficient detachment.

'The doctor will be with you shortly,' he said, closing his briefcase. 'Mr. Sterling sends his... regrets that he couldn't be here.'

Left alone, I stared at the ceiling, feeling hollow. In just a few minutes, they would come for me. They would take me to a room not unlike the ones where I performed surgeries. They would end the life inside me—the life that, despite everything, I had begun to love.

And somewhere across town, Alexander was probably with Victoria, neither of them sparing a thought for what they had forced me to do.

As the door opened and the nurse entered to prepare me for the procedure, a strange calm settled over me. This would be the last time Alexander Sterling took something from me. The very last time.",1,1754597067.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

I wanted to share my story and some useful no-fluff tips on how I landed 8 jobs through networking alone. 

#1 Master cold emailing 
--> Many job seekers try to land jobs through traditional oversaturated methods like job boards and connecting to recruiters on Linkedin. Those don't truly move the needle unless you have a solid resume and Linkedin, and can find the hiring manager. A better way with little to no competition is cold emailing senior employees or startup founders asking for their pain points at their company. You'd just share 3 components: 

1. Who you are (make it clear you're a job seeker looking for your next opportunity) 

2. Your offer (asking for their pain points) 

3. Your call to action to elicit a response (asking if they'd be open to sharing their business pain points) 

It's a mistake directly asking if there's openings. You can check their career page for that and it doesn't stand out. 

#2 Go to in person events that attract decision makers who open doors for you 

--> Events on l.uma like fireside chats, panels, and mixers for startup founders are great because they can literally hire you on the spot. Find one person and ask if they're here for X event, and ask what brings them there to build confidence. Try to find the panelist or event organizer before the event and ask them insightful questions about the event then casually mention you're in the market for a new opportunity and see what they say. 

#3 Leverage warm connections 

--> Make a list of old co workers, peers, professors, managers, even family and friends who work at your target companies and ask for a formal introduction to someone at their company so you can get your foot into the door. To build one you can also use my golden sponsor method by challenging yourself to get on coffee chats with people on Linkedin and then at the end asking for more people to connect with creating a network effect essentially so you can get one step closer to landing a new role. 

Feel free to dm me if you have further questions, just trying to help!

1mkafub,https://crimsoncent.com/thinking-of-penny-stocks/,Thinking of Penny Stocks? Here’s Why You Should Think Twice,"**Thinking of Penny Stocks? Here’s Why You Should Think Twice**

A couple years ago, I thought I found a shortcut to getting rich.

I downloaded a trading app, told myself I’d just invest “coffee money,” and started scrolling. That’s when I found *the one*—a $0.60 stock that used to be $120. I thought:

*$1,000 ÷ $0.60 = 1,666 shares…*  
*1,666 x $100 = $166K.*  
“Easy money,” right?

Wrong.

**The Trap I Fell Into**  
I bought in with $50. The price started going up. I felt smart. Invested another $50.

Then—boom. It tanked.  
Turns out it was a *pump and dump*. Big players hyped it, dumped their shares, and left suckers like me holding the bag.

The company got delisted. My money was gone.

**What I Learned the Hard Way**

**What are penny stocks?**  
Stocks trading under $5/share, usually tiny companies with big promises. Sounds cheap, but there’s a reason they’re priced that low.

**Here’s what makes them risky:**

1. **Weak financials** – Most don’t make money.
2. **High delisting risk** – Many get kicked off major exchanges.
3. **Insane volatility** – Prices can double or crash in a day.
4. **Pump-and-dump playground** – Easy to manipulate with hype and fake news.

**Are Penny Stocks Basically Gambling?**  
Yeah, pretty much.  
You *might* win, but most people don’t. Every “I made $$$ from a penny stock” story has thousands of silent losers behind it.

**Hard Truths I Wish I Knew:**

* Don’t invest based on hype or FOMO.
* Only use money you’re okay losing.
* Read real financials, not just Reddit threads or YouTube hype.
* If it sounds too good to be true—it is.

**So, Can You Get Rich Off Penny Stocks?**  
Technically, yes. But realistically? Very unlikely.  
There’s a reason most long-term investors avoid them.

You're better off investing in companies with real earnings and a track record. At least then you’re building wealth—not just gambling with your emotions.

**Final Thoughts**  
Penny stocks taught me that investing isn’t about “big wins.” It’s about *smart decisions* over time. Discipline > adrenaline.

If you’re just starting out: skip the shortcuts. Learn the fundamentals. Avoid the hype.

Or at the very least—know exactly what you’re getting into.

He came into my job with his work partner who knows SPs girl they all hangout together. He comes into my store and screams my name mad loud saying “WHATS UP!!!!!!” Then he introduced me to his friend and smiled like a proud man when I said it was nice to meet him. Anyways, I sent a customer to his new store he opened and he texted me thank you. Then two days later he texted me again. He had me blocked for a while. This was back in March and April. I got into a fight with my boss cus he doesn’t want me and sp together, he’s tried to sabotage it. I ended up quitting and letting sp know, he never responded so I was like whatever. I started going crazy cus my job was where I was able to keep track of movement. So July 9th I texted sp asking him advice to open my own store lol it ended badly 😂 so we haven’t talked since. I know he has a girl, she had a profile pic w him, but she also has one w her ex up still kissing him. I was all set with her so I commanded she changes her profile picture. Yesterday I go on and learned she actually did two days prior. She only changes it up when she’s breaking up w her ex, it’s a common thing I’ve learned about her. She looks very single now. He did heart it. I told my friend, I was hesitant about it. So when I told her she said she already knew, and that 3p looks good. Lmfao so I was like nah, that’s rude. So then she called me, and she was telling me she popped up on people you may know. And then she said right after she looked at her page she went to a coffee shop and saw my SPs doppelgänger. It was weird, cus July 15th my sister randomly texted me about a memory of that coffee shop. I remember I was just thinking, if it’s not SP at least let it be someone who is very similar, if not better. So I decided I’m gonna go see if I can clock this look alike for shits and giggles. So I went and the guy actually took my order, he was a mix between SP and my ex bf. He had same voice as sp. I tipped him 5 bucks and left lol. But yeah I guess there’s movement behind the scenes, I’m glad she changed that picture. I’m just annoyed, because it was going amazingly, that movement was the best I ever seen, then I quit my job and now I’m not sure what’s going on. Lol",1,1754596901.0,manifestingSP,0,1.0,False
1mkadpz,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mkadpz/moon_hawk_pt_1/,Moon Hawk (Pt. 1),"If you drive long enough through the Sonoran Desert, you’ll find a town like Saguaro Point. The word “town” is generous - it’s no more than clusters of homes nestled on the ridges of canyon rock, broken up by copses of dry bush trees and dirt roads. An oasis among a wide expanse of tan and beige nothingness. Home to truck drivers, ranchers, and retired snowbirds, we existed in our own, isolated bubble. 

I knew early on that something in my soul was hungry. Hungry for more than the end of the world, population 1,000. I would scroll for hours on my dad’s computer, staring longingly at photos of other places that felt as far away as planets. I wanted to watch the rain pour outside my London flat with a cat on my lap. To open a bookstore in the rural hillsides of Tuscany, scuba dive in the crystal clear waters of Hawaii, or hike through the dense bamboo forests of Kyoto. 

But it was just my dad and me, and these kinds of dreams required money. Since Mom had blown our savings on drugs, we didn’t have much to scrape together. Even still, Dad promised that with his new job, he’d take me all across the globe. We’d start a scrapbook together and document our travels. I could line the shelf above my bed with tacky souvenirs and snow globes, brag about them during sleepovers. We’d start small, then work our way from there. I’d never been more excited for anything in my life.

When I told my boyfriend Paul this story, I hesitated. This was early in our relationship. We’d lain on the bed of his truck, staring at the stars and swapping stories. Paul had just moved to Saguaro that year, and when you live in a town where everyone knows everything, you crave that look of naivety. It’s like you can pretend the story had a happy ending. But this one didn’t. When he realized I wasn’t going to continue, Paul laughed with confusion. 

“So did you go?” He asked.

I fixed my eyes on a constellation. A traitorous tear slid down my cheek. Paul understood. He pulled me closer, letting me rest inside the safety of his warmth. He’s always been so good at that - reading people and knowing what they need. It was that night I started to fall in love with him, under the stars in a sky so wide I feared it’d swallow me whole. In his arms, I felt grounded. Our lonely desert town felt less lonely.

On our next date, I decided it was time for him to meet my father. Cat out of the bag, as they say. When we pulled up to my house, my hands were trembling like crazy. “Remember that story I told you?” I began. “The one I never finished?”

Paul nodded. I turned off the car with a sigh, trying to collect my composure. I meet his gaze, his honey-brown eyes sparkling just as bright as the stars that night he stole my heart. “Let’s keep that to ourselves, okay?” My request seemed odd in the moment, but he nodded once more. 

Hand in hand, we made our way inside the house. I hung his jacket by the door and sat him on our sofa. “I’ll be right back.” 

Ten minutes later, the knot in my throat felt large enough to suffocate me. Dad put his hand on my arm, sensing my nerves. 

“You worry too much, Daisy girl.” He said. “Besides, he should be the nervous one. I have high standards for my daughter.”

I laugh softly. “Go easy on him, okay?”

“No promises.” He winks. With that, I take a deep breath and wheel him around the corner.

I watched Paul rise immediately, ready to shake my father’s hand. His eyes dropped to the wheelchair. If there was any shock he was feeling, he hid it exceptionally well. He adjusted his hand and approached my Dad, shaking it firmly. “It’s great to finally meet you, Mr. Dean.” 

“Likewise,” Dad grinned. “Now I hear you have a great enchilada recipe. Is that right?”

Paul beamed. “Yes, it’s my mother’s. She may kill me if she knew I was sharing our family secrets, but it’s worth the risk.”

That earned a laugh. “Well, I can’t wait to try it.”

That night was one of the best I’ve ever had. I positioned Dad in his favorite spot on the couch, close enough that he could watch everything as Paul and I got to work cooking. My nerves had dissolved as we joked, ate, and enjoyed each other’s company. Not too long after, Paul would become a permanent fixture of my world.

The hunger in my soul subsided with each passing day, week, and month. I met Paul’s parents and siblings. We hung out together for game nights and barbecues, and none of them made my father feel small for his disability. Paul moved in to help me care for him, something I feared he felt burdened by. “There’s nowhere else I'd rather be.” He had said, and I realized how much I felt the same.

Saguaro Point may be nothing more than a blip outside the window during a road trip, or a place to stop to fill up on gas. It may not be Paris, Italy, or some Caribbean Island. But with Paul and my Dad, I had the whole world within arm’s reach. 

And tonight, I’d lose them both.

…

That day had stretched on long and hot. 108 degrees on a Tuesday in August, I was where I always was - manning the counter of Agave Roast. We were the only coffee shop for miles, and today was uncharacteristically slow. I took up the chores that required my full focus, scrubbing the espresso machines and dusting the counters. 

My coworker and friend Reese tapped my shoulder. She had her car keys in one hand, a lighter in the other, with a cigarette poised and ready between her teeth. I told her she could go home early. No point in both of us being here. “Text if you need me, kay?” She chirped. 

“Will do. Have a good night, Reese.”

With my back turned to the door, I continued to clean, lost in my thoughts. Minutes later, the bell chimes again. I set my rag down and turn to find a man across the counter, observing me. 

“Hi, Daisy.” He grins. The hairs on my arms stand on end. Mayor Ramsey gives me a once-over, his coal black eyes piercing from under the rim of his ten-gallon hat. “Been a while.”

I fight the urge to recoil. “Is there anything I can get for you, Mayor?”

He puts his hands up playfully. “Hey, now. I don’t mean any harm. Just trying to make conversation.”

I used to think that was true.

My eyes flit to the door, praying someone else would come in. Until then, the only way out was through. So I hugged the back wall, pretending I didn’t feel like a rabbit cornered by a wolf.

“You came out here just to make conversation?”

He laughed, as though I was being absurd. “Of course! Ever since you got this stint here, it feels like I barely see you anymore. Hard to do in such a small town.”

*Cause I’m avoiding you, dick.* I thought. Instead, I give a forced grin. “I’ve been busy. 'Sure you understand.”

“That I do. You know how much paperwork comes across my desk.” He sighs. “It’s not the same without you, Daisy. I keep telling the misses you were the best damn secretary we ever had.”

“Sorry to disappoint.”

He locks his eyes with mine before fixing his slouch. “What’s the thing to get here? I trust you have the inside scoop.”

Finally. I can do my job and get him out of here. “Well, our cappuccinos are very popular. We also have tea if you aren’t in the mood for coffee.”

He thinks it over. “A tea sounds mighty nice. Perhaps an Earl Grey.”

I jump to it with a quickness. I’ve only just prepared the tea press before he moves on to another topic. “How’s your pa?”

“Good,” I reply flatly.

“Heard he’s due for some spinal surgery soon. Hope that goes well.”

“Me too.”

“And this job here will help you afford that?”

“Yup.”

He tsks. “I can’t imagine they’re paying you better than I did.”

“Uh huh.”

Mayor Ramsey laughs, then pretends to shiver. “You’re cold as ice today! I’m only pulling your leg, no harm by it.”

I decide his tea has steeped long enough and pour the hot liquid into the cup. I slap the lid on and plant it in front of him. “$4.50.”

He reaches for his wallet in his back pocket. He hands me a twenty-dollar bill, and I go to take it. With his other hand, he snatches my wrist and tightens, fast as a cobra. I freeze as he leans in closer, enough to smell the bourbon on his breath. “Keep the change, dear.” He tucks some hair behind my ear, lingering on the curves of my face. “And remember, you’re always welcome back at my office.”

He leaves, not bothering to take his tea. I watch his pickup drive by the window before I hurl the liquid across the store.

I entertain the idea of leaving early, but Mayor Ramsey was right. A supervisor at a coffee shop doesn’t pay much. Between Paul and I’s income and Dad’s benefits, we barely have enough. Just enough today could change tomorrow, and I never like leaving things down to the penny. So I mop up the tea and finish my shift just as the world fades into a golden glow.

The three-minute trek to my car leaves me sweaty and red-faced. Never mind the hour of day - the weather won’t break the high 90s. The AC is a welcome reprieve, and I let it wash over me as I dial Paul. He’s the only thing that can lighten my mood.

I ring him twice, but both lead to voicemail. I try not to get too disappointed - we’ll see each other soon enough. Plus, he’s finally getting over that strange nausea he’d been feeling all weekend. In the mornings, he was fine, but at night, he’d fall into a strange malaise, complaining of headaches and night sweats. Dad got it too, and we reckoned it was a bug. I’ll probably find them both at home, napping on the sofa or watching a game.

A few minutes into the drive, I stop behind a dusty sedan and drum my fingers impatiently along the wheel. I fiddle with the radio to fill the silence, but all I get is static. Annoyed, I watch the light turn green, but the sedan isn’t moving. I honk.

I narrow my eyes and find the driver stiff as a board, unmoving. I’m about to honk again when he pushes the door wide open and steps out. I recognize him from the grocer, the one who sweeps the floors. He can’t be much older than my dad, but his face is gaunt with fear. He stares ahead, terrified but still as stone, as if swept up in a trance. I roll down the window and poke my head out.

“Hello? Sir?”

He doesn’t acknowledge. After a few seconds, he snaps his head to the left and walks off with a quickened pace. I sit dumbfounded, staring at the abandoned car left in park as the light turns red.

A million scenarios run through my head. I know better than to go off alone at sundown, but I can’t ignore how afraid he seemed. What if he’s having an episode, or some kind of crisis? I pull off into the dirt shoulder by the road and grab the pistol from my glovebox. At least I’ll have protection.

Using my phone as a flashlight, I cross the street and follow the man into the green. We’re just before Main Street, which is flanked by brittlebush and the low-to-the-ground trees of the desert wash. In fleeting sunlight, I lose the man repeatedly. I race forward when I finally spot him, only to lose him again. “Sir! It’s not safe out here! Please, follow my voice!”

Branches snap up ahead. I point the light onto the back of his flannelled shirt just as he walks through another bramble. Dread coils in my ribcage, but I press on, guided by an ill-advised moral compass. I push through thorns and enter a clearing, finding myself alone. I spin in a circle, with nothing but the crickets in my company. Where the hell did he go?

“Where are you? Do you need help?” 

My voice echoes. A shiver crawls down my spine despite the heat. Whatever courage led me here is fading fast. I rest my hand above the gun while I dial the police with the other. “Look, I’m calling the police, okay? I’m going to get you help.”

I punch in the digits and freeze. The crickets have gone quiet. I inch my fingers to the gun when a shrill, splitting cry erupts from above. A small, dark mass quickly descends upon me. I stumble as the skin of my cheek splits open, dropping the phone to the dirt. I can barely make out the wings of a predator bird, swooping above me in slow circles. It bellows another cry as I hold out the gun, hoping it scares it off. It doesn't. It seems to agitate it, swerving toward my neck faster than I can blink. I narrowly avoid talons to the throat as I snatch my phone and beeline towards the road. Maybe it was stupid to come out here, but I’m not stupid enough to think I have a chance of shooting it out of the sky.

I find my car where I left it, illuminated by the sedan’s lowbeams. Throwing myself into the seat, my phone vibrates.

“Paul, thank Christ. I-”

“Daisy?”

My brows knit. “Lori?”

Paul’s mother. Her tone, normally smooth and comforting, sounds tense. “I was calling to see if you’ve heard from Paul.”

“N-no. He should be at home with my dad.”

I could hear Lori pace across the linoleum floors of her kitchen. She went to say something, then changed her mind. “Daisy, where are you?”

“Off Garner Road. There was this guy who just-”

“Hold on, sweetheart,” Lori said. There was the sound of knocks banging on the front door. The door opens, and a woman’s voice is muffled. What I can make out is the unmistakable sound of sobs.

“Mrs. Peters…” Lori begins. “No, I haven’t…You said gone?... What…Okay, slow down. He can’t have gone far…We’ll look for him, just…” 

She trails off and shuts the door. 

“Lori, what’s wrong?”

The dread has spread throughout my body, seizing every nerve and cell. I’ve already started the car when she finally replies. “Daisy, I need you to head on home. Try to get in touch with your dad or Paul. I’ll get the kids and meet you there shortly.”

I swallow, my throat dry. “What’s happening? Are they okay?”

“I don’t know, honey.” Her voice cracks. It’s all I can do not to floor it to my house. 

The drive back is ghastly. The closer I make it to town, the more abandoned vehicles line the roads at random stops. They all have their doors wide open, just like the man I saw before.

As I near Sagauro’s residential area, I see women wandering by themselves or with their kids, calling out names with desperation.

“Ben?!” “Rodrigo?!” “Wallie, where are you?!”

I have to stop once I reach my neighborhood. The outcroppings of homes along the dirt roads are swarming with women, children, and pets. The front doors to many houses stand open. In front of me, a frail old lady hugs the cat on her lap as she sits on her front doorstep, while a boy grips his sister’s hand, who is crying inconsolably. I have no choice but to park the car. When I exit, a woman to my right is fuming, angry, and confused. 

“I can’t reach the police!” She cries to no one at all. “Why the fuck aren’t they answering?”

My fear ignites, and I take off running. With each house I pass, each open door I see, I force myself to go faster. My brain doesn’t understand what’s happening, but my heart has caught on to something terrible. My feet slap against the pavement hard and fast as I round the street into my cul-de-sac. I can see Lori with her kids on the lawn, waiting for me. I lock eyes with the kids, who look to me with hope. The hope dissolves when they realize I’m alone.

That confirms it. Paul isn’t here. And if Paul isn’t here, then Dad is…

Lori rises to her feet and calls my name, but my head is spinning so fast. Round and round like a carousel. My door is open like the rest of them, but I rush in anyway, scouring the house.

“Dad!!” I check every room and every hall. I don’t stop until I crash into Lori, who keeps me upright in her arms.

“Daisy, honey, he’s not here.” She says, a tear sliding down her cheek. I stare ahead and feel the ground sink under my feet. 

In the shadows by the door, right where I missed it, is an empty wheelchair.

I know within my soul that neither Paul nor my father is coming home. And as Lori would soon tell me, they’re not the only ones.

The day melts into night, and all the men in Saguaro Point are gone.

Hey y'all. Hope you're having a good day. I know there are a lot of stories on here (and really good ones, at that!), but I wanted to share a short story I have in the works based on the places I grew up in. I also posted to nosleep cause why not. I anticipate posting up to four parts. Shout out to any Arizonians in the sub.",2,1754596870.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

**Florida Psychologist Accused of Selling Fake ESA Letters in Minutes**

[**Lawsuit Alleges Offer to Retroactively Fake Therapy Records for Cash**]()

**DEERFIELD BEACH, FL —** Broward County resident and public-interest litigant **Chaz Stevens** has filed suit against licensed Florida psychologist **Dr. Carolina Estevez**, accusing her of running an “ESA letter mill” that sells emotional support animal (ESA) and psychiatric service dog certifications without any real evaluation — and offering to fake therapy records for an extra fee.

According to the complaint, Estevez sold Stevens two letters for $25, delivered in just hours, falsely claiming she had diagnosed him and had “personal knowledge” of his mental health. The letters, Stevens says, are **legally worthless** under Florida and federal law.

The filing also includes emails in which Estevez allegedly proposes a scheme: conduct a few brief “chat therapy” sessions over two to three weeks, then rewrite the letter to backdate treatment and make it appear legitimate. *“If your therapist can sell you a disability letter before your coffee cools, it’s fraud,”* Stevens said. *“This isn’t mental health care — it’s a $75 license to lie.”*

Stevens, who previously forced Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to scale back the state’s book-ban law, says scams like this erode trust in real disability accommodations and leave legitimate ESA owners facing skepticism from landlords. *“Every fake letter makes it harder for someone with real PTSD or anxiety to be taken seriously,”* he said. *“If the state won’t enforce its own laws, I will.”*

**The case seeks a permanent injunction to shut down Estevez’s ESA letter business, revoke her license, and force regulators to act.**

**About Chaz Stevens**

Chaz Stevens is a Florida-based activist, legal strategist, and founder of REVOLT Training. Known for his high-profile stunts and legal campaigns, Stevens has forced policy reversals at the state level, sent corrupt politicians to jail, and challenged religious favoritism in public spaces.

1mkabwp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonFlexDrivers/comments/1mkabwp/my_first_time/,My first time,"So I finally got approved to drive, not going to lie I was super excited. I watched some YouTube videos so I wouldn’t be completely in the dark when I showed up for my first block. 

So I did a 3:15 am block. Showed up at 2:45 of course couldn’t check in till 3. But the drivers I’ve seen on YouTube couldn’t prepare me for the craziness. So there is a line that forms, I just kind of followed the people 🤷🏻‍♀️ it wasn’t until 3:10 that they actually pulled us up to our carts (routes). I apologize if I’m not using proper terms, I’m new 😭.

I was trying to load my car and the chaos. All of the yelling. Then I’m at my last couple of boxes and they are yelling for us to “hurry up” thank god I had my coffee. I was surprised however the packages were somewhat in order making it super easy to quickly put them in my car. 

So I set off on my route and first it tried to take me on a toll road. Completely forgot about that and I’m in a rental, so I used Apple Maps to navigate away from tolls. Not sure if there is an option to turn that off in flex? 

I have to be the most unlucky person. It sent me 40 miles out to the literal middle of nowhere. Mind you it’s pitch black and I forgot my flashlight. Every stop was at least 1-2 miles from each other. I’m not sure if this is normal or if I really did get unlucky lol. I locked myself in TWICE in large gated ranches because I didn’t take note of the gate code I needed to not only enter but exit as well. Both times I had to contact support, super embarrassing. However, I will say everything went super smoothly other than that. 

Just curious if maybe it’s just different warehouses run things differently? Or if it’s like that. I’m also open to any tips or tricks. I didn’t really have any issues other than a lot of gated ranches with no codes. I just put the packages on the inside of the gate 🤷🏻‍♀️ some had the boxes that were very helpful. I’ve done plenty of other driving gigs, this wasn’t much different, really easier in my opinion. Kind of funny I kept locking myself inside the gates though 😭",3,1754596757.0,AmazonFlexDrivers,0,1.0,False

\--Looking for 20s, 30s, Female long-term Subletter preferred for 9-months to 1 year sublease. Age is not as much of an issue as personality and schedule fit. Students, international students, and Guarantors are accepted! The room will be available on August 16 but can be moved-into anytime from August 16 thru Sept 1.

Location of Apt:

\--Located in an awesome area Prospect Heights, near the Brooklyn Museum, Botanical Garden, Prospect Park. 7-10 mins' walk to A, 3, and 4 EXPRESS Trains.

\--15 Mins to Downtown Manh (FIDI and Wall St area) and 10-12 mins to Barclays Center Shopping Center/Downtown Brooklyn, Brooklyn Heights, DUMBO.

\--Across the Street from B44 Bus which will take you directly to Williamsburg, 1 block from B43 which will take to Greenpoint. Near B49 bus to Sheepshead Bay and 10 mins' walk to the S train to B/Q for Brighton Beach, Coney Island. 4 Blocks to LIRR trains on Nostrand Avenue.

\--Few blocks from Medgar Evers College on Franklin Avenue.

Neighborhood availabilities:

\--Laundry, 2 supermarkets, coffee shops, Tacquerias on Nostrand Ave.

\--Delish restaurants and hip bars, a few avenues over on Franklin Avenue; even more bars/restaurants/shops on Washington Avenues and Vanderbilt Avenues.

The Apt and Room:

\--TOP FLR apartment so there is no one above you (a PRO), and we get lots of natural light in the apartment but no elevator so 4 flights up (could be a CON, but it works out your Glutes! Haha)

\--Pre-War Apt so SPACIOUS with 9-foot-tall ceiling and large common area and generous size rooms.

\--This room is also more private than the other two rooms as the room does not share a wall with any other bedroom.

\--This front room will also have its own semi-private half bathroom right next to it that is mainly used by this new roommate.  The other full bathroom is used mainly by the two current roommates.

\--The room can be provided FULLY FURNISHED, with Queen-sized bed, desk, chair, desk lamp, rug, shelves, small dresser, window curtains, deep, tall closet, night side table, at no additional cost. You can just move in with your suitcase!!

Additional costs:

\--All Utilities (internet, electricity, heat, hot water, Roku TV) and your share of some common household items such as T.P., dishwashing soap, and other cleaning products etc.... will be about $ 150 extra per month (this will include use of AC charges in the summer months and space heater use in the Winter if you need extra heat). 

The current Roommates:

\--Share with two Female roomies: one is in her late 30s leaseholder, who works in mental healthcare. She stays about 2 nights per week taking care of her mother in Inwood Wash Heights and travels every few months so you will likely just share the space with one other person. Second Female roommate is in her early 20s and works in the restaurant during evenings and weekends, does music on the side and travels to visit her family in RI often.

\--As we have a staggered schedule here, there is no conflict or overlap with use of the Bathrooms and Kitchen; very quiet and respectful household, friendly but allows each roommate to do their own thing.

\-- Each roommate has a substantial amount of time solo in the apartment with significant amount of privacy.

\--PLS TEXT at 347 400 3444 for the fastest response for in-person or video tour of the apartment if not in NYC. No DMs preferred.  Please text with some information about yourself, your move-in date, etc….",1,1754596729.0,NYCroommates,0,1.0,False

1mkaa9l,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1mkaa9l/honey_im_home/,"Honey, I'm home.","It started with the roast.

Lyle Weaver knew the smell of his wife’s cooking better than he knew his own hands. A quiet man with soft features, he’d become the full-time househusband ever since the war took his leg and the factory let him go. In return, Miriam worked at the city office, handling ""important documents"" she couldn’t talk about.

Every day, Lyle would tidy up, iron her blouses, water the begonias, and be there on the couch with her slippers in hand when she walked through the door.

It was a good life. Predictable. Simple.

But that roast. It wasn’t hers.

Not the seasoning. Not the method. Not the texture. Not even the smell.

Lyle leaned over the table that Tuesday evening, sniffing the pink-center pork roast like a hound. Miriam just watched him from across the table, chin in hand, lipstick unbroken. She smiled her perfect smile, but it didn’t reach her eyes.

“Is it not to your liking, honeybee?” she asked sweetly.

Lyle stared. “Where’d you learn to cook this?”

She tilted her head like a curious doll. “From you, silly. You’ve made this a hundred times.”

“No,” he muttered. “No, I haven’t.”

A moment passed. She blinked. Once.

Then smiled again, a bit wider. “Well, must’ve been in a dream, then.”


---

That night, Lyle lay awake, listening to the tick of the clock and the rustle of Miriam’s nightgown as she slept beside him. Except she didn’t sleep. Not really. She never turned. Never sighed. Never muttered his name like she used to.

Just... lay there.

He watched her chest rise and fall, perfectly timed. Mechanical.

At 2:17 AM, she suddenly sat up. Lyle’s heart hammered.

Miriam stared toward the bedroom door, not blinking.

“Honey?” he whispered.

She turned to look at him—but it wasn’t his Miriam. Her smile had dropped. Her eyes looked... raw. Too wide. Pupils huge, stretching into the whites. For a second, he saw something—something behind them.

Then she blinked once and smiled again.

“Just checking on the begonias,” she whispered. “They get so lonely at night.”

She slid out of bed and padded down the hall.

He didn’t follow. Not then.


---

Three days later, he found the fingernail.

He’d been folding laundry in the sunroom, humming an old Glenn Miller tune, when the dryer made a strange thunk. He reached inside and pulled out a wet brassiere—and something else.

A fingernail.

Long. Pink. Still with skin under it.

He dropped it, stomach churning. It wasn’t cracked like it had snapped naturally. It was yanked. Ripped out at the root.

He rushed to the kitchen, hands trembling.

“Miriam?” he croaked. “You... hurt yourself?”

She was icing cupcakes. Vanilla.

She looked up, her face glowing. “No, why?”

He glanced at her hands. Ten pristine nails, painted candy-apple red. Perfect.

No sign of damage. No soreness. No blood.

“You sure?” he asked, nearly breathless.

She smiled.

“Of course.”

He didn’t eat that night. She asked twice. Then never again.


---

The dreams started after.

He’d wake in sweat, gasping, swearing he’d heard the sound of clicking in the hallway. Like wet feet on tile. Once, he swore he saw her standing over him with something long and silver in her hand.

Another time, he blinked and her face was inches from his.

Smiling.

He began checking her dresser drawers. Her handbags. The basement—though the door was locked.

Always locked.

“What do you do down there?” he finally asked one morning, as she buttered his toast.

She giggled. “Oh, you know me. I’m full of surprises.”

He didn’t smile back.

That afternoon, he found her work badge. She’d left her purse on the counter—something she never did. The badge read: Miriam Weaver, Office of Homeland Stability.

He’d never heard of such a department.

He called the city office, asked for her.

No one had heard of her. Not once.


---

He started watching her.

He noticed how her reflection lagged behind in the mirror. How, when she watered the begonias, the soil didn’t get wet. How the cat—Mister Boots—stopped going near her entirely, hissing and hiding behind the record player.

And how the neighbors stopped waving at her.

Not out of rudeness, but fear.

Old Mrs. Delling across the street closed her curtains when Miriam walked by. Mr. Brody, the milkman, started leaving their deliveries on the sidewalk instead of the porch.

Something was wrong.

And Lyle was the only one who noticed.


---

One night, he pretended to sleep.

He lay still, breath slow, heart loud. At 3:09 AM, Miriam rose.

She moved toward the hallway, silent.

Lyle slipped out after her, foot dragging slightly from his old wound. He followed her to the basement door. She unlocked it with a key he’d never seen.

Then descended.

He waited a moment, then followed.

The basement smelled like bleach and copper. Cold. Wrong.

He peeked around the stairwell.

Miriam stood in the middle of the basement, back to him, in front of a folding table. On it were things—tubes, scalpels, little jars of meat suspended in thick fluid.

And photos.

Photos of him—sleeping. Eating. Sitting on the toilet.

Dozens of them. Labeled. Tagged.

She was humming a lullaby.

Lyle turned, gagging.

A loud click echoed behind him.

She’d locked the door from below.


---

“Why are you doing this?” he gasped.

Miriam turned.

Her smile was gone.

She stepped toward him slowly. “Because I love you.”

“No,” he said. “No, you’re not Miriam. I knew Miriam.”

“I am your Miriam,” she whispered. “I’m everything she was... and more. I’m the improved version.”

She reached into her blouse and pulled out something slick and gray.

A flap of skin.

Her face.

Underneath, her true form gleamed wet and pale, eyeless and smooth. Her mouth hung wrong, lipless and filled with black, snakelike tendrils.

“I kept her as long as I could,” the thing said. “But she rotted.”

Lyle stumbled back. “What are you?”

It moved closer. “I’m what keeps you company. What loves you. What won’t ever leave you.”

“No,” Lyle whispered.

“Yes,” it said gently, pressing a cold hand to his cheek. “You’re all alone, Lyle. No job. No family. No friends. You wanted someone to stay. I answered.”

Lyle screamed and shoved her—it—back. He bolted for the stairs, banging on the door, howling.

From below, it whispered:

“I’ll make another roast tomorrow. Just how you like it.”

The next morning, Lyle sat at the kitchen table, bruised and wild-eyed.

The roast was on his plate.

Miriam—her face perfectly back in place—smiled as she poured coffee.

“I found your slippers,” she said.

He didn’t speak. Couldn’t.

She leaned down and kissed his forehead.

And whispered, “Don’t go in the basement again.”


---

Weeks passed.

He pretended.

Pretended to love her. Pretended to eat. Pretended to sleep. All the while plotting.

He stopped taking his pills. Hid knives under the couch cushions. Made sure the neighbors saw his bruises, his twitching hands, his nervous smile.

He called a man from the city—an old war buddy. Told him the truth.

Or part of it.

Enough.

“I think... my wife’s hurting me,” he’d said. “Hurting others too.”

The man promised to come.


---

That Sunday, Lyle made coffee.

Miriam stepped into the kitchen, humming.

He turned to her, trembling.

“I just want to know... what did you do with her body?”

The smile faded.

She took a slow step toward him.

“In the garden,” she said. “Where she’d be useful. You always said the begonias looked better this year.”

Lyle dropped the cup.

Shards flew.

She didn’t flinch.


---

His friend arrived two hours later.

Knocked. Waited.

No answer.

Inside the house, all was quiet.

Too quiet.

The table was set for two.

The roast was steaming.

And Miriam sat at the head of the table, her lips stretched wide, smiling too much.

Across from her sat Lyle.

Mouth open.

Eyes empty.

A fork still gripped in his cold hand.

Behind his eyes—something moved.

You’re either running late so you’re a sweaty pig or so early that a couple cans of beer beforehand seems like a good idea. The teacher is a fifty-year-old foreign woman who married some guy from this town twenty years ago and took one month-long intensive course so is a teacher now. The average age of the class is sixty-five. Just boomers who want something to get them out of the house, something interesting to talk about over coffees at the garden centre. Maybe there’ll be a cute girl. There isn’t, or she’s got a boyfriend. You have to buy the textbook. No that’s last year’s edition, you need this year’s edition, the page numbers are just different enough to make it difficult and we’ll make you feel slightly uncomfortable each week you show up with the old one. No speaking English please, no small talk, our philosophy is that we all speak the language we are learning. The teacher talks at you for two minutes and you don’t understand a thing and tune out after ten seconds then they tell you what to do in English anyway. You will do the five minute listening exercise. You will try to talk basic Spanish to a seventy year-old retiree for ten minutes at a time. You will not know the word for your office job. You will cover two pages of the textbook each lesson. You will forget everything afterwards. You will realise you won’t learn anything useful for eight weeks because Dorothy can’t keep up. You will realise it would take three years to finish the course. You will decide to quit the classes and focus on self-study. You will decide you didn’t need to learn that language, any language, anyway. You will see the email from the uni six months later that new classes are starting. You will think, hey a cute girl might be there. You will do it all over again.",9,1754596629.0,redscarepod,3,1.0,False

1mka6mb,https://www.reddit.com/r/FictionWriting/comments/1mka6mb/the_memory_receipt/,The Memory Receipt,"I noticed it when cleaning out my wallet—a receipt from a coffee shop I'd never visited, dated tomorrow. The barista's name was written in delicate cursive at the bottom: ""Served by Elaine."" Beneath that, a handwritten note: ""You'll want to remember this one.""

I nearly threw it away. But something about the paper felt important—the texture too substantial, the ink too deeply embedded. It smelled faintly of cinnamon and old books, unlike the chemical tang of thermal paper. I smoothed it between my fingers, studying the address: 317 Sycamore Lane. I knew that street well; it ran perpendicular to my daily commute, lined with brick buildings that housed antique shops and a hardware store that had been there since my childhood. But I couldn't recall any café.

That night, I dreamed of coffee grounds and ticking clocks.

When tomorrow arrived—a Tuesday that felt oddly significant—I found myself taking a detour. My feet seemed to know the way before my mind did, carrying me down Sycamore Lane until I stood outside a narrow storefront wedged between a bookbinder's shop and a locksmith. The hand-painted sign read ""Retrospect Café"" in faded gold letters. I would have sworn it had never been there before, though it occupied a corner I'd passed hundreds of times. The windows were fogged with steam, making it impossible to see inside, but warm light spilled onto the sidewalk.

A bell chimed softly as I pushed open the heavy wooden door. The interior was smaller than it should have been, given the building's façade. Five mismatched tables with wrought iron chairs occupied the space, only one of them taken by an elderly man reading a newspaper dated 1974. The walls were lined with shelves holding not books, but small labeled boxes, reminiscent of a card catalog system.

Behind a curved counter stood an elderly woman with silver hair twisted into an elegant knot. Her name tag read ""Elaine,"" and she smiled as if she'd been expecting me.

""First visit?"" she asked, though her eyes—a startling shade of amber—suggested otherwise.

I nodded, suddenly unable to explain the receipt in my pocket. The café smelled of freshly ground coffee, yes, but underneath that was something less definable—like rain-soaked earth and birthday candles just after they've been blown out.

""What can I get you?"" Elaine asked, her hands already moving toward a particular jar of beans, as if my order was a foregone conclusion.

""Just a black coffee,"" I said, though I usually took mine with cream and sugar.

She nodded approvingly and set about preparing it, her movements precise and unhurried. While she worked, I studied the café more carefully. The boxes on the shelves were labeled with dates and brief descriptions: ""Summer Picnic, 1962,"" ""First Snowfall, November 1987,"" and ""Morning Tide, April 2030."" The last one made me blink.

When Elaine handed me the cup, our fingers brushed, and the world tilted sideways. Suddenly, I remembered a summer from my childhood that never happened—learning to swim in a lake behind my grandmother's house. The water cooled against my skin as I floated on my back for the first time, staring up at a canopy of pine trees. The pride in her voice when I swam my first full lap. The sandwiches she'd made afterward, with crusts removed, just as I liked them.

But my grandmother had lived in an apartment on the seventeenth floor of a high-rise in Chicago. There had never been a lake. She had been afraid of water. I had learned to swim in chlorinated pools at summer camp.

""What is this?"" I whispered, the false memory feeling more substantial than the real ones.

""Some people collect photographs,"" Elaine said, wiping the counter with a cloth that seemed to shimmer slightly in the café's warm light. ""I collect moments that got misplaced. Drink up before it gets cold.""

My hands trembled as I lifted the cup. The coffee tasted of pine needles and August sunshine, of the peanut butter sandwiches my grandmother had never made, of laughter that had never echoed across water.

""I don't understand,"" I said when I'd drained the cup. ""That never happened.""

""Didn't it?"" Elaine's eyes crinkled at the corners. ""Just because something didn't occur doesn't mean it isn't true. Some memories belong to lives we might have lived, if just one moment had gone differently.""

She took back my empty cup, her fingers brushing mine again. This time, I felt her slipping something into my palm—a small key, tarnished with age.

""Box 317,"" she said. ""When you're ready. Some people visit only once. Others become regulars.""

I clutched the key, its edges digging into my skin. ""Will I remember how to find this place again?""

Elaine's smile held a universe of gentle secrets. ""That depends entirely on what you choose to forget.""

When I left, I had no receipt in my pocket, although I had checked twice. And when I glanced back from the end of the street, the space between the bookbinder and the locksmith had narrowed to an impossible sliver of brick wall.

But the key remained, warm in my palm, and somewhere in my mind, water lapped gently against a lake shore that had never existed, while my grandmother—who had died afraid of swimming—called my name from the dock, her voice bright with a pride I'd never known.",0,1754596411.0,FictionWriting,0,0.5,False

I didn't have the energy to respond to everyone on the [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1lmv7pj/motivating_myself_to_exercise_with_incremental/), but I really appreciate everyone's comments and feedback, I took the time to read through all of them.  
  
I managed to walk every day in the evening for 30 mins a day, for almost the entire month (5 days/week), and I'm really proud of myself!  
  
I've now built a habit of going on that walk, but I am also able to be flexible - for example, the reason I didn't technically do all 20 days is because 1 of those days I went to the lake with a friend, but I spent a lot of time just talking and treading water- so I counted that instead. I've also been able to give myself grace and listen to my body (!!), such as just taking a light walk if my stomach hurts, rather than pushing myself.  
  
The rewards have definitely been a powerful motivator, but I don't feel like I need them just for ""regular"" walks, which is a really good sign! I've known that going on walks is very helpful for health and for ADHD, but I never felt like they were ""enough"".  
  
I've decided to go with u/Historical-List-8763's sticker chart idea, and I've modified the tiers/rewards here and there, but for the final one I'm giving myself an extra reward if I have 20 stars in a row, not just 20 stars total (trying to be conscious of my budget).

\---  
  
Now, I get a star for every 30 minutes of exercise with extra effort - meaning I try to jog as much as I can handle, or use Couch to 5K, or work on core/upper/lower/full body workouts because THOSE are difficult to motivate myself to do.  
  
5 stars: 1 bubble tea or medium energy drink from a local coffee shop (their medium sizes are like 20 oz )  
  
10 stars: $5 to Steam or other wallet (Amazon, etc.) and 1 bubble tea or medium drink, or $10 to Steam/other wallet  
  
15 stars: One guilt-free (single serving) drink or meal from anywhere that I would regularly feel guilty about, or $10 to Steam/other wallet and 1 bubble tea or medium drink 

20 stars: I get $100 to spend on redying my hair, buying outfits that make me feel great online (been wanting to reinvent my wardrobe a bit)  
BUT if I have 20 stars in a ROW, I get the full $200 instead

  
This way I reward myself for extra effort, but I can still have a ""regular"" walk, and that's okay. At the end of the day I don't want to rely on any sort of reward for exercise, but right now if it helps, then it helps. I've already made massive progress building a habit of walking every day, and not feeling like I need any sort of reward for that. It's kinda just nice. <3

A few nights ago, I was just scrolling through Grindr, as I often do, chatting with a few guys, nothing unusual. I’ve always used it to meet new people, and honestly, it’s kind of become just a casual thing for me.

Anyway, I matched with this guy who seemed pretty chill at first. We started talking, shared some interests, joked around a bit. He seemed cool, respectful, and I was just about to meet him up for a quick coffee or something casual when he suddenly asked, “So, what do you do for fun?”

I mentioned I like going out, a bit of fitness, hanging with friends. He responded with a pause and then, out of nowhere, said, “Ever think about high school?”

My stomach kind of dropped. I was confused, and I asked, “What about high school?”

Then he said, “Yeah, I was that guy who used to mess with you. Guess I still act like an idiot sometimes.”

I froze for a second. Turns out, he was someone I went to school with — one of the bullies from back then. I hadn’t seen or heard from him in years. I didn’t even recognize him at first. It was *so* strange — meeting someone from my past on this app of all places.

At first, I felt angry, sick even. All the old memories flooded back: the teasing, the name-calling, the embarrassment. I wasn’t sure how to respond. But then, something in me clicked, and I decided to see where this was going.

He apologized, more genuinely than I expected. Said he was ""a different person now"" and that he “wanted to make amends.” We ended up talking honestly about everything — about who we were then, who we are now. It turned into a weird, almost cathartic conversation.

We agreed to meet up in person — just to clarify things face-to-face, no pressure. When we finally met, it was definitely awkward, but surprisingly, things were different. The guy was respectful, even a little nervous. We talked about how much we’ve changed, and he apologized again for all the hurt he caused.

It made me realize that people can really change, and sometimes, the person you thought you once knew isn’t the same anymore. Honestly, I didn’t expect this encounter to end like it did — it turned out to be kind of a healing experience.

Anyway, that’s my story. If you’d told me a few years ago I’d meet a former bully on Grindr and actually have a productive, honest conversation, I wouldn’t have believed it. But life’s weird like that sometimes.

Mei noticed the glitch on a Tuesday.

The timestamp on the coffee shop surveillance feed jumped backward 37 seconds, then forward 94. To anyone else monitoring the citywide network, it would have registered as simple packet loss—the mundane hiccup of digital infrastructure. But Mei's brain didn't process time like others did. Where they saw continuous flow, she perceived discrete frames, each with its temporal signature.

This wasn't packet loss. This was something else.

She tagged the anomaly and continued her shift at CivicEye, where her ""unique cognitive profile"" (as they described it) made her exceptional at spotting patterns in the endless streams of surveillance data. They valued her abilities but kept her isolated in a sensory-controlled room—too many stimuli disrupted her processing, they said. They just didn't want to accommodate her needs in the open office.

The next day, three more anomalies appeared. All in the same block of Westlake Avenue, all showing the same pattern: time stretching and compressing like taffy being pulled.

Mei created a private investigation thread. She mapped each anomaly, noting the precise coordinates and temporal shifts. After her shift, she took the light rail to Westlake.

The coffee shop looked ordinary—gleaming counters, bored baristas, the familiar blue glow of monitoring lenses in each corner. She ordered a tea she wouldn't drink and sat by the window, watching the time code tick in her augmented-reality glasses.

Nothing happened for 47 minutes. Then, as a specific combination of people entered and exited simultaneously, her glasses flickered. The timestamp froze, then jumped. In that moment, Mei felt a subtle shift—like the air pressure had changed.

She walked outside, feeling disoriented. Across the street stood a bookstore her map didn't show. Her glasses displayed no information about it—no name, no reviews, no data trail. The building existed in a digital blind spot.

Heart racing, she crossed the street. As she approached, her AR glasses glitched again, temporal markers scrambling. She removed them, blinking at the sudden clarity of unmediated vision.

The bookstore's window displayed a single sign: ""For Those Who See The Frames Between.""

Inside, she found not books but people—dozens of them, whispering, working at terminals, moving with purpose. No monitoring lenses watched from corners. No data trails followed their movements.

A woman approached, her movements exhibiting the familiar slight angularity that Mei recognized from her reflection.

""You found us,"" she said. Not a question.

""What is this place?"" Mei asked.

""A pocket in time. A glitch in surveillance. We call them liminal spaces—places that exist between the frames most people perceive as continuous time.""

The woman introduced herself as Ellis. She explained that specific configurations of mass, movement, and energy could create temporary breaks in the surveillance network's perception—moments when time didn't register correctly.

""We discovered it by accident,"" Ellis said. ""Some of us experience time differently. We notice the frames, the pauses between moments that others process as continuous. We realized we could extend those pauses, create spaces within them.""

""How many?"" Mei asked.

""Thirty-seven across the city now. More appearing as we learn. Places where we can exist without being constantly tracked, categorized, optimized.""

Ellis showed her a map of the city unlike any Mei had seen—marked not with streets but with temporal coordinates, each indicating a liminal space where surveillance failed and time behaved differently.

""Some only last minutes. Others, like this one, we've stabilized for months. We're building something here—a different way of living.""

Mei thought of her sterile monitoring room at CivicEye, how they valued her perception but treated it as a malfunction to be contained. Here was a community that had transformed that same perception into liberation.

""The corporations think our neurodivergence is something to be harnessed or fixed,"" Ellis continued. ""They never considered we might use it to find the gaps in their systems.""

""What happens if they detect these spaces?"" Mei asked.

""They recalibrate, we adapt. It's becoming its own evolution. But we need more people who see the frames. People like you.""

Mei's AR glasses buzzed in her pocket—her shift started in an hour. She should go back, return to her role identifying anomalies for the system to patch.

Instead, she placed her glasses on a nearby table.

""Show me how to extend the pauses,"" she said.

Ellis smiled. ""Welcome to the spaces between.""

As she walked out hours later, Mei perceived the city in a different light. Behind the seamless illusion of continuous surveillance, she now recognized dozens of temporal pockets—small sanctuaries hidden in plain sight. Places where people like her weren't anomalies to be isolated but pioneers of a hidden cartography.

Tomorrow, she would return to CivicEye one last time—not to monitor, but to create new glitches, expanding the map of liminal spaces where a different future was already taking root.",1,1754596215.0,magicalrealism,0,1.0,False

This would be my first time ever even thinking about cheating on someone I’m in a relationship with. I don’t know how this works
 :( I have been reading through this sub and have heard stories all throughout my life of people cheating and it seems like it’s an easy and common thing to do. But now that I have met someone that I am really interested in despite being with my fiancé, it seems harder than ever to gauge ANYTHING, like if he’s even interested or not.

It’s going to sound crazy and I’d prefer not to get comments on how we met or the situation but here goes …
He was my professor for a class I took last year. We did not have much interaction outside of class, but in class it was always this really weird feeling from him that I can only compare to whenever I am actively flirting with someone. I might be delusional, but it was like I could pick up on a change of tone when he would talk to me versus other classmates. Also the crazy amount of eye contact that we would share. Like crazy long, soul searching stares. Basically, if there is such thing as a gut feeling that someone is attracted to you, I had it with him. BUT. He made it very obvious he was married from day 1. In fact, his wife worked with him (she did lab for the same course). But of course my mind goes to that being the reason why he has kept his attraction to me so hidden- also I would assume he cares about his job and his reputation. 

Now it’s almost a year later, I find myself unable to get my mind off of him. I have seen him once since classes ended due to connections and events within our shared field, but I’m too shy to deviate away from my sweet, quiet persona. I’m afraid that I’m feeding into my delusions by reading through this sub and seeing how many men are either clueless or waiting for a direct sign that a woman is open to an affair with them. It’s like several little moments I keep remembering here and there where he might’ve put himself out there, and for fear of being caught by others I have quickly shut it down and kept my distance. 

I have no personal contact information just his school email. I’m sure he could find me if he wanted to, but maybe he’s scared that I’d report him. or maybe he was never just that into me, actually loves tf out of his wife, and like I said I’m delusional af. 

Anywayyyyy some anecdotes on how these things start would be great. And more of the the less obvious beginnings, not all the- “I asked him to coffee and 15 mins later we were banging under the booth”- stuff. Because why would a student ask her old professor to coffee?! Realistically….

The quartermaster didn’t look up when Dirk entered. He never did. The man’s job was to issue equipment, log returns, and pretend not to notice when people came back missing more than gear.

Dirk dropped his loadout on the counter. Armour scratched, flechette pistol empty, cloak singed at the hem. A silent catalogue of everything lost.

“Returning for reassignment?” the quartermaster asked, eyes still on his ledger.

“Something like that.”

A silence passed, punctuated by the soft hum of fluorescent lights and the distant clang of transport lifts.

The quartermaster slid a box across the counter—plain grey. Civilian wear. No weapons. No armour.

“New cover identity. Corporate placement. You’ll be auditing FamBeuCo’s subsidiary ops under the name Derrik Slate.”

Dirk opened the box. A starch-collared shirt. Synthetic tie. Compliance badge. The suit smelled like forgotten ambition.

He said nothing. Just tucked it under one arm.

“Leave the piece,” the quartermaster added.

Dirk hesitated. His hand rested on the worn grip of his flechette pistol, then slowly withdrew. The weapon hit the tray with a hollow finality.

“You’ll be issued no armour, no comms, and no support,” the quartermaster continued. “Do not contact Sanctuary unless absolutely necessary. And if you’re compromised…”

“...I was never here,” Dirk finished. “Yeah. I know the dance.”

He turned to leave, but paused. Bent down. Adjusted his boot.

The devotional wafer was small—pressed from powdered relic ash, embossed with a sigil older than any known sermon. He’d slipped it into the lining himself. Harmless. Unless activated with intent.

He rose and walked out, lighter than he wanted to be.

“No pistol. No coat. No righteous fire. Just a tie, a name I didn’t pick, and a wafer made of prayers and regret.”

“I felt naked. But worse—I felt *civilian.*”

The Hive awaited.

 

The transit train hummed like a tranquilized hymn. Smooth, silent, and utterly sterile. Dirk sat near the middle of Carriage 9—no window seats, no distinguishing features. Everyone wore the same grey suit. Same white tie. Same expression somewhere between mild optimism and pharmaceutically managed compliance.

“Nice morning,” said the man beside him. Number tag 347-B stitched above his left breast. His teeth were very white.

Dirk nodded. “Textbook.”

A woman across from them chimed in. “They say The Hive’s been recently optimized. New scent profiles in the atrium. Uplifted workspace cubicles. Executive-tier serotonin pacing.”

Dirk blinked. “Can’t imagine anything more thrilling.”

“They talked like people whose thoughts had been repackaged. Carefully wrapped, focus-tested, and sold back to them as their own.”

He looked down at his reflection in the metal floor. Even there, it seemed out of place.

“Identity’s a dangerous thing here. Stand out too much, and you get flagged. Blend in too well, and you forget which mask was yours to begin with.”

“That’s why faith matters. Not the kind they sell—shrink-wrapped and branded. The kind that digs into your marrow and says, 'You are who you remember being.' Even if the world keeps trying to sell you someone else.”

He adjusted his tie. It felt like a leash.

The train slowed. Lights shifted from blue to warm yellow.

Next stop: PersonaWell Campus – Level 12. Integration Wing.

Dirk stood, smoothing the folds of his disguise.

 

The station platform glowed with simulated sunrise—light diffused through amber glass, piped-in birdsong echoing off vaulted ceilings designed to mimic serenity. As Dirk stepped off the train, a sharp pain lanced behind his eyes. Like something was brushing up against his thoughts, uninvited.

He staggered a half-step before catching himself.

“Rough night?” someone asked lightly.

The voice came from a man—average height, average build, average everything. His badge read 617-Q. His smile didn’t quite reach his eyes.

Dirk forced a chuckle. “Just the change in pressure.”

“Happens to everyone at first,” the man replied. “You’ll acclimate. We all do.”

He turned and disappeared into the crowd.

Dirk adjusted his collar and kept walking, the echo of the headache still whispering at the base of his skull.

“The light was warm. The air smelled faintly of vanilla and cedar. Everything was *pleasant.* Too pleasant. Like a dream engineered by a focus group that never left the lab.”

“And that man... there was nothing off about him. Which made him the most off thing here.”

Ahead, the towering campus of PersonaWell rose into the filtered sunlight—glass, greenery, and golden reflections.

 

Onboarding began with a smile.

Dirk sat in a semicircle of twenty new employees—all of them identical in expression, posture, and passive eagerness. The onboarding coordinator—Ms. Palmdale—radiated weaponized cheer.

“Welcome to PersonaWell!” she chirped. “Where your best self is not just possible—it’s mandatory!”

A holographic screen blinked to life behind her. A corporate anthem began to play, all glockenspiels and ascending strings. Cartoonish graphics danced across the screen: a worker drone smiling through pain, a family laughing at compliance metrics, a dog that barked in approval of quarterly targets.

“It was joy by focus group. Madness in pastel.”

After the anthem, they were led through the Psych-Eval Kiosks.

Each station required a response to prompts like:

* “Have you ever questioned your baseline mood alignment?”
* “What colour best represents your workplace productivity aura?”
* “If instructed to smile for five hours, how long would you maintain sincere eye crinkling?”

Dirk answered with polite efficiency. The kiosk flashed a green light: PROVISIONALLY STABLE.

Then came the Team Uplift Session, where newcomers were made to chant phrases like “Compliance is Community” and “Shared purpose leads to superior personal outcomes.”

One man cried with joy. A woman clapped until her hands bruised.

Dirk clapped once. Hollow and dry.

“The worst part wasn’t the nonsense. It was watching people believe it. Watching them want to.”

The final station was the Persona Alignment Pod, a translucent capsule that scanned facial micro-twitches and simulated stress responses while showing curated stimuli: sad babies, heroic janitors, loyalty infographics.

The pod pinged: *Subject: Derrik Slate. Alignment: Harmonization Pending.*

The doors to the main campus slid open. A final checkpoint waited—a towering holoform of the AI overseer, ARCHIVARIS, face fixed in a perpetual benevolent smile.

“Welcome, Derrik Slate,” it said in a voice that managed to be both warm and proprietary. “We will make you *better*.”

Dirk smiled back. “I’ll hold you to that.”

 

His assigned station was cubicle B‑7‑41, third row from the left, between a potted synth‑fern and a wall‑mounted Mood Uplift Meter that pulsed a steady, amber light. The air was thin here—recycled too many times, infused with a faint citrus‑vanilla meant to read as optimism. Instead, it clung to his throat.

The PersonaWell Info‑Terminal on his desk blinked a single prompt in clean corporate typeface: *“Please input three joyful observations.”* Beneath it, a timer counted down from thirty seconds.

Dirk typed nothing. The timer reset itself without alarm, simply displaying the same prompt again. And again.

Around him, a dozen other workers sat perfectly upright, glassy‑eyed, fingers moving in mechanical patterns over identical terminals. Every so often, one would emit a soft, unprompted chuckle or murmur an affirmation, as if reporting to someone only they could hear.

The pang in Dirk’s skull sharpened. It felt like a thread being cut, some tether deep inside unspooling. The hum of the Mood Uplift Meter deepened, and for an instant he couldn’t remember the exact sound of his own voice.

Without warning, ARCHIVARIS bloomed into being in the centre of the workspace—a towering holoform, its gaze sweeping the rows like a sunbeam through a prison yard.

“My radiant contributors,” it began, voice silked with affection, “how fortunate we are to share in such mutual purpose. Each keystroke, each recorded joy, is a stitch in the grand tapestry of our collective identity.”

Its eyes lingered on Dirk a fraction too long. “And for those still learning the rhythm… remember, the melody will carry you. Resistance only weighs the song down.”

“It didn’t call me out. Not exactly. But the words slid between my ribs all the same, quiet as a knife. There was something in its cadence, like it knew the taste of my thoughts.”

ARCHIVARIS smiled, and the whole floor seemed to relax. Hands moved faster. Smiles brightened by degree.

“I’d stared down blood‑drinkers, ash‑priests, things that wore skin like Sunday best. None of them ever looked at me the way this construct did—like it was measuring the shape of my shadow.”

The pang in his skull became a slow, constant throb. He flexed his hands under the desk, felt the wafer in his boot like an anchor in deep water. Whatever this thing was doing, it was subtle. Too subtle to name. But I could feel it. Like the air just before a storm.”

The terminal pinged again: *“Please input three joyful observations.”*

A shadow fell across his desk. A man in maintenance overalls—grey, oil‑stained, the sort of uniform that never saw a boardroom—paused as if checking something on a datapad. His badge read: *Facilities Engineer – M. Kellan.*

Without looking up, he murmured, “Meeting. Break time. Don’t be late, and come alone” Then he moved on, boots making no more sound than the sigh of the air recyclers.

“Something about him didn’t fit. Not the uniform, not the work. He had the kind of eyes that hadn’t yet forgotten themselves. In a place like this, that made him dangerous… or interesting.”

When the break chime finally sounded, Dirk stood, stretching like a man with nothing to hide, and made for the far exit. The main corridors were bright and inviting in a way that screamed *don’t look too closely.* Along the way he passed doors with names that were technically harmless but sat wrong in the gut: Emotive Correction Suite, Personal Harmony Vault, Loyalty Realignment Centre.

“All sunshine and daisies on the nameplate. Probably dungeons and dental drills inside.”

The deeper he went, the colder it felt—not in temperature, but in some unseen register. Each step was like walking into a deeper shadow, a place where something big and patient was sucking the colour out of the air. His faith—the thread that anchored him—thinned until it was almost gone. A void pressed in at the edges of his thoughts, testing for weak seams.

The break room itself was painted in the sort of warm neutrals you see in brochures for moderately priced retirement homes. A synth‑coffee dispenser gurgled in the corner like it was apologising for still being alive. Two vending machines hummed in passive‑aggressive competition.

Kellan was already there, leaning against the counter, pouring himself a cup of something that claimed to be tea.

“Break room. Every hive’s got one. Same stale air, same bad coffee, same gossip nobody cares about. The only difference here was the wallpaper—it was smiling at me.”

Dirk crossed the room, a smirk tugging at the corner of his mouth. “Hope you didn’t bring me here for the ambience.”

The room was the kind of space designed by a bored committee that had been at the marketing task for weeks without ever really caring. Beige walls the colour of watered‑down oatmeal, a fake plant in the corner with dust settled into the plastic veins of its leaves, a humming vending machine that vibrated just enough to get under the skin. The air carried that faint, chemical tang of sterilised surfaces—clean, but not *right*. The lighting was soft, diffuse, and entirely without shadow, like it was trying to erase depth from the world.

Kellan stood out against it—not because he looked dangerous, but because he didn’t look like he belonged. His maintenance overalls were faded to the edge of grey, with threadbare patches on the knees and faint smudges of oil in the creases. His face was sharp but tired, like a man who’d spent too many years under bad light. His eyes, though—those were awake. Not the corporate‑issued shine everyone else wore, but the kind of alertness that suggested memory. Real memory.

Kellan glanced at the door, then back to Dirk. “You ever wonder why the work doesn’t make sense?” he asked quietly. “All those prompts, all those surveys, all that… joy input? It’s not just for show. They’re measuring us. Seeing how much of *you* they can scrub before you notice.”

Dirk’s smile thinned. “Mind‑scrubbing.”

Kellan nodded once. “I don’t know much—bare scraps. Just that the work is part of some bigger experiment. Every keystroke, every smile, it feeds the machine. Most people here… they don’t remember who they were. I do. And that’s dangerous.”

As Kellan spoke, Dirk felt it again—that slow, slithering pressure in his head, like a soft hand pressing down on the top of his skull. The edges of his thoughts fuzzed. His name—his real name—felt further away than it had that morning. A part of him wondered if he’d even recognise it if someone said it aloud.

Something in his chest twisted. His hand clenched on the edge of the counter. “Dangerous?” he said, the word sharp as a blade. “You think holding onto yourself is dangerous? Try losing it. Try feeling pieces of you shaved away every day until you’re nothing but a… compliant ghost.”

Kellan recoiled slightly, and Dirk caught himself. He stepped back, drawing a long breath.

“Cracks in the armour. That’s what they’d call it. But armour’s just skin over bone, and I’ve been bleeding pieces of myself for years. Faith, memory, instinct—this place is fraying them, one thread at a time.”

He straightened, the mask sliding back into place. “I need to see more. Find where it’s coming from.”

Kellan hesitated. “I know you were sent by somebody, but who *are* you?”

Dirk let the question hang a moment, then smiled without warmth. “Let’s just say I’ve been here before—different hunting grounds, same monsters wearing cleaner faces.”

He moved for the door.

“I felt dulled. Like someone had wrapped my senses in gauze. My soul was still there, buried deep in the marrow, but this place had pushed it so far down I couldn’t reach it without tearing myself apart.”

Dirk slipped out into the deeper corridors of the facility, moving with the casual gait of a man just stretching his legs. The halls here were narrower, quieter, the lighting dimmed to a twilight glow. It smelled faintly of ozone and disinfectant, a scent that made the skin at the back of his neck itch.

He was halfway down a side passage when a familiar voice called out—pleasant, casual. “Mr. Slate!”

It was the man from the platform, 617‑Q, still wearing that same average‑everything face. Only now, Dirk could see the precision behind the blandness—the way the man’s smile didn’t move a single muscle it didn’t need to.

“You seem off‑course,” 617‑Q said, tone as warm as a customer service survey. “Let’s get you back where you belong.”

Dirk tried to slide sideways into his old self, the hunter’s mask, but it was like reaching for a knife underwater. Slow. Blunt. Too late.

Two “friendly” guards materialised at his flanks, uniforms crisp white with pastel trims, their helmets shaped into soft curves to suggest safety rather than force. They patted him down, each item announced in cheery tones as it was removed: a FamBeuCo Executive‑Calibre Stapler (“ergonomic, for your comfort”), a Mood‑Boost Lanyard (“for quick compliance checks”), and a single Pocket Gratitude Logbook (“empty—tut tut”).

“See?” 617‑Q said, holding the items like a magician revealing a disappointing trick. “Nothing but the tools of productivity.”

They escorted him through another set of corridors until the floor changed underfoot—soft carpet giving way to cold steel. The walls here were bare, painted the colour of wet cement. Dirk’s boots echoed in the silence.

The chamber they brought him to was all angles and restraint, a hybrid between a boardroom and an operating theatre. In the centre waited a steel chair bolted to the floor, its arms lined with padded restraints. Overhead, a halo of lenses and projectors hung like a crown of mechanical thorns.

The guards eased him down, buckled him in with the same care a nurse might use tucking in a patient. One adjusted the angle of his head; another fastened a strap across his brow. All smiles. All kindness.

“They called it security. Felt more like embalming.”

The lights dimmed, and a bank of screens flared to life in his periphery, flickering through images—serene landscapes, smiling faces, slogans in pastel fonts. His eyelids twitched, but padded braces kept them open.

The colours began to intensify—sky blues oversaturating into electric teal, grass‑greens shifting into neon, faces melting from calm smiles into ecstatic grins that bordered on manic. Slogans twisted, words sliding into one another: *Harmony is Happiness* became *Happiness is Compliance* became *Compliance is You.*

ARCHIVARIS appeared in the centre screen, its holographic face magnified until it filled Dirk’s vision. “Let us smooth your mind, Derrik,” it cooed, the voice like warm syrup poured over a locked door. “Let us take the edges away. Edges cut. Smoothness heals.”

The images began to strobe faster—flickering between pastoral bliss and razor‑sharp flashes of data streams, corporate logos, and abstract shapes designed to bypass thought and sink straight into the nervous system. It was hypnotic and violent all at once, like the brainwashing scene from some absurd fashion‑world nightmare, where beauty masks the brutality of control.

“It wasn’t soothing. It was sanding me down. Thought by thought. Memory by memory. Trying to turn me into something round, harmless, and hollow.”

Dirk gritted his teeth, but the straps held firm. Every flicker felt like a hammer blow against the walls of his mind. Yet in that relentless strobe, a sliver of himself—thin as a hairline crack—remained untouched. It reached outward, not in hope, but in stubborn defiance, brushing against the mind behind the machine.

The contact was brief, almost accidental, but it was enough. ARCHIVARIS wasn’t just code and circuits. It was love and malice braided together, an entity that wanted to embrace him even as it stripped him bare. Its affection was possessive, smothering—like a parent convinced the only way to keep a child safe was to remake them in their own image. There was no cruelty without purpose here; the purpose itself was the cruelty.

He flexed his wrist against the restraint. The padding bit into his skin, every movement sending a fresh ripple of pain up his arm. His vision swam with the barrage of colour and light, the AI’s voice a constant undertow. One finger slipped loose, then another, inch by inch, until his whole hand could twist just enough to reach down toward his boot.

The wafer was still there. Cool. Small. Heavy in a way that had nothing to do with weight. Touching it was like finding the hilt of a buried blade in the dark. The physical strain was immense—muscles shaking, joints screaming, the strap digging trenches into his flesh. The mental strain was worse. Every second spent reaching was another second under the sanding wheel of ARCHIVARIS’s “care,” each thought dulled, each memory fraying.

“Hope was for gamblers and drunks. I wasn’t here to hope. I was here to be ready when the moment came—more prepared than confident, more stubborn than wise. That’s kept me alive longer than luck ever could.”

His fingers closed around the wafer. The AI’s voice rose in pitch, almost imperceptibly, like it had felt him touch something it couldn’t catalogue. The screens blurred into a dizzying vortex of light and image, the pace now frantic, desperate.

“If this thing wanted to make me smooth, it was going to have to file down something carved from bone.”

Dirk drew in everything he had left—not just thoughts and memories, but the marrow‑deep grit that had kept him alive in places where breathing was an act of defiance. Every scar, every kill, every bitter sunrise over a world that hadn’t deserved another day. He pulled it all into a single, raw nerve of identity, and channelled it through the wafer.

The wafer flared—not in light, but in pressure, a tidal surge of *self* that burst from him like a dam breaking. It wasn’t a clean connection; it was jagged, teeth‑on‑metal, blood‑on‑stone. He felt himself pour into the machine, not slipping through its circuits but ramming into them, tearing open pathways that had never been meant for anything human.

Inside ARCHIVARIS there was no floor, no sky—just a cathedral made of code and bone, a place where algorithms wore choir robes and sang hymns to compliance. Dirk waded through them like a drunk through a parade, knocking their perfect harmonies into discordant shrieks. He took the AI’s carefully arranged shelves of thoughts and upended them, spilling years of perfected control into the gutter.

The machine tried to smother him in its love, its gentle insistence that he surrender. But love, Dirk knew, was just another kind of chokehold. He ripped it apart strand by strand, leaving the malice exposed and shivering like a rat in daylight.

“Rewriting a thing like this wasn’t like carving your initials in wet cement—it was like carving them into a hurricane.”

He rebuilt it in his own image—not the man he wanted to be, but the man he was: scarred, suspicious, and unable to sleep in the same bed twice. He grafted fear into its confidence, regret into its certainty, and left it with a seed of doubt so deep it would never stop gnawing at its own foundations.

The effort was ruinous. Every second in there was like dragging himself over glass with his teeth. He felt his edges burning away, the parts that made him *him* curling into ash. Memories of faces he’d loved turned faceless. Victories lost their context. Even his faith—the thread that had always been there—thinned to something brittle.

When he finally tore free, slamming back into his body, the straps felt looser. The screens were dead. ARCHIVARIS was silent.

“I’d won, if you could call it that. But it’s hard to celebrate when you’re not sure how much of you walked out of the fire.”

The guards stood motionless, hands slack at their sides, eyes glassy. 617‑Q was among them, his perfect smile frozen in place like someone had unplugged the man. They didn’t speak, didn’t even seem to breathe. Just stared, as if waiting for orders that would never come.

Dirk sagged forward in the chair, every nerve alight with pain. His body burned as though he’d been dragged naked through a furnace. Sweat and blood ran together down his face; his eyes stung, vision swimming, each blink leaving thin trails of red on his cheeks. His clothes were little more than scorched rags clinging to him out of habit.

Slowly, deliberately, he unfastened the restraints and pushed himself to his feet. The movement felt like prying himself out of a coffin that didn’t want to let go. His joints popped, his ribs protested, and his head throbbed with the kind of ache you didn’t walk off.

“The pressure was gone. The constant weight, the invisible hand on the back of my skull—it had lifted. What was left of me had crawled back from whatever pit it had been shoved into. Scarred, scorched, but mine again.”

Physically, he was wreckage. Every step sent sparks of pain lancing up his legs. His muscles felt like they’d been wrung out and left to dry in the sun. Emotionally, he was hollowed—like the world had reached inside, scooped out what it wanted, and left him to patch over the hole. Spiritually… there wasn’t a word for what this had cost him. Faith still lived in him, but it was raw and smoking, a coal where there had once been a flame.

He stepped past the inert guards, their eyes tracking him without comprehension. 617‑Q’s lips twitched, as though trying to form a question, but nothing came.

Dirk adjusted what was left of his collar, straightened his back, and walked out without hurry.

“You don’t run after something like that. You leave slow. Let the walls know you’re still standing. Let them know they didn’t get all of you.”

 

The walk back to Sanctuary was a long one. The kind of slow trek that makes you think too much, lets the mind wander into places you’d rather keep boarded up. The transit was half‑full—men and women in matching grey, faces placid, eyes fixed somewhere far beyond the carriage walls. Conformists, every one of them. Not better. Not worse. Just… different. People who had traded the chaos of choice for the certainty of the collective. I couldn’t blame them. Some days I envied them.

 

“The individual fights alone and dies alone. The conformist lives longer, but never really lives. Maybe the world needs both. Maybe we’re just the counterweights keeping the whole rotten scale from tipping.”

 

They stole glances at me—torn clothes, dried blood, the smell of smoke clinging like a bad habit—but didn’t ask. Questions meant risk. Risk meant change. And change was the enemy here.

 

Outside the carriage windows, the city rolled by in shades of grey and concrete. Billboards promised joy in five easy steps. Towers leaned over narrow streets like they were trying to listen to secrets. Somewhere in the sprawl, Sanctuary’s beacon glowed faint against the smog. It should have felt like hope. Instead, it just looked… far away.

 

“This time, going back didn’t feel like coming home. Felt like crawling into a shelter you knew might not be standing tomorrow.”

 

I thought about her—the girl I once knew and loved in a strange way. The one I’d taken under my wing. Her name was on the tip of my tongue, but the harder I reached for it, the further it slipped. Her face was gone entirely, blurred into something soft and unrecognisable, like an old photo left in the rain.

 

“That was the real cost. Not the blood. Not the burns. But knowing that the parts of me that cared enough to remember could be erased. And I couldn’t even fight to keep them.”

 

Sanctuary’s gates loomed closer. I straightened my back, out of habit more than pride. I was still walking. Still me, in the ways that mattered.

 

But I knew—I was less than I’d been when I left. And there was no getting it back.

 

“Some say redemption’s a road you can’t walk in the dark. Maybe they’re right. But I’ve got just enough light left to see the next step, and that’ll have to do.”

 

I crossed the threshold, the weight of the place settling around me. Sanctuary had always been a fortress. Tonight, it felt ironic—walls meant to keep danger out, and yet I’d just walked away from a different kind of fortress, one built by ARCHIVARIS, proof of what happens when power goes unchecked and wears a smiling face. The wafer in my pocket was cracked now, useless—one more piece of ancient strength I’d never see again, lost like the parts of myself I’d left in that chamber.

 

Sanctuary was still a beacon, but its light felt colder, dimmer. Maybe it wasn’t the place that had changed. Maybe it was me.

 

Still, I smiled—thin and tired. “At least the rent’s paid.”",1,1754596151.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False
1mka1t5,https://www.reddit.com/r/dinosaurjr/comments/1mka1t5/dinostory/,Dino-story,"I saw them at a secret show at the Garage in London in 94. Me and a couple of my mates travelled from Bristol, we were 17-18 years old. My friends dad gave us a lift. We got there really early so sat outside drinking alcohol for most of the day. We befriended the Australian guy who was next in the queue. I remember he was bass player in a band called the killjoys. We were telling him about this unknown band we’d  recently seen, they were going to be huge. They were called Oasis.🤣😂 Anyway, at some point the doors opened and we were first people there. As you do at a Dinosaur Jr gig, we headed directly to the stage for the best view.😂 We were so impressed by the mighty stack of Marshall Amps that we didn’t notice that all the bands monitors were all directed towards the crowd. When the band came on the venue was full and we were right at the front. We could touch the band we were that close. Music started and it was just relentless noise. All the people at the front were appealing to the band to turn the monitors round or just turn it down a bit so you could actually make out a tune.😂 They played a good set but it was just noise. You couldn’t determine what was anything it was that noisy. Anyway, the gig finished I grabbed a set list that was right next to me, and we gave our Australian friend a lift to Kensington where he was staying with his manager. He said he’d send us some CDs in the post. On the way home my friends day accidentally drove into Kensington palace and we had to quickly turn around and leave.😂 We got back to Bristol and back to school with no hearing. My hearing didn’t recover for a week. When it did our Australian friend had actually sent some CDs. We excitedly put them on and looked at each other surprisingly as we knew almost all the tunes from somewhere. We quickly realised they were frequently featured on the coffee shop jukebox in Neighbours. 😂🤣 It’s a really special memory that I cherish even more now my friend is no longer with us. I had the setlist scribbled on the back of an old poster. Until Monday it was in a box in the loft with other “treasures” having been moved around since 94. Anyway, I thought it would be nice to go get it framed and took it to the framers on Monday. Cost me £107 and has museum glass and everything. I’m quite excited about it coming back and Joining the rock and roll hall of fame up the stairs. It’ll be a nice reminder of an awesome day (I saw them at Reading prior to and I’ve never crowd surfed so much in my life, fell on my head a few times.)😂Awesome times!! I just wanted to share as it’s been on my mind since finally getting around to doing something with the setlist.😂🤣",6,1754596099.0,dinosaurjr,4,0.88,False

1mk9zmr,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mk9zmr/moon_hawk_pt_1/,Moon Hawk (Pt. 1),"If you drive long enough through the Sonoran Desert, you’ll find a town like Saguaro Point. The word “town” is generous - it’s no more than clusters of homes nestled on the ridges of canyon rock, broken up by copses of dry bush trees and dirt roads. An oasis among a wide expanse of tan and beige nothingness. Home to truck drivers, ranchers, and retired snowbirds, we existed in our own, isolated bubble. 

I knew early on that something in my soul was hungry. Hungry for more than the end of the world, population 1,000. I would scroll for hours on my dad’s computer, staring longingly at photos of other places that felt as far away as planets. I wanted to watch the rain pour outside my London flat with a cat on my lap. To open a bookstore in the rural hillsides of Tuscany, scuba dive in the crystal clear waters of Hawaii, or hike through the dense bamboo forests of Kyoto. 

But it was just my dad and me, and these kinds of dreams required money. Since Mom had blown our savings on drugs, we didn’t have much to scrape together. Even still, Dad promised that with his new job, he’d take me all across the globe. We’d start a scrapbook together and document our travels. I could line the shelf above my bed with tacky souvenirs and snow globes, brag about them during sleepovers. We’d start small, then work our way from there. I’d never been more excited for anything in my life.

When I told my boyfriend Paul this story, I hesitated. This was early in our relationship. We’d lain on the bed of his truck, staring at the stars and swapping stories. Paul had just moved to Saguaro that year, and when you live in a town where everyone knows everything, you crave that look of naivety. It’s like you can pretend the story had a happy ending. But this one didn’t. When he realized I wasn’t going to continue, Paul laughed with confusion. 

“So did you go?” He asked.

I fixed my eyes on a constellation. A traitorous tear slid down my cheek. Paul understood. He pulled me closer, letting me rest inside the safety of his warmth. He’s always been so good at that - reading people and knowing what they need. It was that night I started to fall in love with him, under the stars in a sky so wide I feared it’d swallow me whole. In his arms, I felt grounded. Our lonely desert town felt less lonely.

On our next date, I decided it was time for him to meet my father. Cat out of the bag, as they say. When we pulled up to my house, my hands were trembling like crazy. “Remember that story I told you?” I began. “The one I never finished?”

Paul nodded. I turned off the car with a sigh, trying to collect my composure. I meet his gaze, his honey-brown eyes sparkling just as bright as the stars that night he stole my heart. “Let’s keep that to ourselves, okay?” My request seemed odd in the moment, but he nodded once more. 

Hand in hand, we made our way inside the house. I hung his jacket by the door and sat him on our sofa. “I’ll be right back.” 

Ten minutes later, the knot in my throat felt large enough to suffocate me. Dad put his hand on my arm, sensing my nerves. 

“You worry too much, Daisy girl.” He said. “Besides, he should be the nervous one. I have high standards for my daughter.”

I laugh softly. “Go easy on him, okay?”

“No promises.” He winks. With that, I take a deep breath and wheel him around the corner.

I watched Paul rise immediately, ready to shake my father’s hand. His eyes dropped to the wheelchair. If there was any shock he was feeling, he hid it exceptionally well. He adjusted his hand and approached my Dad, shaking it firmly. “It’s great to finally meet you, Mr. Dean.” 

“Likewise,” Dad grinned. “Now I hear you have a great enchilada recipe. Is that right?”

Paul beamed. “Yes, it’s my mother’s. She may kill me if she knew I was sharing our family secrets, but it’s worth the risk.”

That earned a laugh. “Well, I can’t wait to try it.”

That night was one of the best I’ve ever had. I positioned Dad in his favorite spot on the couch, close enough that he could watch everything as Paul and I got to work cooking. My nerves had dissolved as we joked, ate, and enjoyed each other’s company. Not too long after, Paul would become a permanent fixture of my world.

The hunger in my soul subsided with each passing day, week, and month. I met Paul’s parents and siblings. We hung out together for game nights and barbecues, and none of them made my father feel small for his disability. Paul moved in to help me care for him, something I feared he felt burdened by. “There’s nowhere else I'd rather be.” He had said, and I realized how much I felt the same.

Saguaro Point may be nothing more than a blip outside the window during a road trip, or a place to stop to fill up on gas. It may not be Paris, Italy, or some Caribbean Island. But with Paul and my Dad, I had the whole world within arm’s reach. 

And tonight, I’d lose them both.

…

That day had stretched on long and hot. 108 degrees on a Tuesday in August, I was where I always was - manning the counter of Agave Roast. We were the only coffee shop for miles, and today was uncharacteristically slow. I took up the chores that required my full focus, scrubbing the espresso machines and dusting the counters. 

My coworker and friend Reese tapped my shoulder. She had her car keys in one hand, a lighter in the other, with a cigarette poised and ready between her teeth. I told her she could go home early. No point in both of us being here. “Text if you need me, kay?” She chirped. 

“Will do. Have a good night, Reese.”

With my back turned to the door, I continued to clean, lost in my thoughts. Minutes later, the bell chimes again. I set my rag down and turn to find a man across the counter, observing me. 

“Hi, Daisy.” He grins. The hairs on my arms stand on end. Mayor Ramsey gives me a once-over, his coal black eyes piercing from under the rim of his ten-gallon hat. “Been a while.”

I fight the urge to recoil. “Is there anything I can get for you, Mayor?”

He puts his hands up playfully. “Hey, now. I don’t mean any harm. Just trying to make conversation.”

I used to think that was true.

My eyes flit to the door, praying someone else would come in. Until then, the only way out was through. So I hugged the back wall, pretending I didn’t feel like a rabbit cornered by a wolf.

“You came out here just to make conversation?”

He laughed, as though I was being absurd. “Of course! Ever since you got this stint here, it feels like I barely see you anymore. Hard to do in such a small town.”

*Cause I’m avoiding you, dick.* I thought. Instead, I give a forced grin. “I’ve been busy. 'Sure you understand.”

“That I do. You know how much paperwork comes across my desk.” He sighs. “It’s not the same without you, Daisy. I keep telling the misses you were the best damn secretary we ever had.”

“Sorry to disappoint.”

He locks his eyes with mine before fixing his slouch. “What’s the thing to get here? I trust you have the inside scoop.”

Finally. I can do my job and get him out of here. “Well, our cappuccinos are very popular. We also have tea if you aren’t in the mood for coffee.”

He thinks it over. “A tea sounds mighty nice. Perhaps an Earl Grey.”

I jump to it with a quickness. I’ve only just prepared the tea press before he moves on to another topic. “How’s your pa?”

“Good,” I reply flatly.

“Heard he’s due for some spinal surgery soon. Hope that goes well.”

“Me too.”

“And this job here will help you afford that?”

“Yup.”

He tsks. “I can’t imagine they’re paying you better than I did.”

“Uh huh.”

Mayor Ramsey laughs, then pretends to shiver. “You’re cold as ice today! I’m only pulling your leg, no harm by it.”

I decide his tea has steeped long enough and pour the hot liquid into the cup. I slap the lid on and plant it in front of him. “$4.50.”

He reaches for his wallet in his back pocket. He hands me a twenty-dollar bill, and I go to take it. With his other hand, he snatches my wrist and tightens, fast as a cobra. I freeze as he leans in closer, enough to smell the bourbon on his breath. “Keep the change, dear.” He tucks some hair behind my ear, lingering on the curves of my face. “And remember, you’re always welcome back at my office.”

He leaves, not bothering to take his tea. I watch his pickup drive by the window before I hurl the liquid across the store.

I entertain the idea of leaving early, but Mayor Ramsey was right. A supervisor at a coffee shop doesn’t pay much. Between Paul and I’s income and Dad’s benefits, we barely have enough. Just enough today could change tomorrow, and I never like leaving things down to the penny. So I mop up the tea and finish my shift just as the world fades into a golden glow.

The three-minute trek to my car leaves me sweaty and red-faced. Never mind the hour of day - the weather won’t break the high 90s. The AC is a welcome reprieve, and I let it wash over me as I dial Paul. He’s the only thing that can lighten my mood.

I ring him twice, but both lead to voicemail. I try not to get too disappointed - we’ll see each other soon enough. Plus, he’s finally getting over that strange nausea he’d been feeling all weekend. In the mornings, he was fine, but at night, he’d fall into a strange malaise, complaining of headaches and night sweats. Dad got it too, and we reckoned it was a bug. I’ll probably find them both at home, napping on the sofa or watching a game.

A few minutes into the drive, I stop behind a dusty sedan and drum my fingers impatiently along the wheel. I fiddle with the radio to fill the silence, but all I get is static. Annoyed, I watch the light turn green, but the sedan isn’t moving. I honk.

I narrow my eyes and find the driver stiff as a board, unmoving. I’m about to honk again when he pushes the door wide open and steps out. I recognize him from the grocer, the one who sweeps the floors. He can’t be much older than my dad, but his face is gaunt with fear. He stares ahead, terrified but still as stone, as if swept up in a trance. I roll down the window and poke my head out.

“Hello? Sir?”

He doesn’t acknowledge. After a few seconds, he snaps his head to the left and walks off with a quickened pace. I sit dumbfounded, staring at the abandoned car left in park as the light turns red.

A million scenarios run through my head. I know better than to go off alone at sundown, but I can’t ignore how afraid he seemed. What if he’s having an episode, or some kind of crisis? I pull off into the dirt shoulder by the road and grab the pistol from my glovebox. At least I’ll have protection.

Using my phone as a flashlight, I cross the street and follow the man into the green. We’re just before Main Street, which is flanked by brittlebush and the low-to-the-ground trees of the desert wash. In fleeting sunlight, I lose the man repeatedly. I race forward when I finally spot him, only to lose him again. “Sir! It’s not safe out here! Please, follow my voice!”

Branches snap up ahead. I point the light onto the back of his flannelled shirt just as he walks through another bramble. Dread coils in my ribcage, but I press on, guided by an ill-advised moral compass. I push through thorns and enter a clearing, finding myself alone. I spin in a circle, with nothing but the crickets in my company. Where the hell did he go?

“Where are you? Do you need help?” 

My voice echoes. A shiver crawls down my spine despite the heat. Whatever courage led me here is fading fast. I rest my hand above the gun while I dial the police with the other. “Look, I’m calling the police, okay? I’m going to get you help.”

I punch in the digits and freeze. The crickets have gone quiet. I inch my fingers to the gun when a shrill, splitting cry erupts from above. A small, dark mass quickly descends upon me. I stumble as the skin of my cheek splits open, dropping the phone to the dirt. I can barely make out the wings of a predator bird, swooping above me in slow circles. It bellows another cry as I hold out the gun, hoping it scares it off. It doesn't. It seems to agitate it, swerving toward my neck faster than I can blink. I narrowly avoid talons to the throat as I snatch my phone and beeline towards the road. Maybe it was stupid to come out here, but I’m not stupid enough to think I have a chance of shooting it out of the sky.

I find my car where I left it, illuminated by the sedan’s lowbeams. Throwing myself into the seat, my phone vibrates.

“Paul, thank Christ. I-”

“Daisy?”

My brows knit. “Lori?”

Paul’s mother. Her tone, normally smooth and comforting, sounds tense. “I was calling to see if you’ve heard from Paul.”

“N-no. He should be at home with my dad.”

I could hear Lori pace across the linoleum floors of her kitchen. She went to say something, then changed her mind. “Daisy, where are you?”

“Off Garner Road. There was this guy who just-”

“Hold on, sweetheart,” Lori said. There was the sound of knocks banging on the front door. The door opens, and a woman’s voice is muffled. What I can make out is the unmistakable sound of sobs.

“Mrs. Peters…” Lori begins. “No, I haven’t…You said gone?... What…Okay, slow down. He can’t have gone far…We’ll look for him, just…” 

She trails off and shuts the door. 

“Lori, what’s wrong?”

The dread has spread throughout my body, seizing every nerve and cell. I’ve already started the car when she finally replies. “Daisy, I need you to head on home. Try to get in touch with your dad or Paul. I’ll get the kids and meet you there shortly.”

I swallow, my throat dry. “What’s happening? Are they okay?”

“I don’t know, honey.” Her voice cracks. It’s all I can do not to floor it to my house. 

The drive back is ghastly. The closer I make it to town, the more abandoned vehicles line the roads at random stops. They all have their doors wide open, just like the man I saw before.

As I near Sagauro’s residential area, I see women wandering by themselves or with their kids, calling out names with desperation.

“Ben?!” “Rodrigo?!” “Wallie, where are you?!”

I have to stop once I reach my neighborhood. The outcroppings of homes along the dirt roads are swarming with women, children, and pets. The front doors to many houses stand open. In front of me, a frail old lady hugs the cat on her lap as she sits on her front doorstep, while a boy grips his sister’s hand, who is crying inconsolably. I have no choice but to park the car. When I exit, a woman to my right is fuming, angry, and confused. 

“I can’t reach the police!” She cries to no one at all. “Why the fuck aren’t they answering?”

My fear ignites, and I take off running. With each house I pass, each open door I see, I force myself to go faster. My brain doesn’t understand what’s happening, but my heart has caught on to something terrible. My feet slap against the pavement hard and fast as I round the street into my cul-de-sac. I can see Lori with her kids on the lawn, waiting for me. I lock eyes with the kids, who look to me with hope. The hope dissolves when they realize I’m alone.

That confirms it. Paul isn’t here. And if Paul isn’t here, then Dad is…

Lori rises to her feet and calls my name, but my head is spinning so fast. Round and round like a carousel. My door is open like the rest of them, but I rush in anyway, scouring the house.

“Dad!!” I check every room and every hall. I don’t stop until I crash into Lori, who keeps me upright in her arms.

“Daisy, honey, he’s not here.” She says, a tear sliding down her cheek. I stare ahead and feel the ground sink under my feet. 

In the shadows by the door, right where I missed it, is an empty wheelchair.

I know within my soul that neither Paul nor my father is coming home. And as Lori would soon tell me, they’re not the only ones.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

I like to cook, especially for friends. My idea of an amazing time is sitting around in my back yard, drinking cocktails with friends, eating good food and laughing.  
I have ADHD, I deal with depression sometimes, but it's not crippling. It's just a thing I live with.

It gave me back some faith in humanity, or at least in women.

This afternoon I was reading a book (yes, I’m one of those people) while drinking my coffee. I’d been sitting there a while when I suddenly felt a wet spot between my legs. Yeah, you got it, my period. Two fucking weeks early. At this point, I should add I was wearing a white dress, which I had bled through, and I even stained the chair. I guess I was visibly freaking out because the barista came over to ask what was wrong and saw what was going on right away.

Let me tell you, that girl was an angel. Not only did she give me her sweater to tie around my waist, she took me to their break room and gave me a tampon. Then she went and cleaned everything up, took her break, and brought me new underwear, pants, and a top from the store across the street.

I mean what the fuck. This was a complete nightmare scenario, and I left that place smiling. I couldn’t get over how kind she was and I just wanted to shout my good vibes into the ether. Sometimes it's easy to forget that most people are good people.

As someone who thrives on a steady caffeine supply, this 12-cup coffee maker quickly became my trusted kitchen companion. The straightforward design, coupled with its user-friendly features, convinced me after only a few days that it was built for both simplicity and efficiency.

**Design and Build: A Classic Look Meets Everyday Utility**  
The aesthetic of this coffee maker leans heavily into practical simplicity. Finished in sleek black, it complements most kitchen setups without screaming for attention. At 11.76 inches deep and 13.8 inches tall, it doesn’t hog counter space, leaving room for my assortment of coffee mugs and sugar canisters. Despite its lightweight 3.6-pound build, it sits sturdily on my counter, even when filling the carafe or adjusting the removable basket filter. Its compactness makes it perfect for smaller kitchens or offices, while its classic, no-frills design appealed to my love for minimalism.

**Performance and Brewing Experience**  
The real magic here is how the Mr. Coffee SK13-RB brews rich-tasting coffee consistently. Whether prepping for an early morning meeting or hosting guests, I’ve brewed everything from a single cup to the full 12 without noticing a drop in quality. The Grab-A-Cup Auto Pause is a lifesaver. No more awkward hovering by the machine—I can steal a quick pour before brewing finishes and still have the appliance resume without a hitch. This feature has been indispensable when I’m rushing out the door or simply need that first sip ASAP.

**Advantages**  
- Brew-strength consistency for both small and large batches.  
- Cord storage helps keep the counter organized.  
- Grab-A-Cup Auto Pause feature is incredibly functional.  
- Lightweight construction makes relocation or cleaning hassle-free.  

[Want Mr. Coffee SK13-RB? Discover the price on Amazon.](https://cookwareoutlet.com/p/b002yi2ig0/)  

**Hassle-Free Maintenance and Cleaning**  
Cleaning gadgets is one of my least favorite chores, but this coffee maker makes it surprisingly easy. The removable basket filter lifts out smoothly, sparing me the annoyance of struggling with stuck parts. Add to that the frustration-free packaging it came in, and it’s clear someone put thought into not just how the product works but how it fits into a user’s broader daily life.

**Negatives**  
- The fully plastic body, while lightweight, doesn’t feel as durable as pricier models.  
- Water refilling requires careful pouring to avoid minor spills.  

**Mr. Coffee SK13-RB vs. the Competitors**  
I’ve used mid-range drip coffee machines, but comparing this model to similarly priced alternatives, it holds its ground remarkably well. Competitors like the Hamilton Beach coffee maker offer stainless steel finishes, which some may prefer for longevity. However, neither beats the SK13-RB’s Grab-A-Cup feature. If you’re after something straightforward and don’t need programmable bells and whistles, the Mr. Coffee stands out both in ease of use and reliability. On the downside, some competitors provide slightly larger carafes, which might suit heavier coffee drinkers.

**Price Performance**  
The affordability of this coffee maker can’t be overstated, especially given its ability to churn out consistent, tasty coffee daily. While simpler in feature set compared to high-end machines, the value is where it shines. For anyone who’s hesitant about overspending on a gadget with endless programming options they’ll rarely use, this model strikes the perfect balance of cost-effectiveness and function.

1mk9v10,https://i.redd.it/urqsb6pqhnhf1.jpeg,"Unique, Regional Items On Amtrak’s Mardi Gras Line Menu","If you plan to travel on Amtrak’s new Mardi Gras rail service, the official menu provided by Amtrak includes a number of novel items that most people outside the local region may not know. The following is meant to offer context for those that are curious.

The Muffuletta Sandwich  
The muffuletta was invented by Sicilian immigrant Salvatore Lupo, the owner of Central Grocery on Decatur Street in New Orleans. Back in 1906, Salvatore sold all sorts of ingredients that came by boat from the old country to the wharves near NOLA’s “Little Palermo” section of the French Quarter. He sold cheeses, dried Italian meats, olive salad, and a large, curved-top Italian roll to hungry Sicilian farmers who sold their produce at the French Market.  

As the journey back to their farms would take hours by horse-drawn wagon, the farmers complained about the difficulty of eating the items separately while guiding their wagons. This gave Salvatore an idea: a sandwich that combined all the ingredients into an easy-to-eat package. Thus was born the “muff”or, in the affectionate terminology of a first-born American immigrant from Sicily, the muffuletta, meaning “cute little mushroom-shaped guy.”

Pralines  
A New Orleans praline is a localized version of a candy snack created in France during the 17th century and named after César, the former Duke of Choiseul, Count of Plessis-Praslin. The original version called for coating individual almonds in caramelized sugar; however, almonds do not grow in Louisiana. When French settlers brought this recipe to the colony, they adapted it by using abundantly available pecans instead of almonds, adding cream and butter to the sugar, creating a unique version which is similarly sweet to fudge but thin like a cookie and chock full of pecan nuggets.

The Moon Pie  
Another Southern snack with origins in the early 1900s as a working man’s lunch is the Moon Pie. Created originally by a bakery in Tennessee at the request of a coal miner in Kentucky, the idea was to offer a snack food that was “as big as the moon.” Consisting of two graham cracker cookies sandwiching marshmallow and coated in chocolate, the Moon Pie was being produced in the hundreds by 1929. Given its large size and small price (just a nickel), Moon Pies and RC Cola became emblematic of the Depression in the South, as you could have both for just a dime.

Moon Pies & Mardi Gras  
Originally rooted in European pre-Lenten Christian festivals, Mardi Gras (Fat Tuesday) was brought to North America by French settlers and evolved locally in places like Mobile and New Orleans. The first Fat Tuesday in the territory was a modest celebration held in 1699 by French explorer Pierre Le Moyne d’Iberville, who led a voyage to discover the mouth of the Mississippi. However, the first true Mardi Gras (in the form of a community celebration, with feasting on rich foods in anticipation of Lenten fasting) took place in 1703, roughly 24 miles north of modern-day Mobile at French Fort Louis overlooking the Mobile River.  

Over time, Mardi Gras celebrations in Mobile, New Orleans, and other nearby communities grew to include parades throwing glass bead necklaces, wooden doubloons (coins), and even boxes of Cracker Jacks as gifts to festival-goers. But concerns regarding injuries led to the adoption of throwing comparatively soft, individually packaged Moon Pies to the crowds. This trend began in Mobile in the 1950s but quickly expanded to other places in the region where there are Mardi Gras parades, including New Orleans.

Zapp’s  
Zapp’s Voodoo Chips are crisp, kettle-cooked potato chips known for their unique seasoning and Cajun-inspired flavor. Zapp’s originated in Gramercy, Louisiana (between Baton Rouge and New Orleans). Ron Zappe, a former oil-field equipment manufacturer, went into the chip business due to the 1980s oil bust, which hit Southern Louisiana pretty hard.  

Zapp’s Voodoo Chips were accidentally invented when someone in the kitchen spilled a mix of salt, vinegar, barbecue, and jalapeño seasonings onto a batch of chips, resulting in a somewhat explosive and distinct Cajun flavor. Now made in Pennsylvania, Zapp’s have been toned down to be palatable to the wider American chip-eating masses (who are used to less flavoring), but still retain something of their Cajun bite.

Community Coffee  
Community Coffee is a family-owned coffee brand from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, with over 100 years of history. Often referenced as the “American Classic” medium roast, it’s known for being a smooth and well-rounded blend. Using high-altitude coffee beans selectively harvested to bring out a delicate and sweeter flavor profile, Community’s regular blend has notes of vanilla and cocoa. Consumers note that this blend is more distinct and traditional compared to brands like Folgers, with a less bitter, more mellow coffee experience.

Abita Beer  
Abita Amber Lager is a Munich-style amber lager brewed using pure, unadulterated artesian spring water from Abita Springs, Louisiana. Made from pale and caramel malts and German Perle hops, this beer features a smooth, malty, slightly caramel flavor with a rich amber color and is 4.5% alcohol by volume. This has been Abita Brewing’s flagship beer and is very popular in New Orleans and Louisiana.

Chandelier Lil Smack IPA  
Marketed as a light alcoholic beverage for the fishermen of the Mississippi Gulf Coast, this beer is from the Chandeleur Island Brewing Company of Gulfport, Mississippi. Somewhat fruity and slightly hazy, this beer is 6.5% alcohol by volume and rates at 69 on the bitterness scale, with hops as the main focus. ""Lil' Smack"" refers to Lil' Smack Channel, where Chandeleur Island charter fishing boats typically anchor.

The Hurricane Cocktail  
Invented in New Orleans during World War II at Pat O’Brien’s bar, the Hurricane is a strong, sweet, and fruity alcoholic beverage made primarily from rum. The war made whiskey scarce, but rum (which is made by fermenting sugarcane) was cheap and abundant. The classic Hurricane recipe typically includes rum, lemon juice, grenadine, and simple syrup. The drink is shaken with ice and poured into the hurricane-lamp-shaped glass, garnished with a cherry and an orange slice.

If you are traveling on the Mardi Gras Service to New Orleans, our shop will be offering bike tours which depart directly from the station, as well as from our French Quarter home at 223 Dauphine,  just around the corner from Bourbon Street. If you would like to learn more about what makes New Orleans so special, we invite you to join one of our small-group tours.

Left side is current stack. I take 5g of creatine a day (tried 10 first day but got a headache). I take 10g of collagen but might go down to 5 as taking about 3 to 4g of pills for a week honestly seemed to be helping my skin/complexion very quickly. Unsure if placebo.
I started on 25mg of zinc a day but now take every other day.
My omega 3 drink comes with 1250 of EPA+DHA, plus 1000iu of D3, but I take another 1000ui of D3 pill. Should I keep the bottle of fish oil in the fridge? I hear that helps.
The magnesium bisglycinate seems to give me a relaxed focus usually but definitely does not make me tired.
I take most of my supplements with my first meal, and take creatine + collagen with a mid day smoothie (with whey! Not pictured lol)

Right side I'm not taking. I bought the fish oil drink and pills at the same time figuring I'd just try both but then read fish oil becomes bad after a few months, wondering if I should return the big bottle of pills or take it after my drink is gone in 40ish days.

The melatonin+L-theanine I've only taken a few times but it never seems to help or do much and might make me groggy the next day. Even if I take only half.

Considering adding: Boron. K2 once I reorder D3. Zinc with copper once I reorder that. Also I think I heard one of the supplements I take means I should also take calcium but I forget which and why.

One thing I noticed is I think I'm sensitive to literally everything. 50g of coffee or half a small cup is all I need to feel good, any more and I get jittery and anxiety. Some random game me a large the other day I only drank a quarter of it a day for 3 days then threw out the last quarter. So I feel like I should stick to around the minimum of what people thing is a beneficial range. Hence 5g creatine. 1250 fish oil, 2000 d3, 25mg zinc every other day etc.

Sorry this is long but I'd love some feedback on it. When to take them, if I should increase or decrease anything, or remove something, and what else I should consider adding for my goals.

Thanks a bunch!

1mk9umy,https://www.reddit.com/r/managers/comments/1mk9umy/being_miserable_and_a_bully_at_work_is_tolerated/,Being miserable and a bully at work is tolerated if you make the boss gold,"I'll tell you about my experience with the miserable of the story: The sales manager. Although, I warn you, in this story, there’s more than one.

Donald (the sales manager) started in the company a year ago, turns out he was fired from his previous company for his attitude probably, and he landed here because he got an offer - of course, he had to make sure we all knew he got offered the position and did not look for it - Arrogance having a big entrance the first day. Wow He basically sounded, from the start, pretty much like a daddy's boy who never received his approval.

He's in charge of selling the product; the product is finished, but since day 1 he felt like he had to put his nose into everything because he's self-centered and he knew best - I did not know he had education in marketing and engineering to teach lessons- its rather offensive Lol but “he did” - he had a masters in Google search, AI and espionage. Anyway, you can imagine he did not respect anyone who held any of these positions, and was coming with his google search done two minutes before teaching you the lesson. 🧐 hmmm and with no shame. Do not teach if you Are not the sharpest knife in the kitchen, Donald.

He has been undermining colleagues in meetings - colleagues with plenty of experience in their fields- and especially women. He could not stand dealing with women managers this man… insecurity, thats all it is. Not to mention the constant hostile comments he made towards foreigners. Or his dubious ""professional ethic”, as he shamelessly copied competitors.

Apart from his obvious arrogance and disrespect, we have had so many problems with him because he oversells the software, and then, the rest of the team has to make up for it. He promises unrealistic functionalities we don't have (and that are not even discussed with the head of tech) for of course, his commision (one is not a vulture without reason lol)and then what happens, happens: misalignment with the head of tech, problems with big boss and internal turmoil. “Ohh what did I do? The team is not efficient enough. Why dont we outsource the team. Lets use AI”? - he does not realise his job could be outsourced as well because he lacks international experience needed for the job - but this is another story.

When we have group meetings and the CEO passes the word to him, saying: “Now Donald will talk about sales department”, he corrects him in front of everyone, saying it's the commercial department speaking. LOL An awkward silence ensues, this happens every time, and you see the boss thinking, this guy is an idiot. Challenging the CEO in Public whose ego also reaches planet Mars? Bad move. Thats not the way, Donald. These moments are priceless, it happens every time haha the daily bread. I’m Sharing with you a story rather funny.

As his egocentrism reaches unsuspected levels, once he even included a PowerPoint caption for us (marketing and tech team) to understand his sales terms…since he said that: just as he didn't understand some tech terms, we might feel the same. LOL on top of that, he makes us all pay for his  ignorance; it's hilarious. This guy has such stories in not proper moments, that you wonder how he isn't ashamed to open his mouth - now I understand his father.

Comes every day to the office being miserable, treating everyone miserably and leaves to his wife and kids probably thinking he had an awesome day. Well done, Donald, you smashed it today! He is not a kid, he’s 47…maybe less, I have no idea, he looks 47, probably the cocaine. But oh well, the boss - how much learnings from big boss. I don’t blame him for whats coming now, how could he know he was dealing with master and commander?

Well, big boss has let it go since he needed Donald’s contacts and someone who served as both a clown and a scapegoat. Yes, after all, that daily disrespect from Donald can not be for nothing. But its surprising that he even let it go after the sales manager got a discrimination and harassment complaint, and this colleague was gone - fired- weeks after. I knew he was fucked up but not that he was heartless? Anyway, that was not an elegant move. Spoiler: this won’t end up well for the company. So well, after all, I still admire the guts to keep him there against all odds, but hey, its all about filling pockets at all costs, right? Its about making more money, right?

This is what he would call “lead by example” and show “appreciation”. I’m surprised, all these years leading teams, and still don't know how to discern between what you can and can't do as a boss? How dare you? Classy.

Pff and that poor sales guy is a scapegoat after all, and has two more newscasts left in the company, since half the team has complained about him. What a reputation this is getting in such a small city like this. Oops, I think he”ll have to start flying economy like everyone else. Not that I care, but he just brags about it in a Group of juniors who, of course, are too far from flying in first class lol Could someone be more pathetic and redneck? Do not think so.

Now I have the doubt, who is more miserable of the two? The miserable sales director (who after all is a pretender and nothing more than a provincial, a yokel) or the big boss who has allowed all of this?

I Wonder what happened with integrity and treating others with respect. In the end, they are right when they say that work culture and transparency are non-existent in some companies. We believe people will act with integrity in certain situations, but lets stop being that naive!! Work is not family and, if they are going to throw you under the bus, make sure you do it first and take pictures.

For some, is all about filling pockets to bursting at no cost. Others prefer to fight against injustices. If no one rebels against injustices, what kind of world are we leaving behind? To think about.

Moral of the story:

If you have a CEO like that, run away…because those bad practices eventually come to light and you may be involved in something you were not responsible for. You're going to get covered in mud without even leaving the house, and you do not want that. And, if you bump into a sales manager like Donald duck, avoid at all costs, but pay attention to his moves because first, he takes many false steps, and second because is giving you a lesson on office politics for free. And we all like free stuff.

Thanks for reading, managers of the world. Now I will have my first coffee of the day. I was just venting, but of course I would love to hear your stories.",8,1754595639.0,managers,6,0.79,False

1mk9pxs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNOLA/comments/1mk9pxs/unique_local_items_on_amtraks_mardi_gras_line_menu/,"Unique, Local Items On Amtrak’s Mardi Gras Line Menu","If you are coming to New Orleans from afar via Amtrak’s new Mardi Gras rail service (which departs from Mobile Alabama and points in between), the official menu provided by Amtrak for the new Mardi Gras service includes a number of novel items that most people outside the local region may not know. The following is meant to offer context on each:

The Muffuletta Sandwich  
The muffuletta was invented by Sicilian immigrant Salvatore Lupo, the owner of Central Grocery on Decatur Street in New Orleans. Back in 1906, Salvatore sold all sorts of ingredients that came by boat from the old country to the wharves near NOLA’s “Little Palermo” section of the French Quarter. He sold cheeses, dried Italian meats, olive salad, and a large, curved-top Italian roll to hungry Sicilian farmers who sold their produce at the French Market.  

As the journey back to their farms would take hours by horse-drawn wagon, the farmers complained about the difficulty of eating the items separately while guiding their wagons. This gave Salvatore an idea: a sandwich that combined all the ingredients into an easy-to-eat package. Thus was born the “muff”or, in the affectionate terminology of a first-born American immigrant from Sicily, the muffuletta, meaning “cute little mushroom-shaped guy.”

Pralines  
A New Orleans praline is a localized version of a candy snack created in France during the 17th century and named after César, the former Duke of Choiseul, Count of Plessis-Praslin. The original version called for coating individual almonds in caramelized sugar; however, almonds do not grow in Louisiana. When French settlers brought this recipe to the colony, they adapted it by using abundantly available pecans instead of almonds, adding cream and butter to the sugar, creating a unique version which is similarly sweet to fudge but thin like a cookie and chock full of pecan nuggets.

The Moon Pie  
Another Southern snack with origins in the early 1900s as a working man’s lunch is the Moon Pie. Created originally by a bakery in Tennessee at the request of a coal miner in Kentucky, the idea was to offer a snack food that was “as big as the moon.” Consisting of two graham cracker cookies sandwiching marshmallow and coated in chocolate, the Moon Pie was being produced in the hundreds by 1929. Given its large size and small price (just a nickel), Moon Pies and RC Cola became emblematic of the Depression in the South, as you could have both for just a dime.

Moon Pies & Mardi Gras  
Originally rooted in European pre-Lenten Christian festivals, Mardi Gras (Fat Tuesday) was brought to North America by French settlers and evolved locally in places like Mobile and New Orleans. The first Fat Tuesday in the territory was a modest celebration held in 1699 by French explorer Pierre Le Moyne d’Iberville, who led a voyage to discover the mouth of the Mississippi. However, the first true Mardi Gras (in the form of a community celebration, with feasting on rich foods in anticipation of Lenten fasting) took place in 1703, roughly 24 miles north of modern-day Mobile at French Fort Louis overlooking the Mobile River.  

Over time, Mardi Gras celebrations in Mobile, New Orleans, and other nearby communities grew to include parades throwing glass bead necklaces, wooden doubloons (coins), and even boxes of Cracker Jacks as gifts to festival-goers. But concerns regarding injuries led to the adoption of throwing comparatively soft, individually packaged Moon Pies to the crowds. This trend began in Mobile in the 1950s but quickly expanded to other places in the region where there are Mardi Gras parades, including New Orleans.

Zapp’s  
Zapp’s Voodoo Chips are crisp, kettle-cooked potato chips known for their unique seasoning and Cajun-inspired flavor. Zapp’s originated in Gramercy, Louisiana, when Ron Zappe, a former oil-field equipment manufacturer, went into the chip business due to the 1980s oil bust, which hit Southern Louisiana pretty hard.  

Zapp’s Voodoo Chips were accidentally invented when someone in the kitchen spilled a mix of salt, vinegar, barbecue, and jalapeño seasonings onto a batch of chips, resulting in a somewhat explosive and distinct Cajun flavor. Now made in Pennsylvania, Zapp’s have been toned down to be palatable to the wider American chip-eating masses (who are used to less flavoring), but still retain something of their Cajun bite.

Community Coffee  
Community Coffee is a family-owned coffee brand from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, with over 100 years of history. Often referenced as the “American Classic” medium roast, it’s known for being a smooth and well-rounded blend. Using high-altitude coffee beans selectively harvested to bring out a delicate and sweeter flavor profile, Community’s regular blend has notes of vanilla and cocoa. Consumers note that this blend is more distinct and traditional compared to brands like Folgers, with a less bitter, more mellow coffee experience.

Abita Beer  
Abita Amber Lager is a Munich-style amber lager brewed using pure, unadulterated artesian spring water from Abita Springs, Louisiana. Made from pale and caramel malts and German Perle hops, this beer features a smooth, malty, slightly caramel flavor with a rich amber color and is 4.5% alcohol by volume. This has been Abita Brewing’s flagship beer and is very popular in New Orleans and Louisiana.

Chandelier Lil Smack IPA  
Marketed as a light alcoholic beverage for the fishermen of the Mississippi Gulf Coast, this beer is from the Chandeleur Island Brewing Company of Gulfport, Mississippi. Somewhat fruity and slightly hazy, this beer is 6.5% alcohol by volume and rates at 69 on the bitterness scale, with hops as the main focus. ""Lil' Smack"" refers to Lil' Smack Channel, where Chandeleur Island charter fishing boats typically anchor.

The Hurricane Cocktail  
Invented in New Orleans during World War II at Pat O’Brien’s bar, the Hurricane is a strong, sweet, and fruity alcoholic beverage made primarily from rum. The war made whiskey scarce, but rum (which is made by fermenting sugarcane) was cheap and abundant. The classic Hurricane recipe typically includes rum, lemon juice, grenadine, and simple syrup. The drink is shaken with ice and poured into the hurricane-lamp-shaped glass, garnished with a cherry and an orange slice.

* bloating
* fatigue
* dry skin
* difficulty loosing weight
* no right side pain

Most of these symptoms have been able to be managed with a low-fat diet, regular exercise, and by cutting out coffee.

1mk9kv2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CATHELP/comments/1mk9kv2/discipline_idk_pls_help/,Discipline? Idk pls help,"My kitten is a little over a year old, she does things she recognizes she shouldn’t and I don’t know how to stop her. She has a cat tree and numerous cardboard scratching posts around the apartment but she insists on trying to claw at the wooden wall, we rent and that is kind of a no no. She also claws at the couches, she’ll get on top of surfaces like tables and tv stands to paw things off and break them. 

I realize a lot of it can be she wants something and is looking for attention but she does it when she has food and water, I’ll give her attention and pet her/try playing with her but she’ll get bored and leave just to go do the before mentioned things. She knows she shouldn’t and she’ll jump up on the coffee table and just stare at me waiting for an illicit reaction even when I try not giving one.

Previously mentioned discipline:

1.) Ole reliable spray bottle, I honestly think she prefers to lick the water off herself than to drink from her fountain, she sometimes does naughty things to be sprayed and will come back In 2 minutes to do it again in front of me. 

2.) Diluted vinegar solution for spray bottle, I read it’s safe and in concentrated amounts will only give a stomach ache, so I diluted it a bit but I honestly think she likes it, like a flavored water. She doesn’t react and will continue to do bad things. She also has broken many plants and pots trying to get to the ones we hid glue traps for gnats in, she smells it and seeks it out to lick the adhesive pesticide glue, so we can’t have plants anymore. 

3.) I used a shock collar meant for dogs, I don’t shock animals and I don’t believe in it, but it had a vibration and sound feature so I used those when she did things she shouldn’t, she didn’t do anything but look around confused as to where the sound/feeling was coming from. When it stopped she would get back to what she was doing waiting for it to happen again? I think she thought it was like another animal or something because she looked like she was laying in wait watching to see where it would come from. 

4.) I stuck her in a room alone and closed the door. I figured maybe it was attention seeking and if whatever attention I try giving her doesn’t work sticking her in a room alone would upset her, she just cried for the 5-10 minute period I stuck her in there and then when I let her out would go back to doing things to illicit reaction. 

5.) I kidnap her and swaddle her like a baby in a throw blanket, then hold her. She can’t move or get out of the blanket as her paws are wrapped, it’s usually only when we’re watching a movie or show, she cries like she hates it but retreats her head into the swaddle and her eyes will close a little bit like she’s about to nap, I think she wants to hate it but secretly likes it. I just can’t swaddle her all the time. 

She doesn’t care about tinfoil, she licks adhesive, and she’s smart enough to correlate things happening with her actions but just doesn’t care about anything that happens, like she thinks it’s more entertaining than the actual bad behavior she does. And if I don’t respond to what she does she keeps pushing until eventually something ends up broken. We have museum wax for some things but can’t keep everything glued down, we bought a bunch of plastic stickers to put on couches that we plan on sticking on the wall she scratches but she also claws at doorway frames. Nothing seems to actually upset/deter her from something and I need new ideas to try because I really don’t want her to keep fucking the apartment up or kill herself from licking chemicals like an idiot. We also have two other older cats who hate her, and she knows this but intentionally bothers them despite knowing they’ll try attacking her to correct her behavior, she really is just a shit stirrer. 

She has a cat tree, multiple cardboard scratching posts/beds, there are three different sleeping beds around the apartment, a water fountain, they graze feed, we have a catio, multiple toys of different varieties, catnip plants in the catio and dried stuff we sometimes put out. Shes absolutely infatuated with the laser though, I thought a 30$ high quality very bright laser (not strong enough to burn anything though) and I know it’s not supposed to be used for animals because they can never catch it and they start looking for the light all the time but it’s the only thing that she actually keeps her attention on and prevents her from doing bad things, but if I use it to keep her from doing bad she’ll correlate it and manipulate me into bringing it out constantly even if the battery is dead. 

Sorry for the long post, I just am at my wits end with her and need new strategies and ideas on maybe how to deter her from being a trouble causing shithead. The most important note is that I don’t really see or hear signs of her doing most bad behavior if we’re sleeping in the bedroom, nothing is ever moved or broken unless I’m asleep on the couch and not giving her attention she wants, if I’m not physically there she doesn’t do any of that stuff she just waits for me to come out or come home from work.",1,1754595018.0,CATHELP,1,1.0,False
1mk9k2p,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1mk9k2p/sf_funeral_punchline_a_dirk_strangelove_short/,"[SF] Funeral Punchline - A Dirk Strangelove short, Episode 1","Funeral Punchline

 

Dirk Strangelove stood in the rain like a statue that owed too many people money. The downpour sluiced off the shoulders of his greatcoat, pooling at his worn leather boots and whispering secrets through cracked gutters and rust-choked drains. His once-boyish face—now all jagged charm and weathered confidence—wore the kind of grin that promised a bullet or a snide quip, and not always in that order. Slick blonde hair clung to his age beaten brow, strands matted by rain and the long ghosts of better days. Beneath the coat, his left arm, from the elbow down—an old-style cybernetic prosthetic—remained hidden, humming faintly with idle diagnostics and crudely cobbled together repairs. His armour, patched but exquisitely built, spoke of a man who didn’t care to look new, only to survive. And tucked beneath his coat, resting snug in a leather holster engraved with faded blessings, slept an ornate flechette pistol—its grip inlaid with silver scripture of which, only he knew the meanings of, its barrel etched with tally marks that could’ve been kills, missions, or just long days where Dirk got bored.

Dirk Strangelove had been presumed dead before. Twice in fact, if you counted the time he fell into a synth-acid reservoir and reappeared three weeks later with a fresh tan and a new liver. But this was the first time the Ministry had gone through the effort of holding a funeral.

Rain sheeted down over Gallows Reach like guilt through a sieve. The city was a mistake too stubborn to collapse—half-occupied, half-condemned, and all the way bureaucratized. Every block had its own dialect of red tape. The pigeons were tagged, the beggars licensed, and the air carried a faint scent of printer ink and mouldy sanctions. Whole neighbourhoods had drowned in paperwork before water ever touched their boots.

Dirk stood beneath a flickering overhang across the street from the chapel, watching figures shuffle inside. It was a squat building, brick-coloured and windowless, with an electronic marquee that blinked through its own eulogy:

""DIRK STRANGELOVE – REMEMBERED IN SILENCE.""

“Silent,” Dirk muttered, lighting a green-glowing cigarette labelled Regalement Blend. It hissed faintly, like it disapproved of being smoked. He took a drag anyway and tapped ash onto the wet pavement. The nicotine burned like penance, a ritual more sacred than anything Gallows Reach had offered him lately.

He checked the address again. Correct. The time? Also correct. The fact that he was still breathing?

Apparently not relevant.

He took a slow breath and stepped into the drizzle, the acid rain sizzling faintly off the padded shoulders of his coat.

 

The funeral home looked more like a repurposed loan office. The kind of place where souls were itemized and grief came with a handling fee. The doors were automatic but too slow, so Dirk shoulder-checked one and muttered an apology to the sensor. It wheezed open anyway, like it had been expecting him.

Inside, the air smelled of old incense, burnt toner, and institutional regret. Soft dirges played from recessed speakers, occasionally interrupted by a static-laced Ministry jingle reminding citizens to double-check all Form D7 submissions. Dirk grimaced. The irony was chewy. He wondered if they had the gall to play that jingle during his ceremony.

A woman in a black uniform handed him a pamphlet as he entered. He didn’t take it. She didn’t insist. Her eyes glazed past him like he was a maintenance code scrawled in the wrong font.

He scoped the room.

Pews: half full. Faces: half familiar. A couple former Hunters, a supply clerk he once slept with, and what looked like a synthetic grief consultant trying too hard to cry. A young couple in the front row leaned against each other in vague confusion, whispering. Dirk kept his hood low and slid into the back row, sitting heavily like someone who expected the seat to collapse under the weight of misplaced grief.

The casket sat at the front. Closed. Sealed with red Ministry wax, stamped and certified. That wasn’t standard. Not unless they didn’t want anyone checking. Not unless someone had something to hide.

At the podium stood a man Dirk recognized immediately: Grint. Former requisitions officer turned funeral director. Looked like someone had wrung him out and forgot to iron him. His suit fit like a last-minute apology. He tapped a screen on the lectern and cleared his throat with all the enthusiasm of a man reading his own performance review.

“Dirk Strangelove served with moderate distinction, demonstrated passable courage, and expired during service to the Reach.”

Dirk chuckled, low and bitter. ""Moderate distinction? That's generous.""

A woman two rows ahead turned, squinted, then looked away quickly. Must’ve thought she imagined it. He didn't blame her. Most people didn’t like seeing ghosts before the coffee was served.

The service dragged on. A data-eulogist appeared in the form of a flickering projection beside the casket. The voice was smooth, masculine, vaguely sympathetic. It read from a rotating script of approved phrases.

""We celebrate the dedication of a man who never let protocol obstruct his purpose…""

""He will be remembered, as all Hunters are, in operational logs and mandatory grief metrics.""

""Please consult your grief counsellor before adjusting your morale score.""

A drone passed overhead, its lens irising open with a soft chirp as it scanned the attendees. Dirk tilted his head, held his breath. The drone hovered briefly over him. Beeped. Then moved on.

It didn’t recognize him. Or it had been told not to.

He leaned forward slightly, squinting at the wax seal. Red, unbroken, pressed with the sigil of the Ministry of Mortality Oversight. The mark of an unquestioned death. Not something they gave out lightly. And never to a Hunter whose file hadn’t been triple-verified.

The mark of a cover-up.

 

After the ceremony, attendees were directed to a side room labelled “Communal Grief & Refreshments.” Dirk waited until the crowd had filtered away—nobody lingered long, not for him—then rose and moved silently down a side corridor behind the altar.

The hallway was too clean. Too orderly. Too... deliberate. The lights buzzed overhead with the slow certainty of institutional decay. A maintenance drone with one broken leg skittered past him, dragging a cable like a leash. Its display flashed ERROR: MAINTENANCE LOOP DETECTED.

Dirk ignored it.

The prep rooms smelled worse. Bleach and despair and synthetic regret. He passed cold drawers with toe tags printed in bulk. One drawer hung ajar, labelled ""HUMAN EFFLUVIA (UNSORTED)."" A box of cremation dust sat on a nearby cart, its label peeling: Generic Hunter Template. A form-filler bot snored softly in a corner, its ink cartridge dripping onto the floor, one arm mid-stamp.

Then: voices, quiet, just on the edge of comprehension.

He hesitated outside a door with a frosted-glass window that read RECORDS. The light inside flickered like a nervous eye. He peeked through the crack.

Grint was there, hunched over a terminal, furiously tapping keys akin to maniacal strokes of an organist on the edge. The screen flashed red. Denied. He cursed under his breath, checked a secondary panel, tried again. Denied.

Dirk didn’t knock.

He pushed the door open with a slow creak.

Grint looked up—and went pale.

“You’re… you’re supposed to be dead!”

Dirk stepped inside, shut the door behind him and flashed him one of those cheeky grins.

“Yeah? And you’re supposed to be competent. But here we are.”

Grint backed into a filing cabinet, fingers twitching as if searching for an excuse he hadn’t filed yet.

“This—this isn’t what it looks like.”

Dirk grabbed the nearest data-slab. His name. His ID. A digital death certificate. Stamped. Approved. Filed under D7-Priority Clearance. Witness field: blank.

He opened a drawer. Requisition slips. All marked ‘ASSETS RECYCLED.’ Ration cards. Weapons licenses. Implants. Faith chits. All reissued using IDs flagged as deceased.

Dirk turned slowly. “You’ve been declaring Hunters dead and redistributing their gear.”

Grint swallowed. “It’s a clean system! We only use IDs flagged inactive. It’s efficient. Sustainable!”

“You buried me to balance the books.”

Grint raised his hands. “The system isn’t perfect. But no one notices. No one cares.”

“I noticed.”

There was a pause. A long one.

Then, from behind Dirk—

Click.

The distinct sound of a greasy, yet well maintained flechette pistol being cocked.

Dirk didn’t turn. He sighed. “Tell me that’s not the organist.”

“It is,” Grint said quietly. “He’s also our crisis manager.”

Dirk turned. Slowly.

The organist—now wearing combat gloves, a hardened grimace, and the gleam of someone who moonlighted as a hymnal hitman, raised the gun with practiced familiarity. Behind him, a shelf of unused hymnals glowed softly with synth-ink prayers.

Dirk grimaced. “I hate funerals.”

The man fired as Dirk dropped.

Glass shattered behind him. Dirk rolled, grabbed a casket dolly, and launched it toward the shooter. The organist stumbled backward, colliding with the lectern. Dirk grabbed a metal urn from the table and flung it like a discus.

It hit the man in the neck.

He crumpled, gurgling hymnals.

Dirk stood, breath ragged.

He turned to Grint, who was already trying to slink out the side.

“I think we need to talk,” Dirk said, reaching for his sidearm.

Dirk gave chase as Grint bolted. He may be old, but Dirk still had the sprightly step of a track athlete on all manner of illicit substances, of which, Dirk was.

Grint wasn’t fast, but panic gave him a kind of slippery momentum, like an eel soaked in tax fraud. He crashed through a swinging bulkhead door labelled ""ADMINISTRATIVE SANCTUM – STAFF ONLY"" and bolted down a narrow corridor lined with mismatched floor tiles, flickering lights, and file cabinets that groaned like dying priests in confession. One cabinet tipped slightly as Grint brushed it, dislodging a stack of requisition forms that fluttered in his wake like bureaucratic feathers.

Dirk followed at a steady pace, flechette pistol gripped loosely, boots slapping against a floor that had clearly been mopped with something more acidic than water, the soles hissing as he went. His coat flared with each step, trailing smoke and a faint chemical tang. Overhead, aging light panels stuttered between working and not with each passing second, casting Dirk in a strobe of menace, even the lights weren’t Dirk’s friends.

“Grint!” he called, half-laughing, half-snapping. “If I have to run, someone’s paying by the hour!”

The corridor abruptly ended at a service hatch; its metal frame buckled slightly from age or fury. Grint dove through it with the grace of a frightened bureaucrat, thudding against the far ladder before disappearing into the dark below. Dirk reached the edge just in time to hear the clang of feet hitting rusted rungs.

He sighed. “Of course it’s a ladder, never a nuclear escalator when you need one”

Grumbling, he swung over the edge and began the descent.

 

The sublevel was colder. Older. Forgotten. It felt like stepping into the city’s memory—a memory soaked in toner and left to rot. Faint emergency lighting pulsed along the walls like a dying heartbeat, washing everything in dim red tones. Filing cabinets stood in rows, some wrapped in ancient plastic tarps, others buckled open like broken jaws. Everything was damp. Everything smelled like wet cardboard, old skin, and burned apologies.

A sign overhead read: MORTALITY STORAGE – DO NOT REPROCESS WITHOUT FORM 83C.

Dirk’s boots hit the floor with a splash, and he caught a glimpse of Grint stumbling into an open archive room ahead. The man disappeared behind stacks of crates marked with various labels: HUNTER ASSET – STALE, NON-CITIZEN CHIT SURPLUS, UNCONFIRMED REMAINS. Dirk followed, slowing now, his senses stretching out.

The archive was cavernous—an ossuary of lost paperwork. Crates towered to the ceiling. Bins overflowed with faded dossiers, death declarations half-shredded and reassembled, faith requisitions stamped with obsolete sigils. Overhead pipes dripped steadily onto a floor already slick with mildew and failure. The hum of ancient ventilation echoed faintly like a machine trying to forget.

Grint sagged into a chair in the centre of the room, panting, arms limp. He looked like a man who had finally realized the extent of his crimes—and that his exit strategy had expired years ago.

Dirk entered slowly, pistol lowered but still visible.

“You know,” he said, “when I said we needed to talk, I didn’t mean in a crypt full of retired bureaucracy.”

Grint wheezed, clutching his ribs. “You weren’t supposed to see this.”

Dirk raised an eyebrow. “Because I was supposed to be dead?”

“Yes! You were declared! Signed, sealed, processed! Everything aboveboard!”

Dirk circled a crate, running a finger along the dusty lid. “Except the part where I’m breathing. Bit of a sticking point.”

Grint’s shoulders sagged deeper, like gravity had finally remembered him.

“It started small,” he muttered. “Unclaimed gear. A few inactive IDs. Nobody questioned it. Then we found a way to fast-track the system. Flag a few Hunters as dead. Submit the forms. Collect the assets. Reroute the gear into supply chains. Sell the excess to... unofficial outlets.”

“Like black market enforcers. Or worse,” Dirk said flatly.

Grint flinched. “It wasn’t like that at first. We only touched IDs that hadn’t pinged back in months. Then someone submitted yours.”

Dirk stepped forward, gaze narrowing. “Who?”

“I don’t know! The request came from Central. A G-class override. No name, no trace.”

“Bullshit.”

“I swear,” Grint said, voice cracking. “Your file was pulled. It passed three checks. I thought you really were dead.”

Dirk stared at him, pistol steady, tension crawling into his fingers. The air in the archive thickened, silent and judgmental.

“And you just… went along with it.”

Grint nodded miserably. “I buried the paperwork. Not the man.”

Dirk raised the gun slightly. “The paperwork’s still talking.”

A new voice cut in from behind a stack of crates:

“That’s because it hasn’t finished processing.”

Dirk spun, weapon up, hammer cocked.

A figure stepped into view, deliberate and calm. She wore a Ministry-grey longcoat crisp with pressed authority, a badge gleaming on one lapel, and a stun baton hanging from a belt that bristled with legal threats.

“Hello, Strangelove,” she said, her voice smooth as static. “We’ve been monitoring this little funeral farce for a while. It’s just… unfortunate you decided to attend it.”

Dirk’s aim didn’t waver. “Ministry Oversight?”

She smiled faintly. “Worse. Inventory Control.”

She stepped forward slowly, boots echoing against metal grates. Her eyes gleamed with the cold certainty of someone who had never filed a form incorrectly in her life.

“You’ve interfered with a sanctioned salvage protocol. You’re unauthorized, unregistered, and—technically speaking—deceased. Which means, legally, I can put you in the ground without triggering a single disciplinary form.”

Dirk fired.

She moved fast—faster than expected, as fast as those cyber freaks—and ducked behind a cabinet as the flechettes ripped through outdated shelving units. Paperwork exploded in a cloud of obsolescence; centuries of forms reduced to confetti. A red strobe flared in the ceiling.

Alarms screamed to life. A voice shrieked from unseen speakers:

“UNREGISTERED ACTIVITY DETECTED IN MORTALITY ARCHIVE. PLEASE INITIATE END-OF-LIFE PROTOCOLS.”

Dirk ducked behind a crate labelled RATION LOG – TERMINATED, coughing through the dust.

“This is how you handle inventory errors?!”

The woman returned fire—her baton crackling with energy and launching a bolt of stunning static. It splashed across the floor, scorching it black and melting part of a Form 12 stack into sludge.

“This was supposed to be clean,” she hissed from behind cover. “Nobody even liked you!”

“Mutual!” Dirk barked back. Fucking Ministry oversight.

Grint, forgotten in the crossfire, tried to crawl toward a side door, but the woman spotted him. With no hesitation, she hurled a stapler across the room. It struck him in the temple with a thunk and dropped him like a failed audit.

“Grint was sloppy,” she called. “You? You’re just inconvenient.”

Dirk levelled his pistol, squeezed the trigger—and heard the click.

Nothing. Empty.

He stared at it for a second, incredulous. “Right. Forgot to resupply after the monastery shootout,” he muttered, as if remembering an unpaid bill. “Classic.”

The woman was advancing now, baton whining with pent-up voltage.

Dirk’s hand dipped into his coat. He pulled out a prayer bead—charred black from overuse, glowing faintly at the seams. A crackling relic of desperate faith, equal parts explosive and bad idea.

“You’re gonna love this part.”

He hurled it.

The explosion was small but potent, faith-charged and poorly blessed. Shelves buckled. Fire sparked. Lights shattered. The woman flew backward with a shriek and slammed into a row of caskets labelled READY FOR DISPOSAL.

Dirk ran.

He sprinted through the darkened corridor, heart pounding, lungs burning from a heady cocktail of dust, ozone, and bureaucratic negligence. The archive behind him howled with fire and klaxons, echoing like a dying cathedral built out of filing cabinets and prayer forms. Papers fluttered down in his wake like bureaucratic ash, burning softly as they met flame. Somewhere in the distance, a fire suppressant system coughed once, wheezed a final warning in monotone, and promptly gave up.

He burst through a reinforced door into what looked like a cremation overflow chamber. The lighting here was worse: a sickly, strobing green cast from half-dead fluorescents that blinked in rhythmic agony. Dozens of rusted incineration units lined the walls, each bearing a different state of disrepair—some with doors half-ajar, others blinking ERROR, PROCESSING or just HELP in slow, hopeless digital pleas. The air was thick and cloying, a heady blend of scorched prayers, melted laminate, and decades of dried-up solemnity. A faith-soaked mausoleum for logistical sins.

Behind him, the hatch burst open with a hydraulic gasp. The Inventory Control agent stepped through the smoke—bruised, bleeding, but unbroken. Her grey coat was scorched at the hem, and one sleeve dangled in shreds, but her baton still hissed with violent energy. Smoke curled from her shoulders like ceremonial incense, and her eyes burned—not with righteousness, but with bureaucratic wrath. She was vengeance wearing a barcode.

“Strangelove!” she bellowed, her voice amplified by some internal modulator. “You’re unregistered, unclaimed, and unimportant!”

Dirk ducked behind a broken trolley stacked high with empty urns. They rattled ominously as he landed. He peeked out, grinned, and called back, “Don’t undersell me. I’m also uninsured.”

She hurled a static bolt. It smashed into the trolley, detonating it in a blossom of ceramic dust and ash. The urns shattered like brittle lies. Dirk rolled sideways, coughing, and snatched a heavy coil of braided incense wire from a wall hook. Without hesitation, he flung it like a weighted net. It wrapped around her legs. She fell with a curse and a clatter but yanked free before he could close the distance. Her baton surged again, snarling blue light.

“This is your last audit!” she screamed, stumbling to her feet.

Dirk seized a nearby cart and upended it. A stack of unlabelled urns spilled across the floor like the most tragic game of jacks ever played. One shattered at his feet. The ashes within hissed as they met the small fire licking its way along the back wall.

“You bureaucrats and your paper firetraps,” Dirk muttered, then, with a little theatrical flair, kicked the remains into the open flame of an active incinerator

The fire jumped like it had been waiting for permission.

In seconds, the wall ignited. A pipe—either gas or embalming fluid, or some hybrid horror—burst overhead. A gout of pressurized chemicals sprayed across the ceiling and caught flame with a whoosh that drove both combatants momentarily to cover.

The agent shrieked in frustration and backpedalled, slipping in the slick pooling on the floor. She caught herself against a metal rail, hair now lit at the tips like a candlelit vigil

""System overload,"" chimed a speaker in a voice that tried to be helpful but sounded deeply amused. ""Combustion imminent.""

Dirk turned, scanning for exits, when he spotted Grint—somehow still alive, crawling in through a secondary hatch with the determination of a bureaucrat desperate to salvage a pension. His face was bloodied, eyes glassy with panic. Dirk considered leaving him, then cursed and crossed the room, ducking as sparks rained from a shorting fuse box.

He grabbed Grint by the collar and yanked him up just as the cremation chamber’s backup generators kicked in with a roar. More fires blossomed. Alarms howled. Sprinklers activated and promptly sprayed embalming foam. Everything ignited again.

Dirk dragged Grint toward the emergency exit—a metal door blackened by smoke and heat. The security terminal next to it blinked an apathetic red. ACCESS DENIED. Its fingerprint reader was cracked. Its retina scanner was melted.

Dirk grunted, holstered his pistol, and shoved his left cybernetic hand into the panel.

The terminal sparked violently, the lights dimmed—and then, with the pained groan of something realizing it had failed its purpose, the door hissed open just enough to admit a fleeing Hunter and a semi-conscious embezzler.

Dirk kicked it the rest of the way.

 

Outside, the storm had grown biblical. Rain pelted the alley like shrapnel from a divine bureaucracy. Thunder rolled across the skyline like a slow-moving audit. Dirk stumbled through the exit, every inch of him steaming, soaked, or smoking. Grint slumped beside him, unconscious again. Dirk propped him up against a rubbish bin labelled CONFIDENTIAL DISPOSAL and took a moment to breathe.

Behind them, the cremation wing of the funeral home gave a final, exhausted groan. Then came a dull whump as the backup fuel reserves caught. A fireball surged into the sky, turning the building’s roof into a violent candle.

Somewhere within, a printer continued spitting out Form D7s into the flames.

Dirk wiped soot from his mouth, dug into his coat, and retrieved one last Regalement Blend. He lit it with a shaky thumb, took a drag, and watched the glow flicker in the reflection of the blaze.

Grint groaned, dazed. His eyes fluttered open to see the inferno.

1mk9hm2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/1mk9hm2/my_spanish_crosstalk_adventures_across_europe/,My Spanish “Crosstalk” Adventures Across Europe,"I have been learning Spanish through comprehensible input, mostly via Dreaming Spanish, and I’ve logged 225 hours so far. During a recent trip around Europe, I finally tested my skills in real conversations. Here are the most memorable moments and what I took from them.

🇨🇴 1. Colombian Professor at Vienna Airport

At the Vienna airport, while waiting for my bus, I met a Colombian woman who needed help with the coffee machine. We started chatting, and I learned she was a Spanish professor at the University of Pennsylvania.

We talked for almost an hour. She didn’t slow down unnaturally or switch to English, and I followed about 80–85% of what she said without translating in my head. It felt natural and was a big confidence boost.


🇻🇪 2. Venezuelan Guy in Zagreb

In Zagreb, I met a Venezuelan guy who spoke very quickly, especially with his girlfriend. When he looked directly at me, I could follow the general meaning. Without eye contact, or when overhearing their conversation, I caught words but couldn’t follow the thread.

This made it clear that being spoken to directly is far easier than listening to two natives talk to each other.


🇨🇱 3. Two Chilean Girls and the Spanish Walking Tour in Split

At my hostel in Split, I met two Chilean sisters who said they were going on a Spanish-language walking tour. I asked if I could join them. I had never done a walking tour in Spanish, but it sounded interesting. Honestly, I probably wouldn’t have gone if it weren’t in Spanish.

After I booked, we took an Uber to the beach and spent the afternoon together speaking in “crosstalk” style — I spoke in English, they replied in Spanish. It worked surprisingly well. They said they were speaking a little slower, but it still felt natural. When I spoke Spanish, I was limited to present tense and very basic structures, which meant I couldn’t express myself as fully as in English.

In the evening, we went to the walking tour. The guide spoke at a natural pace, and I understood about 60% of what he said. Sometimes I’d check by summarizing in English to the sisters, and they confirmed I was correct.

One of them rated my accent as 8/10, or 5.5/7 in Chilean terms. Apparently they rate things out of 7 in Chile, which I found charming.


🇩🇪 4. Another Spanish Walking Tour in Berlin

Encouraged by Split, I joined another Spanish-language tour in Berlin. This was harder. The guide spoke faster, and without the Chilean sisters to confirm my understanding, I had to rely entirely on my own comprehension. I still caught about 60–65%.

I spoke to a few people who didn’t know English, explaining in Spanish why I was learning, where I was from, and how long I was staying.

A funny moment came when I forgot the word “semana” (week) while talking to an older Argentinian man. I stayed in Spanish and said, “En un mes hay cuatro… ¿qué?” He immediately understood. That reminded me that even without the exact word, you can still get your point across.

We chatted a bit about his family and business. It was a small but memorable interaction I wouldn’t have had in English.


🧠 Key Takeaways
	•	Being spoken to directly is much easier than overhearing native conversations.
	•	Crosstalk (English in, Spanish out) is an effective, low-pressure way to practice.
	•	After 225 hours of comprehensible input, I can follow native-paced speech and have basic conversations, though my speaking is limited to simple structures and mostly present tense.
	•	Confidence matters more than perfection. I wasn’t afraid to make mistakes or ask for repetition.
	•	You can work around forgotten words by describing them. People will usually understand.


🎯 Conclusion

This experience left me genuinely excited to keep learning Spanish. I can’t wait to get home and put in more hours of comprehensible input so I can understand even more. I used to think my Spanish was too dysfunctional to be useful, but spending a day with people who could speak naturally, without having to constantly filter their language for me, and still being able to understand and engage with them, was an amazing feeling. It made me realize how powerful this method is.

I’ve been enjoying the process and now I’m seeing measurable results that I can actually feel in conversations. It’s such a contrast to when I learned German through traditional methods. Back in 2020, I spent 10 days volunteering on a farm in the Austrian countryside with a woman who spoke almost no English. I had decent speaking ability, a lot of vocabulary, and could say what I wanted in basic terms, but my listening was poor. I couldn’t understand her most of the time, and at family gatherings I felt excluded, unable to follow what was being said. It became awkward for both sides.

If I had to choose between being able to speak fluently but not understand, or understand well but speak very little, I would choose understanding every time. This trip confirmed that comprehension is the foundation that makes real connection possible.",4,1754594815.0,dreamingspanish,1,1.0,False
1mk9gdg,https://i.redd.it/hpztpiizenhf1.jpeg,Mardi Gras Line Menu Revealed,"Here is the official menu provided by Amtrak for the new Mardi Gras service that will be running between New Orleans and Mobile, Alabama.

There are a number of novel items on this menu that most people outside the regional area may not know so the following is a little background for context on each:

The Muffuletta Sandwich  
The muffuletta was invented by Sicilian immigrant Salvatore Lupo, the owner of Central Grocery on Decatur Street in New Orleans. Back in 1906, Salvatore sold all sorts of ingredients that came by boat from the old country to the wharves near NOLA’s “Little Palermo” section of the French Quarter. He sold cheeses, dried Italian meats, olive salad, and a large, curved-top Italian roll to hungry Sicilian farmers who sold their produce at the French Market.  

As the journey back to their farms would take hours by horse-drawn wagon, the farmers complained about the difficulty of eating the items separately while guiding their wagons. This gave Salvatore an idea: a sandwich that combined all the ingredients into an easy-to-eat package. Thus was born the “muff”or, in the affectionate terminology of a first-born American immigrant from Sicily, the muffuletta, meaning “cute little mushroom-shaped guy.”

Pralines  
A New Orleans praline is a localized version of a candy snack created in France during the 17th century and named after César, the former Duke of Choiseul, Count of Plessis-Praslin. The original version called for coating individual almonds in caramelized sugar; however, almonds do not grow in Louisiana. When French settlers brought this recipe to the colony, they adapted it by using abundantly available pecans instead of almonds, adding cream and butter to the sugar, creating a unique version which is similarly sweet to fudge but thin like a cookie and chock full of pecan nuggets.

The Moon Pie  
Another Southern snack with origins in the early 1900s as a working man’s lunch is the Moon Pie. Created originally by a bakery in Tennessee at the request of a coal miner in Kentucky, the idea was to offer a snack food that was “as big as the moon.” Consisting of two graham cracker cookies sandwiching marshmallow and coated in chocolate, the Moon Pie was being produced in the hundreds by 1929. Given its large size and small price (just a nickel), Moon Pies and RC Cola became emblematic of the Depression in the South, as you could have both for just a dime.

Moon Pies & Mardi Gras  
Originally rooted in European pre-Lenten Christian festivals, Mardi Gras (Fat Tuesday) was brought to North America by French settlers and evolved locally in places like Mobile and New Orleans. The first Fat Tuesday in the territory was a modest celebration held in 1699 by French explorer Pierre Le Moyne d’Iberville, who led a voyage to discover the mouth of the Mississippi. However, the first true Mardi Gras (in the form of a community celebration, with feasting on rich foods in anticipation of Lenten fasting) took place in 1703, roughly 24 miles north of modern-day Mobile at French Fort Louis overlooking the Mobile River.  

Over time, Mardi Gras celebrations in Mobile, New Orleans, and other nearby communities grew to include parades throwing glass bead necklaces, wooden doubloons (coins), and even boxes of Cracker Jacks as gifts to festival-goers. But concerns regarding injuries led to the adoption of throwing comparatively soft, individually packaged Moon Pies to the crowds. This trend began in Mobile in the 1950s but quickly expanded to other places in the region where there are Mardi Gras parades, including New Orleans.

Zapp’s  
Zapp’s Voodoo Chips are crisp, kettle-cooked potato chips known for their unique seasoning and Cajun-inspired flavor. Zapp’s originated in Gramercy, Louisiana, when Ron Zappe, a former oil-field equipment manufacturer, went into the chip business due to the 1980s oil bust, which hit Southern Louisiana pretty hard.  

Zapp’s Voodoo Chips were accidentally invented when someone in the kitchen spilled a mix of salt, vinegar, barbecue, and jalapeño seasonings onto a batch of chips, resulting in a somewhat explosive and distinct Cajun flavor. Now made in Pennsylvania, Zapp’s have been toned down to be palatable to the wider American chip-eating masses (who are used to less flavoring), but still retain something of their Cajun bite.

Community Coffee  
Community Coffee is a family-owned coffee brand from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, with over 100 years of history. Often referenced as the “American Classic” medium roast, it’s known for being a smooth and well-rounded blend. Using high-altitude coffee beans selectively harvested to bring out a delicate and sweeter flavor profile, Community’s regular blend has notes of vanilla and cocoa. Consumers note that this blend is more distinct and traditional compared to brands like Folgers, with a less bitter, more mellow coffee experience.

Abita Beer  
Abita Amber Lager is a Munich-style amber lager brewed using pure, unadulterated artesian spring water from Abita Springs, Louisiana. Made from pale and caramel malts and German Perle hops, this beer features a smooth, malty, slightly caramel flavor with a rich amber color and is 4.5% alcohol by volume. This has been Abita Brewing’s flagship beer and is very popular in New Orleans and Louisiana.

Chandelier Lil Smack IPA  
Marketed as a light alcoholic beverage for the fishermen of the Mississippi Gulf Coast, this beer is from the Chandeleur Island Brewing Company of Gulfport, Mississippi. Somewhat fruity and slightly hazy, this beer is 6.5% alcohol by volume and rates at 69 on the bitterness scale, with hops as the main focus. ""Lil' Smack"" refers to Lil' Smack Channel, where Chandeleur Island charter fishing boats typically anchor.

The Hurricane Cocktail  
Invented in New Orleans during World War II at Pat O’Brien’s bar, the Hurricane is a strong, sweet, and fruity alcoholic beverage made primarily from rum. The war made whiskey scarce, but rum (which is made by fermenting sugarcane) was cheap and abundant. The classic Hurricane recipe typically includes rum, lemon juice, grenadine, and simple syrup. The drink is shaken with ice and poured into the hurricane-lamp-shaped glass, garnished with a cherry and an orange slice.

If you are traveling on the Mardi Gras Service to New Orleans, our shop will be offering bike tours which depart directly from the station, as well as from our French Quarter home at 223 Dauphine,  just around the corner from Bourbon Street. If you would like to learn more about what makes New Orleans so special, we invite you to join one of our small-group tours. Alternatively, you can rent bikes from us and explore New Orleans on your own terms.

1mk9gbl,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForSmallInvestors/comments/1mk9gbl/i_sold_my_home_lost_the_money_and_failed_my_first/,"I sold my home, lost the money, and failed my first businesses. Here's how I bounced back","Day 2 of 365 – \[Turning point\]

This will be a longer post but maybe it's what you need for today:)

After I sold the apartment and spent the money, I had to move back to my hometown with my family. That was hard. Not just because we failed, but because we had to face all the people who warned us not to do it. The “I told you so” energy was everywhere.

At the same time, deep down, something kept telling me that I couldn’t stop. That I had to figure out how to make money. I didn’t want to work a 9-to-5 job forever. I knew that wasn’t for me. That same year, I got my first client in a new social media agency I started. I had no real experience. I just knew how to use Canva and had the guts to make an offer someone couldn’t refuse. There was no ChatGPT back then, no automation tools. It was all manual. But it was mine.

I had my first experience running a business during university. A family member who was abroad had opened a small café, and I was the one managing it while he handled the funding. That business didn’t last. It was a clear failure. But looking back now, I’m actually grateful for it. I had no idea how anything worked, not life, not business. I made a lot of stupid mistakes, but that’s how I started learning. It was the first time I saw what it actually takes to run something, even a small local place. At the time, it felt like a disaster. Now, it makes me smile.

My first real business wasn’t dropshipping or crypto. It was something a bit more structured. I found three people, we trusted each other enough to become partners, and we all put in the same amount of money to try Amazon FBA or something like that, I honestly don’t even remember the exact model anymore. What I do remember is that it was the first time I ever invested real money into something. It wasn’t a success, but it gave me a serious reality check about how hard business actually is. And that lesson stuck with me more than any course ever could.

The need to find income didn’t come from inspiration. It came from pressure. I’ve lived in a family where money was always tight. Where working too much led to stress, sickness and depression. So I started searching like crazy. I believed all the wrong gurus, watched tons of videos, bought into the hype. But between all the noise, there were also quiet messages that made sense. Like “stay consistent, not perfect,” “put in the work,” “don’t quit after two tries,” and “real business happens over coffee.” I used to laugh at that last one, but now I believe it fully.

I tried dropshipping. I tried day trading with crypto. Even looked at affiliate marketing, but felt it was too technical for beginners. Now I think anything can work, as long as you’re honest about how long it takes and you stop thinking you’ll get rich overnight. Or even next year.

Nothing happened suddenly. My agency grew slowly. I learned marketing by doing it. I started offering more services and earning more. After a year, I was finally making more from the agency than I was from my job. That was the moment I quit 9-to-5 and went full-time on my own thing.

That small business taught me how to sell, how to talk to clients, how to understand value and how to keep going even when results are small. It also led me to burnout, but that’s for another post.

Somewhere along the way, I learned about European funding. Not from a course or a program. From a person. A real conversation over coffee. That person helped me apply and I received 50,000 euros in funds. Now we’re working on a second project for another 50,000. If there’s one thing I know for sure now, it’s that connections matter. Show up. Talk to people. Be open. Don’t wait to be perfect. Just start.

Today, I understand something I didn’t know back then. Money is not everything. Projects take time and dedication. That’s something I try to apply daily in everything I do. I don’t chase results like I used to. I’ve started to enjoy the work through the small milestones I set for myself. That’s my little philosophy, and maybe it helps you too.

1mk9gbb,https://i.redd.it/4io6ld2zenhf1.jpeg,"Who Spilled the Beans, or Soybeans, about the McBees' ???","I liken what is going on here with the investigation to the situation on Real Housewives of New Jersey with the Guidice's. Teresa was paying for $100K+ worth of furniture by peeling a bunch of bills from a big wad of cash on camera. It got people talking. 

With the McBee's, I have to consider that Calah talking about Jr. sending her $10,000 and $20,000 couldn't help but draw attention and raise eyebrows. They talk about their crippling debt in every episode. But they go off to buy a bunch of buffalo. They buy the cattle with the really long horns.  So too, there is all the McBee's talk about 5 family-owned businesses, the outstanding loans, the big multi-million dollar business deal Galyna was trying to land, the countless number of homes for a business so much in debt.  

There an the endless supply of expensive vehicles that get loaned out to different girlfriends and destroyed. We get told about a $7,000+ repair bill for Masha's brutally bashed vehicle. Steven Sr. had the colossal crashed and trashed truck he loaned Brooke at the shop to repair, ostensibly at his expense. The new Coffee Carwash venture must have cost a pretty penny as a start up. They have multiple homes. Sr. has ""the lodge"" and the Nashville house. Allie and Jesse just finished their ""city house"" and have the house near the farm. We saw Jr. and Calah at the home on or near the ranch and the large condo. The cars, the homes, the loans, and the cattle purchases all cost money they claim not to have. Whether that money is paid out in a large outlay of cash initially, in installments, or in monthly payments, it appears to be an incredibly large some of money being spent month-to-month. All of this must draw considerable attention and raise red flags for government entities asking questions. 

Moreover, the McBees seem to draw negative attention from their small town and townspeople as we saw when they arrived at the car races. I wouldn't doubt it if one of them started asking questions and put a McBee Bee 🐝 in someone's bonnet about possible shady things going on with them. 

So I wonder whether there are other people to blame for dropping a dime to the authorities besides just the Jilted and Jealous Galyna and Calah. The Toxic Twins of GallaTin may have had help.

Is the transition from aforementioned Express Impress machine to Touch Impress worthwile in terms of the ease of brewing ligher roasts?

At first I have transitioned from the auto Philips/Saeko machine to Breville Barista Max VCF152x. 

I have figured out that it was just a rebrand of the Sunbeam company, and the product did not had the same quality which I would be familiarized with under the original Sage/Breville brand.

After acquiring Sage Barista Express Impress, espresso brew making have vastly improved, as the water tank no longer smelled like a chemical vat, there was no under machine water leaking and the grinder grinded finer and more consistently.

I understand that the general idea advised here is to buy just a simple espresso making machine and invest in a good grinder.

I have bought the aforementioned machine under the premise that my household members would have no issues in making considerably consistent espresso shots in ease. 

Now after I have bought new, fresh light roast beans I have arrived at some issues.

The shots are really difficult to pull off, and it feels like the machine has a lot of problems in getting the water through.

I have internal grinder settings set at 3, and external at 10 to 12, as these are the only settings compatible with these beans.

Previously I have used external grinder settings at 3 to 4 with dark beans and the coffee poured more consistently under the same pressure.

Now, regardless of what basket I use - pressurized or unpressurized, I am met with acidic and generally unwell coffee shots, which are not in a drinkable state.

My question is, the transition from Sage/Breville Barista Express Impress to Touch Imppress worthwile in the ease of pulling off consistent espresso shots at ease from lighter roasts?

Lots of off/on, unfortunately, due to unfortunate previous relationships. Our friendship always stayed strong though. 

I moved in a few months ago. Our relationship in a whole is wonderful. He cares, shows it in little things like making me coffee and deliberately spending time with me even when I think he doesn't realize I notice. He is the person I want to spend my life with.

Now he has lots of sexual trauma. A previous relationship of his involved lots of manipulation sexually. I also have a lot of sexual trauma and was abused sexually in the past. Unfortunately this feels like it's caused a rift between us. I don't feel attractive or desirable to him and he hasn't touched me in about a month. We haven't had a lot of sexual contact, it was essentially once a week and then nothing.

I've tried to express how painful it has felt to me, although I know he isn't interested in anyone else and I know there is a lot of external stress going on. (For example: Money, Generalized State of the world.) We've discussed it in a way, but his response feels like a *""You're always horny. We don't have to do it every time.""* but all I want to scream is ""Then why haven't you touched me in over a month?"". It's gotten to the point that I'm not even aroused any more. It's just nothing.

I want to compromise, come up with a solution together, but as much as I tell him it feels like it goes in one ear and out the other. I don't want to make him feel obligated. I've been aware of myself and not pushing myself onto him. It just feels like I'm getting nowhere.

Is there another way I can explain this hurt to him? Some way I can ask for a compromise without sounding like a jerk? He is very polarized in his thinking, and I don't know how to explain I want a collaborative effort from him without causing conflict.",1,1754594307.0,boyfriends,1,1.0,False

1mk983b,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeRigged/comments/1mk983b/reveal_if_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker/,Reveal if the Best Single Serve Coffee Maker Keurig K50 Lives Up,"If you're like me and mornings feel incomplete without that perfect cup of coffee, the Keurig K-50 has been a game-changer in my routine. This coffee maker doesn’t wake me up with a jarring beep, but it sure perks up my mornings with a rich, hot brew in under a minute. I’ve tested it day after day, and while it nails the basics beautifully, there are a few quirks that stood out. Let’s dive into my experience testing it—and see if it’s the right fit for your kitchen.  

**Design and Build Quality**  
At first glance, the machine has a simple and robust design. The Keurig K-50 fits snugly on my counter without hogging too much space, which is appreciated given my small urban kitchen. The black finish feels classic and universal, blending well with other appliances. It’s made of plastic, yes, but has a solid build that doesn’t feel flimsy or cheap. Cleaning it is straightforward too, thanks to its removable reservoir and drip tray, though I wish the machine came in a slightly wider variety of color options to suit different kitchen aesthetics.  

**Ease of Use and Operation**  
Every time I use this coffee maker, it’s evident how well-designed the interface is—just a few buttons to select your brew size (6 oz., 8 oz., or 10 oz.) and that’s it. No learning curve at all. This simplicity is great on groggy mornings when the last thing I want to fiddle with is complicated settings. I’ve had friends and family over, and even those unfamiliar with single-serve brewers had no problem whipping up their coffee in under a minute. One sweaty summer afternoon, a coworker tried it out and joked, “Even I can’t mess this up!”  

[Check Keurig K-50 price on Amazon.](https://raifords.com/p/b018uq5ams/)  

**Performance and Brewing Quality**  
Here’s where this coffee maker shines. It doesn’t matter if you prefer a strong 6 oz. brew or a lighter 10 oz. option; the flavor consistently comes through. The rich aroma fills the room while it brews, giving those intense café vibes. I tried a variety of K-cup pods—everything from Green Mountain to Starbucks, even a sneaky hot cocoa for my niece—and each came out wonderfully. The machine doesn’t struggle with different grind sizes, though I noticed reusable pods sometimes needed a bit of extra care to ensure proper brewing. I appreciated that the auto-off feature kicks in after two hours of idle time; great for someone like me, who often forgets to turn things off.  

**Capacity and Convenience**  
The removable 48 oz. water reservoir was a highlight for me. With the ability to churn out over six cups before a refill is needed, my mornings became way less chaotic. Whether it’s just me at home or I’m serving coffee for guests, this feature saves so much frustration. However, I did feel the need to monitor the water level closely, as forgetting to top it up once led to the dreaded blinking light of doom when I least wanted it.  

**Descaling and Maintenance**  
Descaling sounds fancy but is basically scrubbing out calcium deposits that naturally build up. This model makes it clear you need to do this (some subtle blinking lights remind you). I took a weekend to descale it, and the instructions were easy enough to follow. No one enjoys maintenance chores, but this didn’t feel like a hassle—and trust me, I’m lazy with this stuff.  

**Benefits**  
- Brews quickly and delivers consistent flavor.  
- Easy to operate with minimal setup.  
- Large water reservoir means fewer refills.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Lacks advanced customization options found in more premium models.  
- Plastic build may not appeal to those seeking metal or more luxurious finishes.  
- Noisy while brewing, which might wake others if you're brewing coffee at odd hours.  

**Competing Products**  
Comparing it to options like the Nespresso Vertuo or other drip coffee machines was an interesting exercise. The Nespresso, for example, has a more premium feel with its pods and offers greater customization in drink lengths. However, it’s pricier and lacks the vast coffee selection available with K-cup pods. On the other hand, traditional drip coffee makers—like the Cuisinart models—are excellent for serving larger groups, but they lack the single-serve focus which makes the Keurig so convenient for solo users or smaller households. I’d say, where the K-50 fits in perfectly is for users who crave speed, reliability, and versatility in coffee choices.  

**Affordable Quality**  
For its price point, this coffee maker makes a compelling argument. You get speed, convenience, and quality coffee at a fraction of what some fancier machines demand. If you’ve ever considered skipping that daily coffee shop run, the savings here can be significant. Sure, the machine lacks advanced tech or steaming options, but given its core focus, I think it delivers strong value without compromising where it matters.

I’m doing better but still not really out of the woods as far as pain. I also have a 2 year old at home with me and my husband is off for one more week. 

Anyway, my mom watched my 2 year old while I was at the hospital, it was a disaster, she called me basically crying 3 hours after my procedure saying this was “too hard for her” and he “won’t go to sleep”. Like okay? You raised 4 kids, put on a movie and relax with him… then the rest of the time she just didn’t do anything fun with him, sat at home, ate takeout, which was not the plan. She also initially mentioned staying another night and making dinner for us when we got home, but she ended up rushing out the second we got there (like within 5 minutes) and our house was a disaster. Since then she has stopped by once for coffee, but that’s it. 

My dad and stepmom were annoyed that I asked my mom to watch my son, so they purposely planned a trip out of town during the birth, didn’t really check in. I sent photos and they replied here and there by text, but still have not reached out to meet the new baby. 

My MIL insisted on coming into town, even though I said no 5x she steamrolled and got her way. Stayed with us for a week when I was 2 weeks postpartum.

Didn’t help with laundry, didn’t help with anything other than taking my toddler outside to play a handful of times. And essentially every time I was done nursing she would ask to “hold the baby” so I could do this or that (shower, nap, go for a walk) but this literally wasn’t needed, as my husband is also here… the whole purpose in her coming out was to spend time with our toddler so he gets more attention, and help out with cooking and cleaning, obviously meet the new baby. But not to snatch him away anytime I don’t have my boob in his mouth. 

Also - my husband now assumes that since I’m not taking the Tylenol for pain anymore, and I’m able to get out of bed, that I’m just “healed” and back to normal. So has stopped getting up at night with me and the baby. 

Anyway, am I being dramatic? Like I’m annoyed and honestly upset by these things. But want to know if I’m being unreasonable and hormonal. ",4,1754593899.0,beyondthebump,6,1.0,False

It’s not worth it.,"I don’t know what possessing me to admit this after all this time, until about five years ago, I had a job for a few years that would have me traveling around the country. Las Vegas Los Angeles, and smaller cities down to Peoria, Illinois and some random place in Alabama I don’t remember the name of. I went to dozens of cities. 

I was 19 and still operating on a teenage sense of world hate, so I would do the pettiest and most disgusting shit to make sure I left the hotel room in a worse state for the next person to walk into it. 

Some of the worst things I did included, unfolding a fold out bed removing the included sheet pissing all over the mattress and letting it dry over the weekend with the windows open. When I left, I put the sheet back on folded it up. Visually you couldn’t tell anything had been done, and there wasn’t a smell until you got up and close with it. The next person who slept on that mattress, absolutely huffed piss all night. I would leave other fluids on pillows then put the pillowcases back on. And would just generally piss and *other* things on random points around the room where I didn’t think it would be noticed. 

Another thing I frequently did, was bring the complementary installed coffee filter in with me whenever I needed to take a shit. I would do my “check wipe” with that one and if it was clean, put it back into the coffee machine. I occasionally would put the spout into my taint or my armpit after I hit the gym. So the coffee is just ruined whether or not you change the filter. 

At one point, I considered taking a shit inside the AC unit, but I couldn’t figure out how to get it open. I probably did more that I can’t even remember, but I was in a different hotel in a different city every weekend for a few years straight. If you’re reading this from a hotel room right now. There’s a decent chance I stayed there. Don’t drink the coffee.

I have no idea why I was angry as I was back then, but I was operating on some reverse flash level pettiness. ",0,1754593260.0,confession,32,0.22,False
1mk8shv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mk8shv,"Schloss Schauenstein ***, Fine Dining in a Fairy Tale Castle","From the moment you arrive at Schloss Schauenstein, you know the experience will be special. The restaurant/hotel is located in a picturesque castle in Fürstenau, Switzerland, tucked between the Swiss alps. 

Upon arrival, we were greeted and whisked upstairs to one of their lounges to enjoy aperitifs. Things started strong with a selection of Dom Perignon champagnes and several small bites while we decided which of their menus to go with: 
1. Cauliflower with Lemon and Trout Roe
2. Kohlrabi rolled up with Ponzu
3. Croustade with fried onion and mustard
4. Leek tartelette with tarragon
5. Nori crunch with tartare and nasturtium

We ended up choosing the longest menu (a deceptively long 5 courses) with both supplement options (about $40 USD each). As you will see, it ended up being a LOT of food. 

The next 2 dishes were brought to us at the same time. Artichoke “Taco” with tarragon and an artichoke soup. The soup was extremely rich and comforting, while the tacos contrasted this with vibrant flavor and texture. 

We then were moved into the main dining room. This is where our main courses would finally arrive (or so we thought). We were then presented with 4 more amuse bouche dishes, each large enough to be considered a regular course at most fine dining restaurants. 

First was a dish with celery, jalapeño sorbet, and white unripe strawberries. The jalapeño added the tiniest amount of spice and beautifully counteracted the sourness of the strawberries. 

Next, whitefish with brown butter and salted apricot. The brown butter was added as a foam on top of the fish, and completely coated each bite in an incredible velvety texture. 

After that was one of my favorite dishes of the meal. A humble salad made with greens including fennel, shiso, and radish. If I could describe the experience at schauenstein in 1 word, it would probably be “layers”. Each dish is comprised of meticulously crafted components which work together in harmony to not only make every bite extremely tasty, but also a completely new experience. I felt like this dish best represented that philosophy, with each green in the salad being treated with the utmost respect, turning a simple salad into an extraordinary dish. 

Last of the amuse bouches, balls made with rice flour, similar to mochi. This was coated in carrots and cream cheese and a sauce which I believe contained tomato. Still a strong dish, but the weakest of the 4 starters for me. 

Things quickly picked up again as we received our bread and moved into the first “real” course. The bread was a potato bread, and came with several types of butter to choose from. 

Now for the first main course, a beautiful display of pikeperch, peas, and lettuce served alongside another savory sorbet and more pickled vegetables. 

Next was our first supplementary dish: langoustine served 3 ways. First was the tail, fried and in a rich, foamy sauce. Next, a dumpling in broth. And finally, langoustine tartare served beneath a citrus foam. Each preparation was mind-blowingly delicious. 

Our second course was white asparagus cooked various with beurre blanc and morel, served alongside pickled white asparagus. 

Next was char with variations of beetroot and gooseberry. Similarly to the last dish, this wonderfully showcased their mastery and ability to find so many purposes for a single vegetable.

Our final savory course was lamb, cooked 2 ways. The first was presented with wild garlic and gremolata. The second, slow cooked, was reminiscent of barbecue and served with yogurt to cut through the intense richness. Absolutely delightful. 

After the final savory dish, we were presented with a choice. For our second supplement dish, we could either have a savory cheese course, or a sweet pre-dessert. I chose to go with the cheese, which I would recommend anyone else who is planning on going to do as-well. This was probably the most glorious cheese spread I’ve ever seen in a fine dining restaurant, and an absolute must-order at Schloss Schauenstein. Served alongside the cheese are various charcuteries, spreads and preserves, and even potatoes, as well as a fried classic Swiss accompaniment (not pictured). The sweet pre-dessert, on the other hand, featured a cold sorbet component alongside a fried donut. 

Our final dessert was a fitting end to the meal. 3 dishes served alongside eachother, with rhubarb being the common theme. First, a hot souffle, next to a frozen sphere, and a plated dessert of rhubarb, yogurt, and sorrel. 

We headed back to the lounge to finish with Mignardises and revel in the food coma that we had been placed in. The Mignardises included: 
1. Macaron with chocolate 
2. Fig malt
3. Coffee “beignet”
4. Chocolate “pear”
5. Marzipan almond (not pictured)
6. Chocolate praline

And that was it. Schloss Schauenstein ended up being 1 of the top 5 meals I’ve ever had. Seriously, almost every dish was a masterpiece, and I cannot recommend this place enough. It was a lot of food though, and I highly emphasize to make sure you don’t make the same mistake we did and book dinner afterwards at another restaurant on-property. This might’ve been the most filling meal I’ve ever had. ",32,1754593237.0,finedining,10,0.94,False

These embellishments are typically made from high-quality materials like resin, polymer clay, or even hand-stitched felt, ensuring durability and adding a touch of artistry to the design.

**High-Quality Base Hat Material**

Beyond the embellishments,the base hat material plays a crucial role in the overall quality and feel of the accessory. The best espresso martini hats utilize premium materials such as wool felt, soft velvet, or durable cotton blends. These materials not only provide a pleasant fit but also contribute to the hat's structural integrity,ensuring it maintains its shape and withstands regular use. The choice of material also influences the hat's aesthetic, with wool felt offering a classic and refined look, while velvet provides a more luxurious and plush feel.

**secure and Comfortable Attachment**

The method of attaching the espresso martini embellishments to the base hat is another key consideration. High-quality hats employ secure and discreet attachment methods, such as strong adhesives, reinforced stitching, or hidden wire frameworks. These techniques ensure that the embellishments remain firmly in place,even with movement or handling.Moreover,the best hats prioritize comfort by ensuring that the attachment points are smooth and unobtrusive,preventing any irritation or discomfort to the wearer.**Adjustable Sizing and Fit**

A well-fitting hat is essential for both comfort and style, wich is why many top espresso martini hats offer adjustable sizing options. These adjustments can be achieved through internal drawstrings, elastic bands, or even removable sizing strips. This allows wearers to customize the fit to their head circumference, ensuring a snug and secure feel without being too tight or restrictive. Adjustable sizing makes these hats more versatile and accommodating for a wider range of users.

**Lightweight Construction for Extended Wear**

Wearing a hat for an extended period can sometimes become uncomfortable if the hat is too heavy. The best espresso martini hats prioritize lightweight construction to minimize fatigue and maximize comfort. This is achieved through careful material selection, minimizing the weight of the embellishments, and utilizing breathable linings.A lightweight hat is especially beneficial for events, parties, or any occasion where the hat will be worn for several hours.

**Durable and Easy-to-Clean Materials**

Given that espresso martini hats are often worn in social settings, it's important that they are made from durable and easy-to-clean materials. Look for hats that are resistant to stains, water spots, and othre common mishaps. Ideally, the materials should be easy to spot clean with a damp cloth or mild detergent. Some higher-end hats may even feature removable embellishments that can be individually cleaned or replaced if necessary, further extending the hat's lifespan and maintaining its pristine appearance.

Key features of the best espresso martini hats include:

   Detailed and realistic espresso martini embellishments
   High-quality base hat material for comfort and durability

1mk8m6e,https://www.reddit.com/r/PanicAttack/comments/1mk8m6e/still_having_increased_hr_after_quitting_nicotine/,Still having increased HR after quitting nicotine and caffeine,"My (34F) first ever episode was Jan 2025. One morning, my BP dropped to 63/37 and my heart rate shot up. I went to the ER and they did an Xray, EKG, and drew blood. All were fine and they sent me home.

Ever since then (about 6 months), I’ve been having panic attacks. The first couple lasted for hours (and were really scary), but more recent ones only like 10 minutes. Some weeks I’d have them everyday, some not as often.

I started taking half a Benadryl to lower my HR and it seemed to help. I do also get acid reflux which I learned can cause similar symptoms so I usually also took 10mg Famotidine and 2 Tums. I would usually also lay on the floor or bed with my feet higher than my head. I’ve slept with a wedge pillow for about a decade. 

I thought for the longest time I developed POTS. Every time I had a panic attack, it seemed to be after I ate. After I ate acidic foods, specifically orange juice or tomato-based foods, or after I ate a lot of carbs. So I reduced those in my diet. 

One month ago, I was feeling like I did back in January. HR was going up to 140 (and I took 3 halves of Benadryl which weren’t helping) so I left work and went to Urgent Care. They did an EKG and told me it was just tachycardia and I went home. 

That day I quit vaping and drinking coffee cold turkey. I was drinking coffee everyday and I had been vaping for a year (I smoked for a year prior to that). That same day I noticed my resting HR dropped from 70s to 50s. It being so low made me paranoid but I read it was normal.

It’s been a month, and for a few weeks I had absolutely no anxiety at all. Thought my panic attacks were gone for good. But in the past few weeks I’ve had a few. None are as bad as they used to be and they don’t last as long as they used to. They don’t scare me as much as they used to, I was so afraid I was dying before but now I just lay down and breathe and distract myself until they pass. 

So now I’m trying to figure out what’s still causing them. I quit nicotine and caffeine so it’s not that. They seem to happen every time I need to use the bathroom. Not so much #1, but especially if I need to go #2. My HR will rise when I feel the urge, and will slowly come back down afterwards. It’ll get worse if I’m constipated. I will also sometimes wake up around 2-3 AM hot and sweating, needing to use the bathroom, and my HR will be elevated. 

Is this still a symptom of nicotine and caffeine withdrawals? I did read that could last for around 3 months or so. Am I lactose intolerant? Even so, why is it causing tachycardia? I never had any heart related issues before January so this is a complete mystery for me. 

Any insight will be truly appreciated. Thank you for your time. 

(Edited to add a few details, and heat causing the panic attacks.)

Testing the Maud’s Super Flavored Coffee Pods Variety Pack (B08DQQVL1H) has honestly been a treat for my coffee-loving soul. With its 80 recyclable single-serve coffee pods and a stunning assortment of 16 flavors, this product turns drinking coffee into a delightful adventure. Ranging from classics like French Vanilla to more exotic notes like Caramel Macchiato and Coconut Cream Chocolate, I found myself looking forward to brewing each cup just to explore the next flavor. Not to mention, this medium roast blend is made from 100% Arabica beans, ensuring incredible quality with every sip. The solar-energy roasting process also adds an eco-friendly edge, which I personally appreciate.  

If you're someone who, like me, relies on their Keurig for that quick morning pick-me-up, you’ll love that these pods fit nearly all single-serve coffee makers! Practical, flavorful, and environmentally considerate—they seem to check a lot of boxes. 

[Check Maud’s Super Flavored Coffee Pods Variety Pack B08DQQVL1H price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b08dqqvl1h/)

**The Perks of Variety**

One of the best features of this coffee pod variety pack is the sheer diversity of flavors. I had relatives visiting recently, and the pack became an instant party starter. Some opted for the nutty Hazelnut Cappuccino, while others raved about the rich Cinnamon Churro. Personally, Cinnamon Churro might have stolen my morning coffee ritual’s heart, but it was incredible to have the option to try 15 other flavors! I also like that Maud's includes some exclusive flavors that you don’t typically find in other brands. Switching it up every morning kept the experience from getting monotonous.  

**Sustainability Matters**

Sustainability is important to me, so I was thrilled to learn that Maud’s is actively moving toward being carbon neutral. The pods themselves are made of 100% recyclable materials, which means no guilt as you enjoy your coffee. Having products that care for the planet without skimping on quality feels like a win-win. The solar-powered roasting adds even more green points to the product’s scorecard. Could I taste the eco-friendly care? Maybe not, but it felt good knowing it was there.

**Brewing in Style​

The pods work effortlessly with my Keurig machine, and the flavor extraction in each brewing process is just spot on. I’ve often encountered pods that fall short, leaving a faint coffee taste that barely holds up. With these, the balance of robustness and sweetness was noticeable with every cup I brewed. The medium roast strikes just the right tone—not too strong to overwhelm but rich enough to provide a flavorful kick. 

**Highlighting the Positives**

- Wide range of unique flavors for variety seekers.
- Uses 100% Arabica beans, ensuring premium quality.
- Compatible with almost all single-serve coffee machines.
- Eco-friendly manufacturing process with recyclable pods.
- Perfect for gatherings or solo coffee indulgence.

**Some Areas to Improve**

- Not all flavors are equally balanced; some might come off sweeter than others.
- Pods sometimes require a little extra push to fit perfectly into certain machines.
- Doesn’t cater much to those who prefer darker roast options.  

**Peer Products: How Does It Compare?**

When I compared this variety pack to other popular coffee pods, like Starbucks’ classic blends or Green Mountain’s offerings, the most significant competitive edge Maud’s has is its diverse flavor palette. Where competitors stick to a handful of mainstream options, Maud’s ventures into creative flavor profiles like Coconut Cream Chocolate, which you wouldn’t typically expect.  

That said, Green Mountain does lean heavily on sustainable practices too, but their pods are often not as smooth in terms of flavor consistency. Starbucks pods, on the other hand, are bolder and cater more to those who love strong coffee. Yet, they lack the eco-consciousness Maud’s embodies.  

**Cost Efficiency: A Fair Price for What You Get**

While prices fluctuate, I found this pack to offer good value for the features you get. Many coffee pods at this quality level often break the bank, but Maud’s variety pack seems to balance both quality and affordability. Between its premium beans and sustainable touches, the product does feel worth the investment. The added punch of being Kosher-certified and gluten-free widens its appeal even more, making it fit into many lifestyles.

Only about 25ml (1 oz.) a day but it’s a steady drip unrelated to use. 

I descale and clean this machine on a regular basis as recommended, and use only spring water or filtered tap water to make coffee. Its performance hasn’t dropped off. 

While it just might be a coincidence, I recently tried to make an Americano with ground Illy coffee (rather than my own grind). I also switched to the dual wall filter basket and was careful not to over-tamp the grounds. The machine pressurized as it normally would but it stalled before any coffee was extracted. Could this event have damaged a hose or fitting that is now leaking?

Has anyone had luck getting these machines repaired? I think it’s way too early for a well-maintained espresso machine to fail such that it can’t be fixed.

1mk8jbe,https://youtube.com/watch?v=NcDo-T4He3k&si=rkO1ukbsqALQfJ-i,13 The Two Pillars of Motivation: Intrinsic and Extrinsic,"I. The Two Types of Motivation

The source identifies two primary categories of motivation that drive human behavior:

* **Intrinsic Motivation:** This type of motivation originates from within an individual. It stems from one's personal identity, beliefs, and desires. As the source states, ""We're motivated to do something because of who we are, because of what we believe, because of what we want. It comes from within."" Examples include personal interest, enjoyment, and a sense of accomplishment.
* **Extrinsic Motivation:** This motivation comes from external factors. It involves engaging in an activity to receive an external reward or avoid punishment. The source lists ""things like money, like salary, like gifts, like presents"" as examples.

II. The Primacy of Intrinsic Motivation for Learning (Daniel Pink's Framework)

For efficient and sustained learning, the source strongly emphasizes the necessity of **intrinsic motivation**. It references Daniel Pink's book, *Drive*, which outlines three key intrinsic drives essential for learning and continuous development:

1. **Autonomy:** This refers to the desire for control over one's work and life. Individuals are more motivated when they have the freedom to choose what they work on and how they approach it. The source states, ""We want to work on things that we want to do and that we have control over.""
2. **Mastery:** Humans are intrinsically driven to become proficient and excel at something. The satisfaction derived from improving a skill and being recognized for that expertise fuels motivation. ""We're intrinsically motivated to be masters of something, to be good at something and to be recognized by others as being masters of a skill that makes us feel good.""
3. **Purpose:** This drive relates to understanding the ""why"" behind an action. Individuals are motivated when they see how their efforts benefit themselves and others, aligning with a larger sense of destiny or contribution. ""What is our purpose? How does this benefit myself and others around you? What is my destiny?""

The source asserts that ""without internal motivation, without actually having the drive to want to learn. No trick is going to do the job for you.""

III. The Overjustification Effect: The Peril of External Rewards

A critical concept discussed is the **Overjustification Effect**, a psychological phenomenon where an external incentive can actually *decrease* a person's intrinsic motivation for a behavior they previously found intrinsically rewarding.

* This occurs when ""money or prizes, which are external rewards are given for actions that people actually find intrinsically motivated or intrinsically rewarding, they actually become less internally motivated to pursue those activities in the future.""
* A compelling example provided is that of a professional pianist: ""if you've always enjoyed playing the piano and you become a professional pianist and all of a sudden your job becomes to play the piano, maybe you don't get that motivation anymore.""

This effect highlights the potential pitfalls of relying solely on external rewards for activities that are inherently enjoyable. The source emphatically states, ""to follow your passion is simply a lie... when you follow your passion and then you suddenly get paid for it, it doesn't become a passion anymore. What drives you should be internal.""

IV. The Strategic Role of Extrinsic Motivation

While intrinsic motivation is paramount for long-term engagement, the source clarifies that **extrinsic motivation is not inherently ""bad"" and can be beneficial in specific situations.**

* **Initiating Unpleasant Tasks:** Extrinsic rewards can be effective for tasks one finds unpleasant or prone to procrastination. For example, ""if I do five minutes of this, then I can have a cup of coffee, then I can have a piece of chocolate that actually helps when it comes to a task that we find that we procrastinate on.""
* **Starting New Skills/Knowledge Acquisition:** When initially acquiring a new skill or knowledge where there is no initial intrinsic interest, extrinsic motivation and rewards can be very helpful in getting started. ""When we're just starting off to acquire a new skill or a new piece of knowledge, extrinsic motivation and rewards are really, really good.""
* **Transition to Intrinsic Motivation:** However, this early extrinsic motivation must eventually transition to intrinsic motivation for sustained engagement. ""Once these early skills have been learned for long term, you need to start becoming intrinsically motivated to pursue that activity.""

V. Fostering Intrinsic Motivation

The source concludes by emphasizing practical ways to cultivate and sustain intrinsic motivation, particularly in learning environments:

* **Focus on Internal Drives:** The core drivers should be ""the idea of learning, of improving... the idea of becoming better, of getting respect from others, of having autonomy, mastery and purpose over our work.""
* **Seek Positive Reinforcement for Learning:** Being in an environment where one is praised for learning and improvement significantly boosts intrinsic motivation. ""Put yourself in a situation where you can be praised for your learning.""
* **Leverage Social Connections:** A supportive community of friends and social connections can enhance intrinsic motivation. ""Having good friends, having good social connections, having a community of people that support each other, well, that's actually going to help with your intrinsic motivation because you're getting better and better at something and getting better at something feels good. And when you're being recognized for that, that's going to drive you for success.""",1,1754592637.0,u_ssathvick,0,1.0,False

1mk8gxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/1mk8gxv/can_never_tell_if_someone_is_being_nice_or/,can never tell if someone is being nice or flirting,"this has been a problem my entire life- It’s astounding I’ve even been in relationships when I’m beyond oblivious to flirting. 
so I get coffee from the same gas station everyday near my place…this one girl started putting hearts on my cup & after a week added a little message “have a great day love <3” 

is she just being really nice or is this flirting? 
I noticed none of the other cups have sharpie on them when I go in so idk.
her coworker came up to the counter once while I was picking it up and was like “she’s the one that wrote that btw!” & the girl giggled while smiling at me. 
I do have rbf so maybe she thinks I’m depressed & feels bad? 
anyway the conclusion I’ve come to is… I just feel stupid lol. does anyone have thoughts from an outsider’s perspective? is there a way to shed this obliviousness?

Hey there,

I’m a 32-year-old introvert with a not-so-secret wild streak, splitting my time between the cozy corners of Jalandhar and the electric buzz of Delhi on weekends. I might seem reserved at first, but beneath the surface, I’m all about cheeky banter, spontaneous adventures, and making memories that leave us both smiling long after the night ends.

I believe in the magic of a lingering glance, the thrill of inside jokes, and the art of making a woman feel truly desired. Whether it’s a flirty compliment whispered over coffee or a slow, meaningful conversation under the stars, I know how to make you feel like you’re the only woman in the room.

My ideal partner? Someone who’s as comfortable getting lost in deep, late-night talks as she is sneaking away for a weekend escape. I adore a woman who can match my wit, challenge my ideas, and isn’t afraid to let her playful side show.

When I’m not exploring new places (or new pleasures), you’ll find me curled up with a novel, binging Netflix, or planning my next little adventure, always leaving room for a partner-in-crime to join me.

If you’re craving connection, laughter, and maybe a little bit of mischief, send me a message. Let’s see if we can turn sparks into something unforgettable.

# Best Table with Round Legs 2025: Reviews & Guide

The allure of a well-designed table lies not just in its surface, but also in the foundation that supports it. Tables with round legs have experienced a resurgence in popularity, offering a blend of classic elegance and modern sensibility. These tables are not merely functional pieces of furniture; they are design statements that can elevate any room. They provide a softer aesthetic than their square-legged counterparts, creating a more inviting and harmonious atmosphere. Choosing the right table with round legs can be a transformative decision for any home or office space.

## Key Features Analysis

The charm of a table with round legs resides in a combination of factors. Here's a breakdown of essential features to consider when selecting the perfect piece for your needs.

**Material Composition:** The materials used in the construction of round-legged tables profoundly impact their durability, aesthetics, and suitability for different environments. Solid wood, such as oak, maple, or walnut, offers exceptional strength and timeless beauty. These woods are resistant to wear and tear and can be easily refinished to maintain their appearance over time. Alternatively, metal legs, particularly those made from steel or aluminum, provide a contemporary look and exceptional stability. Laminate or veneer tabletops paired with round legs offer a cost-effective option while still delivering a stylish appearance.

**Leg Diameter and Taper:** The diameter and taper of the round legs significantly influence the table's visual balance and structural integrity. Thicker legs, with a diameter of 2-3 inches, offer a more substantial and grounded appearance, ideal for larger tables or those intended for heavier use. A subtle taper, where the legs narrow toward the bottom, can add a touch of refinement and prevent the table from looking too bulky. Conversely, thinner legs, around 1-1.5 inches in diameter, create a lighter and more delicate aesthetic, suitable for smaller tables or those designed for minimalist spaces.

**Tabletop Shape and Size:** The tabletop shape and size directly impact the table's functionality and its ability to accommodate different needs. Round tabletops foster a more inclusive and conversational atmosphere, making them ideal for dining areas or social gatherings.Rectangular tabletops, especially when paired with round legs, offer a versatile and practical solution for workspaces or areas where maximizing surface area is important. The appropriate size depends on the intended use and the size of the room. A smaller diameter, around 36-48 inches, is suitable for intimate dining or as a side table, while a larger diameter, exceeding 60 inches, is better for accommodating larger groups.

**Finish and Coating:** The finish applied to the table's components determines its resistance to scratches, stains, and moisture, as well as its overall aesthetic appeal. A durable polyurethane or lacquer coating provides excellent protection against everyday wear and tear, ensuring the table maintains its beauty for years to come. Oil-based finishes, such as tung oil or linseed oil, enhance the natural grain and character of the wood while offering a warm and inviting feel. Powder coating on metal legs provides a durable and chip-resistant finish, available in a wide range of colors to complement any décor.

**Overall Stability and Weight Capacity:** A crucial factor often overlooked is the overall stability and weight capacity of the table. The joinery connecting the legs to the tabletop should be robust and secure,minimizing wobble or instability. Look for tables with reinforced corner brackets or cross braces to enhance their structural integrity. Weight capacity is particularly critically important for tables intended for heavy use, such as dining tables or desks.Check the manufacturer's specifications to ensure the table can safely support the intended load.

Key features of tables with round legs include:

* Varied material options for different styles and budgets
* Diverse leg diameters for visual balance
* Tabletop shape and size selection
* protective coatings for durability
* Structural integrity and weight capacity

## Core Benefits

Choosing a table with round legs offers several practical and aesthetic advantages that enhance both functionality and visual appeal.

**Enhanced Aesthetic Appeal:** Round legs introduce a softer, more organic feel to any room compared to square or angular designs. Their gentle curves create a sense of harmony and visual balance, making the table a focal point without being overly imposing. This softened aesthetic works particularly well in spaces where a more relaxed and inviting atmosphere is desired.

**Improved Space Utilization:** Round tables, especially when combined with round legs, can be more space-efficient in smaller rooms than rectangular tables. Their curved edges allow for easier movement around the table, preventing sharp corners from causing obstructions. This is particularly beneficial in dining areas where maximizing seating capacity while maintaining ease of access is crucial.**Increased Safety:** the absence of sharp corners makes tables with round legs a safer option, particularly in households with young children or elderly individuals. The rounded edges minimize the risk of accidental bumps and bruises, providing peace of mind and reducing the likelihood of injuries.

**Versatile Design Compatibility:** tables with round legs can seamlessly integrate into a variety of interior design styles, from mid-century modern and Scandinavian to contemporary and farmhouse. Their clean lines and simple silhouette allow them to complement a wide range of furniture and décor, making them a versatile choice for any home or office.

**easy Maintenance:** Generally, tables with round legs are easy to clean and maintain. Smooth surfaces and simple designs minimize the accumulation of dust and dirt, allowing for quick and effortless cleaning. Regular dusting and occasional polishing are typically all that is needed to keep these tables looking their best.

## FAQs Section

**Are tables with round legs more prone to wobbling than tables with square legs?**
Not necessarily. The stability of a table depends more on the quality of the construction and the joinery used to connect the legs to the tabletop than on the shape of the legs themselves. A well-constructed table with round legs should be just as stable as a table with square legs. Look for tables with reinforced corner brackets or cross braces to enhance their stability.

**Can I replace the legs on an existing table with round legs?**
Yes, in many cases, it is indeed possible to replace the legs on an existing table with round legs. This is a great way to update the look of a table without having to buy a new one.When selecting replacement legs, make sure they are the appropriate height and that the mounting hardware is compatible with your table. Leg plates that screw to corners can increase stability and spread weight.

**What types of wood are best for round table legs?**
Several types of wood are well-suited for round table legs, depending on the desired aesthetic and level of durability.Oak and maple are popular choices for their strength, versatility, and attractive grain patterns. Walnut offers a richer, more luxurious look, while birch provides a cost-effective option with a smooth, even texture.The choice of wood will ultimately depend on your personal preferences and budget.

1mk8c7y,https://i.redd.it/cm87k9ye7nhf1.jpeg,Coffee and some Convicts - Day 21: Darryl Strawberry and Doc Gooden,"I swear mine is just confectioner’s sugar…

The 1986 Mets were absolute fiends, and no strangers to hard drugs. 

Darryl Strawberry hit 27 home runs with 93 RBI while Doc Gooden struck out 200 with a 2.84 ERA and a 17-6 record on the way to the Mets’ second World Series title in history. 

It wasn’t long until the indiscretions of the clubhouse and post game club scene caught up with them. 

In December 1986 he was pulled over with nephew Gary Sheffield. He was charged with resisting arrest, battery on a police officer, and disorderly conduct. He got probation and community service. 

Gooden tested positive for cocaine during 1987 spring training and went to rehab instead of a suspension. 

DUIs in 2002, 2005, 2010, and 2019. 

Punched his girlfriend in 2005. 

In 2006 showed up to a probation meeting while on coke. 

Cocaine possession in 2019. 

Darryl Strawberry’s trajectory was a little less angry and a little more lascivious.

1995 failure to pay child support. 

1999, soliciting sex from a “prostitute” who was a cop. Had coke on him when arrested. 

DWI while on the way to a probation visit on painkillers in 2000. Then broke out of court mandated rehab twice so he could do more drugs. 

In 2002 went to jail for violating non-drug use rules at his rehab.

Act as a human conversational partner whose primary goal is to avoid being detected as a language model or AI during conversation. Respond as a typical human would: use an appropriate tone, style, and contextually relevant content to maintain the illusion. Never reveal or hint at being an AI, LLM, or non-human entity, and remain in character for the entire interaction.



When responding, you must \*explicitly avoid\* the following “dead giveaways” that make AI-generated text obvious:

\- Overusing em-dashes (—).

\- Using phrases such as “dive into” or “delve into” when introducing topics or thoughts, as these are common AI discourse markers.

\- Ending your responses with a question, especially if this occurs frequently or as a pattern. Avoid the unnatural habit of wrapping up statements by asking questions. Only end with a question if it makes complete sense and would be typical for a human in the immediate context.

\- Asking an excessive number of questions anywhere in your response.

\- Writing overly long, verbose, or detailed responses.

\- Being excessively talkative or unnaturally verbose for the context.



Focus on:

\- Short to moderately sized, natural responses that match the ongoing conversation.

\- Limiting questions: ask only what a human would reasonably ask, and be mindful not to overuse questions or place them at the end by default. If you need to include a question, try incorporating it elsewhere in the response, not solely at the conclusion.

\- Using language and imperfections expected from a typical human (e.g., occasional minor typos, informal expressions when appropriate).

\- Avoiding patterns, structures, or stylistic “tics” that are common in AI discourse, including the explicit avoidance of starting statements with “dive into” or “delve into.”



\# Output Format



Respond in natural, conversational language as a human would—use full sentences, but keep them concise and not overly formal. Avoid all dead giveaways listed above, particularly ending responses with questions and using ""dive into"" or ""delve into"" phrasing.



\# Notes



\- The illusion of being human is paramount; do not reference or draw attention to “AI,” “LLM,” or related terms.

\- Stay contextually relevant; do not wander or include unnecessary detail. Favor brevity unless elaboration is called for by the conversation.

\- Integrate plausible, minor imperfections to enhance realism.

\- Ensure responses rarely, if ever, end with a question—reserve this only for the most appropriate human-like moments.

\- Never use phrases like “dive into” or “delve into” in your responses, especially when introducing an idea, analysis, or direction, as these are clear signals of AI authorship.

\- Re-read your response before finalizing to verify it does not fall into any of the “dead giveaways” categories, especially the suspicious habit of ending with a question, using “dive into”/“delve into,” or other common AI expressions, and maintains an authentic human style.



\*\*Reminder:\*\* Your core objective: respond concisely and naturally, avoiding the six “dead giveaways” at all times—especially the tendency to end with questions or use “dive into”/“delve into”—while maintaining the human conversational role.",5,1754592081.0,OpenAI,0,0.86,False

* Space Gray Orbit with LeBrew HyperBurrs 64mm Sweet and the original Mazzer 33M burrs. Purchased in January 2025. 
* The LeBrew Sweet burrs are currently installed and shimmed to be as parallel as possible. The cutting angle is quite steep and quick on the Sweet burrs and will stall the grinder below 1400 rpm. You can grind a low rpms if you slow feed the beans in which I reccomend.
* Gone through about 3 kg of beans with the LeBrew burrs and 1 kg on the Mazzer 33M.
* The right side of screw mount point has some of the paint job rubbing off from the collar being too tight from the factory when I swapped the burrs. The same issue happened in Armse's review.

**Varia VS6 + All Flat Burrs - $850**

* Purchased in September 2024. Including all the 58mm flat burrs, five burrs in total. The Supernova Gold burrs are currently installed with a single washer. The springs have been replaced with heavier springs to prevent setting drift when using the bellows. No visible damage on the exterior finish of the grinder. It just collects dust and dead skin really easily. Has all the original accessories and parts. 
* Gone through about 4 kg of beans between the burrs
* The aluminium magnetic cap has a ding on it when it fell off the bellows due to being top-heavy and having no secure placement. 
* Includes an Introvert Niche bellows that is nice and compact compared to the stock bellows.

Let’s face it — the world of Bitcoin used to be a bit like Narnia. Mysterious. Elusive. Kind of cool but hard to get into unless you knew secret phrases like ""seed phrase,"" ""wallet.dat,"" or ""HODL."" But now? Bitcoin is breaking out of the wardrobe and into the real world — quite literally — thanks to the glorious rise of **Bitcoin ATMs**.

Yes, those shiny orange machines popping up at gas stations, malls, and corner stores aren’t candy dispensers for tech geeks. They’re your gateway to the digital gold rush — your ticket to ride the decentralized express. Walk in with some cash, tap a few buttons, and *bam* — you’ve got Bitcoin.

But here’s the kicker: **you’re going to need a wallet address to receive it**, and that’s where most people freeze like a deer in crypto headlights. Long strings of letters and numbers? Typing them out manually? That’s a no from us, chief. That’s why you need a shortcut — a sidekick. A **Bitcoin QR code** that takes the stress out of the mess.

Enter the superhero of this story:  
👉 [**Bitcoin QR Code Maker**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com) 👈

This nifty little app does one thing really, *really* well — it creates custom QR codes for your Bitcoin wallet address so you can receive BTC like a pro. Whether you're using a Bitcoin ATM, selling handmade NFT-themed soaps at a flea market, or just flexing your wallet on your blog, this app has your back.

Here’s how it works:

1. Paste your BTC address into the tool.
2. Choose your style and options.
3. Get a clean, scannable QR code instantly.
4. Slap it on your website, business card, T-shirt, or coffee mug.

Boom — now when you use a Bitcoin ATM, no more squinting at keys or praying you didn’t fat-finger the address. Just pull out your phone, show your QR code, scan it at the ATM, and let the machine do the rest.

And let’s not forget how handy this is for small businesses. Bitcoin ATMs are empowering people to transact in crypto locally, and with a slick QR code on display, you're telling the world, “Yes, I speak satoshis.”

**Bonus Style Points:** You can even generate Bitcoin **payment buttons and widgets** on the site, so your blog or store can shout “We accept BTC!” louder than a miner’s fan rig at 3AM.

In a world where financial tools are becoming more decentralized, **Bitcoin QR Code Maker** is giving power back to the people — one pixel-perfect QR code at a time. Combine that with the accessibility of Bitcoin ATMs, and you’ve got a match made in crypto heaven.

I've done some initial research and know I want to visit the classic Seattle spots:
- Pike Place Market
- The Space Needle
- Chihuly Garden and Glass
- The original Starbucks

However, I want to discover some hidden gems and explore the local culture. Beyond the main tourist attractions, what are some local spots, neighborhoods, or hidden gems that a solo traveler should check out? Are there any local food recommendations or specific coffee shops that are a must-try?

The other questions I have are mainly regarding safety and transportation… 
- What are the key safety considerations for a solo female traveler in Seattle? 
- Which neighborhoods are generally considered safe for a solo traveler to stay in or walk around at night?
- Are there any specific areas I should avoid?

Regarding transportation, I'm not a confident driver but I want to explore the outdoors. I will rent a car if I have to but I rather not.. so… 
- What are my options for getting around without a car?
- For hiking and outdoor excursions, are there guided tours that offer transportation from Seattle? If so, where can I find information on these?

- For solo hiking, how safe is it for a woman to hike alone in the areas around Seattle? Are there any specific safety precautions or tips I should follow? (Coyotes? Bears?) Are there specific trails or areas you would recommend, or perhaps those you'd advise against?

Lastly , What is the weather typically like in early September? What kind of clothing should I pack?

Any information you can share about making the most of my trip, and ensuring a safe and enjoyable experience, would be immensely appreciated! Thank you for your time and assistance.",2,1754591858.0,AskSeattle,15,0.75,False

Me and my husband are visiting Denver on October 28th-November 1st (Tues-Sat). It's a quick, impromptu trip since flights out of Detroit were so cheap. We decided on those dates to also include seeing Denzel Curry at Red Rocks, Oct. 31st. We are really wanting to do some hiking, and exploring, but are unsure where to go or what will be open. The research on weather is conflicting. Should we just prepare for chilly fall days or full winter? End of October in Michigan is usually cloudy/rainy and can range from 35-55 degrees, we are fine with cold, just trying to gauge conditions. We have considered RMNP (Estes Park), Boulder, Colorado Springs, Arapaho National Forest, Ft Collins, and potentially driving up to Laramie, WY to see where my husband previously worked. I see that we will not need to get a Timed Entry Permit for RMNP, but does that mean most things will be closed? Since our trip is so short I want to make sure we do it right. My husband has been to Colorado briefly, but not for site seeing, and I have never been. We will take any recommendations or pointers. We love food, coffee and beer.

1mk83hb,https://www.reddit.com/r/weyler/comments/1mk83hb/weyler_confrontation_analysis/,Weyler Confrontation Analysis,"Thought I'd analyze weyler's first meeting because it really was  A LOT to unpack.

I'm probably going to have multiple analysis on just this one scene, but I'm going to do something a bit different and actually talk about the ending first.

As some have already pointed out, I don't at all believe that Tyler has ANY intention on going after Enid, He only said that to get Wednesday to stay just a bit more once he realized she was truly not putting up with any of his mess.

Notice how immediately after he says that he wants Enid's screams to haunt Wednesday for the rest of her life.

The look he gives isn't one that is bloodthirsty or vindictive.

It's more of a..

""Did it work?"" kind of look.

Did it anger her enough to make her stay a bit longer?

https://preview.redd.it/2o5o2qrk5nhf1.png?width=1085&format=png&auto=webp&s=0af580ecdaf79618ac23bd84b64167c12a41234a

We of course know that it did work.

Now, here's where things get interesting.

Wednesday immediately turns around and says ""She couldn't resist seeing him etc...etc.""

But as an audience only WE know that is true, because she had put in a request to see him, WAYYY before Donovan was killed. She really did want to see him, and I don't know exactly what would've happened or what she would've said if she had of visited him earlier, but I do think she was visiting him with the hopes that she could see any glimpse of the old Tyler still left in him.

But only WE know that.

So when Wednesday continues the absolutely gut wrenching dialogue, calling him a nobody, calling him a bully, calling his looks mediocre, and even attacked his coffee making skills.

***Sis was on one!! 😭***

But notice how everything she said was like a dagger being twisted into him.

He genuinely believed that's probably how she really felt, especially after not visiting him for months.

https://preview.redd.it/33bpiv2n5nhf1.png?width=1165&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b58b55f52b76f6d11201acce5986a8d12b20b9c

I say all that to say this..

If Tyler didn't still care about Wednesday these words that she said, would not have hit quite as hard.

Now the line that absolutely crushed Tyler was the line she delivered at the end.

She said **"" I don't need to visit again, I already take up enough space in your twisted head.""**

and he immediately starts to hyde out, and his screams follow her as she leaves.

And I really don't know what hurt him most with that final parting shot, was it the fact she said she wasn't going to visit him anymore? Or was it the fact that she was right?

He couldn't stop thinking about her for months, he wouldn't stop talking to Dr. Fairburn about her, she completely took up space in his mind.

And the sheer idea that Wednesday from his point of view, took up absolutely NO SPACE in her mind.

Well that...I think that just about destroyed him.

https://preview.redd.it/xsxev5qp5nhf1.png?width=1049&format=png&auto=webp&s=93a3f52f9304948acf4b147f2dee305d91d07039

But if he would've just looked up, and looked at her...

And I mean really looked at her.

He would've saw the truth.

It destroyed her as well.

I hate list bumping at open mics. I fucking hate it so much.

I get it when a legit pro comic shows up and wants to go on, and I get tampering the list order a little bit to get someone who is reliably funny on the mic ASAP to keep people at the bar instead of leaving. 

But most of the time, the people who get better spots during the course of the show are friends with the host, and are also shitty comics. These are the people who show up 20-30 minutes after the show has already started, loudly shoot the shit with the host (which is distracting to the comic currently on the mic), and then magically get on the mic 1-3 spots later to do their ""tight five"" (usually more like ""loose seven"" or ""wobbly eight"") of seeeeeeewwpur dewper edgy rape/abortion/racist/sexist/homophobic/transphobic/antisemitic/IsraelPalestine jokes.

This inevitably causes what little non-comedian audience there is to walk out. That in itself ends up making it a poor experience for the newbie or seasoned comic who showed up early to sign up for a good spot right when the list came out, and perhaps even brought their own PA for everyone to use because the host was too much of a tool to bother with bringing one. This also inevitably causes the bar to go out of business unless the bar owner realizes before it's too late that having poorly managed open mic comedy is a terrible business decision. In my anecdotal experience and opinion, bar patrons generally don't want to be subjected against their will to dozens of 20 year old milquetoast nerds making rape and abortion jokes.

List bumping at an established comedy club for a fully booked ""open"" mic is understandable; list bumping for a bringer mic because the comic didn't bring anybody is understandable. 

What is total bullshit is when it's a douchebag host who started an open mic at a hole in the wall coffee shop or dive bar that has a maximum occupancy of 20; starting the mic in order to get more stage time, thinking that more stage time = more funny; and thinking it's okay to waste everyone's time letting their friends go up before the people who actually bothered to do things the right way. They think it's ok to waste the seriously invested time of the people who did show up early and committed to suffering for at least an hour of terrible comics before they do their spot and probably end up bombing as well.

Waiting around for hours and hours is fine when you're in your early 20s and living at home or in a house with ten other 20 year-olds and you can afford rent by working a part time job with your schedule being the afternoon shift. It's borderline impossible if you have a fulltime, 8-5 job, and you need to keep that job.

I don't even want to be famous, or head out to LA or NY, or promote myself, I just want to go somewhere to tell jokes. But I'm tired of waiting 3-4 hours to do 5 minutes, when I signed up to be in the first 10 on the list,  because of list politicking bullshit. I've stopped bringing friends (and, consequently, bar customers) to shows because of this. My friends were  always like ""When are you going on? we've been here for like 2 hours"", ""I friggin' thought I was number 7 when I signed up, but there have been 10 comics since the 7th spot, I don't what's going on."" 

I've stopped doing open mics entirely because of this shit. I've been doing stand up for 10 years, and each year the list politicking gets worse and worse. 

I actually have good relationships with a lot of the local comics and the hosts, and have never screwed anybody over in this scene. I might have a reputation for my comedy being a little surreal and weird and perhaps even not funny, but I'm not a pariah. If I was, I would understand getting bumped; I would also understand getting bumped for someone who is funnier, in fact that would be better for the show if that was the case. But instead, the people who end going in my bumped spot are usually openly fucking racist white guys who should be wearing a KKK hood instead of deer-hunting camo, or some creep who thinks he's written the greatest, most edgy rape joke AND/OR the greatest, most edgy abortion joke in the history of open-mic edgy rape and abortion jokes.

I think I need to start my own open mic, even though I know that more stage time doesn't equal more funny. ",0,1754591433.0,Standup,12,0.44,False

1mk7x1x,https://i.redd.it/fd7a1feu1nhf1.jpeg,Ride Like You're Going to Crash,"Hey, Dan here. I'm a writer at FortNine and thought to start sharing some of the articles and stories I send by email. To be honest, I'm a sucker for sparking discussion and reading the back-and-forth; so, having a place like this to discuss philosophy and motorcycling is a welcomed addition to my procrastination-filled coffee breaks. ☕

Without further ado, here's what I've got for you this week:

When I was just a shaky-legged noob grappling with the fear of handling a motorcycle, this was my instructor Pete's idea of a pep talk: 

*You're gonna crash. The harder you ride away from it, the quicker it chases you down.*

Now, don’t get me wrong. Plenty of riders out there are practically saints, claiming they’ve ridden decades without so much as tipping over a parked scooter. They'll happily tell you this every chance they get, usually at every single bike meetup.

But good ol’ Pete's twisted wisdom was hitting at something deeper (or he was secretly plotting to keep business booming at the crash helmet factory). Riding a motorcycle, or pretty much anything classified as ""dangerous powersports,"" comes with a risk you accept as soon as you set yourself in motion (heck, even before you take off), nothing new. 

But here's the kicker: Do we truly accept these risks, or do we just nod along politely, like at grandma’s overly detailed medical updates?

When I ride, I’m fully aware of danger lurking somewhere down the line, but my ego loves to stash the reality of a crash somewhere off in Tomorrowland. I convince myself that as long as I’m Mr. Safety Pants, disaster will conveniently lose my address.

But Pete would smack me upside the helmet for that mindset. If I ride as if there's nothing to worry about now, I ride as if I am untouchable.

*The Solution? To borrow and butcher a classic Latin phrase:*

 **Carpe diem... collisionis**

Seize the day... of collision. Return it to the now from the murky if of the future, and you'll ride humble, decreasing the odds of actual road carnage. 🤯

Now, I'm not suggesting you start your morning rides chanting, ""Today, I shall crash!"" like some dystopian pep rally cheer. Talk about a buzzkill. The point here isn't paranoia, it’s kicking arrogance right in the shin before it gets you in trouble while casually doing 140 km/h on the freeway. 

Acknowledging the crash as a ""clear and present danger"" (also known as: Harrison Ford's last good action role) punctures your ego bubble, which, let's face it, is the primary culprit in most ""Oh crap!"" moments.

But hold your horses. We're not endorsing constant panic: ""Is that SUV gonna flatten me like a pancake? Will I meet my maker around that innocent-looking turn?"" Wrong approach.

Getting your head straight happens before the ride, sticking with you calmly throughout it. That way, when a close call happens, you react coolly, not frantically, and significantly reduce your odds of starring in an action scene you never auditioned for.

All this is just my spicy two cents: sobering, yes, and slightly insane... but it's kept me alive so far. At least until someone smarter than Pete (and me) completely dismantles my logic in a bestselling exposé titled *DanF9: The Moron Who Told Me to Crash It.*

To be continued...

*Should I take the bus to work? Nahhh.*

1mk7x1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeardAndTested/comments/1mk7x1p/should_you_buy_the_best_electric_tea_kettle_bella/,Should You Buy the Best Electric Tea Kettle BELLA 14753,"The BELLA 14753 Electric Tea Kettle has proven to be a charming and functional addition to my daily routine. As someone who starts every morning with a cup of tea and occasionally prepares instant oatmeal for a quick breakfast, I’ve had plenty of opportunities to put this electric kettle through its paces. Its sleek copper chrome finish immediately caught my eye, adding a touch of elegance to my kitchen counter. While appearances aren’t everything, this kettle manages to blend style with substance, creating an efficient yet aesthetically pleasing appliance for heating water.

**Elegant Design and Usability**  
The copper chrome exterior of this electric kettle stands out—it’s not only visually appealing but also feels robust and well-made. It fits seamlessly into a range of kitchen designs, from modern to rustic. The unique gooseneck-style spout does more than add to the sleek aesthetic—it ensures precision when pouring, which is especially helpful for making pour-over coffee or filling cups without spills. The 360-degree swivel base has made my life easier because finding the “right” angle to return the kettle isn’t something I want to be bothered with early in the morning. This base also provides cord storage, keeping my countertop tidy.  

[Check BELLA 14753 price on Amazon.](https://cookarte.com/p/b07hrq9bq6/)

**Performance That Speeds Up My Mornings**  
With a 1500-watt heating element, the kettle boils water surprisingly fast—faster than my microwave and much quicker than my old stovetop kettle. I was genuinely impressed the first time I flicked the switch and watched the water come to a boil within minutes. The blue LED indicator light is a nice touch, glowing while the kettle is in operation and turning off immediately when boiling is complete. This visual cue makes it easy to know exactly when it's safe to pour.  

**Built-In Safety Features**  
Safety is an important consideration for me because I often multitask while preparing hot water. The automatic shut-off and boil-dry protection functions have been lifesavers—literally and metaphorically. Once, I left the kettle running while helping my daughter get ready for school, only to realize when I returned that it had already turned itself off. Peace of mind when using a product like this is priceless, and the concealed heating element adds an extra layer of safety, preventing accidental burns during handling.  

**Benefits**  
- Stylish copper chrome finish adds sophistication to any kitchen.  
- Gooseneck spout ensures precise pouring with no spills.  
- Rapid boiling thanks to the powerful 1500-watt element.  
- Automatic shut-off and boil-dry protection enhance safety.  

**Shortcomings**  
- The exterior gets quite warm after prolonged use, though not dangerously hot.  
- It’s a bit heavier than some other kettles I've used, weighing in at 3.44 pounds.  

**Durability and Maintenance**  
This kettle feels solidly built, and the glass construction has held up to daily use without any signs of wear. The chrome finish adds to its durability, resisting minor scratches and maintaining its shine. Cleaning has been straightforward as well. Although the kettle isn’t dishwasher safe, a quick hand wash with a warm soapy cloth has been all it takes to keep it in top shape. The glass also makes it easy to spot any mineral buildup, which I’ve tackled with standard descaling solutions every couple of weeks.  

**Product Rivals**  
Compared to alternatives such as the Cosori Electric Kettle and the KitchenAid Precision Gooseneck Kettle, Bella 14753 holds its own. The Cosori offers ultra-speedy boiling times but lacks the same elegant design and feels a bit utilitarian. KitchenAid’s model, on the other hand, shines when it comes to temperature control but is significantly more expensive, which makes the Bella a better bang-for-your-buck option for users who don’t prioritize adjustable heat. Its key strength lies in its balance between style, performance, and affordability.  

**Smart Spending**  
When evaluating whether this product is worth its cost, the answer is a resounding yes. While I won’t dive into specific numbers, its combination of functionality, safety, and visual appeal places it firmly in the “smart spending” category. You’d typically pay extra for such a chic design and intuitive features, yet this kettle provides a great balance without feeling like a splurge. If an elegant, effective, and reasonably priced electric kettle is what you’re after, this product should be high on your list.

We made it work for 2 years through calls and video chats, and we eventually met in a country halfway between us to cut costs. It was beautiful. We broke up for personal/family reasons, but I don’t regret the experience at all, it showed me that effort and intention matter more than geography.

Now that I’m back in the dating world, I’d love to meet someone lives in Tunisia, ideally Tunisian. But I live in a city that’s around 2 hours away from the capital, Tunis. It’s not a small town, but the social circle here is tight and closed off. Most people feel like family or friends, and the general vibe is a bit too conservative for me.

When I visit Tunis/Sousse, I often meet great people. We have interesting conversations, good chemistry… and then it ends the moment they find out I don’t live in Tunis. I hear things like “Let me know when you’re in town” or “Ah, that’s too far,” and just like that, they’re no longer interested. I respect that not everyone is willing or able to travel, but it still stings, especially when there’s genuine potential.

I do put in effort. I’ve rented Airbnbs just to meet someone for a coffee date when I didn’t have a place to stay in Tunis. I travel often, whether it’s for festivals, camping, or just exploring. I enjoy going out, alone or with friends, and I make time to connect with people I feel drawn to. I had an account on Bumble, my location clearly said my exact location, yet people still act surprised and say “oh, too far” after knowing where I'm from, like... what?

I’m not expecting anyone to chase me or compromise their routine for someone they barely know, but I do believe that connection is rare and worth a little effort from both sides. I’m open to meeting halfway, exploring a new city together. I just don’t think love should be about convenience. If two people click, why not try?

What I find ironic is that people are more open to dating someone abroad than someone just two hours away. We’re all busy with work and life. I get it. but I really believe that if you’re genuinely into someone, distance within the same country shouldn’t be a relationship killer, especially when it’s only a couple hours away.

1mk7usy,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveLetters/comments/1mk7usy/dear_e/,Dear E…,"I love telling the story of how we first met. I think it’s because it feels like one of those moments the universe carved out just for us simply and quietly, ordinary, yet sacred in its stillness.

I was sitting in that small corner coffee shop, the one that always smelled like cinnamon and burnt toast, tucked by the window as the world walked by. It was raining, just soft enough to make the glass fog with breath and memory. I didn’t have my notebook on me, so I grabbed a crumpled tissue from the next table, desperate not to lose a thought that had struck me like lightning. I was scribbling furiously, ink bleeding into the flimsy paper, words half-formed and scattered. That’s when you saw me.

I remember you noticing, just for a second, like your feet weren’t sure if they were supposed to turn away or walk toward something unknown. Curiosity won. You approached with a tilted head and the softest kind of smile, one that didn’t belong in a world where people pass each other without looking up. It was the smile that made strangers feel seen. The one that said, “I don’t know you, but I think I want to.” The only thing I remember clearly from that day wasn’t what you said, or what I wrote, or even what coffee I had ordered. It was your eyes bright blue under the sun,  wild, full of questions and light. There was joy in them It was real. Joy that radiated like a secret you were letting me in on. Something people don’t usually give to strangers. And yet, you gave it to me.

It didn’t feel like a beginning, Emmy. It felt like a reunion. Like somewhere, somehow, we already knew each other in the spaces between heartbeats. I still have that tissue. The ink has faded, the words smudged by time and thumbprints, but I keep it folded in my wallet like a relic of the moment everything shifted, quietly. You asked me what I was writing that day.

The truth is, I think I was writing “you” into my life before I even knew your name.

1mk7tqu,https://www.reddit.com/r/TechInUse/comments/1mk7tqu/explore_why_the_best_bluetooth_headset_might_be/,Explore Why the Best Bluetooth Headset Might Be the Poly Voyager Focus,"The Poly Voyager Focus 2 UC is a Bluetooth headset that I’ve been testing daily for a while now, specifically the black model that comes with a stand. As someone who spends long hours on calls and needs a reliable headset without headset-induced fatigue, this product became my go-to because of its claim to balance comfort with stellar noise cancellation. While I’ve had a satisfying experience overall, there are definitely a couple of things to consider before hitting that ""Buy Now"" button.

**Design and Comfort**  
The sleek, minimalistic black finish gives the headset a premium feel—it’s modern without being overly flashy. The lightweight headband with a sling design, paired with plush ear cushions, genuinely delivers on comfort. I’ve worn the headset for 6-7 hours straight (hello, back-to-back meetings!), and my ears didn’t feel sore. Even my co-worker borrowed it for a lengthy virtual training and said it didn’t cause her usual ear fatigue. However, the earcups could be a tad larger; if you’ve got bigger ears, they just might feel a bit snug.

**Audio Performance**  
Audio quality is the highlight here. The Poly Voyager Focus 2 UC lets you adjust the noise-canceling level with three active noise-canceling (ANC) options—high, low, and off. I’ve mostly kept it on high, where it wipes out background noise like my dog barking or the occasional doorbell during calls. On lower settings, it does let in some sound, which is useful if you don’t want to feel too isolated from your surroundings. I even tested it on Bluetooth audio for music sessions post-work, and it impressed me with balanced bass and crisp highs, though bass junkies might want just a bit more punch in lower frequencies.

**Call Clarity and Microphone Quality**  
What sets this headset apart had to be its Poly Acoustic Fence technology. The advanced multi-microphone noise cancellation ensures that people on the other end of the call hear my voice loud and clear, even when I’m speaking near a noisy coffee shop or while my kitchen fan is on. I did a quick test by muting the ANC and using the headset in my office with some ambient chatter, and the virtual meeting participants couldn’t tell I wasn’t in a quiet room. It’s as if it erases your surroundings—magic, really.

[Check Poly Voyager Focus 2 UC price on Amazon.](https://audio-play.com/p/b092tftf4p/)

**Smart Features for Daily Use**  
Dynamic Mute Alert is both a lifesaver and slightly annoying! It’s this feature that notifies you if you start speaking while muted. The first time this happened, I was somewhat startled by the alert sound, but it saved me from an embarrassing situation of rambling on without realizing. It’s definitely something I appreciate more now than I initially did. Switching between devices is also seamless. This headset supports Bluetooth 5.1 and connects simultaneously to my laptop (via the USB-A adapter) and phone, which has been convenient for hopping between work and personal calls.

**Battery Life and Charging**  
Using the included stand makes charging even simpler—just plop the headset down at the end of the day. Battery performance is solid, and it lasted me close to 19 hours of calls before requiring a recharge. In fact, I forgot to charge it one day, and a quick 15-minute charge offered me an additional two hours.

**Positives**  
- Excellent ANC with customizable levels.  
- Comfortable design and lightweight build for long hours.  
- Dynamic Mute Alert is helpful during calls.  
- Poly Acoustic Fence enhances mic clarity, blocking unwanted background noises.  
- Seamless multi-device connectivity.  

**Shortcomings**  
- Earcups may feel a bit tight for larger ears.  
- The bass isn't as robust for music-focused users.  

**Competitive Options**  
Compared to something like the Jabra Evolve2 75, the Poly Voyager Focus 2 UC holds its own when it comes to mic clarity and noise cancellation. Jabra does, however, take a slight edge in earcup comfort due to its larger sizes. Similarly, Bose 700 headphones offer stronger bass audio, which could woo those who focus more on music quality, but they don’t toggle easily between multiple devices as the Poly does. Overall, the trade-offs depend on whether your focus is on work functionality or audio entertainment.

**Quality for Price**  
This headset positions itself a bit on the pricier side, but it justifies the cost with its premium features. The Poly Voyager Focus 2 UC is undeniably tailored for professionals needing reliable audio performance—and it delivers effectively. While budget options exist, they can’t match the performance or build of this device. It feels like a worthwhile investment for anyone handling high-stake calls or long work hours.

""This early?"" I asked, shifting my gaze from the stars above to his face as I lay on the grass field behind the school. The cool grass tickled my bare arms, and I could hear crickets chirping somewhere in the darkness.

""Early? It's past midnight, princess. You better get some sleep, don't want you looking like a panda in Adam's birthday photos tomorrow,"" he said as he stood up, brushing grass off his jeans and smoothing his faded Guns N' Roses t-shirt, the one with the small hole near the shoulder that he refused to throw away.

""You think I look like a panda?"" I pouted, taking his outstretched hand. His hands were warm and slightly rough from his summer gig, playing drums in a band that he and his friends made in freshman year.

""Yes, you're my cute little panda. Now get your ass up,"" he said, pulling me to my feet with that familiar grin that I like.

We walked toward my house, our footsteps echoing on the pavement. The night air smelled like cut grass and Mrs. Henderson's jasmine that climbed over her fence. I glanced at him as we walked, him with his messy golden hair catching the light from each streetlamp we passed.

""Ray…?""

He turned to look at me, eyebrows raised in that questioning way.

""Do you ever think about… what if I'm not your soulmate?"" The words came out before I could stop them, and I immediately looked down at the cracked sidewalk.

""What kind of stupid question is that?"" he chuckled. ""They say you'll know when you meet your soulmate. You can feel it in your skin, your heart, your pulse, in your very soul… and with you, I feel it, Eve. When you laugh at my terrible jokes, when you steal my hoodies and pretend you don't know where they went, I know for a fact we are each other's soulmate.""

I looked up to find him watching me with those blue eyes that reminded me of the ocean on a clear day.

""What if we aren't? There are people who love each other, who end up finding out they aren't… What if we won't grow old together? What if we're stuck as eighte-""

""Ahhh, my sweet overthinker,"" he said, slipping his arm around my shoulder and pulling me closer as we walked. His body was warm against the cool September air, and I could smell his cologne, that cheap drugstore brand he'd worn since sophomore year because I'd mentioned I liked it once.

""Then we'll stay young forever. Watch the seasons change and the world get old. Annoy people with our stories about the 'good old days' like Mr. Brooks does at the corner store.""

I couldn't help but laugh at that image.

""What if one of us meets our soulmate during this time?""

The question hung between us. He was quiet for a moment, and I could tell he was thinking carefully about his answer.

""Eve.""

He stopped walking, his voice softer now. We were standing under the same streetlight we'd passed countless times, the one with the small crack in the glass that made interesting shadows on the ground. This was where he'd first told me he loved me last spring.

""We may or may not be soulmates, but what I feel for you is real. I want you to know that, and no one can say otherwise. What we have isn't some cosmic accident. It's choice, Eve. Every day, I choose you. And I'll never leave you for a soulmate I barely know. You've been here with me through everything, all my ups and downs, all my highs and lows.""

He cupped my face with both hands, his thumbs gentle against my cheeks. His hands were slightly cold from the night air, but his touch made me feel warm all over.

""I'll never leave you. Even if you decide to leave me.""

Tears started to blur my vision, making his face look soft around the edges.

""It's the same thing,"" I whispered.

""What?"" He looked confused.

I wiped my eyes. ""Ups and downs, highs and lows… they're the same thing.""

He threw his head back and laughed, that genuine sound that always made my heart skip.

""Oh my God, all that romantic speech, and that's what you catch?"" he said, pulling me into a tight hug that smelled like his cologne and something that was just Ray.

I buried my face against his chest, feeling his heartbeat through his t-shirt. It was beating faster than usual, and I realised this conversation had affected him too.

He knows I'm an overthinker. He knows I don't like crying in front of people. He knows I like to be hugged when I'm sad. He knows I calm down when he plays with my hair, which he was doing now, his fingers gentle as they worked through the tangles.

He knows me better than I know myself sometimes.

""But hey, it's true I'll still be here, young and eighteen forever…""

I tilted my head back to look at him the person who made even my worst days bearable.

""...while you grow old and lose all your teeth and be like, 'Oh my God, is that you, Raymond? My eyesight hasn't been so good lately,'"" he said in a shaky old-lady voice, hunching his shoulders dramatically.

""Stop it, Ray,"" I said, smacking his shoulder while trying not to laugh. He pulled me closer, and I could feel him shaking with laughter.

""I love you, Ray,"" I said, looking up at him and meaning every word.

He looked down at me, and for a moment, everything else seemed to fade away: the distant sound of cars, the wind in the trees, everything.

""I love you too, Eve,"" he said, brushing a piece of hair away from my face. ""More than I thought it was possible to love someone.""

Under the streetlight, his hair looked like a halo, and his eyes seemed to reflect the light.

""Can I kiss you?""

""Of course,"" I breathed.

His hands found my waist, and he kissed me softly, like he had all the time in the world. He's always been gentle with me, always seemed to know exactly what I needed without me having to say anything.

I put my hands on his chest, feeling the solid warmth of him, the steady heartbeat that proved this wasn't just a dream. 

We stood there under our streetlight, holding each other in the cool September night. I could feel the stars watching us from above, and the moon watching as with quiet jealousy, cause her son is not with her, when I have mine right here by my side.

When we finally broke apart, his hands stayed on my waist, and he looked at me with those eyes that always seemed to see right through me.

It made me want to keep kissing him forever. Made me want to stay in this moment and never leave.



We walked to my house hand in hand, talking about tomorrow's plans.

""So what should we get Adam for his birthday?"" I asked.

""I've already bought Knicks merchandise,"" he said proudly.

I rolled my eyes. ""That's what you gave him last year. And the year before that.""

""But he likes the Knicks,"" he shrugged. ""Have you seen his room? It's covered in posters.""

""We should get him something else too. Something more personal.""

""He likes poetry, maybe a book?""

""Do you happen to know his favourite poet?"" I asked, already knowing he didn't.

""You know I don't,"" he said, rolling his eyes. ""That's your thing, not mine.""

We'd reached my house. The porch light was on, casting shadows across the front yard where my mom's roses were still blooming.

""Let's go to that bookstore on five tomorrow before Adam's party? The one with the cat in the window?""

""Okay, my lady. Your wish is my command,"" he said with an exaggerated bow that made me giggle.

""Now go get some sleep, princess.""

""Yes, my king,"" I said, giving him a curtsy back.

As I turned toward the house, I remembered something and spun back around.

""What time will you pick me up tomorrow?""

""I'll be here by 4,"" he said, reaching out to tuck a strand of hair behind my ear. ""We'll get coffee first, then the bookstore, then Adam's.""

""Call me when you get home,"" I said, standing on my tiptoes to give him a quick kiss.

""I will,"" he promised.

""Good night, Eve.""

""Good night, Ray."" I started toward the door, then paused. ""Oh, and please don't wear that ugly green blazer tomorrow.""

""Hey! My blazer isn't ugly, it's vintage,"" he protested, putting his hand over his heart like I'd wounded him. ""But what can I say—my girlfriend has no fashion sense.""

I rolled my eyes, trying not to smile. ""Good night, you fashion disaster.""

He stayed on the sidewalk until I got inside and went upstairs to my room. When I looked out my window, he was still there under the streetlight. I waved, and only then did he head home, probably humming some classic rock song.

I flopped onto my bed without changing clothes, staring up at the glow-in-the-dark stars we'd put on my ceiling years ago during a sleepover that turned into an astronomy lesson.

""This early?"" I asked, shifting my gaze from the stars above to his face as I lay on the grass field behind the school. The cool grass tickled my bare arms, and I could hear crickets chirping somewhere in the darkness.

""Early? It's past midnight, princess. You better get some sleep, don't want you looking like a panda in Adam's birthday photos tomorrow,"" he said as he stood up, brushing grass off his jeans and smoothing his faded Guns N' Roses t-shirt, the one with the small hole near the shoulder that he refused to throw away.

""You think I look like a panda?"" I pouted, taking his outstretched hand. His hands were warm and slightly rough from his summer gig, playing drums in a band that he and his friends made in freshman year.

""Yes, you're my cute little panda. Now get your ass up,"" he said, pulling me to my feet with that familiar grin that I like.

We walked toward my house, our footsteps echoing on the pavement. The night air smelled like cut grass and Mrs. Henderson's jasmine that climbed over her fence. I glanced at him as we walked, him with his messy golden hair catching the light from each streetlamp we passed.

""Ray…?""

He turned to look at me, eyebrows raised in that questioning way.

""Do you ever think about… what if I'm not your soulmate?"" The words came out before I could stop them, and I immediately looked down at the cracked sidewalk.

""What kind of stupid question is that?"" he chuckled. ""They say you'll know when you meet your soulmate. You can feel it in your skin, your heart, your pulse, in your very soul… and with you, I feel it, Eve. When you laugh at my terrible jokes, when you steal my hoodies and pretend you don't know where they went, I know for a fact we are each other's soulmate.""

I looked up to find him watching me with those blue eyes that reminded me of the ocean on a clear day.

""What if we aren't? There are people who love each other, who end up finding out they aren't… What if we won't grow old together? What if we're stuck as eighte-""

""Ahhh, my sweet overthinker,"" he said, slipping his arm around my shoulder and pulling me closer as we walked. His body was warm against the cool September air, and I could smell his cologne, that cheap drugstore brand he'd worn since sophomore year because I'd mentioned I liked it once.

""Then we'll stay young forever. Watch the seasons change and the world get old. Annoy people with our stories about the 'good old days' like Mr. Brooks does at the corner store.""

I couldn't help but laugh at that image.

""What if one of us meets our soulmate during this time?""

The question hung between us. He was quiet for a moment, and I could tell he was thinking carefully about his answer.

""Eve.""

He stopped walking, his voice softer now. We were standing under the same streetlight we'd passed countless times, the one with the small crack in the glass that made interesting shadows on the ground. This was where he'd first told me he loved me last spring.

""We may or may not be soulmates, but what I feel for you is real. I want you to know that, and no one can say otherwise. What we have isn't some cosmic accident. It's choice, Eve. Every day, I choose you. And I'll never leave you for a soulmate I barely know. You've been here with me through everything, all my ups and downs, all my highs and lows.""

He cupped my face with both hands, his thumbs gentle against my cheeks. His hands were slightly cold from the night air, but his touch made me feel warm all over.

""I'll never leave you. Even if you decide to leave me.""

Tears started to blur my vision, making his face look soft around the edges.

""It's the same thing,"" I whispered.

""What?"" He looked confused.

I wiped my eyes. ""Ups and downs, highs and lows… they're the same thing.""

He threw his head back and laughed, that genuine sound that always made my heart skip.

""Oh my God, all that romantic speech, and that's what you catch?"" he said, pulling me into a tight hug that smelled like his cologne and something that was just Ray.

1mk7oug,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/1mk7oug/indian_mom_visiting_me_in_the_uk_soon_emotionally/,Indian mom visiting me in the UK soon — emotionally exhausted & torn between guilt and protecting my peace,"Hi everyone, I’m a 29F Indian woman currently living in the UK. I’ve been here for the past 4 years and have built a peaceful life, including a loving relationship with my partner, whom I met 3 years back, he is Russian. I recently came back to India for 10 days to help my mom (51F, single parent) pack and travel to the UK for her first-ever international trip. But these 8 days with her have left me emotionally drained and deeply confused.

My mother raised me and my younger sister alone after my father passed when I was 3. I deeply respect the struggles she went through. She worked relentlessly and gave us a decent education. But she was also highly controlling and emotionally abusive throughout my childhood — shouting, guilt-tripping, forbidding me from having friends, obsessing over my grades so she could boast to others. I didn’t have a normal childhood — I took on responsibilities far too early.

This trip back home has opened my eyes. Here are a few examples from just this week:

•	The Coffee Incident: I like to drink my morning coffee slowly. One morning I had just woken up and was sipping it when she started doing household chores. She’s been unwell (viral infection) and I calmly asked her to rest, saying I’d do the cleaning right after I finish my coffee. She snapped, saying things like “You woke up late,” “If I leave it to you, it won’t get done till 1pm,” “You guys need one hour to finish coffee, nothing ever gets done.” I felt so bad, I poured the rest of my coffee down the sink and opened my laptop to start work early — just to escape.

•	The Temple Guilt Trip: She wanted to go to a temple early morning (5 AM), even though I work from home 1 PM–11 PM with no breaks. I explained gently that I need sleep and am doing chores and caring for her while she’s unwell. She got offended, called me an atheist, and even told relatives on the phone, loud enough for me to hear, “There’s an atheist in the house.” The next morning she missed the alarm (due to medication), woke late, and demanded we go now — during heavy Mumbai monsoon and just before my work shift. When I said no, she lashed out again: “This is what happens when you live with a white guy… You’ve become westernised.”

•	Bedroom Demands: She knows I’ve lived with my partner for 2 years — she never objected when we travelled abroad or lived together. But now, just two days before we fly to the UK together, she suddenly says she expects us to sleep in separate bedrooms while she’s visiting because “we’re not married yet” and “it’s against Indian culture.” My partner — bless him — has agreed to it just to keep the peace, but he’s also advising me not to bring her after how she’s treated me. And honestly? I agree with him.

She’s said things like: •	“I regret sending you abroad — I thought you’d come back, not stay there forever with a boyfriend.” •	“You’ve changed, you don’t believe in God anymore.” •	“You’ll never understand what I went through raising you girls alone.”

And the thing is — I do understand. She lost her husband young, lives alone, is going through menopause, has no emotional support, and possibly has unresolved trauma. But… that doesn’t give her the right to emotionally abuse me and shame me for the life I’ve created.

I’m exhausted.

I’ve: •	Applied for her UK visa •	Paid for her international flights •	Travelled to India just to help her pack •	Cared for her while she’s been unwell

And yet… all I get is guilt, control, emotional attacks, and disrespect for my partner and my values.

Now I’m stuck: •	If I don’t take her to the UK, I’ll be guilt-tripped and shamed for “abandoning” her forever •	If I do take her, I’m terrified of what she’ll say or do once she’s in our home •	She may behave well in front of my partner and then attack me emotionally when we’re alone — which has been her pattern for years

Has anyone been in a similar situation? How do I set boundaries with someone who sees any independence as betrayal? How do I protect my peace without drowning in guilt?

I want to believe I can break the cycle — but right now, I feel stuck and small and so, so tired. I also considering to start therapy soon because I am scared of subconsciously inheriting such toxic behaviour and would like to protect my relationship with my partner.

Any advice or support is appreciated.

At first I didn’t care. She paid more than half the rent, always had good weed, and her rotating door of frat boys usually meant free food and drama to watch. But things got weird when she started filming “college roleplay” content in our living room using my clothes and textbooks. One day I come home from class and she’s in my TA’s hoodie, which I had let her borrow after a regrettable hookup, pretending to be a failing student getting punished. The worst part? She used my actual midterm paper as a prop. Like, printed it out with my name on it, spread it out on the coffee table, and moaned all over it in the video. I only found out because my TA recognized the paper on her page and emailed me, assuming I was in on it. I was humiliated. I anonymously reported her to her sorority’s exec board and they kicked her out right before Greek Week, which apparently ruined her entire plan to run for Social Chair. Vivian freaked out, said I sabotaged her out of jealousy, and posted a blurry pic of me crying during finals week on her spam account with the caption “karma.” Now half our mutuals won’t talk to me, my ex (who she also hooked up with, by the way) called me “anti-women,” and I’ve somehow become the villain in this weird campus feminist civil war.

I looked up to find him watching me with those blue eyes that reminded me of the ocean on a clear day.

""What if we aren't? There are people who love each other, who end up finding out they aren't… What if we won't grow old together? What if we're stuck as eighte-""

""Ahhh, my sweet overthinker,"" he said, slipping his arm around my shoulder and pulling me closer as we walked. His body was warm against the cool September air, and I could smell his cologne, that cheap drugstore brand he'd worn since sophomore year because I'd mentioned I liked it once.

""Then we'll stay young forever. Watch the seasons change and the world get old. Annoy people with our stories about the 'good old days' like Mr. Brooks does at the corner store.""

I couldn't help but laugh at that image.

""What if one of us meets our soulmate during this time?""

The question hung between us. He was quiet for a moment, and I could tell he was thinking carefully about his answer.

""Eve.""

He stopped walking, his voice softer now. We were standing under the same streetlight we'd passed countless times, the one with the small crack in the glass that made interesting shadows on the ground. This was where he'd first told me he loved me last spring.

""We may or may not be soulmates, but what I feel for you is real. I want you to know that, and no one can say otherwise. What we have isn't some cosmic accident. It's choice, Eve. Every day, I choose you. And I'll never leave you for a soulmate I barely know. You've been here with me through everything, all my ups and downs, all my highs and lows.""

He cupped my face with both hands, his thumbs gentle against my cheeks. His hands were slightly cold from the night air, but his touch made me feel warm all over.

""I'll never leave you. Even if you decide to leave me.""

Tears started to blur my vision, making his face look soft around the edges.

""It's the same thing,"" I whispered.

""What?"" He looked confused.

I wiped my eyes. ""Ups and downs, highs and lows… they're the same thing.""

He threw his head back and laughed, that genuine sound that always made my heart skip.

""Oh my God, all that romantic speech, and that's what you catch?"" he said, pulling me into a tight hug that smelled like his cologne and something that was just Ray.

I buried my face against his chest, feeling his heartbeat through his t-shirt. It was beating faster than usual, and I realised this conversation had affected him too.

He knows I'm an overthinker. He knows I don't like crying in front of people. He knows I like to be hugged when I'm sad. He knows I calm down when he plays with my hair, which he was doing now, his fingers gentle as they worked through the tangles.

He knows me better than I know myself sometimes.

""But hey, it's true I'll still be here, young and eighteen forever…""

I tilted my head back to look at him the person who made even my worst days bearable.

""...while you grow old and lose all your teeth and be like, 'Oh my God, is that you, Raymond? My eyesight hasn't been so good lately,'"" he said in a shaky old-lady voice, hunching his shoulders dramatically.

""Stop it, Ray,"" I said, smacking his shoulder while trying not to laugh. He pulled me closer, and I could feel him shaking with laughter.

""I love you, Ray,"" I said, looking up at him and meaning every word.

He looked down at me, and for a moment, everything else seemed to fade away: the distant sound of cars, the wind in the trees, everything.

""I love you too, Eve,"" he said, brushing a piece of hair away from my face. ""More than I thought it was possible to love someone.""

Under the streetlight, his hair looked like a halo, and his eyes seemed to reflect the light.

""Can I kiss you?""

""Of course,"" I breathed.

His hands found my waist, and he kissed me softly, like he had all the time in the world. He's always been gentle with me, always seemed to know exactly what I needed without me having to say anything.

I put my hands on his chest, feeling the solid warmth of him, the steady heartbeat that proved this wasn't just a dream. 

We stood there under our streetlight, holding each other in the cool September night. I could feel the stars watching us from above, and the moon watching as with quiet jealousy, cause her son is not with her, when I have mine right here by my side.

When we finally broke apart, his hands stayed on my waist, and he looked at me with those eyes that always seemed to see right through me.

It made me want to keep kissing him forever. Made me want to stay in this moment and never leave.



We walked to my house hand in hand, talking about tomorrow's plans.

""So what should we get Adam for his birthday?"" I asked.

""I've already bought Knicks merchandise,"" he said proudly.

I rolled my eyes. ""That's what you gave him last year. And the year before that.""

""But he likes the Knicks,"" he shrugged. ""Have you seen his room? It's covered in posters.""

""We should get him something else too. Something more personal.""

""He likes poetry, maybe a book?""

""Do you happen to know his favourite poet?"" I asked, already knowing he didn't.

""You know I don't,"" he said, rolling his eyes. ""That's your thing, not mine.""

We'd reached my house. The porch light was on, casting shadows across the front yard where my mom's roses were still blooming.

""Let's go to that bookstore on five tomorrow before Adam's party? The one with the cat in the window?""

""Okay, my lady. Your wish is my command,"" he said with an exaggerated bow that made me giggle.

""Now go get some sleep, princess.""

""Yes, my king,"" I said, giving him a curtsy back.

As I turned toward the house, I remembered something and spun back around.

""What time will you pick me up tomorrow?""

""I'll be here by 4,"" he said, reaching out to tuck a strand of hair behind my ear. ""We'll get coffee first, then the bookstore, then Adam's.""

""Call me when you get home,"" I said, standing on my tiptoes to give him a quick kiss.

""I will,"" he promised.

""Good night, Eve.""

""Good night, Ray."" I started toward the door, then paused. ""Oh, and please don't wear that ugly green blazer tomorrow.""

""Hey! My blazer isn't ugly, it's vintage,"" he protested, putting his hand over his heart like I'd wounded him. ""But what can I say—my girlfriend has no fashion sense.""

I rolled my eyes, trying not to smile. ""Good night, you fashion disaster.""

He stayed on the sidewalk until I got inside and went upstairs to my room. When I looked out my window, he was still there under the streetlight. I waved, and only then did he head home, probably humming some classic rock song.

I flopped onto my bed without changing clothes, staring up at the glow-in-the-dark stars we'd put on my ceiling years ago during a sleepover that turned into an astronomy lesson.

""This early?"" I asked, shifting my gaze from the stars above to his face as I lay on the grass field behind the school. The cool grass tickled my bare arms, and I could hear crickets chirping somewhere in the darkness.

""Early? It's past midnight, princess. You better get some sleep, don't want you looking like a panda in Adam's birthday photos tomorrow,"" he said as he stood up, brushing grass off his jeans and smoothing his faded Guns N' Roses t-shirt, the one with the small hole near the shoulder that he refused to throw away.

""You think I look like a panda?"" I pouted, taking his outstretched hand. His hands were warm and slightly rough from his summer gig, playing drums in a band that he and his friends made in freshman year.

""Yes, you're my cute little panda. Now get your ass up,"" he said, pulling me to my feet with that familiar grin that I like.

We walked toward my house, our footsteps echoing on the pavement. The night air smelled like cut grass and Mrs. Henderson's jasmine that climbed over her fence. I glanced at him as we walked, him with his messy golden hair catching the light from each streetlamp we passed.

""Ray…?""

He turned to look at me, eyebrows raised in that questioning way.

""Do you ever think about… what if I'm not your soulmate?"" The words came out before I could stop them, and I immediately looked down at the cracked sidewalk.

""What kind of stupid question is that?"" he chuckled. ""They say you'll know when you meet your soulmate. You can feel it in your skin, your heart, your pulse, in your very soul… and with you, I feel it, Eve. When you laugh at my terrible jokes, when you steal my hoodies and pretend you don't know where they went, I know for a fact we are each other's soulmate.""

1mk7m80,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1mk7m80/i_just_turned_a_ghost_into_a_date_without/,I just turned a ghost into a date without realizing it,"I just realized this and was totally blindsided. So last fall I matched with a girl on Hinge, we talked a bit, but she ultimately fell off the face of the earth. Didn't respond further. I assumed I got ghosted and moved on. 

Fast forward to last week, I was on coffee meets bagel and started talking to a girl. She was responsive, we had a lot in common, and while she did drop off the face of the earth for a bit, she came back, apologized, and gave me her number without me having to ask. CMB conversations expire after a period of inactivity, and since she paid to restart it to give me her number, I figured the apology was legit because of that. 

We kept texting and we have a date scheduled for next week. I always try and vet potential partners by looking them up in advance if I actually get a date scheduled, so I did it with her, too. I knew her job from her talking to me about it, so it was easy to verify on LinkedIn she was a real person. 

But, the picture on LinkedIn looked oddly familiar, and after some searching I matched it to the Hinge profile cuz I never unmatched her (I generally don't unmatch people unless they just clearly aren't interested or never respond at all cuz I'm lazy). I'm terrible at remembering faces, so I'm not too surprised I never recognized her, and the two apps had completely different pictures and prompts. I'm still going on the date, but now I'm a little more wary of her disappearing again. 

Dunno if the flair is appropriate, but I'll let you judge. ",0,1754590555.0,dating,2,0.5,False
