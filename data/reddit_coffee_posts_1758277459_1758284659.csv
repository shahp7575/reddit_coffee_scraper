Chapter 1 On the eve of her wedding, Malayah Hudson discovered her fianc√©, Desmond Martinez, whom she thought was left disabled by a car accident, standing by the floor-to-ceiling window, passionately entwined with another woman. Resolute, she called her mother, ""Mom, I'm leaving the country in seven days. Can you help me make the arrangements?"" ""At last, you've come to your senses. Desmond never truly cared for you. Holding onto him won't lead to anything worthwhile,"" Holly Hudson's gentle voice carried a hint of relief. ""Come to Paris. We not only have the art you love but also plenty of charming gentlemen. You'll be swept off your feet."" ""Alright, I'll finish things up here and head over."" After the call, Malayah quietly walked from the living room to the bedroom door. Inside, the two had already moved to the bed. ""Desmond, you staged a car accident back then to break up with Malayah, pretending to be crippled and blind. I never thought she'd be so devoted, taking care of you all this time."" ""You're not planning to marry her, are you?"" Waverly Bell pouted beneath him, displeased. ""You should have always been mine."" ""Waverly, you're the only one I love. In seven days, I'll have her kidnapped. If she doesn't show up at the wedding, I can naturally have a new bride,"" Desmond murmured as he kissed Waverly's lips, but his words sent chills down Malayah‚Äôs spine. ""If she hadn't insisted on caring for me back then, I wouldn't have kept up this act for so long. I'm worn out."" Malayah couldn‚Äôt believe it was all a charade! She had returned drenched from the rain just to bring Desmond some coffee. Since the accident, his legs would ache on rainy days. Shivering slightly, her long hair stuck to her face. Compared to the warmth inside the bedroom, she seemed pitiful. Desmond's cold words shattered her heart completely. ""Waverly, hold on for seven more days, and I'll marry you."" With a loud ""Bang!"" the two inside the room quickly separated. Desmond's eyes snapped to the door. ""Who‚Äôs there?"" Malayah swallowed her tears. ""I accidentally spilled the coffee I made for you."" She crouched down, picking up the scattered glass shards. On hearing this, Desmond stiffened for a moment, then hurriedly pushed Waverly away, got dressed, and sat in his wheelchair, motioning for Waverly to wheel him out. He remembered he had to keep pretending to be blind. ""When did you get back? Waverly was just helping with some work, and I didn‚Äôt notice you,"" he kept his gaze above Malayah‚Äôs head, gripping the wheelchair tightly, probing as he spoke. Malayah wasn't fooled. She bit her lip, ""Just came in. You can carry on. I'll make more coffee."" The coffee was still hot, the glass shattered, staining her fingertips with blood. The spreading red was nothing compared to the pain in her heart. She had met Desmond at her graduation ceremony. He had been invited to speak as a successful alumnus. The moment he appeared, Malayah was struck by his presence. She pursued him fervently, joined his company, mirrored his interests, and naturally, they ended up together, until she mentioned marriage. The day after she brought up marriage, Desmond had the car accident. From the accident until now, three years had passed. During those three years, she had sacrificed everything, including her career, family, and dreams, to study alternative medicine and nutrition, striving to help Desmond walk again, regain his vision. Yet now, it was all an illusion! She looked down at her hands, once meant for sketching, now only covered in a thin layer of calluses. Clutching the glass shards tightly, she let the blood stain her fingertips. She raised her head and stared fiercely at the pair of traitors. Desmond frowned, irritated. ""I‚Äôve told you my legs and eyes will never heal. Why do you keep doing these things every day? Are you reminding me that I‚Äôm a cripple?"" Malayah stood there, silent and expressionless, staring at him. Throughout these three years, because of his condition, she had tolerated his mood swings and occasional outbursts. Falling from grace and unable to bear his impotence, his drastic change in behavior was somewhat understandable. Malayah forced a laugh. Her chest heaving with anger, she finally composed herself. ""Fine, if you don‚Äôt like it, I‚Äôll stop."" Desmond, we‚Äôre done. Desmond seemed surprised. Just as he was about to speak, Malayah had already turned toward the kitchen. She tossed the expensive ingredients she'd specifically bought into the trash. Since Desmond didn‚Äôt care about her efforts or her love, she decided to take it all back. She glanced at the calendar. March 27th was the wedding day. She had marked it with a little heart. Looking back now, it was bitterly ironic.

Chapter 2 Waverly Bell left her house and headed straight for the kitchen, where she raised an eyebrow at Malayah Hudson. ""Desmond still needs your care, Malayah."" Her tone was mocking, and her slightly open collar revealed faint marks on her neck. Malayah took a quick glance but remained unfazed. ""No need for you to worry."" Waverly scoffed and turned to leave. As soon as she closed the door, Malayah‚Äôs phone buzzed softly. She looked down to see a photo sent by Waverly. Desmond had Waverly in his arms, kissing her tenderly‚Äîa scene full of intimacy. Moreover, Desmond‚Äôs gaze was directed at the camera, filled with a tenderness Malayah hadn‚Äôt seen in the last three years. Her heart felt pierced, the pain overwhelming, making it hard to breathe. She clutched her chest as tears dripped into the sink. Years of affection and almost everything she had invested had led to this moment, leaving Malayah feeling as if her heart was being torn apart. ""Malayah, are you done yet? I'm exhausted; we need to rest. Come over and help me,"" Desmond called from the other room. Malayah entered to see Desmond sitting in his wheelchair, his gaze unfocused. He was acting, and it seemed a shame he hadn't won an Oscar for it. She looked at him coolly and said, ""It's been three years, and you still haven't learned how to get into bed?"" ‚ÄúWho stays stuck in despair as long as you do?‚Äù Desmond didn‚Äôt catch the sarcasm in her voice, only assuming she was tired of caring for him. ""Malayah, are you fed up with me now? Why did you propose to me in the first place? I'm just a wreck, a complete waste!"" His tone was agitated. In the past, Malayah would have immediately comforted him when he spoke like this. After hesitating for a few seconds, she helped Desmond into bed, but there was no trace of affection in her eyes. Once Desmond was in bed, he suddenly pulled her close, wrapping his arms around her tightly. His tone softened, ""I'm sorry, Malayah, I spoke out of turn. I didn't mean it; I just feel I‚Äôm not worthy of you in my current state."" ""Sorry, sorry..."" ""I've embarrassed you."" He always did this‚Äîafter venting, he would begin to apologize for his words and actions. Malayah's soft heart would always forgive him. She closed her eyes lightly, suppressing the indescribable emotions within her. After a while, she turned, her gaze falling instantly on the lipstick stain on his pajamas. It must have been from his kiss with Waverly, or perhaps intentionally left by her. Malayah took a deep breath. ""Rest well; I‚Äôll be sleeping in the study tonight."" With that, she left without looking back. Desmond instinctively tried to reach for her, but his hand was too slow, capturing only air. Watching Malayah leave without hesitation, an inexplicable frustration welled up within him. What did she mean by this? Three years had passed, and she wasn‚Äôt pretending anymore. Was she disgusted with him? He thought her love had no expiration date, but clearly, it was just shallow. Malayah returned to the study, sitting there through the night. Her mind was filled with memories of her time with Desmond. Over the past three years, she proposed five times. It was only last month that Desmond finally accepted. She had been ecstatic, arranging their wedding, setting a date for their photoshoot, joyfully writing invitations to their friends. Looking back now, it was all a joke she‚Äôd played on herself. Her supposed deep affection had only ever moved her, while Desmond didn't care at all. Unable to sleep, Malayah found herself with dark circles under her eyes the next morning. She was preparing breakfast when she received a call from the photographer, ""Miss Hudson, weren't you scheduled to take your wedding photos today? Why haven't you arrived?"" ""We won‚Äôt be taking wedding photos..."" Before she could finish, Desmond's voice came from nearby, ""Malayah, are you canceling because of my legs?"" He was bowing his head, his hand gripping his pant leg tightly. Malayah looked at him calmly and said, ""We‚Äôll be there shortly; please wait."" At the photo shoot location, Malayah emerged in a wedding dress while Desmond wore a suit. The photographer encouraged them to get closer, smiling, ""You two make a lovely couple."" Despite Desmond's disability, his appearance was flawless. Malayah remained silent, and Desmond discreetly glanced at her. For some reason, he felt a chill emanating from her. That morning, the regular cup of coffee was missing, and the breakfast she prepared was perfunctory. Eating it left a bad taste in his mouth. Photographer: ""Get a bit closer, you two. You're engaged, so why so distant?"" Malayah didn‚Äôt move. Desmond instinctively tilted his head and turned his wheelchair, trying to get closer to Malayah. Just then, his phone rang. He fumbled to take it out, glanced at it, and answered. A few seconds later, Desmond spoke apologetically, ""Malayah, there‚Äôs an urgent matter at the office. I need to leave right away. Could we postpone the wedding photos?"" ""Let's take them another day."" Malayah replied coolly, ""Go handle your work."" Desmond was swiftly escorted away, leaving Malayah watching his retreating figure. Her lips parted momentarily. Desmond, we'll never have wedding photos in this lifetime.

Chapter 3 The photographer stood motionless, watching the bride left behind. Malayah Hudson spoke coolly, ‚ÄúWe won‚Äôt be taking the wedding photos. I‚Äôll still cover the cost.‚Äù She left the photography set and went to her workplace to inform her boss of her resignation. She had five different part-time jobs, selected to accommodate her studies in chiropractic and nutrition. Leaving them was straightforward enough. Finally, she went to see Dereck Ray, the experienced chiropractor who had been mentoring her. With a warm smile, Dereck greeted her, ‚ÄúMalayah, you‚Äôre early today. Come on, I'll show you a new technique. It might help your boyfriend's leg.‚Äù Malayah offered a faint smile, ‚ÄúNo need, sir.‚Äù ‚ÄúOh? Did you two break up?‚Äù She shook her head, ‚ÄúNo, he just doesn't want me to treat him anymore.‚Äù Dereck hesitated, wanting to say more, but Malayah simply nodded. ‚ÄúThank you for everything these past few years.‚Äù For the past three years, Dereck had supported her through emotional breakdowns. ‚ÄúAh, there‚Äôs no need to thank me,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut don‚Äôt worry too much about his leg. He‚Äôll be able to stand on his own again.‚Äù Malayah nodded without expression. Yes, he would stand again, but not with her. Back home, she began packing up all the recipes she had developed over the years. Her study, once filled with easels and sketchbooks, was now crowded with books on anatomy, charts, and medical texts. It's often said that prolonged illness makes a person their own doctor; Malayah was just shy of qualifying for a medical license. As she packed, she stumbled upon a dusty box containing letters she‚Äôd once written to Desmond Martinez. There was a time when he loved her, replying to every letter with affection. Malayah recalled Desmond‚Äôs words when they first started dating: ‚ÄúIn this fast-paced world, you‚Äôre still writing love letters? That‚Äôs adorable, Malayah.‚Äù Spreading the letters across the table, she struck a match and watched as the flames consumed them, erasing all traces of her love. Meanwhile, her phone continued to ring. After the fire had fully burned out, she glanced at her phone. A slew of photos from Waverly Bell greeted her. They were wedding photos of Desmond and Waverly. As she swiped through the images, her heart grew heavier with each one. It felt as though a piece of her heart had been hollowed out, a chilling breeze blowing through the emptiness. The so-called ‚Äúbusiness matter‚Äù Desmond was attending to turned out to be a wedding photoshoot with Waverly. A solitary tear splashed onto her phone screen. Holding her phone, Malayah finally allowed herself to cry openly. For three years, she had endured Desmond‚Äôs indifference, while he showered his affections on another woman. Waverly's message taunted, ‚ÄúTake a good look at who Desmond truly loves.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just a distraction for him. If you had any sense, you‚Äôd step aside willingly.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe one marrying him can only be me.‚Äù Malayah lowered her eyes, wiping away her tears. ‚ÄúWaverly, as you wish.‚Äù Desmond didn‚Äôt come home that night. Malayah, however, didn‚Äôt confront him, quietly packing her belongings instead. She continued to sleep in the study. In the middle of the night, her phone rang; it was Desmond. ‚ÄúMalayah, I‚Äôm out discussing business and had a bit to drink. It‚Äôs quite late‚Äîcan you come pick me up?‚Äù ‚ÄúMalayah? You‚Äôre all I have. Can you come?‚Äù Malayah glanced at the time‚Äî3:30 a.m. What kind of business meeting goes this late into the night? She didn't call him out on the lie but instead got up, silently putting on her coat. ‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôll come get you.‚Äù

Chapter 4 The Twilight Bar buzzed with energy when Malayah Hudson arrived; the private room was drenched in neon lights, and the music thumped loudly. On stage, Desmond Martinez, who was typically confined to a wheelchair, sat on a high stool, strumming his guitar while singing love songs. He was free-spirited ‚Äî a side Malayah had never seen before. His gaze was tender as he looked at Waverly Bell, standing like a star beneath the stage lights. With a gentle smile, he spoke into the microphone, ""Waverly, I love you. Let's get married."" Malayah stood at the entrance, her legs feeling like lead, tears silently streaming down her cheeks. How could she reconcile three years of emotions? Love and hate intertwined within her mind, and she wished she could rush in and demand an explanation. Why couldn't he just tell her he didn't want to marry her, instead of shattering her heart? Was her love truly so worthless? The crowd erupted at Desmond's declaration. ""Kiss! Kiss!"" Waverly shyly bowed her head. Desmond set down his guitar, climbed down from the stage, and wrapped his arms around her waist, pulling her in for a kiss. The spectators cheered wildly. After the kiss, Desmond tidied Waverly‚Äôs clothes and hair. Then someone remarked loudly, ""Desmond, but your wedding is in six days; did Malayah agree to the breakup?"" ""She‚Äôs clung to you so desperately over these years. Will she let go easily?"" ""Yeah, she even went to the doctor for your leg, she was so pathetic. I still have that photo."" ""Desmond, why was she so easy to manipulate?"" Desmond simply held Waverly on the couch, shooting his wheelchair a disdainful glance, ""She chose to."" Malayah bit her lip until it nearly bled. She leaned against the wall, feeling weak, her mind blank. Yet, this time, there was a sense of inevitability. Her heart didn‚Äôt feel as shattered as before. Just like Desmond said, she chose this path. Even if she stumbled and got hurt along the way, there was no one else to blame. At that moment, someone suggested, ""Desmond, let‚Äôs play a game. Want to try it? Waiting for Malayah to arrive..."" Malayah steadied herself, then tapped on the partially open door to the private room. Her eyes settled on Desmond Martinez, who had resumed his place in the wheelchair. She walked over, ""Desmond, I came to take you home."" Suddenly, someone viciously kicked Desmond‚Äôs wheelchair, sending him tumbling to the floor. His rowdy friends chimed in, ""You‚Äôre Desmond‚Äôs girlfriend? Desmond just lost a bet, and we were going to make him drink as a penalty, but look at him, blind and crippled. Why don‚Äôt you drink for him?"" Malayah saw the table was already covered in opened bottles. She turned her gaze to Desmond, her eyes meeting his. She knew he could see. ""Desmond, what do you want?"" ""Malayah, you play, you pay."" Malayah let out a bitter laugh, tears pooling. What a phrase, ""You play, you pay."" This was Desmond‚Äôs chance to prove himself. He knew she was allergic to alcohol. In their most tender times, Desmond would protect her from drinking at gatherings, saying indulgently, ""With me here, my girlfriend never has to drink."" Malayah downed one bottle after another. The liquor was cold. Yet her heart burned, feeling like it was ready to burst into flames. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Desmond watching her the entire time, as if observing a performer. Was every moment of her supposed deep affection seen as entertainment by him? Perhaps Waverly was right; Desmond didn‚Äôt love her. It was all just a game. The people around urged her on while Desmond remained silent and detached, watching as she finished the drinks. Malayah staggered, her figure unsteady, and as she walked toward Desmond, someone tripped her, sending her sprawling to the ground, pain shooting through her body. ""Desmond, are you satisfied?""

Chapter 5 Malayah Hudson fainted. When she regained consciousness, she found herself in a hospital bed, an IV drip attached to her arm. Her skin itched slightly, making her want to scratch it. Before she could, a hand gently stopped her. A familiar, calm voice said, ""Don't scratch. I'll put some ointment on

When I was a Goldman analyst in IB, I was working with the principal investments group (GSIP) during my 2nd year.

I asked the PM one day how he actually sized his positions.

Did it involve working closely with the quant team to analyze all the Monte Carlo simulations and option Greeks?

Did it involve discussions with the economists on the macro team to understand the regime dynamics?

Did it involve going to conferences with the portfolio companies and taking management out for dinner?

He smirked, and told me: ‚Äúthat‚Äôs all bullshit dude.‚Äù

Here‚Äôs what he actually does.

. . .

It‚Äôs called the Kelly criterion and it basically gives you the optimal size to bet without blowing up your portfolio.

Kelly fraction = expected return / expected vol squared

That‚Äôs it.

So if you expect a stock to deliver 20% with a volatility of 40%, the Kelly fraction is 1.25 or 125% of your portfolio.

The PM told me he usually runs at 1/8 Kelly due to the large drawdowns in his tech names and the fund‚Äôs concentration limitations, so about 16% here.

He also mentioned this is the same exact formula his buddies at Viking, Coatue and Altimeter use. Except they run much higher Kelly fractions using leverage, and don‚Äôt have such tight position limits.

Apparently, Warren Buffet sizes using Kelly-like methods.

Ngl was smirking myself by the end of our convo.

. . .

Fast forward 12 years - happily retired with a wife in fashion (occasional runway), kid & dog - and this morning sipping coffee and writing this, I noticed something‚Ä¶

Kelly fraction = (expected return / expected vol) / expected vol
= expected sharpe / expected vol

Shit, that‚Äôs it?!

It just tells you to bet more when you have an edge (sharpe) and bet less when the game is riskier?

I laughed.

But it‚Äôs true, that‚Äôs basically what all the investors I highlighted did, and they got paid 7 & 8 figures based on an idea that even a 5th-grader can discover themselves.

That‚Äôs Wall Street for you.",1,1758284232.0,TheRaceTo10Million,2,0.67,False

Hey all :) I've never really thought to post here, but i've seen a few posts promoting some good local coffee shops so I thought I'd put this out for anyone interested <3 

Me and my buddy are just two coffee nerds who run a specialty coffee roasting business called *Duck Duck Coffee Roasters*. We roast out of *Fredericton New Brunswick* and we sell online (roast to order) as well as retail at a few stores in Freddy (bliss boutique) and Saint John (all listed on our website). 

Why we are different (not better - just different) than other local roasters is all in our sourcing and attention to detail regarding roast profiles; we love different single origin coffees and emphasizing the farms from which they come from, the unique varietals, the processing and experimentation that those farms practice, as well as fine tuning our roast profiles to ensure that all the characteristics of these coffee's shine through. All wrapp

If you're looking for a familiar cup, we've got you covered with familiar profiles, but if you're wanting something funky, fresh and different (Geisha's, yeast inoculated washed colombians anyone? Paraiso 92?), we offer something novel and fun!

We‚Äôve been riding in the car for the better part of \[one hour\], and Charlie has abjectly refused to tell me where we‚Äôre headed. Right after I‚Äôd finished my coffee, he‚Äôd practically pushed me out the door to the car. As I was getting into my seat, he placed a small black case into the rear sitting area as he got into the driver‚Äôs seat.

*What‚Äôs in the case? And why is he so excited?*

‚ÄúI think you might like this place, Kosie. If you want to experience some purely human pastimes, this is where you go.‚Äù

He steered to the right, towards a small building with a multitude of cars in front of it.

*Bold City Shooters? What is this place?*

Charlie parks the car, and I slowly get out while he reaches back for the small case. I hear loud bangs coming from behind the facility.

‚ÄúWhat is it you brought me here for?‚Äù I ask, my patience beginning to wane.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to partake in one of the most American things on Earth.‚Äù

I sigh at his theatrics. ‚ÄúAnd that is?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre gonna go shoot guns.‚Äù

*Guns? As in kinetic weaponry?*

‚ÄúYou brought me out here to use firearms?‚Äù

‚ÄúGreat idea, isn‚Äôt it? I had the thought last night, and I wanted to see if you liked it.‚Äù

He‚Äôs obviously very excited about this.

*Can‚Äôt hurt to try.*

I lash my tail and try bobbing my head to tell him I liked it. Charlie‚Äôs face splits with his smile.

We walk into the small building, and Charlie pays while I look at all the firearms racked on the walls behind the counter.

*There‚Äôs so many!*

‚ÄúAlright, I rented a Remington 700 and a Glock 40 for you to try out, along with enough ammo for what should be a few hours. Here, hold this, my arms are full.‚Äù

Charlie hands me a long thin weapon, surprisingly heavy for its size. I heft the firearm, inspecting it, and nearly drop it when Charlie yells.

‚ÄúWhoa! Kosif, stop!‚Äù He holds his arm out like he‚Äôs about to grab the gun from me.

I freeze. *Oh no. Did I screw up already?*

‚ÄúThat one‚Äôs on me. First rule of guns: if you‚Äôre not using them, point the barrel at the sky or the ground. No exceptions.‚Äù

I dip my head as my tail twitches in embarrassment. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never used a kinetics weapon. Sorry.‚Äù

‚ÄúHey, no problem. Just‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt do that again. Now let‚Äôs go shoot stuff.‚Äù

Charlie grabs two curved clamps, then we walk out the rear door into the actual range. Loud bangs constantly assault my ears, and I wince. My tail slowly sways back and forth. Charlie holds out one of the clamps to me.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll need this, unless you want to be deaf very early in life.‚Äù

I hold them for a moment, wondering what to do. Charlie slips his pair over his fleshy ears.

*Oh, these go over my earholes. Why don‚Äôt I catch on to these things faster?*

The ear covers squeeze my head gently, and the world outside goes nearly silent. Charlies waves his hand, beckoning me to follow him. He places his cargo onto a worn wooden table, and pops open the black case. Inside is a weapon like one of those he rented. It‚Äôs a small black firearm shaped like an \[L\], only slightly bigger than its rented counterpart. We sit down, and he shows me how to load and unload the gun I was handed, along with the other two. I also learn the two rules about guns.

First, the bad end of the boom stick only points to things I want to see through, and second, keep my booger hook off the bang switch until I‚Äôm ready to bring the hate.

After a few demonstrations, I get the hang of it and Charlies hands me a heavy box and points at an open stall. I bring the padded butt of the rifle to my shoulder like Charlie showed me. One claw goes under the barrel to aim, the other to the trigger. I lean my head down, shrugging my shoulder until my eye lines up with two metal blocks on the very end of the gun.

I sight a metal disc hanging from a chain far down the range. One eye closes automatically, and I line up the small metal blocks onto the target. My claw drifts to the trigger, and I pull. A bang penetrates through the ear covers, and the rifle kicks back with a surprising amount of force. Surprised, I take a step backwards, lowering the gun and turning to Charlie. He‚Äôs holding up two of his clawless ‚Äòthumbs‚Äô and smiling, so I must have done good. I look back down range.

My tail lashes in pride as I see the small disc swinging from the impact.

*I‚Äôm not too bad at this.*

The next few hours show me that I still have a lot to learn. I‚Äôm not too bad, but not all that great either. By the time we reach the end of our ammo, it‚Äôs about a 70-30 chance for whether I hit my target or not. The small firearms were hard to get used to, especially because I was afraid the gun would hit me in the face with how much recoil it had.

The ‚ÄòRemington‚Äô, Charlie called it, was where I seemed to shine. I certainly enjoyed using that one, and Charlie said we‚Äôll have to do this again soon. I, for one, agree.

We walk out of the range hungry and still getting used to having a sense of hearing again.",2,1758284106.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

Until 2023 I had a good life. Then I went through an 8-year breakup, and shortly after I lost my dad. Not long after that I was taken into hospital with compartment syndrome, and while I was there my mum died. I left hospital with no family left and, because of how my ex behaved over those eight years, I don‚Äôt have friends either. I sold the house I inherited and moved to London because I thought it might be the only way to rebuild.

I have two tiny Pomeranians, Rocky and Kendal, and I‚Äôm really struggling with everything on my own. Timing is key because they need walking and feeding and I need to work around that. I‚Äôm currently out of work because of my accident and I wear a foot brace. I can manage light work and I‚Äôm willing to try pretty much anything to get back on my feet.

Before all this I was very active and I loved art, music and fashion. I‚Äôve never felt this alone in my life. I‚Äôve tried to access services but the wait times are long. I‚Äôm a completely broken man who wants to rebuild. When I was 17 I stayed in London for a few months and managed to do so much, so I‚Äôm hoping I can find that energy again with the right people around me.

If anyone in London can help with:
	‚Ä¢	meeting for coffees or walks (dog-friendly places welcome),
	‚Ä¢	short shifts, odd jobs or recommendations for flexible work,
	‚Ä¢	dog sitting or walking help (even occasional),
	‚Ä¢	local groups for art, music or fashion where I could meet people,
	‚Ä¢	practical advice on short-term help and services in London,

please comment or DM. I‚Äôm trying to take small steps but I literally have nobody. Any help, ideas or contacts would mean the world.

Chapter 1
On the eve of her wedding, Malayah Hudson discovered her fianc√©, Desmond Martinez, whom she thought was left disabled by a car accident, standing by the floor-to-ceiling window, passionately entwined with another woman.
Resolute, she called her mother, ""Mom, I'm leaving the country in seven days. Can you help me make the arrangements?""
""At last, you've come to your senses. Desmond never truly cared for you. Holding onto him won't lead to anything worthwhile,"" Holly Hudson's gentle voice carried a hint of relief. ""Come to Paris. We not only have the art you love but also plenty of charming gentlemen. You'll be swept off your feet.""
""Alright, I'll finish things up here and head over.""
After the call, Malayah quietly walked from the living room to the bedroom door. Inside, the two had already moved to the bed.
""Desmond, you staged a car accident back then to break up with Malayah, pretending to be crippled and blind. I never thought she'd be so devoted, taking care of you all this time.""
""You're not planning to marry her, are you?"" Waverly Bell pouted beneath him, displeased. ""You should have always been mine.""
""Waverly, you're the only one I love. In seven days, I'll have her kidnapped. If she doesn't show up at the wedding, I can naturally have a new bride,"" Desmond murmured as he kissed Waverly's lips, but his words sent chills down Malayah‚Äôs spine. ""If she hadn't insisted on caring for me back then, I wouldn't have kept up this act for so long. I'm worn out.""
Malayah couldn‚Äôt believe it was all a charade!
She had returned drenched from the rain just to bring Desmond some coffee. Since the accident, his legs would ache on rainy days. Shivering slightly, her long hair stuck to her face. Compared to the warmth inside the bedroom, she seemed pitiful.
Desmond's cold words shattered her heart completely. ""Waverly, hold on for seven more days, and I'll marry you.""
With a loud ""Bang!"" the two inside the room quickly separated.
Desmond's eyes snapped to the door. ""Who‚Äôs there?""
Malayah swallowed her tears. ""I accidentally spilled the coffee I made for you.""
She crouched down, picking up the scattered glass shards.
On hearing this, Desmond stiffened for a moment, then hurriedly pushed Waverly away, got dressed, and sat in his wheelchair, motioning for Waverly to wheel him out. He remembered he had to keep pretending to be blind.
""When did you get back? Waverly was just helping with some work, and I didn‚Äôt notice you,"" he kept his gaze above Malayah‚Äôs head, gripping the wheelchair tightly, probing as he spoke.
Malayah wasn't fooled. She bit her lip, ""Just came in. You can carry on. I'll make more coffee.""
The coffee was still hot, the glass shattered, staining her fingertips with blood. The spreading red was nothing compared to the pain in her heart.
She had met Desmond at her graduation ceremony. He had been invited to speak as a successful alumnus. The moment he appeared, Malayah was struck by his presence.
She pursued him fervently, joined his company, mirrored his interests, and naturally, they ended up together, until she mentioned marriage.
The day after she brought up marriage, Desmond had the car accident.
From the accident until now, three years had passed.
During those three years, she had sacrificed everything, including her career, family, and dreams, to study alternative medicine and nutrition, striving to help Desmond walk again, regain his vision.
Yet now, it was all an illusion!
She looked down at her hands, once meant for sketching, now only covered in a thin layer of calluses.
Clutching the glass shards tightly, she let the blood stain her fingertips. She raised her head and stared fiercely at the pair of traitors.
Desmond frowned, irritated. ""I‚Äôve told you my legs and eyes will never heal. Why do you keep doing these things every day? Are you reminding me that I‚Äôm a cripple?""
Malayah stood there, silent and expressionless, staring at him.
Throughout these three years, because of his condition, she had tolerated his mood swings and occasional outbursts. Falling from grace and unable to bear his impotence, his drastic change in behavior was somewhat understandable.
Malayah forced a laugh. Her chest heaving with anger, she finally composed herself. ""Fine, if you don‚Äôt like it, I‚Äôll stop.""
Desmond, we‚Äôre done.
Desmond seemed surprised. Just as he was about to speak, Malayah had already turned toward the kitchen.
She tossed the expensive ingredients she'd specifically bought into the trash.
Since Desmond didn‚Äôt care about her efforts or her love, she decided to take it all back.
She glanced at the calendar. March 27th was the wedding day. She had marked it with a little heart.
Looking back now, it was bitterly ironic.

Chapter 2
Waverly Bell left her house and headed straight for the kitchen, where she raised an eyebrow at Malayah Hudson. ""Desmond still needs your care, Malayah.""
Her tone was mocking, and her slightly open collar revealed faint marks on her neck. Malayah took a quick glance but remained unfazed. ""No need for you to worry.""
Waverly scoffed and turned to leave. As soon as she closed the door, Malayah‚Äôs phone buzzed softly. She looked down to see a photo sent by Waverly.
Desmond had Waverly in his arms, kissing her tenderly‚Äîa scene full of intimacy. Moreover, Desmond‚Äôs gaze was directed at the camera, filled with a tenderness Malayah hadn‚Äôt seen in the last three years. Her heart felt pierced, the pain overwhelming, making it hard to breathe.
She clutched her chest as tears dripped into the sink. Years of affection and almost everything she had invested had led to this moment, leaving Malayah feeling as if her heart was being torn apart.
""Malayah, are you done yet? I'm exhausted; we need to rest. Come over and help me,"" Desmond called from the other room.
Malayah entered to see Desmond sitting in his wheelchair, his gaze unfocused. He was acting, and it seemed a shame he hadn't won an Oscar for it.
She looked at him coolly and said, ""It's been three years, and you still haven't learned how to get into bed?""
‚ÄúWho stays stuck in despair as long as you do?‚Äù
Desmond didn‚Äôt catch the sarcasm in her voice, only assuming she was tired of caring for him. ""Malayah, are you fed up with me now? Why did you propose to me in the first place? I'm just a wreck, a complete waste!""
His tone was agitated. In the past, Malayah would have immediately comforted him when he spoke like this. After hesitating for a few seconds, she helped Desmond into bed, but there was no trace of affection in her eyes.
Once Desmond was in bed, he suddenly pulled her close, wrapping his arms around her tightly. His tone softened, ""I'm sorry, Malayah, I spoke out of turn. I didn't mean it; I just feel I‚Äôm not worthy of you in my current state.""
""Sorry, sorry...""
""I've embarrassed you.""
He always did this‚Äîafter venting, he would begin to apologize for his words and actions. Malayah's soft heart would always forgive him. She closed her eyes lightly, suppressing the indescribable emotions within her.
After a while, she turned, her gaze falling instantly on the lipstick stain on his pajamas. It must have been from his kiss with Waverly, or perhaps intentionally left by her.
Malayah took a deep breath. ""Rest well; I‚Äôll be sleeping in the study tonight.""
With that, she left without looking back.
Desmond instinctively tried to reach for her, but his hand was too slow, capturing only air. Watching Malayah leave without hesitation, an inexplicable frustration welled up within him.
What did she mean by this?
Three years had passed, and she wasn‚Äôt pretending anymore. Was she disgusted with him?
He thought her love had no expiration date, but clearly, it was just shallow.
Malayah returned to the study, sitting there through the night. Her mind was filled with memories of her time with Desmond.
Over the past three years, she proposed five times. It was only last month that Desmond finally accepted. She had been ecstatic, arranging their wedding, setting a date for their photoshoot, joyfully writing invitations to their friends.
Looking back now, it was all a joke she‚Äôd played on herself. Her supposed deep affection had only ever moved her, while Desmond didn't care at all.
Unable to sleep, Malayah found herself with dark circles under her eyes the next morning. She was preparing breakfast when she received a call from the photographer, ""Miss Hudson, weren't you scheduled to take your wedding photos today? Why haven't you arrived?""
""We won‚Äôt be taking wedding photos...""
Before she could finish, Desmond's voice came from nearby, ""Malayah, are you canceling because of my legs?""
He was bowing his head, his hand gripping his pant leg tightly.
Malayah looked at him calmly and said, ""We‚Äôll be there shortly; please wait.""
At the photo shoot location, Malayah emerged in a wedding dress while Desmond wore a suit. The photographer encouraged them to get closer, smiling, ""You two make a lovely couple.""
Despite Desmond's disability, his appearance was flawless.
Malayah remained silent, and Desmond discreetly glanced at her. For some reason, he felt a chill emanating from her.
That morning, the regular cup of coffee was missing, and the breakfast she prepared was perfunctory. Eating it left a bad taste in his mouth.
Photographer: ""Get a bit closer, you two. You're engaged, so why so distant?""
Malayah didn‚Äôt move. Desmond instinctively tilted his head and turned his wheelchair, trying to get closer to Malayah.
Just then, his phone rang. He fumbled to take it out, glanced at it, and answered.
A few seconds later, Desmond spoke apologetically, ""Malayah, there‚Äôs an urgent matter at the office. I need to leave right away. Could we postpone the wedding photos?""
""Let's take them another day.""
Malayah replied coolly, ""Go handle your work.""
Desmond was swiftly escorted away, leaving Malayah watching his retreating figure. Her lips parted momentarily.
Desmond, we'll never have wedding photos in this lifetime.

Chapter 3
The photographer stood motionless, watching the bride left behind.
Malayah Hudson spoke coolly, ‚ÄúWe won‚Äôt be taking the wedding photos. I‚Äôll still cover the cost.‚Äù
She left the photography set and went to her workplace to inform her boss of her resignation. She had five different part-time jobs, selected to accommodate her studies in chiropractic and nutrition. Leaving them was straightforward enough.
Finally, she went to see Dereck Ray, the experienced chiropractor who had been mentoring her.
With a warm smile, Dereck greeted her, ‚ÄúMalayah, you‚Äôre early today. Come on, I'll show you a new technique. It might help your boyfriend's leg.‚Äù
Malayah offered a faint smile, ‚ÄúNo need, sir.‚Äù
‚ÄúOh? Did you two break up?‚Äù
She shook her head, ‚ÄúNo, he just doesn't want me to treat him anymore.‚Äù
Dereck hesitated, wanting to say more, but Malayah simply nodded. ‚ÄúThank you for everything these past few years.‚Äù
For the past three years, Dereck had supported her through emotional breakdowns.
‚ÄúAh, there‚Äôs no need to thank me,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut don‚Äôt worry too much about his leg. He‚Äôll be able to stand on his own again.‚Äù
Malayah nodded without expression. Yes, he would stand again, but not with her.
Back home, she began packing up all the recipes she had developed over the years. Her study, once filled with easels and sketchbooks, was now crowded with books on anatomy, charts, and medical texts. It's often said that prolonged illness makes a person their own doctor; Malayah was just shy of qualifying for a medical license.
As she packed, she stumbled upon a dusty box containing letters she‚Äôd once written to Desmond Martinez. There was a time when he loved her, replying to every letter with affection.
Malayah recalled Desmond‚Äôs words when they first started dating: ‚ÄúIn this fast-paced world, you‚Äôre still writing love letters? That‚Äôs adorable, Malayah.‚Äù
Spreading the letters across the table, she struck a match and watched as the flames consumed them, erasing all traces of her love.
Meanwhile, her phone continued to ring.
After the fire had fully burned out, she glanced at her phone.
A slew of photos from Waverly Bell greeted her. They were wedding photos of Desmond and Waverly.
As she swiped through the images, her heart grew heavier with each one. It felt as though a piece of her heart had been hollowed out, a chilling breeze blowing through the emptiness.
The so-called ‚Äúbusiness matter‚Äù Desmond was attending to turned out to be a wedding photoshoot with Waverly.
A solitary tear splashed onto her phone screen.
Holding her phone, Malayah finally allowed herself to cry openly.
For three years, she had endured Desmond‚Äôs indifference, while he showered his affections on another woman.
Waverly's message taunted, ‚ÄúTake a good look at who Desmond truly loves.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just a distraction for him. If you had any sense, you‚Äôd step aside willingly.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe one marrying him can only be me.‚Äù
Malayah lowered her eyes, wiping away her tears. ‚ÄúWaverly, as you wish.‚Äù
Desmond didn‚Äôt come home that night. Malayah, however, didn‚Äôt confront him, quietly packing her belongings instead. She continued to sleep in the study.
In the middle of the night, her phone rang; it was Desmond. ‚ÄúMalayah, I‚Äôm out discussing business and had a bit to drink. It‚Äôs quite late‚Äîcan you come pick me up?‚Äù
‚ÄúMalayah? You‚Äôre all I have. Can you come?‚Äù
Malayah glanced at the time‚Äî3:30 a.m.
What kind of business meeting goes this late into the night?
She didn't call him out on the lie but instead got up, silently putting on her coat. ‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôll come get you.‚Äù

Chapter 4
The Twilight Bar buzzed with energy when Malayah Hudson arrived; the private room was drenched in neon lights, and the music thumped loudly. On stage, Desmond Martinez, who was typically confined to a wheelchair, sat on a high stool, strumming his guitar while singing love songs. He was free-spirited ‚Äî a side Malayah had never seen before.
His gaze was tender as he looked at Waverly Bell, standing like a star beneath the stage lights. With a gentle smile, he spoke into the microphone, ""Waverly, I love you. Let's get married.""
Malayah stood at the entrance, her legs feeling like lead, tears silently streaming down her cheeks. How could she reconcile three years of emotions? Love and hate intertwined within her mind, and she wished she could rush in and demand an explanation. Why couldn't he just tell her he didn't want to marry her, instead of shattering her heart? Was her love truly so worthless?
The crowd erupted at Desmond's declaration.
""Kiss! Kiss!""
Waverly shyly bowed her head. Desmond set down his guitar, climbed down from the stage, and wrapped his arms around her waist, pulling her in for a kiss. The spectators cheered wildly.
After the kiss, Desmond tidied Waverly‚Äôs clothes and hair. Then someone remarked loudly, ""Desmond, but your wedding is in six days; did Malayah agree to the breakup?""
""She‚Äôs clung to you so desperately over these years. Will she let go easily?""
""Yeah, she even went to the doctor for your leg, she was so pathetic. I still have that photo.""
""Desmond, why was she so easy to manipulate?""
Desmond simply held Waverly on the couch, shooting his wheelchair a disdainful glance, ""She chose to.""
Malayah bit her lip until it nearly bled. She leaned against the wall, feeling weak, her mind blank. Yet, this time, there was a sense of inevitability. Her heart didn‚Äôt feel as shattered as before. Just like Desmond said, she chose this path. Even if she stumbled and got hurt along the way, there was no one else to blame.
At that moment, someone suggested, ""Desmond, let‚Äôs play a game. Want to try it? Waiting for Malayah to arrive...""
Malayah steadied herself, then tapped on the partially open door to the private room. Her eyes settled on Desmond Martinez, who had resumed his place in the wheelchair. She walked over, ""Desmond, I came to take you home.""
Suddenly, someone viciously kicked Desmond‚Äôs wheelchair, sending him tumbling to the floor. His rowdy friends chimed in, ""You‚Äôre Desmond‚Äôs girlfriend? Desmond just lost a bet, and we were going to make him drink as a penalty, but look at him, blind and crippled. Why don‚Äôt you drink for him?""
Malayah saw the table was already covered in opened bottles. She turned her gaze to Desmond, her eyes meeting his. She knew he could see.
""Desmond, what do you want?""
""Malayah, you play, you pay.""
Malayah let out a bitter laugh, tears pooling. What a phrase, ""You play, you pay.""
This was Desmond‚Äôs chance to prove himself. He knew she was allergic to alcohol. In their most tender times, Desmond would protect her from drinking at gatherings, saying indulgently, ""With me here, my girlfriend never has to drink.""
Malayah downed one bottle after another. The liquor was cold. Yet her heart burned, feeling like it was ready to burst into flames.
Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Desmond watching her the entire time, as if observing a performer. Was every moment of her supposed deep affection seen as entertainment by him? Perhaps Waverly was right; Desmond didn‚Äôt love her. It was all just a game.
The people around urged her on while Desmond remained silent and detached, watching as she finished the drinks. Malayah staggered, her figure unsteady, and as she walked toward Desmond, someone tripped her, sending her sprawling to the ground, pain shooting through her body.
""Desmond, are you satisfied?""

Chapter 5
Malayah Hudson fainted.
When she regained consciousness, she found herself in a hospital bed, an IV drip attached to her arm. Her skin itched slightly, making her want to scratch it. Before she could, a hand gently stopped her.
A familiar, calm voice said, ""Don't scratch. I'll put some ointment on

I've been camping and hiking for over a decade now, and I've learned that having the right gear can make or break your outdoor experience. Today, I want to share my thoughts on finding the perfect electric kettle for your adventures.

Last month, I went on a week-long camping trip, and my new electric kettle was an absolute game-changer. After trying countless options over the years, I finally found one that checks all the boxes. You can check it out here: https://athometouch.com/electric-kettle

What makes an electric kettle ideal for outdoor trips? Here's what I've learned:

1. Durability: You need something that can handle being knocked around in your backpack. Stainless steel is your best friend here - it's practically indestructible.

2. Capacity: For solo trips, 1-1.5 liters is perfect. If you're camping with friends, go for 2 liters or more. Trust me, you don't want to keep refilling when everyone's dying for their morning coffee.

3. Power efficiency: Look for kettles that heat up quickly and maintain temperature. This saves your portable power bank's juice.

4. Safety features: Auto shut-off is non-negotiable. When you're distracted by that stunning sunrise, you don't want to worry about your kettle overheating.

My current go-to (which you can find here: https://athometouch.com/electric-kettle) has all these features plus temperature control - perfect for both coffee and different types of tea.

Pro tips from my experience:
- Get one with a wide mouth for easy cleaning
- Look for concealed heating elements
- Consider the weight - every ounce matters when you're hiking
- Cordless models with detachable bases are super convenient

I've found that portable electric kettles are fantastic for:
- Making instant meals
- Brewing coffee/tea
- Purifying water (just boil for 1-2 minutes)
- Warming up after a cold day
- Quick clean-up (hot water + biodegradable soap = done!)

Remember, while traditional campfire brewing is great, sometimes weather doesn't cooperate, or you might be in a no-fire zone. That's when a reliable electric kettle becomes your best friend.

I use mine at home too - it's not just for outdoor trips. Perfect for quick hot drinks or instant noodles when you're too lazy to use the stove.

Before heading out, always test your kettle with your power source. Some portable batteries might not provide enough juice for certain models.

Hope this helps you find the perfect camping companion! Drop a comment if you have any questions - I'm always happy to share more tips from my outdoor adventures.

I‚Äôm a man in my late thirties. 

I‚Äôve been looking back at my friendships with two or three or so women who have got too close to me, no sex, but flirtyness. Two in particular ended up in them getting divorced. I‚Äôve been thinking maybe I contributed to that and I might be a bad person? Let me know what you think.

So I‚Äôve always been a bit sexually confused, and the first friend and me bonded over the internet about a show we both like. We had coffee and we met up a few times, mainly phone chats and internet forum stuff.
She chatted about her husband and I chatted about my life problems. Let‚Äôs say for the sake of argument I am basically gay. We‚Äôd sort of look at guys together and it would get sexy in that way, rather than PIV actual affairs. We‚Äôd also be quite emotionally close and it was every day emails and chatting.
Eventually I now think she had a crush on me, and she ended up getting divorced.

For some reason I feel like it was my fault and I don‚Äôt know why. This has happened twice now, at least. I think my female friends get attracted to me and also I‚Äôm kind of flirting with them too so it‚Äôs my fault.

So she‚Äôs talking to him and deleting messages as she‚Äôs talking back to back. I happened to be on this side seeing those messages. I saw him saying things like I want to feel your hand through the phone, having you in my arms was the best time of my life and constantly praising her. Although she was not flirting back but she didn‚Äôt stop him either. And when he asked her for a coffee she says ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt say no to that‚Äù. And when I confronted her she says she was just deleting messages because he  was apologizing for pushing her to get into a relationship with him. And she was deleting the messages because he was from the past and just didn‚Äôt wanted me to see the messages. 
She accepted that she was wrong and apologized ( I don‚Äôt think she had a choice). Oh and I texted this guy ‚ÄúYou know I am married right?‚Äù (from her own account). Following this message she immediately proceeds to change all her social media passwords. And says that I am controlling her, policing her, invading her privacy, ‚Äúyou  messaged him and then acted like I am the problem, that‚Äôs hypocrisy ‚Äù-HER WORDS, ‚ÄúI am not your possession‚Äù - HER EXACT WORDS AGAIN, ‚ÄúI am not your possession.

1nl1jlw,https://www.reddit.com/r/nonfictionbookclub/comments/1nl1jlw/i_read_40_books_last_year_heres_what_worked_and/,I read 40+ books last year - Here's what worked and what didn't,"t year I set an ambitious goal to read one book per week. I ended up finishing 44 books across fiction, non-fiction, and self-improvement genres.

Here's everything that worked, everything that failed, and the surprising lessons I learned about reading in 2024.

What DIDN'T work:

Book summary apps are overrated. I tried Blinkist, Shortform, and several other summary apps thinking they'd help me consume more content faster. Big mistake. These apps give you the illusion of learning without actual comprehension. You remember facts for maybe a week, then it's gone.

Speed reading techniques are BS. All those speed reading methods online are mostly garbage. I spent weeks trying different techniques and apps (tried several on both iOS and Android), but faster reading meant worse comprehension. Sometimes slower is actually faster.

Reading only self-improvement books. I burned out hard trying to read only ""productive"" books. By month 6,¬†**I was forcing myself through business and self-improvement titles that felt like homework. Variety is crucial for sustained reading.**

Digital-only reading. I'm a tech person, so I started with just Kindle and reading apps on my phone. While convenient, I found myself getting distracted by notifications and other apps. Physical books kept me focused longer.

What ACTUALLY worked:

The 25% rule. If I wasn't engaged after 25% of any book, I'd quit and move on. This single rule increased my completion rate dramatically. Life's too short for boring books.

Mixed format approach

* Physical books for deep focus sessions
* Audiobooks for commutes and walks
* E-books (iOS Kindle app) for travel
* Summary apps only for books I'd already read to review key points

Genre rotation system. I alternated between fiction, non-fiction, biography, and self-improvement books. This kept reading fresh and prevented burnout from any single category.

Note-taking apps integration. I used Obsidian (available on both Android and iOS) to create connected notes between books. Linking ideas across different books created deeper understanding than reading in isolation.

Morning reading ritual. 30-45 minutes every morning with coffee before checking any apps or social media. This became a sacred time that I protected fiercely.

Podcasts as book replacements. I love podcasts and using them as content was pretty good. I especially liked it when people talked about their experience on how they applied the book.

Podcast supplementation (the right way). Instead of replacing books with podcasts, I found podcasts where authors discussed their books in detail. This reinforced learning without replacing the deep reading experience.

Reading 50+ books taught me that the goal isn't consuming more content it's building a better thinking system. The best self-improvement comes from deeply understanding fewer ideas rather than superficially knowing many. It's better to read 10 good books again and again than to read 100 books without understanding any of its principles.

For anyone starting their reading journey:¬†**Forget the apps promising shortcuts. Get comfortable books in whatever format works for you, quit the boring ones ruthlessly, and focus on understanding over speed.**

Usage non competitive gaming and intensive (and fast... and somehow brutal) typing. Dev here, so a LOT of the same keys.

Requirements:  
\- full keyboard. 100% with separated numpad (like k70). No compact, modern, or any of the, imho nonsensical, keyboard (no ""ergonomic"", wave or other strange form factor)  
\- no low profile  
\- sturdy. I'm fed up with changing keyboard every 2 years and passing 3 months to get used to the new feeling before beeing efficient  
\- a good press feeling (so, no analog, no linear switch)  
\- repair friendly. No proprietary keycap model. No fuly soldered switches you have to all unsoldered to clean the motherboard under one switch because 2 drops of coffee fall on the wrong place (hello k70).  
\- AZERTY or BEPO layout

Preferably:  
\- relatively silent  
\- media keys  
\- no more than 200‚Ç¨ TTC  
\- sturdy keycaps. I insist but I'm at more than 3 changes for the keys I used the most (space, enter....) in 3 years due to broken plastic attaches and now most of the keycap tends to ""jump"" out of socket regulary  
\- frame on the heavy side. It's a work tool, not something I'll move to use on my sofa

Optional:  
\- RGB. Mostly useless but might be enjoyable once in a while  
\- windows key lock. Same as above  
\- wireless. Same reasoning  
\- programmatible keys. All in all I found going out of my way to press a programmatible key which write ""function"" slower than typing the whole word but...

Recent history (less than 10 years):  
\- 2 apex m800 (fond memory but way too brittle)  
\- One ""high end"" logitech I hated (can't remember the model). The worst keyboard I used this last 20 years.  
\- 3 K70 (2 silence, 1 brown). I like the keyboard and the feeling of the switches. But too fragile and impossible to repair without spending 20 hours to unsolder and resolder all the switches

Regarding the techno I'm open. I heard mixed things about magnetic. Mechanical is a sure value as long as it offers a reasonnable middle ground (brown are great, clear too. I can accept green). Never tried optical so no opinion

1nl1hnx,https://www.reddit.com/r/micahwrites/comments/1nl1hnx/ecosystem/,Ecosystem,"It was supposed to be a fun weekend in the woods. The four of us had rented a little house with a backyard that opened onto six thousand acres of forest, or something like that. Honestly I hadn‚Äôt paid that much attention to the details. Amelia had said, ‚ÄúDo you want to go on a trip,‚Äù and I had said yes. It could have been swimming with sharks or rock climbing or skydiving, and I would have said yes. She was always the planner. I was just the guy who went along with the plans.

It was us and another couple, Mateo and Allie. Allie and Amelia had known each other since middle school. They were both big into glamping, which as far as I could tell meant wilderness trips that also had hot tubs available at the end of the day. I‚Äôd always done the tent-camping, sleep-on-the-ground, cook-meals-unevenly-over-a-fire kind of thing, but since the first time Amelia had taken me glamping I had to admit that it was a lot more comfortable. And the food was better.

I kind of wish we had been tent camping on this trip, though. It wouldn‚Äôt have made anything better, but it would have made it faster. Sometimes that‚Äôs the best you can hope for.

It started out perfectly well. The cabin was this great little place, rustic enough to be homey but modern enough to actually keep the air conditioning in and the bugs out. The main room had comfortable couches and huge windows looking out over the forest, which was as wild and inviting as promised. A large wooden deck wrapped around the side and back of the house, with stairs that led down to a path winding off into the forest.

‚ÄúSays here that‚Äôs the private spur to the white loop trail,‚Äù said Mateo, reading from a small booklet he had picked up from the table. ‚ÄúSix miles, easy circle. Want to get a quick hike in before dinner?‚Äù

Allie put a finger to her chin in a mock thinking gesture. ‚ÄúWe could‚Äîor we could just get in the hot tub.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe can do that after we get back!‚Äù protested Mateo. ‚ÄúWe can sit in the hot tub after the sun sets. We can‚Äôt go hiking in the dark.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt fix the hot tub in the dark, either,‚Äù said Allie.

‚ÄúWhat makes you think it‚Äôs broken?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat makes you think it works?‚Äù she countered. ‚ÄúPlus even if it‚Äôs perfect, it‚Äôs never easy figuring one of these things out the first time. They‚Äôre all different, they‚Äôre all finicky, and they‚Äôre all much more annoying to figure out in the dark.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe came here for the hiking, though, right?‚Äù Mateo looked to me and Amelia for help, but to no avail. Amelia was clearly siding with her longtime friend, and honestly I thought Allie had made a solid point, too. Besides, we‚Äôd been in the car for hours to get here. I was feeling like a soak in the hot water would do me a lot more good than a sweaty walk over uneven ground.

Mateo saw the expressions on our faces and raised his hands in defeat. ‚ÄúOr we could make sure the hot tub works. You know, I was just thinking that we should probably check on that first thing on our hiking weekend. Clearly the best way to kick it off.‚Äù

Allie gave him a kiss. ‚ÄúI accept your reluctant surrender. Petulance is a surprisingly good look on you. I don‚Äôt know how you do it.‚Äù

‚ÄúRugged good looks and lumberjack charm,‚Äù he told her as they disappeared out the back door to investigate the hot tub.

‚ÄúShall we go put on our suits?‚Äù Amelia asked me.

‚ÄúSuits?‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI was planning to just skinny dip. Who can see us way out here?‚Äù

‚ÄúAllie and Mateo, for two. Go put your trunks on.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat if I didn‚Äôt bring any?‚Äù

‚ÄúThen Mateo can have a hiking buddy after all, and Allie and I will enjoy the hot tub all by ourselves.‚Äù

‚ÄúEnjoy it like how? I could set up a camera.‚Äù

‚ÄúI will throw your phone in the water,‚Äù Amelia warned me.

‚ÄúDestroying cell phones at the remote cabin in the woods? I‚Äôve seen movies with that plot. They never end well,‚Äù I said.

It seemed very funny at the time.

The hot tub, much to Mateo‚Äôs annoyance, started with the push of a single button and rapidly heated to the perfect temperature. I ignored his grumbling and sank gratefully into the water. I was looking forward to the hiking as much as he was, but Allie was right: this was the way to kick off the weekend.

We stayed in the hot tub until well after the sun had set, drinking beers and arguing over what the sounds from the forest were. The hooting of the owls was clear enough, even for city people like us, but everything else was open to debate. Amelia insisted that the long, drawn-own *creeee* noise was from frogs, while I insisted it was crickets. There was a shuffling, grunting noise at one point that Mateo perked up at.

‚ÄúThose are wild pigs,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúYou sure it‚Äôs not a bear?‚Äù Allie asked uncertainly.

He shook his head. ‚ÄúDefinitely pigs. They‚Äôre hunting. That means there‚Äôs good mushrooms nearby.‚Äù

‚ÄúOr at least there were, until feral pigs ate them,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll see!‚Äù said Mateo. ‚ÄúYou ever have chicken of the woods? I bet we can find some tomorrow. It‚Äôs delicious.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs still there tomorrow, doesn‚Äôt that mean that the pig rejected it?‚Äù Allie asked. ‚ÄúIf a pig won‚Äôt eat it, I‚Äôm not going to, either. Especially because they probably tasted it first. I‚Äôm DEFINITELY not eating something a pig licked.‚Äù

‚ÄúI will accept your apologies tomorrow when I cook the chicken of the woods I find, and you all agree it‚Äôs the best thing you‚Äôve ever tasted,‚Äù said Mateo.

‚ÄúThat a pig licked,‚Äù said Amelia. We all laughed, even Mateo.

All of a sudden there was a shriek from the woods. It was pitched higher than any human voice I‚Äôd ever heard, but it carried an unmistakable note of terror. We all looked at each other uncomfortably.

‚ÄúFox, maybe?‚Äù said Amelia. ‚ÄúThey scream really weirdly sometimes.‚Äù

There was a short silence. We were all listening, but all there was to hear was the background noise of the forest. Nothing followed the scream.

‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre really only supposed to stay in hot tubs for like twenty minutes anyway,‚Äù said Allie. We all wrapped up in towels and hurried inside. The night air was suddenly colder than it had been.

Indoors, sealed away from the outdoors in a well-lit room, the danger we‚Äôd all felt rapidly faded away. We were soon embroiled in drinking, card games and arguments over music, until we finally staggered off to bed. Amelia and I were both pleasantly drunk, and we fell asleep wrapped in the blankets and each other‚Äôs arms, far from any thoughts of the forest and whatever we might have heard in it.

It was past ten o‚Äôclock when I woke up the next morning. Amelia was still asleep, but when I wandered out to the main room, I found Allie in the kitchen, clearly also having just woken up.

‚ÄúMateo still asleep?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúNo, he was gone when I woke up. I figured I‚Äôd find him out here, but I guess he must have gotten up early and gone for a walk.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe went to go find that chicken of the woods,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWanted to pull off the parts that the pigs had chewed on before the rest of us saw.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhatever he finds, I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll hear all about it when he gets back!‚Äù Allie said. ‚ÄúFirst we wouldn‚Äôt go walking with him yesterday, then we all slept in today. Poor guy really wanted to get into the woods. If he finds anything cool you know he‚Äôs going to rub it in our faces.‚Äù

We made coffee, poured cereal and sat around to wait. Eventually Amelia woke up and joined us, so we kept chatting while she finished her breakfast as well.

By the time we‚Äôd finished the pot of coffee, it was noon and there was still no sign of Mateo.

‚ÄúI sent him a text like an hour ago,‚Äù said Allie. ‚ÄúI tried calling, and he‚Äôs not picking up.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs probably just got bad reception,‚Äù Amelia reassured her. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the middle of the woods, after all.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut what if he‚Äôs hurt and he can‚Äôt call?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs fine. Still, what did he mention yesterday, the white loop?‚Äù Amelia picked up the trail map from the table and looked at it. ‚ÄúYeah, so it‚Äôs like six miles. You got up around ten, right? So it makes sense that he‚Äôd still be out there.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Yeah,‚Äù said Allie. She turned her coffee cup around in her hands a few times. ‚ÄúStill. I‚Äôm gonna go look.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll come with you,‚Äù said Amelia. I was already standing up to go get my socks and shoes.

We followed the path down from the back porch and into the forest. The trees here were huge, towering over us like massive sentinels from a forgotten land. The air smelled earthy and oddly sweet. I studied the dirt path for footprints or other signs of passage. I realized I had no idea what I was looking for.

‚ÄúMateo? Mateo!‚Äù Allie called. There was no response.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve still got signal here, at least,‚Äù said Amelia. She called Mateo‚Äôs number, but it went to voicemail.

After a few minutes, the path forked. A double-ended white arrow was painted on the tree in front of us.

‚ÄúI guess we‚Äôre done with the spur,‚Äù Amelia said. ‚ÄúWhich way do you want to go?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe should split up,‚Äù said Allie.

‚ÄúAbsolutely not.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe have to! Think about it. We don‚Äôt know which way he went. If he lost his phone or something and we go the same way he did, then he‚Äôll get back here without us ever seeing him. And if he goes back to the house and stays there, maybe that‚Äôs fine, but if he comes out looking for us, we could end up going in circles after each other forever! Look, I‚Äôll go this way, you two go that way, and we can just stay in contact by phone.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou two go together, and I‚Äôll go solo.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs this some macho thing?‚Äù demanded Amelia.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs physics,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI can lift Mateo by myself if I have to. Can either of you do that?‚Äù

Amelia frowned and narrowed her eyes at me. ‚ÄúStill sounds like a macho thing, but fine, that‚Äôs a valid point.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll check in while we walk. Obviously call if you find him, but otherwise we‚Äôll check in every fifteen minutes or so. We should meet up in the middle in about an hour.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe could just stay on the phone.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got to keep our eyes and ears open in case he did wander off the path somewhere. It would suck to walk past him because we were distracted talking to each other.‚Äù

‚ÄúFine. Check-ins every five minutes, though. Text is fine, but I don‚Äôt want to have to sweep an entire quarter-mile looking for you, too,‚Äù said Amelia.

‚ÄúEvery five minutes, then. We‚Äôre probably going to find him before the first one, you know. He‚Äôs probably almost back by now.‚Äù

‚ÄúGreat, then let‚Äôs get going so he can laugh at us.‚Äù

We headed our separate ways. I looked back and caught Amelia looking back at me, too, so I gave her a thumbs up. It was bright and sunny in the forest, with dappled shadows and a pleasant breeze, and the path was clearly defined. There was no reason to be worried. Mateo had probably gone a little off trail chasing his chicken of the woods, dropped his phone somewhere, and gotten hung up looking for it. He was fine, wherever he was. We just had to find him everything would be okay.

I wandered along, scanning the surrounding forest and calling Mateo‚Äôs name every so often. After the first five minutes, I texted Amelia:

*Nothing yet. You?*

*Nothing*, she wrote back.

I called Mateo‚Äôs phone, just in case I could hear it ringing somewhere nearby, but it went to voicemail again. I tried to remember if he‚Äôd had it on vibrate. I wasn‚Äôt sure, so it was probably still worth an occasional call.

I quickly fell into a pattern. Walk, scan, yell name, repeat. Every five minutes, text Amelia, then call Mateo. The walk was nice, and aside from the increasing worry about Mateo, I was enjoying myself. We‚Äôd gone far enough that one of our two groups should have found him.

When I dialed Mateo after the fifth check-in, I‚Äôd gotten so used to the pattern that I almost didn‚Äôt notice the faint sounds of music from the forest. It wasn‚Äôt until the message cut into his voicemail and the song stopped that I realized what I‚Äôd been hearing. I hung up and called again. There was no question about it: I could hear his ringtone somewhere off to my right.

I took a few cautious steps into the woods. ‚ÄúMateo?‚Äù

There was no answer, but I was definitely moving toward the song. When it stopped, I hung up and called again. The ringtone played once more, a beacon bringing me in. ‚ÄúHey man, you okay? I can hear your phone.‚Äù

Up ahead was a small clearing in the trees, just a mossy patch of ground in the sun. The ringtone sounded like it was coming from there, but the space was totally empty. There was nothing but a large oblong rock at one edge of the clearing, a milky, mottled stone about the size of my torso.

I walked closer, confused. The phone cut off, and I redialed Mateo‚Äôs number once more. The song started again. It was definitely coming from the rock. Had he lost his phone under it?

I knelt down and put my hand on the rock to roll it over. It was damp, sticky and soft to the touch. I pulled my hand back in disgust, and part of what I had thought was a rock ripped away, stuck to my palm. It was a thick, leathery sack of some sort, and Mateo‚Äôs phone was inside.

That wasn‚Äôt all that was in there. There were bones, human bones. Fragments of his skull peered out at me, mixed in among femurs and knuckles and jumbled teeth. I saw pieces of his shoes, his Apple watch, and other remnants of Mateo. He had been stripped of everything digestible, and what was left had been crammed into this bag and dumped for me to find.

I stumbled backward, shaking my hand frantically to free it of the clinging material. I fled for the path, running frantically through vines and trees, ignoring the branches whipping at my face. I hit the trail and began sprinting for home.

An instant later, my phone buzzed in my pocket and I screeched to a halt. Amelia and Allie! They were probably halfway through the trail by now, and would be heading back this way. I‚Äôd love to say that I turned back to save them from whatever they might be walking into, but the honest truth is that I didn‚Äôt want to be alone. I was willing to run past whatever might have gotten Mateo if it meant having someone to watch my back twenty minutes sooner.

I must have looked insane when I came tearing down the trail towards them. My eyes were wide, my hair was tangled with twigs, and I was bleeding from a small cut on my cheek that I hadn‚Äôt yet noticed.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre okay! You‚Äôre okay!‚Äù I was shouting, which is admittedly not the least concerning intro. I slammed into Amelia and gave her a hug.

‚ÄúWhat is it? What happened? You didn‚Äôt answer the last check-in!‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Mateo! I found him. I found something. I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs he okay?‚Äù Allie asked. ‚ÄúWhere is he?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe woods. Something got him. Something‚ÄîI don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs bad.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh my God, Matty!‚Äù Allie started to cry. There were tears running down my cheeks, too, mixing with the blood. I wiped them away with the back of my hand, smearing dirt in their place.

‚ÄúIs he hurt? Is he dead? What happened?‚Äù Amelia demanded.

‚ÄúWe need to get out of here,‚Äù I insisted. ‚ÄúWe need to get back.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf he‚Äôs dead, we need to call the police!‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs‚Äîhe‚Äôs in a bag,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs all bones. He‚Äôs in a bag.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not making any sense.‚Äù

‚ÄúSomething got him! It left the bones, the pieces. He‚Äôs gone.‚Äù

Amelia grabbed me by the shoulders. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not making any sense.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm telling you what I saw.‚Äù

She looked at Allie, then back at me. ‚ÄúShow us.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. No way.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat you‚Äôre saying doesn‚Äôt make any sense.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know what I saw!‚Äù

‚ÄúBut we don‚Äôt. Show us. Is it far?‚Äù

I shook my head. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre almost there.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay. Take us. If you don‚Äôt, we‚Äôll just go without you. It‚Äôs not that we don‚Äôt believe you. We just don‚Äôt understand.‚Äù

We went back and forth for a while, but the more Amelia spoke in that calm voice, the more I wondered about what I‚Äôd actually seen. She was right, after all. It didn‚Äôt make any sense. What would strip him down to his bones, and then bag them up? Nothing worked that way. Even serial killers wouldn‚Äôt do that. They‚Äôd bury the evidence. Maybe I really had seen something else, misunderstood something. The only way to be sure was to go look.

All the time that she was convincing me, the forest was pleasant and calm and normal. It was hard to picture Mateo being dead at all when we were standing in such placid surroundings. I knew what I‚Äôd seen. I just wasn‚Äôt sure I was right anymore.

It took half an hour or more before she convinced me to go back. I led them back down the path cautiously, eyes scanning left and right in case anything was planning to jump out, but nothing did. It took much longer at my careful walk to get back to where I had been, but when I saw the marks in the dirt where I had burst onto the trail and then skidded to a halt, I knew I was in the right place.

‚ÄúThere. He‚Äôs over there in the woods,‚Äù I said. I took out my phone and dialed Mateo‚Äôs number again. We all listened as the song started.

‚ÄúMatty!‚Äù shouted Allie, immediately pushing her way through the undergrowth. ‚ÄúWhere are you?‚Äù

Amelia and I followed close behind.

‚ÄúLook!‚Äù said Amelia, pointing to a nearby tree branch. ‚ÄúIs that his watch?‚Äù

It was, although I couldn‚Äôt understand what it was doing on a branch. I‚Äôd seen it stuffed into that terrible bag in the clearing up ahead. I knew I had.

‚ÄúAnd his wallet!‚Äù said Allie, scooping something off of the ground. ‚ÄúHe must have been running from something.‚Äù

Up ahead, the cellphone‚Äôs song stopped. I redialed the number, and it began again, a cheery denial of the growing terror in my gut. Something was wrong. This wasn‚Äôt how things had been.

I could see the clearing now. The bag of bones was gone. Mateo‚Äôs cellphone glittered in the sunlight, metal and plastic clear against the moss.

Amelia started toward the phone. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all in a line. Maybe he tore his pocket open? If we follow‚Äî‚Äù

She was cut off by an ear-piercing screech from Allie. I could only stare in shock as something swarmed down from the trees, a cluster of things the color of bark that moved in a shifting mass made primarily of stabbing nails and teeth. They swept down from the branches and grabbed her by the hair and head, piercing through her cheeks and dragging her up into the canopy.

Amelia lunged to grab Allie‚Äôs feet, but as she turned her back on the clearing, the ground moved. A great slab of earth whipped open and closed in an instant, and a monstrosity I could barely glimpse seized Amelia in a welter of bristling appendages. I heard her back snap and her skull smash as she was whipped into that underground lair. I knew she was dead before the ground ever settled over her.

I stood and stared, my eyes flickering between the empty clearing and the peaceful canopy of leaves overhead. I could hear a muffled rustling from below the ground. There was a soft liquid patter among the trees. It wasn‚Äôt until a drop of blood landed on my cheek that I finally snapped out of my frozen moment and once again ran.

I locked myself in the house when I got back, and locked the bedroom door as well as a second barrier. I stayed there, huddled against the wall, until I fell asleep late that night. When I woke up the next day, still clothed, dirty, bloody, and alone, I tried to think of what to do, what the right thing would be.

I thought about going back. I thought about calling the police.

In the end, I showered, changed, and drove for home, eyes on the trees around me the whole time.

I‚Äôll report them as missing. I‚Äôll say where we were, and that I looked for them, and that I did not find them. That‚Äôs all true.

What good would it be to send more people out there? Even if I told them exactly what I had seen, of the thing underground and the swarm in the trees, and even if they believed me completely, it wouldn‚Äôt be enough. Whatever those monsters were, the huge lurker and the swarm of tiny things, they were not the same. They were working together, each using the other to draw and distract and devour prey. And if there are two of these horrific things‚Äîhow many more might there be?",2,1758282872.0,micahwrites,0,1.0,False

But that's not what bothers me. That's business. You're buying at a discount because of market factors. I would too. No, what bothers me is that you're buying my company with the sole intent of destroying it. You're *wielding* your money, Milt. That isn't business. It's not a sound *business* decision. My company was not competing with any of your companies, yet you're stomping it out because you can‚Äîbecause you‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause I don't like you,‚Äù said Milton.

Thistleburr squeezed the hat he was holding in his hands. ‚ÄúYou're irrational. My company could make you money if only you'd let it. Ten years and you'd make your money back and more.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you finished?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood, because once you leave my office I never want to see you again. I hope you disappear into the masses. As for *my* new company, I'll do with it as I please. And it will please me greatly to dissect it to dissolution. If you didn't want this to happen, you had the choice not to sell‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn't! You know I didn't.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd whose fault is that, Charles?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was an Act of God.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen tell that to your lawyers, and if you've sufficient proof, let them take it up with Him in court. I have no obligation to be rational. I may play with my toys any way I want.‚Äù

‚ÄúTwenty years I put into that company, Milt. Twenty years, and a lot of satisfied customers.‚Äù

Milton crossed the room to loom over the much smaller Charles Thistleburr. ‚ÄúAnd your last satisfied customer is standing right in front of you. Now, that's a poetic coda to your life as an entrepreneur.‚Äù

‚ÄúI hope you get what's coming to you,‚Äù barked Thistleburr, his face turning pink.

Laughing, Milton Barr went out for lunch.

- - -

At home, Milton was sitting in his leather armchair, sipping cognac, when his wife entered. Her name was Louisa, and she was much younger than Milton, twenty-three when he'd married her at fifty-one, and twenty-nine now. Past her prime. She still looked presentable, but not as alluring as she did when they'd met. The soft, domestic life, giving birth to their daughter and staying home to raise her, had fattened her, made her less glamorous. ‚ÄúAren't you going to ask me about my day?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúHow was your day?‚Äù

‚ÄúExcellent. How was yours, my love?‚Äù

She visibly recoiled at those last two words. ‚ÄúFine, too. I spent them at home.‚Äù

Milton smiled, deriving a kind of deep pleasure‚Äîa psychological one, beyond any physical pleasure in its cruel intensity‚Äîfrom having imprisoned her in his palatial house, caring for a daughter he hardly knew and cared about only with money, of which he had an endless supply, so therefore loved endlessly. They had everything they wanted, wife and daughter both. Love, love; money. But most of all, looking at his wife, who was playing the part of obedience, playing it poorly and for greed, he wanted to get up out of his chair and strike her in the face. What a genuine reaction that would be! ‚ÄúYou're a good mother,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHow is our little angel?‚Äù

‚ÄúFine,‚Äù said Louisa.

‚ÄúAren't you going to say she misses me?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe's missed you terribly since morning,‚Äù said Louisa, and both of them smiled, exposing sharp white teeth.

- - -

‚ÄúYou're sure?‚Äù asked Milton.

He was at lunch with an old friend named Wilbur. ‚ÄúI am absolutely positive,‚Äù said Wilbur. ‚ÄúI wouldn't tell you if I wasn't. I've met Louisa‚Äî*and this was her.*‚Äù

‚ÄúMidtown, at half-past noon, last Tuesday afternoon?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

The sly little thing is cheating on me, thought Milton. ‚ÄúWhat was she doing?‚Äù

‚ÄúWalking. Nothing more.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlone?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. I do not mean to suggest anything improper. I've no evidence to support it, but, as a friend and fellow husband, I believe you should know.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere *exactly* midtown was it?‚Äù asked Milton.

Wilbur gave an address, giddy with the potential for a scandal, which he kept decorously hidden.

- - -

‚ÄúMy love, were you out two weeks ago, on Tuesday?‚Äù Milton asked his wife.

She was putting together a puzzle with their daughter. ‚ÄúOut where?‚Äù she answered without looking up, but with a tension in her voice that did not pass unnoticed by Milton, who thought that if she wasn't out, she would have said so.

‚ÄúOut of the house.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you sure? Please try to remember. A lot may depend on it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI'm sure,‚Äù said Louisa.

‚ÄúOK,‚Äù said Milton.

He watched mother and daughter complete their puzzle, before leaving the room. After he left, Louisa crossed to the other side and made a telephone call.

- - -

Milton spent three straight afternoons in the vicinity of the address given to him by Wilbur, looking at passers-by, before spotting her. Once he did, he did not let up. He followed her through the streets all the way to a small apartment in a shabby part of the city that smelled to him of something worse than poverty: the middle class. He waited until she'd turned the key, unlocking the front door, before making his approach.

Seeing him startled her, but he tried his best to keep his natural menace in check. If there's a man in there, he thought, I'll have him killed. It can be arranged. His smile was glacial. ‚ÄúGood afternoon.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù she answered, backing instinctively away from him. Her question oozed falseness.

‚ÄúAh, the parameters of the game.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat game‚Äîwhat is this‚Äîand just who in the world are you?‚Äù Her gaze took in the emptiness of the surroundings. No one in the hall. Perhaps no one home at all. No one to hear her scream.

‚ÄúMy name is Figaro,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI didn't mean to startle you. May I use your telephone?‚Äù

She bit her lip.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she said finally.

He followed her inside. The apartment was disappointingly average. He would have been impressed with some sign of good taste, however cheaply rendered; or even squalor, a drug addiction, signs of nymphomania. But here there was nothing. She pointed him towards the telephone. He picked it up and dialed his own home number. Looking at her, he heard Louisa's voice on the other end. ‚ÄúYes?‚Äù Louisa said.

‚ÄúOh, nothing important. I wanted simply to hear your sweet voice,‚Äù he said into the receiver while keeping his eyes firmly on the woman before him: the woman who looked exactly like but was not his wife. There was a rigid thinness to her, he noticed; a thinness that Louisa once had but lost. ‚ÄúIt's lonely in the office. I miss your presence.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd I yours, of course,‚Äù Louisa replied.

*Of course.* Oh, how she mocked him. How deliciously she tested his boundaries. He respected that sharpness of hers, the daring. ‚ÄúGoodbye,‚Äù he said into the receiver and placed it back in its spot.

‚ÄúIs that all you wanted?‚Äù the woman who was not Louisa asked.

By now Milton was sure she had taken careful note of his bespoke clothes, his handmade leather shoes, his refined manner, and was aware that class had graced the interior of her little contemporary cave, maybe for the very first time. The middling caste always was. ‚ÄúYes‚Äîbut what if I should want something more?‚Äù

‚ÄúLike what?‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease, sit,‚Äù he said, testing her by commanding her in her own home.

She did as he had commanded.

He sat beside her, a mountain of a man compared to her slender frame. Then he took out his wallet, which nearly made her salivate, and asked her if she lived alone. ‚ÄúI have a boyfriend,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn't ask about your relationship status. I asked if you live alone. Let me rephrase: does your boyfriend live here with you?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúDoes he have a habit of showing up unannounced?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúCould he be convinced,‚Äù said Milton, stroking his wallet with his fingertips, ‚Äúnever to come around again?‚Äù

‚ÄúHow much?‚Äù she blurted out.

Milton grinned, knowing that if it was a matter of money, not principle, the question was already answered, and to his very great satisfaction.

He gently laid a thousand dollars on her lap.

She bit her lip, then took the money. ‚ÄúI suppose you must not love him very much,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúI suppose not. I suppose I don't really love anyone.‚Äù She made as if to start unbuttoning her polyester blouse, when Milton said: ‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù His voice had filled the room like a lethal amount of carbon monoxide.

‚ÄúI thought‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúYou mustn't. *I* think. And I don't want your sex. I want something altogether more meaningful, and intimate.‚Äù She stared at him, her hand frozen over her breast. ‚ÄúI want your violence.‚Äù

He gave her more money.

‚ÄúAre you going to ask me my name, Figaro?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúYour name is Louisa,‚Äù he said, handing her yet more money, this time directly into her palm. ‚ÄúLouisa, I want you to get up out of that chair and I want you to tell me you hate me. I want you to yell it at my face. Then I want you to slap my cheek as hard as you can. Understood?‚Äù

She answered by doing as told.

The slap echoed. Milton‚Äôs cheek turned red, burned. His head had ever-so-slightly turned from impact. ‚ÄúGood. Now do it again, Louisa. Hate me and hit me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI hate you!‚Äù she screamed‚Äîand the subsequent punch nearly knocked him off his chair. It had messed up his hair and there was a touch of blood in the corner of his mouth. He got up and beat her until she was cowering, helpless, on the floor. Then he threw another thousand dollars on her and left, rubbing his jaw and as delirious with excitement as he hadn't been in at least a quarter-century.

At home, he sat on the floor and coloured pictures of dogs with his daughter.

‚ÄúDid something happen to your face?‚Äù Louisa asked.

‚ÄúNothing for you to worry about‚Äîbut thank you very kindly for your concern. It is touching,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHow was your day, my love?‚Äù

‚ÄúGood.‚Äù

A week later he returned to the midtown apartment, knocked on the door and waited, unsure if she was home; or what to expect if she was. But after a minute the door opened and she stood in it. ‚ÄúFigaro.‚Äù

‚ÄúLouisa. May I come in?‚Äù

She nodded, and as soon as he'd followed her through the door, she hit him in the body with a baseball bat. ‚ÄúYou bitch,‚Äù he thought, and tried to say, but he couldn't because the blow had knocked the wind out of him. He fell to his knees, wheezing; as he was taking in vast amounts of air, fragrant with cheap department store perfume, she thudded him again with the bat, and again, this third blow laying him out on his back on the brown carpeted floor, from where he gazed painfully up at her. ‚ÄúI hate you,‚Äù she said and spat in his face.

Her thick saliva felt deliciously warm on his lips. ‚ÄúLouisa‚Äî‚Äù She kicked him in the stomach. ‚ÄúLouisa.‚Äù She knocked him cleanly out with the bat.

He regained consciousness in her bed.

He was there alone. The bat was propped up against the wall. About an hour had elapsed. He had a headache like a ringing phone being wheeled closer and closer to him on a hotel cart.

He slid off the bed, grunted. Kept his balance, hobbled to the bat, picked it up and, holding it in both hands, rubbing the shaft with his palms, went out into the living room. She was making coffee in the kitchen annex. He waited until she was done, had poured the coffee into a single cup, and swung. The impact landed with a clean, satisfying crack. ‚ÄúYou're dirt, garbage. You're filth. You're slime.‚Äù

She crawled away.

He leaned on the counter drinking the coffee she'd poured.

Then he walked over to her, picked her up by her clothes and threw her against the wall. Another drink of coffee. She unplugged and threw a lamp at him. It hit him in the side of the head. He beat her with a chair. She kicked out, knocking him off balance, and scrambled to her feet. Lumbering, he followed her back to the kitchen annex, from where she grabbed the steaming kettle and splashed him with what was left of the boiling water. It burned him. She pummeled him with the empty kettle. When he came to for the second time that day he was still on the living room floor. She put a half-smoked cigarette out on his chest, and he exhaled.

Twenty-four year old Louisa Barr exited the medical clinic where Milton was paying a fertility specialist to help her conceive. It was a ritual of theirs. The doctor would spend a session telling her what to do, in what way, for how long and in what position, usually while staring at her chest and squirming, and she would spend the next session lying about having done it. Then the doctor would console her, telling her to keep her spirits up, that she was young and that it was a process. The truth was she didn‚Äôt want a child for the simple reason that she didn‚Äôt want to be pregnant, but Milton insisted, so she went. The clinic was also one of the few places she was allowed to go during the day without arousing her husband's suspicions.

She arrived at an intersection and stopped, waiting for the light to change.

It was a nice day. Summer, but not too hot. She used to spend entire days like these outdoors, playing or reading or studying. Indeed, that was how she‚Äôd met Milton. She was sitting in the shade reading a college textbook when he walked over to her. She felt no immediate attraction to him physically, but his money turned her on immensely. Within six months they were married, she had dropped out of school and they were spending their afternoons having dry, emotionless sex. Milton very much wanted a child, or rather another child, because he already had two with his previous wife, but neither his ex-wife nor his children wanted anything to do with him anymore. Louisa had see them only once, when the mother had brought both children to Milton‚Äôs house to have them beg for money.

The light turned green and Louisa began crossing the street. As she did, a municipal bus pulled up at a stop on the other side of the intersection and several people got out. *One of them looked exactly like her.*  It was uncanny‚Äîand if not for the honking of car horns, Louisa would have stayed where she was, immobilized by the shocking resemblance.

She crossed the street quickly, and then again, all while keeping an eye on her doppelganger. When she was behind her, she sped up, yelling, ‚ÄúExcuse me,‚Äù until the doppelganger turned, realized the words were addressed to her, and the two of them, facing each other, opened their same mouths in the same moment like twin reflections disturbed into silence.

Louisa spoke first. ‚ÄúI‚Äîdo you‚Ä¶ we are‚Ä¶‚Äù

They ended up sharing a lunch together, both sure that everyone around them thought they were identical twin sisters. Louisa considered that a possibility too, but they weren‚Äôt. They‚Äôd been born to different sets of parents thousands of miles apart. They spoke about their lives, their hopes and disappointments. Louisa learned that her doppelganger, whose name was Janine, had grown up in a working class family and come to the city for work, which she found as a receptionist for a dog food company. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an OK job,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI bet any trained monkey could do it, but it pays the bills, so I‚Äôll keep the monkey out of a job awhile yet.‚Äù What Janine really wanted to do was act, and that wasn‚Äôt going so well. ‚ÄúEverybody and their sister wants to be in movies and television,‚Äù said Janine. ‚ÄúWhat I should do is give it up. My other dream, if you want to call it that, is to have a child, but I just haven‚Äôt met anyone yet. I don‚Äôt know if I want to, not really. It‚Äôs the child I want. The experience of being pregnant, of nurturing a life inside me. What about you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI live in a cage,‚Äù said Louisa. ‚ÄúThe cage is made of gold, and I can buy anything I want in it‚Äîexcept what I *really* want, which is my freedom. But that‚Äôs the deal I made.‚Äù For reasons she did not understand, it was easy to talk to Janine, to confide in her; it was almost like confiding in herself. She had never been this honest, not even with her own family. ‚ÄúMy husband is a cold, calculating man obsessed with work. He‚Äôs distant and the only love he knows how to give is the illusion of it. I don‚Äôt know if he even loves himself. Lately, I don‚Äôt think I do either. There‚Äôs a nothingness to us both.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs he abusive?‚Äù asked Janine.

‚ÄúNo, not physically,‚Äù said Louisa, adding in her mind: because that would require some form of passion, emotion, *feeling.* Milton was the opposite of that. Dull. Not mentally or intellectually, but sensually, like a human body that had had its nervous system ripped out.

‚ÄúWe look the same but lead such different lives. Unhappy, I guess, in our own ways; but maybe all lives are like that. Do you think your husband‚Äôs happy?‚Äù said Janine.

‚ÄúHe wants a child which I‚Äôm preventing him from having,‚Äù said Louisa, and mid-thought *is when the idea struck her*. She gasped and grabbed Janine‚Äôs hand on the table, which shook. A few people looked over, anticipating a sibling spat. ‚ÄúWhat if,‚Äù said Louisa experiencing a sensation of near-vertigo, of being in a tunnel, on the opposite end of which was Janine, meaning Louisa, meaning Janine, ‚ÄúI offered you a role to play‚Äîpaid you for it, and in exchange you freed me from my cage?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure I follow,‚Äù said Janine.

‚ÄúWhat if we switched lives?‚Äù

‚ÄúHow?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt would be easy. I don‚Äôt work, so you‚Äôd have nothing to do except keep house, which the servants do anyway, and conceive a child. You‚Äôd have all the money in the world. Your whole life would be one glorious act. You would raise your own son or daughter while devoting yourself to your artistic passion completely.‚Äù

Janine stared. ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that crazy‚Äîand wouldn‚Äôt your husband‚Ä¶ realize?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe wouldn‚Äôt. *No one would.* I would do your job at least as well as a trained monkey, and I would spend my time doing whatever I wanted.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou would give up everything for that?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut for how long?‚Äù

‚ÄúFor as long as we‚Äôre both happier living other lives.‚Äù

‚ÄúForever?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, if‚Äî**five years later:** Louisa holds an icepack to the swollen side of her face as ‚ÄúFigaro‚Äù bleeds into a crumpled up tablecloth. They‚Äôre both heavily out of breath. As she looks around, Louisa sees broken plates, splintered wood, blood splatter on the walls. She touches her cheek and pulls a sliver of porcelain out of it. The pain mixes with relief before returning magnificently in full. Blood trickles out. ‚ÄúI hate you,‚Äù she says to the space in front of her. The air feels of annihilation. ‚ÄúI hate you,‚Äù repeats ‚ÄúFigaro,‚Äù which prompts her to crawl towards and kiss him on the lips, blood to blood. ‚ÄúI hate you so fucking much, Louisa,‚Äù he says, and slugs her right in the stomach.

When Milton returns home, barely able to keep upright, the woman he believes to be the real Louisa asks him about his day, which is absurd, because it‚Äôs eleven at night and he looks like he just got out of a bar fight.

‚ÄúExcellent,‚Äù he says, and means it.

On Saturday morning he volunteers to take his daughter to the playground for the first time in years, and they have a genuinely good time together. Realizing she wants to ask him about the state he‚Äôs in but doesn‚Äôt know how, he tells her he started taking boxing lessons but isn‚Äôt very good. When people stare, he ignores them. They‚Äôre scum anyway, the consequences of a society that is constantly rounding down. At work he intimidates people into keeping their mouths shut. Black eyes, busted lips, cuts, wounds, fractured bones and the smell of blood and pus. Maybe they think he‚Äôs a drug addict. Maybe they think something else, or nothing at all.

One day he shows up unannounced at Thistleburr‚Äôs house.

When Thistleburr sees him, the damage done to his body, he draws back into his meagre house like a rodent into its hole. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt, I‚Ä¶ swear, Milt. If you think‚Ä¶ that I had anything‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you did.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo then why are you here?‚Äù asks Thistleburr, a little less afraid than he was a few moments ago.

‚ÄúI want to tell you you can have your company back,‚Äù says Milton, wincing. One of the wounds on his stomach has opened up. ‚ÄúDo you have a towel or something?‚Äù

Thistleburr brings him one.

Milton holds it to his wound, the blood from which is seeping through his shirt.

‚ÄúAre you OK?‚Äù asks a confused Thistleburr.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm grand. I thought you‚Äôd be happy, you know‚Äîto have it back.‚Äù

‚ÄúI would, but I know you already sold off all the assets.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight, and then I bought them all back. At a loss. So what else do you want: everything in a box with a bow on it? I‚Äôm offering you a gift. Take it.‚Äù He gives Thistleburr a binder full of documents, which the smaller man reluctantly receives. ‚ÄúThe lawyers say it‚Äôs all there, every last detail. I even bought the same ugly chairs you had.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to say.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen don‚Äôt say it.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a good man, Milt.‚Äù

‚ÄúBullshit. You only say that because you got what you wanted. To you, that‚Äôs the difference between good and bad. You‚Äôve got no spine. But that‚Äôs all right, because all that does is put you in the majority. Goodbye, Charles. I‚Äôm going to keep the towel.‚Äù

As Milton hobbles away from his house, Thistleburr calls after him: ‚ÄúAre you sure you‚Äôre OK, Milt? You look rough. I‚Äôm serious, If there‚Äôs anything I can do‚Ä¶‚Äù

Milton waves dismissively. ‚ÄúEnjoy your happy fucking ending.‚Äù",2,1758282639.0,normancrane,0,1.0,False

1nl1dkq,https://www.reddit.com/r/married/comments/1nl1dkq/am_i_being_ungrateful/,Am I being ungrateful?,"First time writing on reddit! Hi im 26 F) SAHM and been married to my husband (29M) for 6 years and we have 3 kids together aged 4,2 and 3months old. Our relationship was always good until we had our second kid and it turned into typical roommates situation. We‚Äôve been fighting way more now since we had our third and even tho he is a wonderful dad i think he isnt a husband.

My whole family lives overseas and my relationship with my in laws isnt great which means i get no help at all. I would consider myself very type A mum, organized, clean, not alot of screen time etc because raising kids is very important to me and i love it. I do all the chores mostly myself, take the kids to their practice, teach them stuff at home, and plan fun activies every day. 

We had a fight and he called me ungrateful which has been bothering me so much and i wanna know AITAH? Am i really ungrateful??  He works alot and provides for all of us and i get it its stressful and tiring and i always say i appreciate what he does to us. He called me ungrateful because i always tell him I need him to change and give him examples how. He has been ‚Äùtrying‚Äù for a few days apparently (which is legit the bare minimum like telling me a few times he appreciates me or that the food i cooked was nice or ‚Äùtried to talk to me more‚Äù) 

I feel like I live alone with a friend and not a husband. I never get complimented, only get flowers on anniversaries, never get taken on spontaneous trips or staycations. NEVER had a proper date night since having kids. Even when my two kids are in daycare 2x a week and it happens that one of those days he isnt working he NEVER plans to do something fun with me unless I planned it. He isnt affectionate, doesnt kiss me much, hug me or hold hands. Has the free time to go gym or see his friends for a coffee/watch a game whenever he wants to. Even on my birthdays its unless ive planned something we wont do anything. I have to beg him for months to clean my car or to fix something at the house. I cant even shower in peace without having to say what to do with the kids. Typical men thing where he doesnt know where things belong, or how to wash my daughters hair or even just rub my back when i was pregnant. He doesnt even defend me when my inlaws talk shit about me or are rude and mean to me. Thats a whole another story.

I feel like im always doing everything for him even work lunches and breakfast is always prepped for him but I cant even get him to cut me a plate of fruit while he sits on his phone when im putting all 3 kids to bed by myself. Most days he falls asleep early with the kids which means he doesnt even want to sit down with me at night and bond or have a talk.

Everytime i tell him IM DONE he tells me no he loves me and cant live without me and he just doesnt know how to do these things without me telling him. He gets offended when i say he isnt a good husband to me because he says its like I compare him to someone who is toxic and abusive (which he isnt)

I love him but honestly i just wanna know is this normal??? Am i just being dramatic? Ungrateful cos he provides for us? ",1,1758282536.0,married,0,0.67,False

Ive come across the concepts on conical and flat burrs grinders, and i saw the conical gives more of ""chocolaty complex taste"" and flatt burrs give ""clear flavour taste"" 


Now If i get conical burr grinder for coffe and it masks the real taste of specefic bean, unlike the flatt burr which is more clear, then what is the point in trying different coffee beans if all of them will likely taste more or less ""the same""?

I just want my espresso to be single short shot(7gram) ,  with heavy body, heavy crema. And i repeat heavy crema.

I know puck preparation and espresso machine pressure bar and other stuff play a crucial factor, but lets assume everything is set and prepared to give a heavy espresso.

Im leaning toward the conical burr concept due to more heavy espresso, but 1) is there anything i should know about before buying a one and not proceeding with a flat burr?

2)Is grinding directly into the portafilter considered a plus? Or is better considered to grind into an external cup then pouring the coffe geind into the portafilter?

3)is grinding by time / weight crucial thing or is it fancy stuff that may complicate stuff? 

I'd preffer also single dose over hopper because im gonna change between decaf and normal beans often.

Open for suggestions as the above preferces, thank you.

This is all incredibly new to me, and of course it hit me during my once in a lifetime honeymoon trip in Italy‚Ä¶ two weeks before I left for my trip, I tested positive for Covid (which upon research, seems like it can trigger HI for some folks?).

I spent a week in Paris mostly unproblematically, though of course was imbibing in a lot of wine, cheeses and cured meats. One morning after a day of lots of red wine, I had what felt like a panic attack with rolling waves of nausea. It lasted a few hours and tapered off‚ÄîI thought it was just a delayed hangover. Felt fine for several days (even had wine and cheese with no issues) and then we transferred to Italy.

The morning after a night of pasta and a split liter of house red wine in Rome (again, my understanding is house wine is a prime culprit), I woke up with one eye swollen and slightly itchy. An hour later the same panicked, rolling waves of nausea hit. It stayed for several hours and I again attributed it to a hangover (though my husband and I were confused, as we have had this much to drink before with no issues). I didn‚Äôt drink again that day, and the next morning I had a breakfast of orange juice. eggs, kiwi, spinach, and mushrooms‚Äîa meal which I now understand is fully of ‚Äúhistamine releasing foods‚Äù (citrus, kiwi, spinach, mushrooms). Imagine my surprise when forty minutes later, the rolling nausea was back and no alcohol to blame‚Ä¶. And the final red flag? That evening, one sip of red wine at dinner was an immediate wave of nausea. Like within minutes. 

I‚Äôve since fallen down the HI rabbit hole ever since and have spent the last couple days trying to have a low HI diet IN ITALY, which is terribly challenging and depressing. Of course most things here are on the ‚Äúno no‚Äù list for HI diets. It seems Prosecco at least gives me no problems, and I was able to get my hands on Pepcid which I *think* has helped, as I have gone two days now with no nausea. 

That said, I‚Äôm wondering if others have experienced any of this? I‚Äôm walking a line of wanting to dabble a little to enjoy a piece of pizza or some pasta while I still have a week left of my trip, but I‚Äôm terrified of the reactions. I plan on getting an allergy panel done when I‚Äôm back home in USA, but would be helpful to hear about others‚Äô experiences and what has helped / not helped. As a big chocolate / coffee/ cheese / red wine lover, this is quite the devastating development‚Ä¶ not to mention, I‚Äôm a big meal prepper and the thought of not being able to have leftovers is throwing me for a loop.",0,1758282235.0,HistamineIntolerance,1,0.5,False

After about 10 email messages back-and-forth with an AI support agent suggesting all kinds of fixes, I got an email message requesting going into the watch and manipulating settings, then sharing data with Coros. It‚Äôs not that I mind doing that, it‚Äôs just that it seems like a lot of work for an issue that seems prevalent with other users. 

I‚Äôm attaching a pic of the latest email response. 

After doing these steps, then I have to create a new ticket in the Coros app with the submitted logs. 

Maybe I‚Äôm just complaining and it‚Äôs early and I haven‚Äôt had enough coffee, but it seems like if a lot of people are having a similar issue, wouldn‚Äôt an update be a better fix than having everyone go through multiple steps and create multiple support tickets? Also the agent said something along the lines of data not being aligned. Here‚Äôs my response:

‚ÄúThank you. I will adjust the settings for the next few runs and sync as directed.

One question: When you wrote, ‚Äúthe pace, cadence, and stride length don‚Äôt align as expected,‚Äù does that mean that the data indicates a problem or that the data shows that there is no problem?

Like I‚Äôd stated, when I noticed the issue on my runs, I would stop running and pause the watch, then restart in order to get a correct pace.

I‚Äôd just like some clarification before doing all the steps.

Thank you.‚Äù

This all-in-one wireless color inkjet printer promises a lot, from quality photo printing to handling regular office tasks. Being someone who prints everything from family photos to important documents, I dove headfirst into testing this device. While I‚Äôve been generally satisfied, a few quirks stood out that you might want to know about.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The design is sleek yet functional. Sporting a compact footprint for an all-in-one device, it manages to fit neatly in my workspace without looking out of place. The off-white finish gives it a modern touch, but watch out if you‚Äôre prone to coffee spills‚Äîthe light color can be tricky to maintain. The touchscreen interface is responsive and simple to navigate, though it occasionally felt too small when dealing with detailed settings. But I appreciated the dedicated photo tray‚Äîit saved me from juggling different paper types during usage.

**Ease of Setup and Connectivity**  
Setting up the printer was surprisingly easy. From unboxing to connecting it to my home Wi-Fi, everything went smoothly. The HP Smart app guided me step-by-step. What won me over most is the self-healing Wi-Fi feature that ensures a steady connection, preventing those annoying moments of ""Printer not found."" Both iOS and Android devices connected seamlessly, and I could even print directly from cloud services. One minor hiccup: the setup required an HP account, which might feel like an unnecessary extra step for some.

**Performance and Print Quality**  
Print speed and quality were what I focused on most. For black-and-white documents, the speed of 15 ppm felt efficient, especially when multitasking. However, the real selling point is the photo printing. The 4800 x 1200 dpi resolution offered vibrant, true-to-screen image replication. Printing 5x5 square photos was a delight, and the HP 4x12 panoramic photo paper sheets gave my vacation pictures a gallery-like finish. There‚Äôs a slight wait for initial page prints‚Äîaround 16 seconds for me‚Äîbut I‚Äôd trade a little speed for quality any day.

Check [HP ENVY Inspire 7955e‚Äôs pricing on Amazon](https://headphonegeek.com/p/b09bbln72f/).  

**Additional Features of Note**  
What made daily use more convenient were the smart features integrated into this device. Duplex printing‚Äîyes, it‚Äôs automatic‚Äîis a blessing for eco-conscious users like me. The custom shortcuts on the app genuinely saved me time when scanning multipage documents with the 50-sheet automatic document feeder. Another highlight? The eco-friendly touch. HP claims the printer is made using over 45% recycled plastic, which resonates with anyone looking to reduce their environmental footprint.

**Benefits**  
- High-resolution color printing for stunning photos  
- Easy-to-use HP Smart app for remote management  
- Automatic two-sided printing to save paper  
- Reliable self-healing Wi-Fi for uninterrupted printing  

**Shortcomings**  
- App account creation required for setup  
- Slightly slow initial page print time  
- Ink compatibility limited to HP-branded cartridges  

**Product Contenders**  
Compared to the Canon PIXMA TS6420, the HP ENVY Inspire 7955e offers faster document printing speeds but falls slightly short in saturation for dark-toned photos. Meanwhile, Epson's EcoTank ET-2760 can be a budget-friendly choice for ink refills but doesn‚Äôt match the HP‚Äôs photo paper versatility or smart app features. The HP ENVY Inspire edges out these competitors with a more sustainable design and dedicated photo functionality, but its ink subscription push may feel limiting to users wanting more cartridge flexibility.

**Affordable Quality**  
The price-to-feature ratio seems reasonable for an all-rounder targeting both photo lovers and home office workers. Though you won‚Äôt find this product in the bargain bin, the feature set‚Äîincluding duplex scanning, a photo-dedicated tray, and seamless app integration‚Äîjustifies spending a bit more. The three-month Instant Ink trial sweetens the deal for anyone worried about ink costs, but be mindful of ongoing fees after that. It achieved a sweet spot for me between affordability and quality.

 I've been enjoying Scottt Rao's blooming espresso procedure, but with an e61 style machine and flow control paddle.

1nl0ogk,https://www.reddit.com/r/JamesHoffmann/comments/1nl0ogk/storing_and_freezing_beans/,Storing and freezing beans,"A question regarding storing coffee and whether to freeze it or not.

So I order by the kilo, two different coffees, and I get two 1 kilo bags of the other, and four 1/4 kilo bags of the other.

Maybe a weeks worth goes into a small airtight ‚Äùfor use‚Äù container, and the rest goes into a larger ‚Äùfor storage‚Äù container that is air-displacement and airtight. Point being that if I am opening the container three times a day, vacuum or air displacement doesn‚Äôt do much as it gets aired several times a day. Hence a separate container for storage.

I know Hoffman is an advocate of freezing coffee for storage and I believe grinding frozen beams assuming your grinder manual says otherwise. But you should grind portions and not open a frozen bag, grab some beans, and return the bag to the freezer as that could nullify some of the benefits of freezing it in the first place (air gets in, frozen beans could collect moisture from it, etc).

But whatabout thawing in the storage container? Let‚Äôs say I freeze a kilo of the other and a few bags of 250g of the other.

I could then, as I consume what I have not-frozen, take the frozen beans from the freezer to the storage container that is air-displaced and -sealed, to thaw and then to the daily use air-sealed container for use once I run low.

So basically is there a benefit to freezing the beans if I will thaw then later, even if that is done in a container with very little air in.

I know storing them in portions would solve it, but running an Aeropress and using 1-5 cup sizes per day (15g in the morning, 12g later, 6-9g in the evening or for a small cup, 18g for a faux espresso to do a kind of a latte sometimes..) so I really don‚Äôt have the option of having literally dozens (1 kilo bags from the roaster) bags of varying sizes in the freezer. Too much work and probably would anyway have too many bags of one size while running out another, so just no.",1,1758280342.0,JamesHoffmann,1,1.0,False

We were all passing around one of those giant iced coffees, and someone casually joked, ‚Äúhope nobody has herpes.‚Äù That comment made me wonder ‚Äî is it really possible to catch herpes just from sharing a cup, straw, or drink?

I know cold sores (oral herpes) are pretty common, and I‚Äôve read they‚Äôre usually spread through direct skin contact like kissing. But does saliva on a drink actually carry enough risk? Some people say yes, others say it‚Äôs extremely unlikely unless there‚Äôs an active sore. I‚Äôve been looking at different sources online, and I even stumbled across **HerpesCureForever. Org**, which goes into a lot of detail about outbreaks and prevention. Still, I‚Äôd like to hear real opinions from people here.

Have any of you ever worried about this or even had an experience where you think you caught something that way? Is it more myth than fact? Reddit usually has the most honest answers compared to the generic stuff you see on Google.

# Part 6

¬†

(Optional SFX of a horse and carriage stopping.)

¬†

(Sparrow speaks with a formal air of aristocracy until advised otherwise.)

¬†

Sparrow:¬† (Laughing jovially.)¬† Oh, Seymour, you devious cad, how could you possibly suggest participating in such an obscene display just as we are arriving to the party?¬† You‚Äôre going to get us thrown out before we‚Äôve even set foot on the ballroom floor.¬† You are positively scandalous.¬† Is the only reason why you finally accepted Dranthal‚Äôs invitation to visit him at his palace because you wanted to find a way to publicly defile it?¬†

¬†

No.¬† Don‚Äôt answer that.¬† I don‚Äôt want you to confirm my worst suspicions.¬†

¬†

(Brief pause.)¬† Scratch that.¬† Now you‚Äôve got me curious.¬† I do want to know.¬† How on earth were you proposing to get away with such a lewd act without being seen?

¬†

(Pause.)

¬†

(Playful groan/chuckle.)¬† Ugh, you‚Äôre a child.¬† You know that?¬† ¬†¬†

¬†

Now, straighten up, they‚Äôre about to announce us.¬† Act civilized for once in your life and hand the good man there your card, would you.¬†

¬†

(Pause.)

¬†

(Giggling.)¬† No, I don‚Äôt suppose that your civility was the reason why I married you.¬† It was most definitely your vast wealth and the luxurious amenities at your disposal.¬†

¬†

(To the greeter.)¬† Well, sir, you‚Äôve read my husband‚Äôs card.¬† Are you going to announce us or aren‚Äôt you?

¬†

(Pause.)

¬†

Yes, that‚Äôs what the card says.¬† Lord Edgington, Duke of the court of Dumana.¬† If you need some further assistance with the pronunciation I could repeat it for you.

¬†

(Pause.)

¬†

Excellent.¬† Then, if you have no trouble sounding out the words properly, would you be so kind as to perform the duty with which you have been assigned and announce us.¬† I should very much like to enjoy a waltz this evening with something other than one of the many swans that adorn the King‚Äôs pond, elegant as they may be.¬†

¬†

(Pause.)

¬†

My good man, why do you delay?¬† You appear as if you‚Äôve seen a ghost.¬† Is it common for specters to amble through the grounds?¬† Kindly pick your lower jaw up from off the floor.¬† You‚Äôre going to need it in order to announce us promptly so that we may enter.¬† The journey has been long and arduous and I so long to experience for myself King Dranthal‚Äôs fabled hospitality.¬†

¬†

(Pause.)

¬†

(Optional SFX.¬† Large, palace door opening and light piano music is heard as they enter.)

¬†

Finally.¬† I was beginning to wonder if we were destined to remain in the courtyard.¬† Now remember, my dear husband, play nice.¬† I don‚Äôt want to experience a similar incident as the one last fall.¬†

¬†

(Pause.)

¬†

(Giggles.)¬† No, I would not have joined you in the pond for a midnight dip.¬† You lost the bet as I recall.¬† You only got my bloomers to half-mast before the guards halted you.¬† I knew you‚Äôd never get them all the way to the top.¬† Now, hush.¬† A bit of decorum, my good husband.¬† We are no longer outdoors.¬†

¬†

(Pause.)

¬†

(If you are using piano music, it stops suddenly.)

¬†

Why, Lord Edgington, I do believe that our presence has created a bit of a stir.¬† Every eye seems to be upon us.¬† ¬†¬†

¬†

(Pause.)

¬†

(Soft laugh.)¬† Of course you would approve.¬† Is there anything you like more than being the focus of attention of every young lady present?¬†

¬†

Well, this IS what we came for.¬† Shall we mingle?¬† These lovely couples right over here look positively enchanting.¬† I would very much like to meet them.¬†

¬†

(Pause.¬† The light piano music restarts if you‚Äôre using it.)¬†

¬†

Ladies, gentlemen, good evening to you all.¬† It is a genuine thrill to make your acquaintance.¬† I am Lady Arwena, and this dashing gentleman on my arm is my husband, Lord Seymour Edgington.¬† What a privilege it is to finally accept King Dranthal‚Äôs long-standing offer to visit your lovely country.¬†

¬†

(Pause.)

¬†

My, my, Lord Edgington.¬† It seems that your reputation precedes you.¬† I had no idea you had achieved such a celebrity status without ever having set foot in the country before.¬†

¬†

(Pause.)

¬†

Is that so?¬† Ladies and gentleman, does my husband speak true.¬† Has our quiet nation of Dumana achieved such a legendary status among your people?¬†

¬†

(Pause.)

¬†

(Pleasant chuckle.)¬† A land of fairies and angels?¬† Now I see why our arrival has caused such a stir.¬† I had no idea we‚Äôd acquired that level of mystic notoriety in your country.¬†

¬†

I can assure you all that I am not hiding a pair of wings under my gown.¬† We‚Äôre a very simple people who very simply wish to live a very simple, life‚Ä¶¬† To put it very simply.¬† (Polite laugh.)¬†

¬†

(Pause.)

¬†

Why, yes, I do believe you are correct, madame.¬† Our entrance seems to have attracted the attention of the King himself.¬† He and his entourage are quite fixated on us.¬† Wouldn‚Äôt you agree?¬†

¬†

In that case, I will bid you a temporary farewell.¬† I leave you to enjoy the marvelous company of my charismatic husband, the Duke, while I satisfy the King‚Äôs curiosity.¬† I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll be delighted by my husband‚Äôs numerous anecdotes.¬† You‚Äôve all been so kind in welcoming us.¬† Ta ta for now.¬†

¬†

(Pause.)

¬†

Of course, my dear husband.¬† Once you‚Äôve introduced yourself to everyone here, you can join me with the King.¬† See you shortly, dear.¬† I do so look forward to introducing you once I introduce myself.¬† (Quick peck of a kiss in parting.)

¬†

(Pause as she approaches the king.)

¬†

King Dranthal, it is truly a pleasure to make your acquaintance.¬† Lady Arwena of Dumana, at your service.¬† My husband, the Duke, will join us shortly.¬† He‚Äôs currently making his way through the vast crowd of merrymakers assembled.¬† They seem to be quite enamored by his presence.¬†

¬†

(Pause.)

¬†

Yes, quite.¬† They can‚Äôt keep their hands off him, the young ladies especially.

¬†

I see that you are aware of my husband‚Äôs predilection for the ladies.¬† In fact, if memory serves, that is the real reason why you two have not yet met, is it not?¬† I believe you visited Dumana 2 summers ago for the wedding of my husband‚Äôs cousin, Princess Lenore.¬† You were able to meet her mother, Queen Minaltina Liandria, as well as most others in her court, however, you had no access to my husband as he was taking advantage of the fact that the wine was free flowing that day which caused many more young ladies to become even more compliant to his charms than usual.¬†

¬†

(Pause.)

¬†

Not at all.¬† I understood when I married him that I would never tame him, and, truth be told, I have no desire to do so.¬† He is quite the charmer and is very pleasant to be around, when he is around.¬† We have an understanding.¬† He has never neglected my needs in any way, and as long as that continues to be the case, he may have his fun.¬†

¬†

So, tell me, your majesty, aren‚Äôt you known for your dalliances as well?¬† Rumor is you‚Äôve lured quite a number of young maidens into your bed.

¬†

(Pause.)

¬†

Ah, I see.¬† That was your predecessor.¬† Forgive me, your highness.¬† I am not intimately familiar with the comings and goings of your court.¬†

¬†

But what better opportunity could I possibly have to learn more about the King and his country than from the King himself?¬† What can you tell me about yourself and your country that I might take back to my people?¬†

¬†

(Pause.)

¬†

Oh, come now, your highness, surely you can do better than that.¬† Crop rotations and the quality of your stables are of little interest to me.¬† I seek juicier, more scandalous fare.¬† Tell me, where might I find the intrigues, the drama, the fun?¬† Who‚Äôs plotting to stab whom in the back?¬† Who‚Äôs obsessing over another man‚Äôs wife?¬† Tell me.¬† I must know.

¬†

(Pause.)

¬†

(Playfully acting defeated.)¬† Oh, well.¬† If that‚Äôs the way it is to be, I suppose I shall have to be at peace with it.¬† At least now I may return to tell my people I tried my best to get state secrets from the king himself.¬† But, alas, he cleverly saw through my innocent face and devious tactics and withheld the most important details from me.¬† (Soft chuckle.)

¬†

(Pause.)

¬†

Do I, now?¬† Well, perhaps I seem familiar to you because we‚Äôve crossed paths before, possibly while you were in Dumana.¬†

¬†

(Pause.)

¬†

Why would we have crossed paths in the cathedral?¬† The wedding was held in the garden near a fountain Lenore‚Äôs father built for her when she was a child.¬† Were you possibly doing a little sight-seeing afterwards?¬† I am known to frequent the site a time or two, especially on rainier days.¬† I find the architecture to be genuinely inspiring as well as a bit soothing, especially when the low rumbling of storm clouds are signaling the release of their drenching payloads overhead.¬†

¬†

(Pause.)

¬†

Of course.¬† No apology is necessary.¬† It‚Äôs been a couple of years and I‚Äôm sure you have many, many duties you must constantly attend to as well as many faces that pass by your royal visage.¬† After a time, the memories must blend together.

¬†

(Pause.)

¬†

Yes, we are aware that our arrival was unforeseen and unexpected.¬† My husband is to blame for that.¬† He has always been prone to spontaneous decisions and flights of whimsical fantasy.¬† Besides, if word got out that he was on his way, certain fathers would make sure to keep their daughters at a safe distance from him, and that would disappoint him greatly.¬†

¬†

But you did leave an open invitation, did you not.¬† You expressed a desire for Queen Minaltina or any member of her court to visit at any time.¬† If I was informed correctly by her royal highness herself, you hinted that your kingdom contained a special, one-of-a-kind delight not to be found in any other kingdom.¬† I have to admit that my curiosity has been piqued.¬† Where is this mysterious delight of yours?¬† I wish to partake of such a marvelous wonder.

¬†

(Pause.)

¬†

(Acting distressed.)¬† Aw, that‚Äôs too bad.¬† I was looking forward to a personal tour of the dungeon.

¬†

(Pause.)

¬†

Yes, the dungeon.¬† That is where you were keeping it, or rather ‚Äúhim.‚Äù¬† Was it not?¬† You were holding this unique delight in your dungeon.¬† That‚Äôs where you would bring unsuspecting victims to meet the frail, young boy with the magic touch.¬†

¬†

Oh, my.¬† King Dranthal, you‚Äôve grown silent, as well as quite pale.¬† Are you coming down with something?¬† Or is it possible that you have become frightened that word of your secret weapon has somehow reached the technologically advanced kingdom of Dumana before you could entice a high ranking member of the court to come into contact with the lad and willingly reveal all of his or her secrets to you?¬†

¬†

Orrrrr, maybe, just maybe, you‚Äôre beginning to understand exactly how it is that you know me?¬† Is that it?¬† Are you figuring out that I just might be one of the rebels that broke into your dungeon and freed the emaciated and enslaved secret weapon you had hidden in there?¬† Are your eyes being opened to the fact that I was able to impersonate Dumana royalty because you yourself shared so much of the information with your advisors while in the same room as the boy you were using to twist minds and hearts to your will?¬† And that, after acquiring his freedom, he gladly shared all of that information with me so that I might choose a guise with enough mystery behind it to fool you long enough to allow my companion to speak with all assembled?¬†

¬†

(To Goldcrest who has arrived.)¬† Why, hello, dear.¬† What wonderful timing.¬† I would like you to meet King Dranthal, our host.¬† King Dranthal, allow me to introduce you to Goldcrest, the man pretending to be a Duke of Dumana and my husband.¬†

¬†

(Pause.)

¬†

(Casually, as if they‚Äôre pondering what to do today over coffee.)¬† The dungeon?¬† What do you think, dear?¬† Should we go become prisoners in his dungeon?¬† You never know.¬† It might be kind of fun.

¬†

(Pause.)

¬†

No, you make a very good point.¬† It‚Äôs kind of dreary down there as well as rather uncomfortable.¬†

¬†

I‚Äôm sorry, your majesty, but we‚Äôre going to have to decline your offer.¬† I think we‚Äôll stay here for now.¬†

¬†

(Pause.)

¬†

(Genially, having a pleasant conversation while standing next to the enraged King.)¬† I agree, dear.¬† It was a good call.¬† I would have had us thrown into the dungeon too if I were in his shoes.¬† That was a perfectly reasonable thing to say in his situation.¬†

¬†

(Pause.)

¬†

(Continuing to mock the king.)¬† Oh, my.¬† Dear, I do believe his blood pressure is rising significantly.¬† Did you know that his shade of red could intensify so quickly?¬† Is he about to burst?¬†

¬†

(Pause.)

¬†

I DO see it.¬† That vein right there.¬† It rose right to the surface and now it dominates the picture, doesn‚Äôt it.¬†

¬†

(Pause.)

¬†

(Calmly, but with some menace beginning to creep in.)¬† All right, your majesty, I think we‚Äôve had enough of your frantic blustering.¬† Your guards are not coming to do your bidding.¬† They have another master now, someone else they love and adore much more than you.¬†

¬†

Have you still not recognized the man at my side?¬† I do realize it must be strange seeing him healthy and strong as well as fully clothed, not to mention he no longer reeks of lying in his own filth, but he still should be somewhat recognizable to you.¬† After all, you did have plenty of time to examine him in your dungeon... nearly a decade.¬†

¬†

But no, you never took a good look at the man I claimed was my husband, Lord Edgington of Dumana because you were all too familiar with the rumors of his philandering which you found distasteful and not worthy of your attention.¬† And because of that, you paid no attention whatsoever to the fact that he was introducing himself to every‚Ä¶ single‚Ä¶ person‚Ä¶ present, including all of your soldiers.

¬†

Letting them know who he really was.

¬†

TOUCHING them, skin‚Ä¶ to skin.

¬†

(Pause.¬† If you were using piano music before, it stops now.)

¬†

That‚Äôs right.¬† Now you‚Äôre understanding the situation you‚Äôre in.¬†

¬†

(Pause.)

¬†

Did you hear that, everybody?¬† The king‚Ä¶ YOUR king, commands you to obey his commands by killing me and taking my husband into custody.

¬†

My dearest, Goldcrest.¬† What would you say in response?

¬†

(Pause.)

¬†

There you have it, ladies and gentlemen.¬† My husband, Goldcrest, requests instead that you take Dranthal immediately to the dungeon and leave him locked in there.¬† Which request will you follow?

¬†

(Pause.)

¬†

Goodbye for now, Dranthal.¬† I will enjoy attending your execution.¬† If it weren‚Äôt for one other acquaintance of yours with more of a right to it than me, I would also request being the one to slice off your head.¬†

¬†

You there, guard.¬† My husband has another request for you.¬† Do you remember your former commander, Captain Paydon?

¬†

(Pause.)

¬†

Very good.¬† You are to take a small group of soldiers and head to the Black Cat Tavern.¬† You will inquire to the tavern keeper about Captain Paydon‚Äôs current whereabouts.¬† When she informs you that she hasn‚Äôt seen him for quite some time, inform her that Goldcrest requests his presence immediately and she will take you to where he is currently awaiting your arrival.¬† You will then escort him and a small group of people with him here to this room.¬†

¬†

(Pause.)

¬†

Why, he is to be crowned your new king.¬† Now, make haste.¬† We will all be waiting here for your return.¬†

¬†

(Pause as Sparrow breathes a sigh of relief.)

¬†

Goldcrest, it worked.¬† Your plan worked.¬† And with no war.¬† No more bloodshed.¬†

¬†

(Pause.)

¬†

(Breathing a bit heavily as if in shock and awe.)¬† Very true.¬† There will be some more blood that is spilled before this is all completely behind us.¬† Some very well-deserved bloodshed.¬†

¬†

(Pause.)

¬†

Am I shaking?¬† I couldn‚Äôt tell.¬† I guess I am.¬† I am shaking quite heavily.¬† Would you look at that.¬† Amazing, isn‚Äôt it.¬† I‚Äôve been a rock for over 10 years, and now‚Ä¶

¬†

Look.¬† (Nervous laughter.)¬† Look at my hand.¬† I can‚Äôt keep it steady.¬† I can‚Äôt.¬† No matter how hard I concentrate, it continues to vibrate.

¬†

(Breaking down in tears.)¬†

¬†

Yes, that‚Äôs a good idea.¬† Hold me, Goldcrest.¬†

¬†

It‚Äôs over.¬† It‚Äôs all finally over.

¬†

All of those years, all of those lives lost, all of those families destroyed. ¬†And now it‚Äôs over.¬† Just like that.

¬†

(Pause.)

¬†

Goldcrest, why aren‚Äôt you shaking?¬† You were his prisoner for so long.¬† You have more right to fall apart than I.

¬†

(Pause.)

¬†

(Shaky laughter in the crying.)¬† Oh, Goldcrest.¬† I love you.¬†

¬†

(Happily agreeing.)¬† Ok.¬† Ok.¬† I do still need you to be strong for me.¬† You support me now.¬† I‚Äôll support you later when it‚Äôs your turn to break down.

¬†

You know, Goldcrest, I did enjoy being called your wife even if it was merely a ruse.¬† It felt‚Ä¶ right, like it was meant to be.¬†

¬†

What do you think?¬† Once Paydon is crowned King and his coronation has concluded, how would you react if he were to inform you that I had enquired as to the possibility of beginning his reign with a marriage?¬†

¬†

(Pause.)

¬†

(Joyously stunned.)¬† You‚Ä¶ you what?¬† You‚Äôre pulling my leg.¬† You did not ask him the same thing.¬†

¬†

You mean to say‚Ä¶¬†

¬†

Did you and I just‚Ä¶

¬†

(Laughter.)

¬†

Goldcrest, we truly were meant to be.¬† I love you so much.

¬†

(Kiss.)

¬†

(Pause.)

¬†

No, I haven‚Äôt thought that far ahead.¬† I don‚Äôt know what we‚Äôll do now that we no longer have to fight.¬† I don‚Äôt even know where we‚Äôll live.¬† I only know that I want you with me wherever the path may take me.¬†

¬†

Goldcrest, can you do me one favor?¬† Call it a wedding gift.

¬†

Can you‚Ä¶ can you command me to always stay with you?¬† To never leave you and to love you and only you for the rest of my life.¬†

¬†

(Pause.)

¬†

I know I don‚Äôt have to obey, but‚Ä¶ I want to hear you say it.¬† I want to know that it‚Äôs exactly what you desire most.¬†

¬†

(Pause.)

For example, i use and like [Tappsk](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tappsk-todo-habit-tracker/id1385049326?platform=iphone) (not mine) for scheduling, task reminders, it's nice and minimalistic design that works for me. I can't stand the cluttered, messy calendars. I just want title, date, category, done. Lol

Do you force yourself to leave the house like a cafe or library? I'm curious what other nice spots there are to work/study from.

Does anyone do accountability with friends? Like simple check-in's. I've been wanting to try this, but all my friends usually can't stick to a time once a week to check in, I need new friends. haha jk. I use this app [called ROOT](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/goal-tracker-for-friends-root/id6751100218) that is fun. You can team up with people all over the world who can check-in on your goals / milestone progress, it has ai milestone planning, etc. It's also a free app, I built it :P Mainly cause I needed help from others to keep me motivated and focused more, my goal success rate sucked. No obligation to use it, if you do, thank you.

What about biannual beats or ambient music? I use this [Moongate](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/moongate-binaural-beats/id6471041035) (not mine), it's so pretty w/ their pulsating effects, and i dig a lot of their sounds. Been using it a few months now.

I'd like to know what others use that are simple, maybe study groups, timers, apps, or cafe meetups, etc.",1,1758279680.0,studytips,0,1.0,False

Here's my situation, I am thinking of investing a set amount of money to get partial ownership in a business (coffee shop). It would be a 3% stake in the business. I am considering the tax implications if the business has a profit and I receive income from it. My AGI is expected to be around 180-220k going forward. I do have a child dependent, age 1. If I set up a bank account for them, and made the investment in this child dependents name, and had all the income go to their bank account, would it save on taxes? Basically, would this child dependent have a lower tax bracket than myself, or would it be the same tax bracket? If it helps, the business income would probably be around 2-8k a year (if it turns a profit). thank you so much for any insight and help

Recently, I worked for two popular local fast-food brands as their graphic and motion designer for about 6 months. I left because I was being underpaid (about $60/month), but I got that job without even having a CV (only showed them my designs).

My main tools are Adobe Photoshop and After Effects, and I‚Äôd say my skill level is within the top 20%. I can also handle animations and motion design.

Despite all this, I haven‚Äôt managed to make a solid living from design yet. Now, I‚Äôve dedicated a year to focus on freelancing to help finance my university and support my family a bit. I‚Äôm currently building my portfolio, which will include:

* A branding project
* Advertising posters I designed
* A SaaS animation

I also plan to get active on LinkedIn and freelancing platforms.

**My question:**¬†Is it realistic to aim for at least $200‚Äì300 per month as a beginner freelancer? And I‚Äôd really appreciate guidance from people already freelancing.

Here‚Äôs a design I made just now in about 40 minutes:

Everytime I made a new friend I introduced her too to that person. Even if i went on a date, I took her along at times.
This guy was very smart,flirty and cool. A good guy but a bit of a fuckboi. We three hung out a couple of times but he told me he would rather hang out with me alone than three of us together. This guy is all about geo politicls and likes to have a conversation around these topics and he wasn't enjoying the conversation he was having with my friend. So he wasn't keen to hangout with her, I said give her a chance, she is really nice and you will enjoy her company. Even pushed both of them to go out for a coffee and they did. I also told the guy, she has a health issue so don't ask her why she limps and be super nice to her, which he was cool. He gave her a total princess treatment to make her feel comfortable .
Also I thought my friend would like her too, she has a few health issues, so she would enjoy hanging out with someone who is so much fun. As she keeps saying she needs people to hangout with on the weekends.

But that guy gave a vibe he isn't interested in meeting her but would be all nice to her on the group chat. The thing about that guy is he is super nice to everyone. I have spoken to him a lot and he has shared all his dating stories and stuff.
He clearly told me he isn't interested in meeting her much. He gave a weird vibe and I thought it is better to keep my friend away from him. No bad, it just how he is.

I didn't want my friend to know the real reason as I thought it would hurt her. So I told her not to ask her for a hangout, if he asks on his own, go ahead and meet him. Talk but don't make a plan as such from your side.
The moment I said that,she got upset with me, she was like tell me the reason or I won't listen. I was surprised why is she getting so upset over a stranger. It isn't like I am asking her to do a big thing. That ended up in a full blown argument between us. 
She turned me into a villain. She said unless I give her a reason,she won't listen. So I made up that, he is seeing other girls, don't give him so much importance right now. She said your reason is stupid and childish. I will ask him 2-3 times for a hangout, if he says No then I will stop asking. 
I was like please don't. Please,please don't. 
She wasn't ready to listen. I couldn't understand the reaction. Because it isn't like he is her friend that she is ready to pick him over me. She said you are acting like this because maybe you are upset with him hence you are saying all this.

We've all been there, staring at our morning coffee, wondering if high school dreams about being an astronaut are still valid or if we should just settle down with a nice Netflix binge. 

Midlife can feel like you're on a treadmill. You're moving, but not really getting anywhere. This is the perfect time to ask: **What do I *really* want to do?** Are you ready for a new hobby, or thinking about a late-career pivot? 

**Let‚Äôs break it down: Hobbies vs. Late-Career Pivot**

### Hobbies: The Sweet Escape 
There are so many great reasons to dive into a new hobby, especially when your soul feels a little dry. Here‚Äôs why it can totally rock your world:
- **Stress Relief**: Crafting, gardening, or even learning a new language can shake off that daily grind.
- **Community Connection**: Joining a local group or online community sparks new friendships! And who doesn‚Äôt love a friend with a shared interest?
- **New Skills**: Ever wanted to paint? Write a novel? Dance like nobody‚Äôs watching? Now‚Äôs your chance!

### Late-Career Pivot: The Bold Move
But what if the itch is deeper? What if you just can‚Äôt ignore that urge to switch careers? It‚Äôs scary, but think of it this way:
- **Cha-Ching üí∞**: Sometimes a new career can lead to a bigger paycheck. I mean, who doesn‚Äôt want to bump up their retirement savings?
- **Skill Utilization**: You might find that your past jobs have given you skills you didn‚Äôt even know were valuable. 
- **Life Reinvention**: Imagine waking up excited about Monday instead of dreading it. Yeah, that sounds nice!

So, which path are you leaning towards? A cozy new hobby or diving into the deep end of a career switch? 

Here's the kicker, folks. **We believe in the strongest people!** Whether you‚Äôre dusting off an old guitar or putting in the work to get that certification for a totally new industry, you‚Äôve got what it takes.

A massive crowd of civilians, hundreds of thousands of people, came to the United Planets base. As they stood outside the gates, Carter soon came to meet them. But as he saw Daisy limp and filthy in one of their arms, unconscious, his heart nearly stopped. His promise to Mary echoed through his mind as he hurried to her aid.

*""What happened to Damara? Were you attacked?""*¬†Carter shouted.

""No, General Carter.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen what happened?‚Äù

‚ÄúDamara worked relentlessly around the city, saving people. We don't even think she took the time to eat or drink. So when she finally collapsed, we brought her here.""

‚ÄúWe had to come here anyway. But Damara‚Äôs health made it more urgent.‚Äù

Carter swiftly took Daisy out of the civilian's arms into his own. His gratitude for them was apparent as he tightly gripped her body.¬†

""Thank you. Now, please come in and wait for instructions. We need to get you all to safety.""

\*\*\*

The sunset came over the battle of planet Aqua. In the infirmary, the staff ran about caring for the hundreds upon hundreds of patients. The medical ward was over two thousand square feet and nearing capacity. Daisy still lay unconscious in a bed off in a corner. Still, the doctors screamed orders at the nurses as they treated the injured, stirring her from sleep. The commands repeated themselves again and again, growing louder from desperation.¬†

*‚ÄúMore bandages, more disinfectant, more antibiotics.‚Äù*¬†A doctor shouted.

Daisy finally awakened from her slumber to jump out of bed, screaming.

*""The people?""*¬†Daisy shouted.

A nurse came to Daisy. ""Damara, be calm. The evacuations are running as we speak. Please get back into bed.""

Daisy heeded the nurse's orders, and as she sat down, she noticed Carter, sitting in a chair beside her, asleep.

""Carter, I mean General Carter.‚Äù Daisy pointed her trembling finger at him. ‚ÄúH-how long has he been here?""

""He hasn't left your side since you came.‚Äù The nurse giggled. ‚ÄúI'm not one to gossip, but the other nurses and I think our handsome general has a crush.""

Daisy uttered a chuckle. ""I‚Äôm flattered.""

Daisy spotted Lucas hooked up to life support, unconscious, with Sarah sleeping by his bedside.¬†

Daisy stared at Lucas, turning her shaking finger to him. ""My friend. Will he be okay?""

""That pilot suffered a concussion, and one of his broken ribs punctured a lung. He might not have made it this far had we operated later.""

""But he'll make a full recovery?""

""I-I don't know.""

Daisy took a deep breath. ""Whose in command right now?""

""General Favian.""

""Has he ordered any action against the enemy?""

""None that I know of.""

""Thank you for your diligent care. But I have to go now."" Daisy zoomed out of the room.

\*\*\*

Yara guided Daisy to Favian in his office. The place was a mess, with his trident on the floor amongst broken pieces of furniture and dozens upon dozens of scattered papers and books from the Nemesis attack. As she saw him, shock covered her face. He sat on his desk, his blue skin now pale, as if he were awaiting death with a frown. But still, she ran to him with dire urgency.

""General Favian, what are we doing to repel the enemy?""

""It doesn't matter.""

*""W-what do you mean?""*

""We don't have enough troops left to attack the fortress. And I can't call in reinforcements because the Nemesis ships are coming back. If I move them now, we risk losing more territory.‚Äù Favian gripped his forehead. ‚ÄúI knew the retreat from earlier was a trap, but I still fell for it.""

""Why can't we call for help from General Lev or R√≥ngy√π?""

""Neither would get here in time.""

Daisy quickly pulled Favian off the desk, trying to intensely shake sense into him.

""Listen to me, man. As long as there's time and breath in our bodies, we can't give up.""

‚ÄùDamara, I‚Äôve been dedicated to the cause for years.‚Äù Favian pushed Daisy away. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve forsaken my very culture to keep going in this vile war.‚Äù

Daisy looked at Favian, awaiting more information. As he saw her, he sighed, struggling to force his mouth to surrender the details.

‚ÄúI still remember the dark day as a child. You see, my people champion pacifism. We find the taking of any life to be unforgivable. So, we were unprepared when the Nemesis attacked the first time.‚Äù Favian sat on his desk again, placing his hand over his face. ‚ÄúMadman Zola subjected prisoners to unspeakable experiments. It was only by the gods that Orion arrived in time. I swore, even if I had to forsake every value I held, I would never let that evil befall anyone again.""

""I understand. Yara, please give me and the general a little privacy?""

Yara fulfilled Daisy's request and swiftly left. Daisy searched the room as she was gone, ensuring no prying eyes and ears. Favian looked at her, bewildered, as she rummaged through the debris. But soon she reverted from Damara to her original form before Favian's eyes. And he nearly jumped out of his blue skin as he saw the transformation.

""Please, be calm, General Favian. It's still me, but I'm in my true form. And my real name is Daisy David.""

""Orion did say there were details about your identity we couldn't know. So why are you telling me this?""

""I needed to tell you we were in the same boat. I was an ordinary seamstress, and I didn't think I had the strength to be a warrior.‚Äù Daisy pulled Favian to his feet. ‚ÄúBut when the time came to do the right thing, I had to soldier on, no matter how much it tore me apart. Please don't give up.""

Favian gazed at Daisy. Her genuine form appeared like fragile porcelain. The hero of the galaxy was a young human woman who looked as weary as he was. Her words reverberated through his mind, becoming louder and louder as he thought about them. But slowly, he took up his trident from the floor, gripping it tightly with his will to fight reignited.

""Let's go.""

\*\*\*

Daisy and Favian hurried into Eugene's lab. And they found him sitting by his lab table, recording something on a holophone panel.

""Eugene, what are you doing?"" Daisy asked.

""Well, Damara, seeing that I'm going to die here. I decided to write my will for the family on Earth.""

""Don't send it just yet.‚Äù Daisy banged her fist on his table. ‚ÄúWe can still win this, and we need you to pull it off.""

""W-why, how?""

""We can fend off the legion of Nemesis ships coming here. But we need you to fix your guardian barrier.""

""I-it doesn't matter.‚Äù Eugene shook his head vigorously. ‚ÄúWith that stupid fortress up, it can pop again like a balloon.""

‚ÄúEugene, we‚Äôre going to take it down. We‚Äôll use every power, every weapon, every drop of strength. But it‚Äôll mean nothing without your help, so please.‚Äù

Eugene gazed deeply into Daisy‚Äôs eyes. He saw sincerity as well as unrelenting determination. They pierced through his despair with their strong emotions. And as he punched his forehead, he made a reluctant decision, cracking a crooked smile.

""I guess it's time to be a man. I still think we're doomed, but I'll do my best either way.""

As she heard Eugene, a smile overtook Daisy's face. Quickly, she hugged him tightly, pressing him against her breasts. And being so close to the beautiful Damara made him blush bright red, his spine becoming as stiff as a board.

""Thank you, Eugene.""

*""N-no problem. Now, please, let go of me. My heart is about to burst.""*

Meanwhile, at darkhold, another explosion went off. A small ship flew away from the fortress. The Nemesis was in hot pursuit, firing at it. Inside, freed slaves cowered in fear as their savior struggled to evade the enemy forces. It was the female human slave Cymbeline argued with on Placentia: Anastasia. But the enemy hit them, sending them all crashing into a swamp.

\*\*\*

At the base, Yara ran up to Daisy and Favian, short of breath.

""Thank the lawgiver, I found you two. We have a new problem.""

""What could it possibly be now?"" Favian asked with a heavy breath.

""It's a distress signal, General Favian. And according to our readings, it's the United Planets code. But get this, it's coming from a swamp near darkhold.""

""Do they think we're that foolish?‚Äù Favian uttered a dry laugh. ‚ÄúIt's a trap.""

""B-but what if it's not? The initial onslaught did a lot of damage,"" Daisy said.

""You want to make sure, don't you?""

Daisy nodded to Favian's question.

""Very well then, Damara. Verify this signal and then get back here quickly. In the meantime, we'll rally our remaining forces, agreed?""

""Sir, yes, sir.""

Later, Daisy sneaked through the dense vegetation of the swamp. As she neared her destination, she pulled out a pair of binoculars to survey the area. And she spotted Anastasia and the other slaves near their crashed ship. Seeing the injured in their group, Daisy dashed over. But as she reached them, she stepped on a twig, alerting Anastasia to her presence. She shot at Daisy with her plasma gun. However, she dropped her weapon and covered her mouth with her hands, seeing Daisy guarding behind her shield from the attack.

*‚ÄúI-I am so incredibly sorry,‚Äù*¬†Anastasia said in Russian.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not familiar with that language. Can you please speak Novice?‚Äù

‚ÄúI was apologizing for almost shooting you, Damara. Truly amateur work,"" Anastasia said in Novice.

Daisy looked at Anastasia's clothes and recognized their design.

""You're a human slave. But how can this be? I thought you were all liberated.""

""It all started a little before you saved the Earth. My government gave us a mission to infiltrate the enemy and transmit any vital information. We knew that the high-ranking officers received slaves. So we took it as an opportunity to get close to their secrets. I‚Äôve had to do quite a few dirty things.""

""They treated all of you like animals, didn't they?""

""Worse than animals. But it was worth it to get this."" Anastasia pulled a small black chip from her hair and handed it to Daisy. ""This chip contains the secret to destroying a fully charged darkhold fortress.""

""Really? What is it?""

""I don't know. The file I got is encrypted. I had to get myself and these people out before General Cymbeline burned us to ash.""

Daisy kissed the chip. ""I don't know how to thank you for your bravery and sacrifice.""

""Win this war, and that will be gratitude enough.""

A roaring sound filled the air. Anastasia looked for the source, and she spotted the terrifying answer. A squadron of Nemesis ships had found them. The enemy swiftly initiated an air strike, bombarding them with plasma. But Daisy grew her shield to a giant size, protecting everyone on the ground from the attack.

*""Damara, listen to me. Abandon us and get the chip to the United Planets.""*

""You're insane.""

""We're dead weight, and before we escaped, I overheard them say the repairs on the fortress were almost complete.""

As the bombardment intensified, a realization plagued Daisy's mind. She knew getting them to safety on Flaremane was impossible. The squadron would pick them off like lambs to the slaughter. And she couldn‚Äôt stay and fight either. Every passing second drew the darkhold fortress closer to raining terror again. But as she glanced at the crashed ship, she made a gamble in her stubbornness to protect everyone.

""Everyone, please get into your ship over there quickly.""

*""What?""*¬†Anastasia shouted.

""I beg you, trust me.""

Anastasia reluctantly led the slaves onto the ship. As they were all inside, Daisy summoned Flaremane. She hurried to her stallion, picking up the crashed ship. She swiftly launched her shield at the attacking forces. And as they evaded the assault, Daisy raced away with the slaves through the air.

The squadron promptly gave chase to Daisy, shooting at her. One of their shots grazed the ship, and Daisy quickly called back her shield. When it came to Daisy, it cleaved through some of them, leaving the rest to continue the attack. But as the shield blocked their onslaught, Daisy pulled on Flaremane's reins, summoning his speed to escape.

\*\*\*

Daisy arrived with the slaves at the United Planets base. As she dismounted from Flaremane, she gently placed the ship on the ground. The slaves soon exited the vessel, running to the infirmary as she directed them, but Anastasia, instead, slowly walked up to Daisy, her lips tightly pursed.

""Damara, why did you risk the information for us? Don't you comprehend what's at stake?""

""Of course I do, but the one thing worse than losing this war would be a Cadmean victory. The moment we deem it acceptable to sacrifice innocents is when we lose.""

Anastasia's eyes widened as she heard Daisy. But her face soon formed a smile.

""My name is Anastasia Nikolaev. During training, they taught us to keep our names secret. So please consider this gratitude for everything you did.""

""I'm honored."" Daisy giggled.

Like thunder, Daisy heard something big collapse. The sounds of rioters followed, and she dashed to the commotion to learn why.

Inside the tower, Daisy reached the final generator in a chamber of several hundred square feet in diameter. Daisy scanned the room for enemies, but as she found none, she prepared to destroy the generator, winding her hand to toss her shield. But as a cold breeze ran past her shoulder, the familiar chill made her glance backwards. In that second, Daisy dodged Morana's icy death beam.

""Why won't you die, Damara?"" Morana spat.

‚ÄúUnfortunately for you, I have too much to live for.‚Äù Daisy retorted.

Swiftly, Morana flew herself and Cymbeline over to the generator, blocking Daisy's path.

""Like going out of your way to protect the western scum?"" Cymbeline shot a giant fireball at Daisy.

""Please understand Mavor‚Äôs using you. I know what happened to your planet during the first galactic war.‚Äù Daisy deflected Cymbeline‚Äôs fireball with her shield, bouncing it into a wall. ‚ÄùBut revenge will only make things worse.""

""That's where I disagree. You see, I'm a firm believer in revenge. And seeing this part of space burn will make me and many others quite happy.""

Daisy gazed at Morana, asking for her response with a look.

Morana uttered a sigh. ""And I believe in lesser beings accepting their place in the dirt.""¬†

Daisy tightly clenched her teeth as she heard Morana's response. However, as she went to attack her, Daisy stopped herself. And she turned her gaze back to Cymbeline.

""Cymbeline, please, I bet half the people who wronged you have already died.""

*""Then their descendants must pay,""*¬†Cymbeline shouted.

Quickly, Cymbeline hit Daisy with a massive inferno. And Morana joyously giggled, seeing Daisy burn to ash. Still, she stopped as something appeared within the flames.*""What the?""*¬†A colossal pillar of white fire emerged. Daisy stood in the middle, looking at her adversaries with a glare.

""I wish it didn't have to be that way,"" Daisy said.

Daisy hurriedly increased the brightness of her flames, blinding Cymbeline. But Morana defended against the attack, using her wings as cover, firing back at Daisy with her ice. The room quickly filled with steam from the ice melting. Disoriented, Daisy narrowly avoided a knife to the face from Morana. With her blocking the generator, Daisy tossed her shield at Morana, but she caught it with a smug smile. However, it spun faster and faster in her hand, burning flesh until she released it, screaming, the weapon flying over to the generator.

As the shield neared its target, Cymbeline regained his sight, catching it with a growl.¬†*""Drop dead.""*

Quickly, Cymbeline tossed the shield into the air, and Morana imprisoned it in an iceberg. He drew his weapons, two reaping hooks, pouncing on Daisy. His landing knocked her away with fiery shockwaves. The deadly couple charged Daisy from two sides and swung their weapons furiously for the kill. She tried to evade. Still, Cymbeline‚Äôs hook cut her shoulder, and as she was weakened, Morana's ice blade hurried toward her head. However, as the blade was inches from Daisy's face, help sped through a door. Carter ran past Cymbeline, catching Daisy in his arms and nearly stabbing Morana in the same spot on the stomach she stabbed him.

""Carter, you're okay,"" Daisy said, overjoyed.

""I'm not going down that easily, Damara. Now let's put the ice bitch down once and for all.""

""But wait, what about Cymbeline?""

""What about him?""

Suddenly, Cymbeline's back sprayed blood, and he dropped to the floor face-first, revealing the slash Carter had made on him. Carter had moved so fast that none of them saw him attack Cymbeline. Morana and Daisy looked at the fallen warrior in shock. But Carter instead gazed upon his work with cold apathy.

""C-Cymbeline.‚Äù Morana shed tears, shooting a glare at Daisy and Carter. ‚ÄúI swear I'll get you both for this.""

Carter gently put Daisy down on her feet, eliciting a smile. ""I would choose my final words more carefully.""

Morana seethed at Carter but stopped, replacing it with a smile, looking behind him. Carter followed her gaze, seeing Cymbeline slowly getting back up. Carter moved like the wind, but as his sword neared Cymbeline's neck, it only hit the air. In a crimson blur, Cymbeline charged at Daisy with his reaping hook. Inches from decapitation, Daisy evaded the attack, leaving a small flaming cut on her cheek.

Still, she extinguished the fire on her cheek, rubbing it with a little spit.

""You are strong, Damara. Your head should be on the floor right now,"" Cymbeline said.

""How are you still alive? I slashed a vital organ. I know I did.""

""Good thing that it was a regenerating synthetic one.""

*""What?""*

""You see, you get those from a childhood of breathing toxic miasma from enemy bombing.""

‚ÄúAnd my family slept in our crumbling home in a neighborhood where murder was the norm. Cry me a river.""

Cymbeline growled at Carter and moved to resume the battle. But Daisy stood between them, keeping the two apart.

""Cymbeline, I wouldn't be as blunt as General Carter, but he's right. All this violence is senseless. Please, stop now before anyone else loses their life.""

Daisy looked at Cymbeline for an answer, and as he glared at her, she got it: no.

Daisy took a deep breath. ‚ÄúThen you leave me no choice.‚Äù

Hastily, Daisy‚Äôs shield burst from the iceberg. It zoomed toward Cymbeline and Morana, smacking them both in the face. And headed toward the generator.

""Not this time,"" Morana said.

Morana shot an ice blast at the generator, creating a thick defensive shell around it. The shield bounced off the shell back to Daisy's hands. And she stood with Carter to battle the deadly couple. Swiftly, they took action. Cymbeline covered the floor with a sea of intense flames. And from above, his beloved rained a storm of razor-sharp icicles, ensnaring their opponents from two ends.

In return, Daisy summoned the flames of purity, protecting her and Carter from the onslaught. And he jumped to Morana, slashing through the icicles with his sword. Until he reached the Nemesis general, sending her crashing down as her ice shield absorbed the blow from his blade.

""You have some nerve, human,"" Cymbeline said, seething.

Cymbeline took his hate-filled eyes off Daisy to aim at Carter. But at that moment, Daisy launched her giant shield at Cymbeline, sending him flying to the generator. Still, as he got closer, he plunged his feet into the floor, stopping his momentum, and shot back. However, Daisy recalled her weapon, defending against the fireball.¬†

Soon, Carter charged at Morana, swinging his sword. Daisy summoned her twin shields and went to Cymbeline. The couples battled their adversaries with immense ferocity as blows flew left and right. The ribs and limbs were the favored targets of both sides.¬†

As Morana battled Carter, she peppered him with her death beams. Still, he moved too swiftly to hit. As Carter approached, she forged two broad swords to meet blades, but they both broke upon contact. But as Carter swung his sword at Morana, nearing a fatal strike.*""Enough.""*¬†Morana released an intense wave of cold. However, again, her assault was ineffectual as Carter and his blade were undeterred and she narrowly evaded another killing strike.

""How are you‚Äî""

""Still going? My new uniform is thermal. Not to mention, I specified for a friend to make my sword resistant to intense cold."" Carter interrupted.

Hastily, Carter prepared to continue his assault, but a fireball from Cymbeline broke them up. Still, in retaliation, he did the same, ending his battle with Daisy with an energy slash.

Carter hurried to Daisy. ""Damara, are you okay?""

""I'm fine, thanks.""

""Good. Now, let's hurry up and win this. I'm over fighting these losers.""

""You took the words right out of my mouth, vermin,"" Morana said.

""You know what‚Äî""

Carter's vision became blurry and he dropped to the floor as his legs became jelly.¬†

Daisy dashed to his side. ‚ÄúCarter, what's wrong? Are you injured somewhere?""

""I-I feel so lightheaded. I would kill for some strawberry pancakes with bacon right now.""

""Afraid that won't do you much good, human. With me gradually heating your brain, you'll be a goner in about a few minutes.""

*""What?""*¬†Daisy shouted.

""It's this thing I can do with a lot of time and concentration. But let's speed this up.""

Cymbeline summoned his trump card. Flames covered his body, spinning faster around him until they formed a monstrous fire tornado. The instrument of his enemy's doom zoomed across the room, leaving destruction in its wake.

Desperately, Daisy tried to drag Carter out of harm's way, but the tornado's suction pulled them in. She sank her fingers into the floor, trying to resist its pull. But as her grip weakened, Carter looked at her with a smile.""I'm sorry, red."" Carter made Daisy release him, using the last of his strength to stab her hand with his sword. He went with the tornado as it burst from the chamber, set ablaze, falling through the air. And Daisy watched, crying, as her beloved fell to his doom. However, more calamity came as rubble fell on top of her, burying her alive.

1nl09lh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1nl09lh/aita_for_being_frank_with_my_friend_about_her/,AITA for being frank with my friend about her red-flag boyfriend,"My friend, Sam (23F) was a NBSB before this whole thing. We were college friends along with five other girls. When we graduated college and went our separate ways, we still communicated via Facebook messenger and arranged meet-ups and trips. Last April we went to a resort for a swimming trip. While we were hanging out and just catching each other up on what's been happening with our lives, Sam confessed that she's been crushing on a co-worker (29M). At first, we were thrilled because this is the first time for her having a crush on a real guy, minus the fictional characters ofc. However, she told us that the guy likes another girl, which turned out to be one of her close friends at work. My excitement turned to annoyance when she said she is confused of his actions. According to her, he acts real sweet (giving her gifts, coffee in the morning, having conversations that lasts till 3am). In short, he's been giving her mixed signals. What got me mad was his message to her just that morning saying ""Oh you're on a trip? Did I give you permission to go?"" I asked her what their relationship was and she answered ""friends"". At that moment, I told her to cut ties with him because he is obviously a red flag. She agreed that his actions were a red flag and said she will distance herself. 

Now to the good part lol. Two months ago, she told us via the group chat that she's in a relationship. Obviously, we were all so happy for her. We congratulated her and asked for details on the boyfriend. She kept being cryptic and giving us obvious descriptions like ""he has two eyes, one nose. etc"", avoiding the question of who he is. I then had this bad feeling that the boyfriend may possibly be the red-flag co-worker. And I was right. I asked if I can call her because I wanted to ask her what changed. I want to know if he changed. Trish (23F), one of our close friends, set up a time for all of us to be in a call. 

In the call, she said that the guy only told her that he likes their other friend because he wanted her to be jealous. I calmed myself down because she was still telling the story. She also said that the reason why they got together was because she asked him what his intentions were, what his actions meant. He then said he likes her, not their other friend. He liked their other friend before, but now he likes her. Just these information is enough for me to know that he's just using her. I asked her if he apologized to her for manipulating her into thinking that he liked their other friend just to make her jealous. She did not answer. I told her that what he did was so wrong in every sense of the word. I also said that if that is how he gets a girl's attention, that's fucked up. I told her that I won't tell her to break up with him, but I need her to understand that what he did was wrong and that he did not apologize for it. After that, she hasn't talked to me.

1nl07w1,https://i.redd.it/dfiksxcnp3qf1.jpeg,Orea Z1 - Quick and simple,"Morning brew with the freshly acquired Z1. Coffee was a Colombia Gesha from AMOC. Here are some thoughts: 

- The Z1 was very easy to work with and gave me a great coffee with practically no effort. It‚Äôs very thick and sturdy plastic, doesn‚Äôt feel cheap at all (which it isn‚Äôt‚Ä¶).
- Used the Lazy morning recipe with 60s bloom, 20 clix on the C40. It stalled a tiny bit towards the end, so probably 21-22 clix is a better range. 
- Compared with a V60 side by side. I‚Äôd say the Z1 was brighter and more intense, V60 a bit more toned down, but not a night and day difference. I think the differences are more in brewing experience and consistency.
- Clean up was easy: unscrew the body, dump the coffee in the bin, quick rinse under the tap, done.
- What I liked the most: very consistent compared to V60 (only made 3 brews so far with it), quick and easy. Less mentally demanding, can mostly zone out and get good coffee, V60 demands more attention from me. Comes with a nice little cloth bag, perfect for travel and taking to the office.
- What I disliked: price was a bit over the top, but a melodrip by itself costs 2/3 of the Z1 price in EU (38‚Ç¨ MD vs 60‚Ç¨ for Z1) so I wouldn‚Äôt consider it too bad.
- Bonus: loved watching the bottom beads of coffee coming out, very zen in the early morning :)

About the coffee: delicious! Tons of aroma, I got intense minty flavours and aromas, and also some zesty lime (packaging said peach, darjeeling and lime zest).",6,1758278817.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

She has a really weird lifestyle (I mean, everyone can do what they want, but for me it‚Äôs weird). She‚Äôs scared of perfume even though she has no allergic reaction to it. She even forces her co-workers not to wear any makeup when she‚Äôs around. She always made it clear that she will not allow anyone to wear perfume in her house ‚Äì not even visitors. When I stayed at her house, I would bring my own shampoo and stuff so I didn‚Äôt have to use theirs, as a form of respect. One time, my belongings were gone and my bf told me that his mom had taken them and hidden them in her bedroom.

As time passed, I learned more and more about her behavior. Everyone at home seems scared to voice their opinion because she always gets mad and manipulates things so that she ends up being the one who‚Äôs right. She doesn‚Äôt care about your thoughts and will use any opportunity to crush your voice and what you stand for.

When my bf and I moved in together, she started to control our life and always wanted to tell us what we should use for our household. When I was cleaning the apartment before putting all the furniture in, she yelled at me and my bf for ‚Äúrisking ourselves‚Äù by using regular cleaning products, saying we would get cancer because of me.

After finishing our apartment, she started to ask what we ate every single day. And she would ALWAYS say: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not real food. You‚Äôll die if you continue eating that stuff.‚Äù She always wanted us to come to her house and eat. Not as an invitation, but as a strict rule. I refused to eat her food because, first of all, she can‚Äôt even cook properly, and second, I wanted to make it clear that I will not tolerate this kind of controlling behavior. So I stayed home whenever she told us to come over. Of course, my bf still went to his mom.

I never really had an opportunity to cook for us because she would always take that away from me. She even made him lunch for work, as if I was too dumb to do it. I tried to fight back by preparing food before his mom texted him, but he still went to her house, and my food ended up in the trash because I couldn‚Äôt eat that much.
.

When I realized that my actions didn‚Äôt work, I started to communicate with her directly. I politely asked her to leave the cooking to me and told her she didn‚Äôt need to put so much effort in ‚Äì we are adults and can take care of ourselves. I also explained that when my bf wants lunch for work, he can always ask me, but usually he doesn‚Äôt eat at work anyway because he‚Äôs too busy and doesn‚Äôt take breaks. He even says so himself.

She then went into passive-aggressive mode and said: ‚ÄúYeah, you‚Äôre right. You‚Äôre both old enough to cook and take care of yourselves. But you went too far with this. It‚Äôs not a personal attack, just my opinion. I love you. See you next time üòò‚Äù

I thought she understood and would finally stop. But she didn‚Äôt. She kept doing this shit.

Recently, I stopped reacting because it only stressed me out. But then there was this one moment where she invited us for coffee, and I knew she was lying. I asked my bf to say something to her because I wanted to cook food. He agreed before we left the apartment. As soon as she started offering us food, I noticed that my bf said nothing. So I stood up and said it wouldn‚Äôt be necessary because we had food at home and I planned to cook anyway.

Again, she hissed at me like a snake and refused to listen. She offered me nothing but a salad while she made a whole pot of potatoes for him. After he finished one plate, she kept putting more on his plate so I wouldn‚Äôt have a chance to feed him later. I felt disrespected by her ‚Äì and by my bf as well. He says I‚Äôm just overreacting.

She doesn‚Äôt respect my boundaries, and she always talks badly about every girlfriend in the family, saying we ‚Äúcan‚Äôt provide for her little babies‚Äù and that she has to do it all by herself. She‚Äôs an attention seeker and even hurt herself once. After the doctor told her what to do, she did the complete opposite so her injury got worse, and then she ran to everyone to show off how much she was suffering.

Sorry for all the details, but I just had to tell someone about this. I‚Äôm tired of this shit. I love my bf so much and nothing would make me leave him, but it gets harder every day to deal with her bullshit. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I really need your opinion on this.

So being a Mainer and having plenty of time on my hands and knowing that I‚Äôll get to where I‚Äôm going to eventually, I went to go see the cheese shop. Well, I get to this kind of ‚Äúdisheveled‚Äù farm. And next to a small refrigerator there is a sign that explains what kind of cheese they have and how much it costs. I open the door to the refrigerator and there are all the cheeses. All laid out. I select my cheese and I put my money in the coffee can that‚Äôs on the lower shelf of the door. Now here‚Äôs the revelation. Why do I live in Maine? Not only is there a person who makes cheese and there are people who buy cheese, but the person that makes the cheese trusts the person buying the cheese to do the right thing. The cheese maker knows that no one will steal his cheese or the money in the coffee can. That really sums up what we believe in as a people. There‚Äôs a trust in each other that is we don‚Äôt question; that everyone will do the right thing. Everyone is equal. You don‚Äôt see the cheese maker or the customer, but their mutual trust defines us as a people, and our faith in our people drives this state. That‚Äôs how I want to live.

I wanted to share a money-saving tip that many people overlook: loyalty card apps and supermarket apps are absolute goldmines for hidden discounts and digital coupons.



Many retailers offer exclusive in-store-only deals that you can only access through their mobile apps. These aren't just generic coupons - they're often personalized based on your shopping history and location. Here are some key benefits:



‚Ä¢ Location-specific discounts: Some deals are only available in certain stores or regions

‚Ä¢ Digital-only coupons: Many stores offer app-exclusive coupons that won't appear in print circulars

‚Ä¢ Targeted offers: Retailers analyze your purchase patterns to offer personalized discounts on items you actually buy

‚Ä¢ Flash sales: Limited-time offers that pop up throughout the day, only visible in the app

‚Ä¢ Bonus point multipliers: Extra loyalty points for specific categories or products



The key is to check these apps before you shop, not after. I make it a habit to scroll through my loyalty apps while having morning coffee, and I'm always surprised by the deals I find. Some of my favorites include major supermarket chains, pharmacy apps, and even gas station loyalty programs.

I texted up front the budget.

Met for coffee.

We are going to the movies and/or diner. I won't bust any moves, I won't drink (that's my tip to the guys), I will pick up and drop off. I have a late model SUV. Not so much romantic but a demonstration of treating them well.

I will wait for them to suggest the next move. Happy to do another date or two without busting out any moves, no problem at all.

I will pay for dinner movies etc of course but won't offer any money before intimacy. Yup, if there is no intimacy that's fine but we are just hanging out.

Then I will either let them suggest something involving intimacy, or not.

Or I might suggest that I could get a romantic place at a nice beach near the city where there are walks and a fireplace.

1nkzvvo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nkzvvo,Ghost Hunters Project- Character Design Critique,"Hello everyone! I've been working on this for awhile and I would appreciate a critique on color and character design. As this is a color block-out the line work is still in its sketch phase- so rest assured the lines won't stay the same.

Below is a short summary of the characters so you can see if their design reflects it well. From left to right:

1. Jed is the manager, he tells where the hunters go to delete the ghosts from various households. He did field work until an accident forced him to retire. His design reflects his lack of care for bureaucracy, only doing the bare minimum so he's allowed to focus on the safety and preservation of his hunters. 

2. Bonnie is a ghost hunter with a license in exorcism (people call her when crap really hits the fan). She's living life by the seat of her pants and doesn't care much about her safety. Her attire is her way of actively goading the ghost to give it their best shot.

3. Jenna is apprenticing under Nathan with a goal of researching ghosts to find more peaceful methods of disposal. She believes that there is more to them than the monsters they're seen as- she just needs proof of it. Her design reflects her starry-eyed and naive nature, using lighter and colorful colors compared to the other characters. The choice of a t-shirt and shorts was to show her outgoing nature.

4. Nathan is a ghost hunter, his job is to find and identify the ghost for easier disposal. He's a more reserved person with a chip in his shoulder regarding ghosts and he certainly has *opinions* about them. He dresses more down-to-earth and practical with longer sleeves to help deal with the colder temperatures ghosts bring and his trusty fire poker to defend himself.

5. Mary is a person trying to deal with the loss of her husband. She lives day by day, going to work and just... existing with the guilt that weighs her. Until she started noticing strange things happening in her home. It grew frequent enough that she was forced to call in some ghost experts. I decided to draw her in her work attire (cafe/coffee shop uniform) to further iterate just how she's not really focusing on herself anymore. Her skin tone was a choice to give her this sickly look too.

6. The ghost of her husband hangs around her, unseen but felt nonetheless. He wants to tell her something but his voice goes unheard. The ghost's design will keep its sketchy-look with rough line-work, grid lines, and scribbles. I'm taking inspiration from rough concept sketches where the building blocks are laid out before any ink is placed. Ghosts are an abstract shadow of themselves, no longer human, no longer ""real"", just there in vague scribbles that resemble their past selves.",11,1758277621.0,characterdesign,0,1.0,False

Hi everyone!
My boyfriend and I (we‚Äôre a gay couple from Spain) are planning a trip this coming February. Our main destination will be Tallinn, Estonia, but we‚Äôll also spend about a day and a half in Helsinki before taking the ferry to Tallinn.

We‚Äôre not really looking for romantic stuff ‚Äì more into history, culture, museums, local food, and exploring interesting neighborhoods. We chose Tallinn because it looks beautiful and less crowded, and February seems like a nice time to avoid overtourism.

A couple of questions we‚Äôd love advice on:

Must-see things in Tallinn in winter (any historical sites or museums that are especially good that time of year?).

Day trips near Tallinn that are doable by train/bus in February (we were thinking maybe Tartu, Haapsalu, or something similar).

General tips about visiting in winter ‚Äì how to deal with the cold, what‚Äôs open/closed, things to watch out for.

Any hidden gems for food, coffee, or local experiences.

We‚Äôll be traveling on a budget, but not backpacker style ‚Äì looking for a balance of affordable and comfortable.

Any suggestions or tips would be super appreciated!

Thanks in advance üôè

I‚Äôm a 30-year-old nerdy Mechanical Engineer, part-time wizard, and full-time dad. Life threw a few curveballs, and I‚Äôve been busy raising an awesome little human, but now I‚Äôm back‚Äîready for meaningful convos, bad jokes, and maybe a little chaos-induced flirtation.

I‚Äôm sarcastic by default, emotionally available, 420-friendly, and a certified master of midnight drives and museum detours. I love gaming, geeky chats, and stepping on Lego (ouch) more than I‚Äôd like to admit.

Looking for someone smart, quirky, open-minded, and okay with me occasionally pausing mid-convo for bedtime routines. Bonus points if you love coffee, cosy nights, or debating pineapple on pizza.

Shoot me a message with your worst dad joke and let‚Äôs see where this weird and wonderful ride takes us. Worst case? Meme exchange. Best case? Magic! ‚ú®",1,1758277540.0,snapchat,1,1.0,False
