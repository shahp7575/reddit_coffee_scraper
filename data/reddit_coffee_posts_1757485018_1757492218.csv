1nd89t8,https://www.reddit.com/r/DCU_/comments/1nd89t8/dcu_batman_movie_idea_based_off_under_the_red_hood/,"DCU Batman movie idea based off ""Under the Red Hood""","Just to be 100% clear I am actually working on a script of this

Act 1

Batman finds Jason Todd stealing the wheels off the batmobile and takes him in giving him the title of Robin since Dick Grayson is now Nightwing and we see Batman and Robin taking down criminals but Bruce has to stop Jason cause he's a brutal with his attacks almost killing one of the gangsters

A few months later and we see Batman fighting against Joker while Jason looks for a bomb somewhere in the building but it turns out it was a trap and Haley Quinn drugs Jason and kidnaps him 

When Bruce escapes the explosion after losing Joker who sets off the bomb Bruce looks everywhere for Jason and even has Nightwing join the search until a week later when Bruce receives a tape that was sent to the GCPD and shows Joker beating Jason to death over a week with a crowbar along with the tape is the crowbar with Jason's blood on it


Act 2

5 years later we find out crime bosses are going missing an a mysterious crime boss is taking over the Gotham under city we then cut to a meeting between some gang members of a drug moving operation when they are cut off by the head of their leader being dropped on the table from above then it pans up to show Red Hood on a walkway on the second floor overlooking the meeting room where he announces that he's taking over the operation and that anyone who doesn't like will be killed

We cut to Bruce trying to track down the new crime lord but is having a hard time cause it's not easy to know where he'll show up until later that night while on patrol he's confronted by Red Hood but Bruce immediately attacks knowing Red Hood is a shot first talk later kinda person Bruce chases down Red Hood, Nightwing also joining in cause he was nearby helping search for the Red Hood cause he had also been taking out crime bosses in Blüdhaven but they lose him when he disappears down a subway tunnel 

We see Red Hood's main operation and finding out that soon he's going for the guy all of the minor crime bosses were working for Black Mask but Black Mask knows he's next so he hires Deathstroke and sends him and his own enforcers to go try to take out Red Hood 

While Batman is trying to work out part of the recording he had of the gotten that he can't quite make out what Red Hood said he is distracted when he gets an alert that Red Hood is fighting against Deathstroke 

Batman reaches the location and finds Red Hood fighting again Deathstroke and multiple armed enforcers when he joins in they start taking them down but Jason starts killing some of the enforcers which makes Bruce start trying to subdue both Red Hood and Deathstroke but Red Hood pulls and quick one and almost kills Deathstroke before Batman stops him 

Jason gets cut by Deathstroke before Bruce can knock him out and Jason uses a smoke bomb to escape but Bruce doesn't follow he has more pressing matters he gets the blood sample off Deathstroke's blade and goes back to the lab to test it 

While testing it Bruce is talking to Nightwing about who he thinks it could be never but is cut off and goes deathly silent when the bat computer matches the sample to Jason Todd we then hear a loud crash and pan over to see Alfred looking emotional and dropping a tray that had coffee for Bruce and Dick 


Act 3

We go back to right after Jason was killed and we see Ra's Ah Ghul finding his body in a ditch and taking him back to his base where he puts Jason into the Lazurus Pit which revives him saying he's going to be their strongest weapon

Talia being against it cause she begrudgingly cares about Bruce sneaks Jason out and for 4 years before he goes back to Gotham she traines him in secret and helps him regain his sanity 

Going back to present we see Joker being transported to Arkham when the convoy is taken down and Jason kidnapps Joker

Bruce is about to go find Jason when the bat signal turns on and he goes but he doesn't find Jim Gordon he finds a person who works for Jason who gives him an address 

When Bruce gets their he finds Red Hood helmet on waiting for him they start talking and Bruce reveals that he knows Red Hood is Jason and Jason takes off the helmet and starts yelling at Bruce about how his code doesn't help people it just postpones the pain that will come and when Bruce apologizes for not saving him Jason gets mad saying he isn't mad at him for that he's mad that the Joker is still alive while smashing a closet door showing the Joker tied up 

Jason pulls Joker out of the closet and throws a gun to Bruce and gives him a choice before pointing a gun at Joker's head ""shot me or I'll blow his brains out"" and gives Bruce 5 seconds but just as Jason is about to fire Bruce throws a batrang cutting Jason's hand and making his hand pull back so he misses the shot 

Bruce goes to check on Jason but he pushes Bruce away and it's revealed that the bullet Jason had shot hit the rope on Jokers arms allowing him to get out and as soon as Jason pushes Bruce Joker stabs Jason is the chest with the Batrang and grabs one of Jason's smoke bombs using it to escape 

Bruce rushes Jason to the batcave and Alfred rushes into military mode since he had been both a soilder and a medic and gets Jason stabilized

A few days later Jason wakes up in the cave surrounded by monitors keeping track of his vitals and he sees Bruce in the corner cowl off still covered in Jason's blood from the other night he tries to check in on Jason but Jason tells him to get out and Bruce is about to say something before respecting Jason's wishes and leaving 

Alfred walks in as Bruce leaves and goes upstairs to the manor and Alfred starts checking him over while Jason talks a little shit about Bruce then Alfred tells him how hard losing him the first time was and that Bruce was so worried about losing again that Bruce hadn't left his side in 3 days and that Jason really shouldn't be so hard on Bruce, Alfred agrees that someone should take care of the Joker but he also knows their is a reason Bruce doesn't and he respects that cause that's who Bruce is

Alfred leaves to go get some water and food for Jason and Jason looks back on how good Bruce was to him and how he tried to help Jason be better then the people they went after 

We see Bruce in Jason's old room unchanged and Jason walks in and sits next to Bruce on his old bed and they have a heart to heart where he Jason says he'll never be what Bruce wants him to be and Bruce will never be what Jason wants but they both come to the understanding that they don't need to be cause they are family and Bruce hugs Jason saying he missed him and Jason hesitantly hugs Jason saying ""I missed you too old man"" before getting up to go eat breakfast and Jason says he probably shouldn't have gotten up so soon cause his stab wound is still hurting like hell

We ended up spending a lot of time together talking at the psych ward, and it only took a couple of weeks before she told me I was the only one she felt safe around, both inside and outside the hospital.

I also started to noticed that I was the only one (out of both the staff and other patients) in the ward that could calm her down.

After we were both discharged from the hospital we kept in touch and we have met up a couple of times, I kind of see her as a daughter, and I'm trying to mentor her through things and give my perspective on things that happens and explain why I think other people behave the way they do, and she seems to respond very well to our talks.

The only times she has called me has been when she's been in a really bad state, and a couple of times either from the emergency room, or in an ambulance on here way there after SH when she's needed someone to talk to or come and sit with her in the waiting room for support.

Every other time I've been the one who called or texted her first, and every time we've met for a coffee or to go for a walk I've been the one that took the initiative.

Yesterday she texted me and asked if we could take a short trip and do some shopping and have some lunch on Friday.

It just makes me so happy that she takes the initiate to do something and not just isolate herself in her apartment.

In a way I feel proud that I've managed to do something the health care system in our country hasn't been able to do for many years, make her feel that she's got a life worth living.

I’d already made it almost home when I could tell I didn’t have a choice but to find a shady spot or shit myself. But I live in a really built up area with no hidden spaces or public toilets. There was a cafe that I bought coffee from earlier and they were closing up. It was life or death because I could tell if they weren’t going to let me use their loo I was going to poop my pants right there. 
I begged, I pleaded I think the horror of my impending fate to shit myself in public as a 40 year old woman was etched all across my face. 

However the woman dismissed again and again (with a very judgmental “off you go” like I’m some sort of crackhead)

Anyway I was close to tears and she caved but not without a lot of backhanded comments about how she’d just cleaned them and how I was lucky blah blah blah 

Where is peoples empathy? It’s a toilet, I’m not asking for the blood of your first born. Your day isn’t made any worse (I made sure I cleaned the toilet before I left)
But my whole week would have been ruined if I had to shit my pants. 

Anyway I won’t be buying my coffee from there again, it was ironically probably what fucked my stomach up anyway ",0,1757490469.0,perth,5,0.5,False

1nd7zyp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1nd7zyp/i_cant_seem_to_make_myself_care_that_im_ruining/,I can't seem to make myself care that I'm ruining my own life.,"I'm recently 20, a broke, first-generation, third-year university student. The title may sound dramatic for my age, but please just hear me out (and perhaps give an opinion, anything helps really).

My life has been spiraling out of control for the last year and I don't know how to fix it. I just hate being alive; I hate driving and taking the bus and doing my laundry and cooking and I hate getting up in the morning and going to bed at night I hate my back pain, breathing, the weather, the fact that I suck, the fact that I've sucked for a while, the fact that I'm not getting better I hate all of it. I'm so fucking sick of it all. Don't get me wrong, I don't want to die. It'd be such a waste to die like this (even though I feel like I wasn't meant to ever live this long). I feel insane. Please don't recommend getting diagnosed or seeing a professional or anything. I don't have insurance, time, or money.

I can't focus on my school work at all. I've always had trouble with that, but it keeps getting worse and worse, especially now that I've moved out. I procrastinate and procrastinate and I never study. Even when I do try to study, I just zone out and think about literally anything else. Usually, I give up and end up pacing around my room for hours. I don't even think about anything, which makes me feel a little crazy. Last year, I failed two different classes three times in a row. Now I have trouble sleeping and can't stop shaking the nights before exams. If I fail another class, I'll have to drop out of my major. Dropping out of school is not an option for me, nor is dropping my major. If either of those things happen, my life is over. I won't have the money to go back and try again, not for a long time at least and I can't let that happen. I know it sounds dramatic (and technically I don't even have to be here!) but I really can't handle that happening. It IS my life. I can't let this go.

Just the thought of it is making me tear up a little, but when it comes to actually getting to work, I can't do it. I don't love my major (last year, I realized I would've rather gone a different route, but I can't afford to start over), but I don't hate it or anything. Right now, I don't understand a single thing going on in any of my classes. I feel so stupid compared to everyone else. I used to be a pretty alright student (all As and Bs and such), but now I struggle to get even the simplest things done. Just thinking of life beyond graduation makes me feel ill, but I need to start preparing now so I have a fighting chance at employment.

I've never had dreams or aspirations past the age of twelve, and I lost all of my drive to do better around the age of fifteen for some reason. I feel so apathetic all the time. My sister recently asked if I hated her after I didn't react when she had an honest conversation with me. I felt insane. I only ever feel fear and anger once I'm suffering from my mistakes (98% of which are the results of procrastination), and I handle those emotions so well that they don't really have an effect on me like they should. I'm not learning from my mistakes. I'm not growing as a person like I should be. My head is always split, one side saying that no matter what I do, things will just turn out alright anyways because I'm so lucky. The other side tells me that I'm ruining my life, and that I'm gonna get got if I keep this up. Logically, I think the latter is right.

I haven't slept well in a long time either. I go to bed at 4 almost every night, and I get up around an hour before work or my classes (both in the morning). I had a bout of insomnia when I was a preteen, and ever since then I've hated sleeping. I feel like I'm wasting my time when I sleep, but I seem to be suffering from this mindset so I'd like to know how to go about that too. My skin is seriously fucked up too. It's aging me bad. I think my weight too, but that's not really the point here.

Money-wise, I won't rely on my parents. My dad has always made just enough to keep our family well. I'm not adding any other burdens on him if I can help it. I have a work-study job that pays me well enough for what I need. I have a huge fear of debt of any kind. I've been like this since I was a child. My family was never poor, so I don't really know where it comes from. Sometimes, I go on little spending sprees and other times, the thought of spending makes me ill and makes me shake.

Now don't get me wrong, my life isn't awful or anything, but that's exactly why I don't understand my behavior. I have an alright social life and hobbies that I enjoy when I feel grounded enough to enjoy them. I don't drink or smoke, nor do I drink coffee. Sometimes I crave sugar a little too much (so much that it makes me a little crazy), but I'll get that figured out somehow. My parents love me. I do my best to stay fed. I'd go more in depth about everything, good and bad, but I think you guys get the idea.

I don't understand why I feel so crazy. Sometimes, I don't even feel like myself. I can't get out of my own head and I need to so desperately. I can't get out of this cycle of not doing something, berating myself for it, and then doing the same damn thing again and again and again. I don't like being alive. I want to be at peace so bad. How do I find peace? Please don't recommend meditation. I can't even commit to what matters. Someone, please help me. I haven't been myself in so long. I was okay for a while. I want to be okay again. 

On a different note, I've been thinking about getting an iPad to replace my notebooks so I can focus a little more in class on the extra information instead of the slides. I don't know if it would be a worthy investment. Please give a little opinion on that if you want, after everything.

It felt like:

- cotton wool stuffed inside my brain 
- extreme fatigue but unable to stop scrolling and jumping from app to app
- had coffee in the morning but after that could get up to eat. I had to go to the bathroom so I ate the easiest thing in the fridge which was some olives in a plastic tub (honestly if it was in a jar I probably wouldn’t even have bothered) 
- tension in my forehead 
- struggling to keep up hygiene 

I’ve had these episodes before and am on Ritalin but today was something else and the anxiety of being online but not actually working is awful and the moments of panic. I want to be productive. 

Does anyone else have the same experience?

1nd7y0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1nd7y0m/the_great_coffee_spill_of_2025/,The Great Coffee Spill of 2025,"So, I’ve been working from home for about a year now, and I thought I had everything down to a fine art. I had my routine: wake up, shower, grab a cup of coffee, and settle into my makeshift office (a.k.a. my dining table). Little did I know that today would be different.

This morning, I was feeling particularly ambitious and decided to make my favorite coffee drink: a fancy latte with all the bells and whistles. I brewed the coffee, frothed the milk, and was ready to enjoy my masterpiece when the unthinkable happened.

As I was walking back to my table, I tripped over my cat, Mr. Whiskers, who had decided that lying in the middle of the floor was his new favorite pastime. In slow motion, I watched as my precious latte flew from my hand, spiraling through the air like a caffeinated comet.

It landed—not on the floor—but right on my laptop. I stood there in shock, my heart racing as I quickly tried to salvage my computer. Mr. Whiskers, seemingly unfazed, just gave me a look that said, “You should’ve seen this coming.”

After frantically wiping coffee off the keyboard, I decided to take a break and let the laptop dry. I went to the couch to sulk and scroll through Reddit for some distraction. That’s when I saw a post titled, “What’s your most embarrassing work-from-home moment?”

Feeling a surge of confidence (or maybe it was just caffeine-induced insanity), I decided to share my story. I typed it all out, complete with dramatic flair and a few puns about “brewing” trouble.

Within minutes, the comments started rolling in. People were sharing their own coffee disasters, and some even suggested I should officially rename my laptop “Latte 2.0.”

In the end, not only did I get a good laugh from the comments, but I also learned to keep my coffee far away from my laptop. Lesson learned: Mr. Whiskers is always plotting against my caffeine intake!",1,1757490211.0,story,0,1.0,False

I dragged myself down the cobblestone path. My body ached. My feet hurt. But my heart was singing. 

""Just a few more hours,"" I whispered. ""Until tonight."" 

Tonight was everything. No more going back to that house. No more pretending they were family. 

I'd already asked for time off work. My boss spat at me. Called me lazy. Typical. Omegas always got the worst treatment. 

But I didn't care tonight. 

I was going to Gabriel's. My boyfriend. Soon-to-be fiancé. 

Tomorrow was the Lunar Assembly. Sacred ceremony. Wolves finding their mates under the Moon Goddess. Tomorrow was also my eighteenth birthday. Finally old enough. 

Gabriel promised we'd bond tomorrow. I could escape forever. 

Gabriel. Rich. Gorgeous. An Alpha's brother. Sure, I was just an omega. But Gabriel said bloodlines didn't matter. Love mattered. 

I practically skipped toward his house. My heart hammered with excitement. Beautiful stone building in the center of town. So much better than our pathetic wooden shack. Soon I'd live here. With Gabriel. Forever. 

I knocked eagerly. 

Nothing. 

My smile faltered. That's... odd. Gabriel said he'd be waiting. He promised. 

I tried the handle. Unlocked. Relief flooded through me. He must be inside. Maybe preparing a surprise? 

""Gabriel? It's me!"" I called out cheerfully. 

Silence. 

Wait. What was that? Sounds from upstairs. My heart lifted again. He was home after all. 

Then I heard it clearly. 

Laughter. 

Female laughter. 

Moaning. 

My world stopped spinning. No. No, that couldn't be— 

My feet moved on their own. Step by step. Up the stairs. Each step felt like walking to my execution. 

The sounds grew louder. Clearer. Destroying me with every breath. 

Gasps. Bed springs creaking. A voice that made my soul shatter. 

""Oh God, Gabriel... right there..."" 

Valerie. My stepsister. 

My brain refused to process it. This wasn't happening. This was a nightmare. I'd wake up any second. 

The bedroom door hung slightly open. Like a cruel invitation to witness my destruction. I saw them. 

Gabriel's muscled back. Moving. Valerie's pale body beneath him. Her golden hair fanned across his pillow like a victory flag. 

No no no no no. 

""You feel so much better than I imagined,"" Gabriel panted. 

My heart exploded into a thousand pieces. Each word was a dagger. 

Valerie laughed. That cruel, sharp sound I knew so well. ""Better than that pathetic omega sister of mine, I bet. Poor little Sera probably doesn't even know what to do with a real man."" 

The air left my lungs. I couldn't breathe. Couldn't think. Could only feel the agony ripping through my chest. 

""Don't."" Gabriel's voice was rough. ""Don't mention her when we're like this."" 

""Why not?"" Valerie's fingers traced his spine like she owned him. ""After tomorrow, she'll know exactly where she stands. An omega like her could never satisfy you."" 

Each word was a physical blow. I stumbled backward, gasping for air. My shoulder slammed into the wall. The sound echoed like a gunshot. 

""What was that?"" Valerie hissed. 

My wolf surged forward. Rage I'd never felt before. My foot connected with the door. It crashed against the wall. 

""WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?"" 

They jumped apart. Gabriel nearly fell off the bed scrambling for his pants. Valerie just sat up. Didn't even cover herself. 

""Seraphina!"" Gabriel went white. ""I can explain—"" 

""Explain?"" My voice cracked. ""Explain how you're screwing my sister?"" 

""It's not what you think—"" 

""IT'S EXACTLY WHAT I THINK!"" Tears streamed down my face. ""You lying, cheating bastard!"" 

Valerie stretched. Finally reached for Gabriel's shirt. ""Oh, sister dear. You really thought he'd choose you?"" She tilted her head. Mock sympathy. ""How cute."" 

""Valerie, don't,"" Gabriel warned. But his voice was weak. 

""Don't what? Tell her the truth?"" Valerie stood up slowly. ""That Mom and Dad have known about us for months? That they practically threw me at Gabriel because they were embarrassed by their precious Alpha family being tied to an omega reject?"" 

The world spun. ""You're lying."" 

""Am I?"" Valerie moved to the mirror. Ran her fingers through her hair. ""Why don't you go home and ask them? I'm sure they're waiting. Probably with our engagement announcement."" 

""Sera, listen—"" Gabriel finally got his pants on. ""This doesn't have to change anything between us. We can still be friends—"" 

""FRIENDS?"" I lunged toward him. He caught my wrists. 

""You need to calm down,"" he said. His grip was tight. Bruising. ""Think about your position. Your family. You don't want to make this worse."" 

I stared into his eyes. Eyes that had whispered promises just days ago. Now they were cold. Calculating. 

""Let go of me,"" I whispered. 

""Sera—"" 

""LET GO OF ME!"" 

I wrenched free and ran. I burst through our front door. Victor and Elizabeth sat calmly in the living room. An elegant invitation lay on the coffee table between them. 

They showed no surprise at my tear-stained face. 

""You already knew?"" My voice was barely a whisper. 

""Seraphina, sit down."" Victor's voice was ice. ""Yes, we know about Gabriel and Valerie. We fully support it."" 

Elizabeth picked up the invitation. Held it out. ""This is their engagement announcement. Tomorrow at the Lunar Assembly, Gabriel will propose to Valerie. They hope you'll attend as Valerie's sister."" 

I stared at the beautiful invitation. Gabriel and Valerie's names in gold. The silver Nightshadow crest. It was all real. 

""Why?"" My voice cracked. ""Why would you do this to me?"" 

""Enough!"" Victor shot to his feet. Backhanded me across the face. Hard. I crashed to the floor. My cheek burned. 

""You're nothing but an abandoned child we took in out of pity. What right do you have to insult our daughter?"" 

""You should be grateful we raised you."" Elizabeth's voice was cold. ""Now you know your place. Tomorrow you'll bless your sister's engagement. Then find yourself a suitable omega mate."" 

""I won't!"" I struggled to my feet. Tasted blood. ""I'll never bless this betrayal!"" 

Victor raised his hand again. This time I was ready. I dodged and ran for the door. 

""Get out of our house!"" Elizabeth shrieked behind me. ""Ungrateful little brat!"" 

I fled into the night. Running blindly. Tears falling like broken pearls. 

I didn't know where I was going; I only knew I couldn't stop moving or the crushing pain would swallow me whole. I didn't know how long I ran, but eventually I found myself on Main Street when a familiar voice made me stop. 

""Sera!"" 

I spun around to see Ophelia running toward me, her dark hair flying behind her. 

""I saw you run in—what happened? You look like you've seen a ghost."" 

""Worse."" I collapsed into her arms. ""I've seen the truth."" 

""Tell me."" 

So I did. Every horrible detail, every cruel word. Ophelia held me while I shook. 

""Those bastards,"" she hissed when I finished. ""All of them. Gabriel, Valerie, your so-called parents."" 

""What am I going to do?"" I cried against her shoulder. ""Tomorrow is the Lunar Assembly. Everyone will see Gabriel and Valerie's engagement. I'll be the laughingstock of the entire pack.” 

""Listen to me, Sera."" Ophelia stroked my hair gently. ""We're not waiting for that damned ceremony. Tonight, we're going to Silver Moon Harbor!” 

""What?"" I pulled back to look at her, still having tears on my face. 

""I heard there's a huge party in Silver Moon Harbor tonight. Lots of wolves from other packs who are here for tomorrow's ceremony will be there."" Ophelia's eyes sparkled with excitement. ""We're going to have some fun and forget all about these bastards and your heartless family!” 

""But... but I..."" I hesitated. As an omega, Silver Moon Harbor was completely foreign territory to me. 

""But what?"" Ophelia gripped my hands. ""Sera, you've lost everything here. Instead of staying to be humiliated tomorrow, let's go to Silver Moon Harbor and try our luck. Maybe you'll meet your real destined mate—someone who won't give a damn about your bloodline.” 

I looked into Ophelia's determined eyes, thinking about the cruel words I'd heard in Gabriel's bedroom, remembering my parents' cold faces, imagining the humiliation I'd face tomorrow… 

""Okay."" I wiped away my tears, feeling a fierce courage I'd never experienced before. ""Let's go to Silver Moon Harbor tonight. Let all those people go to hell!” 

Ophelia grinned with delight. ""Now that's my Seraphina! Come on, let's go back to my place and get ready. Tonight, we're going to show the most beautiful girl!"" 

#  Chapter 2

 

Ophelia dragged me back to her small apartment above the bakery, her eyes blazing with determination. ""We're not letting those bastards win,"" she declared, pulling out makeup and rifling through her closet. 

She spun around, holding up an emerald green dress that perfectly matched my eyes. ""Tonight, we show them what they lost."" 

The dress was beautiful—silky and elegant, with a flowing skirt that hugged my curves in all the right places. 

As Ophelia worked on my makeup, carefully applying smoky eyeshadow that made my green eyes pop, I felt something shifting inside me. 

""There,"" Ophelia stepped back, admiring her handiwork. ""Now you look like the goddess you are."" 

I barely recognized myself in the mirror. The woman staring back at me looked confident, mysterious, beautiful. Nothing like the broken omega who'd fled Gabriel's house just hours ago. 

""Come on,"" Ophelia grabbed my hand. ""Silver Moon Harbor awaits."" 

""I can't believe we're actually doing this,"" I whispered as we approached the grand entrance. 

""Believe it, honey,"" Ophelia grinned, straightening her own dress and passed me a mask. ""Tonight, we're not wolves from nowhere. Tonight, we're mysterious beauties who belong wherever we damn well please."" 

The ballroom took my breath away. Crystal chandeliers cast rainbow patterns across marble floors, and hundreds of werewolves in elegant attire mingled beneath soaring ceilings. Everyone wore elaborate masks, adding an air of mystery to the already intoxicating atmosphere. 

""Holy shit,"" I breathed, then immediately covered my mouth. 

She pressed two tequila shots into my hands, raising her own. ""To new beginnings and leaving the past in the dust!"" 

The alcohol burned down my throat, but it was a good burn—cleansing, like it was washing away the bitter taste of betrayal. Ophelia immediately ordered two more. 

""I don't usually drink this much,"" I protested weakly. 

""You don't usually find your boyfriend screwing your sister either,"" she pointed out. ""Extraordinary circumstances call for extraordinary measures."" 

By the third round, I was feeling deliciously dizzy and incredibly free. The pain was still there, but muffled now, wrapped in cotton and shoved into a corner of my mind. 

""Dance with me,"" Ophelia pulled me toward the crowded dance floor, and for the first time in hours, I smiled genuinely. 

We lost ourselves in the music, spinning and laughing like we didn't have a care in the world. Other wolves watched us with interest, but I was too caught up in the moment to care. This was what freedom felt like. 

When a slow song began to play, I was about to suggest we get some air when I felt a warm hand capture mine. 

I turned, and my breath caught in my throat. 

The man standing before me wore an elegant silver mask that covered the upper half of his face, but what I could see was devastating. Strong jaw, sensual lips curved in a slight smile, and eyes... God, those eyes. They were the deepest blue I'd ever seen, so dark they were almost black, but when the light hit them just right, they seemed to shimmer with silver. 

""The most beautiful woman in the room wouldn't refuse a dance, would she?"" His voice was like aged whiskey—smooth, rich, with just enough roughness to make my pulse skip. 

I should have said no. Should have remembered that I was hurting, that I'd just had my heart shattered. Instead, I found myself placing my hand in his and letting him lead me onto the dance floor. 

""Why not?"" I heard myself say. ""Let's dance."" 

He was tall—at least six and a half feet—with broad shoulders that filled out his expensive suit perfectly. When he pulled me close, I could feel the solid warmth of his chest, the careful strength in his hands as one settled on my waist and the other cradled my palm. 

""I've been watching you since you walked in,"" he murmured near my ear, his breath sending shivers down my spine. ""You're absolutely captivating."" 

The compliment should have felt empty—we were strangers, after all—but something in his voice made it feel genuine. 

""You're not from around here, are you?"" I found myself asking, tilting my head back to look into those mesmerizing eyes. 

""What gave me away?"" There was amusement in his voice, and I could see his lips curve into a more genuine smile. 

""You don't feel... local."" It was hard to explain, but his scent was different from the wolves I'd grown up with. Richer, more complex. 

""Very perceptive."" His hand on my waist tightened slightly, drawing me closer until there was barely an inch of space between us. ""I'm here for friends. I would have arrived sooner."" 

""And what about you?"" he continued, spinning me slowly before pulling me back against his chest. ""Let me guess—dragged here by a well-meaning friend as well?"" 

I laughed despite myself. ""Something like that. Though her methods are a bit more aggressive than most."" 

We moved together like we'd been dancing for years instead of minutes, our bodies finding a rhythm that felt as natural as breathing. 

""You have beautiful eyes,"" he said suddenly, his voice dropping to barely above a whisper. ""Like emeralds in moonlight."" 

""I could say the same,"" I replied, mesmerized by the way his eyes seemed to catch and hold the light. ""I've never seen eyes quite like yours."" 

The song was ending, but neither of us made any move to separate. If anything, he held me closer, his hand sliding from my waist to the small of my back. 

""I think I need some fresh air."" 

""Come with me."" He led me toward a dim corridor that led to the emergency exit. 

""I really want to kiss you. May I?"" I nodded. 

Chapter 3

His hand slid from my waist to my thigh, lifting my leg to his waist. By then I was completely lost, feeling his body pressed against mine. I was desperately craving, pulling him closer, wrapping my leg around his waist. 

""Your kissing skills are great."" I smiled at him, feeling tremors throughout my body. 

He kissed me all the way to the top floor, finally even carrying me in his arms. We entered a luxurious suite, and as soon as we entered, his hand slipped under my skirt, caressing my most sensitive places. When his fingers explored inside, I moaned softly. ""You're so incredible. "" he said, kissing me even more forcefully. 

I could feel the chemical reaction between our breaths, this attraction was so strong, as if it was arranged by fate. He quickly unzipped his pants, his movements as skilled as if he had done it countless times, tore off my underwear, and caressed my entrance as if asking for permission. He looked into my eyes again and asked: 

""What do you want me to do?"" 

""I want you inside me right now."" I responded shamelessly, already burning with desire. I had never been like this before—usually I would have retreated the moment he grabbed my hand, but tonight I promised to enjoy myself fully, to live in the moment if I met interesting people. And that's exactly what I was doing, living in the moment. 

Hearing my words, he slowly entered me, watching me throw my head back, savoring every inch of him—he was really big. He took the opportunity to leave a string of kiss marks on my neck. When he was completely inside, he paused and whispered in my ear: ""Now I'm going to move."" 

He withdrew only to thrust back with full force this time, the feeling was so incredible. I was completely lost, driven mad by his crazy movements as he went in and out of me frantically. 

We lost control, completely lost ourselves, as if nothing else existed around us. I felt my vision blur as the climax began to build, and I moaned softly in his ear. At that moment, he seemed to go crazy, lifting my other leg to his waist as well, and I wrapped both legs tightly around him. He kissed me intensely, thrusting into me even more forcefully—that was heaven on earth. 

I moaned in his mouth and reached an incredible climax, but he didn't stop, and soon another climax began to build. I climaxed again, more intensely than before, leaving me almost unable to breathe. When I climaxed, he whispered that feeling me pulsing around him brought him close to his limit, and soon I felt his burning release inside me. 

""You're really amazing."" He kissed my neck, whispering in my ear. 

Perhaps it was the alcohol driving me, or perhaps his rich scent made me dizzy. I don't know how many times we did it, my last memory stopped at him kissing me, softly asking what my name was, and I no longer had the strength to answer. 

The next morning, I woke up with my head pounding like a jackhammer, feeling like someone had taken a sledgehammer to my skull. The bed beside me was cold and empty—nothing but rumpled sheets where he had been. If it weren't for the purple kiss marks scattered across my neck and collarbone, I might have convinced myself that the entire night was just some vivid, alcohol-fueled dream. 

I stumbled out of bed on unsteady legs, my body still aching in places that reminded me exactly how real last night had been. The mysterious man had vanished without a trace—no note, no phone number, not even a stray piece of clothing. Even after everything we'd shared, we'd never removed our masks. I had given my virginity to a complete stranger on the eve of my eighteenth birthday. 

""Sera."" 

The voice exploded in my mind like a thunderclap, making me jump so violently I nearly fell over. My heart hammered against my ribs as I spun around the empty hotel room, searching for the source. 

""Who's there?"" I whispered, panic creeping into my voice. 

""Relax, it's me—I'm your wolf. You can call me Ayla."" 

The realization hit me like a bucket of ice water. My wolf. Of course! At eighteen, I'd finally awakened my wolf consciousness. I'd heard stories of exceptionally gifted wolves who could communicate with their inner beasts from childhood—Valerie had been bragging about talking to her wolf since she was twelve. But naturally, someone like me would be a late bloomer even in this. 

""Oh God, Ayla..."" I sank onto the edge of the bed, running my hands through my tangled hair. ""I'm so sorry. With everything that happened yesterday, I completely forgot. It's... it's wonderful to finally meet you."" 

""We have much to talk,"" Ayla's voice was warm but urgent in my mind, ""but first—"" 

My phone's shrill ringtone cut through our mental conversation like a knife. I lunged for it, seeing Ophelia's name flashing on the screen along with a notification showing twelve missed calls. My stomach dropped. 

""Sera!"" Ophelia's voice erupted through the speaker before I could even say hello, pure fury radiating through every syllable. ""Where the hell did you disappear to? I've been worried sick! If you don't have the explanation of the century, I swear on the Moon Goddess I will hunt you down and tear you apart with my bare hands!"" 

""Ophelia, I'm so sorry—"" I began, but she cut me off. 

""Sorry? SORRY? Do you have any idea how terrified I was? A whole night! I thought someone had kidnapped you or worse!"" 

Guilt crashed over me in waves. I took a shaky breath and launched into the whole tale—the mysterious man, the dancing, the passion, waking up alone with nothing but marks on my skin and a splitting headache to show for it. 

The line went dead silent. For a moment, I wondered if the call had dropped. 

Then Ophelia's voice came back, but now it was filled with barely contained excitement rather than rage. ""Oh my God, Sera! You actually did it! You had a one-night stand with a gorgeous mystery man!"" She paused, and I could practically hear her grinning. ""Okay, I'm officially no longer mad at you. In fact, I'm proud of you! After what that bastard Gabriel did, you deserved a night of mind-blowing passion."" 

Relief flooded through me, but then her tone shifted slightly. ""Though please tell me you two were smart about protection..."" 

The question hung in the air like a sword about to drop. My stomach plummeted. 

""Oh shit,"" I breathed, my face draining of all color. 



# Chapter 4: Chapter 4

 

Seraphina's POV 

One month later 

I sat in the cramped waiting room of Whispering Valley's only clinic, my hands trembling as I clutched the appointment slip. For the past month, I'd been staying at Ophelia's place. 

The morning sickness had started two weeks ago—violent waves of nausea that left me retching into Ophelia's toilet bowl every sunrise, even though I'd taken emergency contraception the day after my encounter with the mysterious stranger. 

Ophelia squeezed my hand, her own face pale with worry. ""Whatever happens, we'll figure it out together, okay?"" 

Dr. Matthews emerged from his office, a kind elderly man who was one of the few pack members still willing to treat omegas with basic dignity. 

""Seraphina,"" he said softly, settling into the chair across from us. ""Child, you're pregnant."" 

Blood rushed to my head, creating a roaring sound in my ears that drowned out everything else. Pregnant. With the mystery man's child. 

""What?!"" Ophelia's voice exploded beside me, her shock matching my own. 

""But... but we only had one night..."" I stammered, my voice barely above a whisper. 

""One night is all it takes,"" Dr. Matthews said gently, his eyes kind but serious. 

""You're about six weeks along."" He leaned forward, studying my face with concern. 

I stumbled out of the clinic on unsteady legs, Ophelia's arm wrapped around my waist to keep me upright. I was numb to everything except the thundering of my own heartbeat. 

Gradually, tears began spilling down my cheeks. 

""Ophelia, what am I going to do? I don't even know who the father is. I never saw his face clearly, and I'm just an omega. If the pack finds out I'm carrying some stranger's child..."" 

""Stop,"" Ophelia wiped my tears away with fierce determination. ""First things first—we need to tell your parents. No matter what happened between you all, they need to know."" 

But when we arrived at the Knight residence, I was greeted by Victor's explosive rage before I could even cross the threshold. 

""Where the hell have you been?!"" His voice boomed across the front yard, drawing stares from neighbors. ""You've been missing for an entire month! Do you have any idea how you embarrassed us by disappearing right before Valerie's engagement ceremony? You selfish little brat!"" 

I knew perfectly well that Valerie and Gabriel wouldn't have delayed their precious engagement for me—they'd probably celebrated my absence. Fighting back a wave of nausea, I forced myself to meet his furious gaze. 

""I need to tell you something important,"" I said, my voice stronger than I felt. 

""You need to apologize is what you need to do!"" Elizabeth appeared behind him, her face twisted with disgust. ""Running off like some common whore, making us look like fools in front of the entire pack."" 

""I'm pregnant,"" I blurted out, the words falling like stones into sudden silence. 

Victor's face went through a series of expressions—shock, disgust, then blazing fury. In one swift motion, he grabbed my arm hard enough to bruise. ""What did you just say?"" 

""I said I'm pregnant."" I tried to pull free from his grip, but his fingers dug deeper into my flesh. 

""Enough!"" Elizabeth's voice cut through the air like a blade. ""We don't care about your excuses. What we care about is that you're carrying some bastard's child and expecting us to deal with the consequences."" 

""You have two choices,"" Victor snarled, his grip tightening until I gasped in pain. ""Get rid of it, or get out of our house. We will not raise some stranger's spawn or let you drag our family name through the mud any further."" 

""No!"" I instinctively wrapped my free arm around my still-flat stomach. 

""Then you can pack your things and leave,"" Elizabeth said coldly. ""We won't give you a penny. A pregnant omega with a bastard child? You'll be the laughingstock of every pack for miles."" 

They were right about one thing—I needed to leave. I couldn't stay in this prison they called home, couldn't subject my child to the same abuse I'd endured. 

""Fine,"" I said quietly, yanking my arm free from Victor's grasp. ""I'll leave."" 

I climbed the stairs to my tiny room for the last time, pulling out the battered suitcase I'd brought when they first adopted me ten years ago. There wasn't much to pack—a few worn dresses, some books, the small savings I'd accumulated from my diner job. 

As I descended the stairs, suitcase in hand, Elizabeth and Victor watched me with expressions of cold satisfaction. 

""Don't expect to come crawling back when reality hits,"" Victor called out as I reached the door. ""You made your bed with whatever random wolf you spread your legs for. "" 

The words should have hurt, but I felt strangely numb. I walked out into the crisp evening air, leaving behind the only home I'd known since childhood. Ophelia was waiting by her car. 

""You're staying with me now,"" she announced before I could say anything. ""No arguments. We'll figure out the rest as we go."" 

""Ophelia, I can't ask you to—"" 

""You're not asking. I'm telling."" She grabbed my suitcase and threw it in her trunk. ""Besides, you think I'm letting my future godchild grow up without Aunt Ophelia spoiling them rotten?"" 

Despite everything, I felt a smile tug at my lips. ""Godchild?"" 

""Damn right."" She paused, studying my face. ""Though... we should probably think about what you want to do long-term. Whispering Valley isn't exactly the most progressive place for single omega mothers."" 

The memory of those mesmerizing blue-silver eyes flashed through my mind, followed by the echo of whispered endearments in the darkness. 

""We're going to be okay,"" I murmured, not sure if I was talking to Ayla, the baby, or myself. ""We'll figure it out. We have to.""

1nd7wnw,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_theonlineforyou/comments/1nd7wnw/embracing_passive_income_strategies_for_a/,Embracing Passive Income Strategies for a Future-Proof Lifestyle,"In today’s fast-paced world, finding ways to build wealth without being chained to a desk is more important than ever. Passive income is not just a financial trend—it’s a mindset shift that allows you to design a lifestyle that works for you. Whether you're dreaming of early retirement, more travel, or simply more time to do what you love, passive income is the golden key to unlocking that freedom.

**Why Passive Income Matters**

Let’s face it—relying solely on one active income stream can be risky. Job markets fluctuate, industries evolve, and unexpected challenges can appear at any time. But with passive income, you create streams of money that flow in even when you’re not working. It provides financial security, peace of mind, and flexibility. When set up properly, passive income can help cover your expenses, fund your dreams, or build generational wealth.

**Top Passive Income Ideas to Explore**

1. **Rental Properties** – Investing in real estate can offer long-term returns with minimal day-to-day management once it's up and running.
2. **Digital Products** – Whether it's an ebook, a course, or printables, digital content can be sold repeatedly with no ongoing production costs.
3. **Dividend Investing** – Earning regular payouts from stock investments is a classic passive income method that grows over time.
4. **Peer-to-Peer Lending** – Lending money to individuals or small businesses can yield steady interest returns with relatively low effort.
5. **Royalties from Creative Work** – If you're musically inclined or a skilled writer, royalties from your creations can keep money flowing for years.

**Creating a Future-Proof Lifestyle**

The best part of passive income is that it frees up your time. Time to explore, to build, to relax, or to reinvent yourself. You get to live on your own terms. But remember, while the income might be passive, the effort to set it up is not. Building these income streams takes planning, consistency, and sometimes a learning curve. However, the payoff is worth every bit of it.

**Passive income 2025** is not just a financial strategy—it’s a lifestyle revolution. The earlier you begin to integrate passive income streams into your life, the more resilient and flexible your future becomes. Imagine waking up knowing that money is working for you while you enjoy a cup of coffee, pursue a passion, or plan your next big adventure. That's not just income—that’s freedom.",1,1757490059.0,u_theonlineforyou,0,1.0,False

I recently saw people using NFC tags to automate keeping track of things around the house. For example an NFC tag next to the coffee maker to scan when coffee runs out, which then adds coffee to the shopping list on the phone. 

However, I find nfc tags too cumbersome. 
For using them I would always have to search for my phone and then return back to the coffee maker to scan that tag… and in that time, I would have instead easily just written down this to my notes app manually. Especially, when I would setup multiple tags around the house, think milk, toilet paper, cleaning supplies, etc. scattered around the house. 

That’s why I thought of getting some really cheap small buttons, that when pressed send a signal to the phone to trigger the addition of that product to the shopping list. Then I could place that button next to the coffee maker and eliminate the usage of my phone for it. 

However, I am not sure what the best way to go about this. I thought of getting some cheap buttons from aliexpress or such running Zigbee to do this and then pair it with home assistant. 
But I have always just seen these buttons used as light switches/aircon switches, etc.  

Since I don’t have any experience with home assistant as off yet (but I have a computer science degree, so I’m not too worried about the technical/programming aspects involved), I wanted to ask if you think my plan is good or if you have any alternatives that might work better or cheaper (again, I am not worried about a technical setup involved, I just mainly want it to work reliably and be cheap per button, concerning battery usage and the initial cost of buying them). Also if you see other options for this, not involving buttons all together, I am also open for alternatives. 

Thank you for your support and ideas! :)

We initially bonded over our shared love of indie games and somehow ended up talking every single day since then. Video calls, voice chats, the whole deal. They seem genuinely amazing and all their social media checks out as legitimate, but I know I need to be smart about this.

The thing is, I've never actually met someone from the internet before. Like I've heard all the horror stories and watched enough true crime documentaries to know that meeting strangers from online can go sideways real fast. But at the same time, this person feels different? We've had deep conversations about everything from career struggles to family drama, and they've been there for me through some rough patches. Still, I keep hearing my mom's voice in my head warning me about internet safety from when I was a teenager.

They live about 3 hours away and suggested we meet halfway in a city neither of us knows super well, which seemed fair. My initial thought was to meet at a busy coffee shop during the day, somewhere with lots of people around. I'm also thinking about sharing my location with my best friend and maybe having a check-in system where I text them every hour or something. Is that overkill? Part of me feels like I'm being paranoid since we've literally been on video calls dozens of times and I know what they look like, where they work, their last name, everything.

I've been reading about online dating safety tips and first meeting protocols, but most of that advice seems geared toward dating apps where you've only exchanged a few messages. This feels different since we've built up what feels like a genuine friendship over months of daily conversation. We play online games together with mutual friends who can vouch for them being a real person and not some catfish situation. But I also know that someone can seem totally normal online and be completely different in person.

What are some precautions I should take that won't make me seem like I don't trust them? I don't want to offend them by being overly cautious, but I also value my safety. Should I suggest we both bring a friend for the first meeting? Would it be weird to ask them to send me a picture of their ID beforehand? I'm also debating whether to drive myself or take public transportation - driving gives me an easy escape route but then they'd potentially see my license plate.

I'm probably overthinking this whole thing, but I'd rather be safe than sorry. For those of you who've successfully met online friends or dates in person, what safety measures did you take? What worked well and what was unnecessary? Any red flags I should watch out for during our first in-person meeting? I really want this to go well because I genuinely like this person, but I also want to make sure I'm protecting myself appropriately.",2,1757489415.0,ASKpi,1,1.0,False

What does well in Shawlands is the cafe. Always has. I don't know if anyone would agree with me but I think the Millwood could be a great French Style Cafe.

By that I mean that it does a LOT of different things/functions. It could sell coffee and cakes, sure, but it could also still sell alcohol. Just like in Paris. 

It could open early enough to sell baguettes and papers, vapes, cigarettes and mars bars. It could offer the corner site cafe experience, sandwiches, soft drinks and coffee outside and in for teachers and parents etc. without the label of ""pub"" coming into it. 

It could open late, transitioning more into a pub vibe. 

Basically just take a cafe from Paris and drop it in place in Shawlands. I think it would be a hit combining cafe with pub and extra features, like a tabac. It would need canopies outside and wait staff in white aprons. Think it would work?

If not, then what? Will it just like derelict like No87, Poundland, the old Chinese place and misty of the arcade, Wetherspoons and Tusk??

[Generative Engine Optimization](https://softcloudtec.com/) (GEO) is a new approach to digital marketing that focuses on optimizing content for **AI-driven search engines** and large language models (LLMs), such as Google's AI Overviews, Microsoft Copilot, and others. Unlike traditional SEO, which primarily aims to rank websites high on a list of search results, GEO's goal is to ensure your content is selected, cited, and effectively summarized within AI-generated responses.

This is a fundamental shift from a ""click economy"" to a ""visibility economy."" In the past, success was measured by clicks to your website. With GEO, success is measured by your brand's presence and authority within the AI-generated answers themselves, even if the user doesn't click through to your site.

# GEO vs. Traditional SEO: Key Differences

While GEO and traditional SEO share the goal of increasing online visibility, their methods and focus areas differ significantly.

The core of any GEO strategy is high-quality, authoritative content. AI models are trained on vast datasets and prioritize information that is clear, accurate, and trustworthy.

* **Answer Questions Directly:** Start your articles or sections with a concise, direct answer to a user's question before providing more detailed information. This ""inverted pyramid"" style helps AI quickly extract the key facts it needs.
* **Embrace Structured Formatting:** Use clear headings (H2, H3), bullet points, and numbered lists. This makes your content easy for both humans and AI to scan and understand.
* **Build Authority and Credibility:** Support all claims with concrete, factual data. Cite credible sources, link to original research, and include case studies or expert quotes. The more evidence you provide, the more likely an AI will trust and cite your content.

**2. Optimize for Conversational and Semantic Queries**

Generative AI understands natural language. This means you need to shift from a focus on exact keywords to targeting a broader range of semantic queries.

* **Focus on Search Intent:** Instead of just targeting a single keyword like ""best coffee,"" create content that addresses the user's underlying intent, such as ""how to brew the best coffee at home"" or ""what is the best way to make espresso.""
* **Target Long-Tail and Conversational Keywords:** Use tools to identify the specific questions people are asking. Phrases like ""how do I..."" or ""what is the difference between..."" are prime targets for AI-generated answers.

**3. Leverage Technical SEO and Structured Data**

Technical SEO is still crucial for GEO. It ensures that AI crawlers can easily access, understand, and use your content.

* **Use Schema Markup:** Structured data, like schema markup, provides a roadmap for AI models, telling them exactly what your content is about. Use specific schema types such as HowTo, FAQPage, or Article to help AI understand the context of your page.
* **Ensure Crawlability and Site Health:** Maintain a fast, mobile-friendly website with a logical URL structure and no crawl errors. A healthy website is a fundamental requirement for both traditional and generative engine optimization.

**4. Build a Robust Brand Presence**

AI models consider brand reputation and authority when selecting sources. A strong brand presence across the web can increase your chances of being cited.

* **Maintain Brand Consistency:** Ensure your brand's name, messaging, and key information are consistent across your website, social media, and other online platforms.
* **Secure Brand Mentions:** Actively work to get your brand mentioned on high-authority, relevant websites and in influential communities like Reddit or forums. AI models often use these sources to inform their responses.

# The Future is a Hybrid Strategy

The rise of GEO doesn't mean the death of traditional SEO. Rather, it signifies an evolution. The most successful digital marketing strategies will be a **hybrid of both**. By focusing on creating authoritative, contextually rich, and machine-readable content, you can position your brand to win in both the traditional search results and the new, AI-driven landscape. While traditional SEO will still drive direct traffic, GEO ensures your brand maintains visibility and authority in a world where users are getting their answers faster than ever.

# What's Next for Generative Engine Optimization?

The world of digital marketing is never static, and Generative Engine Optimization is at the forefront of its next evolution. As AI models become more sophisticated, so too will the strategies for optimizing for them. Here are some of the key trends and predictions shaping the future of GEO.

**1. The Rise of Multimodal Optimization**

Today's generative engines are no longer just about text. They can understand, synthesize, and present information across multiple formats, including images, videos, and audio. This is powered by advanced technologies like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and multimodal embeddings, which allow AI to pull from various sources and formats to create a comprehensive answer.

* **Actionable Strategy:** Don't just focus on written content. Create high-quality, relevant images and videos. Ensure you use proper schema markup, such as ImageObject and VideoObject, to make your media assets easily discoverable by AI models. Add transcripts to your videos and podcasts to capture those natural language, voice-search queries.

**2. Entity-Based Optimization**

AI models are moving beyond simple keywords to understand entities—the real-world people, places, and things that your content discusses. They identify the relationships between these entities and use this knowledge to provide more nuanced, contextual answers.

* **Actionable Strategy:** Build content around a central entity. For example, instead of just a blog post on ""sustainable fashion,"" create content that links to specific brands, materials, and designers (entities) to show the AI a deeper level of expertise. Use structured data to highlight these entities and their relationships.

**3. Real-Time and Community-Driven Content**

While traditional SEO relies heavily on evergreen content, GEO places a higher value on real-time and user-generated content (UGC). AI models are increasingly citing community forums like Reddit and social media platforms to provide authentic, up-to-the-minute information.

* **Actionable Strategy:** Actively engage in online communities and forums related to your niche. Position your brand as a helpful, knowledgeable participant in these discussions. The goal is to get your brand or content mentioned in these spaces, as AI often uses them as a source of trusted, un-biased information.

**4. The Evolving Role of Technical SEO**

As AI crawlers become more prevalent, the importance of a clean, healthy website remains paramount. However, the focus of technical SEO is shifting. It's no longer just about making your site easy for a traditional search bot to read; it's about making it easy for an AI to parse, understand, and trust.

* **Actionable Strategy:** Regularly audit your website for technical issues that could impede AI crawlers. Ensure your robots.txt file doesn't accidentally block AI bots you want to attract. Pay attention to site speed, mobile experience, and logical site architecture, as these factors contribute to the overall trust and authority signals an AI model evaluates.

**5. From Traffic to Authority**

The ultimate goal of GEO is to become a ""trusted answer."" The new measure of success is not just website traffic, but rather how frequently your brand is cited as a source of information within AI-generated responses. This marks a fundamental shift from a traffic-based economy to an authority-based one.

* **Actionable Strategy:** Focus on creating high-quality, in-depth content that addresses the core questions of your audience. Promote your content to authoritative sources and publications to earn those valuable brand mentions and citations.

# Conclusion: A New Era of Digital Strategy

Generative Engine Optimization is not a fleeting trend; it is the natural evolution of digital marketing in an AI-powered world. While traditional SEO will continue to be important for driving direct traffic, GEO is the key to ensuring your brand remains visible, relevant, and authoritative in the future of search. By embracing a hybrid strategy that combines the best of both worlds, you can position your brand to not only survive but thrive in this new era of digital discoverability. The future of search is here, and it’s time to optimize for it.

1nd7m72,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1nd7m72/he_took_me_engagement_ring_shopping_twice_and/,"He took me engagement ring shopping twice, and then ended things three months after we moved in together. Was I love bombed?","We met on Bumble and fell in love fast and hard. We were basically inseparable after our first date. He was everything I dreamed of in a partner and best of all - he was intentional and sure about me too.

Hindsight looking back, there were certainly things that could have and maybe *should* have been red flags. He introduced me to his entire family in our second month of dating, for example, but the reasoning made sense: they live far away, and it was probably the only time I'd be able to meet them before his sisters wedding the following year. Or the fact he said I love you within one month. Or when he asked in month two if I'd want to move in with him the next year when his lease was up (he asked in December, the move happened in May) and I said yes.

He took me to get my ring size and then two separate times after that we went to look at engagement rings and try them on; he even tried on some wedding bands himself. In the moment though, with how right it all felt, it just made sense. It happens, right? Sometimes you just know when you've met the one. I knew it on our first date and months later when we talked about it, he said he knew it too.

I opened up to him about my past and my traumatic experience with being hurt by past partners - something I kind of had to explain because he did something truly innocent that triggered a panic attack in me. He held me and hugged me and said he understood, and reassured me about how safe I was with him.

We had some small arguments leading up to our move, but nothing crazy or extreme. We always communicated extremely well, I felt he was very emotionally intelligent, and we seemed to move past these issues with ease. Prior to signing the lease in April, I asked him again just to be sure, if he was sure he wanted to. He confidently and enthusiastically said yes, so we moved forward.

I had lived with my ex before him and although I ended it, uprooting my life and dividing everything up and moving out of our apartment was extremely difficult. I imagine it's somewhat what going through a divorce feels like and it was just terrible. He knew all of this in detail and he knew I was scared to do it again but willing to make the jump because of how good things were with us. I begged him to be honest because I never wanted to be put in the position of doing that again.

Almost immediately after the move, it was like he became a different person. The same guy who used to send me virtual gift cards for coffee on rough days, got me surprise flowers all the time, who literally used to run ahead of me to open my car door or would drop down in a millisecond to tie my shoe, who would constantly throughout the day text me little updates and cute memes and videos, who included me in everything as much as possible, suddenly didn't talk to me at all throughout the day and started making plans to hang out with friends alone. Which, don't get me wrong, I'm all for having time alone with friends - but he went from hardly ever doing that and pretty much always extending me an invite to join even if he knew I'd say no, to multiple times in a week going to meet up with a friend after work and coming home at like 8 or 9pm.

We ended up getting into two big fights, which I felt became way bigger than they needed to be, and he almost broke up with me both times. However, we fully made up and agreed to move forward.

So when we were out one day having a nice day together, literally laughing, kissing, saying I love you one hour and the next he was coldly and unemotionally breaking up with me in the middle of a restaurant - something in me truly broke. I've experienced bad breakups, I've been in love before, but nothing compares to this. We only lived together for three months!

The same man who wouldn't even jokingly say I was dumb, called me the c word and said he hated me a day after the breakup. Then a couple days after that, said I was the love of his life, one of the best people he's ever known, and his best friend. He even tried to ask me to remain friends.

He claims we argued too much and were incompatible. But then when I try to be as objective and honest with myself as possible, I still fully believe he was the one who sort of started the very issues he was apparently breaking up with me over. I also find it...extremely difficult to buy the ""we're incompatible"" excuse. We both actively don't want kids, I was fully willing to move around the country and world with him for his job every 2-3 years, we constantly had fun together, we had fantastic sex, similar views on politics, wanted similar lifestyles, agreed on how to spend money, he loves his motorcycle and I was happy to go on rides with him, every major thing you can think of that would be important was 100% aligned and so were so many smaller things.

I just don't know where to go from here. I've spent the last month ruminating and reading about difficult breakups and attachment styles and have come to the conclusion he fits the description for dismissive avoidant, but that doesn't take away the pain from how blindsided I feel. I fully believed he was my person and we were going to get married. I desperately want him to reach out but I haven't heard from him in over two weeks, close to three, and we've been no contact since then.

Tl;dr I feel like he stole the last bit of me that had hope there was someone out there for me. I can't (and don't want to) risk ever getting myself hurt like this again, it's just about the most devastating thing I've been through. I will admit too that while I don't feel the pressure that some people do to be married or settled down by a certain age, I'm 29 and so pretty much every close friend of mine is in a serious relationship. Being the only single friend is hard.",5,1757488878.0,Advice,13,0.73,False

That was, at least, until this morning. I had slept with my window cracked open because of the humid, british, autumnal weather now I have done this many a time with extreme success. I should also mention that I have insomnia, sleep is difficult for me and therefore precious.

 After a long day/evening I had turned in for the night, hoping to finally get some hours of sleep, the temperature was optimal, I was cozy, I drifted off thinking about my weekly plans...and then...

Pain. Needle-y, acidic pain. But, ladies and gentlemen, I was still asleep! My tired brain was refusing to allow itself to awake fully for fear I won't be able to fall back asleep. I rolled over, the pain eases slightly however I end up tossing and turning, my subconscious racked as to what this mysterious phantom pain was. I roll back again, that was it. Another sharp stab. I sit up, my brain groggily fighting against itself to crack open my eyes and smell the coffee and there I see it, my biggest fear, attached to my arm, writhing and stabbing and exacting its malicious fury upon my unsuspecting arm meat. I go ape. Tearing the unholy beast from my arm before slamming windows shut, contemplating torching my room and searching every inch with a flashlight to make sure no more are waiting to exact vengeance for their evil brethren. The worst part? I sleep almost fully balled up under my covers (partially to avoid this) which means my would-be assassin had purposely Indiana Jones-ed its way through a crack betwixt bed sheet and mattress, supposedly crawling and dodging my snores, until it got to its promised land.

All of this to say, this experience has just further proven my hatred and overall fear for this waste of species. My being asleep and hidden away under a relatively thick duvet aid dispelled any lingering doubts of 'if you don't antagonise it won't harm' and 'its more scared of you than you are of it'.

1nd7duo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsOneAfterInfidelity/comments/1nd7duo/idk_what_to_make_of_it/,Idk what to make of it.,"I need to vent

WW had a 6 month EA/PA with a coworker. WW and I have been in recovery for 12 months. I went through hysterical bonding, survival mode. Finally felt safe enough to start grieving. I mean sobbing every night for months. Sometimes for 2 minutes, other times sobbing for over 30 minutes. Then came this numbing plateau. As I was warned; I felt intense anger and depression all over again, but no more tears. The last several weeks I've extremely sensitive; as in taking everything as an attack. Any off handed comment I would take it the wrong way and pick fights. I would misread the situation or anything my WW would say to me. I've been incredibly critical. My WW has made this massive change for the better about 3 months ago. Sitting with me in my pain. Listening to my hurt. Encouraging me to vocalize my paranoia or intrusive thoughts. Coming to me and asking me what's bothering me, whenever I seemed off. I took all of this for granted. 

Sorry, to my point. I am very threatened by her male coworkers. Bare in mind, my WW had her affair with a coworker. She even found a new job that pays less and isn't nearly as impressive or big as her old company. All this to try recovery with me. When she started this job, a male coworker invited her to one on one coffee meetings during work, one day when she was upset at work he offered  an ear to lend if she ever wanted to vent. A tree fell in our backyard and he offered to come over and help dispose of it. She said thanks for the offer but no thanks. I flew off the handle when I read those text messages. I texted the guy from my phone. (This guy is married btw) I told him: This is her husband. We don't need any of his offers. It's unprofessional to be asking for so much ""one-on-one"" time with a female coworker. My wife is blocking his cell phone number and to only contact her through teams and to keep everything work related. He responded back shortly apologizing for any offense and thanks for telling him where our boundaries are. My WW expressed she never got the impression of being hit-on and he's a very professional coworker and talks about his family a lot. I thought they were becoming way too buddy-buddy. She didn't give any push back to anything I said. 

2 months go by and my wife has a work trip to a town an hour away and will be home around the same time she usually is any other day of the week. It was my day off and I have a couple friends in this town. So I offered to drive her there and back. She thinks it's a great idea but wants to carpool back to the office with her coworkers. I asked with who and she gave me the name of a female coworker and a male coworker. I was crestfallen that she didn't want to drive back with me because roadtrips have always been our thing and we never get time without the kid. She insisted she had a lot of work to do and carpooling back with coworkers would save her a lot of time the next day. Of course a fight comes from this and I tell her I'm suspicious of her intentions and I think she is hiding something. Hours later she apologizes and tells me if I need to drive her there and back, to feel safe in our marriage then I can drive her. She also apologized for insisting so hard on carpooling. The morning I drive her to that town, there's still a lot of tension in the car and she begins to cry and tells me she afraid I'm going to divorce her over this and she's so angry she put work before me again, like she would in the past. I'm taken back a bit and think it's not that big of a deal. The day goes well and she make up that night. 

Now here we are present day and I'm overly sensitive to everything that comes my way. I'm depressed most days and picking small fights here and there. I go through her phone yesterday. I don't find anything. Except a work email... the day she wanted to carpool with coworkers. One of the coworkers she was going to carpool with was that guy I texted and to stay away from my wife. She lied about who she was going to be with that day. Also his number is unblocked but waaaaaaay down on the message list. No new text messages exchanges. Although she could easily delete any messages exchanged. I flip out and confront her. She says she lied to avoid a fight with me and for me to worry about nothing. She says she doesn't remember ever unblocking his number and has no idea why it's unblocked. She immediately goes into this shut down shame spiral that I haven't seen in 3 months. She makes a sarcastic remark that now she has to quit her job again. I tell her, ""No, you lied. I'm divorcing you. You swore to me you would never lie to me again"" ( I was trickeled truthed. I had 3 Ddays) she goes compete shut down. Only speaking to degrade herself. She hasn't left our bed since our fight 2 days ago, only to go to work, which she came home early from today. Right now I'm sitting in a bar her and her AP went to on a date. What the hell am I doing? I've been sober for almost 2 years. What the hell is wrong with me? Why did I take this fight so far? I hate myself.

1nd7ajg,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1nd7ajg/clicked_with_a_coworker_but_im_worried_about/,"Clicked with a coworker, but I’m worried about crossing a line—what should I do?","This is my first time posting on reddit, I need advice. I (28 m) am a substitute custodian at a high school in California. I'm going to try and give as many details as I can about this situation because I don't want to lose my job. I met one of the teachers at the school I work at for the first time today, we will call her Anna. She normally leaves the school at 2pm and I start working at 2:30pm so we have never met before. I'm on contract from the district to work at this school until the end of October at the least. Anna surprised me when I opened up the door to her classroom. I'm very used to that room being empty. She also surprised me by having a very bright disposition, she asked me questions and started a conversation with me almost immediately. We talked for about fifteen minutes about teaching and how I want to be a teacher. She and I share a passion for learning and she even said that if she could she would be a life long scholar which is something I talk about very often. The problem here is that in this conversation I asked her if she would want to get coffee some time, she responded positively but didn't offer her phone number and I didn't ask because I had to get back to work. I haven't clicked with someone like that in a long time and I'm not sure if I'll get a chance to see her again with how our schedules work. During our conversation she recommended I read, The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha, and I plan on doing so. I don't know if there was a spark for her or if it was just me misreading her kindness and I don't want to risk my job but I do like Anna from the brief conversation we had, she's very pretty and seems very smart. I also don't know how old she is or if she is single or not, I'm fairly certain she is not married but she could still be in a relationship. I am currently six years single and haven't even thought about dating until today. Even if she doesn't want to date it would be really nice to have someone to talk to about literature as I am a very avid reader and all my friends think reading is a waste of time. My current plan is to start reading Don Quixote and when I finish it I will leave a note on her desk thanking her for the recommendation and leaving some sort of question hoping for a response, if she doesn't respond after that I will leave well enough alone but if she does then I can bring up getting coffee again and write my number down for her. I do not know Anna at all, I'm going off a vibe and a good conversation and I don't want to be creepy or risk my job but I also don't like the idea of regretting at least trying to talk to her somehow. I don't care too much about dating but if that is a possibility down the line then it'll happen naturally. I really just want to see if we do click as well as I thought we did but if it poses a risk to my job then I won't pursue it. I don't know what to do, I need to get hired on so I can have benefits and take care of my son better and that is my number one priority. If reddit has any advice at all I am one hundred percent open. I’m going to add a few details here for context. I look a bit younger than I am (people mistake me for being 19-22) so she might have thought I was too young for her. I am worried that if I do up front tell her I am attracted to her and I want to go out then she could end up reporting me for sexual harassment and I could be completely black listed from this job which could kill all the networking I have done over the last nine months so I want to step lightly and with a lot of consideration for how I might misconstrue our conversation, she answered yes very quickly and seemingly excitedly when I asked her out to coffee but part of me thinks she didn't give her number on purpose, it might just be me overthinking which I tend to do. One more detail about our conversation, I complimented the paintings in Anna's classroom, they are amazing, and she said she was really nervous about putting her paintings up but since I liked them she would start putting up more which made me feel like there had to be some mutual attraction and that is why I asked her out. Please help with any advice you can think of.

So there I was, in line, heart racing, as if it were a major life decision and not just, y'know, ordering coffee.

The barista, bless her, was totally patient as I stumbled over the name of this... watever it was. I think it had almond milk and a hint of lavender in it. Honestly, I wasn't even sure if I'd like it. I mean, who knew floers and cfofee could mix? 

After all that, when I finally got the drink, I realized something. The taste was actually kinda nice—mayve not as safe or comforting as my usual, but it made me feel like I was on some tiny flavor adventure right tuere in my smakl corner café. 

I guess what I'm wondering is, how does everyone else handle that fear of dithcing the usual for simething new? Does anyone else feel like stepping out of that liftle comfort bubble can be both terirfying and oddly satisfying at the same time? 🤷‍♀️",10,1757487291.0,ComfortZoneChronicles,0,1.0,False

**Mount Aetna**

**Hephaestus' Workshop**

**Long Ago**

In the middle of the day, Hephaestus sat at a metal desk, busily typing away on a hard-light keyboard with his left hand, his eyes scanning the hard-light screen in front of him. In his right hand, he was twirling a hammer as the image slowly came into focus. Behind him, in the center of the workshop, on an old, torn-up couch, was Baldr. He looked the same as he did in his future battle with Samson: short and blonde with black eyes and yellow irises. His hair buzzed at the sides, with the remaining hair held in a pristine top-knot that matched the careful care of his trimmed, thick moustache. His upper body was bare, but he wore a pair of thick brown shin-high boots and blue pants held up by a brown belt. Hephaestus turned in his swiveling stool to him as the image finished loading, revealing a gray, mechanical arm.

""Is this what you asked for?"" Hephaestus asked. Baldr rose and walked over to the monitor. He glanced at it and nodded.

""Perfect, but the color may need work,"" Baldr answered.

""Color? The hell does color have to do with it?""

""That arm is depressing as hell. No one would wear that.""

""Nuada wears one in that same shade!""

""Nuada also dresses up in armor and only shows the hand. This will be front and center all the time, so it needs to look amazing.""

Hephaestus blinked at him. ""…You're serious?""

Baldr nodded. ""'Course I'm serious. Make it gold. I think gold suits him.""

Hephaestus shook his head as he typed away on the screen. He tapped one last button, and the gray slowly turned into a glossed gold. Baldr nodded and grew a smug grin under his moustache.

""Lord, that's gaudy as hell.""

""But it's perfect.""

""Sure…"" Hephaestus turned back around. ""Alright, payment.""

Baldr pulled out his tablet and tapped on it a few times. A notification popped up on Hephaestus' monitor. ""There, as promised. Dwarven runic smithing techniques, along with my research notes. Heard the stubborn bastards kept it from you despite the goodwill you offered.""

""They're probably upset about my changes to your gauntlets."" Hephaestus opened the notification and made a light snort. ""Nice…""

""Yeah, they can right fuck off for all I care."" Baldr pulled out a small silver tube and wiggled it in his hand. ""Those modifications you made make it possible to carry them around without issue.""

""You're welcome, by the way.""

""I thanked you then, Ass. I'm not ungrateful.""

Hephaestus smirked. ""And make sure you stay that way."" Hephaestus straightened up on his stool. ""Who's the arm for?""

""Týr.""

""We got medical equipment up here that regrows limbs. Why the hell does he want a prosthetic? Why's *he* not askin'?""

""Personal reasons, and would you ask the dad of your crush's best friend to make you an arm? It'd look like he's trying to suck up to you and Pan.""

""Uh-huh. That's what it is."" He turned back to face Baldr. ""You know, I could decline this if you're not shootin' straight with me. I'm doin' you a favor since you got me that info, but this arm you're askin' for is a custom project—""

""Don't play that with me. All your shit's custom. It's your slogan.""

""Damn right, it is. My point is, Týr's goin' to the bottom of the list of six hundred customers if you don't tell me why I should put it above guys like Susano'o or Huitzilopochtli.""

Baldr sighed. ""Not even the data gets him to the top?""

""Top two hundred at best.""

""Ass...,"" Baldr whispered. ""Fine, I convinced him."" Hephaestus leaned back and wore a bewildered expression. ""Look, Týr was in bad shape after the last battle with the Jotnar. Lots of pissing and moaning about not being up to snuff with Thor and me.""

""Or Vidarr.""

""Fuck Vidarr. He and the rest of our crapshoot family are half the damn reason Týr's so hard on himself. The other's Brünhilde.""

""Puppy love.""

""Don't start that. Anyways, I…may have recommended wearing the prosthetic instead of regrowing his arm as a way to…take ownership of his screw-up instead of hiding it. That way, no one else can use it against him."" Hephaestus eyed him. ""What?""

""Sentimental shit,"" Hephaestus smiled. ""You like to act tough and rugged, but you're still the soft-hearted, pretty boy you've always been!""

""Oy, bite me!""

""Mr. Hot-body Heaven here! 'Course, back then you had long hair and didn't wear that god-awful moustache.""

""It took four years to grow this, and it is *exquisite.*""

""Pan's still pissed at you for beating her in that beauty contest as kids!""

""…I only got pulled into that, because Hilde thought I looked like a girl! Lord, she had a dress picked out…"" Hephaestus burst out laughing, dropping his hammer. It clanged on the floor as he slapped his desk. He started tearing up a little. ""Stop laughing,"" Baldr said barely above a whisper.

The laughter slowly died, and Hephaestus wiped a tear out of his left eye. ""Ah…sorry, bud. Sore spot for you, still?""

""How'd you like being called the pretty one when your older brothers are the strongest Norse Warriors? Fuck, not even getting Svalinn's Shield changed anything. Not even cutting my hair or growing this *exquisite* moustache changed anything."" Baldr pointed both index fingers at his face

""Better than bein' an ugly cripple."" Baldr's eyes widened, meeting Hephaestus'.

""The hell, man? I'm not here trying to one-up you in misery.""

""I'm not, either, genius. However, those shits don't hold a candle to us. Laugh and jeer all they want; they couldn't do what you did saving Týr, or outdo me here.""

""I know that, but still—""

""Hey, whose opinion matters? Theirs or Týr's?""

Baldr looked off to the side for a moment, then looked to the ground. ""That dumbass'.""

""There ya go. A pretty boy can be a warrior, and an ugly cripple a genius."" Hephaestus rose. ""Now I'm goin' to get started on this. I should have it ready with the stuff you gave me in a day or so.""

""Really?""

""If…what you gave ain't shit.""

Baldr shook his head, smiling. ""Bite me, ya old shit."" Baldr turned around and walked to the workshop's entrance. He pulled open the door and passed through, closing it behind him. Hephaestus turned back to the monitor, eyeing the arm as the Tiwaz Rune appeared on the top-right of the screen.

""Worrywart. Now…how do I want to do this?""

***Story Two: Wedding Gift***

***Valhalla***

***Esagila***

Far from Mount Aetna and a few millennia later, at the floating tower Esagila, a great hurdle had arisen within the household of Marduk and Sarpanitu. Despite the illustrious, yet simple, stone tower from which one could see all of the Heavens being the object of envy for many Gods across many Pantheons, for one God, it became a near-unbearable Hell.

High up in the tower's upper floors, in a large open room lined with massive open windows and no furniture, stood that aged, suffering God. His long black hair was disheveled and sticking out at odd ends, his white robes hung haphazardly off his body, barely held on by a blue sash. His olive skin looked like it barely held his body together as his bloodshot eyes squinted at the other, older, white-haired God in blue robes who stood across from him.

""Marduk,"" Metatron said. ""I am guessing your anniversary night was…fun?""

""Ugh…"" Marduk groaned. ""Maybe? I can barely remember it….Hold on…"" He rubbed his temples and closed his eyes. ""I think I saw Nergal and a few of the guys in a drinking contest with one of the servants.""

""And you joined them.""

""Maybe, I don't know.""

""No, I am saying you did. I saw you run over there after your dances with Sarpa and join them. Got to say, not a great way to celebrate a wedding anniversary by losing to one of the help in a drinking contest.""

""That…yeah…"" Marduk sighed. ""How pissed was Sarpa?""  
""I do not know."" Metatron looked out to the horizon somberly.

""Oh no…""

""She ran right after you and joined you. She outlasted all of you, except the servant.""

Marduk blinked his bloodshot eyes a few times. ""Wait, wha?""

""You seem to forget water deities have an absurd tolerance for alcohol. She was finishing up a run as I arrived.""

Marduk grumbled.

""For what it is worth, you definitely lucked out with her."" Metatron smiled. ""She meshes well with you.""

""Can't deny I'm a lucky guy, though there'd be two if you'd talk some of the ladies giving you the eyes last night.""

""I am a widow. Only one woman had ever had my heart, and she is all I will ever need."" He heard footsteps echoing from the staircase to his right. ""Many are not so lucky. Cherish her,"" He whispered.

Marduk nodded as a barefoot Sarpanitu ran into the room. Her silver hair was done in a braid, and she wore a sleeveless gray shirt and blue, cuffed pants. Her blue eyes darted from Metatron to Marduk and back. ""Am I late?"" She asked.

""Nope. We were just shooting the breeze for a moment."" Metatron turned to face the couple. ""Now that you are both here, it is time…"" Metatron's smile widened as an excited look grew across his face. ""For your wedding present!""

The couple exchanged glances, with one slightly suffering more than the other, and looked back at Metatron. ""Uh…okay? Where is it?"" Sarpa asked. ""Is it more words of wisdom? Cause you gave us *a lot* of those back when we got married.""

""Snark: a lesser's attempt at humor. You are better than that, Sarpa."" Sarpa shot him a quick, listless leer, but Metatron looked unfazed. ""Moving on, I started talking with Buddha recently, and he showed me a technique that amazed me: Samavadhāna, or Common Destiny. It is a technique for allies to share their power. I thought to myself, 'Who would love such a technique?' And I thought of you two.""

""Uh…okay?"" Marduk said. ""But why now, and why a wedding present? Kind of late for that.""

""Yes,"" Metatron cleared his throat. ""In my alone time, I have done a great deal of thinking, and I did you two a disservice."" Metatron rubbed his hands together. ""When Tiamat and Apsu attacked your homeland eons ago, I said some rather harsh words to you in the hopes you would see that Ea needed you back here rather than picking fights with Zeus. I failed to see that you were stuck between your desires to aid your father and your responsibility as an heir to keep the Pantheon alive, should anything happen, and I mistook that you were acting like a stupid, spoiled brat.""

""Kind of harsh, but I didn't do myself any favors. I should have fought harder to tell my dad he needed me back then. No harm done!"" Marduk said, trying his hardest to smile despite the sun's rays starting to shine into the room and his eyes. ""Blasted sun…"" He murmured.

""Fair, but I carry some of that, too. Especially,"" He looked over to Sarpanitu. ""since it wasn't just the two of you anymore."" Metatron clasped his hands together as he exchanged a soft glance with her. ""So I wish to make that up to you by helping you two learn a technique that will prove that your love is not only a genuine blessing, but a power that none can rival…and make up for the fact that I forgot to get you two a real wedding present. May I?""

The couple locked eyes, and Marduk reached out his hand. Sarpanitu took it in hers. ""We will be able to fight together?"" Marduk asked

""And be all the stronger for it.""

""My Moon and Stars."" Sarpanitu blushed at the name. ""I want to keep my promise to you, and I think this may be the best way possible."" He turned to face her and took her other hand in his. ""Will you? With me? Again…and for the first time?""

She smiled softly. ""If I didn't, you'd still get into fights, my Sun.""

""Yeah!"" He smiled, his gaze softening despite the sun's rays. ""But with you I'd win them.""

She sighed. ""Then let's do it."" The two let go of each other and turned back to Metatron. ""So, how does this work, exactly?""

***Story Three: Preparation***

**Einherjar Barracks**

**Leo's Workshop**

**Six Months Before Ragnarök**

Deep within the Barracks for Humanity's soon-to-be champions, a small cadre found themselves within a vast, well-lit hangar. Its walls were lined with various massive machines of different shapes and sizes, and at the foot of the one closest to the hangar's elevator was a large assortment of gym equipment ranging from free weights, weight machines, benches, cable machines, and treadmills.

Standing with this large assortment of equipment to his back was Leonardo Da Vinci in black sweat pants, yellow tennis shoes, and a yellow hoodie, his red hair tied back in a ponytail. Across from him stood Ghulam Butt, Li Shuwen, Teddy Roosevelt, Yi Sun-sin, Johannes Lichtenauer, Arash, and Samson. All of them wore the same outfit as Leo.

""Greetings, Gentlemen!"" Leo said, trying to sound confident. ""Thank you all for accepting my offer to meet today—""

""Why did you say we needed to wear these outfits?"" Yi asked.

""Huh?""

""You sent these to us, saying we needed to wear these before we arrived. I had to convince Li and Johannes to wear them.""

""…Team-building?""

""Works for me!"" Teddy said, flexing his muscles under the hoodie. Yi sighed despondently.

""What's the point of this?"" Li asked, squinting at Leo. Leo could see him fidgeting slightly in the outfit.

""Ah! Fair. I wanted all of us to have a chance to meet before any of us were selected.""

""*If* we're selected,"" Lichtenauer added. He looked over at Li and smirked slightly. *Worth wearing this to make you squirm a bit!* He thought.

""…Yes, if. So, allow me to start things off! I'm Leonardo Da Vinci, Italian Polymath.""

Arash waved his hand up. ""Hi! Arash Kamangir: Soldier in Shah Manuchehr's Army and defender of Persia.""

""This is ridiculous,"" Li whispered.

Ghulam snorted and flexed his muscles. ""I am Ghulam Mohammad Baksh Butt. Kushti of Punjabi, India. I am more known as the Great Gama!"" He flexed his muscles, stretching the fabric. Tadakatsu whistled. Ghulam looked over at Li and Johannes, staring blankly at them without blinking. The silence in the air dragged on until Johannes sighed.

""Fine…I am Johannes Lichtenauer. I am a Fencing Master from Lichtenau, Germany, and the creator of the Zettels, which *none* of you will get unless you earn them.""

""Wow…a swordsman,"" Samson said, twirling his right index finger in the air. ""Impressive…""

""And you?"" Johannes leered at him.

""Samson. Judge of Israel,"" He answered, wearing a smug grin.

""Ah, that explains the attitude,"" Johannes remarked.

""The hell you say—"" Tadakatsu cut in between them.

""Honda Tadakatsu."" He poked his left bicep with his right thumb."" Daimyo of the Ōtaki Domain and Vassal to Tokugawa Ieyasu. Oh! And from Japan.""

All of them turned to Li, who met their gazes. He closed his eyes and shook his head. ""I am Li Shuwen of Cangzhou, of the Heibei Province in China. Bajiquan master, and unless there's a point to this besides introductions, I am leaving.""

""Please wait, Li-Sifu,"" Leo said. Li raised an eyebrow, but Leo could not tell if he had just insulted or respected him. ""I called you guys here because I need help."" He pulled up his hoodie and white undershirt, revealing his flat stomach. ""I…am not ready for Ragnarök. I know nothing's set in stone, but I know we are among the candidates. I signed up because I want to protect Humanity and give it a chance the Gods don't give a damn about. But I admit I don't know the first thing about fighting, or physical training, or weapons. So I called you all here to teach and train me…if you're willing.""

Li exhaled and turned around. ""I decline. I can't teach you anything within such a short span of time."" He started walking towards the elevator. ""The others are better-suited for this.""

""Same,"" Johannes added. ""A sword in your hand is more of a danger to you than a God. However, I do applaud your resolve. Gents, I have a feeling,"" He looked at the other four, ""he's in good hands."" Johannes turned and started walking to catch up to Li.

Leo looked at the others, doubt showing on his face. ""…What do you say?""

""You're serious, huh?"" Samson said, stepping up to him. He looked down at Leo, standing over forty centimeters taller than him. Samson nodded. ""That's what I'm talking about.""

""Forget those two old dogs,"" Ghulam added. A quick burst of aura from near the elevator shot out. ""Think one of them heard me,"" He said, smirking.

""I don't think I can teach you how to use a bow, but I think I can show you routines and such I used to build my strength!"" Arash added.

""I'd appreciate that,"" Leo said, smiling.

""No, you won't after you do this for a while!"" Arash grew a snide grin.

Tadakatsu walked over to Leo and rested his massive hand on his massive hand on his shoulder. ""We're a team now, and we're going to help you with whatever you need. However, I do think we deserve *some* compensation.""

""Don't worry. I'm already on that,"" Leo said. He pulled out a tablet and tapped on the screen, bringing up a file. ""In this file is a list of schematics I've been working on for each of us. Brünhilde has a plan to get us weapons, but if you guys are willing to work with me, I think we can brainstorm some ideas to make your weapons much more powerful."" The elevator groaned to life in the distance.

""As long as the bow doesn't break, I'm game,"" Arash added.

""Fantastic! So what should we do first?""

""Oh, none of that,"" Ghulam added.

""Huh?""

""We're going outside. Can't work in here. It's too…stifling.""

""Couldn't agree more,"" Samson added.

""Huh?"" Leo repeated.

""Alright, where should we go?"" Tadakatsu asked.

""Got a place I train not too far from here,"" Ghulam added. He looked over at Leo. ""Anyone got an issue with me overseeing all this?""

""Huh?"" Leo repeated, color now fading from his face. They all shook their heads, and Ghulam grew a wild, nasty grin and look in his eye. ""Oh, no.""

Up in the rafters, far from the polymath and his newly regretted choices, Hohenheim looked down at the group of muscular juggernauts leading their newest friend to the recently returned elevator. He pursed his lips, trying not to laugh. To his right, in his purple suit, sky-blue shirt, and brown derby, was Saint Germain, carefully eyeing the group.

""I think Leo's going to regret his choice,"" Hohenheim said. ""Don't you?""

""At the start, probably, but he'll get used to it,"" Saint Germain answered without looking away from them.

Hohenheim looked over at him. ""That's a look I've seen a lot.""

""Hmmm?""

""Nostalgia. Does it remind you of something?""

Saint Germain blinked a few times. ""Better days. Knew a rowdy bunch like them,"" Saint Germain said, smiling. ""It's a nice surprise.""

Hohenheim smiled. ""Good! You need to be a bit more positive. Why not join—""

""Oh, that's not happening.""

Hohenheim shrugged his shoulders. ""Alright, but don't say I didn't recommend anything."" He stepped back a few steps. ""Want to get some coffee? Could kill for a cup right now.""

Saint Germain looked over at him. ""That sounds like a plan. My treat."" The two started walking to the entrance and departed the workshop.

***Story Four: Sit Down***

**Einherjar Barracks**

**Hohenheim's Lab**

**Two Weeks after Leo's Regret**

A few weeks later, back in the massive laboratory lined with tall shelves full of glass instruments and an assortment of chemicals, Hohenheim and Brünhilde were busy at work. Hohenheim was reading the contents of a vanilla folder while leaning against one of his cleared-off tables. Two large piles of vanilla folders sat behind him on the table, while Brünhilde was busy typing away at a monitor to his right.

""Hilde, how long have you spent researching these people?"" Hohenheim asked, looking in the folder. ""Some of these guys and gals are…interesting.""

""A few years now,"" Brünhilde answered. ""Some of them I've had in the back of my mind for a while, but the more digging I did, the more I found.""

""Hmmm…Dandara dos Palmares…Revolutionary and Capoeirista."" His eyes darted around for a moment. ""Randgriz? Hlökk? Alvitr?""

""That's what I was thinking too, but there's competition for those three, and I have to take into consideration who the Gods may choose.""

""Hmm. I see."" He put the folder on top of one pile, then grabbed the top one from the other and opened it. ""Julie d'Aubigny La Maupin? Her?""

""I need a strong sword master. It's between her, Okita Souji, and Johannes Lichtenauer. If Oya gets picked, she's going.""

""I don't know who that is, but I trust your judgment."" He closed the folder and placed it on the other pile. He sighed and nodded his head. ""Hilde, why am I here?""

Brünhilde looked up at Hohenheim and stood. ""Doctor, I need your help. These two piles are all the possible candidates I collected to build our Roster, and I need you to look through them and help me pick the ones you think would be best.""

""Hilde, you flatter me, but I am woefully underequipped and unqualified for this.""

""You say that, but there's something you possess that makes you perfect for it.""

""How easy I am to buy off with coffee?"" A slight clink occurred behind Hohenheim. He turned and saw Mist holding a tray and placing a steaming cup on the table a meter away from the folders. She smiled and walked over to Brünhilde. Hohenheim grew a defeated smile. ""Mist, you're exceptional but not helping!""

""I try,"" She answered as she placed another cup next to Brünhilde before she took her own off the tray and sipped it.

""And so you succeed,"" Hohenheim said, grabbing his cup.

""Not that, but it does help. It's more about your ability to read people. Your focus on studying alchemy and medicine gives you a perspective on people that few can match. I need you to use that skill to interview each of these fighters and determine their viability how they would mesh with my sisters.""

""I feel kind of like a matchmaker. You sure Freud or Jung wouldn't be better suited? I'm an alchemist, not a psychiatrist or psychoanalyst.""

""No one reads people with the level of grace and kindness you do."" Brünhilde took a sip. She immediately spat it out. ""What is this?!""

""Kaffegök,"" Mist answered before draining her cup.

""Yes, it's gross, but what's called?!""

""Kaffegök,"" Hohenheim answered. ""It's a Swedish drink made with coffee and schnapps."" Hohenheim sniffed it, then drained the cup. He smacked his lips before he shook like a bolt of lightning shot up his body. ""Oh…that's strong! Thank you, Mist!""

""Not to your liking, Hilde?"" Mist asked. ""I thought it would be perfect since you like Salmiak Pies.""

""Now that sounds like a treat!"" Hohenheim said.

""Ugh…not right now,"" Brünhilde said.

""Hilde."" Brunhilde looked at Hohenheim. ""You're asking me to pick people whom we intend to send to die. To fight with your sisters at their sides. There are at least one hundred sixty options here. You're asking a lot of me, and I don't know if I quite agree with you about my qualifications.""

""I trust you,"" She answered, smiling.

""I know you do, but if you want me to do this, I need something from you.""

""What?""

""After I do my comb, I want you to go through these with your sisters. They deserve a say in who they pair up with, and may die with."" He glanced over at Mist. ""You're a family and a team. This is where you get to show what it means when the Gods underestimate the Valkyries.""

Brünhilde smiled softly. ""What makes you think I wouldn't do that?""

""Your Habits."" He smiled. ""Plus, I wanted to say it. I'm in your corner, Hilde.""

She nodded. ""Then I'll leave you to it. Looking forward to it!"" She walked past the two, headed towards the lab's entry, and departed.

""She's still trying too hard,"" Mist said.

""It comes with being the oldest. I've seen it a lot.""

""Will she be okay?"" Mist looked back at the entrance. ""I know I can worry myself into a mess, but it's Hilde. She's a lot like our dad: carrying things alone because she feels like a failure if she can't.""

""That's a dangerous mindset, and poisons the soul in one of the worst ways possible with love. Self-destructive love."" Hohenheim turned to the piles. ""Guess I should start.""

""I'll get more Kaffegök and help you.""

""A Saint as always, Mist."" Mist blushed a little at the compliment.

""Let's see…"" He grabbed the next folder. ""Michel Nostra—nope. Nope. Hell, no."" He snapped the folder shut and placed it on the other pile. ""My God, Hilde. Him? Who's next, Vlad the Impaler?"" He grabbed the next folder and opened it. ""…Well, I set myself up for that one…""

***Story Five: Sorority***

**Valhalla**

**Eastern Chapel**

**Four Months Before Ragnarök**

""Rommie, do you think they'll come?"" Skalmöld asked, standing outside the chapel, Romulus by her side. Brünhilde stood a few meters in front of them with her back to them, staring out into the open field.

""I'd like to think so, but you never know. It's a wild plan, and I'd think you'd be pulling my leg if anyone suggested it besides Hilde,"" Romulus whispered. ""Declaring Ragnarök? A rational person would think it's just delaying the inevitable.""

""When have we been rational?"" Skalmöld asked, smiling coyly.

""Can't argue with you there."" They looked out in the same direction Brünhilde did, and caught sight of nearly a dozen figures in the distant sky. ""I think that's them."" He kissed Skalmöld on the crown of her head. ""I'll be inside with Georgios if you need me.""

""Why would I—wait, Geir's coming. Along with Hlökk and Alvitr…yeah, please be ready.""

""Deal."" He turned around and walked into the chapel as the figures flew closer.

Skalmöld walked up and stopped next to Brünhilde. ""Hilde, how sure are you about this?"" They could start making the figures out: a near dozen Pegasi. On a few of their backs rode a group of familiar maidens.

""Doesn't matter if I am. We need to do this,"" Brünhilde answered. ""For Humanity."" Skalmöld looked at her sister's face and saw the cold, sharp gaze.

""For Sieg, Pan, and Epi, too.""

""…You can't tell the others about that, Möld. Please.""

""I'm not going to. This is your plan. You can tell them when you're ready.""

""Thank you…""

""Does Göll know at least?"" Brünhilde turned to her.

""Göll?""

""You're going to ask her to fight, too, right?""

""I didn't invite her. Not to this.""

Skalmöld flinched. ""Wait, why?!""

""This conversation is about her, too."" The Pegasi started landing in the field. ""We'll talk later.""

*What the hell, Hilde?* Skalmöld thought.

Brünhilde and Skalmöld walked over to the group as they got down from their mounts. Hrist, Thrud, Randgriz, Geirölul, Reginleif, Mist, Göndul, Hlökk, Alvitr, and Radgridr grouped up and marched towards their sisters.

""What's going on, Hilde?"" Geirölul asked.

""Yeah, it's been a while since you got us all together,"" Alvitr added.

""Everyone, I know it's short notice, but we need to talk as a group, and this subject needs to be in-person,"" Brünhilde said.

""Is it about Göll? Randgriz asked. ""Is it time?""

""Is it about Skeggöld?"" Göndul asked. ""We've been coming up short on our ends.""

""No, not yet. Something else has become a priority,"" Brünhilde answered. ""The other day at Asgard, I saw Set.""

""That asshole? What'd he want?"" Geirölul asked.

""He was collecting the votes for the Extermination Council and wanted to inform Odin…that the results will be unanimous in favor of Humanity's destruction.""

Dread enveloped the group. Speech escaped them as they exchanged glances, save for Radgridr, who raised her hand. ""So…Humanity will be eradicated? Completely?""

""Yes.""

""But…what about the souls already here? They already died…so they're safe at least, right?""

""What're you getting at, Raddy?!"" Alvitr shouted.

Radgridr flinched. ""I was just trying to look at the positives…""

""Alvitr,"" Randgriz said, staring softly at her younger sister. Alvitr looked away and shirked.

""Sorry…""

""Thank you."" Randgriz turned to Brünhilde. ""So does that include the souls here now?""

Brünhilde nodded. ""Every last trace of Humanity will be destroyed. The living and the dead. I don't think it will include all the Gods that were once Human, but the fact they lost their vote on the Council doesn't bode well.""

""Shit…"" Hrist whispered.

""This isn't right,"" Thrud said, towering over all her sisters. ""There's no way we can just sit around and let this happen.""

Reginleif stepped up to Brünhilde. ""What can we do? The seal Dad put on our powers means we're too weak to fight back,"" She said. ""Worse, Gabriel's at the mercy of the Council as the acting 'Chief God.'

""A useless title no different than a damn leash,"" Geirölul added.

Hlökk stepped a little forward. ""But we can't sit around and do nothing. Hilde, do you have an idea?""

Brünhilde nodded. ""I do, but it's risky, and it may not work."" She said. She pulled out her tablet, tapped on the screen, and held it out, screen up. A small projection shot out and floated above the tablet.

**RAGNARÖK**

All the Valkyries stared at Brünhilde. ""You're…insane, Hilde,"" Hrist said. ""There's no way we can pull this off. The Gods are too damn strong, and there's no way any Human would sign up for this!""

""That's where you're wrong, Hrist."" Hilde tapped the screen. Ragnarök vanished, and in its place…

""These Humans are willing to fight and die.""

Mist looked at the list and frowned. *You did add him, Hilde...*

""Holy cow…wait, Rommie?"" Hlökk asked. She kept looking. ""Georgios?! But they—""

""They know the risk,"" Skalmöld said. ""Rommie is willing to side with us over his family, and Georgios is our brother in all but blood.""

""This is all fine and dandy,"" Hrist said, her ruder side showing. ""But how can they hurt Gods? We don't have access to Divine Weapons.""

""We do,"" Brünhilde answered. ""Through Völund.""

Silence hung over them for a moment as the word floated around them. ""Hilde, you're insane…""

""I know, but this is the only way we can save them. The only way we can give Humanity a fighting chance.""

""Hilde,"" Thrud said. ""But we don't know Völund. Dad never showed us.""

""And if we do it,"" Mist spoke. ""We die with them.""

""You're right, Mist. Thrud, I found someone who could show me. The same one who taught Dad. I'll show you all how, but I need to know.""

""Know what?"" Randgriz asked.

""If you will all stand with me on this. I…can't go in alone. I'm asking something of you all that may be too mu—""

""Eat dung, Hilde,"" Geirölul said. ""I'm in."" She raised her middle finger. ""Fuck those shithead Gods. The Primordials tried pulling this shit back then, and they think they're any better?! Fuck them!""

""I'm with Geir,"" Thrud said. ""If we can do something, let's do it.""

""Anyone want to say no? I won't hold it against you,"" Brünhilde asked.

They all exchanged glances. Some confident, others fearful, some confused. They all looked back at Hilde. ""One family. One team. One Fight, Hilde,"" Hrist said.

Brünhilde felt something pull at her heart. She felt a weight both lift and fall on her shoulders. She nodded and smirked. ""Excellent. Now, we need to figure a few things out here. Each of us will be paired with someone on this list—""

""I am paired with Rommie,"" Skalmöld said. All of them looked at her and her odd defiance. ""Got it?""

""…Yeah?"" Alvitr said.

""Because he's my husband.""

""…We know,"" Hlökk added.

""And is a catch.""

""Möld, no one wants to pair up with him. You two are the best fit for each other,"" Randgriz said. Skalmöld huffed and crossed her arms while she nodded. *Why is she acting like this?*

At first, he was just a coworker. A quiet man with steady eyes, his presence felt both sharp and safe. When he offered her a ride home one evening, she hesitated—men had only ever taken from her—but his tone was simple, almost casual:

“It’s late. Let me take you.”

That night, the ride was short. But the wind on her face, the hum of the engine, and the strange comfort of sitting behind him—it was freedom she hadn’t felt in years.

And so it began.

Every morning, he was there, waiting. Every evening, she looked forward to the sound of his motorcycle pulling up, like the day itself wasn’t complete until they shared that ride. Under the sun, under sudden downpours, they rode together. She laughed when the rain soaked them through and teased him for grumbling, “Now I’ve got soldier’s boots full of water.” They would pull over for street food—fish balls dipped in sauce, isaw shared between them, and cold Coke in a plastic bag with straws. Those moments, small and ordinary to others, felt like stolen pieces of joy for her.

She cared for him the only way she knew how. Bringing him coffee when he looked worn out. Asking about his headaches, making sure he ate, staying up just to listen when he talked about the weight of his soldiering days. She gave him her time, her patience, her softness—all the parts of herself she once thought were long gone.

And in return, he gave her something even rarer.

He made her feel important.

He listened. He teased her. He let her laugh loudly, unashamed. And for the first time in her life, she thought: Maybe I am worth loving.

But comfort is a double-edged sword.

She grew too comfortable, too trusting. She thought she could simply talk—share stories, ramble, fill the air with her words—because wasn’t that what people who cared for each other did?

Until one day, the silence fell.

She noticed it in the way his jaw tightened when she spoke, the way his replies turned clipped, distant. At first, she thought he was tired. But when she finally asked, softly, “Did I say something wrong?” his answer cut her like glass.

“You should already know how I feel.”

Her chest tightened. She searched her memory for clues, for mistakes. Before she could ask again, he dropped words that shattered her:

“You’re a red flag. You’re not accountable for your actions.”

The girl who once thought she was finally safe, finally seen, was suddenly nothing more than a warning sign to him.

The rides stopped. The space where his motorcycle used to wait for her after work was empty. She felt the loss like a physical ache.

One evening, trembling, she asked him, “Are you still mad?”

He looked at her, his voice steady but cold.

“You cannot tell someone how they should or should not feel.”

That was it.
No softness. No forgiveness. No acknowledgment of the laughter, the rain, the street food, the Coke they shared like teenagers.

And so, she walked away.

Not in a storm of anger—but in the quiet surrender of someone who had finally had enough. She resigned from her job, not for him, but for herself. For her peace. Because she couldn’t lose herself again in the chaos of someone else’s moods, someone else’s gaslighting.

The night before she left, she stood at the same street where they once stopped for fish balls. She ordered a stick, dipped it in sauce, and tried to laugh the way she used to. But the taste was different now. Empty.

She cried on the ride home—not because she missed him, but because she missed the girl she was when she was with him. The girl who laughed in the rain. The girl who believed she mattered.

And yet, in those tears, a truth settled in her heart.

She had given him her care, her softness, her time. She had shown him the kind of love that survives even after being broken. He couldn’t see it, or maybe he didn’t know what to do with it—but that didn’t make it less real.

Her worth wasn’t his to decide.
It was hers.
And this time, she was choosing herself.

She walked away with nothing but memories—the sound of rain against a helmet, the sweetness of Coke in a plastic bag, the echo of laughter that once felt like freedom.

And though her heart broke, she carried those pieces into the silence, knowing she would heal.

Because even a tear-stained woman can rise again.
Even broken hearts can learn to beat for themselves.",1,1757486444.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

I’m 27M on the southside and honestly I’ve always found it pretty tough to make new friends. I tend to take a while to properly warm up to people, and back in high school I never really felt like I fit in. I was kind of hanging with the wrong group the whole time.

These days, I’ve leaned more into the things I actually enjoy and feel like myself with. I’m more of a nerdy/goofy type who loves wildlife (herping is always fun), fishing, anime, gaming, tattoos and I also keep myself active with the gym.

I’ve realised I feel a lot more at ease around people with similar vibes especially women with a nerdy/fun side who don’t mind being a bit silly or geeking out over random things especially tattoos. I’d really love to make some genuine friendships where it’s not just surface level, but actually feels like we can hang out, laugh, and share interests.

If any of this resonates, feel free to drop a comment or DM me I’d be keen to grab a coffee, check out a market, go on a little wildlife outing, or even just chill and watch some anime.

Thanks for reading, and if you’ve been in the same boat of struggling to find your “people,” I’d love to hear from you too.",1,1757486411.0,BrisbaneSocial,1,1.0,False

Expert Tips from Dentists in Pune,"Bad breath, medically known as **halitosis**, is a common concern that affects people of all ages. While it can be temporary—like after consuming garlic or onions—persistent bad breath often signals underlying oral or health issues. Understanding the causes, prevention strategies, and treatments can help you regain confidence and improve oral health. In this article, we explore the root causes of bad breath and share expert insights from top dentists in Pune.

# Understanding the Causes of Bad Breath

Bad breath doesn’t just come from poor oral hygiene—it’s a multifactorial issue. Below are the most common reasons why it occurs:

# 1. Poor Oral Hygiene

When brushing and flossing are neglected, food particles remain between the teeth. Bacteria feed on these particles, releasing foul-smelling sulfur compounds.

# 2. Plaque and Tartar Build-Up

If plaque isn’t removed regularly, it hardens into tartar, creating a breeding ground for bacteria that cause bad breath and gum disease.

# 3. Dry Mouth (Xerostomia)

Saliva helps cleanse the mouth and wash away debris. A dry mouth reduces this natural cleansing, allowing odor-causing bacteria to thrive. Common causes include dehydration, smoking, alcohol, or certain medications.

# 4. Dietary Habits

Foods like garlic, onions, coffee, and alcohol leave lingering odors. Diets high in sugar can also promote bacterial growth, increasing bad breath risk.

# 5. Smoking and Tobacco Use

Tobacco dries out the mouth, stains teeth, and contributes to gum disease—all factors that exacerbate bad breath.

# 6. Gum Disease (Periodontitis)

Persistent halitosis is often linked to gum disease. The buildup of bacteria in deep gum pockets produces chronic bad breath.

# 7. Medical Conditions

Certain systemic conditions like diabetes, sinus infections, GERD, or liver/kidney disease may manifest as bad breath. This is why chronic halitosis should never be ignored.

# Expert-Backed Tips to Prevent and Manage Bad Breath

Dentists emphasize that the key to fresh breath is consistency in oral care and lifestyle choices. Here’s what experts recommend:

# 1. Maintain Daily Oral Hygiene

* Brush twice daily with a fluoride toothpaste.
* Floss to remove food particles and plaque between teeth.
* Clean your tongue with a scraper to remove odor-causing bacteria.

# 2. Stay Hydrated

* Drink plenty of water to prevent dry mouth.
* Chew sugar-free gum to stimulate saliva production.

# 3. Routine Dental Checkups

* Visit a [Dentist in Pune](https://g.co/kgs/ARvpQrU) every six months for cleaning and preventive care.
* Professional scaling removes tartar and helps control gum disease.

# 4. Balanced Diet Choices

* Reduce consumption of sugary and processed foods.
* Include crunchy fruits and vegetables that naturally clean teeth.
* Limit alcohol and caffeine, which can dry the mouth.

# 5. Avoid Tobacco Products

Quitting smoking improves oral health, freshens breath, and reduces gum disease risk.

# 6. Address Underlying Health Issues

If bad breath persists despite good oral hygiene, consult your dentist or physician to rule out systemic causes.

# Why Professional Dental Care Matters

While home remedies like mouthwash or mints provide temporary relief, only professional care addresses the root cause. Regular checkups allow early detection of gum disease, cavities, and oral infections—all of which contribute to halitosis.

# Benefits of Professional Care:

* Comprehensive oral examination
* Deep cleaning and plaque removal
* Treatment for gum infections
* Personalized hygiene guidance

**hdfidelity presents**

### *The Expeditions & Misadventures of Mouse Capone*

**Halloween Special: ""White Hunger""**

The Andes stretched endless and jagged, like the broken teeth of the world. Their jagged crowns rose black against stormlight, while a Douglas DC-6 rattled its way through the passes like a fly in a bottle.

Inside the cabin, the crew wore the faces of the tired and the unwilling. Rudy had taken the controls, tail coiled around the yoke as her claws twitched against the dials. Faraday, strapped into the engineer’s chair, muttered about “magnetic anomalies” and “storm interference,” the words tumbling as nervously as his hands. Minx sharpened her claws against the seat armrest, each scrape a warning of the nerves underneath. Professor Featherstone sipped tea, unflinching, as though no disaster in human—or avian—history had ever been worth missing a sip.

And Mouse Capone? He chewed a cigar he couldn’t light in a cabin that might soon be his coffin.

“I told you,” he growled, smoke-less and bitter. “South American contracts are cursed.”

The mountain answered with a wall of wind and a spear of lightning. The plane screamed as metal met air it was never meant to touch. The ground rushed up like the end of a sentence.

Impact.

---

They woke scattered in the wreckage. The world had become white noise—snow falling, wind wailing, the silence of things broken. The Douglas lay half-buried on a ridge, its fuselage cracked open like a ribcage.

The crew dragged themselves inside, huddled in the torn belly of the plane. Breath fogged the air. Coats and blankets patched the holes. A poker deck was burned for warmth.

Days passed. Rations shrank. Coffee grounds were boiled into black water; a stale loaf of bread was passed like a relic. Minx whispered ghost stories to keep their eyes from the dark. Blue Puppy whimpered at the walls, ears low, nose twitching at something they wouldn’t name.

And Mouse sat silent, watching the horizon.

---

On the fifth day, the talk began.

“We could build an ice condenser,” Faraday stammered, sketching circuits in the frost.
“Could chase alpaca,” Rudy said, her voice low, eyes already measuring the white distance.
“Could eat Professor,” Minx joked, and was met with a growl from Blue Puppy that cut the humor short.

The Professor had been staring into the rear cargo hold, where Syndicate agents lay frozen, dart scars still visible on their necks. He spoke softly, as though reciting a catechism:

“Survival accounts are clear. In the Andes, the cold takes the body, but the living... the living must decide how much of their soul they’ll feed to the snow.”

Nobody spoke. Nobody breathed. The truth had landed.

Mouse lit his cigar at last, flame flickering blue in the dark. He exhaled, and the smoke carried his words like a verdict:

“If it comes to carving, I’ll be the one holding the knife. Nobody else carries that weight.”

---

The storm that night rattled the fuselage. Shadows flickered. Hunger broke through hesitation.

It wasn’t described, not in detail. Just glimpses: Minx’s trembling hand, Rudy’s wrench snapping bone mistaken for timber. The fire’s hiss when fat spat into the flames. Faraday turning away, retching into his sleeve. Blue Puppy whimpering but staying close, as though warmth mattered more than innocence.

The Professor bowed his head in prayer, but the words never carried.

Mouse said nothing, chewing ash, eyes black.

---

The storm broke with morning. Clear skies rang with the drone of engines: search planes, hunting the wreckage.

The crew stumbled into daylight, gaunt-eyed and hollow, but alive. They were hauled into helicopters, wrapped in blankets, carried down from the ridge like ghosts given flesh again.

Weeks later, in Philadelphia, the questions came. Reporters swarmed the safehouse, microphones flashing.

“How did you survive?”
“What kept you alive in the mountains?”
“What did you *eat*?”

Mouse tipped his hat, cigar dangling from his lips, gaze hidden beneath the brim.

“Trade secret,” he said.

And the flashbulbs went off, never knowing what the crew carried in their eyes.

It's gotten bad. But it's weird; I've always been a \*little\* stopped up, in my adult life, and cereal/fruit/coffee in the morning would allow me to do my 'business' and then i was fine until the next morning.

Now, however, i will do 'business' in the morning (need more to get it going, kiwis/coffee/etc), but then, more 'business' will be knocking at my door. It's like I'm filled with SO MUCH POOP, all the time. The second or third poops (if they come out) are not as 'formed' as the first. Almost like they're not 'ready' to come out, like they were digested more quickly, but come out they must. Where does it come from? And then I'll do more, and after a few hours/bathroom visits, I can leave the hours. Or, i still have stuff in me and feel bloated and pained the rest of the day.

I'm just confused regarding the amount of poop in me, and the need to do several 'businesses' a day (if possible)--otherwise I'm miserable. Is there a form of constipation/IBS that has both EXTRA POOP and DIFFICULTY 'GOING'? Do i need extra testing? Do i have fast motility, now, but constipation at the same time? Argh!

I had a guided shore fishing day booked, but my guide had to cancel short notice due to medical reasons.

So I did what had to be done and ventured out on my own, equipped with a PE4 setup and a hand full of jiggs and poppers, and my phone for maps and most importantly translation. My Arabic is getting better now..

I was told it’s not possible, what is this you have there (fishing rods), you must book a boat fishing tour… I actually considered booking a boat session, but for me the real challenge is the land based game. Fishing from a boat in the Red Sea seemed like halfway to the fish market. 🤷‍♂️

I had to negotiate with armed guards to walk along the shoreline, who said the police will come and arrest me and take my gear.

Eventually I came across a very humble and friendly family of Bedouins who were hand-lining on the reef. I was invited for coffee, tea and cigarettes and with the help of modern technology we were able to converse. There was an instant connection between us “men who catch fish” and they gave me permission to join them on the reef.

So finally I hooked up and landed fish I could have only dreamed of, shared the keepers with my new friends and gathered unforgettable memories! I will be forever grateful for this experience.

1nd6so4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CelebrityWealthTalk/comments/1nd6so4/who_really_is_brittany_mahomes_more_than_just/,Who Really Is Brittany Mahomes? More Than Just Patrick Mahomes’ Wife,"Whenever you watch a Kansas City Chiefs game, chances are you’ll catch a glimpse of Brittany Mahomes in the stands. Some know her as “Patrick Mahomes’ wife,” but if that’s all you know, you’re missing a pretty fascinating story. Brittany has carved out her own career in fitness, sports, and entrepreneurship, and honestly, her biography deserves more attention.

So let’s break it down — from her roots in Texas, to her soccer career, to her life as a businesswoman, mom, and co-owner of a pro women’s soccer team.

# Early Life in Whitehouse, Texas

Brittany Mahomes (formerly Brittany Matthews) was born on August 31, 1995, in Whitehouse, Texas. It’s one of those small towns where high school football and soccer are basically the heartbeat of the community.

Growing up, Brittany was always athletic. At Whitehouse High School, she wasn’t just “the quarterback’s girlfriend” — she was a serious athlete in her own right. She played soccer competitively, balancing schoolwork, practice, and the all-too-familiar Texas Friday Night Lights culture.

Those small-town roots shaped her resilience. Brittany wasn’t chasing fame back then; she was chasing goals — literally.

# Kicking Off a Soccer Career

A lot of people don’t realize that Brittany Mahomes actually played professional soccer overseas. After starring as a forward at the University of Texas at Tyler, she signed with UMF Afturelding/Fram in Iceland in 2017.

Think about it: she was only 22, moving across the world to pursue her dream. That takes guts. Her professional soccer stint wasn’t super long, but it gave her something many NFL wives don’t have — an athletic résumé of her own.

If you’re curious about her playing days, here’s a full [Brittany Mahomes career timeline](https://thegraval.com/brittany-mahomes-career-timeline/) that includes her transition from college soccer to going pro.

# From Athlete to Entrepreneur

When Brittany returned from Iceland, she shifted gears. Instead of continuing with soccer, she tapped into her passion for fitness. That’s when she launched **Brittany Lynne Fitness**, an online platform with workout guides and training programs.

Her content is approachable — not the intimidating “celebrity trainer” vibe, but more like, “Here’s how you can get strong at home with real-life routines.” That’s one reason she quickly built a loyal community.

Later, Brittany and Patrick made an even bolder move: they became co-owners of the **Kansas City Current**, a National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) team. That’s not just a vanity investment — it’s a statement. She went from being a player to being an owner, which is a huge deal for women’s sports.

If you’re interested in the numbers side, here’s a breakdown of [Brittany Mahomes’ net worth](https://thegraval.com/brittany-mahomes-net-worth/), which as of 2025 is estimated around $15 million.

# Family Life with Patrick Mahomes

Of course, you can’t talk about Brittany without mentioning her relationship with Patrick Mahomes. They’re high school sweethearts who met at Whitehouse High.

Patrick proposed in 2020 at Arrowhead Stadium — the same night he got his Super Bowl ring. Talk about a Hollywood moment. Since then, they’ve had two kids: Sterling Skye (born 2021) and Patrick “Bronze” Mahomes III (born 2022).

Today, Brittany balances the whole NFL-glam lifestyle with being a hands-on mom. One minute she’s rocking designer gear in a luxury suite, the next she’s posting Instagram stories of toddler chaos at home.

If you want the full scoop, there’s a pretty detailed [biography of Brittany Mahomes](https://thegraval.com/brittany-mahomes-biography/) that covers her age, career, family, and more.

# Style, Lifestyle, and Public Perception

Brittany Mahomes’ style has evolved a ton over the years. From soccer jerseys and cleats in college to Louis Vuitton coats and custom game-day jackets today, she’s become a legitimate fashion influencer. Vogue even ran a feature noting how she blends sporty authenticity with high fashion.

But being in the spotlight comes with criticism too. Remember the champagne celebration in 2022, when she sprayed bubbly over fans after a Chiefs playoff win? Some people thought it was “tone deaf,” while others defended it as harmless fun. Like most things online, the reaction was divided.

Still, within Chiefs Kingdom, Brittany is generally seen as passionate and fiercely supportive of her family. And beyond the noise, she stays focused on fitness, her business ventures, and philanthropy through the **15 and the Mahomies Foundation**.

# Why Brittany Mahomes Stands Out

When people compare NFL wives and girlfriends, names like Gisele Bündchen (Tom Brady’s ex) and Ciara (Russell Wilson’s wife) usually come up. Both built their own empires. Brittany is on a different path — one rooted in athletics and business ownership.

She’s not just “next to” Patrick Mahomes; she’s building something of her own. In that sense, her impact might one day be remembered more for what she did in women’s sports than what she wore to Chiefs games.

If you want a quick rundown of her milestones, here’s a list of [Brittany Mahomes’ achievements](https://thegraval.com/brittany-mahomes-lifestyle/), from soccer highlights to business moves.

# Fun Facts You Might Not Know

* She’s a proud dog mom to Steel and Silver.
* She’s a die-hard Starbucks iced coffee fan.
* She admits to being hooked on reality TV marathons.
* Game-day superstitions? Yep, she’s got those too.

When it comes to health, dental care is often neglected until pain or discomfort becomes unbearable. But waiting too long can lead to complications that could have been avoided with timely intervention. If you’ve ever found yourself searching for a [Dentist near me](https://g.co/kgs/nAcnFkV), chances are your oral health already needs professional attention. In this article, we’ll explore the most critical signs that signal an urgent dental visit, backed by expert insights and scientific evidence.

# Why Ignoring Dental Issues Can Be Risky

Your mouth is not isolated from the rest of your body. Studies show that poor oral health is linked to systemic conditions like heart disease, diabetes, and even respiratory infections. A simple cavity left untreated can escalate into infection, leading to root canal treatments or even tooth loss. Regular dental check-ups with a trusted Dentist in Pune ensure early detection and treatment before issues spiral out of control.

# 1. Persistent Tooth Pain

Toothaches are the body’s natural alarm system. Pain that doesn’t subside could indicate:

* Deep cavities reaching the nerve
* Gum disease
* Abscess or infection

According to research published in the *Journal of Dental Research*, untreated tooth decay is one of the leading causes of severe dental pain worldwide. Don’t mask the pain with temporary remedies—consult a professional immediately.

# 2. Bleeding or Swollen Gums

Healthy gums don’t bleed when you brush or floss. If yours do, it might be an early sign of gingivitis or advanced periodontal disease. Left unchecked, gum infections can damage the bone structure holding your teeth in place.

Dentists often stress that gum health is as important as tooth health. A timely visit to a [Dentist in PCMC](https://g.co/kgs/nAcnFkV) can prevent minor gum irritation from escalating into a full-blown infection requiring surgery.

# 3. Persistent Bad Breath or Unpleasant Taste

Halitosis (chronic bad breath) is more than a social inconvenience—it can be a red flag for serious oral conditions. Bacteria buildup, cavities, or gum disease are common culprits. Sometimes, bad breath can even point to underlying systemic issues like gastrointestinal disorders.

If regular brushing, flossing, and mouthwash don’t help, it’s time to schedule a dental checkup.

# 4. Tooth Sensitivity to Hot or Cold

Do you feel a sharp sting when sipping hot coffee or eating ice cream? Tooth sensitivity often indicates:

* Enamel erosion
* Gum recession
* Cracked teeth

Sensitivity left untreated can progress into nerve damage, leading to more invasive treatments later. A skilled [Dentist in Pune](https://g.co/kgs/nAcnFkV) can provide solutions like fluoride treatments, bonding, or protective sealants.

# 5. Loose or Shifting Teeth

Adults shouldn’t experience wobbly teeth. If you notice gaps widening or teeth shifting, it could signal bone loss due to gum disease. According to the American Academy of Periodontology, advanced gum disease is the leading cause of tooth loss in adults.

Immediate dental intervention can stabilize the condition and preserve your natural teeth.

# 6. Mouth Sores That Don’t Heal

Occasional mouth ulcers or sores are normal, but if they persist for more than two weeks, it’s time for a professional evaluation. Persistent lesions may indicate infections, fungal growth, or in rare cases, oral cancer.

Dentists recommend never ignoring recurring sores, especially if accompanied by pain or bleeding.

# 7. Jaw Pain or Clicking Sounds

Discomfort in your jaw while chewing, or clicking and popping sounds, may point to temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJ). Other causes could include teeth grinding (bruxism), misalignment, or arthritis.

Early diagnosis ensures preventive treatments like night guards or physical therapy, preventing worsening conditions.

# 8. Dry Mouth and Excessive Thirst

A lack of saliva can cause discomfort and raise the risk of cavities and gum disease. Dry mouth may be linked to medication side effects, dehydration, or systemic diseases like diabetes.

A dentist can recommend solutions ranging from saliva substitutes to adjusting your dental care routine.

# 9. Cracked, Chipped, or Broken Teeth

Dental trauma doesn’t just affect appearance—it can compromise functionality and increase the risk of infection. Even small chips should be examined promptly. Treatments range from bonding and veneers to crowns or implants, depending on severity.

# 10. Regular Check-Ups Are Essential

Even if you’re symptom-free, the American Dental Association recommends visiting a dentist at least twice a year. Preventive check-ups help in identifying hidden issues through X-rays, professional cleanings, and thorough examinations.

What you do between now and then determines whether you'll feel confident or chaotic.

Right now, you're probably feeling that familiar itch - maybe you should drill a few more DI questions? Perhaps review those time & distance formulas one more time?

**Your brain is telling you that more preparation equals better performance. Here's the truth: your brain is lying to you.**

Take a deep breath.

*These next 24 hours will impact your test performance more than you realize - but not in the way you think.* The right decisions on test eve can elevate your score, while the wrong ones can undermine months of preparation.

Here's what most test-takers get wrong: your top priority right now isn't GMAT preparation. Learning new things at this point could actually hurt your performance.

What you need is a proven plan to walk into that test centre tomorrow at your mental and physical peak.

# The Performance Mindset Shift

Think of this day as your launch pad. Just as an athlete doesn't run a marathon the day before a race, your approach to T-1 should energize, not exhaust you for test day.

Why don't athletes run marathons before race day? Because they'll be exhausted and burnt out.

What DO they do instead? Everything that allows them to be at their best tomorrow - proper nutrition, light movement, mental preparation, and rest.

**Your score is set; what matters now is ensuring you can access everything you've learned.**

Your preparation ended yesterday. Today is about reset and readiness.

# Your Day-Before Morning Protocol

The first half of your day sets the foundation for tomorrow's performance. Think of this as your warm-up routine - enough activity to stay connected with your preparation while maintaining the mental freshness you'll need.

https://preview.redd.it/901zy8gq5aof1.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=78ef939936bfedd17c1687dcb7e0d5b678c60854

**Light Review Only**

Start with light review that feels more like maintenance than learning. Pick one area you're strongest in and spend 20-30 minutes doing familiar practice problems.

This isn't about discovering gaps or pushing boundaries. You're simply keeping your problem-solving muscles warm. Choose problems you know you can solve confidently - this builds positive momentum rather than anxiety.

**Review your Game Plan**

Take a few minutes to remind yourself of your successful approaches and timing strategy. What worked in your best practice tests? What's your sectional game plan?

Spend time visualizing success. Picture yourself walking into the test centre calm and executing your strategies naturally.

**Routine Maintenance**

Wake up at your normal time. Don't change your sleep schedule today - your body needs consistency.

If light exercise is part of your routine, stick with it. A short walk or gentle stretching is fine. Avoid anything new or strenuous.

**Handle Logistics Early**

Verify your exact test centre location and check parking options. Time your journey accounting for traffic patterns at your test time.

Print your admission ticket and double-check your ID requirements. Handle these details now so tomorrow morning runs smoothly.

**Nutrition Basics**

Plan for your regular breakfast - nothing new or experimental. Stay hydrated throughout the day.

If coffee or tea is part of your normal routine, maintain that. Consistency is key.

**Manage Your Energy**

Think of yourself as an athlete preparing for competition. You want to maintain alertness without burning through your mental resources. Light physical activity like a walk can help manage nervous energy while keeping you grounded.

# The Strategic Wind-Down

As you move into the second half of your day, your focus shifts from light preparation to active relaxation. Think of this as gradually dimming the lights - each activity should bring you closer to a calm, confident state for tomorrow.

https://preview.redd.it/pl4vxofs5aof1.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f2eda87746f30653986352dae6a10b1ca1340f1

**Positive Visualization**

Review your best mock test performances. What made those sessions successful? Remind yourself of the strategies and mindset that worked.

Visualize your test centre journey from start to finish. Picture yourself walking in calm, reading questions clearly, and applying your proven approaches naturally.

Do a mental strategy walkthrough - simply reminding yourself of your game plan and timing approach.

**Prepare Your Environment**

Create the optimal environment for rest. Prepare everything you'll need for tomorrow morning so you can move efficiently without stress.

Lay out your clothes, pack any allowed snacks, and organize your documents. This preparation ritual helps signal to your brain that you're ready and in control.

**Relaxation Protocol**

Step away from all test content completely. No more GMAT material, forums, or strategy videos.

Engage in light, relaxing activities that you know help you unwind. Choose familiar activities that calm your mind without overstimulation.

Consider a brief, supportive chat with someone who encourages you - but keep the conversation away from GMAT topics.

**Evening Routine**

Your evening should prioritize activities that help you relax naturally. Avoid anything stimulating or unpredictable. Choose familiar, calming activities that you know help you unwind.

Plan for a light dinner by 7:30 PM. Avoid heavy or unfamiliar foods that might disrupt your sleep.

Follow your regular bedtime routine to signal to your body that it's time to wind down.

Aim for a 10 PM bedtime to ensure you get adequate rest without oversleeping tomorrow.

# T-1 Troubleshooting Guide

Even with the best planning, unexpected situations can arise. Here's how to handle the most common T-1 challenges without letting them derail your preparation.

https://preview.redd.it/2bshcffu5aof1.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=93b9cd55d3a5d22293bf59709cf8790fdbf6e35c

# Your Performance Day Success Plan

The fundamentals are solid. The strategies are in place. Your practice tests have shown what you're capable of.

Tomorrow isn't about adding to that foundation - it's about showcasing it.

Remember: you're not just taking a test tomorrow - you're performing. And like any performance, success comes from being mentally sharp, physically ready, and emotionally centred.

This T-1 protocol gets you there.

Tomorrow is your day. You're ready for it.

Que tu sois en sciences, commerce, informatique ou autre discipline, tu trouveras à Metz une grande variété d’espaces propices à la concentration et à la réussite.

Les bibliothèques et médiathèques restent des choix privilégiés. La médiathèque Verlaine, située à Pontiffroy, séduit particulièrement les étudiants en histoire et littérature grâce à ses collections patrimoniales riches, ses ordinateurs et une station de numérisation multimédia, disponibles sur réservation. La médiathèque de l’Agora, mêlant espace social et culturel, propose une vaste sélection de ressources, des postes informatiques avec Wifi et une programmation culturelle vivante. La médiathèque du Sablon, au centre-ville, est idéale pour les étudiants en sciences, tandis que la médiathèque du Phénix, bien que temporairement relocalisée, offre un espace de 350 m² avec Wifi et animations culturelles dans le quartier de Borny. Pour ceux résidant plus au sud, la bibliothèque de Magny propose un large choix d’encyclopédies et un catalogue numérique important, tandis que la bibliothèque de Bellecroix à l’est de la ville privilégie un accès diversifié aux ressources numériques (ebooks, VOD, musique, presse).

À l’UFR MIM, les étudiants en mathématiques, informatique ou mécanique bénéficient d’espaces individuels, collectifs et de salles informatiques équipées pour travailler après les cours, favorisant ainsi une révision efficace dans un cadre spécialisé.

Pour une ambiance plus moderne et conviviale, plusieurs espaces de coworking sont également accessibles le soir. Le Poulailler, au tiers-lieu BLIDA, offre 40 postes dans un environnement convivial avec wifi haut débit, espace détente et machine à café, pour un abonnement mensuel d’environ 60 à 80 euros. Le Grenier, quant à lui, propose un cadre plus intime avec seulement six postes et une offre à la journée (10 euros), idéale pour un usage ponctuel sans engagement.

Les étudiants appréciant une atmosphère détendue peuvent se tourner vers les cafés et bars. Entre-sort, un salon de thé décoré avec soin et doté d’un wifi illimité, est parfait pour réviser autour d’une pâtisserie. Le Fox Coffee Shop, avec son ambiance vintage et ses boissons chaudes ou froides, constitue également un repaire prisé des étudiants pour alterner travail et pauses gourmandes.

Enfin, lorsque le temps le permet, Metz propose de nombreux parcs où réviser au grand air. Le Parc de la Seille, le jardin botanique, le parc de l’Esplanade et le jardin des tanneurs offrent des espaces verts agréables, calmes et propices à la concentration, complétant ainsi l’offre diversifiée de lieux d’étude en soirée dans la ville. Ainsi, Metz combine parfaitement études, convivialité et détente, répondant aux besoins variés des étudiants.

I am a CAD drafter for an HVAC contracting firm. So i, in autoCAD, look at photos field technicians took while on the job site, draw up what the duct work looks like, make the edits requested by project managers (like removing duct work and routing it in a different way and then demonstrating it on page) and then making a 3 to 2 page drawing package file. This is my job. This is what i went to school for for 4 whole years. sure i can move up into a project engineer role in about years time but im not sure if this fits my whole career path, even then am i too young to give myself a career path? if i do will i only be riddled with dissatisfaction?
Anyways my GPA wasn’t the perfect but also  3.47 isn’t something i can’t say i’m a little stoaked about. my capstone project was also interesting too. it was an automated beverage machine riddled with arduino and C code for a popular coffee shop in the PNW. i led the design for a custom leak proof fitting that seals when removed from the machine and opens when attached, it’s also positioned at the button of its designated reservoir too (it’s actually really cool i can’t lie im very proud of my solution for this) along with it being something that works well too, the design was entirely additive for i have 3D experience especially having to get such tight tolerance down on top of material selection etc, i had three internships for a fabrication and manufacturing company that i was both a drafter and a manufacturing intern at which i build tooling that increased the production of a product 66% (not a single person cares for some reason???), i designed, tested, analyzed in FEA and manufactured a tool cleat that reduced the amount of shoulder strain that would be felt by factory worker building computer boards for a company local to my college, i made an electric jet engine from scratch, i was part of our Rocket Club dealing with structurs and manufacturing for 2 years and also the secretary too, im literally normal also like im not antisocial???, im also currently self learning Ansys because idk simulation (claims not anti social yet is learning Ansys???) etc.
i don’t know what else i can be doing. i’m starting to lose hope and with my current gig i don’t know how i can pivot because clearly my current experience isn’t cutting it for any place i apply to. i think it just makes me sad, and gives me these disillusioned thoughts of self doubt which obviously never bode well. in some way hope people are in the same boat as me but i also don’t because i want my mech e and fellow engineers to succeed and thrive too.

should be stat padding my resume? do i need to come home and start doing more engineering for more experience? can i finally just like sit back and relax and just enjoy being home? 

i’ve been applying for manufacturing, testing, process and mechanical positions but i can’t find one that will call me back. Hell i’ve began to apply for MPE engineering roles too and nothing. I just wanna do either analysis work of any kind (i got a fucking call for a structure engineer job at an aerospace firm as one of my first interviews in May and i blew it…) and i don’t even mean designing airplane wings i literally mean analyzing anything or i want to work in manufacturing and manufacturing solutions.
I basically want to make things more efficient and help people. RnD work? all of these things require a Masters or a PHD and honestly i can’t weigh the Roi. 

am i freaking out, please. i think i need someone to just tell me they went this what i did and they got their dreams fulfilled and so will i. do i give up? 

i apologize for the rant im just at my limit. i feel lied to and because of it i feel like i didnt do enough in college and i wasted it.
