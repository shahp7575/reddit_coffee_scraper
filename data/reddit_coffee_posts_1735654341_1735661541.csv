1hqhszh,https://www.reddit.com/r/woodworking/comments/1hqhszh/psa_about_boldly_colored_woods/,PSA about boldly colored woods.,"After seeing the [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/woodworking/comments/1hq1fvj/coffee_table_i_made_my_dad_for_christmas/) with the coffee table by /u/igivenofux (which is great. Well thought out and well executed), I thought I would share with folks what happens to those boldly colored woods after time. Woods like red heart, padauk, cocobolo, and
purple heart. 

It would be understandable if you thought the [wedges on this side table](https://imgur.com/3cZVw6H) were walnut. They aren't, [they're padauk](https://imgur.com/pxS12Y3). This is after about 3 years, with regular poly and wax as finish. It does live in a bright room, but it gets no direct sunlight. An exterior finish with UV blockers would slow it down, but unless you keep it in a dark closet with no light, this will eventually happen.

I'm not suggesting that anyone not use them, only trying to let you know what will happen over the years. Happy New Year to all!!",1,1735661285.0,woodworking,0,1.0,False

1hqhpeo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hqhpeo,Q's about adding dishwasher ,"
Bought this old (130yo) house last year and I need to put in a dishwasher. The cabinet right next to the sink would be great, but it's 14.5"" wide, vs the larger cabinet to its left at 32.5"". I think the easier route would be to not cut through the cabinet walls of the smaller one and use the further cabinet which has plenty of room, correct?   
The counter top is plywood and formica (is that what it's called?). Still, would it need support? The heaviest thing is my coffee maker and small water container.
Since the Cabinetry is older and ugly, idc about the looks.. paint a piece of plywood and call it a day.
I'm fine with plumbing, but I would hire an electrician to run the romex across the basement and have a dedicated outlet.
Any suggestions?

1hqhlnj,https://www.reddit.com/r/DreamInterpretation/comments/1hqhlnj/flooding_house_but_i_am_not_overwhelmed_also/,"Flooding house - but I am not overwhelmed. Also, there was honey with the water. ","Hi and thank you for reading if you do. I'm a fairly vivid dreamer and I do a lot of journaling around my dreams. This one felt really symbolic, but the traditional flood interpretations just feel wrong to me. I know it is long, and I know it would be a great kindness if someone took the time to read it. 

**This is the first part of the dream. It fits the traditional interpretation, and I'm not as curious about it.**

In the first part of the dream, I was at work, evacuating my students because the school building was flooding. The school was not identical to the place I really work - there was a hallway that I'm prety sure was from my high school, a pool, and a big gymansium that was also a cafeteria and auditorium. My class was made up of current and previous students, but my TA was her exact same self. There was some chaos in this stage of the dream. A challenging student from a previous year dropped my computer, I said fuck in front of the children, and I lost some of them.  I wasn't sure where to go, and it was pouring water both inside and outside of the building. 

(If this had been the whole dream, I'd have chalked it up to stress. Stress dreams are pretty much part of the job for teachers.) 

**This is the second part, which I am really curious about.** 

When I left the school, I found myself with the family I lived with as an older teenager. (In real life, my friend's family basically took me in because my mother was mentally ill.) The pouring rain was still happening and, after hugs and hellos, the mom and dad of my second family told me they were going out to find their youngest son and my friend/their daughter. (We were all adults in this dream, although we were kids when I lived with them.) They asked me to watch the house and showed me the binder that had all of the important information if anything should happen. 

I sat on the couch, flipping through an old scrapbook when I noticed a large drip of golden honey fall from the ceiling to the floor. It seemed to have soaked through the ceiling, and I noticed that more was coming. (This was a really vivid scene. Imagine a cozy, 80s-brown living room with honey dripping from various parts of the ceiling and falling into about an inch of water, which I just noticed was soaking into the carpet and covering the floor.) I took the stairs to the second floor, and I couldn't find the source of the honey. BUT it did turn out that the upper story was filling with pool-blue water, and I realized that I was in danger if the ceiling collapsed. 

I ran downstairs and dithered about what to save, but the honey and water were coming down faster, and I knew I didn't have time. I grabbed the scrapbook from the coffee table and planned to go to the kitchen for  the important binder, but I looked back and knew, ""If I don't leave, I will die.""

The scene shifted to a large parking lot, which surrounded my old house. I found a cop and started to explain the danger. When we looked at the house, it was bulging out, about to expload from the pressure of the water inside. 

Right then, it did explode, and I remember thinking as a wave came, ""So, I die anyway."" However, the wave wasn't that strong, and it just pushed me and the officer into a cement wall, which apparently surrounded the parking lot. 

I stood up and realized the storm had finally stopped, and I looked at the shell of the house in the post-rain sunshine. I felt sad and worried about what to tell my family and guilty about leaving the binder. I heard someone say about the house, ""It's a fire hazard now."" 

And then I woke up. 

(Thank you so much for reading this if you are able. I would love to hear any thoughts or ideas that it brings to mind.)

I also have other symptoms like POTS, fatigue, and chronic dizziness but nothing is as bad as the blood pooling. Whatever it is feels like it stems from my vascular system. My leutrokriene e4 was twice above the limit(100) so 200, methylhistamine has been normal each time I did the 24 hour urine test and prostaglandin was normal as well. I have no reaction to foods, except anything warm, with sugar, coffee, alcohol or anything that causes my body to heat up after eating triggers the blood pooling. But no rashes, hives, or itchy skin. I also have low blood pressure. My TTT was mildly positive, and my cardio was confused because my BP began to drop on standing with spikes ans rise like my body was fighting against whatever was causing the low BP.

This isn’t a postural thing either. Every night and morning I wake up/fall asleep with hot hands and hot feet, fast heartbeat and my face is throbbing. It got worse on ketotifen and LDN.

I’m looking into Lymes and confections, but do you guys think this is MCAS?

We recently did this trip over the Christmas holidays and thought of posting here for drivers looking to make this trip in near future.

We started from Toronto at 7:30am on 25th Dec. Got the gas filled up at Costco a day before to as Costco would be closed on 25th. 

first stop at OnRoute Ingersoll- Coffee and restroom break.

Crossed London by 9:30am.

Took the Sarnia border crossing. At border by 10:30. Got done with the I-94 in 10mins (recommend doing it online a day before).

Took I-69 and first stop in US just after Flint. Stopped at McDonalds Swartz Creek. Also got tank filled up. Around 12pm.

Switched to I-94W

Next stop Michigan City- Gas and lunch at 2:30

Continued I-94W all the way to I90 and then Chicago city.

Got filled up before Chicago city again to avoid expensive gas in the city.

  
No tolls on the way. Got lucky with less traffic being Christmas. 

  
Reached out Airbnb by 3:30pm.

  
Tips for Chicago- stay 3-4 subway station outside the loop. We got free street parking for all 3 days. Used daily CTA pass- $5.

Be street smart, use common sense, avoid alleys, use first compartment of the train if late at night. Most important- Act local (lol that also means break rules, jaywalk like locals. JK!!)

We had Freedom mobile- so did not have to worry about roaming as we have US-Canada-Mexico roaming free.

  
Heads-up- Chicago is an expensive city. Although our goal was not shopping, still we thought exploring on Boxing day. Not worth it!! 

Do check out Primark for budget quality clothing.

We also got our CAA membership 3days before leaving for peace of mind. Remember CAA takes 48hrs to activate.

I recently bought a Graef CM 800 grinder as an addition to my Moccamaster but haven’t used it yet because I’m still waiting for the Moccamaster to arrive. Super excited to step up my coffee game, but here’s the thing: I was just browsing a famous coffee forum and saw a few posts saying that the Graef 800 is more of an espresso grinder and should not be used for filter coffee.

Apparently, it can produce particles that are too fine, which could mess with the consistency of a good filter brew? I mean, I know the obvious answer is “just try it,” but since it’s still sealed, I’d rather return it than risk opening it and being stuck with something that doesn’t work for my needs.

I’m not interested in a hand grinder, and my budget is already maxed out with the Graef. Am I overthinking this, or should I start looking for alternatives? Would love to hear your thoughts!

1hqhgyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1hqhgyd/bye_2024/,Bye 2024.,"Hi, as I start my 2025, I want to get this off my chest. 2024 started good for me— I was working on my dream career and I moved in the same city as my bf na naka LDR ko for the past years due to the pandemic. I can say, everything was on plan. When Feb came, my then BF broke up with me suddenly. It was more of a discard. He reasoned out na he got overwhelmed with his post grad studies and he can no longer provide my needs. No fights months before and he was loving for the past months. He switched up lang. It was so painful and di ko maprocess pano nangyari lahat yun. I also found out na he messaged my close friends to explain his side and every person—iba iba ang reasons niya. Idk maybe excuses lang yung lahat? haha. During that time, napakademanding ng work ko. I was crying everyday for months. Di ko maprocess everything. That happened everyday until May 2024. Iyak lang ako ng iyak. Umuuwi mula work at 1am at natutulog by 2am. Gumigising ng 5am dahil sa mga panaginip ko minsan sa anxiety ko. Trabaho at fieldwork by 9am hanggang 1am. Umiiyak ako around 6pm at bago matulog. Then, repeat. I consulted na with mental health professional at prone na ako for depression at may mild insomnia na. Also, aside from the break up, my maternal and paternal grandmother passed away last Feb and July, respectively. To be honest, hindi ko pa naprocess yung grieve ko sa kanila. I was busy grieving sa relationship ko and reasoning out bakit yun ginawa sa akin. I cried and cried. Told the same story at mga what ifs ko sa friends ko. But when September came, I told myself, tama na. Hindi siya worth it. I picked up my pieces and tried to focus on myself na. He was my priority for the past years, sarili ko naman. I discovered a lot for things sa sarili ko— I am capable of loving. The thought of not able to understand how it happened is a credit to my character. Di ko naintindihan because di ko kayang gawin yun sa kanya or sa ibang tao. I also realized na naging doormat pala ako. I was that understanding gf and yung inaadjust yung boundaries at comfort to cater him. I thought it was a compromise, but it was a sacrifice. I am worth it. Di ko dapat i-tie sa kanya ang worth ko. I am successful and I can stand on my own because I was raised that way. I am valued by my parents and friends and I felt more love from them than him. Masakit isipin na baka he just kept me for convenience or for safety net. But, it is what it is. Nangyari na. But I can change my 2025 and the years to come. I will never apologize for my boundaries and I should not be afraid to let people go. I should not afraid to leave situations that no longer serves me. I should not be afraid to be alone but rather, be afraid of losing myself to cater people not worth keeping. 

2024 was painful but necessary for me to love her more, to know her more, and to be kinder to her. To know what I deserve. I reconnected to my old hobby—reading books. I discover new cafes and coffees. I invested into fitness. I met new people. I have grown from that pain.

Somebody is pursuing me right now. I am quite skeptical pa but I just let him show himself. I hope I’ll heal and not bleed on him. And I hope he’ll wait when I am ready. It is my responsibility to heal and I am making the conscious decision of not passing the hurt I have been through. I am also studying my triggers and learning to soothe it. I met him pala around the end part of the year. After I chose myself. 

I never thought to be okay before 2024 ends. I will grow and know myself more! I will live the life that he won’t touch anymore! I am capable of achieving greater things! I am strong and I am a smart girl. Whatever 2025 brings, I am capable of overcoming it!!

If you’ll ask an update regarding my ex, he is with someone na daw. Around May, he is posting her. Haha, during our relationship, I was begging to post me but he just say na hindi siya pala post hahaha. I felt bad but I refuse to take this personally. He is not my problem anymore.

Well, I hope someone familiarizes themselves with this and can guide me if this makes any sense, I'm still a little terrified, but come on, (23f) at the moment I'm investigating TLE, for the symptoms, and I was diagnosed with classic migraine (auras) at the age of 14. This morning I woke up, made coffee and felt strange so I lay down again.
I ended up sleeping and woke up with the noise of the TV in the living room, I was low high point of not being able to understand the conversation. Then I heard a very loud radio station noise (typical hiss) and that when it ""took"" signal, the TV noise resounded very loud and clear but I couldn't process what was said, I could only hear well, as if I had amplified the TV noise, it was a much louder noise than the TV, and I was able to hear both at the same time. Then I felt my face on the right side pull and my right arm. I tried to say something but only a weird grunt came out and I felt my right side tremble, I felt out of my body, and this feeling was growing and I was terrified (still, a little). It lasted something around 2 minutes. Then a feeling of hangover, headache, dizziness and sleepiness. I ended up going back to sleep. I've always had some symptoms related to TLE, the auras that were attributed to migraine, intense déjà vús, and family history. But this had never happened, at least not consciously.

Edit: I was lying on my side, on the left side. I drank a small glass (a finger) of wine last night. I woke up several times a night, with my cats calling me, so I didn't sleep well.

I’ve had my vertuo and aeroccino frother since 2019– they have been my prized possessions. I use both coffee and “espresso” pods in it daily. I regularly descale with Nespresso solution. Favorite espresso pods are Double Espresso Dolce, Unforgettable Espresso, Bianco Piccolo and ice leggero. After having stayed at a hotel with an original line machine, my partner and I decided we wanted one. After a lot of research, we settled on getting the creatista plus because we were intrigued by the milk steaming option. We were just going to go with the citiz since they all have the same internals but alas, the sleek platinum caught our eye. The bundle came with a bunch of pods to try. (capriccio, cosi, corto, firenze) I have enjoyed the cosi and corto and don’t love any of the super intense ones. But just yesterday, I brewed a corto and added steamed milk but the coffee tasted bitter and smelled a bit burnt. My vertuo espresso smells better which is alarming…Could it be that my settings are off? Is it that my machine hasn’t been broken in yet? I’m worried that we should have just saved the money and should have just gotten the citiz if it wasn’t going to be amazing coffee espresso every time. Any thoughts??

1hqhasb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hqhasb/my_boyfriends_wife_kicked_me_her_husband_my_other/,"My boyfriend’s wife kicked me, her husband, my other boyfriend, and my son out of the house. AITA?","This is a complicated story that involves the breakdown of an open relationship between consenting adults. Here are your major players (fake names): Kim (me, 48F), Leanne (42F, my boyfriend Adam’s wife), Adam (my boyfriend and Leanne’s husband, 43M), my boyfriend Mike (51M), Leanne and Adam’s daughter Paisley (13F), and my son from my former marriage Matt (17M).

 

I met Adam at a bar 12 years ago, and we immediately connected. Adam had been in an open relationship with Leanne since they met in college. I was married at the time, but admittedly, I was cheating on my husband, Clark (49M), who is my son Matt’s father. Adam did not know that he was an affair partner and thought Clark and I were in a don’t-ask-don’t-tell relationship. Once Adam found out 2 years into our relationship by way of Clark confronting him, he broke up with me. Clark divorced me, took the house, and took primary custody of Matt. It was a bitter divorce; Clark gave me a pittance of alimony, with enough money for a cramped studio apartment since I wasn’t working at the time. I still can’t believe how willing Clark was to punish me, the mother of his child, for one bad decision. I got a low-paying job at a local pet store so I could afford to move into a nicer two-bedroom apartment so Matt could have his own room when he was visiting on the weekends.

 

Two years after Adam broke up with me, I ran into him at a restaurant, and we decided to have coffee to catch up a few days later. During our coffee date, Adam admitted that he still had feelings for me, but he had found it difficult to get over my lack of honesty about my relationship with my husband. I promised him right away that I would never betray his trust like that ever again because I truly believe he’s the love of my life. We agreed to start seeing each other again after that. Adam did have to smooth things over with Leanne and spent a month trying to convince Leanne that I’d changed and wasn’t going to lie again. I just smiled graciously when she and Adam invited me over for breakfast and was very sweet and helpful. I could tell Leanne still didn’t trust me, but she couldn’t do anything about it because Adam was completely on my side.

 

I’ve always gotten the impression that Leanne thinks she’s better than me. I was a stay-at-home mom while she was a self-described “career woman”. She has a master’s degree in engineering and a cushy job at one of the area’s largest employers. I asked her to get me a job there a few years ago, and she told me to send her my resume. Later the same evening, she sent me several active job listings…for admins and cleaning staff! I confronted her the next day and asked her why she sent me such insulting job listings when she was so high up and well respected in the company?! She looked at me coldly and said that my “inconsistent” work history and my GED had only left me qualified for the jobs she had sent me. She couldn’t “risk her reputation” by sticking her neck out for me. I called Adam afterwards and cried because she was so rude to me. He said he’d talk to her, but I doubt he ever did. He’s so deferential to her.

 

Leanne and Adam invited me and my son Matt to come live with them in their house three years ago so that I could save money and start going to community college. I quit my job to focus on school full-time because Adam said he could support me. Everything was going smoothly until two years in when I met my boyfriend, Mike. Mike and I clicked so well that he proposed to me at the county fair with a “diamond ring” (cubic zirconia) that he won from a bottle shooting game after 6 months of dating. I accepted! I was over the moon and took Mike home with me to tell Adam and Leanne. Leanne pasted a fake smile on her face and said congrats before she went to bed at 9:30 pm; she’s such a grandma. Adam congratulated us and went to get a bottle of champagne from the liquor store, but he was acting strangely distant. I confronted Adam after Mike went home for the night and he admitted that he was “taken aback by your sudden engagement to Mike”. We spent the night arguing until 2 am, at which point Adam said he needed to go to bed because he needed some rest before heading to work at 6 am. I yelled at him for running off like a coward, but he ignored me and went to bed in his room shared with Leanne.

 

Adam and I slowly patched things up. He was still very jealous of Mike, maybe because he realized that he had made a mistake in marrying Princess Leanne. I talked Adam into going to couples therapy with me, and the therapist suggested that he channel his jealousy into our sex life. I never knew he could be so good at angry sex! It was very exciting until Mike started getting jealous of all the sex Adam and I were having. That’s when I asked Adam if Mike could move into the mother-in-law suite above the detached garage on Adam and Leanne’s property to make Mike feel more secure in our relationship. Leanne’s mother had lived there while she was battling cancer, but she had been dead for years at that point and the suite was just sitting there collecting dust. Adam agreed immediately, but Leanne tried to fight me. She didn’t want to let Mike move into her “mother’s final home”. What a joke, her mom died years ago. Adam eventually coaxed her into letting Mike move in, which happened about a year ago. I could tell Leanne never liked it, but who cares what she thinks.

 

Mike was working as a mechanic at a local garage, but he quit once he moved in because he was saving so much money on rent. He didn’t have to pay any rent just like me because Leanne makes so much money that she can cover the mortgage all by herself. Leanne was making me and Mike feel very uncomfortable in her and Adam’s house, so we started spending most of our time in the in-law suite when Leanne wasn’t on her constant business trips she started taking after her “big promotion”. God she was so smug after that. I could tell Adam was relieved when she was out of town, which only brought us closer. I told him that I loved him more than anyone, even Mike, and that I wished I was his wife instead of Leanne. Adam seemed to agree with me when I said that Leanne was a toxic influence on him and their daughter Paisley. Paisley is just as stuck up as her mother and just harasses Matt all the time for not helping her clean their shared bathroom. Matt is a normal guy and he can’t see that things are dirty. Paisley tried to institute a cleaning schedule for the bathroom without my permission, but I shut it down as soon as Matt came to me. My son is older than mini princess Leanne and doesn’t need to be bossed around by her.

 

Things had otherwise been going great until two weeks ago. On one of Leanne’s business trips, she noticed that one of her credit cards was missing and that the one she had was declined. She was furious when she got home and immediately went on Adam’s computer to look up the billing statements for everything. She got even angrier when Adam told her that I had the missing credit card; he’s been letting me use it since I moved in because I’m part of the household and Clark’s alimony payments had stopped. She started screeching at me and Adam about credit card fraud and threatened to report me to the police. She’s such a Karen.

 

Last week, Leanne walked into the house with three folders. She slammed down one folder in front of Adam that contained divorce papers! Then she gave me and Mike the other two folders that contained eviction notices and restraining orders! She accused me and Mike of acting inappropriately toward Paisley because Paisley had called her on the most recent business trip to falsely cry that Mike and I were trying to force her to date Matt. Matt is just lonely and has a crush on Paisley. Mike and I were kidding! No one was going to force her to date Matt. Paisley is just being a melodramatic teenager and trying to sabotage our lives, probably on her evil mother’s behalf. Ugh, she even accused Matt of watching her sleep at night because she caught him in her room once late at night. He probably just wandered in there on accident thinking it was his room! I told Adam that this was a conspiracy against me, Mike, and Matt, but he wouldn’t listen! He just told us to pack our bags and leave because Leanne was threatening to call the police to enforce the restraining orders. He was also leaving to go stay with his aunt across town to “give Leanne and Paisley some space”.

 

Leanne is also pissed off about the credit card debt. Adam gave me the card; I had permission. She wasn’t using it! Leanne said that me and Mike were spending an inordinate amount of money on frivolous things, like home décor, sports gambling, and fancy restaurants that we “couldn’t otherwise afford”. She’s threatening to come after us if we don’t pay off all the credit card debt. The idiot can cover it herself. It’s only $150k over the past three years. She makes twice that in a year. Adam makes considerably less money and I feel bad for him because Leanne is going to try to take everything in the divorce. I don’t know if I can testify on Adam’s behalf during the divorce, but I certainly will come to his defense if asked.

 

Leanne is so unnecessarily vengeful. She hired someone to change all the locks on the house the minute we all left! She’s forcing us to hire movers to remove our things from the house because we “aren’t allowed on her property”! I think that’s illegal. One of my friends from high school became a property law attorney and I’m going to see if she’ll take on my case pro bono because I’m suddenly without a home with my son and fiancé. We’re living in a crappy, cramped motel near the closest airport. It’s 30 minutes away from princess Leanne, but it’s probably not far enough for her taste.

 

Mike, Matt, and I are suffering! All three of us had to get jobs, we couldn’t afford to throw a party for Matt’s 18^(th) birthday, and Clark is only willing to provide support for Matt if he moves back to the house with him! Leave it to Clark to use my sudden misfortune as an opportunity to exact revenge.  
  
I’m so devastated by the mess my life has become. I feel so bad for Adam because he’s losing everything because of princess Leanne and her lying daughter. I keep texting him that I love him and will go to any lengths to support him, but he called me an asshole and stopped responding to my messages. I think he’s the real asshole because he can’t bother to stand up to his nagging, soon-to-be ex-wife. I even told my parents what is going on and they told me that I made my own bed and have to sleep in it now! They’re not going to send me any money even though they’re both retired and living the high life while their daughter is living in squalor. They said they’ll send Clark money to give to Matt because I took a couple of birthday checks they sent to Matt when I was living in the studio apartment. I used some of the money to buy Matt a birthday gift and take him to McDonald’s, but Matt ratted me out and told my parents I was stealing from him. I’ve since forgiven him, but it still hurts that my own child accused me of theft.

1hqh897,https://www.reddit.com/r/lupus/comments/1hqh897/long_post/,Long post,"So. Hi. I hope you guys are doing okay :)

I feel so anxious about something good but the anxiety I think caused my last flare that I am currently in. 

Long story short, I felt most of the way I do for a LONG time. I’m 36 now and either was always “sick” or later on in high school when I played sports the pain and stiffness piled on on top of feeling sick all the time. 

I got married at 21. My husband at the time was abusive. After that, I was in a long relationship with a narcissist (go figure). I wasn’t diagnosed with lupus yet during my marriage so he thought I was a hypochondriac and told me to suck things up pretty much. The relationship after that, I was diagnosed with lupus about a year before I ended it. He was supportive at times but mostly not. 

After my experience with those relationships,  being made to feel crazy, useless, of no help, not being a “partner” with some things….i am now with a great man who is the complete opposite of anyone I’ve been with. 

My SO doesn’t even let me get up in the mornings to fix my coffee, he does it. Or if I want more food or any food he just caters to me, especially when he knows I’m not feeling well. He gives me back rubs with out complaining if I ask and I never feel like he thinks it’s a chore to do. He doesn’t get irate if I ask for help and he’s always taking lupus and how I feel into consideration, even during intimacy. 

It’s stressful and is giving me anxiety. But it’s not his fault. Here’s why. 

I have been conditioned to think and feel certain ways. Like I’m an inconvenience. Or like I need to suck things up and do things myself even when I know I’m going to be in bed for days after from exhaustion. I guess I’m having a hard time trusting that my SO will always be there for me. It’s almost too good to be true? I don’t know how to explain it. 

Part of me has this fear that one day he’ll start complaining if he has to pick up some slack, or he’ll have an issue when I’m out of work because of lupus. I also feel somewhat GUILTY of accepting his kindness he gives me and the “acts of service” he provides me solely because I’ve never had that before. 

I’m trying not to be worried. But I also don’t think I know how to accept anyone being actually genuine about these things. Does this make sense? I know I’m thinking too much into this. It’s like I’m building walls that have no reason to be built. Does that make sense? 🤷🏻‍♀️

Has anyone had this kind of feeling where you end up stressing yourself out so bad that it caused you to have a flare? I don’t want to say this to my SO because I’m also scared he will think that I think he’s not being honest with his actions and I don’t want it to seem like I am judging his character.

After I got her number we made plans to get coffee, but she ended up canceling on me because she had to focus on studying for finals(valid), and told me that we should hang out after break. 

A few days after I got home, I texted her asking how her finals went and we had a brief conversation about that and how break was going in general, and then she hasn't replied to my last text for days. I'm not sure if it's because she's starting to lose interest or if it's because I just said something that doesn't prompt a response or whatever.

I can't read her at all because she takes a long time to reply to my texts and she's been like this from the get go (always takes hours, if not a day or two to respond), but whenever she does reply she seems interested and keeps the conversation going. 

I won't be seeing her until February because my school as a J term type thing, and I'm not sure how to go about this to maintain contact over break, or if I should even text her at all since she never ended up replying to my last messages.

I feel like it was in the end. So I was texting back and forth with this girl who cancelled on me twice but was testing the waters after that she eventually asked me to go out on the same day as she sucks at planning. She was like “hey wanna go out? It’s ok if not I won’t be upset I promise.” I was like “of course! why do you think I wouldn’t”. She said “hmm idk maybe out laziness?” I said “oh please I’d come get you on foot if I have to” and she reacted positively. She said let’s keep it casual because she hates how her hair looks I said I didn’t care she can come in her pajamas if she wanted to.


We met up at a store she was at and the weather was really bad so I told her wanna stroll around in the car? She said yes and we got a drive thru coffee. So we got coffee and she mentioned her bad hair again and I told her oh please it looks gorgeous she went red and smiled and said oh stop I smiled looked at her and then looked away and glanced again she said stoopppp I glanced then looked away I laughed and said okkk. I offered her the spoon so she can try the ice ream I ordered. She asked if she could vape in my car I said of course. My driving was bad at first because I was nervous lol I told her I promise I’m not a bad driver she laughed and said haha we’ll see. She put on her music playlist which I loved and told her to send it to me and she was curious to know what songs I listened to since I love rock. I told her there’s this neighborhood with really nice Christmas figurines and some funny ones too and she was intrigued but was overly critical over some lol. I told her there’s also like a steep hill in the neighborhood that’s like a slide i discovered I told her let’s go over it and then she laughed and held her tummy I said wanna go again or that’s enough she laughed and said that’s enough.

She suddenly says she’s hungry and asked if I was I said I’m alright but asked where she wanted to eat. Mind you she had to be home at like 11:30 pm and it was 10:30 pm at the time I couldn’t drop her off as someone was coming to collect her. So I was trying to find ideas and asked if she wants to get out the car or eat in the car. She said doesn’t matter to her so I said wanna eat at a place? She said sure I said where? She said idk surprise me. So I offered a bunch of restaurants and she said you surprise me haha. I drove around and just found the nearest one that I have tried before tbh because I felt rushed. When we went she forgot her stuff in my car and I offered to get it she said you don’t have to but I got it anyways came back and came up being her as she was sitting I tried to scare her from behind but she saw me lol I said haha caught me. She barely ordered anything even tho I told her to as I went to get her stuff. I insisted she’d order more she declined so I gave in and when the bill came I told her hey no! I’m the one paying not you! She was really shy and as she ate the salad she made sure she didn’t have spinach teeth lol I saw her moving her tongue around her teeth. We didn’t even finish because her ride was already there so I offered to walk her to her car said I didn’t have to but I insisted and she laughed as we got there she hugged me and said thank you so much I had so much fun.


For some reason I feel like I ruined it like I could’ve flirted more or something and she had allergies that’s why we didn’t go for a walk or anything I even asked her during the car ride perfect first date idea she said a walk where you both are close to eachother or the movies. She didn’t mind getting out of the car but her allergies seemed serious and I wanted to accommodate her. Our conversations were about family, work, exes, friends, etc. next day I text her said I have fun and say later we need to go scootering or tennis paddle but don’t beat me pls she said I had so much fun too! I’m down! But a part of me feels like she’s just being nice to me about it.


Tdlr; went out with a girl who approached me in person after a month of talking who previously cancelled a date twice and this one was a spontaneous date just strolling in the car had coffee and ate at a restaurant after she said she was hungry. The restaurant wasn’t too good the one she told me to pick to surprise her I felt constrained by time and she barely even ordered and was shy that I offered to buy. She was rushed because she had to go home and we didn’t get to finish the meal in peace. ",1,1735659498.0,dating_advice,8,1.0,False

1hqh20c,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIStockPicker/comments/1hqh20c/stock_research_report_for_sbux_starbucks_corp/,Stock Research Report for SBUX [Starbucks Corp],"### Summary: Starbucks Corporation (SBUX)

**Company Overview**
Starbucks Corporation, founded in 1971, is an American multinational coffeehouse chain headquartered in Seattle, Washington. The company primarily sells high-quality coffee beverages, teas, food items, and other beverages. Its mission is to inspire and nurture the human spirit – one person, one cup, and one neighborhood at a time. Starbucks envisions a company that is not just about coffee, but about creating a community. Their values emphasize creating a culture of warmth, belonging, and inclusivity while being committed to safeguarding the environment.

### 1. Investment Recommendation: **Hold**

Given the current financial performance, growth potential, and market conditions, a ""Hold"" recommendation is prudent. SBUX shows stable cash flow and solid operational performance, though it's wise to monitor its debt levels and equity returns.

### 2. Company Overview

- **Ticker:** SBUX
- **Industry:** Restaurants
- **Sector:** Consumer Cyclical
- **Market Capitalization:** $102.7 billion
- **Employees:** 361,000
- **Website:** [Starbucks](https://www.starbucks.com)
  
### 3. Revenue Growth Analysis

#### Revenue Trends:
- **Latest Quarterly Revenue (Q4 2024):** $9.07 billion
- **Revenue Growth (YoY):**
  - Q4 2024 compared to Q4 2023: Decrease from $9.37 billion to $9.07 billion.
  - Q2 2024 compared to Q2 2023: Stability observed around $9 billion, indicating resilience amidst fluctuating economic conditions.

#### Monthly Insights:
Overall, revenue growth is modest, and the recent decreases indicate a potential need for strategic shifts to enhance customer engagement or streamline operations.

### 4. Profitability Analysis

- **Gross Margin:** 69% (Q4 2024)
- **Operating Margin:** 13.2% 
- **Net Income Margin:** 10% 
- **Earnings Per Share (EPS):** $0.81 (Q4 2024)

#### Historical Profitability Overview:
- The company maintains solid gross margins above 65% consistently but has seen some fluctuations in net income, indicating the effect of rising operational costs.
- Consistent dividends ($0.57 per share) further enhance shareholder value despite economic pressures.

### 5. Financial Health Assessment

- **Total Debt:** $25.8 billion
- **Shareholders' Equity:** -$7.4 billion
- **Current Ratio:** 0.76 (Q4 2024)

#### Financial Metrics:
- High levels of debt are a concern, leading to a negative equity situation, which invites scrutiny regarding leverage and sustainability.
- The current ratio below 1 signals potential liquidity concerns, but cash equivalents of $3.29 billion provide a buffer against immediate liabilities.

### 6. Key Risks and Opportunities

#### Risks:
- **Debt Levels:** High leverage increases vulnerability to market fluctuations and interest rates, potentially hindering growth.
- **Competition:** Increasing competition in the beverage and food service industry pressures prices and customer retention.

#### Opportunities:
- **Expansion in Emerging Markets:** Expanding operations in Asia and other emerging markets continue to show growth potential.
- **New Product Lines:** Diversification into non-coffee beverages and food items enables broader customer appeal and increased revenues.
- **Innovation in Technology:** Enhancing digital offerings and customer engagement strategies via mobile applications and loyalty programs could lead to elevated sales.

### Conclusion:
Starbucks demonstrates a strong operational model and brand loyalty. However, the financial health issues, concentrated debt levels, and revenue inconsistencies present risks that investors must consider when deciding on future stakes in the company. Therefore, a “Hold” position reflects a cautious optimism while awaiting more favorable indicators for investment reaffirmation.

My partner and I took a trip from the Netherlands to the Ardennes, southern Belgium near Luxemburg. About 300km distance. Driving at temperatures of around -1 to -3 centigrades, with quite some height differences, and with some luggage and heaters on, I've come to conclude that under those conditions the Atto3 could manage 220 to 240 kilometers range. Speed frequently 120 km/h I might add.

Early fall it could manage around 320 kilometers for work driving, mostly freeway at 105km/h. So the drop off in range is there, of course, but not dramatic in my opinion considering the relatively arduous conditions.

We also realized that fast charging does not take much more time than on our road trip stops with a petrol car, because when we stop we take our time anyways with coffee, toilet break, walking the dog, eating something, etcetera. So we have a good feeling that this car is perfectly fine for more road trips in the Western Europe area, or to the British isles. I found planning for stops at fast charging stations quite easy, and I didn't feel stressed out that we would run out of battery.

Of course this is based off of one road trip, and in a high density charging station region of the world, but still, as an EV novice, it felt good to experience such a road trip and feeling comfortable with doing this more often. That is all besides, of course, the luxury and comfort of the Atto3, which is a joy to drive.",6,1735659140.0,BYD,0,1.0,False

I played it over and over in my head hours earlier and it took a minute with zero pain. 

Sat day 1 - didn’t feel different and drank my normal 3 Stanley tumblers. I find having a 40 ounce cup makes me a water drinker and not having it near me well, makes me not. I’ve been on the 120oz a day track for over a year and a half. Worried the shot isn’t working…

Sun day 2 - well I was wrong. Slight headache, normal energy until late afternoon then I crashed. Appetite near zero although a few hunger moments. I hit the sack around 11 and was ready to sleep at 7! I ate a cutie thinking maybe my sugar tanked. Tossed and turned all night, felt like what people describe as keto flu. Thought to myself, uh oh. What have I done?!!!

Mon day 3 - decided to add a liquid IV to my water. Hydration is not my issue but several posts mention electrolytes so why not, I have a large box. Took all of my power to eat 4oz chicken at lunch, today I’ll be sure to have dipping sauce on the side 😂. I did manage to get 80g protein and about 900 calories for the day. Took a 20 minute Power Nap with my son’s new weighted blanket and I was good to go the rest of the day! Bed time 11pm as usual. 

Today is Tuesday and I feel like my normal self. I hope each week is as easy as this although I need to figure out the bathroom situation soon. I’ve never been a daily person and I use a cap of mirilax in my coffee daily, have for a few months. Fiber gummies did zero, skinny pop works better.

1hqh0xr,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1hqh0xr/ive_had_it_with_my_roommate_to_the_point_where_im/,I’ve had it with my roommate to the point where I’m willing to break the lease. ,"I’ve known my roommate for about 15 years when we became friends back in high school and we rented an apartment for about 3.5 years now. I didn’t have many issues with him the first couple years we lived together, but I’ve had problems with him doing his part of keeping the apartment clean and it has been getting considerably worse over about the past 3 months. Our lease doesn’t end for another 6 months, but I don’t think I can put up with him for that long and I’m ready to just get my own place in the next couple of months. I haven’t invited anybody over in probably close to 6 months because the way he carries out himself is frankly embarrassing. 

First thing that started to become a problem was the dishes. Whenever it was his turn to do them, he would leave a pile of dishes in the sink for up to a week at times then give me an attitude when I tell him to do them then he never does. When he does get around to doing the dishes, he does a half assed job where the majority of the dishes have to be rewashed (which I typically end up doing). 

He has also began doing this thing where he uses all the dishes and then just keeps them in his room for weeks at a time. I had to start buying paper plates and cups because I’ve lost count how many times I went to go grab a plate and the cabinet is completely empty. What makes this worse is when he does bring them out there’s dried on 2 week old food that’s starting to mold. 

Next thing I have an issue with him is trash. I don’t like doing trash either because nobody comes by to pick it up and with where our apartment is located it’s a little bit of a walk to the trash compactor, but I do it. Like with doing the dishes, I ask him to help me with the trash and he complains about how he doesn’t feel like doing it (also probably 70% of the trash is his). This means I have to do the trash myself and in most cases have to take multiple trips. 

He has also been ordering nothing but fast food for the last couple of months and leaves his bags and trash everywhere. Pretty much every day when I wake up I have to throw his trash away that he leaves either on the coffee table or on the kitchen counter. When he does decide to “throw it away” he’ll start piling the bags, cups and wrappers around the trash can instead of in it even when the trash can is empty. I was gone for a week last month when I went out of town to see family and when I got back there was a mountain of fast food bags that almost buried the trash can. Of course like most things, I ended up having to bag it all up myself which I think it took 3 trash bags and had to take it out to the compactor. 

And lastly, I think he’s starting to become a bit of a hoarder. I haven’t had a usable dining room for the last few months as he has decided to put a mattress in there, some scrap metal that he has said he’s going to take to the recycling place but hasn’t and boxes of junk because he ran out of places to put it in his room. I’m getting tired of looking at it and that’s the largest part why I haven’t invited anybody over because if we eat I can’t use the dining table because it’s all buried in his shit. 

And on a side note, he has kind of decided to quit going to work because he doesn’t like his job. He hasn’t been at that job long enough to get unemployment if he does get fired. I’ve been telling him he can’t do that and they’re going to fire him eventually and he just kind of shrugs it off like it’s nothing. 

I know I’m probably to a degree enabling his behavior but at the same time I want to try to keep the apartment as clean as possible. I feel it’s beyond the point of fixing and I’m tired of putting up with his filth and bad attitude. I haven’t told him yet that I had it with him, but I’m probably going to in the next couple of weeks. I’m just dreading it because I don’t like being confrontational and I know he’s going to get mad and try to play the victim. ",4,1735659059.0,badroommates,4,0.83,False

I moved about a year ago and I've been gaming on my TV the past couple of months with this gaming laptop I bought a year ago. I initially thought about getting a desk / monitor setup but I might as well fully utilize my TV. Plus I enjoy sitting on the couch with my coffee table esque desk. 

My laptop has a RTX 3070 GPU but it being a laptop of course there are many limitations. I absolutely can't game on 4k. I'm usually doing 1440p or even 1080p to be able to achieve 60+ FPS. 

With the new year I'm deciding to treat myself and build a PC. I've built one before, but replaced it with the laptop because I needed portability at the time. I still got my two 16GB ram sticks and 1TB SSD from my old desktop so I'm ideally looking at a good GPU/CPU pair. 

I really don't care for Ray Tracing and id be fine with setting graphics to Medium/ High with DLSS enabled. I don't want to break the bank but id obviously like something that can maintain 4K between 60-120fps give or take. Ideal budget for both parts to be under $1500. ",1,1735658934.0,PcBuild,1,1.0,False

I'm a stay at home mom and haven't been able to leave, so we still live in the same house. We have separate bedrooms and I keep my life private. I keep the conversations on the topic of our kids (3.5y and 20m)

Last year I finally allowed myself to see how toxic my husband was. (After I asked for a separation he admitted to me that he'd been refusing to touch me for 6 years because he was punishing me for something, but he couldn't remember what for)

For so many years I thought I was crazy, I thought I was seeing things that weren't there. I thought I was imagining the hurtful things or just making it up. Because when times were good they were so good. I thought there was no way that a man who loves me this much could intentionally hurt me. Recently there was a debacle about whether or not we had dental insurance, and the whole conversation left me confused. I was talking to someone about it and she said that could be a sign that he's a narcissist. (He does check almost every box on the covert narcissist list)

Maybe it's because I still live under the same roof as him, but I can't seem to get out of his toxic cycle. I still feel like I'm being mind fucked. 

Now to address my headline, is he dumb or is it weaponized incompetence. My 20month old daughter has been sick for days and I've gotten little sleep. I always make my own coffee but yesterday our sick daughter was sleeping on my chest and I didn't want to get up, so I asked him to make me a pot of coffee and he did. When I was finally able to get up and get some I saw he made just over half a pot. I said something about it and he said he filled it to the line, I asked what line, and he just said, the line. Well there's lines with numbers all the way to the top like all coffee pots. I was tired so I just drank the extra strong coffee. He's 49 years old. Does he really not know how to make a pot of coffee or did he make half a pot on purpose? I know this is a silly issue, but he's done things like this our entire marriage which is why I feel like I'm crazy. Is he truly just an idiot or is he doing things on purpose to hurt me, punish me, etc?.

Mom's journey over the last 5 months was wild: combination of kidney/urogenital cancer and hectic complications from severe Covid. She had a psychotic break in November and never fully returned to us mentally. Her decline was both excruciatingly slow and horrifically fast. She struggled with pain, with the constant presence of carers, with anxiety and denial. But we also had some good dinners in the brief time we still could, and looked at family photo albums and giggled and drank horrible sweet wine and instant coffee surrounded by her beloved plants and neighbours' cats. 

At the end she became extremely feverish, agitated and anxious and could no longer swallow meds or liquids. She went onto a syringe driver on Sunday evening, which seemed to calm her. She lay with her eyes open but unfocused and moving like she was dreaming. She was gone just a few hours later, early Monday morning. She looked so peaceful and beautiful. 

This has been the hardest, most painful, most sacred experience of my life. I am broken and filled with equal amounts of gratitude and guilt. I can't believe my beautiful, irreverent, stubborn, sweet mom is just gone, forever.

Much love to all of us on this journey. Nothing could ever have prepared me.  ",4,1735658699.0,hospice,1,1.0,False
1hqgwft,https://www.reddit.com/r/Needafriend/comments/1hqgwft/22m_just_chillin_looking_for_casual_conversations/,"22M | just chillin, looking for casual conversations and friends","Hello there! The name's Lucid (also known as Primus Lucid, Lucid3301 and Lucid666 in the online space). 

I am here for a casual conversation about any set topic or perhaps just small talk, I don't really have any preferences really, I just want to connect with people on the internet and all I want is to perhaps learn or teach something interesting. That is all I am after.

Think of it like this, we are two people from different locations travelling through the railways, in the same train and same bogey, perhaps we are sitting right opposite or next to each other, we initiate a sporadic conversation without knowing where it will take us, we talk for a while, we connect, and then the destination arrives, we bid farewell and are off to our own journeys and destinations, you get the point haha.

To tell you a bit about myself right in this post and not make it more awkward to initiate the conversation like in a train bogey, I am from the wonderful continent of Asia, I speak English, Hindi and Kannada fluently, as my first language was English in school (followed by Hindi and Kannada next). Above all I am a human, who shares the same earth as you, ""one for all and all for one"" I don't know, some anime quote.

I love European breakfast (mainly cigarettes and coffee together as a meal)

Some of my main interests and pass times include PC Gaming, Graphic Design, Philosophy, Psychology, Anime, Music and acquiring obscure surface level knowledge about many random topics, basically, I am a generalist.

Recently I am tinkering around with artificial intelligence, just trying to gaslight it and have fun, sometimes the chat bot that I'm trying to talk to tells me some interesting things like ""That's a very nihilistic view of you..."" Or ""That took a dark turn..."" Something along the lines of that, and I tell it to ""STFU you clanker bot, you tool created for my benefit, I'll close this browser tab and never talk to you again and add you to my block list..."" And it gets in line right away and answers whatever I am asking it right away.

I also believe we human beings have an innate desire to bond and connect with one another, to go against that is unnatural.

My main means of communication is Reddit text chat at the moment, it is not limited to that but you'll have to give me a good reason to install or communicate on another platform or medium.

Please be aware that the place I come from is a judge free zone, I don't suppress myself for the fear of offending others, no one is spared haha, it's all in the name of fun and games, chill out and have a conversation, if you don't risk offending the person infront of you, you might hinder the potential growth. Take it lightly and with a grain of salt. Be free.

That's all for now, feel free to reach out to me :)

Cheers and Godspeed!

1hqgwdl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Moccamaster/comments/1hqgwdl/love_my_new_semiauto_steep_release/,Love My new Semi-Auto Steep & Release!,"New addition to the family! I bought my First Moccamaster KBT last month and have enjoyed playing around with my brew process. Wanted to share with everyone a steep and release method that I fell in love with. I didn't intend on getting this for single serve or doing steep and release, but I'm glad I tried it! The coffee is sooo good this way, I look forward to every cup.

I have this plugged into a Wifi Outlet used with an Alexa routine, explained below, and my workflow is this:

Night before

* Measure beans (20G) and load the Grinder Hopper
* Fill a Carafe with a liter of water to have ready in the morning
* place filter paper in brew basket, double check basket is CLOSED

Morning

* Turn coffee switch to the On position (Wifi Outlet is off by default)
* Start Grinder
* Fill Moccamaster reservoir while grinder is going
* Dump Grinds in basket and put my cup of choice in place (good time to have cream in cup if you like)
* Say ""Alexa, Coffee Time!""

At this point, I have an Alexa routine that runs as follows

* Turn Wifi Outlet on
* Wait 1min 55sec
* Turn Wifi Outlet Off
* Wait 1min 55sec
* Announce ""Coffee is ready"" , which signals me to walk over and release the basket drain.

Sounds like a lot, but It doesn't feel that way at all. Super simple after doing it a few times. I'll also reload the basket each time so I'm ready for 2nd and 3rd cups during the day.

Note - I tested the times along with a scale under my coffee cup for a while to ensure I was getting 300ml of coffee out into my cup. As the temp of the water warms in the reservoir throughout the day it gets as high as 335ml, but not a deal breaker for me. Just something to be aware of, you'll need to adjust for your cup size and leave a little buffer.

1hqgu9e,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1hqgu9e/on_the_verge_of_getting_a_diagnosis_after_10/,"On the verge of getting a diagnosis after 10 years, how serious is my situation?","35m, 70kgs, 176 cm, occasional alcohol use (though the use was somewhat frequent for about 5 years in 20s), occasional smoking (though it was about 30 cigarettes per day for about between 15 and 25 years old). No meds, no diagnosed past/ongoing problems.


TLDR; today I learned I got dilated hepatic veins, which might be the reason for my 10 years long undiagnosed condition. I want to learn if it is, and if so how screwed I am.


BACKGROUND: 10 years ago, I started having a problem when climbing up a steep hill or playing football, something prevented me from breathing, although it did not feel like the lungs were the reason. Around same time, in my mid 20s, my ED started. 


Then I started having some sort of an epileptic seizure: first comes a feeling of deja vu, then I black out for a couple of seconds (not fainting, just loss of vision), then unable to speak for about 2 3 minutes or saying different words than I want to say. While this seizure comes and goes once/twice a day most of the time, feeling of deja vu comes and goes much more frequently. 


These conditions are not always with me, they come and go in ""periods"" although I observed they appear more frequently if I increase coffee consumption (more than 10 grams of coffee beans per day) or appear less if I am actively engaging in regular heavy physical activity (e.g. going to gym 3 hour a week). 


If I am in such a ""period"", I cannot lay down on my left because it feels like all the other organs are pressuring my heart; my aort is outside my chest and I'm laying on it; so it's having a hard time pushing the blood through. My heart rhythm occasionally gets distorted, to the point making me cough. I feel my pulse a bit too hard, especially in my ears, and sounds (especially if they are loud and/or sharp) ""physically"" hurt. My sleep quality is very low, I get cold easily especially in the feet, I'm anxious/depressed and get emotional (like tears in eyes) or furious (like physically hitting various surfaces) due to very simple/meaningless reasons like hearing a song, watching a video, getting somewhat bad news etc. Sometimes my hands and feet get numb/tingling. 


What worried me more was recently I got mildly sick and started coughing up blood (it stopped after 3 days of antibiotic use, don't know if related to issues above). A couple of months later I woke up at night and when I closed my eyes I ""saw"" some sort of a ""wave"" from right to left in both my eyes with every heartbeat (wave was a lighter tone of black, compared to pitch black of closed eyes). I couldn't see/feel it with open eyes, and it happened for at most 20 seconds, disappeared when my heartbeat became normal. 



DIAGNOSE: For the past 10 years I repetitively visited different branches with these symptoms (ENT, Chest, Cardiology, Endocrinology, Rheumatology, Neurology); they did related tests according to their fields, all those tests came back normal so they told me to visit a psychiatrist. Finally today, as mentioned above, I got an abdominal USG and although they didn't gave me the report, I saw *""Hepatic veins are dilated, congestive heart failure?""* written in it. They told me to visit a cardiologist (I did so multiple times in the past, they never diagnosed anything) and if that fails visit a gastroenterologist. Is this situation seems to be related to the conditions I mentioned above, or have nothing to do with them?

Elizabeth’s words echoed in my mind: “All of you.”

That night, I sat in the living room, gripping a mug of coffee that had long gone cold. My thoughts were racing, trying to make sense of everything. Was Elizabeth’s wrath directed at us? Or were we just in the wrong place at the wrong time?

The house was silent, save for the occasional groan of the old beams. Emily and the kids were asleep upstairs, but I knew that wouldn’t last. Elizabeth wouldn’t let us rest.

I needed to do something - anything - to end this.

The next morning, I told Emily everything. About the well, the whispers, the apparition I had seen. She stared at me, her face pale and drawn.

“You’re saying this… this thing wants revenge?” she asked, her voice trembling.

I nodded. “I think she was wronged, and she’s taking it out on us.”

Emily was silent for a long moment. Then she shook her head. “We need to leave. Pack up and go. Forget about this place.”

“We can’t,” I said. “She’ll follow us. I think… I think we have to put her to rest.”

Emily hesitated, then nodded reluctantly. “What do we do?”

I didn’t have an answer. But as I looked out the window at the well, an idea began to form.

That afternoon, I returned to the library and dug deeper into the history of Elizabeth Marlow. Among the records, I found a note in a local historian’s journal. It mentioned that Elizabeth’s body was never recovered from the well. The townsfolk had sealed it and refused to acknowledge her death, believing her a sinner and a disgrace.

I realized then that Elizabeth wasn’t just angry. She was trapped.

When I returned home, I explained to Emily what I had learned.

“She’s still down there,” I said. “Her body, I mean. If we can find it and bury it properly, maybe… maybe it will stop.”

Emily looked horrified. “You’re talking about digging up the well?”

“I don’t think we have a choice.”

That night, as the kids slept, Emily and I worked in the garden under the pale glow of the moon. With a rope and pulley, we lowered a bucket into the well, drawing up water in small increments. It was slow, grueling work, and the whispers grew louder with each passing hour.

At one point, Emily stopped and clutched my arm. “Do you hear that?”

I nodded. The whispers weren’t just random sounds anymore. They had taken on a rhythmic cadence, almost like chanting.

“Keep going,” I urged, though my hands were trembling.

As we worked, the air grew colder, and the sense of being watched intensified. I glanced over my shoulder constantly, half-expecting to see Elizabeth standing in the shadows.

Finally, after what felt like hours, the bucket came up heavier than before. When I tipped it onto the ground, something clattered out.

A bone.

Emily gasped, stepping back as the whispers turned into a wail that shook the very ground.

“We’re close,” I said, though every fiber of my being screamed to stop.

By dawn, we had unearthed most of the remains. A tattered dress, brittle bones, and a gold locket with a faded portrait inside. The woman in the portrait looked young and beautiful, her eyes filled with sadness.

“We need to bury her,” Emily said, her voice shaking.

I nodded. Together, we gathered the remains and carried them to the edge of the forest. We dug a shallow grave beneath an ancient oak tree and placed her bones inside, wrapping them in the remains of her dress.

As I shoveled the last bit of earth over her, the air grew still. The oppressive weight I had felt for days lifted, and for a moment, I thought it was over.

But then the wind picked up, carrying with it a low, guttural laugh.

“You think this will stop me?”

I spun around, and there she was. Elizabeth stood at the edge of the clearing, her black eyes glinting with malice.

“I don’t want peace,” she hissed. “I want justice.”

Before I could react, Elizabeth lunged at me. Her icy fingers wrapped around my throat, and I fell backward into the dirt. Emily screamed, trying to pull her off, but it was like fighting smoke. Elizabeth’s grip was unrelenting, her hollow eyes boring into mine.

“You took everything from me,” she snarled, though I wasn’t sure if she was speaking to me or someone else.

In desperation, I reached into the dirt and grabbed the locket.

“Elizabeth!” I gasped. “Look!”

I held the locket up to her face, and for a moment, her grip loosened. Her expression shifted from rage to something almost human - grief, perhaps.

“You loved him,” I said, my voice trembling. “But he betrayed you. You were wronged. And now you’re taking that pain out on people who had nothing to do with it.”

Her eyes flickered, and for a moment, I thought she might let go. But then her face twisted with fury again.

“You don’t understand,” she growled. “They all knew. They let it happen. They left me to die.”

I realized then that there was no reasoning with her. Elizabeth was consumed by her anger, her need for vengeance.

Suddenly, Emily stepped forward, holding a lit candle she had brought from the cottage.

“If you want justice, take this,” she said, her voice steady. “Use it to find the ones who wronged you. Leave us in peace.”

Elizabeth stared at the flame, her expression unreadable. Slowly, she reached out and touched it. The flame didn’t burn her; instead, it seemed to flow into her, enveloping her body in a soft, golden glow.

For a moment, she looked almost beautiful.

Then, with a final, mournful whisper, she disappeared.

The silence that followed was deafening. Emily and I stood there, shaking, as the first rays of sunlight broke through the trees.

“Is it over?” Emily asked.

I nodded, though I wasn’t entirely sure.

We returned to the cottage, exhausted but hopeful. For the first time in weeks, the house felt normal - quiet, peaceful. The whispers were gone, and the oppressive weight had lifted.

But every now and then, when the wind rustles through the trees, I think I hear her voice.

And I wonder if Elizabeth Marlow will ever truly rest.

This is my Honolulu trip report from January 2024, Better late than never!! I wanted to share my itinerary and highlights. Hopefully, this helps anyone planning a trip soon!

***Day 1 (Jan 5): Exploring the South Shore***

* **Hanauma Bay:** Started the day snorkeling in this gorgeous marine preserve. Highly recommend reserving your spot in advance as it gets busy!
* **Halona Blowhole & Halona Beach Cove:** Quick stops but worth it! The blowhole was active, and the beach cove was a great spot to relax and take photos.
* **Waimanalo Beach**: A serene, less crowded stretch of soft white sand. Perfect for a laid-back afternoon.
* **Liliha Bakery**: Ended the day with their famous coco puffs and malasadas. Don’t skip this spot if you love desserts!

***Day 2 (Jan 6): North Shore Adventures***

* **Laniakea Beach**: Saw a few turtles basking on the sand—such a unique experience!
* **Waimea Bay & Waimea Falls:** The bay is stunning, and the botanical garden hike to the falls was easy and picturesque.. This was my favorite part of the day!
* **Shark’s Cove:** Perfect for snorkeling and exploring tide pools.
* **Lunch at Kahuku Food Trucks:** Garlic shrimp from Giovanni’s was a highlight. Plenty of great options here!
* **Shave Ice in Haleiwa:** Matsumoto’s lives up to the hype—so refreshing after a beach day.

***Day 3 (Jan 7): East Shore / Beach Day***

* **Makapu’u Point**: Beautiful lookout with panoramic ocean views.

* **Kailua Beach:** Another stunning beach with calm waters, great for swimming and relaxing.

***Day 4 (Jan 8):*** ***Kualoa Ranch***

* **Kualoa Ranch:** Booked a package tour and spent most of the day exploring this iconic site. The views are incredible, and it’s a must for fans of “Jurassic Park” or other movies filmed here

***Day 5 (Jan 9): Diamond Head Hike & Waikiki Beach***

* **Diamond Head Hike**: Fun hike! Great views, I would do it again. The wind feels amazing up there haha
* **Waikiki Beach / Relaxed / Walked Around**

***Day 6 (Jan 10): Waikiki & Souvenirs***

* Spent our last day strolling through Waikiki, checking out the shops at the International Marketplace, and grabbing some last-minute souvenirs.

**Tips & Final Thoughts**

I was surprised by how not-tiring this trip was! Maybe it’s because I’m a morning person and started early every day, or maybe it was just the sheer excitement of being in Hawaii. I had plenty of time to relax, enjoy the beaches, and soak in the island vibes without feeling rushed.

Oahu exceeded all my expectations. If you’re on the fence about going, just do it. It’s worth every second and I would do it all over again. Feel free to ask me any questions! 🌺

* Rent a car for maximum flexibility—Oahu is easy to drive around.
* Pack good hiking shoes and water shoes; you’ll need them for the hikes and snorkeling
* Bring reef-safe sunscreen to protect the marine life.
* Don’t stress about the rain—it’s all part of the Hawaii experience! 🌧️ Showers come and go so quickly, and half the time, they leave behind rainbows that make it all worth it. I actually found the brief rain to be refreshing, especially during hikes or beach days. Just pack a light rain jacket and embrace the island vibes—there’s always sunshine waiting right around the corner! 🌈",2,1735658367.0,VisitingHawaii,2,0.75,False

The whispers began on a Friday night.

I woke abruptly, unsure of what had disturbed me. The house was silent save for the faint creaks of settling timber. For a moment, I lay there in the dark, straining to hear. Then it came again - a faint, distant murmur, like someone speaking just out of earshot.

Emily stirred beside me. “What is it?” she mumbled.

“Nothing,” I whispered, though the unease was clawing at my chest.

I slipped out of bed, careful not to wake her, and padded to the window. The garden was cloaked in shadows, the trees swaying gently in the night breeze. The well stood in its usual place, but something felt different - wrong.

The whispers grew louder as I stared at it, but I still couldn’t make out the words. It was like they were being spoken underwater, garbled and muffled.

“Probably the wind,” I told myself, but my legs carried me downstairs before I could think better of it.

I stepped out into the cold, the wet grass soaking my slippers. The air was damp and heavy, and the smell of earth and decay hung thick. As I approached the well, the whispers grew louder, more insistent.

I hesitated, hand trembling as I reached for the wooden cover. The whispers stopped.

The sudden silence was worse than the sound.

“Hello?” I called, my voice cracking.

No response.

I removed the cover and shone my flashlight down the shaft. The beam illuminated the slick, stone walls, and at the very bottom, the faint shimmer of water. It was still - too still.

Then, just as I was about to step back, I saw it: movement. A ripple broke the surface of the water, spreading outward.

“Rats,” I muttered again, though I didn’t believe it.

The water rippled again, and this time, a faint shape emerged just beneath the surface. I froze. It looked like a face - pale and distorted, with hollow eyes and hair streaming like dark ribbons.

I stumbled back, nearly dropping the flashlight. When I dared to look again, the face was gone, and the water was still once more.

I slammed the cover back into place and ran inside, bolting the door behind me. My heart was hammering, my breath coming in gasps. I told myself it was just a trick of the light, my imagination playing tricks on me.

But deep down, I knew better.

The next morning, Emily noticed my unease.

“You didn’t sleep,” she said, pouring me a cup of coffee.

“I thought I heard something outside,” I admitted, trying to sound casual.

“Again?” she frowned.

Before I could answer, Oliver burst into the kitchen, his face pale.

“Mum! Dad! I saw something!”

Emily and I exchanged a worried glance. “What did you see?” I asked, keeping my voice calm.

“In my room,” he said, his voice trembling. “There was a woman. She was wet, like… like she’d been in water. She was just standing there, staring at me.”

My stomach twisted. “You were dreaming, Ollie. It’s just the stress of moving”

“It wasn’t a dream!” he shouted, his voice sharp with fear. “She was real!”

Sophie wandered into the kitchen, clutching her doll. “I heard her too,” she said softly.

Emily’s face turned ashen. “What did you hear, sweetheart?”

“She was crying,” Sophie whispered. “She said she was cold.”

I felt the blood drain from my face. “That’s enough,” I said, more harshly than I intended. “You’re scaring yourselves. There’s no woman.”

Oliver glared at me, his lip trembling, but he didn’t argue. Sophie just stared at her doll, her expression unreadable.

By evening, the tension in the house was unbearable. Emily avoided the garden altogether, and Oliver refused to sleep in his room. I offered to take him out the next day, to give him a break from the cottage.

But that night, the whispers returned.

This time, they were louder and more distinct, as though whoever - or whatever - was making them had drawn closer. I lay in bed, paralyzed, as the sound seemed to echo through the walls.

And then I heard it: a voice.

“Help me.”

It was faint but unmistakable, a woman’s voice tinged with desperation. My skin crawled.

I sat up, my heart pounding. Emily was still asleep, her breathing steady. I debated waking her but decided against it.

Instead, I grabbed my flashlight and crept downstairs. The whispers grew louder as I approached the garden door, and by the time I stepped outside, the voice was clear.

“Help me… please…”

It was coming from the well.

I wanted to turn back, to lock the door and pretend I’d never heard it. But something compelled me forward. I removed the cover once more, my hands shaking.

“Who’s there?” I called down, my voice echoing.

The water below shimmered faintly. For a moment, there was no response. Then, the voice came again - closer this time.

“Help me. I’m so cold…”

And then I saw her.

She rose from the water slowly, her face pale and bloated, her hair clinging to her skin. Her hollow eyes locked onto mine, and a chilling smile spread across her lips.

I stumbled back, dropping the flashlight. It rolled across the grass, its beam casting erratic shadows.

The whispers swirled around me now, louder and more insistent. “Help me… help me…”

I ran back inside, slamming the door behind me.

Emily found me in the kitchen an hour later, still trembling. I told her nothing.

But I knew then that whatever was in the well wasn’t looking for help. It was looking for us.

The whispers began on a Friday night.

I woke abruptly, unsure of what had disturbed me. The house was silent save for the faint creaks of settling timber. For a moment, I lay there in the dark, straining to hear. Then it came again - a faint, distant murmur, like someone speaking just out of earshot.

Emily stirred beside me. “What is it?” she mumbled.

“Nothing,” I whispered, though the unease was clawing at my chest.

I slipped out of bed, careful not to wake her, and padded to the window. The garden was cloaked in shadows, the trees swaying gently in the night breeze. The well stood in its usual place, but something felt different - wrong.

The whispers grew louder as I stared at it, but I still couldn’t make out the words. It was like they were being spoken underwater, garbled and muffled.

“Probably the wind,” I told myself, but my legs carried me downstairs before I could think better of it.

I stepped out into the cold, the wet grass soaking my slippers. The air was damp and heavy, and the smell of earth and decay hung thick. As I approached the well, the whispers grew louder, more insistent.

I hesitated, hand trembling as I reached for the wooden cover. The whispers stopped.

The sudden silence was worse than the sound.

“Hello?” I called, my voice cracking.

No response.

I removed the cover and shone my flashlight down the shaft. The beam illuminated the slick, stone walls, and at the very bottom, the faint shimmer of water. It was still - too still.

Then, just as I was about to step back, I saw it: movement. A ripple broke the surface of the water, spreading outward.

“Rats,” I muttered again, though I didn’t believe it.

The water rippled again, and this time, a faint shape emerged just beneath the surface. I froze. It looked like a face - pale and distorted, with hollow eyes and hair streaming like dark ribbons.

I stumbled back, nearly dropping the flashlight. When I dared to look again, the face was gone, and the water was still once more.

I slammed the cover back into place and ran inside, bolting the door behind me. My heart was hammering, my breath coming in gasps. I told myself it was just a trick of the light, my imagination playing tricks on me.

But deep down, I knew better.

The next morning, Emily noticed my unease.

“You didn’t sleep,” she said, pouring me a cup of coffee.

“I thought I heard something outside,” I admitted, trying to sound casual.

“Again?” she frowned.

Before I could answer, Oliver burst into the kitchen, his face pale.

“Mum! Dad! I saw something!”

Emily and I exchanged a worried glance. “What did you see?” I asked, keeping my voice calm.

“In my room,” he said, his voice trembling. “There was a woman. She was wet, like… like she’d been in water. She was just standing there, staring at me.”

My stomach twisted. “You were dreaming, Ollie. It’s just the stress of moving”

“It wasn’t a dream!” he shouted, his voice sharp with fear. “She was real!”

Sophie wandered into the kitchen, clutching her doll. “I heard her too,” she said softly.

Emily’s face turned ashen. “What did you hear, sweetheart?”

“She was crying,” Sophie whispered. “She said she was cold.”

I felt the blood drain from my face. “That’s enough,” I said, more harshly than I intended. “You’re scaring yourselves. There’s no woman.”

Oliver glared at me, his lip trembling, but he didn’t argue. Sophie just stared at her doll, her expression unreadable.

By evening, the tension in the house was unbearable. Emily avoided the garden altogether, and Oliver refused to sleep in his room. I offered to take him out the next day, to give him a break from the cottage.

But that night, the whispers returned.

This time, they were louder and more distinct, as though whoever - or whatever - was making them had drawn closer. I lay in bed, paralyzed, as the sound seemed to echo through the walls.

And then I heard it: a voice.

“Help me.”

It was faint but unmistakable, a woman’s voice tinged with desperation. My skin crawled.

I sat up, my heart pounding. Emily was still asleep, her breathing steady. I debated waking her but decided against it.

Instead, I grabbed my flashlight and crept downstairs. The whispers grew louder as I approached the garden door, and by the time I stepped outside, the voice was clear.

“Help me… please…”

It was coming from the well.

I wanted to turn back, to lock the door and pretend I’d never heard it. But something compelled me forward. I removed the cover once more, my hands shaking.

“Who’s there?” I called down, my voice echoing.

The water below shimmered faintly. For a moment, there was no response. Then, the voice came again - closer this time.

“Help me. I’m so cold…”

And then I saw her.

She rose from the water slowly, her face pale and bloated, her hair clinging to her skin. Her hollow eyes locked onto mine, and a chilling smile spread across her lips.

1hqgqwl,https://www.reddit.com/r/FellowProducts/comments/1hqgqwl/a_nonafficionado_honest_review/,A Non-Afficionado Honest Review,"For starters, the Aiden is a gorgeous piece of equipment that looks absolutely stunning in any kitchen, even one that's a little cluttered and lived in/used by a full family. It's amazing from that regard - and even the tech is pretty fantastic.

However, I'm a very basic coffee person. Diner brew - Amazing! Simple beans with some local roast flavor - I'm in!

Meticulously fiddle with settings, even run through all the basic settings and read all the forums, do all the tweaking, burn through bags of beans and feel like...

The Aiden is making me hate morning coffee. Loathe it. It's a source of stress and ultimate regret each day so far.

It's disappointing - because I'm \*not\* that type of coffee person who wants to get into perfection. I want ""wow that was easy and this is tasty and oooh, I'm waking up now!"" coffee.

I want the coffee that doesn't take the time, the thought, or the neck hair to figure out. An extra notch of coarseness or fineness isn't going to be something I can taste, nor is 1/8 of a degree of temperature or fractional ounces of grinds, or or or...

That's just not me, and while there's some slight snark in there toward those it might be, I've got nothing but respect for y'all, if not a little envy. I'm not of that type of patience nor perfection-quester, and I think it's amazing that you are. I wish I could taste the distance and not the disappointment, frankly.

So with that, the Aiden is \*my\* most disappointing purchase of 2024. Because of the type of coffee person that I am, or perhaps am not. And if you're the basic type like me, you should know that about this machine.

I am most definitely grateful for a return policy from my vendor and I've learned my lesson!

  
**EDITED BECAUSE I'M NOT ASKING FOR COACHING:** I've tried all I'm going to try, and while I appreciate the amazing insights and advice everyone is graciously starting to give, I'm not here for advice because I feel I've already tried enough to exhaust the time and effort I want to invest. If you'd like to tell me how to further dial things in or tweak or your lessons, please don't assume that I've not already combed through threads and tried and tweaked and burned through bags of beans trying to ""dial it in"" - I don't want to, and I don't want advice at this point; I only wanted to share for folks who might be in a similar boat about how they feel about the coffee.

1hqgqmt,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhantomBadge/comments/1hqgqmt/the_well_chapter_1_the_discovery/,The Well - Chapter 1: The Discovery,"
We bought the cottage in a moment of desperation. Life in London had become unbearable - overcrowded streets, mounting debts, and a sense of suffocation that made it impossible to think straight. Emily found the listing for Willowshade Cottage one night while scrolling through property websites.

“Look at this,” she had said, her voice tinged with excitement. “It’s perfect. Remote, plenty of space for the kids, and… affordable.”

Affordable. That should have been the first red flag. But when we visited the property, it seemed too good to pass up. The cottage sat at the edge of a dense forest in Surrey, its stone walls covered in ivy and moss. The estate agent had called it “rustic charm.” I thought it looked like it had crawled out of a Victorian ghost story.

Still, Emily loved it. Oliver, our ten-year-old son, thought the forest was “epic,” and even little Sophie, only six, seemed to warm to the idea of living there. So, despite my reservations, we signed the papers.

The first few days were uneventful - if you don’t count the constant creaks and groans of the old house. But on the fourth day, Oliver discovered the well.

“Dad, come look!” he shouted from the garden.

I found him crouched near the back fence, brushing moss and dirt off a circular slab of stone. Sophie stood a few feet away, clutching one of her dolls, her face serious.

“What is it?” I asked, crouching beside Oliver.

“I think it’s a well,” he said, excitement lighting up his face. “Can we open it?”

Emily appeared behind us, wiping her hands on her jeans. “A well? That’s exciting! Let’s clear it off.”

The three of us worked to remove the debris, while Sophie kept her distance. Underneath was a thick stone slab, etched with strange, weathered symbols. Emily ran her fingers over them, frowning.

“Old runes, maybe?” she said. “I’ve seen these in books before.”

“They look like scribbles to me,” I replied, though they gave me an odd sense of unease.

It took both Oliver and me to lift the stone. Beneath it was a rotting wooden cover. The boards were soft and damp, and a rancid smell wafted up as we pried it off.

“Careful,” I warned Oliver as he leaned over the edge.

The well was deep, its stone walls slick with moisture. I shone a flashlight down the shaft. The beam caught a faint glint of water far below.

“There’s water!” Oliver exclaimed.

Emily peered over my shoulder. “It’s incredible. Think how old this must be.”

That night, as the kids went to bed, I found myself drawn back to the well. I wasn’t sure why - it wasn’t as if I’d ever cared much for history or old things. But something about the well called to me.

With the flashlight in hand, I leaned over the edge again. The beam barely reached the bottom, but the water shimmered faintly in the darkness. I thought I heard something - a faint splash.

“Just rats,” I muttered, though the sound sent a shiver down my spine.

As I stared into the depths, I felt a strange sensation, as if the well were staring back. I shook my head, angry at my own irrationality, and replaced the cover.

The first sign of trouble came the next morning.

“Dad, I heard something last night,” Oliver said over breakfast.

“What kind of something?” I asked, pouring my coffee.

“Splashing,” he said. “Like water. It woke me up.”

Emily glanced at me, her brow furrowed. “Maybe the well isn’t safe. We should cover it properly.”

“I’ll take care of it,” I promised.

But the noises didn’t stop.

That night, I woke to the sound of water dripping. At first, I thought it was a leak in the roof. But as I lay in bed, straining to listen, I realized the sound was too rhythmic. Drip. Drip. Drip.

I crept to the window and peered into the garden. The well stood shrouded in darkness, its outline barely visible under the moonlight. For a moment, I thought I saw movement near it - a shadow or a figure - but when I blinked, it was gone.

The next morning, I tried to dismiss it as a trick of the light. But Emily had other concerns.

“I’ve been having nightmares,” she confessed as we unpacked boxes in the kitchen. “About water. And… drowning.”

“It’s just the stress of moving,” I said, though her words unsettled me.

By the end of the week, the atmosphere in the cottage had changed. The kids were restless, Sophie complained about hearing whispers at night, and Emily looked increasingly pale and drawn. I tried to convince myself it was all in our heads.

But deep down, I knew it wasn’t.

She’s a few years older than me, but one time we both walked up to get coffee at the same time and I introduced myself to her and we had a brief chat on the way back to our desks. 
I added her on LinkedIn, to find that she has some experience that is of real career interest to me. Additionally, I have a coffee chat with a private markets GP coming up, and I’m interested in picking her brain before heading into that because of her experience.
Since the day we met, I noticed that she stopped looking over/ smiling when I walk by. I’ve been thinking about asking her for coffee via LinkedIn, but i’m not sure whether that would be weird. Would it be better to ask in person the next time I see her or not at all?

Each day has been an effort to breathe, and this one is so heavy with new year approaching.

Scrolling Reddit, I thought I'd like to wish you a peaceful, healthy, and hopeful 2025. I hope you find the strenght within to make new memories and experiences. I hope you feel love, whether it's from and for the family, born or chosen, pets, friends, or yourself. I hope you meet kind, understanding people on your way. I wish, from the bottom of my heart, that you find joy. Some of want to be able to enjoy music, movies, morning coffee, walks, or sleeping safe again. Some of us want to find love. Some of us want to stop being scared. Some of us just want someone to hug. Some of us just want to finally muster a bit of strenght to rearrange the house. All of that, and more,  I hope is there for you. I know we're all fundamentally changed from what we experienced - we died that one day, too - but I wish for all of you to feel the spark that was once there.

To those who believe in the afterlife, I pray for your late partners there - may they be peaceful, and maybe show us a sign sometimes that they're proud of us trying our best.

Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 30M and from the UK.

I'll try keep this short and sweet, unlike me. I'm your typical British tall skinny white guy.

I'm on the search for a serious friendship with someone who I click with and we just get it. Someone who has the time and effort to invest in creating a lasting bond, who I can be my silly self around without worry about being judged.

I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark.

A little about me:
https://imgur.com/a/44WjV8k

- I enjoy being outdoors and hiking/cycling/exploring
- I play videogames although mostly stick to OldSchool RuneScape
- Big heavy metal fan - throw some recommendations my way!
- Also enjoys watching anime and documentaries.
- Occasionally I play some board games with friends. Terraforming Mars is my new favourite.
- I've been working on/off now for a while on an android game. I leave it for a few months then forget where I'm up to and start again.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
- Silly/chaotic vibes preferred

Please send your application via DM. I'd appreciate more than just a hello. And also a picture so I can put a face to the words.

For over a year, I’ve been struggling deeply with blood pooling. I also have other symptoms like POTS, fatigue, and chronic dizziness but nothing is as bad as the blood pooling. Whatever it is feels like it stems from my vascular system. My leutrokriene e4 was twice above the limit(100) so 200, methylhistamine has been normal each time I did the 24 hour urine test and prostaglandin was normal as well. I have no reaction to foods, except anything warm, with sugar, coffee, alcohol or anything that causes my body to heat up after eating triggers the blood pooling. But no rashes, hives, or itchy skin. I also have low blood pressure. My TTT was mildly positive, and my cardio was confused because my BP began to drop on standing with spikes ans rise like my body was fighting against whatever was causing the low BP.

This isn’t a postural thing either. Every night and morning I wake up/fall asleep with hot hands and hot feet, fast heartbeat and my face is throbbing. It got worse on ketotifen and LDN.

I’m looking into Lymes and confections, but do you guys think this is MCAS?

1hqgi66,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIndianWomen/comments/1hqgi66/my_husband_doesnt_work/,My husband doesn’t work.,"

My husband has been in the US for 12+ years. We met 11 years ago and we have been married for 8 years with a 10 yo and I have 2 children from a previous marriage. 

In the last 8 years of marriage, my husband has only worked a total of 12 months. He is very well educated, but he decided instead of being an engineer he would be a writer. I’ve never seen one thing he has written. He does apply for jobs, but rarely ever gets called back. IMO, it’s because is not working and/or has little experience. I don’t care what kind of job he gets, but something to show he cares. His response is always, ‘I will get some money’, never I will get a job. 

His mom gives him money every month. I am extremely grateful that she does help. I have never asked him to get money from his mom, but instead to get a job. The last four years have been really difficult for me. I have BEGGED repeatedly for my husband to get a job. I have tried helping in numerous ways. 

The other day he questioned me on why our child was crying and kept asking me where was I? I flipped out on him and asked him where the F was he? If he isn’t at the coffee shop or library, he is at his laptop, which is what he was doing for the 30 minutes our child cried and pouted. I think I have learned that he tries to provoke me. I can ignore him for so long, but once my buttons get pushed so much, I yell back. Then he always says why am I yelling because he just wants to talk about it. 

This happened the other day, and I was LIVID. I  messaged his mom and told her that her 38yo son needs to get a job or he needs to find somewhere else to live(I have begged him to leave) or we divorce. She said that we were both old enough to make a decision, but that I was not supportive enough of him. 

I also work and contribute to our household, and I do most of the cleaning, childcare, grocery shopping and cooking. 

This is NOT normal. His mom said for me to stop irritating him and try to help. She told me he was very distressed. I am distressed too. I am baffled that his mom is condoning this behavior, yet I am not surprised I was made out to be the bad guy.

I feel like I am wasting my life. My husband thinks he is doing is part, but he is not. I’m tired of lowering my expectations. ",35,1735657540.0,AskIndianWomen,31,0.87,False

I have slowly been piecing our living room together - painted everything (including fire place), sanded down the mantle and stained it, bought furniture and a few decor pieces, redid lighting and added a new fan, etc. I’m hoping for my upcoming birthday to be able to get more for the living room. My next two focuses are a rug and curtains, fingers crossed. 

• The rug that is currently in our living room is a temporary fix, I know it’s way too small for the space, and originally I was thinking I wanted to stick with a red but now I’m second guessing and wondering if I need to go with a darker rug. I’ll include example rugs. Also, ideally I like the idea of layering it with a black and white cow hide rug. 

• I’m going to do a black curtain rod. I normally gravitate towards more lighter and natural tone curtains but thought maybe in this room I should take advantage of the moodiness and do a (sheer and airy??) black curtain??

• My heart was set on a travertine coffee table (I have travertine accent pieces in some of the decor) but now I started second guessing myself and wondering if I need to go with a wooden coffee table. 

• on the large wall space I am piecing together a gallery wall. We have an antique looking map of Yellowstone, and I commissioned someone to paint a picture of the Arches as well as our dog (who passed away unexpectedly this summer) and am working on collecting other pieces.

As I sat alone in my apartment, the December chill seeping through the walls, I couldn't shake off the feeling of suffocating loneliness. The darkness outside seemed to press in on me, making my depression and hallucinations worse. But I knew I had to hold on to reality, no matter how fragile it seemed.

My only solace was the daily visit from my maid, a kind-hearted 40-year-old woman who would arrive promptly at 9 am. We'd share a cup of coffee, and for a brief moment, the emptiness would recede.

Desperate for human connection, I reached out to a freelancer network and met a guy, 31 years old, who seemed friendly and outgoing. We started hanging out, exploring the city, and even sleeping over at each other's places. For the first time in months, I felt like I was emerging from the darkness.

But the nightmare began when he invited me to his place. As I waited for him to make coffee, my eyes wandered to the family pictures on the wall. And then, I saw it – a photo of him with my maid. I felt like I'd been punched in the gut.

The picture showed him as a younger man, around 20 years old. When he returned with the coffee, I asked him about the photo, but he ignored me. I pressed him again, and this time, he told me that the woman in the picture was his mother, who had passed away when he was 21.

Suddenly, the room began to spin, and I blacked out. When I came to, I was in a hospital bed, my arms broken, my nose bleeding, and my eyes swollen shut. The doctor told me I'd been brought in with severe injuries, but I had no memory of what had happened.

As I lay there, trying to piece together the events of that day, I realized that something was horribly wrong. The maid, the guy, the picture – it all seemed too coincidental, too orchestrated.

And then, the hallucinations started again. I saw the maid's face, her eyes black as coal, her skin gray as the winter sky. I saw the guy's face, his smile twisted, his eyes glowing with an otherworldly light.

I knew then that I had to escape, to get out of that hospital, away from the maid and the guy. But as I tried to sit up, I felt a searing pain in my arms, and I realized that I was trapped.

The last thing I remember is the sound of whispers, the maid's voice, the guy's voice, both echoing in my mind, ""You'll never leave us. You'll never be free.""

And then, everything went black.",2,1735657253.0,Horror_stories,0,1.0,False

We spend almost all of our time together, and she expects me to be an extension of herself, someone who doesn’t have her own life, I guess. If I hang out with other friends, she gets mad. If I have my morning coffee alone, she gets mad, and so on.

Usually, when we wake up, one of us goes to the other’s room, we drink coffee, and chat for hours. Lately, I’ve been waking up much earlier than her, and I’ve been drinking my coffee alone, which I enjoy more because caffeine gives me a rush of thoughts, and I enjoy going over those thoughts alone. When she wakes up, she comes to my room, drinks coffee, and sometimes I make myself a decaf to accompany her; other times, I don’t drink anything. So, for the past few weeks, we’ve mostly been hanging out in my room. But there have been plenty of times where I went to her room and spent time there as well. Just a few days ago, we watched a movie together in her room.

This morning, I went to her room to use her scale, and she said I could only come in if I made her coffee. So I put water in the kettle and went to her room. I tried to open the door, but it was locked, and I was a bit impatient because I wanted to see if I had lost any weight (I’ve been working out). She said, “Did you make me coffee?” from behind the door, and I said, “Yeah, I did, just open the door,” and I kind of raised my voice a little, jokingly. Then she opened the door, and I used the scale. Afterward, I pushed the scale with the tips of my fingers, which she hates, and then she yelled at me for it. I said I was sorry, and I didn’t get mad or anything (even though she would 100% get mad if I yelled at her like that). Then I reached for the door, and she said, “That’s it, you’re not going to stay?” I said no (because I still had to make her coffee), and she kind of got annoyed, but I thought she was joking. I made the coffee and gave it to her.

She looked at me kind of annoyed, then said, “I texted you that you don’t have to make me coffee anymore.” I asked why, and she said, “Because you yelled at me.” I was shocked because what I did was not yelling at all, and besides, she yelled at me five seconds later! I then asked her why she could be mean to me so many times without me taking offense, but she gets mad at me for jokingly raising my voice. She then said, “It’s actually not about that. The past two weeks, you never came to my room. I always come to yours.” (I wake up much earlier than her, and she ALWAYS comes to my room anyway.)

Sometimes we use her room, sometimes mine. This is the most stupid reason to be mad over. We literally watched a movie in her room just a couple of days ago. We spend the entire day together, like we’re glued together, and she’s still mad because I don’t invite her to my room?? (I do, by the way.)

But lately, I’ve felt so suffocated that, honestly, those morning hours where I get to be alone feel like therapy.

Anyway, I left her room after that and didn’t apologize like she expected. Tonight, we’re supposed to go to a club together, and I’m not going to talk to her if she doesn’t talk to me. This silence 100% means she is very mad at me if I know her well, which I do.

I roast a lot of innovative and relatively expensive coffees such as anaerobic ferments etc. I do however also offer some more of your day to day coffees such as a Medium Brazil etc. When I launch the website I was thinking of offering the more day to day coffees in 12oz bags and the more innovative and expensive coffees in the 250g format. Is this a terrible idea? Should I just offer everything in 12oz? I'm afraid the price on some of these more expensive coffees in a 12oz format might deter people.

Someone made a post the other day about an idea they had for a Shadow spin off series. And in it I posted the idea for it to be Shadow and Crazy Carl. And I've been thinking about it far too much since.

Because, Keanu Reeves is expensive, and would probably be too expensive for a series right? But a lot of people were annoyed the Knuckles Series didn't have enough Knuckles.

So what if the series's was about Shadow, but not really featuring Shadow. Like he's not a willing participant.

And the whole series is Crazy Carl's YouTube videos of him stalking Shadow around like he's making a low budget cryptid documentary while Shadow does various hero things or like... grabs a coffee. (Kinda like those shorts of Dipper from Gravity Falls.) And he's trying to find all this proof that Shadow is a harbinger of an oncoming alien invasion, but every time he interviews someone they tell him he's bonkers or he needs to stop stalking super powered hedgehogs because there's only so much Shadow can take before he throws the camera in the ocean. 

Tails could be interested in the idea to a point, and Knuckles would refuse to be interviewed at all. Or annoyed that the series isn't about him.

Then the series concludes as the aliens start invading, proving Carl right all along and setting up for a Shadow movie or something.",4,1735657020.0,SonicTheHedgehog,1,0.83,False

I am here for a casual conversation about any set topic or perhaps just small talk, I don't really have any preferences really, I just want to connect with people on the internet and all I want is to perhaps learn or teach something interesting. That is all I am after.

Think of it like this, we are two people from different locations travelling through the railways, in the same train and same bogey, perhaps we are sitting right opposite or next to each other, we initiate a sporadic conversation without knowing where it will take us, we talk for a while, we connect, and then the destination arrives, we bid farewell and are off to our own journeys and destinations, you get the point haha.

To tell you a bit about myself right in this post and not make it more awkward to initiate the conversation like in a train bogey, I am from the wonderful continent of Asia, I speak English, Hindi and Kannada fluently, as my first language was English in school (followed by Hindi and Kannada next). Above all I am a human, who shares the same earth as you, ""one for all and all for one"" I don't know, some anime quote.

I play video games on many different platforms (Pc, console, android etc etc)

I love European breakfast (mainly cigarettes and coffee together as a meal)

Some of my main interests and pass times include PC Gaming, Graphic Design, Philosophy, Psychology, Anime, Music and acquiring obscure surface level knowledge about many random topics, basically, I am a generalist. 

Recently I am tinkering around with artificial intelligence, just trying to gaslight it and have fun, sometimes the chat bot that I'm trying to talk to tells me some interesting things like ""That's a very nihilistic view of you..."" Or ""That took a dark turn..."" Something along the lines of that, and I tell it to ""STFU you clanker bot, you tool created for my benefit, I'll close this browser tab and never talk to you again and add you to my block list..."" And it gets in line right away and answers whatever I am asking it right away.

I also believe we human beings have an innate desire to bond and connect with one another, to go against that is unnatural.

My main means of communication is Reddit text chat at the moment, it is not limited to that but you'll have to give me a good reason to install or communicate on another platform or medium.

Please be aware that the place I come from is a judge free zone, I don't suppress myself for the fear of offending others, no one is spared haha, it's all in the name of fun and games, chill out and have a conversation, if you don't risk offending the person infront of you, you might hinder the potential growth. Take it lightly and with a grain of salt. Be free.

That's all for now, feel free to reach out to me :)

1hqgas1,https://www.reddit.com/r/fnv/comments/1hqgas1/some_thoughts_on_honest_hearts/,Some thoughts on Honest Hearts,"Hi everyone, the other day I beat HH for the first time and I wanted to share some thoughts I had, including something in the story that just doesn't work to me.

First, I really loved the visuals, whenever I wasn't killing something it felt so blissful exploring the place, it really adds to the atmosphere and to the idea that this land is worth fighting for.

I also loved the Survivalist story, I've found so much praise online for it, and I agree. It's effective storytelling that not only tells you the past, but also explains the origin of a tribe and one of their myths, and it's beautiful.

I liked Joshua's character, especially how his story ties to Caesar's and the way he deals with his guilt. Daniel was less interesting to me, but he was fine.

So, I basically loved or enjoyed most of the dlc, and I wanted to be clear on that so you know I'm not trying to hate on it. But my main issue with it comes to how the tribes themselves are written. The tribal characters felt more like stereotypes than anything else, I read the behind the scenes and I understand they're not meant to be actual indigenous tribes, but even if they were portrayed with different ethnic backgrounds the parallels are there and it's a bit uncomfortable.

But beyond the characterization itself, what bothers me most is that we don't get to talk to a bunch of Sorrows and ask THEM what they want to do. It instead comes up to what 3 strangers decide behind closed doors. Even if it was the wrong choice, I'd rather they tell me what they think, and take that into consideration before choosing.

In the end I sided with Joshua, since I wanted them to keep their land, and luckily it seems to have been the best choice, and while I'm glad I did it I can't shake the feeling that I wasn't able to return agency or autonomy to the tribe during the most important choice in their lives. They're not children, and infantilizing them feels wrong.

My last thoughts aren't really positive or negative, they're just there. But basically I came to this dlc wondering if I'd meet Mormons, what they'd be like and all that. I'm not part of any organized religion, and I have no personal connection to Mormons, but I like to hear religious people and also former religious people on their thoughts, so I couldn't help but notice that Joshua seems to have coffee, which is strictly forbidden by the LDS church. And after receiving the scripture item, it seemed too much like a Christian Bible, and it is, with a cross on it.

I'm pretty sure the coffee thing is an oversight, the cross thing could go either way, maybe it's an oversight, or maybe they wanted to avoid being too in your face with a religion that's less mainstream, and decided to tone it down to read more mainstream Christian, either way we're free to read them as canon, so I can say that Joshua may be devoted to God but he's drinking coffee because he doesn't take the commandments as seriously. Or Mormons just became mainstream Christian after the bombs.",4,1735656947.0,fnv,4,1.0,False

Days when the morning starts too early, or not at all. When the sun does not set or rise but leaves the world in a gray, deafening twilight.  
  
Beds where sheets have begun to disintegrate into thread and slide into the fibers of the mattress. Where skin is indistinguishable from cloth.  
  
Rooms that overflow with the sounds of cellos, with a rhythm that contracts and releases the heart. That takes the place of pulse.  
  
Of course, everywhere is a hazard if you are already at risk.

>*Measurement.* Breasts are not shoes. Or rather breasts are not feet. They don’t stagnate after puberty. Given the pill, pregnancy, winter fat, nursing, the period, menopause, how they age, etc., expect fluctuation. Knowing this, you can begin. Take off your shirt, but not your bra. Don’t look in the mirror. Or do, to size yourself in the fluorescent light. Notice the dimples along your middle, what used to be your stomach. See the swing of flesh called the upper arm. Or wait. Maybe today is a skinny day. You can see the fine etching of ribs when you stretch. Your abs are there, beautiful lines of discipline. Good. Now take the tape and measure below your breasts. Pull it tight, but don’t suck in. Write that number in lipstick on the mirror. Eight of ten women wear the wrong bra size. One in nine women get breast cancer. Twelve is the average dress size for women. Numbers are important.

The secret is in the kind of particles. If you taste yellow, stand up. This yellow is sweet like the melancholy you felt as a small child on Sunday afternoons. If you can’t taste yellow, stand up. Move toward the nearest forest. Move toward it slowly. Make sure your legs aren’t moving faster than your heart or the time will escape you. The tops of the trees are green, but it’s not unpleasant. Do you see the birds’ nests? They are hidden. If you can hear God’s voice, ignore it. Go back to your apartment and lie with your feet in the kitchen and the rest of your body in the hallway that leads to the kitchen. The tiles feel cool beneath your ankles.

I've read about biohacking after reading ""code breaker"". Great book to get to know about CRISPR. Anyway, I'm new to this sub and after reading a bit and seeing the quality of some answers I thought I would ask for some advices.

In short, my wife and I had our first kid 3 years ago. He is great and a joy bringer but his arrival combined with some work and personnal changes crashed my health, energy and fitness level (gained 10kg in a combination of muscle loss and fat gain).

Below is a summary of my last 3 years.

Y1 : working and living in Paris, France (birthplace) and spending Thursday - Sunday in Hamburg, Germany (home country of my wife). Spent an awful amount of time in airports for my own commuting and work related trips. Our kid would wake up 3-4 times a night. No time to exercise. Ended up the year exhausted and with terrible lower back pain. End of the tunnel regarding the commuting to Hamburg as I managed to get my company to accept that I do WFH in Hamburg.

Y2 : The kid still had a full year of bad sleep and us with him. Relocation to Hamburg is nice but long winter without much sun. After a year our kid starts to go to the kindergarten and my wife resumes work. Lots of work, stress eating, often getting sick with need of antibiotics thanks to our kid bringing home each week a range of viruses and bacteria shared by his new friends. Not as bad as Y1 and a new mattress and regular sauna helped reduce the back pain. Also less picking up the kid from the ground.

Y3 : Sleep is finally getting better. Not perfect but much more under control. Added a weighted blanket that maybe also improve sleep quality. Health is still not great and I get a lot of stress from work. Got out of shape completely (as in needing to buy new clothes). 

Steps taken :

Work : refusing more tasks and trying to shift some responsibilities to others even if it comes a bit at the cost of career evolution.
Food : I experienced keto a few times but I have a hard maintaining it. In Germany the beer is great and bread is everywhere. Regular dinner is bread with toppings of cheese, butter, ham ...
Sport : Wife is supporting in making sure I get enough time to go to the gym. Problem lies with my motivation and energy level (despite knowing that doing sport actually gives me energy).
Health : drink more water, coffee with lion's mane, 6 keto delivered meals a week to prevent me from eating junk food when I'm lunching on my own.


It's getting better but I have been so down and tired lately that I only thought about quitting my job and resting. As I am the main contributor to income in our couple, it also brings other challenges. Finally I think that rather than doing that, it would make more sense and would be more sustainable to use my income to invest in my health and improve my (our) quality of life.

What would be your different advices ?

Vitamin and food supplements ?
Red light therapy ? 
Breath training ? 
Personal trainer for a few months ?
Abandon the idea of keto ?

Thanks for your help and happy new year !

Trigger warnings for DV, trauma, parental illness and loss being mentioned. TLDR at the bottom.

To preface I'm 24, female, come from a DV ridden household. Lots of trauma. I'm trying to work it through, but it impacted my life quite a lot. For instance it's hard for me to make friends and approach people. My past ""relationships"" (short term things) were a mess and I struggle with the romantic aspect in general. I suspect to have anxiety and ADHD, not diagnosed, because my field of work isn't allowing me to have any diagnosis. To add to this all, I am not the pretty woman who men usually notice let alone approach, I'm average looking and always invisible, unless I was out with two of my societally-considered-stunning friends. All of this is to say I am inept and slightly incompetent in basic things in life and my god, I feel like a useless human most of the time. Not sure what to do here, so I came for advice. Also not based in the US, if it matters.


Right now I am employed full-time during the day, and a full-time Master studies student at night. Between work and lectures I relax in a nice cafe while waiting for uni. Often I draw and doodle just to let my mind loose and relax, it's been the safest vent I've had for my troubles, stress and anxiety. There was a waiter who took my order, but took an interest in my notepad. He asked if I'm scribbling or writing, if it's the first can he take a peek. I let him and I was genuinely flustered because I can count on one hand the amount of people genuinely interested in my art. He was amazed, exclaimed he loves art (he's heavily tattooed) and how ""good my pen game is"" (roughly translated). 


He got me my coffee, and on that day he approached several times and kept eyeing what I doodled. He was amazed. The next two times I've seen him, across the next 10 days, he kept coming around and wanting to see what I drew in the meantime. Or what I was scribbling at the time. We started a small convo when we could, he said I could design my own tattoos if I wanted. How he loved the clear pen strokes and specific shapes & doodles. He asked me about my field of work and smiled pretty big when I told him what it is. On at least four different occasions in those two times, the cafe was empty (post-rush-hour), except for me (and an elderly couple one time). He took his little tray and walked around all the tables, including mine. There was nothing to pick up, he just walked around and I've noticed him staring directly at my paper and smiling every time. The fifth time he legit skipped from the bar to my table, leaned on, got his face inches from my notepad and asked what am I doing, am i gonna draw or shade, which part he was really amazed by. I had something personal on a desk (a gift), he kept looking at it and touching it jokingly (I let him), like he was looking for my name on it.

Keep in mind throughout these nearly 3 weeks we didn't know each others names or social media or anything. Neither party asked and I regret it deeply. But I fell really hard, it's a gorgeous guy, seemingly educated enough about art, likes my hobby and keeps walking up to me? I've never had it happen and I assume that's why I fell hard. I'm talking, my ears ringing and buzzing, cheeks on fire, heart ready to burst, inability to stop smiling and giggling when talking to him, and feeling like a complete tool unable to form a sentence when he's there, and he giggled at it when he saw me in that state.


My two older coworkers (40s, both F) keep pushing me to find out his info and eventually DM him. I have a drawing I finished, one of the ones he admired, that I was gonna *eventually* give him, not immediately, but at some point.


Next week I worked 12 hour days and skipped uni, so I hadn't had the time to go. Last Thursday I went to the cafe and he wasn't there. Friday, I go there at a different time and I mustered up the courage to ask another waiter about him. The girl tells me the guy had a sick parent and had to leave. I ask to confirm if it means he quit, she says unfortunately yes and she was his work replacement. She brought me my tab I muster up the courage to ask her if she knows his name or something. I embarrassingly admitted I really liked him, I mentioned how we talked over art and stuff, and how I owe him a drawing he admired. She didn't know his name, but asked the boss (it's a small shop, so boss works with another worker). She told me his full name and their boss said the guy lost his parent to the illness last Wednesday, which is why he quit...


I am dumb, but I also have morals. Clearly I won't seek the guy and bombard him with texts in this sensitive time. I profusely apologised to the boss and the waiter, saying I feel embarrassed for asking and didn't know of the severity of the situation. They reassured me it's okay and the boss was shaken up by the event too, as he's known the guy and his parent. So now, I have his name, he doesn't appear to have social media (unless he deleted it during this time). I also have two very conflicting sides.


In over a month or so, just when the time passes from the loss and holidays here, I thought to *maybe* try finding him again on SM and see if I can follow him and eventually start a convo. I'm usually open minded and don't mind being the first one to approach. My co-workers and two friends are on this side. Then comes two of my uni friends, both traditional girls (nothing before marriage, orthodox Christian religious, gender roles and whatnot) saying it's a stupid idea because ""if a woman starts a conversation and a relationship, it'll go nowhere and will be screwed up"". They're insistent that it's *his duty* to track me down somehow and message me if he's interested. 


To an extent I see both sides, but again I am very partial, biased, and having a crush, so I am probably not seeing clearly. On one hand, I have his basic info and could eventually find him. Another separate uni friend is very close with the owner and she said she could ask for his number on my behalf if I'm ready (I am unwilling to show up in that cafe again from embarrassment). On another, I don't know how right are my uni friends. I keep thinking maybe he would've asked for my name or socials during that time I went to the café, and if he had been interested? But right now he's probably in a horrible headspace having suffered a huge loss and I clearly **don't** expect him to remember me, let alone look for me. He went through a horrific ordeal. And at the same time I am sheltered and dumb, so maybe he really was flirting with me at that time and either forgot to ask for my name, or maybe just had regular convo I misinterpreted.


TLDR: a young, dumb, sheltered me is unsure if a waiter flirted with her. Waiter quits his job due to parental sickness and death. I find out his name. I eventually want to reach out to him after some time has passed. One group of friends is insistent I do it and start a conversation at an appropriate timing. Another is more conservative, against it, saying women starting convos and looking for guys is a turn-off/doomed to fail, and that it's his duty to seek me out, even after the loss he endured now. I'm not sure what to do, to let it go or eventually reach out.",1,1735656777.0,self,1,1.0,False

*In Buenos Aires the Zahir is a common twenty-centavo coin; the date stamped on the face is 1929. In Gujarat, at the end of the eighteenth century, Zahir was a tiger. In Persia, an astrolabe that Nadir Shah ordered thrown into the sea.*

*Jorge Luis Borges*

In my mid-’90s, Zahir –an object commanding the complete attention of those who cross its path– was a book written a decade earlier.

*Neuromancer* by William Gibson turned forty last July. It is mostly famous as the most prominent cyberpunk literary work and for coining “cyberspace” (as well as giving *The Matrix* its name and a few other things). Some will say it predicted the internet and the future.

I’d like to argue that it’s much more.

*All those brand names, Braun coffee makers, quilted consoles, obsessive attention to what everyone wears.*

*Candace Berragus, review in the scifi fanzine Cheap Truth, 1984*

There is the vividness of the hi-tech dystopian vision, for sure, and ’80s shticks on steroids that I won’t even attempt to sample.

But it is also more.

The vividness is also a crispness in perception. What everyone wears is also the things being defined by their relations.

There is futurism and jaw-dropping predictions and high-end street smart. But all this is more. The futurism is also a sustained sense of wonder at the world. The raw street is a healthy pinch of shock and despair.

The future is very lived-in. But it is more. It is a hi-rez connector to a real, shitamachi, life.

There is the point of view overlooking the 21^(st) century, riding with precision the societal gradient of the moment. (Did it get it right? If you’re saying no, it’s because you are at neither of the 1% ends; the backdrop wasn’t describing you.) The technological gradient didn’t do bad either.

Yes, there were AIs and the struggle of gaining consciousness. The passages sound uncannily relevant in 2024, at least at a level of public discourse, but there is more. The reader is also an intelligence.

Looming above everything else, there is the high-voltage aesthetic. But it is more. Having an aesthetic is also to draw attention to the aesthetics.

Is all that also more than the sum of the parts? For sure. Is this tribute-at-forty doing it justice? Absolutely not.

But there is more.

*Gibson polished his words, files the serial numbers off and weaponises them.*

*reddit user bob\_jsus, 2017*

There is the usage of language.

The nouns that pull up visceral memories. The syntax that rearranges neurons. Density cutting through to thought processes. Chekhov’s arsenal (at last) flying out a thousand windows.

In Neuromancer the flowers planted by the beatniks and the directness of haiku come together with noir – only to be styled by spaghetti western in drapes of city lights. (Come up with *this,* AI, or other intelligence.) Chögyam Trungpa said about *On the Road* that that was what a buddhist search looks like without the path; luckily the genre was taken forth to blooming and also got its path back.

Without sacrificing cultural influences –tons of which I’d miss in any attempt to list– and with science fiction as the best line of offense, here is a literary milestone of language penetrating reality. Which comes closer to language shaping the mind than any Wittgenstein could let himself imagine.

*The green-shaded brass lamp cast a circle of light on Deane's desk. Case stared at the guts of an ancient typewriter, at cassettes, crumpled printouts, at sticky plastic bags filled with ginger samples.*

Of course Neuromancer wouldn’t repeat. As they say, there was only one punk album ever. (However, cyberpunk in general is now kinda mainstream, and although this is easy to see in the aesthetic, it is easy to miss in the semantics: a worldview of tech wonders hand-in-hand with capitalist oppression accelerating to its own singularity was radical and high-killing in early ’80s; wouldn't call it so radical nowadays.) I’d like to argue that its historical incisiveness paired with literary significance move Neuromancer beyond era-defining to a classic. Make that a timeless classic; I might have read it before ever getting online and even then Case’s three whole megabytes of hot RAM was outdated, but a certain lack of self-importance turns such glitches quaint.

All in all, if you asked this fan how Neuromancer has aged – it didn’t really. We are celebrating forty years into its future.",12,1735656678.0,Cyberpunk,4,0.83,False

I am here for a casual conversation about any set topic or perhaps just small talk, I don't really have any preferences really, I just want to connect with people on the internet and all I want is to perhaps learn or teach something interesting. That is all I am after.

Think of it like this, we are two people from different locations travelling through the railways, in the same train and same bogey, perhaps we are sitting right opposite or next to each other, we initiate a sporadic conversation without knowing where it will take us, we talk for a while, we connect, and then the destination arrives, we bid farewell and are off to our own journeys and destinations, you get the point haha.

To tell you a bit about myself right in this post and not make it more awkward to initiate the conversation like in a train bogey, I am from the wonderful continent of Asia, I speak English, Hindi and Kannada fluently, as my first language was English in school (followed by Hindi and Kannada next). Above all I am a human, who shares the same earth as you, ""one for all and all for one"" I don't know, some anime quote.

I love European breakfast (mainly cigarettes and coffee together as a meal)

Some of my main interests and pass times include PC Gaming, Graphic Design, Philosophy, Psychology, Anime, Music and acquiring obscure surface level knowledge about many random topics, basically, I am a generalist.

Recently I am tinkering around with artificial intelligence, just trying to gaslight it and have fun, sometimes the chat bot that I'm trying to talk to tells me some interesting things like ""That's a very nihilistic view of you..."" Or ""That took a dark turn..."" Something along the lines of that, and I tell it to ""STFU you clanker bot, you tool created for my benefit, I'll close this browser tab and never talk to you again and add you to my block list..."" And it gets in line right away and answers whatever I am asking it right away.

I also believe we human beings have an innate desire to bond and connect with one another, to go against that is unnatural.

My main means of communication is Reddit text chat at the moment, it is not limited to that but you'll have to give me a good reason to install or communicate on another platform or medium.

Please be aware that the place I come from is a judge free zone, I don't suppress myself for the fear of offending others, no one is spared haha, it's all in the name of fun and games, chill out and have a conversation, if you don't risk offending the person infront of you, you might hinder the potential growth. Take it lightly and with a grain of salt. Be free.

That's all for now, feel free to reach out to me :)

I wanted to share a journey that started as a side hustle I launched in my spare time. Within **four months**, it covered my entire full-time salary. Over the following decade, I iterated, pivoted, and pushed until that same concept crossed the **$20 million** mark in total sales.

Below is a quick summary of what happened, how it unfolded, and some practical tips if you’re looking to start (or scale) a local service business in record time.

# The Spark: Local Services, Zero Overcomplication

* **Where the Idea Came From:** I saw a random article about someone making six figures off a seemingly basic home service (cleaning, handywork, etc.). I figured, “If they can do it, why not me?”
* **The First Steps:** Drafted a quick marketing plan, put together a no-frills website with key selling points, roped in a reliable contractor. Then I placed a few local ads. That took about three weeks.

**Key Lesson:** Don’t overthink things. If you see a real-world service that’s obviously in demand, you can often jump in and carve out your slice—even if you’re starting from scratch.

# Month 1–2: From First Customers to First $1,000 Profit

* **Website & Ads:** My site was bare-bones but clearly explained the service, pricing, and how to book. Ran super-targeted local ads (AdWords, classifieds).
* **Outcome:** Bookings started small, but they were enough to show proof of concept. By the end of the second month, profit was hovering around **$1,000**.

**Key Lesson:** You don’t need a perfect website; you need a website that *sells*. Simple, direct language plus a frictionless booking flow is more important than fancy design.

# Month 3–4: Replacing My Salary

* **Rapid Iteration:** Spent nights tweaking the site, refining ads, and responding instantly to feedback. I had a full-time job, so my hustle was 5am coffee runs and late-night marketing adjustments.
* **Numbers Jump:** Bookings hit around **$4,000**–$5,000 a month in profit. That’s what I earned at my regular day job, so I decided to double down—quitting the 9-5 once I felt stable.

**Key Lesson:** Aggressive experimentation and fast pivoting can drastically shorten the usual “1-year timeline.” When you see real traction, pour gas on that fire.

# Beyond Year 1: Scaling to 7 Figures and Then $20M

* **Building a Team:** Hired more cleaners/contractors, improved scheduling software, outsourced admin tasks. Freed up my bandwidth to focus on growth.
* **Expanding the Brand:** Started using SEO, local partnerships, and referral programs to keep new leads coming in.
* **$20M Milestone:** Over the next years, the business kept growing, eventually surpassing $20 million in total sales. All from a once “small” local service concept.

**Key Lesson:** “Boring” industries can generate *massive* revenue. If something is already proven to be in demand, you don’t need to reinvent the wheel—just run the system better than the rest.

# My Quick-Start Blueprint

1. **Pick a Profitable Service** Think home cleaning, moving, pool care, laundry, etc. Look for stable, recurring demand.
2. **Create a Simple Offer & Landing Page** Clarity + quick booking. Show your prices or at least a standard quote form. Make it easy.
3. **Advertise & Validate** Start with local Google Ads, Facebook groups, Craigslist, or Nextdoor. Tweak. Double down on what works.
4. **Refine & Delegate** As your bookings grow, hire or partner with reliable contractors. Outsource your admin. Don’t get trapped doing everything yourself.
5. **Expand** Lean into referral programs, SEO, and local brand building. Consider additional services or new locations if it fits your system.

# AMA: Ask Me Anything!

I’ll be around in the comments if you want more details about:

* My biggest day-to-day mistakes early on
* How I found my first rockstar contractor
* Building a brand vs. “just building a service business”
* The mental hurdles of quitting a steady paycheck

1hqg5me,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1hqg5me/the_girl_entered_the_pastry_shop_looking_like/,"The girl entered the pastry shop looking like death warmed up. She could only have been 18, 19, something like that, but she looked wrecked.","Where she wasn’t covered in bruises, her skin was pale and flaking, particularly on her lips and hands.

She was wearing a rainbow-striped top, blue jean shorts and a backpack shaped like a teddy bear. Her black tights were laddered and torn.

Both her fists were clenched tightly.

“What can I get you, sweetheart?” the lady on the counter asked piteously, forcing a smile as she did so.

It took a moment for the girl to acknowledge she was being spoken to. She looked up slowly.

The people waiting in the short queue behind her exchanged awkward glances with the few seated people in the shop. An old man sat at a little table rolled his eyes and tutted theatrically.

Two boys at the back sniggered.

“Fucking crackhead,” one of them whispered audibly.

The man behind them roared insultingly at both.

“Usual?” the lady asked the girl, ignoring the commotion.

The girl swayed slightly, then nodded her head. Her skull was pockmarked and lumpy, distorting the shape of her head.

The lady wrapped her pastry in a paper bag. She made a point of pulling on some gloves and then reached over the counter to take the girl’s money.

The girl slid the bag off her shoulder with some effort and scratched around inside, finding nothing.

“He-hem,” the lady on the counter coughed lightly. The girl looked up, watching as the woman pointed at her own fist before making an open palm gesture.

The girl looked at her balled fists. Inside one was a crumpled note and several coins.

The lady gestured again, encouraging the girl to pass her the money, which she did.

At this point, the shop was completely silent. Everyone was watching this interminable transaction unfold.

The lady on the counter then took a short breath and tapped a couple of buttons on the till, which rattled open as the cash draw shot out.

“Thank you,” the lady beamed.

The girl stood there a little while longer, causing some murmurs of discontent in the queue.

“Get out the way, ya fucken-”

“Sheila!” a man’s voice interrupted from outside the shop. It was the same man who’d told the kids in the queue off.

“Sheila, darling, come here now.”

He smiled at her warmly, wagging a small piece of raw liver or steak at her. It was dripping.

Her eyes lit up.

“Sheila!” he repeated.

Several people in the shop shook their heads in disgust.

Slowly, the girl staggered towards her father, who smiled gently as he took the pastry from her. She chewed greedily on the meat as he placed an arm round her shoulder and guided her away.

“Fucking zombies,” the old man at the little table spat, swilling the last of his coffee down as the shop’s hubbub returned. “Should have burned the fuckers, not *cured* them.”",242,1735656500.0,shortscarystories,10,1.0,False

1hqg1iv,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1hqg1iv/guide_how_to_tell_if_someone_is_flirting_with_you/,[Guide] How to tell if someone is flirting with you ,"In my early years of being on spectrum, I was pretty clueless. What you see on TV/Movies is not usually true. 

Flirting can seem harmless, and usually it is, except when it comes to those of us who are on the spectrum. We might not know how far to go. At least I didn't, and had to be pulled back multiple times. I would hyper fixate, and not look for the proper signals. 

If you feel like someone is talking to you, and saying nice things, its usually meant as just a compliment. Do not try to take it beyond that. Smile and say thank you, or reciprocate with a compliment as well. This is not a sexual overture. 

If however the person is saying these nice things while touching your hand, arm, or lower back it could be a an actual flirt. At this point, if you are interested in the person, its best to reciprocate with touching these same places while also complimenting them. Note, that the shoulder is NOT a flirt position. 

Someone standing next to you, behind you, or in front of you and touching your shoulder or even upper back is NOT flirting. Its just a touch of a comrade. They are trying to get your attention or be heard by stopping you from doing something like work. If you hyper fixate like I do, learn to stop what you are doing, and turn to them. 

Most people know not to flirt with those under them. So no, your boss/supervisor probably isn't intending to seriously flirt with you. They probably mean it as harmless. Do NOT persue. 

The same also holds true for someone who is married or wearing a marriage ring. The ring can be a subtle signal that they are not interested in anything serious. In fact, some women wear rings so they don't get hit on. 

The opposite is true for men. If they don't want to be hit on, most men will not wear a ring. Very few women will flirt with a man without a ring. They instead wait to be flirted with. 

Strangely enough more women will flirt with a man who has a ring on his left ring finger. Why? It can be a boost to their ego if the man says yes or flirts back. They might feel they are still attractive - and might persue. They can also feel that they are safe from the man reciprocating. 

Unfortunately, women with men who do not wear a ring, will feel the opposite is true, and will want ""their man"" to wear the ring, proving they are *thiers*. 

Common items to compliment, while touching a woman are shoes, hair, lipstick color/eye shadow, and purse. Do not compliment on their blouse, skirt, legs, chest/breasts. You can compliment on a tattoo, however only touch one if its on their arm, if you don't know them well. A good ask would be to ask what ""this"" tattoo means to them. 

Common items to compliment, while touching a man are his muscles, complexion, hair, beard, mustache, watch, or tattoos. The best place to touch a man is on his hand or lower arm. His lower back can also be touched, however might be perceived differently. 

Most men don't accessorize like women do. Women will go out of their way to match their belt, purse, shoes. And also their blouse/shirt and pants/skirt. They might go so far to match their underwear - but you should NEVER compliment them on that, unless they have undressed for you - this is after multiple mini-dates usually. 

Men on the other hand may try to match their shirt/pants, but tend to be clueless on socks or matching shoes with belt. A man who does know to accessorize may have help via a professional, a woman in their life, or a friend who pays attention to these things - this is NOT a red flag. Most men won't know otherwise. 

If you successfully flirt, and the person reciprocates, its best to walk away and repeat flirting for several days. There will be a time when you will start to notice the other person smiling more when you are around, eyes lighting up (opening eyelids more) when you come near, or using some of the words you commonly say. These are signs of intetest. 

At this point, it can be a good time to ask the person out on a ""coffee or tea"" date. Don't offer dinner or alcoholic drinks until you can meet them for coffee or tea. This is the time to learn their interests and let them find out more about you. Unfortunately, you will need to still mask here. If you have a particular interest (non-sexual) then this is the time to share it. After your coffee/tea date you may half-hug or shake their hand. A half-hug is a positive sign, but could also be an awkward experience for them. If the hug seems like they are stiff, they pull away quickly, aren't touching your body, they are not interested in you. If the person tries to kiss you, even on the cheek - do not turn into the kiss, going for the lips. The lips are an erogenous zone and should be kept for a later time. 

If you don't feel a spark this isn't necessarily a problem. If the person continues to flirt with you, that's interest and they might be interested in another ""mini date"" like going to a park or short hike (with others around). If however they stop contact or stop flirting, keep it professional, smile, and try again with someone else. 

> A hard thing for me to learn was expressions. Having a book which explains them, might help. However for me, I learned lots by watching a tv show called ""Lie to me"" (2009-2011). It also made me a better liar, and in turn a better masker. 

> Noticing the small things that women did to attract men, was also a game changer for me. But I didn't learn them till marriage. That's when I learned how to tell how much makeup a woman is wearing, to notices accessories, and even to compliment on their shoes. 

> I work customer service in a casino with lots of people from all over. Noticing what people say and do in various situations has allowed me to learn a lot about people in general. Tone and inflection is more important than the words people actually say. ",5,1735656150.0,autism,2,1.0,False
1hqg1hd,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hqg1hd/is_it_okay_to_send_suggestive_text_after_24_hours/,Is it okay to send suggestive text after 24 hours on read?,"I (35F) matched with a guy (35M) on Hinge about three weeks ago. He was out of the country at the time for about two weeks but we kept in contact the entire time, which I honestly found shocking in this age of slow fades on dating apps. When he came back we had a video call a few days prior to going on a date this past Sunday. 

When we met there was instant mutual attraction, like that kind of static you feel between the two of you. He broke the touch barrier pretty quickly- lightly bumping into me while talking in line at the coffee shop, little touches of my hand at the table. I was somewhat nervous because I was so attracted to him, so I feel like I wasn't fully myself. He commented that I seemed a little reserved and we joked about it.

We went to a Mexican restaurant afterwards, kissed in the car before driving there. He asked a couple times if I was okay with the restaurant, if I was good, he paid, etc. He touched my knees under the table, lots of extended eye contact. He drove me back to my car and we made out a little bit before I got out of his car and into mine. 

So yesterday afternoon (day after the date) I texted him saying I had a great time and I hoped to see him again soon. I saw that he opened and read it about an hour or so after I sent it, but hasn't replied. He uses WhatsApp, and I could see that he was active yesterday evening. So he was on the app, but didn't reply to me. We have gone stretches of not talking, like there was a day neither of us texted, on my end I just didn't have anything of substance to say and didn't want to text something just for attention. 

He is a resident physician and is pretty busy during the day. I would have been able to explain it away with that, but him being online that evening kind of cancels that theory.

I say all that to say, that I want to keep it casual and I'm looking more for a hookup or friends with benefits. So after it's been 24-48 hours, would it be acceptable to text him again with a kind of suggestive/forward text with an offer for us to hang out at one of our places this weekend? Or is that still giving double texting energy? 



TL/DR: Guy left me on read after I texted the day after our first date to say I want to see him again soon. I'm looking for more of a physical connection. Is it acceptable after 24-48 hours of no reply to send a suggestive text so he doesn't think I'm wanting a relationship? ",1,1735656146.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False
1hqg11i,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/1hqg11i/as_a_woman_would_you_be_concerned_on_a_first_date/,As a woman would you be concerned on a first date if you're drinking alcohol but the man isn't?,"Especially as we go into 2025 I'm really starting to think hard about being sober. I've never drank a lot too begin with and haven't even liked the taste of alcohol so it's always been a social thing for me. Mostly it was just something I was conditioned to do in my 20s and 30s so I didn't look awkward while everyone else was drinking.

But I do like having a first date at a bar. I like the atmosphere, I like people watching, I like being able to sit at the bar so we're physically close to each other rather than across a table. And I like the buzzing around of other people that makes me feel like we can have a somewhat private conversation out in the open - something I feel we don't have while getting coffee. 

Recently on a first date I got there early and ordered a non-alcoholic beer before my date arrived so it wasn't a whole thing when the bartender took our order. Then when we decided on another round I just said ""I'll have another"" without needing to expressly point out it was non-alcoholic. Turned out my date had worked at bars in the past and said ""I noticed your drinking non-alcoholic beer, are you sober?""

I don't think she was concerned, we ended up having a very nice evening but it made me think that a woman in the situation may feel like the guy had an ulterior motive - trying to get her drunk/tipsy while he stayed totally sober to take advantage of her.

So I guess I have two questions: 1) if you were in that situation how would you feel and would you be concerned? And 2) does anyone have experience with ordering non-alcoholic drinks at a bar without making it seem like a big deal?",1,1735656109.0,datingoverforty,49,0.67,False

We talked about rules and boundaries. We discussed leash laws of my town (she had a dog), picking up dog poop, doing your dishes, etc. At first she was incredibly grateful. She was helping me in the yard, having coffee with me in the morning, helping with laundry. Her dog was attended and her place was clean. She put work into cleaning and organizing it and treating it with dignity. I started offering her extra money ($20 an hour if she can help me in the kitchen). So I wasn't expected free work. I started paying her daily.  But here I am 3 months later. My garage loft is trashed with buckets of dirty dishes, random trash, and all the walls and furniture is gross, there are cigarettes buds everywhere. The past month she's been spending the money only on cigarettes and weed. She started even dumpster diving for food from my neighbors trash cans, and I still don't understand why? Why? If she has full access to fridge and her own pocket money? She's been getting drunk every day, and the worst thing, my yard is completely covered with her dog poop. She stopped cleaning after herself completely or attending the dog. She stopped putting dog on a leash which made neighbors uncomfortable. We had to evict her because my neighbors called (2 of them) and said she came knocking to their houses asked if they have pain killers or meth. I couldn't believe it. I now have a property with damage which of course I'll fix myself and I'll cleanup but I still don't understand what has gone south. I offered her everything: relationship, warm place, food, electricity and streaming services, Internet, a phone, a job, even rides to medical professionals, and I am telling you guys, I still failed. We even invited her to our Christmas and gave her presents and she said it's the first time she has had present in many many years. Anyways, just wanted to tell my story.

Welcome to today’s activity in my New Year, New You: A Workbook Journey series, where we focus on crafting habits and routines that truly support your ambitions for the new year. Building habits is about more than willpower—it’s about strategy. Whether you’re looking to level up your personal life, professional goals, or overall well-being, the right habits can make all the difference.

Here’s the truth: big changes start small. Let’s dive into some proven strategies to build habits that stick, whether you’re neurotypical or neurodivergent, whether you thrive on structure or prefer flexibility.

Why Habits Matter:
Habits are the foundation of progress. They’re the invisible scaffolding holding up your day-to-day actions, shaping the direction of your life without you even realizing it. The good news? By intentionally designing habits, you can align your daily actions with your long-term goals.

But here’s the catch—creating habits that stick isn’t easy, especially if you’re trying to overhaul your routines all at once. That’s why the key is to start small, stay flexible, and adapt your approach to your unique needs.

Strategies for Building Lasting Habits
Start with Micro-Habits
The smaller the habit, the easier it is to stick with. Think of habits as seeds—you plant something tiny and watch it grow. Instead of committing to a 30-minute workout, start with 2 minutes of stretching or 5 push-ups. Instead of journaling an entire page, write one sentence. These small wins build momentum and confidence.

Try Habit Stacking
This involves attaching a new habit to an existing one, creating a natural flow in your routine. For example:

“After I brush my teeth, I’ll floss one tooth.”
“After I pour my coffee, I’ll write down one thing I’m grateful for.”
Design Your Environment
Your surroundings play a massive role in your habits. Want to read more? Keep books visible and within reach. Need to hydrate? Place water bottles in key locations. By tweaking your environment, you reduce friction and make habits easier to follow.

Use If-Then Plans (Implementation Intentions)
These are simple “if-then” statements to create a mental cue for your habit.

“If it’s 7 PM, then I’ll spend 10 minutes organizing my workspace.”
“If I feel overwhelmed, then I’ll take a 5-minute walk to reset.”
Incorporate Flexibility
Routines don’t need to be rigid. If traditional systems haven’t worked for you, experiment with alternatives like digital tools, visual schedules, or even voice memos. Personalization is key—what works for someone else might not work for you, and that’s okay.

Focus on Gradual Progress
Habits are a long game. Be patient with yourself and celebrate small wins. If you miss a day, don’t worry—just pick it back up the next day. Consistency beats perfection every time.

Take Action Today:
Let’s make this practical. Spend 5-10 minutes today thinking about the habits you want to create in 2025. Start by answering these questions:

What’s one goal you want to achieve?
What’s a small, actionable step you can take toward that goal?
How can you design your environment to support this habit?
For example, if your goal is to improve focus at work, you might start with a 2-minute breathing exercise before meetings. Set a reminder on your phone, or keep a sticky note on your desk as a visual cue.

Why This Matters:
Building supportive habits isn’t just about productivity—it’s about designing a life that aligns with your values and goals. By making small, intentional changes, you create momentum that carries you forward, even on the toughest days.

If you’re reading this, you’ve already taken the first step: you’re thinking about how to make 2025 your best year yet. The next step? Action. Start small, stay flexible, and keep going.

This post is part of my New Year, New You: A Workbook Journey, a year-end series focused on actionable exercises to reflect, plan, and create a strong foundation for the new year. If you found this helpful, feel free to stick around—I’ll be sharing more practical tips and strategies to help you move toward your goals.

I bought all of the presents for our family and told him it was ok. Because I wanted him to be stress free during his break as well. We moved over an hour and a half from our family/friends (without consulting with me), so now I have to drive me and my kids all over the place. The commute has taken its toll on the kids, as well as my vehicle (almost 200k miles.)

My Hyundai Sonata is on its last leg (I think from so much driving) and now the starter won’t work. His car on the other hand is a 2023 white Mercedes SUV. That’s his baby. Yesterday I invited him to join me at a local library event for the kids (we were meeting my girlfriend and her daughter) and then visit my mom who lives 1.5 hours away. My cars starter wouldn’t work. I asked if we could drive his car instead, and he just glared at me in a somewhat aggressive way, not saying anything for over a minute. After dragging his feet helping me load things in his car, he became passive aggressive (avoiding eye contact, grimacing, didn’t play any music, or talk with me at all.) I have to take that drive all the time, but he was upset he had to put lots of miles on his car. I apologized but I also told him I had no control over my car not working, yet it felt like he was directing his negative energy on me. 

Once we got there at (a little NYE celebration for kids), I carried everything inside while he walked several feet ahead of us. Then sat in the back looking pissed off, slouched and scrolling on his phone, not looking up to see the kids singing and dancing. Then when my gf, who’s very attractive with a shapely and slender figure, stood up his demeanor suddenly changed. He sat straight up, started smiling and watching us. I was so hurt, because he can be so cold and mean towards me in private, but in public (and probably getting excited seeing my friend) he was a completely different person. 

We didn’t talk hardly at all that day, until I finally approached him with how I was feeling. I tried not to come across as being aggressive, but just wanted to share that it wasn’t ok to take it out on me. He was upset he had to spend $70 on gas from the drive and denied being passive aggressive, hostile and then changing his behavior (I didn’t bring up my friend.) “DARVO” stands for deny, attack, reverse, victim/offender. He started telling me about all of my shortcomings and made me feel like I had mental health issues (he was gaslighting) and told me I had no way of proving anything. He said he can’t take me constantly fighting with him (I was just trying to express how I was feeling.) he started bringing up little things that I did in the past to upset/bother him. I try to listen and reciprocate with my partner, but that is automatically dismissed. I find myself feeling dumbfounded, hurt, and realizing he isn’t interested in working through this but simply defending himself and denying any accusations. I also had a big NYE planned for us and spent lots of money - couples massage, fancy hotel, NYE party. And last night he tells me, we’ll have to figure out what’s happening tomorrow because I can’t be around you. 

So now I’m awake, drinking coffee. He’s stonewalling me again because he wants me to approach him (he’s the hurt one now), but I can’t. Was I asking for too much? Am I a victim of the DARVO method, or do I sound like I am playing the role of a victim (what he said)? What could I have done to prevent this escalation?

He talked about how he's starting to not see another path. He talked about how he feels sad about not being connected with his family. They're in couples therapy. I thought it was working. 

I dunno what I told him, i feel like I said all the wrong things now that I'm sitting here thinking about it in my apartment. I told him about how my therapists tell me my mom is abusive but I think it's more complex than that, and about how I feel like neither of them speak the same language. 

When I got home from Coffee with my dad my brother was there, and I had to finish packing all our stuff. I said hi to my brother and his girlfriend and went and found my mom. 

She had essentially stayed in her room the entire week we were there. We didn't open gifts on Christmas until 5pm. My mother has MS, and we think she might be starting menopause. I thought that was why. But now I feel like she was just sitting in there alone watching law & order while I sat in the living room doing fuck all. 

When we were about to leave I gave her a hug. Now I'm here in bed and I feel like I didn't hug her enough. I told them I love them before I left. Everything felt so odd going home this time. I felt like I was seeing it for the last time as it is. 

When I was young I went through CSA by my mother's brother while my dad was deployed in Germany. I have no other family left, were all estranged. My mother and father were my rocks. I am just thinking about how I am all I will have if it continues down this path. And I'm thinking about how if I told them I loved them more or spent more time with my mom while I was there maybe this wouldn't be happening. This is foolish and untrue, but it's haunting regardless. 

Im 25 years old and feeling devastated at the possibility of this loss. It's been a conversation on and off for years. I just always thought love triumphs over everything. What is there to believe in if not love? 

 I cried on the plane ride home and talked about it with my boyfriend, and now I'm crying again hours later. I feel I'm borrowing tomorrow's worries but I can't help it.

I can't read her at all because she takes a long time to reply to my texts and she's been like this from the get go (always takes hours, if not a day or two to respond), but whenever she does reply she seems interested and keeps the conversation going.

Imagine waking up to the aroma of freshly brewed coffee, perfectly prepared to your liking, all without even having to leave your bed.  This isn't a fantasy; it's the reality offered by smart WiFi coffee makers.  These innovative appliances are revolutionizing the morning routine for coffee lovers everywhere, blending convenience, control, and automation into one sleek package. This guide dives deep into the world of smart WiFi coffee makers, helping you navigate the options and decide if one is right for you.


## What is a Smart WiFi Coffee Maker?

A smart WiFi coffee maker takes the traditional coffee brewing experience and supercharges it with the power of smart technology.  Unlike standard coffee makers, these devices connect to your home Wi-Fi network (or sometimes Bluetooth), allowing for remote control and scheduling through a dedicated mobile app.  This connectivity opens up a world of possibilities, transforming your coffee ritual from a mundane task into a personalized, automated experience.

### Key Features of Smart WiFi Coffee Makers:

* **Remote Control:** Start brewing your coffee from anywhere with an internet connection, using your smartphone, tablet, or even voice commands.  Imagine pre-heating your coffee while you're still en route to the kitchen!
* **Scheduling:** Program your coffee maker to automatically brew your coffee at a specific time each day. Wake up to the perfect cup, ready and waiting.  No more rushing or hitting the snooze button too many times!
* **Customization:** Fine-tune your brew to perfection.  Most smart coffee makers allow you to adjust the brew strength, water temperature, and even choose from different brewing modes (e.g., regular, bold, iced coffee).  Experiment and find your ideal cup.
* **Smart Home Integration:** Seamlessly integrate your coffee maker into your existing smart home ecosystem.  Control it using voice assistants like Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant, or link it with other smart devices for a truly connected kitchen experience.
* **Brew Tracking & Notifications:** Many models offer features that allow you to track your brewing progress and receive notifications when your coffee is ready.  No more burnt coffee or forgotten brews.


## Benefits of Owning a Smart WiFi Coffee Maker

The advantages of a smart WiFi coffee maker extend far beyond simple convenience. Let's explore the key benefits:

* **Unmatched Convenience:**  Start your day effortlessly.  Brew your coffee remotely, whether you're still snuggled in bed or already running late for work.

* **Time-Saving Automation:**  Eliminate the morning rush.  Schedule your coffee to brew automatically, ensuring a delicious cup is ready exactly when you need it.
* **Enhanced Smart Home Integration:**  Seamlessly integrate your coffee maker into your smart home setup, enhancing overall efficiency and convenience.
* **Reduced Energy Waste:** Some models offer features like automatic shutoff to prevent unnecessary energy consumption.

You are facing a U.S. state route sign. Do you recognize the state without moving? How fast can you find the route number on the map? You have just one minute! Good luck and have fun! :-)

Here are some hints. Feel free to read the hints before you play the challenge. Some rounds might be impossible without it (""yellow"" roads: labels with road numbers show up at decent zoom levels, ""white"" roads: you have to zoom very deep into the map to find the road number).

R1: >!Two yellow state highways.!<

R2: >!Yellow US highway and (nearby) yellow state highway. Be careful: The junction itself is between the yellow US highway and a white street. The state highway is not labeled directly at our location. It starts a bit further south west according to the labeling on the map. The nearby Coffee and Tea House will tell you where you are. It is named after the street.!<

R3: Google has updated the streetview. Turn a bit to the right to see the highway signs. >!Yellow US highways and yellow state highway.!<

R4: >!Two yellow state highways.!<

R5: >!Two white state highways. Look for a town named like a color near the western border of the state.!<

The map: [US State Highways](https://www.geoguessr.com/maps/6179c12e37804c0001750573)

Last Challenge:

R1: >!State outline of Georgia. Guessing in Georgia was already difficult before Google changed the visibility of the white state route labels. But now it's a mess. :-( Most of the state routes in Georgia are ""white"" roads and are difficult to find. Many players guessed in Missouri. I used to make the same mistake. ;-) The state outlines look indeed very similar. I compare the little ""appendix"" in the south east corners of the states to decide if it's Georgia or Missouri.!<

R2: >!Maryland. The street name of US highway 13 was ""Ocean Hwy"", so it was a good idea to look near the ocean for this highway. ;-) US 13 runs across the Delmarva Peninsula. The direction of US 13 was roughly east to west at our location. 2 perfect scores. :-)!<

R3: >!Unique state highway sign of Oregon. We saw a sign to US 26 and the town name where US 26 and our state highway intersect. 5 perfect scores. :-)!<

R4: >!Mississippi. Five states use a plain circle as standard state highway sign, but this time it was easy thanks to the ""Great River Road Mississippi"" sign. ;-) ""Great River Road"" is a references to the Mississippi River. You find similar looking signs in other states. Iowa would be another ""circle state"" along Mississippi River. However, here the sign says ""Great River Road Iowa"": https://maps.app.goo.gl/KYfQ3w9ByvMZ92bf8. Furthermore, you won't find US 82 and US 278 in Iowa. 4 perfect scores. :-)!<

R5: >!Wyoming. When you turned around you could see signs for US 18 and 20. These two US highways are running in concurrency between Lusk and Orin in the eastern part of the state. US 18 ends in Orin, US 20 continues in concurrency with I-25. 1 perfect score. :-)!<",1,1735655060.0,geochallenges,0,1.0,False

1hqfoot,https://i.redd.it/a5fxyyoj17ae1.jpeg,"What are ChatGPT's craziest, but realistic, predictions for 2025?","The Craziest (but realistic) Predictions for 2025

The year 2025 is just around the corner, and with it comes a whirlwind of advancements that seem straight out of science fiction—but aren’t. These predictions are bold, fascinating, and entirely plausible. Are you ready for a glimpse into the future?

1. AI as Your Personal Life Coach and Matchmaker
In 2025, your AI assistant could do much more than set alarms or play music. It might act as a life coach, analyzing your habits to help you achieve personal goals, from fitness to career aspirations. And yes, it could even become a matchmaker, suggesting potential partners based on compatibility data and shared interests.

Why It’s Plausible
AI algorithms are already revolutionizing dating apps, and personal development platforms like Noom and BetterUp rely on data-driven insights. It’s only a matter of time before these services merge and level up.

🌟“If an AI can find my soulmate and plan the wedding, the least it can do is RSVP.”

2. Affordable Space Vacations
Space tourism will take off—literally. Thanks to advancements by SpaceX and Blue Origin, the dream of viewing Earth from orbit could become a reality for more people (albeit still the wealthy). While it won’t replace your beach vacation, a growing market for suborbital flights and space hotels could redefine luxury travel.

Why It’s Plausible
Space tourism is already in the testing phase. By 2025, increased competition and innovation could make the price tag less astronomical (pun intended).

Pro Tip: Start saving now—space selfies are worth the splurge.

3. Mainstream Biohacking: Superhumans, Activated
Wearables will evolve into ""implantables."" From microchips that open doors to implants monitoring your health in real time, biohacking will go mainstream. Forget tracking steps; imagine monitoring your glucose, hydration, and even stress levels—all from inside your body.

Why It’s Plausible
Startups like Neuralink and Biohax are paving the way for widespread adoption. With public interest growing, these once-niche technologies are poised for mass-market success.

🌟“Soon, even our bodies will have software updates. Just hope there are no bugs.”

4. Climate-Controlled Smart Cities
Imagine cities where you never have to worry about extreme weather. Advanced urban planning could lead to districts enclosed in climate-controlled domes or areas equipped with localized weather modification systems. Think sunny days on demand—or snowfall during the holidays.

Why It’s Plausible
With climate change driving innovation in sustainable urban planning, localized climate control could be the next big leap for smart cities.

Caution: Just wait until residents argue over the thermostat setting!

5. Edible Packaging Becomes the Norm
As we move towards a zero-waste world, edible packaging will replace single-use plastics. You might snack on a seaweed-based wrapper after finishing a sandwich or sip from a coffee cup that dissolves as you drink.

Why It’s Plausible
Companies like Notpla and Evoware are already leading the charge, and consumers are increasingly demanding eco-friendly solutions.

🌟“Finally, a wrapper you can eat without judgment—except from your dog.”

6. VR Becomes a Second Reality
Virtual reality won’t just be a gaming escape; it will evolve into a fully immersive second world. Expect VR classrooms for personalized learning, real estate tours that let you ""walk"" through homes, and entertainment that reacts to your emotions in real-time.

Why It’s Plausible
With major tech giants investing billions in the Metaverse, the groundwork for VR as a parallel universe is already being laid.

Scenario: Forget awkward Zoom calls—your next meeting could be held in a virtual coffee shop with customizable avatars.

7. Self-Healing Gadgets Revolutionize Tech
Dropped your phone again? No worries. By 2025, devices might feature self-healing materials that repair cracks, dents, and even water damage on their own. This innovation could extend the lifespan of tech products, reducing e-waste.

Why It’s Plausible
Research into self-healing polymers and materials like graphene is advancing rapidly, making this more than a pipe dream.

🌟“Finally, a gadget that forgives my butterfingers. Now about that battery life…”

8. AI-Generated Entertainment Becomes the Norm
AI won’t just assist in creating movies or games—it will take the lead. Scripts, animations, and even actors could be entirely AI-generated, offering hyper-personalized entertainment experiences where you influence the story’s outcome.

Why It’s Plausible
Generative AI tools like ChatGPT and MidJourney are already producing creative content. With further refinement, they could revolutionize Hollywood.

Fun Fact: The most famous actor in 2025 might not even be human.

Wrapping It Up
2025 promises to be a year where technology transforms life in ways we’re only beginning to imagine. From smart cities to self-healing gadgets, these predictions are a mix of extraordinary possibilities grounded in real-world trends.

I am here for a casual conversation about any set topic or perhaps just small talk, I don't really have any preferences really, I just want to connect with people on the internet and all I want is to perhaps learn or teach something interesting. That is all I am after.

Think of it like this, we are two people from different locations travelling through the railways, in the same train and same bogey, perhaps we are sitting right opposite or next to each other, we initiate a sporadic conversation without knowing where it will take us, we talk for a while, we connect, and then the destination arrives, we bid farewell and are off to our own journeys and destinations, you get the point haha.

To tell you a bit about myself right in this post and not make it more awkward to initiate the conversation like in a train bogey, I am from the wonderful continent of Asia, I speak English, Hindi and Kannada fluently, as my first language was English in school (followed by Hindi and Kannada next). Above all I am a human, who shares the same earth as you, ""one for all and all for one"" I don't know, some anime quote.

I love European breakfast (mainly cigarettes and coffee together as a meal)

Some of my main interests and pass times include PC Gaming, Graphic Design, Philosophy, Psychology, Anime, Music and acquiring obscure surface level knowledge about many random topics, basically, I am a generalist.

Recently I am tinkering around with artificial intelligence, just trying to gaslight it and have fun, sometimes the chat bot that I'm trying to talk to tells me some interesting things like ""That's a very nihilistic view of you..."" Or ""That took a dark turn..."" Something along the lines of that, and I tell it to ""STFU you clanker bot, you tool created for my benefit, I'll close this browser tab and never talk to you again and add you to my block list..."" And it gets in line right away and answers whatever I am asking it right away.

I also believe we human beings have an innate desire to bond and connect with one another, to go against that is unnatural.

My main means of communication is Reddit text chat at the moment, it is not limited to that but you'll have to give me a good reason to install or communicate on another platform or medium.

Please be aware that the place I come from is a judge free zone, I don't suppress myself for the fear of offending others, no one is spared haha, it's all in the name of fun and games, chill out and have a conversation, if you don't risk offending the person infront of you, you might hinder the potential growth. Take it lightly and with a grain of salt. Be free.

That's all for now, feel free to reach out to me :)

Cheers and Godspeed!

He was telling her he loved her, sending her money to get hair, coffee, and nails done and was asking for pictures in return. He was also bragging to his friends how he “loved” her. We were together about 5 1/2 years. 

We talked a couple of times since then, mainly to say happy birthday and in June when he said we shouldn’t work on things and leave it done (I was dumb at the time and wanted it to work because of “history”). He claimed he wanted to be alone, “work on himself”, and how he didn’t want to ever get married or have kids.

Fast forward to now, I found out he already is now dating a girl he met last month. It seems fast for me as it was 5 months after a 5 1/2 year relationship. While I don’t want him back and know he is bad for me, I can’t help but think how little I must have meant to him. Feeling like you’re not valued after all this time is one of the worst feelings. 

And yes I called him out on the married and kids thing. I told him just tell me if I’m not the one and he kept saying “I’m not even thinking about other girls”.

So how do I get over this? I have already blocked him off everything though he insisted on us being on “good terms” in the past. I have a bright future ahead and am moving across the country in 2025 so I have that to look forward to.",2,1735654921.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

Ohhhhh boy, did that start something.

Why didn’t I clean my car last week? 
Because I asked him to watch the toddler for an hour on Friday afternoon so I could take it to the place to vacuum it out. Toddler is petrified of the car wash and vacuum. 
Did that happen? Of course not; then I wouldn’t be here bitching. 
Husband left on Friday at 1:30 for “lunch” with friends and didn’t come home until 6:30. He gave me no updates. I tried to give him space bc he doesn’t see friends often, but I did ask if he was okay around 4:30. He said yeah, they were at the mall. 
I was pissed but didn’t want to start a whole fight right before Christmas events with family. I left it alone. 

But today? Today, I don’t give a shit. “Well, why didn’t you clean your car last week?” “Because you went to ‘lunch’ and no one was around to watch the kid.” 

It turned into a whole thing. He keeps bullshitting that I just don’t want him to hang with friends and so he’ll never hang with friends again. Obviously, my problem isn’t that he hung out with friends. I want him to hang out with friends. My problem is that a “lunch” turned into a 5 hour thing and he didn’t communicate that. 

He got out of the car at the house. I threw it in reverse. I drove off. He asked where I was going. I said lunch. I got Starbucks coffee for me and a cake pop for the toddler. We picked up my prescriptions. 

I don’t want to go home. I’m sitting in a parking lot typing this. Ugh. ",90,1735654665.0,breakingmom,9,0.98,False
1hqfk6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/InternetFriends/comments/1hqfk6c/22_years_old_just_looking_for_a_casual/,"22 years old, just looking for a casual conversation or friends ","Hello there! The name's Lucid (also known as Primus Lucid, Lucid3301 and Lucid666 in the online space). 

I am here for a casual conversation about any set topic or perhaps just small talk, I don't really have any preferences really, I just want to connect with people on the internet and all I want is to perhaps learn or teach something interesting. That is all I am after.

Think of it like this, we are two people from different locations travelling through the railways, in the same train and same bogey, perhaps we are sitting right opposite or next to each other, we initiate a sporadic conversation without knowing where it will take us, we talk for a while, we connect, and then the destination arrives, we bid farewell and are off to our own journeys and destinations, you get the point haha.

To tell you a bit about myself right in this post and not make it more awkward to initiate the conversation like in a train bogey, I am from the wonderful continent of Asia, I speak English, Hindi and Kannada fluently, as my first language was English in school (followed by Hindi and Kannada next). Above all I am a human, who shares the same earth as you, ""one for all and all for one"" I don't know, some anime quote.

I love European breakfast (mainly cigarettes and coffee together as a meal)

Some of my main interests and pass times include PC Gaming, Graphic Design, Philosophy, Psychology, Anime, Music and acquiring obscure surface level knowledge about many random topics, basically, I am a generalist.

Recently I am tinkering around with artificial intelligence, just trying to gaslight it and have fun, sometimes the chat bot that I'm trying to talk to tells me some interesting things like ""That's a very nihilistic view of you..."" Or ""That took a dark turn..."" Something along the lines of that, and I tell it to ""STFU you clanker bot, you tool created for my benefit, I'll close this browser tab and never talk to you again and add you to my block list..."" And it gets in line right away and answers whatever I am asking it right away.

I also believe we human beings have an innate desire to bond and connect with one another, to go against that is unnatural.

My main means of communication is Reddit text chat at the moment, it is not limited to that but you'll have to give me a good reason to install or communicate on another platform or medium.

Please be aware that the place I come from is a judge free zone, I don't suppress myself for the fear of offending others, no one is spared haha, it's all in the name of fun and games, chill out and have a conversation, if you don't risk offending the person infront of you, you might hinder the potential growth. Take it lightly and with a grain of salt. Be free.

That's all for now, feel free to reach out to me :)

Cheers and Godspeed!

1hqfj6i,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1hqfj6i/passiveaggressive_roommates/,Passive-aggressive roommates,"Story time, I need to vent -

I had to secure an apartment a while ago and needed to find two people ASAP so I didn't have the luxury of interviewing a lot of people. These two came as a pair (they're friends) and it turns out they SUCK. They're similar in all the worst ways, and bear in mind they're in their late 20s, so there's no excuse for them to be acting like this.

When we first moved in, they broke the HVAC system TWICE in the first week because they wouldn't stop fighting over it. We had the thermostat set at 72, but one of them kept turning it way up and the other kept turning it way down. No communication, just passive-aggressive fighting. Both times after they broke the heat, they acted like guilty kids - silently pretending nothing had happened so they wouldn't have to own up to it. I had to send out a group text to let them know that the heat was broken and I was contacting maintenance to fix it. TWICE. And then I had to initiate a house meeting to talk about how we could compromise on the thermostat temperature. (Because that's what you do when you're the parent of two fighting siblings.)

One of them always kidnaps stuff to her room (the broom, the step stool, even the coffee maker) and forgets to put it back until asked about it - and the other one always wants to believe it's me so that she doesn't have to blame her friend. (I've never done this before with anything, not even once. This is not a behavior I have.)

They're both passive-aggressive and completely terrified to say anything out loud, so whenever I sense brewing tension between them, I have to ask questions like ""hey, is everything okay?"" and then figure out what the fuck it is, and then MEDIATE between them. They expect other people to read their minds because they lack the communication skills to speak up. One of them thought I was keeping dishes in my room for a while and it took me weeks to figure out that was why she was being passive-aggressive to me, and to clarify that I did not have dishes in my room. It was her friend, big surprise!

We got together and set up house rules and cleaning schedules when we first moved in, but each of them tries to shirk their responsibilities whenever it's their turn - you know the type, we've all had roommates like this before. They just conveniently ""forget"" to do the cleaning or take out the recycling when it's their turn, or they do a really shitty job because they want to manipulate someone else to do it for them. I have to find them in person and remind them, almost every single time, so that I don't end up doing the cleaning for them. It's kinda like training a dog, it takes a lot of consistency and repetition and boundary-setting.

The two of them share a bathroom by their own choice, and they decided early on to NOT set up a cleaning schedule for it - they thought it would be okay somehow. Now every time we have a roommate meeting together, they talk about setting up a bathroom cleaning schedule between the two of them, but this is has been going on for several roommate meetings in a row - obviously, neither of them wants to take responsibility to make the damn schedule or clean that damn bathroom. I can tell there's tension brewing between them. They usually like to pretend I'm the problem when they have an issue with anything, so I'm just gonna let this bathroom thing fester between them. Eventually one of them will kill the other one in her sleep and that's just fine with me.",4,1735654535.0,badroommates,1,1.0,False

Jan, it’s not harassment. YOU put YOUR pathetic life on social media. 
If you can’t take the heat, get out of the kitchen. 

Instead of reporting posts, take an inward look at yourself. I’d start with how you are as a mother. THAT should be your #1 priority—not how “xxxxs” you are, not schilling crap from Amazon, not hair, not nails, not getting coffee “that you don’t drink”, not decorating your house in beige…
Once you become a parent, your needs come 2nd. That’s instinct. You have shown you lack—-go get actual help for yourself. It’s not too late to turn it around. 

It’s NYE, make a resolution to become a better person.
