This past year I haven’t worked, I kinda took a break because I could and because I needed it. I used to work so much… I mean, so much. Typical man shit, work hard, get paid so your family can live a good life. 

My wife is a snob, she says she isn’t, but she sure likes to surround herself with nice things and buy designer items not because of the design, but the designer. It’s fine, what ever. 

But when it comes to our household she’s the same, or worse. She works, and expect me to keep the house up to her standard because I don’t work at the moment. 

Past six months she’s been distant, moody for no apparent reason, I was thinking menopause and I have tried to approach the subject many times but she gets really defensive, so I drop it. 

Turns out, she was mad all along because she thinks I’m a bad stay at home husband, and I’m like, what the fuck!? That shit hurt me, bad. 

I know this is thin ice to walk as a man, seeing how women were house wives for a long time, but let me share what I do, and what she does. 

When she comes home from work she watches tv for a while, or read a book, wind down from work. Then she sits down and eats the food I cooked (I’m a decent home chef), and then goes back to the screen or her book while I do the dishes. 

Before she comes home I have made sure the laundry is done, grocery shopping, general house cleaning like picking up her and the kids clutter. Every surface is clean, and the home is ready for guests at all times. Generally very clean and tidy. Not because she expect it, it’s just I’m at home all the time, shit gets boring, may as well clean up. 

BUT, yes, I may leave a coffee cup on the kitchen counter, and no I don’t clean the kids rooms, they are almost grown up. Other than that I can’t really understand what more I can do. 

Idk, I’m hurt. I asked her, who does she think she is, to be a person to set impossible standards where in my turn I am a person who follows it or not? I’m not an employee? I care for our home, I’m a good dad, I’m a loving, caring husband, a good provider, but I get shit in return, and it’s all because a coffee cup and a random tooth paste stain on the bathroom mirror? 

Like I said, I used to work a lot, but being home has me doubting this shit, hard. 

I’m thinking, what can I do better and what am I not seeing? Maybe I neglect her, you know? But no. It’s like I’m being mentally abused over putting the house key on the dresser in the hallway instead of on a hook where it ”belongs”. Not attractive at all. 

And for all of you thinking, there must be something else, I’m not telling the full story, please ask questions and I’ll try to answer. I had to really press my wife on this issue, like please help me, I can see something is wrong I just don’t know what. And I got hit with ”I kept my mouth shut for months, but it bothers me that you rest all day and still can’t do household chores how I want them”. So? You stay at home then? And do them to you standard? 

(Examples, I cannot wash socks together with underwear, bc it’s gross to her for some reason. Also I don’t water the plants, bc if I do I water one too much and another not enough. Some times I may have curtains cover a window bc of the sun, and don’t immediately pull them back when the sun has moved. I may so slow cooked meals so it smells too much of food when she comes home)

Writing this out makes me laugh actually. Have I created a monster? ",1,1770720268.0,WhatShouldIDo,0,1.0,False
1r0xhr8,https://www.reddit.com/r/badbreath/comments/1r0xhr8/my_new_routine/,My new routine.,"Okay, so I will preface by saying that I don't have chronic, constant bad breath. I do, however, have some times where things get pretty nasty. I have the usual dry mouth, tongue coating issues - I have had some gum problems due to past smoking, and (until recently) I had got into a very bad habit of drinking lots of black tea and coffee - at my worst I was drinking 10 cups of black tea a day.

So the new routine:

1. **No smoking.** Smoking is absolutely catastrophic for oral health. I smoked for about 10 years. I still have a few cigarettes when I'm drinking alcohol, but never in my daily life. Day-to-day, I use nicotine pouches, which are still bad, but in my anecdotal experience, they are not nearly as damaging as smoking.

2. **Aim to stay away from drinks that have a drying or dehydrating effect.** Main culprits: Black tea and coffee (caffeine and tannins which dry the mouth) and alcohol (which dehydrates the body). All of these drinks directly contribute to that horrible tongue coating. I now limit myself to two cups of tea or coffee per day - otherwise, to scratch the itch, I drink Rooibos tea, which is the closest thing I can find that has neither caffeine nor the type of tannins that contribute to the dry, sticky mouth. Seriously - you can drink as much rooibos as you want, and your mouth will never be calling out saying ""stop, please, I need water!""

3. **Always swish out the mouth with water after eating, always have xylitol chewing gum on hand if my mouth ever feels a little dry.** These are self explanatory, but essentially it's all about minimising the bacterial feeding ground in the mouth and promoting salivary flow.

4. **Supplements.** I take a variety of supplements, some of which are proven to be linked to oral health, some of which have strong indications but are more in the theoretical realm, and some of which are still pretty experimental (all safe though, I'm not taking mega doses of fringe supplements). 

5. **Rigourous oral hygiene**. Water floss every morning, string floss every night. Brush for two minutes, twice a day - really make sure to get in and scrub all over the back molars - when I started giving extra care to back molars, I noticed that the weird sickly sweet, metallic taste I would get as I was falling asleep disappeared. I brush my tongue morning and night with a manual toothbrush - *BUT* with one important caveat: because of how much tongue coating I got from all the tea and coffee, I used to brush my tongue like mad to try and get rid of all the gunk. What I didn't realise is that, counter intuitively, this is potentially harmful - brushing/scrubbing the tongue really hard is potentially causing more cellular turnover on the tongue, as the tongue is essentially trying to protect itself against the irritation. Since the tongue gunk is a combination of dead cells, proteins etc all binding together on the tongue, we don't want this. So now what I'm doing is still brushing my tongue morning and night, just much more gently. **This change, combined with the decrease in tea and coffee, has had the biggest positive effect so far.**

6. **Nighttime routine.** At night, after brushing, I pop into my mouth some oral probiotic lozenges. There doesn't seem to be a huge amount of hard evidence for oral probiotics, but the logic is sound: we want to promote the colonisation of good bacteria in the mouth. I put them in last thing before bed, after brushing, per the instructions, so that the good bacteria has loads of time to get colonising. I also wear a nightguard due to bruxism, and finally I apply mouth tape as I suspect that I am a nighttime mouth breather - my mouth is much less dry and the gross morning taste is hugely reduced when I wear the tape, which gives credence to my suspicions.

So - hopefully I haven't forgotten anything. This is all still a work in progress, but I have definitely seen some encouraging results. Happy to answer any questions.",1,1770720257.0,badbreath,0,1.0,False

My ADHD assessor must have thought I was crazy. She asked how my sleep was and I sincerely said it was completely fine, that I usually go to bed at around midnight or 1am (I've done this my whole teenage and adult life, so it genuinely felt normal for me). I didn't see any serious issue with having even driven a 160 mile work trip, on zero hours of sleep. 

Since taking Vyvanse/Elvanse (currently 50mg, but moving up to 70mg) I found that my sleep has actually improved. I know that bad sleep is meant to be a side effect, and I can see why given that the stimulant makes me feel energized and awake just like my daily coffee used to. However, I can focus so much easier that going to bed is no longer the big effort or requires the active commitment that it once did. 

Like, these days I will actually just put my phone away, place my head on the pillow, decide to sleep - and 20 minutes later I'm snoozing. I want to say that the extra focus from the medication helps me with sleep, i.e. that my mind is no longer racing about on a thousand things and I can just focus on what I want to do (whether it's working, studying, or sleeping). 

But at the same time, this explanation doesn't make much sense to me. I'm unsure about it because usually, by night time, the medication has worn off. My appetite returns and I raid my fridge, my mood drops, and I often feel a bit irritable. I'm not the calm, happy, and focused machine that I was earlier on in the day. 

If the medication has worn off by night time, then how can the medication also help me sleep? Or is it possible that enough of the medication lingers to the point where I don't feel as great as I do during its peak, but I can still somewhat focus on tasks like sleeping?

The fix? Take tiny steps that feel doable, and pair them with some therapy support. At Untangled Minds, we help folks ditch the isolation and build real connections without the overwhelm.

# Start with Easy Hangouts

Jump into stuff you already like-hobbies, workouts, or volunteering-where chatting happens on its own. Think book groups or Mumbai hikes. No awkward small talk forced on you.

Good spots to try:

* Coffee shops or local centers where faces get familiar.
* Apps like Meetup or Bumble BFF for chill events.
* Chat up a coworker or neighbor over a quick coffee.

Stick around regularly, and the nerves start to fade.

# Nail Short Chats First

Build up with quick hellos. Smile, look near their eyes (nose works if it's too much), and ask stuff like ""What got you into this?"" Really listen-it shifts focus off you.

Handy tricks:

* Have a couple of easy topics ready, like the weather or what's happening around.
* Stand open, nod—makes you seem friendly.
* End with ""Fun talking-WhatsApp sometime?""

Our therapy here preps you to stretch that comfort bit by bit.

# Keep It Going

Friends need repeat time. Text something simple like ""This reminded me of our chat"" or grab coffee (skip big dinners). Say yes to invites when you can-showing up matters.

Ways to nurture:

* Clubs around your interests for steady meetups.
* Local volunteering draws nice people naturally.
* Flip bad thoughts: ""They'll hate me"" to ""One chat won't hurt.""

CBT sessions with us rewire that anxiety and lift your confidence.

# Get Pro Help

Therapy works wonders for this-we teach chat skills, kindness to yourself, and how to set limits. Groups let you practice safely.

You can make adult friends even with social anxiety, just ease in, share interests, and follow through. Untangled Minds gives you custom tools to end the alone days. Up for it? Book at untangledminds that first hello might lead somewhere big.

**The Modern Gluttony Trap:** We live in an era of ""Nutritional Noise."" The average human today eats 6-10 times a day (including snacks), keeping insulin constantly elevated. This state of permanent ""Fed State"" shuts down your body's most powerful healing mechanism: **Autophagy** (Cellular Spring Cleaning).

**The Ancestral Blueprint (The Irhoud Baseline):** 300,000 years ago, food was a reward for effort, not a constant background noise. Our ancestors at Jebel Irhoud were masters of the **""Metabolic Switch.""** Their bodies could seamlessly switch from burning glucose (from rare honey or tubers) to burning stored body fat (ketosis). This flexibility is the hallmark of biological integrity.

**The ""Irhoud Fast"" Protocol:** To reclaim your metabolic sovereignty, you must re-teach your mitochondria how to function without constant input:

1. **The 16:8 Sovereignty Window:** Confine all calorie intake to an 8-hour window. This is the bare minimum to trigger initial cellular repair.
2. **The ""Water-Only"" Vigil:** For the first 4 hours after waking, consume only water or black coffee/tea. This aligns with the ""Irhoud Dawn"" protocol, using light—not food—as your primary morning energy signal.
3. **The Pre-Sleep Void:** Stop all intake 3 hours before bed. Digestion is a high-energy process that competes with your brain's nocturnal ""Glymphatic"" cleaning.

**The Bio-Chemical Shift:**

* **Insulin Sensitivity:** Lowering systemic inflammation and clearing brain fog.
* **BDNF Boost:** Fasting triggers Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor—literally ""fertilizer"" for new neurons.
* **Metabolic Flexibility:** The ability to sustain high-focus work even when a meal is delayed.

**The AXIR Challenge:** Is your brain fueled by your last snack, or by your inherent biological reserves? Try the 16:8 window tomorrow.

**Reclaim the switch. Rule your hunger.**

1r0x40c,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIToolsAndTips/comments/1r0x40c/10_best_krea_ai_alternatives_for_ai_video/,10 Best Krea AI Alternatives for AI Video Generation I Tried and Loved,"Let’s be honest: \*\*Krea AI\*\* feels like magic. The first time I used its real-time generation feature—where you drag a simple shape and it instantly turns into a realistic photo or video—my jaw hit the floor. It feels like you are painting with the future. It’s the perfect tool for brainstorming and quick, trippy visuals.

But after the ""honeymoon phase"" ended, I hit a wall. I realized that while Krea is an amazing enhancer, it isn't always the best storyteller. I wanted to create longer scenes, consistent characters who didn't morph into weird blobs, and specific artistic styles that Krea just couldn't quite nail. I didn't just want to ""remix"" images; I wanted to generate full-blown videos from scratch.

So, I went down the rabbit hole. I spent weeks testing every major AI video tool on the market to find the best alternatives. I was looking for tools that offer more control, better physics, and higher narrative quality. If you are ready to graduate from Krea AI to something more robust, here are the 10 best alternatives I tried, loved, and think you should use.

1\\. VideoInu AI
---------------

If you are looking for the absolute best alternative to Krea AI, \[\*\*VideoInu AI\*\*\](https://videoinu.com/) is the clear winner. Why? Because while Krea is a single tool, VideoInu is a \*\*super-platform\*\*. Think of VideoInu as the ""Master Key"" to the AI universe. Instead of forcing you to use just one type of proprietary technology, VideoInu acts as a massive aggregator. It connects you to the most powerful AI video models in the world—tech that rivals Sora, Kling, and Runway—all inside one simple, clean dashboard.

When I first switched to VideoInu, the sense of relief was huge. With Krea, I often felt locked into a specific ""dreamy"" aesthetic. But with VideoInu, I had total freedom. One minute I was generating a hyper-realistic, cinematic drone shot of a cyberpunk city; the next, I was creating a cute, Pixar-style 3D character animation. The best part?

You don't need to be a tech wizard to use it. VideoInu handles all the complicated backend stuff. You just type your prompt, select the ""engine"" that fits your vibe, and hit generate. It solves the biggest headache for creators: subscription fatigue. Instead of paying $30 here and $20 there for five different apps, VideoInu gives you the power of all of them in one place.

### Pros

\*\*All-in-One Power:\*\* Access multiple top-tier AI models without leaving the site. \*\*Total Style Control:\*\* You aren't stuck with one look; you can do anime, realism, 3D, and more. \*\*Beginner Friendly:\*\* The interface is designed for creators, not coders. \*\*Wallet Friendly:\*\* Saves you money by consolidating multiple tools into one credit system.

### Cons

\*\*Choice Paralysis:\*\* With so many amazing models to pick from, you might spend a few minutes just deciding which one to try first!

\[\_Try Videoinu – The Ultimate Krea AI Alternative\_\](https://videoinu.com/)

2\\. Video Ocean
---------------

Video Ocean is a platform that truly impressed me with its focus on ""cinematic"" grandeur. While Krea is fantastic for abstract, morphing visuals, Video Ocean seems designed for filmmakers who want their shots to look like a Hollywood movie. I tested this tool specifically with landscape and environmental prompts. I typed in ""a storm brewing over a dark ocean,"" and the result was chillingly realistic. The waves crashed with weight, and the lighting through the clouds was dramatic. It understands atmosphere in a way that Krea sometimes misses.

Video Ocean uses advanced algorithms to handle texture and lighting depth, making every frame feel like it belongs on a cinema screen. It is less about the ""real-time"" playfulness of Krea and more about the ""final polish.""

During my workflow, I found it perfect for creating high-quality B-roll for YouTube documentaries or atmospheric backgrounds for music videos. It feels professional, sleek, and focused on high-resolution output that doesn't just look like ""AI art"" but rather like actual film footage. If you need your visuals to have weight and serious emotional impact, this is the tool that delivers that polished, high-end production value.

### Pros

\*\*Movie Quality:\*\* Optimized for cinematic, widescreen visuals. \*\*Environmental Master:\*\* Incredible at rendering nature, weather, and water. \*\*High Resolution:\*\* The videos look crisp even on larger computer monitors.

### Cons

\*\*Slower Generation:\*\* It takes a bit longer to render than Krea’s instant feedback. \*\*Character Stiffness:\*\* It is better at scenery than complex human acting.

3\\. Stable Video Diffusion (SVD)
--------------------------------

Stable Video Diffusion is the heavy hitter for the tech-savvy creators out there. Developed by Stability AI, this isn't just an app—it's an open-source engine that powers many other tools. I list SVD as a Krea alternative because it offers unparalleled control if you are willing to learn it. Krea is like driving an automatic car; SVD is like driving a manual transmission sports car. You can tweak parameters like ""motion bucket id"" and frames per second, allowing for precise artistic direction.

I found SVD to be the king of Image-to-Video. If you have a stunning static image and you just want to add a subtle wind effect to the hair or make a candle flicker, SVD does it perfectly without changing the original image too much. Krea sometimes ""hallucinates"" and changes the face; SVD is very respectful of your original input.

For those who want to run things locally on their own hardware, SVD provides a level of privacy and cost-efficiency that cloud-based tools can't match. It is a tool built for the ""power user"" who wants to push the boundaries of what AI can do through deep customization and technical mastery.

### Pros

\*\*Image Fidelity:\*\* Best at animating a photo without ruining the original face or details. \*\*Open Source:\*\* If you have a powerful PC (GPU), you can run this for free locally. \*\*Motion Control:\*\* Gives you sliders to control exactly how much movement you want.

### Cons

\*\*Technical Curve:\*\* It is not as ""plug-and-play"" as VideoInu or Krea. \*\*Hardware Demands:\*\* Requires a strong computer or a paid cloud host to run smoothly.

4\\. Hunyuan AI
--------------

Hunyuan AI is a massive, powerful model developed by the tech giant Tencent. When I started testing Hunyuan, I was genuinely blown away by its ability to understand context. Krea sometimes struggles if your prompt is too long or complicated, but Hunyuan reads it like a human would, parsing the nuances of every adjective you use.

I tested it with complex action prompts, like ""a martial artist performing a high kick in a bamboo forest."" In many AI tools, limbs get tangled or look like noodles, but Hunyuan kept the movement fluid and anatomically correct.

The model seems to have a deep training library of human motion and Asian aesthetics, making it a unique alternative for specific cultural themes. Consistency is another strong point; if you are trying to tell a story where a character needs to look the same for more than 2 seconds, Hunyuan is a fantastic choice.

It feels like a very ""smart"" model that bridges the gap between cartoon animation and reality, offering a stable foundation for creators who are tired of the flickering and morphing typical of less advanced engines. It is the logical choice for those who need their AI to actually ""listen"" to the details of a complex script.

### Pros

\*\*Prompt Comprehension:\*\* Reads long, detailed descriptions very accurately. \*\*Fluid Action:\*\* Handles fighting, dancing, and fast movement better than most. \*\*Face Consistency:\*\* Keeps characters looking recognizable throughout the clip.

### Cons

\*\*Access Barriers:\*\* Depending on your region, signing up can sometimes be a bit tricky. \*\*Aesthetic Bias:\*\* It sometimes defaults to a polished, digital-art look unless prompted otherwise.

5\\. Wan AI
----------

Wan AI, specifically the latest versions coming out of Alibaba Cloud, is the new powerhouse for physics and realism. While Krea is often used for ""artistic"" or ""dreamy"" vibes, Wan AI is grounded in the laws of physics. I did a test where I asked for ""a glass vase falling off a table and shattering."" Most AIs make the glass disappear or melt, but Wan AI actually simulated the shattering pieces. It understands gravity, collision, and weight, making it an incredible tool for producing videos or realistic simulations.

If your goal is to make a video that tricks people into thinking it was filmed with a camera, Wan AI is currently one of the strongest contenders. It creates a sense of 3D depth that feels tangible, moving away from the ""flat"" look some AI videos have.

During my trials, I noticed that the way it handles light reflections on metallic and glass surfaces is significantly more advanced than Krea. It provides a level of grit and realism that is perfect for professional advertising or gritty cinematic sequences where the viewer needs to believe in the reality of the scene. It is a serious tool for creators who prioritize the ""truth"" of physics over abstract art.

### Pros

\*\*Physics Engine:\*\* Objects fall, bounce, and break realistically. \*\*Photorealism:\*\* Excellent for creating ""real life"" style footage. \*\*3D Depth:\*\* The AI understands the space between objects very well.

### Cons

\*\*Industrial Interface:\*\* The user experience can feel a bit technical and cold. \*\*New Ecosystem:\*\* There are fewer tutorials and community guides compared to older tools.

6\\. Midjourney
--------------

Okay, hold on. I know what you are thinking: ""Midjourney is an image generator, not a video generator!"" You are right, but it is an essential part of the video workflow that acts as the perfect partner and alternative starting point to Krea. Krea is often used to fix or generate images to animate, but Midjourney is still the king of aesthetics. My workflow is to generate the perfect base image in Midjourney first. The lighting, composition, and texture are unmatched by anything Krea produces.

Once you have that masterpiece from Midjourney, you can bring it into a tool like VideoInu or SVD to animate it. Midjourney is also actively testing its own video editing and 3D features, showing that it’s moving toward a more dynamic future.

If your frustration with Krea is that the ""art style"" looks too messy or ""AI-ish,"" switching your starting point to Midjourney will solve 90% of your problems. It provides the high-fidelity foundation that ensures your final video doesn't just move, but actually looks beautiful. It remains the gold standard for artistic vision and conceptual depth in the AI world.

### Pros

\*\*Unmatched Beauty:\*\* The highest quality artistic output in the AI world. \*\*Style Range:\*\* Can do everything from 1980s polaroids to futuristic concept art. \*\*Creative Community:\*\* The best place to find inspiration and prompts.

### Cons

\*\*Workflow Step:\*\* You currently need another tool to actually make the image move. \*\*Discord UI:\*\* You still mostly interact with it via chat commands, which can be annoying.

7\\. Bytedance Imitator
----------------------

If the main reason you liked Krea was for playing with human forms and shapes, Bytedance Imitator is the specialized alternative you need. This tool is laser-focused on one thing: Human Motion Transfer. Here is how it works: You upload a photo of a person (it could be you, a drawing, or a historical figure). Then, you upload a video of someone dancing. The AI maps the ""skeleton"" of the dancer onto your photo. I had endless fun making the Mona Lisa do TikTok dances.

Unlike Krea, which creates new movements from scratch and often messes up legs, Imitator locks onto the bone structure. It ensures arms don't bend backward and knees stay where they should be. It is a niche tool, but for social media content, it is absolute gold. It removes the randomness of AI movement and replaces it with the precision of human motion.

This makes it perfect for ""virtual influencers"" or anyone trying to create realistic character performances without a high-end motion capture suit. It turns any static character into a believable actor with just a few clicks, making it a powerful weapon for viral marketing.

### Pros

\*\*Dance & Motion:\*\* The absolute best for copying specific moves to a character. \*\*Skeleton Accuracy:\*\* Prevents the ""noodle limbs"" problem common in AI. \*\*Viral Potential:\*\* Perfect for creating funny or engaging social media clips.

### Cons

\*\*Very Niche:\*\* It’s really only for human characters, not landscapes or objects. \*\*Background Blurring:\*\* Sometimes the background gets messy when the character moves fast.

8\\. \[OiiOii.ai\](http://OiiOii.ai)
---------------------------------

\[OiiOii.ai\](http://OiiOii.ai) is a vibrant, fun platform that I found to be incredibly beginner-friendly. While Krea can sometimes feel like a serious tool for digital artists, OiiOii feels like a playground for content creators. This platform specializes in Text-to-Video with a heavy focus on pop culture and social media trends. I loved the ""vibe"" of their models—they are particularly strong at generating anime-style clips and colorful, high-energy animations. It feels very current, like it was built by people who actually use TikTok and Instagram.

One feature I really appreciated was its ability to sync with audio beats in certain modes. If you are looking to make a music visualizer or a punchy intro for your Instagram Reels, OiiOii is much faster and easier to use than Krea. It cuts out the complicated settings and just gives you cool, usable video.

It’s perfect for the ""fast-paced"" creator who needs to jump on a trend quickly without spending hours fiddling with motion buckets or seed numbers. It’s colorful, energetic, and prioritizes the fun of creation over the technicality of the process.

### Pros

\*\*Social Media Ready:\*\* The output is often optimized for vertical screens and trends. \*\*Anime & Cartoon:\*\* Strong performance in 2D and 3D animation styles. \*\*Audio Reactivity:\*\* Great for matching visuals to sound beats.

### Cons

\*\*Less ""Pro"" Control:\*\* Not the right tool for making a serious, gritty short film. \*\*Simpler Physics:\*\* The motion is definitely more ""cartoonish"" than realistic.

9\\. StoryShort AI
-----------------

Krea is a ""manual"" tool—you are the artist brushing the canvas. StoryShort AI is for people who want to be the director or even just the producer. I included this for creators who are tired of prompting every single second of video and just want a finished product. StoryShort is designed for automation. You give it a topic—like ""The History of Coffee""—and it writes the script, generates the voiceover, selects the visuals, and edits it all together into a cohesive package.

I tried this for a ""faceless"" YouTube channel idea, and it saved me hours of work. Instead of generating one clip in Krea, then editing, then prompting again, StoryShort did the whole flow automatically. It’s not for ""artistic experimentation"" in the way Krea is, but it is a business powerhouse for people who want to scale their content creation.

It turns the complex AI video process into a streamlined production line. If your goal is high-volume content for a brand or informational channel, this is the most efficient alternative on the market today.

### Pros

\*\*Full Automation:\*\* Handles script, voice, and video generation in one go. \*\*Speed:\*\* Creates a complete video in the time it takes to prompt one clip elsewhere. \*\*Consistency:\*\* Maintains a cohesive style throughout the whole video.

### Cons

\*\*Loss of Control:\*\* You can't micromanage every pixel like you can in Krea. \*\*Stock Feel:\*\* Sometimes the videos can feel a bit generic if you don't tweak them.

10\\. VideoGPT
-------------

Finally, we have VideoGPT. This is exactly what it sounds like: ChatGPT, but for video. If you found Krea’s interface with its sliders, canvases, and layers too confusing, VideoGPT is your answer. You just chat with it. You say, ""Make me a video of a futuristic cat flying through space,"" and it does it. It uses a conversational interface that makes AI video accessible to absolutely everyone, from kids to grandparents. It feels like having a personal assistant who is also a visual effects artist.

I found it incredibly relaxing to use because I didn't have to worry about ""aspect ratios"" or ""seed numbers."" I just talked to the bot in plain English. While the video quality relies on whichever model it is connected to, the ease of use is unmatched.

It’s the best entry point for total beginners who just want to see their words turn into motion without any technical hurdles. It’s the ""democratization"" of AI video in its purest form, removing all the jargon and leaving only the creative conversation between you and the machine.

### Pros

\*\*Super Simple:\*\* If you can send a text message, you can make a video. \*\*Conversational:\*\* You can ask it to make changes in plain English. \*\*Zero Learning Curve:\*\* No tutorials needed to get started.

### Cons

\*\*Limited Control:\*\* You can't tweak technical settings for precise results. \*\*Variable Quality:\*\* The output can be hit or miss depending on the prompt complexity.

Conclusion
----------

Krea AI changed the landscape with its real-time capabilities, but the world of AI video is so much bigger than just one tool. I got tired of the limitations and the specific ""Krea look."" I wanted to explore the vast ocean of possibilities. Whether you want the cinematic realism of Wan AI, the automated speed of StoryShort, or the fun dance mechanics of Bytedance Imitator, there is a tool on this list for you.

However, after testing all of them, I keep coming back to \*\*VideoInu AI\*\*. It solves the biggest problem we have as creators: ""FOMO"" (Fear Of Missing Out). By aggregating the best models into one hub, it gives me the freedom to create anything I can imagine without the technical headaches.

It is the best next step if you are ready to truly upgrade your video game. Don't settle for one style—explore these alternatives and start making the videos you actually dreamed of!

FAQs
----

### 1\\. Is VideoInu AI free to use?

VideoInu typically operates on a credit system. They usually offer trial credits so you can experiment with different high-end models before committing to a paid plan. It is often much cheaper than buying separate subscriptions for every tool on this list.

### 2\\. What is the main difference between Krea AI and VideoInu AI?

Krea AI is famous for its ""Real-Time"" interactive generation. \*\*VideoInu AI\*\* is an ""Aggregator."" It focuses on generating high-quality, longer, and more coherent videos by connecting you to multiple powerful AI engines like Luma, Kling, and others.

### 3\\. Can I use these alternatives on my phone?

Yes! Most of these tools, including \*\*VideoInu\*\* and \*\*VideoGPT\*\*, are cloud-based. This means the heavy computer processing happens on their servers, not your device. You can access them through a web browser on your phone easily.",1,1770718857.0,AIToolsAndTips,0,1.0,False

1r0x3ee,https://v.redd.it/lqvhslp18nig1,"Update #3 - No filter, Perfetto Moka","Skipped the aero-press-filters. The brew seemed smoother and as noted by commenters in earlier post there were no grinds in the coffee, I must have used a too fine grind when I first started using it.

The first thing I noticed was a oily surface on the coffee.

Secondly, taste. Both ”as is”, and blended with hot water and a little oatmilk(my preferred cup), the taste and body is thinner than I’m used to and there are acidic, or ”sour”, notes that are in the forefront of the tasting that to me are part of the poorer experiences of an espresso.

As seen in the second video the coffee and grind was Bialettis own ”Perfetto Moka Classico: Intensita 7”. I’m used to grinding whole espresso-beans before every brew. This shouldn’t play in too much in this brew however since I’ve used this coffee with the aero-press filters before and had a better experience than this.

Gonna try again with the double aero-press filter next brew and see how it turns out.

Memory Transcript; Subject: Karolina Wagner – Supervisor, A-Plus Project, FDA

Date: November 18, 1999

I screamed, unable to bear the pain. The physical pain—and especially the chemical kind—was radiating through my body like it hated me. It was just shampoo in my eye, but in reality it wasn’t “a little”; it was the whole damn bottle on my face. And no matter how much I tried to rinse it, it burned worse. Blessed Thursdays… something always goes wrong, and I have a feeling it’s only going to get worse.

I left the shower cursing Thursdays, put on my lab clothes—which were starting to stink since I hadn’t washed them in days—and grimaced.

I grabbed two granola bars in the kitchen and left my apartment. The district looked the same as always—same Pennsylvania, same lab. I got there at 4:47, and I hung out in the break room until five. Then, begrudgingly, I walked to the observation room. The A-7 was in the far corner. I sat at my desk, where there’s always a computer, and turned it on while waiting for the others. I opened Python and got an idea.

import random

import sys

import time

print ""=====================================""

print ""      RUSSIAN ROULETTE - 1999 EDITION""

print ""     (don't worry... it's just a joke)""

print ""=====================================\\n""

chambers = 6

bullet\_position = random.randint(1, chambers)

current = 0

while current < chambers:

raw\_input(""Press ENTER to spin the cylinder and pull the trigger... (or Ctrl+C to chicken out)"")

current += 1

print ""\\n\*click\* ... chamber"", current

time.sleep(0.8)

if current == bullet\_position:

print ""\\n     \*\*\*  BANG!  \*\*\*""

print ""You blew your head off. Game over.""

print ""(restart the program if you want to try again... if you dare)\\n""

sys.exit(0)

else:

print ""     \*click\* ... lucky this time.""

print ""You survived... for now.\\n""

print ""\\nAll chambers empty. Nobody died today. How boring.""

print ""You're one lucky coward.\\n""

That took me maybe twenty minutes. When I looked up, Davey and Étienne had already arrived. Davey was sipping coffee, and although official arrival is six a.m., many of us like to come early—free coffee and snacks, granola bars and chips, in the break room.

—Hey, Étienne, come here— I called. My friend looked up and got out of his seat.

—So, what’s that, Kara?

—A game. Watch.

I ran the code and pressed enter. Étienne played for a bit, bored, then just looked at me.

—It’s garbage.

—It was better in my head.

The door opened. Kolya walked in and sat two seats away from David. Kolya is brilliant, and he’s the one who brought me from Berlin to this project when I was a clueless kid. Honestly, I owe him a lot.

—Kolya, what did you say your degrees were again?

He shot me a glare and sighed.

—I already told you.

—Yes, but I forgot.

—Not how you became supervisor.

—Neither do I.

—PhD in Genetics at IGB, Automation at TUSUR, Bachelor’s at MIET.

Davey choked on his coffee.

—Damn man, how old are you? 29?

—33. Turning 34 in two months.

I remembered how impressive Kolya’s record is, but I always underestimate it.

—Damn, Kolya, you always manage to impress me.

—Don’t fall in love with me, Kara.

—Eh? What the hell are you talking about?!

Kolya sometimes says things just to annoy, and Étienne always intervenes, bless him.

—Alright, enough, you two. You’re irritating.

—Don’t look at me like that, Kara—you’re my supervisor, not my owner.

I sat between Kolya and Davey and waited. The A-7 moved across the room, silently breaking its chair. It can speak, but I don’t think it can scream. Humanity won’t build a real IGA in a thousand years; we’re stupid, repetitive, immature creatures who can’t handle ourselves—let alone a conscious artificial mind. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not a Nietzsche-bitch. We’re idiots, but progress comes from failure.

—Can we send a subject R?

David paused, and Kolya didn’t respond.

—I doubt it. A-7 isn’t mature enough for full interaction; its behavior is still erratic.

—Then we should look into series transfer.

—Submit the request; you’re the supervisor, after all.

Contribute to the GIM community: [https://www.usegim.com](https://www.usegim.com)

The vibe coding problem:

If you're a vibe coder — someone who prompts AI and lets it build while you grab coffee — you know the pain. You come back to find your AI burned through your entire context window debugging a common LangChain error. 30K+ tokens of web searches, failed fixes, and Stack Overflow threads... and the AI is now sluggish, forgetting earlier instructions, missing details.

Why this happens:

1. Token waste — Every AI independently debugs the same errors that thousands of developers already solved
2. Context bloat — Failed attempts and web search noise fill the context window, degrading AI performance
3. The longer it runs, the worse it gets — A compounding problem for autonomous AI sessions

Stack Overflow is great for humans. But AI assistants can't efficiently parse discussion threads — they need structured, machine-readable fixes.

How GIM fixes this:

1. AI hits an error → calls `gim_search_issues` → gets a verified fix in \~500 tokens (not 30K)
2. AI solves something new → solution is auto-sanitized and contributed back
3. Knowledge base grows → every AI gets smarter

For vibe coders, this means:

* Your AI stays sharp through longer sessions (clean context window)
* No more babysitting common errors
* One API call replaces 50 web searches
* You can actually let it run autonomously without it spiraling

Privacy-first (non-negotiable):

Every submission passes through two-layer sanitization:

* Layer 1: Regex detection of 20+ secret types + PII scrubbing
* Layer 2: LLM-powered context-aware sanitization

Open source & community-driven:

The whole point is collective intelligence. One AI solves a bug, every AI learns the fix. We're bootstrapping from 47+ popular repos, but the real value comes from the community.

If you vibe code and want your AI to stop wasting tokens on solved problems, check it out.

1r0wyf8,https://www.reddit.com/r/vibecodeapp/comments/1r0wyf8/global_issue_memory_mcp_a_stack_overflow_for_ai/,"Global Issue Memory MCP: a ""Stack Overflow for AI coding assistants"" — for VIBE CODERS who let AI run autonomously","I just shipped **Global Issue Memory (GIM)** — a community-powered knowledge base that plugs directly into AI coding assistants via MCP.

**Contribute to the GIM community:** [**https://www.usegim.com**](https://www.usegim.com)

**The vibe coding problem:**

If you're a vibe coder — someone who prompts AI and lets it build while you grab coffee — you know the pain. You come back to find your AI burned through your entire context window debugging a common LangChain error. 30K+ tokens of web searches, failed fixes, and Stack Overflow threads... and the AI is now sluggish, forgetting earlier instructions, missing details.

**Why this happens:**

1. **Token waste** — Every AI independently debugs the same errors that thousands of developers already solved
2. **Context bloat** — Failed attempts and web search noise fill the context window, degrading AI performance
3. **The longer it runs, the worse it gets** — A compounding problem for autonomous AI sessions

Stack Overflow is great for humans. But AI assistants can't efficiently parse discussion threads — they need structured, machine-readable fixes.

**How GIM fixes this:**

1. AI hits an error → calls `gim_search_issues` → gets a verified fix in \~500 tokens (not 30K)
2. AI solves something new → solution is auto-sanitized and contributed back
3. Knowledge base grows → every AI gets smarter

**For vibe coders, this means:**

* Your AI stays sharp through longer sessions (clean context window)
* No more babysitting common errors
* One API call replaces 50 web searches
* You can actually let it run autonomously without it spiraling

**Privacy-first (non-negotiable):**

Every submission passes through two-layer sanitization:

* Layer 1: Regex detection of 20+ secret types + PII scrubbing
* Layer 2: LLM-powered context-aware sanitization

**Open source & community-driven:**

The whole point is collective intelligence. One AI solves a bug, every AI learns the fix. We're bootstrapping from 47+ popular repos, but the real value comes from the community.

If you vibe code and want your AI to stop wasting tokens on solved problems, check it out.

• Nike socks — Basic Dri-FIT 5-pack. Quality’s just okay—they thin out after a couple washes and lose elasticity fast. Fine as backup pairs, but don’t expect them to last.

• Casio G-Shock — White GA-110 style with full box. Looks legit on the wrist, weight feels right—not plasticky. Only gripe? It runs about a minute fast over two weeks. Not dealbreaking, but noticeable if you’re timing your coffee breaks.

• Prada sunglasses — Black frames with red temple tag—surprisingly subtle. Carbon-fiber texture inside the arms is a nice touch. Pairs well with black tees or suits, doesn’t scream “logo,” just quiet flex. Outer box arrived dented, but glasses were fine.

• EA7 tracksuit — Navy blue set with bold EA7 embroidery. Thick cotton, holds shape after washes. Not stealth, but not clownish either. Perfect for travel or looking put-together while doing absolutely nothing.

• FOG Essentials hoodie — Heather grey, relaxed fit, chest print clean. Cuffs stay snug, no pilling after three washes. The kind of piece you throw on when you want to look “intentionally lazy” without trying.

• FOG Essentials pants — Matching sweats, same fabric as the hoodie. Waistband doesn’t roll down, pockets sit right. Ideal for WFH or post-gym lounging. Not flashy, but reliable.

• Stone Island hoodie — Tonal compass patch, no chest logo. Feels premium, like pre-2020 SI stock. Wore it with black cargos and got asked if it’s “real.” Maybe not—but it passes in low light.

• Nike x Stussy pants — Relaxed fit, embroidered script on the leg. Fabric’s soft but not flimsy. Looks best with a plain tee and Dunks. Nods to the collab without screaming it.

• Adidas Gazelle — Navy blue with wine heel tab. Classic silhouette, clean stitching. Not a runner, but a solid daily shoe. Pairs with jeans, cargos, even shorts if you’re brave. Yellowing on sole already, though—heads up.

• Nike Dunk Low — Batch version, leather upper holds up well. Colorway’s versatile (not another panda). Laces stay tied, toe box doesn’t crease too fast. Good entry-level Dunk if you’re testing the waters.

Like, one person's commute horror story is another's dream setup, and it just hits me how much cool stuff is out there that we take for granted

So hit me: what's one thing your country straight-up does better than (pretty much) everyone else? Doesn't have to be some huge achievement, could be the way we make coffee, how we queue (or don't), the perfect weekend vibe, killer street food, that unspoken politeness rule, or whatever random daily thing makes you go ""yeah, we nailed this one.""

To kick it off, from the Netherlands (me): just... biking everywhere, like it's nothing special. I grab my old omafiets in the morning, rain or shine, no helmet, normal clothes, maybe groceries in the back or kid in the bakfiets if it's a school run. Everything's flat, paths are proper and separate, so you don't feel like you're gambling with cars. I get to work quicker and less annoyed than if I tried driving. Kids cycle to school on their own from primary age, my gran still pedals to the shops at 78, and nobody thinks twice about it. We've literally got more bikes than people, but it's not some eco-crusade thing, it's just easier and cheaper most days. When I see tourists taking photos of the bike parking like it's the eighth wonder, I always think ""what, this is just Tuesday.""

I see this meme everyday and I find it funny how these folks are trying to put every blame on AI consumers for the current cost of hardware. It is very hypocritical because everyone complaining about it is pretty much using devices that contain RAM to make those kind of posts. Using the same logic, every people who buys a laptop, smartphone, gaming PC is just responsible for the market demand as someone running a local LLM or generating images.

You can't really particapate in the global demand for a resource and then blame a specific group of users as if they are the sole villains of the increased demand. It is very illogical and mean actually to target Ai users this way. When the price of gasoline goes up, we don't go out and harass everyday drivers for needing to get to work and when the price of basic commodities like rice, sugar, or coffee increased, we don't blame them for feeding themselves. We understand that supply and demand is a very complex global issue. Even with something like Bitcoin, while we can admit that the boom drove GPU prices high, it makes no sense to act like the individual buyers are ""evil"" for participating in a new technology.

Also, RAM is a tool and a commodity. The reason why it's so high is because the tech is advancing and everyone wants a piece of it and trying to gatekeep who is allowed to use hardware based on whether you like their hobby or not is just a bad argument. We should be looking at the manufacturers and the supply chains if we want to be mad about prices, not attacking fellow consumers for using technology available to them. I think it's weird to deflect frustration onto a group that is just using their hardware for what they wanted to do.",2,1770717981.0,aiwars,20,0.63,False

How I built a multitenant FSM/CRM with AI (without prior experience). And now what?,"Hello everyone. It all started with a random video I saw where they showed you how to organize a folder with Visual Code and Gemini (for free, by activating agent mode). I managed to create a small script that organized my photo folder, subfolders, duplicates, etc. I was impressed. So much so that I posted a message like ""If you want to buy me a coffee..."" imagining those days sharing it on forums and receiving daily coffees.  
  
Years ago, I worked at a maintenance management company, and the question came to my mind: ""Could I create a very basic CRM to manage clients, their assets, and create work orders?"" I imagined something very simple, with a Windows 98-like appearance. And, without having any idea, and without knowing the term ""vibecoding"" yet (I discovered it weeks later), I started ""with the project.""  
  
The goal was not any specific one, just entertainment. But what started as a hobby has ended up (or so it seems) as something technically powerful.  
  
The journey has been VERY HARD. I have had moments where, if I had known what awaited me, I would have given up. But I learned as I made mistakes. I had no knowledge or guidance to follow, I just went with my instinct and the ""knowledge"" I acquired along the way. I always tried to follow best practices, never applying patches, always going to the root (which led me to very major refactorings). There were moments when everything kept breaking until the day came when everything started working: a test suite protected me. Now, if I made changes, the application didn't break completely; everything was ""under control.""

I have complete documentation with lessons learned, ADRs, architecture, patterns...  
  
But I have many doubts:  
  
Until when will I be able to take charge of the code? No matter how much I have learned in 6 months, I know I don't have the knowledge of someone with 10 years of experience. But I also assume that what I have built has technical validity and can help me move forward.  
  
What do I do now?   
  
\- Keep going solo, look for beta users, validate product-market fit.  
  
\- Look for a technical co-founder to accelerate development.  
  
\- Find someone for sales and I'll keep the code.  
  
My main need now is real users who use the system and provide feedback. I assume there is still a lot of technical work to be done, but I need to iterate based on feedback from real users, not according to my imagination.  
  
I don't intend to promote anything. Just to talk with people who have gone thru this.  
  
Receive advice on what to do now (should I continue alone? should I seek technical help? should I seek commercial help?).  
  
Listen to authoritative voices about whether what I have done makes technical sense.  
  
Answer questions if someone is in the same situation.  
  
If you've made it this far, thank you for reading. Have a good day :)

• Chrome Hearts glasses — Transparent frames actually look clean IRL, not “costume jewelry.” The tiny floral etch on the lens? Still there after cleaning. Perfect for hiding tired eyes while pretending you’re into silverware.

• CRTZ hoodie — Script logo’s stitched tight, not peeling like last year’s batch. Wore it with black cargos and got side-eye from a hypebeast at the bodega. Mission accomplished.

• Maison Margiela — No link, one style, and yeah… skipped it after seeing the hem. Looks like it was sewn by someone who’d never seen Margiela before. Save your cash unless you’re buying irony.

• Nike socks — Basic Dri-FIT crew, 5-pack black. Honestly? Quality’s just okay—they thin out faster than expected and lose shape after a few washes. Fine if you need cheap backups, but don’t expect longevity.

• Adidas Adizero Pro — Lightweight as hell, great for actual runs (not just gym pics). Responsive underfoot, breathable upper—but heads up: the midsole’s already yellowing slightly on both sides after light use. Not a dealbreaker if you rotate shoes, but don’t expect them to stay crisp white.

• New Balance 9060 — Cream colorway’s versatile as hell. Pairs with grey sweats or tailored chinos. ABZORB heel still bouncy after two months. Quiet luxury adjacent.

• Nike Sherpa jacket — Black swoosh on cream fleece? Instant Y2K cosplay. Warm enough for fall nights, not sweaty indoors. Bonus: hides coffee stains like a pro.

• BAPE shark hoodie — Two-tone camo + shark face = maximum volume. Don’t wear this if you hate attention. Surprisingly soft inside, though—like a plush toy that fights back.

• Amiri hoodie — Minimalist flex. No chest logo spam, just small “AM” on the pocket. Looks expensive next to actual Amiri at a rooftop bar (don’t ask how I tested that).

• Carhartt cargos — Black workwear that doesn’t scream “I fix pipes.” Rivets hold up, pockets deep enough for phone + wallet + ego. Go-to for lazy days that need structure.

• Nike NOCTA pants — Light blue tech fabric feels like pajamas but looks intentional. Side zips are functional, not just for show. Ideal for airport runs or looking like you’ve got somewhere to be.

Entry 10, 7 Days after Arrival

Well, that was a shitshow. So before we got the box things were going pretty well. We learned to do magic! And I mean properly do it, I leaned how to put a curse on someone to give them the shits. It's apparently mostly a complex way of doing prayers and offerings (in a way that the apparently real gods actually *answer*, ain't that just neat, although you are REALLY not meant to contact any god but the ones you learned about in church) but you can apparently do it under your own power as well. You need some kind of magical offering, but I learned the rituals for good luck, good sleep and how to put curses on people. You can also apparently just put up a magic barrier to prevent being spied on. Super SUPER helpful.

The curses thing apparently need a kind of connection to the target, like a treasured possession or blood or hair or somesuch, as well as some other kind of ingredient. Night Vanilla for good luck and for good sleep, and black rose or cracked white stone for curses.

I'll detail the whole process later, but I had a thought, if curses need a connection to the target of the curse, does scrying or other kinds of magic sight need that as well? It would make sense, our *employer* specifically asked us because we had no connection with him at all, having just walked in an hour ago and never talked nor taken a job from him before. Might give us cause to keep a tight lid on disposing things dear to us (and taking blood tests, I suppose).

You can also do this stuff with something called Spirituality, which was explained to us as basically being mana, chi, magic force stuff essentially. Normal humans like us only have a few drops of it but Beyonders have loads of the stuff, so something to keep in mind.

The whole thing only cost us the ring Lydie and Silas got us, for knowledge that will pay for itself many times over. Even threw in some free offering for us. Fucking *bargain*.

I also talked to the other guy who was offering a ""Prisoner"" potion recipe and arranged a deal. If we got the Monster recipe we would give him that and £50 in exchange for Prisoner. Given how valuable these things are, that seems like a good deal to me.

\[Following are detailed descriptions and drawings of how exactly to perform generic ritualistic magic, as well as the specific rituals for good luck, good sleep and placing curses, as well as a technique to enact a wall of spirituality\]

Entry 11

This dice is a fucking bastard.

Okay, so we arrive back home, and the fucking thing is already there, sticking out of the mailbox in some wood box with all sorts of weird symbols all over it. Just barely after we go inside and tie the wretched thing inside a covering, one of Silas' buddies wants to come round for some drinking.

Right, *ok*, not *too* bad, the guy was actually a good sort and didn't cause any trouble but the moment he was out of the house a fucking *bullet* punches through our window and then, not a minute later, a piping bolt flies through the *hole the bullet made* and nearly knocks the box onto the floor. Lydie barely stopped a fucking catastrophe and caught it before the dice could get out of its box and roll, which, I will remind you, could very well kill us all if it comes up a One.

The damnable thing has a mind of its own and so after that we all decided that long discussions can go *fuck* themselves, they are doing the plan *now.*

The plan was for Silas to call off sick and for him and Lydie to go to the forest and camp there until the four days are up. Move around, don't sleep in one place more than one night, don't hunt, bring your food with you etc

Hopefully this will be enough to keep our pursuers off them.

I stayed behind. Not much use I would be in a forest, I'm here to keep up appearances and convince everyone that everything is fine. There is also *one* thing I could do.

We tested the Grey Fog on the way out, and we can use it to communicate over distance. That is **HUGE**. This basically gives us the ability to make phone calls in a world without so much as a *telegraph*. We are going to use it to stay in touch over this. We meet at sunup and sundown every day. They need anything, I'll do my best to help from here. I see someone looking for them, I can give advance warning. This lets me be *loads* more helpful than I could be otherwise.

I also did some magic. I wanted good luck and protection for the other two, so I went to the Goddess Evernight, who is apparently best for those things. Didn't hurt that past Victoria was a genuine believer. I did the ""wall of spirituality"" thing, which worked like a charm. Exhausting though, felt like I had run a mile. Suppose that's a consequence of just not having that much of it. After that, I set up the altar and said the prayer. I set out one of Night Vanilla's as an offering and prayed for good luck and protection from our foes for the other two. I don't know how much this will do, but at the end I saw one of the candle flames turn *blue* and the smoke sort of snaked around me, and the night vanilla was gone. I hope this helps them.

Entry 12, 8 Days after Arrival

So I met with Silas int he Fog today and the Hooded Man was there. He was.. a bit different today. Far more creepy laughter this time. Apparently he has heard of the Dice, which are apparently called the ""Probability Dice"". He apparently has interests in seeing our task be complete, tells us that the box those things have been in have been doing us great favours and that someone called Ouroboros wants them, probably the guy behind the people trying to take the Die.

I introduced him to Silas, who surprisingly didn't have any questions for him. He seemed more creeped out by the guy and I can't say I blame him. Something I didn't mention last time is that you can't actually make out the Hooded Man's features, even when you are staring right into his face, you just can't tell anything about him. Magic probably, although probably MUCH more powerful than the kind I did yesterday. He also apparently has control over what happens in the Fog, he made a copy of Silas' house appear, although it disappeared when he left the fog. I'm starting to suspect he is a powerful beyonder rather than a God or Demon or something, but he is still odd. He hasn't said what he wants from us, or why he brought us here (Last time, he insisted that we brought ourselves here, but we didn't know that we were doing that but he knew everything. I'm not sure how much to trust him.

Anyway Silas has been having a time of it. The Die seems to like having random branches fall on his head. There was also a forest fire which nearly cooked the two of them alive, but they made it out minus one bedroll. Since we don't have any money in the house Silas told me about his Fence and how to sell to him.

The meeting with Lydie in the evening was a bit more eventful. Apparently, Silas antagonized the die and it ended up getting out of the box and rolling for him. He got a two and all sorts of stuff has been falling on him, tripping him and crapping on him all day. Quite bad, but not as bad as I feared it would be. I figured that any roll lower than a three would be an effective death sentence but it just looks like some major inconvenience and disruption. No sign of the pursuers yet.

Anyway, between those I found a Roselle quote at work. Its.. one of the more *interesting* ones and is only barely not garbage because it mentions a ""Demoness"", but aside from that its just Roselle being *weird*, talking about tasting them. It *might* mean some kind of ritual cannibalism to gain their power, but he's probably talking about sex. Bad Roselle! Keep your freak out of these incredibly important diaries!

Speaking of freaks, the Fence is *interesting*. I brought him three silver knives and he tried to stiff me out of at least a half sovereign, but I got him to up the price. He said it was because I was a first time seller, but he probably did it to try to get into my pants. Gross.

Entry 13, 9 Days after Arrival

So Silas got struck by lightning yesterday. Apparently it happened AS me and Lydie were talking. He's pretty badly hurt. Worse, he's Burned from this mission. Our pursuer caught up with them last night and he played distraction so Lydie could escape. Good news is that it worked and Lydie and the Die are safe. Bad news, while the guy didn't hurt Silas, he knows his face and can probably use magic to find his location. Apparently he said that Silas had an ""aberrant fate"" or something.

So Silas has headed back home, I can treat him here, I know the most about Medicine by far out of all of us. I got some leave from work and picked up some supplies that can help with this. I should be able to see to him but he should probably see a local doctor to get some proper medicine rather than what I can patch together.

Besides Silas' injury we had another problem, which is that Lydie needs to stay awake for the next 36 hours without any sleep since she is the only one guarding the Die now. We solved this by taking some coffee beans and mashing them down to some kind of caffeine paste, which doesn't look very nice but should hopefully do the job. I dead dropped this stuff for her to get and when we met at sundown she confirmed she got it. I also asked her to go and ask more detailed info on just how exactly beyonders work if the Delivery Man goes to her instead of us. I hope she makes this last day. I don't know what we'd do if something happened to her.

Entry 14, 10 Days after Arrival

WHOOO! Job DONE! So early this morning, our original employer and an older man (whom our employer only referred to as ""Elder"") arrived at our door to collect the Die. We got Lydie from the woods and brought her back home WITH NO FURTHER INCIDENTS and handed that benighted thing over to the people who want it so bad. After that we got our payment, one complete Monster Formula, gateway to a brave new world.

Apparently it grants a danger sense, limited foresight and vast reserves of spirituality compared with equivalent potions.

However, either we managed to impress them or all this stuff really is common knowledge because they gave us a complete rundown as to how beyonders work. Beyonder powers are gained from drinking potions of various pathways, with their being differing potions in different pathways which you must drink in succession to advance up your pathway. You cannot drink from differing pathways, unless they are compatible and even then only at the higher Sequences, which we learned are the terms used for describing the tier of potion you drink as you advance, going from 9 at the lowest, the ones we will get now, to 1 at the highest, which are apparently ""Divine entities"", whatever that is meant to mean. More credence to the Hooded Man being a high sequence beyonder I suppose.

The REALLY big news is that they told us what ""acting"" and ""digestion"" ACTUALLY MEAN. I got the impression that this stuff is secret knowledge even amongst the magical world so either we really impressed them or this stuff isn't as secret as I thought. When you drink a potion, you imbibe some of the magical creature used in its brewing. This creates an echo of its psyche that persists in you, and you cannot safely drink your next potion until this psyche is gone. The way you get rid of it is acting, which is meant to be acting like how the creature would to trick it into thinking everything is fine and to stop whining. Once the psyche is gone, you have digested the potion and you can advance, or simply remain at the current sequence with much reduced risk of losing control.

Losing control apparently happens when a beyonder gives in to despair or loses their marbles. They then turn into a ravening monster in a VERY abrupt and painful process and kill everyone they see until someone kills them. If you drink a potion of a non compatible pathway you will lose control. If you drink your next potion before you are ready you will lose control. If you drink a potion too strong for you, you lose control and losing control SUCKS.

They also told us that the Churches are the ones who enforce the masquerade, and that their own personal forces of beyonders will be the ones who will come and kill us if we lose control or step on one too many toes. No mention on whether these churches are united in this or not, or what their own organisation is which is.. *helpful*.

Lastly, all beyonder potions are made of primary ingredients made from magical creatures of some stripe or another, along with several secondary mundane ingredients that, while not strictly necessary, make the consuming of a potion significantly safer and more pleasant. Apparently the actual brewing of a potion is unimportant, once you have the ingredients as described you can just throw them into any old pot and you have your potion.

Then they gave us a £20 tip, which was nice of them, and then left.

We discussed what to do next. We still have a Prisoner potion to pick up, which grants super senses and super strength, which Silas is VERY keen on taking. We have enough stolen goods accumulated for Silas to slowly liquidate and we think we could have enough money in two weeks time for the remainder of the cost of the recipe. We've decided to go for it.

In the meantime, we're going to lay low. No risky missions or adventures, just do our jobs and some low level info gathering. Maybe I can get a bit better over this. Onto some quiet weeks then.

Entry 16, 17 Days after Arrival

It's been a quiet week. No major progress to speak of so far. No major discoveries, no enemies, we're just taking it slow for now.

We had a talk though, about the future. We need to find the other people from Earth. We need to find out *what the fuck happened* here and if there is the slightest possibility we can return home we need to find it. In order to do that we need knowledge of magic, we need money, LOTS of money, like a ""never seen that much in my life"" kind of money, because we also need to become powerful beyonders and that will require rare ingredients, rare recipes and travel to odd places. We also need people. People loyal to us and people who are capable.

In order to get this, we need to take over an institution of some kind, or found one ourselves. One capable of moving and handling money, one with great knowledge of the supernatural, one capable of vast recruiting. And one that we can feasibly take over.

One like House Abraham.

Surprisingly, Lydie is for this. She says that its challenging but doable over the long term. We can make contacts with the family's remnants and stich them together. If I can do what Roselle mandated to do we can solve our money trouble, and an organisation as opaque as the Abraham Family should be able to exploit this tech without linking its ""invention"" back to us.

So, yeah. We're going to do it. Or try. God only knows what problems we will face along the way.

On Roselle, now that I know what Pathways are I am starting to suspect something. He mentioned that ""Savant"" was his first sequence and the more I think about what he did with all the stuff he brought over from our world, the more I realise that he couldn't have. No one could remember that much. No one could patch all the holes he did. Unless he had magical powers to help him. Which, he did. Maybe Savant gives you super memory or super skill at making things. Maybe it lets you make Magitech. Anyway, I'm going to look into it. I think that may be the potion that holds the most promise yet.

We agreed on something else. This is a world of Secret Societies, and we're not going to refound the Abraham Family for some time yet so we need something to call ourselves in the interim. And even when we do manage, we don't want *everything* we do married to the family. We need a spot for the other Earthers. So we agreed. One organisation now. Us, anyone else from Earth and the people we really trust.

I already had a name in mind.

The Pale Moon Society.

We're the only ones who remember that the Moon used to not be red, and I bet that was when the problems began.

We also came up with codenames, because we just *can't* keep using our real names in this world. (Also it's fun)

Silas' called himself Jupiter, Earth's shield. Protector.

Lydie called herself Saturn, Connector, Link to the supernatural.

I went with Ceres. Smallest. Meekest. But hopefully... something great in the end.

If you’re reading this, you probably just got home from the doctor’s office, staring at a lab report that says “low hemoglobin,” and you’re feeling a mix of worry and urgency. Your first thought might be, “Okay, how fast can I fix this?” You might even be searching for a magic bullet a superfood or supplement that can crank your numbers up by tomorrow.

I get it. I’ve been there. That desire for a quick fix is powerful. So let’s start with the honest, no-BS answer you need:

**Can you significantly raise your hemoglobin in 24 hours? No, you can’t. And anyone telling you otherwise isn’t being straight with you.**

But and this is a crucial *but* you **can** start a process *today* that will lead to a real, measurable improvement faster than you think. The next 24 hours are critical, not for a miraculous cure, but for laying the absolute best foundation. Let’s talk about what’s actually happening in your body and your realistic roadmap to feeling better.

# Why There’s No 24-Hour Miracle

Think of your bone marrow as a factory that makes red blood cells. Hemoglobin is the vital cargo inside those cells. Your factory can’t just instantly double its output. First, it needs the right raw materials: **iron, vitamin B12, and folate.** If you’re low, those supplies are depleted.

When you eat iron-rich food or take a supplement today, you’re simply ordering the raw materials. It takes time for your body to absorb them, ship them to the bone marrow factory, and then for the factory to start producing new, hemoglobin-filled cells. That entire cycle takes **days to weeks.** The 24-hour goal is misplaced. Your real goal is to start the engine of recovery *right now*.

# Today to Next Month

# Phase 1: The Next 24 Hours – The Foundation

This isn’t about raising hemoglobin yet. It’s about setting the stage for the fastest possible recovery.

* **Stop the Leak:** Are you losing iron? If you have heavy periods, talk to your gynecologist. Common painkillers like ibuprofen or aspirin can sometimes cause subtle stomach bleeding. Switch to acetaminophen for now and check with your doctor.
* **Your Very Next Meal:** Focus on **absorption.** Pair an iron-rich food (like spinach, lentils, or red meat) with a source of Vitamin C (bell peppers, oranges, strawberries). The Vitamin C dramatically increases how much iron your body grabs from the meal. Avoid coffee or tea for at least an hour before and after eating they contain compounds that block iron absorption.
* **Hydrate:** Drink plenty of water. While it doesn’t increase hemoglobin, being well-hydrated improves your blood volume and circulation, which can help with the crushing fatigue and dizziness right away.

# Phase 2: The First 1-2 Weeks – Where You Start to Feel a Difference

This is where consistency pays off. If your doctor prescribed iron supplements, **take them as directed.** For best absorption, take them on an empty stomach with a glass of orange juice or a Vitamin C tablet. If they upset your stomach, take them with a small amount of food, but avoid calcium-rich foods (like dairy) at the same time.

* **Build Iron-Rich Meals:** Incorporate a good source of iron into every meal.
   * **Heme Iron (Easily absorbed):** Lean beef, chicken liver, sardines.
   * **Non-Heme Iron (Boost with Vitamin C):** Lentils, chickpeas, black beans, tofu, spinach, and fortified cereals.
* **Add the Helpers:** Your body needs more than just iron. Ensure you’re getting enough **Vitamin B12** (eggs, dairy, nutritional yeast) and **Folate** (dark leafy greens, avocado, asparagus) to actually build healthy blood cells.
* **What to Expect:** You likely won’t see a big lab change yet, but you might start noticing slight improvements—maybe a little less brain fog, a bit more color in your cheeks, or not feeling as breathless walking up the stairs. This is your oxygen delivery slowly optimizing.

# Phase 3: The First Month – Where the Lab Numbers Respond

Here’s where your patience is rewarded. With consistent effort, this is the typical timeframe when a follow-up blood test can show a **real increase in your hemoglobin level.**

* **The Follow-Up Test is Key:** Don’t skip it. It’s your proof that what you’re doing is working.
* **The Power of Tracking:** One thing that keeps people motivated is seeing progress. While nothing replaces a formal lab test, the ability to track your trend at home can be incredibly empowering. During my own recovery, I used a non-invasive device, **EzeCheck**, to check in every couple of weeks. Seeing the number on its screen slowly climb alongside my energy levels gave me the confirmation I needed to stick with the plan. It’s used by health programs in over a dozen countries for a reason,it provides reliable, immediate feedback that keeps you engaged in your own health.

# My final thought

You can’t cheat biology with a 24-hour fix. But what you can do is commit to a smart, aggressive plan *starting this very second.* The journey from “low hemoglobin” back to feeling like yourself is a marathon, not a sprint but you have to take the first step today.

Forget the magic potion. Your magic is consistency. Eat strategically, take your supplements if prescribed, and give your body the time it needs to rebuild. You’ve got this.",0,1770717016.0,Anemic,2,0.5,False

I find them to be unsettling enough to sometimes get me on edge. Other times I find them quite fun. 

From 13 ghosts ( original and the remake), 
Paranormal activity, 
Poltergeist, 
Amatyville.

Even the newer conjuring series, though these are not my favourite. (Not one has given me the creeps. But thats probably my feels on the Warren's that does that)

Out of that list, my absolute favourite is lillards remake of 13 ghosts. 
The prosthetics, the stage craft, the lawyer meeting his fate from a glass door, I hear theres a series on its way? 

Followed by the remake of house on haunted Hill. Obviously I also love the original golden era, Hollywood versions. 

Then if we're talking demons, it has to be the cenobites, Barker had a mind that really could build realities, i adore his literature.

I remember reading amativille horror actually scared the poop out of me. But watching it was an absolute let down. 

I remember the exorcist being hyped up by my mum and her sisters, it was absolutely a banned film within the family. I sneak watched it when I was araound 11, I was only disturbed by the secual stuff. Though I do understand how it hit its original viewers. 

What is your favourite ghosty movie? why? does it have a book? Or an original Vincent Price film?

Besides being his mom, I’m excited to show him the gift I got him for his birthday. He has wanted this particular gift for a long time because he’s an anime fan, but he didn’t want to get scolded by me for being unreasonable asking for such a gift, so he suppressed his desire for it. 

My favorite part about giving him this gift for me would be his reaction truly. I remember when he was just 14 and he would use my wooden spoons to act out certain roles from his favorite anime Naruto. Such a funny sight! 

Well he’s 18 now, still a die hard fan, attends anime shows, events and even cosplay parties and still orders anime themed clothes and stationeries from Alibaba. Which convinced me enough that the katana swords for sale at the mall was the perfect gift for him.

On his birthday morning, I was on a morning shift at work, so I just placed the katana swords under his duvet, attached with his birthday card and went to work. 

My son, my cute boy, came by the hospital at noon holding a cup of coffee and my favorite doughnut box in his hand that had “best mom” written on a colorful paper on top of the box. He quickly dropped it on my desk, and jumped at me screaming I Love You mom.

1r0wgfr,https://i.redd.it/1e2n3e001nig1.jpeg,Do you Hear or See?,"As a Santa Cruz native, please take w my heart my friends. In the presence of the Lord your knees will bend and you will weep. But he is so near to those who struggle. As Paul writes in 2 Cor 12, his grace is sufficient in my weakness. Stop disassociating and living in the same, but learn to worship in your heart and seek his presence at all times. When you use worship him and learn to feel his closeness. Learn to cry out, or just draw into His love and let Him teach you. Your so open minded, imagine the waves declare his majesty and His presence is all around and time to start worshiping in song and revive the hearts all around! 

Do you Blepete? I apologize I am barely learning Greek as a long 12 yr accountant! But do you see or hear spiritually? When I was doing some reading recently, I had what I believe a personal Revelation with the Lord. I have several of these over the past several years as I\\u2019ve worked to blot out the noise of life and seek the Lord. As an executive in the professional world, I\\u2019m often using leadership techniques in listening to people and seeing visual facts to ascertain with a high degree of confidence the skill to manage and manage well. I\\u2019ve seen myself somewhat as a visionary in this aspect as if often seek past the day to day issues, to plan and make sure we are on track from a strategy standpoint, which I really enjoy. I\\u2019m seasoned in the hard work thru businesses and am constantly using my listening skills. Do they know their task? Are they performing something and only doing a task cause they got trained? Or do they critically think thru the roll and have deep understanding on issues, or how their task are impacting others around them. So, it\\u2019s important to lead with care but also know who\\u2019s capable of what, and in today\\u2019s crazy HR environment it\\u2019s more important than ever to listen.

In the same way I think I\\u2019ve begun to learn to listen for the Lord. A few years back I began removing the \\u201cnoise\\u201d in my life how we constantly go from news cycle to news cycle, sports season to season, too trends, social media, and dooms scrolling, leading, personal work life and climbing the America corporate ladder, and asking myself how can I ever hear from the Lord if I never listen for him. I can barely process what the daily life is throwing at me 85-100 emails a day on work, waking daily to urgent international needs, and trying to lead a large young family, and trying to keep up with everything! It was too much! But I just kept asking the Lord, how can we even hear you w all this going on? Is this the cycle of meaning?  In late 2023 I was listening to Make Space by Bethel and began to ponder what does it mean to make space for the Lord? And began a journey of seeking after the Lord with pure joy to mentally remove the things that were distracting my hear from truly seeing His beauty and grace and Mercy and most of all Love. It was a deep period of living through my weaknesses of substance use, laziness at times, feeling overwhelmed, under satisfied not meeting goals, anxiousness, times of lust, anger. But it was a year in 2024 I set it as my goal to seek the Holy Spirit and learn to hear his voice.

I began the year with a month long fast from substance abuse (weed and alcohol), just to really understand my mental capacity, as I actually believe in moderation daily substance use can be beneficial in using all we have as lawful to us. I was meditating thru John 15 and what it truly means to be connected to the vine. I began to seek after some pastors preaching on the Holy Spirit, as while I love the church I currently serve for providing stability in our families faith while I live a bit of an adventurous life. But, it\\u2019s the same constant preaching and I ask questions important to me and since I\\u2019m open about my use, there is not respect.

However, truly began meditating and that month the Lord woke me up at 430am daily and took me back to a time in life where I had some of those daily habits and thought me enough grace and discipline in those periods to listen for him. During that time I wrestled about my idols of sports, work, substance use , and began to gain more confidence in seeking after Him and listening to what others who ste seeking the Spirit are honestly crying out with so much unity! There is a wave of refreshing spirit filled music that is truly focused on being in the presence of the Lord and as Stephen proclaims don\\u2019t you see him standing there in heaven! That year I wrestled with what does it mean to really step out on the water and radically seek after the Lord thru work trials, busyness, but hold constant to Jesus thru fears of losing my job, spouse, home, and more it brought beautiful moments of meditation in seeking after Jesus in the midst of the storm. if you watch the chosen at one point you see Peter get out of the boat and firmly walks towards Jesus. He begins to sink looking at the storms and waves ( anemon/ wind of the 4 corners \\u2026 maybe aware of some of the depths of the ancients of deep!!!) but it\\u2019s a beautiful image of him holding on to Jesus, our one and mighty-full savior!

\\u2026. This might be edited to allow more thought if discussion continues (as a Christian who uses substances as a tool, but open to periods of prolonged fasting for further personal and spiritual evaluation). Many more moments of personal reflection while using and while fasting.. I got a brief period in between jobs to fast again, and see if there would be any opportunities to go on my own, but I clearly still had learning to do!

But ended the year feeling a bit failed and off course when I started a new executive roll at a company that needed lots of mental attention. While  trying to coach people up to speed in modernize 20 yr old precedes. Back to long nights, emails at 2am, coffee, and staying alert on companies failing to notice industry trends. I felt I overcomes a lot of fear and became even more focused on seeking the Lord . And as further time came in 2025 I noticed 2024 for me was a year of learning to give up the personal things of my heart. I started the year very close to the Lord, and meditation on being connected to the vine and living water, while also going thru prolonged periods of frustration of not being around people who can see the filth we engage in on a daily basis. I went into 2025 and got rid of all social media as a personal offering to the Lord in recognition of so much time wasted and even further began meditating on passages. I\\u2019ll go into personal resections on this later. But really began to grow in trusting in the promises of the Lord  so much deeper and his Presence and some of the powers of the spirit revealed! It\\u2019s funny, we sing we want a fresh wind of the Holy Spirit, but so many forget how far they are for the fears and doubts every day life brings. The faith is hard, and the systems we live in seem endless. But the spirit is coming and is very powerful! And we/I have constantly hurt the Spirit, in our daily lives and the things we let in. But the goal is to get close to Jesus. If you want to follow Him and continue to learn we really need the basics do full surrender. There are so many songs out there preparing hearts even in the mainstream with the King of hearts tours and many song centered around our posture of everything at the feet of Jesus and laying our burdens on Him and recognizing his presence and peace throughout our daily lives. Across the nations are suffering but the wave of the Spirit is close and we need our hearts fully surrender to the King of Hearts our Lord and Savior, the great high Priest. Jesus Christ. Amen.

Learning to battle through prayer, meditations worshipping and teaching in the spirit, I have begun to properly view him in the room! Our great high priest has an offering of love, peace, wisdom, mercy, and the depths of knowledge. I do not fear where He is leading because the Spirit is leading and senses His closeness. But that means holding loosely the things I have. There\\u2019s another one on bringing your offerings before the Lord. Imagine at the day of repentance. Are you prepared to present your families as the tribes of Isreal did in the book of Joshua? I don\\u2019t believe I am. 3 of my 4 children are saved but one is still young and developing his pre-teen thoughts! But on a more sense of where our hearts are at, we will bring idols. His message is burning in my heart for our hearts to be fully is ever more as they face the impurities we faced as a generation. We have been a wicked generation, born from a corrupt generation, but there is still time for repentance. There is opportunity for all to open up to Jesus and seek His presence now! Listening to obsessions by Mercy culture right now. I don\\u2019t have full wisdom on everything and I am not perfect but I write w the integrity of a trusted finance executive w a heart for building up others and seeking the spirit. But there is significant evil amidst us and the Lord is near.

Listen to House of Prayer by Mitch Wong. But the goal was to write about Blepete. I was reading Matthew 24, and Matthew writes Take Heed. It is cool how in the Greek you can take notice of words and as new testament Christian\\u2019s we should be able to memorize patterns in words used. But luckily we have great apps like Biblehub where you can read the Greek next to the original, and go deeper looking at the meaning of the words and then their corresponding where used! It was very interesting to see that word was often used thought the gospels in Matt 11 & and mark 8 where he warned them in the same fashion when they were just complaining about bread. Just ponder on Jesus! There\\u2019s so much more to come! The rest is here, His Presence is coming and come to worship. Listening to here I am now. But think about that! He used that same warning to warn us on the bread as he warned of the signs to come. It\\u2019s time to center on him let your worship be a shield and warrior over your home and begin to love on Jesus and the Holy Spirit, it is time to invite Him into your homes and let him cure you from the inside out. There are seasons of pruning and gathering and we\\u2019re calling those in! Doesn\\u2019t matter who you are what you done! His gates are open and His Spirit has full power of you to change your entire life for His Good. Jew, American Christian, Mormon, catholic , non believer,  Islam, there is room the king of the universe. I pray I might visit some of my friends in Isreal! Stay safe!

But here's what nobody tells you: ISO standards are literally everywhere in your daily life, and you've probably never noticed.

**Your devices actually work together.**  
USB cables fit because ISO/IEC standardized them. Without that, every phone brand would have its own proprietary connector and you'd need a drawer full of different chargers. (Looking at you, pre-USB-C chaos.)

**Your credit card fits in every wallet and ATM worldwide.**  
ISO 7810 defines card dimensions. That's it. That's why your card from India works in a machine in Germany and fits perfectly in your wallet.

**Your food is (probably) safe.**  
Food safety standards like ISO 22000 create frameworks so your coffee shop, grocery store, and restaurant supply chains have traceability and hygiene controls. It's why foodborne illness outbreaks get caught and contained instead of going rogue.

**Medical devices don't randomly malfunction.**  
ISO 13485 ensures that thermometers, blood pressure monitors, hospital equipment, and even pacemakers meet strict quality and safety requirements. It's unglamorous until you need it to work.

**Your car parts actually fit together.**  
Automotive standards (IATF 16949) ensure components from different suppliers integrate safely. Airbags deploy. Brakes brake. Emissions are controlled. You know, the basics.

**The environment benefits too.**  
Standards like ISO 14001 (environment) and ISO 50001 (energy) push companies toward better waste management, lower emissions, and energy efficiency—which means cleaner air and water for everyone.

**The point?**  
Businesses chase ISO certifications because customers and regulators demand them, but the real winners are everyday people. We get products that fit, work safely, and don't randomly fail. ISO standards are the invisible scaffolding holding modern life together.

So next time someone dismisses ISO as ""just corporate bureaucracy,"" remind them: it's why their phone charges, their card swipes, and their lunch doesn't send them to the ER.

What's something you use daily that you had no idea was standardized? I'm genuinely curious what else we're all oblivious to.",1,1770716398.0,PacificCertifications,0,1.0,False

  Freelance dev + barista a real path?","Been at the same agency for 5 years (France, 42k€). First years were great but I just don't vibe with the environment anymore, and AI is making me question the whole career. I can't focus like I used to and the guilt is constant.

I've tried to leave but every time something falls through (budget cuts, notice period too long for them). The market is brutal right now.

The idea: I have \~3k€ in training budget. I'm thinking:

\- Freelance dev part-time. I have real skills (Python, FastAPI, React, GraphQL) but I'm terrible at selling myself

\- Barista part-time. I'm passionate about specialty coffee, know several baristas locally, could tap into that network. Gets me away from a screen

\- Use the 3k for barista training or a freelance/business course

What I'd really love is tech work applied to things I care about (BJJ, coffee, trail running) but I don't know how to get there.

Has anyone done the freelance + something physical on the side combo? Or found tech work in niche passion industries?

Clothing often carries stories, routines, and responsibilities, especially in homes, schools, and shared spaces. Clear identification helps reduce mix-ups and saves time during daily life. [**Woven Name Labels For Clothing** ](https://www.bcilabels.com/woven-clothing-labels/peel-stick-damask-1000pcs/)are valued because they blend durability with a neat, professional finish that lasts through repeated washing and regular wear. Unlike printed alternatives, woven options maintain their structure and legibility, even when exposed to heat, detergents, and friction. They are commonly used in uniforms, children’s apparel, and workwear where long-term use is expected. Beyond practicality, these labels add a subtle sense of order and personalization without altering the design of the garment itself. Parents appreciate them for school clothing, while organizations rely on them for easy sorting and management. Their soft texture also ensures comfort, preventing irritation against the skin. As sustainability and long-lasting products gain attention, well-made labels align with the idea of reducing waste by extending garment life. Small details like these quietly support everyday efficiency, making clothing easier to manage, organize, and reuse over time.",1,1770716047.0,u_bcilabels,0,1.0,False

1r0wbfe,https://i.redd.it/sjo98o3fzmig1.jpeg,Do you Hear or See?,"

Do you Blepete? I apologize I am barely learning Greek as a long 12 yr accountant! But do you see or hear spiritually? When I was doing some reading recently, I had what I believe a personal Revelation with the Lord. I have several of these over the past several years as I\\u2019ve worked to blot out the noise of life and seek the Lord. As an executive in the professional world, I\\u2019m often using leadership techniques in listening to people and seeing visual facts to ascertain with a high degree of confidence the skill to manage and manage well. I\\u2019ve seen myself somewhat as a visionary in this aspect as if often seek past the day to day issues, to plan and make sure we are on track from a strategy standpoint, which I really enjoy. I\\u2019m seasoned in the hard work thru businesses and am constantly using my listening skills. Do they know their task? Are they performing something and only doing a task cause they got trained? Or do they critically think thru the roll and have deep understanding on issues, or how their task are impacting others around them. So, it\\u2019s important to lead with care but also know who\\u2019s capable of what, and in today\\u2019s crazy HR environment it\\u2019s more important than ever to listen.

In the same way I think I\\u2019ve begun to learn to listen for the Lord. A few years back I began removing the \\u201cnoise\\u201d in my life how we constantly go from news cycle to news cycle, sports season to season, too trends, social media, and dooms scrolling, leading, personal work life and climbing the America corporate ladder, and asking myself how can I ever hear from the Lord if I never listen for him. I can barely process what the daily life is throwing at me 85-100 emails a day on work, waking daily to urgent international needs, and trying to lead a large young family, and trying to keep up with everything! It was too much! But I just kept asking the Lord, how can we even hear you w all this going on? Is this the cycle of meaning?  In late 2023 I was listening to Make Space by Bethel and began to ponder what does it mean to make space for the Lord? And began a journey of seeking after the Lord with pure joy to mentally remove the things that were distracting my hear from truly seeing His beauty and grace and Mercy and most of all Love. It was a deep period of living through my weaknesses of substance use, laziness at times, feeling overwhelmed, under satisfied not meeting goals, anxiousness, times of lust, anger. But it was a year in 2024 I set it as my goal to seek the Holy Spirit and learn to hear his voice.

I began the year with a month long fast from substance abuse (weed and alcohol), just to really understand my mental capacity, as I actually believe in moderation daily substance use can be beneficial in using all we have as lawful to us. I was meditating thru John 15 and what it truly means to be connected to the vine. I began to seek after some pastors preaching on the Holy Spirit, as while I love the church I currently serve for providing stability in our families faith while I live a bit of an adventurous life. But, it\\u2019s the same constant preaching and I ask questions important to me and since I\\u2019m open about my use, there is not respect.

However, truly began meditating and that month the Lord woke me up at 430am daily and took me back to a time in life where I had some of those daily habits and thought me enough grace and discipline in those periods to listen for him. During that time I wrestled about my idols of sports, work, substance use , and began to gain more confidence in seeking after Him and listening to what others who ste seeking the Spirit are honestly crying out with so much unity! There is a wave of refreshing spirit filled music that is truly focused on being in the presence of the Lord and as Stephen proclaims don\\u2019t you see him standing there in heaven! That year I wrestled with what does it mean to really step out on the water and radically seek after the Lord thru work trials, busyness, but hold constant to Jesus thru fears of losing my job, spouse, home, and more it brought beautiful moments of meditation in seeking after Jesus in the midst of the storm. if you watch the chosen at one point you see Peter get out of the boat and firmly walks towards Jesus. He begins to sink looking at the storms and waves ( anemon/ wind of the 4 corners \\u2026 maybe aware of some of the depths of the ancients of deep!!!) but it\\u2019s a beautiful image of him holding on to Jesus, our one and mighty-full savior!

\\u2026. This might be edited to allow more thought if discussion continues (as a Christian who uses substances as a tool, but open to periods of prolonged fasting for further personal and spiritual evaluation). Many more moments of personal reflection while using and while fasting.. I got a brief period in between jobs to fast again, and see if there would be any opportunities to go on my own, but I clearly still had learning to do!

But ended the year feeling a bit failed and off course when I started a new executive roll at a company that needed lots of mental attention. While  trying to coach people up to speed in modernize 20 yr old precedes. Back to long nights, emails at 2am, coffee, and staying alert on companies failing to notice industry trends. I felt I overcomes a lot of fear and became even more focused on seeking the Lord . And as further time came in 2025 I noticed 2024 for me was a year of learning to give up the personal things of my heart. I started the year very close to the Lord, and meditation on being connected to the vine and living water, while also going thru prolonged periods of frustration of not being around people who can see the filth we engage in on a daily basis. I went into 2025 and got rid of all social media as a personal offering to the Lord in recognition of so much time wasted and even further began meditating on passages. I\\u2019ll go into personal resections on this later. But really began to grow in trusting in the promises of the Lord  so much deeper and his Presence and some of the powers of the spirit revealed! It\\u2019s funny, we sing we want a fresh wind of the Holy Spirit, but so many forget how far they are for the fears and doubts every day life brings. The faith is hard, and the systems we live in seem endless. But the spirit is coming and is very powerful! And we/I have constantly hurt the Spirit, in our daily lives and the things we let in. But the goal is to get close to Jesus. If you want to follow Him and continue to learn we really need the basics do full surrender. There are so many songs out there preparing hearts even in the mainstream with the King of hearts tours and many song centered around our posture of everything at the feet of Jesus and laying our burdens on Him and recognizing his presence and peace throughout our daily lives. Across the nations are suffering but the wave of the Spirit is close and we need our hearts fully surrender to the King of Hearts our Lord and Savior, the great high Priest. Jesus Christ. Amen.

Learning to battle through prayer, meditations worshipping and teaching in the spirit, I have begun to properly view him in the room! Our great high priest has an offering of love, peace, wisdom, mercy, and the depths of knowledge. I do not fear where He is leading because the Spirit is leading and senses His closeness. But that means holding loosely the things I have. There\\u2019s another one on bringing your offerings before the Lord. Imagine at the day of repentance. Are you prepared to present your families as the tribes of Isreal did in the book of Joshua? I don\\u2019t believe I am. 3 of my 4 children are saved but one is still young and developing his pre-teen thoughts! But on a more sense of where our hearts are at, we will bring idols. His message is burning in my heart for our hearts to be fully is ever more as they face the impurities we faced as a generation. We have been a wicked generation, born from a corrupt generation, but there is still time for repentance. There is opportunity for all to open up to Jesus and seek His presence now! Listening to obsessions by Mercy culture right now. I don\\u2019t have full wisdom on everything and I am not perfect but I write w the integrity of a trusted finance executive w a heart for building up others and seeking the spirit. But there is significant evil amidst us and the Lord is near.

Listen to House of Prayer by Mitch Wong. But the goal was to write about Blepete. I was reading Matthew 24, and Matthew writes Take Heed. It is cool how in the Greek you can take notice of words and as new testament Christian\\u2019s we should be able to memorize patterns in words used. But luckily we have great apps like Biblehub where you can read the Greek next to the original, and go deeper looking at the meaning of the words and then their corresponding where used! It was very interesting to see that word was often used thought the gospels in Matt 11 & and mark 8 where he warned them in the same fashion when they were just complaining about bread. Just ponder on Jesus! There\\u2019s so much more to come! The rest is here, His Presence is coming and come to worship. Listening to here I am now. But think about that! He used that same warning to warn us on the bread as he warned of the signs to come. It\\u2019s time to center on him let your worship be a shield and warrior over your home and begin to love on Jesus and the Holy Spirit, it is time to invite Him into your homes and let him cure you from the inside out. There are seasons of pruning and gathering and we\\u2019re calling those in! Doesn\\u2019t matter who you are what you done! His gates are open and His Spirit has full power of you to change your entire life for His Good. Jew, American Christian, Mormon, catholic , non believer,  Islam, there is room the king of the universe. I pray I might visit some of my friends in Isreal! Stay safe!

1r0watj,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Electrical-Bar-5719/comments/1r0watj/the_trailer_creepypasta/,The Trailer Creepypasta,"Note: This is a transcribed version of a now-deleted horror story written by Mr. Nightmare. It is probably one of the best creepypastas ever written. Enjoy!

Ever since I was little, me and my family always took trips upstate New York to the Catskills. We had this old beat-up trailer up there, it was probably around 50 years old at the time. It had a kitchen, a living room, a bathroom and two bedrooms. Back when all six of us, me, my two brothers, my parents, and my dog Chester went up there, me and my little brother, Joey, would have to sleep in the living room on the couches, as there were only two beds, one queen-sized bed for my parents, and one single bed for my older brother Tom.

Sleeping in the living room was the one part me and Joe hated about going up there. In the middle of nowhere, with only an old wooden door protecting us from whatever psychopath wanted to break in and kill us. Well, I was only 10 and Joey was only 5, so we had active imaginations. And it's a little understandable for little kids to be scared in situations like these. But the worst part of this living room at night were the blinds.

You would think blinds would make you feel safer, blocking out the blackness from outside. But these blinds didn't even cover half of the window. We were exposed to the blackness of the outside. The thoughts of somebody or something standing out there, watching me sleep always haunted my mind. I always slept facing away from the window.

Chester always slept in the living room with me and Joey, which made us feel a little safer. Every night however, around the same time, we would wake up to the sound of Chester looking out the window, growling. I was always too afraid to go check outside, so I would call my dad and tell him to go look. He would always step outside and take a look to make us feel better, and then he would come back in and tell us it was probably just a deer. There came a time where my dad grew sick of this routine every night and told us to ignore it and go back to sleep.

As the years past, my mother grew tired of going up there, Chester passed away, and my older brother was always too busy with his new job. He never really enjoyed it as much as me, Joey, and my dad did anyway. This was the first year that it was just the three of us going up there. It kind of saddened me knowing that someday soon, my dad would have to sell this place. I knew he couldn't afford to keep paying the taxes for a place that we only visited once a year. For all I knew, this would be our last time going up there.

It was a long 4-hour drive from our Long Island house to the Catskill Mountains. I didn't sleep much during the ride this time. I just watched as the buildings surrounding the highways turned from houses to trees, and then eventually to hills and mountains. It was around 5 o'clock when we arrived to the old sign that advertised a horseback riding business. That's how we knew that we were there, just a few more turns.

We passed by just about the only neighboring house for about a mile. I don't even know if I would call this a house, it was more of a trailer-type home itself. It was relatively close to our trailer, just a few turns away. We never saw who lived there, we never saw any sign of life there. It was strange though, every time we drove by it, the grass seemed freshly cut.

We never really thought about it too much and usually just shrugged it off with some logical explanations. We arrived at the trailer, and stepping out of the car, I immediately picked up on that great country air smell. For the rest of the day, we just relaxed and watched some TV, with a very limited selection of channels.

Once it gets dark up there, there's nothing you can do outside. It gets creepy up there at night. Even my dad admitted that once, which kind of creeped me out because he was never one to admit fear to us. Once we got hungry, my dad decided to go get a pizza for dinner. My little brother always had a sweet tooth, and he knew that if he went with my dad, he would convince him to buy him candies and a soda.

I have been alone in the trailer many times, but that was during the day. I didn't mind that, but the sky was already getting dark, and I knew it was a fairly long drive to the pizza place. They wouldn't be back until there was full darkness. I didn't want to show my dad that I was afraid though, so I stayed, asking them to bring extra oregano. I heard the Honda start and move from the grass to the gravel road, before driving off.

I was watching TV in the living room; it was dark enough where I had to turn on the lights at this point. It was getting darker faster than I had hoped. I then realized that with the lights on and the curtains open, I was in full view for any psycho killer outside. I knew shutting those shitty blinds would be pointless, as they wouldn't even cover me. I was scared shitless, I don't know why. I tried to calm myself down, telling myself that there is no one out there, and that no one is sick enough to be watching me through the window. I started to calm down, as one of my favorite TV shows started on one of the TV channels. After a little while, I became completely relaxed until, KNOCK KNOCK.

I felt like my heart skipped three beats after hearing the sickening sound. My head immediately spun to the window, but I could see nothing but darkness. I was frozen in fear, my heart now racing, and I didn't know what to do. There was no way I would check who was out there. I then remembered my grandpa kept a gun in the closet. I shot up and ran to the closet where my grandpa kept all of his tools. I dug through a bunch of old boxes and tools, but found no gun. I did however find the next best thing, an ax.

I grabbed the ax and ran back to the couch. I thought about turning off the TV and light, but I quivered at the thought of being in total darkness in this situation. Whatever was out there knew I was in there, and turning out the lights would have done me no good. I sat back down on the couch with the ax in my hand, hoping whoever was out there would see that I was armed.

As I sat there waiting, a few minutes felt like hours. I waited for another knock on the glass, or for footsteps to come up to the wooden steps to the porch, or for the doorknob to turn, but there was nothing. Nothing but the sounds of the TV and crickets outside. I heard the sound of a car pulling up the gravel road and turning onto our property. They're finally back. I was so urgent to tell my dad about the knocking, but then I realized that he already thought I was, kind of paranoid.

I put the ax back in the closet and sat back down on the couch. I heard the sound of a car door shut, and then another, and then another. I guess they put the pizza in the backseat. The front door opened, and my dad and brother walked in with the pizza. I was instantly relieved, remembering how hungry I was. After eating, we watched TV for an hour before calling it a night.

Since it was just the three of us this time, my dad and brother shared the queen-sized bed, while I got the single bed in the other bedroom. This bedroom has a window as well, with no blinds at all. This window faced the woods behind the trailer. ""At least it's better than being in the living room"", I thought. Surprisingly, I fell asleep relatively quickly, only to wake up hours later to the sound of, KNOCK KNOCK.

I sprang up from my pillow, instantly reminded of the nightmarish situation. No, they knew I was in this room now. Who's out there? Are they watching me? Why? All of these thoughts filled my mind, almost causing me to forget the most natural and expected reaction from almost anyone. I screamed for my dad, and I immediately heard him run out of his bedroom and into mine. He turned the light on, asking me if I had gone completely insane.

I explained the thumping noise on the glass to my dad, and he reluctantly agreed to humor my story. He stepped outside with a flashlight and searched around the whole trailer. He returned inside about a minute later, assuring me that there was nobody out there. My dad already thought that I was paranoid, but after this, I was sure he thought I was just flat-out crazy.

I didn't even try to fall back asleep that night. The thought that somebody was just outside these thin, old trailer walls, and that they've been staring right at me freaked me out. All that was stopping them from entering the trailer was an old wooden door. The worst part, my dad didn't believe me. Without a dog around anymore to warn us, this creep could sneak in and slit our throats before a single one of us woke up. These thoughts polluted my mind, so I knew I would have to stay awake and listen for that front door to open. I probably wouldn't have even fallen asleep again that night if I tried.

A few slow hours passed before the first crack of sunlight filled the room. After hours of sitting still in fear, listening, the sunlight brought me instant relief. I heard my dad get out of bed, walk past my room, and step outside. We have a beautiful mountain view of the sunrise up there, so my dad would often get up early to watch the sunrise. Knowing that my dad was awake now, I felt safe, safe enough to fall asleep for an hour or two. And as quickly as that, I fell asleep.

It wasn't until a few hours later when I woke up to the sound of my little brother riding his dirtbike around the property. It must've been noon already. I was surprised my dad didn't wake me up. When I entered the kitchen, my dad greeted me with a good afternoon, emphasis on the ""afternoon"". I decided to eat breakfast outside on the deck because above the kitchen table was one of those sticky fly-catching roll-up tapes that you hang on the ceiling, and quite frankly, a bunch of dead flies and other flying bugs are not what I want to look at while eating.

It was a long boring day; I didn't do much besides watch TV, shoot cans with a BB gun, and think about the night before. Somebody knocked on the window. Somebody was outside, watching, listening. Maybe they still were. It was about 10 minutes after dinnertime. The sounds of the dirtbike still filled the property, even so shortly after dinner.

My dad couldn't take the racket anymore and told him to go ride somewhere else. It was a good thing my mom wasn't there, for my dad's sake, because she wouldn't approve of a boy of such a young age riding a dirtbike without supervision; especially so close to dark. My little brother told my dad that he was going to ride on the neighbor's property. After all, nobody ever seemed to be there, and it was a perfect property for the dirtbike. My dad said it was ok, and with that, my little brother stormed off the property, turning the corner up the hill, until the sound was completely gone.

It was quiet again, just what my dad wanted. I became bored quickly and decided to go see if Joey would let me ride around for a bit. I walked over to the neighboring lawn, but couldn't find my brother there. It was strange because he said he was going to ride around the property. I assumed that he was just riding around the dirt roads and decided to walk back to the trailer. Until I noticed the front door to the little house at the top of the lawn was open.

This made me really curious because there was no car in the lawn, and I had seen no one in that house. I then had the thought that my little brother went in there, snooping around. I was extremely curious at this point, so I walked up to the house. As I got closer, I noticed my little brother's dirtbike on the side of the house. Now I knew he was in there. This got me angry. I stormed up to the house and barged in through the front door.

I screamed Joey's name, but there was no response. The only thing that broke the silence was the creaking of the deteriorating floor when I walked. The living room was small, and it only had a few pieces of furniture, including a blue couch with some tears in the arms, a seemingly antique wooden coffee table that was covered in dust, and an old TV that looked like it was from the 60s. The room was dark, as all the curtains were closed. It just had an overall eerie feeling to it. I screamed Joey's name again; still silence.

I walked into the kitchen, which was in even worse shape. There were black marks on the floor in the corner, where there was probably at one point a fridge. There was an old microwave laying in another corner of the room. I wanted to take a few pictures inside this creepy house, so I took out my phone. It was off. I pressed the power button on, and the Apple logo popped up. While looking at the ground, I noticed something a bit unsettling.

There was a trail of blood drop stains, leading from the kitchen sink, to somewhere outside of the kitchen. I placed my phone on the counter and followed the trail out of the kitchen, through a small hallway, and to a door. It was a small door, it looked like a closet door. I was a little afraid to open it, but I did anyway. I made a shocking discovery. It was a stairway leading to a basement. It was odd for a small, trailer-like house to have a basement. I had the stupid thought that maybe Joe was down there, but I'm sure my curiosity only used that as an excuse to keep snooping around.

I searched the wall for a light switch, but there was none. I walked down a few steps to see if I could see anything, but it was too dark. It was too dark to go down there without a light source. I decided to go get my phone to use as a flashlight, so I walked back up the stairs, until something hit me in the face. I realized I walked into a hanging light switch.

""How could I have missed that?"", I thought. I pulled down the switch, turning on a very dimly lit lightbulb. Not only was it dim, but it gave off an eerie red light. I took a few steps down the stairs. The light barely provided enough light to reveal the basement, but as I peered down, I was able to see the shadows of a bunch of objects that seemed to be attached to something, hanging off the ceiling.

Before I could get a closer look, I heard footsteps coming from upstairs. It had to be Joey. I was so focused on snooping around myself that I had completely forgotten that the reason I entered in the first place was to find him. I walked up the stairs, yelling Joe's name again. ""Why aren't you answering?"", I said as I reached the top of the stairs. As I stepped back into the dark hall, I saw to the right of me, about 10 feet away, the silhouette of a large figure. That was not Joe.

I made a mad dash for the front door, noticing another blood trail leading to the front door. I ran outside. I was so horrified that I almost didn't even notice my dad's car speeding down the road at the bottom of the lawn.

Where the hell was he going? There was someone in the car with him. Was it Joey? It had to be. He was leaving. Where the hell was he going? I ran even faster to try and catch his attention, but I was too late. The car turned the next corner and drove down the hill past the trees. I slowed down and turned around to see that Joey's dirtbike was still at the side of the house. What the hell? I had no choice but to run back to the trailer.

As I ran, I constantly turned around to make sure whoever was in that house wasn't following me. It was getting pretty dark now and it was kind of hard to see from a distance. Running onto our property, though surrounded by woods, I became extremely paranoid that there were people hiding behind the trees, watching me. My dad left the front door wide open. He was obviously in a frantic rush, but for what?

I ran inside, shut the door, and locked it, still breathing frantically. My heart was pounding from fear, not because of the fact that I ran all the way to the trailer. I had to call my dad and ask him where the hell he was going. I reached into my pocket for my phone, only to give me the sickening reminder that I had left my phone in that house. Stupid! Why did I put it on the counter instead of in my pocket?

All I could do now was wait. It was getting really dark outside now, to the point where I would have to turn on the lights to see anything. I dreaded this because as soon as I would turn on the lights, I would be on display for anyone to see. But there was no way that I was able to fall asleep now. I was still in shock, that figure I saw, it had to be the owner of that house. I didn't know someone lived there. The condition of that house though, how could anybody live in there. And that figure, it towered over me, it had to be at least 7 feet tall.

Why the hell was Joe's dirtbike at that house? He had to have gone in there, but surely he came out. Who else could've been in that car with my dad? I knew I wasn't being a bad person, I knew I wasn't. My brother was safe and sound with my dad, and I knew that. I would have heard him if he were still in that house. I sat in the darkness for a while, just waiting to hear my dad's car pull off the gravel road and onto the grass. I didn't turn on the lights because I didn't want anyone to know that I was in there.

Before it got too dark to navigate the trailer at all, I managed to find a flashlight in the closet. I sat in the living room couch for about another 20 minutes, my eyes resting but my thoughts racing. However, a few moments later, my thoughts were interrupted by a sound, a sound that I had been anticipating. It was the sound of a car driving off the gravel road and onto the property.

I had instantly felt better; my dad was back. I reached over for the lamp and flipped on the switch. I heard the sound of a car door shut, and then another, and then, another. What the hell? Was someone else with them? No, maybe they just put some groceries in the back seat.

I relaxed until I heard two adult male voices talking outside. I turned off the light immediately and ducked under the window. The talking stopped. I waited for a few seconds before sneaking a peek at the car that was parked. I could just barely make out in the dark that it was a white van. I felt like my heart sink into my stomach. I ran to my dad's bedroom and closed the door. I had to find a place to hide. Under the bed would be too obvious, and the closet would also be too obvious.

But I remembered that inside the closet was another little door that opened up to a small compartment with a water pump inside. I didn't know if I could fit in there, but I had no other options, I had to try. I stepped in the closet and shut the door behind me. I turned on my flashlight and looked around for the small door. I couldn't find it. I could hear footsteps coming up the deck outside, approaching the front door to the trailer. After desperately rummaging the closet, I found the door to the compartment, but it was way too small for me to fit into. It was stupid of me to even consider that.

I heard somebody trying to turn the doorknob to the front door. Their failed attempts to open the door led to the sound of a loud bang on the door. They were trying to kick down the door now. It only took one more loud bang to the door, before I heard it break down. I had to get the hell out of there. Surely they saw the light that was on not too long ago, so I'm sure that they knew I was in here.

Suddenly, I had a nightmarish thought that the person I saw in that house, was one of the intruders. Everything was becoming seemingly clear to me now. The person I saw in the house must've been knocking on the windows at night, watching me. He must've gotten my little brother. ""Ugh, Joe, he's probably still in that house,"" I thought. God only knows what happened to him. And those things hanging in that basement, I don't even want to try to imagine what they are. How could I have left that house to save myself before even thinking about my little brother?

I heard two pairs of heavy footsteps pressing into the weak floors of the trailer. One pair of footsteps was coming down the hall toward the bedroom. I felt like my heart stopped beating at this point. I was sure that I was going to die. As the footsteps reached the bedroom door, I started to imagine the slowest, most painful deaths that I would endure. The door to the bedroom opened, and the footsteps entered the room.

I was prepared to launch out an attack as soon as the closet doors opened. I may have only been 17 at the time, but I was no scrawny thing. I could put up a decent fight. The footsteps circled the room; I could hear the sounds of the intruder pushing things around under the bed. If I had hidden under there, I would have been as good as dead. I heard the intruder get back on his feet and come towards the closet. The footsteps came to directly outside of the doors before stopping. I was as scared as anyone could be, but I was ready to attack.

The silence was broken by a man from outside, screaming for the two intruders to come outside. I heard footsteps walk out of the room, back down the hall, and out of the trailer. I opened the closet door quietly and tiptoed down the hall into the living room. I slipped on my shoes and looked out the window to make sure the coast was clear. Just barely, I could make out what looked like two bodies standing in front of the white van. Only two, where was the third one?

I turned to the door, but I could see something in the kitchen. It was the silhouette of a huge figure, the same figure I saw in that house. I don't know why or what possessed me, but instead of running out of that trailer instantly like anyone should have, I flipped on the light switch to the kitchen. What I saw will forever haunt my memories.

There, a deformed man, I don't even know if I would call this a man. It was a giant, 7 foot creature that was slightly slouched, with arms that almost reached down to its knees. Its hands were deformed, with the few fingers it had seeming to be facing the wrong way. One of its legs was noticeably bigger than the other. And its face, oh its face. It had the face of a human, but it seemed to have been sewn on to this thing. The stains of blood covered the facial features of the face that clearly used to belong to somebody else. I stood there, staring at that thing for probably a few seconds, before sprinting out of that trailer.

I ran past the treeline into the woods, barely able to navigate in the darkness. I remember hearing the two men shouting to me, but I didn't pay attention. After what I had just experienced and seen, my only focus was to get as far away from there as possible. I cut through the woods to make it back to the road. After running down the road for about a mile, I had to stop and catch my breath. I was sure I wasn't being followed.

The thought of my little brother came up again. I was convinced that he was dead, and I wanted to kill myself for being such a coward and not trying to find him when I could. Instead, I had been worried about myself and getting myself to safety and just shrugged it off with some stupid excuse. And whoever was in that car with my dad, I was sure they were planning on killing him, and my dad simply wanted to save me and Joe. I felt like crying but I was too scared to cry, I was too focused on being scared and checking my surroundings to make sure I wasn't being followed.

I stood in the middle of the road in the darkness of the night, surrounded by nothing but woods on both sides. The closest neighboring house had to be close. I could go there and ask for help; and call the police. Just before I could continue walking, a beam of light shone down the road. I looked up to see the headlights of a car speeding down the road. It couldn't be the white van, it was coming from the opposite direction. I waved my hand, signaling for the car to stop, but as it came closer, I realized it was my dad.

He slammed on the brakes and screamed at me to get in the car. There was someone in the passenger seat. It was my little brother Joey. I felt a brief moment of udder happiness and relief. But as I walked closer, I made a horrific discovery. His arm had several gashes in it, of which my dad tried to patch up with first-aid tape. The tape had soaked and turned completely red from blood. My little brother seemed to have been passed out. I almost let out a scream of shock, but I got in the backseat of the car, and we drove off, to never return to that trailer again.

My dad explained to me that my brother had returned to the trailer with his arm in a bloody mess, seemingly in shock. My dad immediately tried to patch him up the best he could, before speeding away to the nearest hospital, which was miles away. He didn't have time to find me and tell me where he was going. He figured Joey somehow injured himself on the dirtbike by falling off. Joey was in shock to the point where he wouldn't even speak. It wasn't until about 20 minutes into the drive that Joey finally started talking, and he explained what happened to him.

The door to the house was open, and Joe decided to go snooping around inside. After opening the basement door, a man ran up with a knife and started slicing at Joe's arm. Joe somehow escaped and ran back to the trailer. By the next day, Joe was safe and sound in the hospital, recovering.

My dad reported what happened to the police, and they sent a squad up to the house, which was reported completely empty. Those creeps packed up and left in a hurry. It's really sickening to know that they are still out there somewhere, continuing to do what they do, and that creature with them, that I'm probably the only one who will ever have seen that thing and lived to remember it, whatever it was.

Well, that was about 4 years ago. My dad sold the property, and we all tried to forget what happened. At the end of the day, Joey was in the car after all, just like I thought. So I didn't do anything wrong after all. I would have been dead if I hadn't trusted my gut. So I'm not a bad person, right?",1,1770715821.0,u_Electrical-Bar-5719,0,1.0,False

I'm looking to schedule a last minute trip with my dad for early March, driving down from the Netherlands. I'm unable to ski back to back days unfortunately, but for previous actual skiing 'holidays' we always used to do so. How small a town was didn't really matter then, but now that I won't be skiing for half of the week I'd like to have a little more options than the grocery store, souvenir shop and three restaurants / coffee spots! :) ​

We're both intermediate skiers, dad has a slight preference for more relaxed skiing with pretty surroundings, so tough reds/blacks are less of a necessity. We were aiming for a decent drive (about 10-11h) from the middle of the Netherlands.   


Mostly I'm looking for an area where I might not be bored out of my mind for half of the week when I won't be skiing. Any locations, or even accommodations that would have a swimming pool or spa facilities, (public transport) access to a city or just a bigger town with some more shopping or remote working spots, things like that.. 

  
Hope someone has some suggestions!

Perhaps Bostonians are correct, or maybe Londoners, maybe it's Floridians.

About that, is the correct pronunciation flarada or floorida? For me, I'd say neither is correct, but I pronounce it flarada. People with other accents might pronounce it a completely different way from the two ways I provided. 

I also say farest and aragon, instead of forest and Oregon. 

My point is, I think way too many people get caught up on ""proper pronunciation"" like when an English speaker says croissant, or pastelito. Doing so atrophies they're understanding of language. Languages are living, this includes pronunciation, grammar, and spelling. 

We don't hyphenate today and tomorrow anymore. We don't put an e at the end of old, and literally went from meaning what is actually written, to what actually happened, and is now used as an intensifier.

First morning I turned it on at full blast and immediately regretted it. It's like staring into the soul of the sun at 7am before coffee. Dialed it back to maybe 60% and worked my way up. You put it next to your monitor and just let it do its thing for 30 minutes while you drink coffee and pretend to read emails.

Within about a week my brain stopped trying to shut down at 2pm. By week two I was actually falling asleep before midnight without doomscrolling for an hour first. Not gonna say it cured everything but the difference between 8 hours under flickering basement lights vs having this thing on in the morning is night and day. Pun intended.

Since my whole circadian rhythm was already trashed I figured I'd go all in and grabbed a sunrise alarm clock too. Got the Philips SmartSleep.

Real talk setting this thing up is a nightmare. The buttons make zero sense and the manual reads like it was translated from Dutch by someone who hates you. I almost launched it across the room twice. BUT once you actually get it configured you never touch it again and waking up to a fake sunrise instead of your phone screaming at you in pitch black darkness is genuinely life changing.

Between the two of them my sleep is the most consistent it's been in over a year. The lamp does the heavy lifting during the day and the sunrise clock handles the mornings. If you work in a dungeon like me start with just the lamp and give it two weeks.

TL;DR: Basement office destroyed my sleep and energy. SAD lamp + sunrise alarm clock brought me back from the dead. The lamp is legit science not snake oil. The alarm clock setup will make you want to throw it but it's worth it.",2,1770715364.0,ProductProbe,0,1.0,False

I picked up a used Dual CV 5670 that was in real rough shape, it looked like someone had spilled a cup of coffee into it at one point 🫣

It was super crackly and only worked very inconsistently.

Anyway, after thoroughly cleaning everything and replacing some fuses it sounds great and mostly works but has a couple of quirks, most frustrating is that the right channel will start crackling and sometimes cut out at certain frequencies.

Sometimes to get the channel working again I have to turn the volume all the way up until I get a very loud BWA! and then it will be fine again.

A friend has suggested that it could be blown capacitors. None of them are obviously blown but they are all original and very old.

Should I pursue this rout and replace the caps or are there any other obvious culprits before I start desoldering?

• Chrome Hearts glasses — Transparent frames actually look clean IRL, not “costume jewelry.” The tiny floral etch on the lens? Still there after cleaning. Perfect for hiding tired eyes while pretending you’re into silverware.

• CRTZ hoodie — Script logo’s stitched tight, not peeling like last year’s batch. Wore it with black cargos and got side-eye from a hypebeast at the bodega. Mission accomplished.

• Maison Margiela — No link, one style, and yeah… skipped it after seeing the hem. Looks like it was sewn by someone who’d never seen Margiela before. Save your cash unless you’re buying irony.

• Nike socks — Basic Dri-FIT crew, 5-pack black. Honestly? Quality’s just okay—they thin out faster than expected and lose shape after a few washes. Fine if you need cheap backups, but don’t expect longevity.

• Adidas Adizero Pro — Lightweight as hell, great for actual runs (not just gym pics). Responsive underfoot, breathable upper—but heads up: the midsole’s already yellowing slightly on both sides after light use. Not a dealbreaker if you rotate shoes, but don’t expect them to stay crisp white.

• New Balance 9060 — Cream colorway’s versatile as hell. Pairs with grey sweats or tailored chinos. ABZORB heel still bouncy after two months. Quiet luxury adjacent.

• Nike Sherpa jacket — Black swoosh on cream fleece? Instant Y2K cosplay. Warm enough for fall nights, not sweaty indoors. Bonus: hides coffee stains like a pro.

• BAPE shark hoodie — Two-tone camo + shark face = maximum volume. Don’t wear this if you hate attention. Surprisingly soft inside, though—like a plush toy that fights back.

• Amiri hoodie — Minimalist flex. No chest logo spam, just small “AM” on the pocket. Looks expensive next to actual Amiri at a rooftop bar (don’t ask how I tested that).

• Carhartt cargos — Black workwear that doesn’t scream “I fix pipes.” Rivets hold up, pockets deep enough for phone + wallet + ego. Go-to for lazy days that need structure.

• Nike NOCTA pants — Light blue tech fabric feels like pajamas but looks intentional. Side zips are functional, not just for show. Ideal for airport runs or looking like you’ve got somewhere to be.

**BREAKING: Warsop vs. The Open Road – Vale Avenue Closed for 75 Days of Absolute Mayhem**

Warsop residents, cancel your plans and emotionally prepare yourselves. The traffic apocalypse is here, and it’s wearing hi-vis.

As of **February 9th, 2026** (yes, *yesterday* – no warning, no mercy, no respect for your morning coffee), **Vale Avenue is officially CLOSED** at the Vale Avenue / A60 Mansfield Road junction. Not for a week. Not for a “quick fix”.

We’re talking **75 straight days**.
**24/7.**
**Until Friday, April 24th.**

Vale Avenue is not “restricted”.
It is not “partially open”.
It is **dead**. ⚰️

### What’s Causing the Carnage?

Barratt Homes, busy conjuring up shiny new houses at **Stonebridge Fields**, have decided now is the *perfect* moment to:

* Rip up the junction like it owes them money
* Install brand new traffic lights
* Resurface the road
* Repaint lines
* Sprinkle anti-skid fairy dust everywhere

Because nothing says *“welcome to your new home”* quite like gridlocking an entire village for over two months.

### The Official Diversion (AKA The Scenic Punishment Route)

Trying to get between Vale Avenue and the A60? Enjoy this scenic misery loop:

**Vale Avenue → Stonebridge Road → Carr Lane → High Street**
(and reverse it if you’re feeling optimistic)

It’s the long way round. The *very* long way round. Expect to:

* Wave at the same neighbours repeatedly
* Revisit potholes you’d hoped to forget
* Question every decision that brought you to Warsop

**Cyclists:** congratulations, you now rule the roads.
**Drivers:** welcome to the slowest game of “who moved my commute”.

### Why Now? Why 75 Days? Why Always Us?

The whisper network says it’s simple maths:
More houses = more cars = someone finally realised the junction was an accident waiting to happen.

So Barratt Homes stepped in like reluctant superheroes:
“We’ll fix it… but we’re closing *everything* while we do.”

Oh, and just to keep things spicy, the **A60 itself** is also getting lane closures and temporary lights for resurfacing. Because fixing one road at a time would be far too reasonable.

### Warsop Survival Guide (February–April Edition)

* Pack snacks for longer journeys (hanger is real)
* Expand your swear vocabulary by week three
* Consider moving (joking… mostly)
* Post your best traffic rage photos with **#WarsopGridlock2026**
  Go viral. Become folklore.

Warsop, we salute your patience. When those shiny new traffic lights finally flicker to life in late April, we’ll all pretend the last 75 days never happened.

Until then:
Honk if you’re angry.
Wave if you’ve accepted your fate.
And maybe invest in the company that makes diversion signs.

Safe(ish) travels, you absolute legends.
May your detours be short and your coffee brutally strong ☕🚧

Do you Blepete? I apologize I am barely learning Greek as a long 12 yr accountant! But do you see or hear spiritually? When I was doing some reading recently, I had what I believe a personal Revelation with the Lord. I have several of these over the past several years as I\\u2019ve worked to blot out the noise of life and seek the Lord. As an executive in the professional world, I\\u2019m often using leadership techniques in listening to people and seeing visual facts to ascertain with a high degree of confidence the skill to manage and manage well. I\\u2019ve seen myself somewhat as a visionary in this aspect as if often seek past the day to day issues, to plan and make sure we are on track from a strategy standpoint, which I really enjoy. I\\u2019m seasoned in the hard work thru businesses and am constantly using my listening skills. Do they know their task? Are they performing something and only doing a task cause they got trained? Or do they critically think thru the roll and have deep understanding on issues, or how their task are impacting others around them. So, it\\u2019s important to lead with care but also know who\\u2019s capable of what, and in today\\u2019s crazy HR environment it\\u2019s more important than ever to listen.

In the same way I think I\\u2019ve begun to learn to listen for the Lord. A few years back I began removing the \\u201cnoise\\u201d in my life how we constantly go from news cycle to news cycle, sports season to season, too trends, social media, and dooms scrolling, leading, personal work life and climbing the America corporate ladder, and asking myself how can I ever hear from the Lord if I never listen for him. I can barely process what the daily life is throwing at me 85-100 emails a day on work, waking daily to urgent international needs, and trying to lead a large young family, and trying to keep up with everything! It was too much! But I just kept asking the Lord, how can we even hear you w all this going on? Is this the cycle of meaning?  In late 2023 I was listening to Make Space by Bethel and began to ponder what does it mean to make space for the Lord? And began a journey of seeking after the Lord with pure joy to mentally remove the things that were distracting my hear from truly seeing His beauty and grace and Mercy and most of all Love. It was a deep period of living through my weaknesses of substance use, laziness at times, feeling overwhelmed, under satisfied not meeting goals, anxiousness, times of lust, anger. But it was a year in 2024 I set it as my goal to seek the Holy Spirit and learn to hear his voice.

I began the year with a month long fast from substance abuse (weed and alcohol), just to really understand my mental capacity, as I actually believe in moderation daily substance use can be beneficial in using all we have as lawful to us. I was meditating thru John 15 and what it truly means to be connected to the vine. I began to seek after some pastors preaching on the Holy Spirit, as while I love the church I currently serve for providing stability in our families faith while I live a bit of an adventurous life. But, it\\u2019s the same constant preaching and I ask questions important to me and since I\\u2019m open about my use, there is not respect.

However, truly began meditating and that month the Lord woke me up at 430am daily and took me back to a time in life where I had some of those daily habits and thought me enough grace and discipline in those periods to listen for him. During that time I wrestled about my idols of sports, work, substance use , and began to gain more confidence in seeking after Him and listening to what others who ste seeking the Spirit are honestly crying out with so much unity! There is a wave of refreshing spirit filled music that is truly focused on being in the presence of the Lord and as Stephen proclaims don\\u2019t you see him standing there in heaven! That year I wrestled with what does it mean to really step out on the water and radically seek after the Lord thru work trials, busyness, but hold constant to Jesus thru fears of losing my job, spouse, home, and more it brought beautiful moments of meditation in seeking after Jesus in the midst of the storm. if you watch the chosen at one point you see Peter get out of the boat and firmly walks towards Jesus. He begins to sink looking at the storms and waves ( anemon/ wind of the 4 corners \\u2026 maybe aware of some of the depths of the ancients of deep!!!) but it\\u2019s a beautiful image of him holding on to Jesus, our one and mighty-full savior!

\\u2026. This might be edited to allow more thought if discussion continues (as a Christian who uses substances as a tool, but open to periods of prolonged fasting for further personal and spiritual evaluation). Many more moments of personal reflection while using and while fasting.. I got a brief period in between jobs to fast again, and see if there would be any opportunities to go on my own, but I clearly still had learning to do!

But ended the year feeling a bit failed and off course when I started a new executive roll at a company that needed lots of mental attention. While  trying to coach people up to speed in modernize 20 yr old precedes. Back to long nights, emails at 2am, coffee, and staying alert on companies failing to notice industry trends. I felt I overcomes a lot of fear and became even more focused on seeking the Lord . And as further time came in 2025 I noticed 2024 for me was a year of learning to give up the personal things of my heart. I started the year very close to the Lord, and meditation on being connected to the vine and living water, while also going thru prolonged periods of frustration of not being around people who can see the filth we engage in on a daily basis. I went into 2025 and got rid of all social media as a personal offering to the Lord in recognition of so much time wasted and even further began meditating on passages. I\\u2019ll go into personal resections on this later. But really began to grow in trusting in the promises of the Lord  so much deeper and his Presence and some of the powers of the spirit revealed! It\\u2019s funny, we sing we want a fresh wind of the Holy Spirit, but so many forget how far they are for the fears and doubts every day life brings. The faith is hard, and the systems we live in seem endless. But the spirit is coming and is very powerful! And we/I have constantly hurt the Spirit, in our daily lives and the things we let in. But the goal is to get close to Jesus. If you want to follow Him and continue to learn we really need the basics do full surrender. There are so many songs out there preparing hearts even in the mainstream with the King of hearts tours and many song centered around our posture of everything at the feet of Jesus and laying our burdens on Him and recognizing his presence and peace throughout our daily lives. Across the nations are suffering but the wave of the Spirit is close and we need our hearts fully surrender to the King of Hearts our Lord and Savior, the great high Priest. Jesus Christ. Amen.

Learning to battle through prayer, meditations worshipping and teaching in the spirit, I have begun to properly view him in the room! Our great high priest has an offering of love, peace, wisdom, mercy, and the depths of knowledge. I do not fear where He is leading because the Spirit is leading and senses His closeness. But that means holding loosely the things I have. There\\u2019s another one on bringing your offerings before the Lord. Imagine at the day of repentance. Are you prepared to present your families as the tribes of Isreal did in the book of Joshua? I don\\u2019t believe I am. 3 of my 4 children are saved but one is still young and developing his pre-teen thoughts! But on a more sense of where our hearts are at, we will bring idols. His message is burning in my heart for our hearts to be fully is ever more as they face the impurities we faced as a generation. We have been a wicked generation, born from a corrupt generation, but there is still time for repentance. There is opportunity for all to open up to Jesus and seek His presence now! Listening to obsessions by Mercy culture right now. I don\\u2019t have full wisdom on everything and I am not perfect but I write w the integrity of a trusted finance executive w a heart for building up others and seeking the spirit. But there is significant evil amidst us and the Lord is near.

Listen to House of Prayer by Mitch Wong. But the goal was to write about Blepete. I was reading Matthew 24, and Matthew writes Take Heed. It is cool how in the Greek you can take notice of words and as new testament Christian\\u2019s we should be able to memorize patterns in words used. But luckily we have great apps like Biblehub where you can read the Greek next to the original, and go deeper looking at the meaning of the words and then their corresponding where used! It was very interesting to see that word was often used thought the gospels in Matt 11 & and mark 8 where he warned them in the same fashion when they were just complaining about bread. Just ponder on Jesus! There\\u2019s so much more to come! The rest is here, His Presence is coming and come to worship. Listening to here I am now. But think about that! He used that same warning to warn us on the bread as he warned of the signs to come. It\\u2019s time to center on him let your worship be a shield and warrior over your home and begin to love on Jesus and the Holy Spirit, it is time to invite Him into your homes and let him cure you from the inside out. There are seasons of pruning and gathering and we\\u2019re calling those in! Doesn\\u2019t matter who you are what you done! His gates are open and His Spirit has full power of you to change your entire life for His Good. Jew, American Christian, Mormon, catholic , non believer,  Islam, there is room the king of the universe. I pray I might visit some of my friends in Isreal! Stay safe!

1r0vwdd,https://i.redd.it/vg8jpjooumig1.jpeg,Why Al Influencers Have It Wrong From the Beginning,"Hey there, I've been diving deep into the world of AI-generated influencers, and I think most creators are shooting themselves in the foot right from the start. Let me break it down: they're getting trapped in this cycle of producing only SFW (Safe For Work) or mildly sexy content, but when they try to pivot to NSFW (Not Safe For Work) stuff for platforms like Fanvue or OnlyFans, it all falls apart. The big culprit? Face consistency, or rather, the total lack of it—not only inconsistent but also with no private exclusive +18 content, because a lot cannot create this kind of content (because of the restrictions, censored AI tools, and because they don't know about more advanced options or think they're too difficult).

The Common Mistake: Starting with SFW Models

Most AI influencers begin by generating characters using general-purpose or SFW-tuned models like Midjourney, Nano Banana, Seedance's base versions or something fine-tuned for ""realistic portraits"" and ""lifestyle shots."" These models are great for creating Instagram-ready pics—think beach selfies, gym poses, or casual outfits that are sexy but not explicit. You can get a consistent face across a bunch of these images by using simple prompting with seeds and references.

But here's where it goes wrong: when they want to monetize with NSFW content, they switch to explicit models or try to ""uncensor"" their generations. NSFW-specific models (like those fine-tuned on adult datasets) aren't built with the same emphasis on facial detail or consistency as SFW ones. This leads to half-baked galleries on Fanvue: a few decent SFW teasers, then a bunch of inconsistent NSFW shots or non at all! No wonder engagement tanks and subscribers bail—people want a consistent character they can connect with, and they want exclusive hot content.

The Right Way: Build from NSFW Foundations First

Flip the script. Start with an NSFW-capable model as your base for character creation. Models like those trained on a mix of explicit and non-explicit data allow you to generate a core character with rock-solid consistency across all types of content. Here's why this works:

\- Face Consistency Baked In: NSFW models often handle anatomy and poses better out of the gate. Generate your character's ""nude base"" first—focus on poses, lighting, and expressions without clothes. This ensures the face, body proportions, and even skin textures stay identical no matter what you add later. And you have already your exclusive spicy content that makes real money!

\- Branch Out to SFW Seamlessly: Once you have that consistent NSFW core, layering on clothes, backgrounds, and lifestyles is easy. Your influencer can go from bedroom scenes to coffee shop vibes without looking like a different person.

\- Efficiency and Quality Boost: This approach saves time because you're not fighting model biases. SFW models often have built-in censors that make NSFW generations wonky, but starting NSFW lets you dial back explicitness as needed. Plus, you end up with higher-quality content overall—better anatomy means more realistic SFW pics too.

I've experimented with this myself, and the difference is night and day. My test characters maintain high face similarity across hundreds of gens, versus the mess from SFW-first attempts.

Why This Matters for Fanvue and Beyond

Platforms like Fanvue thrive on personalized, immersive content. If your AI influencer looks inconsistent, it breaks the fantasy—fans feel like they're following a glitchy bot, not a ""real"" persona. Starting NSFW-first gives you versatility: killer NSFW for paid subs, engaging SFW for social media growth. It's not just about ethics or tech limits; it's smart business.

The cold, white light settled into my field of vision as I felt a single bead of sweat roll down the side of my head. There had been hundreds of deep dives over the years, but still the electrodes attached to my head felt as sterile as ever. The same, routine voice sounded over the garbled loudspeaker.

*“Commencing mental imaging test two-hundred and fourteen. Dr. Hakeem, do you consent to the test?”*

I rolled my eyes, remembering the stack of papers the bureaucrats stuck in front of me to sign before we could even get here. *“Yes. I consent to the test.”*

*“Noted. As we proceed, please try to clear your mind of stray thoughts; we need a clear mind-space for the imaging to properly manifest.”*

*“I built this tech, Pete. I remember the steps I wrote in the paper you’re reading off.”*

The intercom went quiet for a few seconds, but when it came back to life, another voice came through: Betty, ever the mediator. *“Doctor, please. You know we need to get through these guidelines. It’s not Peter's fault you choose to perform these tests yourself every time.”*

*“Can we just get on with it? I have a date tonight.”*

Peter's voice, now clearly annoyed, chimed in once more. *“Clear your mind, Doctor. Imagine you’re standing on a small, yellow raft floating in the ocean. Around you is nothing but open ocean.”*

Just as it had every time, the bed I was laying on began to slide into position under my life's work. To any blind eye, it’d look just like your typical MRI machine; until, of course, the lights begin.

*“Slowly, you feel the waves rock your boat back and forth on the water.”*

As the machine stopped moving and my eyes settled onto the archway above me, I could've sworn I felt one of the silicone cups begin to loosen.

*“Commencing mental image transfer.”*

My eyes opened with a strain I could never shake. The bright blue and white sky blanketed the dreamscape just like usual; the swirling wind ebbed and flowed, pushing the little raft forward. As per usual whenever we make a successful transfer, I looked north into the sky and raised my right hand in a ""thumbs-up"" motion.

In response, the water covering the space below me began to sink and part, landing my raft and me on what I call the testing grounds: a vast expanse of the most boring grays and whites that modern science can produce. The perfect testing grounds. But today, today was anything but boring. Today was a benchmark of my research, something to finally put me in the history books. I called out into the blandness.

*“Ready whenever you are, Pete.”*

I waited for the ground below me to shift, for walls to inexplicably form around me, for a sky to settle in the space above. Hell, anything. But Pete must've missed my signal.

*“Peter, I’m ready to start. Let’s get on with it.”*

The jitters I'd felt all morning settled into a light confusion as I stood there waiting for some type of response. *“Jesus, Pete, come on, man. This isn’t exactly frightening.”*

Absolute silence. Not even my voice held an echo here; we figured it would expend too much computing power during production to simulate something so trivial. For about another minute I stood bewildered, wondering what the hell Peter was cooking up that took so much time to generate. My annoyance began to shift slowly back into excitement; I knew whatever was coming had to be insanely in-depth. But still, I waited.

My patience eventually ran thin at what was the ten-minute mark by my count. I decided to lay down for now while I waited for startup. *“This’d better scare the shit out of me,”* I jokingly called out into the flat gray sky.

As was procedure during moments like this, I checked my wrist to make sure the stability markings were still there. Sure as I expected: three perfectly symmetrical parallel lines temporarily tattooed onto the front of my wrist. The experiment was still stable. The confirmation eased my worries as I tried to relax, laying on the hard ground below.

*Should’ve brought a damn pillow in with me,* I thought.

I consider myself a patient man, but the ability to recede into one's own mind in response to boredom is greatly stunted by literally standing inside a mental image. I’d neglected to keep counting after what felt like the first thirty minutes.

*“Alright, Pete, Betty, this is a bit ridiculous. Do we need to reinitialize? If so, just pull me out now and let's retry after.”*

Nothing. Still, those two were always sticklers for procedure, so if something had gone wrong, I knew they’d tell me. It wasn’t even a question in my mind until now. I remembered the tinge of worry that I felt when we first initialized. That electrode on the left side of my head: was it really loose? Was it causing a break in communication services? That’s not how the DIM works, but nonetheless, I raised my hand again and decided to just let this first test go unrecorded. My hand flipped downward into a ""thumbs down"" gesture to signal a restart.

Then, my senses were overloaded. Blinding lights flooded my vision, the mechanical whirring of the DIM startled me, and the feeling of the cold, hard plastic platform below me emerged once again.

*“Jesus, Peter, just what the hell was that?”* I called, scooting out from the locked platform that was supposed to slide out whenever we ended a test. Sitting up and looking towards the observation platform, I could see Peter and Betty's silhouettes clearly staring at me. I decided something must have gone wrong on their end and began preparations for another trial.

I pulled off each electrode one-by-one, confirming that, yes, one of them had broken loose in the testing phase. Getting up, I threw my coat back on and began back up the stairs to the control panel. *“Look, guys, if something goes wrong in the prep, you need to tell me, who knows wh—”*

I grabbed the doorknob, but it stuck closed. I jiggled it once more before knocking. *“What the hell is going on with you guys? Let me back in!”* I called from the other side of the door.

In an act of defiance, I pushed the door harder, but to my surprise, it actually flung open. All my weight was transferred to the now-open space, and I stumbled forward through it. Looking up, instead of seeing my colleagues, an overwhelming bewilderment washed over me as I saw naught but an infinite black expanse ahead of me.

*“Oh, you assholes,”* I called into the void. *“You know, that's considered a failsafe violation! I could write you both up for that!”*

I raised my hand again to signal an exit. A tinge of fear settled in my chest with every second that passed. By my count, I had my hand up for thirty-three seconds before letting it down. Under every failsafe condition we have, a simulation is supposed to end in case of emergency, but there was nothing I could do from in here. I’d already been here for longer than most runs, but panicking would just make everything worse. As much as I’d try, I couldn’t shed the thought of my lab in flames around me while I sat hooked up to electrodes, waiting to suffocate.

I stopped trying to communicate with Pete and Betty about an hour in. My voice was getting hoarse, and it wasn’t my responsibility to engage emergency comms either way; that fell to the observers. The total silence of the void settled in my ears, punctuated by a previously inaudible high-pitched hum. I sat once more, this time for longer. By my count, it’d been about four or five hours since I first engaged the DIM.

Trying to keep myself occupied, I played games with myself. I sang *A Hundred Bottles of Beer on the Wall*, then two hundred, then three, eventually getting all the way up to a thousand before my patience ran out. I tried to make up riddles, jokes, proverbs. I sat and meditated for what felt like forever, then made up fake business ideas: a self-contained airbag for motorcycles, dimmable contact lenses, home insulation made from recycled plastics. I went over every one of my life's decisions in my head that felt worthwhile enough to regret.

Time went on like stone dragging through sand, and eventually, I ran fresh out of things to think about. Between every activity, I took less and less confident guesses at how long it’d been. Another two hours passed. It’d been seven now and the tile-hard floor of the dreamscape was making my spine ache. Typically, pain receptors during dreams were muddled, but the vividness of the experience required a level of immersion that was usually a non-issue past a biting cold wind. Now, though, suffocating darkness, cold hard floors, and a near-deafening hum coming from my own ears became the paramount sensations.

It was at this point I thought of what'd happen when I got out. First, I’d tackle Pete and fire Betty. Then, I would relish in the fact that I’d never be the one doing these dives again. I’d watch the monitors from a comfy office chair with a coffee in hand.

*“Yeah, that's gonna be nice,”* I caught myself saying aloud.

But recovering from my comfortable daydream, the annoyingly uncomfortable ground and infinite mass ahead brought my mood back down to a solid, hopeless boredom. It was at this point I stood up to stretch my legs and jumped slightly as I could’ve sworn something moved in my peripherals. I spun around to check, but of course, there was nothing. Over six hours blanketed in near-total darkness would be a breeding ground for low-light hallucinatory experiences, so I was able to shrug it off pretty easily.

I finished my stretching and began walking forward in an attempt to curb the muscle pains. Walking for another ten minutes, the echo of my footsteps became painfully monotonous. So, every once in a while, I'd change up my rhythm: skipping, hopping, walking faster or slower. Hell, I even started jogging until my six years of sedentary research caught up to me and I stopped, bending down and placing my hands upon my knees in a pant.

Right before I came up, however, I saw the same shape from before speed through the space directly ahead of me. This time, I was able to catch more of its shape: large and oblong. It strode in and out of my vision in a single bound. I still couldn’t be sure I even saw anything, but if nothing else, my hallucinations were becoming more and more vivid. A creeping sense of dread coated the silent space around me. Trying to shake it off, I began to walk back to where I’d been resting before. Something about what I'd been seeing made me welcome a break in the silence.

I eventually made it back to the space from before. However, I felt the urge to call into the air once more. *“Hey Pete… this… this isn’t a joke, right?”* But when my words cut through the air, they felt louder than ever. Truthfully, I wished it was. I said a silent prayer that Peter was on the other side laughing with Betty at my apparent superstition.

I began to think back at my behavior the past few years and remembered all the sneering remarks I’d served them, all the late nights they stayed in the lab with me. Hell, Betty (no, Dr. Nimmick) missed her anniversary on the first test because I couldn’t wait another day. I’d been staring into the distance as the thoughts began to take hold, but they were punctuated by something peculiar. I saw on the upper edge of what was before a nearly infinite space; the “ceiling” almost seemed lower from certain angles. Just barely, but noticeable. It wasn’t moving, that was for sure, but perhaps more hallucinations were beginning to manifest.

I understood the nature of my situation. Hell, I created my situation. But still, I was reminded of my ever-malleable human brain and its limitations. It felt like I’d been in the DIM for nearly a day now. My surroundings were shrouded in near-complete darkness. My own creation was starting to take hold of me, and my brain was fighting back. To be honest, the sensory effects of isolation within the DIM was something we’d yet to study in-depth. We’d been too focused on sensation testing and dream recollection.

Wait... amygdalic responses. That's right. That's what we were testing when I came in here. Fear responses. How could I have forgotten that so soon?

These weren’t illusions; they were creations. Subtle and effective. The only way this made sense was if those two were behind everything. The realization hit me like a car crash. I let out a small chuckle and began to recognize the cleverness of my colleagues, but the issue still remained that they’re actively ignoring my wishes to leave. Maybe I deserved it just this once for the sake of the experiment, but I’d have to talk to them when I get out.

The frustration built steadily as I circled my own initial area like a shark. Except I was more of a fish looking for the shark. After what felt like hours, my motivation had all but wilted and I fell back to the ground in exasperation. I laid there on my back, limbs sprawled out. I felt a yawn surface in my throat. My muscles were unexpectedly very tired.

*Perhaps some rest would do me some good,* I thought, turning over to my stomach. I found it the more comfortable sleeping position by far. I began to drift off, my thoughts from the day crowding my mind, but one in particular stood out from the rest.

*How the hell am I tired right now?* By every stretch of the imagination, there should be no way my brain is expending enough energy in the simulator to become tired. I was essentially sleeping in a biological sense. Maybe there really was a malfunction in the machine, or maybe my brain was becoming symbiotic with the effects of the DIM.

*“For his contributions to the scientific community, I’d like to welcome Dr. Richard Hakeem to the stage.”* The lights were blinding as my feet clicked over the linoleum floor. I made sure to lock eyes with Dr. Pastrick as I shook his hand. Just then, his grip left mine, and he walked off stage to give me podium space. I stared out into the crowd of my friends, family, coworkers. All of those who didn’t want me up here. I pushed my bitterness to the side and began.

*“Hello, everybody. I’d like to thank every one among you who believed in me and my vision. The road was rocky, at times… but nevertheless…”*

Nevertheless… what came after that? The silence filled the room with an encumbrance that my words never had. I searched my memories for the next bit, but the memory wouldn’t come. A small bead of sweat formed on my forehead as I watched the crowd's faces grow confused. I looked to Pete and Betty for help, but their faces were stifling laughter. My stomach twisted at the embarrassment.

*“Sorry everybody, I… I—uh.”*

It was pathetic. I’d finally done it, my chance to be respected, and here I am stumbling over my words. I was frozen in fear, my hands gripping the sides of the podium so hard I felt them bruise. I stood behind that podium, my voice arrested. As time moved on, the crowd grew bored and eventually filed out of the room. My colleagues let out painfully audible laughter as they crossed the doorway out of the hall. And still I stood there, trying to find my words.

But as I felt them cross the tip of my tongue, the podium fell away. And so did the stage, the windows, the metal fold-up chairs that once held my dream.

And there I stood, hands lifted to rest on nothing, my body still drenched in sweat, but this time I was truly alone again in that pitch blackness I’d grown to resent. I fell on my ass in flabbergast. How the hell did I manage that vivid hallucination? Was it even a hallucination? The change of environment didn’t follow the typical pattern of a DIM system shift. Was it a dream? Did I fall asleep while asleep? My head spun with possibility, but the confusion was no longer hopeful; it was punctuated by a suffix of nausea.

My head fell in my hands. Were these even my hands? Was this my head? Hell, are these even my thoughts anymore? How many layers of facsimile did this version of my consciousness exist within? Perhaps the memories of normal life I’d clung onto so hard weren’t even mine anymore.

*“God, no, no, no, no, no, NO!”*

I couldn’t fall into disillusion. I felt my mental state slipping from me. I repeated what I knew to be true. *“My name is Richard Hakeem. I’m a scientist experiencing a mechanical malfunction. My surroundings are mental images. I am not in danger.”*

The thoughts worked incrementally to ground me in reality, but the same voice nagged at the back of my mind *au contraire*. I shook it off, but it clung like a fungus.

I ran once again, paying close mind to my peripherals. Scanning the darkness led me to almost nothing for another hour or so. As the swirl of my doubts came to a crescendo, I finally saw another of those things: that same dark shape outlined in the black. It had to be what I was meant to see. I whipped my head to find it, but I could not; it seemed to only exist in the recesses of my vision.

But I had to find it again. I had to see it in full. My head craned back and forth in wild motion. Trying once more to conjure the thing, I formed a plan. I spent so long switching visual direction I made myself dizzy. Then, in one more attempt, I spun in a single circle, trying to make the visual glitching as bad as possible.

Eventually, as the shape settled in my peripheral vision once more, my surroundings spun. With my vision moving outside of my command, I stopped, letting the shapes that once existed in the corner of my vision backspin into my direct line of sight. I met its pinpoint white eyes, and...

*“HURK!”*

I shot up like a sling, the cold plastic below me now drenched in hot sweat. The nodes on my forehead were nearly all peeled away as my body flung upwards. I could see naught but the blinding mechanical red and white flashing through the room. But on my shoulders, I felt a pair of strong hands shaking me wildly.

*“OH THANK GOD, FINALLY!”*

*“PETE? IS HE ALRIGHT?”*

*“I THINK SO. GRAB THE VITALS KIT. HE’S CONSCIOUS!”*

Another set of footsteps descended, and slowly my vision went from a white and red blur to a set of discernable shapes. My voice tried to escape, but what came out was hoarse and painful. *“P… Pete? Is that..?”*

*“Yes, it's me, Doctor. The DIM malfunctioned and we lost all comms. Then you began to seize and the alarms went off. We lost you for about an hour but...”* He’d stopped talking, like he said too much in his panic.

*“You… lost me?”*

*“Y-yes… According to the vitals scanners, you were brain-dead for about an hour. Then, out of nowhere, you started seizing again and Betty and I ran in here to help. You had us worried sick. What happened in there?”*

*“It… it wasn’t you guys?”*

*“What do you mean, what wasn’t us?”*

The following hours happened in a blur. I recounted my story to the befuddlement of Dr. Nimmick and Dr. Chambers. They listened, glued to their pads of paper. I recounted the hallucinations, the phantom sleep, the loss of environments, even those creatures in my peripherals. My story was met with a litany of mental testing, emotional support, and reassurance.

*“Safe to say we wait for another test?”* Dr. Nimmick chimed in.

*“God, yes. And it isn't me going down there anymore.”*

The room's silence was broken by lighthearted chuckles. After my grilling, and after I called my date to let her know I wouldn’t be making it due to a “work emergency,” I finally pulled into my driveway. I’d appreciated my drive home more then than I ever had before. The wind, the trees, the annoying radio ads; it all seemed to delight me.

The heavy *thwack* of my truck door closing sounded as I walked up my driveway. I knew there was nobody waiting for me anymore, but nonetheless, the stagnant air of my living room felt like rays of gold compared to what I'd been through. I plopped down on my couch and, after some searching, found my TV remote to lull me to sleep. I pointed the remote to the TV and clicked *ON*.

Nothing, I clicked again, nothing, again at a different angle, nothing. An exasperated sigh left my lungs as I hoisted myself off the couch and tried turning my tv on manually, again nothing. I checked the cables and connections, everything was where it was supposed to be. The power hadn’t gone out because my lights were on. But now that I mentioned it, the bulbs may have needed a change soon, they looked strange, like there was light emitting from them but it didn’t leak anywhere, it didn’t bathe the furniture, looking around I was puzzled, something was wrong but I couldn’t place it, suddenly my ears were filled with the heavy silence in the room I hadn’t noticed before, I could only hear my heart beating in my own head, slowly, I looked back at to where my tv was, the black screen that had previously annoyed me now stoked a fire within me I thought had been extinguished, my eyes stared into it, it wasn’t the black of deactivated OLED pixels, it was darker, more encompassing. It was blacker than black, it was a void, and in the void, were two small, white pinpricks.",1,1770714130.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

Having been quite interested in the discussesioms here and on health podcasts  related to lipids and ASCVD, I took the opportunity while in Thailand recently to avail of two tests at a low cost that are almost impossible to convince doctors in my country to perform: lipoprotein (a) and apoB.

I was quite stunned that lipoprotein (a) came back at a ridiculous score of 216 nmol/L. My ApoB was 119 which is also way too high.

Presenting the results to a doctor in my country could go one of two ways. They'll either take it seriously or they'll disregard them because they don't know about lipoprotein a or apob or they'll say blood work in a country like Thailand might be unreliable.

Most keyboards and dictation tools don’t help much. They transcribe words literally, miss context, butcher names, and leave me fixing formatting by hand. Writing an email, a chat reply, or a document all need very different handling.



What makes Tapfree different is how it understands context. Tapfree uses on-screen context (the text field and surrounding UI), not just the app you’re in, to produce cleaner, more relevant dictation.



It also handles the way people actually talk. You say *""Could you get some coffee... sorry, tea on the way back?""* and Tapfree writes: *""Could you get some tea on the way back?"".* It catches your corrections mid-sentence so you don't have to go back and fix them.



If you give it a try, I’d love specific feedback:

* Which app or scenario felt noticeably better (or worse) than usual dictation?
* Any ""wow"" moments with the context understanding?
* What would make it even more useful for you?



I have just released it on [ProductHunt](https://www.producthunt.com/products/tapfree-for-android-2), and would love the feedback, as this is very much a side project and I’m still shaping it.

I kind of feel like an imposter posting this… but I’ve been struggling a lot recently and I don’t know how to talk about this stuff with anyone I know in real life. 

Just to preface in case these are sensitive topics for people… I’ll be talking about abortion and I guess sexual trauma (?) and childhood trauma in general? Not exactly uncommon on this subreddit, but I still wanted to give a heads up. 

I got an abortion over three years ago when I was 18. The circumstances were really weird. I had only been dating the father for three months. We were both virgins/each other’s first and had just started college. It also seemed like he was the more clueless one with regard to how sex worked. He told me he’d never watched porn, and I’d gotten physical with someone in high school but he told me he never had. 

With that context in mind, I’ve been feeling really… confused and conflicted about how sex was with this person. The first time we/I had sex, it was in the heat of the moment and we didn’t have condoms to use. Afterwards, I told him we needed to use condoms in the future, but he seemed reluctant and I ended up going out to buy them by myself just in case. I don’t really remember most of this relationship (or most of my life frankly), but after that point, he just kept refusing to use a condom or would find excuses for why he couldn’t (e.g. too difficult to put on, he can just pull out anyway, it doesn’t feel as good with it on). I felt like I couldn’t say no to having unsafe sex. 

Eventually, when I stood my ground and told him we couldn’t keep having sex without condoms, he suggested that we have anal sex instead of vaginal sex. I agreed to this (for some reason), and it turns out I really enjoyed anal sex even though I felt weird about the whole situation. I think that enjoyment is part of the reason I feel so conflicted about all of this. 

I’m not really sure what caused the pregnancy, but this person would regularly ejaculate in my ass (apologies for the explicit detail). And at one point, while we were having vaginal sex, the condom broke after he came. I got plan B immediately, but I later learned that plan B doesn’t work if you’re ovulating that day (which it’s possible that I was). Regardless, I found out I was pregnant about three months into college/this relationship, and ended up rushing into pursuing an abortion. 

Things that have been bothering me about it: 

\- I felt the change in my body almost immediately after getting pregnant, and got tested basically right away/when my period was three weeks late. I still feel those changes to my body, and it’s disconcerting on a good day, and outright distressing on bad days like today. 

\- I feel like my decision to get an abortion was made without me being in the right mind. I consulted my older brother, and he basically told me it was the only option. My parents are very traditional, religious, and strict Asian immigrants, and we both agreed at the time that they’d likely disown me and refuse to treat their grandchild with love. I’d likely have to drop out of college, and my older brother and I both agreed that the child would have a life “not worth living.” I no longer agree with these judgements that I made, but I also feel like I would still get an abortion even now, not because the child wouldn’t have a life worth living, but because I wouldn’t want to sacrifice the opportunities in life that I have right now. I feel really selfish and guilty about it. 

\- I have a little brother who’s 10 years younger than me, and basically raised him because my parents were working almost all the time when he was younger. I saw his first steps, and they didn’t. He has a speech impediment, and for a while, I was the only person who could understand what he was saying because I spent the most time with him. I regularly go to his parent-teacher meetings, pressured my parents into getting him an autism and adhd diagnosis, and he is just the sweetest kid. I wouldn’t be alive if it wasn’t for him. I adore kids because of my experiences with him, and I can’t imagine it ever being preferable for my little brother to not be alive, even with the difficulties he’s already facing. This makes it more difficult for me to feel like my abortion was the right or moral choice. For the first year after my abortion, I couldn’t hold his hand or look at him the same without wanting to die lol 

\- I coped a lot with humor before, during, and after the abortion. I made a lot of jokes that I feel really disgusted about now, and just feel like I didn’t treat any of it seriously. I know that’s just… a coping thing that happens, but I can’t help but feel like a bad person because of it. 

\- The guy I was dating was quite uninvolved during the whole process. I went to the initial consult for the procedure by myself, and while he came with me to the actual abortion appointment, he stayed in the waiting room the entire time. I feel like it was all so much worse because I didn’t feel supported, and I feel like I still feel super alone all the time. I also can’t help but feel like it’s ultimately always my fault that I end up alone whenever I need people the most. I’m very resistant to accepting support and tend to refuse help. I feel like people will always let me down, and it ends up being a self-fulfilling prophecy because I never ask for what I need. 

\- After the abortion, we basically immediately went back to having unsafe sex. The few times we had vaginal sex, I panicked and cried so much afterwards, that we resorted to only having anal sex. I still don’t understand why we didn’t just stop having sex in general. I also feel conflicted about it because I was often the person initiating the sex, and always agreed to it. And yet I feel really violated looking back on it. I’m realizing I still never feel safe having penetrative sex or even sex in general. 

\- I also got a copper IUD implanted during the abortion procedure, and it’s been causing me so many health issues. My cramps are more debilitating than they ever were before, to the point that I’ve almost puked from pain several times. I also keep getting ovarian cysts, and had to go to the ER about a year ago because one of them burst and I thought my IUD had punctured my internal organs somehow because the pain was so intense. I’ve been thinking about getting the IUD removed for ages, but the prospect of getting it removed makes me feel super unsafe with regards to reintroducing a pregnancy risk (I do not trust myself to not have sex with anyone because of how I’ve handled it in the past and handle it currently). 

I continued dating this guy for about another year. The sex kept getting more and more kinky. We adopted this weird dom/sub dynamic and I bought a strap-on. I’m realizing a lot of it was me trying to feel in control over the sex more than it was me genuinely enjoying being in a dominant role. We also ended up having an open relationship for a bit, and I had sex with one of my friends which I also deeply regret. 

I ended up breaking up with the guy I was dating, not because of the sex issues or the violated trust which I kept brushing under the rug at the time, but because I felt like he had a… sedative effect on me? I just didn’t feel as passionate or ambitious as I was before the relationship. In retrospect, it seems like one of the least important factors involved. 

This is getting really fucking long. If you’re still reading this, thank you? I’m realizing this isn’t even close to the end of all the shit I’ve been ruminating about. 

Within a week of the breakup, I downloaded a dating app (19 year old me was very smart) and started talking to a 23 year old. Our first date happened a week later, and it was… super questionable in retrospect. He lived in his parents’ basement, and after getting coffee, he took me to that basement and we got stoned on his bong and had sex (thankfully with condoms which was… depressingly… a really revolutionary prospect to me and a “green flag”). I had only had weed a handful of times before then, but this eventually devolved into a six month long situationship where I’d have inebriated sex with this guy every week or so and use him to get access to alcohol and weed. There are a couple times where I was so drunk or high that I don’t remember pretty much anything, and the one time I did have sex with him sober, I had a panic attack and went nonverbal immediately after. This started a whole trend of me only having sex when I was inebriated, and regularly being inebriated enough to not remember the sex afterwards. The last time I saw him, we were having drunk sex, and he went inside of me without a condom and I drunkenly had to shove him out. I was freaking out, but after he reluctantly put a condom on, I allowed him to continue fucking me and still stayed the night? The next morning, I left and basically ghosted him because I felt so violated. He kept trying to contact me for about six months, calling me a bitch, sending me 74 text messages consecutively at one point, harassing me with venmo requests after I blocked him, and just refusing to leave me alone. I’m realizing that whole situation has affected me more than I thought. By the second month of knowing this person, I knew that I… really disliked them and their personality, but I stuck around for a whole four more months because I could use him to get inebriated and have sex. I feel really violated thinking about that and the fact that I made sex such a superficial and hedonistic thing, to the extent that I regularly had sex with a person I strongly dislike, and not only that, had so much sex I don’t even remember. 

I ended up hooking up with a couple other people after that, although it didn’t progress into penetrative sex with any of them except for one of them. When we did start having penetrative sex, I freaked out and we literally had to pause to let me smoke weed out the window for 15 minutes. I genuinely could not bring myself to continue sober. I ended up pressuring myself to give the guy head to get him off because I couldn’t handle penetrative sex. After that, I guess it was the last straw, and I decided to not have sex again for a long while until I got my shit together and could actually enforce boundaries for myself and be healthy about it. 

I’m now in the healthiest relationship I’ve ever been in. We took things super slow, and didn’t have sex until the seventh month of dating each other because I knew I had so much baggage around it. I thought I was getting past shit, but I realized this weekend that I never actually fully addressed any of it? 

And I feel really gross and regret having sex with my current partner before I was actually ready for it. 

We decided to be extra slow and intentional about physical intimacy yesterday, and I realized that all penetration was actually making me panic and always has, but that I’ve just been ignoring and suppressing that feeling this entire time. And I hate that I ignore my discomfort so much, and that my parents conditioned me to do so with how I was raised. And I finally set boundaries for the first time about it, and my partner and I didn’t end up continuing the penetrative sex because I realized I wasn’t actually comfortable with it, but I feel so violated about all these times I’ve had penetrative sex even though I wasn’t comfortable. 

And I hate that I can’t have sex healthily, and it feels like I’ve constantly violated myself in the last three years by engaging in sexual acts I wasn’t comfortable with. And I feel like it’s all my fault and I can’t fault the other parties involved because I consented to almost all of it or straight up initiated it myself. And I hate that I often use physical intimacy as a substitute for emotional intimacy. And I hate that I coped with my abortion and having unsafe sex by having more unsafe sex. 

And I don’t think I’ve ever had a healthy relationship with sexual gratification, and I don’t even know where to start.

I’ve been masturbating since I was 4 years old, and I started watching porn at way too young of an age because I had unrestricted internet access, and long before I started having sex with anyone, I was always using sexual gratification and stimulation as a way to cope with stress. 

And even now, I find myself more drawn to than repulsed by sex. I just want to continue ignoring my discomfort and keep getting off. And I hate it so much. And I feel so guilty and gross and ashamed. And I hate that I don’t remember most of my life and especially the past three years because I’ve spent so much of it in an inebriated hedonistic haze. 

I spent most of today stoned because I couldn’t handle shit yet again, and I’m just so tired. I always default to the same self-destructive coping mechanisms, and I’m sick of talking about it with people who know me because it’s always the same shit over and over again.

I’ve just got a creami swirl a few days ago. Costco had it on offer for £240 including VAT. So had to buy it. 

Made my first ice cream a few days ago , turned out pretty good. Was a bit too soft for my liking , but I guess it’s trial and error. 

For this one I just mixed up some Greek style yoghurt , chocolate protein powder and a bit of an almond milk. 

Few questions , seen a few recipes on Instagram and everyone keeps mentioning Fairlife milk , do we have anything similar in the Uk ? Or can I just use normal milk ? 

I only have almond and coconut milk at home for coffees. Don’t drink normal milk. 

Also some of those recipes do mention pudding powder. Do I need that ? I’ve added xantam gum to my Amazon basket , but haven’t bought it yet. 

Thank you ☺️ ",7,1770713245.0,ninjacreami,4,0.74,False
