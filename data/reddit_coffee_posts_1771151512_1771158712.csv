Brain finally shut up but feeling sleepy and foggy. Is this ok? Will it change?,"Hey! I recently got diagnosed with ADHD and started medication yesterday. Got prescribed **Concerta 18mg** and a generic methylphenidate (ratiopharm capsules) to try both.

Yesterday I took the generic in the evening (not ideal, I know). My brain finally shut up, I suddenly wanted to do things after feeling depressed and burnt out for weeks, and everything felt EXTREMELY easy. Zero internal battle about doing things, I JUST DID. Also started noticing sounds and things around me more because my brain shut up, and could finally rest and relax. 

I was hoping for a “veil off” effect like I had with a low-dose atypical antipsychotic that increases dopamine release, but I instead I felt a bit zombiesh and foggy. So it was amazing for focus without distractions, physical tasks, and just peacefully being, but hard for mental work because of the side effects and sleepiness. 

Today started Concerta 18mg and will keep taking it. Definitely helps a bit with mental noise, things do feel a bit easier, feels smoother (or more like nothing compared to the generic one yesterday), but I’m just so sleepy and want to stare at one spot.. Had a coffee and got even sleepier…

I know 18mg is basically a starter dose for adults, so I’m hoping things improve with titration or after some time. Anyone else feel sleepy/foggy at first? Did it get better with higher doses? Also curious if anyone switched from methylphenidate to Vyvanse and found it gave more mental clarity/sharpness?

**TL;DR:** First days on methylphenidate 18mg. Brain is quieter, physical tasks are easy, but feeling extremely sleepy/foggy and not the mental sharpness I hoped for. Is this ok in the beginning? Did any of you experience the same but then it improved? Anyone switch to Vyvanse and feel a difference?",1,1771158607.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

1r5dbyk,https://www.reddit.com/r/solopassions/comments/1r5dbyk/my_first_solo_trip_to_the_balkans_surprised_me/,My first solo trip to the Balkans surprised me: (Found incredible history and affordable hostels everywhere) 🌍,"Before my first solo trip to the Balkans, I pictured a lot of figuring things out on the fly, maybe a few awkward solo meals, and certainly a tighter budget than I was comfortable with. I'd heard bits and pieces, but mostly I just pictured ""Eastern Europe"" in a generic way. What I actually found was a region bursting with incredible, raw history and an almost unbelievable friendliness towards budget solo travelers. It genuinely surprised me how much I loved it.

I spent two weeks navigating Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro, and it was a proper eye-opener.

Here’s a breakdown of what really stood out:

*   **History at Every Turn, and It's *Real***: Forget sterile museums; in the Balkans, history is part of the streetscape.
    *   **Sarajevo** felt like walking through a living textbook. The ""Sarajevo Roses"" (mortar blast scars filled with red resin) are a stark, tangible reminder of the 90s siege. The city’s blend of Ottoman, Austro-Hungarian, and modern architecture tells a complex story on every corner. I spent hours just wandering, reading plaques, and listening to the city's hum.
    *   **Mostar** and its iconic Stari Most (Old Bridge) aren't just pretty; they symbolize resilience. Walking across that bridge, knowing its history, felt significant. You see the dive school where locals jump into the Neretva river, keeping an old tradition alive.
    *   **Kotor, Montenegro** was like stepping into a medieval postcard, but with a real, working town inside its fortress walls. Hiking up to the fortress at sunrise for views of the fjord-like bay wasn't just scenic; you could feel the layers of Venetian, Ottoman, and Slavic history in the stone.

*   **Hostels are Legitimately Affordable (and Often Great)**: This was a huge relief for my budget.
    *   I rarely paid more than **€15-20 a night** for a bed in a well-located hostel, often with breakfast included.
    *   In Sarajevo, my hostel was literally steps from Baščaršija (the Old Town bazaar). In Mostar, it had a beautiful garden and overlooked the river. The staff were always a wealth of local information, pointing me to the best *ćevapi* or telling me about local traditions.
    *   Many hostels arranged tours or shared dinners, which was a nice way to connect with other travelers without feeling forced.

*   **Getting Around is Easy and Budget-Friendly**: Buses are the backbone of regional travel.
    *   Inter-city buses are frequent, generally reliable (though some run on ""Balkan time""), and cheap. A bus from Sarajevo to Mostar was around **€10-12**. Mostar to Kotor was a longer scenic ride for about **€20-25**.
    *   Just show up at the bus station, buy a ticket, and sometimes pay a small fee for your luggage. Simple.

*   **Food & Drink Won't Break the Bank**: Eating well didn't require a splurge.
    *   A hearty local dinner, like a plate of *ćevapi* or *burek*, with a local beer, was consistently under **€10-12** in most places.
    *   Coffee culture is huge, especially in Bosnia. Grabbing a traditional Bosnian coffee and people-watching was a daily ritual that cost a couple of euros.

**The Real Talk & Unexpected Moments:**

I did hit a snag or two, like a bus that was an hour late with no explanation, or finding out a specific museum was closed when I showed up. But these were minor blips. The biggest unexpected joy was the **genuine warmth of the locals**. In Sarajevo, a shop owner offered me Turkish coffee and told me stories about his family, just because I showed interest in his craft. In Mostar, a hostel owner gave me a personal walking tour, sharing insights you wouldn't get from a guidebook.

Solo travel here taught me to slow down and really absorb a place, rather than just ticking off sights. It was less about chasing ""adventure"" and more about soaking in the atmosphere, connecting with history on a personal level, and enjoying the quiet confidence of navigating somewhere new on my own terms.

1r5dbt2,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1r5dbt2/did_i_blow_it/,Did I blow it?,"So there's this barista at a coffee shop I go to that I've had a crush on for a while, probably since before summer but I don't remember exactly when we first met, but it's been a while. I went to work up in Alaska this summer and was out of town for two and a half months, so I wasn't around to see her at all or go into the coffee shop. When I returned I saw her once when I went in, and two other times I popped in and didn't see her. I left on a long trip at the beginning of November and was in Europe for over a month and came back to spend the holidays with fam back home, and was again out of town for a total of about two months. We only ever had short conversations across from the register but I was always very attracted to her even in brief moments like that. 

I've been back in town now for a little over a month and this week went in to the coffee shop for the first time since returning from the trip, and since it was so busy I had to sit at the bar, which overlooks the coffee station while I did some work on my laptop. I was pretty locked in, mostly booking flights for this next trip I'm about to go on, along with some light reading, and a little bit of a wandering eye. To put it lightly, I liked what I saw, and confirmed I'm very attracted to her. Well, I went in the next day with a paper note that had my number on it, but she wasn't there. 

And usually I wouldn't do this many days in a row of going in to see someone, but I'm leaving for another trip on Sunday, so I really wanted to see her again potentially a couple times before I leave. I go in the third day and I see her, not at the counter where I wanted to see her and slide her my number. Instead she was making coffee, we said hi, I ordered, stepped back, looked at her, and got all giddy and smiled, then coughed to compose my self and maybe for her to see me. Got my coffee and left. 

Today rolls around and I go in to see her on my last day in town, I sat in the parking lot for nearly an hour, so nervous to go in and see her, if she's even working. I go in, see the counter and see she's not there. ""Damn."" I said under my breath. But continued up to the counter and briefly checked in the back, where they take the dishes and store everything they aren't using. Thought I completely struck out, not before I saw a dark silhouette past the door, and I knew she was working, and soon walking right behind me, going to hang up some clothes because the coffee shop also doubles as a thrift store. 

I go to the bathroom, take a leak, collect myself real quick, and then go back out there. I go up and ask if there was any clothes she thought might be good for the place I'm going, and we had our first real conversation and it was great. I want her so badly. What I'm hung up about, but through the process of writing this out I feel a little better about is that I didn't give her my number, and honestly I'm crushed to go on the trip and for potentially ruining anything that 'could have been' on my last night in town on vday, or to even be able to get to know each other a little bit more, and for the story, I honestly had the perfect moment to slip her my note and I didn't.. but maybe it would have been too soon? I don't know, I can't help but feel like I totally blew it, not giving her the note saying ""Hey, text me what it takes to make that booty mine =)"". I blew it. Now I'll have to go on this trip knowing that I did, and waiting for who knows how long until I can finally slip her that note, perhaps when I return, yes, perhaps then.. Perhaps I blew it and that's just that and that's all there is to it. But it was the first time we've really interacted when she wasn't behind a counter, so perhaps I dodged a bullet and that would have came on way too strong. So maybe it's not too bad☺️ I really like herrr",1,1771158130.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

There comes a point where you don’t just want to “date"", you want a partner. I think I’ve reached that point. I’m ready for something intentional. Marriage, building a life together, and yes… travelling the world side by side.

A little about me:

I’m currently living abroad and building my own startup on the side. It’s early-stage, exciting, slightly chaotic at times, but completely mine. I’m ambitious, but I also believe life is meant to be enjoyed, not just achieved.

I love art, history, space, and travel. I can spend hours in museums, but I also want to stand in the desert staring at the pyramids of Giza or randomly decide to go pet an alpaca somewhere in South America. I’m Christian by faith, and my values are rooted in honesty, family, and loyalty.

I appreciate meaningful conversations. I admire intelligence and curiosity. I believe money isn’t everything, but financial stability matters when you want to explore the world comfortably (and argue over which country to visit next 😄).

I don’t want to date endlessly without direction, but I also believe connection takes time. I’m looking for a man who is calm, emotionally steady, kind, and thoughtful. Someone easy-going but capable of planning a future. Well-read, well-travelled, open-minded — and most importantly, all heart for me.

If you’re the kind of person who can talk about history over coffee and then book flights on impulse… we might get along.

So… pyramids first, or alpacas?

1r5d6l0,https://www.reddit.com/r/hyatt/comments/1r5d6l0/alila_ventana_big_sur_review/,Alila Ventana Big Sur - Review,"I’m going to preface this by saying that this is going to be a very long review. The intention of this is to help  people can make an informed decision by giving the review I was looking for when I was trying to make up my mind. I had a lot of doubts before going so I hope someone in a similar situation out by giving as much information and detail as I can remember based on own my experiences. 

We were pretty concerned given a lot of the more recent negative reviews we came across on the internet but a lot of them came from people who had either been there before the recent changes or were frequent luxury travelers, so I wanted to add my perspective as a more of an infrequent luxury traveler and a first time experience. Some background about me: I’m from a pretty frugal middle-class family who would never spend this kind of money on a vacation and even now that I’ve “moved up in the world” I would say that I still don’t have much experience with luxury. I have been to a few all-inclusive resorts before, but nothing has been in the same price range as Alila Ventana Big Sur (cash wise) so I would consider this my first major luxury experience. I do enjoy fine dining on occasion so I’m a little on the critical side when it comes to food sometimes, but I’ll eat pretty much anything. I also don’t have any Hyatt status. Anyway, here’s my commentary/review and you can take it with whatever this context is worth to you.

We booked one of the Big Sur Suites for 66k per night using points (transferred from Chase) because it was one of the only rooms available for our specific dates and we wanted to bring our dog so we wanted some extra space. We stayed three nights, which I would say is probably the sweet spot because any longer and I definitely would’ve run out of things to order at the restaurant or things to do. Any shorter and I feel like it'd be too rushed and I wouldn’t have time to settle and relax. Caught really good weather between the rain in Mid February, warmish (60s) during the day but night was a little chilly (40s).

**Pre-arrival/check in:**

Concierge was pretty responsive and able to answer most of my questions over email. Some responses were kind of delayed, but it wasn't anything egregious – I started asking questions about 2 weeks out so I wasn’t in any particular rush. Did some exploring on my own and found out that if you book amenities ahead of time, you can get $50 off for every $150 of activities. So figure out what activities you want to do and do the math from there if you’re trying to save some money.  Activity availability is also released about 2 weeks to one month ahead of your arrival, so if you’re trying to plan months out (which I did initially) you likely won’t see any availability. We also pre-booked in-room dog dining for about $20; if you pay out of pocket, it’s the menu price plus a $10 delivery fee and a percentage fee, so you save about $4 to $6 per meal. I’ll go into the details about the dog dining and activities below. You can also get a discount on alcohol, so if you like to drink, it’s worth to add that before-hand (drinks are about $20, wine varies obviously). Upon check-in, the concierge offered us Rosé and the guy gave us a rundown of the site, told us the rules, explained that you can text them to get picked up pretty much everywhere to go anywhere on the campus. He texted me the number you use if you need anything, gave us the room key and called a cart over to help us grab our luggage and take us to the room. Overall pleasant experience.

**Service:**

About 95% of the staff are warm and welcoming, more than happy to help. Dining staff were very attentive, cleaning crew were super nice and accommodating as well. We had one grumpy driver and the check out guy was a little curt (bordering rude) and seemed like he didn’t want to be there but helped us regardless.

The experience with the texting throughout the stay was pretty good; they usually respond within a few minutes and are very pleasant.

We did have an issue with one package that we pre-booked which was supposed to come with a book, wine and chocolate covered strawberries on arrival, we only got the strawberries initially which I didn’t have an issue with because I forgot that I had prebooked more. I remembered halfway through and texted concierge and they assured me they would have it sorted and they also gave us a one-hour late checkout for the mix up. We coordinated with them to have the wine at dinner on our last night. They also ran out of the book that was supposed to be included, and they didn't communicate that initially, and we didn’t find out until check out, however they had already pre-emptively made up for it by preparing engraved water bottles for us to pick up at check out. I felt like it was a net positive experience since they were proactive and apologetic, but communication could’ve been a little more clear.  

**Room:**                        

The room seemed like it was cleaned thoroughly and the suite we booked felt pretty open since we got a room one with vaulted ceilings. I kind of expected that at this price point they should’ve had a bidet included with the toilet and had higher quality toilet paper for being a luxury resort. They provided normal toiletries like shower cap, dental kits, shower mitt, hair dryer, etc. but did not have a comb/brush. The shampoo, body wash, and soap were all fine, smelled nice I guess it felt luxury enough, definitely a step up from other resorts I’ve been to.

They have a snack bar with two energy bars (a little sweet for me) trail mix, cookies, gummy bears, and a variety of San Pellegrino drinks that they restock daily. They also include a Nespresso machine and water boiler, but the coffee and tea were pretty bad, they tasted old/stale and I don’t consider myself much of a coffee drinker. The fireplace was nice though. The firewood is provided in pre-portioned jute(?) bags which were really easy to light and they lasted about two hours each. There were three bags when we got in and gave us two more whenever we asked. The soaking tub in our room was a nice size and you can mix your own bath salts with dried additions like lavender and roses from the concierge area. I got a peak into a regular king room which was a little smaller but still serviceable and if we didn’t have the dog would have been fine, though they felt a little less private since some of them face one of the open fields.

\*Note: If the weather is good, watch out for the woodpeckers. We had four of them hammering on the side of our building early in the morning, so you might want to consider bringing earplugs if you’re a light sleeper.

**Facilities and Activities:**

* Pools: The pools themselves were clean. Hot tubs were the right temps, regular pools were a tad cold for the weather but not unbearably so. However, at the main pool, they don't do the best job of cleaning up food and drinks people leave behind. It feels a little understaffed when it's busy, so they can't really keep up with the turnover but they'll help out if you ask them to clear an unoccupied chair/table for you. The lounge covers were nice though and when they’re not busy they'll set up a lounge with the cover for you. There was one day that they almost ran out of towels later into the day, though. Still enjoyable.
* Activities: We tried the hydrosols, candle making, and soap making. The staff were super friendly and engaging, but I wouldn't consider them to be experts. They were training some new staff and they also cross-train people to do various activities. Activities were a fun way to fill time and pricing is reasonable for what it is, especially compared similar standalone experiences I’ve tried – but they’re on the shorter side. It’s a great intro if you've never tried it, but if you’ve had any prior experience in any of these things, you might be underwhelmed – at the very least you get to have some nice souvenirs to take home. Probably wouldn't do it again if we were to go back.
* Japanese Bathhouse: Overall a bit underwhelming. There weren’t many people when we went later in the night so it was relatively private but if the bubbles aren’t going you can hear what’s going on around you. Also it didn't seem like they cleaned the Japanese pools often, maybe it was because we went at night but there were bugs and leaves floating around when we went. Didn't give it another try but would be willing to.
* Gym: The gym is clean, functional, and gets the job done for a light workout.
* Hikes: The hikes around the property are nice, well maintained and most of the paths are in the shade and are clearly marked. Apparently, the guided hikes are informative, but we skipped out on those. We did the short self-guided loop around the property but opted out of the more intense one.
* Internet: There’s no cell service for T-Mobile here but the Wi-Fi covers most of the resort area. Don’t expect amazing download speeds but you can stream videos without issue. I had to update something while I was there and it was painstakingly slow, didn’t run a speed test though.

**Food:**

Biggest draw for me was “unlimited” food, since eating is 70% of why I travel most of the time anyway. However, I’m aware that food is very subjective, but these are my ratings from 1-10, 1 being unpalatable, 5 being average relative to what I think it would cost at a similar non-resort establishment  ($20-50 for brunch/pool, $15-25 for apps/dessert, $50-100 for entrée), 10 being unique/amazing and I would go out of my way just for that.

Brunch and In-Room Dining

* Santorini Burger (6/10): It was a pretty solid burger, above average. The fries were a little soft from delivery but still crispy enough. Would’ve ordered again but was informed that in-room dinner + Sur House reservation would be extra charge – assuming it would’ve been 30 like an extra entrée
* Porchetta Sandwich (6.5/10): The flavor was great and the balance was good. It is on the greasier side and could’ve used some more texture, but taste was just that good.
* Yogurt Bowls (5/10): We got this every single day. I liked it because it doesn’t have that tart Greek yogurt flavor. With the fruit, it was more than sweet enough for my taste.
* Short Rib Sandwich (3/10): Very disappointing, underwhelming; I wouldn’t get it again. It was under-seasoned and the textures just weren’t doing it for me.
* Seasonal Fruit Plate (3/10): Definitely not seasonal. They served watermelon and cantaloupe and pineapple in February. Presentation wasn’t special, at least it was sweet but not up to par.
* Mediterranean Green Bowl (4/10): Inconsistent. The one with shrimp was way too salty and bordering on unpalatable, while the second one with salmon was better and more balanced (6/10). Overall flavor was good and there were enough different elements.
* California Frittata (4/10): Pretty good, but the roasted tomatoes didn’t have a great texture and were too tangy making it overpower the mushrooms and made it feel unbalanced.
* Ventana Breakfast (5/10): It met expectations, but they didn't do anything to really elevate it. The potatoes are nice but not special. Bacon and sausage were both solid meat options.
* Tomato Bisque (5/10): About average for what you would expect. It could have been a little creamier, but the focaccia crouton was nice.
* Avocado Tartine (5/10): Good enough; basically avocado toast with an egg, pretty hard to mess it up
* Pastries (6/10): The assorted pastries were generally pretty good; croissant had good texture and banana bread was moist. Jam really helped carry it
* Sorbet (6/10): The lemon sage pear flavor itself was amazing. However, the first time they were so heavy-handed with the lavender salt that it was more salty than it was sweet. It would have been a 7, but the consistency issue knocked it down.
* Green Juice (5/10): Pretty good as well as green juices go, not too grassy but you can’t ever get rid of the celery flavor which really comes down to personal preference, I don’t mind it.
* Red Juice (1/10): Like a non-alcoholic Bloody Mary with Tajin. It was very tomato forward and not my favorite; couldn’t finish it

For dinner we had reservations every night so we could try as many things as possible. Appetizers are unlimited, but you are limited to one entree per person per night. You can add additional entrees for $30, but I wouldn’t consider it very good value.

* Mussels (5/10): The first two nights were good, the sausage had a nice spice and the tomato sauce was done well. However, there was a consistency issue on the last night where they were overcooked and some were served closed and missing the pasta.
* Artichoke hearts (5/10): The taste, flavor, and presentation were good, but it was held back by the tough, stringy parts outer leaves being left on. The nuts were a nice added crunch.
* Scallop Crudo (4/10): The presentation was good, but the balance was off. The scallop is sliced so thin that it gets easily overpowered by the pomegranates and the sauces. Thicker scallop would’ve made the dish easily a 6.
* Kale Salad (5/10): This could’ve been a little above average - the flavors were there, but the ratios could have been better balanced; it had too many tart cherries, which made the salad chewier and tangier than I would’ve enjoyed.
* Baked Feta (4/10): This was okay, but the tomatoes maintained a sharpness and tanginess that didn't mesh well with the cohesiveness of the dish.
* Fennel and Citrus Salad (4/10) Unremarkable. It’s a salad, I guess.
* The Duck (7/10): This was one of our favorites. The presentation, balance, and flavor were good, and it was cooked well (crispy skin, tender meat). We had it two out of the three nights, and it was consistent.
* Carrot Soup (6/10): This was above average and flavorful; we ended up ordering that pretty much every single night. Puffed quinoa was a nice textural element.
* Bistecca - Filet Mignon (6.5/10) and New York Strip (4/10): The Filet Mignon was good and had more of a hearty, meaty steak flavor than just tenderness – a nice plus since most places get the tenderness right but lose the flavor. The fat on the New York didn’t fully render and there was some silver skin left resulting in some unchewable bits. At this level, I consider it below average. The seasoning, mushrooms, onions, and sauce were all good – consistent both nights. I would have liked some starch to go with it though.
* Fish of the Day - Pesce (6/10): We had it one night, (branzino) It was well cooked (meat tender, skin crispy) and well-seasoned. Complimented with the sides. Better than average because fish is so easy to mess up.
* Lobster Risotto (3/10): This was one of the more poorly done dishes. Although the lobster pieces were whole knuckles and claws, the risotto lacked seafood flavor and just came off as heavy butter and garlic. It needed more depth and brightness.
* Citrus Cheesecake (6/10): This citrus cheesecake with passion fruit was my personal favorite. The texture and consistency were good, though it might be a little too sour for some. Honestly nothing too special otherwise but I enjoyed it.
* Olive Oil Cake (6/10): Above average and pretty good overall, had some nice textures and flavors.
* Chocolate Tart (5/10): Average—nothing amazing, nothing terrible.
* Cocktails (5/10) – can’t remember which ones but nothing was bad, citrus sour was nice (as a citrus lover)
* Ventana Pinot Noir (5/10) – not much of a wine person but it was pleasant, fruity? Little tannins so that’s nice  

Poolside Dining

* Carnitas Tacos (4/10): These were a bit below average expectations wise but not terrible. They were a restaurant type with a handmade tortilla, personally prefer street tacos.
* Guacamole and Chips (4/10): A little below average; the guac was definitely starting to brown a bit.
* Mango Passionfruit Sorbet (6/10): Really enjoyed this, not a huge fan of tajin/chamoy since I'm not a sweet + savory person but even with just lime and sorbet I was more than happy.

Dog Dining

* The dog dining is human food, I did taste test it to make sure it was ok for my dog who tends to be a little food sensitive. Overall fine and comes in a little dog bowl. Fish was probably the cleanest, least greasy, and least seasoned option. Chicken and beef were on the greasier side. You specifically have to ask them to poach/boil it and not to salt it if your dog is more sensitive otherwise I think they just toss it on in a pan with a good amount of oil.

**Summary:**

Overall, I feel like at 45,000 - 66,000 points/night, this is a very worthwhile redemption depending how you value your points. It’s a beautiful place to just get away and chill – relaxing is probably the best approach to take. Honestly, if I had paid $2,000 a night in cash, I don’t think it would have met my expectations, and I would’ve been disappointed. There were just too many little things and inconsistencies for that kind of money. However, for points I think the value is there and I’m pretty sure I’ll go again. Hope this helps anyone that is thinking about going. If anyone has any questions will try my best to answer.",3,1771157661.0,hyatt,0,1.0,False

Strange or Hulk level nerfs, where they're potato tier for multiple seasons and eventually buffed to 'fine'. 

Vanguards, on top of everything else aren't exactly going to have 4 seasons of characters being meta shiftingly good.

I mean - parity would be fair, right? Giving vanguards the same levels of dominance as Gambit and co. on 3-4 seasons moving forward? 2-3 heroes so good they not only change the meta, but change the way the game is played? 

Yeah, it's fun to dream - we all know it's not going to happen.

So even if all the issues vanguards were facing were fixed - the point gain, the awful/lacking skins (and yet the devs have the time to go back and add even fancier custom effects to identically priced support ults while tank skins often don't have any custom effects or even custom backgrounds!), the weak roster, the overspecialization, the neutered kits, the bugs, the overabundance of counters, the clunk (why does Cap still need to use a hand destroying latency dependent animation cancel to even be slightly viable?), *you'd still have the vanguard role being 'fine' while other roles have had complete dominance of the game for 4 seasons.* 

**How is that fair?**

And yes, before the inevitable bUt EMmA responses - Emma was a product of a very strange season, where nearly all the other tanks were absolutely awful (note: nearly) and brawl/dive was actually pretty decent - she was OP by dint of being less bad and what she was facing. 

If she were released now, she'd be A tier. Maybe. Would still get 3 tapped by Elsa. 

Well, I'm currently learning strat and holy crap...is this what the game is meant to feel like? Actual fun, rather than living life as a cat in a tumble dryer?

No getting constantly displaced and cc'd?

A point gain that's higher?

I can actually move around and out of LOS from Elsa and Hela shots because I'm not having to play babysitter?

Ults that look \*gorgeous\* and feel strong, rather than giving their strats enough time to go grab a coffee, come back and ult before mine goes off?

Not having to constantly play piano keyboard or carpel tunnel hold release spam for obnoxious animation cancels?

I mean, about all I need to worry about is the odd ballistic Spiderman or BP, and those are...manageable. It's not like being 2 tapped by a hero you should, by all rights, be a counter to.

Honestly, I don't even know if this is fixable because a fix would need to go so far the other way that it's not tenable.

We’ve been having a rough patch for 6 months or so. I thought we were trying to pull ourselves out of the dirt. I got him a plant and these paint by number kits (for an activity we could do together, at home, with basically no monetary investment). Neither of us are painters by any means, it was purely a bid for quality time. 

My sister in law’s birthday also happens to be Valentine’s Day, so we went out for dinner with her and my brother. In the parking lot right before we go in the restaurant, he told me he didn’t get me anything. 

He remembered. He just didn’t do it. He, “ran out of time.” 

I said how could you run out of time? It’s the same day every year. 

We stopped the conversation after that because I didn’t want to ruin SIL’s birthday. I haven’t spoken to him since then because I’m just so hurt and angry, I don’t want to speak emotionally and regret it later. I slept in the spare bedroom last night. 

Am I overreacting? He has apologized. We aren’t huge Valentine’s Day people; I would have been happy with $20 on some flowers/candy and a card or something. 

One of the biggest contributing factors to the rough patch is that I feel like he doesn’t even like me. We went through a period where he wouldn’t tell me anything at all that bothered him, which obviously led to issues because I am not a mind reader. I finally convinced him to tell me when he’s upset with me instead of hiding it. 

Chat, he’s upset with me 24/7. 

Like, multiple times a day, every single day, I do things that bother him. And they’re always different! And unpredictable! In the last two days:

\- I didn’t hep him find his wallet while I was getting ready for work. 

\- we were leaving the house to go to dinner and I put on sneakers. He wanted me to wear snow boots. He did not communicate this wish to me ahead of time. Also, I am perfectly capable of choosing my own footwear. 

\- The dog got into something he left out (I wasn’t watching him closely enough, even though he was \*also home\*). The dog is fine. 

\- I was making coffee at the same time he wanted to make coffee 

And that’s all from the last two days. It’s just never ending. Like I legitimately feel like he just… doesn’t like me. I try to stay positive and tell myself it’s just a rough patch and we’ll get through it, but this v day thing might be it for me. I would understand if there were actual, legitimate complaints about the relationship. Really, tangible things I could work on. I know I’m not perfect and every single one of us could be a better partner. But this just feels impossible. 

Six months ago, none of this was happening. He never missed a holiday/birthday, has always been thoughtful and caring. I thought I had one of the good ones. 

Now I’m here like every other woman with a loser husband. I don’t think he’s cheating. We have each other’s location, he’s home every night, never goes out (like, at all, which is another thing. I wish he \*did\* have more time of a social life). 

I’m mostly just venting, but I’m open to advice. I’m considering splitting up after this. Would that be an overreaction? ",1,1771156997.0,Marriage,4,0.67,False

1r5cqbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/puppy101/comments/1r5cqbg/unlearning_bad_behavior_with_our_cats/,Unlearning bad behavior with our cats!,"Our 10 month old puppy has been living with our 2 cats since she was 3 months old.  She's a mixed breed (20 lbs) but with high prey drive heritage, so we've been very careful with their introductions and time together.  It's been pretty great.  They mostly have co-existed peacefully.  There's NEVER been a bite, a growl...nothing.  She \*has\* been what we call ""Our Enforcer"" - if she perceives that the cats are doing something ""wrong"" (zoomies, scratching on a scratch pad), she rushes over and pushes her nose into their face.  She also loves to follow them around with her nose in their bottoms - she's very nosy.  The cats mostly tolerate it or give her a gentle swipe to the face, which she accepts and backs off.

We recently had a winter storm.  Got 15 inches of snow and 2 weeks of below-zero weather.  Everything shut down.  Our daily walks with her stopped.  Even after the roads were cleared, we couldn't walk her, because there was still 15 inches of snow on the trails (i.e. up to her chest).  We ordered special shoes so that we could drive into town and walk her on city sidewalks, but she wouldn't wear them.  We had to settle for just running her around the house instead and she grew increasingly restless.

She started bugging the cats.  I get it, she was bored.  Us playing with her and running her around wasn't enough.  Bugging = becoming intensely interested in them, constantly following them, staring at/tracking them in every room.  Sometimes if they were up on the back of the couch, she'd rear up and nip at their paws.  Now, she could've bitten, but she didn't.  It wasn't an ""I'm trying to bite you!"" action, more like aggressive play.  She started running after the cats when they were having zoomies.  General harassment.

Snow melted and she's back to getting a ton of exercise...but she's keeping these bad habits with the cats.  We've tried training - LOOK!  LEAVE IT!  NO!  All of those.  We've tried ignoring it.  We've tried short-term leashing her to the coffee table each time she does something.  But I can see on her face that she's not making the connection.  She doesn't look ""guilty"" like she does when she knows that she's misbehaving.  She has a blank look.  LOOK, LEAVE IT, and the leashing...she isn't getting it.  Even when she's being held/leashes, she's staring after the cats. We're not really sure what to do.  Our next step was going to be setting up her old puppy playpen in the living room and popping her in there every time she gets worked up, but if she isn't making the connection, what good will that do?

Someone I know is traveling abroad and has offered to pick up Vertuo line machine and pods for me should I ever want them and that has me intrigued. 

Vertuo line machines are not available where I live on official Nespresso site. Plenty of Nespresso pods are available on Amazon though.

I can see following machines available on Nespresso Hong Kong website. 

1. Vertuo plus Chrome

2. Vertuo Pop 

3. Vertuo Pop +.

4. Vertuo Next.

5. Vertuo Plus Black

6. Vertuo Creatista Stainless Steel

7. Vertuo Latissima Black 

I have read multiple reports about these machines on this thread but always read them without any real attention. But if I were to pick one up, which would be the most fuss free and easy to use and has least complaints? 

I will primarily use them for 1-2 coffees a day at most and that too only black.

I had a rough night tonight and someone brung up a sugar intake when I brung it up. Now I’m curious if I should seek a professional opinion. I’ve been tested before like once a year (sugar test) and I’ve always been in the 90 range for sugar levels. So I was clear, I am pre-diabetic according to doctors due to PCOS (which causes a natural insulin resistance in women). 

For context there was a 2 qt bottle of lemonade+iced tea in the fridge and me not thinking much about it decided to drink that throughout the day as a refreshment. I had drank about 75% of it in around 16-20 hours and did not check the nutrition facts. Said there was 37g of sugar in a 12 oz cup and about 5 servings per bottle so I guessed around 4 servings I had which would mean I consumed 148g of sugar in that time period. Nearly triple the average adult American daily intake. It is important to note other than drinking coffee 3ish times a week I hardly consume sugar daily. Besides what is naturally found in foods. I don’t pay for my own groceries (live with my parents)

If you don’t wanna read all that and just wanna hear my symptoms here they are: 

1. Fatigue

2. Faint

3. My face went numb for a short period of time 

4. Tingling in limbs (the skin was tingly)

5. Slight nausea

6. Minor headache

7. Feeling like I need to manually breathe to get enough oxygen

8. Restlessness (could be due to a lack of sleep)

I’m a tad concerned cause I have not gotten checked in about a year (I get checked annually) and think these signs are enough to warrant a visit. Any recommendations of stuff to do to get the most accurate results before my blood sugar test?",1,1771155210.0,diabetes_t2,3,0.67,False

It was around 11 years ago, when i was still in college (architecture) and was going to start interning for this company, in its main branch (cuz it was the closest to my college)  
I had my hair dyed Pink, white and brown, like the Neapolitan (just google it) but with my natural black as well...and I didnt care much to dye them all black again for the internship (I thought people didn't care, like in college where nearly everyone had some color on their head)  
My fit was also a bit...not that formal (a white shirt, pencil skirt, waist chain for a belt?? i dont remember well...but ik that i was wearing one of those platform heels that had those star designs). I thought that it made me look better than the others....ik...stupid...now i know better (don't worry)  
Though now i wonder whether i should have dyed my hair and borrowed real formal clothes from my roommate, because, that caused my now fiancée to notice me a bit too much??  
I was heading to my supervisor, like, for the 2nd time, but i didn't know where her office was (1st time visiting the office). The office is on the 5th floor of the building, and itself is of 4 floors (and includes the roof). The receptionist was only helpful enough to let me know that the office was on the 7th floor....(mind you, the 7th floor is like a maze with all those doors!)  
i got into the elevator, when this guy entered it, looked at me, made a face (not a pleasant one), ROLLED HIS EYES BTW, and stood beside me after pressing on the same floor button  
  
then a second later, he asked why my hair were pink, and i HAD to reply politely cuz obviously he worked there too and i didn't wanna risk my internship. I told him about the college and dye and how its not a wig or extension, and he only had this weird smile on his face. He then asked which college, i told him the name, then asked me my age, i told him, 21  
he replied with 22  
we exchanged first names  
and i realized that he might also be an intern  
So i asked about his supervisor, he didnt reply and asked me for mine instead, i told him mine's name and we reached the 7th floor.  
  
I was headed to find my supervisor's office, when he told me to go right instead (so he knows her office), then proceeded to walk me to her office instead..

the supervisor looked at me, smiled, the looked at him behind me and made an angry face  
asked him to go, or she will call his dad? I realized that she was his mother (i was wrong) and that he was only paying her a visit, or not, maybe he worked there too and she didn't want him to be a bad influence on me?

well, it was an interesting first day as an intern for me, considering that i dressed up only to make them coffee, print documents and pretty much hold stuff....but what made it interesting was that Axel (it was his name, forgot to mention before), was not doing any of that, instead was mostly on calls, assistant much

but we became friends, he used to help me out and even say that my work (college assignments) were good, we hung out during lunch with his best friend (lets call him) Mike (a 30 year old man, is the head of Finances of the company, still makes fun of me) and his secretary (lets call her) Misha (she was 25 something, and is super chill, and is pretty influential on social media, my current bestie)

And things were going very well,  the CEO (i think 55 at the time?) even acknowledged my work when Axel and Mike presented it to him (yay!)

Axel said that he is in the Management department, and for some reason i had believed it (i was truly stupid back then) 

Then i graduated college and started working at the company full time....  
i was in designing for a few months when all of a sudden the CEO's secretary quit, his assistant filled his spot, and The secretary's assistant's job was open

and Mike (and Axel (i didn't know back then)) suggested me for the job...

and i became the CEO's Secretary's assistant (mouthful ik) and was back to doing my intern work, printing, buying coffee, etc. 

i bought a new house and was house mates with Misha (she used to live in a tiny apartment, my new job paid me good enough.

It had only been an year when the CEO decided to retire, hoping for his son to take his place, planning to train him for around 2 weeks and shifting to Paris and managing stuff from there but a lot less (with the secretary as his personal assistant)

But what happened later that night that the bar was worse, Axel came out....not his sexuality, but about who his father was.....The CEO....he WAS in the management, not earning for a job, but leaning how it all goes down...

and Mike and Misha knew!!! and thought that i knew!!! wtf?!!? but it didn't matter....cuz after the current secretary gone, i was gong to be the next secretary...and mind you...i knew that mf well enough that he was gonna make me do the errands worse than my previous job.  
He was my boss, but he was also my arrogant friend?!??

  
He got trained and got the CEO's position, and the ex-secretary handed me down his work...and it was working out pretty well  
I even got to hire an assistant, Matteo (fake name) (he is gay)(currently married to his hubby)   


all was working out well until one evening we (me and the bozz) went back to my apartment (Misha was out for a friend's wedding) for some work thing....and it ended up with us doing the deed...well...we started dating....  
Our friend group consisted of me, him, Mike, Misha, Mateo, Misha's few exes (they change a bit much) Matoe's husband and Mike's wife



We will be getting married in a few months...wish us luck!!!

I started taking sertraline on January 1st and have been seeing a psychologist for two weeks. Due to my anxiety disorder, I started completely avoiding alcohol and caffeine about six months ago because I became afraid of physical reactions. I explained to my psychologist that I do miss this sometimes, as I love coffee or a cocktail. 

Now my psychologist has discussed the treatment plan with me, and as part of the whole ""exposure,"" she's included that I'm going to start drinking coffee and alcohol again 😂. This isn't even related to my whole traumatic experience and symptoms (one of my symptoms is that my brain can only think about ONE specific annoying thing ALL DAY EVERY DAY EVERY SECOND; it drives me CRAZY). 

This actually surprised me quite a bit. I expected her to say it's good that I'm no longer doing these unhealthy habits looll.

Additional question: Has anyone else experienced these symptoms and can share positive experiences with me? I don't even fxcking care about microplastics, but I've read about it being dangerous, and now my brain sees danger everywhere, every day, every second, in every item containing plastic.

Free Notion Goal Template: For structured 2026 planning.

Obsidian: For local, Git-tracked memory logs.

Willow Voice: The bridge. I talk through my weekly plans and even my frustrations out loud to Willow Voice while I'm making coffee. It transcribes everything instantly, and I just paste the raw text into Notion to reformat later.

This really helped because my thoughts are more complete when I'm not editing them while I think. It’s helped me stay consistent with journaling and made my reviews more honest.

Takeaway: The best way to use Notion is to remove the friction of the ""blank page."" Use your voice to build the content first.

Anyone else here mixing voice and Notion templates to keep their flow consistent?",0,1771154784.0,Notion,3,0.38,False

I 25M, I’ve recently shifted to Bangalore and currently staying near BTM metro. I’m looking to connect with like-minded people and make some new friends here.

A little about me:
• I'm a frontend engineer.
• I enjoy walking and exploring new areas
• Into sports (both playing and watching)
• Know a few card games, so always up for a chill game session

Open to casual meetups, coffee, sports activities, or just good conversations.

Also, if anyone here is from Belgaum or has studied at NIE, Mysore, I’d especially love to connect! Would be great to meet people from back home or college.

That said, I’m open to connecting with anyone who’s interested in hanging out and building a good circle here. Feel free to comment or DM 🙂",1,1771154466.0,BangaloreMeetups,1,1.0,False

1r5c8v8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1r5c8v8/emotional_immaturity_and_codependanceemotional/,Emotional immaturity and co-dependance/emotional anxiety,"2 days ago (Feb 13th) I (36, F) broke up with my partner (30, M) because I'm just great at picking breakup up dates (last one was on NY Eve :/). On a more serious note, we had been dating for 3 months, but I've known him for 5 years. He's a family friend before he was my partner (he actually met my parents before I met him).

For context, we come from very different places. I am French, grew up in a family of therapists, have myself gone to therapy for the best part of the last 15 years. I am an atheist, a feminist, an anti-capitalist leftist blablabla. He is a muslim refugee from a middle eastern country who isn't really fluent in French (and I don't speak Arabic). So our languages, our religions (or absence thereof), our cultures, our traditions are different.

When he told me he liked me and wanted to date me, I was very hesitant. Not only had I been single and happy for the past 4 years, but he was a family friend and all I could think about was ""what if we break up and his relationship with my parents/family suffers because of it?"". Not a great start, I'll admit it, but I still decided to try it out. He's a good-hearted man, has always been nice to me, and I've always been at-ease around him. Looking back at it now, I know it's """"weird"""" that there wasn't really any attraction on my part. I guess it felt more like ""this should be easy because I already know him"". WELL, I WAS WRONG.

3 months in and this man has triggered my emotional anxiety more times than any other of my (long-term!) relationships. Over the course of three months, I've realised that now every time we see each other, I am triggered at one point or another and I end up in tears trying to explain that something he said or did hurt me. Because I also lack self-confidence and am a people-pleaser (yes, I am a real gem), my first reaction to my reactions is to blame/pity myself.  I also thought this relationship was an opportunity to work on everything I've built in therapy for the past 5 years. Of course it's much easier to work on your triggers in therapy when you're single, no one's there to trigger you. But still, I tried. I explained, nay, dissected my feelings for him, wrote long heartfelt messages, translated them into Arabic, spent hours careful picking and organizing my words so that he knew exactly how my brain functions, what triggers me, how he can help me when I'm triggered, etc.

I wouldn't say it was inefficient, but it wasn't efficient either. Even after all these messages, triggering behaviors and words kept happening. Things like telling me I'm exaggerating when I'm mad and shocked because my consent isn't respected, telling me I'm ""a little girl"" or ""have a closed mind"" when I'm defending gay rights or abortion rights (yes, with vigor and even maybe some rage because these things fucking matter!), telling me I'm ""stirring up shit"" when I'm explaining I'm going to meet an old friend for coffee (the friend in question is a happily married man with children), calling me out when I try to rest before cooking for us when we both come back home tired and hungry, laughing at my face when I get mad because he cut me off in a conversation where I was genuinely trying to understand him (damn, writing these things down is eye-opening; I can't believe this all happened in the span of only three months).

I've invested so much emotionally in this relationship that I am actually EXHAUSTED. Whenever I came back home from a weekend with him, I felt like I could sleep for days. And every time, I came back with doubts, wondering how long I should continue this relationship. Breaking up wasn't easy either, because he didn't seem to understand that all these ""little things"", as he called them, were reason enough for me to want to get away. It makes sense though, in a culture where you first get married and then deal with whatever bullshit your partner carries with them without ever considering divorce unless they physically beat you, steal from you or absolutely disrespect your family. Even when breaking up, I had to insist for my needs to be heard and respected (he's been insisting on calling me everyday to wish me good night, tell me about his day or something else). 

It's tough breaking up with someone who has good intentions but just doesn't KNOW how to behave like an emotionally mature man. With someone who has a good heart but has no experience of romantic relationships (I am his first girlfriend). And it's such a shame. I feel so sad for what this relationship could've been. We shared a lot of great moments too, real complicity, dreams about the future, etc. It's tough being the one to break up a relationship when you have emotional anxiety, codependency tendencies and a fear of abandonment. I've been going through the motions: sadness, anger, loss, regret, grief, sadness again, etc. 

Anyone else been through something similar (or not) and want to share what you think?

Not because they're cheap.

Because nobody's built the right web app.

They have tried expensive software. Didn't work. Went back to spreadsheets.

# The ""Solved Wrong"" Market

Most founders think the opportunity is in unsolved problems.

Wrong.

The real money is in badly solved problems.

Walk into any independent coffee shop on a Saturday morning.

Ask the manager what their biggest headache is.

They won't say ""customer acquisition"" or ""marketing.""

They'll say ""scheduling.""

Then they'll show you a group chat with 47 unread messages and a printed calendar covered in crossed-out names.

You expect them to say they haven't tried scheduling software.

But they have.

Deputy. When I Work. Homebase.

All of them failed.

Reality beats expectation when you realize the market isn't empty, it's full of expensive failures.

That's your edge.

[In case you prefer videos.](https://youtu.be/K4J_QdCM_KI?si=prF29HIpnX748d8t)

# 1. Shift Scheduling for Cafes (That Actually Works)



https://preview.redd.it/kern1txy5njg1.png?width=1392&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae77eb42fed5b115fea85f1cff70b50a58364c8e

Here's seven thirty AM on a Saturday.

Someone calls in sick.

The manager stops making drinks.

Opens the group chat.

Types: ""Anyone available to cover Emily's shift? 9 to 3 today.""

Then waits.

Twenty minutes of checking her phone between customers.

Three people respond ""sorry can't.""

One doesn't respond at all because they're probably still asleep and this is exactly why they called in sick last month.

Finally: ""I can do 11 to 3 if someone covers the first two hours.""

Now she's coordinating a two-person coverage swap via text while the line backs up and someone just ordered a half-caff oat milk latte with extra foam.

This happens multiple times per week.

She's tried scheduling apps.

All of them cost $50 to 80/month.

All of them require employees to download apps and create accounts.

Half the staff never sets it up because they can't remember another password and yes they know about password managers but that requires downloading another app.

So she goes back to the group chat.

Not because it works.

Because it's the least bad option she's found.

**What she actually needs:**

A shift swap board that works like Craigslist.

Employee posts ""I need Friday off"" with one tap.

Other employees claim it with one tap.

No accounts. No downloads. Just phone numbers linked to a web interface.

Text a code, you're in.

**The build:**

Bubble + Twilio. Two weeks. Airtable for availability storage.

When someone posts a shift, system auto-texts only people marked available for that time.

First response gets it. Manager gets notified. Done.

**The economics:**

One Saturday running fully staffed instead of short = $200 extra sales.

Your app costs $49/month.

Pays for itself in three hours.

But here's why this works when Deputy failed.

Deputy tried to be enterprise workforce management.

Forecasting. Labor analytics. Compliance tracking.

Cafes don't want workforce management.

They want ""who can cover Sarah's shift right now.""

Solve that one thing perfectly, you win.

# 2. Customer Equipment Tracking for Repair Shops (Before Someone Gets Sued)

https://preview.redd.it/ib1wopjx5njg1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0b192faff3e2303855aaed766f8e8af549ad5dc0

  


A customer walks into a phone repair shop.

""I dropped off my laptop three weeks ago. Do you still have it?""

Counter person: ""Let me check.""

Walks to the back.

Twenty laptops on shelves. Fifteen phones. Eight tablets.

Labeled with sticky notes: ""screen crack"" ""battery"" ""water damage.""

One sticky note has fallen off.

Twelve minutes of trying to figure out which laptop belongs to which customer.

Seventy percent sure they found the right one.

This isn't inconvenient.

This is catastrophic.

Because if they're wrong?

They just gave someone else's laptop with financial records, family photos, client files to the wrong person.

Not a mistake.

A lawsuit.

Complete business destruction.

And here's what makes it worse.

That laptop? Belonged to a lawyer. With client files on it.

Now the shop isn't dealing with one angry customer.

Legal malpractice. Data breach. Regulatory violations.

One sticky note falling off just ended their business.

All because they were using the same organizational system as a third-grade art project.

They know this is a problem.

They've Googled ""repair shop management software.""

Found RepairShopr. ServiceBell. $120+/month.

Barcode printers. Thermal labels. Hardware setup.

Plus inventory management, CRM tools, marketing automation, accounting integrations.

Shop owner looks at the features and thinks: ""I just need to know which device belongs to which customer.""

But that's one feature inside sixteen modules they'd have to learn.

Back to sticky notes.

Not because it works.

Because it's the least bad option.

**The dry cleaner solution:**

You know who solved this perfectly? Dry cleaners.

Drop off clothes. Get ticket. Every item tagged. Tag matches ticket.

Customer returns. Scan ticket. Find exact item instantly.

Zero confusion. Zero ""let me check the back."" Zero anxiety.

Repair shops need the same thing.

Turns out the technology that works for your wrinkled shirt also works for your $2,000 laptop.

**The build:**

Glide + Airtable. Ten days.

Customer drops off device. Shop takes photo on phone (front, back, any marks).

App generates QR code. Prints label. Sticks on device.

Customer gets QR code texted immediately.

When they pick up, they show the code.

Shop scans with phone.

App pulls up photo, intake notes, shelf location instantly.

""Yes, this is yours. Here's the photo from drop-off.""

Customer sees their device on-screen before the owner walks to the back.

Certainty. Confidence. Trust.

**The math:**

One lawsuit for giving wrong device to wrong customer = $20K in legal fees.

Before settlement. Before reputation damage. Before Google reviews saying ""they lost my laptop.""

You charge $79/month.

They'd pay $500/month because one mistake destroys everything.

And it spreads fast.

Repair shops live in tight Facebook groups.

""Phone Repair Business Owners."" ""Computer Repair Entrepreneurs.""

One shop posts: ""Started using QR tracking. Customer came in, pulled up device photo in 3 seconds. Blown away.""

Forty comments: ""What system?"" ""Does it track tablets?"" ""Can I get serial numbers?""

Everyone in this industry has an ""almost gave wrong device"" story.

Usually told over beers with that nervous laugh people do when they dodged a bullet.

# 3. Supplier Price Comparison for Restaurants (The $1,600 Monthly Bleed)

https://preview.redd.it/9h1bb92t5njg1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=033e97b21e0292c627f8d4263a5bf867cd38c937

  


Sixteen hundred dollars.

That's what the average small restaurant overpays on food costs. Every. Single. Month.

Not because they're bad negotiators.

Because they don't have time to compare prices.

**Monday morning at a restaurant:**

Chef opens walk-in cooler.

Low on chicken, tomatoes, flour.

Calls main supplier. Places order.

Never checks if another supplier has chicken for $0.30 less per pound.

Why not?

Because comparing means calling four suppliers, requesting quotes, waiting for callbacks, manually comparing numbers.

Ninety minutes.

Lunch service starts in three hours.

Orders from whoever picks up first.

Every week. Fifty-two weeks a year.

$1,600/month lost to price inefficiency.

That's $19,200 annually.

Which is roughly the cost of a used Toyota Camry just evaporating into thin air because nobody has time to make four phone calls.

They've looked for solutions.

MarketMan. BlueCart.

Both require all suppliers to join the platform.

Half aren't on it.

The ones who are? Charge 3% transaction fees.

Back to phone calls.

Least bad option.

# 

Most restaurant tech companies try to solve everything.

Inventory. Recipe costing. Menu engineering. Staff scheduling. Supplier payments. POS integration.

They build a ""restaurant operating system.""

Nobody buys it.

Because when you solve everything, you solve nothing deeply enough.

Restaurant owners look at your sixteen-module feature list and think: ""Which of these do I actually need?""

Can't answer quickly? They don't buy.

Get positioning wrong, you compete with Toast on feature count.

Get it right, you compete on surgical pain removal and command premium pricing.

**What they actually need:**

Text-based supplier comparison.

Chef texts: ""20 lbs chicken breast, 30 lbs tomatoes, 10 lbs flour.""

System auto-sends to three preferred suppliers.

Suppliers text back prices within 30 minutes.

System shows comparison table.

Chef sees: Supplier A best for chicken. Supplier B best for tomatoes.

Taps to select best per item.

System generates purchase orders. Sends to winning suppliers.

Four minutes instead of ninety.

**The build:**

Twilio + Airtable + simple web interface. Three weeks.

No supplier onboarding. No API integrations. No transaction fees.

Just automated texts replacing phone calls.

**The economics:**

One month of optimized purchasing saves $1,600.

Your app costs $99/month.

Pays for itself in two days.

They'd pay triple because the alternative is throwing away $20K annually.

And when the chef shows the owner they saved $400 in week one?

Owner texts three other restaurant owners immediately.

Because restaurant owners constantly text each other: ""Who's your supplier for X?"" ""What are you paying for Y?""

It's like a group chat but with people who actually respond because money is involved.

Word spreads fast.

# 4. SMS Loyalty for Local Retailers (Because Punch Cards Are Broken)





https://preview.redd.it/f5j093wm5njg1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c45dabfce02259d6d31fbc09808a76707c9a628b

Five years ago, small retailers competed with Amazon on convenience.

They lost.

In 2026, they compete on relationship and loyalty.

And they're still using punch cards.

Walk into any boutique.

""Do you have a loyalty program?""

They show you a physical card. ""Buy 9, get the 10th free.""

Then: ""Half our customers lose the cards. The other half forget to bring them.""

They're rewarding loyalty based on who remembers to carry cardboard.

This is like trying to run a marathon but only counting the steps you remember to track on your Fitbit.

This isn't just inefficient.

It's lost revenue.

A customer who shops 6x/year will shop 12x if you remind them they're three purchases from a reward.

Double the revenue per customer.

They've tried Square Loyalty. FiveStars. $75 to 150/month.

Both require customers to download apps or sign up via email.

Adoption rate: 15%.

Spent three months getting signups. Eight customers downloaded the app.

They abandoned it.

Back to punch cards.

**What they actually need:**

SMS-based loyalty. Zero customer friction.

Customer buys something.

Cashier: ""What's your phone number?""

Customer gives number.

Auto-text: ""Thanks for shopping at Main Street Boutique! You've earned 1 point. 4 more until your free item.""

No app. No email. No card. No password.

Just phone numbers they already have.

Next purchase, cashier types number again.

Auto-text: ""You've earned another point! 3 more until reward.""

Hit threshold? Text with code.

""Congrats! You've earned your free item. Show code LOYAL247 at checkout.""

Done.

**The build:**

Twilio + Airtable. Two weeks.

Track by phone number. Auto-text after transactions. Store reward thresholds.

**The economics:**

Retailer doing $200K annually increases visit frequency 30% = $60K added revenue.

Your app: $59/month.

Pays for itself if it brings back three customers who would've forgotten the store.

They'd pay double because Amazon is remarketing to those customers daily via email and push notifications.

Meanwhile the boutique is hoping people remember they exist when they walk past the storefront.

# 5. Prepaid Class Recovery for Studios (Finding Money Already Paid)



https://preview.redd.it/ll4sk39f5njg1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5cdffbf4675ba79c5925457c730b38fb0061d9e8



Yoga studios. Music schools. Martial arts gyms.

They lose thousands yearly on unpaid classes.

Someone buys a 10-class package upfront.

Attends seven.

Never comes back.

Three prepaid classes sitting there.

No automatic follow-up because their system doesn't track package expiration.

It's like if your gym membership actually wanted you to show up.

Wild concept.

They've tried Mindbody. Pike13. $120 to 180/month.

Scheduling. Billing. Marketing automation. Website builders.

All they need: ""Text when unused prepaid classes are expiring.""

One feature. Buried in sixteen modules.

**The build:**

Airtable + Twilio.

Track package usage per student.

Auto-text three days before expiration: ""Hey, you have 3 yoga classes left. They expire in 12 days. Want to book?""

Forty percent book immediately.

Found money.

Your app: $49/month.

Generates $500 recovered revenue first week.

# 6. Quote Follow-Up for Landscapers (Because Memory Isn't A System)

Landscaping companies send dozens of quotes monthly.

Lawn care. Tree trimming. Seasonal cleanup.

Tracked via: text messages, emails, paper notes.

Half the time? Forget to follow up.

Other half? Follow up too late. Customer already hired someone else.

The someone else who followed up.

Turns out ""I'll get back to you"" is not actually a business strategy.

Jobber. LawnPro. $90 to 150/month.

Job scheduling. GPS routing. Invoicing. Payment processing.

All they need: ""Remind me to follow up before customers forget.""

**The build:**

Airtable + automated SMS.

Send quote? Log with one tap.

System auto-texts customer two days later: ""Hi, Green Lawn Services. Following up on the quote. Questions?""

Also auto-reminds landscaper to call five days later if no response.

Close rate jumps from 30% to 47%.

Your app: $59/month.

One extra job/month pays for it 3x over.

# 7. Text-Based Rescheduling for Cleaners (Stop Playing Phone Tag)

Cleaning companies. Pest control. Recurring schedules.

Every two weeks or monthly.

Customers reschedule constantly.

Vacations. Sick days. Construction. Emergencies.

Business owner spends hours weekly playing phone tag for new appointments.

You know that game where you call someone, they don't answer, they call back, you don't answer, repeat for eternity?

That, but it's literally your job.

ScheduleOnce. Calendly.

Both require customers to create accounts and browse calendar availability.

Their customers are 45 to 70 years old.

Don't want to ""log in.""

Want to text.

**The build:**

SMS-based rescheduling.

Customer texts: ""Need to move Friday cleaning.""

System recognizes phone number.

Texts back three alternatives from real-time availability: ""Thursday 2pm, Saturday 10am, Monday 9am. Reply with number.""

Customer texts ""2"" for Saturday.

System confirms. Updates schedule. Texts cleaner.

Done.

Thirty seconds instead of four phone calls.

Your app: $69/month.

Saves 10 hours admin time monthly = $400 labor cost.

# The Pattern You're Missing

Every idea here has three things in common:

**1. Existing solutions cost $90 to 180/month**

**2. They include 15 features the customer doesn't need**

**3. The customer went back to manual chaos**

That gap between pen-and-paper and enterprise bloat is where you print money.

Because small businesses will pay premium prices for tools that:

Solve ONE problem completely.

Require zero learning curve.

Work within existing workflow.

Prevent catastrophic consequences.

They're not buying productivity.

They're buying catastrophe insurance.

# Your 48-Hour Homework

Not next week. Not when you feel ready.

The next two days.

Pick one idea.

Open Google Maps.

Type: ""\[business type\] + your city""

Call the first five businesses.

""I'm researching small business operations. What operational problem breaks multiple times per week that you wish someone would just fix?""

Don't pitch. Listen. Record answers.

I guarantee three will describe a $50 to 100/month problem you can solve in 2 to 3 weeks.

And if they say something different?

Even better.

Because now you've learned something real that no YouTube video could teach you.

That's the insight that turns a generic idea into a web app people actually pay for.

# The Real Opportunity

Everyone's chasing AI features and viral growth.

Meanwhile, there are seven-figure opportunities in boring SMS automation for unsexy industries.

The highest-paying web apps in 2026 don't solve interesting problems.

They solve expensive problems.

Stop building apps people want.

Start building apps people are terrified to live without.

**P.S.** If you're building something and want to validate before wasting months, I built a tool for that. It's called [foundrfrnd](https://foundrfrnd.com/). Investigates your idea using Pain/Intent/Gap signals. Tells you proceed, fix, or kill.

1r5c3uk,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1r5c3uk/just_something_interesting_i_wanted_to_share_its/,"Just something interesting I wanted to share.. It's a long read, but if you make it all the way, I'll be very fucking impressed","I'm 36. I was diagnosed with BP2 10 years ago and Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD, or GERD in the US) 17 years ago.

From well before I was diagnosed with BP2, and even more so ever since then, until very recently, my identity and the way I perceived and focused on my health was completely centred around having bipolar. This changed massively late last year after I began to adjust my lithium dose with a psychiatrist. I was feeling really numb and lacking in anything close to an emotional range after a decade on a fairly high dose (1350mg), so lowering it seemed my only real option. The psych agreed.

After a few months on a lower dose (900mg), the psych (who I was seeing at a free clinic) told me for some unknown reason that they wouldn't be able to see me again for at least 3 months, and told me to call them again ""in 3 months, or maybe 6 months"".

I felt really fucking angry and abandoned. To make things even more stressful, I could feel myself slipping back into depression, a place I rarely had to fully revisit since the early days of being on meds. So after no more than 2 months on the lower dose, without a psych, I increased my dose back to its original level.

This is where GORD comes into the story. Barely 2 weeks back on 1350mg lithium, my reflux symptoms, which had been controlled enough over the 17 years I've been on rabeprazole (a long-lasting proton pump inhibitor, which reduces acid production in the stomach), suddenly came back with a vengeance. All of my early, unmedicated symptoms returned worse than ever, making every day a physical nightmare. A near-constant lump in my throat, the taste of acid in my mouth, bloating, fire rising up my oesophagus, etc.. Turns out lithium increases reflux symptoms, which can appear controlled for years and years until something triggers them to resurface.

I adjusted my diet even more radically than I'd done years ago, cutting out every acidic food I could identify. I quit drinking, I quit marijuana, I stopped drinking coffee, and I cut down how much I smoked cigarettes (I'd love to quit them too but this one is proving the hardest). I've now gone 5 weeks without a doob after 20 years of getting high basically every day, and right now I have absolutely no desire to go back. Not just for my physical health, but for what I've realised about my mental health in the time since I began to make all these changes.

However, the reflux symptoms didn't improve. I saw a specialist who increased my rabeprazole dose and am waiting for the results of a gastroscopy. And I lowered my dose of lithium back again to 900mg, because the risk of depression or hypomania returning was suddenly a far more attractive option to endless heartburn and reflux and a diet so specialised it was killing all my joy. My focus has shifted away from dealing with bipolar and firmly onto managing GORD. Everything I put in my body is chosen, and gut health is now my major obsession. It's hard finding ingredients and recipes that I can actually eat, but the more I try, the more I discover is possible, so I'm determined to keep going, 

Back on the 900mg, I can feel my moods flowing much faster than before, and hypomania is once again really present. But I am more stable, more creative, more emotionally connected, more socially connected, more alive. Hypomania is becoming something I am learning to live with and utilise for my own good, instead of an intoxicating rush that takes over.

TLDR: Since being forced to focus on my physical health, in particular my diet and gut health, my bipolar has actually become easier to manage. Highly recommend it, regardless of the condition of your stomach!",1,1771153925.0,bipolar2,0,1.0,False

Making the rank of 'priestess' gives me 2nd* *circle divine spells, including Hold Person, a charm so powerful it should probably be banned by any goodly nation. But it's second-nature to me now, this is the frontier, it is kill or be killed. I don't like it, but it is what it is. I mean, I'm not part of any official hierarchy at the temples obviously like Uncle Gal is, but I'm growing in power, as is Lire. Watching her toss kobolds and goblins about like she was a storm giant brings a smile to my face.*

*I like it here in Phlan. Stay in bed later, we smoke (Yimna, no idea where Hayley gets it), we drink whiskey, (High West Campfire, or 'Amberfire', comes in small bottles), we fuck (each other in case you were wondering). We get up late, have breakfast – sausage patties, bacon rashers, kaethae (Maztican coffee), fruit juice, hashbrowns (another plant imported decades ago from Maztica). That sets us up until evening meal so we need not take picnics into the ruins.*

*Rest of the day, we're either in the ruins clearing patrols, or training, or we walk the town (and fuck in the gardens). Lire's with me always when we're not training and I couldn't be happier with my life. In the evening we go out for a bit; gambling as well as more booze and smokes, table-dancing if we're drunk enough (and the grown-ups aren't there!) then back to our room where we fuck until we fall asleep. It's everything I ever wanted out of life.*

*But today we have something special, Sasha has a mission for us! There is to be some item auctioned off in Podol Plaza, which is still held by the monsters. We are to attend there in secret and discover what it is.* 

https://preview.redd.it/w4h0q3a46njg1.png?width=558&format=png&auto=webp&s=daddbb343f21c88e2ffe2f190259432bc52a748a

*We change at Kuto's Well, wearing hooded cloaks taken from orcs and hobgoblins, helms, and some judicious illusions cast by Elaethan and Galaeron for those of us who are obviously not human. The fathers warn us that orcs and their kin are not all that bright, but they are not completely stupid either, and we should avoid attention and trouble for this one.* 

*“That means you, lass,” Thoradin says directly at Lire.*

*We set off going west from Kuto's Well, feeling a bit off in all our disguises. It still smells musty, no matter how times I've washed it in the well.*

“*I'm surprised they even HAVE things like auctions,” I say as we head out. “I mean, they might have the equivalent of taverns, but... do they have shops? Temples? Training facilities or schools?”*

“*They carry coins, they must trade?” Hayley ponders. “I don't think we'll find any theatres or fine arts though...!”*

“*Do they have dancing girls?” Lire wonders. “We don't see many women ever. Maybe that's a good thing...?”*

https://preview.redd.it/bchfmvka6njg1.jpg?width=961&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ee60038dd24e74d0136b0f90b7f985ebea7b978d

*Whatever the extent of orc culture, the Plaza is teeming this evening. Auction day must be popular. I have a crazy vision of some hobgoblin asking for bids for a rosewood chair or nice lounger, maybe an antique vase that isn't too cracked?*

*Half of us are good at sneaking, but I'm not, and Lire's about as subtle as a hammer to the face. So we stick to the disguises.*

*It feels weird to be in such close proximity to so many warbands and not be fighting. We all know we'll have to fight our way out if we are discovered, so we stay quiet and keep our eyes open.*

*I'm amazed at how well this disguise thing works, even with the illusions. We get a few catcalls, a few swaggering bullies and glowering looks, but no creature seems to realise what we are. A few monsters are g*r*owing curious about us, so we duck into a nearby building to wait for a few minutes. It is an abandoned shop; broken shelves are all that remain. When the coast is clear, we set out.*

*4/ The auction block is by a central building in the main square; we just follow th*e t*hrongs of creatures. The auctioneer appears to be human. We watch and listen.* 

[Another unique graphic! I miss these](https://preview.redd.it/yyen10kg6njg1.jpg?width=955&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=955f7be1e461f0b0cf02ad428be01246c3d35aac)

*The auctioneer cries: ""Creatures of all ages, welcome to this auction for an item both magical and powerful!"" It looks like the auctioneer has either a wand or a staff. Would that even be of interest to monsters?*

*We need to see what it is, so we move in closer. The creatures nearby shoot us angry glances, but grumble and turn away. Elf-dad and uncle study the item from afar.*

“*It's not a major artefact,” Galaeron says quietly. “I think it's a Wand of Fear?”*

“*Probably don't even have the command word for it!” Elaethan chuckles.*

*The bidding escalates to over five thousand gold pieces – a high bid from a human in plain clothes, next to an ogre. That's way beyond any warband we've seen so far. We have money in the Holding bag, we could put in a bid, but we don't want to blow our cover. So we just wait for the winner.*

*""Going... going.... gone!"" the auctioneer cries The robed man and an ogre exchange the wand and a large bag, then disappear into the crowd. The auction over, the warbands grumble and turn away, most of them heading west towards what looks like some kind of watering-hole.*

*We've seen enough, and head back. It's good to get out of these disguises, the linger of orc musk clings to anything they touch.*

“*I need a bath,” Hayley mutters. “An acid bath!”*

“*That's a thing in Calimport? Yikes,” I jest. “I have Felsel flower oil and some Jassal if you need some?”*

*My mother died when I was seven, so I remember her talking about perfumes back in Kara-Tur. She said she liked Jasmine dusk, but I've never seen it at trade in the west.*

*Back in Phlan, Sasha rewards us for your report. “Your success at Podol Plaza is noted. Here is your reward.”*

*The next morning, we head out again, this time without the disguises. Time to clean house. This time, the warbands object to our presence. It doesn't end well for them.*

*1/ Here is a small shrine - symbols of Bane, the chief god of evil, have replaced those of the long-suffering Ilmater. There is a robed orc sitting here – we attack him and his guards, and afterwards discover half a dozen leather holy symbols with the markings of the Banite faith. They don't detect as evil or anything, so uncle keeps them – he collects trinkets from various faiths, even wicked one. Perhaps they will come in useful later?*

*2/ We head west to the building we saw yesterday, and it's what we expected – an actual tavern for monsters! A sign proclaiming 'The Pitt' hangs above the door. Time to see how the other half lives - or at least drinks.*

*The tavern is crowded – but Lire opens the door into the face of a drunken pirate.(I note he's human, so reprobate men must be welcome among the monsters at least to some degree).*

*""One of you shall pay for this insult!” he bridles. “Who will it be?""*

*Lire draws her sword. “I'll take you all on!”*

*So much for subt*l*ety. But she's done well to hold it together as long as she has. All nine Hells break loose as the angry patrons attack. Sleep and Hold spells are liberally thrown, and the walls are painted with blood. When it's over, the bar looks like it was destroyed by experts. Even Lirevele seems impressed by her handiwork.*

*But the place is trashed now, and there's no booze or smokes that I want any part of. We set off to clear the south of the Plaza, fighting sporadic warbands as we go, but they are no match for us now.*

*Uncle Galaeron notes some small markings to the south-west, unobtrusive buildings that have small marks known to human faiths. We explore, finding a small group of missionaries are hiding out in secure back rooms with grim-faced guards. The faithful of Ilmater often have hidden bases in wicked places – it is a mark of their faith to take risks and risk suffering to provide succour.*

*A young woman comes forward. ""We provide help for those who can reach us. Are you in need of healing? You can rest here as long as you wish."" She then leaves us to our own devices.*

*This makes a nice little rest-spot as we explore – we can even get items identified in the field, see what's worth keeping or selling.*

*We do not want to go any further west though -the forbidding Stojanow Gate guards Valjevo Castle, where this mysterious 'monster boss' is trying to unite the warbands. Storming that castle is likely beyond us for now*

*Otherwise, it's just patrolling and cleaning up here on the Plaza. No great, glorious battles, no heroic last-stands, just grim slaying, 'wetwork' as Elaethan calls it. I don't even hate the monsters – it's not personal, they are just in the way. It's more like pest extermination than genocide, really. Sometimes the adventuring life is just workday rather than glamourous, no more exciting than labouring at the docks. Eventually they get the hint and the warband abandon the Plaza. Time to call this one in and get the guards in to hold it.*

*We have a nice surprise waiting for us back with Sasha – there's no commission for clearing the Plaza but we get a reward anyway. The Council are not the jerks I fully expected them to be. I'm starting to like it here.*

***COMMENTARY:*** One of the best things about *Pool of Radiance* is the sheer variety of missions. Later gold box games have a more epic story, leaning in to 'high fantasy' more, but this game really nails the experience of lower-level adventuring, with more emphasis on taking care, fighting mostly when you must, and seeking other solutions like stealth or trickery over violence. AD&D was a lot deadlier than subsequent editions, so the play-style rewarded cunning and knowing your limits.

Also, I like how so many missions here have failure states, or multiple outcomes. You fail the auction if you are discovered, as you can many other missions in this game. You can, for example, attack the nomads, or the lizardmen, or even Skullcrusher or Fatima. You can surrender to the Zhents, the Buccaneers or even Norris the Gray, sent home in disgrace rather than triumph. Damn, you can even side with Tyranthraxus at the end and fight your dissenting party members! (It's a non-standard game over if everyone does this though).

The rest of the series tends to be very linear, with few options compared to this one – even if the story is stronger and the game interface is greatly improved.

There's nothing really like the auction in subsequent games unfortunately, and that's a real pity.",8,1771153751.0,goldbox,0,1.0,False

1r5bzt4,https://www.reddit.com/r/sissiesexstories/comments/1r5bzt4/my_gym_buddy_part_1/,"My Gym Buddy, part 1.","Hi There, My name is Ben, although no one ever calls me that anymore. To an outsider, you would have thought I had it all - I was 25 years old, I had a great software job, a hot girlfriend. I had an active friend group. I was living, not in NYC, but at least in Chicago. In the lottery of life I had, well, not the jackpot ticket, but AT LEAST 4 matching numbers. 

Despite this, I always felt as if I was putting on a facade. I felt dead behind the eyes. Every day was the same. Wake. Coffee on. Stretch. Wake my girlfriend. Gym. Shower. Work. Home. Netflix. Dinner. Bed. It all blurred into one.

One week, my girlfriend got a new job, It was a big step up, more responsibility, more money, better for her career. The only problem was that it was in New York. And I had to be in the office in Chicago 4 days a week. Like any loving boyfriend would do, I swallowed any doubts I had- I had to support her in this. Even though I worried about going long distance. What if she found someone else? Regardless, she accepted the job, and moved out.

The next week, I went to the gym by myself. I was squatting, and struggling with the weight when I saw him. 6'6"", at least 250lbs of muscle, unlike short and overweight body. I blurted out ""I need a spot, and straightaway he came over, lifted the bar off my back and racked it. ""Call me Mike"", he said, and I told him my name in turn. He'd just moved to the area from California, and he was looking for friends. I gave him my number and offered to show him around the place. With Rebecca, my girlfriend, away, I needed new friends. Mike also gave me some pointers.

That night, Rebecca had a work event, so I didn't call her. I watched tv, ate some dinner, then went to bed. Lying in bed, I pulled out my phone and loaded some porn. It was an anal video. The girl was petite, and the man was not. He actually looked a little like Mike. Anyway, I started focusing on the girl and stroking. As I came closer to climax though, I found my brain kept thinking about Mike. I pictured myself as the girl, and Mike behind me. I tried to push the thoughts out of my mind, but they came back as I came. I felt a little weird afterward, but went to sleep.

The next day was uneventful at work, and I left a little early to get to the gym. Maybe subconsciously I wanted to avoid mike. Sadly I was wrong, and he was there. He was as friendly as ever, and I found it easy to put the weird thoughts away in my mind. He asked me what my goals were at the gym, and I told him I wanted to build muscle, and lose weight. ""Well, you're going about it the wrong way"", he said. ""You're doing too many targeted weight lifts, all you actually need at your level to build muscle is to do squats, and those will build muscle in the rest of you too"". ""you should also be doing cardio a lot- you're overweight, so this will really improve your health"".

I wasn't sure how much I believed him - after all, I'd done my research and was following a 5x5 plan. However, he seemed so authoritative, and if anyone would know what exercises to do, it would be this behemoth of a man. So I ditched my plan and started following his- 5 sets of 10 reps squats, followed by 45 minutes running or cycling. Mike also helped me with my meal planning and calorie counting - he even would bring me his meal prepped meals. Always low carb, high fiber, lots of vitamins.

Rebecca was very happy that I'd made a friend, she was worried about me by myself. I wasn't worried about her, she was quite the extrovert, unlike me. When we called that weekend, she told me about all the friends she'd already made, mostly through work. She got on especially well with her new boss, James. They were apparently always chatting. I was a little jealous, but she reassured me that I had nothing to worry about. It didn't stop me worrying though.

I kept going to the gym, and I found myself thinking more and more about Mike. I almost found him... hot. Ew. I was a little disgusted, but still couldn't stop myself. I wondered if he liked guys, but i couldn't imagine him being gay. The next time we were at the gym, I subtly asked him if he was dating anyone. He told me that he wasn't, which surprised me. Then he mentioned that it was very hard for him to find his type. This intrigued me, but, sadly, he may as well have been mute when i tried to question him further. That night, as i lay in bed, I started to look mike up on the internet. He was a hard man to track down - he had no facebook, or twitter. However, after enough work, I managed to track down his reddit account. What came next shocked me.",1,1771153508.0,sissiesexstories,0,1.0,False

To fix it up, I soaked it in diluted hot citric acid water for 1-2h and afterwards scrubbed with metal polish and a rough sponge. Cooked once with citric acid water like the Bialetti website says and rinsed thouroughly.

The first coffee tasted a bit weird, not sure if that due to some cleaner residue or just because I am used to the Brikka taste. 😵‍💫

I am a 4th year Veterinary Medicine Student. Honestly, hindi ko alam kung paano ko na-survive yung last 4 years, pero I think I am facing a crisis on myself—I struggle on studying.

First and foremost, I have distraction issues. I always am hooked with playing video games, wathing reels on facebook or instagram, eating, or anything—and I am doing all these just to avoid studying. I can read for 5 minutes then after that I am already on a different software or app on my study medium. Heck I can even stare blankly for a long time just to avoid reading. And this is just the tip of the iceberg of problems of mine.

Second, I always do passive reading/writing—where I read or write something just to not retain it chronically in my head. I easily forget what I read even if I have read it for 3 or 4 times. Parang gumagalaw na lang yung mata ko from left-to-right without even absorbing anything in the reading material. Apart from that, I easily get overwhelmed with how much I need to read instead of ACTUALLY reading it. I see something too long, I avoid, I see something that I can't understand, I move on. It's kind of annoying.

Last and is my biggest problem of all—I AM ALWAYS SLEEPY ESPECIALLY WHEN I TRY TO STUDY. I can last for up to 10 minutes reading then I start to yawn and everything starts to fall apart. I take a nap for 10 minutes, add 5 more, then add another 5 more, and so on and so fourth until I completed an entire night's sleep. I drink coffee but it's useless—it just makes me more sleepy. Reading in this state just makes me not understand anything that I have read.

I need your help on this. I know this is pretty much a ME problem, but I badly need your advice on how I can overcome this. I don't want to fail and extend my stay in this program, and I also don't want to get kicked out of this program just because I failed. If you find this post cliche, cringe, or stupid, please just respectfully say which part I have said is wrong. If there is an existing thread that is the same as my problem, please comment a link.

1r5bvvj,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1r5bvvj/please_reassure_me_ftm_and_moving_away_from/,"Please reassure me, FTM and moving away from husband in 2 weeks","36 FTM (4W+2D I think, surgeon, about to start a new job [first attending job] in a location away from husband but within 40 minutes of parents/extended family.  I’m moving in 2 weeks.  

My husband is still in medical training until June 2028 in a city that is 7 hours away by car or 2.5-3 hours away by total flight time (including to/from airports).  I chose life on extra hard mode.

Some concerns:
1.  I’m currently on day 3 of waking up at night due to bad cramps > relieved after pooping.  This is terrible?  I had an IUD for the past 10 years and didn’t have a period or cramps on it but this feels like period cramps all over again.

2.  I’m scared to be moving away from my husband.  Our timing sucks but we also didn’t want to wait until he’s done with training (I’d be 39).  One good thing is I’m moving to a city with my parents (40 minutes away with traffic) and extended family.  Any advice?  I did share the news of this pregnancy with my mom.  My parents love to cook and give me food when I visit (my husband normally is the cook, I otherwise eat ramen and snack all day).

— being type A, I created a list of snacks I may likely tolerate that’ll give me the calcium, protein I need.  But I’m typically a one-meal-a-day (dinner) with just a coffee and water throughout the day and have been this way for 10 years out of necessity.  Only exception are days off- I enjoy food when I have time for it.  I’d eat all day if I could.

3.  Any physician moms (especially surgeon moms) out there?  I’m nervous about this as my first job.  I sometimes will have long surgeries but I’m more worried about how the optics look - I’m in a male dominated field and I’m just starting this first job and I’m pregnant before I even start.  I feel a little guilty.  I want to prove myself.  I was the resident and fellow who was always available at work, scrubbed into all the cases, worked more than 80 hours a week at times, operated for 36 hours (though I had like 3-4 breaks in between and slept for 2 hours before being called back in) without complaint.  I peed in the morning before scrubbing in at 7:30am, then peed sometime between 4-6pm, whenever we were closing (when it was the non critical part and the interns/junior residents could do it) and I could break away for a pee break, water break, and a small snack.  My pee was usually dark yellow.  

But now I know I have to learn to prioritize myself but compounded by my wanting to “prove myself” as the newbie attending, as the fresh-out-of-training attending, to those senior attendings that I am competent and efficient and safe, I’m trying to figure out how to balance this.

Typing this at 5am because of another night of cramps > relieved after going #2.  Ugh.

1r5bqro,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1r5bqro/i_slept_with_my_best_friends_boyfriend_long/,I slept with my best friend's boyfriend long before they met. Telling her has ruined everything.,"TLDR: I slept with a guy in uni, still friends with him now, his now-gf became my best friend. I told her about our past 8 years ago and she had a mental breakdown. It's ruined her life and I can't stop blaming myself for how ill she has become.



I (27F) met my bf (26M) of 8 years through a mutual friend (26M). Only thing is, that mutual 'friend' was more of a 'friend with benefits' for at the time. We were single, young, and flatmates at uni. There wasn't much more to it. I'd approached my now bf asking for advice at first about whether he felt there was any chance of a relationship with the friend (let's call him D), but over time, we became close friends. Then best friends. And 3 months later, it was apparent that we had started to fall for one another. I'd stopped hooking up with D by this point; it was messing with my head and I was scared to get attached. Eventually, my bf and I confessed that we liked one another and started going steady. The rest is history. I love this man more than anything. He is my rock, my soulmate, my best friend. This is vital context.

We're still friends with D now. I was adopted into their wider friend circle and we're still a solid group. Was it a little weird at first given the 'history'? Yeah, a little. I kept communication open with my bf about his comfort level, but he never lost trust in me. I have been head over heels for him for almost 8 years now.

D got a gf about 3 years ago. Let's call her A (23F). They met at work, and although A was shy at first, she slowly became integrated into the friend group too. My bf and I took a particular shining to her: she's kind, funny and shares a lot of our interests. We both became very close with her over the years, to the point that she started calling both of us 'bestie'. I've always struggled to hold onto friendships in my hometown living so far away now, so A was such a welcome surprise. We've had sleepovers, girly days out, inside jokes with just us and we've always been there for each other at all hours of day when we struggle with our respective mental health issues. It was wonderful to watch A come out of her shell. She told us that she'd never had that many friends before: years of bullying as a kid left her isolated.

Here's the thing, though: D NEVER told her about my history with him. She's unsurprisingly very insecure. I asked D at the start of their relationship if he planned to tell her (just in case she found out some other way), and he said no. This annoyed me, but I figured it wasn't my business. That was before she became my best friend. It BECAME my business. I felt dirty, like I had befriended her under false pretences.

One time in particular, the group was on a holiday and A, my bf and I went to a cocktail bar. We all got drunk and started getting soppy about how much we all appreciated one another. And then A turned the subject to D and his exes. She said: 'I know he has exes, but he doesn't like to talk about them. What were they like?', and I felt my heart sink. 3 years in and she still didn't know. I whispered in my bf's ear, 'Should I tell her?', and he said: 'No, not now.'

When we got home from the holiday, I messaged D again asking him why he never told her and pleading him to do so. I said it felt dirty for something I did as a literal teenager. D still refused to tell her (immature IMO), but said he wouldn't hold it against me if I did.

So I did. One sleepover, it just came out, like I couldn't hold it in anymore. It definitely shouldn't have come from me, but if it wasn't going to come from D I felt that she deserved to know that her boyfriend was hiding that from her. I watched her face contort in hurt and disgust in front of me, but she tried to keep her cool. We went to bed, and in the morning, A politely asked me to leave so she could process her feelings and 'preserve the friendship'. I drove home feeling nauseous, collapsing into tears in my bf's arms when I got home.

He went over to talk to her. He's the closest thing she's got to a 'similar situation', and she didn't want me or D near her. Despite the fact that this was 8 years ago, and the thought of D in \*that\* context gives me the ick now, she couldn't stop imagining us together. All of her jealousies and insecurities bubbled to the surface, and she needed some time to just scream/cry without me or D nearby so she didn't upset us.

After 2 painful days of silence, A messaged me to say that she's still struggling, but thanked me for telling her. She appreciated how painful it must've been to sit on that information. She knew it was years ago and there was nothing to worry about; while she was angry at D for not telling her sooner, she did still want us all in her lives. I was relieved. I spent a while reassuring her that I absolutely DID NOT want D in that way and the only person I have eyes for is my bf. I love and care about her so much; she has been so unconditionally kind to me and hurting her this way was worse than any breakup.

Things went back to relative normality for a few weeks. There were a few moments in group settings where A would seem 'off' and shut down, and I'd know why. It'd be small things, like me addressing him in an Xbox party, where she'd suddenly withdraw and go silent, sometimes leaving without warning. There was one time where D went upstairs to see my hamster during a D&D session with the wider group. I went up to supervise because I didn't want anyone mishandling my pet, but when A came upstairs and saw just me and him in a room, she didn't speak or look at either of us for the rest of the day. There was another incident where I'd made cookies; enough for everyone in the group, and went round to people's houses to drop them off. I'd spent a little while chatting to D's parents at the front door; when I told A this, she suddenly stopped replying to my messages. It was obvious she was still struggling with her insecurities, and I tried to create an open space for communication to let her know that it was okay to feel these things. I said that if she still was struggling with feelings of jealousy, that I didn't blame her and would always be happy to put her mind at rest and reassure her, if that was helpful. I was just grateful still to have this person in my life. Despite these 'funny turns', A continued to show up for me and be a good friend when I was struggling.

A eventually went on sick leave from work for stress. I blamed myself for this. Sure, she had other things going on, but clearly she was having a hard time with what I'd told her. I remember apologising when she went on sick leave, but she said it wasn't my fault and that there were other medical factors at play. With my mental health being in the gutter, I also went on sick leave about 2 weeks after for worsening depression/anxiety. We spent some of our sick days together and things were normal (laughing, joking where we felt able, making tea and coffee for each other and just BEING there with no pressure).

Then it happened. One day, I messaged A to ask how she was doing that morning, and I got a short reply: 'I'm really sorry but I don't want to talk to you rn'. My heart sank. I should've just left it there. But my dumb ass pressed for why. She proceeded to say that when she'd reassured me it wasn't my fault she was on sick leave, she'd lied. It was the info I'd told her that had caused her mental decline; that even though she knew there was nothing to worry about, her brain was torturing her with comparison to me. She told me to leave her alone for a little while and let her process. Me being pretty unstable myself at the time, thanked her for her honesty and respected her wishes. I had the biggest breakdown I've had in years. Screaming, crying, howling that I'd wrecked my relationship with my best friend. Things were fine before I told her. Why couldn't I just be content with that? Why did I have to get the truth off MY chest to make ME feel better? Why why why?

In a fit of rage, I punched the floor and heard something click in my hand. It started to swell. The pain didn't subside after half an hour. Ah, shit. I went to hospital and found out that I'd broken my hand. Greeeeat. My bf was at work so didn't know until he'd finished work. When he opened his phone, he had frantic texts from A pleading for him to check on me, because she was scared that she'd lashed out in a moment of insecurity and really upset me. And of course, texts from me saying I needed picking up from the hospital. I was mad; at myself, but also at A. Blaming me for all of her problems did feel unfair, especially when she KNEW that was something I'd been doing and apologising for anyway. This wasn't the 'open and honest communication' I'd fostered; this was just using me as a punching bag it felt. I was mad at D for his negligence. If he'd told her in the beginning, this could ALL have been avoided. 

A found out that I'd broken my hand and she had a complete breakdown. I tried to reassure her that I didn't blame her for my impulsive decisions, but that the way she spoke to me was upsetting. That I felt as though D had got off scot free while I was the focal point of all of her jealousy. A sent me absolute paragraphs apologising, saying that if my bf and I wanted to cut her off, she would completely understand. But I didn't want that. I wanted my friend back. I wanted old times back. I wanted her to get better; to go to therapy and to work through whatever feelings were bubbling away making her feel like this. What followed was 10 days of no contact from her. I reached out every single day, even asking D if he could pass on messages. But she felt too ashamed to even speak to me or my bf. It was heartbreaking. My hand was my fault; not hers. This whole situation had become completely out of proportion and I just wanted to make it right. Clearly A and I were both ill and needed help. 

A did eventually come back, but she routinely still has periods of silence where she gets so anxious that she ghosts everyone except D. They'll be sat together in an invite-only party on Xbox, which leaves the wider group confused. Only my bf and I know the full extent. She's still not gone back to work months later, while my hand healed up and I went back after just 5 weeks. It's all so confusing. One minute, things will be normal. We'll all be laughing, swapping jokes, messaging each other and being there through tough moments and the next...crickets. The doctors have put her on a carousel of medications and none of them have helped. She's still getting worse and worse, eating less and less, becoming more and more withdrawn. I'm so worried for her health. But even with her health declining, she would still go out of her way to be there for us. 

Recently after a period of silence, A came onto Xbox and was VERY giddy. Uncharacteristically so. She was slurring her words, telling us all how much she loved us. My bf and I knew something was wrong. We rushed to her house to find her lying in a pool of vomit, alcohol bottles all around her. D contacted her parents, who came round to take her to theirs. They were just as worried as we were. While A started sobering up, crying about what a terrible friend she had been, while my bf and I reassured her that we weren't going anywhere. That we were her friends and we loved her. Her parents thanked us for rushing over and took her home with them. This was 3 weeks ago. I haven't heard from her since. We've tried calling, texting, dropping off treats at her house, but still she only talks to D and nobody else.

I miss my best friend. I miss the lives we all had before this. I don't even know what to do anymore. I wish I could turn back the clock to September, to the moment I blurted the truth, and tell myself to shut up. She was such an integral piece of my support system, and not knowing where we all stand with her now, I feel like I'm mourning a friendship that's still there. Apologies for the length of this post. I just don't know what to do. ",2,1771152589.0,offmychest,4,1.0,False
1r5bpb9,https://i.redd.it/nx1d33pe1njg1.png,"Is your LinkedIn profile a liability? The ROI of ""Visual Trust"" in 2026.","You’re running ads, sending outbound DMs, or grinding on content. A lead clicks your profile. In exactly **0.05 seconds**, they form an opinion of your competence based entirely on your visuals.

If your profile looks like a generic corporate template, you aren't just losing a ""follow""you are losing **revenue**.

I’ve been analyzing the workflow of **Zubia Hassan** (the mind behind the ""Elite Banner"" movement), and her approach reveals why most entrepreneurs are failing at social selling. It’s not about art; it’s about **conversion architecture.**

**1. The ""Visual Authority"" Gap**  
Zubia’s thesis is simple: If your service costs $5k but your profile looks like it costs $5, you have a ""Trust Gap."" She bridges this by using high-contrast, premium design elements that trigger an immediate ""Expert"" association in the brain.

**2. Architecture Over Aesthetics**  
Most people hire a graphic designer. Zubia acts as a **Conversion Consultant**. Her framework for a high-performing profile includes:

* **The Hero Statement:** Not buried in a bio, but front-and-center in the banner.
* **Cognitive Ease:** Using clean typography and specific color palettes that guide the eye to the ""Follow"" or ""Book a Call"" button.
* **The ""Hype"" Factor:** Leveraging visual social proof so you don't have to brag in your postsyour profile does it for you.

**3. The ""No-Call"" Business Model**  
What’s fascinating about Zubia’s own brand is how she’s productized her service. She famously avoids the ""let's jump on a quick discovery call"" trap. By using a deep-dive onboarding questionnaire, she:

* Reduces friction for the client.
* Ensures the design is driven by data/strategy, not ""vibes.""
* Proves that a strong personal brand allows you to dictate how you work.

**4. The Results of ""Visual First"" Growth**  
Since scaling her own brand under the **BajiContentCreator** handle, she’s become a case study for ""Total Profile Dominance."" She’s moved from a software engineering background into becoming the go-to designer for the top 1% of LinkedIn creators proving that **niche-specific design** is a massive blue ocean.

Design is the ""silent salesman."" You can be the smartest person in your field, but if your LinkedIn looks like an abandoned resume, nobody will stay long enough to find out.  
Have you ever audited your profile through the lens of a $10,000 lead? If you saw your own banner today, would *you* hire yourself?

1r5blfe,https://i.redd.it/m9qrwzq80njg1.png,Why Your LinkedIn Content Isn’t Converting: The “Visual Authority” Lesson from Zubia Hassan,"Most creators on LinkedIn have a ""conversion surface"" problem, not a content problem. You can post high-quality advice every day, but if a prospect clicks your profile and sees a generic banner or a CV from 2017, they won't buy.

I’ve been studying the strategy of **Zubia Hassan** (known online as [u/bajicontentcreator](https://pk.linkedin.com/in/bajicontentcreator)), and she has essentially cracked the code on **Visual Authority**. In just 9 months, she went from zero to 5,000+ followers and closed high-ticket deals (one for £2,525!) without a massive audience.

Here is the breakdown of her ""Elite Branding"" system that you can steal for your own profile:

**1. The ""Digital Billboard"" (Banner Design)**  
Zubia argues that your banner is your most valuable real estate. It shouldn't just be a ""pretty picture."" It needs to clarify your offer in **3 seconds**.

* **The Hack:** Position your primary offer and a clear call-to-action (CTA) right in the banner so people know exactly what you solve before they even read your headline.

**2. Visual Trust Signals**  
It's about ""Signal Over Style."" Zubia’s approach focuses on making you look like the ""Top 1%"" in your niche. This includes:

* **Custom Service Cards:** Using the LinkedIn Services section to visually ""sell"" for you.
* **Featured Section Mastery:** Moving away from ""link dumping"" and using branded thumbnails that act as mini-case studies.

**3. The 6-Step L-In Authority System**  
Zubia uses a specific framework to scale personal brands:

1. **Audit:** Identify the visual leaks holding your brand back.
2. **Positioning:** Clarify who you solve problems for.
3. **Visual Identity:** Build a premium, recognizable look.
4. **Content System:** Create templates so you don't stare at a blank screen.
5. **Authority Visuals:** Ensure every post reinforces your expert status.
6. **Optimization:** Set up the profile to capture inbound leads.

**4. Why ""Followers Don't Matter""**  
One of Zubia's most polarizing (but true) takes is that you don't need 100,000 followers to make sales. You need:

* A high-value skill.
* An optimized profile that does the selling for you.
* Deep conversations over ""more"" conversations.

  
If you're spending 2 hours writing a post but 0 minutes fixing your profile, you're leaking leads. Zubia Hassan’s growth proves that **Clarity + Consistency + High-End Visuals** is the fastest path to monetization in 2026.

1r5bkxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/businesstrendz/comments/1r5bkxy/top_business_events_for_professionals/,Top Business Events For Professionals,"In today's fast-paced business environment, attending industry events and conferences has become more than just a nice-to-have—it's an essential investment in professional growth and business success. While it may seem tempting to skip these gatherings in favor of daily operational tasks or to rely solely on digital communication, the tangible benefits of in-person attendance far outweigh the time and financial costs involved.

Networking: Building Relationships That Matter

The networking opportunities at industry events are unparalleled. Unlike online interactions, face-to-face meetings allow professionals to forge genuine connections that can lead to partnerships, collaborations, and new business opportunities. These events gather decision-makers, thought leaders, and peers from across the industry in one location, creating a concentrated environment for meaningful exchanges. A casual conversation over coffee or during a breakout session can evolve into a strategic partnership or provide the solution to a challenge your organization has been facing. Moreover, reconnecting with existing contacts strengthens professional relationships and keeps you top-of-mind when opportunities arise. The informal settings of networking receptions and dinners also allow for more authentic conversations that go beyond what's possible through email or LinkedIn messages.

Learning from Industry Experts and Guest Speakers

Conferences feature carefully curated speaker lineups that include industry pioneers, successful entrepreneurs, and subject matter experts who share their insights, experiences, and proven strategies. These presentations offer concentrated learning opportunities that would take months to acquire through independent research. Guest speakers often reveal case studies, share lessons from failures and successes, and provide actionable takeaways that can be immediately implemented. The Q&A sessions following presentations allow attendees to seek clarification and gain deeper understanding of complex topics. Additionally, panel discussions bring together diverse perspectives, helping professionals understand multiple approaches to common challenges and emerging opportunities within their field.

Staying Ahead of Industry Trends

The business landscape evolves rapidly, and conferences serve as early indicators of where industries are heading. Attending these events keeps professionals informed about emerging technologies, regulatory changes, market shifts, and evolving customer expectations before they become mainstream knowledge. Exhibitor halls showcase the latest products, services, and innovations, giving attendees a firsthand look at tools that could transform their operations. Workshop sessions often focus on future-oriented topics, preparing attendees to adapt their strategies proactively rather than reactively. This forward-looking intelligence provides a competitive advantage, enabling professionals to position their organizations ahead of the curve and make informed decisions about resource allocation and strategic direction.

Industry events and conferences represent a powerful trifecta of networking, learning, and trend-spotting that no ambitious business professional can afford to miss. The investment pays dividends long after the event concludes.

hey everyone, figured i would share some parking tips for dystopian oasis: vaporwave night at thunderbird lounge on 02/15. since it starts at 9:00 pm, the melrose area is going to be pretty lively even for a sunday night, so parking can be a bit of a headache if you do not have a plan.  
  
first off, you should check out Prked. it is an app where you can rent driveways or garage spots from people living right next to thunderbird lounge. it is honestly way cheaper than most other spots and you get to skip the standard parking lot traffic. it is usually just a really short walk to the venue and you do not have to worry about getting towed or stuck in a crowded lot.  
  
thunderbird lounge has its own parking lot right in the wagons ho complex, but honestly that thing is tiny and usually fills up by 8:00 pm or earlier. if you try to pull in there after 9:00 pm, you might just get stuck in a loop of cars trying to turn around. if that lot is full, people usually head to the street parking along montecito avenue or 7th avenue. just be really careful with the residential signs because some of the side streets have strict permit rules and phoenix parking enforcement does not play around.  
  
another thing to keep in mind is the lot across the street near the copper star coffee, but they are pretty protective of their spaces during business hours, though by 9:00 pm it might be more relaxed. always check the posted signs though. there is also some parking further south near the light rail station at campbell and central if you do not mind a ten to fifteen minute walk. the light rail is actually a decent backup if you live along the line because the station is not too far. traffic on 7th ave can be weird with the suicide lanes, so just pay attention to the overhead signals if you are driving in from another part of phoenix.  
  
if you are determined to get a spot in the main lot, you should probably aim to get there at least 30-45 minutes before the music starts. otherwise, just scout the street spots on the north side of montecito first. avoid parking in front of any driveways or blocking hydrants because the neighbors in melrose will definitely call it in.  
  
hope this helps everyone have a good time at the show.",1,1771151970.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

I (f32) have 2 younger siblings and one cousin who came here from Vietnam a few years ago (we live in an European country). I have been working for 7 years by now and have a very good job with high income. My siblings (f29, m22) are still in university. My cousin is already working, she's doing good even tho she makes less than me. Everytime we go out together, I would always pay the bill for everyone and I always make sure to get nice birthday gifts (usually about 200 euros). One time my sister didn't feel very well, so I just booked her an appointment at a massage place to make her day better. My cousin always crashes at my place because the City where I live is very popular and there's so much to do and to explorer here. She lives 2 hours from me. 

Everytime she comes and visits me, I would cook something, order food or go out to eat. I always pay and she never offered to buy me anything. That never bothered me until a few weeks ago. She came to visit me again, we went out to eat, I paid and the next day the trains back to her town were so late that it was impossible for her to get home before midnight. My boyfriend and I offered to drive her home. It was 4 hours back and forth. We stopped at a Gas station and we ordered 3 coffee, which I assumed she would pay for us because we driving her home. But she didn't. I paid for our coffee and for hers too because she didn't even take her purse out. After we dropped her off, she thanked us but didnt even offer us any money for Gas either. I would have refused anyway but this was just weird. Especially because all the times she visited me before, I always made food for her or paid for dinner. And then there's my mom who is constantly asking me for money because my dad gambled and he lost 20k recently. I refused because I dont give any money to someone who is addicted and if my mom still stays with my dad then there's just no exception.

Plus, my siblings are travelling in Southeast asia right now and my mom asked me to send them 1000 euro because she's worried that they don't have enough money to travel and buy food. I was like err noo why do I have to pay for their vacation?? And then my mom accused me of being cheap. I talked to my brother about it and he told me, that my mom sent them 500 euro after I refused. Wtf. Why did she expect me to send 1000 euro when she herself isn't even giving so much. And he also told me that my mom talked bad about me because i didnt want to give any money. I gave my grandparents and other cousins a couple thousands already in the past when none of my siblings have ever given any money before but I'm the cheap one here?! 

I just dont know what to do and why my mom is doing this to me. Last year i gave her a new Michael kors bag for her Birthday and my dad a new watch. I dont understand why she would say that about me or ist expecting me to give more...",5,1771151864.0,raisedbynarcissists,3,1.0,False

1r5bhkf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r5bhkf,Coffee Petite Gateau by the Art Lab,"Ordered the Coffee Petit Gateau by the art lab, they have these visually creative desserts. It’s described as tiramisu mascarpone mousse, coffee bean praline, vanilla sponge and chocolate ganache.

Visually, it’s very cute and shaped like a little coffee sack with chocolate “beans” on top, some of which actually fall part when you touch it. The sac is fondant. 

Taste wise, it’s… okay. It does lean tiramisu, but it’s not quite tiramisu. The coffee flavour is mild and gets overshadowed by the sweetness. The ganache and praline make it quite rich, and overall it’s much sweeter than I expected. After a slice/couple of bites it starts feeling heavy. There’s also a weird layer of what I’m presuming to be crushed praline which is texturally interesting, like almost sand grains.

Portion size is generous, but because of the sweetness this is not something two people can comfortably finish unless you really love sugary desserts. Realistically, this needs three to four people with a solid sweet tooth. If you are someone who does not eat much sugar, one bite might honestly be enough.

Overall: good presentation, decent flavour, but too sweet for my preference. I would not reorder, but I would not call it bad either for ₹899. 3.5/5",5,1771151659.0,mumbaiFood,1,1.0,False
