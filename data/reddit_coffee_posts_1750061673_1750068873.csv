I am sorry, this is gonna be a long one. Very long one. First context: I am female (25), study and work very hard. When I was 18, my mom put me on a one way flight to Canada to escape the tyranny of my country and I never looked back.  

My life journey had been quite struggling so far, with more downs than ups but I am doing the best I can with the tools I have. 

My immigration journey, which will show up as important later, had been difficult. I graduated from the Bachelor of Science in Canada, my English is at CLB 10, and I am preparing for French exam. The main difficulties started when I had to withdraw from graduate school to support my family in this horrible times that are happening within my country of birth. Unfortunately, it is especial hard on me and my family because our country is the offensive side. But, oh well, that's a story for another time. 

The point is, I have been living with a ticking time bomb over my head for the last 8 months and I am constantly stressed out with no time to sleep or prepare a decent meal. Because of all the stress I have been also struggling with my  weight. 

Additional detail: I grow up very lonely and have always had extremely low self-esteem and constantly feel worthless. My father died when I was 5. My mom was constantly working hard and barely ever at home. And my grandmother was a source of genetational trauma for weamen in my family. She was the youngest of 5 sisters born in 1945. My grandfather was a ray of sun in this mismatched jigsaww puzzle of a family and we lost him too tragically 2 years ago. As a kid, I was always told I am too much and physically punished for crying or showing emotions. This circumstance had previously been the reason of me entering and staying in an unhealthy relationship. My first ever boyfriend, who I met in university was a narcissist and physically as well as verbally abused me. This to me came with certain level of shame since I am also a certified self-defense instructor and did martial arts for years. I had always thought and hoped that I would not let anybody treat me in such a way.

Please don't be too harsh on me disclaimer: I understand that the paragraph above describes me as responsible for letting people treat me poorly. I acknowledge that the relationship I am about to describe was a mistake on my part to enter and even worse of a mistake to stay in but I loved the person very much and genuinely thought they would change after their ""circumstances"" get better. But the ""circumstsnces"" only ever got worse.

Now the story: I, female (25), have met my now ex boyfriend (male, 32) at a Halloween event almost 3 years ago. Let's call my ex - Jared, for the sake of this story. He was very charming and kind, and even though I wasn't looking for anything, it felt safe to hang out with him, and he was genuinely nice to me. Jared told me early on that he has a little kid (shared custody) from previous relationship, and that that ended with a huge mess that he is now dealing with. From now on we will call this mess and all the matter surrounding the communication between Jared, his kid and the kid's mom - "" the circumstances"". 

Jared was very upfront that he is not ready for commitment. It didn't bother me that much, I wasn't looking for anything serious and I was constantly busy doing my own things. Nonetheless, I liked Jared and I was happy to hangout.  

The relationship dynamic, however, felt quite uneven. As stated, Jared would never give me commitment or prioritize me over his work or friends   BUT  he would be very sensitive to my shifts in small behaviours. I was very caring and occasionally cooked meals and helped clean his house because I though he has it rough and I was trying to help. And the moment I was not giving my full commitment to him, he would accuse me of seeing somebody else. This deeply hurt me because Jared was my second intimate partner at all, and I am natyrally very shy, one-person loving and loyal. But I shrugged it off because I was scared to be lonely again after finding someone I genuinely liked. With this dynamic, I quickly grew attached to him. The fact that he has avoidant attachment style and I have anxious only made our dynamic worse. But again, I wasn't planning on being serious, so I never addressed that. 

Fast forward to 4 months into relationship, I am on a solo trip to a small town and Jared is love bombing me over texts questioning why I didn't invite him. That week was also his turn to be with the kid. 

I was spending a day at a horse stables and invited Jared and his kid (not disclosing age or gender) to come hang out with some horses. So, they did. They came dressed up for the city rather than for a farm with horses though, so I ended up asking the kid if I could lift them up on my arms to pet the horses. The kid was hesitant at first, I didn't push, but then they agreed. From the moment the little kid's hand touched a horse, it was a connection at first sight. By the time the day ended, the kid wanted me to go home with them. I ended up staying to read the bedtime story.  Neither me nor Jared expected the kid to make connection with me. Me and Jared were not anything solid or certain and had only introduced me as friend. 

From that day onward, we started hanging out more, all three of us. I and Jared's kid grew very close and attached to each other. We read books on dinosaurs, played on the playground and just talked.

I genuinely believe that the reason we grew so attached was that I have always tried to listen to the kid. I felt like they were going through a rough time dealing with their parent's separating and not talking to each other. Jared had never been in touch with emotions, not his own, not others. So, I was probably the only one talking to the kid and paid actual attention to their emotional needs. 

As I was falling in love with Jared and the feeling of having a family as all three of us were hanging out, the dynamic became even more uneven. We were not anything official, no display of ""togetherness"" on social media. I was the one planning and initiating most of the trips and dates, and I was the one paying. I never asked Jared to pay for his half of the trip because his ""circumstances"" were difficult and beared a financial weight too. 

A few times I tried to bring up how I feel, and it got brushed off. Jared would constantly get mad at me for pointing out his lack of initiative or getting emotional over not understanding where we are.

In 2.5 years of our relationship I never met his family. Jared would say that he loves me, and sees our future together but the ""circucmstances"" were always on the way. And if I ever cried because I felt neglecyed in the relationship, he would hold it against me that he was upfront about not wanting a commintment. 

Nonetheless, he never broke up with me. I did. 6 times, and then all 6 times got back with him after actually being persuaded by him that I am at fault. It would always go by the same scenario. I would build up things I can't complain to him about because we are not in a commited relationship to the point I can't hold it any longer and break down. I would call Jared, Jared would loudly sigh into the phone, get mad on me for crying, say ""I don't want tk deal with drama right now"", then dissappear for days with no warning. During dissappearance I would break up with him over a text. After his ressurection from ignoring me he would say I am fault for breaking up. I missed him and I returned hoping it would change.

It happened 6 times that we broke up but I always kept in touch with the kid. I have communicated multiple times to Jared, who at certain point started accusing me of not opening up to him enough, that it hurts me that whenever I express my feelings he discards and ghosts me. In some instances he promised to do better but he never did, and I was stuck in a cycle of building up resentment and frustraction, breaking down, getting hurt by Jared for breaking down and resenting him even more for that.

During our relationship with Jared I tried to be as supportive as possible. And was always on Jared's side even though I never got involved into his ""circumstances"". I was just trying to be there for him and his kid. I always told the kid, that mom and dad love him, and tried to smooth the angles, even though I didn't know their mom.

We always lived separately, so I often drove to Jared's place to help, stay with kid if needed, make meals, bring groceries. I loved them both so much. And if either of them ever needed anything, I wpuld just go and buy it without being asked.

It was never reciprocated though. I still had no idea what we are after 2 years of playing a happy family together. Jared never showed up to my martial arts training, even though it was important that he sees it at least once what I do. He didn't remember things I like, movies I watch, food I enjoy, and places I go. He never was a safe space for me to be myself and be emotional. I never was a priority. Since his family didn't know about me he would not pick up my calls when he was with them even when it was an emergency. I ended up having to hide my health emergencies  and financial struggles from him because I knew he didn't want to "" deal with my drama"" and instead of showing up to support me he would get mad and go into his avoidant spiral of ignoring me. But I loved him, I loved him deeply even when it was the hardest thing to do and even when it meant I had to love myself less, so that he gets enough of my love.

During his avoidant spiral, I would stop existing for Jared completely. There was one time my mother had a heart attack and I called him hoping for support. Instead as he always did je sighed into the phone and as always just went to bed knowing I am crying, sobbing and screaming in my apartment alone. So, I was hiding a lot of emotions away and of course it every songle time ended up with me having a loud emotional break down.

In December last year me and Jared broke up again, 6th time, a week later I got into a car accident hitting a huge piece of cement barrier that ended up in the middle of the lane on a highway at night. I had 4 passengers (me and my friends went to see Oppenheimer anniversairy screening in IMAX, never being a nerd caused me so much trouble). Luckily all my passengers were ok, I managed to keep the car stable and not go off the curb. It was my first car and it was totalled. My friends got picked up why I wad dealing with the tow truck and I was stranded alone in a hoodie at night in the middle of nowhere, with barely any network and with heavily pouring rain. It was extremely cinematic. I felt like a main character of an A24 studio tragedy. That night I caught an uber that was driving by and they were nice enough to drop me to Jared's place. I needed him. I missed him and I was heart-broken and hurt. He was quite cold, he sucks at being supportive but I was grateful he offered me warm dry  clothes, a cup of warm tea, and a company. After the accident and few more of my emotional break down trying to get through to him that he is hurting me with his behaviour, we got back together. It seemed like genuinely is trying to understand that his lack of action and emotional neglect are bad and hurt me. Or so I thought.

In January Jared was away from the country to deal with few things and we often talked on the phone. I loved him and believed he is trying to be a better partner and is willing to support me when I get stressed and need him. Spoiler: I was wrong. While he was away, I was moving into a new apartment. All by myself. I habe absolutely incredible friends, it is a small group of people I would give up my life for but life spread us around the world like knife spreads butter on toast, so nobody was in town to help me. I had no days off of work and moved tjing on my own after work in my new car I loaned with insurance settlement. I did everything from cleaning to carrying heavy things and assembling furniture myself. In combination with full time work, part-time evening classes, french classes and the whole immigration thing, and on top of that making sure I and my cat have clean house to sleep in and food prepared, it was a lot. I was crying almost every single day. Jared was very supportive on the phone and would say he could help me out with few things.

When Jared returned I met him at the airport with flowers and coffee. Soon the excitement of his return switched to trying to survive with the heavy routine. Even the small things I asked his help with were forgotten or he never had time for them.

In April, my weekdays got so busy, I had barely time to sleep. My wednesdays were my busiest with work in morning, school in the evening, then french. Jared had second set of keys to my apartment. On one particular wednesday in April,  my mom was not waking up from a minor surgery. She lives back in my birth country part time and trying to get PR in another close by country. She is a cancer patient,  and as I had said before, in December she had a heart attack. I was devastated and scared. I still had to go to class. I called Jared to ask him if he could possible come feed my cat and help me make a meal because I was excrutiatingly hungry and even more excrutiatingly busy. He didn't pick up because he was with his family. He called later that night, but I didn't say anything for him not to get nad at me again. That day still echoes in my heart as a day when my partner Jared, the person who I loved couldn't even make me/buy me/ bring me a meal on my worst f*cking day in a while. Luckily my mom is ok now.

In May, worse things awaited, resentment was building up in me. I was struggling with weight and body dysmorphia. Constantly doubting every life decision I ever made. I was under a lot of stress, yet, we still played a happy family whenever the kid was around. A part of me thinks that I would have walked out of this relationship earlier if not for the kid but I don't know. All I know is I loved them both despite how unloved and lonely I felt while being with Jared.

One day I was stressed and I videocalled Jared after work hoping for verbal support and some validation of my feelings. Instead, I got ""some people have it worse"" and ""don't be so negative all the time"" sort of arguments. It was his usual ""supporting"" speech even though I said before that's the worst way to support me. I just got queit instead of arguingbover it again. Teads started falling down my cheeks. And he got mad, he got mad at me for not feeling better from his ""support"" and threatened to hang up the phone on me crying if I don't stop. After I carefully said that his way of suppirt is not something I apprecuate to hear when I am sad he said that I cannot police what and how he says and he doesn't have to change it in any way. That broke my heart once more as I thought we wrre on the right track to make thing work. Again, after the call ended, he went to bed, and I went to cry myself to sleep. 

Next few days, I was still processing what he said, remembering all the time he never showed up to support me despute leaving a 10 minute drive away and having keys to my apartment. I was blaming myself for not seeing the red flags early on. I was in pain. He on the other hand behaved as normal, as if nothing happened. As if him saying that didn't matter at all in the big picture of our relationship.

Few days later, me and Jared were going out, I still was feeling odd and rough. That day was particulary hard for my body image as well. I ended up trying 3 pairs of jeans before finding the ones I feel ok in. Jared was watching me change and I heard him say something horrible to me. ""Why does it matter for you to feel pretty? are you trying to attract someone? you already have a man"". That phrase kicked the chair under my feet truly, he never was like that. I felt dirty and dusgusting, almost violated for even wanting to feel beautiful. I was quiet and cold the whole night. As always, whenever I got cold and took a step back, Jared would get even colder and take 2 steps back. So we inevitably were distancing more and more.

Then came a big emotional breakdown, I was alone and nacked sitting in my bathtub. I was crying, I was lonely, I was unloved by the very person I wanted to love the most. And I wanted to not call, I wanted to hide it again, but I couldn't. I called. He picked up. On the other line of the phone he sighed loudly as I cried. Sighed as if I am bothering him, as if I am a burden, that I always fear to be for my friends and family. I confronted him. Asked him whether if ""circumstances"" will ever change, will he ever at all show up for me out of his own will. He said he is too traumatized to do so. He asked if I want him to come over. I said no. I said no because I wanted him to want to come over because he wants to support me and not because I told him to come.

Truth is I wanted him to come over out of his own will. I wanted him to come over and hold me while I cry so bad that I ended up staying awake all night hoping to hear the key turn in my lock and feeling his embrace spreading over my back. I wanted him to come and say that everything will be ok, that he loves me. But he never came. He was sleeping soundly at the comfort of his own home. While I was turning inside out in pain with my guts on fire. That night I send him a message saying:"" I think we will never be happy together"". He put an emoji reaction on it, that was that.

Couple days after, he was behaving as if nothing happened. I later found out from him, he thought I was being ""hormonal or something"". IAfter a day together with Jared and his kid. I send him a long message. I said that I am giving trting to fix our relationship, that I am tired being the only one trying. And that if he want this relationship at all, it is his devision. If he decides to talk and work it through, i will. If he decided to end it, then so be it. After he read the message he once again ghosted me, ignoring my calls. (I called to return kids clothes they forgot in my laundry dryer, I ended walking all the way and leaving the clothes at the building reception).

So, that was my answer. He then blamed me for breaking up with him via this message. He blamed me for feeling hurt. ""Why are you hurt if you are the one who broke up with me?"" - he said. I didn't have energy to argue with him. 

For a month and a half we were broken up, we didn't hang out or talk but I stayed in touch with the kid through him. And more or less I guess we were civil even though Jared still had no idea, why I accusse him of emotional neglect.

Now, before, I come the final part the story, I will add the following note. My immigration. As stated previously had been very stressfull recently. I lived in the country for 8 years and still don't have enough points. I had been working hard towards it though. With canadian education, English CLB 10, and actively preparing for French. I have studied French in school, so I am certain I will get a fair score. I have always relied only on myself and neither before nor after meeting Jared considered to be sponsored. Important to note that Jared sponsored his ex, kid's mom. I was very clear always that I do not expect Jared to get involved into my immigration. Infact I didn't like talking to him about it at all because he always was dismissive of my efforts. He always pushed me to hire an immigration consultant. That was always weird to me because a) I do have an immigration consultant, I just don't have enough money for them to lead my case and I had been doing well so far in filling my own documents; b) it's not like having an immigration consultant or lawyer magically adds points to your profile. I do not see the logic there. Jared was always the one to hire specialists for the job. I on the other hand learnt to file my taxes myself, deal with immigration myself, mount things on the walls myself. I do have specialist in mind to ask questions but I do the majority of the work myself. We clashed a lot with Jared on this.

Final Chapter: We will temporaeily jump in time to before our breakup. It is a weekday night. Jared is over at my h
place, we are lying in bed and I am crying because I am overwhelmed and overworked. I have never asked or wanted Jared's help with immigration and never even considered it. But in attempts to support me, Jared says"" I feel so bad for how much pain you feel, I even asked my lawyer if I can sponsor you, but they said I can't"". I was touched by the gesture but again I said:"" it's ok I understand, I know your ""circumstances"" are hard, I didn't expect your help anyways. The scene ends.

Monday night, month and a half after a break up. I get off of a zoom appointment with immigration consultant. During the appointment we briefly looked over all options that exist. They mention sponsorship, and out of curiosity I ask how it works. I never asked or googled before about sponsorship because I never considered it as option but since Jared said it is hard, I just always assumed it is hard. Consultant ended up saying that it actually isn't that hard. And Jared checks out all the checkmarks of conditions. His ex received PR more than 3 years ago. Jared doesn't even need a certain level of income since I have a full-time job and a work permit. My heart dropped yet again. Not because Jared didn't sponsor me but because in that moment of my vulnerability, for no reason at all, he lied. About something so serious for me. I went into a big spiral with panic attack and all else. All the pain and loneliness I felt in the relationship suddenly came back to me all at once. I call Jared. He didn't pick up. I sent him a message saying that he is a liar and I hate him and turned off my phone. That night he was trying to buzz into my apartment and called me but it was too late. I didn't want to see him. 

Next morning I texted him explaining why I am very mad at him for lying and said that I am very hurt and cannot communicate with his kid anymore through him from now on. I said that I will drop off the gifts for his kid's birthday next week ( I already had bought at wrapped them) and that would be it. I don't want to know him after that. Jared brushed it off claiming my accusations are false and there is no reason for me to be mad. I didn't respond. 

Next week I came to drop off gifts, I left them at the reception, sent Jared a photo of their location and went outside (fair distance from the building). I was standing outside and watching, so that nobody else else takes the gifts. When I saw Jared approaching the packages to pick them up, I started going back to my car. Instead of grabbing the gifts and going home, Jared went past them to the building entrance, then outside, and started walking towards me. My hands started shaking, I approached my car, got in as fast as possible, and drove away. I had to pull over almost immediately because I got a severe panic attack. Few minutes later I get a super polite message from Jared thanking me for the gifts, saying how he appreciates that I am always there for his kid and inviting me to the kid's birthday party in few weeks. (I have never attended kid's birthday party while dating Jared since his family and friends don't know about me). It was one of those polite messages that are targetted to make you out to be the crazy one. It was so put of place and tone deaf, like nothing bad ever happened between us. I was confused, frustrated, and mad. But I responded semi formally and as polite as I could, reinstating what I had said before: I do not want to keep in touch with the kid through Jared anymore even if it means I will not be in kid's life at all. Now, I love the kid deeply, and I care about them a lot, I understand that the kid is not at fault for whatever is going on between me and Jared. But. I just couldn't anymore. After I found out he lied about something so serious, I couldn't stand to sacrifice my mental health anymore. I have also said in my texts that I believe it would be beneficial if Jared talk to his kid about the fact that I will not keep in touch anymore to help them process my absence. I have mentioned that I don't mind being in touch with his kid via kid's mom or school if he shates my phone number with them. Jared said it's a bad idea. I didn't defend it.

Fast forward one week. It is Jared's week with the kid. And Jared is blocked, everywhere. On Friday night, my heart ached and I temporarily unblocked Jared on one of the messengers just in case of emergency with the kid or if the conversation will be difficult and the kid wants to call me. I did not text or reach out but I unblocked him. I now regret that decision. A lot. That night I got multiple calls and messages claiming that kid is panicking and it is so sudden for him that I did not call. Jared accused me of pretty much suddebly abandoning the kid even though just a week ago I texted that I don't want to keep in touch, giving him time to prepare a plan to handle it. I called back and briefly talked with the kid, who did not sound distressed or panicked at all. They were driving somewhere, so it was very brief and not serious. I then texted Jared again asking to please talk to the kid about me not being present in their life and not call me unless it is absolutely necessary. Jared got mad and blew up on me, saying that he doesn't understand what I am accusing him of.

Here is where I think I was a big a***hole. I blew up back, heavily insulting Jared, calling him irresponsible and delusional, a liar and asked to leave me alone.  I have also wished him to suffer the consequences of his own actions since I believe he caused his own"" circumstances"" and in 2.5 years never put enough effort to fix things. 

In response to me calling him a liar he said:"" i don't get it why it's hitting you so hard now, was it ever about us? or you just wanted the sponsorship? you are only mad because you didn't get what you wanted from me"". 

That was the final straw. The person I cared about so much and I sacrificed for to support him, the person who used me pretty much was accusing me of trying to use him. I didn't try to waste my energy on explaining that he is wrong.  I just got even more hurt. I told him to go f**k himself and blocked him again. 

I feel now as if I didn't know what kind of a person I was dating. And I don't understand why he doesn't realize gow much he emotionally neglected me and hurt me over the years. But a part of me feels guilt and shame l. I feel responsible for the kid and I don't know whether abandoning them was fair. I now don't know what to do. 

So, people of reddit, AITA for insulting my ex and refusing to keep in touch with his kid?

This isn't how I thought things would end up. Eunice spent 11 years and 2 months with me. The only time we were ever apart was for 5 days when she had her radioiodine treatment to cure her hyperthyroidism. 

  
Two years ago was the last night we ever spent together. She laid next to me and I could tell something was wrong. I fell asleep petting her and then woke up a couple hours later for work. She laid on the edge of my bed, as always, waiting for her hot breakfast. I meal prepped her food to make it easier to give her her kidney medications and I'd heat it up for her while I made my coffee every morning. It was a routine for years. Since she seemed a little off that morning, I also gave her some plain whipped cream cheese that she loved and mixed a Cerenia into it. 



I always tried to give her everything and treat every day as if it could be her last. That's why every day, multiple times a day, even after she went deaf, I always told her how much I love her, how proud I am of her, and how pretty she is. I always wanted those to be the last words she heard from me in case anything did happen. It worked out, in a way, because two years ago, I didn't expect to lose her. As I stood there in the vet's office with her laying in her carrier, thinking she was going to go home to her heating pad and cream cheese breakfast, I couldn't say anything to her. I couldn't touch her. All I could do was stand there and watch her. 



She was the closest thing I'll ever have to a child. She was my only family. She was the only constant I had in my adult life. And without her, there has been nothing. Any time I see another cat, I feel like it would be dishonoring her to give them any kind of love that I have for her. 

The food I had stockpiled for her has sat and one can expired last month. I can't bring myself to get rid of it because it was hers. She had so little in life and I can't take it away from her. Lately, I've found myself very briefly smelling her in the air. It only lasts a minute and I don't know why it only recently started. 

  
I don't know how people do this. I don't know how to move on or live other than just the constant reminders of how she would have loved this thing I found at a store or imagining what things would be like if she was still here. There is no me without her but I hope that wherever she is, she's wrapped in love and happiness and knows that one day we'll be together again.",1,1750068183.0,seniorkitties,0,1.0,False

I'm going full green bean.,"In the past I noticed that I was enjoying my espresso less and less. I thought I was just being picky and that maybe I needed to try different roasters so I tried a lighter roast. Maybe a darker one. But nothing brought the spark that I used to feel. The espresso I was making were technically fine with good crema, balanced flavour but they were lacking soul. Like drinking someone else's coffee.

Then I met a guy importing beans directly from Vietnam. He roasted them himself in small batches. I gave it a shot. It was nicer, sweeter, more character, but still not quite right. So I asked if I could buy the green beans directly from him.

And oh boy I messed it up big time.

Now my entire morning routine revolves around coffee, not just making it, but continuing the process from previous days. Every morning I wake up and step into what feels like a tiny production line. It‚Äôs like running a small coffee farm from my kitchen (and half living room).

* **06:00** ‚Äì Stir the batch of honey processed beans that are currently fermenting. Open the windows just enough to get airflow without letting in too much humidity.
* **06:30** ‚Äì Flip yesterday‚Äôs beans on the drying rack. Check moisture content. Weight them to track water loss.
* **07:00** ‚Äì Roast a batch from 3 or 4 days ago. When I hear the first crack, adjust airflow, and remove and set aside.
* **07:30** ‚Äì Let roasted batch rest in a vacuum sealed jar.
* **07:40** ‚Äì Grind beans from 5 days ago.
* **08:00** ‚Äì Finally, makemy morning shot. Sip it and analyse. Today I have considered moving out and rent a flat on a different elevation for better airflow.
* **Rest of the day (when I have time)** ‚Äì Pulp fresh cherries I processed two days ago. Scrape and sort. Clean the mesh. Reset the trays. Label the batches.



The thing is that I enjoy the rhythm of it and feeling like I am at work. Every stage depends on what I did yesterday. There‚Äôs always something to finish, something to start, and something just resting.

Still, even this might not be enough. So I‚Äôm planning a trip to Vietnam. I want to go to the source. Hand pick cherries myself. Perhaps learn some Vietnamese. Bring back 10kg in my luggage and run the whole cycle from fruit to cup myself without intermediaries.

I‚Äôve been working on a concept called¬†**CUT ‚Äì the Consumption Universal Tax**, and I‚Äôd love to get your feedback. The idea is simple but radical:

\-¬†**Instead of taxing income, profits, or assets**, we apply a¬†*tiny fee (like 0.3%)*¬†to every financial transaction ‚Äî buying coffee, transferring crypto, purchasing a house, everything.  
This one micro-tax would¬†**replace all other taxes**: income tax, corporate tax, VAT, capital gains, inheritance, etc.

Some key principles:

* ¬†**No loopholes or tax evasion**¬†‚Äî Every transaction pays its share, whether done by a billionaire or a regular citizen.
* ¬†**Transparent, automatic collection**¬†‚Äî All handled by the financial infrastructure (banks, wallets, ledgers), with no need for tax returns.
* ¬†**Fair for everyone**¬†‚Äî You‚Äôre taxed only when you¬†*spend or move*¬†money, not when you¬†*earn or build*¬†it.
* ¬†**Globally adaptable**¬†‚Äî Works across borders, supports digital economies, and can be implemented on-chain or off-chain.
* ¬†**Built on blockchain**¬†‚Äî This is what makes it truly possible¬†*now*. A decentralized, traceable, and trustless system ensures compliance and removes the need for massive enforcement structures.

 I recently wrote a short book on it, but I‚Äôm more interested in what YOU think:

* Is this model fairer than our current systems?
* What are the unintended consequences I might be missing?
* Would people¬†*actually accept*¬†a shift like this?

I‚Äôm not selling anything ‚Äî just opening a serious conversation about¬†**rethinking tax in the digital age**.

Let me know what you think ‚Äî especially if you‚Äôre into economics, politics, crypto, or just wild-but-logical ideas.

1lcop4g,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lcop4g,Radish and Coffee Zen,"Zen has a long farming tradition. Begging was not a big part of Chinese culture, so when Zen migrated northeast, farming became a part of the practice. It's a healthy exercise and supplies fresh, organic vegetarian food. It helps prevent our practice from becoming mere book reviews and sitting down. It forces us to connect to the external reality. Further, it is an excellent manifestation of the Law of Cause and Effect which underpins our path. Plants, pots and animals are common objects of Buddhist thought experiments. 

That's why.

How?

Some of us are in physically small accommodations, so I wanted to share an option. Pots. From a windowsill to a big deck pot, parsley, radish, chilli, or potatoes are reasonable options. I'm lazy and ignorant so I plant everything and see what grows. Seeds are very cheap. 

Here's my pot of Daikon, Japanese radish, parsley, chillies and parsley. Initially, caterpillars were literally eating my lunch, and I was picking them off the leaves. Gross. And they just come back. So I tried putting used coffee grounds on the pot soil and they've never been back.

FYI. If you have Nespresso, as lazy people like me often do, you can use the device pictured to flip the pod inside out to collect the grinds. It helps if you cut or tear a line on the top foil before reversing it. 

I'm really interested to hear from people with a vegetable patch or farm on how it worked for them and their practice. 

BTW. My teacher gave me instructions on Buddhist pest control that I used on a zoo I was running. I'll put that on a post with some photos soonish.",1,1750067408.0,zenpractice,0,1.0,False

We've been living on her family's property in the country basically the whole time. We're in a part of Europe where it's normal to have a big country house with a small apartment and the old generation moves into the apartment when the younger generation takes over the bigger house and starts a family. Our life plan, all of our finances etc. revolve around her inheriting the property and us renovating it and living there. But with how her family are I don't want to do that anymore, I'm getting ready to move out end of this year.

**The most relevant parts:** Since C19 I've gained a bunch of weight. It was a lack of excercise from lockdown, depression and just bad habits. I'm working on losing it but it's obviously really difficult. Her parents and my in-laws in general minus the millenials and gen-z constantly make jokes about my weight or comment on my size.

It started a few months ago, I come into the kitchen and my FIL has been drinking with his friends playing cards and we chat shortly. For whatever reason he thought it was a good idea to say ""You know for a dude you have a huge ass."" and when I pushed back he got all defensive like ""whoa whoa whoa it's not meant in a negative way I'm just telling the truth"" I chose to ignore it cause he was drunk

Then it was my partner's aunt. Her family often show up uninvited for coffee or a drink (very normal here) and she was sitting on the porch when I got home, I said hi and no joke the first thing she said to me was ""wow those are the fattest legs I've ever seen. You're legs never used to be that fat"" I said nothing but people found out and she apolagised to me via my MIL (no, not face to face like a decent person would) but also got defensive about not meaning it like that and the kids these days being too sensitive etc. etc.

Then one morning while we were eating breakfast my MIL said we had leftover schnitzel from the day before that we should eat before cooking something else, so my partner said someone will probably eat them for lunch but she shouldn't worry they ""won't survive long"". My MIL agreed and said maybe my FIL will eat them, starts laughing and says ""Or maybe our little angel of death will come in the night"" and gestures towards me

Then yesterday we went out to a beer garden as a family. My MIL and FIL were riding their bikes behind me and were far enough back they probably didn't think I could hear them say ""Wow Cascouverite has a huge ass"" ""Yeah"" And that's it. I'm done with them. I'm out.

I ranted to my partner last night and she said I should talk to them about it. Talk to them? My FIL literally brags about not caring about what's polite and impolite, he will literally get into an argument with you about whether the n-word is OK to use as long as you aren't using it as an insult. He pretends to be nice cause he votes for the Greens and supports social safety nets and gay rights etc. He's been materially very kind to me, let me live here for free for a decade just cause I'm with his daughter, helped pay for our wedding etc. but deep down they're both venomous. mean-spirited, judgemental people and worst of all stubborn

These are just a few things they've said. There's so, so much more. This is just the tippety-tip of the iceberg. They've made fun of my sister-in-law for not having as prestigious a degree as my partner while we were all sat at the same table, my FIL says he doesn't take me seriously as a man because I'm not good with tools (I'm in IT and my hobbies are more typically feminine like art, cooking, sewing etc.) they judge random strangers on how they look while we're in public, they complain all the time about everything and are generally just nearly always in a shit mood and I'm sick of it

**TDLR:** my in-laws bully me and basically everyone around them and I can't have them in my life anymore or I'll go insane

I'm not going to take out a huge loan to renovate this house and suffer through another 20+ years of this. I'm not going to share a household with them and take care of them in old age. I told my partner a few weeks back I was jelous of people like her sister who moved and said the best part is not having to talk to people you don't like. And that's what I want. I will not live with them anymore. I know it's a huge bombshell and turns our whole life on it's head but I'm suffocating out here and beyond sick of all this. I'm done, and I'm trying to talk myself into being more diplomatic with her but my soul wants to say I'm moving out end of this year, please come with me, I love you, I can't stand them. She's coming home in a few hours and I'm still boiling mad from last night

1lcolu9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lcolu9,"Game/Trip Report: Dragons at Swallows, Tuesday 27 May","It was the first day of our first trip to Japan, and we were off to our first NPB game between the Swallows and Dragons.

Getting to the game from Shinjuku was super easy. We stoped by the team store on the way to Meiji Jingu Stadium to see what merch I could pick up. I opted for an away jersey (I‚Äôm not going to lie, I picked it because I liked the colours) and a mini umbrella, to fully embrace the run scoring experience. I found the prices to be perfectly reasonable, especially when compared to Australian Football League (AFL) merch back home.

I found the signage at the ground to be perfectly clear and we easily found our entry gate 9/10, passing the marquees of Dragons merchandise. Security check was super chill, professional, and friendly. Quite different to my local AFL stadium (Adelaide Oval). Once that was done and ticket checked, we were off to find our seats. It would‚Äôve been nice if there were ushers around the ground to help you find your seats, but we worked out where we were meant to sit. Being on the third base line, it was a mix of Dragons fans, Swallows fans, and tourists like us here to experience a NPB game. The seating is tight, but we expected this, so it didn‚Äôt come as a surprise. The drink holder was nice touch to the seats. Still, the seats are quite the improvement on the rickety temporary stands at Adelaide Giants games in the Australian Baseball League (ABL).

It was fun seeing the build up to the game. The active supporters warming up. The beer girls doing an elite job. It was a coolish night so I didn‚Äôt feel like beer, so opted to just grab a Coke from one of the soft drink girls. Couldn‚Äôt believe it was only 350 yen (about half the price Adelaide Oval charge for soft drinks). Later in the evening, I made sure my rubbish was collected by the rubbish collectors, grabbed myself the hardest ice cream ever from the ice cream girl, and even saw a coffee girl towards the end of the game.

As we got closer to 6:00pm, we had player intro (and the chants firing up even more), and the cheerleaders and mascots from both sides. I was impressed by how well both sides collaborated with this stuff. Players and umpires introduced, it was time for the game.

Being the bottom 2 teams in the Central League, the match itself wasn‚Äôt a night for the highlight reels, but it was the Swallows who scored first, and out came the umbrellas. Money well spent. Was more fun waving it around during the 7th innings stretch. Maybe I should try and make the umbrellas a thing at Adelaide Giants matches next season.

Also got to see a couple of umpire video reviews (something we don‚Äôt have in the ABL), and the one to see if the Dragons had scored a double homer or if it had gone foul in the 8th showed camera angles in the NPB can be just as inconclusive as other sporting leagues in the world. Was also interesting seeing how polite the discussion was between the Dragons manager and the umpires when they ruled it foul - a far cry from the theatrics of the MLB.

The Dragons and Swallows both scored in the 8th, and the atmosphere reached a peak as it looked like the Swallows would win this one. Honestly, it was incredible seeing the active support for both teams be non-stop throughout the evening, regardless of the scoreboard. I probably spent more time than I should‚Äôve just observing the active support, taking it in, doing some happy snaps/sneaky vids of them. Some of the chants are still stuck in my head.

This morning's dream was a doozy. I was in section 6 at my old store just as the evening shift started. We were instantly slammed and I wasn't even sure which tables were mine ... it was if I hadn't been on the floor in, oh I don't know, 30 years. üò≤ First 3-top had a guy who ordered coffee. It's 4pm in the summertime .. in Texas. Coffee!? One person at the table couldn't decide and said they'd have their drink order figured out by the time I returned with the coffee. Greeted another table .. can't recall what happened. It's a dream after all. I see other waiters and staff around (kind of) but I don't know them and I can sense that no one is going to help out. The third table was two guys on a date. One of them ordered a Bellaire or something. I had no idea what kind of drink it was (since my brain just made it up to mess with me), but I wrote it down and said we'd figure it out. I came back with drinks sometime later and the guys were being led away .. I think in handcuffs by police. There was more to the dream ... you know, to drag out those feelings of anxiety and make me restless. I actually woke up from this one finally and forced myself to stay awake for a couple of minutes to (hopefully) keep from going back into it. Ugh/Sigh. Thanks for listening.

Hey there! I‚Äôm a 19-year-old psychology student who thrives on curiosity, charm, and a hint of mischief. Life‚Äôs too short for surface-level connections, so I‚Äôm here looking for someone who isn‚Äôt afraid to dive into conversation, whether it‚Äôs flirty, funny, deep, or just a little weird (in the best way).

I‚Äôve got a thing for banter, the kind that makes your brain tingle and your lips smirk. I‚Äôm drawn to wit, boldness, and that unspoken tension that comes with clever comebacks and playful teasing. If you can match energy and aren‚Äôt afraid to challenge me mentally, you‚Äôve already caught my attention.

Power dynamics? I find them fascinating, both in conversation and in more‚Ä¶ imaginative spaces. Whether we‚Äôre flirting with words or exploring fantasies, I enjoy the dance of control, curiosity, and trust. If that piques your interest, we‚Äôll probably get along very well.

Outside the lecture halls and textbooks, I‚Äôm a mix of ambition and wanderlust. I love chasing new experiences, whether it‚Äôs trying something daring, diving into a spontaneous conversation at 2 a.m., or unpacking life‚Äôs big (or absurd) questions over coffee.

1lcocgu,https://visitistanbulofficial.com/what-to-do-in-istanbul-in-summer/,What to do in Istanbul in summer,"# Summer in Istanbul is vibrant and full of life. With long daylight hours, colorful sunsets, and outdoor events, the city becomes a playground for locals and travelers alike. While it can get hot during the day, the evenings are perfect for exploring. In this guide, we highlight¬†what to do in Istanbul in summer¬†so you can make the most of your sunny¬†adventure.

# 1. Take a sunset Bosphorus cruise

Cool off with a breeze and experience Istanbul from the water. A Bosphorus cruise offers iconic views of Dolmabah√ße Palace, Ortak√∂y Mosque, and the Bosphorus Bridge. The sunset colors over the skyline make for unforgettable¬†photos.

üëâ¬†[***Book your Bosphorus cruise this summer***](https://www.getyourguide.com/istanbul-l56/istanbul-bosphorus-sightseeing-cruise-tour-with-audio-guide-t461969/?partner_id=99QY9AM&utm_medium=online_publisher&deeplink_id=090f57ab-0400-503a-a7e7-ad19bd26f626&page_id=0596dff9-fb35-5858-b8f0-9173ee7a8032)

# 2. Visit museums during the heat of the day

When the sun is strong, step into the air-conditioned halls of¬†[**Istanbul‚Äôs top museums**](https://visitistanbulofficial.com/things-to-do/museums/). Explore the history of empires at[¬†**Topkapi Palace**](https://www.tiqets.com/en/topkap-palace-museum-tickets-l147296/?partner=visit_istanbul&tq_campaign=museums)¬†or admire modern Turkish art at Istanbul Modern. The Basilica Cistern offers both shade and atmosphere.

# 3. Discover rooftop bars and caf√©s

As the sun sets, Istanbul‚Äôs rooftops come alive. Sip a cold drink while watching the skyline light up. Rooftop bars like 360 Istanbul, Mikla, and Balkon offer a mix of city views, music, and¬†ambiance.

# 4. Enjoy local ice cream and refreshing drinks

Beat the heat with Turkish dondurma‚Äîa thick, stretchy ice cream with a show. You can also cool down with iced Turkish coffee, lemon soda, or fresh pomegranate juice sold in the¬†streets.

# 5. Walk in parks and gardens in the early morning

Before the heat sets in, enjoy a quiet morning in one of Istanbul‚Äôs many green spaces. Emirgan Park is filled with trees and sea views, while G√ºlhane Park offers a peaceful walk near the Topkapi¬†Palace.

# 6. Take a ferry to the Princes‚Äô Islands

Hop on a ferry from Kabata≈ü to B√ºy√ºkada or Heybeliada. These islands are car-free and perfect for biking, swimming, or simply relaxing by the sea. It‚Äôs one of the best summer escapes within the¬†city.

# 7. Visit a Turkish Hammam

Surprisingly, a hammam is just as refreshing in summer. The marble rooms are cool, and the deep cleansing experience will leave you feeling light and¬†rejuvenated.

# 8. Attend open-air festivals and concerts

Summer is festival season. You can find outdoor concerts, movie nights, and cultural events all over the city‚Äîespecially in places like Harbiye Open-Air Theater or K√º√ß√ºk√ßiftlik¬†Park.

# 9. Shop in the evenings

When the day cools down, head to the Grand Bazaar or Arasta Bazaar. You‚Äôll avoid the heat and the crowds, and the atmosphere becomes more relaxed. Local shops and boutiques stay open late in tourist¬†districts.

# 10. Watch the city from √áamlƒ±ca Hill

End your summer day with a panoramic view from √áamlƒ±ca Hill on the Asian side. From there, you can see the entire city and the bridges glowing at¬†night.

# Final tips for Istanbul in Summer

* Wear light, breathable clothing

So for your reading pleasure, I present to you how helped the cops find someone with an active warrant for their arrest.

Saturday rolls around and I am hoping for an uneventful night just trying to make it to 8 am so I can start my two days off.  Its a little after 1:30am and my co-worker just bought the mop bucket up front so he can mop the lobby, bathrooms and the break room.  I can hear him doing his thing as he gets things ready to mop as I sit on my ass playing on my tablet waiting for my last check in to arrive so I can start my audit afterwards.  The front door opens so I get up because I know I am expecting my check in at any moment plus it is getting close to the bars to shut down for the night in downtown which is just across the river so I know I will also being dealing with a few phone calls inquiring about our vacancies.  

Instead, I am greeted with a lady who has a story about how she was downtown and walked here because it was the safest place for her to go because she had someone falling her.  My co-worker is in the lobby because he just finished mopping in the hall way by the bathrooms and is giving us few minutes so he can move on to the main lobby area.  She was asking me about our address so she can get an uber to pick up and take her home.  I am standing here listening to her and I am not getting a good vibe from her.  I told her that I will give her a few minutes to get a ride but I can't have her hanging out her for long periods of time.  I ask my co-worker if his friend is doing his lyft job that night and he said no because sometimes he will offer to call him.  Of course, she starts asking if my co-worker will give her a ride and we tell her no because he is on the clock here and will get in trouble if he leaves.  I step away from the desk for a moment and my co-worker come back to the office area and we both agreed that something isn't right about her which was why he said his friend wasn't working.    

Finally 2 am hits and I walk back to the desk after watching her from the camera and I decided I will try and start the audit.  She starts asking about my co-worker giving her a ride, and I told her that he is working and isn't allowed to leave at the moment so she going to have to find something else.  Of course, I start getting calls from people asking for rooms, so every time the phone rang, I would immediately excuse myself and answer the phone in hopes that she would get the picture that she had worn out her welcome.  On the second call she just walks out the door and starts walking up the driveway.  

I get the audit done and my co-worker gets the lobby mopped up.  After taking the mop bucket back to the laundry room on the other side of the building, he takes a walk around the building and notices her at the picnic table by the duck pond in between us and the Australian steakhouse next door.  He took it upon himself to let her know that since she is not a guest, she is not welcomed back in the building.  He said she continued to give her some sob story about being scared for her live and that she was just trying to find a safe place to go.  He just let her know that she needs to get a ride and that she can wait at the table for it come.  

Around 3am, she is still at the table and both my co-worker and I are getting fed up because we are starting to realize that she is not even trying to get a ride home.  As I am munching on some crackers, she waltzes back into the hotel saying that she had called the police for a ride and that they told her to stay in the lobby.  I told her that contrary to what the cops said, she needs to left the property immediately and if I have to call them myself I will.  She starts going on about how it is not safe and she doesn't understand why we are not letting her stay in the lobby and I tell her point blank that she is on private property and she is not a paying guest and therefore needs to leave.  I told her that if she has to, she can walk over the restaurant and sit there until someone comes and gets her but as right now, she is not welcomed anywhere on hotel property.  

I walked away, grabbed my phone and asked my co-worker to call one of the managers while I called the cops.  I told him that the lady was back and said she had called the cops and they told her to come back inside.  We make our phone calls and management told my co-worker what we need to do once the cops got there and the two of us went out side to wait for the cops.

Once the cops got there, we explained what was going on and that we needed her name for trespassing processes per management and we let them do their thing.  I grab the coffee and got that started and went back to watch the action on the cameras.  My co-worker went out to the picnic table for a few minutes for a smoke and to be noisy and see if he could find out more about her deal and eventually came in.  As we were talking, I looked in the camera and go ""Dude, I think she is getting arrested."" and my co-worker came over to the camera and was like damn, she is.  So we go back outside to see what was happening.  From what we could find out, she had a warrant for her arrest out on her but we don't know for what and since we never got her name like we asked, we couldn't look her up in the system later.",25,1750065680.0,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,4,0.96,False

Anyways, on Father‚Äôs Day I worked with 2 other hosts: Coffee‚òïÔ∏è (hired 4 months ago) and Lemonüçã (also new like me).

I clocked in, walked to the front, and introduced myself to them. It was clear that Coffee and Lemon already knew each other. They only chatted with each other, which I understand considering I‚Äôm basically a stranger.

As our shift got busy, I get comfortable asking Coffee many work-related questions. While she was polite, she would sometimes smirk at Lemon before answering me. Eventually, it turned into little snickers before Coffee answered me. I start to feel super awkward from just these tiny actions!

Later on, I cancelled this couple‚Äôs spot from our waitlist because they chose to dine at the bar instead.

No one ever questioned me. I wasn‚Äôt stealing, I wasn‚Äôt disrupting anything. I just wanted to feel like someone who mattered. Like I had somewhere to be.

It sounds pathetic, I know. But those random hotel visits gave me a weird sense of motivation. Like I was rehearsing for a life I hadn‚Äôt earned yet.

Now I actually do have a stable job and I‚Äôve been invited to speak at a real conference next year. I haven‚Äôt decided if I‚Äôm going. I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll feel like I‚Äôm still faking it.",1,1750065452.0,confessions,1,0.67,False

In about June/July (2024) I had injured myself on the stainless steal countertop as the edges underneath were sharp enough to nearly slice off my thumb. No big deal it healed fine (left a scar about a half an inch), except during this, since we basically opened, we had been dealing with a klepto. This person had stolen personal items from coworkers as well as money from the register on multiple occasions. One day I was working on register with the suspected person. While here I received a wheat penny from a customer which I then proceeded to swap out for a normal penny (i collect wheat pennies for funsies) all was good all was normal, except the next week I‚Äôm pulled into the office and immediately let go for ‚Äúgetting caught on camera tampering with the register‚Äù as, you guessed it, that girl stole $60 the same day I swapped my penny! But heres the kicker, I had to go back and forth with management for months (after getting fired) as the credit bureau was after ME for the hospital bill I was told would be covered by THEM. After that, IMO, it felt like they had tried to just get rid of me after i injured myself with the way it all happened so fast, the way they made me come in to fire me 10 mins after getting there, and then going back and forth for MONTHS trying to get them to pay the bill. (It‚Äôs like they thought if they ignored it I‚Äôd pay it and leave them alone but nope! i eventually got it covered i think anyway) Anyways, I don‚Äôt fw 7brew after that I‚Äôm literally turned off by the thought. But I now work at a much better coffee shop that, imo, has MUCHHHH better frappes than 7brew, and I‚Äôm also a shift lead here üòù",1,1750065034.0,7brewbaristas,0,1.0,False

1lco3dk,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_TheNightAuditor1/comments/1lco3dk/sick_day_final_part/,Sick Day - Final Part,"*I found one of Dad‚Äôs old flannel shirts today. The green one with the ripped cuff he always wore when working on the truck.*

*It still smelled like him.*

*I sat in the garage holding it for almost an hour. Just breathing.*

*And then I looked up at the ceiling‚Ä¶ and I could¬†feel¬†the attic above me.*

*I need to keep going. I need to get through it.*

*Thursday. 2003*

I came into the kitchen around 7:45AM, my cast already starting to itch and the whole left side of my body sore like I‚Äôd gone ten rounds with a semi-truck.

The sun was shining through the curtains, warm and golden, like nothing was wrong. Like nothing had ever happened.

Mom was at the stove, poking at eggs she clearly didn‚Äôt want to eat. Her hair was pulled into a low, messy bun, and she had that¬†*tight smile*¬†on her face. The one she wore when things were bad, but she didn‚Äôt want me to know they were bad.

Dad sat at the table, already showered and dressed, black coffee in front of him. His work boots were beside his chair, unlaced. He hadn‚Äôt touched his toast.

Tori sat across from him, pushing a spoon through a bowl of cereal and scowling like we‚Äôd personally ruined her life.

‚ÄúHey, kiddo,‚Äù Mom said when she saw me. ‚ÄúHungry?‚Äù

I shrugged. ‚ÄúNot really.‚Äù

I slid into the chair beside Dad and winced as I bumped my cast against the table.

He glanced over, then reached out and gently adjusted my plate so I wouldn‚Äôt have to move it.

‚ÄúHow‚Äôs the wrist?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúSore.‚Äù

He nodded. ‚ÄúDoctor says it‚Äôs a clean break. You‚Äôre lucky.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt feel lucky.

I felt like something had reached out of the dark and tried to¬†pull me back in.

Tori let out a loud sigh and crossed her arms. ‚ÄúSo what‚Äîhe just gets to stay home all week now?‚Äù

Mom shot her a look. ‚ÄúVictoria.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? I‚Äôm just saying‚Äî*some*¬†of us have finals next week.‚Äù

Dad sipped his coffee. ‚ÄúThe doctor gave him a note for the rest of the week.‚Äù

Tori rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúOf course he did.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe has a broken arm,‚Äù Mom said, her voice thin.

‚ÄúAnd a head full of ghosts,‚Äù Tori mumbled under her breath.

‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù Dad asked, his voice sharp.

‚ÄúNothing,‚Äù she said, but she didn‚Äôt look at me. Just stared at her spoon like it had personally offended her.

Dad sighed and rubbed the bridge of his nose. ‚ÄúI have to go back in today. I told Jim I‚Äôd cover the shop until at least Friday.‚Äù

Mom nodded quietly.

‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt leave him here alone,‚Äù Dad added. ‚ÄúNot with his arm like that.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll stay,‚Äù Mom said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll call out.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù He shook his head. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve already missed two shifts. I called Mom this morning. She‚Äôs gonna come over and sit with him today.‚Äù

I froze.

‚ÄúGrandma?‚Äù I asked, trying not to sound¬†*too*¬†twelve about it.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôll be here by ten,‚Äù Dad said, like that was the end of it.

I looked at Mom, hoping she might object‚Äîbut she didn‚Äôt. She just smiled, soft and sad. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll like the company. She‚Äôll probably bring muffins.‚Äù

Tori snorted.

I just stared down at my plate, appetite gone.

I didn‚Äôt want muffins.

I wanted someone to believe me.

After everyone left, the house went quiet.

I watched through the front window as Dad backed the truck out of the driveway, Mom in the passenger seat, Tori slouched in the back. She gave me one last dramatic look before disappearing behind the glare of the window glass.

I listened to the garage door groan shut.

Then silence.

Just me.

I turned on the TV in the living room and laid down on the couch, cast resting on a pillow. The cartoons were bright and loud, but they didn‚Äôt do much to quiet the rest of the house. The attic was still up there. Still waiting.

I glanced at the clock. Grandma wasn‚Äôt supposed to be there for another hour and a half.

I‚Äôd just started zoning out to¬†*Pokemon*¬†reruns when‚Äî

*Knock knock knock.*

Three quick knocks at the front door.

I sat up fast, heart racing.

Not because I was scared, but because¬†*no one*¬†ever knocked that early unless it was a delivery or something bad.

I peeked through the peephole.

Three kids stood on the porch.

Zack, Taylor, and Blake.

My friends.

Well‚Äîsort of.

We ate lunch together, played¬†*Super Smash Bros.*¬†whenever someone had a sleepover, and texted more than we actually talked in class. They weren‚Äôt the most popular kids, but neither was I.

Zack¬†had a backpack slung over one shoulder and was holding a manila folder. Blake stood with his hands in his hoodie pockets, his hair a mess like he barely made it out of bed. And¬†Taylor‚Äîshort, sharp-eyed, in a jean jacket way too big for her‚Äîhad a Yoo-hoo in one hand and a silver pack of Pop-Tarts in the other.

I opened the door with my good hand.

‚ÄúDuuude,‚Äù Taylor said, eyebrows raising as she looked at my cast. ‚ÄúYou actually broke it?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo way,‚Äù Blake muttered, leaning closer like he was gonna poke it. ‚ÄúYou fell out of the¬†*attic*?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said, stepping aside. ‚ÄúYou guys wanna come in?‚Äù

They didn‚Äôt need a second invitation.

They crashed into the living room like we did every Saturday.¬†Zack¬†handed me the folder.

‚ÄúMs. C said to give you your makeup work,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe told her we‚Äôd stop by before school.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd my mom only said yes ‚Äòcause I told her you were¬†*tragically injured,*‚Äù Taylor added, tossing the extra Pop-Tarts she had in her backpack onto my lap. ‚ÄúStrawberry. You‚Äôre welcome.‚Äù

I sat down and pulled my blanket over my legs.

‚ÄúThanks, guys. Seriously.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid it hurt?‚Äù Blake asked, flopping into the recliner. ‚ÄúFalling, I mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúLike a lot?‚Äù

‚ÄúLike someone tried to rip my arm off.‚Äù

Taylor let out a low, long whistle. ‚ÄúMetal.‚Äù

Zack¬†gave her a look. ‚ÄúHe could‚Äôve died.‚Äù

‚ÄúStill metal,‚Äù she shrugged, cracking open her Yoo-hoo.

Then Zack tilted his head. ‚ÄúWait‚Ä¶ why were you even up there?‚Äù

I hesitated.

I looked at them‚Äîall three.

They weren‚Äôt jerks. They weren‚Äôt like the kids who whispered about me in the hallway. And they‚Äôd come all this way, early, before school, just to check on me.

So, I told them.

Everything.

About Mollie barking at the walls. About the noises in the attic at night. About sneaking up there with my lightsaber, and the nest. The scratching. The shape in the dark. The fall. The hand. The attic door¬†*slamming shut on its own.*

Their faces changed.

Taylor sat forward slowly; Pop-Tart half-crushed in her hand now.

Zack didn‚Äôt blink.

And Blake said, softly, ‚ÄúDude‚Ä¶ what the hell?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou think something‚Äôs living up there?‚Äù Taylor asked, eyes darting toward the ceiling.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI¬†*know*.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt chased you?‚Äù Zack asked. ‚ÄúLike‚Äî*actually*¬†chased you?‚Äù

I nodded.

‚ÄúI heard it breathe,‚Äù I whispered.

They all looked up at once.

The attic was directly above the living room.

And the house suddenly felt smaller. Quieter. Like we‚Äôd said something out loud we weren‚Äôt supposed to.¬†

For a long time, nobody spoke.

Then Blake whispered, ‚ÄúWhat if it‚Äôs listening?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt say that,‚Äù Taylor said, smacking his arm.

‚ÄúNo, seriously.‚Äù Blake shifted nervously in his seat. ‚ÄúWhat if it knows you‚Äôre home alone right now?‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, you‚Äôre freaking yourself out,‚Äù Zack said. But his eyes hadn‚Äôt left the ceiling.

A faint creak echoed from somewhere upstairs.

All three of them jumped.

I clenched my blanket in one hand. ‚ÄúIt does that a lot. Usually at night. Sometimes it‚Ä¶ moves around.‚Äù

Zack stood and grabbed his backpack. ‚ÄúWe should go.‚Äù

‚ÄúDude, come on,‚Äù Taylor said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not gonna leave him here alone with that thing crawling around the attic.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe have school,‚Äù he said, but his voice was shaking now. ‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs not like we can do anything about it in the middle of the day.‚Äù

Taylor looked over at me.

I could see it in her face. She wanted to help. She just didn‚Äôt know how.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs come back after school,‚Äù she said suddenly. ‚ÄúLike, tonight. I‚Äôll ask my mom if I can stay over.‚Äù

‚ÄúMe too,‚Äù Blake said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell my dad I‚Äôm staying at Zack‚Äôs.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy my house?‚Äù Zack asked.

‚ÄúBecause you‚Äôre boring and trustworthy,‚Äù Taylor shot back. ‚ÄúAnd we‚Äôre gonna need someone to bring snacks.‚Äù

Zack rolled his eyes but didn‚Äôt argue.

I nodded slowly. ‚ÄúOkay. Yeah. Tonight.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll bring flashlights,‚Äù Blake said. ‚ÄúAnd, like‚Ä¶ salt. Isn‚Äôt that a thing?‚Äù

‚ÄúOnly if you‚Äôre fighting ghosts,‚Äù Taylor muttered. ‚ÄúThis thing‚Äôs not a ghost. It‚Äôs something¬†*else.*‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, well‚Ä¶ what¬†*is*¬†it then?‚Äù

We all looked at each other.

No one had an answer.

Then‚Äî

BANG. BANG. BANG.

We all screamed.

Taylor nearly dropped her Yoo-hoo.

‚ÄúWHO‚ÄôS READY FOR MUFFINS?‚Äù a voice called through the front door.

‚ÄúOh my god,‚Äù Blake gasped, clutching his chest. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna piss.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just my grandma,‚Äù I muttered, stumbling to my feet.

I opened the door and there she was:¬†Grandma. Gray sweater. Big smile. A basket of muffins in one hand, an off-brand orange juice jug in the other.

‚ÄúOh! I didn‚Äôt know you had company!‚Äù she beamed.

Taylor stood, adjusting her oversized jacket. ‚ÄúWe were just leaving. School. You know.‚Äù

‚ÄúUh-huh,‚Äù Grandma said, eyeing the three of them with that warm, old-lady suspicion that could melt concrete. ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôll keep an eye on our patient here. Don‚Äôt worry.‚Äù

Zack cleared his throat. ‚ÄúSee you later.‚Äù

‚ÄúAfter school,‚Äù Taylor whispered to me as she passed.

Then she was gone.

All three of them, heading back down the porch and across the lawn, glancing over their shoulders like the house might try to follow.

Grandma shut the door behind them and turned to me, her smile softening.

‚ÄúYou look pale,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWant to sit with me while I knit? Or would you rather go lay down?‚Äù

I stared up at the ceiling.

At the attic.

‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm good right here,‚Äù I said quietly.

Grandma made me a grilled cheese and tomato soup and insisted I eat every bite, even though I wasn‚Äôt hungry.

She didn‚Äôt ask a lot of questions. Just hovered, smiling gently, pouring me juice, tucking the blanket around my legs again even after I kicked it off. She had that quiet, steady kind of love that made you feel guilty for keeping secrets.

After lunch, she flipped through the channels until she landed on a soap opera‚Äîsomething about twins and betrayal and a baby that might be cursed‚Äîthen settled into the recliner with her knitting needles clacking softly in her lap.

By the time the second commercial break hit, she was out cold. Head tilted, mouth slightly open, one hand still tangled in blue yarn.

The house was quiet again.

Except for the TV.

I left it on and padded down the hall. My wrist still ached, but the pills from the hospital were finally working. I just needed to pee and splash some water on my face.

I pushed open the bathroom door with my good hand and stepped inside.

The door swung closed behind me.

Click.

I turned the faucet on. Let the water run.

And then‚Äî

Footsteps.

Fast.

*Slapping*¬†across the hardwood floor outside.

I spun around.

Something hit the bathroom door.

Hard.

The whole thing shuddered on its hinges.

I backed up.

My heart was racing now, pounding in my ears.

Then‚Äî

A hand curled around the edge of the door.

Long fingers. Grayish skin. Black, cracked nails.

It gripped the doorframe like it was trying to keep me in.

‚ÄúNo no no‚Äî‚Äù I whispered, shoving against the door.

It didn‚Äôt move.

I pressed my back to the wall, eyes darting around the room, breath catching in my throat.

That‚Äôs when I heard it.

A low, rattling breath.

Not from the other side of the door.

From above.

I looked up‚Äîslowly.

The¬†vent above the toilet¬†was rattling slightly, the metal slats twitching like something was pressing against them from the inside.

A soft scrape echoed through the vent.

Then a finger.

Then another.

It was crawling out.

The vent cover popped loose with a soft¬†*ping*, clattering to the floor.

Something slid through.

Long limbs. Pale skin. Elbows that bent the wrong way.

It dropped into the bathtub behind the¬†shower curtain¬†with a heavy¬†*thump*.

I couldn‚Äôt move.

The room was dead quiet.

Except for the sound of it¬†breathing¬†behind the curtain.

Each breath made the plastic¬†suck in, then puff out again.  
Suck in‚Äîpuff out.

I could see the shape of it now, faint and twisted behind the floral print.

Then the curtain¬†moved.

Just slightly.

Just enough.

Like it was leaning closer.

I opened my mouth to scream‚Äî

The door yanked open.

Light flooded in.

The hallway. Grandma‚Äôs voice, faint: ‚ÄúSweetheart?‚Äù

I¬†ran.

Out of the bathroom, past her, down the hall, gasping, heart hammering like it was going to crack through my ribs.

She followed, confused, knitting still wrapped around her wrist.

‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù she called after me. ‚ÄúAre you okay?¬†

Grandma hurried in behind me, a mess of yarn still tangled around her wrist. ‚ÄúWhat on earth‚Äî? What happened?‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt speak at first. My chest was tight. My wrist throbbed. My heart was doing somersaults.

She crouched down beside me, one hand on my shoulder. ‚ÄúWas it your arm again? Did something‚Äî?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was in the bathroom,‚Äù I whispered.

Her brow furrowed.

‚ÄúWhat was, sweetheart?‚Äù

‚Äú*It.*‚Äù I pointed down the hallway. ‚ÄúIt grabbed the door. It came through the vent. It dropped into the tub‚ÄîI saw it. I¬†*heard*it.‚Äù

She stood slowly, eyes narrowing just a little.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll go check.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo‚Äîdon‚Äôt‚Äî‚Äù

But she was already walking. She walked to the kitchen and pulled a large knife from the knife block.

I watched her disappear down the hall, every second stretching out like rubber. I thought maybe I‚Äôd hear her scream. Or call for help. Or say something¬†*anything*‚Äî

But when she came back, she just shook her head.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing there,‚Äù she said gently. ‚ÄúNo handprints, no vent cover on the floor, no mess in the tub.‚Äù

My stomach twisted.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not possible,‚Äù I said.

Her smile didn‚Äôt reach her eyes. ‚ÄúI think you might‚Äôve dozed off and had a nightmare.‚Äù

‚ÄúI was¬†*awake.*‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt argue.

She just picked up her knitting and settled back into the recliner.

The house stayed quiet for the rest of the afternoon. Too quiet.

By the time my parents got home, I was already standing at the foot of the stairs, waiting for them.

Dad looked exhausted. His eyes were bloodshot, and his uniform shirt had a grease stain down the front.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still up?‚Äù he asked, tossing his keys into the bowl on the side table.

‚ÄúI need to ask you something.‚Äù

He raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù

I hesitated. Then said, ‚ÄúCan Zack, Taylor, and Blake come over?‚Äù

Dad blinked. ‚ÄúTonight?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust for a little while. Maybe a sleepover. Nothing big.‚Äù

He glanced at Mom, who looked at me with that tired mom-face that says¬†*not tonight,*¬†but also¬†*we feel bad for you.*

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, bud,‚Äù Dad said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still healing. And I‚Äôm beat.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey already asked their parents,‚Äù I lied quickly. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre bringing flashlights and movies. It‚Äôs just to hang out. I swear.‚Äù

He rubbed his temples. ‚ÄúYou sure you‚Äôre up for that? After the hospital and‚Äîeverything?‚Äù

I nodded, trying to keep my voice steady. ‚ÄúYeah. I just‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt want to be alone tonight.‚Äù

Something in that hit him. He didn‚Äôt say anything for a moment.

Then he sighed and reached for his phone. ‚ÄúTell them to be here by nine. Quiet night. No roughhousing.‚Äù

I nodded again. ‚ÄúYes. Thank you.‚Äù

He headed for the kitchen. ‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt go back in the attic. I mean it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt,‚Äù I said.

That was a lie too.¬†

The doorbell rang at 8:47PM.

Blake was the first one through the door, backpack half unzipped, his hoodie sleeves pulled over his hands. ‚ÄúYo,‚Äù he grinned, like we hadn‚Äôt just seen each other earlier that morning.

Taylor came in next, wearing flannel pajama pants with little bats on them and carrying a flashlight the size of a baseball bat. ‚ÄúWe come bearing snacks and questionable judgment.‚Äù

Zack followed with a tote bag full of supplies‚Äîflashlights, batteries, two packs of Oreos, and a sketchpad covered in doodles. ‚ÄúMy mom gave us Capri Suns, but Taylor chugged most of them in the car.‚Äù

I laughed‚Äîactually laughed‚Äîand stepped back to let them all in.

Then Tori came down the stairs in her tank top and pajama shorts, holding her phone and looking¬†*thoroughly unimpressed*.

Blake froze halfway through dropping his backpack.

‚Äú...Hey,‚Äù he said, all casual-like, but his voice cracked halfway through it.

Tori raised one eyebrow. ‚ÄúHey.‚Äù

She looked at me. ‚ÄúIf these dorks eat all the pringles‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWe have our own snacks‚Äù¬†

Blake turned to me, ‚Äúis she going to join us?!‚Äù¬†

¬†‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not invited.‚Äù

She rolled her eyes and started walking toward the kitchen. Blake stared after her like she was the sun and he was an unsupervised moth.

‚ÄúIs she staying home tonight?‚Äù he whispered.

‚ÄúShe¬†*lives*¬†here,‚Äù Taylor said. ‚ÄúStop being weird.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not being weird,‚Äù Blake muttered.

‚ÄúYou literally¬†*stared at her forehead*¬†like it had the answers to the universe.‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs too old for you, Blake,‚Äù Zack said, dropping the tote bag with a thud.

‚ÄúAge is just a number,‚Äù Blake replied.

‚ÄúAnd restraining orders are just paperwork,‚Äù Taylor deadpanned.

We moved into the living room and laid everything out: sleeping bags, pillows, snacks, the flashlight arsenal. I put on¬†*Tremors*‚ÄîBlake‚Äôs pick‚Äîbecause he claimed it was ‚Äúeducational‚Äù for people dealing with underground monsters.

Taylor was already halfway into the Oreos, and Zack was organizing the batteries like we were about to defuse a bomb.

It felt normal. For a little while.

The monster didn‚Äôt feel so close.

We laughed too loud. The movie jumped a couple times because our DVD player was scratched, and Blake kept yelling ‚ÄúTHIS IS FORESHADOWING‚Äù every time Kevin Bacon did anything brave.

But under it all, we were waiting.  
Waiting for the house to go quiet.

Waiting for the lights to go out.  
For my parents to retreat upstairs.

At around 10:40PM, they finally did.

We heard Mom‚Äôs voice say, ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt stay up all night,‚Äù and then Dad‚Äôs muttered ‚ÄúThey better not wreck the furniture.‚Äù

Footsteps on the stairs.

The creak of the bedroom door.

Silence.

Taylor muted the movie.

We all looked at each other.

Zack was the first to speak. ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ we doing this?‚Äù

Taylor nodded. ‚ÄúI say we check the attic. All of us. Flashlights, snacks, slingshot‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI forgot the salt,‚Äù Blake said.

‚ÄúNo one asked for salt,‚Äù she hissed.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just saying, if it¬†*is*¬†a ghost, we‚Äôre unprotected.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a ghost,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs something else. Something that breathes and moves and¬†*hurts*¬†things.‚Äù

Everyone went quiet.

‚ÄúI want to know what it is,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI need to know.‚Äù

Zack sat forward. ‚ÄúThen we make a plan. In and out. If anything feels off, we¬†*leave*. No hero stuff.‚Äù

Blake nodded, clutching his flashlight like a sword.

Taylor grinned and cracked her knuckles. ‚ÄúMonster-hunting club begins tonight.‚Äù

We turned off the movie.

And started getting ready.

We stood in the hallway beneath the attic hatch, flashlights in hand, all four of us staring up at the square in the ceiling like it might blink.

The pull string was gone.

Blake tapped the ceiling with a¬†plastic Wiffle bat¬†he‚Äôd brought for ‚Äúbackup,‚Äù as if the attic might just open for effort. It didn‚Äôt.

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶‚Äù he whispered, ‚Äúdo we have a plan? Or are we just standing here until the attic gets bored and eats us?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve got it,‚Äù Taylor said, stepping back and dragging over a¬†folding step stool¬†she‚Äôd pulled from the laundry room. She thudded it into place beneath the hatch, climbed up two steps, and squinted at the latch. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a little out of reach. I need something to pop it open.‚Äù

Blake held out a¬†ruler¬†with duct tape wrapped around the tip. ‚ÄúCustom made.‚Äù

Taylor blinked. ‚ÄúWhy do you¬†*have*¬†that?‚Äù

‚ÄúFor science.‚Äù

Zack just shook his head and held up the¬†metal rod from a broken curtain¬†they found in the garage. ‚ÄúTry this instead.‚Äù

Taylor smirked. ‚ÄúMuch better.‚Äù

She stretched on the top step, flashlight clamped under her arm, and jabbed the rod upward. It took a few tries, but finally‚Äîclick.

The latch gave.

The attic door didn‚Äôt fall open fast‚Äîit creaked down slow, groaning the way old wood does in scary movies, until the opening yawned above us.

We all stared at the darkness inside.

‚ÄúI am regretting this,‚Äù Blake whispered.

‚ÄúYou regret everything,‚Äù Zack said.

‚ÄúI regret¬†*being friends with you,*‚Äù Blake shot back.

I stepped forward with my cast cradled close. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll hold the ladder steady. When you all get up there you can pull me up.‚Äù

‚ÄúI got it,‚Äù Taylor said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll go first.‚Äù

Just as she grabbed the top rung of the attic ladder‚Äî

‚ÄúWhat the hell are you doing?‚Äù

We all jumped.

Blake actually gasped. Zack swore under his breath.

Tori¬†stood at the end of the hallway, holding a¬†half-eaten Pop-Tart¬†in one hand and looking like she‚Äôd caught us trying to summon the devil.

‚ÄúSeriously?‚Äù she said, eyeing the gear. ‚ÄúThis is your plan?‚Äù

‚ÄúI told you to stay in your room,‚Äù I muttered.

Tori ignored me. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going up there now? With a broken arm, a ruler, and¬†*Blake*?‚Äù

‚ÄúI brought a foam sword too,‚Äù Blake added helpfully.

‚ÄúI rest my case.‚Äù

Taylor gave her a slow blink. ‚ÄúYou coming over here just to roast us or‚Ä¶?‚Äù

Tori stared up at the attic, her face hard to read.

Then, without another word, she walked over, took the flashlight from Zack‚Äôs hand, and stepped beside the ladder.

She didn‚Äôt look at me. Just stared into the black square above.

‚ÄúMollie was my dog too.‚Äù

The hallway went quiet.

Blake blinked at her like she‚Äôd just confessed a crush. Taylor actually looked impressed. And Zack‚ÄîZack didn‚Äôt say a word. He just adjusted the flashlight beam.

Tori stepped up beside Taylor.

‚ÄúWe going,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúor are we gonna stand here all night waiting to pee our pants?‚Äù

The attic creaked as we climbed in one by one.

Taylor went first, her flashlight cutting a shaky beam across the dust-heavy air. Blake followed, muttering ‚Äúnope, nope, nope‚Äù under his breath the entire time. Zack climbed behind him, trying to pretend he wasn‚Äôt breathing fast. I was last, hoisting myself up one-handed while Tori reached down and helped steady me with surprising care.

The air was warmer than it should‚Äôve been‚Äîthick, almost humid. It smelled like insulation and mildew and something¬†*sweet*¬†underneath, like rotting fruit or meat left out too long.

‚ÄúUgh, it smells like someone microwaved a diaper,‚Äù Blake whispered, holding his shirt over his nose.

‚ÄúNo one light a match,‚Äù Zack said. ‚ÄúThe air up here might be flammable.‚Äù

We all stood together under the low, angled ceiling. The old Christmas boxes were still stacked near the wall. The fan blades Dad took down three summers ago were still leaning in the corner.

But the¬†nest‚Äî

The thing I saw two nights ago, made of insulation and shredded blankets and god-knows-what else‚Äî

Was gone.

‚ÄúWait,‚Äù I said, spinning slowly in a circle. ‚ÄúWait, no. No, it was¬†*right here.*‚Äù

I stepped toward the far corner, flashlight shaking.

‚ÄúThere was a nest,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIt was‚Äîlike, something had made it. It was here. It chased me¬†*from right here.*‚Äù

Tori walked beside me, scanning the floor with her light. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing. You sure it wasn‚Äôt another part of the attic?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm¬†*sure.*¬†I swear it‚Äî‚Äù

And then‚Äî

The attic breathed.

Or maybe it¬†*exhaled.*

A long, low sound, like something massive shifting in the rafters.

My flashlight flickered.

I turned fast. ‚ÄúDid you hear that?‚Äù

‚ÄúHear what?‚Äù Zack whispered.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know but maybe we need to leave,‚Äù Blake said. ‚ÄúRight now. No notes, no souvenirs‚Äîjust vibes and trauma, let‚Äôs¬†*go‚Äî*‚Äù

It moved.

A shape. A blur. Something behind the beams. It darted, fast and low, and¬†*no one else reacted.*

Only me.

‚Äú*It‚Äôs here‚Äî*‚Äù I yelled.

No one answered.

‚Äú*GUYS, IT‚ÄôS HERE‚Äî*‚Äù

The light flared, and then‚Äî

It lunged.

I didn‚Äôt see its face.

Just claws.

Long, black claws raked across the floor¬†as it tore forward. The shadows swallowed it and spat it back out like smoke. I saw it leap‚Äîtoo fast, too tall‚Äîand I shoved Zack sideways as it crashed through where he‚Äôd been standing.

‚ÄúWHAT ARE YOU DOING?!‚Äù he yelled.

I didn‚Äôt answer.

‚ÄúWE HAVE TO GO!‚Äù I screamed.

I ran.

Back toward the hatch.

Back toward the edge of the attic.

But the ladder wasn‚Äôt there anymore. Someone had pulled it up behind us.

And that‚Äôs when the thing roared‚Äîlow and wrong and wet.

It charged.

I turned to the only other way out: the¬†window.

A tiny square, just big enough to fit through.

‚ÄúTori!‚Äù I shouted. ‚ÄúThe window!‚Äù

I got there first, yanking it open with a grunt. Taylor was already behind me, kicking the crate under it into place.

We¬†climbed out one by one, onto the slanted roof just above the back porch.

The night air hit me like a punch. Cold. Wet. The stars overhead blurred by my tears and panic.

Blake slipped on the shingles and screamed. Taylor grabbed him.

Zack looked at me wildly, ‚Äúwhat are you doing!? Stop!‚Äù

Tori was last.

But as she turned to climb through‚Äî

The thing reached out.

A¬†clawed hand swiped out of the darkness, slashing toward her back. She twisted just in time, swinging the flashlight like a weapon and connecting with a sickening¬†*CRACK.*

‚ÄúGO!‚Äù she shouted.

But it grabbed her ankle.

She kicked. Screamed.

Zack reached for her.

The roof groaned.

She¬†*almost*¬†made it.

And then‚Äî

The shingle beneath her foot slipped.

And she fell.

I watched her tumble backward into the darkness below, her scream trailing off as her body disappeared from sight.

Then silence.

Just our breath. The hum of the night. The wind.

And the open window behind us.

Still breathing.

We stood on the roof for what felt like forever.

No one said anything.

The wind moved through the trees below. Porch lights from the neighbors cast long shadows on the lawn. And somewhere out there‚ÄîTori.

She wasn‚Äôt screaming anymore.

‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù I said, scrambling toward the edge. ‚ÄúWe have to find her‚Äî‚Äù

Zack grabbed my good arm. ‚ÄúCareful.‚Äù

Blake looked like he might throw up. His flashlight was shaking so bad the beam was bouncing off the trees.

Taylor was already climbing down the drainpipe mumbling as she went, ‚Äúwhy did you do that?!‚Äù¬†

We followed.

By the time we reached the ground, we found her crumpled near the base of the hedges‚Äîface scratched, one shoe missing, her left leg bent wrong.

She was breathing.

Barely.

Her eyes fluttered open for a second. She saw me.

Then closed them again...

The ambulance came fast.

Too fast.

Blue lights lit up our front yard while neighbors peeked through their blinds. My parents ran outside barefoot. My mom screamed when she saw Tori on the stretcher.

The paramedics asked questions. Zack answered most of them. Taylor barely spoke. Blake cried once, then pretended he wasn‚Äôt.

No one asked me anything.

No one looked at me.

Later, inside, the four of us sat in the living room, scattered across the floor like broken puzzle pieces.

The popcorn bowl had spilled during the panic. One of the sleeping bags was still half-zipped. The¬†*Tremors*¬†DVD menu looped quietly on the TV screen.

I hugged my knees, cast pressed to my chest, and stared at the carpet.

‚ÄúI saw it,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúIt¬†*grabbed her.*¬†It pulled her back.‚Äù

No one said anything.

Taylor sat with her back to the couch, arms crossed, face hard. Her ponytail was messed up, and her sleeve had blood on it.

Zack didn‚Äôt even look at me.

‚ÄúShe wouldn‚Äôt have gone up there,‚Äù he said flatly, ‚Äúif it weren‚Äôt for you.‚Äù

That hit harder than I thought it would.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt make her go,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúShe¬†*wanted*¬†to. She said‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Taylor cut in, ‚Äúshe said ‚ÄòMollie was my dog too.‚Äô Because she felt¬†*bad*¬†for you.‚Äù

Blake sniffled from the recliner. ‚ÄúYou said we‚Äôd just look. You said it wasn‚Äôt going to¬†*do*¬†anything.‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt¬†*know*¬†it would attack,‚Äù I snapped. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know it would‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all in your head, man,‚Äù Zack said. ‚ÄúThere was nothing there.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere¬†*was!*‚Äù I shouted, louder than I meant to. ‚ÄúI saw it. It chased us. It grabbed her ankle.‚Äù

Silence.

Taylor finally looked at me.

But not like she believed me.

Like she was looking at someone she¬†*used*¬†to know.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the only one who ever sees it,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs kinda weird, don‚Äôt you think?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt have an answer.

Taylor looked down to the floor, ‚Äúnothing grabbed her‚Ä¶we all saw what happened‚Ä¶you pushed her.‚Äù

I looked down at the carpet, suddenly aware of how loud my breathing was.

Outside, the ambulance was gone.

So was Tori.

The front door creaked open.

Mom stepped in first, her face pale like a ghost. Behind her came Dad, still in his pajamas, hair windblown, eyes heavy with something worse than anger.

The kind of look you give someone when you don‚Äôt recognize them anymore.

‚ÄúGet your stuff,‚Äù Mom said to the others.

No one said a word.

Taylor. Zack. Blake. They just moved. Silent. Tired. Like kids leaving a funeral.

I didn‚Äôt expect a goodbye, but it still hurt when I didn‚Äôt get one.

Mom ushered them out without looking back. Then the door closed.

Just me and Dad now.

The house groaned softly in the quiet. The movie menu still looped on the TV‚Äî‚ÄúPlay,‚Äù ‚ÄúScene Select,‚Äù ‚ÄúSpecial Features.‚Äù The last time anything felt normal.

Dad walked over to the couch and sat down slowly. He looked like he‚Äôd aged ten years in one night.

I didn‚Äôt move from the floor.

He rubbed his face with both hands, then looked at me.

‚ÄúI just got off the phone with the hospital,‚Äù he said, voice raw. ‚ÄúTori‚Äôs stable. Banged up bad. But she‚Äôs gonna be okay.‚Äù

I let out a breath I didn‚Äôt know I‚Äôd been holding.

He nodded to himself. Then leaned forward, resting his elbows on his knees.

There was a long silence.

Then he said, ‚ÄúYour friends‚Ä¶ they told us what happened.‚Äù

I looked away.

‚ÄúThey said it was your idea. That you made them go up there. That you were the only one who saw anything.‚Äù

I said nothing.

‚ÄúBut I believe you think it‚Äôs real,‚Äù he added, softly. ‚ÄúI do.‚Äù

My throat burned.

‚ÄúIt¬†*is*¬†real,‚Äù I whispered.

He didn‚Äôt answer.

Instead, he let out a shaky breath and said, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something I haven‚Äôt told you.‚Äù

That made me look up.

He wasn‚Äôt meeting my eyes. Just staring at the floor.

‚ÄúThe night Mollie died‚Ä¶‚Äù he started, voice slow, like the words were too heavy to push out. ‚ÄúI told your mom I found her in the attic. I told you she must‚Äôve gotten into poison.‚Äù

I nodded. ‚ÄúYou said she was already gone.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe was. But it wasn‚Äôt poison.‚Äù

He finally looked at me.

‚ÄúWhen I found you up there‚Ä¶ there wasn‚Äôt any rat bait. No spilled box. No teeth marks.‚Äù

He swallowed hard.

‚ÄúThere was just a¬†hammer. Covered in blood.¬†And your hands‚Äîyour shirt‚Äî*you*¬†were covered too.‚Äù

I froze.

A strange ringing filled my ears.

‚ÄúI thought‚Ä¶ maybe she‚Äôd already been hurt. Maybe you‚Äôd found her like that and tried to help. Maybe you grabbed the hammer because you were scared. I¬†*wanted*¬†to believe that. You had tried to soak up her blood with your blanket but‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúDad‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúBut now‚Äîafter Tori, after the attic, after tonight‚Ä¶‚Äù He trailed off.

I stared at him, my pulse thudding like thunder in my ears.

‚ÄúI think we need to go back,‚Äù he said quietly. ‚ÄúBack to the neurologist. Back to Dr. Kim.‚Äù

I shook my head.

‚ÄúYou remember what she said when you were five,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúAfter the surgery. About the scar tissue? That if anything changed, if the headaches came back, if you started‚Ä¶ seeing things‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm¬†*not*¬†seeing things,‚Äù I snapped.

He didn‚Äôt argue.

He just said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think this is your fault. But I think something‚Äôs wrong. Something we can‚Äôt see.‚Äù

I stood up, fists clenched.

‚ÄúYou think I hurt Mollie?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think something hurt you,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd I don‚Äôt know how to fix it.‚Äù

My chest felt tight.

My cast itched like fire.

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt see it,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúYou never see it.‚Äù

He stood, slower than me. Careful.

‚ÄúI see¬†*you.*¬†And that‚Äôs enough to scare the hell out of me.‚Äù

¬†

Mom stayed at the hospital with Tori.

Dad made a bed on the couch, but I knew he wasn‚Äôt sleeping. I could hear him tossing. Getting up. Sitting back down. Every hour or so, he‚Äôd check on me through the crack in my bedroom door.

He didn‚Äôt trust me anymore.

And maybe he was right.

But I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about it.

The creature. The attic. The way no one else had seen it. The hammer. The blood. The¬†*thing*¬†inside the wall breathing.

If it was in my head‚Ä¶ then why did everything feel so real?

Around 3AM, I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore.

I grabbed my¬†plastic lightsaber, flicked the red blade to life, and crouched beside the¬†wall in my room where I first heard the noise.¬†

The plaster felt cold under my fingers. Hollow.

I grabbed the old¬†metal bat¬†from under my bed.

And I started swinging.

CRACK.  
CRACK.

Drywall split apart. Chunks of insulation spilled onto the floor like guts. Dust filled the air like ash.

Behind it‚Äîwooden beams. And a gap.

Big enough to crawl through.

Inside the walls, it was tighter than I expected.

Spiderwebs clung to my face. The wood groaned around me. But I knew the house‚Äî*my house*. And I knew that if I went up just a little further, past the bathroom vent, past the pipes, past the beams‚Ä¶

I could get to the attic.

It was a short crawl.

But it felt like a mile.

The attic opened like a mouth.

The lightsaber buzzed softly, casting everything in a red haze.

And then I saw it.

The creature.

It stood taller than a man. Skin stretched too tight. Limbs long and crooked. Its mouth hung open‚Äînot for a scream, not a growl, just a sound like¬†breathing from the bottom of a well.

Its eyes locked on me.

It charged. I pulled back a marble in the slingshot and let it fly and it bounced off its skull.

I swung the lightsaber. Plastic cracked across its arm.

It didn‚Äôt flinch.

It lunged‚Äî snarling and snapping its teeth at me I tossed my arm forward

And it¬†bit down on my cast.

I screamed. Felt the pressure. The pain.

I slammed the saber against its skull over and over, backing toward the old boxes in the corner.

One toppled.

A can of paint thinner splattered onto the floor. The creature lifted me with one hand and chucked me against the far wall my arm getting tangled in wires in the corner. The weight of my body jerking them from their place and causing sparks to fly out into the air of the attic.

The flame caught the insulation like a match to dry leaves. The mix of the paint thinner and the sparks made it go up quick.

Whoosh.

Fire spread fast.

Too fast.

The attic filled with smoke.

Flames danced across the beams, chewing up memories. Christmas boxes. Old furniture. Toys.

The creature screamed.

A real one this time.

Animal and furious.

I scrambled for the window, climbing up onto the roof.

Smoke poured from the attic window behind me, thick and black, curling into the sky like a signal flare. The heat licked at my back as I scrambled onto the pitched roof, my cast thudding against the shingles.

The monster came through the fire.

It¬†burst out of the window¬†like a living shadow, its skin scorched and blistered, its claws dragging sparks across the wood. Parts of it still smoked. One shoulder was blackened. The side of its face looked like melted wax‚Äîbut it didn‚Äôt stop.

It moved like it couldn‚Äôt feel pain.

Like it had never been alive in the first place.

I turned and ran, slipping across the slanted rooftop, nails tearing at the shingles as I tried to crawl higher. The slope dipped fast near the edge, right above the driveway. One wrong step and I‚Äôd fall.

The creature lunged again.

I spun, swinging the¬†broken lightsaber hilt¬†like a club. It caught the monster‚Äôs jaw with a¬†*crack*, sending it staggering, but only for a second. It came back harder‚Äîclaws slashing.

One caught my side.

The fabric of my shirt ripped. I felt heat and pain, and then blood.

I screamed.

‚ÄúGET AWAY FROM ME!‚Äù

I shoved it. Hard. With everything I had.

We both slid.

Shingles ripped free beneath our weight. The roof groaned under us. A beam snapped with a deep¬†*POP*¬†from below.

I tried to dig my fingers into the edge. My cast scraped uselessly along the surface.

The creature grabbed my leg.

I kicked wildly, boots slamming into its burned face. Its grip loosened for just a second‚Äî

And that‚Äôs when the roof¬†gave way.

There was a deep, horrible¬†*cracking*¬†sound, and suddenly everything tilted.

The whole corner of the roof¬†collapsed in flames.

We fell together, tangled‚Äîme and the thing that wasn‚Äôt supposed to exist.

The air ripped past me.  
Heat roared up to meet us.  
Then‚Äî

Blackness‚Ä¶

¬†

The lights were soft. The air sterile. Machines beeped in slow, steady rhythms.

I opened my eyes.

White sheets.

An IV in my arm.

My wrist in a new cast.

And¬†Dad, sitting beside me, his arm bandaged in thick, burnt gauze.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre awake,‚Äù he said quietly.

My throat was dry. ‚ÄúTori?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs okay. Your mom‚Äôs still with her.‚Äù

I nodded.

‚ÄúHouse is gone nearly‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBurned up the attic and your room, the Fire chief says it started in the attic. Electrical wiring. That‚Äôs what they think.‚Äù

I looked away.

‚ÄúI pulled you out from under what was left of your room,‚Äù he continued. ‚Äúthe doctor‚Äôs said it was a miracle.‚Äù¬†

I didn‚Äôt answer. I looked at his arm that was bandaged, he must have been burnt in the fire trying to save me.

¬†A knock came at the door.

Dr. Kim¬†stepped in, holding a folder.

She smiled softly at me. ‚ÄúGood to see you, sweetheart. We ran a scan while you were under.‚Äù

She handed the folder to Dad.

He opened it.

Stared for a long time.

Then he turned it toward me.

An MRI.

Black and white. Fuzzy.

But clear enough.

Something round, pressing into part of my brain.

Like a shadow blooming behind my eyes.

Dad‚Äôs voice cracked.

1lco2r8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIO/comments/1lco2r8/aio_to_a_friend_driving_through_my_neighborhood/,AIO to a friend driving through my neighborhood at 4:30am?,"I‚Äôll try to make a 6ish year long story short. 

I (31 F) met a guy (28ish) who just moved to town about five years ago. We met online and it turned out he also played in a band (as do I) and he even was about to start a job at the place I work. We became pretty good friends, despite him asking me on a date or two and my expressing I just wanted to be platonic and stated that I also have always dated women, furthering my point of disinterest at that time. We hung out for a few years on and off, grabbing coffee and catching concerts. Nothing too crazy. Suddenly after about 4 years, he completely disappeared. Deleted me on all socials etc. 

Fast forward to about 4 months ago (about a year and a half since we‚Äôd last talked) he reached out to me - via PayPal of all things. Sent me $1 with a long message to get my attention about wanting to reconnect. I had admittedly sort of missed our friendship and was curious what happened, so I did send a text to the attached number and asked what he was wanting basically. Seemed normal enough aside from him saying he had connected with my ex wife on Tinder, someone he knew I was struggling with a divorce from during our friendship and that he ‚Äúquit talking to me because she said I‚Äôd talked shit about him and his band‚Äù, which was not true and seemingly very immature to not even ask me about it, imo. 

We continued to talk for about a month or two, and one night things got a little out of hand. Truth be told, I‚Äôd been questioning my sexuality a bit the past year or so and he ended up turning the conversation sexual, which had never happened before, and I was upfront and told him I‚Äôd entertain the text convo (regrettably) but that it would never go further than that, and if he wasn‚Äôt okay with that, the conversation needed to stop there. He ended up sending videos and I reciprocated with a couple of very mild photos, which I very quickly grew to regret. Since then, I‚Äôve been very clear it was a one time thing and even told him about a month later when he was still hinting at the topic, that I had decided to give it one last shot with my most recent ex. He‚Äôs continued to mildly push boundaries since and has sent a few inappropriate texts and requests for photos, to which I‚Äôve either reminded him of the relationship or ignored entirely. 

Fast forward to tonight. He sent a text at 2:38am asking me to go drive around town with him after he left the gym. Didn‚Äôt think too much of it since we both work nights (at different places for the past few years) and are off on weekends. He‚Äôd been asking me to hang out since day one of reconnecting but I‚Äôve yet to agree, and won‚Äôt be agreeing at this point. About two hours later at 4:30am I hear a loud car in front of my house and I turn on my doorbell camera but they‚Äôd left before I could see the car. I had an uneasy feeling I couldn‚Äôt shake, so I replied to his earlier 2:38am text and asked if it was him. He admitted to being in my neighborhood and claimed he was just ‚Äúturning around in the culdesac‚Äù - meanwhile I live in a rural area that isn‚Äôt really near anything, and it would‚Äôve had to be deliberate for him to be near my neighborhood. 

I told him this made me uneasy and that I have had a situation before that involved stalking and told him it was triggering some PTSD to have him just showing up unannounced outside of my house at 4:30am. I understand that he has every right to go into a public neighborhood, but just given the fact of the time of day, the crossing of the boundaries, the passive aggressive messages I get when I don‚Äôt respond, I‚Äôm uncomfortable. He follows up by saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs not like I was going through your car‚Äù to which I said, ‚Äúyes at that point I‚Äôd call the cops as that is trespassing and invasion of privacy‚Äù and he says ‚Äúso is it trespassing if I come to the door at 4:30am?‚Äù to which I told him I am uncomfortable with the conversation and don‚Äôt like to joke around about stuff like this and he kept giving ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù scenarios such as ‚Äúoh so if I was in danger and came to your door, you‚Äôd just call the cops?‚Äù

I‚Äôm fed up. I want to block him, but I‚Äôm honestly afraid he‚Äôd just show up. I feel like maybe my PTSD is causing me to overreact ‚Äî that would be my best case scenario honestly. But I do feel like this is creepy and crossing a line, even if it isn‚Äôt legally a crime or anything. AIO?",1,1750064886.0,AIO,3,1.0,False

1lco11s,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_TheNightAuditor1/comments/1lco11s/sick_day/,Sick Day.,"I don‚Äôt remember much of my childhood but the parts I do remember I wish I could forget.¬†

I hadn‚Äôt thought about that week in years.  
Not until I started cleaning out¬†*His*¬†garage.

This place still smelled like motor oil and sawdust. The old fluorescent light buzzed overhead, flickering every few seconds like it was trying to remind me that time doesn‚Äôt move the same in places like this.¬†

I found a half-finished workbench in the corner, dust settled over it like snow. The same one Dad said he‚Äôd finally finish ""when he had the time.""

He never did.¬†

Even with the windows cracked and the door rolled halfway open, the air clung to me‚Äîsawdust, WD-40, old sweat and rusted metal. The kind of smell that sinks into your skin. I stood there for a while just breathing it in, like it might fill the hole in my chest.

He was gone.

Three weeks ago, the cancer finally won.

It wasn‚Äôt sudden. We‚Äôd known for months‚Äîmaybe longer, if I‚Äôm honest with myself.¬†

But even when the chemo started thinning his hair and turning his skin that gray-yellow color, Dad never wanted to talk about it.  
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a bump in the road,‚Äù he‚Äôd said.  
He meant it.

He still worked in here up until the last two months, dragging himself out of bed with a thermos full of black coffee and a stubborn glint in his eye. I‚Äôd tell him to rest. He‚Äôd grunt something like, ‚ÄúNah, I‚Äôve still got a few good licks in me,‚Äù and then he‚Äôd go tinkering with something that didn‚Äôt need fixing just to prove he still could.

I used to sit on that upside-down milk crate and watch him work. We'd listen to the radio, WLIK on low, playing some twangy acoustic stuff that I hated as a kid and miss now like hell.

He didn't say much. Never did. But when I‚Äôd hand him a socket wrench without being asked, he‚Äôd nod like it meant something. Like maybe he was proud of me in his quiet way.

I think about that more now. All the things he said with gestures. The way he'd pat my back when he passed by. He wasn‚Äôt a perfect dad. Not by a long shot. He yelled when he got overwhelmed. Shut down when he didn‚Äôt know how to help. Hell, when I came out as gay, he just nodded and flicked the tv channel over to Will and Grace.¬†

He never really knew what to do with feelings‚Äîhis or mine.

But he showed up. Every time.

Even when I didn‚Äôt deserve it.

And now...  
Now I‚Äôm standing in the middle of his garage with my childhood in one hand and nothing but silence in the other.

¬†I‚Äôd come home to clean the place out‚Äîafter the funeral, after the casseroles, after the endless parade of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry‚Äù from people who didn‚Äôt know him, not really.¬†

I knew Mom and¬†Tori couldn‚Äôt deal with it.¬†

I was going through his old toolbox when I found it: my¬†*Space Jam*¬†blanket, folded neatly in the bottom of a milk crate, sun-faded and worn thin at the corners the blood stains soaked into the fabric and turned slightly brown with age. It was tucked beneath a tangle of orange extension cords and a cracked Thermos. I don‚Äôt know why he kept it. Maybe he forgot it was even there.

But the second I saw it... I swear I felt twelve again  
and then that whole week came back‚Ä¶¬†

The one we never told anyone about.The one I thought I‚Äôd imagined until now.

***2003***

*MONDAY*

Monday morning, I woke up to the sound of birds tapping on the gutters and the muffled slam of a screen door somewhere down the street. April sun was slipping in through the blinds in soft golden stripes. I reached for the alarm clock, blinking at the numbers.

7:04AM.

School started in exactly twenty-six minutes.¬†

I rolled back over and coughed‚Äîdry, flat, fake.¬†

But I‚Äôd been rehearsing all weekend. Practicing in the mirror, rasping like I had strep, even holding the thermometer to the light bulb for a second too long before chickening out and shaking it back down.

I wasn‚Äôt sick.  
Not in the way my dad would understand.

I just... couldn‚Äôt go back.  
Not to the jokes.  
Not to Luke Bennett and his sharp elbows and sharper laugh.  
Not after what he whispered in gym class last Friday in front of everyone.

The door cracked open, and Mom peeked her head in. Her face lit up when she saw I was awake.  
‚ÄúHey, sweetie.‚Äù  
Her voice was soft and singsongy, like she used when I was sick for real. ‚ÄúYou feel any better this morning?‚Äù

I shook my head dramatically and gave a weak little sniff. ‚ÄúNot really‚Ä¶‚Äù

She crossed the room and sat on the edge of the bed, brushing my bangs off my forehead. Her fingers were cool and gentle. I remember she was still in her bathrobe, the pink one with little blue flowers.

‚ÄúYou feel warm,‚Äù she said, though I was pretty sure I didn‚Äôt.

I didn‚Äôt say anything. I just gave her the most pitiful look I could manage.

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù she smiled, smoothing the blanket. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll go talk to your dad, let him know you‚Äôre still sick and see what he says.‚Äù

She kissed my forehead and stood up, but before she reached the door, my older sister‚Äôs voice floated in‚Äîsarcastic and smug.

‚ÄúFake,‚Äù she said, peeking her head around the corner with a smirk. She was already dressed for school, backpack over one shoulder, highlighted hair pulled into a sloppy ponytail.

‚ÄúShut up, Tori,‚Äù I muttered, keeping my voice low so Mom wouldn‚Äôt hear.

‚ÄúYou better hope you‚Äôre actually faking it. Because if I catch the plague from you, I‚Äôll kill you myself.‚Äù

I flipped her off.

She raised her eyebrows like she was gonna rat me out‚Äîbut she didn‚Äôt. She just snorted and walked off, calling over her shoulder, ‚ÄúEnjoy your sick day, loser.‚Äù

Mom didn‚Äôt notice. Or pretended not to. She just shook her head,¬†

‚ÄúLeave your brother alone, Victoria.‚Äù¬†

Mom walked away muttering something about the two of us being impossible and padded down the hall toward the kitchen.

After a few minutes I heard Dad's boots thud down the hall before he knocked twice on my door‚Äîhe always knocked, even if he was already turning the handle.

My head wasn‚Äôt hot. My throat wasn‚Äôt sore. But I still pulled the covers up to my chin and added a few dry coughs for effect.¬†

I‚Äôd practiced them the night before.

¬†‚ÄúHey, you good buddy?‚Äù

I coughed again, this time with a little throat rasp. ‚ÄúI still don‚Äôt feel good.‚Äù

He stepped in. His dark work shirt was already tucked into his jeans, sleeves rolled up, the familiar¬†‚Äú*Dale‚Äù*¬†patch stitched over his chest.¬†

His hair was still wet from his shower, and he smelled like Irish Spring.

He crossed the room in two strides and laid a calloused hand on my forehead. His fingers smelled like engine oil

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt feel like a fever,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre pale.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt say anything. Just looked up at him from the nest of blankets. The morning sun hit the side of his face, and for a second, I thought he looked tired. Not the kind of tired a nap would fix. The kind that just builds and builds until it lives in your bones.

He didn't press it. He never did when it came to me being sick. I think after my surgery, he started to believe I was made of glass.¬†

When I was 5 years old, I had a brain tumor, it was removed though and I was fine, but it scared the hell out of him and mom.¬†¬†

‚ÄúJust rest, okay?‚Äù he said, already halfway out the door. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna work in the garage most of the day. You need anything, come get me.‚Äù¬†

He turned back toward the door, then paused. ‚ÄúYou want anything? Waffles? Cereal?‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe toast.‚Äù

‚ÄúComing right up.‚Äù

He left without another word, humming something low and tuneless. I waited until I heard the faint clink of a toaster lever and the sound of the garage door creaking open before I climbed out of bed.

I spent the first couple hours exactly how I imagined: sprawled on the carpet, watching¬†*The Amanda Show*¬†on my old Zenith box TV, sipping Capri Sun through a chewed-up straw. My feet were cold. I didn‚Äôt mind.

The house felt... calm. Like it exhaled once the world left for work and school. I knew every sound it made. The way the fridge clicked when it kicked on. The creak of the hallway when you stepped just right. The faint¬†*clunk*¬†of the dryer vent in the wind.

But around 11AM, something was off.

I was halfway through a bowl of Cinnamon Toast Crunch, flipping through an old¬†*Nintendo Power*, when I heard a thump.

Not from outside. Not from the garage.

From the hallway.

Just one. A soft thud, like a dropped shoe or someone stumbling. Then nothing.

I muted the TV and listened.

Silence.

I tried to laugh it off, but something in my chest pulled tight. The air suddenly felt heavy, like when a storm's about to roll in.

I crept to the hallway and peeked down it. Every door was shut... except the closet. The one by the bathroom. Its door stood cracked open just an inch‚Äîjust enough to show darkness inside.

I hadn‚Äôt opened it. I was sure of it.

I stood there for a long time, heart punching the inside of my ribs. Then I grabbed the broom from the laundry room and‚Äîlike an idiot‚Äîpoked it shut from a distance.

*Click.*

I exhaled.

Later that afternoon, I asked Dad if he‚Äôd opened it earlier. He looked up from the engine he was working on, grease on his fingers and forehead.

‚ÄúWhat closet?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe hallway one. By the bathroom.‚Äù

He shook his head, wiping sweat off his brow with the back of his arm. ‚ÄúHaven‚Äôt been inside the house all day.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt say anything else. I think he chalked it up to imagination. Or nerves. Or both.

That night, I couldn‚Äôt sleep.

The ceiling fan rattled gently overhead, and the streetlamp outside my window painted familiar shadows on the wall. I pulled the blanket up to my chin and counted the blinking red numbers on my clock.

2:13AM.

I was just starting to drift off when I heard it.

A low hum. Not a sound I recognized. Not the fridge. Not the fan. Not the vent. It was inside the wall. Soft and vibrating, like a voice pressed through insulation.

Then... something moved across the ceiling.

Not a shadow.  
Not a trick of light.

Something that didn‚Äôt belong. Something crawling, but too smooth. Too slow. It passed just above me like a ripple in the plaster, just long enough for my breath to catch in my throat.

I didn‚Äôt scream. I didn‚Äôt move. I just laid there, every part of me rigid, listening to the silence that followed.

I didn‚Äôt know it then‚Äîbut that was only the beginning.

NOW

I shuttered the memory away and pulled out my phone to write this just so I didn't forget.

I tucked the blanket into my jeep and decided to drive home for the night. I have to come back to do more work in the garage and it's already so late...   ",1,1750064689.0,u_TheNightAuditor1,1,1.0,False

# The House That Love Built

""Don't be selfish,"" she hissed, then slapped me across the face. My sister‚Äîstill in her wedding gown. I looked around at the gasping guests, at my mother's satisfied smirk, and my father's approving nod. I didn't cry. I smiled. Because they didn't know: That house wasn't just walls. It was my weapon.

For three years, I was the granddaughter who showed up. While Christina was busy with her social calendar and my parents were consumed with their own lives, I spent my evenings in Gramma's kitchen, listening to her stories over cups of chamomile tea.

The house on Maple Street had been in our family for sixty years. Gramma had raised my father there, watched him bring home my mother as a bride, welcomed Christina and me as babies. Every floorboard creaked with memory, every wall held photographs spanning decades.

I wasn't the golden child. That title belonged to Christina, with her perfect grades, her sorority presidency, her engagement to a lawyer's son. When she walked into a room, she commanded attention. When I walked in, people barely looked up.

But Gramma saw me. She saw how I stayed late to help with her medications when her arthritis flared. She noticed when I brought groceries without being asked, when I fixed the leaky faucet she'd been meaning to have repaired. She knew I was the one who drove her to doctor's appointments and held her hand during the scary ones.

""You have a gentle heart, Emma,"" she told me one afternoon as we sat on her porch swing. ""Don't let them harden it.""

The day Gramma passed, I was there. Christina was at a spa weekend. My parents were at a conference. I held her hand as she took her last breath, and I swear she squeezed back one final time.

The will reading two weeks later surprised everyone. Christina got Gramma's jewelry. My parents received a modest cash inheritance. But the house, the land, the heart of everything‚Äîthat came to me.

""She spent the most time there,"" the lawyer explained when my father questioned the decision. ""Mrs. Henderson was very clear about her intentions.""

Christina's jaw tightened. ""But I'm the one getting married. I'm the one who needs a place to start a family.""

That night, over dinner at my parents' house, the campaign began.

""You don't need that big house, Emma,"" my mother said. ""You're single. It's too much for one person.""

""Christina and David could really use the space,"" my father added.

""I haven't decided what I'm doing with it yet,"" I said quietly.

What they didn't know was that I'd been planning for this moment for months. Gramma had been transparent about her intentions, and I'd used that time wisely. The house was already being transferred into an LLC I'd quietly established. I'd been meeting with contractors, architects, and the county planning office. The wheels were in motion for something beautiful.

Christina's wedding was everything she'd dreamed of‚Äîand everything our family couldn't afford. Somehow, I was expected to contribute.

""It's family,"" my mother said when she called asking for ""a small loan"" to help cover costs.

I wrote the check. Not because I owed them anything, but because I wanted to see how far they'd push.

During the reception, my parents cornered me near the bar.

""We need to talk about the house,"" my father said. ""Christina and David need it.""

""Gramma left it to me. She made her choice.""

""She was old,"" my mother said dismissively. ""She wasn't thinking clearly about the future.""

The casual dismissal of Gramma's mental capacity made my blood run cold.

""I'm not signing over the house,"" I said.

Christina appeared like a storm cloud in silk and lace. ""Are you seriously going to ruin my wedding day over this?""

""You're being selfish,"" her voice rising. ""I'm the one who's married. I'm the one who's going to have children. I'm the one who deserves a real home.""

The entire reception had gone quiet. Two hundred guests watching the scene unfold.

""Don't be selfish,"" she hissed, stepping closer.

Then her palm connected with my cheek.

The slap echoed across the silent reception hall. When I looked back at her, I saw my mother's satisfied smirk, my father's approving nod, David's mortified expression.

I didn't cry. I didn't yell. I didn't strike back.

I smiled.

Because in that moment, I realized I didn't just inherit Gramma's house. I inherited her strength. Her understanding that sometimes the people who claim to love you are the ones who hurt you most.

I left the reception without another word. That night, I sat in Gramma's kitchen and made a list of actions. While they'd been busy playing family politics, I'd been busy building something real.

What my family didn't know was that Gramma hadn't just left me the house. She'd left me the entire three-acre lot it sat on, plus the adjacent two acres she'd quietly purchased over the years. Five acres total, right in the heart of what was now the town's historic district.

Five acres that I'd spent months getting rezoned for public use.

While Christina had been planning her wedding, I'd been planning a legacy. Gramma's house wasn't going to be anyone's private residence. It was going to be a community heritage museum and caf√©, celebrating the history of our town and the strong women who'd shaped it. The surrounding land would become a public garden where people could come to find peace.

I'd already hired the staff. The caf√© equipment was being delivered. The exhibit cases were being custom-built. The grand opening was scheduled for two months away.

One month after the wedding, Christina called.

""David and I are ready to move into the house,"" she announced.

""You can't move into the house,"" I said calmly.

""Don't start this again, Emma.""

""Christina, you literally cannot move into the house. It's not residential property anymore. It's been rezoned. It's part of the county historical district now. The house is being converted into a museum and caf√©.""

Silence. Then: ""You're lying.""

""Drive by and see for yourself.""

Twenty minutes later, my father called. ""What the hell have you done?""

""I've honored Gramma's memory.""

""You've destroyed this family!""

""No, Dad. I've just stopped letting this family destroy me.""

They arrived within the hour‚ÄîChristina, David, both my parents, even David's parents. They stood on my front porch like an angry mob.

""You had no right,"" my mother said.

""I had every right. It's my property.""

""We're family,"" my father said. ""Family doesn't do this to family.""

""You're right. Family doesn't humiliate each other at weddings. Family doesn't dismiss a dying woman's wishes.""

Construction fencing surrounded the property. A sign announced the future home of ""Henderson Heritage Museum & Caf√©."" Workers were replacing the roof tiles with historically accurate materials.

""We'll sue you,"" my mother said desperately.

""With what legal standing? You don't own the property. You never did.""

Over the next few weeks, I watched my family's carefully constructed world begin to fall apart. Christina's marriage, built on mutual narcissism and financial expectations, couldn't survive the stress. My parents, who'd been counting on the house as part of their retirement planning, suddenly found themselves with a much smaller nest egg.

Meanwhile, the museum project was thriving. The house was being lovingly restored to its 1920s glory. The kitchen, where Gramma and I had shared so many conversations, was being converted into a caf√© kitchen that would serve her famous apple pie recipe. The back parlor was being turned into a memory room dedicated to her story and the stories of other women who'd shaped our community.

This was what legacy looked like. Not a house hoarded by family, but a gift to the community.

Three months after the wedding, they came to my apartment‚Äîall four of them. They looked smaller somehow, diminished.

""We didn't mean for it to go this far,"" my father said.

""Christina and I are having problems,"" David said. ""We might get divorced.""

""I need help,"" Christina said finally. ""Financial help.""

""And we were hoping,"" my mother jumped in, ""that maybe we could be partners in the museum project.""

""No.""

I served them tea in Gramma's china and pulled out a folded letter.

""Gramma wrote this to me, but she wrote it for all of us. She gave it to me two weeks before she died.""

I read them her words about love lived out daily, quietly, without fanfare. About not owing anyone your inheritance, your peace, your happiness. About building something beautiful.

""She knew this would happen,"" David said quietly.

""She hoped it wouldn't,"" I said. ""But she prepared me in case it did.""

""Can you forgive me?"" Christina asked, her voice small.

""I can forgive you. But I can't trust you. And I can't enable you anymore.""

""So that's it? You're just cutting us off?""

""I'm setting boundaries. You're welcome to visit the museum when it opens. You're welcome to try to rebuild relationships based on mutual respect rather than financial dependence.""

Six months later, I stood in the doorway of Henderson Heritage Museum & Caf√© on opening day. The space breathed with purpose and community. Children ran through the gardens while their parents read on benches. The caf√© served Gramma's recipes alongside coffee and conversation.

That evening, I found my parents waiting outside.

""It's beautiful,"" my mother said. ""Your grandmother would be proud.""

""Christina's moved back home,"" my mother continued. ""The divorce is final. She's working at the bank now. She's different. Quieter.""

""We're all growing up,"" my father said. ""A little late, but still.""

""We're sorry,"" he added. ""For all of it. For not seeing you, for not supporting you, for trying to take away what was rightfully yours.""

""Is there a chance we could try again? As a family?""

""There's always a chance,"" I said. ""But it starts with respect. And it continues with consistency. And it's built on the understanding that family isn't just about blood‚Äîit's about how we treat each other.""

I walked through the gardens to the bench where Gramma used to sit, now dedicated with a small plaque: ""In memory of Martha Henderson, who taught us that love is a verb.""

""They taught me that blood meant obligation,"" I said aloud. ""You taught me that love meant legacy.""

This place would be here long after I was gone, serving the community, honoring the women who'd built it, providing a space for peace and reflection. This was legacy. This was love made manifest.

Some victories are loud and dramatic. Others are quiet and enduring. The best ones transform not just your life, but the lives of everyone who comes after you.

And they start with a single, radical act: choosing to love yourself enough to build something beautiful.",0,1750064442.0,stories,0,0.47,False

Did it stop standing for freedom and democracy?
It‚Äôs a real tragedy.
Because as everyone knows, America used to be the global supplier of freedom.

Just ask the Native Americans.
They were introduced to freedom through modern civilization, forced migration, and smallpox.
Then came slavery, to be fair, was a strong economic foundation.
So strong, in fact, that it eventually allowed America to afford abolition.
That‚Äôs called long-term planning.

In the Philippines, freedom was imported straight from Spain via American intervention.
And then held in a storage unit for a few decades,
just to make sure the locals didn't mess it up.

America helped end World War II by introducing nuclear liberty to Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
Quick, efficient, unmistakably democratic.

Later, in Latin America, freedom showed up wearing sunglasses and a CIA badge.
Democracy might‚Äôve been elected,
but America knew what the region really needed:
military coups, death squads, and just enough capitalism to keep the coffee flowing.

Iran almost fell into socialism in 1953, but America saved the day,
by reinstalling a monarchy.
Because what screams ""people's freedom"" like a royal dictatorship?

Vietnam was another close call.
Millions died, but freedom almost made it.
A valiant effort.

Iraq?
Well, who wouldn‚Äôt want to be bombed into democracy?
Freedom came, saw, and destabilized.

And Libya ‚Äî
Gaddafi was a brutal man, no doubt.
Luckily, freedom came again.
Today, Libya is a thriving hub of‚Ä¶ open-air slave markets.
Progress.

America also helps maintain peace by selling weapons to nearly every region on fire.
Yemen, Israel, Saudi Arabia ‚Äî
it‚Äôs all part of the grand strategy called ‚Äúregional stability.‚Äù

At home, America defends liberty through mass incarceration, police militarization,
and choosing not to give people healthcare 
because true freedom means dying with options.

Global economic freedom?
That‚Äôs the IMF‚Äôs job.
Just lend poor nations money with strings attached,
cut public services, raise debt and boom.
Freedom via austerity.

And let‚Äôs not forget the great protector of liberty: Israel 
the Middle East‚Äôs only democracy*,
(*with caveats for occupation, checkpoints, walls, and stateless millions).
America ensures this beacon stays bright, with billions in annual aid,
advanced weapons, and ironclad veto power.

So when people say,
‚ÄúAmerica has changed. It doesn‚Äôt stand for freedom anymore,‚Äù
you have to wonder...

Did it change?
Or did we just stop believing the story?

Because the story never changed.

1lcnvrq,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lcnvrq/i_think_im_starting_to_fall_in_love_with_my_best/,"I think I‚Äôm starting to fall in love with my best friend, but I‚Äôm taken","TL; DR at the bottom

I‚Äôm gonna be‚Ä¶ vague, to say the least, when it comes to identifiers and age. My partner will be A, my best friend will be B. Everyone involved is over the age of consent where we live. I just, really can‚Äôt risk either of them potentially connecting this post to me. I‚Äôm probably gonna keep this account up, just to see if anyone has advice, or insults me for being emotionally unfaithful (if that‚Äôs how you deem my feelings to be, I still am unsure myself). With the account staying up, I don‚Äôt plan on responding to many comments, and if I respond to any, it will be very selective. 

Also, I want to be clear, my feelings for both A and B being what they are right now is no one‚Äôs fault but my own. I don‚Äôt think A is purposely doing anything to have us in a not-so-rough rough patch. I don‚Äôt think B is trying to test my loyalty to A or attempting to steal me from A. 

Anyways, I‚Äôve been with A for almost a decade. I‚Äôve maybe known B for 2 years. I have no reason to no longer love A. A is an amazing partner, and the only healthy relationship I have ever had. Things may not be the honeymoon period we had for the first few years together, but she has never betrayed my trust, and still makes me smile. 

B, however, I haven‚Äôt been able to get off my mind as of late. We shared a course when we first truly met. We had met through a mutual (now ex) friend before hand, but the class is what I count as our true meeting, as that‚Äôs when we got to know each other. As soon as we began to connect, it was instant riffing off one another. For a while, genuinely just a really good platonic relationship. 

When school ended a few weeks ago, I especially missed her. We‚Äôve had a few school breaks since knowing each other before, but almost the day after school ended this time I wanted to hang out. We hung out again a few days ago, B, a few friends, and I. Most of us were cross faded, but B only drank. It was the first time we had been intoxicated in front of each other. B turned to our shared closest mutual friend laughing shyly, saying, ‚ÄúWait, OP can‚Äôt see me like this,‚Äù and I almost instantly asked why I specifically couldn‚Äôt with no answer but more shy, cute laughter. 

As the night progressed, swimming was involved and B tried multiple times to try to egg me into joining, but I just couldn‚Äôt do to some medical reasons. When B was done swimming, however, they chose to sit next to me. Before that break, I had never noticed them actively choose to sit next to me. If anything, we almost always sat across from each other. 

After this, some time passed and we hung out again, once again with friends in a slightly larger group. B once again sat across from me like the night we were intoxicated (this is in reference to before the swimming happened), and we kept exchanging glances (something we also did when we were intoxicated). I couldn‚Äôt tell if that was just pure accident or us both actively eyeing each other. I know I was more observing to see how B acted, incase I read the prior hangout‚Äôs interactions wrong. 

During this second hangout, the whole group played lots of games. Some video games, some card games. Whenever we were playing the games with each other, B always sat next to me. We even switched controllers to pick each other‚Äôs characters and attributes for the games requiring any. This was something I could potentially see happening with a platonic friend, but not an interaction I have had with one before. 

Someone I have had similar interactions with is A. Both recently, and earlier into our relationship. I just couldn‚Äôt help but feel that B was being playful or even flirtatious, but Ik some people in our friend group do just, platonically flirt, if that makes sense. It‚Äôs just, I have a boundary of not doing that. I‚Äôve been cheated on before. I never want to find myself being the cheater. Although, recently, I‚Äôve noticed I am happier around B than I am with A. I smile more with B. I roll my eyes and/or get frustrated more with A. 

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm willing or wanting to leave A. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve fallen out of love with A. I‚Äôm just trying to say this somewhere, anywhere that I don‚Äôt think A or B will see this. I think that A and I are just finally in a true ‚Äútest patch‚Äù of our relationship. We‚Äôve never really bickered or argued with each other outside of it being playful, and now is (somehow barely) when that has changed. I guess that‚Äôs what happens when you‚Äôve spent the majority of your life with the same partner (we‚Äôve been together since early teens).

I also, really, desperately want to find out if I‚Äôve been reading B‚Äôs actions the last few times we saw each other correctly. I‚Äôm trying to hang out with them again soon, preferably just us two over coffee since that‚Äôs something we semi-regularly get together. I just worry that I am falling in love with B while simultaneously still loving A. I can‚Äôt get B off my mind. I find myself thinking of B when driving, working, playing games, scrolling the internet, basically doing anything, I get distracted by the thought of B. But I still love A with all my heart. 

A will always be my first true love, and I still see her as my true love. I think my relationship and closeness with B is just confusing me. Maybe the fact B is moving before the year ends is adding to it, too? I don‚Äôt really know. Again, I probably won‚Äôt respond to many comments, but if there‚Äôs any words of wisdom you think may help me wrap my head around this moment, please, say them. 

TL;DR Partner is amazing, but things are semi-rough rn, best friend is currently who I feel happiest around, and I‚Äôm feeling confused both about how I feel and how they may feel due to recent actions of theirs, maybe amplified by knowing they are leaving before the year ends.

If I am at work, or sometimes at home with my housemates, when my co-worker or housemate is going to the shop, they will ask me if I want anything. I never know exactly what to say, because it‚Äôs unclear if they‚Äôre expecting me to pay for it or whether they are offering buy for me. I think it‚Äôs fair to say that the true answer is neither and it‚Äôs just a social ritual to make me feel like I‚Äôm being considered, and that I‚Äôm supposed to decline the offer. Which is fine, no problem with that. I‚Äôm happy to pay for my own things but the faff of transferring money etc for a small purchase is more work than just going to the shop myself.

But here‚Äôs a trickier example. Often, when I go to job interviews (barista or restaurant), I will be offered a drink, usually a coffee. I assume because I‚Äôve reached the stage of an interview, this will be free of charge, so that‚Äôs not the issue. The issue is that I don‚Äôt know whether it is more impolite to accept or decline the offer. Especially because every time I decline, I am asked at some point afterwards if I‚Äôm really sure I don‚Äôt want anything. But obviously I don‚Äôt want to make someone do extra work, especially because I usually actually don‚Äôt want a drink. 

It feels to me like a test that has no right answer. Either I appear entitled and greedy by accepting, or cold and ungrateful for declining. Yes that‚Äôs a bit of an exaggeration. But I wonder whether my answer has ever affected my chances of getting a job.

Does anyone have insight into this ritual? Is this just a cultural thing (I‚Äôm in the uk)? Is it considered perfectly fine to always say yes to these kind of offers where you‚Äôre from?

At first is it only calls or do you meet the family in person itself in first step?

How long do you take to finalize? When does the pen paarkum padalam with coffee, mixture really comes into picture? 

How do you manage stress? How do you know this is the one? What all things that you look for or would have been better if you had looked for?

Agency: Booked through Costco 
Price: 7,826.73 CAD for 9 days 
Dates: 12/18/25 - 12/27/25
Room Type: Premium Oceanfront w/ Terrace 
Travellers: Couple (24f,25m)
Flew from Edmonton direct to Cancun

Other resorts we considered: 

- Beloved Playa Mujeres 
- Secrets The Vine
- Xcaret Arte

We've done a lot of research prior to booking a vacation, so we wanted to give back and add some feedback and hopefully help people out! We settled on Live Aqua because it seemed to check a lot of our boxes without breaking our bank wallet too bad!

Airport: 

We flew six hours from Edmonton and landed in Cancun. In December, we left -30 weather and landed in a humid but sort of cloudy weather. It took us about 5-10 minutes to get threw immigration, we went through the e-gates but they didn't work but we just went to the attendant. There was no line for e-gates. For luggage, it took about thirty minutes for our luggage to come out. We used Happy Shuttle for our twenty minute commute to Live Aqua. 

Check-In: 

We did not opt for Aqua Club as we wanted a room with a terrace. My girlfriend sleeps in until about 9:00 and I wake up earlier so it's nice to have a coffee and enjoy the view. With that being said, we didn't get the private check-in that comes with Aqua Club however we don't think it's needed just for check in. It was super quick, and there was not even an attempt at a timeshare pitch. To the point where I'm not even sure if they offer it. 

Room: 

The room was sleek, modern and functional. The Molton Brown product was great and maid service was phenomenal. We wish the AC worked better however we understand we are indulging in a tropical vacation. 

Food: (7/10)

Here's the thing, the food was a little bit okay, however we've read that the food for people exceed expectations by a lot. We are not picky eaters, however when people rave about the food it made me think that the dishes were resturant level back home. For us, the majority of the food was just below that, some was as good and few were better!

We'll start with the better, for sure the habanero cream soup that everyone talks about definitely exceeds expectations. As well as the steak, and as a matter of fact, almost everything at MB exceeds our criteria of ""restaurant quality back home"". 

Every dish and restaurant we went to was good and edible, but if you are looking for an experience like what I've seen culinarily from Xcaret Arte or Atelier this falls below that. 

If we were to use Xcaret Art/Atelier as 9/10 and Harry's as a 10/10 I think Live Aqua food falls into the 7/10 category. 

Beach: (9/10) 

There was no drop-off, seaweed or anything when we went. The blue and white sand was perfect! It obviously was rougher than the beaches at Isla Mujeres but for us, we prefer an ocean with actual waves. There were plenty of cheers and Bali beds as well! We went down at 10:00am and there were always chairs available, and December was close to max capacity one of the workers told us. 

Pools (8/10) 

There are a lot of pools and there are different temperatures. Unfortunately the heater wasn't working when we were there, but we're Albertans so we don't mind cold water. The pool design is functional but a bit dated, but that's just us being picky!

Service (12/10) 

It's just different here. All the little touches. We ordered mini beers our whole vacation and somehow after the first night, when we came back from dinner to our room, there were mini beer shots left out for us!

Turn down folded clothes every single night and help organized our thing. 

Restaurants if they see you coming a lot will offer special plates. After our third time at MB the chef offered to make us something off the menu and even send us upstairs with some appetizers as well. 

We can't even remember all the small touches they do but everything seemed catered to us. Our cabana had signs and everything every time as well. They really go the extra mile. 

Nightlife/Activity: (6/10)

Okay so here's the thing. The nightlife is there and people are having a great time until 1-2am. For us, the nightlife was perfect, much above 6/10 but I think for most people 6/10 would be where it falls. 

Our thing is, you can always have a sense of class and luxury at Live Aqua and look for party. Sometimes when you're at a place that's party focused, it's hard to find the luxury and class. 

The Karaoke, Casino night, Bar and magic shows were good for us, and we met some pretty fun people as well. They really put a strong effort for activities however I do think it will fall short for most people. It isn't really organically energetic or fun, it feels more structured or planned like meet us at the lobby bar for a silent disco kind of thing- which is okay with us. 

Location: 

It was honestly perfect being right next to L√† Isla and right down the street from the Xcaret Ferry to go to Isla Mujeres. Just a tip, go with the Xcaret Ferry!! The lines are so much shorter coming back and going. We were able to Uber a lot to. 

Final Conclusion: 

We chose Live Aqua because of the food and the beach and service. It hit the mark on most things and well exceeded it on others. 

It was fun, great and we would go again. However we do believe there are better options out there within the same price range that hits marks better and broader. 

Example: We wanted tranquility, intimacy, and great food. We believe Atelier or Beloved would have done that better for us within the price range looking back.  

We also knew Xcaret Arte would have checked more boxes but was a bit more expensive, didn't offer a beach and was quite a distance from the airport. 

You WILL enjoy this resort, however I do think there are better options within the price range. If you really value service and personal touches as long as a very nice beach, this may be the place for you.

1lcnt35,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenRelationships/comments/1lcnt35/my_boyfriend_called_me_stubborn/,My boyfriend called me stubborn.,"I asked my boyfriend to drive us an hour out to visit my family. On the way back home we stopped to get coffee I took out my card to pay. He said I got it and took his card out. I said no my treat. We were pushing each other's card until his was accepted. Then he said why are you so stubborn. I said no because I feel bad for him driving us/me an hour out to visit my family. 

I've been thinking about this all day. Is stubborn even the right word to describe this. Is this something deeper. I've heard men genuinely want to feel needed and useful in the relationship. Does something so simple as paying for my coffee make him genuinely happy. I've been a strong independent woman for a long time. Am I doing enough to make him feel needed. Should I be letting him pay for more stuff without a push back. I might be overthinking. ",0,1750063787.0,AskMenRelationships,1,0.5,False

1lcnrqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_Relationships/comments/1lcnrqg/aita_for_moaning_all_the_time_about_the_tiny/,"AITA for ""moaning"" all the time about the tiny things my partner does (or doesn't do) around the house?","Hi Reddit,

Please tell me if I'm genuinely losing the plot or if my boyfriend is living in an alternate universe where cutlery belongs crusty and unloved on the countertop and freshly cleaned carpets simply MUST be walked on with shoes.

So here‚Äôs the deal: I (F/36) have been with my partner (M/37) for ten years. TEN. A whole decade. He‚Äôs the love of my life, my best friend, dog-dad extraordinaire‚Ä¶ and also, somehow, an oblivious destroyer of domestic peace. We don‚Äôt live together full-time ‚Äî partly because it suits us better, and partly because we have very different standards of living. I clean. He, uh‚Ä¶ tidies? On a good day. Think: dusty shelves, questionable bathrooms, and a general air of ‚Äúthrow everything in a draw so we dont see it - this‚Äôll do‚Äù.

Recently, I‚Äôve been off work due to sickness, so I‚Äôve been staying at his place more. Which means I‚Äôve basically become a 1950s housewife (minus the gin and pearls). I‚Äôm talking cooking every meal, doing all the shopping (for BOTH of us, with my own money while still paying all bills for my own house), scrubbing floors, disinfecting every surface, and dog mumming both the pups like I‚Äôm training for Crufts, ensuring he's able to really focus on work (he usually takes the dog that stays with him to work but hasn't needed to hardly since me being here and that's helpful for him).

And look, I don‚Äôt mind being the homemaker while I‚Äôm here. I‚Äôve weirdly enjoyed it ‚Äî I‚Äôm in my ""cosy domestic goddess"" era. But it‚Äôs the complete and utter lack of effort and acknowledgement from him that‚Äôs started to make me feel less like a girlfriend and more like a live-in cleaner with romantic perks.

I ask small, reasonable things. Like:

‚ÄúPlease take your shoes off when you come in ‚Äì I‚Äôve been on my hands and knees scrubbing the carpets. We have two huskies. This is war.‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt leave your coffee spoon, still dripping, on the side. Just rinse it. That‚Äôs all. One rinse.‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease rinse your plate when you‚Äôre done eating that made from scratch, delicious homemade meal I've lovingly slaved over, so it doesn‚Äôt become a fossilised relic by morning.‚Äù


AND YET. I may as well be speaking to the dogs. Actually no, the dogs listen.

Speaking of which, when I first arrived, the garden was covered in dog poo. Two bags full I, ME, picked up. He hadn‚Äôt picked it up in who knows how long. Since I‚Äôve been here? He hasn‚Äôt picked up a single one. We have two dogs ‚Äî one each respectively stays with us usually, so it wasnt even like my girl had contributed to the foul mess. To compare, when my girl goes at home in the garden, I pick it up IMMEDIATELY as I can't stand the thought of it sitting on the grass rotting. Or me potentially forgetting where it is and then standing on it later. You get the gist.

So now, when I dare mention that I‚Äôd appreciate a spoon rinse or a respectful san-shoes house wander, I get hit with:

> ‚ÄúAll you do is moan.‚Äù



Excuse me? I have kindly requested, then gently reminded, and now yes ‚Äî I may be politely nagging ‚Äî because nothing changes.

I‚Äôve explained how EASY it would be to stop me moaning. Rinse the spoon. Pick up a poo. Respect the Hoovered carpet. I‚Äôm not asking for a grand gesture, just a crumb of consideration ‚Äî literally, ideally NOT left on the kitchen side.

And so now, I‚Äôm starting to resent him. And that‚Äôs hard to admit, because I DO love him. But it feels like he doesn‚Äôt care enough to make these teeny-tiny changes that would make me feel valued, and not just like his unpaid maid. If I matter to him ‚Äî if our relationship matters ‚Äî why does he let it come to this? Why does he choose to make us both feel shite (as most people will know, constantly asking for something and it falling on deaf ears feels awful. MEN OUT THERE, we don't ENJOY nagging!)

So Reddit‚Ä¶ AITA for moaning? Or am I just finally cracking under the weight of one too many dirty coffee spoons?

Any advice welcome ‚Äî bonus points if it includes how to train a grown man to rinse a plate. Like seriously, don't just tell me to dump him, it's not an option. But please do tell me which of us is the asshole and any actual advice on how to improve the situation, much appreciated.

Send help. Or bleach.

It felt like time folded in on itself, like I was a teenager again and nothing had changed. But the thing about dementia is that it's never linear. The memories come in waves, some real, some scrambled, and you never know what shore they'll wash up on. She was buttering toast when she paused, knife hovering over the bread, her eyes fixed on something far away.¬†

‚ÄúThey said he always came out at night,‚Äù she said softly. I looked up from my mug.¬†

‚ÄúWho does?‚Äù She didn't answer right away, just stared through the window like she was for something to appear in the trees.¬†

‚ÄúI heard it calling him‚Ä¶‚Äù She whispered ‚Äúlike a lullaby, sweet and sticky, and he followed it right into the dark‚Äù

¬†I didn't ask who he was.¬†

I didn't have to because I remembered.

2002 ‚Äì

It was Friday night. The one right after school had let out. We had a tradition that summer, dragging sleeping bags and pillows out into Ty‚Äôs backyard and pretending we were roughing it even though the back porch lot was still in view and his mom let us use the bathroom inside.¬†

The whole crew was there, Josh, Cody, Ty, Jules. Alex , Bradley and me.¬†

We stayed up too late, roasting marshmallows over the fire pit, telling each other increasingly wild stories about what we thought was living in the basement of the Langley house.¬†

The creature had names, powers even a back story. We built it together out of fear and bravado, each of us trying to one up the last.

¬†I think we all knew it wasn't real until it was.¬†

That night I woke up around 2:00 AM, the kind of wake up that slaps you in the chest with no dream attached.¬†

I had to pee, so I slipped out of my sleeping bag and crept to the far end of the yard where the grass turned into woods.¬†

And that's when I saw it.¬†

At first I thought it was just shadows playing tricks on me, but then I heard it. A voice, not loud, not clear, more like a melody, humming gently and syrupy and wrong.¬†

I stepped closer to the fence, heart thudding. That's when I saw the boy. He couldn't have been more than 9 or 10.¬†

I didn't know him, not really, but I'd seen him around the trailer park.

¬†He was barefoot in a T-shirt too big for him, staring straight ahead like he was sleepwalking.¬†

He was following the voice. I watched, frozen, as he crossed the street.¬†

The yellow porch lights of Briarwood Lane, flickering like dying fireflies.¬†

And walked around to the side of the Langley house, right to the basement door, And standing just beside it was something else.¬†

I couldn't see its face, just the shape. Tall, slouched, like it didn't know how to wear its skin properly. One arm was too long, the other hung limp like it had been broken and never healed, and its head‚Ä¶ it tilted to the side, twitching, watching the boy like he was a treat wrapped in tinfoil.

¬†The basement door creaked open. The boy disappeared inside. The thing followed him in. The door shut and I couldn't move.¬†

I don't remember falling asleep.¬†

I don't remember crawling back into my sleeping bag. But when I woke up, it was morning hot and bright and full of bees buzzing around the soda cans.¬†

And then the sirens started.

The police started searching for the boy early that morning.

¬†So we decided to roll up to the sheriff's station like we were on a mission from God.¬†

Bikes squealing, backpacks bouncing, Ty nearly crashing into the curb like an idiot.¬†

‚ÄúWatch it, Jackass!‚Äù Alex barked, swerving around him.¬†

‚ÄúIt's the brakes, OK?‚Äù Ty said, hopping off and letting his bike thud to the sidewalk.

¬†‚ÄúI told my mom to fix them.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou also told us your cousin was in Blink 182,‚Äù Jules muttered, pushing open the front door.¬†

Inside, the air was cold and smelled like stale coffee and whatever was rotting in the vending machine.

¬†Sheriff Barnes sat behind the counter, half the chicken biscuit in his hand and the other half in his mustache.¬†

He looked up with a grunt. ‚ÄúAnd what the hell is this?‚Äù

¬†Josh stepped forward; chest puffed out like he thought he was in an action movie.¬†

‚ÄúWe need to file a report‚Ä¶‚Äù

¬†Barnes raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúA report?‚Äù

‚Äú Yeah,‚Äù Ty said. ‚ÄúA missing kid report. You know, like for a kid that's missing.‚Äù

The sheriff dropped the biscuit on a napkin and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.

¬†‚ÄúJesus Christ, it's not even ten yet.‚Äù

‚ÄúDoesn't make the kid less missing,‚Äù Jules said.¬†

‚ÄúI saw him,‚Äù I said quickly, stepping in before things went completely sideways.¬†

‚ÄúLast night, he was going into the Langley house.‚Äù

¬†Barnes froze.¬†

Bradley shuffled his feet beside me, quiet as ever.¬†

‚ÄúIt was like, like something was leading him.‚Äù

¬†The room went quiet for a second, then Cody broke the silence.¬†

‚ÄúHe means like a monster, but like the bad kind, not the cookie Monster kind,‚Äù

Barnes sighed.

¬†Like he just aged 10 years in five seconds. ‚ÄúA monster? You all see it?‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúWe didn't all see it,‚Äù Josh admitted, scratching at the side of his neck.¬†

But he did, and we believe him.¬†

Alex crossed her arms, ‚ÄúBecause we're not morons. You think it's a coincidence another kid vanishes and it's always the same area?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt had long arms.‚Äù I said, staring at the worn-down patch on the desk.

¬†‚ÄúOne of them didn't move right, like it was broken and it was humming.‚Äù

¬†‚Äúhumming?‚Äù Barnes echoed.

¬†‚ÄúLike a song. I don't know,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúJust this low creepy noise, like, like cicadas, but in a person's throat.‚Äù

¬†Cody mimicked it, ‚Äúbuzzing like a bug.‚Äù

¬†Alex slapped his shoulder, ‚Äúnot helping.‚Äù

¬†The sheriff stood slowly and walked around the counter.

¬†His belt creaked; badge glinted under the fluorescence.¬†

He looked at each of us like we were a row of rusted out bicycles. He was about to toss in the trash.¬†

‚ÄúYou kids been watching scary movies again?‚Äù

Jules rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúOh my God‚Äù

‚Äúmaybe one with a spooky house. Monsters in the dark,‚Äù Barnes added. ‚ÄúMaybe aliens?‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúNo, Sir,‚Äù Bradley said. ‚Äúisn't a game.‚Äù

¬†Barnes let out a long sigh. ‚ÄúYou want my advice? Go home, stay out of that damn house, and stop stirring up trouble while the whole town's already on edge.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúBut I saw him,‚Äù I whispered, ‚Äúthe kid and that thing.‚Äù

¬†He stared at me for a long second, then turned around and headed back behind the desk.

¬†‚ÄúGo. I don't want to see you back in here unless there's blood on your shoes and someone's actually dead.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúWe could be dead next,‚Äù Josh muttered under his breath.¬†

Barnes didn't look up. ‚ÄúThen I guess I'll finally have peace and quiet around here.‚Äù

¬†We filed out slowly, defeated, the bell above the door jingling behind us.¬†

Outside, the sun was brutal, already baking the pavement hot enough to fry your soles.¬†

‚ÄúGreat,‚Äù Ty muttered, kicking at a crack in the sidewalk,¬†¬†‚ÄúThat went well.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúHe thinks we're making it up,‚Äù I said.¬†

‚ÄúOf course he does,‚Äù Jules replied. ‚ÄúBecause we're kids. Because if we said we saw a possum and a Tutu, he believed that before Monster and a murder house.‚Äù

¬†Josh spat in the dirt. ‚ÄúScrew it, we'll handle it ourselves.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúWe are not handling it ourselves,‚Äù Bradley said, eyes wide. ‚ÄúIt's literally a killing kids.‚Äù

¬†Alex snorted. ‚ÄúSo what, we just sit on our asses while it picks off kids like Pok√©mon cards?‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said. Turning toward the end of the block, where the Langley house sat like a scab on the neighborhood.¬†

‚ÄúWe're not sitting. We're watching, waiting.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúIf nobody else is going to stop this thing, then we will.‚Äù Josh finished.¬†

‚ÄúBecause that's what idiots do.‚Äù Cody grinned. ‚ÄúAnd we're the biggest idiots around.‚Äù

It was almost 1:00 AM when I checked on her. The house was quiet, too quiet, like the air had been sucked out of it.¬†

I patted softly to her door, my footsteps muffled by the old carpet.¬†

Her night light glowed faintly beside the dresser, casting warped shadows across the walls.¬†

She was curled in bed, barely more than a silhouette beneath the quilt my grandma made.¬†

Her breathing was shallow but steady, lips moving just slightly.¬†

‚ÄúMom.‚Äù I whispered, stepping closer. She didn't answer,¬†

but then, barely audible, she mumbled something slurred.¬†

Like a dream trying to breakthrough sleep,

‚ÄúThe boy. Didn't scream,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúJust walked down like the others.‚Äù¬†

A chill ran up my spine. I sat beside her bed and gently brushed the hair from her forehead. Her skin was cool, soft as paper.¬†

‚ÄúI miss you,‚Äù I whispered. Her eyes fluttered, and for just a second it felt like she was looking right at me, really seeing me.¬†

Then her gaze drifted past me again, unfocused. Just like that, she was gone again‚Ä¶

2002 ‚Äì

The plan was simple. We'd camp out in Jules backyard, where the fence had just enough of a gap to slip out if we needed. From there, we'd sneak around to the wooded hill behind the Langley house and keep watch. No flashlights, no talking, just eyes on the windows.¬†

Ty brought Pop Rocks and a can a Surge like he was preparing for a sugar fueled war.¬†

Alex had a Polaroid camera she swore could capture Ghost.¬†

Josh brought binoculars.¬†

Cody wore his ninja turtle pajamas for stealth and nobody had the heart to tell him otherwise.

¬†Bradley sat beside me in the grass. He didn't say much at first, he rarely did. But he handed me half melted Charleston Chew from his hoodie pocket and smiled.¬†

‚ÄúYou still like these?‚Äù He asked.¬†

I grinned. ‚ÄúOnly when I get them free.‚Äù He chuckled, eyes twinkling in the moonlight.¬†

‚ÄúSame.‚Äù

¬†Time dragged, the stars blinked overhead, and the woods were alive with cricket noise and the occasional distant owl.¬†

We passed around a bag of Doritos, whispering theories.¬†

‚ÄúOK.‚Äù Cody said, licking orange dust off his fingers. ‚ÄúWhat if it's not a monster, but like, an alien?‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúLike one of those Gray dudes.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúAliens don't hum like cicadas,‚Äù Ty whispered.

‚ÄúThat's like science.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúOh, yeah, you majoring in bug sounds at Harvard?‚Äù Alex snapped, earning a giggle from Jules.¬†

I leaned back in the grass, shoulder brushing Bradley‚Äôs. He didn't move away for a long minute.

¬†We just laid there in the dark, watching the Langley house like it was going to blink.¬†

‚ÄúI keep thinking about that kid,‚Äù I said softly, only loud enough for Bradley to hear.¬†

‚ÄúThe one I saw, the way he walked like he wanted to go.‚Äù Bradley looked over at me.¬†

‚ÄúYou think it messes with your head?‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúI think it already is.‚Äù¬†

He was quiet for a second, then he shifted slightly, his hand brushing mine, not by accident. ‚ÄúYou're brave,‚Äù he said.

I swallowed. ‚ÄúYou're the only one who ever says that.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúI mean it.‚Äù

¬†My heart thudded like a drum. The world felt so still. I turned toward him.¬†

We were close now, so close I could feel his breath.

¬†I didn't know if it was the night, the fear, the sweet smell of Charleston Chew between us, but I leaned in.¬†

So did he.¬†

We were about to kiss when‚Ä¶

¬†‚ÄúAhem.‚Äù¬†

We both jumped.¬†

Scrambling apart, Alex stood behind us, arms crossed, eyebrows raised.¬†

She didn't look mad, just amused.¬†

‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúDidn't mean to interrupt your romantic stakeout.‚Äù¬†

Bradley was red in the face.¬†

‚ÄúWe were just.‚Äù She waved it off, ‚Äúrelaxed. Romeo, I'm not your mom.‚Äù¬†

I looked at her, unsure what to say. She smiled softly, crouching beside me.¬†

‚ÄúYou're good, you know. Both of you,‚Äù

¬†‚Äúwhat do you mean?‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúI mean, it's OK to like someone even if it's not who other people expect.‚Äù

¬†I blinked.

¬†‚ÄúYou're not going to tell the others?‚Äù She snorted.¬†

‚ÄúPlease, like I care what Josh thinks.‚Äù¬†

Bradley let out a quiet laugh. Alex patted my shoulder.¬†

‚ÄúDon't worry dude, your secret crush is safe with me.‚Äù

¬†Before I could thank her, Jules hissed from the other side of the clearing

¬†‚Äúguys window. Look!‚Äù

¬†We scrambled into position, ducking low in the tall grass.¬†

The second story window of the Langley house was glowing faintly. No lamp, no TV, just that eerie, flickering yellow.¬†

Something moved behind the glass. It wasn't a person. It was too tall, too thin.¬†

Its body jerking like a puppet in water, the sound started again.¬†

Low, vibrating almost inside our skulls.¬†

That humming the same sound I heard that night with the boy. Bradley grabbed my hand.¬†

This time I didn't let go.¬†¬†

We watched it lurch across the 2nd floor, long limbs dangling at its sides, head to low like it was sniffing for something.¬†

Then it was gone.¬†

The light snapped off, and for a moment we were frozen,¬†

Josh whispered. ‚ÄúWhat the hell was that?‚Äù¬†

Ty clutched his arm. ‚ÄúDude, it's real. I told you it's real.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúShut up,‚Äù Alex hissed. ‚ÄúLook by the back door.‚Äù¬†

A shape emerged from the Langley house, tall and hunched, gliding across the back yard.¬†

Without a sound, even the wind seemed to hold its breath. It was heading towards the woods.¬†

No one said a word. We all just moved, crawling, crouching, cutting through Jules backyard and slipping under the fence gap like shadows.¬†

The woods were damp and heavy with the smell of pine and stagnant air, our shoes, crunched twigs and soggy leaves. Fireflies blinked in the distance, but it felt like even they were keeping their distance from what we were chasing.¬†

We followed the thing quietly, terrified but not stopping. Bradley stayed close to me, breathing fast.¬†

I could feel the tension in him, every step forward a silent dare.¬†

‚ÄúDo you see it?‚Äù Cody whispered, squinting into the dark there. Alex pointed through the trees, down a hill through the clearing was a lake.¬†

Not the nice kind where people fish or skip rocks.

¬†This was the forgotten kind.¬†

Marky still surrounded by cat tails and gnats.¬†

A patch of moonlight skimmed the surface, turning it into a silver bruise. The creature was there, kneeling by the water's edge, its back to us.¬†

It was doing something with its hands. Digging, washing.¬†

We crept closer, barely breathing. It dipped something into the water, something that made a wet slapping sound, something soft.

¬†And then it stood up, turned its head.¬†

We dropped to the ground instantly.¬†

Ty was shaking beside me, ‚ÄúDon't move. Don't even blink.‚Äù

¬†The thing paused, then melted back into the woods, vanishing between the trees.¬†

None of us said anything for a full minute, then Alex stood slowly, ‚ÄúWe have to see what it was doing.¬†

‚ÄúNo way,‚Äù Josh muttered, ‚ÄúI'm not getting eaten by Slender Man's cousin.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWe came this far,‚Äù she snapped.

¬†‚ÄúWhat if someone's hurt‚Äù¬†

that did it.

¬†One by one, we got to our feet and walked toward the edge of the lake, our flashlights off, only moonlight and fear guiding our steps.¬†

The first thing I noticed was the smell.¬†

Rot.¬†

An iron and pond scum.¬†

And then we saw it.

¬†Half submerged in the reeds.

¬†Torn open like a gutted deer.¬†

It was a boy, the one I saw, the one I tried to forget.¬†

His shirt was the same blue with yellow sleeves now soaked and stained.¬†

His mouth was open, eyes wide.¬†

His skin looked chewed. I backed away, bile rising in my throat.

¬†Jules screamed.¬†

Cody started crying. Josh just stood there whispering, ‚Äúno, no, no, no, no.‚Äù

¬†Bradley grabbed my shoulder, pulling me back, ‚ÄúWe need to go.‚Äù

¬†‚Äúwe have to tell someone,‚Äù Alex said, her voice shaking.¬†

‚ÄúWe did tell someone,‚Äù I muttered ‚Äúand he didn't believe us.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúThen we make him. We'll go to Sheriff Barnes in the morning,‚Äù Ty said. ‚ÄúBring him here.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWe can't wait,‚Äù I said.¬†

‚ÄúWhat if it moves him or eats him?‚Äù Cody whimpered.

¬†‚ÄúWe'll all go together,‚Äù Alex said.¬†

‚ÄúHe can't ignore all of us.‚Äù¬†

I looked down at the body one last time, and then up at the trees, at the dark. It was still out there, watching, waiting.

Present day ‚Äì

It was just after 10:00 AM when I stepped into her room.¬†

The curtains were drawn halfway, letting in that soft milky light that always made the dust look like snow.¬†

My mom was lying on her side, facing the window.¬†

Her breathing was slow, shallow, peaceful For once.¬†

I sat on the edge of the bed and brushed a strand of hair from her cheek.¬†

‚ÄúHey, Mom,‚Äù I said gently. She didn't answer. Sometimes she didn't. Other times, the things she said stuck in me like splinters.¬†

I reached for the bottle of pills on her night stand and started sorting out her dosage on the Monday morning compartment. Behind me, I heard her voice, soft, barely audible.¬†

‚ÄúHe still hungry,‚Äù She mumbled.¬†

I froze.

¬†Her eyes were still closed. ‚ÄúWho, Mom?‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúWho's hungry?‚Äù¬†

She didn't answer, just sighed and curled slightly tighter under her blanket like a child.

¬†I left the room with my heart pounding because I know exactly what she meant.

2002-

We met in Ty‚Äôs backyard just past the broken swing set and the plastic kiddie pool full of sand.¬†

Everyone was buzzing, tense.

¬†We hadn't slept after what we saw.¬†

Bradley paced like he was on trial. Alex had her arms crossed tight, jaw set like stone.¬†

Josh kept checking his watch even though it wasn't working.¬†

Jules hugged herself, eyes darting between the trees.¬†

‚ÄúWhere's Cody?‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúHe said he was coming to‚Äù¬†

¬†‚Äúhe probably overslept.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúHe's never late,‚Äù Bradley said. ‚ÄúNot when it's important.‚Äù

¬†Josh waved it off. ‚ÄúHe's probably raiding the pantry again. Let's just go.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúWe should wait.‚Äù I said ‚Äúwe shouldn't split up.‚Äù

¬†But the others were already walking.¬†

We headed toward town, cutting across the empty lot behind the gas station, past the sun, faded soda machines and the cluster of crows on the power lines that always seemed to be watching.¬†

Sheriff Barnes office was on main two doors down from the diner and just across from the old movie rental place. His cruiser was out front, lights off.¬†

The door creaked when we stepped inside. Sheriff Barnes looked up from behind his desk, eyes tired and lined. Like cracked leather. He raised an eyebrow.¬†

‚ÄúWhat now?‚Äù

¬†Alex stepped forward; shoulders squared. ‚ÄúWe saw it. The thing that's been taking the boys.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúWe saw it near the lake last night.‚Äù

¬†Barnes exhaled slowly.¬†

‚ÄúAlex‚Ä¶‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúI'm not joking. We saw it, and we found‚Ä¶‚Äù she swallowed. ‚ÄúWe found the body. Another kid by the lake.‚Äù

¬†He stared at her for a beat, then leaned back in his chair.

¬†‚ÄúYou kids have no idea what kind of trouble this could stir up.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúWe're telling the truth.‚Äù I said ‚Äúwe wouldn't come here unless‚Ä¶‚Äù

¬†the phone on his desk rang.

¬†Barnes picked it up, muttered a few words, then paused.¬†

His face went pale.¬†

His grip on the receiver tightened

‚Äúwhen‚Äù he asked.¬†

Another pause, then he hung up.¬†

He stood slowly.¬†

‚ÄúWhat's wrong?‚Äù Jules asked.¬†

The sheriff looked at us.¬†

‚ÄúCody Mendez,‚Äù He said ‚Äúhis mom just called. He never came home last night.‚Äù

¬†The world seemed to tilt between our feet.¬†

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Bradley whispered. ‚ÄúNo, he was just with us.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúHe said he'd meet us,‚Äù Jules said, voice trembling.¬†

Barnes grabbed his hat and keys.¬†

‚ÄúGet home, all of you. Now, this isn't a game anymore.‚Äù

¬†But we didn't move, because we already knew what he didn't. It had taken Cody too and now we were next‚Ä¶

We didn‚Äôt go home.

We scattered for show, ducked around the corner, and regrouped behind the Family Dollar.

Bradley‚Äôs eyes were red, fists clenched so tight his knuckles had gone white.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not gone,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not. Not until we see.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt even know where they‚Äôre looking,‚Äù Alex said, her voice low. ‚ÄúSheriff said to go home. He‚Äôll just write us off again.‚Äù

‚ÄúI got the walkies,‚Äù Ty said, holding up a pair of chunky black radios with duct tape on the sides. ‚ÄúOne‚Äôs on their channel. My brother used to work security‚Äîleft it behind when he moved. Still works.‚Äù

We all exchanged looks.

No one said no.

Ty handed one to Josh and clipped the other to his belt, flicking it on. Static hissed, then a voice crackled through.

‚Äú‚Ä¶deputy says they‚Äôre moving search efforts toward Ridge Quarry. Dogs caught a scent trail.‚Äù

‚ÄúQuarry,‚Äù I whispered. My stomach dropped.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs where they found the shoe,‚Äù Jules said. ‚ÄúLast week. By the fence.‚Äù

We moved fast‚Äîcutting through the brush behind the baseball field, then through the drainage tunnel beneath the highway. The summer sun was still heavy, but everything felt darker somehow.

By the time we got to the top of the quarry ridge, the police were already there.

We crouched low in the trees, hidden in the scrub, hearts hammering.

Sheriff Barnes stood near the edge of the water, his arms crossed, lips pressed into a grim line. A couple of deputies were knee-deep in the water, guiding something toward the shore.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Bradley whispered.

The shape was small. Lifeless.

A pair of red sneakers we all recognized.

Cody.

His body was bloated, his arms twisted strangely, like he‚Äôd been thrown or dropped from a height. His face was‚Ä¶ wrong. Bruised. Pale. One of the deputies covered it with a towel almost immediately.

Jules turned and buried her face in Alex‚Äôs shoulder, sobbing.

Ty dropped the walkie. The static hissed into the silence like a funeral dirge.

We stayed there, frozen. Watching them pull our friend from the quarry like a forgotten doll.

Sheriff Barnes rubbed a hand over his mouth. He looked wrecked. Not surprised. Just tired. Like someone who'd known this was coming all along.

I felt something splinter inside me.

This wasn‚Äôt a game.

Cody was dead.

It was real. It was hunting us.

And it wasn‚Äôt finished.

We didn‚Äôt speak as we walked back through the woods. It wasn‚Äôt the same silence as before. This one sat heavier, like wet clothes sticking to your skin. Like grief had shape and weight and could follow you home.

When we reached the clearing behind Ty‚Äôs trailer, we stopped.

No one moved.

Jules stepped forward and turned to face us. Her eyes were puffy, her voice raw.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do this,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúCody‚Äôs dead. You saw him. And we‚Äôre just kids, okay? We‚Äôre not detectives. We‚Äôre not‚Ä¶ heroes in some movie.‚Äù

Bradley started to say something, but she cut him off.

‚ÄúWe could be next.‚Äù

No one disagreed. Because she wasn‚Äôt wrong.

‚ÄúWe¬†*have*¬†to figure out what‚Äôs doing this,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWe¬†*know*¬†it‚Äôs not an animal. We¬†*know*¬†something‚Äôs out there, and Sheriff Barnes won‚Äôt listen to us. If we don‚Äôt do something, who‚Äôs next? Ty? Jules? One of¬†*us*?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù Jules said, her voice shaking. ‚ÄúI just want it to stop.‚Äù

Then she turned and walked away, disappearing down the hill toward her house. We didn‚Äôt follow.

Alex looked down at the dirt. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt blame her.‚Äù

Bradley ran a hand through his hair. ‚ÄúWe need a plan.‚Äù

Ty nodded. ‚ÄúTomorrow. Meet at my place. Noon.‚Äù

We all agreed. Quietly. Somberly. It didn‚Äôt feel brave. It felt desperate.

That night, I couldn‚Äôt sleep.

**Present Day-**

The attic was hotter than I remembered.

I came up here to look for the box of old summer clothes but got sidetracked by the smell of mothballs and old cardboard. The past has a smell, and up here it clung to everything.

That's when I saw it‚Äîan old plastic crate with peeling Ninja Turtles stickers on the side.

I opened it without thinking.

Inside were relics from a different world: a scratched¬†*Spider-Man*¬†VHS, a cracked yo-yo, a walkie talkie with the duct tape still on the antenna‚Ä¶ and a folded sheet of red paper.

I picked it up slowly. It was faded, creased. My throat tightened as I realized what it was.

A flyer.

**MISSING ‚Äì CODY SUTTON**  
Last seen July 15, 2002 ‚Äì Age 13 ‚Äì Red sneakers

I stared at it for a long time.

And then something under the flyer caught my eye‚Äîa Polaroid.

It was blurry, the edges browned from age. But there we were. All of us. Me, Ty, Bradley, Alex, Jules, Josh‚Ä¶ and Cody. We were all standing in front of Ty‚Äôs trailer, Cody‚Äôs arm around my shoulder, his grin toothy and wide.

My chest ached.

And then I remembered the next part.

The night after the quarry, I couldn‚Äôt sleep. I‚Äôd gone out to the back porch to get some air‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs when I saw it again.

The thing. The creature. Watching from the trees.

Only that time‚Äîit waved.

Ty‚Äôs front yard looked like a war room‚Äîspread-out bike helmets, empty slushie cups, and a wrinkled road map of Briarwood Lane weighed down with rocks. We‚Äôd been waiting almost half an hour before anyone said what we were all thinking.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not coming,‚Äù Alex muttered, kicking at a stick.

‚ÄúJules is just scared,‚Äù Bradley said. ‚ÄúWe all are.‚Äù

‚ÄúI say we go to her house,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúShe deserves to say no to our faces.‚Äù

Ty frowned but nodded. ‚ÄúYeah. Let's go.‚Äù

It wasn‚Äôt far. Everything in Briarwood Lane was within biking distance. The ride was short and quiet, the only sounds the click of gears and tires on gravel.

Jules lived in a small blue house near the end of Cedar Ridge, where the street dipped and the trees grew taller. Her older sister Savannah answered the door, leaning on the frame like she already knew why we were there. She was sixteen and didn‚Äôt hang with us, but everyone knew who she was‚Äîvarsity cheer, way too cool, and the girl all the boys crushed on but were too scared to talk to.

Except Cody. He used to call her ""Vanna Banana"" just to piss her off.

Her smile faded when she saw our faces. ‚ÄúI heard,‚Äù she said softly. ‚ÄúAbout Cody.‚Äù

Bradley nodded. ‚ÄúWe need to talk to Jules.‚Äù

Savannah hesitated, then stepped aside. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs in her room. Hasn‚Äôt really come out.‚Äù

The five of us stepped inside. It smelled like hairspray and vanilla lotion, the fan in the hallway humming a soft drone. Savannah led us to the door at the end of the hall and knocked gently.

‚ÄúJules,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúyour little friends are here.‚Äù

No answer.

‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù Savannah said, not unkindly. ‚ÄúThey came all this way, and they look like hell.‚Äù

Still silence.

‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre scared,‚Äù she added, ‚Äúbut you‚Äôve always been the brave one. You were the one who climbed the water tower first. You were the one who made me walk you to the Langley place when you were ten just to¬†*spit*¬†on the porch.‚Äù

Something shuffled inside. The door cracked open.

Jules stood there, eyes red, but her shoulders squared. ‚ÄúThis doesn‚Äôt mean I want to go,‚Äù she said, looking at me.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not asking you to,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBut I am asking you to help us stop this‚Ä¶ for Cody.‚Äù

Jules looked past us, then up at Savannah. ‚ÄúWill you come?‚Äù

Savannah blinked. ‚ÄúMe?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou always said I should stop being scared of things that go bump in the night,‚Äù Jules said. ‚ÄúSo let‚Äôs go see what‚Äôs making all the noise.‚Äù

Savannah looked surprised‚Äîbut then she smiled.

‚ÄúFine,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm not walking through the woods in flip flops.‚Äù

That night, Mom made spaghetti. The sauce was from a jar, the noodles a little too soft, but I didn‚Äôt care. We ate on the couch, plates balanced on paper towels instead of real napkins, the TV casting a bluish glow across the room.¬†*Back to the Future*¬†was on cable, and she quoted every line like it was scripture.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gonna see some serious shit,‚Äù she said with a grin, pointing at the screen just before the DeLorean took off. ‚ÄúClassic.‚Äù

I laughed, even though she‚Äôd said that same thing every time we watched it.

After dinner, she ran her fingers through my hair. ‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù she asked.

I shrugged. ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

She studied me for a moment. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been quiet lately.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ stuff with the guys. Weird summer.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre thirteen. It‚Äôs supposed to be weird.‚Äù

‚ÄúI guess.‚Äù

She nudged me. ‚ÄúHey. I know this house gets creepy sometimes. Especially at night. But you‚Äôre safe here, alright?‚Äù

‚ÄúI know.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou promise me something?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go chasing shadows just because the world feels dark. Not everything strange is worth finding.‚Äù

It was such a weird thing to say at the time, I didn‚Äôt think much of it. But now‚Ä¶ now I wonder if she already knew something. Something I didn‚Äôt.

The plan was simple: wait until she was asleep, sneak out the back door, and meet the others by the edge of Briarwood Lane. Ty had a flashlight. Josh brought the gloves. I brought nerves and a stomach full of half-digested spaghetti.

We met up under the busted old streetlight at the edge of the woods.

‚ÄúYou sure about this?‚Äù Alex asked. She had her hair tied back, and she looked serious, like she was going to war.

‚ÄúI need to see it,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWe all do.‚Äù

The Langley house loomed in the distance, half-hidden behind tall grass and overgrown trees. Its windows were still boarded up, the paint still peeling, the silence around it so deep it almost hurt to breathe.

Savannah, Jules, and Bradley hung back by the fence line, crouched behind some shrubs.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll keep watch,‚Äù Savannah whispered. ‚ÄúYell if anything happens.‚Äù

The four of us‚Äîme, Ty, Josh, and Alex‚Äîcrept along the side of the house. That‚Äôs when we saw it: a narrow opening along the bottom of the foundation, just big enough to crawl through.

‚ÄúThink it goes under the whole place?‚Äù Ty asked.

‚ÄúOnly one way to find out,‚Äù Alex said, already getting on her hands and knees.

Josh groaned. ‚ÄúGod, it smells like mildew and rat piss.‚Äù

‚ÄúShut up and move,‚Äù Alex hissed.

We crawled one by one under the house, the dirt cold against our palms. Cobwebs clung to our faces, and something skittered past Josh‚Äôs hand, making him curse under his breath. The beams above our heads were low and rotting, but we kept moving.

After what felt like forever, the crawlspace opened up into a dark, empty room. The air changed‚Äîcolder, like something lived here that wasn‚Äôt supposed to.

Ty‚Äôs flashlight flicked around the space.

There was a rusted furnace, a few crumpled beer cans, and something else‚Äîscratches along the floorboards, deep ones, like someone had been dragged.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like this,‚Äù Josh whispered.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre already in,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúMight as well keep going.‚Äù

We hadn‚Äôt even realized it yet.

We weren‚Äôt alone.

Inside the Langley House  
The air was thick and musty. It smelled like mold, rot, and something else‚Äîsomething sour, metallic. Like blood that had dried and gone sticky in the heat.

Ty‚Äôs flashlight cut through the gloom as we stepped out of the crawlspace and into what must‚Äôve once been a basement storage room.

There was a mattress in the corner, yellowed with age and stained in places I didn‚Äôt want to think about. Torn clothing was piled nearby‚Äîlittle shirts, socks, a shoe with a cartoon character printed on the side. A cracked baby monitor sat on a shelf, its red light still flickering faintly.

Josh picked something up and turned pale. ‚ÄúDude... this is a library card. For Trevor Hill.‚Äù

Alex turned her light toward the wall. ‚ÄúGuys‚Ä¶‚Äù

Scratched into the wood, over and over again, were the words:  
**‚ÄúMAKE IT QUIET. MAKE IT STOP. MAKE IT QUIET. MAKE IT STOP.‚Äù**

We were all frozen, breathing heavy, hearts pounding.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre alone,‚Äù I said.

And then‚Äî*creak.*

We all whipped around. Ty had wandered toward the stairwell.

‚ÄúTy,‚Äù Alex whispered. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing?!‚Äù

He turned back, shrugging. ‚ÄúWe gotta know where it goes. Maybe it leads up into the‚Äî‚Äù

A blur. A noise like a shriek and a hiss mashed together.

Then Ty was gone‚Äîripped off his feet by something dark and massive at the top of the stairs. He screamed as it dragged him halfway up the steps, flailing.

‚ÄúTY!‚Äù Josh yelled, lunging forward.

There was another horrible sound‚Äîbones crunching, wood snapping‚Äîand then Ty¬†*fell.*¬†Straight over the stairwell railing, landing hard on a broken beam jutting up from a pile of debris below. He didn‚Äôt scream again. Just gasped.

‚ÄúShit‚Äîshit‚Äîhe‚Äôs impaled‚Äî‚Äù I choked out.

Josh and I were at his side in seconds. Blood was bubbling from Ty‚Äôs mouth, and his eyes were wide with pain, but he was alive.

Alex shined the light up the stairs. The¬†*thing*¬†was still there, crouched in the shadows. Its eyes glowed faintly‚Äîreflecting back like a cat‚Äôs, but wrong. Too high. Too human.

‚ÄúWe gotta go NOW,‚Äù I shouted.

Josh nodded, grabbing Ty‚Äôs shoulders while I grabbed his legs. He was heavy and slick with blood. We half-dragged, half-carried him back toward the crawlspace, our hearts jackhammering.

The creature shrieked again and came pounding down the stairs‚Äîtoo fast, too loud, limbs hitting the walls like a spider made of meat and nightmares.

‚ÄúFASTER!‚Äù Alex screamed, holding the flashlight behind us to try and blind it.

We shoved Ty through the crawlspace first. He groaned, the piece of wood still stuck in his gut. Josh followed, pushing him, then Alex.

I was last.

I turned back just once‚Äîand it was¬†*right there.*¬†Not five feet away. Crawling fast, its limbs bending the wrong way, mouth too wide, eyes too dark. I scrambled backward through the dirt as it slammed into the crawlspace entrance, clawing, snarling‚Äîbut it was too big to fit.

It screamed like it was¬†*frustrated.*¬†Like it knew it missed its chance.

We didn‚Äôt stop until we were clear of the house, dragging Ty through the brush, all of us bloody and shaking. Savannah and Jules were already running toward us when they saw us burst out from under the porch.

‚ÄúWhat the hell happened?!‚Äù Savannah shouted.

Alex fell to her knees. ‚ÄúIt was real. It‚Äôs¬†*real.*‚Äù

Bradley ripped off his shirt and pressed it against Ty‚Äôs wound. ‚ÄúHe needs a hospital‚Äî*now.*‚Äù

Jules was pale, frozen in place.

We all were.

Because none of us could deny it anymore.

There was something evil in the Langley house.

Present Day-

My hands were trembling. I hadn‚Äôt thought about that night in years‚Äîmaybe I hadn‚Äôt¬†*let*¬†myself. The way Ty screamed, the weight of his body as we dragged him out, the sound of that¬†*thing*¬†slamming into the crawlspace wall.

I closed my eyes for a moment. Let the silence settle. Let my heart slow.

Then I reached for my laptop and opened Facebook.

The screen lit up, a quiet hum filling the room.

I didn‚Äôt even hesitate. I typed his name:

**Tyrell Carson.**

The page loaded.

There he was.

Profile picture from maybe last year‚Äîolder, beard now, heavier, a deep scar just visible along the side of his neck. But still him. Still Ty.

My chest tightened.

He had a wife, two kids, a life. Posts about barbecue Sundays, a little girl in dance class, a ‚ÄúHappy 10 years‚Äù post from his anniversary.

I stared at the screen for a long time before clicking¬†*Add Friend.*

The request sent.

A strange, aching calm settled over me.

I closed the laptop gently, careful like I was putting away something fragile.

Then I stood, shut off the light, and walked down the hall to my bedroom.

Mom was already asleep. I paused at her door, listened to the gentle rhythm of her breathing, and then moved on.

My bed creaked as I climbed in, the ceiling fan spinning lazily above me. The night outside was thick and quiet, the way it always is when something‚Äôs waiting just out of sight.

I stared up at the ceiling and whispered to myself, ‚ÄúYou were the last one, weren‚Äôt you?‚Äù

Then I closed my eyes and let the dark take me.

It started with the sound of cicadas.

Not soft or distant like usual‚Äîbut loud,¬†*screaming*, like they were inside my ears. Inside the¬†*walls*. The night pulsed with them.

In the dream, I was back under the house again, knees scraped raw from crawling across splintered wood and dirt. I could see the glow of Ty‚Äôs flashlight ahead, bouncing with each breath.

Then it flickered. Went out.

Something moved behind me.

I turned, and the crawlspace wasn‚Äôt a crawlspace anymore. It was endless. A long, yawning tunnel of wet breathing shadows. And from the dark, something with fingers like antlers and a mouth of teeth¬†*too wide*¬†crawled forward‚Äî

‚ÄúYou forgot about me?‚Äù

I woke up gasping, drenched in sweat. The ceiling fan spun lazily above, like it hadn‚Äôt just watched a monster lean over me in the dark.

I sat up. Rubbed my face. The house was quiet‚Äîtoo quiet. No humming from the baby monitor I kept near Mom‚Äôs room. No rustle of her sheets. Just that creeping silence.

Something in me snapped alert.

I got up.

Walked barefoot down the hallway, the old hardwood cold beneath my feet. Her door was open.

‚ÄúMom?‚Äù

No answer.

The bed was empty.

Panic hit my chest like a punch.

I checked the bathroom, the kitchen, even the backyard. Nothing.

Then I saw it‚Äîjust down the road, near the tree line, her figure in the pale orange wash of the streetlamp. Thin robe clutched tight, barefoot, her gray hair wild like seaweed in the wind.

I ran.

‚ÄúMom!‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt turn.

She kept walking, arms outstretched, muttering something too low to make out.

I reached her just as she stepped into the gravel shoulder.

She screamed.

‚ÄúMy son‚Äôs in there! He‚Äôs in there! It took him‚Äîoh god, it took my baby!‚Äù

‚ÄúMom,¬†*stop*! It‚Äôs me!‚Äù

She fought me, weakly pushing at my chest, eyes wide and wet with terror. ‚ÄúHe took him into the dark! It¬†*pulled*¬†him!‚Äù

‚Äú*Mom.*‚Äù

I grabbed her face, gently, firmly. Made her look at me.

‚Äú*I‚Äôm right here, okay? It‚Äôs me. I‚Äôm your son. I‚Äôm right here.***‚Äù**

For a second, she just stared.

Then her hands dropped, trembling.

Her lips quivered. ‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ oh, sweetheart‚Ä¶‚Äù she whispered, her whole body deflating like a balloon losing air.

‚ÄúI was so scared,‚Äù she said, softer now. ‚ÄúI heard you calling. I¬†*heard*¬†you.‚Äù

I nodded, swallowing the knot in my throat. ‚ÄúI know. But you‚Äôre safe now. Let‚Äôs go home.‚Äù

I wrapped an arm around her and walked her back down the road in the dark.

The stars above us didn‚Äôt blink. The wind didn‚Äôt blow. The night just watched us, quiet and still.

And in the silence, the cicadas hummed.",1,1750063585.0,u_TheNightAuditor1,0,1.0,False

Many services also offer repeat booking, ride history, and live location sharing with family. The shift to digital has made booking smarter than ever.

Unlike autos or public transport, today‚Äôs taxis prioritize clean, air-conditioned vehicles with cushioned seats and a noise-free environment. The focus is now on:

* Regular sanitization
* Comfortable legroom
* Luggage-friendly boot space
* Pet-friendly rides (with some services)

Whether you're commuting to work or heading out for a family trip, taxis make the ride relaxing and peaceful.

Budget plays a big role in daily travel choices. The good news? Coimbatore taxi services offer:

Green rides not only support the environment but also offer smoother, quieter, and more cost-effective journeys.

# 7. Available 24/7 ‚Äî Rain or Shine

Coimbatore‚Äôs weather can be unpredictable, and last-minute plans are part of everyday life. Taxi services are available round-the-clock to match this lifestyle.

Need a 4 AM ride to the airport? Done.  
Got a midnight movie plan with friends? Booked.

Taxis are reliable whether it‚Äôs a regular weekday or a festival weekend.

# 8. Local and Outstation Travel Made Easy

This flexibility makes taxis perfect for both city travel and weekend getaways.

# 9. Suitable for All Age Groups

* Doorstep assistance
* App-based or call-based booking
* Wheelchair-friendly options

‚Ä¶ make it accessible for everyone, including non-tech-savvy individuals.

The story focuses on a heightened, provocative buildup of sexual tension over 15 days, culminating in an explicit moment, set in the context of Ganesh living with his parents. The tone reflects Ann‚Äôs modern, bold style (leggings, jeans, crop tops) as described previously.



\---



\*\*Day 1: The Naughty Brush\*\*  

Ann, fresh into her marriage with Ganesh, knows his parents‚Äô watchful eyes limit their freedom. At dinner, she slides him a plate, her fingers lingering on his with a slow, teasing stroke. In tight leggings and a low-cut crop top, her curves are on full display, and she catches Ganesh‚Äôs eyes wandering. Later, sprawled on the couch, she stretches, her shirt riding up to flash her toned midriff, smirking as Ganesh shifts uncomfortably.



\*\*Day 2: The Dirty Whisper\*\*  

Ann ramps it up, leaning close in the kitchen while his mom chops vegetables. ‚ÄúBet you‚Äôre dying to see what‚Äôs under these jeans,‚Äù she whispers, her lips brushing his earlobe. She saunters off, her ass swaying in skin-tight denim, leaving Ganesh red-faced. That night, she does a slow yoga pose in a sports bra, bending just enough to make him choke on his water.



\*\*Day 3: The Sneaky Grab\*\*  

With his parents out for a morning errand, Ann corners Ganesh in the study, asking him to ‚Äúfix‚Äù her phone. As he leans in, she presses her tits against his arm, her breath hot on his neck. ‚ÄúOops, my bad,‚Äù she purrs, her hand grazing his thigh before she struts off in a fitted tank, leaving him hard and flustered.



\*\*Day 4: The Filthy Note\*\*  

Ann bombards Ganesh with spicy texts all day‚Äîphotos of her in a thong under her leggings, captioned, ‚ÄúThinking of you.‚Äù At home, she sits so close her thigh presses against his, her fingers slipping him a note under the table: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm wet just looking at you.‚Äù Ganesh shoves it in his pocket, his cock stirring as his parents drone on about the weather.



\*\*Day 5: The Slutty Dance\*\*  

Ann cranks up her seduction with a dance. Blasting a sultry track, she grinds to the beat in a crop top and leggings that hug her ass like a second skin. She winks at Ganesh, pulling him into a quick twerk against him. His hands graze her hips before she pulls away, laughing, leaving him aching and half-hard.



\*\*Day 6: The Bedtime Tease\*\*  

In their shared room, Ann slides closer on the bed, her skimpy sleep shorts barely covering her. ‚ÄúEver wonder how I taste?‚Äù she murmurs, her fingers trailing down his chest, stopping just above his waistband. She rolls away with a wicked grin, leaving Ganesh throbbing under the sheets, unable to sleep.



\*\*Day 7: The Raunchy Game\*\*  

After dinner, Ann challenges Ganesh to a card game, leaning over in a tight sweater that shows off her cleavage. ‚ÄúLoser strips,‚Äù she teases, loud enough for only him to hear. When she wins, she grinds against him in a victory hug, her hips pressing into his growing bulge, his parents oblivious across the room.



\*\*Day 8: The Under-the-Blanket Play\*\*  

During a family movie, Ann throws a blanket over their laps. Her hand slips beneath, stroking his thigh, inching toward his crotch before pulling back. In her hoodie and jeans, she plays innocent, but her sly grin says she knows he‚Äôs rock-hard, struggling to stay composed.



\*\*Day 9: The Breakfast Tease\*\*  

Ann cooks Ganesh‚Äôs favorite breakfast in a sports bra and leggings, her nipples faintly visible through the fabric. As she leans over to pour his coffee, she ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù brushes her chest against his arm, her scent driving him wild. His parents‚Äô chatter barely registers as he fixates on her body.



\*\*Day 10: The Shower Flash\*\*  

Ganesh steps out of the shower, towel low on his hips, when Ann ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù barges in. ‚ÄúFuck, you‚Äôre hot like that,‚Äù she says, eyeing his bare chest and the outline under his towel. In her workout shorts, she lingers before leaving, smirking as he grips the sink, aroused and rattled.



\*\*Day 11: The Garden Grind\*\*  

On an evening walk in the garden, Ann wears a tight dress that clings to every curve. She presses her body against his, whispering, ‚ÄúI want you to fuck me under these stars.‚Äù Her hand grazes his ass, and she laughs softly, leaving him burning with need as they head back inside.



\*\*Day 12: The Wet Tease\*\*  

While washing dishes, Ann splashes water on herself, her soaked crop top clinging to her tits. ‚ÄúHelp me dry off,‚Äù she purrs, pulling Ganesh close, her hips grinding against his crotch for a fleeting moment. His parents‚Äô voices nearby force her to stop, but his erection betrays his hunger.



\*\*Day 13: The Midnight Dirty Talk\*\*  

Late at night, Ann whispers filth in bed, her hand sliding under his shirt. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so wet thinking about your cock,‚Äù she breathes, her fingers teasing his waistband before retreating. In her tiny sleep tee, she‚Äôs a vision, leaving Ganesh jerking awake with lust he can‚Äôt shake.



\*\*Day 14: The Breaking Edge\*\*  

At a family gathering, Ann‚Äôs in a dress that screams sex, her curves impossible to ignore. She brushes her ass against Ganesh‚Äôs groin while passing by, whispering, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not wearing panties.‚Äù His restraint crumbles, his eyes dark with want. She squeezes his hand goodnight, knowing he‚Äôs hers.



\*\*Day 15: The Raw Release\*\*  

With his parents gone for the night, Ann takes control. In a thong and a barely-there crop top, she blasts a sultry beat and grinds on Ganesh, her ass against his throbbing cock. ‚ÄúFuck me now,‚Äù she demands, kissing him hard. They stumble to the bedroom, clothes ripped off in a frenzy. Ann rides him wildly on the bed, her moans echoing as they fuck with pent-up desperation, their bodies slick and frenzied, finally unleashing 15 days of raw, filthy desire.

Over the past couple of months, I‚Äôve been working on a side project called **Gifty**. It started from a simple question:  
**What if ads weren‚Äôt annoying, but actually fun?**

We noticed how most people ignore digital ads, while small local shops struggle to get noticed online. So we‚Äôre experimenting with a playful idea: turn advertising into a real-world **treasure hunt**.

With Gifty, you open a map in your browser and walk to real locations to unlock surprise rewards ‚Äî like free coffee, discounts, or small perks dropped by local businesses. No installs, no spam, just a reason to explore your city again.

It will be in the process of upgrading to a LMLM-R as well, and I will be buying the LM/Acaia scale. So don't base opinion on value without GBW as that will be a given.

Everyone can make a point that based on specs, where the Atom clearly outshines the Pico. It's not even a competition. That is why I want to hear from owners or someone who considered both.

I am drinking light to medium roasts only, skewing (heavily) towards light.

1. Does the Pico grind well?
2. Will it be an improvement from Specialita?
3. Is it loud? I think the Specialita is, or maybe only mine as everyone else seems to deem it quiet (never owned a Sette though, so maybe that's why).
4. How does the GBW portafilter holder work?
5. is the dosing cup included in the package? The one they use for all advertising.
6. Does it work well as ""set and forget"" for a household producing 2-5 double shots of espresso on most days with the exceptional parties where it will be more?

I have liked the Specialita so far, but I have read a lot (here) about how flat burr grinders need more continuous dial-in and also noticed that I need to turn a bit here and there every day almost. Also I tend to weigh out the PF every time because the grind by time is quite unstable in terms of weighed output. I do not want to purge 2g of coffee in the bin every time I have not ground coffee for a few hours as it misleads how well the grind size (and thereby timer when not GBW) is set.

6) Those of you who went for Atom or something else - why did you not take the Pico after all?

I don't have many friends here, so I am very ready to meet up for coffee and have an in-person conversation.

It was very close and I thought I found her, but I will never give up on searching for my soulmate, so here goes again.

I'm seeking a true bashert forever relationship with a female who sincerely believes in the concept that only one man is made perfectly for one woman. 

I'm not cool, not rich, not a tough guy, however I have been told I'm extremely handsome, and look good for my age, but I'm just me. I don't find the typical shidduchim techniques to be all that accurate. I'm Ashkenaz, and feel a Sephardic woman might match me best, but I'm open to all backgrounds. I'm a caring, passionate, hard-nosed American Jew who treats women like they are G-d's gift to humanity, but who hasn't been on a date in years, I have however been studying the Soncino versions of the Torah, Talmud, and Midrash for as long as I can remember and I daven all the time, but I'm open to any level of observance. I'm 6'2 and enjoy exercising, weight lifting, and eating healthy. However, once I find the neshamah that is the yin to my yang, her appearance will make no difference to me as she will be the definition of woman kind in my eyes and any insecurities that she may have will be what I cherish the most as my goal in life will be to constantly uplifted her through dedication, loyalty, and affection. I feel that my strengths will be my soulmate's weaknesses and my weaknesses will be my soulmate's strengths. I am open to a woman who values family and would like to start one of my own. I will never give up on finding the Sarah to my Abraham. And since Sarah was 10 years younger than Abraham, I feel that someone around 36 will be a good fit. So, if a life-long relationship is what you are seeking, I am here looking forward to giving you all of my love, dedication, and loyality exclusively for a lifetime.

I'm open to living in Japan as I have my own place there, the US, or in Israel since I have dual citizenship. As long as you're Jewish in some way, that's all than I could ask for. And merging our last names together without a hyphen will be our way of telling the world our souls have become one.

If you're able to speak Hebrew fluently or at least at a high school level that is one of the strengths that I lack. So if you find me interesting, private message me, explain your perfect man, and if you describe me, you may have just found your bashert. Thank you!",2,1750062764.0,r4rjewish,0,1.0,False

Firstly, I want to say, to every woman/man/or whatever you feel like. Don‚Äôt ever trust a stranger as my stupid dumbass self did. I also felt like I had some 6th sense for people and I just know what they are like.

  
So just for ""my story"" I met a guy online he was like 19, pretty good looking guy, very funny, cute, and also very attentive, we were texting for like a month, never actually told each other where we are both living, until one day, when he just casually said that he lives in ""my area"", I also shared my info, and we wrote to each other that we could meet up for some coffee and have a nice day together, since we were really enjoying ourselves in chatting and stuff. We both arrived to the Starbies and got a coffee together, we were really hitting the right notes together, everything was so nice and then my naive ass got invited by him to go for a movie to his house (he lived with his parents but they weren‚Äôt home) So I thought to myself why not, everything seems safe.. We walked to his home and chilled there for like 30minutes until we picked a movie.. We were like 20-30minutes into the movie and then he started touching me everywhere.. I can‚Äôt barely remember the rest, my brain probably just forgot everything to keep me alive. Right now I‚Äôm trying to find some help in some sweet words and not just words from my family that I‚Äôm very stupid for what I have done and stuff like that. Hopefully this will go UP for more people to see and once more girls and boys..

That‚Äôs right. If your ‚Ç¨1,500 device magically disappears on its way back, you‚Äôre just out of luck. Their terms literally say they ‚Äúwill not be held responsible in case of lost parcel.‚Äù Corporate poetry.

‚Äì **You pay the return shipping yourself.**

Even if the product was defective out of the box. Even if the encoder fell off into your coffee. You want a refund? Start calculating postage.

‚Äì **They can reject your return at will, or slap a fee on it.**

‚Äì **You can‚Äôt even send the product in unless they explicitly approve it.**

You‚Äôre not allowed to mail them anything until you beg for permission and receive sacred instructions. Without that? They can refuse delivery. Like it‚Äôs some artisanal record label in 1972.

At some point during the chaos of early parenthood, I became obsessed with sling bags. They‚Äôre easier than backpacks, harder to forget on a bench as you don‚Äôt really have to take them off, and let me pretend I still care about aesthetics while I‚Äôm wiping yogurt off a toddler‚Äôs face.

I now own nine of them (for now, will probably add more). Some were impulse buys. Some were long-considered decisions. All have been field-tested during snack emergencies, playground negotiations, and the occasional solo coffee run.

Derek Guy once pointed out that three Japanese brands consistently stand out for quality‚ÄîMaster‚ÄëPiece, Porter Yoshida, and Briefing USA. That rang true for me too, and I wanted to review all three across multiple bags. The Trophy Clothing Bag is just a unique little add-on for a less tactical or tacti-cool look, definitely more for rugged outfits.¬†

I‚Äôll go through them one by one, with a quick pro/con list and a few notes.

**1. Porter Waist Bag (made in Japan)**

Pros:

* Classic Porter build quality‚Äîdurable, lightweight
* Surprisingly roomy for a waist bag
* Stylish and I love the sage colour

Cons:

* Strap runs short; sits quite high if worn as a sling
* Not technically a sling, so doesn‚Äôt sit or carry like one
* The high-shine nylon becomes dull with wear

**2. Porter Yoshida Tanker Travel Case (Made in Japan)**

Pros:

* Super slim and lightweight
* Great for minimal days or passport-wallet-phone runs
* Signature Tanker series finish always looks good

Cons:

* No real closure or zip for the centre slot; phone can slip right through
* Not ideal for active use‚Äîfeels more like a pouch than a bag
* Best as an auxiliary carry rather than a standalone solution

**3. BRIEFING Fusion Comp One (Made in Japan)**

Pros:

* Lightweight, with just enough compartments
* Water-resistant 1680-denier ballistic nylon is tough as nails
* Leather details add a premium feel

Cons:

* Sturdy like a brick but also as heavier than you‚Äôd think
* Zippers are slightly stiff out of the box (they do loosen)

**4. BRIEFING Tripod (Made in USA)**

Pros:

* Small but extremely well made
* Rugged mil-spec construction - nearly indestructible
* Very minimalist, versatile in styling
* The 1050-denier ballistic nylon ages nicely

Cons:

* No external pocket, which limits quick access
* Could use better internal organisation

**5. BRIEFING Moduleware Master Pod (Made in China)**

Pros:

* Massive capacity for a sling
* Tough build, very lightweight despite the size
* Inner mesh pockets and smart dividers = life-saver with kids
* Great balance of utility and everyday wear

Cons:

* If not packed full, contents bounce around
* Made in China, didn‚Äôt love that at first but quality is very good
* Can look bulky depending on your frame

**6. BRIEFING Day Tripper (Made in USA)**

Pros:

* Excellent internal structure, stays upright, easy access
* Very comfortable strap and carry profile
* Incredibly roomy despite its compact size
* One of the best zipper experiences‚Äîsmooth and reliable

Cons:

* On the larger side for a sling, can feel like a mini messenger
* Heavy! 

**7. Trophy Clothing Horsehide Day Trip Bag (made in Japan)**

Pros:

* Beautiful leather‚Äîpatinas with every outing
* Very sturdy, holds its shape
* Excellent Japanese construction¬†

Cons:

* The YKK zipper is a sturdy beast‚Äîdefinitely not smooth
* Weight adds up quickly, even when empty
* Not weatherproof at all

**8. Master-Piece Lightning Sling Bag (made in Japan)**

Pros:

* Stylish and modern with **great** hardware
* Strap can switch sides, nice for ergonomics
* Feels ‚Äúpremium‚Äù in hand

Cons:

* Stains very easily (mine caught a wall, never recovered)
* Capacity doesn‚Äôt match the footprint, deceptively shallow
* Hard to access on the go; layout isn‚Äôt intuitive

**9. Master-Piece Lightning Waist Bag (made in japan)**

Pros:

* Sleek, clean design
* Minimal bulk, disappears under a jacket
* Nice for short trips or going out

Cons:

* Tiny. Really only fits a phone, keys, and lipstick
* My wife has claimed it and shows no signs of returning it
* Not suited to real-life dad stuff



**Final Thoughts**

I genuinely like all of these bags, each one has its moment depending on the day, the weather, or what kind of chaos I‚Äôm walking into (apart from the small Master-Piece sling bag which was too small for my frame). But if I had to be honest, I find myself reaching for the Master-Pod and the Day Tripper the most. Probably because of their roomy, clever design, they just make sense when you‚Äôre juggling errands, snacks, and a rogue toy dinosaur.

Look, none of these brands are cheap and I‚Äôm not going to pretend they are. If pure functionality is your only concern, you can absolutely find something more affordable that gets the job done. But what you‚Äôre paying for here is the build, the design, and the details that make using them feel‚Ä¶ good. Like they were actually made by someone who thought about how they‚Äôd be used. And on that front, I‚Äôm really happy with every single one of them.",28,1750062561.0,ManyBaggers,4,0.92,False

[MODS for the sake of fair judgement please approve this post!],"For those of you who have been active on the discord community, you might be aware that it has been deactivated and all channels have been deleted or made private, this community has been established during or even before covid and had lots and lots of active members, the admin, Mehul Ved, at this time chose not to moderate the community and completely left it alone, despite that the community continuted to grow. 

Important information was exchanged, MULTIPLE foreign group buys were organized where people easily accessed amazing UL profile coffees from various top foreign roasters for a negligible price, think MCC but cheaper. Throughout this his participation was NILL, absolutely zero. 

Fast forward to this month and the community was suddenly disabled. Noone understands why, when the admin was asked to transfer ownership but he immediately denied, it is apparent why he denied, he clearly wants people to think he built the community himself but in reality he had nothing to do with community building!!. 

He has now moved to whatsapp and is continuing to harm the community there, please dont encourage such type of people!

  
Attached: Bunch of screenshots to show what an absolute nuisance he is!

  
NOW despite all of this, he has the gall to advertise on TOI, behaving as if he nurtured and created the community meanwhile he contributed for barely anything!!

1lcngwc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1lcngwc/ghost_at_work_keeps_messing_with_me/,Ghost at work keeps messing with me,"I own a business and we moved into our current building just over a year ago. My business partner nicknamed the ghost Charlie and I recently told her that I won‚Äôt be calling it that anymore because I don‚Äôt think it likes that. 

It used to be little things like things falling out of nowhere or things going missing when we‚Äôre gone. It was almost silly that we were attributing these things to a ghost.

Well, I work in our space alone into the night often and lately, I feel like it‚Äôs picking on me? I know that sounds stupid, but hear me out lol. Nothing it is doing is harmful, it‚Äôs just things that freak me out momentarily as if it‚Äôs the ghost of a teenage boy and it thinks jump scares are peak comedy. 

I was making a pot of coffee, and the basket of grounds suddenly slid out of the machine. I was working on something in the kitchen with the back door locked, and the push bar for the door made the loud sound that it makes when you slam into it. We were closing up shop, and I heard someone scream ‚Äúhelp‚Äù but no one else heard it. Idk, maybe I AM just losing my mind, but I feel like it‚Äôs a ghost literally pranking me.

1lcncc2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lcncc2,More Than Just Comedy,"I used to work backstage at those variety shows back in the 90s in Japan. It was always a bit of a chaotic scene, lots of noise, bright lights, and the ever-present smell of hairspray and cheap stage makeup. My job was just moving props, but honestly, I spent most of my time watching the comedians. And Downtown, well, they were a show even when they weren't on camera.

This one morning, I was grabbing a quick coffee near the dressing rooms. It was early, but the energy was already building. I saw Matsumoto first, standing at the mirror. He was wearing some big, dark patterned shirt that was common back then, and those wider, light-colored pants. His hair, all spiky, was perfectly in place, and he was meticulously checking it, like a general inspecting his troops.

Hamada was there too, of course. He was humming some off-key tune, just sort of pacing, running a comb through his permed hair. I heard him mumble something about his ""premium hair tonic,"" probably just to get a rise out of Matsumoto. And Matsumoto, without even looking up, shot back with a dry remark about Hamada's originality. They just had that constant back-and-forth, even when they weren't mic'd. Hamada then went for the obvious: ""Your hair looks like you got electrocuted by a fashion magazine."" Matsumoto's reply was equally pointed ‚Äì something about Hamada's hair looking like a poodle. Just a normal morning for them.

Then the door creaked open, and Yamasaki shuffled in. The poor guy always seemed a bit overwhelmed. He had on this pastel windbreaker, a kind of cheap, shiny material that was in style then, but on him, it just looked a bit sad. And his hair was the big problem. It was supposed to be spiky, I think, but it was just drooping, completely lifeless. He sighed, putting down a tiny, almost empty tube of hair gel. It barely had anything left.",5,1750061833.0,GakiNoTsukai,0,0.86,False
1lcnbxj,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicIllness/comments/1lcnbxj/hospital_stay_tips_from_a_veteran_inpatient/,Hospital Stay tips (from a veteran inpatient),"Just wanted to share a list of what I have found to be an absolute godsend when going into hospital, be it 1 night or 100.

1. Pillow. Your own pillow. Hospital pillows are AWFUL! Put this at the top of your list, will make sleeping considerably easier and more comfortable. Trust me on this...
2. Squash/cordial. Water is BLOODY boring day after day. 
3. Snacks. Most hospitals will have a basic shop or a vending machine. But they won't cater for your particular nibble. Biscuits, crisps. No nuts though. You will be mixing with a lot of people, some of which have allergies. Just the whiff of a peanut will set off someone's anaphylaxis. 
4. Personal hygiene extras. Your hospital will have soap and water and cloths. They won't have a razor, scissors or combs/hairbrushes. Don't worry about how you smell whilst in, so don't worry too much about your perfumed shower gel or shampoo.
5. Charging multiplug. Gadgets take various cables. You will likely only have access to only 1 plug, so make use of it with a multi USB plug.
6. USB Fan. This is a must. You may be poorly and may have a temperature so a fan is just an absolute must. Even if you don't have a temp. You will find hospitals are stifling places. You will thank me.
7. Headphones. Get a pair of headphones or earbuds. Something you can wire up or connect to your phone. You will need entertainment during your stay. 
8. Audio books. This will drown out the evening beeps and boops and snoring and shouting and rattling of trolleys and help you sleep or even pass the time.
9. Takeaway. Make sure you know what takeaways serve the hospital. Ask the staff who they order from and how it is delivered. Hospital food sucks, but you can order out, no matter what they say. You are not a prisoner.
10. Loose clothing. Wear loose clothing that is easy to pull up. You will be prodded and poked your entire stay, so having your areas easily accessible will make life more comfortable. Say goodbye to dignity. You are poorly, dignity is a secondary thought. 
11. Jewellery chain. Nothing fancy, but something you can string your rings and bracelet onto and wear round your neck. Keep them safe.
12. List of medication. Have this handy. If you are diabetic, note the time you take insulin. Your meds should follow your pattern.
13. Notepad and pen. You will be given a lot of information, you might have questions to ask. You might need a way of communicating other than speech. A notepad and pen will serve you very well.
14. Salt and Pepper. All I will say is flavour matters. Shakers or sachets. Either is good. Thank me later.
15. Marmite/favourite toast topper. Breakfasts are VERY basic on NHS wards. Cereal and toast. Nothing else.
16. Teabags/coffee. Hospital tea and coffee is abysmal. Bring your own.

This is a survival kit. Hospitals are not pleasant, but with this survival kit, it will be a lot easier to manage. I have told this to MANY people who I have passed in my wards. They often look at me as if I am an alien when I bring it all out. But I can tell you, I'm the one who is laying in comfort in between treatments whilst they are all bored stuff or paying extortionate amounts for basic television!! üòÇ
