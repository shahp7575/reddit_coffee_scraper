1ivjfko,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1ivjfko/the_craziest_thing_ive_ever_done/,The craziest thing I've ever done," Apparently this was too long to comment on a previous post so I'm writing it here.


I had moved to Daytona with a friend and met a gorgeous girl who left her boyfriend to move in with me. And we got an apartment that apparently was a meth lab for the previous tenants. They had someone kick in the door with a shotgun, killed them, and take their shit... we didn't find this out until later. We moved in and cleaned the apartment and scrubbed god knows what off the walls. We hooked my biker friend up with this cute chicken we had met, and my friend from my hometown moved in this girl he had met online. We also allowed this guy to crash in the garage who was like a 30 year old burn out. After we cleaned the house, we had a party where we  enjoyed Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds. I told my new girlfriend about my hometown and how I was sad that I had a nephew that had been born that I didn't get to meet because I was in Florida. She decides we should take time off work and road trip back to my hometown in New York. 

From that acid induced idea followed the craziest (and arguably best) week of my young life. We packed up and left my biker friend in charge while we invited my friend from my hometown to come with us. He kept bugging us about driving so when my girlfriend got tired around Maryland he finally got his wish and hopped in the driver seat. We were immediately pulled over because he drives like an asshole. The cops find my girls few grams of pot and have her dump it out, and then search my friends bag... and find all the ""goodies"" he had bought to take home and share with our hometown friends. He is arrested after he admits it is all his, and was found in his bag. He had bought ""red rock opium"" and an oz of weed he kept in an oversized grinder, as well as several tiny bags of some much better weed. We go to the place the cops took him and get told we would need bail money. We decide that because we are broke we will drive up to his mom in NY beg for bail money and get him on the way back down. We drive to New York. 

She was following signs for new York so we ended up in NYC of course. At this point it's like 2am in the morning. We had been driving all day and we had been stopped by the cops for hours while my friend was arrested. We were still tired from the housewarming party and tripping so we were exhausted. We get to a toll booth and ask directions write down what we were told and drive... and we end up driving around NYC to very bad directions. We get to where the directions told us to go... and it's another toll booth. We ask this new guy for directions and drive... he gave us directions back to the first toll booth. Apparently these guys get a laugh sending tourists back and forth to each other. We drive back to the second toll booth again and just keep going. Eventually we end up kinda close to my hometown. My girlfriend can't drive anymore and let's me drive the rest of the way now that I knew where I was and how to get to where we were going. I had no license at the time but I drove anyway. The sun came up on us and I pulled into town by my grandmother's house. I pull in and suprise her morning coffee routine with a big hug and tell her some of the story of driving getting stopped, getting lost, getting sent back and forth between tollbooth workers and she let's us crash in her guest room. We get up like 8 hours later. Spend some time with my grandmother. Walk next door to see my great grandmother who is surprised and happy to see me, then take off to find my friends mom to get bail. We meet up with her. She explains that she spoke to my friend and he is taking a bus up to NY. He is pissed we left him in Maryland.

My friend got arrested for the ""red rock opium"" and the state troopers thought they had a slam dunk conviction. They tested the ""red rock opium"" and find out it's not drugs. My friend had been scammed buying the stuff, and it wasn't drugs. It was probably some kind of incense. They can't keep him on a few tiny bags of pot they confiscated from his bag. They didn't know what the huge grinder was and left it in his bag full of an oz of weed, unknown to any of us. They release him from jail, but apparently lost his shoes when they booked him. (Probably some kind of retaliation for them wasting time trying to get him.) So he is stuck in Maryland where he doesn't know anyone, can't find us, has no money or shoes. He walks into a convenience store and asks the guy for two cartons of cigarettes. When the guy turns his back he steals a disposable camera off the counter and when the guy turns around he says ""shit I forgot my wallet I'll be right back"" turns and leaves the store. He then walks until he finds some young kids and convinces them that he can make them fake ID for $50 but he needs $20 up front. He walks them to a white wall takes their picture with the camera. And says he has to develop their film and make the ID he will meet them at the spot he took the picture at noon tomorrow. Then finds some more young kids and repeats the process. He uses the whole camera and makes enough money to buy a bus ticket and a pack of cigarettes. Still barefoot, he makes the journey to our hometown.

So we are in NY I meet my nephew and take my girlfriend to all my favorite places and I produce her to my friends. My friend meets up with us at our mutual friends house. He tells us how he escaped Maryland, goes through his bag and finds his oz of weed still in the giant grinder. We smoke a blunt and we get a phone call from our biker friend. The landlord is pissed we let the 30 year old burn out crash in the apartment because he is apparently selling drugs out of our garage, and he is not on the lease. She is kicking us out and we have to move all of our stuff within the next three days. There is a clause in our lease that she can cancel our lease in the first 30 days, but if we get out in three days she will give us back our deposit, Instead of calling the cops. We say our goodbyes and our friend Matt says something to the effect of ""damn i really wanted to come visit you guys in Daytona and see what it is like down there, you guys have so many wild stories."" So we throw him in the car with us and start driving back to Florida. We had spent less than 24 hours in NY. 

On our way back down to Florida we got stopped twice in 20 minutes by police who gave my Girlfriend a ticket for a loud exhaust. We drove down the coast and saw the Chesapeake Bay Bridge we skirted around Maryland and returned to Daytona. We found out that the 30 year old burn out had a party in our house, moved all of our belongings around, and most of them were missing. We also found out that my friends motorcycle, a Honda CBR had been stolen. The Burn out had also abandoned the house to crash at our other friend ""Blind Tony's"" house. He apparently had the cops show up repeatedly at our house and wanted to go somewhere to lie low. He had moved my girlfriends vanity into the garage, stolen all of the light bulbs from our rooms as well as my friends hidden lock box. He had been on a drug fueled bender since we left. Everyone who had been supposed to watch the house for us had left to get away from his high antics. We suspect he had ""sold"" my friends motorcycle to pay for his 3 day drug spree. He had also found and broke i to my friends locked box with a few hundred dollars in it. We cleaned the mess. On a hunch, I went I to the attic crawl space and found something much of our personal stuff crammed in the rafters. Apparently, it had been stashed there with the hopes of coming back to get it later. It was mostly keepsakes, photos, old tarot cards, a wooden statue, and notebooks. I don't know why he thought he could sell them.  We got a Uhaul and packed up our stuff. My friend loaded his truck with the stuff from him and his girlfriend. Along with his fish tanks half filled and with the fish still in them. My Girlfriend and I decided we would stay with her mom in West Virginia. We took more acid as a goodbye party and my friend Matt almost got lost going to the local convenience store. He swore he wasn't tripping and the acid didn't do anything to him, but he did a cryp walk on my friends truck (on the roof) then went to the store... and hour later we went to go look for him. We searched every switchback cull de sac looking for him, until i spotted him laying on the sidewalk a block from our apartment. He still swore the acid didn't do anything to him. The next day after we had slept and packed and planned and said goodbye as we loaded up to go to west Virginia and my friends went back to NY. They said the last thing they were going to do was go find the 30 year old burn out. 

The last thing we did before we left Daytona was go to the Wendy's on International Boulevard and LPGA for food before we hit the road. I realized this is where the burn out said he worked. I asked the manager if he worked there. He said yes and that he had called out sick for 4 days straight and was supposed to come back that night for a shift or lose his job. I informed the manager that he should just fire him, because he was not sick he had stolen thousands of dollars of property to pay for several straight days of doing drugs and that he was probably getting his ass kicked at that very moment. The manager said he didn't need problems at his restaurant, I just told him that we wouldn't bring problems to him, that we were just letting him know he had to find someone to cover the shift. That the burn out would only bring problems to his doorstep, and that he had cost us our place to live. The manager seemed like he appreciated us confirming his suspicion and gave us a bunch of free food for the road. We left Florida during a beutiful and dramatic sunset that was so beautiful. I remember it 20 years later. We headed to West Virginia 

It had been about a week since our acid trip decision to road trip to New York. We had her car on a tow behind the Uhaul filled with everything we had salvaged from our apartment. We drove over the New River Gorge Bridge and ended our trek at her mom's house in West Virginia right on the Potomac by Cumberland. We had spent more time driving than sleeping over the past week. We had driven thousands of miles and ended a chapter of our lives because of an ill thought out decision. We had a ton of fun along the way. We had seen some beautiful country crossed 3 of the best bridges in the United States. The Chesapeake Bay Bridge, the Brooklyn Bridge, and the New River Gorge Bridge. We had gotten really good with paper maps after getting lost. We had eaten in so many great roadside dives. We had slept in the Uhaul and awoke to a great sunrise in a Hardee's parking lot. I was the only boyfriend of hers to meet both her dad in Daytona and her mom in West Virginia. She was the last girlfriend to meet my great-grandmother. We grew very close over the trip. It felt like we spent a year together over that week. We saw every side of each other. We had managed crazy stress and exhaustion, we had acted like little kids, tripped to the edge of sanity, been handcuffed, made serious adult decisions, and fucked like bunnies every chance we got. 

I will never have a week like that again. I would be too afraid to try. I had lost and gained so much. Twenty years later I am sure there was more that I am forgetting among all the crazy highlights. It started with a decision to throw a party and ended with us broke and jobless in her mom's hot tub soothing our exhaustion aching muscles, and our sleep deprived minds. It would take us a week to absorb everything that had happened and the New reality we found ourselves in.

I wouldn't trade those memories for the world.",1,1740233061.0,stories,0,1.0,False
1ivjffi,https://www.reddit.com/r/diet/comments/1ivjffi/full_fat_dairy_grassfed_butter_oatmilk_is/,Full fat dairy? Grassfed butter? Oatmilk? Is anything safe to eat anymore?,"I've been reading and hearing a lot about full fat vs. non fat dairy products for health and want to know what I should be stocking in my fridge.

My husband and I have been trying to pursue a Mediterranean diet to trim belly fat and improve cholesterol levels- leaner meats (including grass fed beef), more variety in veggies, more protein from beans and whole grains, etc. What i love about this diet is I still get to eat cheese and other dairy products. I'm getting conflicting information in my research on buying nonfat to keep fat intake low (but this increases the amount the food is processed and may add artificial sugar to keep it ""healthy"") and buying full fat dairy (which I'm reading and hearing is better for maintaining nervous system health [anxiety/depression here] and improving satiety to keep you full longer- but obviously, adds to saturated fat intake). I love to cook but recently feel like nothing I cook is ""safe"".

I mix in oatmilk with coffee/lattes because I like the taste. My husband was raised on skim milk from infancy to now so that is what we keep in the house, along with half and half for coffee. I want to use 2% or whole milk in cooking if that's ""safe"". Also is there a difference with grass fed milk and butter? It's overwhelming and confusing, despite 2 high levels of biological and health education in our household.

Background.
My husband is 35 and gained weight after finishing his PhD program...probably 30-40 pounds or so. 5'9 and 225 ...huge belly now. He looks completely different from when we were dating and has all the early signs of metabolic disease- hypertension, obesity, and high cholesterol. I started really getting on him about making diet changes...there's a history of diabetes in his family, and he works a sedentary stressful job in sales. A lot of weight came on from making poor choices when he started traveling for work in what food he was getting. I guess doubling your salary does that. He was big on calorie counting instead of looking at the actual composition of the food. We're working on understsnding food choices and self motivated exercise habits. He's picked up tennis 2-3x a week but, no change yet in weight. Now he wants a high protein diet which i'm just hearing as expensive if you want meat that's ""safe"".

I also graduated from grad school 6 years ago and shot up from 120lbs. Im 30 years old, a little under 5 feet tall and 130 pounds 🤢 the heaviest I've ever been and its all around my waist and thighs. I moved from high normal into the overweight BMI category and I don't like the way I look in my clothes despite recently sizing up. I know I have to exercise 2-4x per week, increase water intake, and reduce stress to change the way I look and thats coming (I'm only averaging 2500 steps per day at my very stressful job on my feet). My parents are both significantly overweight and I've managed to be the only thin one in my family staying at 115-120 for most of my early adulthood with an active lifestyle. We're also trying to conceive so I'm very aware that everything that i do with my body affects my fertility and ability to carry a baby. As if the stress of work and my weight wasn't enough. I avoid mirrors, but when I look in one I hate what I see at my waistline. I think of the carbs and cheese that I like to eat and just think ""of course you look the way you do you piece of garbage you're doing it all completely wrong and it's going to kill you and your husband, you dont deserve a baby you'll mess it up too.""

I'm genuinely terrified of being overweight and overwhelmed at everything I'm going to have to change immediately to keep this from getting worse, so I want to make the best choices possible. Any PRODUCTIVE help is encouraged.",1,1740233050.0,diet,1,1.0,False

A last-minute decision to take a break made me realize that sometimes, stepping away is exactly what you need to move forward.



It’s 6 am. My alarm clock rings abruptly, but I am already awake. I bounce out of bed, walk to the bathroom, and start my mechanically engineered routine for maximum productivity.

My body feels loose, but strong.

I look at myself in the mirror like a soldier ready to go to war.

Today’s gonna be good.

I pour myself a cup of steaming black coffee, move to my computer, and take a look at the calendar for today.

Everything is planned and ready to go.

I interlock my fingers, and crack my knuckles out in front of me, and set a timer for my first deep work session today.

I am locked in.

After the first hour, I take a look at my phone that is sitting on the desk in front of me. It’s on do not disturb (obviously) to make sure I am in control.

My stomach drops, I take a small gasp.

I totally forgot about this…

My friend texted me reminding me about an even that I agreed to. 

I totally forgot to put that in the calendar.

I feel the pressure rise in my chest and neck. My throat tenses up and I can barely swallow.

What do I do?

I grew up in a family that glorified a sport that I hated. And they were also REALLY good at that sport. It’s kind of like a family tradition.

All my life I have been made fun of, or told backhanded compliments meant to make me quit whatever I was doing and follow suit.

So obviously as an online entrepreneur living in South America (my family is Canadian) I am as far from the little ball of sunshine I was supposed to be.

Now my goals are personal.

Like a stiff “f-you” to everyone that doubted me.

And I also lost a massive contract with work recently and am in the middle of a rebuild. So I only have a certain amount of money to survive and that money is going faster than I predicted.

“I can’t go.” I say to my friend, trying to sound regretful.

“But you promised.” She replies, while a twinge of guilt stabs me in the stomach.

I pause. 

“One day is going to matter right?” I think to myself. “You’ve been working hard for the last 2 weeks straight.” I follow up. My inner salesman in full swing.

“Ok fine let’s go.” I say.

“Yaaay.” She says enthusiastically. “Let’s meet at the park at 3.” 

I toss some clean clothes on, and head over to meet her. 

During the event, I can’t take my mind off of work. Every time I pull out my debit card to buy something I can see my bank account dwindling.

Losing my apartment, no food, living on the streets,

My mind can be pretty cruel sometimes.

“Lighten up.” My friend says. “You’re being boring.”

“Am I?” I respond curiously. As if I don’t deep down know what I am doing.

“Yes. just have some fun for a bit.” She responds, grabbing my hand and pulling me towards the music.

The event lasts about 4 hours and by the end of it, I feel pretty good. I have let go of work and let myself have some fun.

I get home, toss the keys on the counter, and fall into bed. My body feels numb from exhaustion. My brain feels fuzzy.

I wake up, 6am.

I crack a smile, look out the window, and the world seems full of possibilities. 

The air in the room feels like pure oxygen. Clean and smooth.

I am ready.

I jump out of bed, clean myself up, and get to work.

I am a content creator and today is script writing day.

I blast open the notes tab, turn on my favourite focus music and wait for the stream of endless inspiration to hit me.

Nothing.

I grab a cup of coffee. Maybe a cup of Joe will help the brain get going.

Still nothing.

I begin to get worried. 

The air turns to thick sludge as it enters my lungs. The room feels like someone turned up the thermostat.

I start to ruminate again.

My breaths get shallower and shallower until finally,

“Enough.” I say to myself. “Just write whatever. It doesn’t have to be good.”

I start slow, not really liking what I am making. My brain is split between feeling bad for myself, and working.

I can’t catch the flow.

An hour passes, and I take a look at what I have done so far.

I hate it. But I’ll keep it anyway.

I decide to take a walk and breathe. This room has started to feel like a prison.

As I walk the streets of Colombia, breathing the fresh air, feeling the sun lightly kiss my neck and face, I start to release some tension.

After all, I HAVE been working well for the last few weeks.

“Everyone has bad days.” I say to myself trying to pump myself up.

“I guess all we can do is roll with the punches.” ",1,1740232961.0,stories,0,1.0,False

So all that to say, they have discontinued the Mocha. I've tried for months to find it online or in store, but it just says out of stock. Can anyone suggest a good, inexpensive, nonbitter mocha coffee? I am drinking my last cup that I've been saving for weeks, and I'm more sad than what is probably appropriate.

What I liked and disliked,"Came here last Sunday from Mumbai to spend my 3rd wedding anniversary quietly with my wife and now leaving tomorrow. Here is my review:

Likes:
1. Weather: Absolutely loved the winter. I am originally from Delhi so I used to miss winters in Mumbai. This brought memories back!

2. Food: Tried nepali, chinese, tibet and Bengali food and have no complaints.

3. Hotel: I stayed in a suite of a hotel with lovely views and great hospitality. Can DM the details to anyone interested.

4. Vibe: I and my wife used to just sit at chowrasta for an hour, sipping tea, strolling, and taking in the slow vibes which is a stark contrast to what we see in Mumbai.

5. Glenerys: Needs separate appreciation. I went there 6 out of 7 days. Bakery items, fresh coffee, conversation, and a nice cool winter. Heaven!

6. People: Soft spoken, well behaved, helpful. Made me feel at home.

 Needs Improvement:
1. Infrastructure : A lot of infrastructure is falling apart. Darjeeling has the potential to overthrow a lot of tourist destinations but fails. Over that there are open drains, falling wires, litter, which can be changed

2. Shopping Experience: For a hill station, jackets and winter clothing is quite expensive. Shimla, Nainital, and even Delhi had cheaper alternatives. The really cheap ones are not worth wearing. Over that, the sellers seem to not care much and a lot of shops close by 7:30 PM. May be it’s just the winter but I am not used to shops closing so early. 😅

3. Cabs: I have got so many quotes for the sightseeing packages that I am not even sure if I got ripped off or made a deal. For local Darjeeling I was quoted 3500 by the hotel 3200 in Mall road, 3000 from a travel agency and 1500 from a cab driver on the road. I opted with the agency as 1500 seemed too low. For the Mirik trip, the same agency quoted 4000 but hotel quoted 3500. For Bagdogra drop, I got quoted 3000 by the hotel, 2300 by the agency for a small car, 2800 by a local driver. My point is I am still confused about who is quoting me the most 😅. I know nothing is “right” price and not complaining about it being expensive or cheap but consistency helps. 

Overall loved it and made a lot of nice memories! Would love to visit again.",2,1740232809.0,DarjeelingCity,0,1.0,False

Secondary objective: Lose body fat—I'm genetically wired to store both visceral and subcutaneous fat on my belly, which is both not ideal health-wise, and just plain looks weird proportionally to the rest of my body, with a smaller chest and thin arms. However, in the past year of working out and adjusting nutrition I've only managed to lose a single kilogram :(

Not a concern: ""Bulking""/substantial muscle volume gain.

Restraints: Three (3) available slots—one longer, during the weekend (~2 hrs), and two before work, ~30-40 minutes. No reliably available timeslots after work on weekdays.

I (late 20s, F) currently do a semi-split. I tried to do PPL, but couldn't quite make it fit with the time I have available.

Weekend slot: Legs/full body focusing on compound and barbell exercises (deadlifts, squats, leg press, leg extensions, hamstring curls, barbell chest press, barbell shoulder press).

The other two: Isolation for arms (machine shoulder press, pulley tricep extensions, bicep curls), chest (chest press machine, flys), glutes (bridges, hip thrusts, hip adduction & abduction), and core (body weight ab exercises—crunches, planks, leg raises).

If I'm not super dead and a timeslot frees up, I'll do something fun and not too intense one of the otherwise rest days, as active restitution: swim, boulder, or go for a run. I hit 10k+ steps every day and take the stairs to my 6th floor apartment.

Nutrition-wise, I'm usually at a ~200 calorie deficit, with one or two maintenance days a week as I'm much more liable to experience health-related obstacles (fainting, etc.—I have a low blood pressure issue) when at a deficit over time. I don't quite hit my protein goal (generic 1 g per kg) every day, but if I don't, I get close to it. I only drink alcohol at New Years, I'm close to fully cutting out sugar, and eat low carb, but not no-carb. I limit oils and other fats (as suggested by someone on here, works well for me), but tend to choose small amounts of full-fat (milk in my coffee, for example) over ultraprocessed low-fat alternatives.

What would you tweak, prioritize, add, remove, or fully change, if you were me?

1ivj4ob,https://www.reddit.com/r/JimmyJoyFood/comments/1ivj4ob/review_of_flavours_after_3_months/,Review of flavours after 3 months,"I have been drinking Plenny Shake for more than 3 months now. I did not tried this kind of food substitution before, so I have no reference and I did not what to expect.

My main purpose of deciding to order Plenny Shakes was to have something for breakfast that you can prepare quickly and not have to plan day before or think too much of what you need to take to work to eat. Also, that it is a complete meal with nutritients and vitamins and prebiotics. I have some kind of IBS problem, so I was hoping that it would also be easy on my bowels, as it is liquid.

**Consistency**: it is just right. Some flavours get thicker faster and that is also tasty. I feel more satiated when it is thicker though.

**Feeling satiated:** when I mix it with water, I am hungry already after 1-1,5h. It tastes better and I feel less hungry when I mix it with milk - for me usually lactose free milk or soya milk. Surprisingly, it tastes the best with soya milk. The flavours come out more. With milk I am not hungry for 4-5h.

My first flavors were: wild berries, speculoos, coffee and pistachio.

* **Wild berries**: what surprised me was how barely noticeable was that flavour. In terms of ""intensity"" if I would have to rate from 1 to 10 it was 2. I don't say I don't like it - it is good when you do not feel like having something more distinctive.
* **Speculoos:** it was okay. I did not feel speculoos per se, it could be called cinammon flavour for me. What I do not like about it is how sandy this specific flavour is. It is really like mixed with sand for me, I could feel it between my teeth. My housemate likes it though.
* **Pistachios:** I actually really liked this flavour. It tastes like melted pistachio ice cream (not ""real pistachio ice cream"", but the green one, ifkwim), sometimes more like almond flavour though, but overal is nice and I like it.
* **Coffee:** what a disappointment! I usually like coffee flavoured things, but this doesn't taste like coffee at all. If I might say, I would say it is disgusting. I really do not like it. My housemates tries to finish the batch (it's been 3 months lol) mixing it with speculos or vanilla. But even when he drinks it I feel the smell of it and I hate it.

I decided to try another flavours, checking what others recommend: I ordered banana (because everyone said it was good), lemon pie (I was sceptical, because I really do not like taste of lemon in desserts), coconut (because I wanted to try it), strawberry (I was curious how it compares to wild berries):

* **Banana**: it was really good! It doesn't taste artificial, but really like riped bananas. It is the one that gets thick the quickest.
* **Lemon Pie:** I was so glad I ordered it! It is the best flavour. First time I tasted it, it remind me something from my childhood, but I am not sure what. Anyway, after my first Lemon Pie shake I kept of thinking about it and had to make another one, because I really wanted it again.
* **Coconut:** In the beginning, I liked it. It reminded me of Rafaello. But later I noticed that I do not want to make it that often. It is kind of... cloying and ""heavy"" that makes me not to drink it that often.
* **Strawberry:** it is nice. Like a strawberry milkshake, but light flavor. I like it when I do not want to drink anything with much flavour.

When I was re-ordering I tried also vanilla.

* **Vanilla:** it tastes like vanilla pudding. Not bad, but also not very special. But what I discovered, what makes vanilla special is that if you mix one spoon of vanilla with other flavour - it makes other flavour stand out more/tastier. For example - it made wild berries more distinctive and even tastier.

I make this summary, because maybe it will help some people, like it helped me when I was deciding if it's worth it and which flavours to pick.

SUMMARY:  
\- I am drinking it with milk, because it tastes way better than with water and I am feeling more satiated  
\- Soya milk works the best for me  
\- Lemon Pie is addictive!  
\- Vanilla flavour mixed with other flavours makes some other flavours taste better.",3,1740232169.0,JimmyJoyFood,0,1.0,False

This is the most recent case I've ever covered)

Unfortunately, we know little about [Maarten Dickhoff](https://imgur.com/2gTiESc)'s background other than that he was born in 1979 or 1980. He lived in the Dutch town of Alphen aan den Rijn for approximately 25 years. He worked as a tiler specializing in small, high-quality jobs. In 2017, he decided to start his own tiling business. The business was successful, and he had no debts and was close with his family. Everyone said that he would always help others when needed and never found himself involved in any trouble.

On January 23, 2024, he decided to take a short trip. He left the Netherlands and drove to the coastal city of Ostend, Belgium. At 11:15 p.m., he checked into the Andromeda Hotel, a luxury hotel. [After arriving at the hotel](https://imgur.com/Jv6LpR6), he went to the [Casino-Kursaal](https://imgur.com/7JbWI32), also in Ostend. At 12:30 a.m. on January 24, the casino's [CCTV cameras captured him putting on his coat and heading outside](https://imgur.com/zUULUBj). 

Judging by his demeanor on the footage, he seemed restless and spent more time speaking on his phone then playing the slot machines. 

Nobody knows where he went next as the cameras from the surrounding area failed to capture them. Eventually, he did return to the Hotel and at 4:00 a.m. CCTV cameras from the hotel captured his van exiting the underground parking garage. While he did leave the hotel, he didn't check out

The last time Maarten was seen was at 4:52 a.m. [CCTV cameras at an Esso gas station in Drongen](https://imgur.com/VL1m06i), also in Belgium captured him filling up the gas tank and buying a coffee. Maarten was alone and nothing seemed odd or unusual about him. He then drove off. 

On January 25, Maarten's family back in the Netherlands contacted their local police to report Maarten missing after a client complained about him being late.  

After asking about his last known whereabouts, the Dutch police quickly realized that while he did go missing in Belgium, he had visited the casino twice. After his first visit he turned around and drove back to The Netherlands to fill up his gas tank in Gouda at 7:12 p.m. Then he got a coffee from McDonald's. 

Afterwards, he drove back to Belgium to go back to the casino for the second time. The second trip to the casino is the one where he went missing afterward. The Dutch police quickly contacted their Belgian counterparts, thus initiating a joint investigation. 

While Maarten was last seen at the gas station, the police were thankfully able to track his movements using his cell phone and the vehicle's onboard computer. At 4:09 a.m., he left Ostend and drove towards Antwerp and later took a route that would bring him to Rotterdam, Netherlands. On the way, he stopped for coffee at the Gas Station in Drongen. 

He drove toward Antwerp before turning North on the R4 highway toward Ghent and its port. At around 5:16 a.m. near Wondelgem, he abruptly switched off his phone. The police could still trace the car via its console, CCTV and witnesses. 

His van was seen driving toward driving towards the Dutch border near Zelzate before abruptly turning around and driving into Belgium right before reaching the border. Afterward, his van couldn't be tracked any further. The police's takeaway from this was that he never made it back to The Netherlands so the Belgian police would be conducting the bulk of the investigation. 

[Here is a map of his route](https://imgur.com/Ud4xfoI)

On February 26, the police in Aalter, Belgium, a town 45 kilometres away from Ostend [found Maarten's Black Volkswagen Transporter Van](https://imgur.com/o4MV2qS)[ in a parking lot](https://imgur.com/pFJqCqp) close to the E40 highway. The parking lot was that of a Fastned charging station which was odd because Maarten's vehicle wasn't electric. 

The police had found the vehicle earlier but didn't think much of it as Maarten had yet to be reported missing. The reason the police knew this was because an officer had left a parking ticket. The ticket revealed that the van had been parked there since 6:05 a.m. on January 24. The police felt it an odd place for someone who had never been to the area to go. 

The parking lot was also located close to Aalter's weekly market so they thought the vendors may have seen Maarten or whoever parked the car while setting up shop. Sadly nobody saw anything that could aid in their investigation. The police then went to the local hotels to see if Maarten checked in or If anyone saw them. Next, the police questioned those who also went to the parking lot to charge their electric vehicles. None of them saw Maarten either. 

As for the vehicle itself, it was spotless for the most part. Inside the vehicle, the police found no sign of Maarten and his valuables like his wallet which contained a large number of Euros, his expensive iPhone, keys and passport were missing. What officers did find was a small suitcase. Inside the suitcase were Maarten's clothes, neatly folded. 

The police tried to obtain dashcam footage from the locals and those who shared Maarten's route so they could shed light on Maarten's last known activities. Even with an appeal for those in the area to come forward with their dashcam footage, they were left with no new leads.

The police's two theories are that Maarten either took his own life and ensured he wouldn't be found, or that somebody had killed him, possibly road rage or gambling debts due to the casino. 

The police do not have enough evidence to push one theory over the other and are now, one year after his disappearance, at a loss. Their exact words, ""That's a mystery to us, as far as we know, there is no one who knew Maarten around here.""

They were what I expected cos I was eating the standard western diet. I'm 30kg overweight, drank a lot in my past and still do now and again but not since going carnivore.

My cholesterol was pretty bad, 8.5mmol/L with my LDL at 6.2mmol/L and HDL at 1.0mmol/L

My triglycerides were 3mmol/L, my Hb1Ac was 42mmol/L and my fasting glucose was 5.7mmol/L

All in all NOT GOOD. And the doc to no one's surprise gave me statin meds which I didn't fill (even though he kept encouraging me).

All I'm eating (mostly) is steak and eggs (1.5kg of red meat a day on average) and I'll sometimes eat chicken, pork, lamb or fish when I get bored. I also eat A LOT of butter and will also sometimes use tallow. I will occasionally eat Greek Yoghurt and will also eat cheese with my ground beef as my body can handle dairy. I also drink black coffee.

I'm getting another blood test done in 6 weeks and then I'll get another one done at 13 weeks.

I am wondering what the blood work looked like at 1, 2 and 3 month mark?

Would anyone care to share theirs?

I'm asking honestly cos I am a little anxious at the amount of fat and cholesterol I am eating at the moment.

I FEEL great and my joints don't hurt anymore but I know that it'll be a while before my body actually heals properly.

I am scheduled for 13 trays, weekly changes and virtual monitoring. My teeth are almost perfectly straight already but my reason for doing Invisalign was to close a relatively minor open bite that developed over the last 15 years or so since my last orthodontics. I really just want to get into the retainers so I can be done wearing a night guard and have something more low profile at night vs my old night guard. I was also told Invisalign could improve snoring, clinching, grinding and potentially help with mild sleep apnea. 

Here are some questions I had: 

I was told I’d be done after these 13 trays unless I didn’t like the results then I could keep going. So basically 3 months…I was expecting like 12 months. I am super glad to hear that, but is that realistic? Anyone finish that soon? 

How strict is the 22 hours of wearing? Once I heard my dentist tell me such a short time of wearing, I have been almost neurotic about getting 22 hours in. Guzzling down my coffee in the morning, night time tea, eating fast, snacking less, trying to stick to 3 meals only (which is hard for me) I usually eat small amounts often…been making these changes all in hopes of being done in the 3 months they said. Am I over doing this? I’ve read online places say 20-22 hours a day is the suggested time. That would be MUCH easier requirement and alleviate pressure I feel I am putting on myself maybe unjustly.

For those who used insurance. Did your dental insurance send you reimbursement checks for the covered portion? Or did they send to your dentist? How many payments did they send during treatment, or was it lump sum AFTER treatment was completed? ",2,1740231480.0,Invisalign,0,1.0,False

I wouldn’t call it full recovery either, if not just harm reduction, however this is the most life I’ve had in ages. I decided to start weight training again, something I was incredibly passionate about for the health benefits pre ED. This week I took one of the last chance new years offers at my local gym for a membership and decided enough is enough; I’m getting my life back. Since Tuesday, I’ve been able to delete MFP and stop tracking cold turkey, eat 3 square high protein nutrient dense meals a day+ whatever I desire throughout. It’s freeing. I had a coffee and baileys at a hockey game last night for the first time in 8 years nearly. I went out for sushi with my partner and ordered a stupid amount of my favourite-salmon sashimi. I ditched the small spoons and plates and just eat the whole container of full fat yogurt with a normal spoon (two big tubs per day this week) and I honestly feel amazing. My body is already responding to it and I couldn’t be happier. I finally feel a little like me again. I’ve got a long way to go, but right now I can say i have no intention of backing down. I mean,  rationally what is the point of weight training to build mass if you don’t have the fuel to repair it? And that’s what echoes in my head. even past that, life is too fucking short to sit and log your energy intake on an app to come to an exact measurement. Hell I didn’t even realize how much time I spent on that damn app until deleting it, how anxious it made me knowing I could double check and replan everything I consume. The hardest part was hitting the delete button and once I ate one meal untracked, I kinda forgot it was even a thing. 

I’ve still got a long way to go in terms of repair and recovery in every aspect. But no one said this was fast and easy.

Maybe it helps especially those who tried different medication before. I’ll list my side effects and positive effects below as well. 

I’m w33 and got diagnosed with adhd ca. 2 years ago. Ever since I tried several medications: Ritalin, Elvanse, Intuniv and now Atomoxetin (Strattera as a brand is not available in my country).
Stimulants gave me bad side effects, especially sweating, increased heart rate and anxiety. 
Intuniv could have been a good option but lowered my heart rate too much, so that I could not keep increasing the dose.

I started Atomoxetin on 40mg for ca. 6 weeks, then 50 mg for ca. 4 weeks and am now on 80 mg since 4weeks.
This is the first medication that actually makes a difference while having manageable side effects.  

Side effects:

- started taking it in the evening at first
- restless sleep, waking up super often and had really vivid dreams. This disappeared when I switched to taking it in the morning
- first time I had the worst nausea and threw up after 2 hours of taking my first pill
- switched to taking it right before breakfast, only in the beginning a bit nausea which is fully gone by now
- vivid dreams came back when I upped to 80mg but disappeared after ca. a week of horrible sleep
- sometimes I feel a bit ‚off‘ a few hours after taking it, but that improved already a lot!
- in the beginning, I had hot flashes ca. 2h after taking it and last for ca. 1h, it improved or maybe I just got used to handling it
- dry mouth, I’m drinking way more
- reduced appetite, but not too crazy that it affects me in a negative way.
- on 40mg I wasn’t that tired from it, but with increasing the dose I had weekends where I slept a lot and weekdays where I went to bed very early. Thats totally gone by now, I have a normal sleep rhythm.

Positive effects:

- first time, I took it on a day where I was really anxious and felt a reduction of my anxiety only after a few hours of taking it
- in general I’m less anxious, have calmer thoughts 
- I’m less impulsive. In fights with my husband I can stay calm, no shouting or impulsively saying things I’d regret later
- i still get distracted easily, but it feels like I can get back to my original task easier. Find my way back to focus 
- I‘m less overwhelmed, less overstimulated by sounds, my environment, my own thoughts… this is a huge plus for me
- in general I think I’m more focused, I’m barely procrastinating anymore at work which used to be a big issue for me. I can do tasks at work I don’t like and don’t keep postponing them
- I don’t have this constant feeling of being tired no matter how much I sleep. 

 On some days I’m still messy in my head, do too many things at the same time and forget what I was about to do. But I guess that’s just normal and could be also related to hormonal changes.

Now for the miso process.

2/21 at 8:45 am - four Advils (800 mg total)

4 Miso on 2/21 at 9:35 - under tongue, cramps pretty immediately. Like within ten minutes. Swallowed remainder after 30 minutes. 

10:23 violently shivering, cramps 3/10

10:30 cramps 5/10, feeling gassy, shaking, chills 

10:41, same but feeling like I need to number 2

10:49 diarrhea 

11:06 bubbly stomach, 5/10 cramps 

12:00 started to feel a few gushes out that felt like a heavy period. Cramps are less now - tolerable with a heating pad 

12:05 - took one extra strength Tylenol with ginger ale to prepare for next miso dose 

12:17 checked on my pad and the gushing ended up just being pink tinged liquid - didn’t look like a period at all.


12:35 - took two more miso 

12:53 - feeling okay - 3/10 cramps. Starting to wonder if it’s working. Stomach bubbly though. 

1:13 - a few more gushes. A little bit of chills. Cramps not major. 

1:17 - a 101.3 fever. Called aid access and they called back and said this is not concerning unless it lasts for 24 hours 

1:19- sat on toilet - gushing out - sounded like diarrhea can’t tell if it was clots or just a lot of liquid - too much blood in toilet to tell. Cramps are curiously still very moderate. Changed pad 

1:27 - ate some fruit, no nausea 

2:05 - soaked pad. Soaked through pants. Superrrr clumpy thick blood pouring out when i sat on toilet. Changed pad. Cramps are still moderate. 

3:01 completely soaked pad, soaked through new shorts. Pushed out a big glob. Not sure if it was like a solid glob or just thick blood. and lots of watery blood. Cramps increased a little bit. 5 or 6/10 cramps. 


3:11 pain/cramps increasing, steady 6/10

3:28 passed more clots, pad was not completely soaked but still soaked enough to change it. 

3:34 popped the final two miso. Stomach bubbling, 5/10 cramps as they’re dissolving 

4:43. Still bleeding and passing large clots 

5:22 pain is getting worse, consistently 7/10 ish. 

5:39 Still passing blood and one small clot 

5:55 - pain is lessening. Don’t feel gushing. 

6:30 - a few gushes and off and on cramps. Much less now. Bleeding less. Did not soak a full pad. 

6:53 cramps in waves now 

7:35 - cramps still in waves. Bleeding but not soaking a full pad. 

At some point I ate pizza for dinner.

8:45 same. A couple of small clots. Took more ibuprofen 

8:00 am following day. Took melatonin last night and slept through the night. Almost no cramps this morning. Feeling fine. No pregnancy symptoms.

1ivihu0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ivihu0,Formal and informal trolling of Russia via maps in support of Ukraine,"


A couple of years ago, London renamed the small stretch of road in front of the Russian Consulate to “Kyiv Road”. Other countries have done similar things, such as:

Lithuania renaming the street in front of the Russian Embassy “Ukrainian Heroes Street.”

Czech Republic renaming part of the street outside the Russian Embassy “Ukrainian Heroes Boulevard.”

Norway naming a square near the Russian Embassy “Ukraine Square.”

Albania and Latvia renaming streets to reference Ukrainian resistance.

Today, I discovered that Apple Maps and Rightmove (UK’s leading property listings platform) both show “NAFO HQ” where there is actually Russian Embassy/Consulate. Only once you zoom in on Apple maps you will see Nafo + Russian Embassy. Google Maps, however, still lists it only as the Russian Consulate/ North Lodge (a residence for their consulate staff I guess). 

> NAFO (North Atlantic Fellas Organization) is an internet-based, pro-Ukraine online movement that uses memes and social media activism to counter Russian disinformation, troll Russian officials, and raise funds for Ukraine. It is not an official organization but a decentralized grassroots community that formed in response to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

**Strategize Like It's 1999 (but with Better Tech)**

The trick? Carve out a niche that’s so specific, AI just won't bother. Specialize or mobilize. Perhaps it’s AI-generated artisanal coffee recommendations? Okay, maybe not... The key is ensuring your startup sass matches its tech savvy. After all, authenticity is the new black.

Breakfast: Oatmeal, Coffee, and a Banana.   
Lunch: Protein Shake (at work)  
Dinner: Grilled Chicken Breast with a Large Salad  
Snacks: Rice Cakes or Fruit if needed, but I plan to cut out snacking entirely

I'm not a picky eater, and I'm also someone who can go without eating a ton. I've gotten this overweight due to binge eating because of stress. But I've handled the stress now and am ready to become healthier.  I plan to eat that every day for about 4 months and see where I end up. I love eating the same thing every day, so no need to worry about that. My goal weight is 135lbs, and I don't expect fast results. I just hope that a year from now I will be at a healthy weight. I also plan to exercise five days a week, primarily focusing on cardio.

1ivi91e,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1ivi91e/a_critical_opinion_on_fellows_products_and_reviews/,A critical opinion on Fellow's products and reviews,"**TLDR** at the bottom, I know this is very long.

# Intro
James Hoffman's recent [review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUFTOeT9fcE) of the Fellow Aiden inspired me to write down some thoughts on Fellow and especially
their kettles since I use an EKG Pro.

I think that among enthusiasts it's likely that kettles from Fellow seem to be very popular, if not the most popular. Visiting a coffee event which featured a mokka battle for example, almost all competitors used a Stagg, most of them an EKG.
Online reviews also generally praise it with only minor complaints about the lid design or the UI.

## An 'enthusiast' product
As an owner of an EKG Pro, I am however disappointed and it's still very surprising to me how what I consider to be glaring issues are rarely ever brought up, especially by reviewers.
When I buy some sort of tool that is meant for enthusiasts I usually get:

1. Customer Support that feels like it understands their consumer base and is open for feedback and supports and enables users to adjust things to their liking. Usually enthusiasts themselves.
2. A feature set that more ""normal"" devices for the same purpose don't possess, usually with a lot of flexibility for tinkering.
3. Design flaws because novel choices were made, sometimes maybe unnecessary ones. But new iterations of the product are made based on customer feedback.
4. A high price point.

An example of another enthusiast community that I know of is the custom mechanical keyboard/custom fighting game controller one where heavy emphasis is put on modifiability and open source software to allow the community to work together *with the company* in finding solutions.

Now, I don't expect for my kettle to be fully disassemblable like a mechanical keyboard or for the software to be fully open source. But as member of such communities I find myself somewhat baffled at what I perceive as Fellow's positive reputation as a kickstarter company that came from the specialty coffee scene. Because I genuinely don't see how they deserve it.

# The Issues
## Hardware
Some issues with the design of the kettles seem to be both brought up in reviews and also addressed by new iterations of the kettle.
An example would be the addition of a proper silicon gasket to the lid in the pro version to help against leaking water
from the top.
I do question why this ""feature"" had to bundled with a more expensive version that came with loads of other extra things though.

I also get the impression that Fellow is very anti right-to-repair with users getting little help from customer support and replacement parts being unavailable
([example 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/18edlmp/fellow_ekg_stagg_base_disassembly/), [example 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/uo5pyq/repairing_pastwarranty_fellow_stagg_ekg/)).
This is a very bad look to me and I find myself surprised to not see it called out more.
I think that [Zerno](https://zerno.co/manual/zerno-z1/) for example, would have no issues with helping users helping repair their devices
besides maybe voiding warranty, which is understandable.

## Software
This is where the real problems start for me. In James Hoffman's recent [review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUFTOeT9fcE) of the Fellow Aiden
he rightfully pointed out several issues with the UI and software, many of which are frankly so glaring and basic that any UI Designer would feel sick just seeing them:
a square menu cropped to a circular screen and no quick way to get back in a menu?? This isn't some DIY Arduino project.
*He softened the criticisms however, noting that he doesn't want to date the review harping on software too much as firmware updates can fix these.*

In principle a valid reason, but: The last significant update that the EKG kettles from Fellow had, came in the form of a new version, the EKG *Pro*/*Pro Studio*.
Even on [Fellow's website](https://fellowproducts.com/pages/compare-stagg-ekg-kettles) the main upgrades listed are *almost all* software-related.
I wonder how many of the features could have been added to the EKG if they had wanted to do that. Notably the Pro/Pro Studio now feature WiFi updates!
I want to stress that adding this feature raises the expectation of buyers that future bugs/issues will be dealt with,
making the offer more attractive and more like an ""enthusiast product"" such as I know them.

But significant updates [never came](https://help.fellowproducts.com/hc/en-us/articles/9593179929115-What-is-the-current-EKG-firmware-version-and-what-did-it-update).
[Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1daxvw5/fellow_ekg_pro_issue_and_no_update/) a thread on how the temperature reading would not update correctly.
This basic problem still persists and is likely caused by the firmware hacks to [hide overheating](https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1daxvw5/comment/lttpzwe/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).

I want a kettle with a decent PID heat controller that can show me a somewhat accurate temp reading. To obfuscate the temp to the point where it causes issues,
especially when I want to do recipes with mixed temperatures (e.g. Tetsu Kasuya's switch recipes: pouring cold water into the kettle *doesn't update the temp reading*),
is about as anti-enthusiast as a product can get. The kettle is failing its purpose in a very basic capacity and it could very likely be fixed with a
*just a firmware update* but it seems like nobody at Fellow is even working on the firmware anymore:

When I reached out to their support, I was first given a painfully obvious AI-generated reply and only upon further inquiry
did I get a (human?) reply which promised a firmware fix mid January ([mail interaction on pastebin](https://pastebin.com/raw/7737ZDaC)).
I would frankly be surprised at this point whether this update will ever come as I am hardly the first one to ask for it.

Of course, just like the hardware, the software remains extremely difficult to modify; it's not just not open source, it's almost impossible to reverse-engineer.
It makes me wonder just how much Fellow fudges with the temperature readings, I've yet to test it with a temperature probe.

# Main Point and TLDR
Based on my experience with the Stagg EKG Pro, I find that my perceived positive reputation of Fellow is not justified and
I would wish from reviewers of coffee gear to be more critical of firmware issues:

I think that in other enthusiast markets, the software issues that the Fellow Aiden currently has would be far more criticised and
I am frustrated with reviewers and customers buying into Fellow's promise
of firmware updates when the company involved has a history of not delivering on that promise.

I hope I'm wrong but I wouldn't be surprised if the issues pointed out by Hoffman in his [Fellow Aiden review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUFTOeT9fcE)
will only be addressed with the release of the ""Fellow Aiden Pro"" in a couple of years.

Hi, I'm Leaf.🍃 How's it goan folks?

 I picked this up in October but had to shell out 2/3 what I paid for it in repairs. It's pretty much mechanically sound now so I'm getting organised to start the work. Never done anything like this before but I do have woodworking skills. 

From what I've gleaned I need to put the windows in first and get the electric wires fed through. I'm in Edinburgh and looking for van buddies to share tips  and ideally give me a hand with the build, so...

This is a call for kindly souls looking for a project to make good use of their time and skills, to help me build it. I wouldn't be able to pay much because I'm doing this on a shoestring but I will be able to offer a token payment for labour if that will seal the deal. Although might even only be a full belly and all the tea or coffee you need, at times. We can talk.

Looking to start off seeing my home country at a slow and adventurous pace. Haven't seen the half of it in my half century on this earth. 

If you're not able to answer the call but live in Scotland or wish to visit Scotland, please drop me a line. You can't have enough friends in this game of life. Namaste, blessings and caio for now, I hope.

Imagine having a blood vessel balloon that’s ready to pop, with survival odds hovering around a bleak 10%. That’s where AI steps in—not as a gloomy replacement for doctors, but as a sidekick that scours through mountains of data to flag potential aneurysm threats. “We're giving radiology reports a second life,” explains Dr. Samantha Cox. The AI combs through imaging study dictations and alerts experts to aneurysms that might otherwise slip through the busy hospital shuffle.

Let’s face it, technology has always walked a fine line between helpful ally and skynet nightmare. But here's the twist: at OSF, it’s all about using AI to bolster medical judgment, not replace it. Dr. Tyler Fitch assures transparency with their tech toolkit. After all, wouldn’t you want to know if your healthcare decisions were partly powered by an all-seeing, all-knowing algorithm?

Now, AI isn't just sipping coffee in the radiology department—it's expanding its role to track cancer risks and monitor tumors, too. This isn’t the stuff of sci-fi; it's tangible, life-saving action. What's more, the ripple effects include tighter collaboration with primary care offices, enhancing overall patient care.

But enough about AI's burgeoning medical career; let’s flip the script. How do you feel about AI getting cozy in hospitals? Is this the dawn of a new medical era, or should we play it cool until we’re sure these bots don’t start demanding scrubs?

I am 31 F, I have noticed in the last year or so my heart rate/pulse tends to be trending on the upwards, I smoke and have since I was 13, however I've noticed my diastolic number gets as high 133-140 sometimes, my diastolic seems to be hovering between 86-99, and my pulse can be as high as 135. Sometimes with suddenly getting up, sometimes upon waking in the morning I can literally feel the thudding beginning but again may be the effects of waking up and having coffee/nicotine. Upon waking up with no caffeine or nicotine or during the day, my pulse stays right at 109-114. I have also noticed what looks like some nail clubbing possible? My sister pointed it out as well to me. I do have an anxiety disorder where I pick at my nails too however so that could also be causing the shitty state of them. Another weird thing that has happened in the past year or so, my nail color is beginning to look like terry nails where they go half red/half white. My ankles seem to swell up some in the summertime now with high temperature, and both of my feet swelled up really bad when I went to Italy on my honeymoon, they didn't go down 100% until I got out of there, I also decided it would be fun to go hiking as well during that trip. The swelling would go down like a little bit, then as soon as I'd go back out walking they would re swell until I got back from my honeymoon. Lastly, I have been getting horrible histamine reactions for the past 1-2 years ever since my last covid booster. Sometimes my chin will start burning and if i even dare touch my chin it gets way hotter and worse. My face also gets very red on both cheeks and the area under my nose, except the redness never 100% goes away. My skin seems to get worse as well as my histamine seems to get worse around my menstruation. I do also have a skin condition called keratosis pilaris. A year ago it was so bad that I would have to take an antihistamine everyday as I would be itching all over or feeling like a bug would randomly bite me with the itch/sting. Any insight would be great. My facial skin stays red everywhere except for around my lips, including by nasal folds. It varies in intensity from day to day.

1ivi6vx,https://www.reddit.com/r/lesbianr4r/comments/1ivi6vx/femme_20_southeast_looking_for_butchmasc_to_share/,"Femme (20, Southeast) Looking for Butch/Masc to Share Quiet Moments","**About Me:**

I’m 20, femme, and about to start grad school in the Southeast USA, diving into the fascinating world of infectious diseases. I love what I do. There’s something beautiful about understanding the microscopic world, and I’d love to share that curiosity with someone special. 😊 If you find comfort in quiet conversations and someone who loves to share what fascinates them, we might get along well.

When I’m not buried in research, you’ll often find me curled up with a book. I’d love to swap favorites or spend quiet evenings reading side by side. I love the comfort of quiet evenings with a good book or working on a cross-stitch project. I find peace in these small moments and would love to share them with someone who appreciates the same. My dog is my constant companion. He’s always up for a long walk or curling up after a day of exploring, and he’s great with cats if you have any. I’m a total nerd about a lot of things! Ask me about dog breeds and their histories, the Regency period, book collecting, or any fun fact that’s caught my curiosity.

I value honesty, warmth, and someone who leads with thoughtfulness and care. I’m a romantic at heart—I believe in the little things, like shared smiles and lingering glances. I’m looking for someone who finds meaning in quiet, tender moments. I also love a good conversation. Someone who enjoys talking and sharing what’s on their mind will fit right in. If you’re outside the Southeast or outside the US, I’d love to close through video calls—I believe distance doesn’t have to get in the way of building something real. 

**My Best & Worst Qualities (Depending on Who You Ask):**

**Beige Flag:** I need people to be explicit about their intentions and feelings—I’m not great at guessing. But once I know where you stand, I care deeply and will always show up for you.

* **Best:** I’m deeply caring and attentive. I’ll remember your coffee order and the little things that make you smile. I’m curious about the world and always eager to learn something new. I’m a good listener and love creating a space where you can feel comfortable being yourself.
* **Worst:** I can be sensitive to jokes about my appearance—I’m working on it, but sometimes I need a little extra kindness. I can be a bit insecure and occasionally need reassurance. Also, if you’re not ready for passionate conversations about niche topics, I may be a lot (but hey, some people find that charming).

**What I’m Looking For:**

* **Butch/Masc:** I’m drawn to someone with a steady, confident presence. I admire confidence and someone who isn’t afraid to take charge. There’s something comforting about being able to lean on someone who’s sure of themselves.
* **Age and Connection:** At least 20+ and open to something serious if the connection is right.
* **Spice Factor:** I appreciate someone who knows how to take charge in and out of the bedroom. There’s a special kind of trust in being able to let go with someone who understands how to hold that space. Intimacy matters to me, and I’d love to explore that connection in meaningful ways. I’d love someone who enjoys keeping the spark alive, even when we’re apart—playful teasing and a little spice always make things better.
* **Emotional Maturity:** Someone who communicates openly, with the patience and care to build something real. I love feeling cherished and valued, and I enjoy returning that affection in thoughtful ways.
* **Dog Lover (or Tolerator):** You don’t need to have your own, but my little guy is part of the package—and he comes with an open heart for cats, too.

If you’re the type who can make me blush and then make me laugh, I’d love to get to know you!

**Send me a message with something about you.** What are you reading? How do you like to spend a quiet weekend? Or tell me something that always makes you smile—I’d love to know.",3,1740229187.0,lesbianr4r,1,1.0,False

Back to unboxing in the nursery in the middle of the night. Oh surprise, it’s her 47th pump because she doesn’t want to be “chained” to a wall again.

1ivi0eu,https://www.reddit.com/r/DermatologyQuestions/comments/1ivi0eu/whats_going_on_with_my_face/,What's going on with my face?,"I have attached some photo's for reference here. I am 31 F, I have noticed in the last year or so my heart rate/pulse tends to be trending on the upwards, I smoke and have since I was 13, however I've noticed my diastolic number gets as high 133-140 sometimes, my diastolic seems to be hovering between 86-99, and my pulse can be as high as 135. Sometimes with suddenly getting up, sometimes upon waking in the morning I can literally feel the thudding beginning but again may be the effects of waking up and having coffee/nicotine. I have also noticed what looks like some nail clubbing possible? My sister pointed it out as well to me. I do have an anxiety disorder where I pick at my nails too however so that could also be causing the shitty state of them. Another weird thing that has happened in the past year or so, my nail color is beginning to look like terry nails where they go half red/half white. My ankles seem to swell up some in the summertime now with high temperature, and both of my feet swelled up really bad when I went to Italy on my honeymoon, they didn't go down 100% until I got out of there, I also decided it would be fun to go hiking as well during that trip. The swelling would go down like a little bit, then as soon as I'd go back out walking they would re swell until I got back from my honeymoon. Lastly, I have been getting horrible histamine reactions for the past 1-2 years ever since my last covid booster. Sometimes my chin will start burning and if i even dare touch my chin it gets way hotter and worse. My face also gets very red on both cheeks and the area under my nose, except the redness never 100% goes away. My skin seems to get worse as well as my histamine seems to get worse around my menstruation. I do also have a skin condition called keratosis pilaris. A year ago it was so bad that I would have to take an antihistamine everyday as I would be itching all over or feeling like a bug would randomly bite me with the itch/sting. Any insight would be great. My facial skin stays red everywhere except for around my lips, including by nasal folds. It varies in intensity from day to day.

1ivhzzq,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1ivhzzq/a_never_ending_cycle_of_poor_sleep/,A never ending cycle of poor sleep,"40M. Not on any kind of medication. Poor sleeper for years. Triggered by a stressful event and made worse by what eventually became a full on addiction to coffee which I didn't realize until just recently was a huge part of the problem. Whle my anxiety and stress eventually subsided for the most part, the addiction to coffee remained strong until I began reading just how impactful caffeine can be on a persons sleep. So on December 10th 2024 I cut out ALL caffeine for good. No coffee, no iced tea, not even chocolate. After a week of brutal headaches and withdrawal symptoms something amazing began to happen. For the first time in what must have been 6-7 years I began getting that nice sleepy and droopy eyed feeling before bed. I couldn't keep my eyes open and craved sleep hard. I'd drift off to bed within 15 minutes which is something that NEVER happened while on caffeine. I thought to myself this was it and a real change was happening. Caffeine was messing up my body for years and now my sleep was finally changing for the better and that phase of my life was over. That's what I thought...

Then, I'm not sure what happened. Slowly but surely, I began to struggle again. I never tossed and turned like I did on caffeine and still don't, but it took me a little longer to fall asleep many nights. For some reason that sleepy droopy feeling I remember from that first week disappeared and pretty much never returned again. The biggest problem however, was the early awakenings. 90% of days I wake up too early. When I should be sleeping until around 7-730am, I'll instead wake up at 530-6am which will leave me feeling tired most of the day. I've tried everything I could at this point. It doesn't matter if I eat somewhat healthy all day and it doesn't matter if I'm scarfing down pizza or a cheeseburger for dinner. My last meal is always at least a few hours before bed and I also don't go too crazy with electronics before bed, though it should be noted that even in that one beautiful week where I was super sleepy before bed, I used my laptop in bed every night before I drifted off. I still basically don't have any caffeine at all (though I may have cheated with a bit of chocolate on a super rare occasion) and my anxiety is nothing at all like it was years ago. For the most part, I go to sleep quite relaxed.

At this point I know there aren't really any concrete answers. I guess I'm just looking for support... and if someone might have some sort of advice, I'll take it. I look back at that first week post caffeine and just can't understand it. I can't understand how I slept so well and fell asleep so easily. I guess it was just as if something was happening to my system withdrawing from caffeine that allowed me to relax more, I'm not sure. I'm still more relaxed now than when I was on caffeine, but sleep is still a problem...

1ivhzr4,https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/comments/1ivhzr4/do_you_have_weird_neighbours/,Do you have weird neighbours?,"I might be unstable but there were so many instances of my neighbours making comments about me. I feel unstable because I think why are they paying attention to me.

They had a room extended a few years ago which is now their kitchen and dining room. Their dining room window faces our back door. There were a few times they would leave their curtains open when having dinner but then freaked out when I went out of the back door and then they closed the curtains.

One time I opened the door for my dogs to go out, they freaked out and closed the curtains and I heard the woman neighbour laughed and said ""cuckoo"" a few times, like I'm the crazy one. Before that time I was walking back in and I heard her say ""I saw her"" to someone and giggled. My room's window is opposite and to the side of their dining room window and after I put up frosted privacy sheets on my windows, she mentioned it to our tenant when she was looking out her window and saw him walking back in.

One or two times I heard a man tell someone to close the curtains after I went out to the yard at night and they were having dinner. A few weeks ago I went out and everyone sitting at the table turned to look. The other week I went out and didn't looked their way and I heard someone said ""she doesn't want to look at us"".

They can see in our laundry window from their window when we have the lights on. Last night I was in the laundry room and I heard a man gasped loudly, like he was looking in and was shocked to see me stand up. I later went out the door and heard a man exclaimed loudly again like he was shocked to see me. I don't look in their window and always walk down the steps fast when they have their curtains open at night so I didn't see him. Today they have their curtains closed since the morning. 

A few months ago I brought out the rubbish bins to the curb for collection. I rarely bring out the bins because the tenant does it. That day I did it but I moved it after initially bringing them out because my parents like them placed a certain way in case the truck might have trouble collecting ours. Then that night I moved them again. After I did that a man from their house stormed out and seemed like he was going to yell at me and they were all standing on their porch. I walked back to my house and that man said ""she's so.."" and trailed off.

I feel like they might be pissed that I don't pay attention to them. For context I do know the woman. From what I know she moved in with her brother then their parents moved in a few years ago. She have invited me over for coffee a few times but I haven't accepted. A while ago I was driving out of the driveway to work and saw her dad and waved. He doesn't speak English but made an eating motion like he's inviting me over to eat. I said I'm running late and then he just shook his head.

I regularly hear them make comments but I also feel unstable because I don't understand why they would be paying attention and being weird. Their front door faces our window where the kitchen sink is. The other night I heard their door opened then I heard a man scoffed and said ""she closed the blinds like we want to look in!"". I close the blinds properly throughout the house but my parents don't care about closing the blinds properly. My parents went overseas for a month and the neighbours would know that I'm alone.

I also have to deal with a creepy tenant. I live with my parents so he's their tenant and he lives in the teenage retreat at the back of the house. He has done so many creepy things. I ignore him now and get pissed when I see him. He now tries to sneakily look at me from his place. He always needs to go out to the yard when I am outside. My dogs barks at him and charges at him and he just pulls back, instead of going back inside his place to wait us out. Just before I came home from taking my dogs out. I bought a garden bed and brought it out to the yard. I put my dogs in it and was taking photos of them and I heard he opened his door, I turned around to look and he scoffed/made a huffing sound and he back inside.

# Saturday reading: Mini-decisions lead to maxi-decisions

Few relapses are intentional. The stated intent of all people trying to change is to take actions and to maintain their progress until they are free of their problem. But it is easy to fool ourselves. We may make any number of “mini-decisions” that ultimately have negative consequences… Some such decisions might include keeping extra servings of current-risk binge foods in the house “in case company drops by” or deciding to go for coffee or a walk (healthy activities on their own) in a high-risk business or neighbourhood instead of doing the same thing in a safer place where you are less likely to run into high-risk people or things. It could mean falling behind in self care or deciding that you don’t necessarily need to make a plan for the next risk situation that is coming up.

Such mini-decisions can lead you to begin shifting away from maintenance and toward relapse. Before you know it, you may find that you’ve gone back to your old ways, never having made a conscious “maxi-decision” to relapse.

I have a Flemish Giant and whenever I'm trying to shop for toys, tunnels, hides, etc most things don't come in a size appropriate for him. So I wanted to ask if anyone has come across some things that have been really big wins for their giant buns. He seems bored and I want to get him some new things, in hopes of redirecting him away from my furniture. 

Some things about my bun:
He really likes to dig, especially on fabric. He will literally drag a blanket across the floor, bite holes into it and crumple it into a lump under his belly. In the past he's made holes in seat cushions and dug the foam out of them. He really likes to eat cardboard boxes. He likes to chew on wood as well but vastly prefers the legs of my coffee table over any of the things I got him because the legs of the coffee table stay still when he's biting on them whereas the pieces of wood I buy him are not stationary. Sometimes he digs in his litter tray which I'd like to stop him from doing but none of the litter trays made to prevent that come in a big enough size. He also likes to sleep in a dark corner but it's difficult for me to find hides that are big enough for him to sprawl out in. 

One thing I thought of is buying a small coffee table, sitting it on top of a carpet,  and attaching fabric to the top of it so he can use it as a hide and a place to dig. ",1,1740228274.0,Rabbits,0,0.67,False
1ivhx63,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tonsillectomy/comments/1ivhx63/positive_tonsillectomy_experience_while_studying/,Positive Tonsillectomy experience while studying abroad,"Hey guys! Since I was very scared before the surgery I thought I'd share my own experience, in case anyone needs to read a more positive experience!
 
Tl;dr: 
Overall I feel fantastic! I couldn't be happier to have done this surgery here in Spain despite everyone advising me not to. I'm surprised how good my experience was because every single post I read about this surgery said that it was the most painful recovery process ever. I guess I was just very lucky! For me, my pain never went above a 4/10 or 5/10 (except when I ate that sour soy sauce salmon.... Idk what i was thinking). Overall the surgery recovery was less painful than most of my tonsil infections honestly...
It was honestly really nice laying on the couch, watching movies and eating ice cream. I would 100% do it again. I will see how i feel the next days, but I'm sure my quality of live will improve drastically because of this surgery. If anyone is curious, it costs about 2,500€ in Spain, including everything. Luckily my insurance in Germany is paying for it! 

Heres the long story:
I'm a 20 year old girl from Germany and am studying abroad for a year in Spain. For about 2-3 years I had been getting about 2-3 tonsil infections per year, but in 2024 i had 6 tonsil infections within 6 months plus a very painful case of mono, so I finally decided to have my tonsils removed despite everyone telling me it would mess with my immune system. At that point, I had taken Penicillin so often that it had stopped working and I needed to rely on different antibiotics, who were also not getting rid of the infection completely any longer. I was in constant fear of getting sick again and felt super disappointed in my body. 

Everyone told me to wait until I was back in Germany to get my tonsils removed, but the sickness had already ruined my first semester abroad, so I couldn't wait any longer. I tried desperately to get a surgery appointment in Germany but due to the waiting lists i would've needed to wait over a year for the surgery, which I wasn't willing to do. Luckily I had gotten a private health insurance for traveling abroad, which enabled me to see a private ENT doctor. Mid January 2025 I talked to him about wanting to get the surgery and I got the appointment for February 8th, which means that I'm currently 14 days post surgery.

Day of the surgery:
First of all, the day of the surgery was fine, when I woke up I only had minor pain due to the strong pain meds they were giving me through an IV. The doctor came and visited me and explained he used the Lowest heat setting possible to remove them so that it would be less painful for me. The surgery went well with no complications, so I was released in the evening to go home (my family was visiting me from Germany so I wasn't alone thank God). He prescribed me two strong painkillers which in Spain are called Enantyum (this also saved me when I had mono), I believe it is Dextroprophen or something like that. The other was Tramadol. I took those pain meds every 8 hours each, so basically I tool Tramadol, then 4 hours later Enantyum, then 4 hours later Tramadol again. In the hospital they served me eggs and yoghurt about 8+ hours after the surgery which i was able to eat fine, then at night at home I had oatmeal with oatmilk since I read that a lot of people said dairy was bad for the wound healing. I was able to eat it with relatively little pain and then I had a very very good nights sleep because of all the strong meds who were making me so tired. The only thing is that i really had to put a few pillows under my head, because laying down flat was super uncomfortable for some reason. 

Day 1 post-op: 
The next day my parents drove me to my boyfriend's house by the beach in Spain so that I would be able to recover with his help and not be alone since they were gonna leave the next day. We actually went to a restaurant and I was able to eat risotto without any issues. I just made sure that it cooled down and I chewed thoroughly and took small bites.

Day 2 after the surgery I already had a croissant for breakfast and a cold tea, and it went fine!

The next few days were uninteresting, I was on the couch watching TV and I ate soft foods. I took pain meds every four hours as prescribed on days 1+2, but from day 3, I already had much less pain so I only took pain meds about 1-2 times per day from then on. I stopped taking tramadol after day 3 since it honestly made me feel very weird and tired (which makes sense given thats an opioid). It also didn't feel necessary. I was able to walk around and cook food, I did feel very exhausted very quickly, but that shouldn't come as a surprise.

On day 4 I had my first shower including washing my hair, even though you're not really supposed to do that, but I couldn't wait any longer. I had my boyfriend watch me in case anything happened.

The next few days I started getting better and better. I ate more or less regularly, I just made sure to chew everything with a sip of water. One evening I ate salmon in soy sauce marinade, which was a massive mistake cause that BURNS in your throat... Well we learn!

On day 9 I ate a very crunchy pizza, which I absolutely shouldn't have, because I experienced my first bleed that night. Now I'm not sure if it was because of the pizza or if it was because I had gotten sick, and was coughing very aggressively the whole day. I suppose it could be both. Anyways I woke up with blood in my mouth, freaked out and went to urgent care. By that time the bleeding had already stopped and they told me that it wasn't an issue, as long as the bleeding stopped by itself. I had two more bleeds later that day, the last one being a bit stronger, so I got scared again and went to the ER. As expected, I got sent home again because the bleeding stopped without any help. My doctor advised me to take the blood stopping medication for another 3 days to prevent this from happening again, so I did, and I was fine.

On day 12 I had a checkup appointment, and my doctor was genuinely in shock how well my wound had already healed. When I told him that I had stopped the pain meds completely since I didn't feel any pain, he was very surprised. He told me that I could now start eating and drinking as normal (though I'm gonna be careful for the next few days because I don't wanna risk another bleeding).  

It is now day 14 and I am feeling almost completely normal. I'm still a bit careful with eating, I'm having ramen a lot these days since it's nice and soft. I started drinking coffee again and going out, going thrifting, yesterday I did a walking tour of a park in my city, and I didn't feel exhausted at all. I want to wait another week at least until i start working out and going clubbing again, just to be sure. Also I'm still a bit sick with the flu, so I'm also taking things slow because of that and I'm regularly taking coughing syrup to avoid irritating my throat!

I don't think so. Am I being too dismissive?,"Hi, this is a throwaway account as I am going to be revealing a lot of personal information. It’s going to be a long post so please please stay till the end, I would really appreciate the advice and perspective of others. My boyfriend and I have been dealing with this particular issue in our relationship for nearly half a year and have finally mutually decided to ask Reddit. So here goes..

I (22f) and my bf (23m) have been in a very serious relationship for a little over 2 years. We were very close friends for another 2 years preceding that. So we know each other really well. We met in our undergrad (we were classmates) and started dating in our final year. We are from 2 different states pushing us to be in a long distance relationship. After our graduation, I moved further away in the country to pursue my Master’s while he happened to get a job in the city I am originally from. 

Again, we were long distance. Something to note about us is that we both are extremely introverted and very picky about friends and have about 2-3 friends who we can connect with on an emotional and personal level. The rest can be considered as acquaintances. This never bothered either of us until this point. I was alone in this new city and felt extremely alone as he had a new job and was constantly busy. We are also in a very niche field that demands a lot from us. This would mean he would have to stay overnight for days or work on weekends too. Weekends were the only time we would get together (online). This coupled with the stress of my over-demanding college caused me to have a spiral. 

My class consisted of individuals who I couldn't really connect with. I was in a city notoriously known for people flaunting their wealth and ego, a complete contrast to my comfort. I know I am overbearing and can be a handful at times with my boyfriend as I get extremely emotional with him. He is the only one who knows how to deal with this. I find it very difficult to open up to people or express my emotional side to others which is why it possibly gets bottled up and I find it necessary to open up to my boyfriend a lot. 

Now, coming to the issue. I tried to connect to some people in my class but hardly anyone reciprocated. There was one boy in my class (24m) . Let's call him Jake for this story. Jake sat right behind me during class. We paid no mind to each other in the first and majority of the second semester. I had one girl I was friends with who was also my flatmate. We were close but I found that friendship with her extremely burdening as she was going through a lot and would constantly trauma dump onto me. I was there for her and never said anything against it but I had my own issues and just needed a lighter kind of friendship. I would try to talk to others but it would always reach topics I was hardly interested in and neither did they show any interest in involving me. Now Jake, was also one of them. We had a normal classmate relationship. He was also dating another girl from our class who had a reputation to be toxic. 

Anyway, cut to the chase, Jake was part of a huge friends group. On this particular day, all his friends had gone to a conference for a couple days including my flatmate. There were fewer students for lectures. During our break, I noticed that Jake was extremely off/sad and asked him if he was okay. I didn't push for details as it was none of my business. He was surprised and asked me if it was evident that he was sad. I told him yeah to me it was. Long story short, he ended up telling me about his toxic relationship with his gf and how it's taking a toll on him. I kinda felt bad for him because as far as I know him, he's a good person. Anyhow, after that we talked about random stuff and got to know we had a similar liking in books. Over the next few days we got to know each other better, nothing too much. A major reason why I was keeping my distance from him was the fact that he was a chain smoker and also did dr\*gs sometimes. It's a dealbreaker for me even in friendships. At this time, we also occasionally shared reels to each other on instagram, which are completely silly jokes. We both were from different cities and thus lived in hostels nearby. One of those days we were talking after college and he accompanied me to my hostel. This was nothing out of the way as his hostel is about a 5min walk from mine in the same direction and our college is a 10min walk from ours hostels so I didn’t pay much mind to it. During the walk we shared our favourite kinds of music and I asked him to listen to some track too which was my favourite song and made me feel better when I was upset/sad and might help him in his breakup. After he reached home,I asked him how he was feeling and he thanked me for the music. When I shared this information with my boyfriend he didn’t take it too well. But I promised him it meant nothing and I won’t let it happen again if it is making him uncomfortable. This was settled there.

The next incident was during our exams. I’m a pretty good student and make notes. Jake is aware of this and sometimes asks me for notes,as do my other classmates. This particular time, I was one of the only people to have notes of this subject and he was relieved to get them when I shared it. This prompted him to say he’ll give me something in return and I denied saying haha no thanks. He  insisted. I thought it was a joke as he is known to be a clown of the class constantly goofing around. He told me he’ll give me one particular chocolate which is a one that everyone likes generally but I asked him why that one in particular. So he said he knows I like it. I wasn’t too surprised as I mentioned earlier, everyone likes it. But I remember once talking in class about it, about a month or so prior and asked him if it was because he overheard my conversation and he said yes. I laughed it off again thinking it was a joke. The next day he gave not only me but his whole group of friends that chocolate. I was a little taken aback but he got it for everyone. Besides, it's a common thing here to buy the person who helps you out with something. Could be a treat or lunch or coffee etc. But this did not sit right with my boyfriend at all and caused a huge argument for days.He told me that Jake was observing me too much. I told him it meant nothing. Bf insisted that he bought it for everyone only because he wanted to give it to me. 

Now, something to note is that Jake is an extremely social and jovial person. He is good friends with everyone, girls and guys alike. Which is why dont find this behaviour uncommon for him to do. I have seen him do similar stuff for his friends and others too. 

Anyway, this argument continued. We almost split due to this person. My bf said that I don't understand what is happening because I can't look at it from his perspective and I said he couldn't see that we’re just friends. My bf and I also have each other’s instagram accounts in each other’s phones, so he can see the posts that are shared. Which he also found harmless so I continued that. 

After this, another incident took place for Christmas and my birthday after that. Jake is a literature-oriented person and loves languages and poetry. The place he is from speaks a different language than mine. We also had an aspect of comparing our languages and finding common words etc. So he wished me for the aforementioned events in a mixture of languages and some poetry which was some 4 lines basically saying Merry Christmas from my family to yours and the birthday one was just some cheesy birthday wish of Happy Birthday hope you stay happy. He wished me late in the evening and I asked him as a joke if he forgot. He said he did and only saw my best friend’s instagram story which reminded him. My boyfriend did not like that exchange at all and was curious as to what his wish said. My bf also does not like me using the hug, heart, stars emoji with other guys which was a whole different argument. When he saw that this message was in a short poetry format and I had also asked about him forgetting my birthday, he said that I was going too far as it sounded like I was desperate for his wish.. Which I wasn't. I tried to explain but we kept having huge arguments. 

We continued to share reels and hardly talk because I was too terrified to talk as I thought it would result in another fight. 

The final incident took place when I went back to college after my Christmas break. I had a shitty break as my home-life isn't the best. We had to report to college as we have to work on our final dissertations and Jake knew about this and asked me if I was back and how was Christmas since I didn't get a chance to visit home for Christmas of 2023. I told him it was great and shifted the topic to the dissertation. I told him I was a little scared about getting scrutinized. He told me I would do well and not to worry. I asked him how he was so sure.  He simply told me that as much as he knew me in the last year, I was very hardworking and I would complete each task which was given to me no matter what. He typed this to me in a sort of poetic way giving it a little rhyme. Keep in mind, I was extremely vulnerable at this point as I had a very tough New Year involving a huge outburst from my mother. I don’t open up easily at all but this felt appropriate and I told Jake in just a few sentences that what he said to me really meant a lot and thanked him for it and said that my mother wasn’t the best to me this time causing me to have a difficult time. I was extremely embarrassed after this but Jake was nice about it and told me that he already could tell  through my texts that I didn't have a very good time at the break and jokingly clarified that he didn't stalk me or anything but it's some concept he calls “spiritual stalking”. When I asked him if it's similar to telepathy he said no but that he would show it to me in person. He also sent me a simple poem he had written long ago about being strong and told me it's okay to talk sometimes as we tend to hold things inside and it can get really bad and bottled up. I thanked him and assured him that he can feel free to do the same. I told him I don’t have a lot of friends and have a connection with him as he is charismatic and has a unique and positive-vibed personality. To this he said it made him shy. I had also mentioned to him that I’ve gotten told before that I give out positive vibes and maybe that was the reason we connected. We also shared some songs with each other. The one he shared to me was in his state language and I wasn’t acquainted with it and he mentioned to me that I won’t understand it but I’ll get the vibe. I did not listen to that song as it’s by an artist I don't particularly like. All this happened on text. I fucked up here and didnt tell my boyfriend about this exchange for a while as I was extremely scared he world be upset. When he got upset,he would not talk to me for days openly. He would lie that he was okay and not be open at all which terrified me as I felt like a stranger when he did that. I wanted to avoid this at any cost. When I told him about this a few days later, he did the same thing as I described. He told me he thinks I have more than platonic feelings for this person which I denied because I never did and never will as my boyfriend is the absolute best to me and he compares to no one. We also looked up that song and although the music is rather similar to my taste, the lyrics were a little sketchy prompting my bf to get more annoyed but I left it open and gave him the benefit of the doubt as Jake mentioned that I wouldn’t understand the lyrics but will vibe.

Now, I need advice as I really like this person as my friend as it takes me really long to connect and be open to people but I also love my boyfriend way too much and cannot find a way to balance this.

Some side notes:

I have spoken only once to Jake on call related to academic stuff which stretched out over an hour including jokes about our student life during which my bf was on hold on the other line as I had just asked him to wait since I was getting a call and didn’t expect it to go on that long. I did text him and updated him on who I was talking to and what. Our friendship has never gone outside the classroom except the one time he accompanied me home. We text sometimes about books,we share songs occasionally and troll our college. 

My bf comes from a mindset that men and women cannot just be friends. There is mostly some ulterior motive. I don't believe the same as I have had some good friendships in the past with guys too. I have tried building friendships with women but they stop reciprocating them eventually. I was in an all girls school and was a tomboy most of my childhood. This made the girls not like me. One girl who stuck by me is my best friend till today. I was mostly friends with my older brother’s friends. Even now, I try with women but  I have been very unlucky. I even found 2 girls from my class to be friends with but one started claiming she’s in her ‘bad bi\*ch’ era and stopped talking while the other girl only talks to me when she needs any kind of help which really hurt me as I was super excited to finally have nice friends.

My bf doesn't like the relationship I have with Jake. He doesn't like us joking together anytime we talk. He feels like it should be strictly work related and any deviation is inappropriate. 

Anyway, Thank you for reading if you are still here. My bf and I would really appreciate your advice. We are sharing this throwaway account so you can ask either of us questions as we will reply. Thanks!

TLDR; My (22f) bf (23m) is uncomfortable with my growing friendship with a classmate, Jake (24M). Despite me seeing it as purely platonic, my boyfriend believes Jake may have ulterior motives, leading to repeated arguments.

Hello everyone, 
My Question ist about a 67 year old female with Parkinson’s diagnosed via a DAT scan. The symptoms show up on the left side of the body. Besides this condition known issues are Morbus Bechterew (possibly other autoimmune diseases), partly removed thyroid, high blood pressure, sleep apnea, overweight and possibly long Covid (low energy etc.). Mainly the low drive/energy, high stress and low resistance to it, a bit anxiety/moodswings and of course the tremors seem to be the worst issue’s. 

The current Treatment since a few months is L-Dopa/beneserazide.
Besides Sports and nutrition i researched some stuff that seems to have some evidence to help, which are:

ALCAR, CDP Choline with DHA, Probiotic’s, Sulbuthiamine, D Acetyl Leucine, vitamins and minerals as co factors for dopamine, Bromantane, maybe some vital mushrooms?!
Some things seem more risky and of course it doesn’t feel right to suggest those things to the family. Some seem highly promising like 9 mebc, what about peptides like cortexin or cerebrolysine?

Some things to prevent from further neurodegenerative damage/disease‘s, also because of the oxidative stress caused by the sleep apnea and genetics (her mother developed dementia.)
Does a DNA test make sense? 
What bloodmarkers to look out for? Inflammation and triglycerides ( which I know of) are to high. 

I heard of some gadgets that might help too. Besides that Tai Chi and table Tennis seem like good activities but because of the low energy it is hard for her to motivate her self to go for it, coffee worsens the tremors for her.

I know that was a lot but i can’t put in words how thankful I would be for your help, any suggestions and information about interactions are highly appreciated. 
Have a good one and wish you all a good time and health!

## Understanding Your Audio Needs: ​Why This Comparison Matters

Before jumping into the specifics, it's crucial to understand why this comparison is resonating⁣ with so many people. Both the TruthEar Hexa and​ the ​Apple AirPods Pro 2 cater to distinct audiences and offer different advantages. The AirPods⁤ Pro 2 are ubiquitous, known for their seamless integration with Apple devices,⁤ excellent noise cancellation, and convenience. They​ are the kings of the true wireless⁢ earbuds market.‍ The ⁤TruthEar Hexa, on the other hand, represents a more audiophile-centric approach, prioritizing exceptional sound quality ​and ‍detail retrieval at a compelling price point. This ‌in-ear monitor (IEM) caters to those⁤ who are serious about their audio fidelity.Many are looking for airpods pro 2 alternatives reddit.

This difference sets up ⁢an interesting dynamic: ⁤convenience versus pure audio performance.⁤ Are you⁤ willing to sacrifice some level of‌ wireless convenience for ⁣a perhaps superior listening experience? Or is the effortless connectivity and notable noise cancellation of ⁤the AirPods ⁤Pro 2 more appealing?

Many users on reddit are wrestling with this very question, poring over truthear​ hexa review reddit threads and carefully considering airpods pro 2 review reddit ​discussions. ‌They're looking for honest, unbiased opinions to guide their purchase. This article aims ⁤to provide just that – a balanced and comprehensive analysis.

[[Explore Top Rated truthear hexa vs airpods pro 2 reddit on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/airpods-pro/?kw=truthear hexa vs airpods pro 2 reddit)
## Sound Quality: Unpacking the Audio Experience

Let's begin with arguably the most important factor:⁣ sound quality. This⁤ is often the deciding point for audiophiles ‌engaging in the hexa vs airpods pro 2 sound quality discussion.

**TruthEar Hexa: The Audiophile's Delight**

The TruthEar Hexa is lauded for its balanced and detailed sound signature. It ⁣aims⁣ for neutrality,presenting audio as close to the original recording as possible. This means a relatively flat​ frequency response, avoiding excessive emphasis on any particular range. The truthear hexa frequency response is designed to appeal to listeners who appreciate accuracy and clarity.

According to user experiences shared on Reddit, the Hexa excels in detail retrieval, allowing you to hear subtle nuances in your music that might be masked by other headphones. The soundstage, the perceived​ width and depth ‌of the audio, is also generally⁤ considered to be wider‌ and more open compared to the AirPods Pro 2. As some Reddit users have noted, the Hexa's cleaner sound enables a more immersive and revealing listening experience, even surpassing more expensive options.

However, a common critique is⁤ that the TruthEar Hexa⁤ may ‌lack bass impact for some listeners.Even though it‍ presents bass accurately,it doesn't have ‌the ‌same level of ""oomph"" or ⁤rumble as some other IEMs or⁢ headphones. This is ⁢where personal preference comes ‍into play;⁣ if you crave a bass-heavy sound, you might find ​the Hexa a bit lacking without some EQ tweaking.But those looking for a relatively natural sound will find it appealing.

**AirPods Pro 2: Convenience Meets Competent Audio**

The AirPods Pro 2,⁣ while not aiming for ⁢the same level of audiophile precision​ as the Hexa, deliver⁣ a very enjoyable ⁤and consumer-friendly sound signature. apple has made notable strides in ⁣improving audio‌ quality with each iteration, and the airpods⁢ pro‍ 2 are a⁢ testament to ⁤that.

The AirPods pro 2 feature spatial audio, which creates a more⁣ immersive listening⁤ experience,‌ especially with⁢ compatible content. The improved sound processing and drivers result in a well-balanced sound with decent clarity and ‍a pleasing bass response.‌ Many users‍ describe the sound as‌ ""fun"" and engaging, making it well-suited for a​ variety of genres.

However, purists argue that the AirPods Pro 2 still fall short of the Hexa in terms of detail retrieval and accuracy. While the ⁤bass is more pronounced,it can sometimes overshadow other frequencies,leading to ⁣a less balanced presentation. The soundstage is also generally considered ⁣to be narrower compared to the Hexa.

**The Verdict: Sound Quality**

For critical listening and discerning ears, the TruthEar Hexa generally‍ wins the sound quality battle, offering‌ superior detail, clarity, and a more natural presentation. However, the AirPods Pro 2 provide a more consumer-friendly and engaging⁤ sound signature with the bonus of spatial audio. For those looking for audio quality reddit discussions, most agree​ hexa ⁣wins but some woudl prefer the spatial audio and more consumer-centered approach.

## Noise Cancellation: Silence the World⁣ Around You

Noise cancellation‌ is a key feature ‌for many users, especially those who commute, travel, or work in noisy environments. Let's assess how both contenders perform in this area.

**AirPods⁣ Pro​ 2: Industry-Leading ANC**

Apple has​ consistently raised the‌ bar for active noise cancellation (ANC) with its AirPods Pro line, and the second generation is no exception. The AirPods ⁤Pro 2 boasts significantly improved​ ANC compared to its predecessor, effectively ⁣blocking out a wide range⁤ of​ ambient sounds.Whether it's the drone of an airplane engine, the chatter in a coffee shop, or the rumble‍ of traffic, the ‍AirPods Pro 2 excels at creating a bubble of ‍silence.

The AirPods Pro 2 also features adaptive Openness mode, which ‍allows you to hear your surroundings while still reducing loud and‌ jarring noises. This is particularly useful for maintaining awareness while walking on busy streets or engaging in ⁤conversations.

Many noise cancellation test reddit threads ‌praise‌ the AirPods‌ Pro 2 for their exceptional ANC performance, making them a top choice for travelers and commuters.

**TruthEar Hexa: Passive Noise Isolation**

The TruthEar Hexa relies on passive noise isolation, which is achieved through the physical seal created by the ear tips. While not as effective as active noise cancellation, a good seal can ‌block out a significant amount of external noise.

The effectiveness of passive noise isolation depends heavily on the fit of the ear tips. It is important to find‌ the​ right size and material to achieve a proper seal.

Generally, the ⁢TruthEar Hexa's passive noise isolation falls ⁢short⁣ of the AirPods Pro 2's active noise cancellation. While it can block out some ambient noise, it won't be as ⁤effective in drowning out⁤ louder or more persistent sounds.

**The Verdict: Noise Cancellation**

The AirPods ⁢Pro 2 clearly win in this category,offering superior noise cancellation capabilities thanks‍ to their advanced ANC technology. If noise cancellation is ⁣a ⁤top priority for you, the‍ AirPods Pro 2 are the ‍better choice.

[[Explore Top Rated truthear hexa vs airpods pro 2 reddit on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/airpods-pro/?kw=truthear hexa vs airpods pro 2 reddit)
## Comfort and Fit: Finding the Perfect Seal

Comfort and fit are crucial for enjoying⁣ your listening experience, especially during extended listening sessions.

**AirPods Pro 2: Ergonomic Design and Ear Tip Options**

The AirPods Pro 2 features an ergonomic ​design that fits comfortably in most ears. Apple provides four⁤ sizes of silicone ear tips (XS, S, M, L) to‌ help you find the perfect fit. The​ ""Ear Tip Fit Test"" in the iOS settings can also help you determine the best ear tip size for your ears.

While the AirPods ⁢Pro‍ 2 are generally agreeable,some users may experience discomfort or fatigue after prolonged use. This can be due to the pressure created by the ear tips or the shape of the earbuds themselves.

**TruthEar Hexa: IEM Design and Tip Rolling**

The TruthEar Hexa adopts an IEM design,which means⁣ they are inserted deeper into the ear canal compared to the airpods Pro 2. This can provide a more secure fit and better noise isolation, but it can⁢ also be less comfortable for some users.

The Hexa comes with ⁤a variety of ear tips in different ⁣sizes and materials. ⁣Many audiophiles engage in ""tip rolling,"" experimenting with different ear tips ‌to find the best combination of comfort, fit, and sound quality. SpinFit tips⁣ are frequently mentioned in ⁤reddit headphone‌ advice as a solid option.The ‍comfort and‌ fit hexa airpods experience varies greatly from person to person due to‌ differences in ear canal shape ⁢and⁢ sensitivity. Some users find the Hexa extremely comfortable, while others experience discomfort or pressure.

**The Verdict: Comfort and Fit**

Comfort is‌ subjective, but the​ AirPods Pro 2 generally ⁣offer a more ⁤universally comfortable fit due to their shallower insertion depth and ergonomic design. However, the TruthEar ​Hexa offers more customization options with ​its variety of ear tips, allowing⁢ users to fine-tune the fit to⁤ their liking.

The AirPods Pro 2 offers solid battery life, providing​ up to 6 hours of listening time⁤ with ANC enabled and up to 7 hours with ANC disabled. The charging case provides an additional 24 hours of listening time, bringing the ⁣total to⁤ around 30 hours.

**TruthEar‌ Hexa: Not Applicable**

as the TruthEar Hexa is a wired IEM, battery life is not a factor.**The Verdict: Battery Life**

The AirPods Pro 2 provide ample battery life for most users,while the TruthEar Hexa eliminates battery life concerns altogether.

## Call Quality: Hearing and Being Heard

**AirPods Pro 2: ⁣Clear and natural ‍Calls**

The AirPods Pro 2 delivers excellent call quality,⁢ thanks to its⁣ advanced microphones and noise reduction algorithms. Voices sound clear and natural, and background noise is effectively suppressed.

**TruthEar Hexa: Decent Call ‌Quality with Limitations**

The TruthEar ​Hexa can be used for calls with an optional cable with a⁣ microphone (sold separately). However,the call quality is generally not as good as the AirPods Pro 2,as it lacks ⁣the advanced noise reduction features.

**The Verdict: Call Quality**

The AirPods Pro 2 offer superior call quality compared to the TruthEar Hexa.

## Price and Value: Getting the Most for ‍Your Money

Price⁢ is always a factor in⁣ any purchasing decision. Considering ‍the truthear hexa price vs the airpods pro 2 cost is crucial.**AirPods pro 2: Premium Price ​Tag**

The⁢ AirPods Pro 2 are priced at a premium level,reflecting their advanced features and seamless integration with‍ Apple's ecosystem.

While they offer excellent performance and functionality, they might potentially ⁢be considered expensive for‌ some users.

I have always attracted narcissistic and emotionally people until I saw the cycle and broke it. 

This is because my mother is narcissistic and lies about everything. She never admits fault. My dad is emotionally unavailable and seems to throw digs at me. 

For example, my mother has broke my coffee glass for the third time and refused to admit it and replace it. She was blaming it on others. Regarding my dad, he randomly brought up the other day that we won’t be paying anything for your wedding. I don’t even have a potential so why would you even say this. He seems to have a problem that I’m living at home and saving my own money to get married and move out one day. Always saying comments to me you are living in this house free! Never says it to my brothers though. 

He also made remarks saying that I won’t get a husband good enough. I just find it odd because a real good Muslim man would not say things like this to his daughter. A father is supposed to treat her daughter like a princess. It’s not like I ask for money from him! 

My parents gang up on me and say I’m disrespectful for getting angry and yelling when I confronted them. However, I am fed up. I know it is wrong to yell but when these things build up over time I lost it. I have experienced tough situations in life because my parents never displayed real love or shown real love in the household. 

I was never religious in the past and was thrown more into cultural things. Neither of my parents pray and my mother does not practice hijab. I have learned to pray and practice hijab all on my own. I feel like I have gaps in my knowledge about Islam because my parents never taught me!

1ivhkxp,https://www.reddit.com/r/TMAU/comments/1ivhkxp/how_i_saved_my_life_please_read_if_you_think_you/,How I saved my life. Please read if you think you have tmau,"I don’t even know how to start this off. I’ve been meaning to make this post for a while now. This community got me through some of the toughest times in my life, and I received so much support from a lot of you throughout everything. Hopefully this post finds the right people, and can encourage some of you to get the help that you need. You don’t deserve to suffer as much as you are right now.

So to start this off, and to give you an example of how depressing my life was: I was absolutely convinced that I had horrible breath, and that I reeked from the time I was 11, until I was 19 (a year ago). To say that I suffered is an understatement. I didn’t experience one ounce of joy in those 8 years. I didn’t enjoy 1 birthday, 1 holiday, or 1 vacation. I couldn’t enjoy school or make friends, and I couldn’t enjoy food or eat what I wanted. I basically lived as a prisoner of my own mind. I didn’t get to have a normal childhood experience or any normal experiences for that matter. Thinking about what I went through, and how much I suffered at such a young age, I can’t even believe how far I’ve come, and how it could’ve ended if I would’ve just TALKED to someone about it. 

After 8 years of unimaginable torture, my breaking point was going to a house show with my sister for a band that she found online. I don’t know why I agreed to do it honestly. I couldn’t tell you. It’s something that was so out of the ordinary for me, I genuinely can’t fathom why I went. We showed up to the house show and I was surrounded by people like me, for once in my life. Teenagers and young adults that seemed unconfident and scared, but somehow all got along and went together well. Everyone looked different, but everyone was happy walking around talking to eachother. I didn’t feel weird or out of place for once in my life, and for once I felt like I was home. When the band started playing, I got to experience something that I never saw before. A group of eclectic looking weirdos all dancing together and singing in unison. Everyone was smiling and laughing and I genuinely didn’t feel judged for the first time. It felt amazing. People were coming up to me and talking to me, I got hit on a few times, and my sister and I managed to become friends with a guy that introduced us to the band members which was really cool. I enjoyed myself so much for the first time ever, and I kept thinking about how much more amazing the experience would’ve been if I wasn’t worried about smelling bad. 

When we got back to our house, I decided that I needed to make a change and talk to someone about what I was going through. Up until that point, I hadn’t talked to anyone about it at all. I went online and found myself a therapist, and I made an appointment asap. Waiting for that appointment was extremely stressful to say the least. Thinking about talking to someone about it was physically painful to me. The day of my appointment was a scary one. On my drive up there, I was contemplating not even telling her about it and diverting the topic to me just having normal anxiety. I walked in to the building, and was shaking, waiting for her to bring me back. She came out, took me back, and I was having a full blown anxiety attack. We started taking, and getting to know each other. Time kept passing and then she finally asked me why I decided to start therapy. I hesitated for a minute and finally just blurted my entire story out. By the end, she was in tears and so was I. I couldn’t believe I just did that. It felt like the weight of the world was just lifted off of my shoulders. 

She started by telling me that she couldn’t smell anything at all (that day specially I remembered thinking that I smelled really bad). Which was extremely relieving for me. She developed a treatment plan for me. Eating foods that I normally wouldn’t, exposure therapy, and the last thing on the list was talking to my sister or mom about it. I put that off as long as humanly possible because of how scared I was. Exposure therapy and eating foods that I normally wouldn’t eat went really well. I remember one day (the day of one of my appointments) specifically eating steak, a lot of dairy, and spicy food. I showed up to my appointment scared and eager to know if she smelled anything, and she said that she didn’t at all. After this, I finally got the courage to talk to my sister about it. I sat my sister down and explained my entire story, and along with my therapist, she was in tears by the end. She was shocked. She made a really good point (which all of you guys might want to consider). She said, “if you genuinely really did smell bad, why wouldn’t I just tell you? Why would I ask you to do things with me? Why would I hang out with you? Don’t you think if you smelled THAT bad, someone would’ve just told you?” I’ve thought about that to this day and I genuinely don’t understand why I never considered any of that. I was so consumed by fear and delusion that I just believed my thoughts. Long story short, We started doing things together like going shopping, trying different coffee drinks, sushi, and a bunch of other things that I refused to do/eat before. I started ignoring all of the “reactions” that I used to get (which now I realize were just normal human behaviors) and I stopped getting “something smells bad” comments all together. Because what you focus on grows. 

I started living in unimaginable bliss for the first time ever. It was the absolute best feeling, and the best year I ever had, filled with so much confidence, and so many new experiences. Saying that I was happy, is an understatement. I felt like I was reborn as a new person honestly. Hopefully you guys become hopeful after reading this, that there is a better life on the other side of fear. You have to talk to someone and get real reliable feedback. If I didn’t do that, I seriously don’t know where I’d be right now. I want to write about what my life is like now, but this is already way too long (sorry about that). I’ll have to make a separate post in the future about that. Until then, I really really hope this helps someone get the help that they need. ",0,1740227008.0,TMAU,2,0.33,False

I’ve scheduled an appointment with an expert, but I think it’s either an ear infection or something else like earwax compaction. Either way, it’s nonstop. The itching is worse.

Not what I need right now. The other part is that I have finished this next chapter. It is 70,000 words + the ending of 10.34, which is a third of a chapter in of itself. Editing in two days would be nearly impossible, regardless of the ear problems.

The beta-reader response is coming in now; I just finished writing. However, I agree with one comment that reads:

‘This is like v8/v9 ending where people need to see the whole piece at once to not, like, die’

It must be told well, and for that I need time, as I warned you. Call this my monthly week off? Did I already take it? I’m not sure. I’m drinking coffee to stay functional and losing track of the days. But I do think this chapter, and the next, will be the last two.

And an epilogue, obviously, but it could well be under 20,000 words. Who knows, but I will take till the 1st for this one.

With apologies, and thank you for understanding. I will release an Enuryn comic on Saturday instead.

We talk more openly now, sharing personal details and inside jokes, and there’s this playful energy between us that feels different from my other coworker relationships.

For context, I’m more masc-presenting, and she’s super femme—not that it matters, but I feel like it subtly signals that I’m queer. When we first met, I wouldn’t have expected us to become as close as we are now.

At first, our conversations were strictly about work, but over time, we started hanging out more—talking during breaks, joking around, and lingering in conversation. She does little things that make me second-guess whether this is just friendship or something more. She lets me borrow her hoodie at work when I’m cold (I’ve offered her mine before), pouts at me when she’s hungry or wants coffee, and always wants my opinion on clothes she’s thinking of buying. When I suggest something, she seems genuinely interested. And in the past, she’s even looked disappointed when I put my headphones in, knowing it meant we wouldn’t be able to chat as much.

Then, there was the festival. We both ended up there from work, but I lost my friends, my phone died, and my ride home disappeared. I ended up being the fourth wheel, but she shrugged it off, saying that without me, she would’ve been third-wheeling anyway.

At the end of the night, she invited me to her place to charge my phone. She made me tea, gave me a hoodie to wear, and we sat on her bed while she took off her makeup. She shared a personal, funny story—something that wouldn’t come up at work. Then she casually mentioned I could stay over. I hesitated, unsure of what she meant by it. She kept saying, “It’s up to you,” and eventually, I decided to go home, mostly to avoid any awkwardness in the morning. If I had stayed, we would’ve been in her bed, and I think I would’ve left feeling even more confused.

I’ve shared a bed with friends before, and normally, it wouldn’t be a big deal. But this felt different—maybe because of our dynamic, or the fact that this was my first time at her place. We aren’t exactly close friends or even outside-of-work friends yet, which makes me wonder…

You don’t just casually suggest something like that unless you’re extremely comfortable—or at least a little curious, right?

There’s a part of me that wonders if I’m imagining things. But at the same time, I think there’s massive chemistry.

TLDR: My coworker \[25F\] and me \[25F\] have built a good work relationship and I think she might be flirting with me. I'm trying to navigate this without overstepping or miscalculating.",1,1740226239.0,relationship_advice,4,0.67,False
