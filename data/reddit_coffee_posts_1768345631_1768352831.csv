1qc9ca6,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1qc9ca6/i_resent_my_sister_and_our_parents_know_it/,I resent my sister and our parents know it,"I want to preface this by saying that I am a caretaker for adults with intellectual disabilities. I've seen, worked with and wiped ass firsthand for those who genuinely cannot take care of themselves because of a mental condition that they cannot help. I do not resent her because of her autism. My sister (F17) is autistic, but she is extremely intelligent (she has better grades in a harder major program than I do) and extremely high functioning. she has friends, support from my parents, and everything set up for her to have a good future despite her autism. She also has ADHD, OCD and anxiety - she is currently on a bunch of medication that has been filtered and changed by her psychiatrist and is in a very good place with her medication and has been for years. she regularly sees a therapist, lives with my parents, and only has to focus on school. We are only two years apart (I'm F19 - she skipped a grade in highschool which is why we're both in college. again, more intelligent than I am), but our lives have been completely different. 

my parents told me that I needed to get a job as soon as possible, so i took a CPR course when i was 13 and babysat when i was 13-14. I got a job at a coffee shop when i was 15 and have been working since. I've been working part time during the school year in highschool and keeping my grades up (4.0 in highschool and 3.8 in college rn), full time over the summer, saving every penny until i could buy a car because my parents told me that they would not buy me a car. They have money but raised me to work for myself and I agreed, saved up 10k by the time i was 16, and bought my grandma's car (she technically gave it to me for free but i had to pay for the out of state title transfer, new brakes, and pay yearly for car insurance, which totaled out to be around 3,000$). I have paid for everything and never gotten pulled over or got a speeding ticket, which were my parents' conditions for putting me on their car insurance. I also paid for all my clothes, makeup, fun stuff, etc since I started making money. my parents told me they would continue to pay for housing, food, and school fees. I also accepted this. When i moved to college I got my full time night shift role as a caretaker. night shifts have been brutal for me but i maintain decent grades and continue to pay my rent, car insurance, gas, groceries, medicine, cats, and everything else from my own paychecks. my parents pay my tuition (for which I am extremely grateful and tell them so often) and my health insurance, that's it. they stopped paying for housing and food since i moved out last year. i live three hours away from my family, for my own sanity.

My sister has been trying to get her licence for the last year - she does not have a job and would never be capable of holding one. my parents told me that they were going to buy my sister a car when she got her lisence and i know that also means they're paying her insurance and gas because she cannot afford it. she lives with them - my mom wakes her up in the morning because she can't be trusted to get herself up, my parents make her food because she cannot cook (she could learn but they never bothered to make her learn), drive her to class or pay her friend to drive her, and even keep a sticker chart for her that labels things like ""did homework without reminders"" ""took a shower without reminders"" ""got out of bed by self"", etc. stuff you would see for a kindergartener who is learning independence. they used to get into huge fights with her over her inability to do things by herself, and nothing worked - no amount of therapy, medication, reminders, alarms, etc would make her be independent. I don't blame them for how they act around her - they both seem resigned that she is going to be a burden and I don't know what I would have done for her in that situation but thank God I'm not her parent because I would have literally taken her to a full time care facility because she clearly needs it. I can't say for sure whether her dependence is because of her mental issues or if she's just dependent on them because they let her act like a child - but either way she is fully within her own mind to be dependent and intelligent enough to know how much she acts like a teenage toddler. 

I don't resent her because she struggles with dependence issues. I resent her and don't talk to her because she walks over everyone and my parents let her - and I got the worst of it. we used to share a bathroom and she would trash it to the point that I couldn't use it. i would assign sides and let her trash her side of the sink and she would continue to trash both. she would waste my coffee (she can't have coffee on her meds) by making herself a huge cup of my cold brew and wasting all of it. she would eat all of the food I would ask my mom to buy and none of hers that my mom made for her. I'm talking a chip flavor i requested would be gone in a day because she ate all of it, my lunch meat for my sandwiches that i made for lunch during school, shit she didn't even like just because it was mine. she would make us late for school before I was able to drive myself, and when I did drive myself I agreed to drive her as long as she was on time and drove her maybe twice the whole school year I had my car. She would spend HOURS in the bathroom to the point that i would have to have my dad almost kick the door down to shower after work. it was horrible - if you've ever had a roommate from hell imagine that except someone babies them and lets them do whatever the hell they want. my parents occasionally took my side and got mad at her but they never punished her to the point that she actually learned. I moved out when I was 17 to go to college three hours away and stayed with my ex over breaks so I would never have to stay in the same house as her for more than a day. Now that I have an apartment my parents just come to visit me or I go for holidays and stay in a hotel. 

what bothers me most about this situation is not her - because I don't have to deal with her anymore and I've come to terms with how things are. What bothers me most is that my parents are now trying to compensate with money because they've finally realized how much they treated me like an adult when they babied her. they offer to pay my rent, send me money for groceries, pay for car repairs, etc - which they never did until just this year when my sister got into college and I think they finally realized that they had one daughter living with them who they still had to set alarms to remind to take her medication, and one daughter with a full time job, two cats, and a car, who paid for her own rent and groceries. the difference is not lost on them and they know I don't speak to my sister beyond when I see her for holidays. They're trying to support me more because they finally realized how differently they treated us. I'm not ungrateful, just unimpressed with how they're going about it. 

I also want to say that I struggle a lot with mental illness. I am depressed, dealt with stress induced psychosis and a drinking problem in highschool, and had many a bad relationship while under their roof - which they either didn't pay enough attention to notice or chose to ignore. it's not like I was far enough away to hide those issues from them - i was under their roof and they never bothered to ask what I was dealing with and so I didn't tell them. They were too focused on my sister. they are also visibly more affectionate with her than me. I've felt the distance between me and my parents for a long time, and it doesn't bother me. I'm happy to take the money they offer me and live my life and just thank the universe that I'm not the one with a chore chart on the wall. The one time they finally notice how I'm feeling (resentful towards what they do for her versus how I was treated), they throw money at the problem rather than just sit down and have a conversation with me about it, because that would require trying to connect with me on an emotional level and they apparently only have it in them to do that with my sister. I also have a brother but he's 12 and I'm just hoping he grows up with more support than I did. 

TDLR; my autistic sister is completely dependent on my parents and i resent her for it, and they try and fix the resentment by throwing money at me which they didn't do until they realized how differently the two of us grew up.",1,1768352707.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

Had an extremely unexpected event happen today that goes to show that sometimes the universe has a sick sense of cosmic humor.

As a quick backstory, I graduated college back in 2012. Wasn’t my favorite time in my life, but I certainly had some fun. One of those instances happened at a friend’s party, where a group of extended friends were present as well. I did my fair share of mingling and happened to get into a good conversation with one of the ladies there. We actually connected across the board in our interests, plus she was damn attractive and certainly out of what I consider my league. Somehow, someway, she was feeling it too, and long story short, we spent a very (VERY) intimate night together. The next morning she left, and for no real reason (actually probably because I was too dumb to do anything about it), we never really connected again after that.

Well 13 years have past since then and life has been pretty great. I have a great job, great friends, great dog, great house, and I love my wife of 10 years. In fact, I am in my final semester of grad school, which will allow me to take another huge step up in my company. 90% of it has been online, but I have one class I need to attend in person this semester.

I stopped by campus today to pick up a new ID card and generally get a sense of the campus nowadays. Turns out it’s barely changed, and I was pretty much intoxicated with nostalgia. I was meandering around reliving memories of the old days, and walked over to my favorite cafe I had spent many, many days at studying. Ordered a coffee and sandwich, and was waiting there peacefully when I felt a tapping on my shoulder, followed by a “hello stranger”. In the following microseconds, I ran through countless possibilities of who it could be. Of all of them, I did not expect to be face to face with my old fling. 

My stomach dropped and my heart stopped for a second. I was just so flabbergasted that she was here, given the amount of time that had passed, and the fact the semester hasn’t even started. After stumbling through a hello, I managed to ask “what are you doing here?” Turns out she works as a grant program coordinator for the school, and her office is right near the cafe. She was on lunch and suggested we grab a table, which I didn’t really have an excuse not to. I was just in such a weird head space, with a mix of nostalgia, utter confusion, and shame that this was inappropriate given our past and the fact I’m married. At the same time, it was only as weird as I made it, and figured it was just a friendly conversation. 

If that wasn’t messy enough, it turns out she’s still a very cool person and a very attractive person. We both had the sense not to mention that night, but we kinda brushed on topics we talked about that night. I started to feel this was definitely going in a direction I should not go down, so I managed to sort of wrap up the conversation. However, she gave me a hug at the end and said we should definitely meet up while I am on campus since she’s right there and my class lets out right at lunch.

So - what are my choices here? Obviously I would say don’t start hanging out with this old fling as that would be fucked up to my wife. But that would kind of make me an asshole because this woman is just trying to be friendly, and I don’t really have an excuse to avoid her for the next 6 months. A normal mature adult should have no problem being purely platonic and professional. But the tiniest of embers from the past are there, and I really don’t want to fan the flames.

So far I've noticed: 
- No plastic wrap on the white part of table like their YouTube shows so had to clean off the table before putting sand in. 
- Glass was in a plastic bag loosely so had to clean the inside and outside of it.
- Only two bags of sand but I think others got 3 bags?
- No cable management magnets like their YouTube shows.
- Excessive wear on the outer bottom edges of table.
-Knocking noises, even on low speed, while drawing but no noise when it's cleaning the drawing. 
- LED lights aren't RGBWIC but seem to be RGBIC. (RGBWWIC would have really been clutch for $15 extra)
- The LED silicone is not diffusing the LED enough so you can see the individual LEDs when sitting down 😔 Compare that to the silicone & high density Govee used on their floor lamp 2 where you cannot see a single LED at all.
- LED mode 'follow ball' doesn't follow the ball but is either in front of it or behind it.
- Changing the LED colors or mode can sometimes take 6 seconds. First world problem I admit but would it have been that much more money to put in 5ghz Wi-Fi & matter support?
- Instructions stated to spread sand across the table. The reality is the sand should not have been spread into the 1.75"" no go outter edge zones because now there's just random uneven sand in that no go zone area the ball doesn't reach. 
Not too big of a deal since I can lift the glass off and take a tiny broom 🧹 & push it back into the ""green"" zone area but would have been good to know prior.

- Holes for the legs didn't line up with holes for the table so I had to get creative & pilot my own holes.

I (29F) have a best friend, Isabella (29F) who is planning a wedding with her boyfriend Mason (29M). Why do I say boyfriend and not fiancé, you ask? Great question- they AREN’T EVEN ENGAGED YET. And that isn’t even the biggest issue I have with this. I understand wedding planning has to be done well in advance and if you want certain dates/vendors/photographers etc you have to lock it down early, and I am sure they have discussed getting engaged, so booking stuff prior to officially getting engaged isn’t the craziest thing ever. But I guess I would have been less apprehensive had he actually proposed? 

Anyway, that aside, I don’t think she should be marrying him at all. For starters, he’s been unemployed the majority of the relationship. Not because he’s incapable of working- he “doesn’t like having a boss”. So he just refused to get a job where he would have a boss, but then did nothing. He “started his own private investment business” and by that he means he is day trading in the stock market. During all of this, Isabella got pregnant. He was very supportive but again kept making comments about being worried affording everything. I thought maybe this would push him to get a job, but no, he remained unemployed her entire pregnancy. 

Mind you, Isabella was going through nursing school when she got pregnant and WAS STILL WORKING PART TIME AS A CNA, had the baby around graduation, took her maternity leave and then started working her new RN job full time immediately after. 

Which brings me to the next issue- he did end up getting a job when Isabella went back to work because he was staying home with the baby and realized how much work a baby is on your own. So he got a job literally because he couldn’t take care of his own kid. The job he got- selling used cars for his parent’s car lot. So mommy and daddy stepped in so baby boy didn’t have to have a real boss or a real job. And now they have to pay for daycare because he only works when Isabella does, so he never has to take care of the baby alone. 

Enough red flags yet? There’s more! The loans he got they used mostly for baby stuff/rent etc. not for his “business”. But he still wants to do the day trading because he thinks he’s so god damn smart he can be the first person ever to hit it big doing that 🙄🙄🙄 so he had Isabella take out a loan FOR HIM- because you know his credit score is shit and he already has too much debt no bank would loan him money. So he asked Isabella to do it, and because she is a lovely person and too nice to him she did. For ~30k. That SHE IS NOW PAYING FOR. He’s not even paying her for it. And he has made no actual money from this day trading hobby. 

I would be SO happy to proven wrong and him to get lucky and make money off this, but let be for fkn real and maybe not take loans out to gamble it. 

Money mismanagement aside, he’s also very controlling. I feel like everything they do is because that’s what he wants. The loans and putting the baby in daycare were all his idea. Whenever we hang out at their house he gets really protective over the baby, doesn’t like to let us (her friend from grade school) hold the baby. Isabella was feeding and he kept saying “okay that’s enough” and “okay she’s done” when the baby was clearly fine and having a grand time eating food. One time we hung out we were reminiscing about college and a girls trip we went on where we ended up hanging out with some guys we met at a restaurant (they ended up being the most wholesome nicest guys ever- we were the bad influences trying to get them to drink and party and they didn’t, just kept the bonfire alive and never once made moves on us). I later found out after this night they got in a blow out fight because he was mad we talked about that in front of him, claiming it was “disrespectful” for us to talk about other guys in front of our currents partners. Isabella also lied about how she knew someone in one of our photos because it was her exes sister and she couldn’t say that in front of him. 

I am sure there is more that goes on that she doesn’t tell me about, but this is what I’ve observed. And I do think she doesn’t tell me everything because she knows it’s bad and doesn’t want her friends to know. 

I just love her so much and I wish she would see how much work and effort she has put into this relationship and family and life they have when he’s done the bare minimum. And she will say “he’s the best guys I’ve ever been with” which is unfortunately true because her previous boyfriends have set the bar in literal hell. One cheated on her the entire time, one was verbally (and almost physically abusive) and we had to secretly move her out of their house together while he wasn’t home- we had about 2 hours and he came looking for her after 😩

SO- all that said, I am having coffee with her tomorrow and am wondering how I bring this up to her? What could I say to at least have her post-pone the wedding until he gets his act together? They have a kid together so she is stuck with him, but it does NOT mean they have to get married, especially so quickly (wedding is planned for October). I want her to know I will support her no matter what and if this is truly what she wants then I will be there, but I also feel like the rushed wedding is his idea because he thinks they need to be married now that they have a baby together. 

I’m worried saying something won’t change anything, and I’ll just look like an ass pointing out how shitty her boyfriend is. But pretending to be happy for her and saying nothing feels super fake and I don’t want to do that either. ",1,1768352284.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

Yes. That’s it exactly.

My thoughts can move. My attention can widen.
I can hear things, notice motion, feel the room.
And I can still think clearly at the same time.

That’s the difference.

From Doormat to Tycoon: The Rise of the Useless Husband

""You disgust me.""

Damon glared at the woman standing before him—his wife, Serena. The woman he had once loved and cherished, now looking at him with cold indifference.

His fists clenched, his jaw tight with anger.

Across from him, Serena crossed her arms, her expression unreadable. ""Lower your voice, Damon,"" she said, sounding annoyed rather than guilty. ""There's no need for this drama.""

""No need?"" Damon's voice was sharp with disbelief. ""I just caught my wife cheating, and you expect me to stay calm?"" He stepped closer, his eyes burning into hers. ""How long, Serena? How long have you been making a fool out of me?""

Just moments ago, Damon had received photos from his subordinate, Anthony. Pictures of Serena and another man entering a hotel room—intimate, undeniable proof of her betrayal. He had trusted her completely, never once imagining he'd see her like that with another man.

But now, she wasn't even denying it.

Serena sighed, as if bored with the conversation already. ""Does it even matter? We were bound to end anyway, Damon. I was just waiting for the right moment.""

""The right moment?"" His anger turned ice-cold. ""You were waiting for the right moment to betray me?""

Serena let out a short laugh and shook her head. ""Don’t be so dramatic. It’s not betrayal. It’s just… moving on.""

Damon stared at her, his fury twisting into something more painful. ""Moving on? Is that what you call sleeping with another man behind my back?""

Serena rolled her eyes. ""I won’t apologize for doing what’s best for me. You and I both know this marriage has been pointless for a long time."" She lifted her chin, her voice unwavering. ""I want a divorce, Damon.""

For a moment, everything went silent. The words hung in the air, heavy and suffocating.

Damon took a slow breath, trying to control the storm raging inside him. ""So that’s it? You’re throwing me away like I meant nothing?""

Serena smirked slightly. ""You already are nothing, Damon."" She tilted her head, her gaze sharp. ""Be honest with yourself. What have you really done for me all these years? Your existence has been nothing but a burden.""

Damon’s hands trembled—not from weakness, but from the sheer force of the betrayal cutting through him. ""A burden?"" His voice was dangerously quiet. ""Serena, I’ve done everything for you.""

She scoffed. ""Oh, please. Don’t act like you’ve been some great husband. My success? That was my doing, not yours. You had nothing to do with it.""

Damon let out a bitter laugh. ""Nothing to do with it?""

Serena sighed, clearly impatient. ""Look, Damon. I’m with someone else now. Someone who can actually take me to the top.""

His stomach twisted, but he forced himself to stay composed. ""Michael, right?"" He said bitterly. Michael was the man in the photos—the one Serena had betrayed him with.

Her smirk widened. ""Smart man.""

Damon clenched his fists so hard his nails dug into his palms. ""You really think he's the reason you just landed that partnership with Vespera Corporation?""

Serena shrugged. ""Of course. Who else could have made it happen? Michael has connections with the biggest names in the industry. Thanks to him, Vespera Corporation agreed to the deal. With this contract, my company will rise to the top, and nothing will stop me.""

He stared at her, unreadable. Then, a dark chuckle slipped past his lips. “You really believe that?”

Her brows drew together. “What are you getting at?”

Damon stepped forward, his voice dropping to a cold murmur. “Have you ever bothered to ask who the chairman of Vespera Corporation is?”

She blinked, hesitating. Then scoffed. “What does that matter?”

A cruel smile tugged at his mouth. “Everything.”

She rolled her eyes. “Oh, don’t tell me it’s you. Save me the fantasy, Damon. You’ve always been a nobody. Don’t embarrass yourself!”

“Is that what you think?” he murmured, his voice almost amused.

In truth, he was the chairman of Vespera Corporation. Every major deal Serena thought Michael had secured for her—those so-called connections—had actually come through him.

He had once planned to tell her everything after this deal was made.

But now? There was no longer any reason to.

“Enough!” she snapped, yanking a stack of documents from her bag and tossing them at him. “I’m done with your games. Sign the divorce and get out of my life.”

Damon looked down at the papers, his chest tight with betrayal. Then slowly, he picked up a pen.

“As you wish.”

Without hesitation, he signed, then tossed the documents back onto the table.

And without another word, he turned and walked out, the door clicking softly behind him.

And then—the world shifted.

As Damon stepped into the night, the air itself seemed to bow before him. A fleet of armored black Bentleys lined the driveway, engines purring like restrained beasts.

Flanking them stood two dozen elite bodyguards—towering figures in tailored black suits, their faces impassive, their presence radiating lethal precision.

The moment his foot touched the pavement, they moved as one.

""Good evening, Boss!""

The synchronized greeting thundered through the night, every man bowing at a perfect 45-degree angle, their voices a unified roar of absolute loyalty.

Chapter two:

Damon stepped into the sleek black car, his face cold and unreadable.

Just as the driver pulled onto the road, his phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen—it was Anthony, the CEO of Vespera Corporation and one of his most trusted men. Damon answered the call, his voice calm but distant.

""Sir, should we terminate the collaboration with Ms. Serena?"" Anthony’s voice was steady, but Damon knew he was waiting for his reaction. He already knew what had happened.

For a moment, Damon considered it. It would be the easiest way to show Serena what she had truly lost. Cutting off her company would be simple—like snapping a branch with his fingers. Without his silent support, she wouldn’t last long in this industry.

His grip on the phone tightened slightly, but then he let out a slow breath. ""No need,"" he said flatly.

There was no point in wasting his energy on revenge. She had already taken enough from him—his time, his patience, his trust. He wouldn’t give her another second of his life. Besides, Vespera Corporation was just one of the hundreds of companies under his name. That deal meant nothing to him.

Damon leaned back against the smooth leather seat, his gaze shifting toward the window. Outside, the city lights flickered against the dark sky. But his mind wasn’t in the present anymore. It was drifting into the past.

---

Many years ago, Damon had been expelled from his family. He was just a child at the time—too young to understand the full extent of the internal conflicts in his family, yet old enough to feel the pain of being cast aside. He had been thrown onto the streets with nothing, left to fend for himself in a world that had no mercy for the weak.

He still remembered those days vividly. The hunger. The bruises. The thugs who chased him down dark alleys, thinking he was an easy target. He had been on the verge of collapse, his body weak from starvation, when she appeared.

A girl.

She was just a silhouette against the dim streetlights, but to him, she was an angel. She had given him food—just a small piece of bread, but at that moment, it was everything. She had saved his life.

Damon had wanted to thank her, to give her something in return. The only thing he had left was a ring—one of a pair that had belonged to his late mother. It was the only thing he had taken with him when he was forced to leave his home. He gave it to her without hesitation, not realizing how important that moment would become in his life.

That night changed everything.

Not long after, he met a mysterious old man—a man who saw something in him that no one else did. Under his guidance, Damon was reborn. He was taught everything: strategy, business, power. He learned how to survive in a world where only the strongest thrived.

Years passed, and he built an empire. Kings and billionaires bowed before him. World leaders sought his favor. He had become a force no one could challenge.

And yet, despite all the power he had gained, there was one thing he had never been able to reclaim—the truth about his mother’s death.

He knew it wasn’t an accident. It couldn’t have been.

So he disappeared from the public eye. Stayed out of the spotlight.

All the while, his men were digging. Quietly. Relentlessly.

And when he finally uncovered the names behind it all?

They were gonna pay.

And there was something else he couldn’t let go of—the little girl who’d saved him years ago.

She’d stuck in his mind, like a piece of his past he couldn’t shake.

He’d spent years looking for her, hoping to find her again. Then, three years ago, his team finally tracked her down through that ring he left to her.

That girl was Serena.

That was why he married her.

Damon clenched his jaw. He had given her everything, even from the shadows. He had supported her, helped her build her company without her even realizing it. He had believed she was different. But she had proven him wrong.

The debt was settled. She had saved him once, and he had repaid her a thousand times over. But now, she had made her choice.

There would be no turning back.

His thoughts were interrupted when Anthony spoke again, realizing Damon had gone silent.

""Boss.""

Damon straightened in his seat, his fingers tightening around his phone. ""What is it?""

""Simon found something,"" Anthony said, his tone serious.

Damon’s brows furrowed slightly. Simon was the president of the city's largest chamber of commerce—and one of his most trusted subordinates.

""And it's about your mother.""

Damon sat up completely, his body going rigid. His heart pounded once, hard, before settling into a steady but tense rhythm.

""Go on,"" he said, his voice dangerously low.

""A lead. It’s not much, but it might finally open some doors,"" Anthony explained. ""I’ve reserved the top floor of Luxea Restaurant for a private meeting. Simon said you and he need to talk in person.""

At first, Damon had no interest in a dinner meeting. But when he heard there were clues about his mother’s death, he immediately agreed.

For a moment, Damon didn’t respond. He had spent years searching, digging through lies and deception, trying to uncover the truth about his mother’s death. Every time he got close, the trail went cold.

And now, after all this time, there was finally progress.

""I'm on my way,"" he said without hesitation.

The call ended, but his mind was already racing.

Another thought crossed his mind.

There was still one thing left to do.

His mother’s rings.

They were still in Serena’s house. He’d have to return for them later—one last time.

Damon’s jaw tightened. Those rings weren’t just some piece of jewelry. They were the last connection he had to the only woman who had ever truly loved him. The only woman who had ever sacrificed for him.

And now…

Serena despised him so much that he no longer wanted to be involved with her in any way. The help he had given her over the years was his repayment for her saving him.

Serena had already severed ties with him. She had chosen to betray him, to throw away everything they had.

Now, he would do the same.

Chapter three:

""His belongings are as worthless as he is,"" Serena muttered under her breath, flinging another shirt into the trash bag.

The apartment was eerily quiet without Damon’s presence, but her mind was anything but calm. Her hands worked furiously, grabbing every trace of him—his clothes, his cologne bottle, even the coffee mug he had insisted on bringing from his old apartment. Every item, every memory, she tossed away with rough, jerky movements.

Then her fingers brushed against something cold.

She stilled.

It was a ring.

Serena frowned, picking it up between her fingers. It wasn’t just any ring. It was familiar.

The delicate patterns, the design—

It was identical to the one she had taken years ago from Celia!

Her breath caught in her throat.

She swallowed hard, her mind suddenly yanked into the past.

Celia.

They had been best friends, inseparable during their school days. Matching clothes, inside jokes that no one else understood. But time had changed everything. Celia’s family had faced hardships,their business crumbled, and their friendship had drifted, like a boat losing its anchor.

Serena had visited Celia’s house one day before life pulled them apart. She remembered that visit vividly. Celia had been distracted, speaking about something serious, but Serena’s eyes had landed on a ring. Unique, delicate, beautiful. She had taken it on a whim, thinking Celia wouldn’t find it.

And she hadn’t. Or maybe she had but never said anything.

However, after a while Serena lost interest in the ring after that—tossed it into a drawer.

And now, another one had appeared.

Her hands clenched around it as a dark thought took root.

Did Damon have an affair with Celia?!

She exhaled sharply. Her blood simmered.

How dare he betray her—he, who couldn’t even afford his next meal without her help?

Furiously, without hesitation, she reached for her phone, her fingers gripping it tightly. She was about to dial Damon’s number, demanding an explanation,now.

The phone rang before she could press call.

The screen lit up.

Mom.

She answered it.

“Hello?”

“Serena! Finally, I was starting to think you’d disappeared!” Her mother’s voice was unnaturally cheerful, instantly putting Serena on edge.

She swallowed down her turmoil. “I’ve been busy.”

“Well, you won’t be too busy tonight, I hope,” her mother continued. “Because we have something important to celebrate.”

Serena frowned. “Celebrate?”

“Oh, don’t pretend you forgot! Your divorce is finally finalized! No more Damon. That man was a burden, and I’m relieved you’ve come to your senses.”

Serena’s grip tightened on the phone. She hated Damon with everything inside her.

“And,” her mother added, “Michael has arranged something special for you. He booked a table at Luxea Restaurant—the best restaurant in the city. It’s exclusive, Serena. You should feel honored.”

Michael.

Serena’s eyes immediately lit up at the name. What else could make her happier? Michael was the only man who could lift her to the top with just a tip of his finger. With a single word from him, she had secured a partnership with Vespera Corporation.

“Michael wanted to celebrate with you for securing the partnership with Vespera Corporation. Even though he's the one who helped you, he’s so kind, Serena,” her mother said excitedly. Serena couldn’t keep the smile off her face.

“I know, Mom. You made me make the right choice,” Serena said, practically jumping with happiness.

“You almost declined Michael because of that trash! I’m so glad you changed your mind. Look where Michael has taken you—to the top, my dear. I’m glad I convinced you.”

“Thank you so much, Mom. You’re the best.”

“Now, you don’t want to be late. Get dressed and come to Luxea Restaurant. We can’t keep Michael waiting! A man like him should never be kept waiting—he’s our god now, Serena. Quickly, get dressed.”

“Okay, Mom. I’ll be there before you even know it,” Serena said.

“Wear something seductive and stunning. You should look stunning tonight, Serena.” her mother added.

“Okay, Mom, I get it. Bye. I should quickly get dressed,” Serena said, ending the call. The happiest look spread across her face as she pushed aside the thought of the ring and excitedly rushed inside to get ready.

---

Cars stopped near Luxea Restaurant, and in the second car, a guard quickly stepped out to open the door of the first car.

Damon stepped out.

He didn’t spare the scenery a glance—his mind was on one thing: what Simon had uncovered about his mother’s death.

He headed toward the restaurant, his guards instinctively falling in behind him.

""Wait outside. I’ll go in alone,"" Damon ordered.

The guards stopped at his word, and Damon continued on toward the grand entrance. But just as he reached the doors, a security guard stepped forward, blocking his path.

“Membership card?” the guard asked flatly.

His eyes ran over Damon’s appearance—simple clothes, no flashy accessories. Nothing that screamed “VIP.” The guard’s lips curled slightly in disdain.

Damon arched a brow. “I don’t have one.”

He had dined here before with Anthony—no one had ever mentioned a membership card then.

The guard's stance stiffened. His tone turned dismissive, almost scornful. “This place is for members only. No card, no entry. Now move along.”

His gaze was sharp, judgmental—as if Damon were some vagrant trying to sneak into a palace.

Damon’s expression remained unreadable, but the air around him shifted. Cooler. Sharper.

“I’m invited by—”

Before he could finish, a mocking voice rang out behind him.

“Oh, look who we have here—my ex-useless son-in-law!”

Damon turned immediately, smirking. Tessa, Serena’s mother, stood there, looking smug.

She was here too. Not that it mattered to Damon.

Tessa approached, her eyes gleaming with malice.

""What is a useless man like you doing in a place like this? Are you trying to sneak your miserable self inside? Trying to scam your way in, pretending to be a wealthy man? It’s called theft, Damon. You still haven’t changed. You’re a thief!"" she yelled loudly, drawing attention from people.

But Damon just stared at the foolish woman in front of him.

Like mother, like daughter.

Tessa eyed him up and down and smirked. “You know what? My future son-in-law—the only man worthy of my daughter—is a platinum member of this restaurant. He doesn’t have to fake his way in.”

She let out a mocking laugh as the murmurs and chuckles of the crowd surrounded them.

Chapter four:

Damon stood still, his sharp eyes locked onto Tessa. She smirked in satisfaction, her gaze filled with arrogance. Around them, whispers floated through the air.

But Damon wasn’t interested in giving Tessa the reaction she wanted. He had no intention of arguing with her. He simply reached into his pocket, pulled out his phone, and dialed a number.

The call barely rang before a voice answered.

“Hello, Boss?” Anthony’s voice carried a hint of surprise as if he hadn’t expected a call from Damon at this moment.

Damon’s tone was cold. “ I’m outside Luxea. But the staff seem to think I'm not qualified to enter.“

There was a brief pause. Then Anthony’s voice came back, now laced with panic. “Who dared to stop you! I’ll handle it immediately!”

Before Damon could respond, Tessa let out a loud, exaggerated laugh.

Heads turned. The sound of her laughter echoed, drawing more attention to the scene.

“Oh, are you calling for help, Damon?” she mocked, crossing her arms as she shook her head. “Are you pretending to be important again? You think making fake calls will change anything? You’re just a worthless man, a gold digger, a parasite! I should expose you for who you really are.”

She took a step closer, her voice dripping with disdain. “My daughter fed you, clothed you, and took care of you for years while you brought nothing to the table. And what did you do in return? Nothing! You’re still the same useless man, pretending to be someone important.”

The security guards, hearing Tessa’s words, exchanged glances. They straightened their postures, now fully convinced that Damon was just another desperate man trying to sneak his way into a place meant for the elite.

One of the guards stepped forward, his expression blank but firm. “Sir, if you don’t leave now, we’ll have to chase you out.”

Damon didn’t react. He simply exhaled slowly and slid his phone back into his pocket. His face remained unreadable.

“Touch me,” he said, his voice dangerously low, “and you’ll regret it.”

The guards hesitated. There was something about the way he spoke—calm, yet commanding—that made them uneasy.

Tessa, however, wasn’t fazed. She rolled her eyes and gestured impatiently. “Throw him out! He's a useless poor man!”

The guards moved.

But just as they reached for him, a sharp voice rang out from the entrance.

“Stop! What are you doing?!”

The sudden command froze everyone in place.

A man in a crisp black suit rushed out of the restaurant. His forehead was lined with stress, his breathing uneven as if he had run all the way. The golden name tag on his chest read Manager Vincent.

The moment he spotted Damon, his face turned pale.

He hurried forward, his voice filled with urgency. “Mr. Damon! I sincerely apologize for this offense!”

Tessa’s smirk faded.

The guards glanced at each other in confusion.

Damon remained still, his gaze unreadable.

Vincent turned sharply to the security guards. His face darkened with anger. “Do you know who this is? Who gave you permission to treat a guest this way?”

The lead guard hesitated, glancing at Tessa for direction. “We were told—”

“You were told?” Vincent snapped, cutting him off. “And you just blindly followed orders without verifying? If Mr. Damon was truly insulted by this treatment, you’d all be out of a job right now!”

The guards stiffened. The color drained from their faces.

Damon remained silent, watching the scene unfold with mild amusement.

Vincent turned back to him and gave a small bow. “Sir, please allow me to personally escort you inside. This will never happen again.”

Tessa’s face twisted with anger.

“Wait, what?!” she burst out, stepping forward. “You’re letting him in? That’s ridiculous! I know this man! He’s my ex-son-in-law! He’s a nobody! He doesn’t belong here!”

Vincent remained composed, his expression unreadable. “That is irrelevant, ma’am. This is about Mr. Damon.”

Tessa scoffed, raising her voice. “Do you even know who my future son-in-law is? Michael is a platinum member here! If anyone should get special treatment, it’s us! I demand you remove him immediately!”

Vincent’s eyes darkened.

His voice was cold as he turned to the guards. “Do not let her enter anymore.”

Tessa gasped. “You—You can’t do that!”

Vincent remained unfazed. “And Ma’am… I suggest you lower your voice. If you continue causing a scene, we will have no choice but to revoke your son-in-law’s membership.”

Tessa froze.

For the first time that evening, real fear flickered across her face.

Around them, onlookers whispered among themselves. Some chuckled quietly, enjoying the spectacle of a woman who had been so loud moments ago now silenced.

Damon finally adjusted his cuffs and spoke for the first time since Vincent arrived.

“Seems like you underestimated me again, Tessa.”

Tessa clenched her fists. Her nails dug into her palms as she swallowed back the rage burning in her chest.

“This isn't right, he's a nobody,” she hissed under her breath.

Ignoring her, Vincent stepped aside and gestured toward the entrance. “Please, Mr. Damon, allow me to lead the way.”

Damon smirked slightly before stepping past Tessa without a second glance.

Tessa stood frozen in place, unable to move or speak, as if she were trapped in a dream. But she knew all too well—this wasn’t a dream. It was real.

The murmurs of the crowd surrounded her and laughing at her.

And she hated it.

The guards stood still, not moving, refusing to let her in. She paced back and forth, her heels clicking against the pavement.

Gritting her teeth, she took out her phone and dialed Serena’s number.

“Serena, I can’t believe this!” Tessa’s voice was sharp, cutting through the silence outside the restaurant.

Her face was red with anger, her hands waving as she spoke into her phone.

Serena’s voice came through the phone, finding it hard to believe what she just heard. “Mom, calm down. What exactly happened?”

“That useless man—Damon—got inside! Can you believe it? After everything I said, after I told them the truth about who he really is, they still let him in! But me? I’m stuck out here like some nobody!”

Serena’s eyes widened. “Are you sure, Mom? Damon is really here?”

Chapter five:

“Yes, Serena! Why would I lie? Do something now!Talk to Michael. Tell him to talk to the manager. I’m not standing out here like some beggar! This is humiliating! My future son-in-law is a platinum member of this restaurant—I have every right to be inside!” Tessa shouted.

“Mom, I’ll tell him right away. We’ll get you inside, and they’ll regret treating you like this. Just wait a few minutes,” Serena said before ending the call, her voice filled with anger.

She slammed her glass down, startling Michael, who sat across from her. “Damon followed me here. I knew it. That leech doesn’t know when to give up! And my mother is stuck outside now because of him. God knows what trick he used!”

Michael raised a brow, his voice calm but laced with arrogance. “Don’t worry. The manager here, Vincent, is a friend. I’ll get your mother in. And that trash? We’ll deal with him later.”

Serena felt a small spark of satisfaction. Michael won’t let this go. They’ll regret it.

Michael pulled out his phone with practiced confidence and dialed.

The line connected.

“Michael, this better not be about that woman outside,” Vincent’s voice snapped through the speaker, sharp and unamused.

Michael blinked. “It is. That’s my fiancée’s mother. Just let her in—”

“She’s making a scene. And frankly, I’m already regretting letting you in tonight,” Vincent growled. “Do you even know who’s here?”

Michael frowned. “Some VIP, I assume?”

“Not just any VIP,” Vincent hissed. “Simon Scott and the CEO of Vespera Corporation are hosting someone even more important upstairs. I’m not risking that guest’s experience over your girlfriend’s mother!”

“One more outburst from her, not only will she be banned, you and your little girlfriend are out too. Permanently.”

The call cut.

Michael stared at his phone for a beat, his face stormy.

Simon Scott was not just anyone. He was the president of the city's largest chamber of commerce, and the right-hand man of one of the most influential figures in the business world. And the CEO of Vespera Corporation? That was a man who held the power to make or break careers.

They were someone he could not afford to offend. And here he was, dragged into unnecessary trouble because of Serena’s mother’s arrogance!

He turned sharply to Serena. “Tell your mother to go home. Now.”

Serena’s brows furrowed. “What? Michael, she’ll lose it—”

“If she doesn’t leave, we’re getting kicked out too. The CEO of Vespera Corporation is here. And someone even more powerful than him. Do you want to lose your deal?”

Serena hesitated, her nails digging into her palm. “No… of course not.”

“Then make the call.”

She nodded stiffly and pressed dial.

“Mom,” she said as soon as the line picked up, her voice low and tight. “You need to leave. Now.”

“What?! Serena, are you out of your mind?!”

“If you don’t go now, Michael’s membership will be revoked. The manager’s furious. There are important people here—people who could end my partnership with Vespera.”

Tessa gasped. “That’s not my problem—”

“If you don’t leave now,” Serena snapped, “don’t bother calling me again. You’ve embarrassed me enough.”

Silence.

Then a bitter huff. “Fine. But you owe me this.”

The call ended.

Serena dropped the phone onto the table, exhaling slowly.

“She’s gone,” she muttered.

Michael nodded, tension easing slightly. “Good.”

They sat in silence for a moment before curiosity crept back into Serena’s voice.

“Who do you think the third guest is?”

Michael’s eyes gleamed. “Someone big. If the CEO of Vespera and Simon Scott are acting like assistants tonight, that person must have real power.”

Serena’s gaze turned thoughtful. “If we could just meet him…”

Michael smirked. “If we play it right tonight, maybe we will.”

Serena’s eyes narrowed. “And meanwhile, that trash Damon just walks in like a king.”

Michael chuckled. “Forget him. He’s nothing. But that VIP? That’s someone worth chasing.”

Meanwhile, at the top floor of the restaurant.

“Where is Boss? Are they still making him wait?” Anthony’s voice was low as he glanced at the elevator. He paced the room, his fists clenched, barely holding back his frustration.

Simon sat calmly at the table, his fingers pressed together, looking thoughtful. “Relax, Anthony. He’ll be here soon. I’m sure the manager has taken care of it.”

“Relax?” Anthony snapped, turning to Simon. “Boss isn’t the kind of man who likes to be kept waiting or made angry.”

Simon raised an eyebrow, still calm. “If they were making him wait and upsetting him, he would have called you again by now.”

Anthony glared at him but said nothing. He just kept pacing, fear clear in every step.

The elevator dinged softly, and both men turned as the doors slid open. Damon stepped out, his presence filling the room. His face was calm, but there was a sharpness in his eyes that made Anthony stand up straight immediately.

“Boss,” Anthony said with a slight bow, his voice tight with relief. “You’re here.”

Chapter six:

Damon nodded, his gaze sweeping the room before landing on Simon. “Simon,” he said, his voice calm but full of authority. “I hope you have something worth my time.”

Simon stood with a faint smile on his lips. “Always a pleasure. Please, sit. I've gathered new information about your mother's death.It's not much, but it's... significant.”

Damon walked to the table, his movements slow and controlled. He sat down, his sharp eyes locked on Simon. “Talk.”

Simon leaned in, speaking quietly. “ Two days before the accident happened to your mom, she got a call from someone flagged in a database—an ex-military guy with ties to a security firm. The call was erased from her phone records, but I managed to get a trace from the telecom company.”

Damon’s hands clenched on the table. “Who did this?”

“I don’t have a name yet, but it leads to a fake company—Tarnex Holdings. It’s a cover, and it’s linked to someone powerful enough to hide everything.”

Damon’s voice turned cold. “I want everything. Every name, every connection, every detail. No more pieces. I want the whole truth.”

Simon nodded. “I’m working on it. But whoever did this isn’t just rich. They have power. Influence and legal. The kind of power that quietly gets rid of people.”

Damon’s lips curled into a dangerous smile. ""Regardless of how powerful they are, I'll uncover who’s behind this.""

The room fell silent, Damon’s words hanging heavy in the air. Anthony stood by the window, arms crossed, his expression tense. He knew better than to interrupt, but the tension in the room was thick.

After they finished their meal, Damon stood up, moving smoothly. “Keep me updated, Simon. I expect results.”

Simon nodded seriously. “You’ll get them.”

Damon turned and walked toward the elevator. Anthony followed quickly, but before he could step in, Damon stopped him.

“I’ll leave first,” Damon said and entered the elevator.

The ride down was silent. When the doors opened, Damon stepped out, but to his surprise, Serena and Michael were standing near the entrance.

“Damon?!”

The voice was sharp, full of disbelief. Damon's face was calm as he met Serena’s gaze. She stood a few feet away, arms crossed, eyes narrowed.

“What are you doing here?” she demanded, suspicion in her voice.

Damon raised an eyebrow, his tone calm but dismissive. “Eating. What else?”

Serena’s eyes narrowed more, her disbelief turning to anger. “Don’t lie to me, Damon. You’re not here to eat. You’re following me, aren’t you?”

Damon smirked, his voice mocking. “Following you? Don’t flatter yourself, Serena. I have better things to do.”

Serena’s face turned red with anger, her fists clenching. “You’re such a liar. You don’t even belong here. How did you get in? Did you sneak in? Or did you beg someone to let you in?”

Damon’s face stayed calm, but there was amusement in his eyes. “Believe what you want, Serena. It doesn’t change the fact that I’m here.”

Serena scoffed, her voice full of disdain. “Please. You’re not fooling anyone. You’re probably only allowed to stay in the lobby. You don’t even have the right to go upstairs.”

Damon’s smirk widened, his tone mocking. “And you do?”

Serena’s eyes flashed with anger, her voice rising. “Of course I do. Michael has a platinum card. We’re dining on the third floor. “

She scoffed, crossing her arms arrogantly, “ And you know what? The CEO of Vespera Corporation and Simon Scott, the president of the city’s business association, are dining on the top floor, entertaining a distinguished guest. Only people of our status can eat in the same restaurant with those important people. And you? You aren’t even qualified to clean the toilets here.”

Damon’s smile turned cold, his eyes sharp. “Is that so?”

Serena smirked, looking smug. “Yes, it is. So stop pretending to be something you’re not. You’re just a worthless man who doesn’t belong here.”

Michael had been smiling the whole time, watching Damon with disgust and amusement as Serena mocked him.

Then—

Damon laughed.

It was a low, quiet chuckle, one that sent a chill down their spines before they could even process why.

Michael’s smirk faltered. ""What’s so funny?""

Damon’s gaze sharpened, the amusement in his eyes cutting like a blade.

""That ‘distinguished guest’ they were entertaining?""

He took a step forward, lowering his voice slightly.

""That was me.""

I always thought they would feel a bit fake or like you were stuck in a bubble, disconnected from the place you came to see.

But after a recent trip to Sanya Bay, I’m honestly rethinking that idea.

I stayed near Mangrove Tree Resort World and the first impression was just how huge it is. Everything is there. Food, coffee, beach access, shops, places to sit and do nothing. At first I worried that I’d end up never leaving the area and miss out on anything local.

What actually happened was kind of the opposite. Since I don’t speak Chinese fluently, having all the basics sorted made the trip feel way less stressful. I didn’t have to overthink every meal or how to get around. I could relax, take long walks, and just enjoy being there instead of constantly planning.  
  
And whenever I wanted something more local, I just walked outside. Evening strolls along the promenade, people dancing, small food spots, families hanging out. It didn’t feel isolated at all, just convenient.  
  
So now I’m genuinely curious how others feel about this. Do mega resorts take something away from a destination, or do they actually make it easier to experience, especially in places where travel can feel intimidating?",1,1768352073.0,TravelTales,0,1.0,False

We exchanged numbers afterward and chatted briefly. Nothing inappropriate happened, just a sweet, respectful goodbye kiss. He seemed kind and thoughtful, and I appreciated how respectful he was overall.

Today I texted him to say I enjoyed meeting him and would be open to grabbing a coffee sometime; no pressure, no expectations. His response felt a bit neutral, not very enthusiastic, so I let it go and wished him well.

(She graduated in the class about two years earlier than my class is set to graduate.)

She, with a straight face, showed her schedule to us. She basically opened a monthly calendar, and literally every single day was blocked off due to “studying” for every single class. 

Nothing else. Studying every single day, 31 days a month. 

I remember she told us that there was ONE day in the year where she blocked off 1 half day to go to a football game because she really wanted to. She seemed to be implying that this was such a horrible idea, but she was OK with it. 

Um. I am sorry. Is this crazy to anyone else? She graduated #1 and took the bar, passed, and works in a nice firm.

However, if you’re truly expanding your connections and life experiences, you can’t live like that. 

Let’s say instead of doing that. You use your time to volunteer at a legal aid, work, travel to law conferences, have coffee with judges and attorneys in your area, go to various places. I feel like these are the things that employers are interested in.

I felt like I might actually see them in that store, but didn’t really pay attention to this feeling. Then  when I was at the store looking for stuff to buy the same feeling came again but this time stronger. I thought  “what if X walked into that store right now…”, so unconsciously I turned my head towards the entrance and looked over there for a few secs. I was zoning out and then BOOM X came in..! I turned my head back so fast lol. After a few mins we were really close to each other and made eye contact.

Separated in 2023 and divorce started a few days later. Moved to a new city for the whole new life thing.

Signed up to tinder. Matched a girl who was much younger than me two messages in she asks “can you drive?” I can. She then says “can you pick me up?” I respond “physically or in my car?” She she says “car” and 20 minutes later I’ve got a girl in her twenties in my car and 30 minutes later you get the idea. Then she left on foot and unmatched me.

Thought that was fun. There’s got to be more than that. Talk to another girl for a few weeks. Exchange numbers. Meet up for a drink. End up at hers. Get a taxi in the morning. Unmatched and blocked by the time I got home. Is this all it is now

Then an ex from many years ago gets in touch. I always joked with her that I was the one that got away. We hung out a few times. Went the cinema. I think the kids call it a situationship. She wasn’t my girlfriend, she knew she was never going to be my girlfriend. I broke up with her like 20 years earlier to date her friend after getting drunk and cheating on her with her other friend. So more fool her for even talking to me if I’m honest. Anyway it just stopped after a bit. Shame as I enjoyed the friendship.

Took a break and I had gotten very sick. Still not sure I’m not sick, but no doctors seem concerned enough to do anything anymore.

Moved house again recently to a little village. Thought I’d try it out again. See what happens. Day 1 match an absolute 10. I mean 9.5 with no makeup and bed head hair but absolutely nuts. Super critical of everything I did, wore, ate, drank, etc. Wanted me to be someone completely different but the physical element of our time will hopefully be something the dementia lets me keep in my advancing years. After 2 weeks I ended it due to her behaviour. Upper right crazy/hot quadrant. Accused me of cheating on her with another woman but wouldn’t discuss if we were in a relationship and I physically couldn’t handle another woman. The flesh is weak.

Queue 7 more first dates from these soul crushing apps. Luckily not every one was physical as I was stacking them day on day. I’m talking back to back different women. I had 12 lined up and it was hard to keep track. I gave one my number to get off the app and I can’t remember her name now and I lost all my texts by accident. She’s in my phone book but so are a lot of other people as I’ve never deleted anyone ever.

In this last month I’ve been on dates with more women than the previous 10 years. On account of that marriage thing.

In my twenties this would have been great. Though I read the profiles, they say they want long term, some even state they don’t do ONS. Perfect. I meet them. It’s ONS or just boring coffee and the same chat. It’s just on repeat.

I met a girl this weekend I actually enjoyed my time with. Absolutely nothing physical. Just a good time. Messaged her and said I’m taking a break from the apps as I just can’t be scrolling through the catalogue any more and having this run of pointless conversations that lead to the same result over and over. Told her this is my number if she wants to get in touch and we can do something again drop me a message.

So is this really what I’m looking at now? Last time I “dated” I was in my twenties. You met people at places that don’t exist anymore. Now I feel like the women I match with are just looking for Click a Dick but pretend they want more.

That being said, we're wondering about having a few ""base"" cities to stay in and then taking some day trips to other places. Staying in Lisbon and Porto mostly and taking side trips. 

We land in Lisbon- 3 days Feb 24th-27th Trying to decide on day trips-Sintra or Evora?

Then we have Feb 27-march 2nd without a plan and are trying to decide between Coimbra (with a side trip to see some ancient ruins in Conimbriga if it's easy to get there) and Aveiro for those 3 days, but still need guidance and advice!

March 2nd-6th, we have a rented apartment/hotel in Porto and would like to see the Douro valley and do some winery tours and are willing to take day trips to wherever.

The next leg of the trip we don't have anything planned until we leave on the 11th. We could continue staying in Porto and taking more trips and looking at Braga, or heading back south towards Lisbon and possibly stopping at other towns along the way.

Trying to see what advice anyone would have on which cities/towns are worth visiting, and where we should see for those last 6 days before flying out of Lisbon? Wondering about Braga, Tomar, Coimbra, Aveiro, Evora, and Sintra specifically, but open to other places too! We're into food, wine, coffee, music(live music,fado included!),art(mostly outsider and street art), nature and history, so open to anything!

I've recently (about two/three weeks ago) gotten back into a calorie deficit with a goal of prioritizing protein and leaning out. It felt really nice- I was getting compliments that people saw change, I was noticing change myself, etc.

On Sunday, I went out with family and got Rissotto for dinner. Yesterday, I ate 144 g of protein, 1400 cals hoping it would help debloat. Today however, I feel the most bloated I've been in a bit. I look like I've reverted back to my old self, and although I know that's not true, it feels like it.

My meals:
Breakfast -
One slice gf bread
Two eggs
One cup cottage cheese
Two slices turkey

Lunch -
Two cups homemade turkey chili
Oikos cup
Reduced fat string cheese

Dinner -
Chicken
Steamed veggies
Edamame

Snacks -
Coffee
Prebiotic soda
Snap peas


Usually when I eat, I am mindful when it comes to Whole Foods (not all whole, but majority). However, I have a feeling that the bloat im getting is because of the massive amount of protein I've had yesterday and today....?

Any advice or feedback? I'm F23 5'5 132lbs

Back then,I was in my mid-20s and still in college. I worked in the City Chambers, in a small kiosk, alongside a gorgeous blonde woman, making coffee for city officials. The hall was cozy, with great views over the city.

At the time, my phone was a Sony Ericsson K770i, which I’d already been using for two or three years. Later that year, a friend passed down a Nokia N95 after upgrading to an iPhone 3GS.

My everyday carry included a 3rd-gen iPod, Koss Porta Pros, and a mid-2000s Canon PowerShot A550, originally bought for another college course a few years earlier. Everything lived in my black, Jamaica-themed Gola messenger bag.

Gordon Brown was PM. We were halfway through Obama’s first term. I had a head full of long black hair, was dirt poor, and the city still felt exciting—untamed around the edges, rough in places, especially near where I lived. That area had once been an independent town and served as the city’s port.

There’s still plenty of inequality and poverty, but it keeps getting pushed toward the outskirts and hidden pockets, making room for rich international students, posh twats from down south, and yet another Airbnb. The neighbourhood where my bike was repeatedly stolen from the stairwell—usually to fund a neighbour’s substance abuse—is now dotted with vintage shops, specialty cafés, and boulangeries. I moved out long ago.

This old laptop lived through all of it. Obama II, Trump I, Biden, and now we’re halfway through Trump II. Too many prime ministers to count. Fourteen years of austerity. Two referendums with grim outcomes for the country I live in. A pandemic. Seven years working in an art gallery. Being a postie during COVID. After the lockdowns, jobs in public affairs inside parliament and for some soulless corporate clients. Now I’m juggling three jobs so my missus and I can buy our first house before the world ends.

Luckily, all my data is backed up elsewhere. I know I won’t be able to install Adobe Master Collection CS6 or Final Cut 7 on anything modern. So… time to move on? Maybe a Mac mini? A gaming laptop? I use an M1 iMac at work—and I don’t like it.",3,1768350702.0,macbook,9,0.8,False

I’m in the early stages of planning our kids 5th birthday at a  fancy playcentre (which serves excellent coffee, I have personally verified). I’m about to select a 9am start time for the party because I know it’s my preference to get out of the house early, get the party over and done with and *hopefully* tire the kids out for the day. The bonus of this time is the playcentres are generally also more quiet and clean at this time. 

Hubby reckons this might piss other parents off and 11am, 1pm or 3pm would be better.  I reckon 11am and 1pm make it tricky for parents who have younger kids that still nap (us included). And 3pm (at least for my kids) is generally when they’re already starting to get cranky and the playcentre by then has been used all day and no longer at its best.

1qc8gg9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qc8gg9,Current Home + Templates and tips,"Current level 14 + paid for the home pack after spending everyday for the past two weeks playing with the decor.
Turned Room 1 into a study, Room 2 into a closet amd Room 4 into de bedroom. Didn't care for the gym decor very much.

I wanted to share my current house because this sub has given me a lot of inspiration and all the houses are soo pretty and full of personality. 

Here are some tips I found helpful if you are still stuck with decor:

Lamps and carpets will be your best friends. The game has bad lighting, having well positioned lamps will help make things cozier. The house, especially the living room is quite big and open, so creating smaller spaces and areas helps decorating. The easiest way to define these spaces without making things crowded is to use carpets.

Every item without the unowned tag is already have it fully crafted, no need to craft it again if you dont want a repeat.

But dont be afraid to repeat items when decorating, it will help keep things cohesive and complete environments.

Position things diagonally and not touching walls. Positioning everything close or touching the walls will make your space look empty. Placing items in the middle of the space and diagonally will make things more dinamic.

Keep in mind the specific categories of the  furniture when buying and decorating. A lounge chair, a love seat, a seating and a chair will have different types of interactions, you can base the size of the item depeding on the specific category. Bars are tall, tables are big and long, coffe tables are short and smaller and side tables are small but taller than the coffee ones. Test the free items in all the different categories to get a sense of what they offer in terms of aesthetic and interactions before buying the items you specifically want to save your resources.

Don't buy everything that catches your eyes all at once. Start with bigger base items and as you decorate and evaluates what is missing in your space click on the custom interior widget and chose the item you want to craft/buy, if you are out of materials to craft you dont need to stop decorating just click on the material go directly to the shop. I found this to be the best way to not impulsively buy and keep decoration cohesive.

After decorating change the time of tbe day to check how the room looks in different hours of the day and make adjustments. The lighting changes drastically the environments in the game.

Dont be afraid to change the use of the rooms. They are all the same name for a reason.

1qc8edx,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1qc8edx/8_years_ended_with_a_whatsapp_message/,8 years ended with a WhatsApp message,"Yup, an 8 year relationship with the woman I thought I'd spend the rest of my days with was ended with a single WhatsApp message today.  
""I have thought about our relationship and it’s probably the best to split up at this point.""

How's your day going?

Sigh... I'm too old for this. You're not supposed to have your heart ripped out at 34...

We met 8 years ago. It started as a chat online through a language exchange site. We lived in the same city, we had shared interests, we liked conversing.  
We were both shy and careful, it took weeks before we even decided to go on a walk as a date and then coffee. It took another couple weeks until our first hug.

After about half a year of a happy relationship we moved into an apartment together. This was the kindest and most giving woman I had ever met in my life. She was too good for her own good, truly. People would take advantage of her.  
I wanted to always protect her, comfort her, make her happy. She became my world, I had nothing but her, nothing that mattered anyway.

We both had our issues. She suffered from anxiety, bipolar disorder and some other diagnosis if I recall correctly. She went to therapy and took medication so I never noticed any of it outside some of the anxiety.  
I was her safe haven, her rock. The person that would always be there supporting her no matter what the world threw our direction. That was all I wanted.  
And I'm proud of her, she did well. Despite her mental struggles she was able to function, was able to enjoy hobbies, was able to travel and was able to finish her degree.

I did not do as well. I have no diagnosis, because I've never been evaluated. But I can say with 95% certainty I have suffered from moderate depression for 20 years. I failed to seek help. I failed to complete my degree. I failed to find a full-time job. It's been so long that I don't remember what I used to be like. I have never had any thoughts about self-harm, I just have no energy and no motivation. No goals. Everyday tasks are an insurmountable mountain. Cooking food when I'm nearly on the verge of passing out. Shopping for groceries a day after I ran out. Even showering is a draining task. No will to meet or make friends or social connections.  
(If you feel like this, you're not lazy. It's not your fault. Do what I never did, get help.)

My gf tried to help. She tried to prod me in the direction of seeking help. She sent me job openings and helped me with my CV. She encouraged me to apply to more places.

Last year, she started getting better. Less anxious. She went out more, she traveled more. On her own because I could not afford going with her.  
She hinted she was bored with our city and wanted to move sometime.

On November 24th 2025 she told me out of the blue that she's moving to another city to pursue another degree. She'd be moving by January 4th.  
It happened without any warning or any discussion. I had no time to react or make any plans. Was the relationship over? Just like that? Was she breaking up with me?

No, she just wanted to pursue her career and dreams. She was tired of waiting. But she still wanted us to be together and for me to move with her. I was still secretly broken, my mind thought it was probably over but I let her convince me. We'd meet every weekend. I was going to work for 6-12 months and then move together with her. We had the plans set in the month before she moved.

On January 4th I walked her to the bus station. We stood in the cold and waited for the bus. A quick kiss, hugs and then we waved goodbye. We'd meet again in 2 weeks.

We kept talking every day as we always had. Good morning, good night. Conversations about the day, conversations about missing each other.  
January 12th we both said good night as usual and sent our usual hugs and kisses.

January 13th I woke up to a WhatsApp message. The one in the beginning.  
""I have thought about our relationship and it’s probably the best to split up at this point.""

No fight, no disagreement, no conversation. Out of nowhere.  
Blindsided. Again. Heart crushed. Again.

I had just started doing better too. I had more energy. I was applying to open job positions, we had a schedule for meeting. We had a plan for when and how to move together again.

And then nothing. Emptiness. It's all gone. Forever.

I know it was my fault. I know I was an anchor dragging her down when she wanted to move forward in life. I know I should have taken responsibility, sought help and fixed everything.  
I know she did everything I could ask and much more to help me. I know she had the patience of a saint. I know I'm the one who ruined my once in a lifetime relationship and lost the only person I truly cared about in the world.

I know... But it hurts so bad.",2,1768350267.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins.

11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs).

If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins.

1qc890y,https://i.redd.it/sqsd0831k7dg1.png,Why Smart Contracts Are Philosophy Written in Gas Fees,"I was sitting in a coffee shop when it hit me. Not the espresso—that came later. But a realization so simple and so profoundly irritating that I nearly spilled it anyway.

Smart contracts are not smart.

This should have been obvious. The name is literally a contradiction. A ""smart contract"" is like calling a ""jumbo shrimp"" or a ""military intelligence""—technically coherent, philosophically laughable. But I'd spent so long watching people talk about ""smart contracts"" like they were tiny digital geniuses, carefully orchestrating financial transactions with the wisdom of a thousand algorithicians, that I'd simply accepted the marketing.

The truth? A smart contract is more like a very polite, very rigid bouncer who has been given exactly three instructions:

1. Check the password.
2. If the password is correct, let them in.
3. If the password is wrong, refuse entry. Repeat this process forever with no arguments, no exceptions, no ""but I'm a regular customer.""

The contract cannot be charmed. It cannot be bribed. It cannot be convinced that perhaps, *this one time*, the rules could bend. It is—and this is the part that makes it genuinely revolutionary—**completely incapable of the human tendency to make exceptions.**

This is what Ternary Moral Logic (TML) figured out. And it's kind of hilarious that it took us this long.

# The Problem With Promises (And Why We Needed Code to Fix It)

Let me back up. For about 300 years, the Western world has been operating on a delightfully naive assumption: that written agreements between people are binding because everyone *agrees* they are binding.

A contract says: ""I promise to deliver 100 widgets by Friday.""

Everyone nods. Everyone understands. Everyone agrees the promise is serious.

Then Friday arrives, and somehow the widgets don't. And now we're in a courtroom, with lawyers arguing about what ""deliver"" means and whether ""widgets"" includes digital widgets and whether ""Friday"" was a typo for ""a Friday, sometime in the next decade.""

This is where humans shine at being humans: in the space between the promise and the reality, we negotiate, contextualize, excuse, and redefine. We are *magnificent* at arguing about exceptions.

Smart contracts are the opposite. They are magnificent at having none.

A smart contract written on the Ethereum blockchain doesn't say: ""I promise to deliver widgets.""

It says: ""**When this condition is met, this action happens. Full stop.**""

No promises. No promises. No fuzziness. No room for interpretive dance. The code doesn't care about your intentions. It doesn't care about the spirit of the agreement. It cares only about whether the specific condition, as written in the specific code, has been triggered.

This sounds limiting. And it is! But it's limiting in the way that gravity is limiting—it's consistently, reliably, predictably limiting. You can build skyscrapers on it.

# The Moment the Vending Machine Became Philosophy

I want to take a moment to talk about vending machines, because I think they're more important to understanding TML than anyone has acknowledged.

When you put a dollar into a vending machine and press C7, you are not making a promise with the vending machine. You are not entering into a contract that you both will do your best. You are not hoping that the machine feels generous. You are invoking a deterministic rule: *One dollar in → Chips out.*

If the machine works properly, you get chips. If it doesn't, you don't. There is no blame. There is no negotiation. The machine is not ""cheating"" you if it malfunctions—it's just broken.

Now imagine a world where every financial transaction was like this. Where banks couldn't ""accidentally"" charge you twice because the code literally wouldn't allow it. Where insurance companies couldn't reinterpret your claim in ways that maximized their profit because the conditions were written in code, not in 47-page documents written in a language that technically is English but reads like it was translated by an algorithm trained on legal documents and despair.

This is the world that smart contracts promise. And this is where Ternary Moral Logic gets interesting.

Because TML realized: a vending machine is too simple. Most human decisions are not ""dollar in, chips out."" Most human decisions are ""well, it depends."" And the code that governs complex systems needs to be able to express this complexity without becoming a loophole delivery vehicle.

# Enter the Sacred Zero: When Smart Contracts Admit Confusion

Here's where things get weird (and good).

Traditional smart contracts are binary. True or false. Execute or revert. +1 (proceed) or -1 (refuse). This is useful for simple things like ""send money"" or ""verify a signature."" But for anything involving human judgment, ethics, or genuine uncertainty, this is inadequate.

What if you're an AI system trying to decide whether to approve a loan? The applicant has good income (+), but also unusual spending patterns (-). Their credit score is decent (+), but they live in a zip code that the model was trained to distrust (because of historical discrimination) (-). The data is *mixed*. The situation is genuinely ambiguous.

Traditional code would handle this by fudging it. A programmer would write: ""If score > 650, approve."" And then the code would proceed with false confidence, either approving a potentially risky loan or rejecting a worthy applicant—and the system would confidently commit to whichever error it made.

TML said: ""No. What if, instead of pretending we know, we *admit we don't know*?""

This is the **Sacred Zero**. It's a third state in the smart contract. Not +1 (definitely approve), not -1 (definitely refuse), but **0 (I need to think about this)**.

When the contract encounters a genuinely ambiguous situation, it doesn't make a reckless decision. It *pauses*. It logs the moment of hesitation. It emits an event (the ""Lantern Signal"") that says, ""Hey, humans, I'm confused, and I want you to know I'm confused.""

And then it waits for a human steward to review the case and make the decision.

This is the part that should blow your mind, but probably won't because it sounds so obvious:

**A smart contract that admits uncertainty is more trustworthy than a smart contract that pretends certainty.**

It's almost embarrassing that this needed to be said in the first place.

# The Three Voices: Rules That Refuse to Argue Back

The core of TML's smart contract system is what they call ""The Three Voices."" And this is where the philosophy starts actually mattering.

**The +1 (Permit):** This is clarity. The condition has been met, the rule is satisfied, the action is permissible. The contract executes the transaction. It's the vending machine dispensing chips.

**The -1 (Refuse):** This is also clarity. The rule has been violated, harm has been detected, the action is prohibited. The contract reverts the transaction and logs the refusal. The machine doesn't give chips *and* doesn't give back your dollar—it's just a hard stop, a ""no.""

**The 0 (Sacred Zero):** This is humility. The data is ambiguous, the rules are conflicting, the outcome is uncertain. The contract pauses. It creates a ""Pause Record"" and waits for human judgment.

Now here's the thing that makes this genuinely smart (and therefore the name is only half-wrong):

These three states are not opinions. They are not recommendations. They are **execution modes**. The smart contract doesn't suggest that you should pause—it *architecturally compels* the pause. The code itself stops. The transaction hangs. The system enters a state where continued action is *computationally impossible* until the pause condition is resolved.

You cannot argue with this. You cannot talk the smart contract into proceeding anyway. You cannot convince it that this one time, the rules don't apply. The smart contract is immune to lobbying.

This is genuinely revolutionary because it means that for the first time in history, we have rules that cannot be bent by money, power, or influence. They can be bent by code, sure. But that bending is *visible*. Anyone can see if the rules were changed. The change gets logged, cryptographically signed, and anchored to multiple blockchains.

You can't hide that you changed the rules. And in a world of increasing complexity and opacity, the inability to hide institutional favoritism is more valuable than any other form of regulation.

# The ""Always Memory"" Architecture: Notes on the Refrigerator of Institutional Conscience

There's a concept in TML called ""Always Memory,"" and it's responsible for one of my favorite rules in the entire framework:

**""No Log = No Action""**

This is worth sitting with for a moment, because it reverses something fundamental about how institutions work.

Normally, institutions operate like this:

1. The decision is made.
2. The action is taken.
3. The log is written (ideally).
4. Regulators hope the log is accurate.

TML reverses this:

1. The log must be written *first*.
2. The log is cryptographically hashed.
3. Only if the hash exists in the immutable registry can the action execute.
4. If there's no log, the action is *computationally impossible*.

This is not a suggestion. This is an architectural constraint. The code will not permit an action to execute unless the prior evidence of why that action is permissible already exists in the system.

Think about what this means: You cannot delete evidence retroactively. You cannot rewrite history and claim the action was always authorized. You cannot make a discretionary call ""off the books."" If it's not in the log, it never happened. And if it's in the log, it's permanent.

This is why the metaphor of a refrigerator is useful. You know how sometimes you put a note on your refrigerator that says ""Don't eat the leftovers—they're from 1987""? The note doesn't prevent you from eating the leftovers, but it makes your failure to heed the warning *visible*. Everyone will see that you ignored the warning. You can't credibly claim you didn't know.

A smart contract with ""Always Memory"" is like a refrigerator where you *cannot physically access* the leftovers unless the note exists first. The architecture itself enforces accountability.

# The Hybrid Shield: Why Paranoia is Actually Just Good Systems Design

Now, at this point you might be thinking: ""Okay, but what if the smart contract itself is corrupted? What if someone modifies the code?""

This is where TML's ""Hybrid Shield"" comes in, and it's the part where the system stops being merely clever and starts being actively paranoid in the most productive way possible.

The Hybrid Shield operates on two layers:

**Layer 1 (The Technical Shield):** Inside the smart contract itself, there's a mechanism called ""hash-chain integrity."" Every new log is cryptographically dependent on the previous log. If you try to insert a fake log, the hash chain breaks. Everyone can see the break. You've contaminated the record, and the contamination is permanent and visible.

**Layer 2 (The Anchoring Shield):** But wait—what if someone controls Ethereum? What if there's a 51% attack or the entire blockchain is compromised?

TML responds: ""Let's also write the same information to *other* blockchains.""

The system automatically broadcasts its decision hashes to Bitcoin (proof-of-work immutability), Ethereum (fast execution), and multiple Layer 2 systems (throughput). For a bad actor to erase the evidence, they would need to simultaneously corrupt Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polygon. They would need to mount a multi-chain 51% attack that affects networks with different consensus mechanisms, different economic incentives, and different security properties.

The probability of that is approximately the probability of you being struck by lightning while simultaneously winning the lottery.

This is paranoia, yes. But it's the kind of paranoia that has kept Bitcoin's blockchain intact since 2009 without anyone successfully rewriting history. It's the kind of paranoia that, when applied to institutional accountability, actually works.

# The Stewardship Council: Where Philosophy Meets Quorum

Here's where TML introduces something almost beautiful in its design: it acknowledges that code alone is not sufficient.

The smart contract can enforce the Three Voices. It can maintain the Always Memory. It can anchor across multiple chains. But it cannot *understand* what counts as genuine harm versus contextual harm. It cannot know whether a Sacred Zero pause should be resolved by proceeding, refusing, or pausing longer.

For this, TML introduces the **Stewardship Council**—human beings whose job is to resolve the moments of genuine ambiguity.

And crucially: their decisions are logged and verified just like everything else.

If the Stewardship Council consistently resolves pauses in ways that are ethically questionable, the pattern becomes visible in the logs. The public can see it. Auditors can see it. Civil society organizations can see it. The Council cannot hide bias or corruption because every decision is permanent, timestamped, and cryptographically signed.

This is the part of TML that actually gets at something true about institutions: they don't fail because rules don't exist. They fail because the people implementing the rules can hide the patterns of how they implement them. Opacity is the enemy.

TML removes opacity by making every decision visible.

Is this perfect? No. Corrupt stewards could still exist. But if they do, their corruption is *permanently documented*. They cannot claim they were acting in good faith. The logs show the pattern of bias. That's worth something. That's actually worth a lot.

# The License: Philosophy as Non-Fungible Token

This is going to sound absurd, but stay with me.

TML implements what's called the ""Goukassian Promise,"" which is basically a covenant that the system enforces. And one part of that covenant is enforced through a non-transferable NFT called the ""License.""

Think of it this way: if you want to operate an AI system under TML, you need a License. This License is a Soulbound Token—it's tied to your wallet and cannot be sold or transferred (hence ""soulbound"").

If your AI system violates the ""No Spy / No Weapon"" mandates, the Stewardship Council can revoke your License. And when they do, your system automatically defaults to -1 (Refuse) for all decisions. You become unable to execute *any* transactions. Your system is bricked.

Now, this sounds draconian. But notice what it does: it makes the cost of violating the ethical covenant *immediate and irreversible*. You don't have time to lobby for reconsideration. You don't have time to find a legal loophole. The code revokes your ability to act.

And the revocation itself is logged and anchored. Everyone knows why you were revoked. The shame is permanent.

This is philosophy enforced as code. And while it sounds harsh, it's actually more humane than the alternative—a system where violations are hidden, institutionalized, and normalized until they cause catastrophic harm.

# The Economics of Hesitation: The Moral Tax and the Bonding Curve of Trust

Here's where TML gets a little clever about human incentives.

Running a TML system is more expensive than running traditional systems. You need to generate logs, anchor them to multiple blockchains, maintain the pause infrastructure, and pay the Stewardship Council to review Sacred Zero events. This cost—what TML calls the ""Moral Tax""—adds roughly 46% overhead to complex transactions.

This is intentional.

The idea is that the friction of cost creates a *disincentive to recklessness*. If every time you trigger a Sacred Zero pause, you have to pay a deposit (refundable if the pause is deemed legitimate), then you think twice before flooding the system with ambiguous decisions.

This is an economic version of the principle that values increase when they cost something. A system that forces you to pause and think about ethics is more trustworthy than a system that lets you operate at maximum velocity with no friction.

There's also a ""Bonding Curve"" for the Stewardship Council. Stewards have to put up financial stakes to participate in resolutions. If they consistently vote against consensus or are found to be biased, their stake is slashed. This aligns their financial incentives with their ethical obligations.

It's cynical in its way—assuming that people will be more honest if money is on the line. But it's also practical. Humans are humans. We respond to incentives. If you want ethical behavior, you need to make unethical behavior expensive and visible.

# The Sacred Zero in Practice: What It Actually Means to Pause

Let me give you a concrete example of how this works.

An insurance company is using a TML-compliant AI system to evaluate claims. A customer has requested coverage for a medical procedure. The system checks the standard criteria: Is the customer covered? Is the procedure on the approved list? Are all the paperwork requirements met?

The answer to all three questions is yes. The system is ready to approve (+1).

But wait. The AI also runs a bias detection check (part of the Lantern test in TML). It notices that the customer belongs to a demographic group that the underlying model was trained to distrust. The approval decision is clear in terms of the stated rules (+1), but the data input that led to those rules might be biased (-1).

This is a conflict. The formal rules say yes, but the ethical reasoning says uncertain.

The system triggers a Sacred Zero (0). It logs the moment of hesitation. It emits a signal to the human reviewers. And it pauses.

The human reviewer—a Steward—gets notified. They review the specific case, look at the decision log, and see exactly where the conflict arose. They can decide: ""The rules are clear, approve the claim."" Or they can decide: ""We need to investigate the bias in the underlying model before proceeding."" Or they can decide: ""Let's gather more data on this specific case.""

Whatever they decide, the decision is logged. The customer sees the log. If they believe the decision was unjust, they can challenge it. The evidence is all there.

This is not perfect. Stewards could still be biased. But now the bias is *visible*. The system has created accountability where there was opacity.

# Why This Matters (And Why We're Going to Need This)

I've been thinking about why Lev Goukassian created TML while dying of cancer. And I think it's because he understood something fundamental about the modern world: **we are governed more by code than by law, and we have no idea what's in that code.**

Algorithms decide whether you get a loan. Algorithms decide whether you're a good insurance risk. Algorithms decide what information you see. Algorithms optimize for engagement, profit, and surveillance. And none of these algorithms are required to tell you why they decided what they decided.

This is not inherently evil. It's just opaque. And opacity is the enemy of accountability.

TML is Goukassian's answer: make the code honest. Don't let it pretend certainty. Force it to admit when it's uncertain. And when it's uncertain, force humans to make the decision—in public, with accountability.

The Smart Contracts themselves are the enforcement mechanism. They're not smart in the sense of being intelligent. They're smart in the sense of being rigidly, stubbornly, mathematically honest.

They refuse to argue. They refuse to make exceptions. They refuse to hide.

And in a world of increasing complexity, that refusal is revolutionary.

# Closing Reflection: The Lantern Burns Because It Must

There's a metaphor in TML called the ""Lantern."" When the system enters a Sacred Zero (a pause), it ""lights the Lantern."" It's saying, ""I'm uncertain, and I'm going to wait for human wisdom.""

The Lantern doesn't flicker with confidence. It glows steadily in hesitation.

I think this might be the most important metaphor of the twenty-first century. A century in which everything is accelerating, everything is automated, everything is optimized for speed—we've forgotten the value of the Lantern. We've forgotten to pause.

Smart contracts, properly designed, force the pause back in. They say: *You cannot proceed without evidence. You cannot hide the pause. You cannot pretend certainty when certainty does not exist.*

This is not smart in the way an AI is smart. This is smart in the way a mirror is smart—it shows you what's actually there, without flattery or excuse.

And maybe that's all we've ever needed: not smarter code, but more honest code. Code that refuses to argue. Code that admits hesitation. Code that lights a Lantern when the path ahead is dark.

Because sometimes, the most revolutionary thing an intelligent system can do is stop moving and say: ""I don't know. Let's think about this together.""

**""Smart contracts aren't smart because they're intelligent. They're smart because they refuse to lie about the limits of their knowledge.""**",1,1768349889.0,u_MoralLogs,0,1.0,False

I live in a 2 bedroom apartment with my mom, her boyfriend, my husband, a dog & a cat. I am saving to move soon, but our situation is really complicated. 
My mom & her bf smoke in the house, most of the time the window is not open- even if it was, we live in the corner of the apartment so there’s no circulation.
My mom is a messy person, and a junk hoarder. I will walk into the kitchen with her makeup foundation bottles on top of the microwave, stacks of mail left on top of the burner, her purse left on the tiny counters (our kitchen is maybe 5x3 ft. not big at all, can hardly fit 2 people pouring a bowl of cereal at the same time , nevermind junk all over the place. Her bf leaves his coffee grounds all over the place. I also went into the kitchen yesterday to 3 waffles left out on top of the microwave. The other day, she left pizza inside the microwave from the day before. 

and when the bf uses the bathroom he doesn’t wash his hands, and his pube hairs are left all over the toilet seat??? so disgusting !!!! 

In the shower- her boyfriend’s hair is all over the bath after he’s done. It’s disgusting. I have to rinse out the shower with the hose if i want to shower. I don’t even feel clean anymore after i shower, AND they smoke in the bathroom- which has no window- so the smoke is stagnant and you can smell it on the shower curtain. The mirror has a shelf installed with it, and inside my mom has 20 different skin care products that she does not use, old razors, and hair products that she forgot about. Above the toilet there is a basket with a ton of other products she does not know how to put back nicely, everything is thrown on top of each other. It drives me crazy. I’m honestly starting to throw out one product every day and hoping she doesn’t notice. i’m so tired of it

Along with this, the living room is a mess. My mom has been using an old wick shelf that is falling apart and using it for storage, it takes up a good chunk of the living room and it is so ugly !!! It’s discolored, and she keeps old clothes on it that she hasn’t worn in years, and a motorcycle helmet that is covered by an old plastic bag, and paper files stacked on top of each other. It just doesn’t look good at all, it’s all stuff that doesn’t make sense next to each other. The tv stand also has a mix of items that don’t make sense, like hair accessories, chargers, old papers, and makeup. We have a storage room that should be for papers and other stationary stuff, but instead it’s used for nonsense stuff. 
The smell is also horrid. It smells like dog pee - the dog pees inside on a pee pad, she’s not home most days to take him out and he is aggressive to me so i can’t put the leash on him. And it smells like old cigarettes since they have been smoking for over 2 years inside. Her boyfriend has a cologne addiction, so he sprays on his $500 cologne that takes over the entire house, along with the hallway+staircase in the apartment when he leaves for work!!! 
Along with this, he has about 50 boxes taking over her dresser, and he has 20 pairs of shoes that he does not wear just laying out in the middle of the room. He also has 3 bags of clothes that he doesn’t fit anymore and won’t take the time to go through them. 

I bought a shoe rack for me and my husband to put at the door next to my room, and my mom has been using it for her shoes, and she will place her stuff on it when she gets home from work, as if she emptied out her pockets and dumped it all on the shoe rack. 

Any time i buy food for myself, my mom ends up eating it. They NEVER buy groceries; so they take advantage if i buy anything !! Bread? They finish half the loaf the next day. Chocolate syrup? My mom finishes the entire bottle that same week. Icecream? My mom leaves me ONE SPOONFUL out of a tub!!! At that point- finish it. So rude. 

In the living room, i wanted to start using the space for a stationary bike. My mom started using it as a clothing rack. There’s literally clothes hanging off the bike- not going to lie tho, i never use it. But it looks disgusting with her clothes piling on top of each other. 
She also never folds her laundry, so there’s always a pile of clean clothes at the other side of the couch that she sleeps on, rolled into a ball. The floor also has a pile of clothes from 3 years ago. I wanted to also start yoga, and the living room is the only available space, but the carpet smells like dog pee, and they walk inside with their shoes, so nevermind - its impossible to relax. 


My room is so tiny and i have a full bed so it’s hard to keep up with it, but i definitely attempt to keep it somewhat straightened up. But it’s so small and there’s now 2 of us in this one room. None of my stuff is in any other part of the house, except for my bathroom products. 

She has also been using the excuse “it’s my house!!! leave if you don’t like it” any time i bring up something that is inconsiderate, or just suggesting how to improve something. trust me - she will never see me in this house again after we are able to find something else. I very aware that the reason i cannot lose weight is because i have bad habits connected to this environment. I stay in my room- i have no energy to be around them or be anywhere in the apartment. We do not have a yard to hang out in, and everywhere around the apartment is concrete. I was at my best weight when i was staying with at an old friend’s house and they had a yard and lived next to water, we were outside all the time. I also eat fast when there is food in the house, due to them eating everything before i get to it- so this has started a really bad habit of overeating so they don’t finish it. I also do not buy much ingredients due to the kitchen being so small and crowded, it’s almost impossible to cook. I can maybe grill some chicken, but if i have more than 2 things being cooked, it starts to get overwhelming and there is no room to put anything. One corner of the kitchen is stacked with my mom’s old purses, makeup bags, and christmas gifts that she still has not unpacked. 


sorry if none of this made sense, i’m really just venting and getting this all out. Sometimes i can handle the chaos, but other times it really gets to me and makes me so irritated all day long, affecting how i act throughout the day, knowing i have to go back home to this. She might clean once every 4 months, and at that time im very happy and stress free - but right now it’s the worst it’s ever been. ",1,1768349801.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

1qc7zm5,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qc7zm5/i_guard_an_abandoned_house_the_owners_are_reborn/,I guard an abandoned house. The owners are reborn every year.,"First thing’s first: I’m not a caretaker, though the visitors insist that’s the only thing I *could* be: crazy old Mr Locke, crusty caretaker to a haunted house.

My official position is gamekeeper to Koel House. By the time the visitors figure out what the “game” are, it’s usually too late.

The smart ones, the ones who might listen to my warnings, usually have the decency to ask about local history, but even they only want the horror stories: the massacre of the Koel family by their victims, the murderous ghosts they left behind, the cursed vault of stolen treasure, and if they want something raunchier, Alice Koel’s ghost seducing visitors.

In fact, this history is based on legends, all of which I can easily debunk.

Koel House was built in 1857, four miles from the small Maine township of Indigo, and commissioned by Edward Koel, scion of one of the wealthiest families in the state. The resulting three-story Gothic mansion wasn’t built on a Native American burial ground, nor were there any satanic rituals in its construction.

The entire family didn’t live in the house and certainly didn’t exploit this to conduct incestuous orgies.

In fact, the only point when all of them were under one roof was the Christmas reunion of 1895, when the mansion was home not only to Edward and his wife Gertrude, but also their four adult children (Julian, Livia, Rufus, Alice, plus their spouses and lovers), *and* their grandchildren (Miranda, Adrian, Sarah, Anna, Gideon, and Marcus) – who ranged from fourteen years of age to barely a month old… not to mention forty servants, ten horses, eight hounds, and one cat.

And in all the decades Koel House was occupied, there were no kidnappings, no murders, no torture cellars, and no victims escaping to take revenge.

What killed the Koel Family was a particularly deadly strain of influenza in the winter of 1895. With heavy snowfall imprisoning the family in the mansion for the duration of the Christmas party and beyond, the disease spread quickly among the inhabitants, and by the time the blizzards had subsided enough to allow help to arrive from Indigo, the Koels and all their servants had been dead for weeks.

Even the animals had starved to death.

A tragedy, but a little too simple a beginning for a ghost story. Perhaps it’s not so surprising that people made up gory backstories to explain the haunting.

But then, that’s the final rumor I can debunk:

Koel House isn’t haunted – not by ghosts, at any rate.

It’s just a house, and like all houses, it wants nothing more than to be lived in.

But unlike other houses, it will do *anything* to get its original residents back.

And that’s where I come in.

\---

Koel House has always needed a gamekeeper.

Granted, there’s precious little game left on the sprawling estate except for the tourists who keep climbing over the wall.

Despite all the efforts of the Indigo town council to keep Koel House secure, people just can’t be dissuaded, not by the ""keep out"" signs, not by the threat of arrest, not by razor wire, and not even by the jungle of giant hogweed and sumac planted around the wall.

To outsiders, the house is just too alluring to resist - exactly as it intended.

That’s why the Mayor of Indigo began hiring gamekeepers again not long after the Koels died. This time, he paid beggars, orphans, veterans, ex-convicts, ex-lighthouse keepers, and other isolated folk to stay on the grounds full-time and keep watch.

The duties were - and still are - deceptively simple: give the trespassers one last chance to turn back, and if that fails, clean up the evidence.

I live in a shack just a hundred yards from the gate. Thanks to Indigo’s tourist dollars, there’s a network of CCTV cameras keeping watch over the grounds and corridors of the house, so whenever a newcomer clambers over the wall, I’m ready to offer them a cup of coffee and a friendly warning.

Regardless of whether I’m dealing with tourists, burglars, ghost-hunters, or YouTubers, I’m never confrontational. I remain welcoming, informative, and even though they’re trespassing, I always assure them I’m not going to call the cops. Quite apart from the fact that local police aren’t allowed inside the walls, most of these intruders are younger than me, and it’s not uncommon for them to arrive in packs.

Most don’t listen to my warnings and don’t even want the coffee, but there’s not much I can do about that. Once they’ve been warned, I’m not supposed to make any effort to stop them.

For a while, the visitors go about their business inside the house: exploring, filming, ghost-hunting, showboating, looting, or just marveling at the fact that the house hasn’t decayed at all since the day it was abandoned.

Then they get curious about a particular bedroom. There’s no rhyme or reason to which one attracts them: something about it just seems to *call* to them on an instinctual level, to the point that they can find it without checking the floor map. Once inside, they start to feel sleepy, just enough to make them think they’d feel better if they sat down.

Most doze off, and that’s where their story ends. Next morning, I’ll have clothes to get rid of and a car to dismantle, but otherwise, these visitors are a self-disposing problem.

But as for the ones who fight through the drowsiness and leave the building… well, they can't run forever: the moment they set foot in a bedroom, they're as good as dead.

But in the meantime, *someone* needs to keep them from revealing Koel House's secrets. So, I send a text to the mayor and follow them.

On the upside, their first port of call is almost always a bar, either to celebrate a job well done or to calm their nerves. Either way, that gives me a chance to catch up with them.

If I’m in luck, it’s the psychological symptoms that show themselves first: an antiquated word here, a moment of forgetfulness there, or perhaps they recall a memory that doesn’t seem to belong to them.

Every bedroom has its own distinctive behavioral effect on the visitor, some easier to recognize than others.

The ones who were lured in by Alice’s room are quite distinctive, for instance: they’re the ones who aren’t drinking, and if the sufferer’s mind drifts enough, they can be seen unconsciously stroking their belly.

By far the easiest to recognize are the poor souls who visited the children’s bedrooms: if they’re not poking their tongues out at each other or exchanging juvenile insults, you can usually catch them absently picking their noses or sucking their thumbs.

Eventually, the victim notices that they’re starting to forget their old lives.

That’s usually their cue to stagger away in confusion. In that state, they’re easy to escort to my car, and their growing disorientation makes it almost impossible for them to put up any kind of resistance while the physical symptoms kick in. By the time we get back to Koel House, the process is usually complete.

Where things get inconvenient is when the *physical* symptoms show themselves first.

Picture the scene at the bar: the latest intruder ready to share another tall tale with their fellow thrill seekers about the weird and wonderful things they saw, maybe even show off a souvenir or two.

And then something about them changes in a way that usually only they notice at first:

Perhaps their clothes seem a size too big for them, enough to make their shoes simply slip off their feet; or maybe their shirts are suddenly tight across the shoulders, as if meant for a much smaller wearer; perhaps they notice grey hairs that weren’t there a moment ago; maybe they find that they’d gained weight in odd places; maybe their stomachs are suddenly very sensitive, enough to make them vomit after a single beer; more upsettingly, they might themselves shedding clumps of hair… or even losing teeth.

More than once, I’ve seen a happy treasure hunter suddenly cough a bloody molar into their hand and be left staring in horror at it, paralyzed with fear and confusion.

As soon as they notice something’s seriously wrong, the victims either bolt or go into hiding.



 By itself, this isn’t much of a problem; most only last an hour or so before they’re fully converted, and few last longer than a day… but in that time, there’s always the risk of them hurting someone, or worse, revealing the truth about Koel House to more respectable tourists.

So, it’s the gamekeeper’s job to track them down.

\---

I remember the first case I handled on my own, back in 1999. My predecessor, Mr Gatewood, had retired after spending his final year showing me the ropes, and I was eager to make a good first impression for the mayor.

That year, two enterprising thieves tried to rob Koel House of everything they could carry. They ignored my warnings, of course, and ended up being lured in by the master bedroom, barely fighting their way through their fatigue to escape with the best of Edward and Gertrude’s jewelry.

I found them at a motel on the outskirts of Indigo an hour later.

By then, their hair had turned grey, their faces were lined with winkles, their backs were bent with advancing years, and before my very eyes, their bodies were casting off well-developed muscles, growing skinnier by the minute. Before long, one of the burglars needed Gertrude’s spectacles to see further than a few feet, and the other had developed a limp that required him to walk with the gold-headed cane he’d stolen.

“What’s happening to us?” one of them wheezed. “Are we dying?”

“Far from it,” I told him. “In a way, you’re going to live forever.”

Of course, they didn’t understand what I meant by that. In tears, they begged me for a cure, promising to give me everything they’d stolen if I'd cure them. But then, they’d assumed I meant that they’d be trapped in elderly bodies forever; after a few minutes of arthritic joints and failing eyesight, they thought that their symptoms were as bad as they could get.

The physical transformation occurs in fits and starts, each stage a little more horrific than the last, and by the time the second of the two burglars realized *who* he was becoming, they'd upgraded to offering me everything they’d ever owned.

So, I ushered them out to my car, promising to find them a doctor. In truth, I spent the next hour driving around in circles, listening to the muffled crunch and squish of my passengers transforming, doing my best to ignore the increasingly confused mutterings from the backseat as the transformation ate its way into their brains.

The last coherent sentence I heard, before the two victims lost consciousness and their whimpering finally died away, was a muffled gasp of “who am I?”

By the end of the journey, the two burglars were gone, and Edward and Gertrude Koel had been reborn. They were bewildered by my car and the state of Indigo, and Gertrude was more than a little annoyed at finding herself dressed in men’s clothes, but other than that, they returned to Koel House without incident.

They settled back in, threw their old clothes away, redressed in the fineries they had in life, forgot the outside world, and resumed their usual routines, which Koel House is all too happy to accommodate with the miracles at its command.

That was in early January, and over the course of the next few months, the illegal tourist trade brought in replacements for every single member of the Koel family and their servants, and Koel House took them all – like some kind of reverse cuckoo stealing eggs from other nests to raise as its own.

I remember thinking that eventually the tourists would start to avoid the place as word of mouth spread, or - if I was unlucky - that I’d make a mistake while cleaning up the evidence and bring the FBI down on our heads.

Of course, the house proved me wrong, and not for the last time, either.

Apathy kicks in quicker than usual under Koel House’s influence: even if a connection is made to the house, police and the FBI dismiss the disappearance as unsolvable, and the scandal only makes the house more alluring to profiteers and thrill-seekers. Even the few witness reports to hit the Internet are eventually disregarded as tall tales, hence why I’m allowed to write this confession in the first place.

Only the most blatant, irrefutable evidence can break the spell, which is exactly how the Mayors of Indigo and us gamekeepers are made immune.

I suppose I should be grateful for the fact that Koel House is a mobile service dead zone, otherwise social media would have blown the lid off our secret years ago.

But for all its inexplicable power, Koel House isn’t a god: it can’t keep its converted population alive forever, and after a few months transformed, they’re already starting to fray at the edges, until they simply can’t be sustained at all.

I witnessed this firsthand at the end of my first solo year, when the reborn Koels gathered for a reunion party, as they always do in December, once enough victims have been assimilated. This was before the indoor CCTV cameras were installed, so I was watching from the corridor, fighting the lure so I could spy on them up close.

At the very moment Edward gave his last toast of the evening, the Koels and their servants groaned in exhaustion... and began to melt, their faces softening beyond recognition and dribbling down their necks, their bodies liquefying, pouring out of their clothes in groaning rivulets, until all that remained were writhing, mumbling puddles on the floor.

No sooner had I recovered from the shock, the puddles oozed downstairs into the deepest of Koel House’s cellars. There, in a vast underground cistern, they pooled, settled, and drifted off to sleep, briefly-sprouted eyes fluttering as they descended into endless dreams.

But even in sleep, they murmured with dripping, half-formed mouths and voices belong to both the Koels and the visitors, speaking of things that both had experienced – proof that their minds were perfectly preserved in liquid form.

And there in that cistern they remain to this day, along with every victim Koel House has ensnared since it was first abandoned.

The next month, Koel House began luring in new tourists, ready to begin the cycle again.

\---

You’d think the sight of people being reduced to living syrup every year would be the worst part of this job, but you’d be wrong. I’ve seen worse than that.

First, there’s the luckless bastards who get lured into the stables or the kennels.

Apparently, Koel House misses its animals just as much as its people, and every so often, I have to tranquilize a naked man-shaped hound that'll bite anyone that gets too close... or worse, a tourist galloping through the night in terror, limbs distending into hooves as they flee, screaming for help in a voice that sounds less human with every word.

On the upside, all three variants tend to avoid strangers, so preserving secrecy isn’t too difficult. Plus, the ones who turn into the family cat tend to sleep through their own transformations even if they escape the house.

Then there was my well-intentioned mistake of 2001.

I'd become convinced that the effects of the transformation would stop beyond a certain range, that if I could just drive three escaping intruders as far away from Koel House as I could, they’d be safe.

I was so excited once I’d dropped them off, thinking it would mean the end of my tenure, that Indigo would never have to resort to such desperate measures to keep its secrets ever again.

Two hours later, a wounded hitchhiker was admitted to the local hospital, screaming about a “monster” in the nearby woods, and while she was being sedated, I drove off to the area she’d mentioned to investigate.

In a way, I’d been right: there *was* an effective range to Koel House’s influence, but that didn’t mean that the transformation would stop without it. It just meant that, without the house’s guidance, the transformation became… disorganized.

The result was a skinless, blood-dripping centaur-like fusion of a horse, Julian, and his wife Maria: it had a head that wasn’t *quite* that of a horse, two merged pairs of hands in place of front hooves, Julian’s body fused with the horse’s belly, and Maria’s armless torso writhing on its back like a misshapen fin.

I had to shoot the thing twice in each head before it finally stopped trying to kill me. Getting rid of the body took even more effort *and* wrecked the blade on my chainsaw, too.

Also, that was the night I learned that Koel House *screams* when it’s denied a resident.

Needless to say, my attempts at altruism ended there.

Of course, I’m not the only one who’s tried to resist Koel House. I could tell you stories about the times when Indigo’s town council got fed up with keeping secrets and tried to demolish Koel House, but all end the same way: in failure.

Even *artillery* hasn’t left a dent in the house’s miraculous façade.

Sometimes, though, a victim manages to resist Koel House through sheer herculean willpower... and that can be the most horrific sight of all.

In 2012, a forty-year-old ghost hunter by the name of Bill Harker paid a visit to Koel House. He ignored my warnings, of course; he wanted the big find, the one thing that could convince academia that he’d been right and get his wife to reconsider divorce…

…and as bad luck would have it, he was lured into the nursery.

He left in an RV parked just outside the wall, but he wasn’t hard to follow: his driving became increasingly erratic, likely because he was getting too short to reach the pedals.

I caught up with him at a gas station on the far side of town, and to my surprise, he didn’t seem to have changed at all.

But he looked up as I approached, and for a moment, his face was that of a terrified nine-year-old… but then he clenched his eyes shut in effort, and suddenly he was an adult again.

Then, he drove off.

As he later admitted, he was convinced that something in the area could break the “curse”, and he spent the next few days searching for it, holding back his transformation through strength of will, and almost never sleeping for fear of changing in his sleep.

After a week of tracking him all over town, I finally caught him at midnight on the seventh day, trying to ram-raid the occult library on Ambrose Street, thinking they might have a cure for his condition. Unfortunately, he was regressing so frequently by then that he couldn’t keep his foot on the gas. In the end, Harker could only bang on the door with his shrinking fists, oversized sleeves flapping like windsocks as he screamed for attention in a voice that fluctuated between adulthood and childhood with every other word.

When he saw me, he didn’t run: all his strength was focused on staying himself, and that strength had been dwindling all week, leaving him shifting from adult to child to toddler and back again.

Maybe you’ve seen films and TV shows that try to make rejuvenation look wonderous or even cute. In the real world, it’s second only to animal transformations in sheer horror. Imagine the limbs shrinking out of adult proportions, the muscles withering away, the body bloating with infantile fat; imagine the clothes continuously deflating; imagine the sound of the bones crunching with every change. It is, not to put too fine a point on it, *gross*.

And Harker got to experience it on a loop.

But even after I told Harker that there was no chance of cure, the ghost hunter didn’t give up… until his wedding ring slipped off his finger.

I still remember the howl of anguish he let out as he lunged for it, scrabbling in the gutter for the ring as it rolled towards the stormwater drain, watching helplessly as his last link to his old life plunged out of sight. When he looked up at me, his eyes were full of tears, and I could tell at once that the last ember of hope in him had just been extinguished.

Without saying a word, he handed over the keys to his RV and let me drive him to his new home.

On the way, I could see him shrinking as he willingly surrendered to his transformation, allowing Koel House to remake him entirely. By the time we got back, he had to be helped along the path through the grounds, and in the last few yards, he had to be swaddled in his enormous jacket and carried to the porch.

But it wasn’t until Livia greeted me at the door and took him from my arms that the last vestige of Harker’s personality finally faded from his eyes, and all that was left was baby Marcus.

\---

Not everyone is forced.

Some visitors believe my warnings and willingly give themselves to Koel House. Now, you might assume the only people who could do this are spiritualists, death worshippers, or people chasing dreams of immortality.

In truth, those who most commonly give themselves to the house are Koel House's own gamekeepers.

I mean, think of all the years we spend here, with no human contact except with disinterested visitors and the House’s oblivious inhabitants. No vacations, no friends, no family. Only isolation, free groceries, just enough of a salary to buy entertainment, and the offer of a pension at the end.

The gamekeepers of Koel House rarely have anything to retire *to.*

None of us bother with the pension.

Instead, we choose a room of our own free will and join the household, especially if a terminal diagnosis is involved.

The first of us, Mr Lintel, retired with tuberculosis and chose to be reborn as Livia. ""Free at last from this loveless husk without family or beauty,"" the final line of his journal read. He even opted to leave his chosen room, just so he'd remain conscious enough to feel his body changing and his identity eroding away.

Mr Gatewood's predecessor, Mr Turnkey, was left on death's doorstep by a stroke and escaped into the role of Gideon, erasing his lifelong drunkenness and rage with the exuberance of the family's happiest grandchild.

And Gatewood himself was diagnosed with stomach cancer and ended his days as Rufus, gladly accepting the eccentric artist's lifestyle as his escape from his grim, austere identity.

Based on my family's medical history, my retirement's probably going to be brought about by Alzheimer’s. You might think that’s why I’m writing this confession, for the sake of preserving my memories until I can train a replacement.

In truth, I write as a substitute for conversation, because I need at least a semblance of human contact, not just to stay sane, but to give me the strength to keep myself from joining the household before it’s my time.

Because sometimes, I’m *so* tempted.

Every year, I watch the family being reborn a little bit at a time, living out their half-lives in Koel House, unable to comprehend time or the world beyond their walls.

Every year, I descend to the cistern to look upon the lake of past victims bubbling and warping in their sleep, dreaming for eternity with all the others of their kind…

…and all I can think of is how *happy* they all are.",9,1768349237.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

Need some perspective!","On December 26th, I met a 37-year-old guy on Bumble who immediately caught my interest. He’s a math teacher. We started chatting about everything and anything. After a few days, he told me that he stopped scrolling through the app since he met me and that he’s only talking to me now.

While talking about exes and dating history, he mentioned he had been set up with friends of his friend’s wife before, but he wasn’t interested in any of them. I asked him point-blank if he was interested in me, and he said yes. I told him that I was very interested in him too.

This past Saturday night, he was at a Carnival party with friends. He texted me throughout the night and was very present, but then starting Sunday evening—complete silence. Not a single message all day Monday. Because of a bad heartbreak I went through two years ago, I went into a total panic. I kept thinking, ""Here we go again, I opened up, told him I liked him, and now he’s disappeared. Maybe he’s not into me anymore.""

Today, to ""test the waters,"" I posted a photo on Instagram of me having a coffee. He viewed the story within 5-10 minutes, but didn't say anything in the chat.

On Tuesday morning, I decided to break the ice with a lighthearted, ironic message about the Carnival. He replied immediately: he’s absolutely swamped with work. He’s a teacher and it’s mid-term grading season. He wrote: ""I’ve been at work since 6:30 AM, there are only 3 of us doing all this work.""

We chatted for a while after that. He updated me on everything: when he was packing up his papers, when he left school, and when he finally got home. I suggested we grab a coffee once this ""hellish"" period at work is over, and he replied right away: ""Sounds good! :)""

For some back story I am a 22 year old female and am currently 21 weeks pregnant with my first baby. I live with my mom while my husband and I find something else but we have our own room and the baby has a room also. This has been my house for years as I am the youngest child of 4 and my mom enjoys me being there helping her with the house after my dad’s passing in 2023. I never complained since it’s a good living situation for all of us until we get our own place, until about 4 months ago. My oldest brother (30) lost his job and couldn’t afford his apartment anymore so he asked to stay on the couch for a month or two until he got on his feet. I didn’t have an issue since it’s not my place to say if he can stay or not. Unfortunately we have passed that two month threshold and are reaching month 5. He has no motivation in life, he did get a job but gambles all his money or used it on fast food and doordash. He is absolutely filthy leaving milk jugs, dirty cups, plates, bowls on the coffee table (the kitchen is 3 feet max from the couch), he doesn’t shower, doesn’t do laundry, and doesn’t help even take the trash out or load the dishwasher. I’m at a loss of what to do and how to get him out. He doesn’t even have a car anymore since he wrecked his truck going 80mph on an icy road a few months ago. He borrows my mom’s car but in the couple weeks he’s been using it has broken her bumper off and caused multiple lights to come on in the car that were never there before. He has no respect for anyone or anything that isn’t his. My mom won’t kick him out onto the street because it’s family and i understand that but I’m having my baby in a few short months and don’t want a baby around this disgusting mess of a human.

The ceramic shattered everywhere and I just stood there staring at the brown stain dripping down to my floor. This was two days ago. I still haven't cleaned it up because every time I look at it I get so angry I can't think straight.

So here's what happened. My parents died last year in a car accident. It was sudden and horrible and I'm still processing it. They had a will from 2019 that left everything to my brother because he has three kids and I chose not to have children. The estate was worth about $890,000. House, savings, retirement accounts, everything.

I was hurt but I understood their logic. They wanted to make sure their grandkids were taken care of. My brother got the house, sold it immediately, bought a bigger place, and went on this insane spending spree. New trucks for him and his wife. A boat. They remodeled their entire kitchen. He quit his job at the plant because he said he ""deserved a break.""

Then three months ago the estate lawyer called me. He found another will dated 2023, properly signed and notarized. My parents had changed their minds. They left everything split 50/50 between us.

The lawyer explained that my mom had told him she felt guilty about the first will. That she realized they were punishing me for a personal choice and it wasn't fair. My dad apparently agreed. They'd made the new will together but never told anyone because they thought they had time to discuss it with us properly.

When I called my brother to tell him, he went ballistic. Started screaming that I was lying, that I'd somehow faked documents, that I was trying to steal from his kids. I told him to call the lawyer himself if he didn't believe me. He did. The lawyer confirmed everything.

That's when things got really ugly.

My brother showed up at my apartment the next day demanding I refuse the inheritance. He said he'd already spent most of his share. The new house has a massive mortgage. The boat payments are killing him. He's in credit card debt up to his neck because he was counting on having that full amount as a cushion.

I told him that wasn't my problem. That mom and dad had made their choice and I wasn't going to ignore their final wishes just because he'd been financially irresponsible.

He started crying. Actual tears. Said his kids would suffer. That I was being selfish because I ""just want money for vacations and a fancy car"" while he's ""trying to raise a family."" He said mom and dad would be ashamed of me.

That's when I lost it. I told him mom and dad literally wrote a new will because they realized the first one was wrong. That their actual final wish was for me to have half. That he'd assumed he was entitled to everything and spent money he didn't fully have yet.

He called me a selfish bitch. Said I was spitting on our parents' graves. Said the only reason they changed the will was because I'd probably manipulated them when they were getting older. Which is insane because I lived four hours away and he saw them every week.

I told him to get out. That's when he grabbed the mug off my counter and threw it.

His wife has been texting me nonstop. Long paragraphs about how I'm destroying their family. How their kids might have to change schools. How I'm being cruel and heartless. She even sent me pictures of the kids with captions like ""this is who you're hurting.""

My brother posted something vague on Facebook about ""family betrayal"" and ""greed"" and now extended family is getting involved. My aunt called me yesterday asking if I could ""be the bigger person"" and just let my brother have the full amount since he's already committed to those expenses.

I refused. The lawyer is moving forward with enforcing the 2023 will. My brother will have to return roughly $445,000 worth of assets or cash. He's probably going to have to sell the new house and the boat. His wife is threatening to leave him because of the financial mess.

Everyone keeps telling me I should just walk away from my half. That I don't really need it. That I'm being vindictive and punishing his children for his mistakes. My cousin said I'm ""technically right but morally wrong.""

But this was my parents' final decision. They wanted me to have this. And honestly after being treated like a second-class child my whole life because I didn't want kids, this feels like the only time they really saw me as equal to my brother.

Also his financial crisis is entirely his fault. He spent money he didn't fully have yet. He quit his job. He bought toys instead of securing his family's future. That's not on me.

But I can't sleep. My brother won't speak to me. Half the family has taken his side. His youngest is seven and she sent me a drawing last week of our family and I'm scribbled out in black marker.

AITA for not giving up my inheritance?

1. Black coffee as much as needed (although from experience I know after the first week or so I will naturally go off of this, it starts feeling too acidic and makes me too jittery)
2. 1 unflavoured LMNT during the day
3. Nothing else but water and unlfavoured sparkling minteral water
4. 1 bowl of 200 calorie soup allowed in the evening - I will likely be having heinz cream of tomato soup. It is sweet and processed, I know, but it worked the first time and gave me something to look forward to all day. It did the trick.
5. Take all my normal vitamins with dinner (vitamin D, coq10, womens probiotic, vitmain C) + sleep time vitamins (0.3mg melatonin, 400g magnesium glycinate, 125mg ashwaganda) - this is my usual vitamin protocol

I've done this fast a few times, although it's been many years now.

A bit about me and why i'm doing this fast. 28 year old female working in IB, just started a new job about 3-4 months ago at one of the top financial institutions in the world. I moved cities, i'm here on my own, and I have been very overwhelmed and stress eating. In the past 2 months I've gained 10 lbs (i'm 5""3 so it makes a significant difference, my work trousers are barely fitting) - but even more so than the weight gain is the HORRIBLE mental health.

I have struggled with BED (sugar) since a young girl, It had been almost 2 years since an ""episode"", and after a particularly stressful christmas period at work where I wasn't able to be with my family because I was working, i completely spiralled. It's been about 2 weeks now of horrible binge eating, and I am strugglign to get a grasp of it.

This fast is MUCH MUCH more than weight loss. This fast is to regain control of my mind, discipline, and boundaries. I am an anxious WRECK and I need to find peace within me again. Before taking this job I was very aligned, meditating, working out every day, working in another bank but it was a more relaxed enviornment. I was ontop of the world, in the best phyiscal and emotional state that I had ever been in my life.

Not only am I going to get back to that place, but I am going to surpass it.

My main issues: comfort eating AT WORK. I know that's crazy, with how busy I am, but there are a lot of hours where you're ""waiting around"" for work to be reviewed by senior leaders, and that's when I eat the whole damn kitchen.

I'm making this reddit thread and I'm going to post daily diaries at the end of every day! Something to keep me accountable, and for those times where I desperately need to disconnect from work but i'm not able to leave my desk. I can write an update on how I'm feeling and doing.

First a little bit of context,  I (F28) work in a political organization in my country where most are volunteers, but there is a small set of people who are paid employees. I am currently in charge of overseeing a section that has both. 

At the beginning of the year when my organization began operations I was really clear with everyone on the team that not everyone was going to be in a paid role, but that we were trying our best to get everyone some support and to eventually pay most of the team. Our team agreed on a list of who would get paid first when the opportunity was available.

There was this very particular member, let’s call her Anna (26), that had a harsh context. She is a single mom that lives in an underprivileged part of the city. She was a dedicated and talented member. One day she told me that she lost her main source of income and that she was going to need to look for another job, which meant that she didn`t know if she was still going to be able to work as a volunteer in my team.

Knowing this, and considering the work she had done, I made the decision to skip the list (the other members reluctantly agreed) and try to find her a paid role. Surprisingly I was able to offer her a paid role just below my pay bracket. 

For about 8 months everything went well and the team tried to support her in every way we could. For example I allowed  her to do home office one day a week as that day no one could pick up her kid (M 6). She brought her kid to work and non work commitments and even when she made a mistake that cost hundreds of dollars I lent her the money so she would not get in trouble. 

Through these months the organization started having some financial problems. Which caused most paychecks to be very late, I could not do much to support her but at least at this point she had gained two other small gigs that at least provided her some income.

Things started to get complicated. She had issues with almost every member of the team. I trayed talking the issues out with the intention of everyone being comfortable. When she had issues with me I took her out once for coffee and once for lunch so that we could talk and both make changes to our behaviour. 

Her behaviour escalated. She was being rude to the volunteers across the country. She would ignore me when she got mad at something. When a member of the team tried to give a different one more responsibility, she accused him of only doing so because he wanted to sleep with her. She shit talked some of the leaders with lies that she spread around, she also spread private conversations manipulating what was said to create conflict. She spent most of her time in the office playing games on her Ipad. I was stuned when I learned that she had brought a guy over to the shared office to have sex.

I did not know how to talk to her anymore, but the most stupid fight was what sent her over the edge. I was giving free debate training to the team. She was debating and got distracted doing something else from her other job. When it was her turn she asked us to wait, the debate had only 2 minutes left, we did wait for about ten minutes though. After that as a joke I said ‘Everyone look at Anna till she finishes’ so that we could finish the exercise and get back to work (we have a very joky dynamic). She yelled at me ‘I don't care if you look at me, at least for this I get paid.’  (the paycheck was very late) I answered ‘it is not about you getting paid to learn, im giving you something for free that I usually charge’ She yelled again, I paused the exercise and left telling them calmly that I would see them tomorrow. 

Later that evening I got a text saying that she did not feel comfortable in the team anymore. That decisions were being made unilaterally and that I was praising some people's work over others. From her text I understood that she was quitting and quite honestly I felt relieved. So I just thanked her for her time, wished her luck on future endeavors and asked her to hand over the things that only she had. I already knew who was going to take on her paycheck and responsibilities.

The next day she showed up to the office and started helping out another team. I was shocked. I gathered the leaders together and with my team told them about the situation. They spoke with her and apparently she was not quitting, just quitting my team. The thing is I need to pay someone else to take on her responsibilities. So I can't afford to lose that money for my team, especially as many have been waiting for over a year as volunteers. So I asked the leadership to let her go, and they told me they couldn’t because she is a single mom and we owe her money. 

Her spot on the payroll was gained through the amazing work that everyone on the team did, and through the financial crisis it was maintained because of the same reason. I think that it is unfair for the decision of one person to hurt an entire team. 

My position is that she quit the job she was hired to do, so she would not be fired, she had already quit. They say that it can be viewed as asking for a reassignment. I feel that the situation is unfair and that I have to fight for that spot, but am I the asshole?",8,1768348787.0,TwoHotTakes,8,0.83,False
1qc7slz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qc7slz,That Amnesia Plot? It Bankrupted Him. Sugar Mama's Cashing Out.,"My boyfriend Silas Brennan woke up from a car crash and forgot me.


But he found his rich bio parents. Got a beautiful fiancée. And built a perfect life.


Me? I was just the ""gold-digger"" who wouldn't leave him alone.


He let his fiancée shove me to the ground. Let her kill our baby.


When we were both trapped in the fire? He didn't think twice—ran straight to his fiancée, Lillian Warner.


I heard him through the flames:


""Aria. I never lost my memory. You just owe me this.""


""Next life? Leave me alone.""


When I opened my eyes again, I was back to the day he woke up.


This time I didn't cry. Didn't beg him to remember.


Just handed him a bill.


""Mr. Brennan. I'm Aria Winters. Your sponsor.""


""Ten years of support. One point two million dollars.""


""Cash or card?""


---


""The hell did you just say?""


Silas stared me down, clearly not expecting that.


His fiancée Lillian Warner laughed in my face.


""Who the hell are you? Some broke bitch playing dress-up? Get your Dollar Store ass outta here.""


This time I wasn't playing nice. ""I paid for Silas's entire life for ten years.""


""A million two. And yeah, my lawyer's got all the receipts if you wanna see 'em.""


Last life I grabbed his hands, sobbing my eyes out, begging him to remember our decade together.


Begging him to just look at our matching rings.


The guy who swore he'd love me forever? Ripped off that ring and tossed it straight in the trash.


Then had security haul me to the police station for twenty-four hours.


Dead silence in that hospital room. Everyone just stared.


Silas's face changed. His fists clenched tight.


He thought I'd break down like before.


Thought I'd beg him to remember so he could use his fake ""amnesia"" to torture me.


Lillian got all pissy. ""That's all you want, right? His money?""


I didn't even blink. ""Hell yeah. That's all this is.""


I turned to leave.


But then my phone buzzed. Screen lit up with our photo—us all wrapped up together.


Lillian snatched it before I could react and smashed it on the floor, just like she smashed my ten years.


Then scalding coffee came pouring over my head.


Boiling water ran down my hair, down my neck. Burning so bad I couldn't stop shaking.


""Trash like you doesn't get to touch his money.""


I started to move but Lillian shoved me before I could swing.


Silas didn't do shit. Just watched.


Whatever. I was over it. Fished out his keys and threw them in his face.


""Your old place—you got one day to grab your stuff.""


""Miss that? I'm tossing everything.""


Silas froze up.


Last life I was too blind to see through his act.


His mouth opened like he wanted to say something.


But I walked out without looking back.


Someone grabbed my arm from behind.


""Aria!""


I stopped and turned around. ""You don't remember anything, right? So how'd you know my name?""


He looked like I caught him. ""So we're... what, just some sponsorship deal? That's it?""


I nodded and left.


Isn't that what you wanted?


Last life you denied us. This life I'm giving you exactly what you asked for.


Lillian's voice drifted out from the room.


""Silas, are you kidding? You actually hit THAT?""


Dead silence. Then he exhaled hard.


""Look, I was dirt poor. They paid for everything—school, food, rent. The fuck was I gonna do, say no?""


""Girlfriend, boyfriend—whatever. I was more like... I don't know, a rescue dog?""


I bit down hard as tears hit the floor.


He kept going, tearing me apart piece by piece.


My personality, my habits—trashing everything about me like putting me down would somehow make his new life more legit.


I remembered when he said I was his everything.


How he burned his hands making soup for me.


How he saved up for months just to buy me that necklace.


Even our baby we were so excited about—watching it bleed out in front of him didn't make him blink.


I touched my stomach. If he doesn't want it, then I'm not keeping it either.


Chapter 2


I scheduled the abortion for Thursday. Sat there staring at the confirmation email for like twenty minutes.


Next thing I did? Listed my shop.


Oh, and I hired a private investigator.


Back home, everything still looked the same.


The wind chimes in the living room? He made those. Spent a whole weekend on them.


Those succulents on the balcony—he watered them every Sunday like clockwork.


And the fridge. Stuffed with my favorite drinks, plastered in his stupid sticky notes.


\[Don't skip breakfast.\]


\[Love you.\]


I ran my fingers over those yellowing notes, peeled them off one by one, and tossed them in the trash.


That night I dreamed about us.


In it, we were still in this little place. He had an apron on, cooking something in the kitchen while I tried to help.


He kept shooing me away to go watch TV. Never let me lift a finger around the house.


Even cut up fruit and fed it to me.


When things got heated we'd stay home all day, wrapped up in each other.


I didn't want to wake up. Not until the doorbell jolted me back.


Second I opened the door, a bank card smacked me in the face.


""Your money.""


""I'm grabbing my stuff.""


Silas stood there in this sharp suit, face cold as ice—nothing like the guy in the apron from my dream.


He brought Lillian with him.


When he saw that our wedding photo still hanging in the living room, he stopped dead.


If I hadn't wanted to respect my parents' memory for three years, we would've gotten married last year.


Everything was ready except actually doing it.


""Wedding photos? Seriously? You actually thought you were gonna marry up?""


I grabbed the baseball bat from the corner and swung it straight at the frame.


Glass exploded everywhere.


""Aria! What the hell!""


Silas's face went dark. He yanked Lillian behind him, protecting her.


Like he thought I'd swing the bat at her next.


His hand shoved me aside.


I grabbed my stomach on instinct, fell and caught myself on broken glass.


Staring at that destroyed wedding photo, he actually laughed.


""Why'd you fake it at the hospital?""


He kept staring, waiting for me to break.


I didn't even look at him. Just started throwing his stuff in a pile—didn't care if things broke.


""Wait—Silas, you're really gonna take this trash? It's all so... cheap.""


Lillian wrinkled her nose and kicked over one of the boxes.


That music box he gave me—my first gift from him. The little dancer used to spin inside.


Hit the floor with a sharp crack.


Something I treasured like gold, now broken in half. Yet I felt nothing.


Silas stayed quiet the whole time, just had his guys haul everything out.


Right before leaving he asked, voice low:


""You're really gonna let me walk that easy?""


I looked down and smiled bitterly.


""Seriously? This is exactly what you wanted, Silas. Don't act surprised now.""


Last life, if he'd just been honest—said he was done—I wouldn't have held on.


But he had to put on this whole show. Treated me like dirt. Let Lillian trash me over and over.


Even when I lost the baby right in front of him, he didn't go after her.


Blamed me instead. And made me apologize.


He played me like a fool, tortured me for fun.


I could feel this weird hatred coming off him.


But I never got where it came from.


Lillian grabbed my arm then, thinking I was still trying to hang on.


I slapped her hard across the face.


The crack echoed through the room. Next second Silas's hand flew at me.


""Are you fucking insane!""


The hit whipped my head to the side. Everything went dark for a second, then this white-hot burst of pain across my cheek.


My hand shook but I smiled anyway.


""Get your stuff and get the fuck out. Now.""


I shoved them out and slammed the door. Tears rolled down my face, over that handprint on my cheek.


My chest hurt so bad. Nausea hit me like a truck.


Barely made it to the bathroom before I threw up.


That slap? Payback for Lillian making me lose my baby last time.


Silas and me? We're done.


Chapter 3


I sat in that freezing hallway outside the OB-GYN, waiting for them to call my number when—


""What are you doing here?""


Fuck. Silas. I crushed the report in my fist before he could see it.


""Doctor's appointment.""


He stared at the OB-GYN sign. His face went from confused to pale in about two seconds.


His mouth opened—


""Silas, babe!""


Lillian practically skipped over, all smiles, grabbed his arm possessively.


""Come on, doctor's waiting.""


She rubbed her flat stomach. ""Three months now—he's gonna explain all the dad stuff.""


My breath stopped. Three months.


That early.


Last life, three months ago was when his startup was falling apart.


He was out chasing clients all the time. I felt so bad watching him exhausted, dropped everything at my shop to cook for him and take care of him.


Turns out it wasn't even the business.


He'd already found his rich parents. Already knocked someone else up.


No wonder he freaked when I hit Lillian.


And last life when I lost my baby he didn't even react.


Because he already had another kid on the way.


Lillian noticed me then, smirking.


""Wait—you're pregnant too?""


""Yeah, nice try. Faking a doctor's note isn't gonna get you into this family, hon.""


I looked her dead in the eye. Didn't blink.


""Paranoia's a real thing. Might wanna get that checked. Not everyone's after your man.""


Lillian's face went red. Then the tears started.


""Silas!"" Her voice went all shaky. ""Why's she being such a bitch to me?""


""Last time she shoved me I bled for hours!""


Silas's face turned to ice.


At his silent nod, two security guys dragged me into a stairwell.


They grabbed my hair and yanked my head back.


SMACK!


Brutal slap across my face.


Other guard raised his foot toward my stomach.


I squeezed my eyes shut, hands flying to my belly.


Even though I didn't want this baby, I didn't want it gone like this.


But Silas stepped between us first.


""Lillian, come on. Doctor said you need to stay calm, remember? Just let it go, okay?""


His voice went all gentle as he guided her away, half-carrying her.


Never looked at me once, curled up on the floor.


Some nurse finally found me and helped me out.


Ding\~


My screen lit up with a message from Silas.


I didn't even open it. Just blocked his number. And sat in that hospital hallway with tears dropping onto my hands.


They were calling me. I could hear it—my name crackling through the speakers, over and over.


But I couldn't move. Couldn't make my legs work.


Until my shop girl called. Said someone trashed my flower shop.


That got me up.


I walked. Didn't look at the surgery sign. Didn't look at anything. Just walked the other way.

The rest of the time the espresso either tastes extremely bitter or they look like the one on the right. Murky brown with no foam on top of the ice, no milk/espresso separation and taste like bitter water and syrup. Every time they’ve looked like this they also taste nasty.

I ordered this through the drive thru and was given one that looked like the one on the right. I tasted it, it tasted like old coffee water and syrup so I brought it back in and asked for it to be remade. They remade it for me, but handed me another one that looked and tasted exactly the same. I took it and left because I assume she didn’t know how to make the drink and I’m not going to ask for a 3rd one. I got another one from a different store (left) that was good. 

What is it that is wrong? I’ve only asked for a drink to be remade 2 or 3 time in my life, but I don’t know what to say besides it tastes bad/wrong. I used to just tough it out and drink it anyway but these are too expensive to choke down or throw away. ",26,1768348649.0,starbucks,16,0.91,False

I've had really good lattes made with oat milk at coffee shops, so I tried using my homemade oat milk to make hot cocoa. But the result is .... pretty much pudding. 

It gets really thick, figure halfway between liquid and actual pudding. This doesn't happen with the oat milk you buy in the cartons. This is understandable; there's a lot of stabilizers and such in those. So I guess my question: has anyone successfully used their homemade oat milk in a heated beverage? If so, what's your recipe? (Mine: 1 to 4 ratio of oats to water, dash of salt, blend mercilessly, strain.) 

The flavor is actually pretty good, but it's too thick for  hot cocoa. Similar topic: can you make pudding with oats?? The texture is very smooth and nice; seems like it'd be possible.

I got a busy life and work schedule, but I devote my limited free time towards this game. Hence, why I have to research and plan my gameplay very strategically to be as efficient as possible to maximize playtime. 

I finally got to Chapter 4 (Law) after like 7 months. I watch a lot of Coffee Potato videos on the game and just finished listening to his “Tactics Ogre Reborn: Chapter 4 Guide for Long Attention Span” for some guidance but left me still confused.

Hoping the community here can give me the most efficient step by step recommended order of play and timeline for Chapter 4 Law. So, I don’t backtrack or run around the map aimlessly trying to figure out what to do.

As in side quests, unique characters, dungeons, POTD, etc. I should do before the last dungeon/map in Chapter 4 to finish the game. 

I don’t have the luxury to dump hundreds of hours in this game due to RL obligations. Therefore, I want to have the most efficient gameplay as possible.

I 30 stayed home from work today because I have vertigo like symptoms and could not go to work. BF 27 decided to stay home to ""take care of me"". We have 2 kids both male 7 and 3. Getting ready for work I couldnt do much besides puke, dry heave and get nauseous from moving around and asked bf if he could take 7 yo to school since I was having a hard time. He got upset that he was going to be late to a class that started at 8 (first I heard of him going to class) that was across the city..... It was 7:30 at the time and it takes more than 40 mins to get to said class and the kids school is a 10 min drive including the drop off time. He was mad  and said ""why even try"" then proceed to be angry about 7yo not being dressed (missing his coat, backpack, and shoes). I was and still feel like ass so I was going to call my mom who normally babysits while I'm at work to pick up 3yo but I got his call and decided to not call her. Bf went to drop off kid and called saying there no point in going to work and he was going to stay home to help me out. ** 3 yo is in an attachment phase and wants mom all the time.** Now bf comes home and is slightly helpful, let me take a hot bath to see if I would feel better (It didn't work), and gave 3yo food (he doesn't eat a lot right now and it's a struggle) I tired to take a nap after the bath but the baby kept coming into the room and bf came in a put a kids show on for him (my head is vibrating with pain at this point). I start googling why this is happening since it's the second time I've been dizzy and puking (it not vertigo went to the hospital for it the first time and they couldnt figure it out) I finally looked up if I could be overdoing it with vitamin because I recently started taking a new liquid multivitamin and all the symptoms aligned. Bf comes in and is upset I'm on my phone and I let him know what I found out and his attitude changes completely. He goes to sit in the living room leaving me in charge of 3 yo with the tv blasting. I still manage to sleep for 20 mins and then he comes in telling me I need to eat and drink I agree and he makes me oatmeal I thank him because it's not a regular occurrence. And he starts ranting about the 3yo not eating but continuing to snack. I'm beyond dizzy and trying really hard not to give into the nauseous feeling since I did need something in my stomach. I was able to eat half and drink some coffee to see if maybe it would cause to movement and help me not be so nauseous (bad idea). Went back to bed to see if I could get some rest but again 3yo followed and bf did nothing to help out besided get upset. He turned on the living room TV to play videogames. I couldn't sleep because baby wanted to play and wouldn't stop poking my eyes to let me know it's morning time. Noon comes and goes and bf is lost in the bathroom for another hour. I get up to make some lunch and am struggling to walk to the kitchen. I manage to get some soup in a pot, and start it then processed to be restroom where I try not to puke and hope for a bowel movement. Come back out and bf is still in the other bathroom. I go check food and he comes out stating ""oh I was about to come and start something"" it's was almost 1:30pm at this point and 3yo is attempting to eat candy and cookies. I come back to my room to lay down and hope the nausea goes away. He comes in a complains about how it's a waste to attempt to feed 3yo since he doesn't eat anyways. I ignore it and go sit at the table and he is nice enough to serve me and 3yo soup. He starts arguing with 3 yo about eating and not taking my Gatorade and my head was pounding so I gave it to him so they would stop. I finished half the soup and went to lay down again because it's the only thing that's helping. 3 yo follows and all bf did was say ""leave her alone"". I give in because hearing him yell from another room hurts more than the baby rolling all over me so I attempted to nap again (was unsuccessful) at the same time bf ends up taking a nap on couch and is late to pick up 7yo from school I get upset and ask what was the point in him staying home if I honestly got no help from him. He got upset about how he's tired too and we started arguing. I told him honestly I would have preferred you had gone to work instead of staying home because you weren't much help. Now he's mad at me saying I'm ungrateful and unforgiving that people make mistakes. That he still when to get the 7yo and it's not like the world ended.

I’m excited for a fresher look in the kitchen, but no one really talks about the clutter/crap part of it, lol.

Oh and we are also painting a bedroom (we’re empty nesters and turning it into hubby’s office) so we also had to empty THAT which was filled with old furniture and a ton of buckets of kid stuff that they want to keep but don’t want at THEIR apartment. \*sigh \* that crap has overflowed into my office and the living room.

I’m a thoughtful, caring, outdoors-loving, video game-loving, tech professional in the Seattle/PNW area who values kindness, laughter, respect, animals, art, and meaningful connection, leans left politically while valuing open discussion, am seeking a local ish (or relocating) partner for a long-term, potentially lifelong relationship built on friendship, humor, shared adventures, aligned values, and mutual care, with openness to exchanging photos early on and growing together over time. 

The Long Version:

I’m someone who believes the best relationships are built on laughter, kindness, and genuine connection. Friends would describe me as thoughtful, caring, and the kind of person who remembers the little things. I love the outdoors, whether it’s a peaceful hike, a day at the park, or just watching the sunset.

When I’m not outside, you might find me exploring my love for computers and video games, visiting a museum, or appreciating art in all its forms. Animals hold a special place in my heart, and I’m happiest when I’m sharing life with a fellow good-spirited soul. I firmly believe people should be treated with respect at all times, but I am more than capable of standing up to others when there is a need, which there rarely is. There is no room in this life for hate of others, and far too many people seem to make hate their whole personality. 

A Few Things You Should Know About Me:

I am left leaning and identify most closely with the Democratic Party on most things, but I approach every issue on its own merits, so there are some issues where I take the GOP stance on, I am more than happy to answer questions you may have. 

You do not have to be a democrat by any means, but please be prepared to briefly discus politics when you reach out, to ensure our ideals align. 

I currently live in Washington state, specifically the Seattle area, so I am mainly looking for those in the Pacific Northwest (PNW), as that will make it easier for us to visit each other with some regularity, the PNW is comprised of WA, OR, northern CA, parts of ID, and part of British Columbia. If you are however outside of this area, please only reach out to me if you are able to commit to moving WA state in the near future, as I don’t expect to be in a position to leave the State anytime soon. 

I currently work in tech providing support for a software company, but I am trying to jump careers, I am happy to answer more questions about this via DM.

Please be ready to share pics with me in the first 3 days of chatting if we hit it off, and I will do the same, although I have no issues exchanging pics on day 1 either. 

What I’m Looking For:

I’m hoping to meet someone loving, funny, and full of life, someone who’s up for adventures big and small, from deep conversations over coffee to spontaneous weekend getaways. A good heart and a great sense of humor are important for me. I am looking for my forever partner, and while I am not specifically looking for marriage, I am definitely open to it with the right person. 

I want a partner who is a true friend that I can love and care for, who can also love and care for me.

1qc7iot,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qc7iot,The Edit - Dupont Circle Hotel Washington DC,"Made a last minute booking last year to use these credits.

**Hotel Review**

Overall we enjoyed our stay. I've traveled to a handful of places in my life but usually on the good value end. I'd give the hotel a 8/10 for what it aims to be at the prices we (would've) paid.

Every staff member, front desk to housekeeping, were extremely polite and helpful. The attached restaurant (The Pembroke) was also staffed with great people. Only issues we had were that the heated bathroom tile floors were extremely slow and only heated in certain hotspots (I've experienced heated floors in several Airbnbs and they were much better and covered the entire floor), the shower setup with a swinging half door was odd, and the shower heads could be upgraded. Sorry, forgot to take pics of the room itself.

**Perks (Attached)**

One tier room upgrade (Booked Deluxe King and got Executive King) At the time of booking Classic King and Deluxe King were the same price

Late checkout of 2 PM granted

""VIP welcome amenity"": Full bottle of The Mountain Spring Water and Macarons that are sold downstairs at their coffee shop

$100 food and beverage credit: Used at Pembroke for Dinner, does not cover tax/tips/fees. You can also use it for room service but we saw that room service had a delivery fee of sort so we saved it for dinner. Unfortunately, while the dinner menu tasted great, the proportions for the prices paid were not what we had expected, especially compared to their breakfast offerings.

Daily breakfast $45 per guest per day: MORE than enough for breakfast. I had to get a main, sides, and drinks and that barely reached the $45.

**The Finances**

2 Night Weekend Stay, Refundable

Direct booking \~$580 Deluxe King \~$650 Executive King  
Chase Portal $577.44

577.44 = 250 Edit Credit - 320 (16k MR) - 7.44 Cash. (The $257 portion triggered the Edit credit AND my entire travel credit so I don't have to worry about getting value from the travel part now)

$74.64 in taxes/tips/fees from dining at their restaurant.

I also redeemed 18,500 per person AA points to fly round trip from PHL to DCA, which I know isn't great but I didn't want to pay cash while also wanted to checkout the Sapphire Lounge in PHL (Does it need a separate review? I think there's many that covered it already)

  
Overall it's hard to compare value because we get these credits by paying the annual fees and I know its controversial to assign cash values to certain perks but for the sake of $ to $ comparison, I got nearly $1000 in value while paying $242 out of pocket, including 16k MR at 1cpp.",8,1768348068.0,ChaseSapphire,2,1.0,False

And my girlfriend I told her I want to be ALONE but she still comes trying to convince me like “Trust me it isn’t that important so many people don't drive plus I can drive you* or “How about we go get coffee for a bit?” Or she comes saying “How can I make you feel better?” when I clearly said Leave me alone 

If it’s not important why do you have it in the first place? Like huh? And someone else driving me would not make me feel better about myself

Here's what actually worked (and what's BS).","Got tired of saving posts I'd never read again. So I actually tested the most upvoted advice from [r/getdisciplinedfor](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplinedfor/) 6 weeks.

Here's the honest breakdown.

What actually worked

The ""2-minute rule"" from Atomic Habits. I thought it was too simple to matter. It's not. When I couldn't bring myself to work out, I'd just put on my gym shoes. That's it. Most days, once the shoes were on, I kept going. The trick was lowering the activation energy.

Habit stacking. Attaching new habits to existing ones actually stuck. ""After I pour my morning coffee, I write one sentence in my journal."" The anchor habit does the heavy lifting.

Environment design over willpower. I moved my phone charger to another room. That single change did more for my sleep than any app or ""bedtime routine"" I tried. Willpower is finite. Environment is always on. I also realized I slept better once I stopped putting my phone in my bed.

Tracking streaks but only one habit at a time. Tried tracking five things simultaneously. Failed at all of them. Tracked just one (reading) for 30 days, then added another. Stacking habits one at a time works. Tracking many at once didn't work.

What didn't work (for me):

""Wake up at 5 AM."" I tried it for two weeks. Was exhausted, unproductive, and miserable. Found out my natural rhythm is 7 AM. Forcing an arbitrary wake time did nothing but make me hate mornings more.

Cold showers as a ""discipline builder."" Did it for a month. Didn't transfer to other areas of my life. Just made me dread showering. Some people swear by it. I'm not one of them.

""Don't break the chain."" The moment I missed one day, I felt like the whole thing was ruined. Switched to ""never miss twice"" instead. Way more sustainable.

Elaborate morning routines. Journaling, meditation, stretching, cold shower, affirmations, reading all before 7 AM then I burned out in a week. Simplified to: water, movement, one priority task. That's it. Way simpler but I stick to it more.

The lesson:

Most habit advice is someone sharing what worked for them, not what will work for you. The real skill is testing things, noticing what sticks, and dropping what doesn't without guilt.

Let me know if this helped.

1qc7fjv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/comments/1qc7fjv/things_i_wish_i_could_tell_those_in_my_life_about/,Things I wish I could tell those in my life about this medicine and me.,"I wish I could explain to them that I don't have the relationship to food they have. No matter how much I wanted to.

I wish I could tell them I thought about food \*all the time\*. No matter what. Even if I was eating I was thinking about the next meal.

  
I wish I could make them understand that I never felt full, not once, in my adult life, before this medicine.  I didn't know what it felt like. The first time it happened after this medicine I \*thought something was wrong with my stomach\*. 

  
I wish I could explain how much I paid attention to others eating when we went out, because I didn't want to be seen as the obese glutton at the table who never stopped eating (even if it was true). I would set my fork down when I tracked that every else was finishing up - I never wanted to be the first one done \*or\* the last one eating. 

  
I wish I could explain the addiction to food I had. It seems silly, because it's not drugs or alcohol. But sometimes I needed that snack for a dopamine hit. Sad? Eat. Stressed? Eat. Happy? Eat. Bored? Eat. Awake? Eat.

  
I wish I could relay the guilt and shame I felt when I would go to pick up dinner for my family, and I would get something for myself and eat it all before I got home, and then eat with them. The shame \*and\* dopamine hit that I got from keeping snack cakes (Zebra Cakes are my kryptonite) in my car and eating them when I was alone. Or going out to run an errand and immediately stop and grab something from a gas station or drive thru and tell no one. 

  
I wish I could explain food noise to someone who doesn't have it. It sounds made up. I wish I could explain that 'just eating less' and 'counting calories' doesn't work for someone who has intense food noise all the time.

I wish that I didn't feel the absolute shame I felt seeing the photos of myself at a recent friends and family vacation. It took an immense amount of strength not to delete every single one of them. Like an old Richard Simmons ad, I couldn't believe that was me.



After starting this medicine? 

  
I wish that I could properly explain what it feels like for the food noise to just \*be gone\*. 

  
I wish I could make them understand I don't crave sugar anymore, like an addict doesn't crave a hit. I haven't had a soda since September 2025. I have only had three cups of coffee since then, and they were only bc I needed the caffeine to stay awake to drive. I had an entire box of Little Debbie Christmas Tree Cakes in my house and I didn't touch one of them. I wasn't restricting myself - I didn't WANT THEM. I didn't think about them. They didn't consume my thoughts. 

I wish it was easy to explain to someone I can now just have one of something, like a cookie, and be satisfied, instead of twelve. My birthday came and went and I threw away half of the little bunt cake I got after two days, instead of eating it all immediately and wanting more. A few bites was plenty.

I wish it was more clear how much better I feel, and that it wasn't all mental. My joints don't hurt; I didn't realize the pain I was in from inflammation wasn't normal. My resting heart rate went down. My sleep apnea has even improved. My head is less brain foggy. I don't shop as much - which is crazy to say. Even some of the slight PCOS symptoms I had have eased up.

I wish this medicine wasn't seen as 'the easy way'. It's not easy. I had to completely relearn how to eat. I don't track calories, I track protein and fiber. Does the average person know how hard it is to have 125g of protein and 25g of fiber a day, when you don't want to eat? But if you don't, your hair falls out, you can't use the bathroom, you feel lethargic. I went from at minimum 4 Dr Pepper Zeros a day to nothing but water (which is fine, that's all I want now) but I'm drinking at least 100 ounces daily. 

  
Like anything, I wish it was more understood that while some are abusing this medicine, the majority is not. 10% of people are now on a GLP-1 medicine. They have been around and researched for 20 years. They are helping reduce strokes, reduce liver disease, helping cardiovascular health, helping opioid, alcohol and nicotine addiction - not just food addiction. 

  
More than anything, I wish I could explain to my friends and family that I'm ashamed to tell them I'm on something that made me feel like an entire new person. I've lost almost 35 pounds as of now, but I've gained a new perspective on \*me\*. 

I wish I knew for sure that they would understand, and not judge.

With the rising costs of basically everything, but most specifically components to build gaming-capable computers, we see an opportunity to offer the community a safe place to do these things.

Our vision is to create an establishment where teens, students, and adults can participate in events, giveaways, and gaming tournaments, or simply come to play PC games.

We want to offer a full menu, coffee, and even beer/wine (after a certain time so we can safely allow minors to enjoy the establishment.)

Ideally, the establishment would be teen-friendly in the day, allowing them to utilize our equipment to play PC games, study, eat, or have a coffee, and after a certain time, make it adult-focused by offering beer/wine and a place to hang out.

Doc gave me a rating - 4 was not classified as gerd, 6 was classified as gerd, i was at a 5! had to go off of my pantoprazol for 7 days before BRAVO, and stay off of it for another few days. 

Well whaddaya know but the PPI had been making my gerd worse! the week before BRAVO i avoided EVERY trigger food. got special groceries and everything. then BRAVO week i indulged in triggers. after my BRAVO, i started taking my 40mg pantoprazol every other day... in october, november, then december i started taking it every 2 days... now its January and im taking 20mg pantoprazol somewhere between every day and every other day. i chew gum pretty much all the time and that also helps really well. been eating mac and cheese and hash browns recently. ive been fine!! 

I stay faaar away from the usual triggers like anything with chocolate in it, raw onion, tomatoes, coffee and caffeinated drinks. bagels, marshmallows, and tortilla chips are on my out list too. but i can enjoy a soda sometimes and be fine. when i want a sweet drink, Gatorade gives me GERD so i swapped it out for vitamin water, which must have something super basic in it because it doesn't really even taste acidic at all. 

i think by the end of 2026 im gonna have this thing down. i was worried too like two years ago that my gerd would NEVER go away, and EVERYTHING gave me gerd. everyone is different but just 7 days on a really really strict diet and no PPI helped me be able to get back on the PPI, and have it work better while i started to ween off. and i think im starting to realize that my body builds a tolerance to PPIs.",5,1768347734.0,GERD,1,1.0,False

I’m not trying to escape my life or fill a void. But if my forever person is out there, I'm finally ready to let him in.

Family matters to me. My Christian faith matters to me. My values and beliefs run deep. I’m introverted but not shy, equally happy in a ridiculous conversation that makes no sense or a quiet one that goes somewhere deep. I’m playful, affectionate, and loyal with *my* person.

Vibes, not dealbreakers:
• Dry humor over sarcasm
• Bougie hotels over camping
• Football over anime
• The Good Place over The West Wing
• Bruno Mars over Metallica
• Ford Broncos over Harley Davidsons
• Iced coffee over alcohol
• Productive mornings over wild nights
• Tattoos over piercings
• Authentic feelings over performative actions

I’m drawn to someone brave, emotionally intelligent, consistent, communicative, and self-aware. Someone who can flirt and laugh at himself but is solid and strong at his core. Intelligence matters to me, as does having your life together. I’m looking for a complete connection… mental, emotional, and physical are all necessary.

You can be from anywhere, but relocation would need to be possible on your end. I'm not looking to rush or force things, but I also don't want a forever penpal. I’m looking for the kind of chemistry that makes us want to make real plans. If I sound like I could be your person, say more than hello. Tell me something real, something funny, or something that shows me how your mind works.

My partner and I are exploring a possible business venture in Chico and we very much value and would like to hear your thoughts to help shape us.

  
With the rising costs of basically everything, but most specifically components to build gaming-capable computers, we see an opportunity to offer the community a safe place to do these things.

  
Our vision is to create an establishment where teens, students, and adults can participate in events, giveaways, and gaming tournaments, or simply come to play PC games. 

We want to offer a full menu, coffee, and even beer/wine (after a certain time so we can safely allow minors to enjoy the establishment.)

  
Ideally, the establishment would be teen-friendly in the day, allowing them to utilize our equipment to play PC games, study, eat, or have a coffee, and after a certain time, make it adult-focused by offering beer/wine and a place to hang out.

  
The link below will take you to a Typeform survey, if you'd be so kind to give us your thoughts and opinions on this, we would be very grateful!

Recently napapaisip lang din ako about dito and may mga nababasa lang din ako dito sa reddit and gusto ko na sya itanong fully for opinion na din ng iba. 

Context: I tried dating app before and as you all know syempre at first doon, madami ka talaga din mamemeet and ayon makaka chat sabay sabay diba? Unless siguro na love at first sight ka na tapos nag click talaga na kayo agad. Ayon so may mga few na nalipat ang convo sa other platforms. Sometimes naman ay naaya lang mag coffee or dinner (that’s it lang) and if hindi ko feel or wala talaga connection or simply di ko type in person, i’ll just stop talking to them. So ayon na nga, there’s this one guy na parang ayon naka vibe ko and sya yung nadate ko na din few times. Pinakilala nya na nga ako sa family nya. Pero we never talked kung “ano ba talaga kami” haha i never asked din kasi ayon ayoko din mag sound needy or something baka takot din ako ma open yung usapan na yun. So ayun, never naman pa sya nag aask maging gf ako or mapag usapan kung nanliligaw ba sya etc pero sabi nya seryoso naman daw sya. Ayon, for me lang is mali ba if mag entertain pako ng iba? dapat ba talaga maging loyal sa ka talking stage lalo na if walang kasiguraduhan naman na binibigay sayo? ang dami kasi ebas din ng iba na para sa streets daw mga ganon? haha. wala lang, if wala naman na set na clear intentions sayo, bakit parang masama pa yung girl if tumingin pa ng other choice? is it wrong to date and get to know people? di naman lagi kasi na yung first na ientertain mo and nakitaan ng potential ay yun na agad lang at mag stick ka doon kahit wala kasiguraduhan diba? ayun, lalo kasi tumatagal parang nawawalan nako gana sakanya and may mga ugali syang lumalabas na ayoko, tapos i still talk to other guys. mali ba ako? 🥹 never nya nga din nasabi na “i like you or i love you” sooo? technically im single padin naman talaga ako? ina assume nya ba na parang mag jowa na kami kahit wala sya gawin na todo effort or to ask kung ano kami or what? am i cheating na ba if i entertain other guys?

1qc73nn,https://www.reddit.com/r/focusedmen/comments/1qc73nn/how_kris_jenner_actually_built_her_empire_the/,How Kris Jenner actually built her empire: the REAL strategy nobody talks about,"You see Kris Jenner everywhere. The memes. The ""momager"" jokes. The constant tabloid headlines. But here's what nobody's really discussing: how did a woman who started as a flight attendant turn her family into a billion-dollar brand machine? Not by luck. Not by scandal. By understanding human psychology, media manipulation, and business strategy better than most Harvard MBAs.

I've spent months reading business case studies, watching hours of interviews, and analyzing the Kardashian business model. And honestly? The playbook is replicable. Whether you love them or hate them, there's serious strategy here that applies to anyone building a personal brand or business in 2025.

## Step 1: Monetize Everything (No Shame)

Most people have this mental block about making money. They think certain things should stay ""pure"" or ""authentic."" Kris doesn't have that problem. She saw that every moment, every relationship, every life event was potential content. Birthday party? Film it. Breakup? Film it. Pregnancy announcement? Make it an exclusive and sell it.

The lesson isn't about exploiting your family (obviously). It's about removing the mental barriers around monetization. You have skills, knowledge, experiences that are valuable. Stop gatekeeping them. Package them. Sell them.

Recommended resource: Read ""Crushing It!"" by Gary Vaynerchuk (New York Times bestseller, built VaynerMedia into a $200M agency). Gary breaks down exactly how to build a personal brand empire without the corporate BS. This book completely shifted how I think about content creation and authenticity in business. Best business book I've read on personal branding.

## Step 2: Control Your Narrative or Someone Else Will

Here's where Kris is genuinely brilliant. When that tape leaked in 2007, most PR experts would've told the family to hide, apologize, disappear. Kris did the opposite. She leaned into it. She got a reality show deal. She turned scandal into storyline into syndication money.

She understood something crucial: in the attention economy, all press is opportunity if you control the narrative. Don't let the media frame your story. Frame it yourself. Own it. Repurpose it.

This applies to your career too. Made a mistake at work? Don't hide from it. Own it publicly, explain what you learned, and demonstrate growth. Got rejected from something? Share the journey. People connect with authentic struggle more than polished success.

## Step 3: Build Systems, Not Just Hustle

People think the Kardashians just got lucky or work hard. Wrong. Kris built systems. She created a content production system (KUWTK episodes, social media schedules, brand partnerships). She created a licensing system (fragrances, clothing lines, apps). She created a crisis management system (her ""fix it"" reputation is legendary).

The key insight: Hustle burns out. Systems scale.

What systems can you build? Maybe it's a content calendar. Maybe it's an email automation sequence. Maybe it's a morning routine that guarantees productivity. Stop relying on motivation. Build structures that work even when you don't feel like it.

Check out the podcast ""How I Built This"" with Guy Raz (Apple's top business podcast, millions of downloads). The episode with Sara Blakely (Spanx founder) breaks down exactly how she systemized her business from scratch. Insanely good insights on building scalable systems without outside funding.

## Step 4: Master Strategic Relationships

Kris didn't just manage her kids' careers. She built relationships with everyone who mattered: network executives, brand CEOs, media moguls, other celebrities. She understood that your network is your net worth.

But here's the part people miss: she also cut people off ruthlessly when they stopped serving the family's interests. She's not sentimental about business relationships. Strategic? Absolutely.

For you, this means being intentional about who you spend time with. Are your relationships lifting you up or draining you? Are you connecting with people who can open doors? Are you providing value to others so they want to help you?

Use the app ""Lunchclub"" for strategic networking. It uses AI to match you with relevant professionals for virtual coffee chats. I've landed three consulting gigs and met genuinely interesting people through it. Way better than random LinkedIn messages.

## Step 5: Diversify Income Streams Like Your Life Depends On It

Kris never relied on one revenue source. TV show money? Great. But also: product lines, endorsements, appearance fees, production deals, equity stakes in startups. At any given time, the family has 15 plus income streams running.

This is crucial for financial security in 2025. Your job isn't safe. The economy is unpredictable. You need multiple income sources.

Start small: freelance your skills on the side. Create a digital product. Invest in dividend stocks. Build a small online business. The goal isn't to replace your income immediately. It's to create optionality so you're not dependent on one employer or income source.

Read ""The Millionaire Fastlane"" by MJ DeMarco (sold over 250,000 copies, completely different from traditional finance advice). This book destroys the ""save for 40 years and retire"" mentality and shows you how to actually build wealth faster through multiple business systems. This is the best financial mindset book I've ever encountered.

BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app that pulls from high-quality sources like books, research papers, and expert interviews to create personalized audio content and adaptive learning plans. You can customize both the length (10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives) and the voice style to match your mood. 

The adaptive learning plan is particularly useful because it evolves based on your goals and what you're actually struggling with. You can tell the app exactly what you want to work on, whether that's business strategy, communication skills, or financial literacy, and it builds a structured plan that adjusts as you learn. It covers tons of the books mentioned in this thread and way more. Worth checking out if you're serious about continuous learning.

## Step 6: Ignore the Haters (Seriously)

The Kardashians are the most criticized family in media. ""No talent."" ""Famous for nothing."" ""Attention seekers."" Kris heard all of it. And she kept building. Because here's the truth: criticism means you're visible. Silence means you're irrelevant.

When you start putting yourself out there, building something, people will hate. They'll question your qualifications. They'll mock your ambitions. Let them. Their opinions don't pay your bills or build your dreams.

The only opinions that matter are your own and those of people who are where you want to be.

## Step 7: Adapt or Die

Twenty years ago, the strategy was reality TV. Ten years ago, it was Instagram. Now it's TikTok, podcasts, direct to consumer brands. Kris constantly evolves with media trends. She doesn't cling to what worked before.

Most people resist change. They get comfortable with one skill, one platform, one method. Then the world shifts and they're obsolete.

Stay adaptable. Learn new skills constantly. Experiment with new platforms. Don't marry yourself to one way of doing things. The most successful people aren't the most talented. They're the most adaptable.

Follow the YouTube channel ""Colin and Samir"" (750K subscribers, focus on creator economy trends). These guys break down exactly what's working in digital media right now and where attention is shifting. Best resource for staying ahead of trends.

Look, you don't have to like the Kardashians. But dismissing Kris Jenner as just ""lucky"" or ""shameless"" is missing the entire point. She built a system for turning attention into wealth, and that system is replicable for anyone willing to hustle smart, control their narrative, and play the long game.

The question isn't whether her methods are ethical or admirable. The question is: what strategies can you extract and apply to your own life?",1,1768347034.0,focusedmen,1,1.0,False

Now I’m dealing with the opposite. I returned to trying to eat normally a few weeks ago, and this week I really do feel like I should be heavier, but nope I lost weight again. It’s borderline worrying because I’m already thin as it is, people have pointed out that I’m very thin, my mum and partner are also worried.

A few days ago I had a pretty big meal for lunch. Like a chicken shnitzel loaded with cheese bacon and gravy as well as chips on the side. I had 2 bueno bars and a reese’s chocolate, then went and got a triple cheeseburger meal with a coffee frappe for dinner. I was sure that my weight would at least be up 500 grams the next morning but nope I lost a 100 grams. Yesterday I had a ham and salad sandwich. A pretty big greasy burger with triple cheese and 2 meat patties, then I had like 5 little jelly snacks and went to mcdonald’s and got a caramel sundae. I was sure that is enough to maintain my weight nope, was 900 grams lighter this morning.

This also doesn’t make sense because during my dieting towards the end I was having very low calorie days and the max I’d lose was 400 grams.

Something Crawled Out of the Water.,"The key to the cabin was still on the same ring my grandpa used to keep on his belt, except now it lived in a padded envelope with my name on it and a sticky note that said “Hope you can do something with the place.”

My aunt’s handwriting.

I almost didn’t come.

Not because I was scared of the woods or the lake. Because I was scared of the feelings. The kind that show up when you’re alone with someone else’s old life and you start finding the little dents where they stood.

But the cabin had been sitting for two years, and “sitting” is how places die.

So I took three days off work, loaded my truck with a tool bag, a case of bottled water, a cheap cooler, and the kind of optimism you only have when you haven’t arrived yet.

The driveway wasn’t a driveway anymore. It was two muddy ruts and grass tall enough to slap my door handles. I got out twice to move fallen branches. The third time I got out, I stopped and just stared.

The cabin was there, but it looked like it had been turned down to low brightness. Faded siding. Dark windows. The porch sagging slightly, like it was tired.

And behind it, the lake.

It was the reason my grandparents bought the place, and it still did the same thing it always did. It sat there looking calm while it swallowed every sound you made.

No motorboats. No kids. No one shouting from a dock. Just water and wind and the thin ticking of insects.

I killed the engine and listened. A loon called somewhere out on the lake, that long hollow sound that always makes your stomach go a little tight even when you’re not in a horror story.

I walked up to the porch and slid the key in.

The lock fought me for a second like it didn’t recognize me anymore, then gave.

Inside, the cabin smelled like cold wood, dust, and something faintly sweet that I couldn’t place at first. Then I realized it was old cedar. My grandma used to tuck cedar blocks into drawers like she was warding off time itself.

The living room was the same layout, even with the furniture covered in sheets. Couch on the left. Little lamp table. Wood stove in the corner with a rusted kettle on top. My grandpa’s fishing rods still leaned against the wall by the back door, their line limp and slack like veins.

I did what you do when you’re trying not to get hit by memory.

I got practical.

I opened windows to air it out. I checked for obvious water damage. I walked the floor, listening for soft spots. I found mouse droppings in the pantry and swore quietly, because of course.

There was no power. The old electric meter box outside had been pulled years ago, which my aunt had mentioned in her note like it was just a normal detail, like “oh yeah, by the way, the cabin is fully dead.”

Fine. I had lanterns. I had a headlamp. I had one of those battery packs you can jump a car with that also runs a USB.

I set up my little camp stove on the porch and boiled water for instant coffee, the kind my grandpa used to drink because “coffee doesn’t need to be fancy.”

While it brewed, I walked down to the shoreline.

The dock was in pieces. Not completely destroyed, but the far end had broken and dipped into the water at a permanent angle. The boards near shore were gray and rough, sun-bleached and split. A few old nails stuck up like teeth. The lake water lapped at it softly.

The water was dark. Not “murky,” just deep. You could see maybe a foot down near shore where the stones were, and then it went black like someone spilled ink.

I squatted and ran my fingers through the pebbles, more habit than anything. There were bottle caps and old hooks mixed in. A broken plastic bobber. Little relics.

Then I saw the first thing that didn’t fit.

On the wet sand just above the waterline, there were drag marks.

They weren’t footprints. More like two long parallel smears, as if something had pulled itself out of the water and then slid back in. The sand between the smears was pressed down, smooth.

I stared at it for longer than I should have. My brain ran through options. Log. Branch. Someone dragging a kayak.

Except there was no kayak, and the marks weren’t fresh-fresh. They were damp but starting to dry at the edges, like they’d been made earlier in the day.

I told myself it was a turtle. A big snapping turtle maybe. People always underestimate those. They’re basically prehistoric anger with legs.

I stood up, washed my hands in the lake, and went back up to the cabin.

Work makes you brave in a stupid way. It convinces you you’re in control because you’re measuring and cutting and moving things.

I spent the afternoon ripping up warped porch boards and replacing them with new ones I’d hauled in. I patched a corner of the screen on the porch where it had torn. I cleared leaves out of the gutter channel so rain had somewhere to go besides directly into the porch ceiling.

I found a coffee tin in the kitchen with my grandma’s handwriting on it. SUGAR. I opened it without thinking.

It wasn’t sugar anymore. It was clumped and yellow and smelled off.

I shut it and left it on the counter like I was leaving her a message: I saw it. I remember.

Around sunset, I ate a sandwich on the porch and watched the lake go flat. The surface turned into a mirror of bruised purple sky. The tree line on the opposite shore became one solid black shape.

That’s when the noises started.

The first one was faint. A wet slap, somewhere near the dock. The kind of sound you hear when a fish jumps, but heavier. More deliberate.

I leaned forward, elbows on knees, looking at the water.

Nothing broke the surface. No ripples, no circles spreading out.

A minute later, I heard it again.

Wet slap.

Then a dragging sound, like something rough being pulled over stones.

I sat up.

“Okay,” I muttered, to nobody, because talking out loud keeps you sane for one more minute.

I grabbed my headlamp off the porch table and shined it down toward the shoreline.

The beam caught the dock boards, the rocks, the reeds. Everything looked exactly the same, just brighter and more suspicious.

Nothing moved.

The air got colder fast, and the insects ramped up like a static layer in the background. I went inside, shut the door, and latched it.

I didn’t latch it because I thought something would open it. I latched it because my grandpa always latched it at night, and my hands did what his hands used to do.

I set up on the couch again because the bedroom smelled like closed drawers and old fabric. The couch smelled like dust and cedar, which I could handle.

Around 11:30, I was half asleep when the porch creaked.

One slow, heavy groan.

Not the normal “wood settling” creak. This was weight. The board giving slightly under something.

I sat up, heart kicking.

The porch creaked again.

Then I heard a soft tapping, right near the screen door.

Tap. Tap.

Not random. Not wind.

Like knuckles, if knuckles were wet.

I stared at the living room window, which looked out onto the porch. The glass reflected my own face back at me, pale in lantern light.

The tapping stopped.

I waited, frozen.

Then came a different sound. A scraping along the porch screen. Slow. Patient. Like someone dragging a nail across mesh.

My mouth went dry.

I turned the lantern down and clicked my headlamp on low, keeping the beam pointed at the floor. I moved to the living room window and leaned close enough that my breath fogged the glass.

I angled the headlamp up slightly.

The porch was empty.

The screen door was closed. The patched section I’d stapled earlier was still tight.

But on the porch boards, right in front of the screen door, there was something that wasn’t there earlier.

A wet streak.

Like a thick smear of lake water mixed with mud.

It glistened in my headlamp beam.

And it smelled through the glass. Faintly, but enough.

Fish. Wet stone. A sharp metallic edge underneath it.

The scraping started again, closer now, right on the screen door.

I stepped back so fast I bumped the chair.

The scraping stopped instantly, as if whatever was out there had heard the sound and decided it had confirmed something.

Then, from somewhere down near the dock, came another wet slap.

I didn’t sleep much after that. I lay on the couch, headlamp off, lantern turned low, listening to the cabin settle and the lake make its quiet noises. Every creak made my muscles tighten.

Sometime after 2 a.m., I heard something slide along the side of the cabin.

Not footsteps. Not paws.

A low, smooth drag, like a heavy bag being pulled slowly across wet leaves.

It stopped under the kitchen window.

I held my breath.

Then came a sound that made my stomach turn.

A soft clicking, fast and rhythmic. Like someone tapping their tongue against their teeth. Like a throat trying to make words and failing.

It went on for a few seconds, then stopped.

The silence afterward felt like pressure in my ears.

Morning came gray and cold. I made coffee and forced myself to step outside because I refused to be the guy scared of his own porch.

The wet streak was still there, dried slightly now, leaving a faint crusty outline.

And at the bottom of the porch steps, in the muddy patch near the foundation, were marks.

Not prints. Not claws.

Impressions like the edge of a shovel, pressed into mud in a repeating pattern. Parallel ridges. As if something had braced itself there.

I stood in the yard, coffee going cold in my hand, and tried to be normal.

“Turtle,” I said out loud, even though it didn’t sound convincing. “Big turtle.”

I worked anyway.

That day I replaced two broken window panes with plastic sheeting, stapled tight. I cleared vines off the side of the cabin. I found the old generator shed and opened it.

The generator was gone. Just an empty concrete pad and a few rust stains.

I found an old tackle box under the porch, the kind with trays. It was empty except for one thing: a folded, yellowed piece of paper.

A handwritten note from my grandpa. Not for me. Probably for my grandma.

“Don’t go down to the inlet at night. Don’t leave the fish on the porch. If you hear it clicking, come inside.”

That was it. No explanation. No signature. Just those lines, written like he didn’t want to waste ink.

My stomach went cold in a clean, simple way.

There was an inlet.

On the far side of the property, where the lake narrowed and fed into a little creek. The place I’d noticed was clogged with branches.

I stood there for a long time with that note in my hand.

My grandpa wasn’t the kind of man who wrote spooky warnings. He was the kind of man who fixed screens, sharpened hooks, and treated problems like they were solvable if you were stubborn enough.

So why had he written this?

That afternoon I drove into town and bought two more motion lights, extra batteries, and one of those heavy-duty door bars people use in hotels. The guy at the register asked if I was “up at the lake cabins.”

I nodded.

He said, “Watch the waterline. It’s been weird.”

He said it casually, like he was talking about algae.

“What does that mean?” I asked.

He shrugged. “People hear things. Something’s been dragging up fish. Probably just a big snapping turtle.”

He smiled when he said snapping turtle, like that was the punchline.

I didn’t smile back.

That night I set the motion lights facing the porch and the side yard, angled toward the shoreline. I barred the front door from the inside. I kept my headlamp around my neck and a hatchet within arm’s reach.

I know how that sounds. But I wasn’t sitting there like a hunter. I was sitting there like someone waiting for a noise you can’t unhear.

At 10:47, the porch motion light clicked on.

Bright white light flooded the porch, turning the screen door into a pale rectangle.

I sat up.

The porch looked empty.

The light stayed on for maybe fifteen seconds, then clicked off.

A minute later, it clicked on again.

Empty again.

Then the side yard motion light clicked on too, washing the grass and the base of the cabin in harsh light.

Still nothing visible.

It felt like something was testing the angles, moving just out of the sensor range, leaning in and out like a kid playing with a flashlight beam.

My throat tightened.

Then the porch light clicked on and stayed on.

I got up slow and moved to the living room window, keeping my body low and my headlamp off so I didn’t reflect myself.

The porch looked empty.

But the screen door mesh… it was bowed inward slightly.

Like something was pressed against it on the outside.

I leaned closer.

A shape moved in the glow, low to the boards.

Not a raccoon. Too big. Too smooth.

It slid forward, and for one clean second, it lifted its head into the light.

It looked like a lizard. That was my first thought, and I hate how simple that sounds, because nothing about it felt simple.

It was the size of a large dog, but built wrong for land. Heavy body, belly low. Skin dark and ridged in overlapping plates that shone wet under the motion light. Along its neck and down its spine were pale frills, translucent like thin rubber, fluttering slightly as if they were sensing vibrations more than wind.

Its head was broad and flat. Eyes small and set back, reflecting dullly. Mouth too wide, the corners pulled back farther than they should have been.

It stared through the screen door like it understood doors.

Then it clicked.

Fast and wet, a rapid series of sounds that made my teeth ache.

I stepped back involuntarily, and the floor creaked.

The creature’s head snapped toward the sound.

It moved closer to the screen door in one smooth surge, faster than its body looked like it should move.

The screen door bowed inward.

Then came a heavy thump as it hit the screen.

The latch held, but the entire frame rattled.

I backed up to the kitchen, grabbed my phone, and saw I had two bars of service.

I should’ve called 911 right then.

Instead, I did the stupidest thing I’ve ever done, because I had my grandpa’s note in my pocket like a challenge.

I grabbed the hatchet and my headlamp, unlocked the porch door behind the screen door, and told myself, out loud, “Just scare it off.”

The moment I cracked the inner door, the smell hit me.

Fish and wet stone, and that sharp metallic edge like blood on pennies.

The creature was no longer on the screen.

The porch was empty.

The motion light stayed on, illuminating nothing but the wet streaks on the boards.

I stepped onto the porch anyway, because my brain had already committed, and backing down felt worse than moving forward.

My headlamp beam swept down to the steps, then to the ground.

Nothing.

Then I heard it from below.

Not on the porch. Under it.

A sliding sound through damp leaves, low and close.

I turned my headlamp toward the shoreline and caught movement between the rocks.

It rose out of the shallows slowly, water sheeting off its back.

It had been waiting where the light couldn’t reach.

It launched.

It didn’t run. It exploded forward in a sudden burst of muscle and wet force, hitting the bottom porch steps and coming up fast.

I swung the hatchet. Not skillfully, not like I knew what I was doing. Pure reflex.

The blade glanced off a ridge on its shoulder with a hard, dull clack that sent shock through my arms.

It snapped at me.

Its jaws opened wider than they should have. The hinge flexed like rubber. Rows of small needle-like teeth sat farther back than I expected, like something built to grip and pull, not chew.

It clamped onto my left forearm.

Pain detonated. Hot and immediate. Like a vise with knives inside it.

I screamed and slammed the hatchet handle into its head, not the blade, just blunt impact.

It released with a wet pop and jerked back, clicking rapidly, agitated.

Blood ran down my wrist into my palm. My fingers tingled and went half-numb.

It lunged again.

I stumbled backward off the porch steps. My heel caught the edge. I fell hard into the dirt, shoulder first. The world spun. My headlamp beam went wild, slicing ferns and tree trunks and the side of the cabin.

The creature came down after me.

Low and fast.

Before I could get up, it raked across my ribs with those blunt nails, tearing through my shirt in parallel lines.

It wasn’t a deep cinematic slash. It was worse in a different way. Multiple shallow tears that burned instantly and started to bleed, like the skin had been peeled open.

I kicked. My boot connected with its jaw and it clicked louder, snapping.

Then it bit my boot and yanked.

My ankle rolled sideways in the dirt. A bright sick pain shot up my leg.

I made a sound that didn’t feel human.

The creature released my boot and lifted its head, tilting like it was deciding where to bite next.

In the headlamp glow, I could see its throat moving as it clicked, and I could see the frills along its neck fluttering as if they were tasting the air.

I grabbed a fistful of gravel and threw it at its eyes.

It flinched. Not much. But enough.

I crawled backward on my good leg, dragging the bad one, leaving a smear in the dirt. I hit the porch steps and hauled myself up, hands slipping on wet boards, wet from it and wet from me.

I got inside and slammed the inner door, then the screen door, then locked both with shaking hands.

The creature hit the screen door once, hard, rattling the frame.

Then it went still.

I stood in the kitchen, blood dripping onto the old linoleum, ribs on fire, arm throbbing, ankle screaming, and I waited for the next slam.

Instead, I heard the clicking again, slower now, almost thoughtful.

Then the porch motion light clicked off.

Darkness returned like someone turned the world back down.

I didn’t stay to see what it would do next.

I grabbed my keys, phone, and nothing else. I didn’t pack. I didn’t think. I limped out the front door, not the porch, and staggered toward my truck.

The yard felt huge. The lake felt closer than it should.

Behind me, I heard the wet sliding sound again.

Not rushing.

Following.

I made it to the truck, fumbled my keys, dropped them, found them, got the door open, and threw myself into the driver’s seat.

My ribs screamed when I twisted. My ankle screamed when I pressed the pedal.

I started the engine and the headlights washed the cabin in white.

The porch motion light clicked on again.

And there it was, halfway up the porch steps, crouched in the pool of light, watching my truck like it was memorizing the shape of it.

It didn’t charge. It didn’t panic.

It just watched.

I reversed hard enough to spray gravel, then drove until pavement showed up under my tires and the trees thinned.

That’s when I noticed the smell hadn’t stayed at the cabin.

It was in my truck.

Fish and wet stone, faint but real, coming off my clothes and the inside of the cab like I’d brought the shoreline with me.

At a stop sign under a streetlight, I looked down and saw a dark smear on the rubber floor mat by the pedals.

Not mud. Not just water.

Something thicker, with a slight sheen to it.

And embedded in it, like it had been pressed there when I stomped the brake, was a small, dark piece of something hard.

A scale.

That’s the only word I have for it. Oval, ridged, about the size of my thumbnail. Dark as bottle glass. It caught the streetlight and reflected it dully, like it didn’t want to be noticed.

I stared at it until someone honked behind me and I jerked forward, heart hammering all over again.

At urgent care, I told them I fell and got bitten by “an animal.” I let them make their own mental picture. I didn’t say lake. I didn’t say lizard. I said animal because I wanted stitches, not a lecture.

They cleaned the bite, stitched it, wrapped my ribs, and put my ankle in a boot.

When the nurse irrigated the bite, she paused and frowned.

“What is that?” she asked.

She leaned closer with forceps and pinched something out of the wound. It made my stomach flip.

She dropped it into a little metal tray.

It wasn’t gravel. Not exactly.

It looked like a tiny black sliver, hard and ridged, like a fragment of nail or scale. Wet. Dark. Wrong in the fluorescent light.

“Probably debris,” she said, but her voice didn’t sound convinced.

I didn’t answer.

A week later, I went back in daylight with two friends, a proper first aid kit, and a plan: board it up and get out.

The porch looked normal in sunlight. The cabin looked tired, not haunted.

But the porch boards had long, shallow grooves in them near the steps, like something with weight and ridged skin had gripped and pulled itself up repeatedly.

And on the kitchen table, where I’d left my tool bag, there was a dried wet streak. Fishy. Metallic.

Beside it, pressed faintly into the wood, were parallel ridge marks.

Like the edge of a shovel.

Like the impressions in the mud.

My friend joked, “Snapping turtle,” and laughed.

I didn’t laugh.

Because the drag marks on the shoreline were there again, fresh, leading from the water straight up toward the porch steps.

And the creek mouth on the far side of the property, the inlet my grandpa warned about, looked more clogged than before.

Like something had been pushing branches into place.

Like a door being shut.

And before we left, I checked my truck floor mat.

The smear by the pedals had dried into a dark crust.

*(And why a coffee roasting experience hits different)*

We have all been there.  
You need a gift. You scroll. You overthink. You end up buying something that’s… fine. It gets opened, smiled at, used a few times, and then quietly disappears into a drawer.

Now imagine gifting *a moment* instead.

That’s why experience-based gifts are having a serious moment right now. They don’t collect dust. And they usually turn into stories people actually want to tell.

# Experiences > Things (and science kinda agrees)

Experiences create memories, not clutter. **People tend to remember** how something *felt* way longer than what it *was*. A shared experience becomes part of someone’s story, and honestly, that’s way more meaningful than another object.

Plus, experiences are personal without being risky. You’re not guessing sizes, colors, or tastes. You’re saying:  
“I thought you’d enjoy *this moment*.”

# Why a Coffee Roasting Experience Is a Next-Level Gift

Even for people who “already love coffee,” roasting is a whole different world.

Here’s why it stands out:

* **It’s hands-on.** You’re not just watching, you are smelling, hearing the cracks, seeing beans transform.
* **It’s surprising.** Most people have no idea how much science, craft, and art go into roasting.
* **It slows time down.** In a world of rushing, roasting makes you pause, pay attention, and be present.
* **It’s social.** Great conversations naturally happen around warm coffee and shared curiosity.
* **You leave with something you made.** Freshly roasted coffee hits different when *you* roasted it.

It’s part learning, part sensory experience, part “WOW, I didn’t know coffee could taste like this.”

# Perfect for People Who Are Hard to Shop For

You know the ones:

* “I don’t need anything”
* “Just get me a gift card”
* “I already have everything”

An experience says, “Let’s do something memorable instead.”

A coffee roasting experience works for:

* Couples looking for something different
* Friends who love trying new things
* Coffee lovers who want to go deeper
* People who value moments over materials

# The Best Part? It Keeps Giving

Ingenico, a global leader in payment acceptance solutions, is officially integrating **WalletConnect Pay** to test whether stablecoins can function as a practical, scalable alternative to traditional credit card networks.

**Why this matters:**
Ingenico hardware is ubiquitous in retail. By bringing WalletConnect directly into the payment terminal ecosystem, they are bridging the gap between decentralized finance (DeFi) and physical storefronts. This isn't just a theoretical use case; it’s a direct attempt to see if blockchain-based payments can handle the speed and reliability required for daily shopping.

**The potential impact:**
* **Lower Merchant Fees:** By bypassing traditional banking rails and card networks, merchants could significantly reduce transaction costs.
* **Instant Settlement:** Unlike the 2-3 day waiting period for traditional card processing, stablecoin transactions on-chain offer near-instant settlement.
* **Streamlined UX:** For users, this means connecting a mobile wallet to a terminal to pay with USDC or USDT as easily as using Apple Pay or a physical card.

As stablecoins continue to find ""product-market fit"" in cross-border payments, this move into retail commerce represents the next major hurdle for mass adoption. If successful, we could see a future where your crypto wallet is just as valid at the grocery store as your Visa card.

Would you start paying for your daily coffee with stablecoins if the infrastructure was built into every terminal? Or are the rewards and protections of traditional credit cards still too good to pass up?

I didn't do my research and I just quit cold turkey from about 2-3 regular cappuccinos per day for 20 years. I figured it's just coffee, how bad can it be?  It's not like I'm getting off meth or crack.

I'm currently on day 4, my biggest problem is lack of sleep. 'The off switch' just isn't there. Needless to say, I feel like absolute crap during the day time and can't sleep at night time.

Does anyone know how long this might last? It's at the point where I'm considering getting back on the coffee just so I can go back to sleep! But if I'm already near the end of the hard part, I might as well just ride it out?",1,1768345820.0,decaf,3,1.0,False

I am using this one for my makeshift pincab/arcade setup. My second youngest Tank is demoted to my coffee table in case I want to play MAME on my Mac 

The MAX is the third Tankstick I own. The first was the basic 2-player model (without the trackball), the second was the upgrade with the trackball, and now the MAX.

I have decided to hand down my oldest Tankstick (sans trackball) to a good friend of mine who just got a working Neo-Geo system that he needs sticks and buttons for.

The first thing I am going to do is replace the old joysticks and, possibly, the buttons.

[I actually had a couple of these kits laying around from Thunderstick Studios](https://thunderstickstudio.com/products/grs-led-single-player-arcade-diy-kit?variant=43701902934245). So, I;m using these. They're heavy duty and everything TS has made for my son's arcade has been great and has taken a beating and still works.

It took me almost 90 minutes to get the bolts out to replace the first stick because I don't own a screwdriver with a bolt socket, but I managed to get it out with a pair of pliers.

I need to hit the hardware store to buy some new bolts and screws because, apparently, the holes in the stick base don't match the stock screws that came with the X-Arcade. That's gonna happen today.

My ultimate question is will the LED buttons work with this old X-Arcade? I'd assume it just needs power from the built in USB that's plugged into the stock encoder board. The kit DOES come with an encoder board that has a USB out -- but I don't have a hole to run the USB cord out of unless I drill a small hole in the back of the arcade, so I was just gonna try my luck with the stock encoder board.

Am I in over my head? I'd love some advice. I've modded arcade stuff before. When I built my son's arcade, I installed my son's TRON stick and spinner from TS Studios and wired it all myself and made sure it's all powered via a couple USB hubs plugged into the PC in the base of his pedestal, but I've never worked with X-Arcade's stuff and I've never actually tried to wire joysticks and buttons or know of any power issues. The kit doesn't need additional power and apparently, everything works when plugged into USB.",1,1768345808.0,fightsticks,0,1.0,False
1qc6kat,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qc6kat,Feedback to improve logo concept,"Hello! I am creating this logo for a traveling coffee shop and am looking for feedback. 

The owner of the business is my dad and he wants a brand logo that would go onto the side of a white Japanese mini truck. (It looks very similar to picture 4)

  
The business is called ""Mi+You Cafe"" (Pronounced ""Mee-yoo"") He chose this name to be a combination of Spanish and English with ""Mi"" translating to ""Me"" in Spanish and ""You"" meaning ""You"" in English because he is Mexican American.

  
My aim for this logo concept is to be exciting, friendly, and instantly recognizable. I also chose to add this coffee character because in all the logo sketches I showed him, he actually pointed to an unrelated doodle I made, which led me to creating a character for this brand. (For extra context, I will provide those sketches and doodles in pictures 2 & 3 and feel free to comment on those concepts as well).

  
Another thing I would like feedback on is the typography, as it is a modified font based on DIN Condensed Bold.

I’m looking for a co-founder who lives either in Vienna, Austria or Málaga/Marbella, Spain to build simple yet creative apps together. The idea is to launch multiple small projects, scale the ones that show traction, and potentially sell them over time.

Why I want a partner:

1.	⁠My coding skills are not super sharp yet. I can build things (especially with AI assistance), but I’d love someone stronger technically or at least comfortable with app dev so we can move faster.

2.	⁠Building with someone else gives me more responsibility, consistency, and motivation. Momentum matters a lot in this stage.

3.	⁠I value working with someone likable and chill who also cares about the quality of our collaboration. Not just a transaction, I want a good co-founder relationship.

I’m splitting time between these cities, so being able to meet in person matters to me, that’s why the geographic filter.

If you like building things fast, enjoy product + creativity, want to try multiple projects instead of betting all on one big startup and are down to co-own something from the start then DM me and we can grab a coffee/beer and talk!

No pressure, no corporate energy, just exploring whether we vibe and if it makes sense to build together.",0,1768345693.0,cofounderhunt,1,0.5,False
1qc6jpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1qc6jpt/sleepy_on_adderall/,Sleepy on adderall?,"Does anyone else get sleepy ON adderall? (Not AFTER the adderall wears off but **when the adderall kicks in** — about an hour after taking a pill.) What’s your experience talking to psychiatrists about this and finding the right words for it?

I (23y/o) mean “sleepy” like when it kicks in, I just want to rest my eyes & get a blanket & take a nap. Mentally, my inner thoughts (which are usually 24/7 racing — not anxiety, just racing, very neutral-good thoughts usually) quiet down into a sort of peaceful and slow sleepiness, and then I also feel a separate physical sleepiness too. And I’m not sleep deprived — I always get 8 hours a night and have a watch that shows I’m regularly getting enough deep sleep and REM and all that.

I’ve moved around a lot and every new psychiatrist always claims I must be mistaken and that they’ve “never heard or read about this before…” and they explain how adderall’s a stimulant. I know it’s a stimulant. However, adderall causes the same sleepiness I get from coffee, a couple of beers, or a glass of wine (without the intoxication part.) And I can’t find any solid peer-reviewed scientific literature on this topic — just TikTok/anecdotal pseudoscience mythmaking.

I always have to explain to psychiatrists that I understand & appreciate their skepticism but that my whole family is actually this way with caffeine. My parents would always drink black tea or something caffeinated right before bed to fall asleep. In my undergraduate years, I’d frequently take my adderall before bed in order to fall asleep more easily. And adderall IR always makes me feel sleepier than the adderall ER, but they both make me sleepy. Anyone else like this? And what research is there on this?

I work in neuroscience research (though not in any ADHD research which almost disqualifies any ethos — hate how much neuroscience pseudoscience there is out there) so will be happy to update this with any helpful information when I do find it. I don’t want to spread any misinformation. Personal theories are welcome but might not help much. Any help is greatly appreciated! Thank you.",2,1768345654.0,adhdwomen,4,1.0,False
