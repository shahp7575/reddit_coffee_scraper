Oh, okay‚Äîabout me? Well, I‚Äôm Gabriel, 29, from the Philippines. I‚Äôm 5'6"", chubby-built, and yes, I‚Äôm definitely the smaller spoon. *\[laughs\]*

I work in healthcare, under the wing of a statistician‚Äîso, not a frontliner exactly, but still right in the middle of it all. It can get hectic, but I like what I do.

I love running, and I‚Äôm planning to start going to the gym again soon. Not because I‚Äôm chasing a certain look‚ÄîI just want to feel stronger and healthier.

I‚Äôm big on cooking. If you love food, that works out perfectly, because I‚Äôll happily make you something from scratch. Cooking is kind of my love language.

I‚Äôm also a nature geek‚Äîput me in a forest or by the sea, and I light up. I get genuinely excited discovering animals or plants I‚Äôve never seen before. It‚Äôs one of the reasons I‚Äôd love to travel more.

Movies over series, always. Not a gamer, but I‚Äôm a bookworm, especially when I find a story that completely pulls me in.

I don‚Äôt really party much. I‚Äôm more of a homebody‚Äîsomeone who finds peace in keeping things tidy, cozy, and welcoming. I‚Äôm the kind of person who‚Äôll make you coffee, fluff your pillow, and ask about your day. That‚Äôs just how I show care.

I‚Äôm family-oriented. I really admire people who are close to their loved ones or who enjoy simple things, like taking a walk, just talking, being present.

So yeah, that‚Äôs me. Bisexual, open-minded, and just hoping to find someone real‚Äîsomeone I can share calm moments with, and maybe a few adventures too.",1,1748920113.0,gaydating,0,1.0,False

The world of literature and historical significance found itself centered on a single, remarkable location on June 2nd, 2025: the ancestral home of the legendary mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan Aiyangar FRS, located in Kumbakonam, Tamil Nadu, India. This unassuming dwelling, now an international monument, offered a poignant glimpse into the life and legacy of a mathematical genius, drawing attention to the power of self-education and the enduring impact of Ramanujan's groundbreaking work.

The narrative began with a casual encounter ‚Äì a coffee plan with parents that serendipitously led to the doorstep of mathematical history. Situated in a narrow lane off the bustling Sarangapani Sannidhi Street, the traditional house, often obscured by the sprawling branches of a large tree, stands as a testament to the humble origins of a man who redefined mathematical boundaries. Adjacent to a popular coffee spot, the home offers a stark contrast between the everyday and the extraordinary ‚Äì the mundane routines of modern life juxtaposed with the echoes of Ramanujan's formative years.

The house, a physical embodiment of his early life, has become a place of pilgrimage for those fascinated by his intellectual prowess and the struggles of a self-taught prodigy. Ramanujan, born on December 22, 1887, was a mathematical visionary who made monumental contributions to infinite series, number theory, and mathematical analysis, entirely self-taught. Despite lacking formal training, his innovative approach and unique insights revolutionized mathematics, leaving an indelible mark on the field. He moved through the world with a singular focus, pushing the boundaries of what was known and forging new pathways.

The conversion of the house into an international monument, a move that speaks volumes about its historical importance, occurred in 2003, initiated by the late President of India, Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam. This transformation underscored the global recognition of Ramanujan's achievements and ensured the preservation of his legacy for future generations. The monument serves not only as a tribute to his brilliance but also as an inspiration for aspiring mathematicians and researchers, reminding them that greatness can emerge from the most unlikely of settings. The article's invitation to ""join us for a tour"" implied accessibility, indicating a conscious effort to open up the space for public appreciation and discussion.

The essence of the news piece focused on the power of Ramanujan's memory and his achievements. The story highlights the humble surroundings of the house-turned-monument and invites readers to contemplate the journey of a man who defied convention. The emphasis on his self-taught nature further underscores his dedication and ingenuity. It's a tale of extraordinary achievement against seemingly insurmountable odds, suggesting that the location itself, within the context of his incredible legacy, is a symbol of resilience and an example of the powerful human spirit.

The juxtaposition of the ordinary and the exceptional ‚Äì the coffee shop and the monument, the busy street and the quiet house ‚Äì creates a vivid picture of the context in which Ramanujan‚Äôs genius blossomed. This narrative choice is purposeful, intended to convey a deeper message about the accessibility of brilliance. It‚Äôs a story about a man who grew up in a setting similar to many others but achieved greatness nonetheless.

The emphasis on the physical location of the home acts as a reminder of Ramanujan‚Äôs humanity. It serves as an emotional anchor for the profound intellectual contributions he made. By focusing on the house, the story humanizes Ramanujan. It invites the reader to not just contemplate his abstract achievements but also reflect on his context.

In essence, the news summary captures a multifaceted narrative: the quiet presence of the monument itself, the profound mathematical contributions of Ramanujan, and the global recognition of his genius. The fact that the story connects the memory of Ramanujan to his humble beginnings, and highlights the place that influenced his upbringing, reminds us of the importance of recognizing the remarkable within the ordinary. The story, focused on a single place, serves as a reminder that the greatest achievements often start from the most unassuming of places. The story celebrates his memory while opening the door to the appreciation of his contributions to mathematics. By describing the location and inviting readers for a virtual tour, it attempts to capture the essence of Ramanujan's life, his work, and his enduring impact on the world.

The drive through extended up from the road in front of the store before whining around the store to the window. The back of the drive through ran along a throughway/parking lot linking all the business in that block.  If the line up was extremely short, you could join, but most of the time the was at least 20 cars long. 

I‚Äôm waiting patiently when this car approaches the line from the parking lot at the rear. As he is getting close, I see him glance at me and my disability placard. He smirks at me and drives his car towards mine to force his way into the line. He inched towards my car, still smirking, expecting me to let him in. 

What, he didn‚Äôt know was that I have one hell of a temper and I HATE  bullies. I was already having one hell of a day and I wanted my coffee. I lost my shit. I turned my car towards his car, revved the engine and drove towards HIS car, stopping with a few inches to spare.  He called me a crazy fucking bitch and I revved my engine again. He said he just wanted to get in line and I told him he could wait like everyone else. He said he was in a hurry and. I gestured to the line and said we were all in a hurry. I told him there was no fucking way he was getting in front of me and to go fuck himself. He screamed more insults, so I put my car in park and was grabbing my titanium crutch to put a few dents in his car when my daughter finally stopped me. 

He thought he was going to get a quick ego boost by bullying a disabled woman but he picked the wrong person. In the end, he backed away and left, screeching his tires. What people don‚Äôt know about Canadians is the politeness is the expected norm so we get extremely angry when people are rude.

1l21azy,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1l21azy/professional_tips_for_better_pour_over/,Professional Tips for Better Pour Over,"I live in Brisbane Australia and at the weekend, Toby's Estate ran a coffee omakase event which I attended.

It was not only a chance to try a bunch of amazing coffees (including a Panama Geisha that tasted like gummy bears) but to question a professional to find out how to get closer to what they're producing.

After I tried the first coffee, I asked a simple question; ""How the fuck do you guys do this?!?!""

I explained that even when my brews are at their best, they still have a background generic coffee flavour which is quite overpowering and covers the flavour notes, which in his cup were super clear!

After going through my set up (V60, Cafe Abaca Filters & Timemore C3) and recipe (4:6 with 5 pours) he shared some wisdom.

1. Ratio - He said the first key is ratio and most grinders produce too many fines and therefore can't handle long ratios like a 1:16+. The first coffee we tasted was brewed at 1:14 and the Geisha at 1:12.5 and they were enough to convince me to try a tighter ratio at home.

2. He never brews hotter than 93¬∞C, even for light roasts. His home kettle has been on 90¬∞C for a year and he said for fruit and floral-forward results, this is absolutely key.

3. ""You're definitely grinding too fine"" - Obviously there's no 'right way' but after hearing my brew times are 3:00-3:10 he said a time of 2:15-2:45 is what he uses to bring out fruitiness. There's still a TON of sweetness because of the tighter ratio but the bitterness that masks acidity is kept at bay 

4. Water - This is a rabbit hole I've explored in the past few months. He confirmed that you can't get the results they get in the cafe with tap or even standard filtered water. As long as it's soft enough (100PPM or less) and consistent then you should be able to dial in your brews.

5. Pours - All of the above combine to REQUIRE 5 pours for adequate agitation and therefore extraction in his view.

So, I went home with some beans from the shop (Indonesian Anaerobic Natural), set my kettle to 90¬∞C, went from 18 to 22 clicks on the C3 and dosed 18g of coffee to 270g water. I used my standard recipe and I actually can't believe how much better the result was. All fruit and sweets, zero harshness and no ""generic coffee"" taste that I've been getting. My only gripe is that it got a little hollow as it cooled so slightly more agitation is needed for a better extraction next time.

TLDR: I changed ratio from 1:17 to 1:15, ground courser to reduce brew time from 3:10 to 2:45 and used 90¬∞C water instead of 95¬∞C and coffee went from good to GREAT! The ratio change is the most transformative as it makes so much sense now that I think about what I want in a pour over.",2,1748919542.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

I didn‚Äôt know it then, but you were bending over backwards too, in a much different way. You lied, again, and again and again to frame yourself in what you thought was the best possible light.

A hundred more lies later, I no longer saw you as an angel. You continued to take every opportunity to make me think I was crazy. So many absurd coincidences would seem to happen. I stopped believe in them, and then I stopped believe in you.

And so here I am, locked inside my room everyday after work, dreading every encounter with you. I initially thought we could function as roommates, because I need space. I bought you a mattress for your room, but instead you slept on the cold hard floor next to it with a bottle of rum‚Ä¶ When will this end?

In college I was surrounded by so much community. I was on a floor on campus where we would eat lunch and dinner together, have weekly game nights, watch a tv show every Wednesday together, go to a restaurant every Saturday, have craft nights, etc. Many times I would do homework in our lobby with the company of at least one other floormate. 

In addition to that, I am also a part of a service fraturnity where I served an exec role. This meant a weekly chapter and exec meeting in addition to at least one fun event a week, probably a service project every other week, and so many brothers that I would run into on campus. 

During the week, sometimes I would go to a local coffee shop with a friend to work on homework. I would also sometimes meet up with study groups from my classes.

This is part 3 of an ongoing story, so If you're not caught up with what I've been going through, please read,¬†[""I Never Expected To See That Camera Again.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1kvzu1r/i_never_expected_to_see_that_camera_again/)¬†and¬†[""Blue Eyes (INETSTCA Part 2)""](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1kxayyh/blue_eyes_inetstca_part_2/)

It had to be a coincidence. Just because someone has blue eyes doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean anything. I can think of 3 other people in this town with blue eyes right now. Hell, even my dad had blue eyes, at least from what I could remember about him.

The more I read those journals, the more memories returned. My mind was like an old wooden chest and someone had just blown off the dust and cracked it open. Part of me felt like I had been drifting on auto-pilot for the last 17 years of my life.

School. Home. Friends.

Move out. More School. Less Friends.

Work. Home. Even Less Friends.

More Work. Less Home. No Friends.

I wasn‚Äôt the only one, of course. I think it‚Äôs pretty normal to find yourself in a routine. One look online and you‚Äôd see a lot of people I grew up with that were the same way. Everyone drifts apart eventually. As trivial as it might be to boil it all down to ‚Äújust growing up‚Äù, it really is just that sometimes. Life becomes less magical as the years pass. Theme Parks turn into long lines. Road Trips turn into long drives. And nights turn into darkness.

Part of you might be wondering why I didn‚Äôt mention Sarah‚Äôs return sooner. To be completely honest, it‚Äôs because it never felt like she did actually return ‚Äì at least not the Sarah I knew. She became cold and distant. I always just chalked it up to the fact that I had abandoned her that night. If I was in her position, I don‚Äôt know if I could have forgiven me either. The police called off their searches and considered this an open and shut case. A little girl snuck out of her parents‚Äô house and stayed with some friends for the weekend. It was easier to let them believe their version of events. No one wanted to hear about mysterious houses and blue-eyed strangers from an eleven-year-old who shouldn't have been in those woods in the first place.

The day Sarah first appeared in Mr. Walker‚Äôs class again was the last day she talked to me. I can remember it vividly now. I leaned over in my chair and whispered to her, ‚ÄúHey, where have you been? Are you okay?‚Äù I should have just started with something more along the lines of ‚ÄòI‚Äôm sorry for abandoning you in a mysterious house‚Äô, but I was too taken aback by her sudden apparition.

‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm fine. Thanks for asking.‚Äù She replied soullessly. Goddamn it, I could tell she was pissed.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre fine? Sarah, I haven‚Äôt seen you since that night at the-‚Äù I pleaded, but was interrupted by Mr. Walker‚Äôs booming voice entering the room.

‚ÄúOkay class! Today we‚Äôll be going over metamorphosis in caterpillars.‚Äù The class groaned. ‚ÄúAnd I know, I know. The word ‚Äúmetamorphosis‚Äù made about 70% of you immediately check out and start thinking about video games or cute boys and what not, but I promise it‚Äôs really interesting!‚Äù

Every detail came rushing back to me, right down to that fucking lesson in metamorphosis. Mr. Walker would never shut up about something called ‚Äúimaginal cells‚Äù. Sarah never acknowledged me after that, aside from the odd ‚ÄúHey‚Äù or ‚ÄúOh, hi‚Äù when I would engage her first.

I began to remember how stupid I was back then, convincing myself of every possibility beyond taking personal responsibility.¬†*She must be jealous of Victoria*, I used to think.¬†*Or maybe it‚Äôs the movies we make. My ideas were always clearly better and she must have hated me for that.*¬†What the hell was wrong with me?

After shaking off the previous entry, I continued to read through my journals into the early morning. The entries before the day Sarah disappeared weren‚Äôt very helpful. They essentially covered everything I had already come to remember from watching our recordings. I made it all the way up to that day she mysteriously came back. I could tell from my handwriting that I was overwhelmed and frantic ‚Äì writing about how immature and unfair she was being. I turned the page and was met with the jagged edges of paper where my final entry had previously been.

Someone had ripped it out.

I could hear my mom coming down the stairs around 7 am. I didn‚Äôt want her to see that I had been up all night obsessively reading through my memories. I jammed the journals underneath the couch and pushed the side of my head against the pillow, pretending to be fast asleep. After a brief breakfast of french toast and coffee with her and Lily-Ann, I told them I wanted to take a look around town for nostalgia‚Äôs sake. I could tell my mother was disappointed by this, most likely hoping we‚Äôd spend the entire day together. I promised her that I would be back in time for us to get lunch at our favorite diner, Gem‚Äôs.

‚Äú12 o‚Äôclock and no later okay?‚Äù The way she said it sent me back 20 years. I felt like a little kid again.

‚ÄúNo problem, mom. I‚Äôll be there.‚Äù I snatched my coat off of the hook behind the door, and made my way outside. I checked the time on my phone and it was 10 am. Plenty of time for me to investigate the old house and return in time for lunch.

It had been a while but, if I remembered correctly, the abandoned house was somewhere rather deep in the woods behind my mom‚Äôs home. I chose to walk about a block up the street before cutting across a small grass field. Immediately walking into the woods behind my old house probably would‚Äôve raised some flags for my mom and Lily-Ann.

Sometimes I forget how much bigger the world seemed when I was 10 years old. The walk to that old house was much shorter than I anticipated. The treeline was rather thick, but without the fog of youth I could tell it was only a stone‚Äôs throw away from the road.

As I approached the brooding exterior of the house, something inside of me stirred. Literally. It felt as though the bones underneath my skin shifted an inch to the right clockwise, pulling my flesh along with it. I let out a small grunt before catching myself from being too loud. I still don‚Äôt know if anyone, or anything, was in that house. I looked down at my hands when the sensation ceased, expecting to see a mangled version of my limbs but I appeared totally fine.

I‚Äôve had severe anxiety attacks before, especially when I was a lot younger, but nothing to this degree. I brushed it off the best I could with a deep breath and stepped toward the front door.

After at least 2 decades abandoned, I half expected this place to be in complete ruin. Yet, the exterior held up quite well over the years. The ivy grew strong, at least twice as tall as it was when I was a kid. The wood, while weathered, still held its integrity. It was better than my expectations‚Ä¶ but it still looked like absolute shit.

That is, until I stepped inside.

The old hinges protested as the front door slowly opened before me. That was when I saw it.

The most beautiful home decor that I had ever seen in my life.

It was astounding. Polished marble flooring with pristine white walls that rose around me, untouched by time. Gold and black accents scattered across the rooms in the form of lamps, end tables, pottery and statues. Where previously there had been dust covered chairs draped in foreboding white sheets, there was now beautiful leather couches and love seats. They all faced the fireplace, adorned with carvings that seemed too intricate for human hands.

Even with the windows boarded up, the sunlight cascaded through cracks bouncing off of the impeccably clean floors, blooming light through the entire house.

The light found its way up the staircase. While the stairs and railings themselves were elegantly designed, the upstairs remained dark and decrepit, as though the house was mid-way through renovations. Tucked beneath the staircase, I noticed a door sitting slightly ajar. It had to be some sort of storage closet or basement entrance. Even in the dim light, I could make out a carving on the white door's surface‚Äîa gold cicada with its wings and legs spread in every direction.

The kitchen remained the darkest part of the house. I stepped closer and peered into its entrance. Even though it was the middle of the day and I was almost 30 years old, something about the thought of that ‚Äòwindow‚Äô made a knot of dread form in my stomach. I didn‚Äôt think I would be able to handle it if I saw those blue eyes staring back at me when I turned the corner.

But sure enough‚Ä¶

I braced myself as I entered the only half-renovated kitchen. I kept my gaze toward the fridge and counter top, building up the courage to face it. I turned, and two bright pools of blue stared back at me. I froze. Every nerve ending in my body twisted and screamed for me to run. My fists tightened out of instinct, ready to defend myself from whatever was looking directly through me. The figure stayed completely still. Too still.

After a few seconds had passed I felt the breath in my lungs return. I was about to run for the exit when I noticed the figure still hadn‚Äôt moved, nor did its gaze. It was looking at me the same way the Mona Lisa would, as if its always staring ‚Äútoward‚Äù you but not quite ‚Äúat‚Äù you. I built up the courage to step closer and as I did my eyes adjusted to the darkness.

It¬†*was*¬†a painting. But how was that possible? I know what I saw in that recording and I know what Sarah said that night. I reached forward and sure enough, my hand touched glass. It was like one of those paintings you‚Äôd see in a cheap motel or a museum, covered by a pane of glass so the guests couldn‚Äôt destroy it.¬†*Was it just an optical illusion from the light reflecting off of it?*¬†I thought to myself.

As I studied the room further, something struck me‚Äîthe wall holding the painting was interior, with no outside access at all.

That was when the floorboards above me creaked. The upstairs remained a horrifying mystery in my mind. I felt compelled to go up.

As I walked upstairs, the smell that I had remembered all those years ago swept its way into my nose, but it was far worse now. The stench of molded wood began to burn my nostrils. Essence of rot and decay overtook my senses. I instinctively brought my hand to my face, covering as many openings as I could. The second floor was coated in a thick layer of dust and debris. A far cry from what it looked like downstairs. A creak from down the hall echoed toward me.

It was in this moment that I realized I hadn‚Äôt brought a weapon with me. I had walked straight into the lion‚Äôs den without a whip or a chair. I searched my pockets for anything that could be used as self defense. I felt the outline of my keys and fished them out. I remembered an old technique my mom taught me in case something ever happened to me after school. I quickly spread out the keys and placed each one between my fingers. Gripping the key chain, my hand now resembled that of Freddy Krueger or Wolverine.

With a new found confidence in my ability to fight back, I moved down the hall. A steady tapping sound began to emerge.

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

A door on the right side of the hallway stood ajar. A light shined through the crack, creating a vortex of glistening dust that swirled with each step I took. The tapping grew closer.

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I tightened my grip on the keys. Reaching my unequipped hand out, I pushed the door gently. More light bled into the hallway as suddenly, a shadow crept over me. Something blocking the window created a haunting silhouette against the glaring sunlight.

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

It swayed back and forth as my eyes adjusted to the brightness. Finally I could make out what was causing the tapping sound. Blood. Blood dripped onto the floor steadily beneath the rocking figure.

It was an orange tabby, torn open viciously from neck to groin. Its eyes frozen in shock with it‚Äôs limbs laying dormant. My body couldn‚Äôt decide if I was more saddened or disgusted. Immediately rejecting the sight, I lurched against the door frame, throwing up the contents of my stomach. French Toast. The sickeningly sweet nature of my vomit felt like an ironic kick while I was already down.

I composed myself and looked back up at the disgusting omen. That was when I saw it. Something was protruding out of it‚Äôs mouth. Another memory card ‚Äì the same sized memory card that fit inside of my old camera.

It was meant for me. I just knew it.

The floorboards creaked loudly as I stepped toward it. I felt the cat‚Äôs jaw slightly unhinge as I pulled the memory card from it‚Äôs mouth. The sight and awful squelching sound of it made me retch.

‚ÄúWhat kind of sick fuck would do this?‚Äù I whispered to myself.

A voice replied from the doorway.

‚ÄúExactly what I was wondering‚Ä¶‚Äù a stern deep voice boomed.

I looked to my left and was greeted with the barrel of a 9mm pistol pointed directly at me. A golden badge shined against the incoming streaks of light. A burly black man stood glaring at me through a pair of dark Oakley knock-offs. His dark blue uniform fitted tightly against his rotund body, creating stress marks on the shoulders and above his belt.

‚ÄúPut your hands on your head immediately and get on the ground!‚Äù The tension in his voice grew.

I shoved the memory card into my pocket and did as he told. I didn‚Äôt know what to say but all I could blurt out was, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt do this. I promise.‚Äù

There was a moment of silence before it was broken by the cop‚Äôs voice again. ‚ÄúKasey? Is that you?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt know for a second if I should have been more scared or relieved.

I heard the sound of a click and braced myself for the impact of a bullet. I had just hoped it was in the head so it would be immediate. Instead, nothing happened. I looked over and saw the sound had come from the officer‚Äôs holster. He had placed the gun back on his belt.

‚ÄúHoly shit, Kasey, it‚Äôs me! Darnell!‚Äù His voice was now a pitch higher and more excitable.

It took a moment to recall, but that was when it hit me. Darnell was one of my classmates from E. Bird Elementary. In fact, he sat right in front of me in Mr. Walker‚Äôs classroom and was one of the only other people who gave me the time of day. We used to commiserate about how cruel everyone else could be in school.

‚ÄúDarnell? Oh my god, I haven‚Äôt seen you in almost‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚Äú17 years!‚Äù He interrupted, walking towards me with arms open. I embraced him and he continued, ‚ÄúOh man, I can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre actually back. This is amazing.‚Äù

We giggled awkwardly as the hug ended, unsure of what to say as both of our gazes returned to the unfortunate feline.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck happened here, Kasey? I got reports of a random person going through backyards and followed your trail here‚Ä¶‚Äù He shot me an accusing and concerned eye, ‚ÄúPlease tell me you didn‚Äôt do this.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo! I swear, I just showed up about 30 minutes ago and the cat was already like this.‚Äù I sounded frantic, but I knew it was the truth. Mentioning the time made me remember the promise I had made to my mom. I pulled out my phone to check the time. 11:55 am.¬†*Fuck. The Diner.*

Darnell stared at me for a moment. His thick black glasses made it near impossible to read his emotions. He let out a brief sigh before reaching for his radio‚Äôs microphone and cupping it in his hands, ‚ÄúUnit 23 to dispatch, I investigated the complaint at the old Whitaker house. It was just some kids messing around. I sent them home with a warning. No further action required.‚Äù

The mention of the name Whitaker stopped me‚Ä¶ that was¬†*my*¬†last name.

A calm woman‚Äôs voice came through the receiver, ‚Äú10-4, Unit 23. You‚Äôre clear and available.‚Äù

Darnell looked back up at me with a smile of relief, ‚ÄúThe kids around here have been really escalating their stupid pranks lately. I honestly didn‚Äôt think they‚Äôd go this far.‚Äù He gestured toward the tabby. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry you had to see this. Especially at your dad‚Äôs old place.‚Äù

I was still in shock, ‚ÄúMy.. dad?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, you know. The place your dad grew up with all the other kids?‚Äù He said every word as if he was waiting for me to jump in, but I had no idea what he was talking about. I think he saw the look on my face, his facade shifted.

‚ÄúSorry Kasey, maybe your family never told you. That‚Äôs not my business. Forget I said anything.. Do you need a ride back home to your mom‚Äôs? I‚Äôll have someone come out and clean this up later.‚Äù

I hated the idea of ending the conversation here, but two things stopped me. One, I need to get to the diner as quickly as possible before I felt the wrath of my mother. And two, he had a gun.

‚ÄúThe Gem Diner‚Ä¶ please.‚Äù I muttered.

We both hopped into his cruiser and within moments had pulled up to the diner. I finally got to experience the perks of using police sirens in traffic.

I stepped out of the vehicle in front of Gem‚Äôs, expressing my thanks to Darnell as he shouted from the driver‚Äôs seat, ‚ÄúJust stay out of trouble Kasey, you hear?‚Äù

I looked back at him to wave goodbye as he lowered his sunglasses.

His eyes met mine.

His beautiful, lightning blue eyes, met mine. I froze.

He lifted his glasses with a smile and drove away.",1,1748919300.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

How is my brew? This is my fifth brewing. I used Arabica 100% medium-dark roast. 16 g of the coffee with this Bialetti 3 cup express. Using Comandante c40 at 20 clicks. Fill until the funnel is full with some stir and tapping but no tamp. 95c pre-heat water in the boiler. Use medium heat (2 from 3 level), no stove preheating. And also use filter.

The coffee aroma and taste is ok but I feel the bitterness still lingering on my tongue after each sip. 

How to tune more to solve this bitterness?

Thinking about using 19 click and try to control the heat to the pot. Still want to use the same coffee to know how much I can tune the taste.",2,1748919267.0,mokapot,1,1.0,False

My partner and I are going on a Princess Cruise soon and we have the **Premier Beverage Package**. We‚Äôre planning to use the **OceanNow** app and want to understand exactly what we‚Äôll need to pay for.

We know that the **$14.99 OceanNow activation fee is waived** with the Premier Package, but we‚Äôre still a little unclear on a few things:

* What **food** options are included when ordering via OceanNow? Can we order from the main dining room, casual eateries, or specialty restaurants without extra charges?
* Are there any **additional service charges or gratuities** that apply to food or drink orders even with the Premier Package?
* With the Premier Package, can we get **alcoholic drinks, specialty coffees, bottled water, etc.** through OceanNow without paying extra?
* Are there any **exceptions or common surprise charges** we should look out for?

We‚Äôd love to hear from anyone who‚Äôs cruised recently with the Premier Package and used OceanNow frequently. Just trying to avoid any unexpected charges and get the most value out of what‚Äôs included.

Thanks so much!",4,1748919246.0,PrincessCruises,2,1.0,False
1l215f6,https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepApnea/comments/1l215f6/remedies_for_while_i_wait_for_final_diagnosis/,Remedies for while I wait for final diagnosis,"My doctor told me recently he very much believes I have sleep apnea since I have such a classic case of waking up at night, brain fog, tiredness, snoring and obesity. I called to set up for a sleep study, but the earliest date I could find is for next year. Now, my insurance won‚Äôt pay for any machine or treatment without a study first, and I really need to get this treatment going, as tiredness and brain fog are becoming ever increasing and harder to deal with. I can‚Äôt use the mouth tape since sometimes my nose clogs up because of allergies or sinusitis, so is there anything I could use in the meantime to at least alleviate the symptoms?

My full story here:

I was mildly overweight (15-20 lbs) when I had an injury while exercising to shed those pounds. This along with long work hours led to me putting on a ton of weight over the years (like 50 lbs more). I believe back then I started to have apnea since my anxiety started becoming ever more present and my energy to do things I loved took a nosedive, to the point I couldn‚Äôt even watch a series. During this time I curbed the tiredness with coffee. In comes 2023 and my body started reacting strongly to coffee and causing me anxiety. My GP recommended to leave coffee behind. This exacerbated my sleep problem. I couldn‚Äôt get past the tiredness in the morning and I‚Äôm basically a zombie in the afternoon when I get home from work. I tried losing weight, but it was so difficult mustering energy when I had none and after going to a nutrionist and following every recommendation to a t I only dropped five pounds then stopped altogether. When my pulmonologist told me it could be apnea a lot of things clicked. I thought my tiredness and lack of energy to even visit family was due to age, but he told me I‚Äôm too young for that. I was happy since a solution seemed close. But now the solution is so far away and I really want to turn my life around, be healthier, have energy and do things I love.",3,1748919041.0,SleepApnea,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm relatively new to at home espresso. Been a daily brew from home drinker for many years using various methods. I bought these three machines within 3 months of each other last year, the grinder and kettle first than the espresso machine. I only use recently roasted beans for espresso and always weigh my portions. 

At first everything worked amazingly, exactly as specifications listed said they would. What I mean by that is the grinder settings 0-2 worked great for espresso and produced the correct grind. For the bambino everything seems in order. I always use filtered water or bottled water. I have not used the descaler package that came with the box but have considered it as a potential solution to try. 

The problem: recently I have not been able to pull a good shot out of the bambino. 

I have tried cleaning the grinder, different grind settings, it seems like anything below 4 won‚Äôt even push water through the puck anymore. 

I‚Äôm starting to wonder if I need to just ignore entirely the grind settings and pay attention to what‚Äôs actually coming out of the machine but then how will I ever keep consistency? 

I was very happy with the results when I first started using these two machines together but now idk what is off, the grind, the bambino pressure, I am not sure. I think the grind settings that I used to use now pulverize the beans into more like flour than grinds. Thinking that‚Äôs part of the issue. Do I need to brush out the grinder with an actual paint brush? 

Any advice or help is appreciated, I might just need to buy a new bag of coffee and play for awhile but im tired of wasting 20 gms to find out I did it wrong again. ",1,1748918932.0,espresso,1,1.0,False
1l213jp,https://v.redd.it/kwa1w1lqlm4f1,How to reduce the bitterness,"
How is my brew? I used Arabica 100% medium-dark roast. 16 g of the coffee with this Bialetti 3 cup express. Using Comandante c40 at 20 clicks. Fill until the funnel is full to the rim with some stir and tapping but no tamp. 95c pre-heat water in the boiler. Use medium heat (2 from 3 level), no stove preheating. And also use filter.

The coffee aroma and taste is ok but I feel the bitterness still lingering on my tongue after each sip. 

How to tune more to solve this bitterness?

Thinking about using 19 click and try to control the heat to the pot. Still want to use the same coffee to know how much I can tune the taste.",3,1748918888.0,mokapot,0,1.0,False

I use medium / medium-light beans and value clarity, sweetness and acidity over texture and body.  I‚Äôm looking at the Breville Bambino for the brewer because of its size, value and the fact that I‚Äôm currently not interested in modding my equipment.  I‚Äôm willing to use a manual grinder if it gives me SIGNIFICANTLY better tasting espresso for the same price as an electric grinder, but otherwise prefer electric.  Although I am considering the DF54, I could be talked into the DF64 or any other grinder.  As far how much I am willing to spend, I have a $400 budget, but it‚Äôs more about reaching a point of maximum value where spending more would start to have diminishing returns.  I don‚Äôt care about bells and whistles.  I care about the final product.  Thanks in advance for your thoughts",1,1748918803.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

coffee in the morning
1 smoothie shortly after with 
greek yogurt
coconut milk
two tablespoons of hemp and flax
1 tablespoon of oats
Assorted berries
Sometimes peanut butter and banana 

I only drink water throughout the day and have another smoothie when i get off work. 8:30-9:30

I intend to add two salads by week two, adding nuts, assorted vegetables, evoo or avocado oil, red wine or balsamic vinegar. Keep smoothie in morning, salad lunch, smoothie mid day, salad dinner. 

Im not sure what would be a healthy progression going into the following weeks and am curious if you guys have any thoughts/advice about moving this diet forward. I intend to do a 6-8 week diet. I am aware i am low on my protein right now, but i wanted to treat it like a cleanse for week 1. I was a heavy drinker and a chef that is looking to be more mindful of what he ingests on the day to day and gain some ground level discipline. I would also like to apply a slight workout/routine once i get some protein in the mix so any and all advice best for losing a few pounds and finding some balance would be much appreciated.

Wondering if there is a dating app for more mature gay guys for those looking for men in the same age range? An older guy NOT looking for a twink? What the what?

I (48) am a recent widower and am interested in the idea of getting to know people. Grinder, sniffies(whatever that is) and the other apps out there are not what I believe would be a good way to find what I am looking for.  Yes, there are google results, but looking for real world non-algorithm opinions.

I am sure I can find sex easily. It‚Äôs intimacy that I am looking for. A nice chat over coffee, legitimate connection kind of thing.

See on the map a level 30 and 31, travel to them and they're sneaking around with trash weapons and having trouble with regular enemies, obviously new.  Give them a few serums, meds, coffee, candy, water.

Found one guy using a bow, crafted him a bunch of bows with various arrow types to get him to level 50, I had a few pre-made sitting in my stash.

Found another person around level 70, gave them 1 of each of my plans, any regular fasnacht mask they didn't have.

Now, I'm about to log off but decide to once again visit the pair I saw originally.  I decide to give them each every regular fasnacht mask and some other stuff like meds and water.  This time, they know what's up.  They know if I show up waving, I'm going to drop a bag and then run away thumbs upping and waving.  So, I start dropping.  Meds and stuff, then masks masks masks...  Whelp, I didn't favorite my veggie man mask I just put on earlier, down it goes.  I panic, step back and look for the bag.  As soon as it appears, one of them runs up and starts grabbing individually.  I snatched up the whole bag but it's too late, glowing veggie man is not in the lot.  One of very few glowing masks I have, gone.  I message him, xbox, that I didn't mean to drop the glowing mask.  No reply.  I continue dropping the other masks either way, unhappy AF.  Will I get it back?  Fuck if I know.  I do, man drops everything I just gave him.  Whether he just didn't know that it's a struggle to get those masks or he was appreciative of what I'd done so far, I got back my mask.

I favorited and decided I'd played enough.

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the US (EST time zone, and with a rather sporadic schedule). My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, life is far more intricate than this. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are emphatically established and developed over time for a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**Also, no hesitations or doubts, please.** If you're at all interested then take the chance. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** My ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. I seek people who generally know themselves and what they desire and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost. The type of connection I want also understands, accepts, and embraces the reality that there's more than deliberate engagement and a handful of interests that make someone up, from mundane chatter to intense distress - it strives to embrace these more grueling aspects of existence in a considerate way, while not being totally lost to them.
* **Being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** I want people with a vibrant imagination that are high in cognitive sensations in which such interaction, of various sorts, creates an elated state of splendor. I peak with ideation and abstraction, and seek out others who do as well.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics, which is inscribed onto one of the plaques I've placed above my abode in the Epistemic Wilderness. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and have actively sought out the most peculiar and obscure bits of knowledge possible since I was young. I seek peers in this and related endeavors.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, in which I primarily write about my observations and thoughts. I also adore writing conversationally, and am not uncommonly poetic and intense when doing so. Photography is also something I dabble in, although not as much as I'd like. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, and coffee.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelg√§ngers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with. A person who understands that no one will ever be your clone and dares to take exuberant advantage of that fact seems required for the deepest sorts of bonds.** ¬†I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably detailed chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention; anything dazzling will also do. I look forward to us chatting and connecting around meaningful and fervid passions.",1,1748918335.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

I stretched my back, my quills shaking as I let out a yawn.  While we‚Äôd become more used to Human days, trying to keep up with the primates stamina was exhausting.  *Almost done for the day*, I thought, turning back to the table before me. Myself and a few others were in the town built for training, practicing bomb making for our field exercise.  The building we were sheltered in had been made to resemble a warehouse, and we were in a partitioned area towards the center.

 I picked up a metal pipe, a cap  and a soldering pen, and carefully secured the cap to the end of the pipe.  Setting down the pen, I reached over to the graduated cylinder across from me, and began to pour the white powder inside into the pipe.

‚ÄúCareful there,‚Äù [~~Yotul-1~~] Rels said from across the room.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very impact sensitive; please don‚Äôt set it off.  It took a lot of work.‚Äù  I paused, and set down the container.  ‚ÄúRels, what do you mean very impact sensitive?‚Äù I asked, my growing exhaustion putting a sharp tone to my voice.
‚ÄúI mean if you drop it, then poof,‚Äù Rels said, pantomiming an explosion with his paws.  He cocked his head, examining me.  ‚ÄúWhat did you think I meant?‚Äù

I heard a resigned sign behind me, and turned to see [~~Krakotl-1~~] Jarla rubbing her beak at her station.  ‚ÄúRels,‚Äù she asked, seemingly annoyed.  ‚ÄúYou do realize this is supposed to be non-lethal flash powder, right?  As in, not supposed to kill anyone, right?‚Äù
‚ÄúOh course I know that,‚Äù Rels huffed back.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still non-lethal; I don‚Äôt plan on killing any of you.‚Äù  He paused.  ‚ÄúUnless a certain someone keeps stealing my mangos.‚Äù  He fixed Jarla with an accusing stare for a moment.

He hopped down and wandered over, leaning over my bench.  ‚ÄúOne of the issues I noticed with the last batch was that there was a slight delay in detonation,‚Äù he said, picking up a detonator we‚Äôd assembled earlier.  ‚ÄúStandard flash powder doesn‚Äôt exactly react like real explosives; you set of the detonator and there is enough of a delay as it ignites to let your opponent get to cover.‚Äù

I rubbed my eyes, bracing for another lecture.  *He‚Äôs taken the title of Chaos Marsupial far too literally*.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a second, and it‚Äôs supposed to make a bunch of smoke,‚Äù I said.  ‚ÄúNot explode.  Again, non-lethal.‚Äù

Rels gave us a Human smile, his tail up and waving back and forth excitedly.  ‚ÄúOnce again, of course,‚Äù he said.  ‚ÄúBut real bombs explode instantly; they don‚Äôt slowly pumping out a higher and higher volume of smoke.  So, to make it a bit more realistic, I modified the recipe a bit.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow late did you stay up last night?‚Äù Jarla asked, setting down the detonater she was assembling.  ‚ÄúDid you get any sleep?  And how much coffee did you drink.‚Äù

I turned back to the Yotul, who seemed to be considering his words carefully.  ‚ÄúI stayed up late enough to get it done,‚Äù he said.  ‚ÄúI got enough sleep, and only a reasonable amount of coffee.‚Äù  *So all night, none at all, and the DI‚Äôs are gonna be pissed someone raided their stash again*, I thought.

‚ÄúAnyway,‚Äù Rels said, continuing before either Jarla or I could respond.  ‚ÄúI tweaked the chemical makeup enough to make it much more reactive; basically, if you hit it hard enough.‚Äù  He pointed at Jarla‚Äôs table, and the small stack of detonators on the side.  ‚ÄúOr explode a detonator in a pile of it, it will ignite much faster.  Think of a bundle of dry grass versus a bundle of dry twigs.‚Äù

I was about to start explaining to him that he shouldn‚Äôt start playing with the chemical makeup of our mock explosives, when my pad gave a low, grating tone.  I froze, my quills flaring, as did Jarla and Rels.  *Perimeter alarm,* I thought.  *Raid.*

Jarla reacted first; dropping what she had, she gave a few strong flaps of her wings and propelled herself across the room, dropping next to the gun rack and ripping it open.  I reached out and first caught the rifle she sent me, then the magazine, quickly loading it and chambering a round.  I caught the next two magazines, stuffing them behind the belt I wore around my waist.

‚ÄúRels,‚Äù I said, seeing him setting the weapon Jarla tossed him on a table.  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got thirty seconds to set those charges.‚Äù  Out front and at our rear, our lookouts began to open fire, and was answered by a hail of gunfire on either side.  *We don‚Äôt have much time*, I thought.

Rels reached down under his table, pulling up a wire with some kind of cylindrical device attached to it.  Quickly, he gripped the cylinder and snapped it; it folded but did not break.  Dropping it, he grabbed a harness, threw it over his head, then picked up his weapon and said ‚ÄúAlready done.  We should get moving.  We have a few minutes.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou already had this place rigged?‚Äù I asked, moving to the door of our partition, wondering at the harness he now wore.  He wagged an ear -*yes*-.  *Shouldn‚Äôt be surprised*, I thought.  

‚ÄúWhose team do you think it is?‚Äù Jarla asked, stacking up on the door.  I moved to the other side of the door and we breached; her sweeping left while I went right, Rels coming up the middle.  ‚ÄúCould be Sanin; or Fayla,‚Äù Rels remarked, crouching next to a box.

‚ÄúThe easy way is to suppress the attackers out front,‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúWhile the rest exit the back.  If it‚Äôs either of those two, they‚Äôll have planned for that.‚Äù  I turned my head towards the front, a door surrounded by boxes, with the small office our lookouts had been sheltering in beyond it.  Compared to the gunfire from our rear, there were only a few answering shots.  ‚ÄúI say we rush the front; close react to ambush.  Hit them hard, push through, and scatter.‚Äù

‚ÄúOn your six,‚Äù Rels said, repositioning himself towards the door.  I nodded, and waved the three of us forward, weapon raised.  It didn‚Äôt take long to reach the door; this time Rels and I took a position on either side of the door, with Jarla ready to assault.  I flicked my ear once, twice, three times, and Rels kicked the door, quickly going right.

A round hit above me as I went left; seeing no immediate targets I dropped behind the concrete wall of the office, immediately returning fire.  Behind me, Jarla had taken flight, getting to the rafters and moving for an elevated shot.  ‚ÄúHow many?‚Äù I asked the ‚Äúsurviving‚Äù lookout; the other was stretched out on the floor, a sim round having hit their upper chest.

‚ÄúOnly a couple,‚Äù [~~Venlil-1~~] Nalim, a brown furred Venlil, replied.  He spared a glance over, and fired towards a tree, where I saw a shape taking cover.  I fired at it, and it ducked back quickly.  

Glancing over my shoulder, I keyed the radio attached the the slim collar around my neck.  ‚ÄúAnyone at the rear, move up to us now!  Jarla, suppressing fire.  Rels, Nalim, on my mark, start bounding forward.‚Äù  Behind me, across the warehouse, I heard a dull bang; someone had just opened a boobytrapped door.  *Distract us from the front, attack from the rear*.

I spied a rusted vehicle, the front tires long gone, resting in a parking lot before us.  Just ahead, only several yards, was the tree line.  Behind me, the two rear lookouts arrived, slamming the door closed behind them and taking cover.  ‚ÄúThere must be a half dozen back there at least,‚Äù a Gojid who I thought was [~~Gojid-2~~] Shen, reported, firing towards the tree line.  *Most of the team then,* I thought.  Now or never.  ‚ÄúJarla, suppressing!  Rels, Nalim, everyone else, let‚Äôs go!‚Äù

**Memory Transcription subject: [~~Venlil-2~~] Fayla
Date [standardized human time]: [~~Redacted~~] December 23, 2136**

I watched as [~~Farsul-1~~] Sarq, one of the few Farsul in the class, and [~~Krakotl-2~~] Zelkim started falling back as Macan and his team assaulted forward.  Now on the roof, I could see the blue feathers of Jarla as she lay down suppressing fire.  Perfect, I thought.  I keyed my radio, and said, ‚Äú[~~Takkan-1~~] Sarn, [~~Yotul-2~~] Kamso, and [~~Venlil-3~~] Vanek, secure the target.  Everyone else, go loud.‚Äù  

Our part of this field exercise had been to raid an enemy held building; either go in and eliminate them, or flush them out, and secure their intel.  To flush them out, I‚Äôd had three of my team rig up some extra guns to fire automatically; making it seem like we had most of our troops at the rear.  Kamso, one of our crazy neighborhood Yotul, was probably the second best at explosives; behind Rels of course, would enter with them once our opponents were driven away and disarm the explosives inside.  

To deal with the rest, our sparse ‚Äúrearguard‚Äù would fall back, letting Macan‚Äôs team pursue them‚Ä¶ right into a crossfire from the rest of us.  I spared a glance to my left, where [~~Arxur-1~~] Zirz lay, his machine gun ready.  Across from us, in a position that wouldn‚Äôt see us shoot each other, was [~~Mazic-1~~] Tupo, our Mazic heavy weapons operative, and [~~Arxur-2~~] Djir, another Arxur.

I gave myself a heartbeat to think about how crazy it was that I was leading an attack against fellow prey with Arxur on my side.  *By the Tenants, the galaxy truly has gone mad.*. Where once I‚Äôd have been terrified by the toothed visage to my left, and his smooth, warm scales, gentle claws that dug through my wool just right‚Ä¶ *Stop; don‚Äôt get distracted*, I reminded myself.

The two ‚Äúfleeing‚Äù recruits passed the kill zone, and we immediately opened fire.  I saw Macan duck behind the rusted remnant of a car; great protection, had he not been flanked.  I fired, and saw him jump as a pair of rounds hit his back.  Beside him, Nalim turned and raised his weapon before Zirz‚Äôs machine gun began to chatter, and the Venlil dropped.

Jarla, who had swooped down to the ground by now, was caught by Djir as she tried to get to cover.  Another Gojid got hit, only having made it a few yards past the structure.  *Probably still winded from running from the rest*, I thought.

The last two, another Venlil and Rels, had dove into a culvert alongside the parking lot.  ‚ÄúDjir and Tupo; shift fire, keep them pinned,‚Äù I ordered, tapping Zirz beside me to cease fire.  ‚ÄúSarq, Zelkim, flank around their rear; make sure they don‚Äôt crawl to the other end of the culvert.‚Äù  I turned to Zirz.  ‚ÄúCome on, Croc,‚Äù I said, getting up from my position.  ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs move.‚Äù  

‚ÄúAfter you sheep,‚Äù he replied, giving me a toothy grin and a gentle tap with his tail.  Instead of terrifying me like it should, it somehow gave me butterflies.  *I know Ma and Pa had worried I was diseased*, I thought as I moved, low to avoid presenting a target.  *I know they kept the exterminators from getting to me.  And I‚Äôm glad they did.*

Most of my life I‚Äôd been the ‚Äúblack sheep,‚Äù to borrow the Human term; always standing up to bully‚Äôs, always going first, always pushing my limits.  While that would have been considered a good thing on Earth, it had been decidedly un-herd like behavior.  It had been what made my parents eventually pull me from school and finish the last few years themselves; it‚Äôs what led me to the Venlil Space Corps, and what eventually led me to the Legion.

I came to a halt, on the opposite side of the car where Macan had ‚Äúdied.‚Äù  I peered around it, and saw him laying on his side, paw tapping away at his pad.  ‚ÄúCorpses don‚Äôt play games in their pads,‚Äù I teased.  ‚ÄúMust be a zombie,‚Äù Zirz added.

‚ÄúShoo,‚Äù Macan replied, not looking up.  ‚ÄúGet a move in.  If someone sees you talking to a dead body, they‚Äôll think you‚Äôre diseased.‚Äù  I shared a chuckle with the two of them, then nudged Zirz.  ‚ÄúCome on, let‚Äôs finish this.‚Äù

**Memory Transcription subject: [~~Yotul-1~~]Rels
Date [standardized human time]: [~~Redacted~~] December 23, 2136**

*Shit shit shit shit,* I repeated in my head, hugging the cold mud of the ditch, water over my paws, and peering down the culvert.  I was rewarded with a spray of sim rounds, and I ducked back just in time.  *So much for Plan B,* I thought.  

[~~Venlil-4~~] Marek, the only other surviving member of my team, lay a few feet into the culvert, now humming to himself as he picked dirt from his rifle.  We‚Äôd hoped to take cover in the culvert before advancing; the trap laid by what I suspected was Fayla having ruined Macan‚Äôs plan.  *Shame; it would have definitely worked against the feds.*

Plan B had us crawling through the culvert and making a break for the woods; based on the glimpses of an Arxur snout, they‚Äôd thought of that too.  I weighed my options.  *Can‚Äôt go through the culvert; might make it back to the warehouse before it blows, sneak around the ones probably inside now*.

I cursed myself for not grabbing a few grenades on my way out; that would have at least let me distract them.  No sense crying over spilt milk.  I shuddered.  *Gods the Humans are so gross.  Damn their useful idioms*.

Suddenly, the gunfire slowed and stopped.  I turned my ears, trying to hear where the inevitable attack would come from, but heard only silence.  Then my suspicions on our opponents identity was confirmed when I hear a familiar bleat.  ‚ÄúHey, Rels,‚Äù Fayla called out.  ‚ÄúLooks like your the last one left.  Care to surrender?‚Äù

I laughed.  ‚ÄúWhy would I do that?‚Äù I shouted back.  ‚ÄúWhen I can just wait a little bit and try to run when the warehouse goes up?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs not going anywhere,‚Äù the voice of my nemesis, my greatest rival and good drinking buddy Kamso announced, seemingly from the doorway of the warehouse.  *Speh.*. ‚ÄúNice work with the riggings; too bad I‚Äôve worked with you enough to know how to disarm your sets.  And the backup.‚Äù

‚ÄúCongrats; I‚Äôve taught you well,‚Äù I said, dropping the pitch of my voice mockingly.  ‚ÄúThe circle is now complete.‚Äù  If he‚Äôs got my backup, this mission is toast.  I straightened the harness I‚Äôd grabbed on my way out.  *Guess it‚Äôs time for Plan D.*

‚ÄúFine, fine you win,‚Äù I shouted, pulling my magazine from my weapon, then tossing the two out of the ditch in opposite directions.  Then, I checked to make sure that the harness lay properly over my neck and shoulders.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm starting to get cold anyway.  I‚Äôm coming out.‚Äù  I started climbing, pulling a nearly invisible wire from the harness as I did.

As I reached the top, I smiled inwardly, forcing my tail and ears to reflect sadness or anxiety instead of the excitement they wanted to show.  *Sloppy*, I thought.  Ahead, Fayla was standing in the opposite side of Macan‚Äôs failed cover, while Zirz, Djir, and Zelkim approached, weapons raised.  *Overconfident, are we?*

I raised my paws halfway, being careful with the wire as I did.  ‚ÄúI surrender,‚Äù I said.  ‚ÄúMind getting me a towel?  I‚Äôd like to dry off myself and my new fashion accessory.‚Äù  There was no point hiding the harness; they saw it.  With luck, they‚Äôd assume it was for carrying ammo.

‚ÄúSure, once we have you secured,‚Äù Zelkim squawked.  ‚ÄúNow keep your paws where we can see them, and get on the ground.‚Äù

I groaned aloud.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm done with hugging the dirt tonight,‚Äù I said, motioning to my mud covered fur.  I took another step forward, then another.  This time Zirz spoke, raising his rifle level with my head.  ‚ÄúStop where you are,‚Äù he hissed.  ‚ÄúPaws behind your head, and get down.‚Äù

I took a brief moment to observe my surroundings; Zelkim, Zirz and Djir were about five yards from me; Fayla was another five and behind cover; Kamso and what looked like Vanek were approaching for the building.  *Five, maybe six if I get lucky*, I thought.  *Good enough.*

‚ÄúRoger that,‚Äù I said, letting my excitement show.  I raised my paws behind my head, and saw a flash of realization in Zirz‚Äôs eyes as he saw the tiny wire in my paw.  He fired, but was already too late.

The wires pulled taut, and there was a soft click.  Then the harness exploded in an orange cloud, obscuring my vision for a moment as it blinded me.  I felt the impact of over a dozen sim rounds and it dropped, giggling despite the pain.  As the dust cleared, I saw the three closest to me covered in the orange dust; a mirror of what I looked like myself.  A bit further away, Vanek and Kamso had managed to get a little spray on them, and they looked around confused.

‚ÄúThe hell was that!?‚Äù Zirz exclaimed, brushing off some of the dust from his chest.  ‚ÄúChalk?‚Äù  He looked at his hand, then back to me.  ‚ÄúThis is going to stain, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

Suddenly, there was a loud bang from within the warehouse, and I heard a Takkan cry out in surprise.  From within the warehouse, thick white clouds of smoke began rolling towards us, and rising into the sky.  Seeing this, I pumped my paws in the air in success, still laughing.

‚ÄúThe hell was that Rels?‚Äù Fayla asked, popping her head from behind the car.

‚ÄúThat,‚Äù I said, chuckling.  ‚ÄúWas me winning.‚Äù

‚ÄúI swear to God, you fucking Chaos Marsupial,‚Äù [~~Human-1~~] Sgt Summer said, shaking his head as the now orange Yotul beamed.  ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs King Chaos Marsupial, Drill Instructor,‚Äù Rels said, tail wagging a mile a minute.  

I shook my head, and went back to digging some dirt from my action.  The ground had been muddier than I‚Äôd though when I dropped after being ‚Äúkilled,‚Äù and I‚Äôd been rewarded with a glob of mud in my action.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll let that one pass, but just this once,‚Äù Sgt Summer said.  ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let it go to your head.  We‚Äôll get to the AAR, but first, can you tell me just what the hell have you been up to?  Explain to me why you made not only a deadman switch, but a suicide vest?

‚ÄúA what!?‚Äù I squawked in shock, the name registering.  Rels looked at me, and twitched an ear in confirmation.  ‚ÄúYou were running around with us with a bomb strapped to you!?‚Äù

‚ÄúOnly for the attempt at getting out of the warehouse,‚Äù the Yotul said, still proud of himself.  ‚ÄúIt was something I was toying with, kind of a last ditch thing.  Obviously, it worked!‚Äù

As Rels started rattling off some of the history and tactics of suicide bombing, while I looked down at my rifle, my thoughts a torrent.  I had ceased to be shocked at the various ways humans had sought to kill one another; but to hear one of the prey species not only willing to use the tactic, but to seemingly support it in any way was insane!

‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù Macan asked, settling beside me.  ‚ÄúYou look a bit‚Ä¶ disturbed.‚Äù

I looked at him incredulously.  ‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre not?‚Äù I asked.  ‚ÄúI know it is a tactic, but actually killing yourself in order to harm your enemies seems‚Ä¶ wrong.‚Äù  I quickly tried to run through scenarios in my head where I‚Äôd be able to justify it.  *Sure, sacrificing yourself to protect others, or kill those who would harm others, was just duty.  But using yourself, or someone else as the weapon yourself‚Ä¶*

‚ÄúIs it any different than what we‚Äôre doing anyway?‚Äù Macan asked.  ‚ÄúI mean, we‚Äôre learning how to be guerillas; to be terrorists.  We all know we could die a thousand different ways; shot, stabbed, burned alive.  At the end of the day we‚Äôd still be dead.  So what if we take a few with us?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a difference in dying for a cause and killing yourself for it,‚Äù I replied.  ‚ÄúKilling yourself seems wasteful.  And just imagine how much inner turmoil someone should have to have to be willing to kill themselves; not die fighting, but to kill themselves to kill their enemy.  You either hate your enemy more than your own life, or you hate your life more than the enemy.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre thinking too much into it,‚Äù Macan said, wiping some dirt off his barrel.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a tactic, a valid tactic, but it‚Äôs just another tool in the toolbox.  And if it‚Äôs something that helps you win, then who cares?  At the end of the day, as long as you accomplish the objective.‚Äù  He laughed.  ‚ÄúThat rascally bastard sure did.‚Äù

I looked back at him, thinking.  ‚ÄúWe may be learning to be terrorists, and we do have a lot of tools in our toolbox, but there have to be some lines we don‚Äôt cross,‚Äù I said.  ‚ÄúI want to see victory over the Federation; to see the galaxy free, but I don‚Äôt want to lose myself in the process.‚Äù

I set my rifle on my lap, memories of the chaotic days after the interview had aired. ‚ÄúAfter the interview, I could have hated myself,‚Äù I said.  ‚ÄúI could have called myself a predator, a monster.  I could have locked myself away to protect others; or even hurt myself like so many others did.‚Äù

I turned to Macan.  ‚ÄúBut I never felt any different,‚Äù I said.  ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt feel like I wanted to eat flesh or hunt my neighbors.  I wasn‚Äôt consumed by bloodlust or a desire to rage and kill.  I was still just‚Ä¶ me.  Just Jarla.  I still liked the Exterminator show.  I still enjoyed tasting fruits from new worlds, and that imported berry wine from the Cradle.‚Äù  

‚ÄúI had friends abandon me, and I lost my job because I‚Äôm a Krakotl; everything changed.  But I don‚Äôt plan to change because of it,‚Äù I said firmly.  ‚ÄúMy religion may be fake, or it may not.  My species history may be fake, or it may not.  But I‚Äôm not fake, and I‚Äôm not going to be.  I want to change the galaxy as myself; but I don‚Äôt want the galaxy to change me.‚Äù

‚ÄúEasier said than done,‚Äù Macan said bitterly, running his paw over his weapon.  ‚ÄúWhen that damned interview aired, my friends turned on me.  I‚Äôd always been there for them, and just hearing that my species may have been omnivores in the past was enough for them to completely change their opinion of me.‚Äù

He shook his head.   ‚ÄúMy best friend was an exterminator,‚Äù he said.  ‚ÄúWe were together when we found out.  And he tried to burn me.  To cleanse the taint, he said.‚Äù  Macan balled his paws into fists, and his spines flared in anger.  ‚ÄúI lost my friends, I was fired from my job, and had to run from my world.‚Äù

He looked back at me, with a cold rage in his eyes.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want anyone to ever go through what I did again,‚Äù he said.  ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm going to make damn sure the people responsible never have the chance to do what they did to me again.‚Äù  He looked out at the slowly setting sun.  ‚ÄúAnd I don‚Äôt care how I do that.‚Äù

**Memory Transcription subject: [~~Venlil-1~~] Fayla
Date [standardized human time]: [~~Redacted~~] December 23, 2136**

It was dark before the AAR was finished and we were released to return to our barracks.  We had a few hours to rest before the next excercise; street to street fighting, with the objective of seizing a checkpoint.  *I‚Äôm already tired just thinking about it.*

I looked over Zirz beside me, his entire front half covered in orange dust.  He‚Äôd done his best to get it off; even dunking himself in a colder than anticipated stream, to no avail.  *You big dumb lizard,* I thought affectionately.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre quiet,‚Äù I said, breaking the silence.  ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs on your mind?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm thinking that the scale cleaner back in the barracks better work,‚Äù he said.  ‚ÄúOr next I‚Äôll be thinking of the best way to roast a Yotul.‚Äù  He glanced over.  ‚ÄúYou think Djir has any recipes?‚Äù

‚ÄúMonster,‚Äù I joked, bumping him, careful to not get any of the orange dust on myself.  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd waste good meat like that on a Djir recipe?  Everyone knows [~~Arxur-3~~] Heliss is the better cook.‚Äù

We both laughed as we walked down the path, completely at ease with one another.  I noticed Zirz‚Äôs tail, wagging in happiness.  *I wonder*.

‚ÄúZirz,‚Äù I asked.  ‚ÄúThat dust does look like it‚Äôll be a pain in the tail to clean off.‚Äù  He nodded in agreement.  ‚ÄúProbably,‚Äù he said.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be lucky to get it off after a night of scrubbing.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù I said slyly, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be tough to get all of that out of your scales yourself.  Especially all the nooks and crannies.‚Äù  He looked down at me, the speed of his tail wagging increasing, and he gave me a Human smile.  I could see a slight darkening to his snout; one which I‚Äôm sure was matched on mine.

‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre right,‚Äù he said.  ‚ÄúAlas, I am born with but two hands.  Woah is me.‚Äù  He feigned a dramatic sigh.  ‚ÄúIf only I had someone to help clean between my scales, but who would help such a monster as me?‚Äù

‚ÄúActing isn‚Äôt your strong suite,‚Äù I replied dryly.  ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt quit your day job.‚Äù  *He‚Äôs gonna make me ask to help him, isn‚Äôt he?*. A smug look on his face, and knowing look, confirmed my suspicions.

I huffed.  *Fine.  Guess I‚Äôll do the heavy lifting.*. I leaned in close, and wrapped my tail around his.  ‚ÄúWould you want me to help you get cleaned up?‚Äù I asked.  ‚ÄúTwo sets of paws is better than one, after all.  We need you ready for later, after all; you‚Äôll be a fat target painted orange.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôd love to have your help Fayla,‚Äù he replied, and I felt my heart soar in spite of myself.  ‚ÄúI was just planning on just staying behind you later, use you as a fluffy shield, but your idea is better.‚Äù  *And there goes the moment.*

I copied a human eye roll, and whacked him on the back of the head with my tail before returning it to curl around his.  ‚ÄúSmartass,‚Äù I muttered, and he chuckled in return.  ‚ÄúWell then, my scaly friend,‚Äù I said . ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get to it, shall we?  I hope you‚Äôve still got that brush I got you.‚Äù

Together, tails entwined, we headed for the barracks.  *It‚Äôs not a date*, I told myself.  *Just going to help him clean up.*. I bloomed, feeling my ears heat up.  *Though, maybe the next time it could be.*

We‚Äôve had some really solid conversations in person. She smiles when she sees me, comes over to talk, we dap each other up, and there‚Äôs been good eye contact and energy. We grabbed coffee once after I asked, and it went well. After that, I casually asked if she wanted to watch a movie sometime and she said yeah.

A few days later I messaged her suggesting a couple movies, and she replied saying she wasn‚Äôt really interested in any of the ones out right now, and that she was feeling pretty tired and not up for much socialising. She added, ‚Äúmaybe if I see anything I‚Äôll let you know.‚Äù I sent back a light reply and she left it on read.

What‚Äôs throwing me off is that her energy over text feels very different from how she is in person. At the gym, there‚Äôs no distance. She comes up to me, seems happy to talk, and it never feels awkward or forced. It actually feels good. But the message felt kind of like a brush-off.

Just trying to figure out if this is her way of gently passing, or if she‚Äôs just genuinely tired and not in the mood to make plans right now. Not looking to overthink it, I just want to handle it right. Should I keep it casual and see how she acts next time we talk at the gym, or step back completely?

She tried to reach out multiple times but I ignored her, and since then I‚Äôve been working on bettering myself, I lost 90 lbs, worked really hard at work, but I was still thinking about her every day.

In the beginning of May I was going out on a date to see a girl, but the girl canceled the date last minute, and then I realized I‚Äôm just a few minutes away from where my ex used to work at a coffee shop, so I don‚Äôt know what I was thinking and I went there.

She saw me when I walked in, and a few minutes later came to my table, and asked me what I‚Äôm doing here? And I answered I‚Äôm here for just a cup of coffee.

We talked for a few minutes and she didn‚Äôt let me leave, and she complemented how great I looked since I‚Äôve been working out, and wanted to have lunch with me when her shift is over.

We had lunch and we talked and she told me about everything and how she regrets leaving me for someone else, and she was praying every day that I come back and when she saw me it‚Äôs like god answered her prayers.

Then stupid me I believed all these lies, and tried to give her a second chance, since I was moving to a new city in June, I was like what can go wrong?

During this month I realized she has another man in her life, and she had sex with him a week before my birthday, and on my birthday she canceled all the plans, and now I know why!

1l20tea,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1l20tea/the_flight_that_called_me_from_nowhere/,The flight that called me from nowhere,"I work as an en-route air traffic controller in Moscow ACC. A few months ago I was transferred from the Moscow Approach Combined sector to the Moscow Control North sector ‚Äî specifically, to the night shifts, when the sectors North, West, and Gorky are collapsed into one.

At night, traffic is light. The hall gets quiet. Most of the time you just monitor. My working position is next to the T1 sector (transit traffic over the Moscow area), and not far from us there‚Äôs the Southern Moscow sector, and the merged Moscow Approach, Vnukovo TMA, Domodedovo TMA, and Sheremetyevo TMA. A pretty standard layout.

That night, I had control of the collapsed North sector. The Senior Duty Controller (SDC) was sitting just behind me, as always. Also nearby was the Flight Director ‚Äî not directly involved, just observing the overall flow.

It was a slow night. A few overflights at FL340, handoffs from T1 to North, some initial descents into Sheremetyevo via NAMIN, ROMTA. I was sipping cold coffee, monitoring a quiet frequency, when it happened.

At 01:42 local, a call popped up on the frequency:

""Moscow Control, this is Ruby 210, level three six zero.""

I almost didn't catch it at first. There was a strange modulation ‚Äî not distorted, but flat, dull, like it lacked the usual background hiss. Still, it was clear enough. Standard phraseology, correct call.

I checked the strip list.

Nothing.

No Ruby 210 on frequency. No flight plan under Ruby. No call sign match on the screen. I leaned closer, ran a quick scratch search through the FDP. Still nothing.

Maybe a callsign confusion? Someone misreading their own?

I keyed the mic.

""Ruby 210, Moscow Control, confirm your call sign.""

A pause. Then:

""Affirm, Moscow. Ruby 210, level three six zero, estimating point RULAB at zero one five seven.""

RULAB is within my airspace. I glanced at the radar again.

Still nothing.

I don't know why I didn't immediately flag it. It felt... procedural. He sounded so normal. I did what I was trained to do.

""Ruby 210, Moscow Control, roger. Squawk ident.""

Nothing happened. No ident, no radar return.

I was about to ask again when a hand landed on my shoulder.

It was the SDC.

He didn't say anything at first. Just stared at my screen.

Then, very quietly, he reached over and¬†**cut my transmission line**.

""Don‚Äôt answer that one again,"" he said.

I turned to him, confused. ""What the hell is Ruby 210?""

He didn‚Äôt blink. Just said:

""I thought we wouldn‚Äôt get it this month.""

And then he walked off to the Supervisor‚Äôs desk.

I sat there, silent, headset in my lap. No more calls came from Ruby 210. No radar return. No strip ever generated.

That night, when I got off shift, I went home and searched through my old ATC training folders. There was a section ‚Äî crash studies and incident reports. One of them hit me like a punch to the chest.

**An en-route loss of separation followed by structural failure. No survivors. Aircraft lost radar and radio contact before the incident. Estimated last call: ""Ruby 210, level three six zero"".**

The date?

**2008.**

# The Ghost in the FDP

When my shift ended at 05:00, I didn‚Äôt go straight home.

The sky outside was that iron-colored pre-dawn you only see from the high windows of a command center. The cleaning staff had just started moving through the hall. Most of the other controllers were already logging out. I sat there, headset off, staring at the empty slot on the radar screen where Ruby 210 should have been.

I told myself it was just a miscall. A bleed-over from another FIR. Maybe a simulator transmission ‚Äî I‚Äôd seen that happen before. But something in the voice, the timing, the way the SDC reacted‚Ä¶

No. I had to check.

I waited until the room was nearly empty, then slid into one of the admin terminals in the back. It wasn‚Äôt against the rules ‚Äî not exactly ‚Äî but it wasn‚Äôt encouraged either. These terminals are used for strip history, FPL archives, tech support routing. Not for casual curiosity.

I typed in:

CALLSIGN: RUBY210  
DATE RANGE: LAST 60 DAYS  
STATUS: ALL

Nothing.

Expanded the search:

DATE RANGE: LAST 365 DAYS

Still nothing.

I ran it again with wildcards. Partial callsigns. Alternate entries. Possible typos. Tried searching by aircraft type, route, SSR codes, estimated times.

Nothing.

I leaned back in the chair, staring at the screen.

Then I remembered: in training, we were taught that the FDP logs¬†*everything*. Even if it‚Äôs deleted, even if it was never assigned to a sector, the call is stored as a ""raw trace"" ‚Äî an unconfirmed object in the technical backend.

It‚Äôs not meant for operators. But I knew one of the old routing engineers ‚Äî a quiet guy named Sergey who always worked night maintenance shifts. He wasn‚Äôt in today, but I had his internal address. I sent him a short, dry message:

‚ÄúHi. Quick tech inquiry. Did any raw FDP object use the callsign RUBY210 in the past 48h, UTC range?‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt reply immediately. I went home.

I showered. Made coffee. Laid down on my bed without sleeping.

Around 09:00, my phone buzzed.

**It was Sergey.**

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt send that name again. I don‚Äôt want it in the log.

No emoji. No sign-off.

My blood went cold.

I opened my logbook. Flipped back to my entry for that night.

And noticed something else.

Under ""frequency events,"" I always write down each first contact from a flight: time, callsign, sector entry.

For Ruby 210, I had written:  
**‚ÄúRUBY210 - FL360 - RULAB - 01:42‚Äù**

But the handwriting‚Ä¶

It wasn‚Äôt mine.

# Not the First

I didn‚Äôt sleep that day.

Every time I closed my eyes, I saw that strip line. The call sign, the level, the fix. My own pen ‚Äî but not my hand. Same ink, same pressure, but something in the shape of the letters felt‚Ä¶ wrong. Like someone had written it while trying to mimic me.

I kept telling myself I was tired. That fatigue does strange things.

But it wasn‚Äôt enough.

Around 18:00, I went back to the center. Off shift, unofficial. Told security I left a personal item. They didn‚Äôt ask questions. Most of them know better than to get involved when ATC staff walks in with that look on their face.

T1 sector was working that evening. Same guy ‚Äî Anton, mid-40s, always sharp, ex-military. A guy you could trust not to panic.

I waited for his strip handover to finish, then casually slid into the break room behind the radar line. Waited for him to come grab coffee.

He noticed me immediately.

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt think you had back-to-back shifts.‚Äù  
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI just‚Ä¶ I wanted to ask you something. About last night.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt react at first. Just stirred his coffee. No eye contact.

‚ÄúI heard a call. RUBY210. No flight plan. No radar. Nothing.‚Äù

That‚Äôs when he looked up.

Long, silent stare. Not confused. Not surprised.

Just‚Ä¶ tight.

He set the cup down.

‚ÄúYou acknowledged it?‚Äù

I hesitated. ‚ÄúJust once. SDC cut my line after that.‚Äù

Anton nodded slowly, then leaned in slightly, voice low.

‚ÄúThey told me about that one in training. Back when I moved from approach. There‚Äôs no official policy. No logbook entry. But every few years, someone hears it. Sometimes it‚Äôs a different call. Always a ghost. Always FL360. Always near RULAB.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt know what to say. My heart was thudding.

‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù

Anton picked up his coffee.

‚ÄúSome say it‚Äôs a training artifact. A corrupted simulator scenario that loops. Others think it‚Äôs an old crash that never cleared from the system.‚Äù

He paused.

‚ÄúI used to think it was a myth. Until I heard it too.‚Äù

I froze.

‚ÄúYou‚Äî?‚Äù  
‚ÄúSix years ago. Same time. Same voice. I didn‚Äôt answer. But I heard it clear. Clean. Like a real flight. They never found a source.‚Äù

He started to leave the room, but stopped at the door.

‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the thing,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOnce you hear it‚Ä¶ it comes back.‚Äù

# RULAB, Again

My next night shift was three days later.

I didn‚Äôt ask for it ‚Äî the roster just fell that way. North sector again. This time, the full night shift. All three sectors ‚Äî North, West, Gorky ‚Äî combined into a single console. Traffic load: minimal. One or two transits per hour. Nothing complex.

Just like before.

The room had the same sterile hush. The radar screens glowed the same cold blue. The click of strips, the occasional handoff chatter, the low hum of air vents.

SDC was the same: Alexey, former military, calm, sharp. He didn‚Äôt mention the previous shift. But I saw him glance at my console more than once in the first hour.

I logged in. Established comms. Tested voice links. Normal.

But around 01:30 UTC, the discomfort returned.

It wasn‚Äôt fear, not yet. Just a¬†*presence*.

Like the air was thicker.

The headset felt heavier. The screen slightly too dim. The symbols on the radar ‚Äî tiny, twitchy. Not moving wrong, but¬†*not moving natural*.

I checked sector logs. No anomalies.

I opened the FDP interface. Nothing unassigned.

Then I noticed a shift: the system's latency counter ‚Äî normally 4‚Äì6 ms ‚Äî ticked to¬†**38**. Just once. Then back down. No explanation.

I checked the STCA system.

It reset itself.

**That never happens.**

At 01:41 UTC, a faint sound broke the silence. Not a voice. Not a tone. Just‚Ä¶ static. Low and sharp, like someone had keyed their mic for half a second without speaking.

SDC looked up immediately.

I stared at the screen.

Then at¬†**01:42**, just like last time:

""Moscow Control, this is Ruby Two One Zero, FL360, approaching RULAB.""

But this time‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt react.

I didn‚Äôt touch the PTT.

I let the silence hold.

The voice didn‚Äôt repeat.

But then ‚Äî something worse.

The¬†**strips auto-generated a flight**.

RUBY210.

RULAB ‚Äî 01:42.

FL360. Type: A320.

Assigned SSR:¬†**0000**.

The system had written it in.

It had filled itself in.

I felt the blood drain from my hands.

I turned to SDC.

He was staring at the same thing. Then back at me.

His voice was quiet.

‚ÄúLog it manually. Don‚Äôt acknowledge. If he speaks again‚Ä¶ give me the headset.‚Äù

# Departure of the Watcher

For seven minutes, the room was silent.

No new traffic. No handoffs. No chat on VHF or coordination lines. Just that one strip on my console:¬†**RUBY210**, FL360, inbound from¬†**nowhere**.

I didn‚Äôt touch it.

I didn‚Äôt delete it either.

SDC sat next to me, stiff, not moving. Watching. I heard him breathing ‚Äî slow, measured, like someone trying not to panic.

At 01:49 UTC, he stood up.

No words. No sigh. He just removed his headset and placed it ‚Äî neatly ‚Äî on the table.

Then he turned to me.

""If it calls again‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt respond.  
Not even to me.  
Especially not to me.""

He looked‚Ä¶ different.

Like something inside had shifted, collapsed maybe.

And then he walked out.

No handover. No explanation. No call to Ops or supervision.

The room swallowed him like he‚Äôd never existed.

I sat there, alone.

T1 sector glanced at me from his console. I saw it in his eyes ‚Äî he knew something was wrong. But he said nothing.

I hovered my cursor over the RUBY210 strip.  
Clicked its info.

The source field read:

\[undefined\]@fdp.localhost:0

Not ARINC. Not EUROCONTROL.  
Not even a manual input.

I tried to delete the strip.

**ACCESS DENIED.**

Then, exactly at 01:52, the system flashed a route update.

RUBY210  
Route amended: RULAB ‚Äî AGLAN ‚Äî PESAB  
Speed: M.78  
ETA at boundary point: ‚Äî

But the SSR remained¬†**0000**.

No transponder. No squawk.  
Still, it moved. On the scope. Smoothly. Perfectly.

Like it was real.

Or worse ‚Äî like it was¬†**remembering**¬†what real looked like.

# Echoes in the Wire

At 02:07 UTC, the call came in.

Not on the main ops line.  
Not on the coordination loop.  
On the¬†**maintenance interlink**, usually reserved for backend tech support ‚Äî database failures, voice channel diagnostics, that kind of thing.

I didn‚Äôt even know it had a ringer.

But there it was.  
A dull amber flash on the bottom screen.  
**CALL: SYS/MAINT LINE 04 ‚Äî INCOMING.**

I hesitated.  
Then answered.

""Moscow Control, North sector combined. Who‚Äôs calling?""

A pause.  
Then a flat voice. Filtered. Almost synthetic.

""Confirm your current FL360 inbound from RULAB. Callsign: Ruby Two One Zero.""

I froze.

""That‚Ä¶ flight is not under control. Strip appeared automatically. SSR 0000. No voice contact since 01:42.""

The voice didn‚Äôt change tone.

""Do not delete. Do not amend. Do not report this to your supervisor.""

I stared at the screen.

""Who is this?""

The reply came instantly.

""This communication is monitored. Further inquiry will be noted. Resume normal operations.""

**Click.**

Line dead.

No trace in the phone logs. No caller ID.  
No redial option.

I looked around.  
The T1 controller was typing strips, pretending not to have heard.

But I saw the sweat on his collar.

# The Weight of the Signal

02:15 UTC. The control room felt wrong, like the air had thickened into something you could taste. The hum of the air vents was there, but beneath it, a faint vibration pulsed through the floor, like the system itself was straining. The RUBY210 strip sat on my console, its text glowing faintly, daring me to interact with it.

I didn‚Äôt.

Anton, at T1 sector, was still typing, but his movements were off‚Äîjerky, like he was forcing himself to focus. His coffee sat cold, untouched. He‚Äôd heard the maintenance line call. I knew he had. But he didn‚Äôt look at me, didn‚Äôt say a word.

The radar showed the RUBY210 blip, still tracking toward IPSIL at Mach 0.78. No transponder. No ADS-B. Just a ghost, moving through my airspace like it had every right to be there. I checked the system logs again. Nothing. No record of the maintenance interlink call. No trace of RUBY210 beyond the strip and its route: RULAB to IPSIL to LEMRO.

I wanted to message Sergey again, ask what he meant by ‚Äúghost packet.‚Äù But his warning‚Äî‚ÄúDon‚Äôt send that name again‚Äù‚Äîstopped me cold. My phone stayed in my pocket.

At 02:20 UTC, the radar flickered.

Not a full blackout, just a single frame, like the system blinked. The RUBY210 blip vanished, then reappeared, now closer to IPSIL. The latency counter spiked‚Äî39 ms‚Äîthen dropped back to normal.

I kept my headset off. Alexey‚Äôs words echoed in my head:¬†*‚ÄúDon‚Äôt respond. Especially not to me.‚Äù*¬†What did that even mean? I glanced at his station. His headset was still there, perfectly centered, cord coiled tightly. No sign of him. The supervisor‚Äôs desk was empty. No Flight Director. Just me and Anton in a room that felt too vast.

Then the strip updated.

RUBY210.  
Route amended: IPSIL ‚Äî LEMRO ‚Äî \[undefined\].  
ETA: ‚Äî.  
Status: ACTIVE.

*Active?*

The system shouldn‚Äôt mark a flight active without a confirmed radar return or flight plan. My hands shook as I opened the FDP interface and queried the strip‚Äôs source.

\[undefined\]@fdp.localhost:0

Same as before. But now a new field appeared:  
*Last update: 02:22 UTC. Operator: \[REDACTED\].*

I hadn‚Äôt touched the strip. No one had.

I glanced at Anton. His hands were still, hovering over his keyboard. His eyes were locked on his screen, but he wasn‚Äôt typing.

‚ÄúAnton,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúYou seeing this?‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt look up. Just nodded, slow, like he was afraid to move.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt touch it,‚Äù he said, voice barely audible. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll go away. It always does.‚Äù

*Always?*

I wanted to press him, but the maintenance interlink lit up again. Amber flash, no sound. Just a pulsing light, like a warning.

I didn‚Äôt answer.

It stopped after eight seconds.

Then my headset crackled. Not the main frequency. Not the coordination line. The emergency backup channel, used only for overflow or critical failures.

‚ÄúMoscow Control, Ruby Two One Zero, requesting descent to FL340.‚Äù

The voice was the same‚Äîflat, too clean, like it was reciting something it had said a thousand times before.

My hand twitched toward the PTT, years of training screaming to respond. But Alexey‚Äôs words held me back. I let the silence stretch.

The crackle stopped.

The strip updated:  
RUBY210.  
Level: FL340.  
Status: DESCENDING.

The radar blip shifted downward, smooth and precise, as if my silence had given it permission to move.

# The Last Fix

03:05 UTC. I was unraveling. The control room was a void‚Äîno chatter, no handoffs, just the weight of RUBY210 on my console. The strip hadn‚Äôt updated in nearly thirty minutes. The radar blip held at FL340, tracking toward LEMRO. No conflicts, no other traffic. Just a ghost, gliding through the night.

Anton hadn‚Äôt spoken since his warning. His strips were piling up, unprocessed, his posture rigid like he was waiting for something to break. I couldn‚Äôt sit still. The air felt heavy, pressing against my chest. I stood, walked to the coffee machine, more to escape the console than because I needed a drink.

That‚Äôs when I saw it.

Alexey‚Äôs station. His headset wasn‚Äôt just placed‚Äîit was¬†*arranged*, cord coiled in a perfect spiral. Next to it, a single handwritten strip.

I hadn‚Äôt noticed it before.

I shouldn‚Äôt have looked.

But I did.

RUBY210.  
FL360. RULAB. 01:42.  
In Alexey‚Äôs handwriting. At the bottom, in smaller, sharper letters:  
*‚ÄúDon‚Äôt follow me.‚Äù*

My heart stopped. I scanned the room. Anton was still at his console, head down. The cleaning staff hadn‚Äôt reached this side yet. I folded the strip and slipped it into my pocket, not sure why. It felt like proof. Or a curse.

Back at my console, the radar blip was gone. The strip remained, but its status had changed:  
RUBY210.  
Status: TERMINATED.  
Last update: 03:07 UTC.  
Operator: \[REDACTED\].

No log of the termination. No record of the blip vanishing. The system was clean, like RUBY210 had never been there.

But the strip was real. Ink on paper. Heavy in my pocket.

At 03:40 UTC, Anton stood. He didn‚Äôt look at me. Just logged out, grabbed his jacket, and headed for the door. He paused, his back to me.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt come back tomorrow,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúTake a sick day. Trust me.‚Äù

He left without another word.

I finished the shift alone. No more calls. No updates. I left the RUBY210 strip on the console when I logged out at 05:00. I didn‚Äôt want it following me home.

But when I reached my car, I felt it in my pocket. The handwritten strip from Alexey‚Äôs desk. I hadn‚Äôt put it there.

I haven‚Äôt returned to the center. I called in sick, like Anton said. Last night, my phone buzzed at 01:42. No caller ID. Just a voicemail.

I haven‚Äôt listened to it.

But every time I pass a window, I catch myself looking up at the sky. At FL360. Toward RULAB.

And I swear, sometimes, I hear static.",1,1748918047.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False
1l20swp,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1l20swp/thoughts_on_caplyta/,Thoughts on  Caplyta,"Hi, 

I am very sensitive to EPS/TD and it has felt like a nightmare having to learn about which meds have the least chance of causing this. I feel so alone because since mine is not as noticeable my family & doctors write it off. But it has spread to my teeth years later even without being on meds. But I found out weed and coffee were factors and if the nigrostriatal pathway has been damaged or compromised it is sensitized to any dopamine related effects. Both of which could be caused by cannabis & coffee. It‚Äôs like I shot myself in the foot because I didn‚Äôt know this. Although, I knew that I shouldn‚Äôt have been smoking weed or drinking so much coffee. I believe I was self medicating due to depression. 

My point is that each time I am hospitalized I get shot up with Haldol & Cogentin. My lips began to swell that it looked like I had a bad case gone wrong of botox injections and there was nothing I could do but hope it would go away. Could you imagine how distressing that could be. 

It also didn‚Äôt help that my psychiatrist had also prescribed me a high dose of Latuda 80mg, which despite being a newer med, is a strong D2 blocker - making it a moderate to high risk, especially combined with Haldol & Cogentin. I also recently found out that even Cogentin can cause TD to worsen. 

So, after researching all the meds that could possibly be safer for my sensitivities their were minimal choices. 

Seroquel is my God send for sleep and mania but not necessarily a good daily AP despite it being one of the minimal ones that cause these effects. 

Although, I discovered that Caplyta, although new, focuses on targeting more of a Serotonin receptor not associated with movement parts of the brain.

I also read that Caplyta is only dosed as a single 42mg. You don‚Äôt have any other dosages they can prescribed which is similar to about 40mg of Latuda respectively. So, the doctor cannot overmedicate you. So I am planning on having  them mark it on my chart to never use Latuda again if I am not in a condition to choose, even though I pray that may never be the case again with early intervention and a better understanding of my condition. 

It‚Äôs all rather complicated, but I wanted to know what anyone‚Äôs experience has been like on Caplyta? ",1,1748918004.0,BipolarReddit,1,1.0,False

Feeling used, confused, and trying to heal.","I‚Äôm currently on Day 1 of a no contact challenge, and I‚Äôm struggling.
I couldn't sleep last night ‚Äî too many thoughts, too many questions. I keep asking myself: Was I just used? Did he ever even care?

We weren‚Äôt just hooking up ‚Äî we were something. Or at least, that‚Äôs what I thought.

He started off so strong. Put in effort, showed care, picked me up, dropped me home, remembered my likes/dislikes, even got me fancy food on dates. He seemed emotionally mature, kind, funny ‚Äî someone I could genuinely look up to. I started to open up about my family, my struggles, and my messy days, and he listened. He opened up to me about his ex, past traumas, his dead dad, etc. It felt safe.

But after a few months, he started pulling away. Delayed replies, lack of interest, no check-ins. When I gently asked what was going on, he gave vague answers like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just lost‚Äù ‚Äî then later told me his mom didn‚Äôt approve of my matrimonial profile and he didn‚Äôt want to argue with her or try to convince her otherwise.

That broke me. Not just because she didn‚Äôt approve ‚Äî but because he didn‚Äôt even try.
No stand. No fight. No ‚Äúlet‚Äôs figure it out.‚Äù
Just‚Ä¶ retreat.

I felt completely abandoned. In my mind, I kept wondering ‚Äî what‚Äôs so wrong with me that I‚Äôm not even worth defending?

Still, I tried to be civil. We ended it. Then a month later, I reached out just to check in. We met again. Friendly. Platonic. Fine.

But then came the confusion again.

He initiated physical intimacy. We drank, we kissed, we hooked up. And it didn‚Äôt stop at once. This kept happening for a few weeks ‚Äî until he started going distant again. I finally asked what we were doing, and he pulled out the old ‚Äúwe talked about this, we‚Äôre just friends‚Äù line.

When I asked why he kept crossing boundaries when he knew I liked him and he didn‚Äôt want more ‚Äî he said, ‚Äúyeah, should‚Äôve had boundaries,‚Äù followed by vague non-answers and defensive energy like I was blaming him.

I wasn‚Äôt blaming him. I was hurting. I told him I did what I did because I still had feelings ‚Äî he did it knowing he didn‚Äôt. And now I'm left wondering: Did he ever really see me for me? Or was I just convenient?

Now he says he wants to ‚Äúbe friends with boundaries,‚Äù but I‚Äôve decided not to reach out again. We were supposed to meet for coffee, but he said he ‚Äúneeds space to process.‚Äù What is there to process when he already made his choice?

I miss him. I keep getting waves of ‚Äújust one message,‚Äù but I‚Äôm trying not to give in. I‚Äôve done this before ‚Äî I‚Äôve healed before. But right now, it just hurts.

If anyone‚Äôs been in this weird in-between space where someone says they want ‚Äújust friendship‚Äù but acts differently, how did you cope?
And how do you stop feeling like you were just used for attention, comfort, or sex?

Any insights are welcome. Just wanted to share.",2,1748917924.0,RelationshipIndia,3,1.0,False
1l20ryf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1l20ryf/captain_and_deckhand_is_he_into_me_or_am_i/,"Captain and deckhand, Is he into me or am I reading too deeply into it?","I recently got offered a job deck handing on a party boat for my sisters friend, Im 18F and hes 23M. He is a captain that runs a pretty successful company for party boat on a popular lake near me. My sister, him, and myself all hungout for a whole weekend staying at his place and my sister and I kept getting the vibe he was flirting. Little things like her catching him looking up at me while he played guitar, checking me out, making a point to sit next to me in ubers, etc. I didn‚Äôt think much of it until my sister told me she was getting that vibe. He also has shown a lot of interest in my last relationship. I recently went through a breakup and he‚Äôd been encouraging me to leave for quite some time, he‚Äôd even go as far as to take my phone so i wouldn‚Äôt get caught up on talking to my ex while I was there. Anyway he insisted on me coming out to deckhand for his boat party that weekend and said I had a great personality for it. I was nervous and decided to push through and go anyway.

The day comes and we agree that I come a couple hours early so that I can learn the ropes and break my nerves before we pick the group up. Its hard to summarize those first couple hours but I definitely felt like he was flirting with me. He wouldnt let me carry anything even though I told him it was my job (Ik this is normal, he is just kind) but he literally wouldn‚Äôt let me carry or pay for anything. He let me drive the boat and he was being quite touchy like leaning up against me and holding the wheel with me. Told me to go sit in the front of the boat in front of wheel and keep my eyes on him while he drove the boat under a huge sprinkler type thing, i got soaked. He was just being sweet, he also took me to get coffee at this popular coffee shop. he kept asking me if i thought he looked good because ‚Äúhe likes to look good for his groups‚Äù. lastly i brought bandanas and he wanted to wear them together and match, he even had my tie his on because he ‚Äúdidnt know how‚Äù‚Ä¶ then he took pictures of us. He also asked if I wanted him to take pics of me in front of the view. These are all kind of mediocre compared to what happened once the group got on.

Anyway we pick up the group and they are all so kind, it immediately puts me at ease. We get familiar with everybody yk introductions, basic rules etc, encourage a couple beer bongs and then let them do their thing, my job was basically just to check on them and make sure they had drinks and were having a good time every now and then. As the night went on the flirting was getting heavier, he (lets call him Josh) would touch my waist, getting really close when talking to me, the things hed say were flirtatious. I was sitting in the captain chair and he‚Äôd come sit on my lap. At one point he picked me up out of the chair by my armpits lol. Him and I spent a lot of time on the upper deck because everyone was below and we would just lay there and talk. His friend even sent him a video from another boat where josh and I were laying up top next to each other and he was kicking his feet. Later, were on the lily pad (like a floating pad that you connect to the boat) and he put seaweed on my head and said ‚Äúso pretty‚Äù.

Eventually he left for a second while I was on the top deck and one of the guest came up and the first thing he said to me was asking if the captain and I were dating, to which I replied no‚Ä¶ He said it seemed obvious we were into eachother and that confirmed my thoughts. I just want an outside opinion and want to know if I am just taking it to deep!! I honestly denied it until the guest had come up and asked me about it, he was in fact a man so idk.",2,1748917922.0,AskMenAdvice,4,1.0,False

So, in 1997, my mom, who was not a big fan of F1, bought my dad a Damon hill mug (his favorite driver at the time) . My dad loved that mug, has always said it was his favorite mug he has ever had (he drinks a cup or 2 of coffee/tea every morning). unfortunately, it got broken or lost in the mid 2000's. With fathers day coming up, i want to see if i can find that mug or something close to it. i dont remember all the details on the mug from him tell me over the years and i dont want to ask him so i can make it a surprise. 

  
‚Ä¢ i know it was from the 1996 season as he says it had his championship winning car on it

‚Ä¢ I also think he said that hill was holding the trophy on it as well, but that may be wrong

‚Ä¢i would guess it would have been a officially licensed mug as, being from the Midwest region of the USA, i wouldn't think there would be a lot of knockoff damon hill mugs in stores or what not in the USA in 97. (i cant find out where my mom bought it as she passed away in 2016)

‚Ä¢I have also tried to find it myself, but all i can come up with are mugs from Redbubble and other shovelware merch stores like that. ive also checked ebay from time to time and get nothing.

I have always wanted to grow citrus and have seen other people in the area growing them but could never find any at the nursery.  Well yesterday I finally found some small lemon and lime trees and some larger orange varieties.  How often should I water and fertilize?  Do citrus trees do well with coffee grounds and or epsom salt and how often?  What encourages flower/fruit production?

The small lemon and lime trees say they are hardy to zone 7b on the container but the tag wrapped around the trunk says to cover or bring indoors when below 30*F or -1C.  I planted both of them together in a large planter that I can bring indoors if needed this winter.  Will I need to bring them indoors or wrap them this winter since they are supposedly hardy in 8b?  Should I expect these to flower this year or next year?

I went back today and bought a larger Meyer lemon tree that has two fruits already growing and also a tangerine variety that has a few fruits growing.  I don‚Äôt see anymore flowers on either, so I wonder with these two, will that be all I‚Äôll get this year or should I expect more flowers to bud in the coming weeks?  These also are supposedly hardy but I put them in individual planters as well.  Will these need to be covered or brought indoors this winter?
One last question, I have a friend who has a satsuma tree, can I take a cutting and graft it to my tangerine tree?  I‚Äôve tried cuttings before with hibiscus and I‚Äôve never been successful but I read all the time about citrus doing well with grafting.  How long does a graft take to incorporate?

Sorry for all the questions; I love to garden but I am a complete noob with citrus.

**Please no transphobia or homophobia it's pride month**

Me (Mtf) and my crush (nonbinary they/them) have been friends at work for like 4 months. We talk a lot and ask each other questions about our interests and goals and stuff and encourage each other in schooling and career stuff. The only person I've formed a friendship with at this job. I am demisexual and pan. They are only into women.

Two weeks ago I realized that I didn't identify with the nonbinary label anymore after using she/they pronouns for 3 years. I told my boss I was a woman and that I wanted a new name tag that represented this. That Monday after the weekend I saw them at work and we started talking about gender expression and stuff. I didn't know they were nonbinary at this point. I come out to them as my true self and they come out to me. We talk about our sexuality and explain our gender preferences for a bit and then we both have to go back to work so we end the conversation and say bye as we will likely not have a chance to talk again until next shift. 

That Friday we talk about me wanting to get out more and meet people and their struggles with never getting responses and people being really flaky in our local queer community. There's like a 5 second pause and I check the time and they are leaving so say bye have a nice day see you Monday. 

Monday rolls around and we have another chance to talk. It's memorial day and our retail store is slow as fuck. So we closed down the front register and they came to my department to check people out for me. We had 4 hours to talk and it was just nonstop conversation. Id get an order and do it and we'd pick up right where we left off. Same thing when they had to check someone out. The topic of me wanting to go out more came up again and I talk about how I haven't dated since 2021 and they ask if I'm currently interested in anyone or seeing anyone. To which I reply ""PFFFFFFFT NOPE!"" they ask how I feel about dating currently and I say ""I have school going on and I'm really focused on that so it's not something I put time into or even really care about right now."" Now I'm not very good at picking up on body language (autism) but I'm pretty sure after I said that their head dropped a noticable amount. At this point I'm thinking they might be into me so my demisexual brain starts firing and I'm realizing how cool they are and how well our personalities mesh. We talk more about me wanting to go out more to meet new people and get involved in the local queer community. Their shift ends I say bye

That night I tell a few friends I think I have a crush and all of them are saying I should've asked them out and that they are clearly interested in me. I really value being professional at work so even if I did ask them out then and there it would've felt wrong to me. 

Friday rolls around and I bring up that one of my favorite bands will be playing at a pride event but that I most likely won't be able to make it and that I'm bummed about it. They say ""yea I took off work for this other pride event but I only have a few friends to go with."" And I reply in and unsure voice ""I mIghT bE aBle To MAkE iT."" KNOWING I WORK THAT DAY. Earlier that week my friend decided we were gonna move to a new town and I started looking for new work. Currently have 3 interviews lined up. All my friends say again that I should've just asked them out again because I knew I'd be leaving the job at some point. But again I am very against forming relationships with people I work with. All of them are telling me I HAVE to ask them out Monday (today) we make a plan over the weekend and I'm ready prepared and convinced that I should do this. 

Today was literally the busiest non holiday day I've ever worked after being there for 2 years. Usually I get there early so I can go grab something to eat then I eat in the break room while they are on their break after their break is done we both go to do our jobs. So this morning I go to buy some bottled coffee from our little snack area at the front register. I break the news that I'm moving out with my friend and that I'll be putting in my two weeks as soon as I find work. A customer rolls up so I lose my chance to ask them out. Queue 5 hours of the busiest day so busy they don't have time to take their break until I clock in. Again losing out on the chance to ask them on a date. Usually when around 4 rolls around we close the register and we get a chance to chat for about 45 mins depending on how busy we both are. I'm fuckin busy. I still had like 12 orders in the queue and I'm busting ass so I can get all the ones due today done so I can ask them out. I finally get a chance to at least let them know I can make it to pride and they say ""Don't you work that day?"" And I go ""Oh don't you worry about that"" and they seemed a little happy about that but again I don't pick up on social signals or body language. My supervisor was still there like an hour and a half late and I'm trying to convince him to leave so I can ask them out before their shift ends. We exchange numbers and say we'll talk about plans in the next few days.  Now I literally had maybe 10 mins to talk to them 3 of them alone right before their shift ends.

I have 45 hours of sick time saved up that I have never used. So I'm using 8 of them to call off Friday and go to pride with a friend and meeting them there where I am 100% going to get them alone and ask them out. But I'm still not convinced they are into me. People have genital preferences and stuff but if they're trans and I'm trans I think the possibility they're into it is higher than if they were cis and straight. Are they into me? I'm making my move on Friday regardless but I just need the input of non biased and non invested people.

A few other things. They have said that drag queens makeup looks pretty and I showed them a picture of me in a dress at a wedding I attended Sunday and they complimented it and said my hair looked nice. Also complimented my hair today saying it makes me look more feminine. When we were first getting to know each other they would ask me question after question about my travels. To the point where I couldn't really ask them questions because right after I finished answering one they would ask another. We show each other our art a lot and compliment it and talk about art and stuff.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Dear Ember People,

I want to like this mug. I really do! When it‚Äôs working, it keeps my coffee at a perfect 145 degrees. I haven‚Äôt found another solution that will do this, and I have a collection of various mug warmers gathering dust to prove it.¬†

So I trudge along, dealing with the constantly failing charging pins; the app that makes it ever so hard to connect to the cup or once connected, to keep it connected; the charging that constantly fails, and the almost indecipherable lights.¬†¬†

Just now, I am getting random blinking: white slow-blinking light, then solid red, and the app says I need to charge the cup. Now random rapid red light blinking, now no light at all. (I‚Äôm typing this in real time, so that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm seeing.)¬†¬†

I have reset the cup until I‚Äôm blue in the face. I‚Äôve Bluetoothed and re-Bluetoothed until I can Bluetooth no more.¬†¬†

I‚Äôve considered offerings; you know, maybe throw in a shot of whiskey to see if that appeases the¬†EmberCupGods. But I‚Äôm not ready to go that far yet.¬†

Please tell me you are working on the tech; that one day, an¬†Ember¬†cup will heat my coffee to a perfect 145 degrees without making me feel like Charlie Brown once again helplessly but hopefully kicking an¬†EmberCup-shaped football that we all know Lucy will snatch up at the last minute.¬†¬†

Still no light, and the Bluetooth has dropped again. ‚ÄúConnect to your¬†Ember,‚Äù it pleads; and I can offer no succour.¬†

I have narrowed down my espresso machine search to two options. My main requirements are a relatively small machine due to counter space limitations, the ability to do a 1 oz or 2 oz shot ( I often do just a single-shot espresso drink, due to not always wanting a ton of caffeine), and , last and most important, a quiet machine. On my in-office days I am the first one awake in the house ( my mom is a \*very\* light sleeper), so I don't want a machine that makes too much noise. I have watched videos for the grinder and machine I plan on purchasing, and it seems the noise level is fine. 

I want a separate grinder and machine, as it works better for the limited counter space ( as I can put the grinder in one place, and the machine in another). 

  
I decided I felt better buying  a machine from a brick and mortar store, that way returns/repairs can be more straightforward. 

I""m thinking of the following Grinder:

And the following machine:

I know a quality grinder is important. Looking at my favorite coffee house for whole beans. 

It seems the De'Longhi Machine is quiet, compact, and easy to use for a manual machine. You can do a single or double shot easily. ( Single shots are important. Sometimes I do one caf and one decaf.)

The grinder is quiet and high quality, and designed for use with espresso machines.

## Key Features Analysis

The best morning coffee mugs of 2025 boast a range of impressive features designed to elevate your coffee ritual. From temperature retention to ergonomic design, manufacturers have prioritized functionality and user experience.

**Temperature Retention:** A vital feature for any quality coffee mug is its ability to maintain the optimal drinking temperature for an extended period.

The most advanced models in 2025 utilize double-walled vacuum insulation technology, capable of keeping coffee hot for up to 6 hours and cold beverages chilled for as long as 24 hours. This impressive performance ensures that your coffee remains at your preferred temperature throughout the morning, whether you're savouring it slowly or tackling a busy schedule.

Attention to detail in the ergonomic design makes a significant difference in the overall usability of the mug.

Many coffee mugs now feature innovative lid designs with silicone seals and secure locking mechanisms that prevent leaks, even when the mug is turned upside down.Some lids also incorporate a convenient sliding or flip-top opening for easy sipping while on the go. The quality of the lid is a crucial factor in determining the overall practicality and portability of the mug.

The first bag was just outside our door one morning‚Äîa plain brown paper sack, no markings, folded neatly at the top, and warm to the touch. Inside was a single to-go cup of coffee, no note, no receipt. Just the scent of freshly brewed dark roast wafting into our hallway.

At first, I thought it was a delivery mistake. Wrong apartment, maybe. I left it untouched and placed it on the ledge by the stairs. It was gone an hour later.

But it happened again. The next day, another bag, same spot, still warm. This time, I knocked on a few neighbors' doors to ask if anyone had ordered coffee. Most shrugged it off, a few joked that maybe I had a secret admirer. My wife, on the other hand, was less amused. She‚Äôs allergic to coffee‚Äîseverely so‚Äîand didn‚Äôt find the mystery romantic. She was nervous, and that made me nervous.

The third morning, it wasn‚Äôt just one bag. There were two. One cup was black coffee, the other was something creamier, possibly a latte.

We started checking the hallway camera. The landlord installed them last year after a package theft scare. Sure enough, at 4:36 a.m., a hooded figure stepped into view, crouched by our door, and placed the bags down carefully‚Äîdelicately, almost reverently. Then they turned and left, slipping down the stairs like they knew exactly where the blind spots were.

I had tried the keto diet in the past and it was amazing, although I never really tracked anything and I'm pretty sure I was starving myself. But I did go down to around 265lb from my starting weight of 318lb. This was a few years ago and since then I gained back a bunch, up to 350lb and had gotten diagnosed with type 2 IR diabetes. I started making more home meals with healthier options and cut out sugary drinks, and got down to 320, and with exercise down to 310. That's where my latest journey is starting.

I went in for a liver biopsy (had autoimmune hepatitis ...or not, idk my latest result showed no sign, but my fatty liver was bad and had stage 3 fibrosis.) Im only 22 and honestly this is really scary for me, so I wanted to make a much needed change in my weight and decided to try keto again due to my results the first time, and all of the positive stuff I've heard about it for managing fatty liver and diabetes.

On to the fun stuff...these last two weeks were definitely much easier starting out then the first time. First of all I prepped a lot of meals and had plans set out for what I wanted to make. I think I underestimated the amount of delicious food I can have on this diet.

I've been only drinking water with my electrolytes, and occasionally a sparkling ice water or coke zero...although I'm trying to cut the soda out entirely. I want to continue the sparkling ice water to have some semblance of good flavor...but I may also just get a homemade carbonation machine and add some mio flavoring to water.

Truvia has become my new best friend for anything sweet. I use erythritol for some cooking but it seems to leave a strong long lasting after taste in my mouth that I'm not a big fan of. 

I've been keeping a close eye on my glucose and ketones (mostly just because the keto mojo came with both strips). I don't care too much about the ketones in the blood as long as they are within the normal range, and my glucose seems to be mostly steady between 80 and 100. Occasionally I'll have to have a beef stick or something to raise it if I'm in between lunch and dinner and see it go below 80.

Overall I'm really happy with the new energy I've been having. Im really trying to go to like 220lbs if possible...and I've started exercising around 30 minutes a day, biking or walking. Also trying to live a more active lifestyle by camping and doing more cleaning, yarn work, etc. I still work in an office sitting, but this is still a major change in my lifestyle that I never thought I'd be able to keep up with.

I read up on the macros and calorie deficit...and I just wanted to make sure I am doing good with what I'm having. Usually, for breakfast I've been having coconut ghee coffee, and my lunches and dinner contain mostly protein and some fat. I downloaded a tracking app and it looks like I go way over the protein limit, and under fat and calories. According to what I've read for weight loss on keto, this seems to be alright though. I also seem to be missing some of the other targets and just wanted to make sure I'm not missing something horrible. Gonna send the pictures below all the rest of this of my tracking for today.

Really appreciate any advice, comments or questions yall can provide. Im new here but I plan on making keto/low carb a major part of my life for a good amount of time if not indefinitely so might be here a while silently browsing the community.

All of these perfumes are 200ml, so it should last me two lifetimes!!!

By the way, while there is some sort of tobacco, these are NOT like Mancera Red Tobacco, or CH Mystery Tobacco, where the cigar leaf is front and center.  The tobacco in these is really mild, almost invisible.  It seems to blend into other accords.

**Brazilian Tobacco:**  This is a lighter version of PDM Haltane with some light tobacco thrown in for good measure.  Performance is good, about 6 to 8 hours.  I applied it before I went to work and by the end the day it was a skin scent.  On clothing it lasts quite a while.  Overall, excellent scent if you like Haltane and Oud for Greatness with a twist.

**French Tobacco:**  I wanted this one originally since I've hear it's a dupe of LV Imagination.   It is not 1 for 1, but it has the Imagination DNA but I find French Tobacco sharper, brighter and it lasts a looong time.  This one lasted about 10 hours.  I put it on before work and the wife could still smell me at dinner time.  This one is a beast.  Very refreshing and awesome perfume.

**Arabian Tobacco:**  This one is a sweet, coffee, and tobacco perfume.  I get caramel and some amber which makes it luxurious.   This is very middle-eastern stereotypical perfume.  Not something the average bloke wears.  I did get compliments with this one, which I was surprised, and not expecting it.  This is also beast mode, it will last 10 hours and on clothing until you wash it.

Overall, the three perfumes are so good, that I bought 3 more which I will do an impression when I get them.  The new ones are Spanish, Mexican, and Jamaican Tobacco.

Many fics (especially bashing ones) reveal this as at least an outdated claim if not an outright lie.

But what does a Hogwarts that truly is the best look like to you. What do you add or improve to better match reader expectations of truly amazing school with loads of opportunities you'd get nowhere else? 

Things like: 

* Clubs, lots of clubs
* More sports than just quidditch
* Way more electives. Basics like business, medicine, etc. But also things like alchemy and enchanting, warding, magical research, etc. These might possibly only be on offer post-OWLs. Classes that actually seem like they'd teach how to do or make many of the impressive magical feats shown (like how to make a flying broom)

Dude, it's giving me major brain melt. I mained all the healers, right? Savage cleared and all that jazz. Thought I'd be cool and try tanking, specifically DRK. Holy moly, it's like a freakin' light show on my hotbar.

Seriously, there are SO MANY glowy buttons and these little timer things everywhere. My brain feels like a scrambled egg trying to keep track of the MP bar, Salted (which has a totally wonky cooldown, btw, what's up with that?), Carve, Delirium, Darkside, Living Shadow... it's a freakin' novel of abilities!

How the heck do people even deal with this without just staring at their hotbar the whole fight? I feel like I'm playing ""Whack-a-Mole"" with glowing icons instead of actually, you know, fighting the giant monster trying to eat my face. Even when I played AST, and that's got its fair share of card-slinging chaos, it didn't feel this‚Ä¶ button-y.

It's kinda wild, right? Like, you're supposed to be all epic and tanky, but half your brainpower is dedicated to making sure you hit the right glowy thing at the right time. It's giving me low-key anxiety just thinking about missing a cooldown and wiping the raid 'cause my Salted was, like, 0.5 seconds off.

Honestly, sometimes I wonder if all this timer-watching and frantic button-mashing is secretly rewiring my brain. Like, am I gonna start seeing cooldowns in real life? ""Dude, hold on, my coffee needs another 30 seconds on its internal CD before I can sip it."" It's probably giving us all some form of digital-induced ADHD or something.

So yeah, how do you guys even manage this without your eyeballs twitching and your soul slowly draining away from the sheer mental effort of staring at a million blinking lights? This ""streamlined and easy game"" is making my tanking dreams feel like a recipe for a digital meltdown. Just sayin'.

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it‚Äôs time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero‚Äôs journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can‚Äôt even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don‚Äôt wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

1l202iw,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiagnoseMe/comments/1l202iw/looking_for_some_advice_i_guess_i_noticed_my/,Looking for some advice I guess I noticed my chest was sore for the last few months.,"Just a little backstory here. What happened was I went on a trip when I got back a couple days later I noticed what appeared to be a red rash on my chest. Didn't know what it was from so I ended up getting it checked out. I went to my local walk-in clinic. They said it seemed like it was possibly cellulitis so I ended up getting some treatment for it some type of medication that I was supposed to take. Now it kind of baffled me as to where it came from in the first place. I did go into a hot tub that was in this hotel room for about 5 or 10 minutes. Now it looked like it was clean water but who really knows. So I got it taken care of but my chest was still sore. It seemed like after everything. 


So I go to the hospital this time a doctor checks it out and he says oh it looks like everything's coming along healing good  and I say well  my chest seems a little sore. He says oh well you know it might be sore after an infection. You might have inflammation take a little bit of ibuprofen or something and eventually they will resolve itself so I say okay.

Couple weeks later the same problem. Still there. Feels like my chest is sore. I go back into the walk-in clinic now and I tell them what's going on. I say you know my chest still looks a little red. Kind of here they say oh yeah, kind of does look a little red. We'll take a sample and send it off to the lab and see what it is. I say. Oh yeah, my chest is kind of still hurting. It's sore and they say oh you know you're probably still inflamed. You might have some sore ligaments or cartilage so I say okay.

Fast forward. It's been 2 months later at least and my chest is still sore In the area to the right of my left nipple like if you were looking down at yourself it would be towards the right almost by the middle of your chest That's the area where it seems like it's sore.

Now when I first had the rash and my chest was sore I wasn't sure exactly what it was. So I think they did an EKG of some sort and they said everything seems normal. Seems like my heart's beating the way it should and everything so they made it seem like it wasn't a heart issue. I didn't have a problem there everything seemed normal so I didn't really question anything based on what they said So they checked me out twice now. 

Fast forward. What I read from somebody was that if you have a constant ache that wouldn't necessarily be a heart problem because you would know if you had a heart problem. They said you would have a lot of pain all at once. Something would happen then you would get it straightened out and then it would go away.

What they basically said was that soreness all the time is something different They basically said if you're going to have a heart attack you would know it. It would come and then it would go. 

So now fast forward to a couple of days ago it felt like the back of my throat was sore and burning. Kind of like when you have bad heartburn after a long night of drinking and being hungover and I've had that happen to me a few times in the past and yesterday I pretty much puked up something and it tasted sour and it was making my throat burn.

I'm wondering if I have some type of acid reflux that's somewhat severe. 

I ate like three Tums yesterday, two at once and then one and I almost want to say I felt better for a while I even tried some baking soda and water.

Now I'm trying not to convince myself that I have a heart problem like I thought a few months back occasionally. I do wonder about that but each time they say no everything seems to be good.

Now I usually drink like two cups of hot coffee a day. I don't know if that could be contributing to acid reflux or drinking almost every weekend could be something. 

The only thing I could tell is my chest feels sore but it's in front of the bones of it on the left side. Not really behind it.  Now what a female friend told me. She said your heart is behind your ribs. It sounds like what you're feeling is in front of your ribs she says that that could be something else still unsure.

I feel like if I contact my doctor's office they will think I'm bothering them basically. 

I even got a letter from my state Health humane services saying that I should get checked out by a mental health specialist and I should probably sign up for mental health treatment I don't know if they suggested this due to the fact that I was in the hospital complaining several times in the last 6 months. 

I'm trying not to psych myself out to have to go to a doctor's office or a hospital or anything because I do understand that treatment cost a lot of money. Now like somebody else said If you don't feel good you go in. You get checked out that's what you're supposed to do. 

I just ate a couple fried empanadas got me wondering if I need to take a rolaid I just does feel a little sore. 

One other thing that some lady was telling me in a fast food restaurant was that they thought they had a problem with their heart and they got an EKG done. It was pretty expensive and they got checked out and they found out that they had some type of acid problem and I believe they said they ended up getting some prednisone whatever that is and apparently their problems straightened out. 

I guess they said it wasn't really an ulcer that it was bad acid. 

So if anyone's ever dealt with this problem before chime in",1,1748915762.0,DiagnoseMe,0,1.0,False

1l200wj,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/1l200wj/my_trick_for_mastering_the_mental_game_of_fasting/,My trick for mastering the mental game of fasting,"I‚Äôve been trying to build mental strength during fasting, doing IF 16:8, and sometimes the food noise is unbearable, and I get that what my mind and my stomach want are sometimes different thing. So lately I‚Äôve found a method that helps me push through the hunger, especially in the morning:

By 9:30am, I usually start to feel hungry. But instead of giving in, I tell myself: ""Okay, let‚Äôs just make it to 10am. We can eat then if we really want to.""  
10am comes, I drink some water, distract myself with work, maybe chat with a coworker. Do anything, and like I'm on reddit right now.

Next thing I know, it‚Äôs 10:30.  
Then I'll tell myself again: ""Let‚Äôs try to make it to 11am. Just 30 minutes no biggie""  
At 11am, another pep talk: ""Okay‚Ä¶ just 1 more hour. Lunch is so close, it‚Äôs basically nothing. We can totally pull through.""

Before I know it, I‚Äôve hit my fasting goal by 12pm.  
It‚Äôs about training the mind, with a side of gaslighting myself and realizing I‚Äôm stronger than what my stomach makes me feel.

TLDR: Break your fast down into tiny mental checkpoints instead of one giant stretch. Make promises to your stomach that you keep extending, not breaking. And water, water, water!! (or tea/coffee up to you)

I started my day by making myself some coffee, and freshening up, taking my online paleontology, or rather prehistory, and watching tv. a few hours after, I took my daily jog, but this time, I decided to go further this time to spice up my day, and I went to a place that had more vegetation.

By the time I got back, it was nighttime. ""I swear I wasn't gone for that long,"" I thought to myself, but I didn't think anything more of it. 

I should have.

I noticed slightly different things around my house, such as grass being a bit taller than it should have since I recently cut it yesterday. I told myself ""Boy! that grass can grow,"" though I still felt something was off. 

Over the next few days, I noticed serval other things. The vegetation thicker, certain things seemingly disappearing day by day, and soon it began to become something I couldn't ignore, but something I couldn't stop. Nobody noticed, nobody believed me. I went to my neighbor, and I told him ""I... I don't know what's happening but, things are disappearing, they're... They're-"" 
He stopped me. An old man in his 70s and stuck to his ways, of course he wouldn't believe me. ""Young man, young man, would you calm down? Perhaps it was a dream? They can sometimes feel very very real.""

He'd never believe me. Nobody believes me.
I couldn't stop it, and the days passed on.

And one day...
Everything was gone... Everything except for my house.
The whole neighborhood was overrun by vegetation I have never seen before. It looked... Unreal.
But that's when I remember something, something looked familiar, ""I knew that plant from my class, it can't possibly be-"" before it hit me like a train.

I looked up at the prehistoric canopy taller than any redwood. 
Everything is different, the air is thick with oxygen, and it's almost alien...

Stay tuned for part 2!!

I‚Äôm a little conflicted with this one because while I enjoyed my overall experience, I found some game design choices became tedious towards the end. It was one of those games where my love for it turned sour the longer it overstayed its welcome. While Remedy accomplished a lot and it‚Äôs a decent survival horror experience, I wouldn‚Äôt say it was my favorite - there were too many moments playing as Alan where I felt like things were dragging on, and too many moments with Saga where I felt like the Mind Place was taking up too much time. 

The story itself is exceptional - it‚Äôs an interesting take on meta narratives and how fiction can intersect and impact the real world. I like how the narrative embraces the thirteen year gap with the original game, using the time frame to really drive how long Alan has been trapped in the lake. A ton of games couldn‚Äôt get away with incorporating live action footage, but it works really well here to further establish the blurring of ‚Äúrealities‚Äù in the Wake/Control universe. It‚Äôs self-referential in a way where seeing Sam Lake star as himself isn‚Äôt the oddest thing going on; because what if we‚Äôre secretly talking to Alex Casey? It gets pretty trippy but it‚Äôs never too difficult to follow along with.

The characters really shine here: Casey makes for a great partner, Rose is all kinds of chaos, Mr Door is both charming and intimidating, the Koskela Bros brought a lot of life to the town, I adore Odin and Tor‚Äôs shenanigans, and my main dude >!Ahti!< is back at it again. I do wish Tim Breaker and Agent Esteves would‚Äôve been expanded upon (in the main story at least) but their roles in the narrative are good enough. Honorable mention to some minor characters such as the Bookers and Nightingale. 

Saga‚Äôs portion was solid. One might argue that her characterization was a bit too stoic, but I thought it worked fine for an FBI agent; her relationship with Logan kept me hooked. The moment to moment gameplay made for some real fun encounters with the Taken, it was well balanced with moments where the player could breathe and explore.  Bright Falls, Watery, and Cauldron Lake - they nailed the gloomy Washington aesthetic for sure. Something about a coffee themed amusement park shouldn‚Äôt work and yet it only reinforces how odd Bright Falls really is. I enjoyed the side activities as well, the nursery rhymes were especially fun to figure out because they paid off with lore that further ties the connected universe Remedy wants to create. 

Alan Wake‚Äôs portion was a mixed bag for me. I really love how they made him much more mature and personable as opposed to the original game where he could come off a bit static. I‚Äôm glad we got to explore the lore behind the Dark Place and how it connects back to Control. And New York was a really cool place to explore and I love how it feels so psychotic: the way the walls are covered in graffiti quoting things Alan wrote/said, going through a hallway in one building only for it to loop back to the same spot, the constant chattering of ‚ÄúWake‚Äù from the shadows, etc. The Poets Cinema and the Ocean View Hotel might‚Äôve been my favorite spots because they did a great job at showing how Alan can alter the world through writing.  

It‚Äôs the gameplay that held it back for me: I really didn‚Äôt enjoy the shadow monsters. I was hoping they‚Äôd be more of a challenge like some of the Taken were, but most of the time they‚Äôre easily avoidable. They made exploration feel eerie but I wouldn‚Äôt describe it as scary. 
I thought things were ramping up when I got to the >!‚ÄúWe Sing‚Äù!< chapter, but that was probably where combat peaked. Whereas Saga‚Äôs gameplay is akin to Resident Evil, Alan‚Äôs portion was much more like Silent Hill with an emphasis on his psyche. It‚Äôs by no means bad but I honestly felt so underwhelmed that I mostly stuck with Saga until I hit a point of no return with her. 

If I could also nitpick: this game is extremely ‚Äúchatty‚Äù for lack of better words. I kept thinking to myself, ‚Äúplease wrap this speech up‚Äù lol like damn Alan and Saga do not shut up. Going through all the profiling, the case board, the manuscripts, the radio, the TV shows, the additional character dialogue - it‚Äôs fine at first but at times it bogs down the pacing. It is a little funny imagining Saga spaced out in front of people while she‚Äôs trying to figure things out in her head. The game loop for piecing together the puzzle isn‚Äôt necessarily bad, it should‚Äôve been trimmed down at the least. The final chapter, for example, is mostly >!one big profiling,!<which I found pretty anti-climatic from a gameplay perspective. Here I am with every weapon unlocked and a stash full of gear, and what do I get to do? >!Put pictures on a wall.!<

I‚Äôm normally all for cryptic dialogue too, I get the tone the developers were going for, but seemingly everyone speaks in riddles and idk the pay off wasn‚Äôt always there. I love you Ahti but I have no clue what you just said to me. You could make a case that was intended, however. 
Stuff like the horror flash jumpscares became tiresome. You can change the intensity in options, but my real issue is that some of them felt like cheap ‚Äúhaha got you‚Äù moments. I guess I would‚Äôve rather seen the energy in real enemy encounters where I‚Äôm struggling to survive with one battery and half a magazine. 

The autosave also sucks - don‚Äôt rely on it, use the thermos as often as you can.

So, in the spirit of IGN, I‚Äôm giving it a 7/10 for having too much water. All you had to do was stay away from the damn lake Saga! Jk I‚Äôm leaning towards a B+, I would still recommend it but keep your expectations tempered and maybe try jumping between characters every couple chapters or so.

1l1zv4l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christians/comments/1l1zv4l/inlaw_relationships/,In-Law Relationships,"I've come to this corner of the internet to get feedback on relationships I cannot seem to navigate well.  I've sought advice from an older woman who is a strong believer and she gave great wisdom.  Curious what others out there in the world would do.

I (38 yr old female) am married to a second born son (38 yr old). My husband comes from a family of four siblings.  Female, male, male, male is the birth order.  We've been married 9 years and dated for 2 so I've been a part of my in-law family for over ten years.  I am a part of a close family (mom, dad, sister who also has kids).  I have a lot of healthy female friendships, some are new, some a few years in, and a handful of 20 yr old friendships.

My SIL#1 is husband's sister, 41 yrs old and married.  No kids. Lives 1 mile away.  
My SIL #2 is married to husband's next youngest brother. She's 32 yrs old. 3 kids. Lives 4 hours away.

I have tried so many things over the years to try to have relationships with these women.  I have asked to coffee dates, invited to dinner,  given a baby shower,  hosted a fostering a kid shower, etc.  I kept SIL#2 first kid for a week when they traveled across country.  We've visited SIL#2 and family for a weekend since they live so far away.  So I feel as though I have done my part in initiating, inviting, and saying yes when they ask for help.

SIL#1 does not try at all to be a part of my, my husband or my kid's life.  She lives so close to us but we never hear or see from her.  We used to invite her over to do stuff with us but she kept saying no.  Or it would be a ""I'm going to walk by your house so the boys can wave hi, but I can't stay"".  She is a very independant, work 60 hour a week type of person so I understand her schedule is full.  But her actions toward me are strange.

SIL#1 planned a baby shower for SIL#2 second child.....told me she forgot to invite me (3 days before the shower) and said she figured I wasn't going to come anyway because I was very pregnant.  Also told me during a conversation, that I ""never leave my house and don't know how to make friends."" (Not the truth!! I have a huge village of friends).  She did not introduce us to her now husband until they dated for almost a year....she told us a few years prior she never wanted her family to scare her boyfriends away.

SIL#2 has three little kids and her plate is full too.  She is a very nice person with a great personality.  We seem to have a lot in common since we both have kids and want to educate our kids in the same manner.  But boy do I get the cold shoulder from her when not in person.  When SIL#2 and family come into town, they stay at SIL#1 house.  I've invited her and her kids to come over/go out to do things in town when they are here and she will either not respond to my texts or say everything but no if I ask in person.  When they come into town, they do not try at all to spend time with me and my family.   When they were here last Thanksgiving, I hosted dinner.  Cooked all day.  SIL#1 and SIL#2 went jogging, for a coffee date and a grocery store together.  No can we help you or do you want to come with us? Sent her kids Christmas gifts in the mail.  No thank you.

On one hand, my husband doesn't seem to be that offended about it because it's similar to how it was growing up.  But on the other hand, he also thinks it's strange and immature.

The tipping points for me have happened over the past few months:

My name was left out of the annual sibling name draw for Christmas gift exchange.  SIL#1 and SIL#2 coordinated the name draw.  After all the gifts were exchanged, I gave SIL#2 her gift because SIL#1 told me that's who I had.  SIL#2 had already received a gift from SIL#1.  They were both so confused as to why I gave SIL#2 a gift. And were equally shocked that I didn't get a gift!  SIL#1 cleared up the confusion and said they drew my name to give SIL#2 a gift and she said ""I got a gift from her last year....let's switch it up"".  So they crossed my name off the list, put SIL#1 in that place and didn't realized they forgot to put my name back in the pot.  But SIL#1 forgot about all that and told me to buy SIL#2 a gift.  Oh and SIL#2 complained about my gift in front of me to her husband.  I don't care about the gift.  The poor attitudes were the problem.

My husband was in the ER two weeks ago.  Their mom sent a group text to notify the siblings.  Not one of them called or texted my husband to check on him.

I was in a wreck last year also in the ER.  Not one of them called or texted to check on me.  They later said they had no idea my wreck injury was that bad.  Do I have to be in a coma for them to care?!

Called SIL#2 to wish my niece happy birthday today.  No answer.  Texted me later and said her daughter was napping and then they were out and about.  No time within an 8 hour window to call back.

I could go on and on about other times that I've felt offended but that's the gist.  I've tried to go through the years of this behavior and stay strong.  Have boundaries but also try to make an effort at a relationship.

This is mostly an outlet to get this off my chest to random strangers on the internet.  I'm prepared to read whatever comments come my way. I'm stuck in this cycle of only seeing this as un-healthy and maybe I need to be told to grow up and get over it!!!

I feel forgotten.  I feel not wanted.  I feel pushed aside.  I haven't had a conversation about this with them.  I don't even know how to have it without it seeming like a blame game.

What would you do?  Stop sending happy birthday texts?  Stop showing up to holiday gatherings?  Remove myself from the family group chat?  How do you have boundaries when the interaction is already so minimal but always comes across as so hurtful.",2,1748915132.0,Christians,0,1.0,False

1l1zuxn,https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkred/comments/1l1zuxn/exceptionally_blunt_reviews_for_your_rockerboy/,Exceptionally Blunt Reviews For Your Rockerboy Character's Music,"Trevor Nadroj is a musical reviewer at N54 News. He considers himself quite erudite (this is a guy who has the entire back catalog of NPR's *All Things Considered* on vinyl), and everyone else considers him a gigantic pain in the ass. Ergo, his editor has been punishing him over the last decade by making him listen to and review punk rock acts. 

Curiously, Mr. Nadroj has something of a musical Cassandra's curse: bands he reviews negatively tend to go viral not long after. In fact, the more negative he is, the bigger the viral sensation. Several musical talent scouts have developed an interest in keeping Mr. Nadroj employed by funding N54 with subscriptions to large organizations, paid for by their labels. 

Mr. Nadroj, of course, hates this with the burning passion of a thousand suns. 

So what did the unfortunate Mr. Nadroj have to say about your rockerboy's music? Let's find out!

1. ""This act bills itself as being at the forefront of musical innovation. I would agree - with the caveat that they are innovating in the wrong direction. After 25 years reviewing magic at this paper, I genuinely never thought I would hear someone trying to make their record *worse,* but that is precisely what these fellows have done. 0 / 10 stars.""
2. ""These musicians seem to have learned that some players will use distortion. Unfortunately, they do not seem to have yet learned *why they do that.* Between the whipsawing from a clean vocal to a death metal growl, I rather thought the lead singer's throat would explode. The fact that it didn't made me want to buy them a Trauma Team subscription just in case. However, I'm currently using my money to buy my own Trauma Team subscription for when this music causes me an aneurysm. 2 / 10 stars; just listen to John Phillips Souza.""
3. ""Terrible signal-to-noise ratio, combined with equally poor hygiene. These poor bastards smell like they've just come off an ELO raid. 2 / 10 stars; take a shower, boys.""
4. ""This group has some cachet in the Edgerunning scene here in town, I understand. I'm glad, because clearly their musical career isn't going to work out. Have fun staying poor. 1 / 10 stars. Dear God, I need coffee.""
5. ""Something of a mixed bag. The music actually wasn't completely tone-deaf and it distinctly lacked that punk-rock feel of a bag of cats thrown in a piano. However, the lead singer addressed the crowd and called me out by name before telling me I could just 'straight up suck his dick.' 3/10 stars; kind of hot, and 50/50 about whether I'd take them up on that offer.""
6. ""It's entirely possible that I'm just old, but I remember when the style of music you did was enough to differentiate you on the music scene. Sadly, this is no longer that case, as exemplified by this act. Lacking in any and all legitimate musical talents, they've sadly fallen back on that tired old trope: screaming into a microphone while playing untuned instruments. I feel so bad for the sound technicians. 0 / 10 stars; take migraine medication before seeing in concert.""
7. ""I never thought I would hear a band that could be best described as 'what if a hedgehog was fucking a whale carcass but with amplifiers and screaming?' Truly awful stuff - 0 / 10 stars and please stop trying to make music. I hear MiliTech needs grunts - there's a career where screaming is rewarded!""
8. ""Like if you put three monkeys, chainsaws, and a live Maelstrom member in a confined space, then dosed them with Black Lace - that's the best description of this music I can come up with. I've genuinely never heard anything that bad before in my life. The fact that my sensor array is tuned to also include sounds beyond the normal range of human hearing in no way makes this better - those sounds made it much, much worse. 1 / 10 stars.""
9. ""Oh. My. God. Look, I shouldn't have to say this. I mean, I really shouldn't. But just so we're all on the same page: EXPLODING LIVE GRENADES ON STAGE DOES NOT COUNT AS 'INNOVATIVE PERCUSSIVE EXPERIMENTATION!' It counts as attempted murder, and I don't care who was trying to shoot the band when they did that!""
10. ""A work of absolute genius. I wept for 10 straight minutes after the opening song. They had to carry me to my car. I think this band really has the staying power to survive Night City, and become absolute legends in the musical space. Great work, everyone, and please keep it up!""

I met this guy over tinder the other day and we got a few drinks then went for a nice walk, sat on his rooftop with wine and talked, then went slept together and I slept over. I honestly didn‚Äôt think much of him and was kind of thinking about it as my rebound as I got out of relationship a month before this and was still healing. I had to leave super early in the morning due to having work at 7am the next day and accidentally left my Apple Watch. He had my number and sent me a picture of it letting me know he was keeping it safe. I then responded thanking him and asking when I could pick it up. He gave me a day, we settled on an estimate time (at night because we both worked that day) and it was set. Night comes and a few hours before he asks me if I had plans after and we agreed to hang out again instead of me just coming to pick it up. I was figuring he wanted round 2‚Ä¶. We hung out and talked a lot more, cuddled, watched a show together and it was actually really lovely. Yes, we had sex again but I think it was actually me initiating it and him going with it because why not. The night we hung out he actually mentioned that he didn‚Äôt plan to have sex because he was so tired, just wanted to hang out and I kinda was confused. He told me it was definitely a plus but didn‚Äôt expect it. I slept over that night too, we did skin care together in the morning, he made me coffee and then I left at like 9:00am. 

I was feeling a little confused on my car ride home because I was thinking to myself ‚Äúman wait a minute, do I have a crush on this man?‚Äù He was so polite and classy. His apartment so clean and stylish. He opened expensive ass wine for us both times I hung out. We cuddled and joked with each other a lot. He kept saying ‚Äúnext time‚Äù whenever we spoke about things. I decided to text him the day after asking for clarification on if he wanted to leave things where they were, have dinner with each other to further conversations, or move on with our lives just because I want to be so clear on if he just wants to fuck or not. Maybe I shouldn‚Äôt have texted this? He responded a few hours later ‚ÄúI enjoy hanging out with me - just want to take things slow and we can def find a day to get dinner soon :)‚Äù

???? I‚Äôm so overwhelmed because like I want to take things slow too but wasn‚Äôt expecting to have a crush on my hookup‚Ä¶. I responded the next day that‚Äôs maybe we could get dinner after my vacation (after like two weeks) because I‚Äôm trying to accept a new job and visit my sister and need time to think and fully heal before going on a proper date‚Ä¶.still no reply back.

1l1zoc5,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1l1zoc5/i_spent_1000_hours_researching_sleep_science/,I spent 1000+ hours researching sleep science - here's the exact system that fixed my insomnia in 30 days,"Six months ago, I was getting 3-4 hours of broken sleep every night, chugging energy drinks to function, and feeling like absolute garbage 24/7. I tried everything - melatonin, sleep apps, white noise, counting sheep - nothing worked.

Now I fall asleep within 10 minutes every night and wake up actually refreshed. This isn't about sleep hygiene tips you've heard before. It's about understanding how your circadian rhythm actually works and the exact 3-phase system I used to reprogram my sleep from scratch.

(I structured this with clear sections to make it easier to follow. TLDR at the bottom.)

**Why Your Sleep is Broken (The Science Part):**

* Your body has an internal clock called your circadian rhythm that controls when you feel sleepy and alert. This clock is controlled by light exposure, temperature changes, and meal timing.
* Here's the problem: Modern life has completely destroyed these natural signals. Bright screens at night confuse your brain into thinking it's daytime. Irregular meal times scramble your internal clock. Room temperature stays constant when it should drop at night.
* It's like trying to sleep while someone keeps flashing a strobe light and shaking you awake. Your body literally doesn't know when it's supposed to sleep anymore.
* The good news? Your circadian rhythm can be reset in about 2-3 weeks with the right approach. Your brain is designed to sleep well - you just need to give it the right signals.

**The 3-Phase Sleep Reset System:**

**Phase 1: Circadian Rhythm Reset (Days 1-10)**

* Before you can improve sleep quality, you need to reset your internal clock. Most people skip this and wonder why sleep tricks don't work. It's like trying to fix a broken clock by moving the hands instead of fixing the mechanism.
* Morning Light Protocol: Within 30 minutes of waking, I got 10-15 minutes of direct sunlight in my eyes (no sunglasses). This tells your brain it's officially daytime and starts a 14-16 hour countdown to natural sleepiness.
* On cloudy days, I used a 10,000 lux light therapy lamp for 20 minutes while having coffee. The key is consistency - same time every morning, no matter how tired you are.
* The 3-2-1 Rule: 3 hours before bed, no more food. 2 hours before bed, no more work or stressful activities. 1 hour before bed, no more screens.
* This gives your body time to process food, wind down mentally, and reduce blue light exposure that blocks melatonin production.
* Temperature Manipulation: I dropped my room temperature to 65-68¬∞F and took a hot shower 90 minutes before bed. The rapid temperature drop after the shower mimics your body's natural sleep signal.
* By day 7, I was falling asleep 20 minutes faster than before.

**Phase 2: Sleep Optimization (Days 11-20)**

* Now we focus on improving the actual quality of your sleep cycles. You can fall asleep quickly but still wake up tired if your sleep stages are messed up.
* The Caffeine Cutoff: I stopped all caffeine after 2 PM. Caffeine has a 6-hour half-life, meaning if you have coffee at 4 PM, half of it is still in your system at 10 PM blocking adenosine (the sleepy chemical).
* Alcohol Reality Check: I eliminated alcohol completely for these 10 days. Alcohol might make you drowsy, but it destroys your REM sleep and deep sleep stages. You fall asleep but don't get quality rest.
* The Sleep Environment Fortress: Blackout curtains, eye mask, earplugs, and a white noise machine. Your bedroom should be a sensory isolation chamber. Even small amounts of light or noise can fragment your sleep without you realizing it.
* Strategic Napping: If I was exhausted, I'd take a 20-minute power nap before 3 PM. Longer naps or late naps steal sleep pressure from nighttime.
* By day 15, I was sleeping through the night consistently and waking up less groggy.

**Phase 3: Sleep Debt Recovery & Maintenance (Days 21-30)**

* The final phase is about paying back your sleep debt and creating a sustainable system for long-term quality sleep.
* Sleep Debt Calculation: For every hour of sleep you're short, you accumulate sleep debt. If you need 8 hours but get 6, that's 2 hours of debt that compounds daily.
* I calculated I had about 50+ hours of sleep debt built up. You can't pay this back in one weekend - it takes weeks of consistent quality sleep.
* The Consistency Protocol: Same bedtime and wake time every single day, including weekends. Your circadian rhythm doesn't understand ""weekends"" - irregular sleep times confuse your internal clock.
* Progressive Sleep Extension: I gradually moved my bedtime earlier by 15 minutes every 3 days until I was getting my optimal 7.5-8 hours. Sudden changes don't stick.
* Morning Routine Lock-in: Created a 30-minute morning routine (sunlight, water, light movement) that signaled to my body that sleep time was officially over.
* Around day 25, something clicked. I started waking up naturally 5 minutes before my alarm, feeling actually refreshed instead of like I'd been hit by a truck.

**What Actually Works vs. What's Popular:**

Most sleep advice is garbage because it treats symptoms instead of root causes. Sleep apps don't work if your circadian rhythm is broken. Melatonin doesn't work if you're getting light exposure at the wrong times.

What works is systematically resetting your internal clock, optimizing your sleep environment, and gradually paying back sleep debt while maintaining consistency.

Melatonin can be useful during Phase 1 to help reset your rhythm, but it's not a long-term solution. Use 0.5-1mg (not the 5-10mg most people take) about 2 hours before desired bedtime.

**Common Mistakes That Ruin Progress**

* Weekend Sleep-ins: Sleeping until noon on Saturday destroys a week of progress. Your circadian rhythm needs consistency more than extra sleep.
* All-or-Nothing Thinking: One bad night doesn't mean you've failed. Sleep improvement is a trend, not perfect every single night.
* Ignoring Light Exposure: You can do everything else right, but if you're staring at bright screens until bedtime, you'll still struggle.
* Trying to ""Catch Up"" with Long Naps: This steals sleep pressure from nighttime and perpetuates the cycle.

**The Results After 30 Days**

I now fall asleep within 10 minutes every night. I wake up naturally feeling refreshed instead of hitting snooze 5 times. My energy levels are stable throughout the day without caffeine crashes.

More importantly, I understand how my sleep system works and can adjust when life throws curveballs (travel, stress, schedule changes).

Good sleep is bout working with your biology instead of against it.

**TLDR:**

* The Problem is Biological, Not Behavioral: Your circadian rhythm (internal clock) controls sleep timing through light exposure, temperature changes, and meal timing. Modern life has destroyed these natural signals with bright screens at night, irregular schedules, and constant room temperatures. The solution isn't sleep hygiene tips but systematically resetting your internal clock by giving your brain the right biological signals. Most sleep problems are circadian rhythm disorders, not insomnia, which is why traditional sleep advice often fails.
* Phase 1: Reset Your Internal Clock (Days 1-10): Get 10-15 minutes of morning sunlight within 30 minutes of waking to start your natural sleepiness countdown. Follow the 3-2-1 rule: no food 3 hours before bed, no work 2 hours before bed, no screens 1 hour before bed. Drop room temperature to 65-68¬∞F and take a hot shower 90 minutes before bed to mimic your body's natural temperature drop. These signals tell your brain when it's actually time to sleep. By day 7, most people fall asleep 20 minutes faster through circadian reset alone.
* Phase 2: Optimize Sleep Quality (Days 11-20): Cut all caffeine after 2 PM since it has a 6-hour half-life that blocks adenosine (sleepy chemical). Eliminate alcohol completely as it destroys REM and deep sleep stages even though it makes you drowsy initially. Create a sensory isolation chamber bedroom with blackout curtains, eye mask, earplugs, and white noise. Limit naps to 20 minutes before 3 PM to preserve nighttime sleep pressure. By day 15, you should sleep through the night consistently with less morning grogginess.
* Phase 3: Pay Back Sleep Debt & Lock in Consistency (Days 21-30): Calculate your accumulated sleep debt (every hour short compounds daily) and gradually extend bedtime by 15 minutes every 3 days until reaching optimal 7.5-8 hours. Maintain identical bedtime and wake time every day including weekends since your circadian rhythm doesn't understand weekends. Create a consistent 30-minute morning routine to signal sleep time is officially over. Around day 25, most people start waking naturally before their alarm feeling genuinely refreshed.
* Long-term Success Principles: Sleep improvement is about working with your biology, not against it through willpower or perfect conditions. Common mistakes include weekend sleep-ins that destroy weekly progress, all-or-nothing thinking after one bad night, ignoring light exposure timing, and trying to catch up with long naps that steal nighttime sleep pressure. Melatonin can help during the reset phase (use 0.5-1mg, not 5-10mg) but isn't a long-term solution. Good sleep is a biological system that can be optimized through consistent signals, not a personality trait you're born with or without.

1l1zobr,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1l1zobr/officer_darnell_inetstca_part_3/,Officer Darnell | (INETSTCA Part 3),"My head is still spinning from Victoria‚Äôs note. Did Mr. Walker really have something to do with Sarah‚Äôs disappearance that night?

If you're not caught up with what I've been going through, please read the first two parts, [""I Never Expected To See That Camera Again.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1kvzu1r/i_never_expected_to_see_that_camera_again/) and [""Blue Eyes (INETSTCA Part 2)""](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1kxayyh/blue_eyes_inetstca_part_2/)

It had to be a coincidence. Just because someone has blue eyes doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean anything. I can think of 3 other people in this town with blue eyes right now. Hell, even my dad had blue eyes, at least from what I could remember about him.

The more I read those journals, the more memories returned. My mind was like an old wooden chest and someone had just blown off the dust and cracked it open. Part of me felt like I had been drifting on auto-pilot for the last 17 years of my life.

School. Home. Friends.

Move out. More School. Less Friends.

Work. Home. Even Less Friends.

More Work. Less Home. No Friends.

I wasn‚Äôt the only one, of course. I think it‚Äôs pretty normal to find yourself in a routine. One look online and you‚Äôd see a lot of people I grew up with that were the same way. Everyone drifts apart eventually. As trivial as it might be to boil it all down to ‚Äújust growing up‚Äù, it really is just that sometimes. Life becomes less magical as the years pass. Theme Parks turn into long lines. Road Trips turn into long drives. And nights turn into darkness.

Part of you might be wondering why I didn‚Äôt mention Sarah‚Äôs return sooner. To be completely honest, it‚Äôs because it never felt like she did actually return ‚Äì at least not the Sarah I knew. She became cold and distant. I always just chalked it up to the fact that I had abandoned her that night. If I was in her position, I don‚Äôt know if I could have forgiven me either. The police called off their searches and considered this an open and shut case. A little girl snuck out of her parents‚Äô house and stayed with some friends for the weekend. It was easier to let them believe their version of events. No one wanted to hear about mysterious houses and blue-eyed strangers from an eleven-year-old who shouldn't have been in those woods in the first place.

The day Sarah first appeared in Mr. Walker‚Äôs class again was the last day she talked to me. I can remember it vividly now. I leaned over in my chair and whispered to her, ‚ÄúHey, where have you been? Are you okay?‚Äù I should have just started with something more along the lines of ‚ÄòI‚Äôm sorry for abandoning you in a mysterious house‚Äô, but I was too taken aback by her sudden apparition.

‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm fine. Thanks for asking.‚Äù She replied soullessly. Goddamn it, I could tell she was pissed.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre fine? Sarah, I haven‚Äôt seen you since that night at the-‚Äù I pleaded, but was interrupted by Mr. Walker‚Äôs booming voice entering the room.

‚ÄúOkay class! Today we‚Äôll be going over metamorphosis in caterpillars.‚Äù The class groaned. ‚ÄúAnd I know, I know. The word ‚Äúmetamorphosis‚Äù made about 70% of you immediately check out and start thinking about video games or cute boys and what not, but I promise it‚Äôs really interesting!‚Äù

Every detail came rushing back to me, right down to that fucking lesson in metamorphosis. Mr. Walker would never shut up about something called ‚Äúimaginal cells‚Äù. Sarah never acknowledged me after that, aside from the odd ‚ÄúHey‚Äù or ‚ÄúOh, hi‚Äù when I would engage her first.

I began to remember how stupid I was back then, convincing myself of every possibility beyond taking personal responsibility. *She must be jealous of Victoria*, I used to think. *Or maybe it‚Äôs the movies we make. My ideas were always clearly better and she must have hated me for that.* What the hell was wrong with me?

After shaking off the previous entry, I continued to read through my journals into the early morning. The entries before the day Sarah disappeared weren‚Äôt very helpful. They essentially covered everything I had already come to remember from watching our recordings. I made it all the way up to that day she mysteriously came back. I could tell from my handwriting that I was overwhelmed and frantic ‚Äì writing about how immature and unfair she was being. I turned the page and was met with the jagged edges of paper where my final entry had previously been.

Someone had ripped it out.

I could hear my mom coming down the stairs around 7 am. I didn‚Äôt want her to see that I had been up all night obsessively reading through my memories. I jammed the journals underneath the couch and pushed the side of my head against the pillow, pretending to be fast asleep. After a brief breakfast of french toast and coffee with her and Lily-Ann, I told them I wanted to take a look around town for nostalgia‚Äôs sake. I could tell my mother was disappointed by this, most likely hoping we‚Äôd spend the entire day together. I promised her that I would be back in time for us to get lunch at our favorite diner, Gem‚Äôs.

‚Äú12 o‚Äôclock and no later okay?‚Äù The way she said it sent me back 20 years. I felt like a little kid again.

‚ÄúNo problem, mom. I‚Äôll be there.‚Äù I snatched my coat off of the hook behind the door, and made my way outside. I checked the time on my phone and it was 10 am. Plenty of time for me to investigate the old house and return in time for lunch.

It had been a while but, if I remembered correctly, the abandoned house was somewhere rather deep in the woods behind my mom‚Äôs home. I chose to walk about a block up the street before cutting across a small grass field. Immediately walking into the woods behind my old house probably would‚Äôve raised some flags for my mom and Lily-Ann.

Sometimes I forget how much bigger the world seemed when I was 10 years old. The walk to that old house was much shorter than I anticipated. The treeline was rather thick, but without the fog of youth I could tell it was only a stone‚Äôs throw away from the road.

As I approached the brooding exterior of the house, something inside of me stirred. Literally. It felt as though the bones underneath my skin shifted an inch to the right clockwise, pulling my flesh along with it. I let out a small grunt before catching myself from being too loud. I still don‚Äôt know if anyone, or anything, was in that house. I looked down at my hands when the sensation ceased, expecting to see a mangled version of my limbs but I appeared totally fine.

I‚Äôve had severe anxiety attacks before, especially when I was a lot younger, but nothing to this degree. I brushed it off the best I could with a deep breath and stepped toward the front door.

After at least 2 decades abandoned, I half expected this place to be in complete ruin. Yet, the exterior held up quite well over the years. The ivy grew strong, at least twice as tall as it was when I was a kid. The wood, while weathered, still held its integrity. It was better than my expectations‚Ä¶ but it still looked like absolute shit.

That is, until I stepped inside.

The old hinges protested as the front door slowly opened before me. That was when I saw it.

The most beautiful home decor that I had ever seen in my life.

It was astounding. Polished marble flooring with pristine white walls that rose around me, untouched by time. Gold and black accents scattered across the rooms in the form of lamps, end tables, pottery and statues. Where previously there had been dust covered chairs draped in foreboding white sheets, there was now beautiful leather couches and love seats. They all faced the fireplace, adorned with carvings that seemed too intricate for human hands.

Even with the windows boarded up, the sunlight cascaded through cracks bouncing off of the impeccably clean floors, blooming light through the entire house.

The light found its way up the staircase. While the stairs and railings themselves were elegantly designed, the upstairs remained dark and decrepit, as though the house was mid-way through renovations. Tucked beneath the staircase, I noticed a door sitting slightly ajar. It had to be some sort of storage closet or basement entrance. Even in the dim light, I could make out a carving on the white door's surface‚Äîa gold cicada with its wings and legs spread in every direction.

The kitchen remained the darkest part of the house. I stepped closer and peered into its entrance. Even though it was the middle of the day and I was almost 30 years old, something about the thought of that ‚Äòwindow‚Äô made a knot of dread form in my stomach. I didn‚Äôt think I would be able to handle it if I saw those blue eyes staring back at me when I turned the corner.

But sure enough‚Ä¶

I braced myself as I entered the only half-renovated kitchen. I kept my gaze toward the fridge and counter top, building up the courage to face it. I turned, and two bright pools of blue stared back at me. I froze. Every nerve ending in my body twisted and screamed for me to run. My fists tightened out of instinct, ready to defend myself from whatever was looking directly through me. The figure stayed completely still. Too still.

After a few seconds had passed I felt the breath in my lungs return. I was about to run for the exit when I noticed the figure still hadn‚Äôt moved, nor did its gaze. It was looking at me the same way the Mona Lisa would, as if its always staring ‚Äútoward‚Äù you but not quite ‚Äúat‚Äù you. I built up the courage to step closer and as I did my eyes adjusted to the darkness.

It *was* a painting. But how was that possible? I know what I saw in that recording and I know what Sarah said that night. I reached forward and sure enough, my hand touched glass. It was like one of those paintings you‚Äôd see in a cheap motel or a museum, covered by a pane of glass so the guests couldn‚Äôt destroy it. *Was it just an optical illusion from the light reflecting off of it?* I thought to myself.

As I studied the room further, something struck me‚Äîthe wall holding the painting was interior, with no outside access at all.

That was when the floorboards above me creaked. The upstairs remained a horrifying mystery in my mind. I felt compelled to go up.

As I walked upstairs, the smell that I had remembered all those years ago swept its way into my nose, but it was far worse now. The stench of molded wood began to burn my nostrils. Essence of rot and decay overtook my senses. I instinctively brought my hand to my face, covering as many openings as I could. The second floor was coated in a thick layer of dust and debris. A far cry from what it looked like downstairs. A creak from down the hall echoed toward me.

It was in this moment that I realized I hadn‚Äôt brought a weapon with me. I had walked straight into the lion‚Äôs den without a whip or a chair. I searched my pockets for anything that could be used as self defense. I felt the outline of my keys and fished them out. I remembered an old technique my mom taught me in case something ever happened to me after school. I quickly spread out the keys and placed each one between my fingers. Gripping the key chain, my hand now resembled that of Freddy Krueger or Wolverine.

With a new found confidence in my ability to fight back, I moved down the hall. A steady tapping sound began to emerge.

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

A door on the right side of the hallway stood ajar. A light shined through the crack, creating a vortex of glistening dust that swirled with each step I took. The tapping grew closer.

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

I tightened my grip on the keys. Reaching my unequipped hand out, I pushed the door gently. More light bled into the hallway as suddenly, a shadow crept over me. Something blocking the window created a haunting silhouette against the glaring sunlight.

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*

It swayed back and forth as my eyes adjusted to the brightness. Finally I could make out what was causing the tapping sound. Blood. Blood dripped onto the floor steadily beneath the rocking figure.

It was an orange tabby, torn open viciously from neck to groin. Its eyes frozen in shock with it‚Äôs limbs laying dormant. My body couldn‚Äôt decide if I was more saddened or disgusted. Immediately rejecting the sight, I lurched against the door frame, throwing up the contents of my stomach. French Toast. The sickeningly sweet nature of my vomit felt like an ironic kick while I was already down.

I composed myself and looked back up at the disgusting omen. That was when I saw it. Something was protruding out of it‚Äôs mouth. Another memory card ‚Äì the same sized memory card that fit inside of my old camera.

It was meant for me. I just knew it.

The floorboards creaked loudly as I stepped toward it. I felt the cat‚Äôs jaw slightly unhinge as I pulled the memory card from it‚Äôs mouth. The sight and awful squelching sound of it made me retch.

‚ÄúWhat kind of sick fuck would do this?‚Äù I whispered to myself.

A voice replied from the doorway.

‚ÄúExactly what I was wondering‚Ä¶‚Äù a stern deep voice boomed.

I looked to my left and was greeted with the barrel of a 9mm pistol pointed directly at me. A golden badge shined against the incoming streaks of light. A burly black man stood glaring at me through a pair of dark Oakley knock-offs. His dark blue uniform fitted tightly against his rotund body, creating stress marks on the shoulders and above his belt.

‚ÄúPut your hands on your head immediately and get on the ground!‚Äù The tension in his voice grew.

I shoved the memory card into my pocket and did as he told. I didn‚Äôt know what to say but all I could blurt out was, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt do this. I promise.‚Äù

There was a moment of silence before it was broken by the cop‚Äôs voice again. ‚ÄúKasey? Is that you?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt know for a second if I should have been more scared or relieved.

I heard the sound of a click and braced myself for the impact of a bullet. I had just hoped it was in the head so it would be immediate. Instead, nothing happened. I looked over and saw the sound had come from the officer‚Äôs holster. He had placed the gun back on his belt.

‚ÄúHoly shit, Kasey, it‚Äôs me! Darnell!‚Äù His voice was now a pitch higher and more excitable.

It took a moment to recall, but that was when it hit me. Darnell was one of my classmates from E. Bird Elementary. In fact, he sat right in front of me in Mr. Walker‚Äôs classroom and was one of the only other people who gave me the time of day. We used to commiserate about how cruel everyone else could be in school.

‚ÄúDarnell? Oh my god, I haven‚Äôt seen you in almost‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚Äú17 years!‚Äù He interrupted, walking towards me with arms open. I embraced him and he continued, ‚ÄúOh man, I can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre actually back. This is amazing.‚Äù

We giggled awkwardly as the hug ended, unsure of what to say as both of our gazes returned to the unfortunate feline.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck happened here, Kasey? I got reports of a random person going through backyards and followed your trail here‚Ä¶‚Äù He shot me an accusing and concerned eye, ‚ÄúPlease tell me you didn‚Äôt do this.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo! I swear, I just showed up about 30 minutes ago and the cat was already like this.‚Äù I sounded frantic, but I knew it was the truth. Mentioning the time made me remember the promise I had made to my mom. I pulled out my phone to check the time. 11:55 am. *Fuck. The Diner.*

Darnell stared at me for a moment. His thick black glasses made it near impossible to read his emotions. He let out a brief sigh before reaching for his radio‚Äôs microphone and cupping it in his hands, ‚ÄúUnit 23 to dispatch, I investigated the complaint at the old Whitaker house. It was just some kids messing around. I sent them home with a warning. No further action required.‚Äù

The mention of the name Whitaker stopped me‚Ä¶ that was *my* last name.

A calm woman‚Äôs voice came through the receiver, ‚Äú10-4, Unit 23. You‚Äôre clear and available.‚Äù

Darnell looked back up at me with a smile of relief, ‚ÄúThe kids around here have been really escalating their stupid pranks lately. I honestly didn‚Äôt think they‚Äôd go this far.‚Äù He gestured toward the tabby. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry you had to see this. Especially at your dad‚Äôs old place.‚Äù

I was still in shock, ‚ÄúMy.. dad?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, you know. The place your dad grew up with all the other kids?‚Äù He said every word as if he was waiting for me to jump in, but I had no idea what he was talking about. I think he saw the look on my face, his facade shifted.

‚ÄúSorry Kasey, maybe your family never told you. That‚Äôs not my business. Forget I said anything.. Do you need a ride back home to your mom‚Äôs? I‚Äôll have someone come out and clean this up later.‚Äù

I hated the idea of ending the conversation here, but two things stopped me. One, I need to get to the diner as quickly as possible before I felt the wrath of my mother. And two, he had a gun.

‚ÄúThe Gem Diner‚Ä¶ please.‚Äù I muttered.

We both hopped into his cruiser and within moments had pulled up to the diner. I finally got to experience the perks of using police sirens in traffic.

I stepped out of the vehicle in front of Gem‚Äôs, expressing my thanks to Darnell as he shouted from the driver‚Äôs seat, ‚ÄúJust stay out of trouble Kasey, you hear?‚Äù

I looked back at him to wave goodbye as he lowered his sunglasses.

His eyes met mine.

His beautiful, lightning blue eyes, met mine. I froze.

He lifted his glasses with a smile and drove away.",1,1748914580.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

1l1zkyi,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l1zkyi/i_watched_a_film_in_my_dreams_now_reality_is/,"I Watched a Film in My Dreams, Now Reality is Changing.","It happened again last night. I saw the film‚Äîthe one that only plays when I‚Äôm asleep. This was the third time this week. I wish I could tell you it was just another weird dream, some fleeting nonsense my tired brain conjured up. But every time I wake up after watching it, something in my real life is‚Ä¶ different. And not in a small way either. At first I thought I was losing my mind, misremembering things. Now I‚Äôm certain it‚Äôs the film that‚Äôs changing everything around me, piece by piece.

The first time I dreamed of the film, I didn‚Äôt realize what I‚Äôd seen. I woke up with only hazy images in my mind: a dimly lit, mostly empty movie theater; dust dancing in the projector beam that cut through the darkness; a musical score playing faintly (something classical, almost a lullaby); and a feeling of quiet dread hanging in the air like a fog. I brushed it off as an ordinary dream, albeit a vivid one. That morning, I was groggy but nothing felt out of place‚Äîat least not until I left my apartment and noticed the old willow tree outside was gone.

I stood on the sidewalk, staring at the patch of dirt where the willow had been. It was a mature tree, easily forty feet tall, one that had stood outside the building for as long as I could remember. Now there was just raw earth and a few stray roots poking up like exposed nerves. I even pressed my hand to the kitchen window, half expecting to feel the familiar rough trunk through the glass. Nothing. The tree had vanished without a trace overnight.

My first thought was that the city must have come with a crew at dawn, removed the tree due to disease or old age. It was early, the sun barely up, and maybe I had just slept through chainsaws and machinery somehow. I asked my neighbor about it later that day, but she looked at me like I was crazy. ‚ÄúWhat tree?‚Äù she replied. The huge willow right outside, I insisted. She pursed her lips and told me she‚Äôd lived in this building five years and there had never been a willow tree there. I laughed it off, confused. Maybe I had dreamed the tree, too? Or maybe she was messing with me. I even googled old street photos, only to find images with no willow in front of the building at all. It made no sense. I knew that tree. I‚Äôd stood under its shade last summer!

The second time it happened, I started to suspect something strange was going on. Two nights after the willow vanished, I had another dream of the film. I remember more of it this time. I was not just an observer in a theater‚ÄîI was in the film, or at least it felt that way. I was a kid, riding my old red bicycle down the hill on Mulberry Street where I grew up. In the dream, a dog darted out and I swerved. I felt the impact, the ground tearing into my skin. It was so visceral I jolted awake in a cold sweat, heart hammering in my chest.

My sheets were damp and twisted from my restless sleep. Still shaky, I swung my legs out of bed‚Äîand hissed in pain. A sharp, burning throb radiated from my right knee. Confused, I rolled up my pajama pant leg. There was a fresh scab stretching across my kneecap, raw and angry red, as if I‚Äôd wiped out on pavement. I stared at it, uncomprehending. I hadn‚Äôt hurt myself, not recently. But it looked exactly like the kind of scab a kid gets from a bad bike fall.

I hobbled to the bathroom and flipped on the light. In the mirror, I could see it better‚Äîa large scrape with bits of grit still embedded. Dried blood streaked down my shin. My stomach turned at the sight. How could this injury be real? I touched it gingerly and winced. It was real alright. I spent the next hour disinfecting it, my mind whirling. That morning I called my mom, half-laughing, half-nervous, to ask if I‚Äôd ever crashed my bike on Mulberry Street as a kid. There was a pause on the line. Then she chuckled, ‚ÄúOf course you did, honey. You still have the scar, don‚Äôt you? You were so brave, you got right back on that bike after the ER stitched you up.‚Äù

I felt cold all over as I hung up. I have no scar on my knee‚Äîat least, I never did before. But sure enough, after cleaning the wound I found the faint silvery line of an old scar under the fresh scrapes, a scar that had not been there yesterday. Memories I never had began to trickle in: the smell of the hospital, the itch of the stitches, a phantom ache when it rained. They felt real, but I knew they were new, like someone had edited my life and inserted this scene.

I spent the rest of that day double-checking my own memories against reality. I dug out an old photo album, hands trembling as I flipped through pages. Sure enough, there was a picture of ten-year-old me with a bandaged knee, grinning gap-toothed at the camera while my mother held up my crutches. The photo had never been in my album before‚ÄîI was certain. Yet there it was, physical proof of a childhood accident I never lived through until last night. I felt like I‚Äôd gone crazy. But the scab on my knee still stung, grounding me in the present. I had to accept that somehow the dream had reached out and altered the facts of my life.

I wanted to tell someone‚Äîmy best friend, Mark, or maybe my girlfriend, Elena‚Äîbut how could I explain any of this without sounding insane? ‚ÄúHey, do you remember that giant willow tree outside my place? No? Well, it was there yesterday.‚Äù Or, ‚ÄúDid you know I apparently almost lost my leg in fourth grade and just forgot about it for twenty years?‚Äù It was futile. Instead, I feigned a stomach bug and took the day off work. I spent hours pacing my apartment, chain-drinking black coffee to stay alert. I was terrified of what would happen if I fell asleep again.

By nightfall, my nerves were shot. I hadn‚Äôt slept properly in over 24 hours. Every time I blinked, I saw afterimages‚Äîperhaps from exhaustion, perhaps something else. Once, as I splashed cold water on my face, I swore I saw a flash of light on the bathroom wall behind me, as if a projector had come to life for a split second. There was no source, of course. Just my phone‚Äôs flashlight reflecting weirdly‚Ä¶ or my imagination. The shadows under my eyes looked like bruises. My head ached. Still, I refused to lie down. I would not dream, I told myself. If I didn‚Äôt dream, nothing would change.

But eventually, sometime around 3 a.m., I hit the wall. My body betrayed me. I remember sitting on the couch, the TV droning infomercials at low volume while I browsed forums for anything about ‚Äúdreams changing reality‚Äù. My eyes were so heavy. I blinked and suddenly the TV wasn‚Äôt on anymore‚Äîmy apartment was dark. The clock read 4:47 a.m. I had lost nearly two hours. A surge of panic brought me fully awake. I checked my phone‚Äôs camera roll, my messages, the front door lock‚Äîtrying to see if I had sleepwalked or done anything in that missing time. Everything was as I left it. Everything except for the fact that I had apparently fallen asleep sitting upright. And I had dreamed.

My heart was pounding. I tried to recall what I‚Äôd seen in the dream, but it slipped away like smoke. Only an uneasy feeling remained, a dread that something important had just happened on that screen. I needed to check on things. The apartment looked the same at first glance. The willow was still gone, my knee still bandaged. But something new was off‚ÄîI could feel it in my bones, a wrongness in the atmosphere. Dawn light was creeping in, so I threw on a jacket and decided to go see Mark. I needed to see a familiar face, to ground myself.

Mark lived two floors down. We hung out almost every other day‚Äîplaying video games, grabbing beers, complaining about work. He was my one constant through all of this. I knocked on his door, softly at first then harder. No answer. Odd; he was an early riser. After the third knock, the door across the hall cracked open. Old Mrs. Gomez peeked out, bleary-eyed. ‚ÄúWho are you looking for, dear?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúMark‚Ä¶ Mark Tillman. Did he go out?‚Äù I replied. She furrowed her gray brows. ‚ÄúNobody by that name lives on this floor. It‚Äôs just been me and the Nguyen family for years.‚Äù She must have noticed the color drain from my face because she added hastily, ‚ÄúMaybe your friend moved out?‚Äù

‚ÄúMoved out‚Ä¶right,‚Äù I mumbled, stumbling back. I knew Mark hadn‚Äôt moved. We were literally playing Fortnite together in his living room two nights ago. I fumbled for my phone and pulled up my contacts. Mark‚Äôs entry was gone. My text history with him‚Äîgone. Photos? I scrolled frantically through my camera roll. Every selfie, every group shot from parties and hikes‚ÄîMark was missing. In some, he was just‚Ä¶ not there at all, leaving a conspicuous gap. In others, a different acquaintance filled the spot‚Äîone of my coworkers, looking awkward in what should‚Äôve been Mark‚Äôs place. A cold wave of nausea hit me. Mark Tillman had been erased from my life.

I don‚Äôt remember stumbling back to my apartment, but suddenly I was there, slamming the door behind me and sliding down to the floor. I tried Elena next. My hands were shaking so badly I nearly dropped the phone. Her number was still in my contacts, thank god. It rang and rang. Just before it went to voicemail, she picked up. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Hello?‚Äù Her voice was groggy. It was 6 a.m. after all. ‚ÄúElena!‚Äù I gasped in relief. ‚ÄúOh my god, El, I‚Ä¶ something‚Äôs wrong. Mark is‚Äî‚Äù She cut me off, confused. ‚ÄúWho?‚Äù ‚ÄúMark, you know, my best friend.‚Äù There was a pause. ‚ÄúBabe‚Ä¶ you haven‚Äôt mentioned a ‚ÄòMark‚Äô in the year I‚Äôve known you. Are you sure you‚Äôre okay?‚Äù she asked quietly. ‚ÄúMaybe you should get some rest, you sound‚Ä¶‚Äù She trailed off.

I couldn‚Äôt even respond. I just thanked her for picking up and hung up abruptly, my head spinning. A year? Elena and I had been together three years, not one. But now that I thought about it, flashes of a ‚Äúnew‚Äù memory rose to the surface: meeting Elena at a Christmas party last year and hitting it off, when originally we‚Äôd met in college ages ago. The history of our relationship had changed, just like everything else. Mark was gone and in the void he left, my timeline shifted enough that even my relationship‚Äôs origin was different. I wanted to scream. Instead I just sat on the floor of my living room, surrounded by photo albums filled with holes and lies, trying not to lose my grip on reality entirely.

My eyes fell on the scattered pages of notes I‚Äôd written last night, the ones meant to document the original reality. They were still there on the coffee table, covered in my frantic handwriting. Proof that it all really happened‚Äîat least I remembered how things used to be. I clung to that for a moment, picking up a page at random and reading my own words: ‚ÄúMark Tillman - friend since college - now gone.‚Äù A bitter laugh escaped me. It felt like reading a eulogy for a person no one but me remembered.

At some point, adrenaline and terror gave way to a hollow numbness. I knew I couldn‚Äôt keep doing this alone. If I didn‚Äôt find answers, I‚Äôd lose myself. So I broke my rule and did the one thing you should never do when you‚Äôre questioning your sanity: I went online. Most results were useless‚Äînew age blogs about lucid dreaming or schizophrenic gibberish. But on a dusty corner of the internet, I found a thread in a paranormal forum from 2008. A user named FilmBuff99 had posted: ‚ÄúEvery night I watch a movie in my dreams. I think it‚Äôs changing things when I‚Äôm awake. No one believes me. Has this happened to anyone else?‚Äù There were only a few replies. The others mostly told him to seek therapy or joked that he was on drugs. The original poster never responded again after that initial post.

I stared at that screen until the words blurred. It was like reading my own thoughts. Had FilmBuff99 succumbed to the same thing? Did he vanish, or lose his mind, or worse? The thread was over a decade old‚ÄîI‚Äôd never find out what happened to that person. I shut my laptop when I realized my hands were trembling uncontrollably. I needed help. Professional help, maybe. If reality was unraveling, could a psychiatrist even do anything? Doubtful, but maybe they could at least drug me dreamless. It was a slim hope, but better than nothing.

Morning edged toward afternoon as I weighed my options. Finally, I caved and phoned a psychiatrist I used to see years ago for anxiety. I was lucky he picked up at all on a Saturday. I didn‚Äôt go into detail‚Äîjust blabbered that I hadn‚Äôt slept and was seeing things and needed help. My voice must have scared him because he agreed to squeeze me in over lunch.

Dr. Simons‚Äô office was cool and bright, all reassuring beige tones and soft music. I sat on the leather couch twisting my hands while he peered at me over his glasses. I couldn‚Äôt tell him the full truth, or I‚Äôd be locked up for sure. So I rambled about intense nightmares, stress at work, maybe a pending psychotic break. It wasn‚Äôt far from the truth, really. He listened patiently. In the end, he scribbled something on his prescription pad. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to give you something to help you rest,‚Äù he said slowly, as if talking to a spooked animal. ‚ÄúJust a mild sedative. Take it tonight, you‚Äôll get some sleep. We can regroup Monday and talk more then.‚Äù I nodded numbly and took the slip of paper.

I was both relieved and horrified. Relieved that he didn‚Äôt throw me into a padded cell on the spot‚Äîhorrified because he was essentially telling me to do the one thing I feared most: sleep. I stumbled out of his office with the prescription and a pamphlet on sleep hygiene, feeling like I‚Äôd signed my own death warrant. I didn‚Äôt fill it right away. Instead, I wandered the city in a daze as evening fell, dreading going home to another night. I found myself standing at one point in front of an old cinema downtown, its marquee blank and dusty as if no film had shown there in years. The sight made me shiver; I hurried on, pulling my jacket tight against a chill that wasn‚Äôt just the autumn air. All around me, people were wrapping up their normal days‚Äîhailing cabs, walking dogs, grabbing dinner. To them it was just a Saturday like any other. To me, it felt like the last day before the end of the world, and only I knew it.

Back at my apartment, I scribbled down everything I could remember about the original versions of my life‚Äîdetails about Mark, about the willow tree, the accident I never had. I was terrified those memories might fade or warp if I lost any more time. The act of writing steadied me a little. It was something concrete, proof that at least I remembered how things used to be.

Around 9 p.m., as I sat clutching the pill bottle with shaking hands, there was a knock at my door. I nearly jumped out of my skin. For a second my brain conjured the image of some shadowy film character come to take me away. But it was Elena, thank god. I opened the door and she stepped in, eyes full of worry. She said I hadn‚Äôt sounded like myself on the phone. I must have looked a wreck because she immediately pulled me into a hug. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre freezing,‚Äù she murmured, feeling my forehead. I realized I was shivering.

I wanted so badly to unload everything on her, to make her understand. But seeing her standing there in my living room, concerned and very real, I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to drag her into my nightmare. I just muttered that I hadn‚Äôt slept and that I‚Äôd had a panic attack. She glanced at the pages of frenzied notes I‚Äôd left on the coffee table. ‚ÄúIs this why you were asking about your friend earlier?‚Äù she asked gently. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I guess. I don‚Äôt know,‚Äù I said. She gave me a long, searching look, then picked up the pill bottle from my hand. ‚ÄúWhy haven‚Äôt you taken these?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm scared,‚Äù I admitted in a whisper. My eyes burned with exhausted tears I was too proud to shed. Elena‚Äôs face softened. ‚ÄúHey, it‚Äôs okay. You‚Äôre not going to feel better until you sleep.‚Äù She tapped two pills out, not just one. ‚ÄúTake these. I‚Äôll stay the night, watch some boring TV next to you. If you get any nightmares, I‚Äôll wake you, okay?‚Äù I wanted to protest that she couldn‚Äôt possibly wake me from this, but I had no fight left. Maybe it was the faint scent of her perfume or the steadiness of her voice, but I nodded. I swallowed the pills. She helped me to bed like I was an invalid.

The sedatives pulled me under in no time. Despite Elena‚Äôs presence beside me, I felt myself slipping into the familiar darkness of that dream world. This time, I found myself back in the old movie theater, the one from the very first dream. I was seated in the front row now, and the screen loomed huge and bright before me. There were no other patrons, no sound but the whir of the projector somewhere behind me. My body felt leaden; I couldn‚Äôt move from the seat.

On the screen, scenes from my life flickered. I saw myself as a boy blowing out birthday candles‚Äîonly I was alone, no family around the table. Cut to teenage me, sitting in an empty classroom, desks vacant. A jump cut‚ÄîI was older, standing in an aisle of blooming willow trees, row after row of them lining a street I didn‚Äôt recognize. The film jumped again, and I was watching a new scene: Elena walking past me on a city sidewalk as if I were a stranger, her eyes sliding over me with no recognition.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I tried to shout, but in the theater only a strained whisper escaped my lips. I struggled to move, to get out of that damned seat and stop this, but it was like being pinned by invisible weights. The projector light above me burned intensely. The scenes kept changing, faster now. I saw my mother younger, crying in a hospital waiting room‚Äîno, not crying, just sitting quietly as a doctor shook her hand. Through some impossible perspective, I saw into the doctor‚Äôs clipboard: a birth certificate with my name, and the word stillborn stamped in stark black letters.

I started sobbing, a raw animal sound. The film was wiping me out entirely‚Äîundoing my very birth. Image after image blazed by: an empty nursery with pale yellow walls, a little league team photo with one boy missing in the lineup, a high school graduation with an unfilled chair on stage. Then came adult life: office group pictures with a gap where I should be, holiday gatherings where my mom and dad posed as a childless couple. Each scene was a world where I wasn‚Äôt there, as if I‚Äôd been meticulously cut out of every frame of reality.

At last, the film sputtered. The screen went white with the final blinding flare of a projector reaching the end of its reel. In the sudden silence, I realized I could stand. I got up on shaky legs and turned around, desperate to confront the source of all this. Up in the projection booth window, I saw a shape‚Äîa human silhouette. My heart leapt into my throat. ‚ÄúWhy are you doing this?‚Äù I screamed, my voice echoing in the empty theater. The silhouette did not answer. It just cocked its head, as if studying me. Then it raised a hand in a small wave‚Ä¶ and switched off the projector.

Everything went dark.

I awoke to morning light and the sound of silence. The apartment was empty. Elena was gone‚Äîno imprint on the pillow, no note, nothing. For one blissful second I thought maybe she‚Äôd just stepped out for coffee. Then I noticed her overnight bag wasn‚Äôt there. Neither were the empty pill packets that had been on my nightstand. It was like she had never come at all. Dread coiled in my stomach as I got up and searched the apartment. Her presence had been wiped clean.

Hands trembling, I grabbed my phone and called Elena‚Äôs number. It rang and rang, and my heart lifted when she answered. ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù Her voice was cautious, like she gets with unknown callers. ‚ÄúElena!‚Äù I breathed. ‚ÄúThank god, you left, I was worried‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúWho is this?‚Äù she cut in. I stopped cold. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs me.‚Äù A pause. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, you must have the wrong number.‚Äù Her tone was polite, utterly unfamiliar. She hung up, leaving me listening to the dead line.

I sank into the couch in a daze. I think I knew what I‚Äôd find next, but I had to confirm. With a kind of morbid calm, I dialed my mother‚Äôs number. It went to voicemail‚Äîher cheerful voice asking callers to leave a message. I didn‚Äôt leave one. What could I say? Instead, I tried my dad‚Äôs old cell, the one he barely uses. He picked up on the third ring with a gruff, ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù

For a moment, I couldn‚Äôt find my voice. ‚ÄúDad?‚Äù I managed at last. ‚ÄúWho is this?‚Äù he replied. His tone held no recognition. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs me‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs your son,‚Äù I said, voice barely above a whisper. There was a long silence. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, you have the wrong number,‚Äù he said, awkwardly, like he wasn‚Äôt sure. My throat clenched. ‚ÄúDad, please.‚Äù I hated the pleading in my voice. The line stayed quiet for a long time. Then, softly, like he was speaking to someone else in the room, I heard him say: ‚ÄúMarianne, hang up. It‚Äôs some nutjob.‚Äù Marianne‚Äîmy mother‚Äôs name. The call disconnected.

They didn‚Äôt know me. My own parents. Whether I had never been born or somehow their memories were stolen, it hardly mattered. To them‚Äîand to the rest of the world‚ÄîI no longer exist. Only I remember the life I had, and even those memories are tenuous, like sand slipping through my fingers.

I‚Äôm writing this down‚Äîwhile I still can‚Äîin the hopes that maybe it will anchor me to reality, or that someone out there will read it and remember me, even when I‚Äôm gone. But I can feel it happening already: a numbness in my hands, a coldness creeping up through my bones. Like I‚Äôm fading. I don‚Äôt know what will happen when I finally fall asleep and there‚Äôs no one left to wake up. The film ended. The credits rolled. I think this story is over now‚Äîexcept I‚Äôm still here, caught in the final frame, waiting for the projector bulb to burn out.",5,1748914295.0,nosleep,1,0.86,False

Ecstatic to be writing this! As the saying goes, long-time lurker, first-time posting. As a precursor, my largest worry is that my description is too vague. Since it is the beginning of a series (yes, I know this makes it more rejectable), it follows a simpler plot, with our FMC trying to get back home but discovering much more that will pull her further into the overarching story later. 

  
Any advice is greatly appreciated! Adding the first 300 words as well! Also, looking for beta readers for an upcoming fourth draft, if anyone is interested :)

Dear \[Agent\],

All Kura Thornblade knows is survival.¬†

How to skin a buck. How to put food on the table for her brother. How to slather medicine on Ma's disfigured leg. Yet, Kura does not know what has been stalking her through her forest for the last week of autumn, her last chance to hunt before winter.¬†

The answer comes in the form of Ivor, a magnetic S√≠dhe who shifts into a dragon-like amphithere and boasts a wicked smile‚Äîand an even more wicked tendency to infuriate her. Thrust into a floating kingdom of immortal beings that forever chases the sun, Kura is forced with the reality that she is also S√≠dhe. Though that does not concern her‚Äîshe couldn't care less about the magic they call gifts and pointed ears. What does is that she must remain in the Kingdom of the Sun until her own gift manifests to satisfy a hundred-year-old mortal treaty. But Kura will do anything to return to her family before winter strikes. She will plot. She will lie. And she will fight.¬†

Yet, Kura is faced with too many questions, too many riddles from the new voice in her head, and one too many S√≠dhe that keep her away from them. Especially Ivor, who's been assigned to watch over her. On her quest to escape, Kura unearths a deadly secret only Ivor and a few S√≠dhe know‚Äî one that could plunge the kingdom back into war. Battling conflicting emotions while forming relationships with the princess and other warriors there, Kura must learn to trust in ways she has not been able to before to achieve her goals‚Äîold and new, before it is too late.¬†

With themes of found family and the cost of freedom, love and loss, *Beneath the Broken Skies* is a gripping introduction to a plotted trilogy. Readers who enjoy the intricate works of *Daughter of No Worlds* by Carissa Broadbent and the inner monologue of *Fourth Wing* by Rebecca Yarros, will delight in this 110,000 word New Adult Romantic Fantasy.¬†

I‚Äôm an avid coffee drinker, store manager, cat lover, and have a Bachelor's in Genetics and Genomics that does little more than hang on my wall. While I have many hobbies, reading and escaping into fantasy has always been my most cherished since my mother handed me a copy of *Magic Tree House*.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you. 

\--------------------------------------------------------------------

First three hundo:

I hate it.¬†

‚ÄòIt‚Äô can be defined by many things‚Äîthe townsfolk, Aiden, the crook in my neck that never seems to leave me be. But at this precise moment, it's this maddening crawl of needles over every inch of my skin. Of suspicion. Of eyes tracking my every movement as I track prey of my own. It‚Äôs been a couple of days since this insatiable itch started, this need to unmask what‚Äôs been stalking me. But every time I whip around, the silent autumn forest is the only thing to stare back. I‚Äôm sick of being the prey in this twisted game, but I don‚Äôt have the privilege of hiding in our cabin.¬†

Winter is almost here.

A raven flutters and squawks its eerie tone from above. My shoulders, already stiff from the morning‚Äôs chill, tense further.¬†

Unclasping the worn mahogany bow from my back, I settle its weight into the nook of my arm. Hunched over, I run two fingers over damp earth. The clear outline of the elk track underneath this oak is fresh‚Äîunbothered by wind, water, or insects. It must be close by.¬†

The roaring of the swelling river grows louder, its harsh growl piercing my frigid, aching ears.¬†

Following the tracks to my right, I pick my steps carefully to not accidentally reveal my location to my prey, nor to this faceless predator hunting me back. The transition of seasons continues to strangle life from what once was a lush green forest, leaving behind a rusty shade of red not unlike that of rabbit's blood after it seeps into soil.

I've danced this dance of flesh and blood and light footsteps seemingly a million times. Ma made sure to teach me how to hunt, how to keep us alive, since I was eight. I can still remember how eager I once was to pull the bowstring back. Ecstatic, when I finally convinced Ma to let me hunt alone. How stupid, how naive those feelings really were.

No time to breathe.
No space to just be.

So I started choosing me first even if it was just for five minutes.

A sip of coffee in silence.
A journal prompt.
A stretch.
A deep breath with my hand on my heart.
A simple reminder:
You are safe. You are not who you used to be. You can create peace even here.

And no, it doesn‚Äôt always look like a perfect routine.
Some mornings are chaotic. Some I hit snooze. Some, my babies need me before I get to pour into myself.
But I still try.

Because I‚Äôm not trying to control the day.
I‚Äôm trying to ground myself in it.
To show up as the version of me who is intentional, soft, and steady even when life isn‚Äôt.

A morning routine isn‚Äôt about productivity.
It‚Äôs about presence.
It‚Äôs about starting the day rooted in yourself not in stress, noise, or comparison.

Descendents plot: Harry x Ben

It had only been a few weeks since the barrier came down, and Ben was beyond stressed.

He had the help of his parents, sure ‚Äî their experience, their wisdom, their gentle nudges when he needed them ‚Äî but he was the king now. And kings didn‚Äôt get to tap out when things got complicated.

And things were *very* complicated.

Setting up a judicial system that could govern both Auradon citizens and former Isle residents was proving to be one of the most frustrating, mind-numbing, and emotionally taxing efforts he‚Äôd ever been a part of. Nothing about it was straightforward. Every law had to be examined, rewritten, or scrapped altogether. Justice meant something entirely different to those who‚Äôd grown up in privilege than it did to those who‚Äôd grown up locked behind a magical barrier.

Mal had tried her best to help, at least in the beginning. She sat in on meetings, offered insight, pushed back when things got too polished and political. But lately, she‚Äôd been caught up in her own world ‚Äî discovering herself in ways Ben suspected she‚Äôd never had the space to before. He couldn‚Äôt even bring himself to be heartbroken over the breakup. Not really. If anything, he was relieved to see her thriving, finding her own identity outside of who she was *supposed* to be.

He missed her, sure. But more than that, he was proud of her.

Uma, of all people, had stepped up in her absence. She wasn‚Äôt exactly known for playing nice, but she had a good head for structure ‚Äî and a bone-deep understanding of what fairness *really* looked like. She helped draft new laws, poked holes in the old ones, and offered sharp, often necessary critiques. Some of her crew had even been appointed to enforcement roles under the new system ‚Äî minus Gil, who was off with Jay exploring the seas on some months-long voyage that barely checked in with civilization.

It gave them something to do. A purpose. A place in a world that was still trying to figure out what to do with them.

The villains weren‚Äôt isolated on the island anymore, but it wasn‚Äôt full freedom either. House arrests were in place for many. Surveillance was tighter than ever. People were watching ‚Äî waiting for someone to mess up, waiting for Ben to slip. Every decision he made felt like it was being scrutinized from every angle. Every hour, the weight of it settled deeper into his spine.

Now, sitting at his desk, surrounded by stacks of legal documents, unfinished drafts, and half-drunk cups of cold coffee, he felt like his brain was turning to mush. His head was pounding, his eyes burned from reading too long, and even his crown felt heavier than usual.

He let out a breath and leaned back in his chair, eyes fluttering shut.

**Please,** he thought, a silent plea to whatever divine force might still be listening. **Just send me *something*. A distraction. Anything.**

As if summoned by that desperate thought, the palace guards shifted at the entrance to the room ‚Äî and a familiar, swaggering figure stepped into view.

Harry Hook.

Ben blinked, sitting upright slowly, confusion flickering in his eyes before he smoothed it into something more neutral. Of course it would be Harry. That pirate always had impeccable ‚Äî or infuriating ‚Äî timing.

He had the same cocky stride, the same glint in his eye, but there was something different about him now. Like he didn‚Äôt just want to belong here ‚Äî he *believed* he already did. And maybe he did. Maybe they all did, in their own way. But Ben couldn‚Äôt afford to let his guard down. Not yet. Not when so much was still fragile.

Still, he gave a small nod and gestured for the guards to let him through.

‚ÄúHarry,‚Äù Ben said, keeping his voice calm, composed. ‚ÄúTo what do I owe the pleasure?‚Äù

It had only been a few weeks since the barrier came down, but Harry Hook had already seen more polished tile and smug nobility than he cared to for the rest of his life.
Freedom, it turned out, came with a price ‚Äî endless rules, paperwork, and judgmental stares. Still, it was better than the Isle. Almost anything was. He‚Äôd spent his whole life on an island where survival meant loyalty, sharp blades, and even sharper smiles. Now? Now he was expected to blend in with princes and courtiers. Pretend he didn‚Äôt notice the guards watching him like he‚Äôd pocket the silverware at any moment.
Whatever. Let them look.
He hadn‚Äôt come to fit in. He‚Äôd come to be seen.
Uma was doing her part ‚Äî working closely with Ben, drafting laws, making herself useful. Harry respected that. Sort of. He‚Äôd never say it out loud, but seeing her be taken seriously by Auradon was... satisfying in its own way. Most of their crew had found something to do, too. Even Gil, off exploring with Jay like they were some kind of storybook pirates. Not that Harry missed him. Much.
Still, without Gil and without real purpose, Harry had been bored. Restless. And when Harry Hook got restless, trouble usually followed.
So today, he decided to wander ‚Äî or rather, saunter ‚Äî through the palace halls like he owned the place. The guards had stopped trying to intimidate him. It never worked. They let him through with a sigh and a side-eye, and Harry just grinned in return.
He knew exactly where Ben would be: buried under scrolls and stress, probably on the verge of collapsing into a puddle of good intentions and royal pressure.
The thought made him smirk.
By the time he stepped into the room, Ben looked like he hadn‚Äôt slept in days. Pale, tense, and surrounded by more parchment than a library fire sale. Harry tilted his head slightly, taking in the sight. The King of Auradon ‚Äî fraying at the edges.
There was a beat of silence before Ben finally looked up and waved him in.
‚ÄúHarry,‚Äù Ben said, steady but tired. ‚ÄúTo what do I owe the pleasure?‚Äù
Harry‚Äôs grin widened ‚Äî all charm and a hint of something sharper.
‚ÄúOh, y'know,‚Äù he drawled, stepping further into the room with a casual shrug. ‚ÄúThought I‚Äôd check in on our fearless king. You look like you could use a break... or maybe just someone more interestin‚Äô than paperwork.‚Äù",3,1748913858.0,Descendants,0,0.81,False

My VP office had suddenly been handed over to the new female intern by my husband Ryker Hampton.  
  
Later, she even posted photos of the office on Ins with the caption:  
  
\[Grateful for my dear CEO Mr. Hampton's reward!\]  
  
In the attached photos, the entire office layout carefully designed by me had been changed, and even more all my award plaques had mysteriously vanished.  
  
I forwarded it directly to Ryker:  
  
\[What exactly are you playing at? Why is an intern occupying MY personal office?\]  
  
He sent back a voice message, with a drunken tone: ""Babe, it's just an office. You're not using it anyway.""  
  
\[You have ten minutes to restore my office to its original condition.\]  
  
On the other end, Ryker didn't respond.  
  
Two minutes later, Hampton Industries' most critical contract was forcibly terminated.  
  
Since someone wanted to challenge my authority, I didn't mind letting Hampton Industries go BANKRUPT directly.  
  
\---  
  
The calls from Ryker kept pouring in, one after another. I didn't answer until the fifth one.  
  
His furious voice erupted through the speaker.  
  
""Mila! Have you lost your damn mind? That was a two hundred million dollar project!""  
  
""You know perfectly well the product launch is next week. Pulling the plug now is practically corporate suicide!""  
  
""All this over only an office? Are you serious?""  
  
Five years of marriage, and this was the first time he'd ever raised his voice at me over another woman.  
  
I took a small sip of my warm coffee, feeling the heat slide down my throat while my heart turned to ice.  
  
""Dead serious,"" I replied coolly.  
  
""Ryker, restore my office to exactly how it was before. Every single award, every item in its precise location. Otherwise, your company will suffer far greater losses.""  
  
On the other end, Ryker fell silent for several seconds.  
  
""You have five minutes. Starting now.""  
  
I delivered these words with cold precision before directly hanging up.  
  
Two minutes later, he sent photos of my restored office. Everything had been returned to its original place.  
  
Upon receiving the pictures, I immediately contacted the project manager and rescinded the termination order.  
  
But I sent Ryker a photo in return.  
  
In the image, his study had been completely emptied.  
  
Including his most prized possession‚Äîan expensive antique he'd just acquired at auction.  
  
I attached a second photo: the antique shattered into pieces across the floor.  
  
""Ryker, this is your punishment. You know my temperament. Don't let this happen again.""  
  
There was no response from his end.  
  
I knew he was furious. But I was even more so.  
  
Our marriage began as a strategic alliance between two corporations.  
  
Five years ago, he needed Sullivan Enterprises' overseas distribution channels, and I needed Hampton Industries' domestic manufacturing facilities. A business marriage was the logical conclusion.  
  
No passionate love story‚Äîjust a rational choice for mutual benefit.  
  
""Mila, we'll not only support each other in business, but after marriage, I promise to trust and respect you,"" Ryker had said, holding my hands, his gaze steady and sincere before our wedding.  
  
""I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Hampton. I hope our partnership proves fruitful,"" I'd responded with a measured smile.  
  
Over five years, we evolved from strangers to confidants, from respect to dependence, then to genuine warmth and affection.  
  
We'd shared countless nights huddled together after exhausting business functions.  
  
This year, we finally welcomed our baby.  
  
It was the perfect testament to our love, making me believe our love bond was unbreakable.  
  
But now, Brianna's appearance had shattered all the trust and understanding we'd built.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Ryker didn't come home that night.  
  
I knew he was expressing his anger and dissatisfaction through his absence.  
  
The next day, I left our son with the nanny and went straight to the office.  
  
The employees looked surprised when they saw me, quickly lowering their heads and greeting me respectfully.  
  
""Ms. Sullivan! Your postpartum recovery period isn't over yet. Should you be at home and have rest?"" the young receptionist asked with concern.  
  
""Just checking on things,"" I replied with a slight nod before heading straight to the executive floor.  
  
As the elevator doors opened, I heard laughter coming from Ryker's office.  
  
Through the half-open door, I saw Brianna sitting beside him.  
  
Ryker's eyes sparkled with amusement‚Äîa stark contrast to the cool demeanor he typically maintained with other assistants.  
  
Usually, except for me, he never allowed anyone to linger in his office, much less with such a tender expression on his face.  
  
But now, he was sitting incredibly close to Brianna, the two of them deep in animated conversation.  
  
Brianna was wearing a high-end designer outfit.  
  
The exact one I had been eyeing‚Äîthe one Ryker had promised to get for me.  
  
Not just expensive, it was a limited edition‚Äîonly five sets existed worldwide.  
  
And now it was on an female intern.  
  
I pushed the door open. Their laughter died instantly.  
  
The smile froze on Ryker's face.  
  
""What are you doing here?"" he asked.  
  
Brianna quickly stood up, plastering a respectful expression on her face while greeting me in a honeyed voice.  
  
""Ms. Sullivan! I heard you just had your baby. They say pregnancy changes a woman's figure, but wow, you've bounced back amazingly!""  
  
I scoffed, firing back: ""Since when is my figure any of your business? Which blind idiot hired someone with such poor manners?""  
  
Brianna's smile stiffened, her fingers fidgeting nervously.  
  
""Take off that outfit. Now.""  
  
The atmosphere in the office plummeted to sub-zero.  
  
Brianna's eyes widened, her lips trembling in disbelief.  
  
She turned to Ryker with a doe-eyed, tearful look of appeal.  
  
I also turned to Ryker, my gaze cold as ice.  
  
""Explain why MY clothes are on HER body.""  
  
Heard of that, Ryker's brow furrowed in irritation.  
  
""After yesterday's office incident, Brianna became the subject of office gossip. I was simply compensating her.""  
  
""It's just an outfit. I'll get you something better later.""  
  
""Compensation?"" I let out a cold laugh. ""This outfit might not be much to us, but it's still a globally limited edition haute couture piece. Who the hell is Brianna to wear something like this?""  
  
""Besides, yesterday's situation was her own fault for not knowing her place.""  
  
""Ryker, have you forgotten your position? Forgotten who I am? Who gave you permission to hand out my things?!""  
  
By the time I finished, Brianna was pale with fear, teary-eyed as she stammered:  
  
""I'm sorry, Ms. Sullivan, I didn't know it was yours...""  
  
""Now you do. Take it off immediately.""  
  
Seeing me cut Brianna off and refusing to back down, Ryker lost his patience.  
  
""Mila! Enough! We have a project meeting to get to. Stop making a scene!""  
  
My heart sank.  
  
He had never raised his voice at me in the office before, but now he was breaking that rule for Brianna.  
  
Beside him, Brianna visibly relaxed when she saw Ryker standing up for her.  
  
""Project? Which project?""  
  
""The collaboration with Grant Corp. Brianna and I were just about to leave.""  
  
Ryker adjusted his tie, his tone increasingly impatient.  
  
""Ms. Winters has been instrumental in this deal, so I'm taking her along for the negotiation.""  
  
I raised an eyebrow, my smile dripping with sarcasm. ""Oh? I wasn't aware an intern had such influence that she could sway public company decisions now.""  
  
Ryker's face darkened as he grabbed his briefcase and gestured for Brianna to follow.  
  
""Let's go. We're wasting time.""  
  
As they brushed past me, Brianna flashed me a smug smile, her eyes full of challenge.  
  
Well, Ryker, you brought this on yourself.  
  
Since you insist on defending Brianna, don't blame me for what comes next.  
  
After they left, I pulled out my phone and dialed the private number of Grant Corp's chairman.  
  
""Chairman Willis? This is Mila.""  
  
""About that collaboration Ryker is discussing today...""  
  
Chapter 3  
  
An hour later, Ryker called.  
  
He was absolutely livid, his voice thundering through the phone.  
  
""What the actual fuck, Mila?!""  
  
""Chairman Willis just publicly destroyed Brianna‚Äîcalled her my side piece, accused her of sleeping her way up the corporate ladder!""  
  
""Then he had the nerve to tell everyone that Sullivan Enterprises was built on YOUR back, and that I'm some ungrateful piece of shit taking advantage while you're on maternity leave to chase skirts! Said I forgot who put me where I am!""  
  
""You set this whole thing up, didn't you?!""  
  
I let out a cold laugh. ""Listen carefully, Ryker. I don't control what people think or say. The truth has a way of speaking for itself, and clearly others can see what you can't.""  
  
""Brianna left a sobbing mess, and the deal's dead. Happy now?""  
  
""Damn right I am. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.""  
  
After hanging up, the white-hot rage inside me cooled to a simmer.  
  
Later, my assistant Josh messaged that the Brianna's drama had spread like wildfire through the company.  
  
When she returned to the office, people were openly gossiping, pointing, whispering.  
  
Some colleagues didn't even bother to lower their voices as they called her an ambitious little snake with no talent who was trying to screw her way to the top.  
  
Everything on her desk had been dumped unceremoniously into the trash.  
  
Even as she broke down crying, blubbering ""You've got it all wrong"" and ""This isn't fair""‚Äînobody gave a shit about her excuses.  
  
Who in their right mind would side with an intern over a VP?  
  
Everyone piled on like vultures on roadkill.  
  
I'd seen this scenario play out a thousand times before. Brianna was just reaping the hurricane she'd sown.  
  
A nobody intern with zero connections or remarkable talent, thinking she could leapfrog to the executive floor with a few batted eyelashes? Please.  
  
Completely humiliated, Brianna handed in her resignation.  
  
Since she hadn't even completed proper onboarding, HR didn't waste a second before stamping ""APPROVED.""  
  
Brianna brought this entirely on herself. That's what happens when she was delusional enough to think she can steal someone else's husband and position.  
  
And Ryker? He managed to smooth things over with Grant Corp after their dinner.  
  
But after he discovered Brianna had left the company, his face turned darker than a thundercloud.  
  
When he came home that night, I was softly humming a lullaby to our son.  
  
Our little boy's chubby face‚Äîwith Ryker's nose and eyes perfectly copied onto his tiny features‚Äîwas peaceful in sleep.  
  
Ryker stood in the nursery doorway, his expression murderous despite deliberately keeping his voice down.  
  
""Brianna did absolutely nothing wrong. She was just a hardworking girl, and now because of your jealous power trip, she's lost her job AND her reputation!""  
  
""Jesus Christ, Mila, even your rich-bitch tantrums should have some goddamn limits!""  
  
I shot him a look that could freeze hell and signaled him to shut the fuck up as I gently placed our sleeping child in his crib.  
  
Only after walking out and slamming the door behind us did I unleash.  
  
""Let me make myself crystal clear, Ryker. I didn't order your precious Brianna to be bullied or fired.""  
  
Despite telling myself I shouldn't care, the raw distrust in his eyes still cut like a knife.  
  
""Be honest with yourself for once‚Äîhow many exceptions did you make for that girl? How many rules did you break?""  
  
""It was YOUR permissiveness, YOUR special treatment that gave her the idea she could aim for what's didn't belong to her.""  
  
""There is nothing between me and Brianna!"" Ryker fired back, veins popping in his neck.  
  
""Bullshit! Then why give her MY clothes? Why let her set up camp in your office like she owns the place?""  
  
""Your last assistant couldn't even bring a fucking chair into your office without you having a conniption fit.""  
  
""Yet for Brianna, you break rules left and right. You even glare at me‚Äîyour wife who just gave birth to your child‚Äîall for her sake!""  
  
I lifted my chin slightly, looking directly into Ryker's eyes, each word deliberate.  
  
""Let me spell it out for you, Ryker. Yes, I care about you. Otherwise, I wouldn't have married you or carried your child.""  
  
""But you know damn well I don't tolerate even a hint of betrayal or deception. Not now, not ever.""  
  
""If you dare cross that line‚Äîeven just with your eyes or your thoughts‚ÄîI won't hesitate for a second to find my son a father who knows how to respect his wife!""  
  
Ryker's face turned ashen as he spun around and stormed toward the guest bedroom.  
  
But I knew this storm would passed.  
  
After cooling off in the guest room, we'd reconcile tomorrow. Reset. Move forward.  
  
This had been our pattern throughout five years of marriage.  
  
The difference was that our previous conflicts had always been about business or household matters.  
  
Fighting over another woman? This was the first time.  
  
And I would make damn sure it was the last.

Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 30M and from the UK.

I'll try and keep it short and sweet. Unlike me, I'm your typical tall skinny white guy.

I'm on the search for a new bestie to join me on this journey called life. Someone to share the day with, build a connection, have some fun, live love laugh toaster bath. I'm interested in investing in something long term with someone who we can be out silly selves.

I've come out of a long term relationship a while back and kind of missing that close connection with someone. I'm not looking for anything romantic, but I am looking for someone who wants a deeply connected friendship.

This isn't for everyone but ideally I'm looking for someone kind of clingy. Someone who wants to talk all day, checks their phone for messages from each other, doesn't care about stuff like double messaging or spamming the hell out of each other. Someone to get excited to check your phone for.

I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark.

Some stuff about me so you know I'm not a blank slate ready to get smashed to death by the hammer of life:

- Recently started the gym. About time I started taking better care of myself. I need someone to hold me accountable!
- When I leave the house I like to cycle, hike explore and occasionally socialise with the unlucky sods I call friends.
- Heavy metal fan - You'll sometimes find me ar a concert/gig with the above mentioned friends. Bloodstock 2025!
- I play games. Currently playing POE2 but was obsessed with Satisfsctory the past two months. You'll usually find me AFKing on OSRS.
- I've been creating an android game for the past year or so in my spare time. Programming is hard at times but very rewarding. 
- I also have a 5 year old daughter with my ex. Would be great to connect with other parents.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
- Silly/chaotic vibes preferred

so i got this hp victus 15.6‚Äù laptop a year and a few months ago and used it daily for school and gaming. it started running a little slower than usual as does a laptop being used daily and wont run games well at all if not plugged in which ive seen with other hp victus laptops. has some cosmetic damage from being in a school bag but nothing serious. but today after i took it with me to work then to a coffee shop and back home, it wont charge even though i plug it in and it shows the charging icon. the light on the side says the battery is fully charged but the laptop runs extremely slow. the laptop fully died from 12% in 5 minutes after restart with no extra applications other than startup running. is it possible a contact from the charging port solder points on the pcb broke off or the battery fully disconnected?? or if it is software side? i can plug it in a turn it back on and login but it dies in <1 minute. ive opened it up to upgrade components and clean fans so i might open it up and check inside later.
