*Ever encountered that one person who seems to have an opinion about everything you do? The colleague who constantly critiques others' choices, the family member who lectures about ""right"" and ""wrong,"" or the team member who appoints themselves as the behavior police? You're not alone. Let's explore practical strategies for dealing with these challenging personalities.*

## Understanding the Pattern üîç

We all know them - those individuals who seem compelled to comment on everyone else's actions, decisions, and lifestyle choices. They might criticize your work methods, question your personal decisions, or offer unsolicited advice about how you should live your life. These behaviors often stem from their own insecurities, need for control, or genuine belief that they're helping others improve.

The key insight? Their behavior says more about them than it does about you.

## Why People Become Judgmental Critics ü§î

Several factors drive this tendency:

**Control Needs**: When people feel powerless in their own lives, they sometimes compensate by trying to influence others' behaviors and choices.

**Fear-Based Thinking**: Anxiety about uncertainty can manifest as rigid thinking patterns where there's only one ""right"" way to do things.

**Learned Patterns**: Some individuals grew up in environments where criticism was disguised as care, making this their default communication style.

**Perfectionism**: High personal standards can spill over into expectations for others, leading to constant evaluation and commentary.

**Social Validation**: Pointing out others' flaws can temporarily boost one's own sense of superiority or competence.

## Daily Life Strategies That Actually Work ‚ú®

### The Redirect Technique
When someone starts lecturing you about your choices, redirect the conversation back to them:
- ""That's an interesting perspective. What's working well in your current approach?""
- ""I appreciate your concern. How are things going with your own projects?""
- ""Thanks for sharing. What strategies have you found most effective in your experience?""

### The Information Diet üìä
Limit what personal information you share with habitual critics. They can't comment on what they don't know about. Keep conversations focused on:
- Work-related topics in professional settings
- General interests rather than personal struggles
- Positive developments rather than challenges you're facing

### The Boundary Setting Method
Establish clear limits without being confrontational:
- ""I understand you have thoughts about this. I've got it handled.""
- ""I appreciate your input. I'm comfortable with my current approach.""
- ""Thanks for caring. I'll keep that in mind as I move forward.""

### The Validation Flip üí´
Instead of defending yourself, acknowledge their concern while maintaining your autonomy:
- ""I can see why you might think that. Here's what I'm considering...""
- ""You raise an interesting point. I've weighed several factors...""
- ""That's definitely one way to look at it. My situation requires...""

## Workplace Applications üíº

**During Team Meetings**: When a colleague consistently questions your methods, prepare by documenting your reasoning beforehand. Present your approach with confidence and data when possible.

**Project Collaboration**: Create clear role definitions and communication protocols. When criticism becomes excessive, refer back to agreed-upon responsibilities and processes.

**Performance Reviews**: Focus on results and outcomes rather than methods. If your approach delivers results, let the data speak for itself.

**Email Communications**: Keep responses brief and professional. Avoid over-explaining your decisions, which can invite more criticism.

## Family Dynamics Management üè†

**Holiday Gatherings**: Prepare conversation redirects in advance. Have topics ready that shift focus away from personal choices.

**Regular Interactions**: Set visiting boundaries that work for your mental health. Shorter, more frequent interactions often work better than extended exposure.

**Decision Sharing**: Consider whether family members need to know about major life decisions before you've fully committed to them.

**Support System**: Build relationships with family members who accept you as you are, creating a buffer against constant criticism.

## Building Your Inner Resilience üõ°Ô∏è

### The Perspective Check
Remember that people's criticism often reflects their own anxieties and limitations rather than objective truth about your situation. Their discomfort with your choices doesn't make those choices wrong.

### The Energy Protection Practice
Develop mental strategies to maintain your emotional equilibrium:
- Take three deep breaths before responding to criticism
- Mentally repeat: ""Their opinion is about them, not me""
- Focus on your own goals and values rather than their expectations

### The Growth Mindset Approach
Use interactions with difficult people as opportunities to strengthen your communication skills and emotional boundaries. Each encounter is practice for handling future challenges.

## Long-Term Relationship Strategies üå±

### The Patience Investment
Some people change over time, especially when they realize their criticism isn't achieving the desired effect. Consistent, calm responses can gradually shift dynamics.

### The Distance Decision
Sometimes the healthiest choice is to limit contact with persistently negative individuals. This isn't giving up - it's protecting your mental resources for more positive relationships.

### The Team Dynamics Improvement
In work settings, consider whether addressing the pattern with management might improve overall team effectiveness. Document specific instances where criticism impacts productivity.

## When to Seek Additional Support üÜò

If dealing with judgmental individuals significantly impacts your daily life, work performance, or mental health, consider:

- Speaking with a counselor about developing stronger communication strategies
- Discussing workplace dynamics with HR if the behavior affects your job performance
- Joining support groups for people dealing with difficult family relationships
- Working with a coach to build confidence in your decision-making

## The Bigger Picture Perspective üéØ

Remember that you cannot control other people's behaviors, opinions, or reactions. You can only control your responses and the boundaries you establish. Focus your energy on:

- Making decisions aligned with your values and goals
- Building relationships with people who support your growth
- Developing skills that serve your long-term success
- Creating environments where you can thrive

Most importantly, recognize that someone else's need to criticize and control doesn't obligate you to defend, explain, or change your choices. Your life is yours to live, and you have the right to make decisions that work for your unique circumstances.

## Moving Forward with Confidence üöÄ

The goal isn't to change difficult people - that's beyond your control. The goal is to develop strategies that allow you to maintain your peace of mind, pursue your objectives, and build the life you want, regardless of others' commentary.

Every interaction with challenging personalities is an opportunity to strengthen your own emotional intelligence, communication skills, and personal boundaries. These abilities will serve you well in all areas of life, from professional advancement to personal relationships.

Remember: the most powerful response to someone else's need to control is your own calm confidence in your choices and your ability to stay focused on what truly matters to you.

1n9m2j6,https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceClubDiscussion/comments/1n9m2j6/while_waiting_for_the_update_i_reread_the_missing/,"While waiting for the update, I reread The Missing and was inspired to write a short story.","Season 2 episode 2 diamond choice ‚ÄúA very familiar man‚Äù scene. I needed the scene where Mads found out about Ghita and what happens between him warming her in bed before she wakes. Enjoy! 


The Unfrozen Heart 

The call came in sharp and breathless over the radio, the Greenlandic constable‚Äôs voice cutting through static:

‚ÄúYour colleague‚ÄîGhita Blom‚Äîshe went through the ice. Someone found her and got her out. He‚Äôs transporting her to medical. We don‚Äôt have any‚Ä¶‚Äù

Mads didn‚Äôt hear the rest.

His hand froze mid-note, pencil pressed so hard between his fingers it snapped in two. For a heartbeat, all the careful composure he was known for‚Äîthe calmness, the precision, the legendary steadiness under fire‚Äîfractured.

Not Ghita.

He was already moving, chair scraping against the floor, coat in hand. The rational part of his mind tried to keep up, whispering procedure: confirm her condition, find transport to be there by her side, alert medical. But the other part‚Äîlouder and raw- drowned it out with the image of her dark hair plastered to her pale skin, her eyes closed, her body limp in the snow.

He barked at the nearest constable for coordinates. His tone was clipped, efficient, but inside his chest something roared. He had worked with partners for over a decade, trusted men and women in firefights and stakeouts. He had never fear like this.

By the time he was on the snowmobile, the wind tearing at his face, his thoughts kept slipping, circling back to the same dangerous place: She‚Äôs different. She‚Äôs not supposed to be the one lying on the ice.

He‚Äôd seen Ghita take her first steps as lead investigator, watched her hold her ground in interviews with hardened criminals, watched her solve missing persons cases, admired the quiet fire in her questions. Somewhere between long nights over case files and bitter coffee at dawn, his admiration had shifted, deepened‚Äîinto something he never dared name. Not when they worked side by side, not when she looked up at him with that mix of curiosity and trust.

The ice blurred in front of him, the engine howling. His reputation had always been for control, for never letting his emotions touch the surface. But right now, his pulse was hammering against his ribs, and every instinct screamed at him to get there, to see her breathing with his own eyes.

When he finally arrived at the medic station, he saw her. Covered with blankets and unconscious. Her lips were tinged in blue and his heart dropped into his stomach. 

‚ÄúGhita!‚Äù His voice cracked louder than he meant it to, raw with something he hadn‚Äôt shown in years. He walked to where she lay, a large man was watching from the side, presumably the one who pulled her from the water. Mads‚Äôs gloved hand brushed wet strands of hair from her face. ‚ÄúHow did this happen?‚Äù He forced out, his voice coming out as a harsh whisper. 

The man explained that he saw her go through the ice, and immediately made his way to her. He only located her when he saw her air bubbles and pulled her out. She lost consciousness almost immediately and he transported her to medical. He had only arrived 20 minutes before Mads. 

His chest tightened. He looked away, signaling the medics forward, snapping back into the role everyone expected of him. The living legend. The man who never cracked.

When the medics finally cleared her of severe harm, the rescuer‚ÄîKuno‚Äîoffered his nearby home for her recovery. Mads informed Safaa of the situation and passed along the coordinates. Together they transferred Ghita carefully, laying her in the bed Kuno prepared. She still hadn‚Äôt stirred.

Then Kuno said quietly: one of them needed to share body heat with her. It was the most efficient way to stabilize her.

Mads didn‚Äôt hesitate. He stripped down at Kuno‚Äôs instruction, then slid under the heavy blankets. The cold rushed in first, sharp and biting, until he gathered Ghita against him. Her skin was icy, fragile under his touch, but the faint rise and fall of her chest pressed against his ribs. He let out a breath he hadn‚Äôt realized he‚Äôd been holding.

He wrapped his arms around her, pulling her close, trying to will warmth into her still body. Strands of still damp hair clung to his bare skin; her lashes brushed his collarbone when her head shifted slightly against him. Every inch of contact felt both necessary and dangerous.

This is procedure. Survival. Nothing more, he told himself. Yet his body betrayed him‚Äîthe way he tucked her closer, the way his hand lingered at the curve of her back, memorizing the steadying rhythm of her breathing.

He could feel her slowly warming beneath him, her pulse faint but steady. Relief threatened to undo him entirely. He tightened his hold, as if letting go might mean losing her all over again.

In the dim silence of Kuno‚Äôs cabin, Mads pressed his forehead against hers for the briefest moment. Just enough to feel that she was still here. Just enough to feel his own restraint fray.

He had a job to do. He had to remain professional. But inside, Mads knew: today had left a fissure he couldn‚Äôt seal.

He hadn‚Äôt panicked as a senior PA, nor as the seasoned professional assigned to guide her. He had panicked as a man who cared more than he should.

And that terrified him almost as much as the thought of losing her.",2,1757119643.0,RomanceClubDiscussion,0,0.75,False

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pok√©mon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills üòÖ But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats ü§§

Outside, the Liftom Mall lay quiet‚Äîor at least, quiet enough to make the shadows seem alive. I, Sargeant Lewy, leaned back in my chair, scanning the feed from the cameras. Every shuttered store, every dim aisle, every locked door held secrets after midnight. The air inside dispatch smelled faintly of burnt coffee and plastic‚Äîan artificial warmth clashing with the chill creeping through the vents.



At 0010hrs, Captain Steve Reve‚Äôs voice crackled over the radio. ‚ÄúLewy, we‚Äôve got a possible intruder near the dumpsters behind Main 2.‚Äù



I grabbed my flashlight and stepped into the chill night air. The wind carried a faint metallic scent‚Äîsomething like blood and rust. My boots echoed against the concrete as I approached. A flicker of movement caught my eye: a figure slipping between the shadows, moving with an unnatural silence, almost gliding. The man‚Äîno, something‚Äîpaused near the Best Buy delivery area, crouched, and picked up a metal sign. My pulse spiked, my breath misting in the cold night.



I called in the sighting to The Police Department, but before they could respond, he vanished into the maze of Main 4. My flashlight beam cut through the darkness, barely catching the glint of his eyes reflecting in the glass doors. I radioed S/P Dex and S/P Marion to converge, their static-laden voices promising backup.



Inside, the mall was a labyrinth of darkened stores. The Arcade and Jewelry Store looked like tombs, their silent interiors swallowing light and sound. Posters fluttered slightly in the draft, as if exhaling secrets of days gone by. The overhead speakers buzzed with static, interrupted occasionally by a faint pop‚Äîalmost like a whisper. Somewhere in the shadows, a laugh‚Äîor maybe a whisper‚Äîechoed, soft and fleeting, but it left a crawl across my spine.



Suddenly, the lights flickered in TJ‚Äôs. A mother and her children bolted out of the store after a call about a man taking photos. The mall, normally bustling with life and noise, now felt like a predator, alive in its own right. Every locked door, every camera feed, every empty hallway seemed to pulse with intent.



I moved methodically, floor by floor, sweeping the food court, Service Hall‚Äôs, and every restricted area. My flashlight cut through the darkness, highlighting abandoned shopping carts and scattered flyers that danced like phantoms. The faint metallic smell grew stronger, clinging to the corners of my senses.



At the corner near Main 3, I found him‚Äîor what had been him. A shapeless silhouette, leaning against the wall, then dissolving into the shadows, slipping through the back doors as if swallowed by the night itself. I froze, listening. The only sound was the distant hum of the emergency exit lights and my own heartbeat pounding in rhythm with the mall‚Äôs unsettling silence.



By 0200hrs, the mall was quiet again. Too quiet. I sat in dispatch, chest tight, replaying the camera feeds, scrutinizing every frame. Was it a man? Or something else lurking behind the walls of Liftom Mall, waiting for the clock to strike midnight again? Every shadow seemed to stretch toward me, as if the building itself remembered what had passed.



Outside, the wind shifted, carrying whispers from Main 2 to Main 4. And I realized, as I stared at the flickering monitors, that in a place like this, alone in the dark, the watchers sometimes become the watched. Somewhere in the shadows, something was moving, patient, calculating, waiting for the next midnight to awaken.",1,1757118964.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 32 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I‚Äôm really not interested I don‚Äôt know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I‚Äôm now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I‚Äôve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I‚Äôve never really dated and I‚Äôve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I‚Äôd like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You‚Äôll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I‚Äôm generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don‚Äôt have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don‚Äôt like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face¬† I am not that type of guy. I also don‚Äôt like those that think it‚Äôs okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.¬† 

I am not one that is into partying I don‚Äôt like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I‚Äôm not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going¬† to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I‚Äôm very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I‚Äôve never been tempted by anyone and I‚Äôd never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don‚Äôt view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I‚Äôd have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I‚Äôve never been on loads of dates I‚Äôm not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that‚Äôs it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don‚Äôt want to use the actual word for it and I don‚Äôt smoke I don‚Äôt drink heavily and I‚Äôve never touched any illegal drugs. I‚Äôve got no bad addictions or bad habits I‚Äôve lived a very clean life. 

I‚Äôm not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I‚Äôm in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I‚Äôve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I‚Äôd love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking¬† often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I‚Äôm not bad at it and I‚Äôd again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I‚Äôve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it‚Äôs not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don‚Äôt just want to settle I‚Äôve never just wanted to settle I‚Äôm seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I‚Äôd never have an affair or a fling and I‚Äôm not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone I loved and cared about 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it‚Äôs an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I‚Äôve been to and we have the lovely √Æle de re island nearby I have been there many times it‚Äôs also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it‚Äôs certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it‚Äôs amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I‚Äôm very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don‚Äôt know. I also love soft rock some of the bands¬† love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I‚Äôve seen most of my favourite bands live too I‚Äôve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she‚Äôs a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she‚Äôs absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it‚Äôs my favourite but I only have it in moderation I‚Äôve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don‚Äôt drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don‚Äôt drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can‚Äôt ever see myself going either way.¬† 

It‚Äôs very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don‚Äôt drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I‚Äôm not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I‚Äôm not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I‚Äôve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I‚Äôm not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won‚Äôt be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don‚Äôt fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I‚Äôm very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I‚Äôm in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I‚Äôm always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don‚Äôt aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don‚Äôt watch reality tv. I don‚Äôt watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it‚Äôs how I‚Äôve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I‚Äôd never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don‚Äôt wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I‚Äôd prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don‚Äôt wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

I dont have any physical looks requirements other than I like natural looking women 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don‚Äôt just say hi or hello I‚Äôm unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

1n9lruq,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalmysteries/comments/1n9lruq/thoughts/,Thoughts?,"I need some help. I‚Äôve not ever really felt like I‚Äôve gotten good help from medical professionals and am realizing again that I need to be doing my own research and investigating.

I‚Äôve had a hard time with my periods for 22 years now, throwing up almost every time my menstruation arrives. 

Separately, (or related, I don‚Äôt really know) last year I developed a large kidney stone that was removed by a ureteroscopy procedure. The stone was embedded in my kidney and the surgeon said my kidney had been pretty damaged because of it. I had a stent in for a month and then removed. 

Since my removal I‚Äôve had some kidney discomfort and bladder pain, and some intermittent UTI symptoms but nothing that lasts very long. My general rule of thumb is if something persists for 3 days it‚Äôs time to go to the Dr. The UTI issues haven‚Äôt persisted that long but I still went into the Dr. 

I gave a urine sample and it showed positive for leukocytes and blood in my urine and then further testing came back negative for any type of infection. 

My Dr recommended I do some research on bladder sensitivity and foods that can upset the bladder- coffee and cheese were really the only ones on the list that I consume and at pretty low levels (1-2 cups of coffee a day and 3 small slices of cheese). My sugar consumption has been up in the last two weeks and I recently discontinued smoking pot (3 weeks) and am not consuming it in any other form. I haven‚Äôt drank alcohol in over a month and don‚Äôt usually consume more than 1-2 drinks in a month (although did have a phase of drinking heavily on the weekends from 2014-2017, and then occasionally binge drinking 2017-2021).

Any suggestions or ideas about what I can adjust or ask my Dr to check into? Plan for now is to keep a log of foods I‚Äôm eating, activities I‚Äôm participating in and symptoms to see if there are any correlations. ",1,1757118754.0,medicalmysteries,1,1.0,False

You walk through this world like it owes you nothing and you owe it everything. A woman made of fire and resilience, your heels never buckle, your voice never wavers. You‚Äôve spent years proving to everyone, including yourself, that you don‚Äôt need saving. You‚Äôve become the calm in every storm, the smile that never cracks, the silence that absorbs everything and complains about nothing.

And still, I know.

I know about those moments no one sees. The ones that live in the quiet between the chaos. When your body finally collapses onto your bed and your hand finds your face before the tear can. When you stare into your coffee, not for caffeine but for comfort, hoping for some sign that you‚Äôre not as alone as you‚Äôve had to become. When you sit in your car an extra five minutes because the thought of being ‚Äúon‚Äù for one more second is almost unbearable.

You wear strength like a second skin, but I can feel the ache underneath it.

You don‚Äôt cry to be saved. You cry to breathe. You cry because you‚Äôve carried more than most people could bear and still chosen to love anyway. You cry because for all your fire, you‚Äôre human, and even goddesses get tired.

And that‚Äôs why I write this.

Because somewhere, perhaps while scrolling late at night, you stumbled across my words. You lingered longer than you meant to. You felt something curl in your chest and then you looked away‚Ä¶because the part of you that believes in magic has been betrayed before. And love, real love, feels like a trick your heart is no longer willing to fall for.

But I‚Äôm not asking for your trust right away.

I‚Äôm asking you to be seen.

You, with your brave face and your secret softness. You, who‚Äôs lived like the whole world was a performance and you were both the lead and the curtain puller. You, who‚Äôs had your soul admired in fragments but never held in full.

I don‚Äôt want to break down your walls.
I want to sit beside them until you feel safe enough to open the door.

I want to meet the version of you no one gets to see. The one who dances in the kitchen barefoot, who laughs until she falls, who just wants someone to stroke her hair while she rambles on about the stars and what she wants out of this life. I want the woman who feels too much, who asks too little, who hides how badly she wants to be chosen.

Because you, my love, are worth choosing.

Again and again and again.

And no, I don‚Äôt need you to fall into my arms tonight. I don‚Äôt need you to believe in forever just yet. But I need you to know that I see you. That I would hold space for every part of you you‚Äôve ever had to shrink to make others comfortable.

You don‚Äôt have to carry this all alone anymore.

If your heart aches for something more, it‚Äôs because more exists.

And when you‚Äôre ready, when the fear softens and the hope gets louder, I‚Äôll be here. No sudden moves. No pressure. Just presence. Just a man who has waited his whole life to meet a woman like you.

And when you finally let go‚Ä¶

When you collapse into arms that don‚Äôt just hold you but reverence you.
When your tears are caught instead of hidden.
When your voice doesn‚Äôt need permission to speak freely.
When your strength is admired but your softness adored.

You‚Äôll know.

I wasn‚Äôt just here to love you.
I was here to honour you.

I want the woman who feels too much, who asks too little, who hides how badly she wants to be chosen.

Because you, my love, are worth choosing.

You don‚Äôt have to carry this all alone anymore.

If your heart aches for something more, it‚Äôs because more exists.

When your voice doesn‚Äôt need permission to speak freely.

The woman working was really nice and happy and I found her attractive. She was working alone and obviously a bit busy, so I suggested I try another day and headed off. 

I've been thinking about the interaction a little over the last few days and wondering if I should stop in again and leave my number, on the off-chance she's single.

She didn't do anything to suggest she was into me or would be receptive - I just thought she was nice and want to see if she'd like to get coffee.

But I'm always conscious of people working - they're doing their job and being nice is very often a part of that. They're also at work - they may not want to be 'hit on' (quotes because broad term for something that would look more like an awkward guy nervously asking if he could leave his number) by strangers, or just find it inappropriate or perhaps feel unsafe/uncomfortable in their workplace afterwards.

So, I turned 31 today, and please don't congratulate me, I stopped celebrating my birthday years ago because they always turn out horrible. 
However, the last 2 years I tried again, after more than 15 years pretending that it doesn't exist. 
Last year was, as expected, horrible. And this year was even worse.
I set diner reservations for me and my fiance and ordered tickets to one of my more liked movie franchises (the conjuring). 
Then I proceeded to hurt my leg (damaged a few nerves apparently ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) effectively making myself immobile. 
Anyways, so my fiance's grandma called and asked if we could stay at her house for a few days to watch her dog while she went on vacation (she would leave on my birthday). Perfect solution, since her house is way closer to the cinema and way closer to a bus so both dogs (hers and ours) would not be home alone long and I wouldn't have to walk much. 

So, today, first I wake up because some idiot decided it was a good idea to loudly mow the grass at 7 am. üòí Waking me up freaking early. 
Then the day went as normal, taking a shower, walking my dog, drinking coffee. But then, grandma called. She announced that someone else would also be staying at her house, so we could go to the movies without worrying about the dogs. Friendly thought, sure, but that person is a pain in the butt to say it lightly. The Movie would end around midnight so by the time we would be back it would be over midnight. 
But this person will not wait that long, he insists on going to bed early (even tho he's scrolling on his phone untill 3/4 at night) and will completely go berserk if you disturb them. Plus, they insist on sleeping on the couch in front of the TV. 
We talked to grandma a few days earlier and asked if we could watch a movie when we came home after the movie (we usually go to sleep around 4/5 at night) so she knew that we planned on watching a few movies after, but with this person there, this was no longer possible. We basically needed to walk on eggshells even entering the house with that person there. üòí
And without sleeping at grandma, I wouldn't be able to go to the movies since I wouldn't be able to get to the last bus going home, especially with my leg in this state, and she also knew this. 
So after a bunch of fighting between grandma and my fiance, my fiance therefore fighting with me, and my fiance fighting with that person, everybody just started blaming me. üòí The person in question is freaking mad, because ""he now needed to stay home"", grandma was pissed because she randomly decided that this would be best, and my fiance was pissed because I just didn't want to go anymore and (to me) he was only thinking about himself. 
Constantly saying ""he did this for me"" ""he fought with his grandma for me"", but all I wanted was to just stay home, because after being yelled at, being called names, deal with aggression from multiple people with nobody even caring about what I thought and the fact that it was my birthday, I was already just done. 
So, by the time this was solved, we already missed our diner reservation, so no eating out. And since my fiance basically forced me to go to the movies, we immediately had to go otherwise we wouldn't make it. So I didn't have time to dress properly or do any of the makeup that I wanted. And once in the city I just grabbed a cheese sandwich and a banana from a to go store before we went to the movies. 
That was my diner. 
And by the time the movie ended and we went outside, the day was over. 

Then we went back to grandma's house, and we are able to watch movies, but all I want to do is just go to bed and pretend this day never happened. 
So, next year, I'll just turn my phone off, turn my Xbox on and play the entire day without getting any congrats messages from people who, at the end of the day, don't care. üòÖ Since I told them all that I would try to celebrate because it's always horrible, and maybe it would be different. And every single time everyone seems to go out of their way to make my birthday the worst day of the year. üòÖ So I'm just done. 

Is this a bpd thing, or would anyone react like this after this many failed and horrible birthdays. At this point I'd rather go and have a root canal before I ever celebrate my birthday ever again. ",1,1757117916.0,BPD,0,1.0,False

Early Friday morning, it was reported that the Seattle Sounders have begun an inquiry into taking on the rights for Messi‚Äôs contract.

Craig Waibel was quoted as saying ‚ÄúThe vet minimum is the best we can realistically offer for a player in the twilight of their career. There are other positions of need on the roster, and we have to be mindful to the continued success of this group.‚Äù

It should be noted that the Sounders have a number of players on contracts that will need extensions and raises, such as goalkeeper of the tournament Andrew Thomas or the now internationally famous Paul Rothrock.

When asked for comment, head coach Brian Schmetzer had this to say:

‚ÄúIf the money is right, and the front office can make it happen, then yeah, we can use a player like that on our roster. But I want to be clear. Albert Rusnak isn‚Äôt going anywhere. Jesus Ferreira isn‚Äôt going anywhere. If he wants to come here and win silverware, yeah we are going to do that, as much as anyone in MLS can say that. But Albert is the day one starter. If he wants to come -if he wants to *compete* for that spot, then yeah, if the money works out we‚Äôd love to have him. He‚Äôs a great player.‚Äù

Will this mark a new chapter in the greatest players career? Tensions are certainly mounting in Miami, and Seattle is a famously successful club within MLS. 

Seattle has a history of offering end of career contracts to players with ties to the region. While Messi doesn‚Äôt own a coffee shop in the area like Fredy Montero did, it should be noted that Messi has been in the northwest, experienced the fans, the weather, and the natural beauty that draws in billionaire retirees like moths to a flame.

And who knows, maybe a region that‚Äôs used to managing billionaire egos would be good for the man. Clearly, something needs to change.",21,1757117719.0,SoundersFC,2,0.86,False

=====
Three years. One thousand and ninety-five days of trying to be the perfect wife, and this was my reward divorce papers on our anniversary.
""Sign here. And here."" Stefan's voice was distant, businesslike. 
He'd laid out the divorce papers like contracts at one of his meetings, sticky tabs marking each signature line. ""The highlighted sections need initials.""
My hands wouldn't stop shaking. ""You're doing this today? On our anniversary?""
I stared at Stefan's perfect signature on the last page, the ink still fresh. He must have signed them this morning, probably right after I'd left that st**id handmade card on his desk. 
The one I'd spent hours making, like a f**l who still believed in fairy tales. The anniversary card I made for my husband Stefan still sat on the kitchen counter, untouched. 
Three years of marriage summed up in a handmade gesture he couldn't even bother to open. I'd spent hours on it last night, writing words I thought mattered.
My coffee had gone cold. Funny how you notice small things when your world is falling apart.
""Camille."" He sighed, that familiar sound of disappointment I'd heard so many times before. ""There's no point dragging this out.""

The morning sun streamed through our kitchen windows, catching the diamond on my finger. Three carats, princess cut, picked out by his mother. 

""Not your style, dear, but it's what a Rodriguez wife should wear,"" she'd said at the time. Like everything else in my life, it had never really been mine.

""Is there someone else?""

The question hung in the air between us. Stefan straightened his tie, Italian silk, the blue one I'd given him for Christmas. ""Yes.""

One word. That's all it took to erase three years of trying to be perfect.

""How long?""

""Two months."" He wouldn't meet my eyes. ""She came back to town and...""

""Two months,"" I repeated. All those late nights at the office. The missed dinners. The way he'd stopped ki**ing me goodbye in the mornings.

""Were you ever going to tell me? Or just keep lying until the papers were ready?""

""I didn't want to hurt you.""

A laugh bubbled up, harsh, unfamiliar. ""That's thoughtful of you.""

My hand knocked against my coffee mug, sending it crashing to the floor. 

Dark liquid spread across the pristine tiles, staining the grout I'd scrubbed on hands and knees last week because his mother was coming to visit.

""Let me get that..."" Stefan reached for the paper towels.

""Don't."" My voice cracked. ""Just... don't pretend to care now.""

I bent to pick up the broken pieces. A photo slipped from between the divorce papers, landing face-up in the spilled coffee.

The world stopped.

I knew that smile. Those eyes. That perfectly poised expression that had haunted every family photo since I was twelve.

""Rose?"" My sister's name tasted like poison. ""Your first love was Rose?""

Stefan's silence said everything.

Memories hit like punches to the gut. Rose helping me pick out my wedding dress. Rose giving to**ts at our engagement party. 

Rose calling every week to check on my marriage, to give advice about keeping Stefan happy.

My adopted sister. My parents' golden child. The one they'd chosen to love.

""She never left town, did she?"" The pieces were falling into place. ""She's been here the whole time, waiting. Playing the supportive sister while you both laughed at st**id, naive Camille.""

""It wasn't like that."" Stefan ran his hands through his hair, that gesture I used to find endearing. ""We tried to fight it. But some people are just meant to...""

""If you say 'meant to be' I swear I'll throw this mug at your head."" My fingers tightened around the broken ceramic. ""How long were you together before? Before me?""

He shifted uncomfortably. ""Four years. Until she got the job offer in London.""

Four years. The same time I'd started dating Stefan. The same time Rose had suddenly become my biggest cheerleader, pushing me toward him.

""She set this up,"" I whispered. ""All of it. And I fell for every piece.""

""Camille, you're being dramatic. Rose cares about you.""

""Like she cared when she told my first boyfriend I was damaged goods? Or when she convinced my parents I was too unstable for college?"" The broken mug cut into my palm, but I barely felt it. 

""She's been sabotaging me my whole life, and I kept making excuses because that's what good sisters do, right?""

Bl**d dripped onto the divorce papers. Stefan reached for my hand but I jerked away.

""Don't touch me."" I grabbed a dish towel, wrapping it around my palm. ""Where is she now? Waiting to comfort me through my divorce? Planning your next wedding?""

""She wanted to be here, but I thought it would be better...""

""Better?"" I laughed again, the sound edged with hysteria. ""Yes, you've both been so concerned with what's better for me. Such caring people.""

I picked up the pen, the Mont Blanc he'd given me on our first anniversary. The one Rose had helped him choose.

""Camille, wait. We should talk about this properly.""

I signed every page, my signature perfectly steady. Let them see I wasn't breaking. Let them think they'd won.

""I'm done talking."" I gathered my purse, the signed papers, Rose's photo. ""Done pretending. Done being the good sister, the perfect wife, the daughter who never complains.""

""Where are you going?""

""Away from you. Away from her. Away from everyone who thinks Camille Lewis is someone they can use and discard.""

My phone buzzed, Rose's smiling face lit up the screen. Right on cue, coming to play her part.

I declined the call and walked to the door. Behind me, Stefan called out, ""You can't just leave. We need to discuss arrangements, the house, the accounts...""

""You can have it all."" I turned to face him one last time. ""The house, the cars, the life you built on lies. I don't want anything that reminds me of either of you.""

""Camille, please...""

""Goodbye, Stefan."" I smiled, and something in my expression made him step back. ""Give Rose my love. Tell her thank you, actually.""

""For what?""

""For finally showing me the truth. About her, about you, about who I need to become.""

I walked out of that house, out of that life, leaving bl**dy fingerprints on the door handle. Let them try to erase those as easily as they'd erased me.

Three years of pretending to be someone I wasn't. Three years of swallowing pain and making excuses for people who never deserved my loyalty.

My phone buzzed again. Rose. Then my mother. Then Stefan. One by one, I blocked them all.

Every connection to the life I thought I had to live.

In my rearview mirror, I caught a glimpse of my reflection. Tears streaked my makeup, bl**d stained my dress, my hair had come loose from its perfect twist.

I looked nothing like the polished, proper wife Stefan Rodriguez had married.

Chapter 2 CAMILLE'S POINT OF VIEW 002
The house was quiet, too quiet. I slipped in through the side door, locking it softly behind me. 

The air smelled like lemon polish and roses, just like it always did. It felt strange to be back, like stepping into someone else's life.

The kitchen was dark except for the faint glow of the fridge light. I crept up the stairs, careful to skip the third step that creaked. Every sound I made felt loud, like the house itself was listening.

When I reached my bedroom door, I stopped. It was open a crack, just like I'd left it all those years ago. Taking a deep breath, I stepped inside and shut the door.

My childhood bedroom hadn't changed in three years. Same pale pink walls, same white furniture, same collection of second-place trophies. Rose's first-place ones used to shine in the room next door.

I stared at my reflection in the vanity mirror, the same one where I'd practiced my wedding makeup three years ago, Rose standing behind me with that perfect smile. 

Now my mascara was smeared, hair wild, designer dress wrinkled. Mom would have a fit if she saw me like this.

The clock on my nightstand read 10:47 PM. I'd been sitting here for hours, packing what little of my old life I wanted to keep. Amazing how seventeen years in this house fit into one duffel bag.

My phone buzzed again, the twentieth time in an hour. This time it was Mom.

""Camille, this is ridiculous. Come home so we can discuss this like adults. Rose is worried sick...""

I hung up. Of course Rose was worried. Her carefully laid plans were unraveling.

The front door clicked open downstairs. I froze, listening to familiar footsteps on hardwood. The slight tap of heels, the whisper of expensive fabric.

""Camille?"" Mom's voice floated up the stairs. ""Darling, I know you're here. The housekeeper saw your car.""

I should have parked around the block. Should have been smarter, faster, better at disappearing. But I'd never been the clever one, had I? That was Rose's role.

More footsteps. A deeper voice, Dad, probably called home from work to deal with his hysterical younger daughter. Again.

""Princess?"" His voice carried that same gentle tone he'd used when I was twelve, crying about Rose getting my spot in the school play. ""Let's talk about this.""

A third set of footsteps made my bl**d freeze. Lighter, more graceful. Perfect, like everything else about her.

""Camille?"" Rose's voice dripped concern. ""Sweetie, please. Don't shut us out.""

I looked at the family photo on my dresser, taken the day Rose's adoption was finalized. 

Mom and Dad beaming, Rose radiant in her new dress, thirteen-year-old me trying to smile through braces and acne. One big happy family.

What a joke.

The memory hit me like a punch to the gut:

---

""But I've been practicing for months!"" I clutched my script, tears blurring the words. ""Mrs. Bennett said the lead was mine!""

Rose touched my shoulder, gentle as always. ""Oh, sweetie. I didn't mean to take your part. I just... the words came so naturally in the audition. Mrs. Bennett said I had a gift.""

Of course she did. Everyone said Rose had a gift. For music, for acting, for making people love her.

""Maybe..."" Rose's eyes lit up with that special gleam that always meant trouble. ""Maybe you could help me practice? Be my supporting actress? We could make it our sister thing!

I'd agreed. Because that's what good sisters did. Because saying no to Rose meant disappointed looks from Mom, lectures from Dad about family loyalty.

Opening night, I watched from the wings as Rose brought the audience to tears. Afterward, Mom bought her roses. Dad took us all to dinner.

No one mentioned that I'd written Rose's best lines during our ""practice sessions."" Or that her dramatic monologue had been word-for-word what I'd performed in my original audition.

Rose just had a gift for memorization, that's all.

---

""Camille Elizabeth Lewis!"" Mom's voice sharpened. ""This behavior is completely unacceptable.""

I opened my bedroom door.

They stood in the hallway like a perfect family portrait, Mom in her designer suit, Dad looking distinguished in his work clothes, Rose wearing concern like the latest fashion trend.

""Hello, sister."" My voice came out steady. ""Shouldn't you be comforting your fianc√©?""

Rose's eyes widened. Always the performer. ""Camille, please. Let me explain...""

""Explain what? How you've been sl**ping with my husband? Or how you set this whole thing up from the beginning?""

""What is she talking about?"" Dad turned to Rose, who already had tears forming. Perfect, delicate tears that never smeared her makeup.

""She's upset,"" Rose whispered. ""Lashing out. You know how she gets, Daddy.""

""Don't."" My laugh sounded strange, even to me. 

""Don't you dare play that card again. Show them the ring, Rose. The one Stefan gave you two months ago while I was supposedly too sick to attend the charity gala.""

Mom gasped. Dad's face darkened. But Rose, Rose's mask slipped for just a second. I saw it this time, that flash of cold calculation behind the concern.

""It wasn't like that,"" she started.

""Really? Then how was it? Explain to everyone how you've been calling me every week, giving me marriage advice while sl**ping with my husband. Tell them about all the times you helped me pick out li**erie for anniversaries when Stefan was really working late with you.""

""That's enough!"" Mom stepped forward. ""Rose would never...""

""Never what, Mom? Never lie? Never manipulate? Never steal something that belonged to her sister?"" I pulled out my phone, playing the last voicemail from Stefan.

His voice filled the hallway: ""Rose is my soulmate, Camille. We tried to fight it, but some people are just meant to be together. You have to understand...""

The silence that followed was deafening.

Rose recovered first. ""I never meant to hurt you. We can't help who we love...""

The sound of my palm connecting with her cheek echoed like a g**shot.

""Camille!"" Mom grabbed my arm. ""Have you lost your mind?""

""No,"" I said quietly, watching a red mark bloom on Rose's perfect face. ""For the first time in fourteen years, I'm seeing clearly.""

I walked past them, duffel bag in hand. Behind me, Rose's sobs started, the same performance she'd perfected over years of turning everyone against me.

""Where are you going?"" Dad called after me. ""You can't just walk away from family!""

I paused at the top of the stairs, looking back at my so-called family. Mom comforting Rose, Dad looking torn, and my sister watching me through her tears with eyes that held no warmth at all.

""Family?"" I smiled, and something in my expression made them all step back. ""No, this isn't family. This is a game. And for fourteen years, I've been playing by Rose's rules.""

""Camille, please,"" Rose reached for me, ever the caring sister. ""Let me make this right.""

I caught her wrist before she could touch me. ""You taught me well, big sister. About manipulation. About patience. About waiting for the perfect moment to strike.""

Her eyes widened, real fear this time, not performed.

""Thank you for the lessons,"" I whispered, letting her go. ""Now watch how well I learned them.""

I walked down the stairs, ignoring their calls. In the foyer mirror, I caught one last glimpse of myself, mascara-stained, wild-eyed, finally unchained.

Chapter 3 ROSE'S POINT OF VIEW 003
I swirled the ch**pagne in my crystal flute, watching the bubbles dance. Victory tasted sweet, just like I'd imagined all these years.

The living room of my penthouse apartment overlooked the city where I'd spent twenty years pretending to be the perfect adopted daughter, the loving sister, the supportive friend.

What a joke.

""To freedom,"" I whispered to my reflection in the window. The woman staring back at me smiled, perfect teeth, perfect hair, perfect lies. Just like always.

My phone buzzed again. Another missed call from Stefan. He'd been calling non-stop since Camille walked out, probably worried I'd change my mind now that everything was in the open. 

Poor, predictable Stefan. Still thinking he was in control of any of this.

I kicked off my Louboutins and sank into the leather couch, letting memories wash over me like warm w**e.

---

The first time I saw Camille Lewis, I hated her.

I was thirteen, fresh out of foster care, desperate to please my new parents. 

They'd brought me to this massive house with its manicured lawn and marble floors, promising me a fresh start. A real family.

Then this skinny thing with braces and messy hair came bouncing down the stairs, all eager smiles and innocent eyes.

""Hi! I'm Camille. I've always wanted a sister!""

She hugged me right there in the foyer, not caring that my clothes were secondhand or that I smelled like the group home's industrial detergent. Just pure, genuine joy at having a sister.

I wanted to vomit.

Because there she was, this awkward, imperfect girl who had everything I'd spent thirteen years dreaming about. 

Parents who actually wanted her. A home she belonged in. A future secured by the Lewis family name.

And she didn't even appreciate it properly.

I watched her over dinner that first night, watched how she slouched in her chair and talked with her mouth full. How she didn't know which fork to use for salad.

How she laughed too loud and asked too many questions.

""Rose has such lovely manners,"" Mrs. Lewis... Mom... had said, smiling at me. ""Perhaps you could learn from your new sister, Camille.""

That's when I saw it. The first crack in Camille's perfect world. The slight dimming of her smile, the way she sat up straighter, tried harder.

It was beautiful.

---

My phone buzzed again, pulling me back to the present. Stefan's face lit up my screen, his fifth call in an hour. With a sigh, I answered.

""Darling, you're being needy.""

""Rose."" His voice was rough. Had he been drinking? ""She's gone. Really gone. Blocked my number, cleaned out her closet...""

""Isn't that what we wanted?"" I kept my voice gentle, soothing. The same tone I'd used all those times I'd counseled Camille through her marital problems. Problems I'd carefully orchestrated.""

""I just... the way she looked at me...""

""Stefan, sweetheart."" I let steel edge into my sweetness. ""Are you having second thoughts? After everything we've been through?""

""No! No, of course not. I love you. I've always loved you.""

""Then stop calling me about your ex-wife. It's pathetic.""

I hung up, tossing the phone aside. Men were so predictably weak.

Even Stefan, who I'd spent four years grooming before pushing him toward Camille, still needed constant management.

But he'd served his purpose. Just like everyone else in my carefully constructed game.

The family photo on my mantel caught my eye, my adoption day. I stood in the center, of course. Always the center. 

Camille pushed to the edge of the frame, trying so hard to smile through her insecurities.

God, it had been easy. Almost too easy.

A little whisper here about how Camille was unstable. A few concerned conversations with Mom about how worried I was about my dear sister's emotional state. 

Casual mentions to Dad about how Camille seemed to be struggling with basic adult responsibilities.

Fourteen years of careful groundwork, positioning myself as the responsible daughter, the achievable dream, while slowly crushing Camille's confidence, her relationships, her sense of self.

The college rejection was particularly inspired, if I do say so myself. All it took was one tearful conversation with Mom about finding Camille's ""secret"" diary, filled with dark thoughts and destructive plans. 

Plans I'd written myself, of course, in Camille's childish handwriting that I'd spent months practicing to forge.

Suddenly, their precious younger daughter wasn't ready for college. Needed time to ""find herself."" Needed to stay close to home where they could watch her.

Where I could watch her.

I took another sip of ch**pagne, savoring the moment. Because this, this was what I'd really wanted all along. 

Not Stefan, he was just a useful pawn. Not the Lewis fortune, though that would come in time.

No, what I wanted was to watch perfect, precious Camille finally break. To see her realize that everything she thought she had family, love, security, had been built on my lies.

My phone buzzed with a text from Mom: ""Rose, darling, please come over. Your father and I need to talk about what happened.""

I smiled, already planning my performance. The tearful confusion, the reluctant confession about Stefan's pursuit, the gentle concern about Camille's mental state.

By the time I was done, they'd be thanking me for protecting them from their unstable daughter all these years.

Standing up, I walked to my closet, selecting the perfect outfit for my next scene. Something subtle but expensive. Grieving sister, not celebrating victor.

The massive walk-in closet had been Camille's wedding gift to me. ""So you'll always have space for your amazing fashion sense,"" she'd said, hugging me tight.

Even then, even after years of watching me steal every spotlight, every opportunity, every scrap of parental approval, she'd still loved me. Still trusted me.

Id**t.

I pulled out a cream cashmere sweater, remembering how Camille used to borrow my clothes in high school. 

How I'd wait until she had something important, a date, a presentation, an interview, then suddenly remember I needed that exact outfit.

She'd always given them back without argument. Always apologized for the inconvenience.

Always tried so hard to be the perfect sister.

My reflection caught my eye, and for a moment, just a moment, I saw something ugly there. 

Something that looked like the scared, angry foster kid who'd walked into the Lewis house all those years ago.

But then I blinked, and I was perfect Rose again. Flawless Rose. Rose who could do no wrong.

Slipping on my Cartier bracelet, another gift from my dear sister, I prepared for my next performance. 

The concerned family meeting would need just the right touch of reluctant honesty, devastated betrayal.

""Oh, Camille,"" I whispered to my reflection, practicing my worried frown. ""What have you done to yourself?""

But as I turned to leave, something made me pause. That look in Camille's eyes before she'd walked out, I'd never seen it before. 

Not in twenty years of pushing her, testing her, breaking her.

It had looked almost like... understanding.

Like she'd finally seen through my mask to the truth underneath.

I shook off the uneasy feeling. Camille was weak, just like I'd made her. She'd run away, lick her wounds, maybe try to start over somewhere new.

But she'd never be free of me. I'd made sure of that years ago.

Chapter 4 STEFAN'S POINT OF VIEW 004
The sc**ch burned going down, but I poured another anyway. 

My third? Fourth? I'd lost count somewhere between signing those divorce papers and watching Camille walk away.

Our wedding photo still sat on my desk, mocking me. Camille's genuine smile, my distracted eyes,  already looking past her, always looking for Rose.

Rose.

Even her name felt like betrayal now.

My phone lit up with another message from her: ""Darling, stop drinking and come over. We should celebrate.""

Celebrate. Like we hadn't just destroyed someone who loved us. Someone who'd given me three years of devotion I never deserved.

The memory hit me like a punch to the gut.

---

""Stefan?"" Camille's voice was small, uncertain. ""Did I do something wrong?""

I looked up from my laptop, irritated at the interruption. She stood in the doorway of my home office, holding a plate of something that smelled amazing.

""I made that pasta you mentioned. The one with truffles?"" Her eyes were hopeful. ""Rose gave me the recipe...""

Of course she had. Rose had made that pasta for me in Rome, years ago. Back when we were... whatever we were.

""I'm busy."" I didn't even look at the plate. ""Just leave it.""

""Oh."" A pause. ""It's just, you've been working late all week, and I thought...""

""Camille."" My voice sharp with an anger that wasn't really meant for her. ""I said I'm busy.""

She left the plate and disappeared, quiet as always. The pasta sat untouched until morning, a perfect recreation of a memory that belonged to another woman.

---

I hurled my glass at the wall, watching crystal shatter like the life I'd built on lies.

God, I'd been cruel. Not just at the end, but throughout our marriage.

Every missed dinner, every forgotten anniversary, every time I'd chosen work over her, all excuses to avoid the guilt of wanting her sister.

My phone buzzed again. Mother this time.

""Darling, I just heard from Rose. Are you alright? Do you need anything? I always said Camille wasn't suited for our family...""

I silenced the phone, remembering another moment I'd tried to forget.

---

""She's trying so hard, Stefan."" Rose's voice was gentle as she poured me another dr**k. We were alone in my office after another disastrous family dinner. ""Maybe if you gave her more guidance...""

""Like you did?"" I couldn't keep the bitterness from my voice. ""Teaching her all the ways to be perfect?""

Rose's laugh was musical, practiced. Everything about her was practiced. ""Are you saying you preferred me imperfect?""

The air between us crackled with unspoken history. Four years of pa**ion and plans, ended by her sudden departure to London. Or so she'd claimed.

""Why did you really leave?"" The question slipped out, colored by wh**key and old pain.

""You know why."" She touched my cheek, familiar and forbidden. ""Camille needed a chance at happiness. We both agreed...""

Had we? I couldn't remember anymore. Everything from that time felt hazy, manipulated. Like watching a play where I'd forgotten my lines.

""She loves you,"" Rose whispered, too close now. ""More than I ever could.""

But her eyes said something different. They always had.

---

Another memory surfaced, this one from last week. The moment everything changed.

---

""I made your favorite breakfast."" Camille's smile was bright, genuine. Always so d**n genuine. ""Happy anniversary.""

The divorce papers burned in my briefcase, Rose's perfume still lingering on my clothes from our late-night ""meeting.""

""I can't."" I grabbed my keys, avoiding her eyes. ""Early meeting.""

""Oh."" Her voice cracked slightly. ""Will you be home for dinner? I thought we could...""

""Don't wait up.""

I'd spent that evening with Rose, planning how to break the news. She'd worn the same perfume she'd worn in Rome, all those years ago.

""It's kinder this way,"" she'd said, str**ing my hair. ""A clean break. Camille will understand eventually.""

Would she? The look in her eyes when she'd seen Rose's photo...

---

My office door opened, startling me from the memory. Mother stood there, perfectly coiffed even at midnight.

""Really, darling. Dr**king alone in the dark?""

""Not now, Mother.""

She clicked across the room, surveying the broken glass with disapproval. ""Rose is worried about you. We all are.""

""Worried?"" I laughed, harsh and broken. ""Like you were worried about Camille all these years?""

""That girl was never right for you."" Mother's voice hardened. ""Rose, on the other hand...""

""Stop."" I stood, unsteady. ""Just... stop.""

""Stefan Rodriguez, you will not speak to me that way. I raised you better...""

""Did you?"" The words exploded out of me. ""You raised me to what? String along a woman who loved me while pining for her sister? Listen to you tear her down at every opportunity?""

Mother stepped back, shocked. In twenty eight years, I'd never raised my voice to her.

""Everything she did was wrong, wasn't it?"" I continued, the scotch making me brave. ""Her clothes, her manners, her cooking. Nothing was ever good enough. But Rose... Rose was perfect.""

""Because she understands our world! She...""

""She understands manipulation."" The truth hit me like a freight train. ""She played us all. You, me, Camille...""

""Don't be ridiculous."" Mother straightened her designer jacket. ""Rose loves you. She always has.""

Had she? Or had she loved the game more?

I remembered the cold calculation in her eyes when she'd orchestrated our ""chance"" meetings after returning from London. 

The way she'd encouraged Camille's insecurities while playing the supportive sister.

Even our reunion two months ago felt staged now. The charity gala, Camille conveniently ""sick,"" Rose in that dress I'd loved in Rome...

""Mother."" I sank back into my chair, suddenly exhausted. ""Please leave.""

""Stefan...""

""Go. Tell Rose... tell her..."" What? That I was sorry? That I finally saw through her perfect mask? That I'd destroyed my marriage for a fantasy she'd carefully crafted?

Mother left, her disappointment hanging in the air like expensive perfume. Like Rose's perfume. Like all the artificial, manipulated pieces of this life I'd chosen.

My phone lit up with another message. Rose again: ""Darling, stop being dramatic. Come home. To me.""

Home.

I looked around my office, at the shattered glass and scattered papers. At Camille's wedding photo, her genuine smile now seeming like an accusation.

What had I done?

Chapter 5 CAMILLE'S POINT OF VIEW 005
The parking garage of the hotel where i lodged was too quiet. My heels echoed against concrete, each click bouncing off empty cars and shadowed pillars.

It was late, past midnight, but something felt wrong. Off.

My confrontation with Rose and my family had left me drained, empty except for the cold satisfaction of finally seeing behind her mask. 

I fumbled with my key fob, wanting nothing more than to get to my hotel room and plan my next move.

A car door slammed somewhere in the darkness.

I stopped, listening. Nothing but the hum of fluorescent lights and the distant sound of traffic.

My phone buzzed in my purse. Rose's number. I declined it, but not before noticing my signal had dropped to one bar.

Perfect.

Footsteps behind me. Multiple sets.

I walked faster, cu**ing my choice of heels. The hotel's elevator was just around the corner, past a row of concrete pillars. If I could just...

""Going somewhere, Mrs. Rodriguez?""

A man stepped out from behind a pillar. Tall, broad-shouldered, dressed in black. Professional. Two more appeared behind me, cutting off my retreat.

Not a random attack, then.

""Actually, it's Ms. Lewis now."" My voice stayed steady despite my racing heart. ""And I have a dinner reservation, so if you'll excuse me...""

The first man smiled. It wasn't a nice smile. ""I'm afraid your plans have changed.""

I gripped my purse tighter, feeling for the pepper spray I'd started carrying after signing the divorce papers. ""Did my sister send you? Or was it Stefan?""

""Our employer prefers to remain anonymous."" He stepped closer. ""Now, we can do this the easy way...""

I didn't let him finish. The pepper spray caught him directly in the eyes.

He screamed, stumbling backward. I ran, kicking off my heels as I sprinted for the elevator. The other two men shouted, their footsteps thundering behind me.

Almost there. Just a few more...

Pain exploded in my scalp as someone grabbed my hair, yanking me backward. My purse went flying, contents scattering across the concrete.

""That wasn't very nice."" The first man's voice was rough with pain and rage. ""Hold her.""

Strong hands gripped my arms. I fought, kicking, scratching, but they were too strong. Professional. Trained.

""Our employer said you might be difficult."" The first man wiped his streaming eyes. ""Said you needed to learn your place.""

Rose. This had Rose written all over it. Her parting shot, making sure I understood just how powerless I really was.

""If you're going to k**l me,"" I spat, ""at least have the guts to look me in the eyes.""

He laughed. ""K**l you? No, no. Just a message. A reminder of what happens to people who don't know when to let go.""

The first punch caught me in the stomach, driving the air from my lungs. I doubled over, gasping, but the men holding me kept me upright.

""See, some people don't understand their role in life."" Another blow, this one to my ribs. ""Some people need to be taught...""

I tasted bl**d. My vision blurred, pain shooting through my body. But I wouldn't cry. Wouldn't give Rose the satisfaction.

""That's enough.""

The voice cut through the garage like a whip crack. Female. Authoritative.

My attackers tensed. Through swollen eyes, I saw dark figures emerging from the shadows. Men in suits, moving with military precision. And behind them...

A woman. Tall, elegant, probably in her fifties but with an ageless quality about her. 

She wore a black designer suit that probably cost more than my car, her silver hair swept into a perfect chignon.

But it was her eyes that caught me. Sharp, intelligent, and oddly... familiar.

""Ma'am,"" one of my attackers started, ""our employer...""

""Is about to have a very bad day."" The woman's voice was ice. ""Release her. Now.""

The hands holding me disappeared. I slumped forward, pain shooting through my ribs.

""Secure them."" The woman's command sent her men moving. My attackers didn't even try to run. They knew better.

She walked toward me, heels clicking on concrete. Designer shoes. Probably cost more than my monthly rent.

""Camille Lewis."" Not a question. She knew exactly who I was.

I tried to straighten, to maintain some dignity despite my split lip and torn dress. ""Do I know you?""

Her eyes softened, just slightly. Like she was seeing something, someone else in my face.

""No."" She gestured, and more men appeared with a medical kit. ""But I knew someone very much like you, once. Someone who also had to learn the hard way about trust and betrayal.""

The world was getting fuzzy around the edges. Blood dripped onto my ruined dress, each breath sending knives through my ribs.

""Who..."" I swayed, darkness creeping in. ""Who are you?""

She stepped forward, catching me as my knees buckled. This close, I could smell her perfume, something expensive, unique. Something that tickled at the edges of my memory.

""Someone who's been watching you for a very long time, Camille."" Her voice seemed to come from far away. ""Someone who's going to help you become everything they tried to prevent.""

The darkness was winning now. 

But before it took me completely, I heard her last words: ""After all... you look just like my daughter ",1,1757117376.0,FreeBookLinks,0,1.0,False
1n9laa3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n9laa3,Photo dump of how I‚Äôve been traveling with the Pakt Aero 35L,"Hey y'all! So I‚Äôve taken the Aero on a handful of trips since my first post [(here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1lm0ite/maiden_voyage_with_the_pakt_aero_35l/). I was initially lukewarm but I‚Äôve come around to really liking it. Instead of writing a novel-length review\*, I thought I‚Äôd show you how I actually traveled with it, what worked for me, and what might not work for you.

A quick note on each photo:

1. Nothing much to add here. I don‚Äôt necessarily think it's the ‚Äúsexiest‚Äù looking bag, but it is looking pretty sharp! 
2. Quick trip to Olympic National Park. I initially wanted more anchor points but I learned I didn‚Äôt need them. Side pocket is holding a beefy 36oz Yeti.
3. Walked \~1 mile/1.6km in \~80F/25C weather. Not great ventilation. 
4. Work trip to DC. Needed a ‚Äúprofessional office bag,‚Äù so I sandwiched a Filson Original Briefcase inside. It fit perfectly but it made me wish I could remove the laptop sleeve. That would‚Äôve been chefs kiss ü§åüèª
5. Fully loaded here. Looks thicc but not bad at all.
6. Side-by-side with a Cotopaxi Allpa 35. The Aero is a hair fuller but doesn‚Äôt look as ‚Äúsoggy‚Äù as the Allpa. 
7. I‚Äôm not sure but I suspect the internal grid system here helps keep the Aero‚Äôs shape. 
8. The front pocket fits the Stash Tote perfectly which I ended up bringing on all my trips. 
9. The tote stash came in clutch as a work bag when at a Williamsburg coffee shop.
10. Comes in handy on laundry days too.
11. Here‚Äôs the Aero after a bunch of traveling. Still looking good and I‚Äôm excited to keep putting miles on it. Happy to answer any questions about the Aero!

1n9l9ov,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/1n9l9ov/parent_always_sleeping/,Parent always sleeping?,"I'm a 61 year old never married woman.  My mom is 91.  I have my own condo two miles from my mother's house. I left it to live with her when I had a slab leak and need major construction, which took about 4 months.  That was in 2022.  But before I ever moved back to the condo, my mom suddenly needed a pacemaker.  Then at the end of last year, she needed sudden hospitalization.  She had some sort of seizure, had an ecoli infection and some congestive heart failure.  Until that hospital visit in December, she would take a few naps a day but still continued with her favorite pass time, which was reading. She read quickly and would read about one novel a week.

Now her routine is to get up late, eat, sleep on the couch, eat lunch, sleep on the couch again, maybe have cookies and coffee, and sleep again until I have dinner made.  She stopped attending church on Sundays.  I always drove.  The only thing we do outside the house now is eat out at a fast food place on Saturday evenings, occasionally with extended family that live locally.

I'm on top of her meds and doctor's appointments.  She uses oxygen but only at night.  She used it all the time the first four months after hospitalization.  She hated it and we eventually realized that she could go for hours with no ill effects.

She has basically ""checked out"" and admits she's ready to leave this world. 

We do watch some tv, Netflix or Amazon for a few hours in the evening.

My older brother (63) lives about 9 miles away and is basically retired, since his employer closed offices in California.  He lives with his working wife and sons in their early 20's.  He relieves me once a week for about 6 hours.

My problem is that I'm LONELY.  My three closest friends live out of state.  I haven't tried to date in 6 years and definitely couldn't now.  I have socialized exactly one time in 2025 with people unrelated to me.  I'm only ""employed"" by my mom. I get money for my basic bills with not a lot left over.  (My condo and car are paid for, thankfully.) This situation does benefit me in some ways financially.  By not having to pay for outside help, Mom can save some money and we can keep her house, which is willed to my brother and me, and that will definitely help me in the future financially.

But some days I feel like I'm dying inside.  Some of my spark has died.  I could cry right now.  I just don't know how to change anything.  Mostly I wanted to vent and see if anyone else is in a similar situation.

Thank you for reading.

She has many stage 5 dementia symptoms, but no formal diagnosis.  Earlier this year, a cancerous mass was discovered in her colon.  She is not pursuing curative treatment.  She's decided on palliative care for comfort only.

About 3 months ago my husband and I moved in to my Mum's house to care for her. Up to that time, my Mum was living on her own with the assistance of my sister and myself.  We co-ordinated between ourselves to visit our Mum 3 times a day to administer her meds, make sure she had something to eat, help her bathe, and do a bit of domestic chores.  Then Mum had a fall.  She spent 3 weeks in hospital, and couldn't return home unless someone was living there with her.

As part of moving in to my Mum's house, we brought our streaming music system \[Brand name excluded\].  We have background music playing throughout the house all day.  The music channel we usually select plays songs from the 50s, 60s and 70s.  Mum really enjoys listening to all the familiar tunes.

Every now and then, a particular song will take her mind back to events long ago. When this happens, she is so overwhelmed by the clarity of the memory that it brings her to tears.  She tells me she's crying because even though she can't remember things that happened 10 minutes ago, the memories instigated by a song are crystal clear.  Like she is back there when it occurred.

This morning when Mum woke, I gave her meds, and made us some coffees.  We sat in her room together, looking out the front and chatting about the neighbours.  As always, there was music playing in the background.  I went to the kitchen to make myself a second cup.  In the process of making my coffee, I heard my Mum sobbing with distress.  I rushed to see if she was in pain.  No pain.  Moon River by Henry Mancini was playing.  She was back in time, dancing with my Dad.",6,1757117083.0,dementia,4,1.0,False

I'm 46F and today was my first colonoscopy. 

Two days before the procedure, I cut back on food significantly. On prep day, I followed my provider‚Äôs instructions, which were *very* different from what I‚Äôd seen online and on Reddit. My prep called for just FOUR doses of Miralax, each mixed into 8 oz of clear liquid, and four Dulcolax tablets. We found my husband's prep instructions from last year, and he took FOURTEEN doses. I ended up taking a total of six. I also drank about three-quarters of a gallon of water, a soda, and a cup of tea. 

It took SIX HOURS from when I started the prep for anything to happen. I started the prep at 2 PM, first bowel movement around 8 PM. I only ended up going about 4-6 times between last night and this morning. It didn't seem like very much, and I never reached the ‚Äúclear‚Äù stage. In fact, things looked less clear this morning than last night and there were a few small mucousy solids mixed it. That worried me enough that I called my doctor‚Äôs office as soon as they opened. The nurse reassured me that it wasn‚Äôt unusual and said as long as there were ‚Äúno large chunks,‚Äù (yuck) I‚Äôd be fine. 

My procedure was scheduled for noon today, and by then I hadn‚Äôt had solid food for over 40 hours‚ÄîI was starving. They said I could have clear liquids up to four hours before the procedure, so I got to have coffee this morning. I mentioned my concerns again to my doctor, and he told me that if my prep wasn‚Äôt good enough, we‚Äôd just try again in a few months with a different prep - pretty much the last thing I wanted to do. 

Afterward, my doctor called my husband and told him it went great. The prep had worked well, I was clean, and I had stressed myself out for nothing. On the drive home, I had excruciating stomach pain from gas. That worked itself out (literally) when I got home.

I did have one polyp removed and I'm on a five-year schedule because my dad had colon cancer. Next time around, I think I'll start prepping at least a day earlier so I'm less stressed out.",2,1757116313.0,colonoscopy,2,1.0,False

One day, I heard my Spirit Guide Merlin tell me to stop reading for him and the next time he called, I said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, but Merlin said I can‚Äôt read for you anymore.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause, you never listen, so what is the point. I'm sorry but if it was up to me, I would read for you even though you never listen because you pay my rent every month, but I do listen and if Merlin says, I can‚Äôt read for you then I can‚Äôt read for you.‚Äù  

This actor literally did pay my rent every month, so, I asked Merlin, ‚ÄúNow, what am I going to do for money?‚Äù  I heard, ‚ÄúGo to the Coffee Bean in Malibu and do three-minute readings for free.‚Äù¬†

I went to The Coffee Bean in Malibu and did three minute readings for free every weekend for a month.¬†  I came home one day and said, ‚ÄúLook Merlin, I need to make some money.¬† Where you are, you don‚Äôt have to pay rent, but I do.  I need someone to help me market and promote my gifts!!‚Äù¬†

Within an hour, I received a phone call from a young man  named John who informed me that he had accidentally come upon my website Goddess Central, then he said and these were his words exactly. ‚ÄúI really love helping psychics market and promote their gifts.¬† Have you heard of Keen?‚Äù¬†

Im going to stop by Dixie Knits Sat, but wanted to see if I could find any here. 
Im knitting Andrea Mowry's Half Fishmerman's Rib sweater. Its my first sweater and yes I now know how oblivious and stupid I was choosing this pattern, but here we are.

I've actually made a decent go of it, until I started running out of yarn. I am now going for a color block look, but need to frog some of each sleeve to get the cuffs the same color. 

And every time I frog and then put stitches back on, the 2nd row I work seems too spacious so I'm not doing it right but cant figure out how. 

Is there any way I could buy you a coffee to meet at a caf√© or brewery or Dixie Knits and have someone local show me how to put in a lifeline or how to unravel it and pick back up the stitches?

Making my first coffee stirrers floor and I knew going in I didn't want to cut these with scissors as I don't like the squished ends it makes. But also knew this would be frustrating cutting stick by stick. My ADHD kicked in and I looked around my admittedly messy workspace and saw popsicle stocks and painters tape and came up with this set up. Lined the sticks up on my cutters mat and taped them down in place with my painters tape. Then just held them down with my metal ruler and scored down the line of the ruler 2 times with my box cutter. After that I gently bent them in half (to avoid splintering on the end) and cut them the rest of the way through with scissors. It goes really fast and easily adjustable.

Just want to tie things together better. I would describe the desired aesthetic as mix of earthy, modern, boho. Many plants to come, especially by the windows! Also planning to put things up on the walls.

\-- Need to keep both couches for now and this is the orientation that seems to work best. Thoughts on cushions or blankets to tie the couches together better?

\-- Initially, tried putting dining table where the round coffee table is, but that nook is a very well lit area & prime real estate space that I would like to be more utilized. And the table fits so perfectly there!

\-- Planning to get a rug for where the green chair and round coffee table are - thoughts on colors that would complement the current furniture and tie the space together more?

\-- Should I get another accent chair to pair with the current green (might go in front of dining table)?

Other thoughts and ideas welcome!

I‚Äôm still paying $25/mo, but now I‚Äôm getting charged on my cc for orders that were supposedly free. At the counter, there‚Äôs no checkout with the barista ‚Äî they plug in the order, apply the discount, it goes to $0. No tap to pay. 

Blackbird support hasn‚Äôt responded in over a week and I‚Äôm going to start disputing all the charges on Monday if I don‚Äôt hear back from support. Coming here to ask:

Has something changed? Is anyone else having the same issue? If so, any positive outcome, or should I be grateful for a summer of (mostly) free lattes and be on my way?

	‚Ä¢	Neighborhoods to avoid (if any)

	‚Ä¢	Recommendations for food, coffee shops, and fun local spots


We took a day trip yesterday and explored downtown Santa Rosa and downtown Petaluma. We definitely liked Petaluma a bit more but we‚Äôd love to hear more from locals about what it‚Äôs like to actually live there.

The town of Spectral Lakes, Washington, is known for the glut of ghost stories choking the annals of our history. You can‚Äôt enter a single gift shop, motel, or museum without gaudy flyers advertising our ‚Äúghost tours‚Äù on every kiosk.

Most of the stories are relegated to Lake Spectral, the biggest of the town‚Äôs lakes, but I‚Äôve always felt a much deeper connection to Lullaby Lake, mostly because my Uncle Chung-Ho ran the summer camp there, and I lived near it for my whole childhood.

But after my brother was born, Dad got a job in Seattle, and we moved away for a while, only returning after I was sixteen.

The small town now thoroughly bored me. Staying at home wasn‚Äôt an option. Dad was always at work, and Mom moved back to Korea. So, having nothing better to do, my brother Ken was like a little gnat hovering around my head. Always asking me stupid questions or just generally invading my personal space.

I needed a summer job, and the local ‚Äòhaunted‚Äô roller rink wasn‚Äôt hiring. Uncle Chung-Ho threw me a lifeline, though. Offered to let me be a lifeguard for the late afternoon shift. Even let me stay in a cabin in the camp so I could be my own man.

There were ghost stories about Lullaby, of course. Before I‚Äôd moved away there were rumors floating around school about kids who walked into the lake to find lost toys and then, themselves, became lost. I wondered if it was a way to warn kids about the dangers of the water. Drowning wasn‚Äôt uncommon in a lakeside town.

The first few weeks of the job were easy. Kids who grew up around the lakes already knew how to swim, so I only had to worry about the visitors.

A couple kids needed help sometimes. Nothing serious took place. A few fights over toys resulted in tears, and I had to break up violent water gun battles, but it was a chill experience overall.

I even got to spend an almost intoxicating amount of time with the other lifeguard, Bethany, without my kid brother trying to butt in. She was another Spectral Lakes native. Once, when I was on-duty, she hung out with me despite her shift being over. I kept fidgeting with my whistle as she talked and scarcely dared to look at her blue-green eyes.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lucky you started this year. Last year sucked bad,‚Äù she said. She pulled at her black ponytail.

A couple kids tried to climb the giant log bobbing against the rope around the safe swimming area. They managed to hold on the slippery surface before the log slowly rotated, sending the kids laughing and splashing to their doom.

‚ÄúIt did? What happened?‚Äù I asked. The whistle‚Äôs lanyard was tight around my fingers.

‚ÄúA kid drowned. Snuck in after hours on a dare.‚Äù She adjusted herself on the wooden camp chair, the peeling paint stuck to her forearms. ‚ÄúThe morning lifeguard found him. He quit after.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh.‚Äù My finger went white, tangled in the lanyard. ‚ÄúMust have been awful to see.‚Äù

A few kids on the shore tried to skip rocks but kept throwing them way too close to the swimming area. I blew the whistle and got them to stop.

‚ÄúYeah. He told me something was really weird about the body.‚Äù

Her eyes looked far off, past the pine trees on the other side of the lake.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere were bruises around his ankles. Police said that his feet must have gotten tangled in debris.‚Äù A mosquito buzzed near her thigh. She didn‚Äôt seem to notice. ‚ÄúBut that lifeguard told me they looked more like hand marks.‚Äù

‚ÄúUncle never told me,‚Äù I said, brows raised.¬†

She shrugged. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt wanna scare you off, prolly.‚Äù She smiled. It was simple, almost put-on to lighten the mood. But still. I glanced away, cheeks red.¬†

It was good that I did. I noticed something.¬†

A blur of orange lurked under the water, near the border rope. A few fingers showed their tips above the surface before sinking down.

I jumped from the tower, grasping my rescue buoy before diving into the lake.

The freezing water cut against my skin.

I grabbed at the orange blur before me, fingers closing in on swimsuit fabric. I got a grip around a small arm with my other hand and dragged it to the surface.

The kid emerged in a huff. I propped her up on the buoy and towed her to land. She hacked up the water in her lungs.

The other kids stopped what they were doing and watched with mouths agape.

‚ÄúMr. Choi? Is she okay!?‚Äù asked a friend of hers.

‚ÄúHA! Katie can‚Äôt swim!‚Äù jeered one of the asshole kids.

Katie‚Äôs red eyes bloomed with tears.¬†

‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúMy Barbie‚Äôs gone‚Ä¶ I dropped her and tried to get her back. She‚Äôs gone forever!‚Äù Before a fresh batch of wails erupted from her.

I looked down. Could have sworn her ankles looked red, too. But before I could get a better look, Bethany descended on her, waves of comforting words coming from her lips as she put an arm ‚Äòround Katie‚Äôs shoulder.

‚ÄùDo you want a Sonic popsicle? I got one in the freezer,‚Äù offered Bethany.

Katie wiped at her red eyes and gave a nod as she wheezed.

I reported the incident to her parents and my Uncle. After what felt like hours of my Uncle and I calming down her hysterical mother over the phone, it was twilight on the lake. I went to my little cabin (which wasn‚Äôt much more than a small bedroom and bath) and slipped out of my swim trunks.

‚ÄùOh, shit,‚Äù I said as I put my lifeguard gear away.

My whistle was missing. It was a cheap little thing, but Uncle Chung-Ho was cheap about replacing stuff. I walked back to the lake to comb the shore for it, but it was getting real dark so I figured I‚Äôd just find it in the morning and stopped.

After dinner, I settled into bed and a wave of exhaustion overtook me. I got a text from Ken about how he ate Takis that day and liked them. For some reason he kept using my dad‚Äôs phone to update me on random things.

Usually I‚Äôd play gatcha games or something before I slept, but I could barely keep my eyes open, so I just let myself drift off.

**\~\~\~**

I felt cold water all around me. My eyes were frozen shut, so my body just floated in blackness for a while.

I kicked my legs without knowing where I was going, and something wet and slimy curled around my ankle. I screamed. Even after kicking vigorously, it just stayed firmly in place, as if it‚Äôd been tied there to anchor me to the lakebed.¬†

Lakebed. That was it. It must have been a lake plant, and if it was, the opposite direction was my ticket out of the water.

I tried to calm myself and bend down to pull away the weeds, but knew my breath wasn‚Äôt going to last much longer. My heartbeat thumped in my ears. The rubbery weed was tough to tear through, and my fingers refused to bend in the cold. I kept trying to force my eyes to open, but they wouldn‚Äôt. The darkness grew more oppressive as air leaked from my lungs.

I pulled myself down the weed like a reverse climbing rope. My nails dug into its roots, sand getting stuck under them. I tried planting my feet on the sand and pulling it out, but nothing seemed to work.

The more effort I used, the more breath left my body. The water started to feel like a vice pushing and crushing me inward even as my nerves numbed. My joints started to refuse my brain‚Äôs orders. I grew listless, consciousness fading.

I began to feel impossible things in my last moments. I thought I could smell my mom‚Äôs cooking. But it was just water pouring into my nose. I heard her laugh. But it was just bubbles rushing into my ears and bloodstream.

My limp body floated for minutes. I thought I was dead. But I still heard a weak heartbeat through it all. Every pulse of blood in my limbs was like a needle jamming life into a block of ice.

Something touched me, almost like hair. Or one of those sheer fabrics that people use to wrap bouquets. It gently washed across my shin, then again at my feet. Then it was gone. And I heard my whistle.

I knew it was my whistle because my brother had banged it up, and it never sounded quite right after that. But there it was, echoing through the water. And that sound, somehow, got me to move.

I could move. It was impossible, but I could, despite my body being weighed down by the lake‚Äôs water that now filled it. The weed relaxed, freeing my leg. I finally could open my eyes.

It was still dark, but I could make out some of what was around me. There was the awful weed that‚Äôd trapped me. The lakebed scattered with plantlife and litter. And at my feet was the most surprising thing. The toy Katie had lost.

It was a Barbie doll with a fabric mermaid tail. The fins must have been what brushed me earlier. Her painted face looked up at me, smile wide but eyes sad, like she missed her owner.

I picked her up. She didn‚Äôt want to be here.

The whistle screamed again. It came from deeper in the lake. The lakebed curved into a darker valley.

I decided to follow the whistle.¬†

My lungs were full of water, and my feet walked on the lakebed like I was a spaceman on the surface of Mars. So clearly, this was a dream. *Why should I worry about getting to the surface now? May as well see where this goes.*

I tread through the ice-cold environment. The valley went deeper and deeper, through areas the moonlight struggled to pierce. Still, I wandered, guided by that eerie sound.¬†

To the left lay an old toy diving ring. To my right, a sunk fishing dinghy. I stepped on a broken bottle and cursed, bubbles erupting from my mouth. A trail of blood floated up from my heel. Still, I kept walking.

Soon it was too dark to see, so I stopped. The full brunt of what was happening here was at the edge of crashing down on my psyche.¬†

A light was visible in the distance. Cold and blue.¬†

I walked toward it.¬†

I heard the whistle again. It was followed by a choir of whispering laughs.

Dark shapes were outlined in the light. Man-made structures. I couldn‚Äôt make them out yet‚Ä¶

The Barbie in my hand hadn‚Äôt changed expression, it was a doll, I told myself. But somehow, she looked scared. It‚Äôs stupid to admit, but I hugged her close to give myself even an ounce of comfort as that blue light grew brighter.

Amongst those dark shapes, I thought I saw something white move, flitting from one shape to the other. I strained my eyes to focus, but my sight, despite the light getting brighter, was blurring more and more.

The feeling of drowning began to overtake me again. I clutched the doll as I bent forward. I coughed violently, as if trying to hack the whole lake out of my lungs.

Darkness pressed in on my vision. The whistle‚Äôs cry cut off suddenly.

The last thing I saw before blackness overtook me was a white face highlighted in blue.

**\~\~\~**

I woke up with a lot more coughing. It felt like it took a half hour before I could properly breathe again. My bed was soaked, like I‚Äôd sweated out all the soda I‚Äôd drank yesterday.¬†

I noticed my door was unlocked. I quickly locked it and stumbled to the bathroom.

*What a terrible night.* I shoved my bedsheets into a bag. They really needed to be washed.

I walked out of my cabin and headed for the laundry. The lake was as beautiful as ever in the morning light, but I felt a sudden aversion when looking at it that I‚Äôd never experienced before.

Yawning, I continued down the shoreline in my sandals (which I could hardly feel with how numb my feet were), when a speck of hot pink caught my eye.¬†

A mermaid Barbie perched on the sand. Water lapped up at her fins. She smiled, her stiff plastic arms pointed up at the sky.

And beside her, almost dissolved amongst the sand, were bloody footprints leading out of the water.

I looked down at my foot. Blood had pooled at the bottom of my sandal.

**\~\~\~**

I didn‚Äôt want to go to my shift that day. I used the first aid station to patch up my cut foot, but I kept shivering whenever I caught even a glimpse of the lake now.

Of course, I didn‚Äôt tell Uncle Chung-Ho the real reason I didn‚Äôt wanna do it. I just blamed it on my injury.

‚ÄùWell, you can still walk, can‚Äôt you?‚Äù He said to me while I nervously stood in his office. ‚ÄúYou can use your eyes? You can swim?‚Äù He gave me a look.

I shrugged.

‚ÄùI could have used that cabin of yours to store more tubes. Now I gotta keep them in the cafe. You know how hard it is for me to make coffee when there‚Äôs 50 giant rubber inflatable donuts in there?‚Äù

‚ÄùIt‚Äôs not like kids drink much coffee anyway.‚Äù

He gave me another look as he pointedly unscrewed the lid of his thermos and took a long gulp of decaf. He wiped his chin and raised his brows. ‚ÄùThe least you can do for me is do your job with a little cut on your foot.‚Äù

‚ÄùYeah, yeah‚Ä¶‚Äù My eyes fixed themselves on the patchy carpet before I dared to speak the next words. ‚ÄúBut... you know... hazard pay would be nice...‚Äù

Chung-Ho glared at me with the concentrated power only an Asian uncle could. ‚ÄúNoah. Remember what happened right before you moved away?‚Äù

I shrugged, trying to figure out where this was going.

‚ÄúThe fancy playground I‚Äôd *just bought* went missing! The whole thing! I got it with a loan I‚Äôm still trying to pay off. Now you want to get paid? You don‚Äôt want me to go bankrupt, do you?‚Äù

I shrugged again, regretting saying anything about getting paid. The memory of that incident came back to me now. On reflection, it was really weird. The whole playground was stolen, the only bits remaining being some leftover screws and wagon wheel tracks that went straight into the lake. Police said there was only evidence of a singular thief, and that he‚Äôd worked through the night disassembling it and bringing the pieces onto a boat.

‚ÄúNo, Uncle Chung-Ho. I don‚Äôt want that. I was just joking.‚Äù

‚ÄúJokes should be funny, Noah.‚Äù

I walked out of his office, wincing even as I stepped lightly.¬†

**\~\~\~**

Already feeling sufficiently emasculated by the way I‚Äôd hugged that doll last night, I was desperate to hide my trembling when I took over Bethany‚Äôs shift later that day.

I failed.

‚ÄùYou alright, Noah?‚Äù She looked me up and down after she‚Äôd descended the lifeguard tower.

‚ÄùIt‚Äôs kind of cold today, huh?‚Äù I pressed my shivering hands to my sides.

‚ÄùNot‚Ä¶ really.‚Äù Bethany unwrapped a fresh popsicle, which was already dripping.

‚ÄúPrincess Seafoam!!‚Äù A sudden squeal mercifully ended the conversation. Katie spotted the Barbie poking out of my tote and immediately gave the doll what would have been a bone-breaking hug.

‚ÄúUh, yeah. I found it on the beach this morning,‚Äù I said, shifting my weight away from my cut foot.

‚ÄùTHANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!‚Äù Katie jumped up and down. She wore her campground clothes, not her swimsuit. Probably not in the mood to swim. I sympathized.¬†

‚ÄúIf you hadn‚Äôt saved her, she was gonna get taken by the weeds!‚Äù Katie said, shaking her head and petting the doll‚Äôs hair.

*Weeds?* I wondered, heart thumping. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúLullaby weeds take toys down deep.‚Äù she said matter-of-factly. ‚ÄúMaybe the lake likes to play with them. I dunno.‚Äù

Before I could ask anything else, she ran off towards her cabin.

‚ÄùGood on ya. That mermaid coulda drowned.‚Äù Bethany said. My shivers ceased as I looked at her warm smile. I climbed up the lifeguard tower with a salute.

There were a lot of kids out that day. Coupled with the fear from last night‚Äôs... dream, it made the job much more stressful than usual. With my whistle gone, I almost lost my voice from yelling so much. My eyes kept darting from kid to kid, trying to make sure every head dipped underwater for a normal amount of time.

Bethany decided to stay with me again. I liked the company. But when she talked with me or tried to show me some videos on her phone, I kept my eyes on the water.

She reached up and tugged on my trunks to get my attention, then offered me a Powerpuff Girls popsicle. I just smiled and accepted it without turning my head.

It took all my strength to keep this up, but I couldn‚Äôt let myself get distracted. Whenever I glanced away from the swimmers, my thoughts flashed back to the feeling of water surging up my nostrils and the heaviness that came with waterlogged lungs. I imagined finding the bodies of children floating up to the surface.

*Shit. There*. A kid way out whirled his arms and gasped, his head bobbing on the surface.

Bethany followed my gaze and leapt to her feet.

Before I could move, she said: ‚ÄúI got this. You played the hero yesterday.‚Äù She grabbed my rescue buoy and made a graceful dive into the water.¬†

I called everyone out of the lake. A mass of kids gave disappointed signs and made their way to the shore.

In the span of several tense seconds, Bethany swam over to the drowning kid. But before she could reach him, he sank under the water. Bethany took a deep breath, following after him.

Seconds passed.

And then more.

Then more.¬†

Something was wrong. I jumped forward, but somehow my trunks caught fast on a nail head. My body lurched down, the threads broke, and I painfully landed at the base of the lifeguard tower. My shoulder ached, andI wondered if it was dislocated. I spat out sand and stumbled to my feet before managing a beeline towards the water.

My shoulder crying in protest, I swam as fast as I could.

Just before I went down, Bethany breached the water, gasping and sputtering, her face awash in fear.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt find him!‚Äù

I pulled goggles over my eyes and dove. Terror sunk its claws into me as the water overtook my head. I tried my best to push it all away as I frantically searched for the boy.

He‚Äôd been wearing black swim trunks, which were frustratingly hard to spot in a lake.

I went deeper until I found the silty bottom.

*There. In the weeds.*

A pale face shone between the green strands. Small bubbles of air burbled between blue lips.¬†

Muscles aching for air, I tore through the weeds until the boy was free. Propping him under my arm, I propelled myself off the lakebed and shot towards the surface.

The next few minutes were some of the worst of my life.

Bethany called for Uncle Chung-Ho and the ambulance.¬†

CPR training forced itself to the front of my mind. All of my energy went into compressions. I didn‚Äôt want to break the kid‚Äôs sternum, but the water just wasn‚Äôt coming out.

We screamed at the kids on the shore to go back to their cabins, but they didn‚Äôt move, just staring in horror at their friend‚Äôs blue skin.

I sang to myself, using it to keep time on the compressions while calming my own heart from stopping.

Every second felt agonizing.

His eyes didn‚Äôt move under his lids.

This was my fault.

I hadn‚Äôt been paying enough attention.

I was so overtaken by fear that I almost didn‚Äôt notice when he started coughing.

The kid retched out dirty lake water, turning on his side as bile burst from his throat and onto the warm dirt.

When the color returned to his face, I started to cry.

**\~\~\~**

My uncle congratulated me warmly.

I felt cold. Two close calls in a row was two too many.

Bethany didn‚Äôt talk much after the kid was handed over to EMTs. I could tell she was in shock. She went home looking pale.

As I got back into my cabin‚Äôs bed, I rubbed my sore shoulder while I waited for the pain meds to kick in.¬†

I wondered if I could sleep after all that had happened. I slipped out of bed to make sure my door was locked. I stood there for a moment. Looked out my windows at the lake.

I closed the blinds.

My phone buzzed.

‚Äúwow im playing mario now. hes cool. i like the turtles -Ken‚Äù¬†

How much access did Dad let this kid have to his phone, anyway?

The rest of my messages were filled with notifications for new events in my gacha games, so I tried to get my mind off things by playing a bit. But while my character rode around in search of pngs to gamble for, I soon slipped out of consciousness, the relaxing music taking me deep into the fathoms below.

**\~\~\~**

That blue light again.

It shone cold before me.¬†

Back under the waves, my toes dug into the sand of the lakebed, standing right where I‚Äôd drifted off the night before. My senses were flooded with water seeping through every nook and cranny of my being.

I shuddered, which caused ripples of water to disturb the sand, pushing it back in gentle eddies.

The whistle sounded again. Much closer. The blue light and blackened shapes beckoned.

I walked towards them. One plodding step at a time. And then, the shapes finally crystallized into identifiable architecture.

This was a little town. Well, not an actual sunken town. I‚Äôd seen pictures of those on the internet before and they were a lot bigger than this. This was something different. It almost looked like it‚Äôd been built here. Under the water. Not flooded.

Several small buildings stood ramshackle, their doorways barely taller then my legs. Made of driftwood, they looked hammered together with clumsy hands. The biggest ‚Äòbuildings‚Äô, if you could call them that, were made from the hulls of upside-down boats. A few were modern speedboats and the like, but a lot were much older. Like an 1800s logging raft. Or a fishing dinghy. Doorways were carved out of them, and they were all decorated in some form or fashion.

One little hut had tiny shells stuck around the doorframe. Smooth stones made tiny pathways between houses. Another structure was lined with fishing nets braided into curious patterns. The bones of various fish stuck out of a boat‚Äôs hull like a gruesome mohawk.

Some of these buildings had large, misshapen balloon-like things tied to them, which floated a distance from the light, so I couldn‚Äôt make out exactly what they were.

Lost toys were placed around as if this was their home. An old porcelain doll covered in moss stood at a shop counter as if preparing to sell her wares. Her hair floated in a cloud around her, but the lack of a current made it as still as a picture.

I saw plastic construction toys near one hut. Broken G.I. Joes stuck in the sand like a battalion ready to shoot me. A crab curled under the cup of a chipped tea set.

The source of the blue light was a large old fisherman‚Äôs lantern. The kind that‚Äôd be used to ward sailors from the lakeshore at night.

It illuminated the centerpiece of the little town--a playground. This was the only piece that wasn‚Äôt makeshift. It was a whole Costco playground with a slide and everything.¬†

This was Uncle Chung-Ho‚Äôs.

I started when tiny white hands gripped the bars. A pink beaded bracelet circled one wrist. I couldn‚Äôt identify the face of its owner. It was wreathed in darkness.¬†

My heartbeat thumped in my ears. Water clogged my throat. I tried to speak. No bubbles came forth this time.¬†

‚ÄúWho--are--?‚Äù I managed. But I sounded too garbled to be anywhere understandable.

The hands slowly uncurled from the playground bars and slunk back into the gloom. Then, with an unsteady, waving motion, one hand appeared again under the blue light.

It held my whistle.

I breathed water in and out, each breath longer and more painful. I stepped closer to the hand, though every nerve told me to run away. Where would I run to? This was a dream. It had to be. I needed to find out who was haunting it.

My fingers touched the ice-cold metal of the whistle.

The hand didn‚Äôt move. I couldn‚Äôt pull the whistle from its frozen fingers. And the closer I looked at them, the more I could see that they were swollen.

The hand pulled itself closer to its body, moving me with it. A face appeared in the gloom, motes of silt floating about the dead skin.

Bloated, misshapen lips pulled themselves over small teeth as a whispering girl‚Äôs voice pried itself in the folds of my brain.

‚Äú*Stop saving them*.‚Äù

**\~\~\~**

I awoke at the edge of the lake.

It was just before dawn. The lake was completely quiet. I stood there for a moment, in shock, watching the water crawl up to touch my feet, as if beckoning me back down with it. Up... and back... up... and...

In the early morning light, it was hard to discern anything. But I started to see little shapes in the waves, gently swaying with the tide, bobbing up and pulling me back.

They looked like children‚Äôs fingers.

I staggered back from the shoreline as the full brunt of everything I‚Äôd been through hit me. I threw up silty water, my stomach‚Äôs contents making a mess of the beach chairs beside my cabin.

‚ÄúS-son of a bitch...‚Äù I said between retches.¬†

All the water was finally out of my body, but I still felt the slimy pond algae mucking up my throat and nose. I retreated into my cabin and drank a few cans of soda to try and wash it down, then gargled a bottle of mouthwash. I showered and scrubbed every last part of myself I could find.

I still felt nasty inside. I sensed silt inside the crannies of my bloodstream. Sand in between the joints of my bones. It was like the lake itself had infected me totally.

I sat in the corner of my room next to my heater, my blanket pulled over my shivering body. Nothing warmed me up.

The hands of the clock ticked by. Lunchtime was coming soon. The first group would be heading to the lake for free time after they ate, where Bethany would watch them.

I thought of the whispered words I‚Äôd heard last night, and burst out of my cabin, heading for my Uncle‚Äôs office.

It took several lies to get him to shut down swimming that day. I insisted I‚Äôd seen teenagers sneak onto the property and throw used needles onto the beach. I also reasoned it was a good idea to keep the kids out of the water for now, out of respect for the incidents yesterday.

My uncle agreed, and announced the news over the PA system to the disappointment of the kids. He was impressed with my maturity, he said.

I didn‚Äôt feel noble. Just scared.¬†

Uncle told me he‚Äôd ask the janitors to take care of things when they came tonight. Didn‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd say to him when they didn‚Äôt find anything. How would I keep this up for even a few more days? Would I have to pollute the lake myself?

I said my goodbyes and started back to my cabin.¬†

On the way, I saw Bethany walk away from the lake dressed in her lifeguard swimsuit and a pair of sweatpants. I caught her eye and she sidled up to me.

‚ÄùBummer about the lake. We‚Äôre still gonna get paid, right?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúYou are. I get paid with food and shelter.‚Äù

‚ÄùIs that legal?‚Äù

‚ÄùAccording to Choi family law.‚Äù

She chuckled. But I could tell her heart wasn‚Äôt in it. She looked distracted.¬†

‚ÄúBy the way. Since you‚Äôre not doing anything right now‚Ä¶‚Äù

I stood up straight, my fingers tangling up with one another.

‚Äù‚Ä¶Could you do something for me?‚Äù

‚ÄùWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄùI need to restock the popsicle freezer. Your uncle doesn‚Äôt want to bother with it right now. But you‚Äôve seen how much the kids like it. I mean, a dessert freezer right by the lake? It‚Äôs just so perfect, right, Noah?‚Äù

I gave a half-smile. ‚ÄúIs this request really for the kids, or just you?‚Äù

‚ÄùCome on. I‚Äôll pay you back.‚Äù She grinned. ‚ÄúChung-Ho wants me to stay on-site even if I‚Äôm not ‚Äòworking‚Äô.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt have a reason to stay at the camp anyway. The kids wouldn‚Äôt be swimming. Plus, getting away from it felt like a good idea, if only to try and stay sane. No excuses, I suppose‚Ä¶

‚ÄùAlright. I‚Äôll be back later.‚Äù

Bethany beamed. ‚ÄúCool. And make sure to get SpongeBob ones.‚Äù

‚ÄùAye aye, captain.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt have a car, but Spectral Lakes was small, so walking wasn‚Äôt a challenge. But my foot still ached, and it took about a half hour to get to the nearest crummy corner store. I leisurely scanned the shelves looking for ugly cartoon popsicles.

My phone buzzed in my pocket. I took it out and glanced at the screen.

‚ÄùSee u soon! -Ken‚Äù

My head tilted in confusion. What did he mean? I didn‚Äôt remember plans for him to come to the camp today.

Might have been a mistake. Or an old text that finally went through. I picked out a bunch of popsicles and swept them into my basket. I then was faced with the dilemma of how I was gonna keep them from melting in the long walk back. Hm. I added a bundle of ice to the order. Then a cooler. Then despaired at the state of my finances.

That‚Äôs when another text came.

‚Äùur not here :( o well. beth is waching me -Ken‚Äù

Okay, so that first text wasn‚Äôt a mistake. Something about this made me start to feel nervous. My brother was at camp being watched specifically by a lifeguard, not one of the counselors. I didn‚Äôt like the sound of that. Did my dad drop him off with my uncle? If so, he wouldn‚Äôt be swimming today, right? Even if Bethany was watching him, she knew the lake was closed. She wouldn‚Äôt break the rules.

I tried to shake off my anxiety, but it wouldn‚Äôt go. The shivering feeling from yesterday started again. I had to go back. Now.

I left my filled up basket at the door to the chagrin of the shopkeeper and ran down the road towards the camp.¬†

Why was it so far away?

As I sprinted, the cut on my foot opened up again. My footsteps trailed blood as I went, but I didn‚Äôt care. My panic was rising and drowning out every other feeling.

One car stopped when it saw me and a concerned woman poked her head out the window, asking if I was okay. I managed to convince her to drive me to the camp, insisting it was an emergency.

She nodded, shocked, and we drove the remaining five minutes. She asked if she needed to call 911, but I told her it was a family matter.

I made a beeline for the lakeside. My head swiveled around like an owl as I tried to find Ken. I didn‚Äôt see him or Bethany anywhere.

My trembling fingers tried to type on my phone.

‚ÄùKen, where are you?‚Äù

My dad texted back: ‚ÄúI dropped him off with your friend Bethany. They‚Äôre going for a swim.‚Äù

My heart dropped.

I looked out on the water. The swimming area was empty, save for a single toy floating on the surface. Ken‚Äôs boat.

I waded into the water. This was something I‚Äôd done the past few nights, even if I hadn‚Äôt been conscious of it.

I knew where Ken was. I had to go get him.

My fingers pierced the water as I dove. I went deeper and deeper, pressure popping my ears. The lake that was inside me felt like it responded to being back in the water. Currents carried me to the lakebed. Air bubbled out of me. The lake took over, and darkness encompassed my mind.

**\~\~\~**

I stood where I‚Äôd appeared last night. A good distance away from the underwater town. The blue light remained there like a star in the deep lake. I charged forward through the muck, my steps disturbing the silt and flinging it up into the stillness.

I thought I could hear something in the town ahead. A choir of whispers. A giggle.

My muscles strained against the pressure as I urged them to go faster. I almost stepped on that broken bottle again. Biting my lip, I picked it up and hid it behind my back.

As the forms of the little buildings finally came into focus, I saw something that made my blood run even colder.

In front of the sunken playground was Bethany. She had a smile on her face and sat cross-legged on the lakebed. A teacup touched her lips as she mimed drinking from it. Her eyes looked almost glazed over.

It was horrifying. But the thing she played with was even more so.

Across from Bethany sat the corpse of a little girl. It was wrapped in lakeweed, which drifted about her swollen white face like tendrils of living hair. Her eyes were gone, picked clean by lake scavengers. Flesh sloughed off of her body like smeared dough.¬†

What was left of her mouth pulled into a mockery of a smile. A giggle traveled through the water as her adipocere-laced hands poured ‚Äòtea‚Äô into Bethany‚Äôs cup.

‚ÄùWhere‚Äôs Ken!?‚Äù I screamed at the two of them as best I could. Somehow my words carried in the water, despite my empty lungs. It almost felt like the lake itself carried my intention.

Bethany and the corpse‚Äôs heads turned to face me, wreathed in cold blue light.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not ready to play yet.‚Äù Bethany said. She stood up and placed herself in front of the corpse protectively.

‚ÄùBethany, what‚Äîwhat are you doing?‚Äù

She was quiet.

‚ÄùI need my brother! Where IS HE?‚Äù I yelled.

Bethany‚Äôs ponytail spread out around her head in the gloom. It almost looked like a dark halo.

‚ÄùMy sister is lonely,‚Äù she said simply.

For the first time, I noticed, even through the layers of decomposition, that her and the corpse shared several traits. The black hair, the sharp brows, and‚Ä¶ matching beaded bracelets.¬†¬†

‚ÄúHow long has she been down here?‚Äù I whispered.

The corpse‚Äôs vacant eye sockets stared at me.

‚ÄùWe‚Äôre twins,‚Äù was all Bethany said.

I thought I could feel tears on my face, but the only indication of their existence was a bit of salt in the thousands of gallons of freshwater around me.

‚ÄùPlease. Where‚Äôs Ken?‚Äù I begged.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs staying. He doesn‚Äôt want to leave. It‚Äôs nice here.‚Äù Bethany‚Äôs face was still.

‚ÄùWhy don‚Äôt *you* stay and keep her company!?‚Äù I yelled. ‚ÄúKeep my brother out of it!‚Äù

Bethany didn‚Äôt answer. Instead, the piercing whisper of the corpse‚Äôs words dug into my brain.

‚ÄúShe brings me new friends.‚Äù

The sentence sent a violent shiver down my spine.¬†

In the shadowy doorways of the huts, I glimpsed the wavering, twisting forms of other small bodies. Watching me.

There was a boy with weeds tangling his feet. He carried the handles of a jumprope. A girl with a fish darting between her empty ribs slowly pushed a toy car back and forth.¬†

The ‚Äòballoons‚Äô I thought I‚Äôd seen last night weren‚Äôt that at all. The bodies of more children were there, floating upside down with weeds around their necks like a hanging seen from the lake‚Äôs reflection. They drifted in the water. Whispered to one another. Used the weed to pull themselves downward to the lakebed like I‚Äôd done the first night I‚Äôd been drowned.¬†

They moved silently, all drawing closer to me while hugging toys desperately to their chests as if those were the last bits of humanity left to them.

The freshest body was a boy with a campground wristband on his arm.¬†

I couldn‚Äôt move. Or even think.¬†

That‚Äôs when I heard a whistle blow.

I looked around for the source of the noise. It came from the largest hut, made from the hull of a wooden boat.

I moved past Bethany, who grabbed my wrist and pulled me to face her.

‚ÄùIt‚Äôs too late,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúGo home, Noah. Live. I like you.‚Äù

Her pale face moved closer to mine. Cold fingers touched my chin. Numb lips closed over my own.

I wrenched out of her grasp, squeezing so hard on her wrist that I heard a ‚Äòcrack‚Äô resound in the darkness. She cried out and fell to her knees.

I didn‚Äôt look back, charging into the large hut and gasping at the sight within.

Ken lay on a bed of weeds. He was still, eyes bleary, but I could see a whistle tucked between his teeth.¬†

I hovered over him, my face twisted in pain, looking for any sign of life.

In the perfect stillness of the lake bottom, there were only two things I could hear. My own heartbeat.

And Ken‚Äôs.

I hugged him. Then propped him up against my side and swam out of the boat.

Tens of dead eyes watched us. I quickly swam up, kicking my legs as fast as they would go.

Hundreds of little fingers closed in around my vision. I swam harder and harder. The water filling me weighed me down, but my heart gave life, if even a little, and I just outpaced the corpses.

That‚Äôs when I felt the weeds begin to wrap themselves around us. The girl‚Äôs whisper slunk into my thoughts.

‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt go.‚Äù

I wielded the broken bottle like a hunted cat swipes its claws. The glass tore away at the weeds one after the other. In my desperation, I cut my own legs, but it was worth it as we broke free and kept traveling upward.

‚ÄúNoah...!‚Äù

Bethany‚Äôs fingers closed around my ankle. I cut them, too.

I only glanced behind me for a second, but in that glimpse, I saw Bethany reach out for me again, and miss, desperately trying to reach us even as her wrist flopped at her side and blood bloomed from her other hand. Her face was twisted in pain and fear.

When the corpses realized that their intended prey was escaping their grasp, they instead moved to the easier prey.

They needed *someone* to stay with them.

All I heard was a gurgling scream slowly fading away behind me as I swam up.

My brother and I burst from the surface of the lake. We were a good distance from shore, and it took some time for me to finally propel us onto it. The entire time, we got lighter and lighter as we coughed out the lake.

As soon as we touched the dirt, we crawled as far as we could manage before rolling onto our backs, gulping down the precious pine-scented air.

The sight of the sunlight no longer filtered through cold water warmed my shivering body. I turned to look at Ken, who I could tell felt the same. He started to cry, and I hugged him. I patted his back to help him out as the remnants of the depths dribbled from his mouth. Flashbacks of when I burped him as a baby came to mind. That protective feeling of holding my newborn brother mirrored my current emotions as clearly as the reflections on the lake‚Äôs surface.

‚ÄúThank God, thank God...‚Äù I said into his hair as I held him close.

He started to try and speak.

‚ÄùI f-found your whistle‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI know. You did good.‚Äù

‚ÄúI knew it was yours cause I broke it...‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. That‚Äôs okay.‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt wanna be down there.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know. You‚Äôre out now. You‚Äôll be okay.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey--they didn‚Äôt have Takis down there. I think it would have sucked.‚Äù

I laughed. ‚ÄúYeah, buddy. You‚Äôre right.‚Äù

**\~\~\~**

All I told Uncle Chung-Ho the next day was that I was bored of the job and needed something that paid. He grumbled about it but I was let off the hook. Though, he did ask me a few times if I knew where Bethany went. She wouldn‚Äôt answer his calls. I told him I hadn‚Äôt heard from her either.

There was an investigation to find her, but nothing ever came up in the years that followed.

Ken doesn‚Äôt swim anymore, but besides that, he bounced back from what happened really well. He even started getting real good at biking. Resilience of youth, I guess.

I‚Äôm in college now, and decided to study in Korea. Stay with my mom and her family for a while.

Even now I can feel the lake when I‚Äôm across the world. I can sense the eddies of the sand move in the ripples of water. I listen to the lapping against the shoreline. Bethany‚Äôs laugh when she plays with her sister.

Sometimes I can hear when Ken throws old toys into Lake Lullaby.

Over the last decade, there has been a growing concern regarding the rising concentration and declining competition of the U.S. economy. Many people argue that we live in an era of ‚Äúmonopoly capitalism‚Äù ‚Äî with few firms holding immense economic and political power. You can hear that from the usual suspects ‚Äî¬†[Robert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLfO-2t1qPQ)¬†[Reich](https://robertreich.substack.com/p/why-are-we-still-suffering-inflation),¬†[Adam Conover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayrVYwoe-DY)¬†or even¬†[Joseph Stiglitz](https://rooseveltinstitute.org/blog/america-has-a-monopoly-problem-and-its-huge/). With these concerns, there has been a renewed focus on antitrust laws and their ability to ensure competition in the market. Standard arguments that this concentration stifles innovation and harms consumers have been reinvigorated. Some people added concerns about the political and economic power of these companies and and their effects on democracy itself. But are these concerns justified? And how much (and what) antitrust action do we really need? To find answers we need to look deeper.

# Is the American economy becoming more concentrated?

The American economy is becoming more concentrated ‚Äî if you have read the media or listened to politicians over the last decade you probably encountered this statement a lot. It was also one of the main assumptions driving a lot of President Biden‚Äôs economic policy agenda. But is it true? First I‚Äôll look at the evidence of concentration in the broad US economy. Next, I‚Äôll look at some specific sectors. I‚Äôll focus mainly on product markets and ignore labor markets (maybe I‚Äôll write another post about it sometime).

Economists understood for a long time that measuring the market concentration of the entire economy in a meaningful way is very difficult. There are two major issues with the measurement of market concentration. The first one is conceptual and involves the difficulty of defining relevant markets for assessing market shares, which is especially hard to do on an economy-wide basis. The second issue involves problems with the availability and reliability of relevant data. Unfortunately, a lot of studies don‚Äôt address these issues sufficiently. We‚Äôll come back to these issues with more detail later.

Once you resolve these issues and have a reasonably defined market with sufficiently reliable data you can start to measure the concentration level in the economy. There are two main ways of doing this. One way is to measure the concentration ratio of some fixed number of top firms ‚Äî usually it's revenue share of 4 (C4) or 5 (C5) largest companies. The problem with this approach is that it doesn‚Äôt tell you anything about the concentration of market share among other firms (other than top 4 or 5 firms). Another common approach is something called Herfindahl‚ÄìHirschman Index (HHI). It‚Äôs calculated by squaring the market share of each firm competing in the market and then summing the resulting numbers. HHI is represented as a number between 0 and 10000 with 10000 being the completely monopolized market with one firm capturing all the revenue (the lower the number the less concentrated the market is).

# 2016 CEA report

We can start by looking at the popular¬†[Council of Economic Advisers report](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/page/files/20160414_cea_competition_issue_brief.pdf)¬†from 2016 that was widely reported as evidence that the US economy is getting more concentrated. The report notes that the majority of industries have seen increases in the revenue share enjoyed by the 50 largest firms (CR50). It is shown in their Table 1.

It‚Äôs not clear, however, whether this tells us much about the level of concentration in the American economy. There are a couple of reasons for why these concentration ratios may not be very informative in this regard.

* The concentration ratios are calculated at a very broad level of industry aggregation (two-digit NAICS codes), which may not reflect the relevant markets where consumers and producers interact. For example, within retail trade (NAICS 44-45), there are many different subsectors such as grocery stores, clothing stores, or online retailers, each with different degrees of concentration and competition. The observed trends may simply reflect expansion of successful companies into related fields of business, to the benefit of consumers.
* The concentration ratios are calculated at a national level, which may not capture the geographic variation in market conditions within the country and may simply reflect beneficial expansion of successful businesses into new geographical markets.
* The concentration measure that is used (CR50) is not very informative. Markets can be quite competitive with far fewer than 50 firms and that‚Äôs why most industrial economists prefer using measures like HHI, CR4 or CR5.[1](https://drthad.substack.com/p/myth-of-monopoly-capitalism#footnote-1-108928492)

The CEA recognized the shortcomings of its Table 1, emphasizing that national-level concentration data do not automatically indicate increased market power. As they noted:

>The statistics presented in Table 1 are national statistics across broad aggregates of industries, and an increase in revenue concentration at the national level is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition to indicate an increase in market power. Instead, antitrust authorities direct their attention to concentration at the relevant market level for each product or service. Those data are not readily available across the economy

However, many who cited the report failed to acknowledge this nuance. While Table 1 reflects the growing role of large firms in the economy, it does not provide meaningful insights into competition at relevant market levels. A firm‚Äôs size alone does not imply reduced competition or greater market power.

# Other reports based on Economic Census data

There have been several more reports that appear to document growing concentration of the U.S. economy.¬†*The Economist*¬†in 2016 published a 2016 chart called ‚ÄúA Widespread Effect‚Äù, illustrating changes in the four-firm concentration ratio (CR4) across 893 U.S. industries between 1997 and 2012.

This chart, based on Economic Census data, classifies industries under four-digit NAICS codes, making it more specific than the broad two-digit classifications used by the CEA. However, even these categories do not generally align with the relevant markets used in antitrust analysis. The chart highlights national-level increases in CR4 across numerous industries. For instance, the CR4 for full-service restaurants increased slightly from 8% to 9%, health insurance from 20% to 34%, airlines from 25% to 65%, supermarkets from 21% to 31%, and wired telecommunications carriers from 47% to 51%. At first glance, this may seem like strong evidence of growing concentration, but it is crucial to consider the geographic nature of competition in these industries. Many of the industries reported in¬†*The Economist*¬†operate at the local level, meaning that measuring their concentration at a national scale can provide a misleading picture. A rising national CR4 does not necessarily mean that competition within individual geographic markets has decreased. Moreover, the rise of national firms capturing a greater share of revenue does not necessarily indicate reduced competition. In many cases, this shift reflects greater efficiency, better service, and lower prices benefiting consumers (we will get to this point in more detail later). While some view the decline of small, local firms as problematic, competition policy should rather focus on consumer welfare rather than protecting smaller competitors from more efficient rivals.

[Peltzman (2014](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/675719)) analyzed in-depth long-term concentration trends in the manufacturing sector from 1963 to 2007. He finds no significant change from 1963 to 1982 but notes an increase after merger enforcement was relaxed in 1982. The median HHI in manufacturing industries rose from 565 in 1982 to 662 in 2002, with consumer goods showing higher levels than producer goods. However, Peltzman does not equate this rise with reduced competition, acknowledging that moderate concentration increases can coexist with greater competition due to economies of scale and firm efficiency differences. It is also crucial to recognize that the Economic Census data, that the analyses above are based on, only account for production at domestic establishments and exclude imports, which have significantly increased over the past two decades. This omission distorts perceptions of market concentration by ignoring the impact of foreign competition.

# Reports and research based on Compustat data

Other data that is frequently used to measure concentration trends come from Compustat. The reason for that is often that the data from the Economic Census is both limited and lagging, with official statistics only released twice per decade, while Compustat provides annual updates.

[Grullon, Larkin, and Michaely (2019)](https://academic.oup.com/rof/article-abstract/23/4/697/5477414) attempted to measure concentration trends by analyzing the Herfindahl‚ÄìHirschman Index (HHI) at the three-digit NAICS level using Compustat data. Their analysis shows that concentration declined in the 1980s and early 1990s, surged in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and then rose gradually afterward (median increase in the HHI between 1997 and 2014 was 41 percent, while the average increase was 90 percent and over 75% of U.S. industries experiencing an increase in concentration levels). Below is the plot of their findings.

Similarly,¬†[Brauning, Fillat, and Joaquim (2022)](https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/current-policy-perspectives/2022/cost-price-relationships-in-a-concentrated-economy.aspx) suggest that the U.S. economy became at least 50% more concentrated between 2005 and 2018, correlating this rise with higher prices. They also use HHI at the three-digit NAICS level. Another widely cited study using Compustat data is¬†[De Loecker and Eeckhout (2020)](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/135/2/561/5714769), which found that markups increased from 18% to 67% between 1980 and 2017, attributing this trend to growing market power.

Reliance on Compustat data for measuring market concentration encounters some important problems:

* Compustat includes only publicly traded companies, omitting private firms that constitute a significant portion of the U.S. economy.
* It assigns a single industry code to each firm based on its primary line of business, failing to account for diversified operations across multiple sectors.
* The dataset records worldwide sales figures, which is misleading for analysis of domestic market concentration.

Because of this and other flaws Compustat data can‚Äôt replicate concentration measures that we get from Economic Census data. Paper from the¬†[Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/a-note-on-industry-concentration-measurement-20230203.html) highlights this, showing low correlations between them. Specifically, correlations for top-firm concentration ratios between the two datasets are generally below 0.2. Limitations of Compustat data for the purposes of measuring concentration is well-known and has been explored in many articles.[2](https://drthad.substack.com/p/myth-of-monopoly-capitalism#footnote-2-108928492)

# Concentration trends on the national industry level

If we look beyond Compustat data for public companies and include private ones, and consider concentration at the national level what do we see?

Fortunately there is some data and research on this.¬†[Autor, Dorn, Katz, Patterson, and Van Reenen (2020)](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/135/2/645/5721266) use U.S. Census panel data that includes both public and private firms at the firm and establishment levels. Their analysis show the sales-weighted average sales- and employment-based CR4 and CR20 measures of concentration across four-digit industries for each of the six major sectors ‚Äî manufacturing, retail trade, wholesale trade, services, utilities and transportation, and finance. Results are shown below.

In their¬†[appendix](https://www.ddorn.net/papers/ADKPV-SuperstarFirms-Appendix.pdf)¬†they also show an average HHI for the same sectors. Here‚Äôs how it looks like.

While HHI shows somewhat smaller increases than CR4 or CR20, both show similar picture ‚Äî rising concentration, at least in retail, services, utilities and transportation and finance. As the authors put it:

>The two figures show a consistent pattern. First, there is a clear upward trend over time: according to all measures of sales concentration, industries have become more concentrated on average. Second, the trend is stronger when measuring concentration in sales rather than employment. This suggests that firms may attain large market shares with relatively few workers‚Äîwhat¬†[Brynjolfsson et al. (2008)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=980568)¬†call ‚Äúscale without mass.‚Äù Third, a comparison of Figure IV and Online Appendix Figure A.1 shows that the upward trend is slightly weaker for the HHI, presumably because this metric is giving more weight to firms outside the top 20, where concentration has risen by less.

It‚Äôs important to note the magnitude of these increases in concentration. None of the the HHI levels are particularly concerning ‚Äî markets with HHI below 1000 are typically classified as unconcentrated and only the service sector is above that threshold.

# Maybe not much more concentrated

So far we‚Äôve looked at the evidence showing somewhat rising concentration and noted some methodological problems. But is there other evidence showing contrary picture? Well, yes.

This line of research can be summarized in a couple of points.

1. [Benkard, Yurukoglu, and Zhang (2021)](https://www.nber.org/papers/w28745)¬†suggest that determining whether concentration has been rising or falling depends critically on the boundaries one draws between different markets. While from the producer‚Äôs perspective evidence suggests rising levels of concentration, if we take the consumers perspective we see the decline in concentration levels. Researchers find that the median HHI fell from 2,265 in 1994 to 1,945 in 2019. Similarly, the 90th percentile HHI declined from 5,325 to 4,570 over the same period. In 1994, 44.4% of all industries fell into the highly concentrated category. By 2019, that figure had dropped to 36.6%, indicating a broad-based reduction in concentration across the economy. So their ‚Äúconsumer perspective‚Äù shows actually higher concentration levels, but the opposite trend ‚Äî instead of increase in concentration, it shows a decrease.
2. Most of the research looked at data at the national level, but it‚Äôs questionable whether this is the appropriate market to consider. A lot, if not most, product markets are local (coffee shop in Brooklyn doesn‚Äôt compete with the one in Los Angeles).¬†[Rossi-Hansberg, Sarte, and Trachter (2021)](https://www.princeton.edu/~erossi/DTNLC.pdf)¬†find divergent trends in concentration in local and national level. It‚Äôs best captured in their Figure 1. While the national level data shows slight increase, more local measures show downward trend ‚Äîthe more local the sharper decline in concentration. Now, this types of local data sources are scarce and not completely reliable. This one for example has a lot of imputed data. Some other papers using different, more complete and reliable data sources find that these trends do not diverge, but unfortunately they usually focus on one specific industry because of data limitations (for example¬†[Smith and Ocampo (2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07609)) for retail).
3. A lot of products market are local, but other are arguably global. One of the biggest changes in the economy over the last 40 years have been globalization. American firms now compete not only with other domestic companies, but also foreign ones. It is therefore important to account for import for better view of concentration trends.¬†[Amiti and Heise (2021)](https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr968.pdf)¬†find, using confidential census data for the manufacturing sector, that typical measures of concentration, once adjusted for sales by foreign exporters, actually stayed constant between 1992 and 2012.

Now, none of this research is conclusive, but it shows us that we need to carefully examine methodological and data issues before we reach any conclusion.

**Summing up**: there is some evidence that concentration has risen somewhat, although it varies a lot by industry and depends on the metric and data that is used. Nevertheless dramatic narratives about rising concentration levels don‚Äôt seem to be strongly supported by carefully examined data.

# Concentration doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean less competition

So far I wrote about the trends in concentration levels, but that's not what is really interesting for us. The thing we should be concerned about is the level of¬†*competition*¬†in the economy and that's not exactly the same thing. In fact, concentration levels alone tell us very little about how competitive the economy actually is.

When markets experience rising concentration over time, two competing interpretations emerge with substantially different policy implications. The first option is that increasing concentration is the result or the cause of weakening competitive forces, with few firms gaining market share in a way that stifles competition. The second interpretation offers an alternative explanation: rising concentration may actually reflect competition working effectively, where more productive firms providing superior value to customers naturally gain market share over time through operational efficiency, innovation and better services rather than anti-competitive behavior.

This is not just an abstract ‚Äúwell, actually‚Äù point raised in order to distract us from an ‚Äúobvious‚Äù fact than trends in concentration over the last couple of decades coincided with declining competition. There are a lot of theoretical and empirical reasons to expect competition leading to an¬†*increase*¬†in concentration.

Consider markets with high search and switching costs, where consumers remain locked to existing suppliers, because it‚Äôs costly or inconvenient to look elsewhere. As those frictions fall (thanks to better information platforms, streamlined distribution, new technology or lower transportation costs) consumers can compare offerings and switch to the lowest-cost, highest-quality providers with ease. Small firms lose ground, while bigger, more efficient firms gain market share. Concentration is high, but economy remains competitive. This is what we tend to see in the data.¬†[Goldmanis, Horta√ßsu, Syverson and Emre (2010)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/authored-by/Horta%C3%A7su/Ali)¬†document that the advent of powerful price-comparison tools reallocated sales to the lowest-cost sellers, boosting concentration while consumer prices fell.

# Is the American economy getting less competitive?

The question we actually care about is whether the American economy became less competitive over the last couple of decades. Even assuming that concentration actually went up meaningfully (which isn‚Äôt so obvious), does it reflect ‚Äúdecline-in-competition‚Äù hypothesis or ‚Äúcompetition-in-action‚Äù hypothesis? Or maybe a bit of both?

# Markups

One way to answer these question is to look at the the¬†*price/cost markup*, which is the ratio of price to marginal cost. This is a direct approach to measuring market power (increasing market power would support the ‚Äúdecline-in-competition‚Äù hypothesis) ‚Äîfirms are defined to have market power if they are able to profitably set prices above marginal costs. Still, even if we would observe rising markups it doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that competition is declining ‚Äî as with concentration trends, rising markups could be caused by competitive forces, and to determine causes we would need to examine them closely.

There are two leading approaches to the estimation of price/cost markups ‚Äî the ‚Äúdemand approach‚Äù and the ‚Äúproduction approach‚Äù.

* **Demand approach**: This approach works by studying how customers respond to different prices for a product, which helps researchers understand how much pricing power a company actually has. The basic idea is straightforward: if you can measure how sensitive customers are to price changes (called demand elasticity), you can figure out what markup the company should charge to maximize profits. The method requires detailed sales and pricing data for specific products and makes assumptions about how companies compete with each other ‚Äî whether they're in a market with many similar competitors or just a few major players (think particular model of competition ‚Äî e.g. monopolistic competition or an oligopoly model). This technique has worked well in focused industry studies (such as studying markups for ready-to-eat cereal, airlines, etc.), but applying it across the entire economy becomes extremely challenging due to the massive data requirements and the need to model each industry's unique competitive dynamics.
* **Production approach**: This approach infers markups from production and cost data, and it was popularized by a seminal paper from¬†[De Loecker, Eeckhout, and Unger (2020)](https://www.janeeckhout.com/wp-content/uploads/26.pdf)¬†(DEU). The idea, building on¬†[Hall (1988)](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/261570)¬†and¬†[De Loecker and Warzynski (2012)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.102.6.2437), is that you can use a producer‚Äôs input choices to back out the markup. Under competitive market conditions, an input's cost share (such as labor expenses) should equal that input's output elasticity ‚Äî essentially, its contribution to overall production. However, when firms possess market power, they typically reduce output levels, causing the cost share to fall below the actual elasticity. By estimating production functions to determine output elasticities and examining expenditure shares from standard accounting records, researchers can calculate the implied markup The beauty of this method is that it doesn‚Äôt require specifying a demand curve or even observing prices and quantities separately ‚Äî you can use firms‚Äô financial data, which is available for many companies over many years, to get a broad measure of markups. That‚Äôs why this approach can be applied to large samples of firms across the economy.

Using a production-based approach, (DEU) estimated that the sales-weighted average markup for U.S. firms rose from about 1.21 in 1980 to roughly 1.61 in 2016. In other words, the typical premium over marginal cost moved from 21 % to 61 % ‚Äî an increase of a little over 30 percentage points. The study gained substantial popularity and has been since wildly cited as evidence of a broad uptick in market power. Researchers and advocates have used these results to explain the decline in labor‚Äôs share of income, rising inequality, muted investment, and slower productivity growth, arguing that weaker competition has given firms greater leverage over consumers and workers.

However, as with concentration, these headline results on markups have been hotly debated. A series of follow-up papers pointed out potential issues with the DEU approach and offered different findings:

* Traina (2018) shows that using COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) as a proxy for variable cost is too narrow because parts of SG&A (selling, general and administrative expenses) ‚Äî marketing, R&D, some headquarters labor ‚Äî scale with output. So when a reasonable share of SG&A is treated as variable as well (and not as fixed like in DEU), the long-run rise in markups largely disappears and can even turn slightly negative, implying sensitivity to accounting definitions and a shift toward intangibles rather than greater pricing power.
* DEU, like the Compustat-based concentration studies, only covered publicly traded firms. If public firms increased their markups but a lot of economic activity shifted to private firms or new entrants with lower markups, the aggregate markup could be flatter. Additionally, within the DEU data, the increase in markups was very skewed ‚Äì a subset of high-markup firms pulled up the average, while the median markup increased much less. So it‚Äôs possible that superstar firms gained pricing power in some markets, even as many other firms did not.
* The production-based method hinges on correctly estimating output elasticities which is not an easy task. Allowing these elasticities to vary by industry/firm and over time, as in Foster, Haltiwanger, and Tufano (2023), removes most of the upward drift and in the most flexible specification yields a slight decline, suggesting earlier estimates may have conflated technological change with market power.
* Technological and organizational shifts like automation, IT adoption, and supply-chain improvements have pushed marginal costs down faster than prices in many sectors. This causes measured markups to rise mechanically even when competition remains unchanged, while consumers still benefit through lower prices or better quality.
* Industry evidence is mixed: in consumer packaged goods, markups rise mainly through cost reductions with only modest increases in brand premia. In cement, consolidation plus precalciner kilns lowers costs while prices stay roughly flat, nudging markups up for efficiency reasons (Miller et al. 2023). In steel, the spread of mini-mills intensifies entry and pushes markups down (Collard-Wexler & De Loecker 2015). In autos (1980‚Äì2018), once quality improvements are accounted for, markups decline as marginal costs rise faster than prices.
* Because higher markups can reflect either surplus rents or cost-saving innovation and quality change, they are not, on their own, decisive evidence of weaker competition or lax antitrust. Any welfare conclusions should depend on the mechanism behind the price-cost ratio.

So evidence is much more mixed if you look at the broad literature and conclusions hinge heavily on specific assumptions and methodological choices. It‚Äôs unwise to make a claim that markups evidence strongly supports rising market power story and lower levels of competition.

# Technological progress

Let‚Äôs et aside measurement issues and assume average price‚Äìcost markups have risen across many U.S. industries. How should we interpret that?

One popular reading is weaker rivalry ‚Äî e.g., mergers raising concentration and softening price competition ‚Äî which leads to calls for tougher antitrust enforcement. But as mentioned earlier, higher markups, like higher concentration, can also emerge from consumer-benefiting technological change. Therefore it‚Äôs important to know why markups rose.

Consider an industry where markups rose because low-cost, high-markup firms expanded as trade barriers fell or technology enabled geographic scale. That looks like ‚Äúcompetition-in-action‚Äù: efficient ‚Äúsuperstar‚Äù firms pass some, but not all, cost savings to consumers via lower prices. Decompositions in DEU and¬†[Autor, Dorn, Katz, Patterson, and Van Reenen (2020)](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/135/2/645/5721266)¬†show revenue reallocating within sectors toward high-markup firms, the primary driver of average markup increases.¬†[Ganapati (2021)](https://www.sganapati.com/files/Ganapati_2021_AEJM_Growing_Oligopolies.pdf)¬†finds rising profitability correlates with rising productivity across sectors.

Markups can rise while consumers benefit when firms cut marginal costs or raise quality. With less-than-full pass-through, prices can fall, output can rise, and welfare can improve even as markups increase. New products can have the same effect ‚Äî patents and copyrights are designed to encourage such investments. Industry-specific studies surveyed in¬†[Miller (2024)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167718724000869)¬†often identify technological progress as the dominant force behind measured markup changes. This is not always the case, obviously. In some industries, mergers raised prices, and some likely faced undetected collusion. In others, technology or globalization drove margins. There is no reason to believe a single mechanism explains rising markups across most industries.

This heterogeneity is why industrial-organization economists moved toward detailed, industry-specific studies that model actual market features, allow richer heterogeneity, and relax restrictive functional forms.

The bottom line is that to assess market failure and appropriate antitrust enforcement, one must identify the mechanism at work in the industry in question. Overhauling competition policy on the blanket assumption that rising price‚Äìcost markups signal declining competition is unwarranted and could be counterproductive.

# Conclusions

There are definitely sectors of the economy that show growing monopoly power ‚Äî parts of telecom and healthcare come to mind. Yet the broader evidence does not indicate a pervasive decline in competition in the U.S. economy. As one recent comprehensive review states: ‚Äúthe empirical evidence relating to concentration trends, markup trends, and the effects of mergers does not actually show a widespread decline in competition‚Äù[3](https://substack.com/home/post/p-108928492#footnote-3-108928492). Much of what we observe looks like ‚Äúcompetition-in-action‚Äù: many big firms became large by outperforming rivals, not by suppressing them.

This doesn‚Äôt mean everything is perfect and that we don‚Äôt need any stronger antitrust action, but it shows that we should be precise and targeted about reforms and use of antitrust tools. Studying individual markets and assessing them on their own basis is hard, but at the same time much more productive than sweeping claims about monopoly capitalism killing the economy.

Overall, the narrative of a sweeping decline in competitiveness of the U.S. economy appears overstated when the evidence is examined closely. Aggregate concentration has increased modestly, yet in many industries it remains at levels that do not, by themselves, signal a serious competition problem, and much of the rise can be traced to benign forces such as technological progress, globalization, and efficient firms scaling up. The intensity of rivalry and pressure on firms has not clearly diminished and in some ways (owing to technology and globalization) competition has intensified. High concentration in particular markets often reflects competitive processes (the best firms winning) rather than collusion and other anti-competitive practices. Ultimately, what matters for consumers and the broader economy is less the raw number of firms than how contestable and fair markets are. The research indicates that, aside from some pockets deserving attention, competition in the U.S. is very much alive, and broad claims of a generalized ‚Äúmonopoly problem‚Äù overstate a more nuanced, sector-by-sector reality.

I'd appreciate some thoughts from those who've been in the LDS church.

I recently started dating a man who I met through work (he was a regular at the coffee shop that I was working at & we started hanging out). We are both in our 20s. He is not a Mormon, but his parents are and they live in the Western US in an area with a large Mormon population. 

Anyways.... I moved in with him 2 weeks ago (we are not engaged) and his mom and siblings have already said some ""off the wall"" things. 

I figured that part of it is that I don't have a stereotypical Utah Mormon girlfriend vibe. My  style is honestly rather tomboyish (I don't have piercings or dyed hair, but I have a pixie cut; this stock photo is a decent [example](https://pin.it/3xkqEySq8) of my style) and I am from upstate NY. I have explained that upstate is not NYC, but they don't seem to really get that.

I am trying to figure out how much of their behavior is ""normal Mormon stuff"" and how much is not. I'm a spiritual person, not an atheist, but haven't been involved much in organized religion and don't know much about the LDS.

In the last 2 weeks of knowing his family, which included a family reunion (so a lot of time together) his mom has said some things that none of my exes moms would have:

1. She honestly doesn't seem to like that we're living together before marriage and his grandma (after talking with his mom in the other room). Told me, in an admittedly respectful way, that couples who move in too soon are prone to drama. 

2. His mom 'casually' brought up her belief that sex seals a marriage (if you're a virgin). This was the 3rd day that I knew her.

3. She noticed that I was wearing a necklace with a dragon pendant üêâ and told my bf that she had a dream where he found a beautiful dragon egg (*with a crack in it...*) next to another, equally beautiful, egg and considered it a ""personal revelation."" I don't really like the connotations of that.

His sister has also said some bizarre things about Nephites, Lammanites, and the lost tribes of Israel. She seems to be under the impression that the USA is the promised land and some of the things she says are very hard to take seriously. The sister's husband is a White South African who thinks northwest Europeans are descended from the lost tribes of Israel. He is not a Mormon, but he is a deeply Christian man and they all seem to be fine with him larping as a descendant of the Israelites.

I want to make it clear that I really like this guy and he's been awesome to me. I want to keep dating him, I'm just trying to figure out what's going on with his relatives. I have some eccentric ones too, but not in the same way. I also feel guilty about already being frustrated with his mom & sister because they tend to do and say things like this and follow it up with being extremely nice.

üëâ [https://cigarettecoupons.org](https://cigarettecoupons.org)  
  
Okay, so I‚Äôm not usually one to post stuff like this. I‚Äôm more of a lurker, you know? But something happened a few weeks ago that was such a game-changer for my wallet that I felt like I had to share it. We all know how much everything costs these days. Gas, groceries, rent‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs like every time you turn around, something else has gotten more expensive. And for those of us who smoke, that‚Äôs another huge drain on the bank account.

I‚Äôd gotten to a point where I was seriously dreading my daily trip to the gas station. It was almost painful handing over my card for a pack of smokes. I live in a state where the taxes are just brutal, and the cost of a single pack is getting close to what a decent lunch should cost. I was doing the math one day, and it was just depressing. I‚Äôm talking hundreds of dollars a month. That‚Äôs a car payment for some people!

I started looking for ways to cut back. I tried the cheaper, off-brand cigarettes, and let‚Äôs be honest, they‚Äôre just not the same. It‚Äôs like drinking instant coffee when you‚Äôre used to a good brew. It gets the job done, I guess, but you‚Äôre not happy about it. I even thought about rolling my own, but who has the time for that? Plus, the whole process just seemed like a hassle.

# My Sad Search for Savings

So, I did what everyone does: I went online. I started searching for things like ‚Äúcigarette discounts,‚Äù ‚Äúcoupons for Marlboro,‚Äù and ‚Äúhow to get free cigarettes.‚Äù It was a total mess. Most of the sites I found were super sketchy. They wanted me to fill out endless surveys, sign up for a million different newsletters, or download some weird app that probably wanted to steal my information. It felt like every link was a dead end designed to waste my time.

I was about to give up. I figured I was just doomed to pay full price forever. Then, one night, I was deep in some random online forum about saving money. Someone mentioned in a passing comment how they get their cigarette coupons from a single source. There was a link, and I almost didn‚Äôt click it. I figured it was just another one of those scammy sites. But I was desperate, so I thought, what the heck? What‚Äôs one more click?

That one click changed everything.

# Finding the Holy Grail of Cigarette Coupons

The site was called cigarettecoupons.org. The first thing I noticed was how clean and simple it was. There were no flashy ads, no pop-ups demanding my email, no promises of winning a free car if I just completed one more survey. It was just‚Ä¶ straightforward. It said they gathered coupons for top-brand cigarettes and gave them to users. Simple as that.

Honestly, I was still skeptical. It seemed too good to be true. But I saw they had coupons for my brand, Camel, right there on the homepage. They also had deals for other big names I‚Äôve smoked over the years, like Newport, Pall Mall, and American Spirit. It was an impressive list.

So, I decided to give it a shot. I followed the instructions, which were surprisingly easy. No jumping through hoops. A few clicks later, I had a coupon that promised a free pack of cigarettes. A whole free pack. I figured there had to be a catch. Maybe the coupon wouldn‚Äôt scan, or maybe the gas station clerk would look at me like I was crazy.

The next morning, I went to my usual spot. I grabbed my pack of Camels and a coffee, and when I got to the counter, I pulled up the coupon on my phone. My heart was kind of pounding, which is silly, I know. But I just fully expected it to fail. I showed the coupon to the cashier, she scanned it, and‚Ä¶ that was it. The price of the cigarettes just vanished from the total. I paid for my coffee and walked out with a free pack of smokes.

I stood in the parking lot for a minute just staring at the receipt. It actually worked. I felt this huge wave of relief. It might sound dramatic to get this excited over a pack of cigarettes, but it wasn‚Äôt just about the money I saved in that moment. It was the feeling of finally catching a break. You know what I mean? It‚Äôs that little victory that makes a tough week feel a little bit better.

# Why This Is My New Go-To Resource

Since that first time, I‚Äôve gone back to the site again and again. It‚Äôs not just a one-time thing. They regularly have new offers and discounts. Sometimes it‚Äôs a ‚Äúbuy one, get one free‚Äù deal, other times it‚Äôs a few dollars off a single pack. The point is, I haven‚Äôt paid full price for a pack in weeks. The amount of money I‚Äôm saving is genuinely adding up. That extra cash now goes toward gas, or I can treat myself to lunch without feeling guilty about it.

What I really love is that it‚Äôs not a complicated rewards program where you have to accumulate points for months just to get a dollar off. It‚Äôs instant savings. And the fact that they bring all these offers from different brands into one place is just incredibly convenient. I don‚Äôt have to sign up for the Marlboro mailing list and the Newport mailing list and a dozen others just to get some deals. It‚Äôs all right there.

I even used a coupon to try a different brand that I was curious about but didn‚Äôt want to spend the money on. So, it‚Äôs also a good way to switch things up without the risk.

I‚Äôm sharing this because I know there are a lot of people out there feeling the same financial pressure I was. When you‚Äôre trying to make ends meet, every little bit helps. Finding a legit way to save money on something you were going to buy anyway feels like a superpower. There‚Äôs no catch, no gimmick. It‚Äôs just a genuinely useful resource. It was a complete surprise to find something that actually delivered on its promise without any strings attached. It‚Äôs a small thing, but it‚Äôs made a big difference for me.

So, if you‚Äôre tired of overpaying and want to find some real, usable cigarette coupons without all the hassle, I can‚Äôt recommend this site enough.

Now when I first sprayed it, it was very sweet. 

Okay.

This is fine because I don't mind sweet fragrances. HOWEVER------- Almost immediately after spraying it on myself **ONCE**, the most nauseating aftertaste? aftersmell? appeared. 

**THE SMELL:**

At first, it smells like marshmallows. Like I'm eating marshmallows out of the pack. Then quickly it starts smelling like I ate too many marshmallows and they have rapidly made a reappearance. There is also another smell underneath the marshmallow, like some kinda bean maybe? Chocolate or coffee? It's some kinda food but honestly I'm too distracted by my nausea to tell what it is. There is supposed to be a tobacco smell and when I heard that I thought it would smell smokey. WRONG. My mistake. Its just smells like shit. Like old, musty, stale... something. 



I sprayed it first thing in the morning (about an hour ago) because I like to see how long it lasts throughout the day and how the smell develops. I just went downstairs for breakfast and listen-- I'm hungry in the mornings because I haven't eaten for 10-12hrs, I have to control myself when it comes to breakfast because I could literally eat my entire days worth of calories at 7am. 

I could not even look at a dry cracker without wanted to retch. 

I thought this disgusting, thrown up marshmallow smell would go away or die down after I tried WIPING MY CLOTHES AND SKIN WITH A WET CLOTH but it did not. I'm trying to drink my coffee and struggling even after using micellar water on my skin because I can still smell it.

Now before when I said I sprayed it on myself ONCE I wasn't lying, but I did spray the bottle twice. I have a habit of somehow missing my body the first 1-2 times I spray idk how. Divin'Enfant has apparently infused itself into the fibres of my carpet and seeped into the drywall of my bedroom. Which brings me back to the opening of this post. 

I went back to my room after my defeat in the kitchen, only to have Divin'Enfant following up with a one-two. The vomit smell feels like foreshadowing. I am typing this out in my room wallowing in the misery of mine and ELDO's making. I think I need to learn from this.

I have cleansed my d√©colletage multiple times. I've changed my clothes. I've cracked open a window. 

**Someone please tell me that there is a silver lining here? Like did any of you find that it starts smelling good hours later? Or in super small amounts? Or that it layers really nicely with something?** 

**Maybe the silver lining is that my experience can serve as a warning to others - that you should really look up a blind buy on fragrantica first, and when they tell you it causes nausea in some people, some people might be YOU.** I used to think that when people said perfumes made them nauseous or gave them a headache that they were just pussies. I am sorry. Because now it's my turn to be the pussy and I'm realising that we are on the front lines, fighting gods toughest battles. Someone has to try these perfumes and someone has to be the one to tell you it SUCKS. ^((ignore the fact that this perfume has been around for nearly two decades and no new insight was gained here))

I still have just under 10mL left of this stuff. I didn't spend much money on the bigger sample size (and now I know why), but still I don't like wasting perfumes. I also don't wanna throw it out because not even sewage or landfill deserve to be contaminated with this stench. 

The only positive from this experience is that I realised that I do not like sweet gourmand smells as the main note of a perfume. I have also learned that I am not a good judge of what combinations will smell good when just seeing it written down. 

After 1hr of this stink I have found that my saviour Frederic Malle is the only one that can cut through the fetor. I've put a small amount of Synthetic Jungle onto my upper lip, and so now I am MOSTLY smelling soapy freshness, but even then when I walk around my room and circulate the air I still get wafts of the toxic vapours. At this point maybe I should just spray more Divin'Enfant in hopes I become nose blind to it. Fight fire with fire kinda thing. IDK. I think I'm giving up.

I am a junior, non-IB school student, economics major, average-ranked uni, only CFA Level 1 attempt in my sophomore year in August 2025 recently, and some certifications from Financial Edge Training (relating skills in IB, PE, VC, PM, AM, Microsoft Office, modelling ...) . So firstl, I want to only pursue academia and government roles,s but then I want to switch to finance.

So I am looking for a PE and VC fund, or a PE search fund, to get unpaid interns till my graduation, boost my profile a bit to seek paid interns and go to a top B-school master's program like Rotman. So see the folks from top B-schools get many interns throughout the year at PE/VC funds in the US and Canada so I want to do the same. But yes, the B-school fellows are definitely more qualified for these funds than I, many are into PE funds, and I am relatively new to the industry, so I don't know how to approach the fund owner/principal/MD to get interns (unpaid is not a problem).

I tried SearchFunder yesterday, it is good so far, but only few intern posts a day, and have to compete as well. I can find millions of PE funds only by using LinkedIn Premium and any profile of the people there. I am thinking of cold emailing the head of these PE funds directly to ask for any positions, any help needed now or soon, but I think this is kind of awkward, since the guys don't know you and would lead to low success rate or perhaps 0. I don't mind cold emailing and reaching out, but if it is an irreversible stupid things to do, then it is better to ask you bosses for advice.

So thequestions is what can I do right now to quickly getan PE search fundinterns, is it cold email, doing coffee chats, ask directly, or focus on school extracurricular, do other things cuz it will not work for me, trying to find experience at another country... generally for my situation and desire, what are the advices, mindsets?.

1n9jwvg,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1n9jwvg/i_gave_him_everything_and_he_threw_me_away_like/,"I gave him everything, and he threw me away like nothing; ultimate betrayal.","I don‚Äôt even know where to start. My ex (M, late 20s) and I (F, mid 20s) were together for 3.5 years. He was my best friend, my partner, my person. We planned our lives together kids, marriage, holidays, all of it. I supported him in every way possible. Even though he earned a lot as a software engineer, I still pitched in financially, cooked, decorated, and made our apartment a home. I loved him fiercely. I was his biggest cheerleader.

For the last year and a half of our relationship, I wanted to get engaged. He kept putting me off ‚Äúin the spring,‚Äù then ‚Äúin the fall,‚Äù then spring again. Each time passed with no follow-through. It hurt, but I kept trusting him, hoping he‚Äôd keep his word. Finally, in April this year, he moved in with me. We had a beautiful two-bedroom apartment, and I thought everything was finally falling into place.

Then, out of nowhere, he got a LinkedIn message from a Meta recruiter. At first he told me it was only a 5% chance. He kept passing interviews, and every time I tried to talk about it, he reassured me it was nothing. When he finally got the offer, I was horrified, I told him I wasn‚Äôt ready to move to Washington yet. I was in my senior year of college, and we weren‚Äôt even engaged. I asked him to wait. We fought. A lot. Eventually, I gave in. I told him I‚Äôd go, even though it meant sacrificing so much. He kept telling me, ‚ÄúTrust me. Trust me.‚Äù And that he would take care of me. Even though when we were together for 3 1/2 years, he was the cheapest person I had ever met and this is not like frugal cheap. This was like cheap cheap. There were so many times that we would go out to eat like at chipotle for example and I would ask for guacamole bowl and he would ask me to Venmo him three dollars for the guac. 

So I trusted him. We looked at apartments, planned our new life, talked about how he would ‚Äútake care of me.‚Äù He love-bombed me, right up until the day before he ended it. And then one night, after I‚Äôd done the laundry and folded everything, he looked me in the eye and told me it was over.

I begged and cried. He was cold. He even said, Well, if you were pregnant, we would‚Äôve made it work, we would be ride or die. Didn‚Äôt say it out right but ultimately just telling me that he would only stay with me or it would be worth it to stay with me only if I was carrying his child and not because he loved me. I was hoping so badly that I was pregnant so I could still be with him and two days later, life is just so cruel because I woke up bleeding with my period and I just cried so hard.

The timing couldn‚Äôt have been worse, two days later was my best friend‚Äôs wedding, where I was a bridesmaid and he was a groomsman. He told me he‚Äôd be damned if we ruined their day and kept telling me to lock in for them even though I was sad. I sat in the front row watching them exchange vows while I was silently falling apart. I wanted that for him and I and it felt like death to know that I wasn‚Äôt going to get that anymore and he was sitting on the other side of the room with the groomsmen.

After that, he treated me like a stranger. He moved his desk and clothes out, left me with all of our furniture, bills, just all of OUR stuff and said he was ‚Äúat peace with his decision.‚Äù At one point, he told me, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a catch, any guy would be lucky to have you,‚Äù like that was supposed to make up for everything. I‚Äôll spare all of the details but he told me all of these horrible things. He was so cruel. He told me that it just didn‚Äôt work out. And that he‚Äôs done. He never wanted to try again. We ran out of time. I asked so you don‚Äôt wanna be a part of each other‚Äôs lives anymore? And he literally looked me in the face and told me maybe someday we could grab a coffee. Said it was all for the best. And told me to stop asking questions. I was gutted. He couldn‚Äôt even tell me that he loved me anymore. That final day he treated me like I never meant anything, like I was shit on the bottom of his shoe, like I was a stranger, like I didn‚Äôt give everything of me in the relationship. I remember that day I just kept apologizing to him as if I did something wrong. I kept saying sorry I kept telling him that I loved him that we can try again. I remember him looking at me and telling me to forgive myself and to heal. I was crying and begging him not to go or not to do this and he quietly told me I‚Äôve already been here longer than I needed to be, which was like 15 minutes cause he wanted to keep it short, of course. And he told me I‚Äôm gonna go and he was making his way for the door and I kept just saying please don‚Äôt do this. Please don‚Äôt go. I love you. I don‚Äôt want to do this life without you and he just kept telling me that you know it was over and for me to respect his decision. Blindsided and whiplash doesn‚Äôt even give it justice. He quite literally burned down our life in our house and literally left me in the rubble and ashes while he made it out and just walked away. All his confidence telling me ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not running away. I‚Äôm just choosing to walk away from our relationship.‚Äù

If somebody had broken into our house and brutally murdered me that would‚Äôve hurt less, and I still feel that way till this day.

Within a week and a half, he was gone. This all happened in like five days or less, complete utter shock. It literally was from left field. He left me with a $1,600 apartment I couldn‚Äôt afford, forcing me to pack up our life, sell or give away most of our things, and scramble into a cheaper place. Again, I had to pack our entire apartment. Find a new place get rid of the majority of our shit, that I ended up having to give away for free because nobody wanted to take it fast enough. From the time that he left me to the next months rent I only had a few weeks so this was all incredibly quick. I was devastated. I remember when I looked at my new apartment. I cried in front of the leasing agent so hard . I couldn‚Äôt breathe. I took two weeks off work. I wanted to die. He quite literally abandoned me, ha.

Two months later, I wrote him a letter that literally took me two months to write, of me rereading adding things taking things out, the deepest thing I‚Äôve ever written, pouring out my soul. I sent it. He just left it on read, in fact, I don‚Äôt even think he actually read it. I remember in the message that I sent along with the letter. I told him that if he still felt it to call me, and if he didn‚Äôt to just respond with, no, I‚Äôm good and I would take it for what it was, but he didn‚Äôt give me anything. He never replied. Not even ‚Äúno, I‚Äôm good.‚Äù Just silence.

And then I found out he was already going on dates. While I was drowning in heartbreak, unable to even look at another man, he was chasing someone new.

I don‚Äôt want people to think that I‚Äôm staking myself worth on a man cause I‚Äôm not. But it‚Äôs so hard when you had given everything and you had planned with this person everything and your whole entire future plans were included in that as well and then he just decided to randomly out of nowhere leave you.
He‚Äôs off living his best new life in Washington, with his new fancy cushy job and high paying salary, and he left me behind in his old one that he no longer wanted. I don‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôm supposed to do with my life anymore. All of my plans everything I‚Äôm just stuck. I can‚Äôt even do my final semester or final two semesters of college cause I‚Äôm just I don‚Äôt know anymore. My life literally just flipped upside down and the worst way possible. I literally don‚Äôt even know anymore. I‚Äôm just stuck in this fucking purgatory and I just wish it was all over.

Now it‚Äôs been four months since the breakup. Over a month since the letter. I‚Äôm still reeling. I‚Äôm broke, depressed, and my self-worth feels destroyed. I wake up every day and don‚Äôt want to be here. I miss him, I still love him, and I can‚Äôt understand how someone who claimed to love me could abandon me so brutally. I‚Äôve been ghosted by the love of my life.

The saddest thing yet is that this is the last thing that I would‚Äôve ever expected from him especially because none of this was part of the character that I knew. He was sweet and kind and really, really loved me‚Ä¶ so I thought.

# Demystifying Copywriting: What It Really Means

Let's get one thing straight ‚Äì copywriting isn't about copyright law or protecting intellectual property. Nope! It's the art and science of crafting words that sell, persuade, and compel people to take action.

Think of copywriting as the bridge between your audience's problems and your solutions. Every word is strategically placed. Every sentence serves a purpose. Every paragraph builds toward one ultimate goal: getting your reader to say ""YES!""

Here's what makes copywriting different from regular writing:
- Regular writing informs or entertains
- Copywriting transforms readers into customers

The most successful copywriters understand this fundamental truth: you're not just writing words on a page. You're creating an experience that guides people through a journey ‚Äì from skeptical stranger to enthusiastic buyer.

# Career Paths That Can Make You Rich (Seriously!)

Now, let's talk money. Because let's be honest ‚Äì you're probably wondering if this copywriting thing can actually pay the bills, right?

Spoiler alert: It absolutely can! But your earning potential depends heavily on which path you choose.

# Freelance Copywriting: Your Ticket to Six-Figure Freedom

Freelancing is where the real magic happens. Imagine setting your own rates, choosing your clients, and working from anywhere in the world. Sounds like a dream? For top-tier freelance copywriters, it's just Tuesday.

Here's the reality check: About 20% of freelance copywriters are crushing it with six-figure incomes ‚Äì that's over $100,000 annually! But here's what they don't tell you... The other 80% are struggling because they treat copywriting like hobby writing instead of results-driven marketing.

The freelancers who succeed understand one crucial principle: they're not selling writing services ‚Äì they're selling results. When you can prove that your copy increases conversions by 30%, clients will happily pay premium rates.

# Agency Life: Steady Income with Creative Variety

Working at a marketing agency offers something freelancing can't: stability and structured learning. You'll typically start around $47,000 annually, with senior copywriters earning approximately $88,000.

But here's the insider secret... Agencies are incredible training grounds. You'll work with diverse clients, learn different industries, and build a portfolio faster than you ever could alone. Think of it as your copywriting boot camp.

The downside? You're trading potential upside for security. While freelancers can scale infinitely, agency salaries have more predictable ceilings.

# In-House Copywriting: The Safe (But Limited) Choice

In-house positions offer the ultimate security blanket. Junior copywriters start around $48,000, while senior professionals earn about $84,000. You'll have benefits, steady hours, and deep product knowledge.

But ‚Äì and this is a big but ‚Äì you'll only work on one brand. While this creates expertise, it can limit your growth and portfolio diversity.

Here's our strategic recommendation: Start at an agency or in-house to build foundational skills and connections. Then, once you've mastered the craft, transition to freelancing for unlimited earning potential.

# Mastering the Essential Copywriting Formats

Not all copywriting is created equal. Different formats require different skills, psychology, and approaches. Let's break down the most lucrative and in-demand formats you need to master.

# Headlines: The Make-or-Break Moment

Here's a sobering statistic: 80% of people read headlines, but only 20% continue to the actual content. That means your headline isn't just important ‚Äì it's everything!

Professional copywriters spend 50% of their total writing time perfecting headlines. Why? Because if your headline fails, nothing else matters. Your brilliant copy, your compelling offer, your perfect call-to-action ‚Äì all useless if nobody reads past the first line.

What makes a headline irresistible? Three non-negotiable elements:
- Curiosity that creates an information gap
- Benefit that promises immediate value  
- Urgency that compels immediate action

Instead of writing ""How to Lose Weight,"" try ""Why This 47-Year-Old Mother Lost 30 Pounds in 30 Days (Without Giving Up Carbs)."" See the difference? The second headline tells a story, promises a specific outcome, and hints at a surprising method.

# Value Propositions: Your 10-Second Elevator Pitch

Web visitors make decisions faster than you can blink. Studies show most people leave websites within 10-20 seconds unless something immediately captures their attention.

Your value proposition is that ""something."" It's your brand's essence compressed into one powerful sentence that answers three critical questions:
- What do you do?
- How are you different?
- Why should I care?

Take systeme io's value proposition: ""The only tool you need to launch your online business."" Just ten words, but they pack incredible punch. They promise simplicity (""only tool""), solve a major problem (launching online businesses), and position against competitors (you don't need multiple tools).

This isn't accidental. Every word is strategically chosen to communicate ease, confidence, and competitive advantage.

# SEO-Driven Copy: Getting Found in the Digital Jungle

Search Engine Optimization might sound technical, but it's simply about making your copy discoverable. When people search for solutions online, you want your content appearing at the top of their results.

This requires strategic keyword integration without sacrificing readability. The secret? Think like your audience searches. Instead of writing about ""fitness routines,"" target ""beginner workout plans for busy professionals"" or ""15-minute morning exercises for weight loss.""

Modern SEO copywriting balances three elements:
- Keyword optimization for search engines
- Compelling copy for human readers
- Intent matching for qualified traffic

Tools like SEMRush and Moz help identify high-value keywords, but the real skill lies in weaving them naturally into compelling narratives.

# Direct Response: The Psychology of Immediate Action

Direct response copywriting is copywriting on steroids. Every word exists to drive immediate, measurable action. Whether it's signing up for a newsletter, calling a phone number, or making a purchase, success is measured in real-time responses.

This format requires mastering urgency without seeming pushy. You're not just selling a product ‚Äì you're selling transformation, and you're selling it NOW.

Direct response copy tends to be longer because it needs to overcome every possible objection, build trust, present proof, and create irresistible urgency. Think of it as a complete sales presentation in written form.

The most successful direct response copywriters understand human psychology deeply. They know that people buy emotionally and justify logically, so they appeal to both hearts and minds.

# Broadcast Copy: Building Brands Through Airwaves

Radio and television copywriting operates under unique constraints. You can't rely on visual elements, clickable links, or detailed explanations. Everything must be communicated through words and tone alone.

Radio copywriting demands exceptional descriptive skills. Without visual cues, your words must paint vivid pictures and evoke emotions. You're not just describing a product ‚Äì you're creating an experience listeners can imagine themselves enjoying.

Television copywriting combines verbal and visual elements, but the verbal component must complement, not compete with, the visuals. The most effective TV copy works seamlessly with imagery to create unified, memorable messages.

Both formats require conversational, natural language that mirrors how people actually speak. Formal written language sounds stilted and artificial when spoken aloud.

# B2B Copy: Speaking the Language of Business

Business-to-business copywriting requires a completely different approach than consumer copywriting. Business buyers make more deliberate, research-heavy decisions with longer consideration periods.

B2B copy must be professional without being boring, informative without being overwhelming, and persuasive without being pushy. You're often writing for committees, not individuals, which means addressing multiple stakeholders with different priorities.

The most effective B2B copywriters focus on ROI, efficiency, and competitive advantage. They understand that business buyers need to justify purchases to superiors, so they provide ammunition for internal selling.

# Landing Page Mastery: Converting Visitors into Customers

Landing page copywriting can literally make or break online businesses. These specialized pages have one job: convert visitors into leads or customers. There's no navigation, no distractions ‚Äì just focused persuasion.

Successful landing pages follow a proven formula:
- Compelling headline that matches visitor expectations
- Clear value proposition that differentiates from competitors
- Social proof that builds trust and credibility
- Benefit-focused copy that addresses visitor motivations
- Strong call-to-action that removes friction

The highest-converting landing pages tell stories that guide visitors through logical progression from curiosity to conviction to action.

# Email Marketing: The $38 Return on Every $1 Invested

Email marketing delivers incredible ROI ‚Äì approximately $38 for every dollar invested. That's why businesses are desperately seeking skilled email copywriters who can consistently deliver results.

But here's the challenge: consumers receive dozens of promotional emails weekly, yet only 9% actually get opened. Your subject line must cut through noise and compel clicks.

Effective email subject lines are:
- Under 60 characters for mobile readability
- Conversational and personal in tone
- Curiosity-driven or urgency-creating
- Benefit-focused rather than feature-heavy

The body copy must immediately deliver on the subject line's promise while building toward a clear, compelling call-to-action.

# Advertisement Copy: The Art of Saying More with Less

Traditional advertising copywriting has existed for centuries ‚Äì literally since 1477! It's the granddaddy of all copywriting formats and remains highly relevant today.

Ad copy requires extreme concision. You might have only 5-10 words to communicate your entire message. Every single word must earn its place through maximum impact and clarity.

The best ad copywriters think like poets, choosing words for their emotional resonance, memorability, and persuasive power. They understand that advertising copy works synergistically with visual design to create unified, impactful messages.

# Video Script Writing: Capturing Attention in the YouTube Era

With 500 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute, exceptional scripts separate viral hits from forgotten uploads. Video script copywriting combines storytelling, education, and persuasion in engaging, watchable formats.

Effective video scripts follow the three-act structure:
- Opening: Hook viewers immediately with compelling questions, surprising statements, or relatable problems
- Middle: Deliver valuable content through maximum five key points to maintain engagement
- Closing: End with clear, specific call-to-action that encourages immediate response

The most successful video scriptwriters write for the ear, not the eye. They use conversational language, strategic pauses, and verbal emphasis to create dynamic, engaging experiences.

# The Non-Negotiable Skills Every Copywriter Needs

Talent alone won't make you a successful copywriter. You need systematic skills, disciplined practices, and deep understanding of human psychology.

# Flawless Writing Fundamentals

This might seem obvious, but you'd be surprised how many aspiring copywriters neglect basic writing skills. Grammar mistakes, spelling errors, and awkward phrasing instantly destroy credibility.

Professional copywriters treat writing tools like Grammarly as essential equipment, not optional accessories. They also invest seriously in improving their craft through courses, books, and constant practice.

Remember: copywriting is persuasive writing, not creative writing. Clarity trumps cleverness every single time.

# Product Knowledge That Goes Beyond Features

You cannot sell what you don't understand. Successful copywriters become product experts who know every feature, benefit, and competitive advantage.

But here's where most copywriters fail: they focus on features instead of transformations. Customers don't buy products ‚Äì they buy better versions of themselves.

Ask yourself these critical questions about every product:
- What specific problems does this solve?
- How will customers' lives improve after purchase?
- What makes this uniquely better than alternatives?
- What objections might prevent purchase?
- What proof exists that this actually works?

The answers become your copywriting ammunition.

# Audience Psychology: Reading Minds Through Research

Great copywriters are part psychologist, part detective. They don't just understand what their audience wants ‚Äì they understand what their audience fears, hopes for, and dreams about.

Customer surveys, interviews, and behavioral data reveal insights that transform good copy into great copy. You need to know:
- What language your audience uses naturally
- What problems keep them awake at night
- What solutions they've tried before
- What objections prevent them from buying
- What would make them absolutely thrilled

This research becomes the foundation for authentic, resonating copy that feels like mind-reading.

# Persuasion Mastery: The Psychology of Yes

All copywriting is persuasion, but not all persuasion is created equal. The most effective copywriters understand proven psychological principles that influence human decision-making.

Start with your value proposition, then layer in benefits that create emotional resonance. Always prioritize benefits over features because customers experience benefits directly while features remain abstract.

There are three types of benefits to emphasize:
- Functional benefits (what it does)
- Emotional benefits (how it feels)  
- Social benefits (what others think)

Smart copywriters also leverage social proof extensively. People follow the crowd, especially when uncertainty exists. Customer testimonials, expert endorsements, and usage statistics all provide powerful persuasion.

# Word Choice: The Difference Between Good and Great

Your vocabulary directly impacts your copywriting effectiveness. Certain words create stronger emotional responses, trigger more curiosity, and compel more action.

The five most persuasive words in copywriting are:
- ""You"" (creates personal connection)
- ""Free"" (removes financial risk)
- ""Because"" (provides logical justification)
- ""Instantly"" (promises immediate gratification)
- ""New"" (triggers curiosity and freshness)

Build a personal collection of power words that energize your copy. But remember: powerful words mean nothing without clear, simple communication. Avoid jargon that confuses readers.

# Precision: Saying More with Less

Professional copywriters often work within strict word limits or pay-per-word arrangements. Every word must earn its place through maximum impact and utility.

Here's a transformative exercise: Write your copy to the required length, then challenge yourself to cut it in half without losing essential information. Then cut it in half again. This forces you to identify truly essential elements and eliminate unnecessary filler.

The result? Copy that respects readers' time while delivering maximum impact per word.

# Call-to-Action Mastery: Closing the Sale

Even brilliant copy fails without compelling calls-to-action. Your CTA tells readers exactly what to do next and what they can expect from taking action.

Effective CTAs are:
- Specific and actionable (""Download your free guide now"")
- Benefit-focused (""Get instant access to insider secrets"")
- Urgency-creating (""Limited time: Save 50% today"")
- Visually prominent (larger, colorful, impossible to miss)

Use imperative verbs that command attention: ""Start,"" ""Discover,"" ""Transform,"" ""Get,"" ""Join."" These words create momentum and urgency.

# The AIDA Formula: Your Copywriting GPS

When facing blank pages, the AIDA formula provides reliable structure for effective copy. It ensures you hit every essential element in logical order.

**Attention:** Capture interest immediately through compelling headlines, surprising statistics, or relatable problems. You have seconds to hook readers, so make them count.

**Interest:** Maintain engagement through your value proposition and benefit-focused copy. Show readers why they should care about your solution.

**Desire:** Create emotional investment by emphasizing transformational benefits and providing social proof. Help readers visualize their improved lives.

**Action:** Direct readers toward specific next steps through clear, compelling calls-to-action. Remove friction and make the process obvious.

AIDA works because it mirrors natural decision-making psychology. People need attention-grabbing reasons to stop, interesting benefits to continue reading, emotional desire to want change, and clear action steps to actually buy.

# Your Copywriting Journey Starts Today

The copywriting landscape offers unlimited opportunities for those willing to master the craft. Whether you're seeking freelance freedom, agency experience, or in-house security, skilled copywriters remain in high demand across every industry.

But remember: copywriting isn't just about writing pretty words. It's about understanding human psychology, solving real problems, and creating genuine value for businesses and customers alike.

The most successful copywriters combine systematic skills with creative thinking, strategic planning with emotional intelligence, and disciplined practice with continuous learning.

Start with one format. Master it completely. Then expand your skills systematically until you can handle any copywriting challenge with confidence.

The world needs more copywriters who understand that great copy doesn't just sell products ‚Äì it transforms lives, builds businesses, and creates genuine connections between brands and people.

Your copywriting journey starts with a single word. Then another. Then another. Before you know it, you'll be crafting copy that converts strangers into customers and dreams into reality.

If possible, would appreciate if you could please suggest one or two games rather than a list. It‚Äôs really hard to narrow down games just off reviews and ratings

1n9jn2f,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n9jn2f,54mm Blind shaker vs WDT,"In an effort to declutter my coffee station a little I decided to try switching from: 

- Dosing cup
- Dosing funnel
- WDT tool

To just: 
- Blind shaker

This definitely helped clear things up, the workflow is a little faster, and I have much less junk lying around... but I'm not entirely sure on the feel of the process.

Pouring from the Niche's 58mm dosing cup into the dosing funnel in my 54mm basket was always a little awkward, and the WDT tool made a bit of a mess, but I got nice puck prep and good coffee.

This MHW 3Bomber blind shaker is perfect to grind straight into, but is a little awkward to empty 18.5g from and seems to introduce some minor clumps again after settling the grounds down into the basket so I can lift the shaker off. It also leaves a noticeable ring of less grounds around the edge of the basket(see pic 3) as it fits 51-54mm baskets and therefore doesn't have as wide an opening as it could for 54mm.

The coffee in the cup is coming out well and is tasty, so I don't have a problem with the end result, but the slightly awkward emptying is kind of annoying.

Are all blind shakers like this, or is this just a ""feature"" of one with a 50mm exit hole?!

1n9jn1x,https://v.redd.it/rla9ybfoefnf1,IMPROVE OR QUIT (rant),"Hi Emma this isn‚Äôt related to your lazy self, I‚Äôve giving up on you a long time ago


The girls often say they don‚Äôt like vlogging outside their bathrooms or car because they‚Äôre shy and don‚Äôt want to overwhelm someone with the camera. BS. If my friend is an influencer well I‚Äôm expecting them to take a picture of the food, or if they‚Äôre a YouTube id expect them to be vlogging. If I have a problem with it I simply won‚Äôt hangout with them. 


How are you shy of vlogging outside when it‚Äôs 2025, everyone has social media. If I see someone talking to a vlog camera outside I ask them what‚Äôs their YouTube, so I could support n probably motivate them that what they‚Äôre doing isn‚Äôt weird. Secondly why are you guys constantly hanging out with people who hate when you vlog! Basically not supportive of your career. The cosplay WAG sister is a joke of potential, could‚Äôve had such cool video content ‚Äúbut wants to respect her husband‚Äôs career, friends, n environment‚Äù. Firstly your husband‚Äôs environment is entertainment, there‚Äôs cameras all the time, the events y‚Äôall go to there‚Äôs cameras. So many WAGs share cool perspectives. Your husband also knew you were a YouTuber prior to marrying you, so wouldn‚Äôt he know you would film too? ‚ÄúRespect his friends‚Äù‚Ä¶ girl y‚Äôall are already posting vids on insta stories, they‚Äôre posting it too, ofc there‚Äôs probably those who want privacy but other than that just show us an extend version of your insta stories. 




Now Margaret, you‚Äôre single, actually posses a personality, able to travel and seem to have lots of friends. SHOW US! The friends you hangout with are influencers or YouTubers themselves! Show us funny moments. Stop rambling in your bathroom as if you have a phobia of talking outside. It‚Äôs just not making sense on why you don‚Äôt ‚Äúthink we want to see you hanging out with friends‚Äù when that‚Äôs what people have been asking for, for yearssss. I mean look at Kylie‚Äôs friend StassieBaby who posts such great quality vlogs!!!  You and your sister also need to stop click baiting just title every video ‚ÄúTalking in bathroom‚Äù ‚Äútalking in car‚Äù ‚Äúclips of Pilates, coffee and basic makeup‚Äù



Disclaimer:OFC I‚Äôm not saying they should vlog every moment and not respect someone‚Äôs boundaries. But just enough with the bullshit excuses. I get it it‚Äôs they‚Äôre channel, but they are influencers who are displaying their lifestyles, not Pilates instructors, coffee baristas or makeup artists (their makeup is below beginner level).

1n9jm9t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Laundromats/comments/1n9jm9t/laundro_cafe_entertainment/,Laundro Cafe + Entertainment,"Input is greatly appreciated for a business concept that ive been brewing. 

A laundromat cafe + entertainment space.
Laundry takes about 1-2.5 hours depending on the load size, laundry time, folding etc.
During the waiting period, I figured it would be nice to have access to WiFi, sip on some coffee/tea and have some entertainment (comedians, DJ‚Äôs musicians) perform in the background. This laundromat would bring together community. It would be a space to get work done. It would be a place to showcase local talent.

Location is ideal. Upfront + recurring cost would surmount the typical loan for a standard laundromat. Staff considerations include a barista, maintenance person and shop manager. It‚Äôs a hybrid essential service. 

Payments can be via cash or CC. Need to factor in cost for washers, dryers, laundry supply, a POS, sound system, barista setup, inventory, installation/renovation cost, utilities, cafe furniture, architect/engineering/permitting, marketing, etc. guessing a loan of about $500k with a 60 month payoff period and $140k - $250k annual revenue. 

Is this worth it? It‚Äôs just an idea and curious to know if this is something worth pursuing or a long shot. 

The demand for laundromats has shown a steady increase over the past 5 years. Any insight or considerations would be greatly appreciated.
