1n1cz6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/combin/comments/1n1cz6c/how_to_actually_grow_on_instagram_with_short/,How to Actually Grow on Instagram with Short Videos,"A couple of years ago, Instagram was all about polished photos and perfect grids. Now? A scrappy 20-second clip often gets way more traction than an expensive photoshoot. If you’re trying to grow, short videos (Reels, Stories) are where it’s at. They’re quick, fun, and honestly easier to make than most people think.

Here’s the breakdown 👇

# Why Short Videos Work

[The numbers back it up](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/social-media-video-statistics/?ref=blog.aivideocut.com). Studies and public data show that [videos under 60 seconds generate higher average engagement rates than single-photo or long-form video posts](https://cropink.com/instagram-media-marketing-statistics?ref=blog.aivideocut.com). Brands, influencers, and educators are seeing more shares, more comments, and more follows from videos made in vertical format, usually filmed on a regular phone.

* People scroll fast. Short clips means easier to watch to the end.
* The algorithm *loves* pushing Reels and Stories to new audiences (Explore page, suggested posts, etc).
* They let your personality shine instantly—like that funny pet clip or 30-sec hack you couldn’t resist saving.
* Stats show videos under 60 seconds get more engagement than photos or long videos.

So yeah, they’re not just a trend. They work.

# What Makes a Video Actually Watchable

* **Hook fast** – The first 2 seconds decide if someone stays or swipes. Start with the “good part.”
* **Vertical + good light** – Shoot upright, use window light, avoid cave darkness.
* **Clear audio/text** – Lots of people watch muted → add captions or bold text.
* **Keep it moving** – Cut pauses, speed up boring parts.
* **Natural call-to-action** – Ask a question, invite opinions, “Would you try this?” works better than “Smash that follow.”

# Content Ideas That Don’t Suck

You don’t need trends or copying big creators. Try these instead:

* Quick fixes: show how you solve small problems in under a minute.
* Micro-stories: setup → action → payoff, all within 30 seconds.
* Behind-the-scenes: show bloopers, not just perfect results.
* Fast demos: “How to fold a shirt in 3 secs” or “Quick coffee hack.”
* Jump-cut moments: flashes from your day, sped up with music.
* Relatable “did you know?” facts or mini myth-busting.

# Where to Find Endless Ideas

* Questions in your DMs/comments → answer them on video.
* Old photo posts → re-do them as short videos.
* Your own mistakes/outtakes → people love them.
* Trending sounds → put your spin on them (don’t just lip-sync).

# Filming Tips (No Fancy Gear Needed)

* Face a window = instant better lighting.
* Keep audio clear (quiet room or record VO later).
* Prop your phone on books if you don’t have a tripod.
* Plan beginning/middle/end, but embrace messy takes.
* Edit out dead time—tight cuts are king.
* Add captions or music before posting.

# Handy Tools (Optional, But Fun)

* [AI Video Cut](https://www.aivideocut.com) – Turn long vids/webinars into Reels automatically.

* **BigVu** – On-screen teleprompter.
* **Life Lapse** – Easy stop-motion or timelapse.
* **Dolby On** – Cleaner audio recording.
* **InShot** – Quick edits, trims, crops.
* **CapCut** – Auto captions, stylized text.

But the more I added, the more overwhelmed I felt.

Eventually, I flipped the script. I started removing instead of adding, and focusing on one small, intentional action each week. A few that stuck:

* Drinking a glass of water before coffee instead of tracking hydration apps
* Writing one line in a notebook instead of aiming for full journaling sessions
* Pausing for a breath before opening my laptop, instead of diving straight into noise

Each of these was tiny, but they created a kind of calm rhythm in my week that felt more sustainable than chasing new systems.

I also came across a short weekly email called The Quiet Hustle that reinforces this idea of doing less, but with more meaning. It really helped me lean into simplicity rather than hustle.

1n1cwtq,https://www.reddit.com/r/vividmoo/comments/1n1cwtq/is_an_ice_maker_a_task/,"Is an Ice Maker a ""Task""?","Ice makers, these small kitchen appliances, always spark debate. Some consider them a ""quality-of-life artifact,"" while others scoff at them, dismissing them as a complete waste of money.

Let's first consider the opposing view: Ice trays cost only a few dollars, can be thrown in the freezer overnight, and still have ice cubes the next day. However, ice makers take up space and require an electrical outlet. For those who only enjoy cold drinks occasionally, they seem a bit redundant.

But the supporting arguments are clear: Ice trays need to be prepared in advance, leading to the common embarrassment of forgetting to freeze ice when you want a cold drink, not to mention the potential for splashing ice when you tap the tray. The advantage of an ice maker is that it's always available, ready to use in minutes, and guaranteed to produce ice cubes of uniform size and high transparency. Some models even automatically store ice, making them perfectly adequate for summer guests.

So, whether it's a waste of money really depends on your needs. If you only enjoy cold drinks occasionally, ice trays are perfectly adequate. But if your home frequently needs ice, or you're looking for a little ""lifestyle ritual,"" an ice maker isn't a waste of money. After all, being able to enjoy the ""crackling"" sound of ice cubes on a hot summer day is a joy in itself.

Ultimately, whether it's a worthwhile investment or not depends on your lifestyle. Some consider it a luxury, while others consider it a magical cooling device. Just like a coffee maker, some people can't live without it, while others don't care at all.

From little scooters weaving through traffic to bigger models parked outside coffee shops, it felt like they were part of the culture. Naturally, I started looking at prices, because I figured it might be cheaper than back home. And honestly, it was, but not in a straightforward way. I learned that prices can vary a lot depending on the shop, the city, or even if you’re looking online versus in person.

A friend of mine who was a local actually warned me not to jump on the first “cheap” deal I saw. He told me to compare, and that’s when I realized platforms like Alibaba can be helpful since you can see listings from different sellers and regions, which gives you a baseline before walking into a shop. 

I remember even seeing price gaps just by leaving Bangkok and checking smaller dealers outside the city. It made me think that buying a motorcycle there is less about finding the one big bargain, and more about knowing where to look.

Firstly some more general tips: 

wear your fragrance on your pulse points (the warmth will make it project more), don’t rub it when you apply (the top notes will evaporate too quickly) and apply just enough so that you get whiffs of it yourself during the day. That’s how you know someone standing close enough to you will think you smell good too ;)

I also suggest looking for clones of expensive fragrances if you find one you like - I’m a student so I only ever buy 10ml sizes of fragrances, or dupes of them, and some brands like Noted Aromas or Dossier can be like 95% if you’re not too picky.


Now onto fragrance suggestions: I’m non-binary and masc and I LOVE a unisex fragrance! They can be so gender affirming and also sexy hehe but I also wear some more masculine/feminine fragrances depending on the day

SO first some ‘skin-like’ fragrance suggestions:

- Glossier You Doux, relatively affordable and woody and soft, like an old church but cozy
- Le Labo Another 13, kinda smells like a magazine but in this fresh unique way! Molecular and musky af
- Nemat Amber, SUPER affordable if you’re in the US/Canada and it’s such a delicious musky scent
- Clean Skin, a musky fragrance with chocolate and salt as notes. makes you smell like you taste good 😋 

now for some of my fav unisex fragrances:

- Replica When the Rain Stops, the fragrance that got me into all this! Citrusy but also watery and also woody and floral and honestly everything
- Byredo G Water, an aromatic vanilla that has the comfort of vanilla without being too sweet
- Le Labo Santal 33 - THE woody fragrance. the cardamom in this is quite strong to me but I still love it
- Killian Angels’ Share - literally smells like a boozy apple pie. I wear this constantly during December

some more feminine fragrances:

- Diptyque Do Son, a really beautiful light floral tuberose fragrance
- YSL Black Opium, sweet as hell with a coffee note, great for evenings
- SDJ 62, you’ll recognise it but it is honestly great, it smells like summer and the beach

and some more masculine fragrances:

- Rabanne Invictus, wow this is beautiful! it’s sweet at first, like bubblegum, but still masculine and aquatic
- Creed Aventus, fresh and fruity with a woody base, smells affirming 
- Replica Jazz Club - this is my night out fragrance, it’s boozy and leathery and sexy!

For context, I’m based in Northern Europe, not the U.S.

I hold a BA and MA in Comparative Politics, specializing in policy analysis and regulation. I’m not formally trained in environmental studies, but I’m very interested in EUDR, ESRS, and ESG—especially how EU regulation affects private business in real time, and how new directives can be integrated in ways that are both profitable and sustainable.

I’ve worked in the specialty coffee industry for about nine years, starting as a part-time barista during school. After completing my MA, I went full-time at a specialty coffee roastery with a strong international presence (edited to say that this wasn't voluntary, I struggled with the job market and was offered a full-time job there, which I accepted). Coffee is an agricultural industry full of political, environmental, and social issues, which I find very interesting and engaging.

Currently, I hold a hybrid role: operational café manager (leading a team of 11, handling budgets, admin, service, training, and team development) and sustainability lead, a position I created last fall to better use my education. I also run courses for the company internally and externally. Lately, I’ve focused on applying ESRS in a smaller business context, exploring how to integrate sustainability into daily operations.

I’d like to transition into sustainability full-time and build a long-term career in the field, ideally growing into an expert role. Perhaps a move into corporate could help me gain experience. My hesitation is that aside from my current role, I don’t have extensive post-grad work experience, and I’d prefer not to go back for another degree since most companies seem to value experience over more education. That said, I’m very open to taking courses or certifications to boost my competency.

Any advice on how best to position myself and move forward would be much appreciated!",1,1756288441.0,Environmental_Careers,0,1.0,False

I’m just confused right now. Would appreciate if medical professionals would also read it and give some opinion.

21F, first post

8 years ago I was 13 years old, healthy and active, normal weight but has always been much taller than my peers (176 cm at that age as a girl). 

I had an annual health check-up at the school. I have always been very anxious about doctor appointments, and that year i started to have health anxiety and also literally felt my pulse and blood pressure go up in the sky when the examination was announced. As far as I remember, the nurse measured my systolic bp about 170-180, my pulse 140 and became very concerned, asked me if i felt okay or whether i have drunk coffe, energy drink or coke. I felt perfectly fine physically except the crippling anxiety, I remember my extremities tremoring like never before during the appointment and also, i have never ever drank caffeinated drinks, not even coke. With the doctor, they gave me one pill of Tensiomin (captopril) that was supposed to lower blood pressure immediately, but it didn’t work for me, they kept measuring the same high values and they were about to call an ambulance. I remember I was crying in despair, i thought i had cancer or some serious disease and that’s why my blood pressure was above the roof. Eventually they called my mother because I wasn’t feeling sick, and told her to bring me to a doctor ASAP.

When we got home, my parents took my blood pressure and it was about 125. I don’t remember the exact values as it was 8 years ago. Once at the GP’s, my blood pressure went sky high again. The doc didn’t believe we measured a normal value at home, he told me our blood pressure measuring device is probably faulty. He told my parents it’s possible that I was going to have a stroke at night. I was referred to the hospital where they did a lot of tests, bloodwork, ECG, ultrasound of the neck, heart and abdomen and everything came back completely fine. My blood pressure kept being high as I was so anxious in the medical settings. They didn’t start me on meds just sent me back to the GP. (we live in a rural area and there was no pediatrician, every generation had the same GP, he is a harsh man in his 70s)

In the upcoming 2 weeks my GP asked me to go to his office every afternoon after school to measure my blood pressure and also to measure it at home. I measured normal values (115-125/70-80) at home and very high values at the doctor’s. I remember one time he told me, if it’s really white-coat hypertension, then he will take off his white coat, leave the office and let his assistant nurse take my blood pressure. Of course it didn’t help at all.. So he started me on anti-hypertensive medications that i’ve been taking since then. He told me if i don’t take them, i will get a stroke and die before my 20th birthday. I believed the problem is serious and took the pills, but during the first weeks/months they caused me some chest pain and extreme sleepiness. Also, when in the bathroom with a hot shower or during the warm summer months i often feel like fainting at any time. 

My medications:
5 mg bisoprolol
2 mg perindopril
0,625 mg indapamid 

At the same time I got an ABPM for 24 hours, that measured normal values, the average was around 112-118 (I also don’t remember exactly), but the first and last values were taken at the doctor’s and those were 150-160. I remember the GP told us after this that my blood pressure was indeed normal, but just continue with the medication because I’m high risk due to family history and my above average height at my age. I was an innocent 13-year-old without any kind of medical knowledge so i just accepted it. But I have always felt so ashamed of these because hypertension is toughgt to be a disease of the older, with a bad lifestyle, obesity, and I didn’t fit it.

I also remember that same year after Christmas I caught a stomach bug or some food poisoning, and as I was vomiting all night, my parents called the GP, who told them to go to the hospital immediately because nausea and womiting can also be DUE TO HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. No, it was ‘just’ food poisoning.

So I’ve been taking the meds for 8 years with annual check-ups. My bloods are perfect, ecg is perfect, but I have a high blood pressure and heart rate at the doctor’s and a permanent label of chronically ill. In the first year my GP also banned me from swimming training because he insisted competitive sport is dangerous with a blood pressure like that, but I returned a year later to the swimming pool arbitrarily because I missed it so much, i just haven’t competed anymore. I also feel like I can’t really increase my performance in sport as my peers can. Also my resting heart rate is around 45-55 bpm. 

During the past 3 years I gained some medical knowledge and I’m starting to question if my treatment was right. I feel like all this was just white coat hypertension. But my body has adapted to the medications, if I accidentally skip a day, my pulse goes wild during minimal  physical activity, and when I take it again, I feel extrasystoles for a few hours. This wasn’t the case in the beginning and it’s getting more pronounced as the years go by. I’ve also learned recently that indapamid is a diuretic, and I can’t understand why i’m taking a diuretic. I mean, I never had oedema nor heart or kidney disease, I’m thin and muscular. I also know that this diuretic and also bisoprolol can increase the risk of insulin resistance and type2 diabetes and high cholesterol, and this means more chronic diseases and medications and doctor visits are on the corner. Yes, I still have health anxiety.

 I also remember going to other doctors for some different issues and taking medical history, two of them questioned why I’m taking so many medications so young. All I can say is that my GP prescribed it and I have adapted to them.

By no means do I want to outsmart my doctors, but I have a hard time understanding my situation. I’m 21, with a normal weight (182 cm, 68 kg), doing sports 3-4 times a week, also walking a lot, I’ve never been overweight, never smoke, never drink alkohol, 1 cup of coffee in the morning the past 2 years but not every day, no other medical issues, eat healthy. Only risk is family history on my father’s side but they have a pretty bad lifestyle compared to me. 

Is there any chance I could stop any of these medications in the future just gradually with supervision of a different doctor or idk, this whole thing is so frustrating as I hear others’ stories of a hypertension diagnosis, it’s so different than mine. And I’m so young and concerned about the long-term effects.

1n1cnvm,https://www.reddit.com/r/FITPULSE/comments/1n1cnvm/the_1_sciencebacked_diet_hack_for_burning_fat/,The #1 Science-Backed Diet Hack for Burning Fat Fast!The #1 Science-Backed Diet Hack for Burning Fat Fast!,"When it comes to \*\*rapid fat loss\*\*, many people fall prey to trends and fads that promise instant results but fail to deliver long-term success. However, science consistently points us toward one highly effective, evidence-backed strategy: \*\*intermittent fasting combined with strategic nutrient timing\*\*. This approach not only accelerates fat loss but also optimizes metabolic health, making it the most sustainable and efficient diet hack for anyone serious about transforming their body.

— -

\## \*\*Why Intermittent Fasting Works for Fat Burning\*\*

Intermittent fasting is not just another diet — it is a \*\*metabolic reset\*\*. By cycling between periods of eating and fasting, the body is forced to switch from burning glucose as its primary energy source to tapping into \*\*stored body fat\*\*. Studies published in \*The New England Journal of Medicine\* confirm that intermittent fasting enhances \*\*insulin sensitivity\*\*, lowers blood sugar levels, and triggers cellular repair processes.

When we extend the fasting window, the body enters a state of \*\*ketosis\*\*, where fat becomes the dominant energy source. This metabolic switch significantly accelerates fat loss while preserving lean muscle mass — something traditional calorie-cutting diets struggle to achieve.

— -

\## \*\*Nutrient Timing: The Secret Accelerator\*\*

While intermittent fasting alone delivers powerful results, pairing it with \*\*nutrient timing\*\* multiplies its fat-burning potential. Strategic nutrient timing means consuming the right macronutrients at the right time of day to maximize energy and fat utilization.

\* \*\*Protein first:\*\* Breaking your fast with high-quality protein sources like eggs, lean poultry, or plant-based protein powders helps stabilize blood sugar and supports muscle repair.  
\* \*\*Carbohydrates post-workout:\*\* Consuming complex carbohydrates such as quinoa, oats, or sweet potatoes after exercise ensures glycogen replenishment without fat storage.  
\* \*\*Healthy fats during fasting windows:\*\* A small intake of fats like avocado, nuts, or MCT oil can extend satiety and keep energy levels stable while maintaining fat oxidation.

This precise structuring of nutrients prevents hormonal spikes that contribute to fat storage and keeps the body in a \*\*fat-burning mode\*\* throughout the day.

— -

\## \*\*The Role of Hormones in Rapid Fat Loss\*\*

Science shows that fat loss is not simply about calories in versus calories out. \*\*Hormones dictate fat storage and release\*\*, and intermittent fasting combined with nutrient timing optimizes these powerful regulators.

\* \*\*Insulin:\*\* Lower fasting insulin levels enable stored fat to be released and burned efficiently.  
\* \*\*Human Growth Hormone (HGH):\*\* Fasting increases HGH production, which enhances fat metabolism and supports lean muscle preservation.  
\* \*\*Leptin & Ghrelin:\*\* These hunger-regulating hormones stabilize, reducing cravings and preventing overeating.

When these hormones are balanced, the body becomes a \*\*fat-burning machine\*\*, leading to faster and more sustainable results.

— -

\## \*\*Scientific Evidence Behind This Diet Hack\*\*

Research published in \*Cell Metabolism\* revealed that individuals practicing time-restricted eating lost significantly more fat while maintaining lean mass compared to those on traditional diets. Furthermore, studies from the \*Journal of Translational Medicine\* showed that intermittent fasting can reduce body weight by up to \*\*8% in just 12 weeks\*\*, proving its unmatched effectiveness for rapid fat loss.

The addition of nutrient timing ensures that the body remains fueled, performance is optimized, and metabolic function is enhanced — making it the most comprehensive fat-burning solution.

— -

\## \*\*Practical Steps to Implement the Science-Backed Diet Hack\*\*

1. \*\*Choose a fasting window:\*\* The 16:8 method (16 hours fasting, 8 hours eating) is the most popular and sustainable.  
2. \*\*Break your fast strategically:\*\* Begin with protein-rich, nutrient-dense foods.  
3. \*\*Train in a fasted state:\*\* Light cardio or resistance training before breaking the fast amplifies fat burning.  
4. \*\*Prioritize hydration:\*\* Drinking water, black coffee, or green tea during the fasting window enhances satiety and metabolism.  
5. \*\*Time your carbohydrates:\*\* Reserve starchy carbs for post-workout meals to maximize recovery and fat loss.  
6. \*\*Include healthy fats:\*\* Add sources like olive oil, chia seeds, or fatty fish for long-lasting energy.

— -

\## \*\*The Bottom Line: The Fastest Route to Fat Loss\*\*

The #1 science-backed diet hack for burning fat fast is the \*\*fusion of intermittent fasting with nutrient timing\*\*. This powerful combination forces the body into fat-burning mode, regulates hormones, and sustains energy levels without the pitfalls of restrictive dieting. Unlike short-lived trends, this approach is rooted in scientific evidence and designed for lasting success.

By adopting this strategy, we don’t just lose fat — we \*\*retrain our metabolism\*\* to work with us rather than against us. For anyone determined to achieve visible results quickly and sustainably, this is the proven path that stands above all others.",1,1756288159.0,FITPULSE,0,1.0,False

What can I do to get him back?","My ex (21M) and I (21F) were together for 4 and a half years, and in march this year I broke up with him. I felt like i was going through a hard stage and didn't know what to do with my life so I thought maybe the relationship was not the right decision. It was a great relationship and I don't necessarily regret it because it is what I wanted at the time, but I look back and realise that it was a mistake. He was heartbroken and so was I. We had no contact for 5 weeks after the initial breakup, then he contacted my mum to go for coffee because they have always been very close, he then told her that he missed me and would want to try and be with me again. We then met up a few days later to speak about things and basically from that day on we went back to how we used to be in a relationship but without the relationship title. There was one or two times he got really overwhelmed and upset about the breakup (which is quite out of character for him as he is very laid back). Then anytime I would bring up us being back in a relationship again he said he didn't know and that kind of thing. Then one night probably a month and a half after seeing him for the first time he said we needed to talk. I knew it wasnt going to be good and he told me that he doesn't think he wants to be in a relationship with me as his feelings are not the same as he used to be and that he was sorry cause he originally said he would want a relationship, and then he said he would really want to be friends and stay in contact as he cares about me a lot but understands if I would not want that. I asked him why he stopped liking me and he said he doesn't know why he just doesn't (idk if hes just saying that to save my feelings). I was obviously upset but still wanted to be friends. So a few weeks go by and I am still very upset and I want to get him back, but he was being quite distant as I think he wanted to set boundaries and not let me think there was anything. Eventually he starts being more kind, wanting to see me more, messaging me more and that kind of thing. There was even 2 times where we got intimate which we should not have done but it was just in the moment. so I was on a call with him one night and I was a bit upset and I accidentally said that I did still like him and thought he might've started to like me back, however he shut me down and said sorry if I gave you the wrong impression but I don't like you like that. And i asked if he could ever like he again, and he said something like ""look I will never say never cause you never know but right now no I don't see that happening"". This really hurt me and for the next few weeks it really messed with my mental health, so one morning I decided that maybe I needed a break from seeing him for a while so I asked him to come over and I told him this and he said that ""obviously I dont want this but if its what you want then ofc we will do that"" and he got really upset and even cried about it and said stuff like ""it'll be weird to not message you about my day and just talk to you about anything"" and then right before he was about to leave I decided not to go through with it because he said something like I just need to rip the bandaid off, and thats what my friend told me when I wanted to break up with him which I regretted so I decided that it would not be the best idea for right now, and that I should just focus on trying to see my friends more as well. That was probably over a month and a half ago now and since then I feel like we have just gotten closer and closer. We speak more, he compliments me more, things that he originally said no to doing with me like go out on a Saturday for a few drinks he now has said yes too. Hes more playful with me like he used to be, when we hug each other I have noticed he hugs me for a bit longer than usual, a bit more touchy and in the past week or 2 we have been intimate a few more times, however every time he will say either ""if we do something it doesnt mean anything"", or more recently ""idk if this is the best idea"". Originally it seemed like he just wanted me to start liking someone else but now hes a little jealous if I tell him about a guy that might be flirting with me or something. Even the other day as a joke I said something along the lines of ""you better not be having sex with anyone else"" and he said something like ""I could say the same for you"" and named the guys at work who might have messaged me or something, like surly he should not care if he did not like me at all. He has said that he still is attracted to me, and that I am one of his best friends. the other day as well I asked him why he does all these fun activities with his friends but with me we tend to just chill and not do much, and he said that its because with them its not as easy to just chill with them whereas with me he still has lots of fun without needing to do anything. There obviously is a lot more to the story but I just need to know if I'm imagining things or if his feelings have shifted but at the end of the day wouldn't he say something if he did like me now? I just dont know if I should keep hoping that one day he will like me again.",2,1756288135.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

1n1cku0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpotlessSecrets/comments/1n1cku0/reveal_if_glad_forceflex_trash_bags_truly_control/,Reveal if GLAD ForceFlex Trash Bags Truly Control Odor Well,"Using the Glad 61164 ForceFlex Tall Kitchen Drawstring Trash Bags on a daily basis has taught me a lot about its performance and quirks. My kitchen sees plenty of activity, with kids tossing in snack wrappers, me scraping off cutting board leftovers, and the occasional heavier cleanup after cooking experiments gone wrong. Testing these trash bags over weeks, I feel prepared to share honest observations.

**Durability and Tear Resistance**  
In a busy household like mine, a flimsy trash bag just won't cut it. These bags boast the ForceFlex technology, which truly lives up to its name. Even when I stuffed them with vegetable peels, broken glass from a dropped jar, and even damp coffee grounds, there were no accidental spills. The stretchable material adjusted beautifully to sharp and irregularly shaped items, and those drawstring handles are a lifesaver when hauling a full bag out to the bin without worrying about it ripping halfway.

**Scent and Odor Control**  
Any kitchen trash bag claiming to contain odor can make me either skeptical or hopeful; this product pleasantly surprised me. The Gain Original Scent with Febreze Freshness doesn’t just mask smells—it genuinely neutralizes them. Unpleasant odors from things like onion peels or meat scraps never escaped the bag. Even after a particularly smelly meal prep day, the kitchen smelled as fresh as if I had just mopped the floor. However, some reviews I skimmed suggested the fragrance might be overwhelming for those who prefer unscented bags or are sensitive to artificial smells.

[Check Glad 61164 price on Amazon.](https://blog.senaar.com/p/b0c2j4wr29/)

**Capacity and Size Fit**  
The 13-gallon size is a perfect match for standard kitchen trash cans, at least in my experience. With 150 bags in the box, it saved me numerous trips to restock. Whether dealing with a post-dinner cleanup or a low-effort declutter, these bags could handle the load comfortably. Their tall structure meant no awkward cramming or stretching to fit into the bin.

**Ease of Use**  
One thing I genuinely appreciated was the drawstring closure. Unlike some trash bags that feel like a wrestling match to tie up, these sealed effortlessly, allowing me to carry even an overstuffed bag one-handed. My teenager (who’s tasked with taking the trash out) praised this feature too, calling it “easy mode” for garbage duty!

**Benefits**  
- Impressive tear and puncture resistance, making them ideal for households where garbage can include sharp or heavy materials.  
- Effective odor control, eliminating kitchen smells while leaving behind only a pleasant fragrance.  
- Convenient drawstring design that allows quick and efficient sealing and handling.  

**Limitations**  
- The noticeable fragrance might not be appealing to everyone, especially if you prefer a neutral aroma.  
- ForceFlex flexibility sometimes felt like it could stretch such that items inside would poke awkwardly, though they never tore.  

**Market Rivals**  
In comparison to some other brands I've tried, including commonly seen products like Hefty and store brands, these perform slightly better in terms of tear resistance and scent control. Hefty’s products are often sturdy but don't tackle odors as effectively. Conversely, store brand options save a few bucks but tend to tear easily, especially when dealing with heavier trash. While I’d say Glad’s stretchable material gives it an edge, certain users who value unscented options might lean toward competitors offering fragrance-free varieties.

**Cost Efficiency**  
For the features you’re getting, I’d label them solidly worth the investment. Every bag pulled its weight without surprise failures, and the stretchable design reduced the need to double-bag—which can quietly jack up costs if you're not careful. Plus, the included scent and odor protection add extra value that similar products sometimes lack.

Hey folks,  
I’m struggling to dial in my espresso and could use some advice. My setup is a Hibrew H10b (set at 93°C, pre-infusion off) with a Kingrinder K6 and the double non-pressurized basket. I usually dose 14 g and aim for around 28 g out.

Here’s the issue:

* At **25 clicks**, the machine almost chokes, takes \~30s to pull 28 g, and the shot tastes *incredibly bitter* with a messy flow at the start.
* At **26 clicks**, it runs much faster (\~18s for 28 g) but comes out *sour*.
* Tried lowering dose (13 g at 25 clicks) but it’s still bitter and it comes out much quicker.

Time is measured from the moment coffee starts to come out.  
  
It feels like I’m stuck in a situation where one click changes everything drastically, and I can’t find a balance point between sour and bitter.

I’m using a bag of dark roast beans (it's a local roastery in Palermo, Italy, but I have no idea when they were actually roasted.). I pretty much always get good crema, even when it's sour.

Any suggestions for a series of experiments I could try with this setup? How would you approach dialing in when one click seems to jump from one extreme to the other?

Im introverted and anxious (and most definitely autistic but i'm somewhat attractive so i just get dubbed as a manic pixie dream girl ughhhhhh) so its always been difficult for me to make friends. I have about two friends who i rarely see due to both of them working nightshifts while i work in retail. I also have one close friend who i see on a semi-regular basis but we don't really do that much other than go get lunch, go on a drive or walk and have a smoke.

I no longer have social media on my phone as i was doom scrolling for hours a day and i was done with the same hinge responses on rotation. The most social part of my life, is in work interacting with customers or ironically when i take myself out for the day to roam around city centre for a coffee and to read my book. i don't think i can do it anymore, i am so fed up i feel like running down the shankill in a celtic tracksuit for some entertainment in my life.

But yeah how the fuck does one make friends in this day and age?

A few people told me about classes at the cresent arts centre, our local community hub etc but i want friends who i can do anything with, not just a class. Even so, i don't want to go to a class for the soul purpose to try and make a friend cause then ill most definitely come off as a weirdo lmao.

I enjoy reading, movies, art, nature, photography, spliffs, dark humour and baking!! If anyone wants to go to the cinema/bowling/coffee etc i will shout yippie and start doing the worm.

1 Beatles ashram 

Beatles Ashram, also known as Chaurasi Kutia. It is located on the eastern bank of the Ganges River near the Sawargashram area of Rishikesh.It was established by  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in 1961, as a meditation centre. The ashram gained international attention between February and April 1968 when the English rock band the Beatles studied meditation there, along with celebrities such as Donovan, Mia Farrow and Mike Love.


2 Laxman Jhula to Shivpuri. 

Rent a bike or scooty from Ram Jhula or Laxman Jhula and take a ride for Shivpuri. After riding for 3.4 km, you will find the most beautiful and secular peaceful beach there, less crowded. It is good for enjoying the serenity of Rishikesh. Cold breezes of the Gangana definitely make you calm and composed. 



3. Triveni Ghat.
If you do not want to go for an offbeat location, you can go to Triveni Ghat, explore the local market, eat there and attend the famous Ganga aarti in the evening before coming back to the hotel room.


4. Parmarth Niketan.
You can also attend evening aarti in Parmarth Niketan. You can choose your location as per your convenience. Apart from Ganga aarti, in this area you can find beautiful shops, cafes, and some local stalls as well.

[Interior design in 2025](https://weandthecolor.com/top-10-interior-design-trends-of-2025-the-best-styles-to-transforming-residential-spaces/205454) is bold, layered, and deeply personal. After years of cautious minimalism, homes are once again becoming stages for expression, comfort, and identity. This year, the most influential interior design trends combine sustainability, wellness, and technology with a renewed passion for craft and color.

For design lovers, the question is not *what’s trending,* but *why these styles matter right now.* From eco-conscious materials to wellness-focused spaces, the shifts reflect cultural priorities as much as aesthetics.

Here are the **10 interior design trends shaping homes in 2025**—explained with context, insight, and ideas you can apply.

# 1. Sustainable Materials and Slow Design

Sustainability is no longer optional. Homes in 2025 highlight reclaimed wood, bamboo, cork, and recycled glass. People invest in handcrafted, long-lasting pieces instead of mass-produced furniture. This “slow design” ethos respects both the environment and the craft behind each object.

👉 *Practical tip:* Choose one room where every item has a sustainable backstory—vintage rugs, artisan ceramics, and locally crafted textiles.

# 2. Warm, Expressive Color Palettes

Forget cool grays. The **color palettes of 2025 homes** are warm and emotive: terracotta, plum, forest green, and ochre. Designers pair these hues with tactile fabrics—velvet, suede, and bouclé—for a layered richness. Even neutrals are deeper, leaning toward creamy beiges and soft taupes.

👉 *Practical tip:* Paint a small room (like a powder bathroom) entirely in a bold hue. It creates drama without overwhelming the house.

# 3. Curves and Organic Shapes

From arched doorways to rounded coffee tables, soft geometry rules interiors. The trend reflects a shift toward fluid, nature-inspired forms. Curves make spaces feel inviting and balance the hard edges of modern architecture.

👉 *Practical tip:* Swap a rectangular dining table for an oval one. It softens the room and improves flow.

# 4. Vintage Revival

Designers are pulling history back into the spotlight. Mid-century pieces, Art Deco accents, and even 1970s-inspired patterns resurface. Instead of nostalgia for its own sake, this revival emphasizes durability and soul. Every vintage object adds depth to a contemporary space.

👉 *Practical tip:* Start with one vintage statement piece—like a walnut sideboard or retro light fixture. Build around it with modern accents.

# 5. Confident Maximalism

Minimalism is getting competition. Maximalist interiors—layered with art, pattern, and collectibles—celebrate personality. The appeal lies in curation: every object tells part of a story. It’s less about clutter, more about meaningful abundance.

👉 *Practical tip:* Create a gallery wall from your personal art collection, mixing photography, textiles, and prints in mismatched frames.

# 6. Cozy Minimalism (Japandi 2.0)

Minimalist homes aren’t gone, they’re evolving. The 2025 version is warmer and softer—clean layouts with natural woods, linen upholstery, and earthy tones. Japandi remains influential, blending Japanese restraint with Scandinavian coziness.

👉 *Practical tip:* Keep surfaces clear but layer in soft elements like sheepskin throws, ceramic vases, and handmade paper lamps.

# 7. Biophilic Interiors and Wellness Spaces

Homes now support wellbeing. Think spa-like bathrooms, meditation corners, and natural ventilation. Green walls, potted trees, and water features enhance mood and indoor air quality. Wellness is integrated into architecture, not an afterthought.

👉 *Practical tip:* Dedicate one corner to wellness—add a floor cushion, soft light, and plants for a calming ritual space.

# 8. Multifunctional Living

With more flexible lifestyles, homes are designed to multitask. A bedroom may double as a workspace. A kitchen island might also serve as a homework station. Movable walls and modular furniture make spaces adaptable.

👉 *Practical tip:* Add a fold-down desk in a guest room. It becomes a home office when visitors aren’t around.

# 9. Statement Lighting and Appliances

Lighting is sculpture in 2025. Oversized pendants, glowing spheres, and sculptural floor lamps replace subtle fixtures. Even appliances have personality—fridges in matte jewel tones or brass-trimmed ovens make kitchens expressive.

👉 *Practical tip:* Replace one ordinary light fixture with a bold, artistic piece. It instantly elevates the room.

# 10. Seamless Smart Homes

Technology has matured into invisibility. Smart lighting, thermostats, and hidden speakers integrate without visual clutter. Design now includes tech that supports sustainability, like energy monitors and adaptive LED systems.

👉 *Practical tip:* Invest in dimmable smart lighting. It saves energy and lets you control mood at any time.

# Why These Interior Design Trends Matter in 2025

These trends reflect global values: **sustainability, self-expression, and wellbeing.** Homes are becoming personal sanctuaries rather than showpieces. Instead of following style rules, people are curating spaces that reflect both personal identity and collective priorities.

The question for homeowners isn’t “what’s fashionable?” It’s “what feels authentic, responsible, and inspiring?”

1n1cbbc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1n1cbbc/aita_for_refusing_to_make_amends_with_my_toxic_sil/,AITA for refusing to make amends with my toxic SIL?,"Well, brace yourself as you’re in for a looooong one since it’s been adding up for years before the “big bang”!

Ok, so, for context, my SIL has been married for way longer than I have. She already had a daughter when I met my now-husband. She had her second baby 1 month after I got married. (My parents-in-law did not want their son to marry her by the way, but he ended up doing it despite their repeated advice not to. While I, was very much wanted and instantly welcomed into the family!)

For more context, we live right next to each other. Door-to-door neighbors. And for even more context, the house I moved in after marriage is my husband’s, passed down to him by his father. So technically, his parents are living with us. Since they are literal angels, I refused that they move out, plus the house is pretty big and can easily fit a very large family.

For EVEN MORE context, before I got married, my SIL used to live as a parasite here. She used her house ONLY for showering, getting ready and sleeping. She used to eat, hang around, invite friends over, even hold grandiose birthday parties for her kids… everything here. She never once lit her stove for cooking. All this while badmouthing my husband and his parents (aka her husband’s parents for many reasons, all silly). This slowly slowed down (after a few fights demanding my privacy). She and her husband were not fans of the new rules and boundaries apparently!

She used to get jealous over the most silly stuff. Like if our MIL asked me what I wanted for dinner and did not ask her, she would throw a jealousy fit.
If people showed interest in me and in conversing with me (since most people find me more interesting, based on the fact that she’s a school dropout that knows nothing but gossip, and I am more educated with a better and respectable office job! At least that’s what I gathered from mutual friends! And I grew up respecting everyone, whether educated or not, regardless of the job title) anyway, she would throw a jealousy fit and try to put me down based on my looks (I am on the chubbier side and she’s on the skinnier side, because she starves herself and lives off of energy drinks and coffee!) 
She always showed toxic traits, and tried to hide it. She didn’t always do a great job at that I must admit! 

Her toxic traits became more noticeable when I got pregnant and had my first baby.
For a bit of a background, she left her job as soon as she delivered her second baby (again, 1 month after I got married). She used to bring him over at 7:30 in the morning while I was getting ready for work and leave him with my MIL so she can babysit him, while she went shopping, went for coffee with friends, or simply went to do her nails and spend some alone time. She would come back at 5-5:30 in the afternoon! Mind you, again, she was jobless at the time!!! And never once did she offer my MIL to go over to watch the kids! She always brought them here and left! This changed when I tried imposing some new rules and boundaries, especially that I was expanding my family.
Another example is when I gave birth, some family members and friends were over to congratulate us for the safe birth… she barged in, left her son, and went out for unknown reasons! Her son was crying a lot, as he was sick and just wanted to sleep in his bed. Instead, she left him with us, and a 2-week-old baby who hadn’t yet developed an immune system. ALSO, I HAD VISITORS ffs. This led for my baby to catch whatever virus he had, and be hospitalized at 16 days! 16 days!!!! She never took accountability for it by the way.

So, after that, we’ve had a few fights here and there, all because of silly reasons SHE picked!
For example, one time she swore at our MIL for no reason other than she was showing love to my newborn baby, since she lives with us, it’s only normal! But she couldn’t accept the fact that she was no longer the center of attention. After fighting with our MIL, she sent ME a message picking up a fight!!! I was really surprised, as a few minutes earlier we were texting and I invited her over for coffee! I still have the texts, but I can’t post for privacy!

Anyway, this behavior only grew worse with time, and as our kids were getting older, and since I had my second baby! 
So she has a daughter and a son, and now I also have a daughter and a son. So, she started REALLY comparing, which only fueled her jealousy!!!

Also, an important note: she knows our parents-in-law really love all their grandkids. So whenever a fight occurs, she pressures her husband to forbid their kids from passing by to greet their grandparents. This way they would budge, and she would avoid any responsibility. When we would make amends, it’s because they used to miss the kids, and she would put conditions on letting them see the kids again, which were: no one talks about the fight, no one asks her for any apology, and life moves on as if nothing happened.

Doesn’t this scream NARCISSIST and GASLIGHTING? It is! At its finest.

Soooo, the last fight happened around 3 months ago. It was a fight she picked, but it was the first time I was present! Like in person, physically. Not over text or else.
Something clicked in my brain and I went CRAZY shouting when I heard her badmouth me. (She has this habit of murmuring under her breath, until you lose it, and when faced she says the other person heard wrong, or that she didn’t mean that person, when she actually was… etc. Again, gaslighting).
So, after screaming at each other, she hit my husband! Then, she tried to assault me. Like hit me with an object! Thank God witnesses were present and saw what she did.

The reason for the fight was because her son (a year and a half older than my daughter) was playing with my daughter outside, but he was hurting my daughter while my SIL watched, so I went outside and brought my daughter inside, without talking to her or her son. But she was annoyed at how I “stopped playtime” angrily. 
What do you expect me to do? My daughter was not having fun being a punchbag to your son! 

After the fight she called her husband to come and she started lying saying I started everything. One of the witnesses was my husband’s sister, who expressed that my SIL was lying and that she initiated the fight, and that she hit us first. This lie caused a major problem between my SIL and BIL, as they are not a happy couple, and lying occurs pretty often from both sides for different reasons. They mention divorce every few months… she made it clear numerous times that she’s pretty jealous of the loving relationship I have with my husband, and how he helps me around with house chores and raising the kids… something she very clearly misses in her own marriage/home.

After the fight, her husband said pretty bad words to me, of which I was not deserving! So, annoyed, I banned them from coming over.

Mind you, and also very important, every day off I get, every holiday, every time I have a bit of free time, they.are.here. I can’t seem to be able to catch a break! Nor can I have privacy in my own home!!!

So, family members have been trying to make amends between us. But I am REFUSING! I have never felt like this, ever since getting married. I love my husband to bits, I adore my kids, and I love my parents-in-law! Since the fight, I have more free time, I can go out with my kids more, as I am no longer home-bound tending to my b**** of a SIL and her kids, and entertaining them. I am not, in any way, shape or form willing to give this freedom up! 

Also, side note, all of my husband’s family are on our side as her actions have come to light recently! And the cutting off communication with the grandparents has not been effective this time!! As her intentions have become so clear for everyone!

I really don’t care if my kids won’t grow up with their cousins, as they have other cousins, and these cousins are not well-raised and are a very very very bad influence on my kids!

1n1caen,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1n1caen/aitah_my_boyfriend_keeps_buying_me_things_and_it/,AITAH My boyfriend keeps buying me things and it stresses me out / makes me resentful,"Hi Morgan & Justin! I'm looking for some advice and outside opinion on this current struggle I'm having in my relationship.

My (31) boyfriend and I (27F) have been together for exactly 2 years. Ever since I met him he has nonstop bought me things. The first week I met him he bought me a desk to keep at his house since I work from home and a fan for my nightstand to make sure I'm comfortable sleeping at night as I have always slept with one on since I'm 6/7 years old. I thought wow he is the sweetest guy ever for caring so much about my comfortability.

Now its two years later and I just feel so indebted to him and kind of stressed out and guilty thinking about the amount of money he has spent on me. I come from a very low wealth family. I grew up in a 3 bedroom basement apartment with my mom, my dad and my 6 siblings, a dog and a cat. My mom has rented her whole life and it was always a struggle growing up but I am not resentful of this because it has honestly really made me appreciate the small things in life. Ive expressed many times that i don't need him or want him spending money on me and that due to my upbringing I actually appreciate the much smaller things in life and more meaningful things.

 In the whole two years we have been together he has bought me : A desk, fan, kindle, iPad, makeup vanity, a laptop, 2 coffee machines (Nespresso & Keurig) , a carpet cleaner, he paid for the first and last on our rental, a 2500 cloud couch, a 8/7 rug, 3 Stanley cups,  He pays for all the dates. When we were looking for rentals together he kept looking outside my means & said it was because he wanted me to have the experience of living in luxury. Which was amazing yes because i have never lived in a home with an upstairs and it was always like a dream to me (cheesy i know).

  
It is important to state that I do have Borderline Personality Disorder and that I due struggle with minor paranoia. That being said I don't know if its an ego thing or if I'm just not used to this treatment but I cant help but feel so guilty and uncomfortable and yet also super grateful because I love all the things he has gotten me. Its just for some reason it stresses me out feeling so indebted to him and so guilty that I cant afford the things on my own so he gets them for me, and like a weird power dynamic going on. Especially when we have a lot of ups and downs in our relationship. I have bought some things along the way to but not nearly as much. I often feel like we live way outside my means and its constantly weighing on me.

Sometimes I feel this feeling in my gut that he does not want me to be independent and likes being relied on or providing and when I buy things for myself he is then resentful or has a bit of an attitude,

Its just so hard to trust my own judgement due to my personality disorder..

I've expressed soooo many times the way this effects me and yet nothing has changed.

Naturally, this gets significantly worse if I do anything else. Walking a slow walk to the coffee machine increases the sweat for example.

This has been an issue for me for years which I STUPIDLY never went to the doctors for. I assume sit was just “normal”. 

In recent months it’s got worse. To the point that being stood still I can feel droplets of sweat run down my back. This makes my social anxiety so much worse and o feel gross and self conscious about people seeing me sweat down much. Which in turn makes me worry and sweat more haha.

1n1c5se,https://www.reddit.com/r/China_irl/comments/1n1c5se/from_dead_to_rights_to_nanjing/,From “Dead to Rights” to Nanjing,"When director Shen Ao’s *Dead to Rights* premiered this summer, many viewers walked out of theaters in tears. The film, starring Liu Haoran, is set in 1937, inside a small photography studio in Nanjing. In that studio, a group of apprentices and ordinary citizens risked their lives to preserve images of atrocities committed during the Nanjing Massacre. Those photographs later became critical evidence in postwar trials.

What makes the movie gripping is not only its portrayal of historical trauma, but also how it captures the city of Nanjing itself — a city that has lived through layers of glory, devastation, and rebirth. To watch *Dead to Rights* is to be reminded that every Chinese city is more than bricks and walls; it is a living archive. And Nanjing, perhaps more than any other, embodies the story of China’s past and present.

# Ancient Origins: The Birth of a Capital

Long before the cameras and courtrooms, Nanjing — then known as **Jianye** or **Jinling** — was already a city of significance. Its position on the lower reaches of the Yangtze River made it a natural military stronghold and trading hub. By the third century CE, it became the capital of Eastern Wu during the Three Kingdoms era.

Over the next centuries, Nanjing would serve as the seat of six dynasties, earning it the name **“Six Dynasties Capital.”** Imagine the bustling streets of the Southern Dynasties: scholars debating in bamboo pavilions, poets carving verses about plum blossoms, artisans shaping porcelain that would one day travel along the Silk Road. The city was a place of intellect and artistry, known for its refined culture and elegant living.

Even today, when you walk along the remains of the ancient city wall, you can sense those layers of civilization, each brick whispering of past dynasties that rose and fell.

# A Capital of Ambition: From Ming to the Republic

In 1368, when the Ming dynasty expelled Mongol rule, Nanjing was chosen as the new imperial capital. For nearly two decades, the Ming court governed from here before moving north to Beijing. But the imprint remained: the grand city wall, one of the longest in the world, and structures like the magnificent Zhonghua Gate are living monuments to that era’s ambition.

Centuries later, in the 19th century, Nanjing once again became a capital — but in the most turbulent of ways. It was the headquarters of the **Taiping Heavenly Kingdom**, a radical religious-political movement that challenged the Qing dynasty. Though the rebellion was eventually crushed, the city’s role as the center of upheaval showed how Nanjing always seemed to sit at the epicenter of change.

With the fall of imperial rule, the city was reborn as the capital of the Republic of China in 1927. The “Capital Plan” sought to modernize the city, building avenues, government offices, and universities. Nanjing became not just a symbol of political authority, but also of cultural renaissance and intellectual vigor.

# 1937: Trauma Etched in Memory

Then came December 1937. The Japanese army entered the city, and for six weeks, horror unfolded. Over 300,000 civilians and disarmed soldiers were killed; tens of thousands of women were assaulted. The world remembers this as the **Nanjing Massacre**.

*Dead to Rights* takes us into that moment, not through grand battle scenes, but through the intimacy of a photography studio. Each roll of film developed in secrecy was an act of resistance. Each hidden negative was a refusal to let truth be buried. For the apprentices, their craft became a weapon against forgetting.

This is not only cinema; it is history. Those photographs truly existed, and they became part of the evidence used in the International Military Tribunal for the Far East after World War II. Nanjing was not just a backdrop — it was a witness.

# The Road to Renewal: Post-1949 Nanjing

After the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, Nanjing ceased to be the national capital, but it remained the capital of Jiangsu Province. More importantly, it transformed into a hub of education and research. Universities such as **Nanjing University** and the **Southeast University** turned the city into one of China’s academic centers, producing scientists, engineers, and thinkers who would shape the nation’s modernization.

Walking through modern Nanjing today, one sees a city that holds multiple identities. There are gleaming skyscrapers in Xinjiekou, crowded subway lines, and buzzing coffee shops where young professionals type away on laptops. Yet only a few kilometers away, you can stroll along the Qinhuai River, where lanterns reflect on the water much as they did centuries ago.

# Nanjing Today: Between Memory and Modernity

Nanjing is a city of paradoxes, and perhaps that is its power. It is a site of profound trauma, but also of resilience. It has been a capital of empires, rebels, and republics, yet today it thrives as a provincial city known for research and industry.

Modern visitors often climb **Purple Mountain** to visit the mausoleum of Sun Yat-sen, the “Father of Modern China.” From that vantage point, you can see both the remnants of the Ming city wall and the silhouettes of glass towers. Few places embody the sweep of Chinese history — from feudal dynasties to digital start-ups — so vividly in one panorama.

# Why Nanjing’s Story Matters Globally

For international readers, Nanjing offers more than a Chinese history lesson. It represents the universal themes of **memory, identity, and resilience**. Cities across the world — from Warsaw to Hiroshima — bear scars of violence. Yet they also rise again, carrying those scars as part of their identity.

This is why *Dead to Rights* resonates. The film is about Nanjing, but it is also about the human insistence that truth must be remembered, no matter the cost. Just as those photographs testified against denial, today the city itself testifies: life continues, culture thrives, and history remains present.

# Conclusion: From Film Reel to City Streets

The story of Nanjing is not linear — it is cyclical, layered, sometimes contradictory. To walk its streets is to move between dynasties, revolutions, and modern aspirations. To watch *Dead to Rights* is to glimpse one of its darkest chapters, yet also to witness the courage of ordinary people who chose truth over silence.

Nanjing reminds us that cities are not just places. They are storytellers. And through cinema, history, and lived experience, Nanjing continues to tell the world: *we remember, we endure, we grow.*",0,1756286245.0,China_irl,2,0.5,False

Here's the story of its spectacular collapse","TL;DR: I was hired for a non-existent Amazon job at a t-shirt startup that had a luxury office but no product. For a year, I watched the founder burn cash on cars, NFTs, and other random pivots. The final straw was a pivot to selling overpriced phone cases he'd been scammed into buying. After I actually managed to sell one, I realized the company was doomed and quit. It shut down the very next day.


It all started with a job post on a freelance website. They were looking for someone to manage the Amazon accounts for a t-shirt brand. I applied.


When they called, they said they were actually looking for someone to work from the office, not remotely. Normally, I would have turned it down, but they mentioned they were impressed with my experience and insisted on an interview. Hearing about the exciting plans of a new company, I decided to give it a shot.


I was shocked when I got to the office. It was a two-story, beautifully decorated loft, but it was completely empty. Only the boss was there.


There were no employees yet, no t-shirts produced, and no Amazon store to manage. Nothing. Just the office, luxury furniture, and an espresso machine that made amazing coffee.


As I sipped the perfect espresso my boss made, I thought this was the weirdest job interview of my life. But at the same time, I was impressed by his ""innovative"" and modern attitude.


I accepted the job and started the next day. My boss took me and the few other ""employees"" I met later (his cousin, the CFO; an architecture student; and a foreign trade student) out for a fantastic breakfast.


For the first few weeks, I came and went from the office and did literally ABSOLUTELY nothing.


Because none of the tasks I was hired for (Amazon, social media, e-commerce site) existed yet. When I brought this up, my boss would say, ""We'll get to it, we need to find the designers first."" He even gave me a cash advance for a third of my salary during this period.


After a while, my boss asked me to join the interviews with new designers. Suddenly, I found myself in the role of an HR person. I decided to set aside the absurdity of the situation and see it as an experiment. Soon, two inexperienced designers and a cleaning person joined the team.


My boss bought me an expensive, one-on-one Amazon training course. At first, I thought, ""Wow, he's investing in his employees,"" but when the training was over, we still had not a single product to sell.


It seemed like no one in the office had a clear idea of where the company was actually going.


While this uncertainty continued, my boss was spending an incredible amount of money. Sometimes he'd take me along while he went to buy himself rifles and guns, he was constantly buying and selling luxury cars, and he took us all out to expensive restaurants.


When the designs finally piled up, the topic of production came up, and we faced a harsh reality: none of the designs we had were actually manufacturable because technical details were never considered.


Meanwhile, I had become the guy who solved all the company's ""urgent"" problems with simple Google searches. Need a sign? I'd find the best quote by the next day. Business cards printed? I was on it. I quickly became the company's ""internet god,"" to the point where I was even asked to recover the hacked Instagram account of his mom's friend.


Thanks to these ""successes,"" I got a good raise, an iPhone, and a company phone line. My boss had no problem spending money on overpriced and useless cloud storage systems sold by marketers instead of simple, effective solutions (like Google Drive).


Just as the t-shirt business was completely forgotten, a new idea dropped like a bombshell: NFTs!


My boss was obsessed. Suddenly, my new job was to learn about Blockchain, Metamask, Discord, and community management. When I said this was a separate specialty and we should hire someone, he shut it down, saying, ""I trust you, you can do it.""


He even offered to finance special software training for me, but then backed out when I found a cheaper alternative, saying ""the cheap one can't be good.""


In the end, I was uploading the designers' images to OpenSea and listing them at exorbitant prices set by my boss. We published the expensive promo video we spent months preparing on Twitter and, as you can probably guess, we made ZERO sales.


After the NFT fiasco, my boss came up with the idea of dropshipping on Amazon, saying, ""We need to make money, urgently."" Around this time, our salaries started to be delayed.


One morning, I came to the office to find three large boxes and a note on my desk. My boss had bought a ton of iPhone cases and wanted me to sell them on the local market.


I immediately took it seriously, did some market research, and learned the painful truth: my boss had been scammed by an acquaintance into buying cases for far above the market price—cases he could have gotten for cheap from a wholesaler.


Still, I didn't give up. I created social media accounts, took photos, set up sales channels, and after a week of intense effort, I even made the first sale. But because the product was bought at such a high price to begin with, making a profit was impossible.


Meanwhile, the office lunch menus were getting cheaper, but my boss was still buying expensive LEGO sets for himself and assembling them in the office.


When I realized how bizarre the whole situation was, that the company was unsalvageable, and that I was no longer learning anything from this meaningless experiment, I resigned.


My boss said, ""You're making a huge mistake, we built everything together, you need to be a part of this brand,"" but I didn't change my mind.


Just ONE DAY after I resigned, one of my colleagues called me: The company had shut down, and everyone was laid off.

A new hire (29F) joined recently, and we clicked quickly. We’d sit together in the cabin, grab coffee and lunch, and she often initiated dinner or movie plans.

One day, while playing Never Have I Ever in the cabin, she opened up about very personal stuff (including her past engagement/breakup). I also shared a bit. The very next morning, she messaged me saying she realized she had been oversharing and wanted to keep things “strictly professional” going forward.

From that day, she stopped inviting me for coffee/lunch or hanging out casually. I replied that I understood, but later in the evening I reassured her that I didn’t judge and that it’s normal for friends to share. She politely thanked me but repeated that she wanted to keep it “colleague mode.”

I followed up once more asking if I had done or said something to make her uncomfortable. That’s when her tone got much firmer — she said her boundaries may have been misinterpreted, she doesn’t want further discussion on the matter, and from now on all our interactions should remain strictly work-related.

Since then, she’s avoided personal interactions completely. She still talks to others normally, posts on Instagram but seems to skip my stories, and at work keeps everything very formal with me.

I’ll be honest: I developed feelings for her. I never confessed them, and I don’t think I crossed any obvious line, but her sudden pullback has hit me really hard. I haven’t been able to sleep well, I overthink constantly, and I feel like I was encouraged to bond one day only to be shut out the next.

Did I misstep here? Did she maybe sense my crush and that’s why she distanced herself? Or is this just about her regretting how much she overshared? How do I move forward working with her every day when I feel ignored and discarded?

TL;DR: New colleague (29F) got close to me (28M), opened up about very personal things, then suddenly decided to keep everything professional and cut off our casual friendship.

1n1bxni,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhiskyIndia/comments/1n1bxni/how_to_enjoy_drinking_whisky_neat/,How to enjoy drinking whisky neat,"I'll just start by saying that drinking whisky is a very personal thing, and you can drink however you want, but there is a much better way of 'enjoying' a good whiskey, rather than just drinking to feel the high.

I am also not a seasoned neat drinker, it's something I've recently started exploring, and it's not the only way I'll drink, but it's definitely a 'great addition' to your ways of drinking.

**IMPORTANT**

DON'T SELECT WHISKIES WITH GRAIN NEUTRAL SPIRIT, they aren't meant for sipping neat, and will taste terrible. Even with soda they taste bland, but drinking them neat is really a disaster.

The cheapest 'actual whisky' I've found in India is William Lawson's. Teacher's Highland Cream is the 2nd cheapest I could find.

Whiskies below this range are NOT REAL WHISKIES, but are 80-90% Vodka like drinks with 2-10% actual whisky.

So no Royal Challenge, Blender's Pride, Signature, Antiquity etc. qualify this. They can't be called 'Whisky' internationally.

Try Black & White, it's one of the best tasting affordable 'whisky'. Black Dog, 100 Pipers etc. are good choices too, and if you can find something like Glenfiddich, Glenlivet, then definitely drink them neat.

**1. Don't drink too cold/warm**

Ideal temperature for drinking whisky is 10–18°C. It's 'room temperature' in western countries, but in India, the room temperature can get too hot, so either put it in a fridge for sometime, or use ice cubes (preferably steel ones so you don't dilute the whisky, but regular ice is also fine). A whisky that's too cold won't let you explore its flavours, and if its too hot, it'll just taste too ethanol-y.

**2. Let it sit**

Before drinking, let the neat whisky sit for a few minutes in the glass. It'll evaporate some of the ethoanol vapours, and open up the whisky flavour. Not a crucial step, but definitely helps, and doesn't take long.

**3. Nose before you sip**

Stick your nose slightly above the rim of the glass, not deep inside it. Take short, gentle sniffs rather than one big inhale - otherwise, the alcohol will overpower everything. Try to pick up notes (fruit, spice, oak, smoke) without forcing it.

**4. Take SMALL sips**

This is the **most important** part. Take sips that are very small, like you're drinking hot tea/coffee. A 1-3ml would be a good start.

Let that sip sit in your mouth for a while, like 10-20 seconds. It'll mix with your saliva, and coat your tongue with rich creaminess (or other qualities), then swallow it.

The ideal time to drink 30ml whisky would be 20-30 minutes. I know this sounds too long, but if you really want to enjoy the taste and complexities, this is how long you'd take. Again, we're not drinking to get drunk, but enjoying the taste.

It'll take quite long to get tipsy with this method. You don't have to drink like this in your entire session; this is about appreciating the complexities and flavour.

Think of neat whiskey like meditation. After each sip, you can pause for 30 seconds to a minute. Let the finish (aftertaste) develop. Many good whiskeys will keep revealing flavors long after you’ve swallowed; peppery warmth, sweetness, smokiness. If you sip too quickly, you’ll miss it, and if the sip is too big, it'll overpower your palette with ethanol.

**5. (Optional) Add water**

Adding a 'splash' of water, like a few drops helps in opening up the flavour of the whisky. You can start without water, and then add it to feel the difference.

Sometimes I don't like diluting the whisky even a little, but sometimes, it definitely helps.

**6. (Optional) Select the right glass**

A Glencairn glass or a small tulip-shaped glass is ideal because it concentrates the aromas, it can be bought on Amazon for 300-400 Rs. for a 2 piece set.

Our nose plays a big part in our sense of taste, so the shape of this glass concentrating the smell may be beneficial to your overall experience.

You can also use a regular whisky glass.

**7. Don't feel bad about adding soda/water later**

Drinking neat is a great experience, but if you're with friends who're on their 4th drink, whlie you're still just kissing your first drink like Harvey Specter, you may feel out of sync, and you may still be on your 2nd drink when it's time to leave.

If you're alone, and want to just relax, you can continue drinking neat, but feel free to add soda if you want to drink more quickly. Don't finish your neat drink faster than it needs to, I personally think it's better to just dilute.

Good whiskies also taste much better than Royal Challenge etc. when mixed with some soda. Of course, adding cold drink or juices will eliminate the whisky flavour, but just drink however you like.

Feel free to add your experience to this thread, I may also make changes to this post based on suggestions/corrections or new things I may discover myself.

This is a new subreddit, so feel free to invite your whisky lover friends.

As always, drink responsibly. Cheers!",1,1756285339.0,WhiskyIndia,0,1.0,False

We'd been trying for around a year but in July I found out I had a very low sperm count but perfectly fine for ICSI.

My wife had her ultrasound scan last week 21 days into her cycle (she's like clockwork: 28 day cycle and always ovulates on day 13/14). The ultrasonist was extremely positive: no discernible problems. She counted 8 follicles (with one having clearly released an egg around 7 days before). She said it's a little on the low side but said she was only doing a brief scan and thinks she saw a few more follicles but wasn't looking in too much detail. She also said it's normal for the follicle count to be reduced when measured 21 days into a cycle. Overall the ultrasonist was very positive.

Yesterday we saw the specialist to discuss the scan and the bloods. She was extremely pessimistic and said that 8 follicles is extremely low and my wife has a low AMH level 0.7 and that we'd be unlikely to get more than 2 eggs per ER with even 2 eggs being a best-case scenario. Needless to say my wife was absolutely devastated.

Looking at the responses here, I was a little surprized since 8 AFCs isn't an obscenely low number and suspect that the specialist was just covering herself and managing expectations. She seemed to focus on AMH only and criticized my coffee consumption at 2-3 cups per day).

 We're going to start ER during her next cycle anyway but my wife is already talking about the futility of it all. Has anyone else been in this situation and have you had second opinions?

Be honest—did you ever think we'd live to see the day where a robot would outshine your favorite lab-coated genius? Well, brace yourself because artificial intelligence isn't just playing sidekick anymore; it's stepping up as the main act in the world of drug discoveries. That's right, while most of us were stuck in a feedback loop of stale coffee and failed datasets, AI was quietly learning how to revolutionize pharmaceuticals.

For those who snoozed through science class, developing new medicine is traditionally like watching paint dry—except it takes anywhere from 10 to 15 years (yawn, right?). But thanks to companies like Dotmatics, powered by AI, that's about to change faster than you can say ""Eureka!""

**The Bold New World of AI-Powered Drug Discovery**

1. **Speedy Research Partner**: Gone are the days when AI was just the digital equivalent of a lab intern fetching data. According to Phil Mounteney, Vice President of Science and Technology at Dotmatics, AI is evolving from helpful assistant to full-fledged research partner. Picture Watson from ""Sherlock,"" but instead of solving murders, it's uncovering medical marvels.

2. **Time Saver**: AI is set to cut those dreary 15-year timelines down to something much more snackable by allowing predictive modeling of future medicines. What was once a molasses-paced meticulous process could soon be reduced to a brisk afternoon of calculations.

3. **Cost Cutter**: It's not just time that AI is trimming—think of the savings! Fewer years of testing and tweaking means less money siphoned from research budgets. Imagine funneling those savings into more groundbreaking treatments or that prime lab coffee maker you've been eyeing.

**The Human Touch in a Tech-Driven World**

But before you go lamenting the fact that your job may soon be taken by a cyborg capable of concocting tomorrow's insulin, take a breath. AI’s rise doesn't necessarily mean humans will become relics. Rather, it's an invitation to amplify human ingenuity. We’re talking about turning painstaking lab work into hyper-creative brainstorming sessions, working alongside our digital counterparts.

So, what do you think this means for the future of medical research? Are we on the brink of a new golden age, or could this lead to greater ethical dilemmas? 🤔 Do you trust AI to handle the keys to our pharmaceutical future?

We ended up getting lunch out and amidst a long drive stoping to get drinks. I drank a coffee, two iced teas, and an energy drink throughout the day before we arrived at a rocky beach. While the beach was fun, the combination of constant noise from my family and also getting injured at the beach ended up really stressing me out. So after the beach right before we start to drive back people got some drinks from the cooler. Of course, I had one more energy drink.  

I don’t know how stress+caffeine caused this but when I say that this was unlike anything I’ve ever experienced in my life, I MEAN IT. When I got in that car I must’ve looked crazy because for the entire 90min drive I was gripping the car door handle staring out the window while my body was completely unmoving. I genuinely did not feel like I was in the car, and any noise I heard or thing I saw that was in the car I completely tuned out as if it weren’t real. I started listening to music full blast on headphones and somehow tuned that out as well, and was only focused on the trees outside my window. 

I started imagining multiple elaborate scenarios in my head going on at once and thinking about the meaning of things and death and then other people’s perspectives of life and then things that happened when I was younger and on and on and ON, just a constant stream of thoughts that ultimately led to me playing out alternate life’s of mine in the future. One where I became a famous musician who killed my self at a young age and left a suicide note about his view of life, and then a 200 iq genius who talked on an interview of his view on life, and etc. at this point so many thoughts were going through my head I had a headache, but was so laser focused on these thoughts I was having that I just couldn’t stop. This kept going until we got to the hotel. 

I expected to be pulled back into reality because I had to interact with people and stuff, but it didn’t and I talked really slowly and wasn’t very aware of my volume. Took a shower and couldn’t stop the endless flow of thoughts, I went on a walk and it wouldn’t stop. I ended up eating some food and going on another walk down by the beach and If I tried to explain the things I saw in my head this would take forever and also make no sense, just know it went to thoughts about ego and consciousness and stuff, and these thoughts were both amazing and terrifying. 

It started to get dark and I was still on the beach, plus it was extremely foggy so I started to head back. As I was it was getting darker and for some reason I became incredibly paranoid something was going to come out of the bushes and kill me. I started to slowly speed up until I was full on running back. And then finally when I got back to the hotel it started to go away but even now I don’t feel completely back in reality. If anyone can answer or at least try to as to wtf happened and why caffeine triggered all this, then I would really like to know, thanks.",1,1756284560.0,Dissociation,1,1.0,False

She asked me if I'm sure I'm willing to answer.  I said yes I'm. 
She gave me eye shadow like powder. A silver and a red one. She said I need to make a line on my arm for every right and wrong answer. 

She asked me what would I do if there where a new pair of shoes in my bedroom:
A: would you take them and start wearing them
B: would you asked the boyfriend (her boss) why the shoes are there and wait to take them till he tells me to do so. 

I chose answer B. And said that I feel always awkward when people imply I can take something without explicitly saying to do so (that is true in real life for me) 

She turned into a guy but that was nothing that concernd me and he said I amswerd right and that I habe to draw the line. 
I asked if my answer was right or wrong and I was told I have the right answer and to use the silver eyeshadow to draw the line on my arm. 


I had a bad feelings  I asked if we wanna stop for coffee or bubble tea and he said yes.  

There where to guys sitting at a table who i felt where save (I didn't know them) but I talked with them for as the guy went up to order. I told them im in danger and they believed me. 

Then the driver guy called me to order my coffee. He order a hot latte and I said I want a iced latte. The lady didn't hear me so I said loud : the same as he has just in cold - like my dead cold heart!

After I said that I got scared again turned to the driver guy and asked if his boss wants to kill me. And he said eventually he will try. I asked him to let me go and he said he could do that or he would be in danger himself.  

The guys from the table planed to film how we go back in the car to have evidence. Calling 911 wasn't successful.  No one answered.

1n1blz0,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1n1blz0/jurapocalypse_precious_part_5/,Jurapocalypse: Precious (Part 5),"Precious has been fascinated with dinosaurs ever since she was a little girl, with her dad, Dennis used to be the leading paleontologist of his era. It was July 18, 2001, On one of her dad’s expeditions in Australia, her dad brought her. At first it was an adventure digging up bones of Protoceratops and some Velociraptors! The positioning of the bones suggested that the Protoceratops, which were the herbivores of their era, were fighting the pack of Velociraptors.

Dennis: Look at this baby girl, if you could tell me what kind of dinos these are, I will treat you to an ice cream!

Precious: ummm ummm pro..proceratops! Aaand aaaand ummm velosapteeers!

Dennis: Ooooh close! That was a good guess baby girl, this here is the Velociraptors they are the mean one that eats other dinosaurs and here the with a big head is a Protoceratops! 

Precious: But I said that! \*making a puppy eyes to her dad\* Ice cream?

Dennis: Well baby girl since it’s just a partial point I get to choose what flavor we eat okay?

Precious: ICE CREAAAAAM!

Dennis: hehehe now go to our tent and get us some spoons, I’m sure we packed some ice cream for this kind of expedition.

While precious was getting the spoons in the tent Dennis, her dad noticed something in the bones of the Velociraptors.

Dennis: This can’t be, I mean this is amazing but this is crazy! Opposable thumbs! Opposable thu…..

But even before she got back to her dad from her spoon mission, he was gone and only left his digging tools in the excavation area.

Precious: Daaad? Daaad?

Precious looked around to where his dad would be hiding since it was one of her dad’s antics and harmless pranks to her daughter when playing with her, but she didn’t find her dad. What she saw shocked her. It was a live Velociraptors! It snarled at Precious, understandably Precious was scared with every cell in her body, the velociraptors creeping closer to Precious as if the dinosaur is examining her. The dinosaur saw the spoon in her hands then left for a while. When it comes back after a couple of minutes the Velociraptor was giving Precious a pint of ice cream. Precious who was crying her eyes out sobered a bit then looked at the dinosaur.

Precious: My daddy said you are bad dinos velosapters! 

As Precious stands her ground in the background you can see that the whole team of Dennis was being attacked by packs of Velociraptors. But Precious was too focused on the dinosaur in front of her to notice it. The Velociraptor came closer to Precious and stared at her and then opened the pint of ice cream for Precious before leaving. Precious was the only person left in that expedition and since then she promised to herself and to her missing dad that she will know more about those Velociraptors and their origins.

Fast forward to the present Precious was studying the bones of the Spinosaurus with Jigs and Brian.

Brian: Hey Precious, I’ve been meaning to ask you.

Precious: \*clearly blushing\* What is it Brian?

Brian: How did you really know these bites were from a juvenile dinosaur? I mean I understand from the recording with your explanation of the teeth and all..

Precious: The recording?

Brian: Oh yeah, Jigs and I have been friends since we were young and he did me a solid to record the briefing for me and I can’t help but to admire your knowledge with dinosaurs.

Precious: \*blushes red\* ooh well hehe I just really like dinosaurs and all you know.. I mean why are you even recording the meeting Jigs! What if you got caught?!

Jigs: Then I got caught.

Brian and Jigs proceed to do the longest most annoying hand shake in front of Precious. And when they were done Brian suddenly shouted.

Brian: Boom Shakala! Boom Boom Babyyy Mehehehehe

Precious: \*having a second hand embarrassment\* Just stay safe you guys it’s not that we’re all scientists here. I mean I still don’t even know why the military suddenly became involved with our research.

Jigs: About that…

Before even Jigs started saying anything, General Mcreden suddenly came into the lab with them.

Gen. Mcreden: Am I interrupting something here?

Jigs: No sir, we’re just doing our usual sample gathering here.

Gen. Mcreden: Anything unusual about this hunk of meat Jigs?

Jigs: Other than being bitten by another dinosaur to death, there’s nothing els…

General Mcreden suddenly slammed Jigs head to the table where the Spinosaurus was placed.

Gen. Mcreden: You nerds really thought I was that dumb eh? So answer me this then? Is this dinosaur here just only bitten or is there something more to it? 

Brian: Calm down Sir there were really just bite marks on the Spinosaurus sir! If we find anything else in the body we will tell you immediately, right Precious?

Precious: I agree to Brian so please let go of Jigs he didn’t do anything wrong.

General Mcreden twisted Jigs left arm and you can clearly see Jigs in pain.

General Mcreden: So tell me why there are some cuts in the flesh of this lizard that look like a knife or blade to me huh?

Brian: It was me.

General Mcreden: What?

Brian: It was me sir! Last night I was trying to do some overtime to learn more about the Spinosaurus. I was trying to be subtle about my self study about the specimen so I only turn of a couple of lights just enough to see the samples that I got, and then suddenly while I was transferring the scalpel on the other side of the room, I didn’t see there was some blood on the floor and I slipped! I accidentally cut some parts of the Spinosaurus before falling down on my back! So please sir let Jigs go!

General Mcreden: …. \*stares at Brian\* Well isn’t that so hard! \*let’s go of Jigs\* I never thought honesty would be coming from you Brian makes me feel that I should regret pulling you out of the briefing now hehehe as for you Jigs I know about the recording if you ever pulled a stunt like that again that could ruin the operation! You will answer to me , you got that?!

Jigs: yea, yeaaa..

General Mcreden: Come again?!

Jigs: Yes sir!

General Mcreden: Good, I’ll leave you nerds for now and keep up the good work everyone. We all need you to make this expedition a success! HAHAHA

General Mcreden left the room leaving a silence to the trio.

Jigs: Thanks Brian.. \*gasping for breath and rubbing his head\*

Brian: Anytime brother, we gotta do something about this Precious.

Precious: But what exactly can we do?

Brian: To be honest, I really don’t know, let's just continue our research here.

After hours of working on the samples Jigs asked Brian and Precious to grab a coffee with him.

Jigs: There’s something I’ve been meaning to say and I’m sure Brian is aware of this too.

Precious and Brian: What is it Jigs/Man?

Jigs: In the findings from the samples that we got from the claws of the Spinosaurus, Brian and I found out that there some sort of human tool used to attack the fallen Spinosaurus, We both convinced the whole science team not to mention this to the General for the reason that he will only make this into some sort of glorious war against the dinosaur or whatever is down there. If there’s a sentient life form down there other than dinosaurs, Isn’t it more beneficial to humanity that we understand them and learn their ways than fighting them head on? I don’t really see the benefit to that.

Brian: We’re sorry we didn’t put you in a loop right away Precious but seeing on how you stand against the General with his slurs to the dinosaur, I’d convince Jigs that you were trustworthy enough to know about this.

Precious: To know about what?

Brian: Would you like me to tell her Jigs?

Jigs: We found in the claws of the Spinosaurus that there is some humanoid or at least close to homosapien kind of species that lives below those depths and we are worried that we would be an intruder to their home if we made the station there uninvited. We’re planning to make contact with whoever or whatever is living in that cave, but the thing is, we are not sure if they would listen to reason and I’m sure hell they won’t be speaking English or Tagalog. So that’s the challenge as of now..

Brian: I have an idea on how we would introduce ourselves to them without using any language Jigs.

Jigs: Don’t tell me…

Brian: Yes, when vikings arrived in America the indigenous people didn't quite warmly welcome them. What they did was they left all of the things that would describe a “viking” to the indigenous people and placed them in an orderly fashion. Anything from combs, dresses and even their boat and wood crafts. Anything that is non hostile to anyone that would see it the first time.

Jigs: Do you think it would work on them too?

Brian: Well, we don’t even know what’s “them” anyway. If they are dino-human or whatever they are I hope we can communicate with them in any way because I want to know the mystery of that cave and the wooden submarine.

Randomly found this app called Finito Medicine. Didn’t expect much tbh, but I used it to summarize my notes and it was kinda a game changer. Having everything shorter + easier to read made cramming way less painful. Also there’s a quiz thing in it that I used when I was too tired to properly study, and weirdly it kept me motivated.

(Effects in description),"You walk into the local pawn shop, just to browse, as you've done a hundred times before. As you're walking around the store, you notice something different. A small table in the back corner, with 5 items, placed randomly on it. A small paper sign on the table says ""pick one"" in black marker. As you look at the items more closely, you somehow know what they do, and you can tell there's something powerful about them. Looking over them more closely, you see:


A golden ring with the metal twisted into a braid pattern. If you put this ring on, you will have the ability to summon any amount of money to your hand that you need for any situation. It will be in whatever form and currency type you need, and will not have any inflationary effect, and the government also won't come after you for this. Buying a 5 dollar coffee? A 5 dollar bill appears in your hand. Buying something expensive? A card will appear in your hand with the exact amount you need. The ring cannot be stolen, lost, or used by others.


A vial of blue, faintly glowing liquid. You can tell that, if you drink this, you will become much stronger, both physically and mentally. First, you will be transformed into the bodytype that you desire. You'll also be at the pinnacle of human strength, speed, endurance, etc. even if your desired body doesn't look like it. You will not need to work to maintain this body. You will never get sick, and any illnesses you currently have will be permanently cured. This also includes any mental illnesses, so no depression, anxiety, etc. Though this also doesn't take away from any natural emotional depth. The government will also not experiment on you and nobody will question these changes. You'll still need sleep, to use the restroom, etc. and will not become at the peak of human intellect 

A device with a small touchscreen, and one button labeled ""Save"" and another labeled ""Load"" this is a device that has 3 empty Save files. When you press ""Save"" the current moment in time will be saved to the device, and you can press the ""Load"" button, and doing so will transport you back (or forwards) to the exact moment you pressed save. You can save 3 different moments, and can always load to them, unless you save over them with a new moment. If you override a moment, you can't get it back. This also can't be stolen from you, used by others or lost

A silver box chain necklace, with a subtle iridescent sheen across it. If you put this on, you gain a variety of psychic powers. Telekinesis, telepathic communication, mind reading, as well as psychic suggestion (the ability to subtly influence a person's ideas as well as implant thoughts into their head. Not full on mind control.) People will not know if you use your powers on them, or in general, unless it's clear based of what they can see and hear. As long as you're not being malicious, you won't be investigated or get in trouble for using your powers. The necklace can't be stolen, lost, or used by others. 

And finally, a small coin made of gray, cracked stone. On the heads side is a shooting star, and on tails, an hourglass. As you look at it, you feel the hairs on the back of your neck raise. If you flip this coin and land heads, you get to make a wish. However, if you land tails twice in a row, you are frozen in time for a week, but still fully conscious. Each time this triggers, the duration of the next time you're frozen in time is double the previous time. There is nothing you can do to mitigate or remove this downside. You can't rig the coin in any way, or change the amount of time in any way with wishes. You can also not change your perception of time or erase time or anything of the like to avoid it. There is no possible way to avoid the downside. Along with those rules, you also cannot wish for more wishes in any way. You can only generate wishes through the coin, and can't increase the amount you get in any way. You also cannot wish you any of the other magic items, or their effects. This item can't be lost, destroyed or used on others, but people will question the effects of wishes unless you wish for them not to. 

So, after weighing your options, what will you pick?

Here's a little tipoff for your morning coffee:

There's this group out there called the Dark Clown Papparrazi. Notice the plural in the word papparrazi.
You'll also hear them called the Insane Clown Papparrazi, not to confuse them with the awesome horror core band of a similar name.

You won't hear about them often but they do some pretty crazy things to try to get the insider scoop on your life for blackmail and extortion. So they work like a scam group but they act like the papparrazzi just for normal citizens.

This Dark Clown group can be pretty scary to deal with but they don't like social media exposure. It seems to be the most effective tactic for dealing with them. They can't stand how they act being brought to light.

Keep that in mind out there because they can be pretty dark in their methods at first. For more information look up papparrazi on social media and it will go into a similar example as to how they work.

I want to end politely a relationship with one of my classmates. I'm 22F and he is 22M. Our relationship is not so old, as it hasn't even started yet. 

I met this guy (22M) at University. He's one of my classmates. At my school (Forestry), except from the usual lessons, we have also some field practice where we live for 1 month at the mountains. The university provides accommodation. At the second one of these practices the two of us started talking and hanging out more. 

We came back for our 4th year of studies and at the end of the summer semester he asked me to go out with him for a coffee. I was very surprised and I said no. At the next semester he asked again and I said ""yes, why not?"". After all we enjoyed talking together. So, I went and we had a good time. Some months later we went again for a walk and a coffee (forgot to mention he paid for everything). 

At this second time I decided that I don't  care so much about him. I like him just as a friend, nothing more. Also, at this time of my life I don't want any relationships. Maybe I don't want any relationship at all. I'm still 22, I have a  lot of time ahead 😅. 

So, he asked me again today with a message. He's in the army now (for 6 months) and he said he missed me and he'd like to see me when he's at leave some time. We'll, I don't care anymore. And I don't know how to tell him without hurting maybe his feelings. I'm used to say everything exactly the way I feel it. I'd like to be honest for something like this. How do I do this? Have you dealt with something similar? It's my first time...

TL;DR I (22F) don't want to start a relationship with him (22M) right now. I'd prefer to tell the truth to him and actually end this from the start.

book in hand, lost in the lines.

They wore green.
They came and sat next to me at the coffee table.

All it took was one conversation, 
I didn’t know it then, but I was already a goner.

For the first time in my life,
my ever-running mind became still, 
still as the waters in long-forgotten caves and fields.

They spoke with so much wisdom and light
I couldn’t believe they were real.
Maybe I had stepped into the book I was reading,
or maybe someone else was reading me.

All it took was one conversation
and my walls began to fall,
dropping faster than a crashing plane.
Walls I had stacked so high they kept me sane.

They erased and rewrote me,
made me question every single thing I thought I knew.

Have you ever felt rebirth without understanding it?

They wore green, with a smile so radiant
that light reflected upon their face.
Their voice,  soft, smooth, and raspy, 
reached all the way to my toes.

We could have been there for seconds or centuries;
I have no idea.

All it took was one conversation
and I could feel the tears,
tears that had pooled in my sockets for years,
held back in the belief that hiding my fears
was the only way to be strong.

All it took was one conversation
and I broke down.

I cried as they held me,
and I could smell the forest,
the sun shimmering between the leaves,
the gentle breeze swaying them into song.

I could feel it all, vividly,
from them, the one who wore green.

And for the first time,
I loved and I lived.

All it took was one conversation,
and I was home.

Like, we get the usual watches, designer handbags, or even those ridiculously over-the-top coffee makers — but what about when the idea of a **gift card itself** stops being just a plastic rectangle and actually becomes… AI-powered?  

I know it sounds kind of out there, but hear me out. Imagine an “AI gift card” that’s not just loaded with currency, but personalized intelligence. Instead of giving someone $200 at a store, you’re giving them credit that comes with built-in recommendations, suggestions, personalized pairings, and maybe even a digital concierge that makes sure the whole gift experience feels tailored for *that person specifically.*  

Now picture this for luxury gifting…  

- Instead of buying a generic gift card, the AI could **learn their taste** in accessories, clothes, literature, or experiences.  
- It could **anticipate** life moments—birthdays, anniversaries, promotions—so the card actually feels alive, not static.  
- It might even **unlock curated digital worlds**, like immersive book collections from places such as [https://goodnovel.org/](https://goodnovel.org/) that evolve based on the recipient’s reading style.  

And okay, here’s where my head is spinning: does this mean the *experience* becomes the ultimate gift rather than the object? Because, truthfully, an AI-enabled card could make the boundary between gifting and lifestyle-blending super thin.  

Think about it. Someone taps in their card and instead of random product lists, an evolving gallery of **things they didn’t even know they wanted** suddenly appears. That kind of intelligence feels more luxurious than just “here’s money on a card.”  

Short sentence time: This feels electrifying.  

But… this is where I get totally tangled up. Would people really accept it? Wouldn’t it be *too intrusive* if your gift card knows you almost better than you know yourself? And at what point does the line get crossed between a thoughtful gift and an AI playing gatekeeper to your choices?  

Changing luxury gifting in this way could:  

- Make every gift feel one-of-a-kind and impossible to replicate.  
- Blur traditional value, because is the money itself the gift, or the curation?  
- Push us toward a place where brands aren’t just competing on price or prestige, but on how well their AI “knows” their customers.  

I keep circling back to the same question: is luxury about the rarity of the thing, or the intimacy of the feeling? An AI gift card seems to redefine this by holding both in its virtual hands.  

Also, let’s not ignore the idea that platforms like [https://goodnovel.org/](https://goodnovel.org/) could end up setting the tone. Not just recommending books but cultivating entire reading journeys, transforming the act of gifting into something personal, intelligent, and delightfully unpredictable.  

One sentence, because it needs to land: The AI gift card could be the new black card.  

So, I’m stuck between excitement at how futuristic and mind-blowing this is…and confusion about whether it would actually feel magical, or just a next-level marketing ploy dressed up as luxury.  

Would you buy it? Would you trust it? Would gifting ever be the same again?  

What if luxury, at its core, is no longer just material but the seamless union of human emotion + machine precision?  

Because suddenly, that sounds like a gift worth more than gold.",1,1756283336.0,LuxuryGiftsf,0,1.0,False

You know that feeling when you pick up a book, and it just *clicks*? Like finding a comfy chair or a perfect cup of coffee? That's exactly how I felt diving into [The Brutal Telling - Louise Penny](https://pdfhive.com/the-brutal-telling-louise-penny/). This one is the fifth in her Chief Inspector Gamache series, but don't worry if you haven't read the others – it stands on its own beautifully. It's set in the charming, tiny Quebec village of Three Pines, where life is usually peaceful, full of eccentric characters and good food. But then, a murder shatters that peace, and Chief Inspector Gamache is called in to unravel a complex web of secrets and lies, revealing the darker side hidden beneath the idyllic surface.

What really grabbed me from the start was Penny's ability to paint such vivid pictures with her words. The village of Three Pines feels so real, almost like you could walk into one of its cozy homes or sit by the fire at the bistro. And the characters? Oh, the characters! Gamache himself is a wonderfully thoughtful and compassionate detective, which is a breath of fresh air. He’s not your typical gruff, troubled hero; he's wise, empathetic, and truly cares about justice and understanding people. The villagers are a quirky bunch, each with their own quirks and pasts, making every interaction interesting and often quite funny.

The writing style is just gorgeous – it's sophisticated but never feels overly academic. Penny has a knack for making you pause and think about deeper things, not just ""who did it."" The pacing is steady, like a slow-burning fire, gradually building suspense as more layers of the mystery are peeled back. It’s not a fast-paced thriller, but it pulls you in with its psychological depth. You're not just solving a murder; you're exploring the human heart, the nature of good and evil, and how past actions ripple through lives. The emotions felt genuine, and I found myself really caring about what happened to these people. If you’re looking for a book that offers more than just a quick plot, something to truly immerse yourself in, you can find more about it here: [The Brutal Telling - Louise Penny](https://pdfhive.com/the-brutal-telling-louise-penny/).

Now, was there anything I didn't absolutely love? Well, sometimes, the sheer amount of detail in the descriptions or the philosophical musings could make the narrative feel a *tiny* bit slower. For readers who prefer their mysteries to race along with constant action, this might take some getting used to. However, for me, it just added to the richness and depth, making the moments of revelation even more impactful. It's a small trade-off for such a beautifully crafted story and compelling characters.

**Would I recommend it? Absolutely, yes!** This book is perfect for anyone who loves character-driven mysteries, psychological fiction, or just a really good story that makes you think. If you enjoy authors like P.D. James or Tana French, or if you're just looking for a cozy, atmospheric read with a sharp edge, this is definitely for you. It’s not just a whodunit; it’s an exploration of human nature.

### A Little Nudge for New Readers: Don't Be Shy!

Reading can sometimes feel like a big commitment, especially when you're just starting out or trying a new genre. Here are a few simple tips from my own reading journey to help you ease into it:

1.  **Start with what excites you.** Don't feel pressured to read ""classics"" if they don't appeal. Love movies about spies? Try a spy novel! Can't get enough of true crime podcasts? Dive into a thriller. Pick a book that genuinely sounds interesting.
2.  **It's okay to put a book down.** If you're 50 pages in and it's just not grabbing you, don't force it. There are *millions* of books out there. Life's too short to read something you're not enjoying. Move on, and find one that truly captures your imagination.
3.  **Find your reading sweet spot.** Some people love reading on their commute; others prefer a quiet evening at home with a cup of tea. Experiment to find when and where you enjoy reading the most. Even 15-20 minutes a day adds up!
4.  **Don't worry about speed.** Reading isn't a race. Take your time, enjoy the words, and let the story unfold at its own pace. It's about the journey, not how quickly you reach ""The End.""

Remember, every experienced reader started somewhere. The most important thing is to enjoy the adventure. If you're ready to start your next adventure with a truly engaging mystery, check out [The Brutal Telling - Louise Penny](https://pdfhive.com/the-brutal-telling-louise-penny/)!

It's funny how these small moemnts of kindness from strangers can light up our day. Tuurns out, there's some psychology behind this. When someone gives us an unexpected compliment, it hits different because our brains don't set up defenses against it. It’s a surprise that stwnds out, breaking the monotony of our usual routine and afecting how we peceive ourselves positively. Also, when we feel appreicated, our brain releases serotonin and dopamine, feel-good chemicals that increase happiness and overall mood.

1n1b8zr,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1n1b8zr/i_taught_my_buddy_new_tricks_part_1/,I Taught my Buddy New Tricks (Part 1),"Buddy is a 221 pound, 6 year old English Mastiff who saved me from another year in rehab. Sobering up requires you to not only get out of the hole you placed yourself in, but to also fill that hole with something else. More liquor? Been there, done that. How about drugs? Too hardcore. Sex and rock and roll? Not charming enough. No I needed something else, I wasn't an artist, nor creative and I hadn't written anything in ages. Next stop was back to the bottle, until Buddy came into my life. 

I got him when he was just a pup. Sorry, I should say that he came to me when he was a pup. Just like something out of a fairytale. Like an angel falling from the heavens. A baby with its stork. I had finished the last drop of Absolut in my apartment on the 3rd floor, and then there was the knock. Stumbling from my couch (which I had been planted in for most of the morning) I opened the door to see a small dog sitting patiently on my door step. The carpet enveloping the dog was a cheesy yellow stained by unknown substances. Likely spills from my late nights.

“Where did you come from boy?” I rubbed his long flappy ears clumsily, they felt so delicate and soft on my fingers, like satin. Craning my neck around his drooped chocolate eyes, I came to the conclusion that it must have been a stray. No tag, no collar, nothing. So when I brought the dog inside, I made the place his home. Instantly, it curled up right next to me on the couch, contorting the couch to an odd angle.

“Hey you're a smart one aren't you?” I whispered to him.

The front door swung open presenting my roommate. He was a scrawny lad only a few years younger than me. He had that classic roommate look on his face, you know the one. The one of disgust mixed with prolonged disappointment. He swung his jaw about at the state of the place.

“Dude this place is a pig sty, I'm gone for a few days and-” he paused, taking in the mound of fur that poked his head out over my lap. ""Is that a dog?”

“Yeah he's so friendly right? I think I'll keep him.”

“You sure as shit aint it's my house too! Clean yourself up man, I'm not living in a flat with a drunk and a dog the size of a bear!”

I was still pretty wasted at this point so I can't recall the incessant arguing that followed but I can certainly remember the end. At the peak of the bickering came a low howl. A melodic unwavering tone emanated from the dog, immediately halting us in our argument.

After that he stayed. A member of the family. He was our Buddy.

When I say our Buddy, I mean my Buddy not his. He never took care of him, it was all me and I loved him so much. I took him everywhere, however it was difficult to hide that large frame from my landlord, thank God he was deaf which made things easier. Buddy was so smart, I could teach him all kinds of tricks. He could play dead, roll over, he could even speak. I don't mean that he could just bark on command. *He could actually talk.* I'd understand if you don't believe me but it's true. You can teach dogs anything with enough time on your hands and the right methods. So I'd take time off my shitty office job to the point of unemployment to reach my goal, to get him to talk. Here's what I did, I placed his mat under the fridge and opened the door. Not only does this cool the brain down (this helps with cognitive functions for males) but it also provides a warm light (which promotes focus). I know it sounds silly but I provided Buddy with a small speaker which played small melancholic tunes mixed with the audiobook for the Oxford English dictionary.

Every night for 3 years I would continue to repeat this process, I could pay for the extra electric costs and to hell with what my roommate thought, I told him my therapist said it helps me ‘relax past traumas and help recover addictions and all that to try and get him off my ass. All bullshit. Then, on the 16th of August 2003 it finally paid off. Buddy spoke.

It was late at night, the steel blue glow of the tv played some fishing show, while Buddy was deep in his corner in the kitchen. My head was rolled to the side, an empty shot glass was sliding back and forth between my pinky finger and thumb. I was at my lowest point, the bottom of the barrel. Years of my life wasted over some stupid hypothesis. I was about to pour another glass when I swear I could've heard something emanating from the kitchen. *What was that? I heard something, what was it?* Coming out of fatigue on the couch, I heard from the corner of the kitchen the sound of a whine, a howl and a groan. It went something like “Reeehn ooohhh Rooooayyyy.” I immediately pulled the tv cord out from the wall causing the marlin on screen to snap to black and I slid over the tiled floor on my hands and knees, keeping that deafening silence. I was begging him to speak, anything at all. I was in a river of silence, drowning indefinitely, drowning forever until my lungs ruptured and my eyes bulged. I was red in the face. Anything please God anything.

There it was again!

It was deeper, softer this time with every syllable becoming more articulate. I turned, grabbing my notepad on top of the counter and returned to see the giant dog sitting upright, staring with its dark chocolate eyes, mouth agape. Silence…

*‘Kiiiiirrrlll Yore Rooomayye,”* said Buddy, in a low guttural groan. It sounded like an old door slowly opening. Or the rocking of a piece of furniture under strain. Groaning.

I was shocked, now I craved the silence. I didn't want to hear anymore. Something about that tone. He didn't just say that, did he? No it isn't true he didn't say what I think he said he said “Krill is Yummy,” no thats silly he said “Fill your tummy,” some gibberish it had to be. *Stupid stupid dont be stupid you know what he just said.* I was an inch away from him now. His hot breath seeped into my pores sticking to my skin, dribbles of drool swung as he slowly breathed in and out, in and out. He wasn't panting anymore, he was breathing with conformity, and he stared deep into my eyes, His eyes narrowing, his head turned down slightly and we were both eye level now with his teeth. His fangs, sharp and huge. I saw something in his eyes, those eyes weren't chocolate coloured anymore, no they were that of coal, a deep void, dark and endless, derived from something that wasn't to be seen on earth. I needed to get away right then and there. I began to slowly crawl backwards when Buddy spoke those words I dreaded to hear.

*“Kill Your Roommate.""*

Finally my work paid off, there was an ingredient that I have been missing to this whole experiment. Liquor. That night was my relapse night, I sure as shit wasn't proud of it but results are results. Obviously he lacked the articulation to pronounce anything more noteworthy than a bark that's impossible. No he wasn't the one who changed I was, I could truly hear him now, I could be his messenger. I've finally found my purpose.

Following Buddy's words he immediately fell back into a brutish form of speech, completely unintelligible. Barks and whimpers and howls returned once more. So as the scientist I thought I was, I quickly came to the conclusion that I needed more liquor as that was the one changing variable in all of this. Besides, after what I heard I clearly needed it. Stumbling back to the couch I picked up my near empty bottle of Jack and finished the whole thing. I wasn't relapsing no, this was a mere experiment. I'm just visiting this time I promise. Before long, I was back into a state of bliss. Crawling back next to Buddy I scrambled to pick up the fallen notebook and attempted to write down the dog’s messages.

“I am a being beyond your understanding, I speak in tongues you cannot perceive. In the heavens and below, I am the snake. The harbinger of the end.”

Buddy then stooped his head down and licked the palm of my open hand.

“Upon this rock will I build my church. If you carry this burden I will make you a king of kings. Gold, Frankincense and myrrh will flow from your hands like waterfalls and you will be that of lordship over your gaze. All that I ask of you is to bow, for me to be your master and when dust settles, you will be a great favourite among my lands.""

The liquor made me laugh, it is very hard to take a talking dog seriously with so much in your system. I slumped back into the cabinet adjacent to me, trying to keep my gaze on the mass of fur. A long while flew past as I just stared at the mass, lolling my head side to side, trying not to throw up.

“You're uhhhh,” I chuckled, ""you're a very very bad dog aren't you.”

Buddy raised himself, standing on all fours now. I remember his paws so vividly, they looked as if you curled your fist into a ball and placed it flat onto the floor.

“During the miracle of the swine, did those demons become pigs? Or did they remain demons?”

“Buddy you're a dog. I mean like you have paws and stuff. You're not a pig!”

Interrupting our pleasant drunken conversation came my roommate. Poking his head around the corner, giving that same stupid look.

“For the love of God please shut that dog up, it's 3 in the morning and I have work.” He peered down at the empty bottle of Jack beside me. “Dude you relapsed?! My God you are a mess, clean yourself up and I swear,” I hated when he pointed that finger at me, “If you have another drop of anything but water I will tell Gary about you and your mutt, I'm serious this time I will NOT stand for this shit anymore!” Buddy was back to his resting position, staring straight at me, not even noticing my roommate's outburst.

I began to chuckle once more, I couldn't help myself. “What kind of name is Gary? Who even is Gary?”

“He's our landlord my lord- okay im going to bed just please keep it down, we're gonna have to sort this shit out in the morning.” With that he left the kitchen, leaving me with the dog.

“You need to kill him, kill your roommate.""

“Yea yea you've said, I wouldn't be too opposed to it I mean the guys a dick.” I joked. Getting up from the floor, I hobbled back to the tv. Plugging the wire back into its socket I got back to my fishing show. I know it sounds silly but drunk me needed that breather. Not only am I being told what to do by my roommate but I'm also being told what to do by my dog. By Buddy, by whatever is in my kitchen staring at me. 

“Kill him, do it, kill your roommate.” Buddy still didn't move from his post, he stayed watch over me as I tried to ignore him. “Kill your roommate. You must kill your roommate.” This went on for about an hour as I tried to unwind, trying to ignore him. After hearing ‘kill your roommate’ for the 52nd time, I was fed up, turning the tv off (with the remote this time) I turned to Buddy.

“Why won't you just shut up? I'll send you to the pound, don't make me do that.”

“Kill your roommate.”

“On a serious point I can't do it Buddy, why do you want him dead anyway?” 

“Kill your roommate, it will be the key to unlocking your true desires. Upoooonnnn thiiiss roooaahh ROUGH ROUGH ROUGH!”

I groaned. *God I'm sober now*, and with no money to buy another drop, I'm stuck with a howling mutt. I can't believe it, I actually have to go get some cash to pay for more liquor. I sure as shit can't take another loan from my roommate. What would I tell him? *Sorry roomie, I'll pay you back, I know I already owe you for last month's rent. I just need to talk to my dog real quick about killing you.* Work it is then, ill find a job and ill get to continue my talks with Buddy. I heard the lights flick on in my roommates room. A muffled voice shot to the kitchen.

“Will you shut that damn dog up!”

It's hard to go through withdrawal symptoms, it's even harder finding a job under withdrawal symptoms. Not only is the job market buggered right now, but with my credentials it was near impossible finding a job that was worth anything above minimum wage. Buddy was my burden, I needed to care for him but he scared the shit out of me. I was a mess walking around in public, giving a nervous glance to every dog walking down the street. Could they talk too? How about if I give my roommate liquor, could he hear dogs? Buddy became my life, I needed to uncover his secrets. 

Shit out of luck, I was standing on the corner of my block leaning on a post. Putting my hand in my pocket I felt around for anything. *A five dollar note and a 50 cent coin, great.* The block was near empty except for the odd homeless guy planted on their usual spots. Store wise there was a cafe, some second hand stores and a grocery store in between two bars. Quite the miserable sight. So I went up the street into the cafe to think of my predicament. 

Spending my last 5 dollar note, I sat down to wait for my coffee. *I heard online that if you hold your breath for 1 minute, breath for 30 seconds and repeat that process, you can achieve something similar to being wasted. I'd need to try that later-*

“Excuse me, sir?” Pulled out of my thoughts, I looked up to see a waitress hand me my coffee. 

“Oh thanks. Hey, I was wondering if I could get a job here, do you need any work done around the place?”

She gave a flat faced look, a strand of her hair escaped her bun, lying on her apathetic frown. I immediately knew I wasn't getting the job.

I got up and began to walk out of the place, “It's alright dont worry about it nevermind.”

“Wait sir, we're not hiring right now. I'm sorry, but my friend might have a job for you.”

Turning around I returned to her, I was startled by my own pace. “ What have you got? For my expenses I need a job that is above minimum wage but not by much! I'll do anything.”

She was visibly taken back by my outburst.

“Sir… Do you like dogs?”

I rubbed my face, wiping my disappointment off in a clean swipe, “I can deal with dogs, I'm actually taking care of one now.” I sighed reluctantly.

“Well my friend runs a pound a couple blocks over, If you want I can get his number for you? Put in a good word?” She then bent over, scribbling the name, address and number of the place onto a napkin before handing it to me.

“You're a lifesaver, thank you so much.”

I left that store a different man. The sun was brighter, the humidity was warmer and people were smiling. What a day. I didn't even care that I had to walk an hour a day to my new potential job. Even though I had to deal with more dogs, I came up around to the dog issue. Potential experiments were endless.

Making my way there was quite the mission. Not a wonder in the world why I miss this shop everytime I pass by here. My local pound was placed in between two long brick buildings, it looked like the letter H. It opened up slightly when you walked into the glorified alleyway, a rusty gate to the left with a dilapidated building in the middle. At the top of the building lay a deflated inflatable weiner dog, its head flopped over the front roof, a strangled neck, barely keeping the head from falling off.

Swinging the door open came the sound of a ring and a choir of barking dogs. A symphony of muffled barks and howls echoed around the waiting room and the front desk. The sound was emanating from behind the desk in a long corridor, sealed by a wooden door. Behind the front desk sat a large man with a rotund frame.

“Hi, do you work here?”

The man folded his arms, they looked like tree trunks. “Work here? I own this place, how can I help you?”

“I was looking for a job sir.”

“A job? What's your credentials?”

“Dropped out of highschool, I worked at a corporate building for a while, I was the paperboy.” His brow stayed in a stern manner, clearly unimpressed. “I like dogs, I have a dog.” An uncomfortable silence followed this. The Man still had his arms folded, I could see a small patch of mustard in his moustache.

“Well son, are you fine with cleaning up dog shit? Are you fine with putting dogs down? What about handling potentially dangerous animals, with rabies and all of that.”

“Sir please, I'm desperate, I'll do anything.” 

“Show me any form of registration.”

I handed him my old highschool ID from a few years prior, I didn't have a drivers license just yet so that ID was all I really had at the time.

“You're hired, we can do the paperwork later.”

“Great! When can I start?”

“Right now son, I need an extra pair of hands today” He got up grabbing a key from his key ring to the holding room.

“Got some mess you need to clean.”

I had no clue what they fed those dogs and I did not want to find out. The shift was long and tedious but pay was pay. I hated my apartment door late at night, the loud whining and squealing of the hinges would always wake up half the building. Before I could close the door, my roommate stormed out of his room and gave me his classic friendly welcome home.

“Let me smell your breath.”

“No I'm not doing any of that shit anymore I promise.” Buddy was no longer in his usual spot under the fridge, I had no clue where he was.

“Well then why have you been out so long huh? I care about you man, you can't be treating your body this way.”

“I told you I wasn't doing anything of that kind.” I closed the door behind me, “I got a job.”

“A job?” He looked like he was looking for the definition before returning to me in a friendly gaze. “Oh man, that's actually really cool. I'm sorry, where's your work?” 

“At the pound, let me tell you it's not a pretty job.”

“Work is work man, hey maybe next time you go there you can take Buddy with you, he's been weird as shit recently.”

“Besides constantly avoiding you?”

“No no I've gotten used to that,” he wiped his jaw downwards, “yea no its weird ill just show you.”

My roommate led me into my bedroom where Buddy was. He was seated up right a few feet away from my small bookshelf. 

“Yea he's been doing that ever since you left, he hasn't even eaten anything. His eyes have just been darting up and down each book. It's weird.”

“Buddy?” I walked up to the dog's large frame, he was so still. “You alright Buddy?” Peering closer I realised that the dog was dead still, he lacked the animation of breathing. Just a slight turn of his head and eyes peering at each book was the slightest clue to tell us that he wasn't a statue. He looked like a puppet. Shaking the dog did nothing, he was stationary. His folds rippled at the shake of my hands and yet I couldn't move his large frame. I grabbed a blanket from my bed and flung it over the shelf. Buddy immediately stood on his fours and walked out of the room, nudging my roommate out of the way causing him to stumble. Following him out of the room, we saw him seated at the base of the kitchen, staring up into the top shelf. This time he was looking at an edmonds cookbook.

“Okay Buddy, it's late, time for bed.” I said, nervously shifting the book to the back of the shelf. Buddy made many rounds around the apartment after that, analysing each room he went into. Meanwhile, my roommate and I would attempt to hide every book Buddy laid eyes upon. Finally, when there were no books in sight, the dog went to rest. There was no more stomping, no scrambling around the place, nothing. I walked back into my room to rest (I had a big shift the next day). When I took a look at the bookshelf, I was surprised to find that I must've missed the bottom shelf as there was a solitary book sitting in the corner. I'm surprised it was there in the first place as I hadn't seen it in months. There it was, standing upright with an imprint of a golden colour. Completely observable to the naked eye was a King James Bible.",3,1756282586.0,nosleep,1,0.8,False
