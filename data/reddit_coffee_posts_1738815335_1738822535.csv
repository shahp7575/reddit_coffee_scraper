I hope others benefit from it. Feel free to contribute in this thread for others if you have useful things to add!

  
Self work :   
\- Breathwork : I like Othership, iOS/Android. Or free on youtube [https://www.youtube.com/@Othership/videos](https://www.youtube.com/@Othership/videos)  
\- Meditation : I like ""The Way"" on Android/iOS. Calm app is also nice but ""too much choice"" for me  
\- Basic breathing techniques : close eyes and do Box Breathing, 4-7-8  
\- Cold showers / cold water (whether pool, a lake, your bathtub, sink)  
\- Sauna (if you can tolerate it), combines well with cold water after

Supplements : Please note - to maintain effectiveness you must take a week break after eg. 3-4 weeks  
\- Valerian  
\- Lemon balm  
\- Ashwaganda  
\- L-theanine  
\- Brahmi   
\- Herbal teas (chamomile, linden, peppermint, sleep blends (usually have valerian)

Reducing stimulation :   
\- No Caffeine/stimulants.  
 I left the love of my life, coffee. I miss it. But I think it may be for the best, for now  
\- Limit any/all screen time.   
No scrolling my phone. No reading news. Very limited social media. Deliberate use of technology only  
\- If I do watch video/tv I make sure its A) timeboxed B) something relaxing. No action movies, drama, no jumpcut youtube videos. Calming, slow paced stuff only.   
\-Stario Launcher on Android. There's also minimalist launcher.   
This helps to reduce the temptation to use random apps, check stuff, etc. 

Particularly I want to share breathwork. I struggled with meditation because of the mental focus and effort it requires - breathwork comes more easy to me. That said, I have persisted with meditation now and I've managed to make it a daily habit. I feel now after more than 2 months, its starting to bear more fruit. ",1,1738822489.0,cfs,0,1.0,False

I recently came out as a lesbian, after 23 years of developing it.
I recently met a girl who works in the same cultural collective as me.
She is sweet, a strong solo mother and has countless intellectual and emotional qualities.
I approached her without any intention, just for friendship, since we work together.
However, she has a little daughter who is 3 to 4 years old.
I have proposed to help her since we are both unemployed (LOL).
Yesterday and today, I helped clean her house, made us lunch and helped pick her daughter up from school. I organized the little girl's entire room, folded her clothes, washed the bathroom, living room... I did it because I like to help when I have time. It's my language of affection.
Today, after cleaning the house, we sat down to eat together and have a beer, just us. Hearing a sound.
Tomorrow, she asked me to braid her hair. She is super open to friendships. I accepted because I need a portfolio as a trancista.

But when I got home I realized that I was feeling something else. Whether I felt it or not, I would have helped just as much because I really believe in empowering women.
So I don't know if I should braid her tomorrow and at the end, ask her if she would like to have a nice cupcake and coffee for an afternoon, like a date. Should I invite? And to say that in addition to a nice friendship, I felt something different?
My fear is that I got emotional for a second. I'm super capable of letting that go easily. But I thought the exchange was cool. The crazy thing is that she usually receives a lot of visitors and her daughter has affectionate uncles and aunts. What if it's just that and I'm mixing it up?",1,1738822275.0,ainbow,0,1.0,False

The **sony WH-1000XM4** continues to stand out in the competitive market, and a deep dive into specific features and benefits is crucial. Here’s why they remain a solid choice, especially if the price is right when Black Friday approaches:

*   **Noise cancellation:** This is arguably the standout feature of the XM4s.Powered by Sony's HD Noise Cancelling Processor QN1, these headphones effectively block out a wide range of ambient sounds. From the low hum of an airplane to the chatter in a busy coffee shop, the noise cancellation capabilities are superb. They continuously adjust to the surrounding noise, ensuring a focused and immersive listening experience, even in challenging environments. This is critical for our audience who value focused work, travel enjoyment and music immersion.
*   **audio Quality:** Sony’s commitment to high-quality audio is evident. The XM4s deliver a rich, detailed, and balanced sound profile. Bass is deep but not overpowering,mids are clear and defined,and highs are crisp. The headphones support hi-res audio with LDAC technology, allowing music files to be transmitted over Bluetooth with exceptional clarity when paired with devices that also support this feature. While some might find specific nuances they prefer in other headphones, the overall audio quality is very likely to please the majority of listeners.

## Alternatives to Consider

While the **Sony WH-1000XM4** are excellent, understanding the market is crucial. Here are a few alternatives that might be considered along with the XM4, especially if you miss out on the **black friday deals** or if a better fit exists for specific needs:

*   **Sony WH-1000XM5:** The newer model offers an improved design and slightly enhanced noise cancellation. However, the XM5’s increased price point will be the major factor for the user. If affordability is a primary concern, the price reduction for the XM4 during these promotions may prove more worthwhile.
*   **Bose QuietComfort 45:** A strong competitor in the noise-cancelling headphone arena, the Bose QC45 offers comparable noise cancellation capabilities with emphasis on user-friendly interface. They boast a different sound signature that may appeal to those who prefer a specific sonic experience.
*   **Apple AirPods Max:** For those invested in the Apple ecosystem, the airpods Max offer seamless integration and premium build quality. However, they come at a higher price point and are not known for being particularly efficient for travel.
*    **Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless:** This brand is prized amongst audiophiles for sound purity.If the focus is solely on music quality, the higher-priced Momentum 4 might potentially be worthy of consideration.
*   **Other brand headphones:** During Black Friday, other premium brands are often discounted and may provide a viable option, although the specific features may vary widely.

We've been dating for 10 months and recently completed the procedures to move in together next month. 

He bought me a cake and we had sex after. I asked him for a shirt as I've never worn his shirt before. He's very lean but fit and goes to the gym while I'm not fat but not thin either.

His shirt was too snug on me and i felt a bit down about it but didn't voice it out. And while we were joking around in bed, my boyfriend went ""So what is your goal weight for that event again?"" And I starting accusing him that he thinks I'm fat.

For some context, I've veen trying to lose weight and hitting the gym but I've been plateauing for a few weeks. And I've talked to him about these things. He's never called me fat and he has reassured me that he would love me at every size. But i have not talked to him about my body image issues as i wasn't ready yet. We share everything else with each other and keep it pretty open communication -wise. 

So i feel like crying and he asks if i wanna have some cake. I reply that he's made me concious so I'll have a spoon. He looked a bit upset. After a few mins, I went to the bathroom, bawled my eyes out, washed my face twice and then step out to saw that 2 plates on cake were set on the coffee table. He saw me and knew that I'd cried. I cry even more as he reassure me with ""i don't care even if people say 'why does she look like that'? I love you"" and i ask him ""what do you mean? What do i look like???"" That one hurt, regardless of the intention.


He went to shower, came back and said he's disappointed and that he thought we had open communication between us. He said he was doubting whether anything else he said was also being perceived differently by me and then had me leave his house in the next mins saying we both need space.

I sent him a very long text message once i reached home explaining that i reacted that way because of body image issues and that I am working on it. And that i wanted to clarify it's more of a me problem and to let me know once he was ready to have a talk before he comes to any conclusions by himself. And that i love him. 

He responds to my big paragraphs with a single line saying ""we can talk later this week. Love you too"". Followed by 4 days of uninterrupted radio silence. 

I don't wanna text him anymore out of my self respect but i wanted yalls pov on what i did wrong here that would warrant 4 days of silent treatment in the name of space..? It almost feels punitive tbh


TL;DR: i fought with my boyfriend on my birthday and he made me leave his house after the fight. I went home and sent a long text explaining my issues and struggles and that we should chat once he's ready and to reach out. It's been 4 days and he still hasn't contacted me.",1,1738822114.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

These places don't play politics and are the ones to help when someone's house burns down, they get robbed, victimized, etc.

1iivww9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1iivww9/aita_for_ignoring_a_friend_after_they_did/,AITA for ignoring a friend after they did?,"Heya guys,

So long story short, a good friend of mine (friends for just under 2 years, went through a lot of shit together, use to hang out a lot) has been stressing me out to say the least.

Long story short, since early December, she's been leaving me on delivered/read for very long periods (a lot of this conflict arose over text/social media since we hadn't met up in a while).
As far as I can remember, it started when I sent her some sort of funny thing that made think of her (it was a real world picture, where an answer was expected given the nature of how I sent the message).
She left me on read. I remember I sent her a message checking how she was doing. She left me on delivered for like two weeks, all the while being active on social media and even on Whatsapp (where she ignored me).
After that time period, she finally answered with a very short message without offering a follow up for conversation.

I tried to keep it going since I hadn't spoken to her in a while. She went back to ignoring me while being active. After that, I sent her a message making my concerns clear.
After again a period of ignoring me, she claimed that she had been going through something personal and hadn't been responsive to friends at all.

Fair enough, I thought.
After a few weeks again, we ended up meeting for coffee. It was awkward with the elephant in the room, but we had fun.

Fast forward again, I messaged her asking if she wanted to hang out. She left me on delivered for almost a month (again, being active all over social media and other platforms). I sent a follow up as a last effort, asking if she was ok. 

Here's where we currently area. After pretty much a total of 2 months, she finally answered. After all this stress, I actually muted her and hid her chats so I wouldn't need to stress about this situation.

Would I be the asshole if I ignore what she sent me and just try to forget this whole debacle?

I'm worried if I read what she says and I find the explanation acceptable, I'll forgive it and may need to deal with this again at some point all over again.

Edit: I know her message starts with an apology of some sort, since I can read that with the preview feature. K can't read the full message without opening it.",2,1738821970.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

1iivwj7,https://www.reddit.com/r/introvert/comments/1iivwj7/longing/,Longing,"Hi everyone,

First off I want to say thank you if you take the time to read this and reply. 

I’m not used to talking about myself so I don’t know where to start. Basics would be, Im 36, raised by a single mother, I’m introverted, recently single, I don’t have many friends and the ones I do have, I can’t talk to about things of this nature.  

After my breakup, I have been struggling with loneliness and feeling inadequate, compounded by the fact I work from home and don’t get out much. Being introverted is generally by choice, making conscious decisions to avoid going to bars or clubs to meet people. I have tried dating apps in the past but no luck, I never know what to say, maybe my bio is insufficient or I’m just not what people are looking for. I have never been married, I have no kids, I’m financially and mentally stable (other than feeling lonely) and yet every relationship ends with me hearing “you deserve someone better” or “you’ll find the one you deserve”. I know people have met their soul mates at coffee shops or grocery stores.. I don’t drink coffee and if I bumped into someone’s cart at the grocery store I’d be apologetic and red faced but would never think of hitting on someone after hitting them. I just want to find a person I can be myself with, someone I can respect and love. 

Thank you for any reply or advice

I recently came out as a lesbian, after 23 years of developing it.
I recently met a girl who works in the same cultural collective as me.
She is sweet, a strong solo mother and has countless intellectual and emotional qualities.
I approached her without any intention, just for friendship, since we work together.
However, she has a little daughter who is 3 to 4 years old.
I have proposed to help her since we are both unemployed (LOL).
Yesterday and today, I helped clean her house, made us lunch and helped pick her daughter up from school. I organized the little girl's entire room, folded her clothes, cleaned the bathroom, living room... I did it because I like to help when I have time. It's my language of affection.
Today, after cleaning the house, we sat down to eat together and have a beer, just us. Hearing a sound.
Tomorrow, she asked me to braid her hair. She is super open to friendships. I accepted because I need a portfolio as a trancist.

But when I got home I realized that I was feeling something else. Whether I felt it or not, I would have helped just as much because I really believe in empowering women.
So I don't know if I should braid her tomorrow and at the end, ask her if she would like to have a nice cupcake and coffee for an afternoon, like a date. Should I invite? And to say that in addition to a nice friendship, I felt something different?
My fear is that I got emotional for a second. I'm super capable of letting that go easily. But I thought the exchange was cool. The crazy thing is that she usually receives a lot of visitors and her daughter has affectionate uncles and aunts. What if it's just that and I'm mixing it up?",1,1738821909.0,lgbt,0,1.0,False
1iivw6u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1iivw6u/parking_lots/,Parking lots.,"At many different points in my life, I’ve found myself sitting in a parking lot.
A parking lot is an easy place to run to . . .
When you just need to get out.
When your heart is broken.
When you don’t know what else to do.
When you don’t have anywhere else to go.
When you need to sit in silence and drink a coffee in peace.
When you’re having the hardest conversations.
When you’re trying to make a big decision.
When you just got the worst news.
When you’re not ready to go home.
A parking lot is a place you can be alone, even as humanity continues to hum and move around you. It’s a place you can be anonymous and safe, where there is space for whatever you’re feeling. It’s a place you can sit in your car heaving big ugly sobs and not a soul will judge. 

The thing about parking lots is that they are transient. They’re a resting place, a reprieve, a semi-colon for your thoughts and feelings. But you’re not meant to stay there forever.
And after I find myself in a parking lot, I always manage to make my way home.

I have a thing I can't get out of my mind. 
So, 17years old I had my first longest relationship around 5 years. There was a lot of love but equally there was intense fights and breakups. And back again. The girl was a bit younger. She used to come to my house at times we had school the next day, and we sacrificed our hours to be together and enjoy love. Stuff that young kids do I suppose. 
Anyway. Long story short. 
I was not the good guy. I have cheated on her when we had these small break ups and I have caught myself liying to her multiple times. Most of the time out of fear, that I will lose her.
My sex drive was very high also I believe, and that led to wrong decisions many times.
All that caused our relationship to break, until the girl took on to her own strength and left me on cold blood. We never break up in a good way, all of our break ups were intense and loud. 
Anyway, deep inside I was proud for her. That's exactly why I liked her in the first place. For the spontaneous and dynamic person she was. 
I was the one who feared. 
A few months after breakup I left for studies in another country. 
2 years later into studies, I got into a new relationship with my previous partner.. 
I had no contact with my ex for many years and after 10 or 12  years she added me on FB..
It was a time that I was alone in my home country,, away from my partner, so I took the chance and asked her if she'd like to go for a coffee. She accepted and we went. One thing let to another we met 2 more times, one for food and one for drink and thats about it. 
It didn't went anywhere sexual. She just mentioned/asked me at some point that ""You didn't loved me,right?""
 
Anyway, after this last night we had, I decided to delete her from my fb and move on with my life as I wanted to respect and to be faithful to my new partner and not do the same fucking mistakes again. 
And I didn't want my previous partner seeing my ex on my fb randomly liking my posts and shit like that. 

The problem here is that, after 15 whole years, this girl comes in my mind and in my dreams in forms of a woman, many times wondering around not talking, sometimes looking straight at me. Other times we have small talk conversations but the whole situation is quite erotic. 
 I feel that its like karma hitting me up with shame, anger or unfulfilled dreams(?). 
Sometimes I feel it wants to tell me that she was actually my soul mate and I lost her? 
This situation is affecting my thoughts, my appetite, my Sleep, Fatigue, my current relationship and my dreams a couple of days every month. What is happening here and why such a manifestation on one person? 
I had people who screwd my life over, I ve been in other relationships but none hurt so much and never thought about them so much or so intense. 
So I am convinced that It's not hate, it's love that it's doing all these manifestations inside me but what kind of love is this I cannot recognize..

My previous partner is a person that I admire and I love her. we try to fix things when we get into a problems rather fighting it of, and in general she helped me understand life better. We live everything together and I truly love her.

My question is how do I work this event so they progress me to formally begin the interview process? 

I have no idea if they just want me to meet the team or if they would like to see how I interact with their customers and partners. This is very new to me and all my interviews over the last 5 years have been on Zoom.

I assume I am not the only candidate they are inviting to this and if I run into colleagues or reps I know from other companies it would be a disaster lol. The base for this role is higher than my take home last year so I fell the juice is worth the squeeze.

1iivula,https://i.redd.it/76ae7iqqlghe1.jpeg,I did a thing. Tried grinding my own coffee after decades of thinking these were Satan’s beans. 🫘,"Truth be told, I’ve been drinking coffee for almost a decade, even as a nuanced TBM. But it hits different when you finally decide to buy a machine and make it yourself at home instead of wasting money at Starbucks or the gas station while hoping you don’t run into Brother Nielson from the Elder’s Quorum. 

Side Story: I was so paranoid that my TBM wife would catch me drinking coffee and confront me about it that I once went undercover and drove an hour to a house that my wife was at for a baby shower after realizing that she borrowed my car and there were empty coffee cups in the center console!

She was carpooling with friends and I kind of freaked out that they would all discover my Telestiality (new word) on the drive. 

So I put on strange clothes, hoodie, sunglasses, and a Covid mask and went to the house where the car was parked in the driveway. 

I prayed that no one would see me break into my own car as I filled up a trash bag with Starbucks cups. The battle was real! Nevermos, please don’t laugh at me 😭 

So basically what I’m saying is that I’ve come a long way! Even though I’ve been out for 3 years now, it will be interesting to see what my TBM wife says when she smells coffee brewing from my downstairs office. ",3,1738821730.0,exmormon,0,1.0,False

However, I tend to get very flustered when it's applied to something beyond that. I've gotten questions about satellites, solar panels, liquid engines, etc. I try my best to use my intuition and at least approach it in a simplified way to get ballpark answers, but I don't think I hit the mark.

How can I get more familiar with the basic components of various space technologies, and basic scenarios they'd have to consider?

As of right now, I try to find published academic papers but I feel like I'm not retaining much, and I'm unsure if these specific experiments are reflective of common industry practices.

Tips for Making Creamy Vegan Ice Cream Without Dairy Ingredients
----------------------------------------------------------------

Making creamy vegan ice cream without dairy ingredients is easier than you might think! With some clever substitutions and techniques, you can whip up delicious frozen treats that are totally plant-based. Here are some helpful tips to get you started on your delicious dairy-free ice cream journey.

### Choose the Right Base

When it comes to vegan ice cream, the base plays a vital role in achieving that creamy texture. Here are some options:

- **Cashews:** Soaked and blended cashews create a rich, creamy base. Just soak for a few hours, blend until smooth, and you're set!
- **Almond Milk:** Almond milk offers a light and slightly nutty flavor. While it may not be as creamy as other options, combining it with thickeners can enhance the texture.
- **Silken Tofu:** This plant-based protein provides a creamy consistency without the added fat of nuts. Blend it until smooth, and it will take on the flavor of whatever you mix it with.
- **Oat Milk:** Oat milk is naturally creamy and works well as a base. Look for full-fat varieties to get that richer texture.

### Incorporate Thickeners

To achieve that indulgent, creamy goodness, use natural thickeners alongside your liquid base:

- **Arrowroot Powder:** Mix it with a bit of cold water to create a slurry before adding it to your ice cream base. This powder helps thicken the mixture while freezing.
- **Agar-Agar:** A plant-based gelatin, agar-agar can thicken and stabilize your ice cream. Dissolve it in hot water before adding it to the mix.
- **Nut Butters:** Peanut or almond butter adds creaminess and a hint of flavor. They're a great way to enrich your ice cream while boosting protein content.

### Sweeten Naturally

Instead of refined sugar, consider using natural sweeteners for a healthier option:

- **Maple Syrup:** This liquid sugar adds a delicious depth of flavor and blends smoothly into your ice cream base.
- **Agave Nectar:** With a mild taste, agave nectar is another great choice for sweetening without overpowering other flavors.
- **Dates:** Blending soaked dates creates a natural sweetness along with a thick, caramel-like consistency. Just ensure to pit them first!

### Experiment with Flavorings

Don’t be afraid to get creative with flavors. Here are some ways to amp up your vegan ice cream:

- **Cocoa Powder:** For a rich chocolate flavor, simply add cocoa powder or melted dairy-free chocolate to your base.
- **Vanilla Extract:** It enhances almost any flavor and is a classic addition. Use pure vanilla extract for the best results.
- **Fresh Fruits:** Puree bananas, strawberries, or mango for a naturally sweet and fruity twist.

### Chill and Freeze Properly

Once you blend your ingredients, chilling your base before churning is essential. This helps achieve a creamier texture. Here's the ideal process:

1. Chill your ice cream base for about 2-3 hours in the fridge.
2. Pour it into your ice cream maker and churn according to the manufacturer's instructions.
3. Transfer churned ice cream to a container and freeze for at least 4-6 hours for a firmer consistency.

### Consider Mix-Ins and Toppings

Once your ice cream is ready, adding mix-ins can make it even more delightful:

- **Chopped Nuts:** Add a crunch factor with walnuts, pecans, or almonds.
- **Vegan Chocolate Chips:** These can complement many flavors and add a sweet surprise in every bite.
- **Fruit Swirls:** Fold in pureed fruit or sauces like strawberry or raspberry for a refreshing taste.

Making vegan ice cream without dairy ingredients opens up a world of possibilities. With these tips, you can create a rich and creamy frozen dessert tailored to your taste, all while keeping it plant-based. Enjoy your homemade treats guilt-free!

### Conclusion

From fruity mango sorbet to rich chocolate avocado treats, these alternatives prove that you can craft delightful frozen desserts that cater to various tastes and dietary restrictions.

We will have a few days in La Fortuna & Monteverde. Its a short time so trying to pack in the must do but also have time to relax. Its a bit hard as most activities are during the day so optimizing that time with the drive is a bit complicated. We will be hiring a shuttle so they will do the driving.

  
Day 1: We leave San Jose to La Fortuna early in the morning. We should arrive in La Fortuna around 1-2pm. 

Is it worth going straight to Rio Celeste? or doing the Mistico Hanging bridge

What is good to do at night in La Fortuna?

  
Day 2: Arenal Waterfall, Volcano Hike and Hot Springs.

Day 3: Leave to Monteverde in the morning, get there around 11/12pm. Do a coffee tour in the afternoon and nightwalk in evening or check out the nearby restaurants.

  
Day 4: Visit one of the cloud forests in the morning and do ziplining.

  
We will leave early the next day to Manuel Antonio

1iivfz8,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_RL_Shine/comments/1iivfz8/i_love_to_step_on_bugs_and_ive_done_much_worse/,"I love to step on bugs, and I've done much worse ~ ! -_^ Tee hee...","I found this in my saved posts, so much to clean up and organize of late, but yeah, my number one favorite thing other than walking around barefoot in the spring and summer outside in town and forests is to step on bugs and kill them - more than books, coffee, flowers, night, gaming, my number one favorite thing is stepping on bugs. I've made it into a hobby by practicing chasing them with my bare feet (which yes, I do step on them with, but usually have shoes on and kill them with shoes on too) with mixing dance with acrobatics with martial arts all into one thing I'm just calling Rebeccan Stomp for now, ballet with parkour with capoeira all in one, and I'll chase bugs around, especially like roaches at night in parks under picnic duck outs, kill hundreds a night, perfect target practice since they move and change direction so fast - I will do backflips and cartwheels to land my feet on them.

I also like killing and torturing them other ways, though - I do take a shit on them when I find them in the bathroom, or a piss, but if I'm living alone I'll not flush but just close the seat and lid and let them stew in there and suffer, which actually does hurt them, burns them through seeping into their body through the exoskeleton like being on fire but also preserves them and keeps them alive longer, which makes it more mean and so it's more fun and funny, and will flush when he's dead or it's full and just keep reusing it until then without flushing.

If you're a mom and have boys that you wanna take hunting the SLF in the northeast US in spring and summer between stomping them, you can collect them in a bottle and then on the trip back have your sons pee into the bottle of them alive as a piss bottle - or you can have your daughters do that if there aren't sons and use a FUD or the boys just close their eyes if you have both - girl's don't have to close for boys, they can watch if they want.

I'll also use them as lotion for the more juicy and less crunchy ones, whenever I need foot lotion they're actually super rich nutrients for the skin on your feet which is very different from the rest of your body, and if I'm feeling horny I can use them collected and fed and aired in a jar as lube and crush them alive as lotion for my dick and balls, super smooth and fun and funny to do for me.

I'm also a good shot, I can piss on bugs mid-air or on a wall or wherever that are like the distance of across a street if I do it right, including high up too - and so naturally when I masturbate I can control the shot and have target practiced enough with flies mid-air where I can take 'em out mid-flight with my cum, super cool and then he's just stuck on the ground or floor with goo, and I tend to let him suffer but if I'm in the mood I'll just step on him and move on.

The other thing I'll do is catch them and put them in a big two liter bottle and pour a little oil in there, shake it up around, put holes for small breathing in the bottom and a mesh down there and put the bottom back on and the sides not enough to get out and a little bit of food and water, then when there's enough bugs in there, when I gotta fart what I'll do is unscrew the lid and take out the bottom so the mesh is the only thing that's left and I'll take a small tube with a hole in the side and record this on video, put one end into my ass and the other into the top of the bottle having it sideways, and then put a lighter in the gap on the side, light it and fart as hard as I can and watch like 30 different living bugs get lit on fire with a huge fireball blowing out the bottom into the air bigger than spray deodorant and that, and the bugs scamper around and burn up in the bottle over five minutes of a calmer fire, and just laugh the whole time watching them die.

And you can also just lay down wedge them between your butt-cheeks and when you gotta fart light a lighter and the flame will actually go back as well as the normal front and flamethrower him out rather than a normal flame burst and it sounds like a paper being crumbled up with a squeal (which is him in pain) and super cool.

Let's see, haha, there's a few other things, and they don't come to mind right now but I'm sure I can just edit them in later if I feel like it. I love all things with fur, feathers, scales, or amphibians, but some crustaceans and all but a few bugs - spiders, ladybugs, butterflies all get passes - are toys for me.

I like being mean to bugs \~ !

1iivfa7,https://www.reddit.com/r/FuckeryUniveristy/comments/1iivfa7/movein_special/,Move-in Special,"Momma and I weren’t married yet, though I’d asked casually one night.  No fanfare, it just so easily feeling right. And she’d just as easily and casually said yes.  We’d known each other for only maybe a couple of months by then, but we knew.  

We left the apartment (first of my own I’d ever had) we were living in when we were informed that a rent increase on all if the units would be introduced soon.  

We found a tiny but nice one-bedroom apartment with a studio arrangement for the postage stamp sized living room and an even smaller kitchen, an open counted separating the two (Dining room, lol).  

But a spacious bedroom with adjoining full bath and shower that was as big of bugger than kitchen and LR combined. And it had a small, open, railed balcony, as we were in the second floor.  

Cramped, but plenty of room in the bedroom for a crib, though we didn’t know yet that a baby was on the way.  And a nice big aquarium. Sliding glass doors opening from it onto the balcony.  Brand new apartment, no previous tenants. In a new complex having only recently been constructed.  

And a sweetheart deal:  

“I think this unit would be perfect for a young couple” from the estate agent. “And with the balcony, you’ll get nice breezes all year.  Southerly the great majority of the time.” We’d remember that later, the witch).  

“Monthly?”

“Special move-in rate. $200.00 a month. Confidentiality, it’s been a little slow filling the units.  That time of year.”

We’d remember that, too. Pretty sure she was enjoying herself. 

“Laundry facilities on the premises for common use, and there’s the very large pool I showed you.  No other multi-unit property in the city has one that size.”

“Utilities?”

“Covered in their entirety by the monthly rate.”

“Really?”

“Really.  Too good to pass up. There Is a required minimum one year lease, renewable at the end of the year. It’s pretty ironclad, I’m afraid. Will that be an obstacle?  And there Is a fairy sizable security deposit. Forfeitable if the lease is broken…..but I can assure you you won’t find another comparable offer.”  

A minion of the devil, she was.  Younger sister, likely.

Momma and I looked at each other only briefly, and she nodded assent.  

“We’ll take it” I replied. Oh to be young, innocent, and inexperienced again!

“Wonderful!  I just Know you’ll both be very happy here.”

Evil, evil, evil. 

“With the poolside amenities, and the warm weather we have nearly year ‘round, you’ll be spending much of your time outside.”

Creature from the Pit. 

We moved in our sparse furnishings (took only one day) and were quite taken with our new pocket home. It was intimate, and just right for the two of us! We brought the old leather couch my First Sgt and his wife had previously given us (took up about a quarter of the living room, with a few feet to pass between it and the tv).  Our bed (Momma had insisted on a frame, headboard, and box springs to augment my mattress when she’d moved in).  

The lighted aquarium on its stand. 

Cookware to replace the one pot, one frying pan, single coffee cup, Bowie knife, and single fork and spoon that I’d found sufficient before she had taken up residence. And she did insist at that time that it might be a good idea to wash the frying pan now and then instead of continuing to use previous grease. But I’d been keeping it in the frig between uses, and hadn’t seen a problem. 

The round wooden picnic table with two small benches I’d been using as a dining room table pre-her we had no room for. 

And the balcony!  Gonna put a string  hammock on it!

Home sweet Home!  With my Sweety in it!  The Captain hadn’t chewed me out in two whole days, and all was right with my world! 

I slid open the door and stepped out onto the balcony with a fresh cup of coffee in hand.  From the coffee maker Momma had bought to replace the Folgers Instant I’d been accustomed to. Had to admit it was an improvement. 

And spit out the sip I’d just taken. You know how when you breath in a satisfied apartment renter with a balcony lungful of fresh air, it can affect the flavor of what’s in your mouth? 

I knew that stench I was tasting!  I ‘d shoveled enough of it!  But not nearly in as concentrated form as this!  I scarce could breathe!  As I watched, a lone bird flew into the side of the building and tumbled lifeless to the ground. Suicide.  He couldn’t take it, either. 

There had been a string of a few days of slightly cooler weather when we’d moved in, with a gentle northerly breeze tugging at our heartstrings. 

But it had shifted now again to the south, grown warmer again, and picked up in intensity. An exploratory drive revealed the cattle pens just to the south of our location, behind a band of concealing trees. Lots of ‘em.  With Lots of tenants closely packed. And which from the smell may never have been exactly cleaned. 

And we’d just signed a one year lease. ",4,1738820107.0,FuckeryUniveristy,3,1.0,False

A few years ago, I decided to go back to school for my bachelors in psych. My goal was to become a psychologist. 
I just graduated with my bachelors in December, I had to quit my full time job last year in January because my university schedule was dumb and it conflicted with my work schedule. I did it because I was trying to “invest in myself” and “follow my dreams”. Anyway, I wanted to go into grad school after graduating, but decided to take a year or two off so I could save up money. I thought in the meantime, I could get a job within my field that would allow me to gain experience and insight which would help me as I could add this on my application. I’m currently making $16.50 which is 50¢ above minimum wage here in California. I make $20 at coffee bean. Don’t get me wrong, I’m enjoying the job. But I find it ridiculous that my full time job was paying me $23 and now I’m making a laughable wage with a degree. I took the job bc I was scared to run out of savings and not have a job, figured I could keep looking…but now I feel like I shot myself in the foot. I had a job interview today and they seemed to look down on me for wanting to leave this job so quickly (I’ve been here 3 weeks). I’m at a loss for words. I get I don’t have medical experience, and I did want experience in the clinical psych field to see if I wanted to pursue that route, but I feel so defeated. At this point I feel I wasted my time getting a degree and I should’ve just worked my way up at my corporate job I wasn’t passionate about. Life is getting more expensive, I’m 30, and I feel like I’m running out of time. I’ll never be able to make decent living at this rate or help my parents out like I wanted. I truly want to just give up. ",3,1738819671.0,psychologystudents,7,1.0,False

So, I took some photos and tracked my usage.

My home is about 1,200 square feet, with a 70/30 mix of medium-pile carpet and hard flooring. It’s just me and my heavy-shedding Border Collie. Since we hike often, my dog brings in plenty of dirt.

For routine cleaning, I use my Ryobi cordless vacuum about twice a week for quick spot cleans, mostly in the kitchen and entryway where debris builds up. I empty the Ryobi once a month. My SEBO Felix, on the other hand, comes out every Sunday for a deep clean—floors, furniture, drapes, vents, baseboards, and all the other little spaces. The whole process takes about 20 minutes.

This is my fifth bag in 16 months. The first one filled up in under two weeks because my old Shark left behind so much dirt. Since then, I’ve been changing bags roughly every 3-4 months. The one I just replaced lasted exactly three months, installed on August 2nd. Summer tends to be the dirtiest season for us, so I expect a bit more debris during this time.

In 16 months, I’ve spent about $22 on bags—roughly $1.38 per month. The bag I removed held about a pound of hair, dirt, and debris. To show how well it compacts, I placed a coffee mug on top—it’s as firm as a pillow. Despite being full, I never noticed a drop in suction or cleaning performance.

I was wondering if the SSP espresso burrs would fit but I’ve found mixed results for Eureka models that are 65mm and can have the 64mm fit.

I went with the Helios 65 because I was able to purchase it at an amazing deal and didn’t have much time to research it. All around, it’s a great grinder but I have 2 things for criticism. It’s grind retention and burr selection. As mentioned, I can only find 2 stores that 100% fit the 65mm size. It’s grind retention, I am having trouble figuring out. I’m starting to think I need to screw in a new declumper, but it looks totally fine.

### Natural Materials

Natural materials into your kitchen design adds texture and a sense of warmth. Here are some materials to consider:

- **Wood:** Opt for reclaimed wood or bamboo cabinetry, which not only reduces waste but also adds a rustic charm.
- **Stone:** Think about granite or quartz countertops that emulate natural stones found in nature, for a durable yet earthy look.

### Earthy Decor Elements

Accessorizing is where you can let your creativity shine. Incorporate decor elements that highlight earthy aesthetics:

- **Plants:** Bring the outdoors in with potted herbs or leafy green plants. Not only do they purify the air, but they also add life to your kitchen.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/earthy-home-decor-kitchen  
  
### Functional Spaces

Don’t forget that a kitchen is also about functionality. Emphasizing earthy decor doesn’t mean compromising on efficiency. Think about:

- **Open Shelving:** Use wood or metal shelving to showcase colorful dishware that complements earthy tones.
- **Multi-Purpose Furniture:** Consider a farmhouse table that serves as both cooking prep space and dining area. It ties the room together.
- **Smart Storage Solutions:** Hide clutter with baskets or boxes that fit into your theme, making your kitchen feel organized yet relaxed.

The Impact of Color Schemes on Earthy Kitchen Decor: Choosing the Right Shades for a Warm Ambiance
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creating a warm and inviting kitchen is all about the right choices, and one of the most impactful elements in achieving this is color schemes. When it comes to earthy home decor in your kitchen, selecting the perfect shades can transform the space into a haven of comfort and style. Earthy colors mimic the natural world, from soft browns and greens to warm terracotta and muted yellows, and they can greatly enhance the ambiance of the heart of your home.

### Understanding Earthy Colors

Earthy colors are those that reflect the colors found in nature. They evoke feelings of calmness, warmth, and connectedness to the environment. By using these tones, you can create a kitchen that feels inviting and cozy. Here are some common earthy colors to consider:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/earthy-home-decor-kitchen  
  
- **Beige:** A versatile neutral that adds warmth without overwhelming the space.
- **Olive Green:** Rich and organic, this shade brings a touch of outdoor freshness to indoor spaces.
- **Terracotta:** This warm, rustic hue is ideal for adding a pop of color while still feeling grounded.
- **Warm Gray:** A sophisticated tone that pairs well with other earth-tones while underlining a modern aesthetic.
- **Deep Brown:** This shade can add dimension and richness, making your kitchen feel more expansive and inviting.

### Choosing the Right Shades

The first step in selecting your earthy color scheme is to assess the natural light in your kitchen. If your kitchen receives ample sunlight, you have more flexibility with richer, deeper tones. Here are some strategies to guide your choices:

#### Consider Your Kitchen's Lighting

Natural and artificial lights can drastically alter the appearance of colors. Test your chosen shades in different lighting. Paint swatches on your walls and observe how they look throughout the day. Warm sunlight can enhance deep shades, making them more vibrant, while cooler lighting can mute softer tones.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/earthy-home-decor-kitchen  
  
#### Create a Color Palette

Establishing a cohesive color palette is crucial. You might choose one dominant earthy color and a couple of accent shades. For example:

- **Dominant Color:** Soft beige for walls.
- **Accent Color:** Olive green for cabinets.
- **Complementary Color:** Terracotta for accessories, such as dishware or curtains.

### Mixing and Matching Colors

While it might be tempting to stick to one predominant shade, mixing earthy colors can create depth and visual interest in your kitchen decor. Use complementary colors to break up the monotony, but do it mindfully. A little bit of contrast can go a long way. For instance, if the walls are a warm beige, consider adding deep brown or olive green accents to your kitchen island. Adding textures through natural materials like wood or stone will also enhance the earthy feel.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/earthy-home-decor-kitchen  
  
#### Textures Enhance Color

Think about incorporating different textures to highlight the colors in your kitchen. Materials like reclaimed wood for cabinets, stone countertops, and natural fabrics for window treatments can make earthy colors come alive. Textures not only add depth but also play a role in creating a warm and inviting ambiance.

### Personalizing Your Space

Remember, your kitchen is a personal space. Consider including favorite pieces that resonate with you. Artwork featuring earthy tones, plants, or handmade pottery can blend beautifully with your color scheme. These personal touches make the space feel uniquely yours while enhancing the overall decor.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/earthy-home-decor-kitchen  
  
#### Final Tips for a Warm Ambiance

For a truly welcoming kitchen, keep these additional tips in mind:

- **Accent Lighting:** Install warm-toned lighting fixtures to complement your earthy palette.
- **Open Shelving:** Use open shelves to display earthy-colored dishware and plants.
- **Add Greenery:** Incorporate houseplants to breathe life into your decor.

By thoughtfully selecting and combining earthy hues, you can create a kitchen that embodies warmth and comfort. Whether you’re cooking a meal or enjoying a cup of coffee, an earthy color scheme can make your kitchen feel like the heart of your home.

### Conclusion

Transforming your kitchen into a warm and inviting space begins with embracing earthy elements. By incorporating natural materials such as wood, stone, and ceramics, you can create an atmosphere that resonates with comfort and authenticity. Consider using elements like wooden countertops, stone backsplashes, and handmade pottery to bring a touch of nature indoors. These choices not only elevate the aesthetic but also encourage feelings of relaxation and connection to the environment.

Accent colors inspired by nature, such as terracotta or forest green, can invigorate your space and highlight the earthy decor. Collaborating different shades effectively helps set a mood that invites family and friends to gather, whether it’s for a casual meal or entertaining guests.

Ultimately, the combination of earthy materials and thoughtful color choices shapes a kitchen that feels warm and welcoming. It’s more than just decorating; it’s about crafting a space where you want to spend time cooking, sharing meals, and making memories. By focusing on these elements, you can create a kitchen that not only looks beautiful but also feels comfortable and inviting—a true reflection of home.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/Urp6M8vskH): **January 2, 2025**

My husband M(41M) is the worst at gift giving. We have been together over 3 years and after the 1st year of not receiving anything for my birthday, anniversary, Christmas, Valentines Mother’s Day was the last straw after being told I wasn’t his mother. I decided to start matching energy.

Father’s Day came and I was gone all day when normally I would have put together a big lunch / dinner and drive 30/45 minutes to go get his daughter Ann (now 16) so they could spend the day together. He called me in the afternoon and I was polite but not initiating conversation. He asked me when I was picking up his daughter and I replied I had plans and wasn’t aware that I was supposed to pick her up since nothing was communicated to me. When he responded with it’s Fathers Day I used his response back You are not my Father.

I had anticipated him getting upset and knew a constructive conversation would not be had so when he started to raise his voice I told him check the table and hung up. I had left a letter to him communicating how much I was hurt about going out of my way for him and to not have any sort of reciprocation. He called me later and said he would try to be better and work on it. (I ended up going to get his daughter during the week so they could enjoy a dinner together.) Background info - he drives big rig trucks so the vehicle we use for everyday travel is mine.

He’s been better about the gifts, it’s more of go pick something out and I will pay for it which I really don’t mind. He does the same thing with his daughter. I do all the shopping for his family gifts when it comes to birthdays and Holidays. Cut to a week before Christmas and I wake up to my favorite coffee drink and my husband taking me to out to eat for breakfast followed by a trip to the mall to pick out my Christmas gift. I rarely splurge on myself when it comes to purses and clothes. I have a preteen son from my first marriage so I tend to be more practical on myself and spend on him for his birthday and Christmas. My stepdaughter however is very materialistic and always is asking for money or something expensive and between her father and his family and her mother and her family and her stepfather she always gets it.

I had been repeatedly saying out loud that I needed a new purse since mine was hanging on by a thread and had decided to invest in a good designer handbag. I started saving money and looking online for my new dream purse. So imagine my surprise and excitement when we get to the department store and I see they have my dream purse in stock. My husband sort of gave a look when he saw the price and I told him I could contribute and explained how I had been saving so I could save enough to get this purse that I had been dreaming about for months. He shook his head and said I deserved it and he would get it for me but also gave me the expectation that since he was getting me this he really couldn’t afford to get me anything else. I screamed with delight and told him that was ok I didn’t need anything else.

With that taken care of my husband asked me if it was ok to go get his daughter and take her Christmas shopping. I had tons to do at home in preparation for the holiday so this worked out so I could have the house empty to get what I needed done. I was reaching to get my new purse when we arrived home and he said for me to leave it because he had another gift he had previously purchased for me that he was going to put inside the purse for me to open on Christmas. I was on Cloud 9 so I kissed him and left my bag and went inside. I was still busy cleaning and decorating when he got home later that night and the rest of the days before Christmas were all a blur with me trying to get my house ready for the Holiday.

I hosted Christmas Eve at my house with my family and Christmas Day I slept in tired from the night before and woke up with enough time to brush my teeth before we headed out to go get his daughter then drive to spend the day at his mothers house. I fell asleep on the drive and woke up after his daughter was picked up and we were already in route to his moms. I turned around to greet his daughter and that’s when I saw her rummaging and holding my new purse!!! Where did you get that purse? I asked her and the car fell completely silent. I looked at my husband and he stayed silent with both hands on the wheel looking straight ahead. I asked her again this time in a louder more stern tone. She looked down and quietly mumbled “my dad gave it to me.”

YOU WHAT!!! I screamed!!!!! How would you think it was ok to give her my new purse!!!! He told me to calm down and I cut him off and screamed No and then turned back to his daughter and told her that her father had no right to give her my purse and that she needed to give it back to which she refused. I could feel my anger raging then subsiding to a feeling of sadness and complete defeat. I put my coat over my head and leaned against the window trying to cover my face and mouth as tears started running down my cheeks. My husband pulled over at the next gas station and his daughter bolted out taking the purse with her. He tried to comfort me to which I slapped his hand away and told him not to touch me and gave him a look of disgust.

He informed me that after he dropped me off that day he picked up his daughter took her shopping and on the way taking her home she noticed the bag and saw the purse. She begged and pleaded with him to please let her have it. She reminded him about all the times he never got her a gift and how giving her this purse would make up for it and that played on his heart and he finally caved and gave her my purse. He tried to say he was going to make it up to me and I asked him how knowing it was impossible. He already spent his money and made it clear that he wasn’t going to have money to buy me anything else. I couldn’t help but get upset as I tried to get him to understand how hurt I felt and how it’s not like she was suffering with her getting to open presents from her mother and stepfather plus gifts from their family along with the gifts she was going to get from his family and that he already spent money on her for her Christmas presents and that was my one gift.

I know Christmas is not about getting presents but I was extremely upset that my husband could be so thoughtless and not consider the amount of pain this was going to cause me. His phone rang and it was his daughter calling from inside asking him to come inside because she needed money to buy something. As he was walking into the store I looked back and tears began to fill my eyes as I saw all the gifts I picked out for his family with care. Something came over me and I stopped crying and got out and got in the drivers seat and wiped my face and peeled out of the gas station parking lot leaving my husband and stepdaughter behind. I turned my phone off and drove back to town and spent the day with my family at my cousins house and stayed with them not returning any of my husbands phone calls and not returning home until late following day.

The only phone call I did return was the one from my stepdaughter’s mother to set her straight after she left me a hateful message about leaving her daughter stranded because I was jealous her father bought her a new purse. I told her she had been told a lie and informed her of the truth. That in fact her father did not buy her a new purse he bought me a new purse and she played on her father’s emotions after he had already bought her expensive items from her Christmas list to guilt him to giving her my purse. She apologized and tried to come up with a solution to which I replied for her not to bother. The damage has been done.

I found out through my SIL that my husband’s brother went to go get them and the story came out later that evening. His mother is on his side while his brother & SIL and other aunts and uncles sided with me and got onto his daughter. I have not spoken to his daughter since Christmas and things are unsettling at home. I have become more distant from my husband and when I make dinner I don’t serve him a plate, I serve only my son and myself and I only engage in conversation with my son. He’s tried to reach for me at night when we are in bed and I always end up crying. I am not angry or mad I just feel nothingness. He’s back on the road and I do miss him but I can’t shake the feeling of how he let me down and I cannot hide my looks of disappointment. Looking to see what others have to say about the situation.

**Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** NTA.

But why are you in this marriage? You don’t matter to your husband.

Period.

**Commenter 2:** She’s doing so much to make it easier for her husband to treat her the way she deserves to be treated. She has literally begged him. If he isn’t doing it by now, he never will. She deserves so much better.

**Commenter 3:** Same. Immediate divorce. No counseling, etc. He doesn’t care about his wife at all and has been using her as bangmaid all this time.

**Commenter 4:** The way he has continually ignored you on all major events and milestones, and then gave away your first actual gift (that you had to choose and partially pay for), is appalling. NTA

**Commenter 5:** Take your son and go back to your family. Yes, it will be hard, but it won’t be as hard as staying in a relationship where you don’t matter.

Your husband slapped you in the face on Christmas. What did he think was going to happen when you arrived at your destination and the presents were given out and there was nothing for you?

Don’t get over it, get over him.

Does he even want a wife? He doesn’t sound like he cares for you at all.

**Commenter 6:** NTA. He gave away your gift without asking and used guilt to justify it? That's a major betrayal. It’s not about the purse—it’s about feeling unheard and disrespected. You had every right to stand your ground and take space.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/M1CVj0tBJg): **January 30, 2025 (four weeks later)**

I had updated on my original post but I don’t know if it gets put back out so readers can view it. I figured it was easier to start a new post with my update.

*Update* Wow! I did not expect this to blow up like it did. Thank you to everyone who reached out. I meant to come back and update sooner, my apologies. I wanted to clear up some things and defend myself on not being as pathetic as some made me out to be.

1.) I did not pay for the purse, I offered but he paid the full amount.

2.)He technically pays for the gifts for his family for Christmas. We have an account that he puts money on and this is what is used to pay the bills and other expenses along with gifts for his family for birthdays and other special occasions. I am the one who actually shops for the gifts and I make it personal for each person and do all the wrapping and such and add on from my budget what I feel is needed.

3.) This had gotten erased when I was first posting trying to edit but is a key factor. When I confronted my stepdaughter about returning the purse she wasn’t saying anything, she was refusing by shaking her head no and her father yelled her name and that is when she dropped the bomb on us that she had already written her name in it. She wrote her name in big black permanent marker on the inside of the purse. So that is when my rage just turned into defeat because the purse became worthless to me, hence my getting emotional.

4.) For people questioning on why react now when I had to have known about him not giving gifts from early on in the relationship- after attending family events with him I noticed right away he never had a gift to give. So when it came to my birthday or Valentine’s Day or any special occasion I would take initiative to drive us to wherever I wanted my gift from so he could purchase it. As we got more serious my gifts became trips that I planned and he paid for. So this wasn’t going to be my first time getting a gift but it was going to be my first time having an actual gift under the tree.

5.) I introduced one of my really good friends to his brother and she is now my sister-in-law in and my ally and my source. We met for lunch a week after the New Year to exchange gifts. She informed me that after they arrived at his Moms my husband didn’t want to talk about what happened. My stepdaughter likes to show off her gifts as most teenagers do, and while they were gathered on the table, trying to talk to my husband she approached and was interrupting and trying to get everyone’s attention on her and her new purse and other gifts. SIL said the table fell silent and there were looks between family members and then chaos. Yelling about how my husband arrived empty-handed &aunts and uncles were yelling at him asking how he could get his daughter such an expensive purse and not get his mother anything. That’s when he broke and loudly responded, he didn’t get his daughter the purse. He got me the purse. His daughter just took the purse. His daughter got upset for being outed and reprimanded by other family members and called her mom to get her.

6.) By the time her mother arrived I had already spoken to her about what happened. She went inside to talk to her father because the story she was getting from her daughter was obviously different. It was basically the same story, he took her shopping and on the way back she saw the department store bag and looked inside and saw the purse started begging for it then started to guilt trip him to give it to her. He told her no and spoke to her about being ungrateful and selfish. She then tried to get him to take her to a friends house instead of home which caused another argument because she is grounded due to failing classes and she knows that she’s not allowed to go anywhere. At drop off she just grabbed her bags and exited the car &slamming the door. When he got back to the house, he reached behind the seat to get the bag and noticed it was empty and realized she took the purse anyway. He called her but she didn’t answer and he left a message that she better be ready to give up the purse on Christmas.

7.) Her mother had called him and yelled at him for getting her such an expensive purse when she is failing classes and instead of explaining what happened he just responded that she had no idea what she was talking about and hung up the phone. Her writing her name in the purse was a shock to him and that’s what caused him to pull over at the next gas station. He didn’t want me more upset with her so he opted not to tell me that she stole it and just took blame.

8.)  the other gift that he was going to put in the purse- lingerie. It was in a small gift bag on my side of the bed. He was upset when I sent our pitbull Chico downstairs wearing a red nightie.

*Some comments had the misconception that the purse was going to be the first gift he ever gave me and I wanted to clarify that is not true. I posted about him not getting me a gift on my Birthday and Christmas and other occasions. This occurred our first year of marriage.

I planned a dinner for my birthday that included my parents & my siblings, close friends and family. My husband arrived empty handed &over an hour and a half late due to him staying late at work. I kept quiet because I didn’t want a scene and have more attention drawn to him about not getting me anything and being so late. This is same reason I cut him off when he looked around at my gifts and flowers from my guest and started saying “man I feel so bad for not getting you…..” That weekend I woke up to flowers and chocolates sprinkled all over the bed and being taken to breakfast and my husband asking what I still had on my wishlist for my birthday so we could go get it.

On our 1st anniversary I set up a table outside with candles and hung up white lights and was preparing beef Wellington and had a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries. That morning I woke him up saying Happy Anniversary and kissing him and told him I have a surprise planned for later. He called me when he should have already been home stating that he picked up an extra load and was excited about how much extra the pay was going to be. We used the extra pay from this and from other extra loads he picked up that coincidentally coincided with special occasions and Holidays to go to Hawaii. It wasn’t until I stopped planning something for him for Father’s Day that he started making an effort on getting gifts ahead of time and remembering special occasions.

When my husband got home from being on the road he took my son and I to eat at a steakhouse and handed each of us a gift bag. Inside were brand new air pods. At first my son was confused because he didn’t have an I phone then came the second surprise- that after we finished eating we were heading to AT&T to get both us new phones. I haven’t really spoken to his daughter but was told that her failing classes and sneaking out has caused a strain on her relationship with her mother. 

I am not looking for pity or sympathy and I am not a doormat and my husband is not a heartless monster. I am in a much better frame of mind now than I was then. Thank you for taking the time to hear me.

**Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** So after all that... . Does the thieving little madam still have the purse? Because if so, what lesson has she learnt? Nothing . Nada.

**Commenter 2:** I'd have taken scissors to it. There is no way she would still have it.

**Commenter 3:** Did he get you another purse? IDK about his ""makeup"" gift. Was that really what you wanted?

**Commenter 4:** Sorry, but we have to agree to disagree. You are a doormat and until that changes you will ever be a doormat.

**Commenter 5:** So basically she's a thief, and you’re all enabling her.

The park was always quiet at night, but that’s why quanta went there. The shadows of oak trees stretched like skeletal fingers under the moonlight, and the crunch of dried leaves beneath her boots echoed as she walked. She’d come to clear her head—to escape the claustrophobia of her cubicle job, her unanswered texts, the voicemails from her mother she kept avoiding. But tonight, the silence felt different. Heavier.

She didn’t hear the footsteps until the cloth soaked with chemicals clamped over her mouth.

When she woke, her wrists and ankles were bound by cold iron chains, bolted to a concrete floor. The room was windowless, lit only by a flickering fluorescent bulb. The air smelled of mildew and something bitter—coffee. A single mug sat steaming on a stool nearby. Her kidnapper had left no note, no demands. Just the drink.

He visited twice a day, always in that black hoodie and a mask that looked like it was made of shadow. He never spoke. He’d refill the mug, check the chains, and leave. Lena screamed, begged, threatened, but he moved like a ghost, indifferent to her rage. When she refused the coffee, thirst clawed at her throat until she gave in. The caffeine kept her awake, hyper-alert to every creak of the building, every distant drip of water. It felt like a cruel joke.

By the second day, her legs had numbed into dead weight. Her mind began to unravel. She hallucinated voices: her boss criticizing her work, her mother pleading, a childhood friend laughing. The chains chafed her skin raw, but the pain anchored her to reality. When the kidnapper returned, she didn’t fight. She stared at the ceiling and whispered, “Just end it.”

He left without refilling the mug.

The third day blurred into a haze. Her stomach cramped, her tongue swelled, and the room tilted like a ship in a storm. When the door finally creaked open, she couldn’t lift her head. The kidnapper’s gloved hands undid the chains with mechanical precision. He hauled her over his shoulder, her body limp as a ragdoll, and carried her outside.

Cold air slapped her face. They were in a derelict part of the city—rusted factories, skeletal trees clawing at a starless sky. He drove for hours in a van that reeked of gasoline, until pavement gave way to mud, and mud to tangled undergrowth. The jungle swallowed them whole.

He dumped her at the base of a gnarled tree, its roots twisted like serpents. She couldn’t run, couldn’t scream. Her vision swam as he pulled a lighter from his pocket.

“Why?” she croaked, her voice a stranger’s.

For the first time, he hesitated. Then he lit the brush.

Fire erupted in a hungry ring around them. Smoke stung her eyes as flames licked the trees, their embers floating like fireflies. The kidnapper stood perfectly still, watching the inferno. Quanta’s body trembled—not from fear, but from a sudden, feverish clarity. The heat felt alive, purifying. She dragged herself toward the flames, not away.

The last thing she saw was his mask catching the orange glow, the void inside it flickering like a dying star.

Quanta woke in her bed, drenched in sweat, her sheets tangled like chains. Dawn seeped through her curtains. The smell of smoke clung to her hair.

On her nightstand sat a mug of cold coffee.

(The correct answer is no but someone give me a reality check),"Okay I 24(f) met this 31(m) we will call J. He has 2 kids (5b & 2g) and from what I was told initially, he had just ended things with the children’s mom. You can already guess how this story will go ugh. 

Anyways I predominantly date women but this man just so happened to catch my eye while I was working my side job. I work at a coffee stand I swear the moment we met it was like a omg I’m in love and this is my person, idk how to explain but the eye contact got me. He gets his coffee and forgets his card leading him to come back and actually get another coffee later in the day, I express how it’s my side job and I’m leaving soon to focus on my business just as quick conversation while he’s in the drive thru. He carries on and it’s just that until he comes to the cafe again exclaiming how he needs my info incase he never sees me again. I’m love struck and interested so I give him my info and we talk and meet for random dates for 3 months. 
We literally talked everyday. And saw each other when our schedules worked with one another. I eventually meet his kids and things are taken to a next level of sleep overs. 

At this point in time we can’t keep our hands off each other and really have great communication and love all around. EXCEPT I never really asked much when it came to the BM. I come from a divorced family and know it’s possible to move on and keep relationships with the women you made kids with, in good standing. I assumed that’s what it was. 
Well moving on…one day while the kids are with the mom who supposedly lives 45 mins away, j is at work and asked if I wanted to meet at the house for lunch. I head there, meet him, and all was good for about 20 mins till his phone is getting blown up by the BM and he takes a second to answer, I go to the bathroom to collect my thoughts, then afterwards he comes to me saying she saw my car outside. I don’t know what that means exactly but I didn’t ask for clarity and just walked out. 

He called on my drive home asking what happened and I expressed that I feel there’s more to their situation then he led on to me because when you aren’t with someone anymore they don’t usually blow you up asking why a different car is there. He then says that he hasn’t told her because he’s worried he’d take the kids or get him with child support. My issue wasn’t that she doesn’t know he’s dating again but more that fact that she feels comfortable or in a position to drive by and call him out. That’s concerning. Leading me to believe that he’s leading her on or that he has put her in situation to think they would work things out. Either way he lacked transparency and that’s what really hurt me most. 

Later that day he’s trying to message but I’m still in my head going back and forth, the following day I message him telling him I’m not longer confident in our connection and I won’t be pursuing it any further due to what I mentioned above. I said it’s obvious he has more to work on with his family and I’m not here to interrupt or be apart of something I truly shouldn’t. He responds saying he understands and wishes his situation was more concrete before meeting me and that despite everything I really was a light in his life blah blah. After that I’m blocked on all social media. And haven’t talked since. 


Now it’s been 2 months and we still haven’t talked, I think about him all the time and I wonder how he is , how life is going , work, his family, etc. sadly my route home involves passing his house, we live so close and it’s so hard not to want to pull over and just check in. I never see the BM there though and my delusion has led me to believe that maybe things could’ve been different. I also caught him driving past my house the other night at 1:30am and everything is just eating me up. Idk if it’s mutual or if delusion, toxic love, or all the above. 

I want to message him so bad just to know if it’s even mutual , all my friends are saying no don’t do it , respecting yourself is worth so much more which is true, but it’s hard. I fell in love fast and got hurt even faster. Could any good even come from trying to reach out? I’m not blocked on message just instagram :/

(I had all day to day decision making going back to when he moved with his gf.) I still don’t really know why she left and never came back. I saw her twice but communicated consistently via text for the first couple of months. It gradually lessened. She has a court appointed lawyer who insisted on regular time with me. The one attempt I made she thwarted. More likely her father did but whatever. I backed away and didn’t request anymore time with her.  I figured backing off would be the opposite of what her father wanted / expected. I hoped it would calm things for her. We started texting again n the fall. It was going well, but then I found out she wanted some things from my home. I gave them to her immediately. Asked her if she was playing me. Denied. But she went silent again. Started texting again, then it came up she wanted something else from me. I communicated to her that it seems like she wants me in her life on her terms and that it’s troubling to me that when she lived with me she had unfettered access to her father. But since moving in with him she has never phoned me. I’ve seen her maybe a dozen hours since she left. Well fast forward to Christmas, my mother dropped gifts off for me at her dad’s place for convenience sake (long story). My daughter emails me to say she has the gifts, she misses and loves me, and maybe we can hang out. We set up plans. I do not get my hopes up in the least. We went for hot chocolate at a local coffee shop. We talk for 2 hours. It’s awkward but not too bad. I ask her on the way back home if she wants me to initiate plans or if she wants me to let her do it. She says she wants me to initiate plans. Ok. A few days go by and I message her wondering if she has free time in the coming weeks. I also suggest messaging and voice calls on IG. (I’ve changed my # due to all the texts her father would send, as well as several other reasons. I do not want to give her my # b/c it’ll end up with my ex, and I do not want him to have my #) 2 weeks go by and no response from her. This confirms my suspicion that she was pressured to meet me. By my mom because she likes to get over involved in situations and by her father wanting the gifts out of his house. 

So I emailed her today……I said given everything that has happened I can’t interpret anything other than that there’s no room in her life for me right now. I say I’m backing off and leaving it up to her to reach out when she’s up for it. I was loving in my response choosing my words carefully so as to not guilt her or make her feel bad. It was me outlining a boundary. It seems to me she’s taken a page out of her dad’s book and is starting to treat me the same way he treats me. As much as I love my child, I am not so sad and desperate to have her in my life that I will accept being used, & manipulated and treated like a doormat.

I’ll be going to court soon as her father made a child support application. I definitely need the courts intervention to assist to make any progress if there is any hope left for progress to be made. 

I made the wrong choice in partner and my child will forever be messed up because of it. This is a really hard pill to swallow 😢Absolutely heartbreaking💔💔",5,1738817106.0,ParentalAlienation,6,1.0,False

 My world narrows until the only thing left  is the price tag, the warmth from the flickering screen, the shifting text, and my name. Korynn Wallace. And beneath it, in bold black letters: LOW STOCK.

I can’t move. I can’t think. There’s something fundamentally wrong about seeing my own name printed there—like I’m not a person, just an item waiting to be pulled from the shelf.

The intercom crackles, a slow hiss that coils in my ears.

“Aisle associate Korynn please make your way to the Employee Lounge.”

My stomach plummets as the floor shifts dramatically, and throws me off balance. I try to resist it, but the Store doesn’t care what I want. My boots lose traction. My body lurches forward, weight pulling me down like I’ve stepped onto the edge of a slide I didn’t know was there.

I throw my hands out, reaching for anything—the floor, the base of a shelf, a loose product—but it’s useless. The ground is too smooth, the tiles too slick beneath my fingertips. I slam against a metal shelf, fingers clawing at the edge, but it tilts with me, the products shifting, sliding, tumbling past me in a slow-motion avalanche. A box clips my shoulder.

I try to grab anything. My nails scrape against the tile. The friction rips at them. Something sharp splits the edge of my thumb. A flare of pain. I feel the sticky warmth of blood. Still, I scramble, dig, claw, but the Store isn’t letting me stop. It wants me to go forward. Toward him. I slam into the Manager. I choke on a breath as I stumble back to my feet, the shock of it knocking the panic loose. The Manager doesn’t flinch.He doesn’t even acknowledge that I just crashed into him. 

The Store stops tilting. The floor settles. The movement ceases. I stand there, panting, heart hammering. Blood wells from the split edge of my nail. My fingers sting. I stumble back from the Manager, gasping, my balance still unsteady, my fingers burning from the futile attempt to claw onto something—anything.

But as my breath rattles in my throat, as the blood from my broken nail drips onto the tile, I realize— The Store has changed again. The shelves are gone. The aisles have disappeared. I am somewhere else. A hallway. And I know this hallway. Even before my brain fully registers where I am, I feel my muscles clench.

The words rip out of my mouth before my brain can even catch up. 

**""No! No, no, no—Not here. Not here. Please, anywhere but here!""**

I’ve seen this place before, but only in glimpses—from a distance, in the gaps between shifting aisles. Once, when I was running from a fight near the Iron Fang’s territory, I turned a corner and saw it.

A long, windowless corridor, lined with more  fluorescent lights. It’s too clean, too perfect. It didn’t look like it belonged in the store at all. I ran the other way. Everyone did. The factions don’t talk about it much, but when they do, they call it the Employee Lounge. No one who goes in has ever come back.

And now, I’m the one stepping inside. 

The hallway ends abruptly. One moment, I’m being led through the impossible corridor. The next, the Manager in front of me steps aside, and I am somewhere else.

The Employee Lounge. I don’t step in. I don’t want to. But the Manager doesn’t force me, it doesn’t need to. Because as I blink and take in my surroundings - I see the door that was just in front of me has already closed behind me.

I take a breath and I regret it immediately. The air is thick and stale. Not like the rest of the Store. The Lounge is sealed. Preserved. Like no air has moved in years. I get the strange feeling that  no one ever really breathes here.

There is furniture. Chairs. A seemingly cheap plastic couch. A table with old magazines whose pages are blank. A vending machine glows softly in the corner. Perfectly stocked. But something about it makes my skin crawl. Everything feels off, even the the coffee brewing in the corner.  I don’t know why, until I realize—The vending machine should be whirring, the coffee should be making a sound with each drip into the pot. I wait, but sound never comes. Then i realized something else - the coffee never finishes brewing. The pot is half full. But it never fills more than that. It just keeps going. 

I turn my gaze away from the pot, trying not to think about it. Then, I see them. I see people. They’re sitting at the tables, still, silent, staring at the TV. They aren’t moving or blinking. They aren’t bound or restrained. But they don’t try to leave. They just… sit. Their faces are expressionless. Their eyes fixed forward as if they’ve forgotten how to move.

Something churns in my gut. My chest tightens. I don’t know what I expected—something violent, something immediate. But I think this is worse. The Manager moves toward the center of the room. It doesn’t look at the others because they are exactly where they should be. Instead, it turns toward me. And sits. He just sits down, like this is just a breakroom, like we are just in the middle of an interview, like this is simply another day.

And then it gestures to me in a  slow, deliberate movement. His hand, palm up toward the seat across from him. He’s telling me to sit. I don’t move. I won’t.

The Manager tilts its head—a fraction too far. A burst of static, shrieks overhead,  my pulse slams against my neck, my heart beating wildly in its cage. Then I hear a voice.

“Thank you for joining us”

My body locks up. The Manager’s mouth doesn’t move. But it keeps gesturing. Like it’s the one speaking. But it isn’t, the intercom is. The words are perfectly clear, perfectly calm. Like something isn’t just saying them—it’s reading them.

The Manager tilts its head again, motions toward the chair across from it. The intercom speaks again.

“We are delighted you've joined us.”

I swallow. My mouth is dry. Then the vending machine hums, shortly after another  sudden noise makes my breath catch in my throat. I hear a soft clunk as something drops into the tray. My fingers twitch at my sides. I know better than to check. I know whatever’s inside isn’t something I want.

The intercom crackles.

“Collect your uniform.”

I glance at the Manager. It hasn’t moved, but its hand has shifted, gesturing toward the vending machine.

Again, the intercom repeats itself, like a mother correcting  a child who has been misbehaving.

“Collect your uniform.”

I force myself forward. My boots echo loud against the carpet. The vending machine buzzes softly. The buttons are blank. I crouch. My fingers hover over the tray. I hesitate. I pull it out slowly, carefully. It’s neatly folded. Pressed. Clean. A blue vest with a logo that reads Pinnacle Hardware.

And pinned to the front—My name tag.

KORYNN WALLACE

Like it’s always been mine. My breath shudders. The intercom crackles again.

“Proceed to the viewing area.”

I look up.

The Manager is waiting. And  beyond it—There are rows of chairs, sat in them are people staring at the screen. The TV flickers. The training video is about to begin.

A moment of static, then a corporate jingle plays—soft, generic, and friendly.

“Welcome to Pinnacle Hardware! Where quality and service never run out.” 

The screen fades in. A man in a neat blue vest stands in front of a fully stocked shelf, holding a clipboard. He has brown hair, parted to the side,one side of his face stretched slightly further then the other and pressed on his face is a smile.

“Hello, and welcome to the team!”

His voice is surprisingly cheerful and warm. I barely register his  words because my gaze is locked on the people watching.

They sit in perfect rows, unmoving, eyes locked on the screen. And in the middle of them—Liam

He went missing three days ago. And now he’s here. Wearing a blue vest. There’s no name on his nametag . His face is blank. But his eyes are open.

I inhale sharply, a sound that seems to scream in the dead silence of the room. The video continues.

“At Pinnacle Hardware, we value hard work, dedication, and customer satisfaction.”

A slogan flashes across the screen:

CUSTOMER SATISFACTION IS TOP PRIORITY.

For a second—no, it was less than a second, it was just a moment—I saw the screen distort. The words change and before I even finish blinking they’re back to normal.

My heartbeat pounds in my ears. The host is still talking, but the words don’t feel like they matter anymore. Because something is wrong with the sound.

Under the cheerful voice, there’s something else. Something faint. A whisper, a second voice, buried beneath the music. I strain to hear it. The TV glitches again. The smiling man’s mouth moves, but the words don’t match.

The whispering grows. A voice. Not from the intercom. Not from the video. A real voice. Speaking my name.

“…Korynn.”

I freeze. The screen flickers violently. The music distorts. The man’s face warps. And the voice—The voice is right behind me.

# Welcome to the Future of Finance 🌟

Picture this: You're strolling down the street, sipping your overpriced oat milk latte, when suddenly you spot a Bitcoin ATM. Boom! The future is here. But wait, how does it work? And what does it have to do with QR codes? Buckle up, because we're diving into the world of Bitcoin ATMs and why our **Bitcoin QR Code Maker App** (🔗 [https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com)) is the secret sauce to making your crypto life a breeze.

# What is a Bitcoin ATM? 🏧

A Bitcoin ATM (or BTM for the cool kids) is a machine that lets you buy or sell Bitcoin using cash or a debit card. Think of it like a regular ATM, but instead of spitting out crumpled $20 bills, it gives you digital gold.

There are two types of Bitcoin ATMs:

1. **Buy-Only ATMs** – You insert cash, scan your wallet, and get Bitcoin sent directly to you.
2. **Two-Way ATMs** – These let you both buy and sell Bitcoin, turning your digital assets into cold, hard cash.

But here’s the catch: The process often requires scanning a **QR code**. And that’s where our app comes in.

# Why QR Codes Are the MVP of Bitcoin ATMs 🏆

If Bitcoin ATMs are the car, QR codes are the fuel. Without them, you’re stuck manually entering long, confusing wallet addresses that look like a WiFi password on steroids. One typo and poof—your Bitcoin is lost in the blockchain abyss.

That’s why every smart Bitcoiner uses a QR code to send or receive crypto. And our **Bitcoin QR Code Maker App** is the easiest way to generate one in seconds!

# How Our Bitcoin QR Code Maker App Saves the Day 🤖

Using a Bitcoin ATM should be easy. But if you’ve ever fumbled with a tiny keyboard, trying to type out a 34-character Bitcoin address, you know the struggle is real.

Here’s how our app makes it effortless:

1. **Instant QR Code Generation** – Just enter your Bitcoin wallet address, and boom—your QR code is ready to scan.
2. **No Typos, No Stress** – QR codes eliminate human error, making transactions fast and accurate.
3. **Works with Any Wallet** – Whether you're using Coinbase, Electrum, or a hardware wallet, our app has you covered.
4. **Secure & Private** – Your wallet address stays yours; we don’t store or track anything.
5. **Mobile-Friendly** – Generate QR codes from your phone, so you’re always ATM-ready.

# Using a Bitcoin ATM Like a Pro 💪

Ready to flex your Bitcoin ATM skills? Here’s a quick step-by-step guide:

# Buying Bitcoin

1. Find a Bitcoin ATM near you.
2. Select “Buy Bitcoin.”
3. Enter how much Bitcoin you want.
4. **Open our Bitcoin QR Code Maker App** and generate a QR code for your wallet.
5. Scan your QR code at the ATM.
6. Insert cash, confirm the transaction, and receive Bitcoin instantly.

# Selling Bitcoin for Cash

1. Find a **two-way** Bitcoin ATM.
2. Select “Sell Bitcoin.”
3. Enter how much you want to sell.
4. The ATM gives you a QR code to send Bitcoin to.
5. Use your wallet to scan the ATM’s QR code and send the Bitcoin.
6. Once confirmed, the ATM dispenses cash.

# Bitcoin ATMs & QR Codes: A Match Made in Crypto Heaven 🌟

Imagine trying to withdraw cash from an ATM without a debit card. Annoying, right? Well, using a Bitcoin ATM without a QR code is just as frustrating. That’s why our app is the ultimate sidekick to your Bitcoin adventures.

Instead of scrambling to type your wallet address at the ATM, just pull up our app, generate your QR code, and scan it in seconds. **Easy, fast, secure.**

# Where to Find Bitcoin ATMs 🏰

There are over 40,000 Bitcoin ATMs worldwide, and new ones are popping up every day. You can find them in:

* Gas stations
* Shopping malls
* Convenience stores
* Airports
* Crypto-friendly coffee shops (yes, they exist!)

Use websites like **CoinATMRadar** to locate one near you.

# The Future of Bitcoin ATMs & QR Codes 🌟🔎

Bitcoin ATMs are getting smarter, faster, and more accessible. Soon, we might see:

* Lower fees (finally!)
* Multi-crypto support (ETH, DOGE, and beyond)
* Biometric verification (scan your face, not just your QR code!)
* Direct bank transfers (bye-bye cash)

And guess what? QR codes will remain at the heart of it all. That’s why having a **Bitcoin QR Code Maker App** is like having a superpower in your pocket.

# Final Thoughts: Make Every Bitcoin ATM Transaction Effortless!

If you’re diving into the world of Bitcoin ATMs, make sure you’re equipped with the right tools. Our **Bitcoin QR Code Maker App** takes the hassle out of the process, so you can focus on what matters: stacking sats and enjoying the ride.

Try it out today at [https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com) and make your next Bitcoin ATM visit smooth as butter.

How much time do I let pass before reaching out?,"I ‘21M’ had dated ‘19F’ for about a month after meeting on a dating app. To skip all the dates and messaging I’ll just sum it all up as briefly as possible. 

We talked for about a week before meeting at a sports event, the night went great and on her drive home she said she wished it didn’t end so fast. We continue texting during the week where we opened up a lot to each other and at one point both had to hold back saying too much too soon. We had another date the following Friday that went really well. We had coffee and talked on the beach for several hours until the sun set. By the end we were trying to find excuses to not leave each other. The next day I spent most of the day with her and her family at another sports event. Then two days later we had another date but we just spent the day at her apartment watching movies and cuddling since it was her chore day and had to take care of things through the day. Just a chill day that went well. At the end she said she could tell I was wanting a little more than just a hug goodbye but she wanted to save it for a romantic date so if things kept going well, we’d have a good story to tell our kids since we had met on a dating app. 

The days following I could tell she was drawn back so I spent a few days trying to reassure her she can open up to me. She lets me know that she got out of a two year long relationship that she ended just a couple days before we matched and she wanted to take things slow in which I agree to go at whatever speed she’s comfortable at. She lets me know her ex wasn’t a great guy and she basically had to beg for love from him. Following that talk, I could tell she was still drawn back so I ask if there’s anything I can do, whether that’s some space or anything. She says I just need to see you again so I plan to come up the next day and she planned for me to stay the night. 

Following that night she doesn’t text me much through the day which was odd so I ask if everything’s okay. She responds saying she’s really sorry and that she didn’t think this through and that adding me to the mix so early was a bad idea and it was negatively affecting her. She says she needs some space and time to heal from that before getting into anything even remotely resembling a relationship and that she’s sorry for wasting my time. I let her know it wasn’t a waste of time and that if she ever needs anything I’m just one call away. I say that I hope there’s something down the road for us and I’ll still be thinking of her and we haven’t talked since. Today’s only the fourth day for time reference. 

Despite what most people will say I’m not going to just forget about her and move on because I know what we had was real and meaningful. I hope with time we will come back to each other but I’m just curious how long I should wait before reaching out to her again. I’m mot just sitting around being sad about it and I’m trying to work on myself as well. I was thinking a month so she has some space and time to think and heal but I’m not even sure how long I should wait anymore. Feel free to ask any questions and I will go more into detail.

My problem is, I'm really getting hung up on the drinking aspect. Yes, I know, it's a bar. But there aren't many other venues that offer the type of social aspect that bars do.

I guess my question is, should I go solo to bars, get a soda, and tip the bartender, and just not drink? Or should I look into things like coffee shops or something else for socializing?",5,1738816915.0,socialskills,13,0.86,False

Patti, Angela, Emma and Nikki are high school seniors and best friends preparing for life beyond graduation. Their dreams for the future differ greatly – Angela wants to become a poet, Emma and Nikki have are heading for college, and Patti is a young mother looking for stability in her kid’s life – but the four bright, young women are steadfastly loyal to each other in a way only teenagers know how to be. Their lives are then completely upended when, after being sexually assaulted, Nikki unexpectedly commits suicide. Grieving, angry and forced to return to daily life without satisfying recourse for their feelings, the girls must come of age with a newfound understanding about the patriarchal world in which they live. Led by Lili Taylor, Bruklin Harris, Anna Grace and recent Academy Award-nominee Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor (KING RICHARD), the 1996 award-winning Sundance indie was co-written by the actors in collaboration with first-time filmmaker Jim McKay, lending “a welcome little gust of teen-age realism” (The New York Times) to the film’s coming-of-age narrative. One of the first films of its kind to frankly address sexual violence as women experience it, GIRLS TOWN continues to be relevant in a post-#MeToo world. An energetic, all-female soundtrack featuring 1990s musical icons Queen Latifah, PJ Harvey, Roxanne Shante, Salt-N-Pepa and others underscore the films timeless message of empowerment **(**[**tickets**](https://www.guildcinema.com/event-details/girls-town-2025-02-08-13-00)**)**

We have a family of 8 +2 infants (under 1) visiting in March. I'm trying to get a gauge on restaurants and bars that are family friendly, or at least kiddo tolerant. I do plan to call ahead to all places to make reservations and confirm they are good with kids. We're just looking for some options to have a few things on the itinerary! 

Our family has a WIDE range of preferences (price, taste, vibe, etc) so we can easily split up or leave kiddos with family at the hotel. 

Here's what I have bookmarked already: 

Food:

* Farm (reservation required)
* Brandini Toffee 
* Lola Rose (mediterranean) 
* Bar Cecil (reservation required)
* Peninsula Pastries PalmSprings (French pastries)
* Date Shake (a milkshake made from dates… yum!)

\
We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1iiuawo,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1iiuawo/lsat_masters_maybe_just_a_diploma_technical/,LSAT? Masters? Maybe just a Diploma? Technical School? None?,"The title is the basis of what I have been asking myself since finishing my undergraduate degree in December, and putting my notice in for my vape store associate position (yet again) the same month. Below is my basic history and why i'm at where i'm at, and i'll do a TLDR if I can manage to fit it all in to a couple sentences.

Plainly, my BA with a major in law and society does not feel valuable to me right now, and that is gut wrenching after having just done it for 4 years and spending tens of thousands of my families money, my own money, and money I don't have to live and study during that time. I rented at 2 different places across the 4 years and have been moved out of my mum and dads since I was 17, so I could not save on food and shelter because they just physically have very little space. I've worked at multiple positions, but predominantly at a vape store which is a disaster (in my humble opinion) and I put in my notice yet again because I could not stand to deal with the people and environment anymore. Every time I have had a job, I do really well within the position i'm given but have no way to move up in the company structure, or if I did, would rather not do so because it  wasn't geared towards my established goal of being a lawyer. HOWEVER....

Now I don't want to be a lawyer, and that's scaring the crap out of me and causing people around me to look at me with a disappointment that's difficult to handle. I said I wanted to change the world for the better, and I do. Lawyers don't often have the chance to do that. Every single course I took regarding law boiled down to ""we are working off precedent, changing that precedent is extremely difficult but necessary. Also, here is how every government, but especially the most powerful colonial ones, easily manipulate or ignore the law and torture, deport, and kill people without ramifications, because of said precedents."" 

So why would I pay $300 CAD for the LSAT and stress myself out over the score, and risk cancelling out a better one of two or three scores? If I do well enough to even get accepted to grad programs, why fork out the $40,000 CAD A YEAR to a school that I know does not produce more than maybe two grads who can actually change things for the better? And who would likely be using their education and stability to benefit what put them there in the first place, mainly ""strategic tax planning"" and the explicit avoidance of laws? I would not be one of them, despite still being extremely privileged and having people constantly heap resources on me. 

I've spoken to numerous advisors at technical schools like CDI, Robertson, Reeves, and Bow Valley, (im in Canada) and i'm struggling to justify spending money on legal assistant programs at these either. The advisors are sympathetic and kind, multiple have told me their degrees felt like a waste of time at first but proved to be valuable in the long run, they just became accredited in other ways on top of them, like with technical school. But again, what if I shoot out the other side more qualified but miserable? Great, 10 to 20 thousand more dollars for more niche knowledge and a practicum, but still have no guarantee of being hired if i don't network just right and have the actual ability to perform in the field. The thought just does not spark excitement.

I type this from a friend's family home, yet another basement, (i've lived in basement suites of varying luxury for the past 5  years) where I am being given a space to stay for a maximum two months starting February 1st. Any sane landlord will not rent to me with no job/proof of income. I have gotten no responses (ok, three automated rejections) from \~60 job applications over the last month, most of which are for residential cleaners, baristas, and office administrators. I don't super want to do any of those jobs. The only one I want to do at this rate is tree planting in the BC interior, which I just applied for, so fingers crossed I guess. It's one of the few jobs I can think of that gives me the chance to move my body and be in nature, and plainly, allow me to live really cheap and not have to be put together. I could get the physicality and casual aspect from cleaning and coffee shop jobs too though, just not the nature and fulfilment.

Generally, I worry i'm spoiled, or lazy, but I continue to prove to myself I enjoy hard work and go crazy without tasks to fill my time, and it eats at me if i'm not actively helping someone or contributing to the betterment of someone or something. So despite backing up good intentions with good actions and trying to keep myself sane simultaneously, i'm staring down couch surfing for the foreseeable future, about 15k in accumulated debt, and a frustrating lack of focused purpose for one path. And I guess it doesn't help that I feel like more of a radicalised hippie after my undergrad and just want the world to be better than it is, where my movement isn't restricted by dollars.

Extra things to note: no car, no real desire to get one as it is not an asset but a liability to me at this point/I might not even get insured with no job, no ability to take out a personal loan with the state my credit is in, and I will not be asking anyone in my family for money as they have already supported me significantly over the past 4 years of my degree. 

TLDR: I could do more post secondary to have a better chance at a high paying job, but I don't have the passion for my original focus anymore and have not found a new passion/niche. I am currently half a step above homeless, and cannot have a space of my own until i'm working. No hiring managers are getting back to me, and I don't know how to focus my energy more effectively than I already am. 

Any and all advice is appreciated!!!

So this past week coworker 1 has been on vacation.  Now I sometimes join in on harmless jokes about coworker 1, but the others go on and on talking and gossiping about her and her recent marriage, which I think is none of their business to speculate if it will last or not because of her narcissistic personality. Frankly,  I don't care. They gossip and talk of her like she's such a horrible person to work with, yet I don't think she's that bad. I mean she's annoying at times, but I don't usually get as bothered by it. Anyways, what's getting to me is how draining it is to listen to all the gossip and bad mouthing about her. I get along fairly good with my team. I tend to withdraw a little and need my space, too. Lots of strong personalities on team.

1iiu7ao,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatewaytapes/comments/1iiu7ao/another_encounter_with_the_transitioned/,Another encounter with the Transitioned,"
It’s me again.  2 years in.  I have OBE’s as well as lucid dreams regularly.  I’ve spoken in other post about encountering my transitioned daughter and my transitioned boss.  After today I’ve decided to quit using the word “dead”.  I know now that we never die.  It’s no longer a belief.  Something beyond profound happened to me…again. I was doing the hour long Nature Awakens in the Expand app.  I’d finished the 6th module a while back and that’s where I had encounters with the two other people that I know that are no longer here.  It shook me badly enough that I quit going further but didn’t stop.  I actually started over.  Since then I’ve had two more encounter with my daughter, in the last one she took my face in her hands and gently kissed me and then just vanished to mist.  Since then the overwhelming feeling of loss concerning her left me and has not returned.  I’ve had an incredibly vivid dream I was in some kind of processing station and my old boss was there.  We were being scanned, for what I don’t know but they took me out claiming that, “my bag was almost empty..” I’m still wondering what they meant and who “they” even were. I remember Mickey my old boss just shrugging and smiling sheepishly at me as I was led out and down a long corridor right before I woke up. He wasn’t entirely sure what was going on either.

Tonight while meditating I began to see everyone I knew.  Like from people I don’t particularly care for all the way to my partner Katie. And I began to vibrate.  I could feel my hands and feet go numb as has become my norm, indicating separation was close.  I saw us all connected like everyone was all just one person.  I don’t know how else to describe it, it has become exceedingly difficult to describe the indescribable. I could feel my entire second body vibrating and I could feel my eyes going haywire behind my eyelids, indicating I was in a dream state but I was fully conscious and aware.  Aware is a bad word for it I was everyone and everywhere.  Anyways, I digress, I started thinking about that boy J.P. that had died while the podcast the Telepathy Tapes was being made.  I’ve been trying to access the hill.  When he had come back to visit his friends his message was, “Make your whole life about love…” I asked how to do that…

A while back while in jail, yes I’ve been to jail, more than once. A man I called Mr Webster was brought in.  He was in his late 70s and had absolutely no business being in jail.  He could not bathe himself, would not have eaten had someone not gotten a tray for him, would sometimes shit his pants on accident and would regularly go into the wrong cell to try and sleep.  He was a hot fucking mess and helpless.  I began to take care of him. I’d bathe that old bastard, make sure he ate, shared my commissary with him, made sure he got in the right bed at night, brought him coffee and helped keep his area clean.  When it became apparent I wasn’t gonna stop some of the other men began to help me. We’d split shower duty and make sure he ate.  I’d wash his clothes when he soiled himself.  I couldn’t fathom being in his shoes and I felt an incredible amount of pity for him.  He was a long term parolee who had let his ankle monitor go dead and they revoked him for it.  He let me go through all his legal paperwork.  He’d been sentenced to 65 yrs for a rape when he was only 23.  He’d spent over 50yrs incarcerated.  I kept it to myself and continued to help him, for no other reason than I knew if other men found out they would have probably starved him by taking his food saying he deserved it. He could not defend himself whatsoever. After a few months parole decided to reinstate him.  I had jokingly told someone that my whole purpose for being there was to look after him and that if he left I would soon be following. I left just a couple weeks later charges completely and rightfully dismissed.  

I heard him tonight clear as day, “Hey man, it’s Mr Webster, thank you for all your acts of kindness, they have not gone unnoticed.  I am finally free.” Then I saw like a piece of parchment or something similar and on it read “Blessed is the creator who has prepared my hands for war and has still found me worthy of carrying a heart as soft as a lotus petal and overflowing with love.” I sat up and had to think long and hard about his actual name.  It came to me and I googled him.  My third hit was his obituary with a pic, he left less than 3 months ago.  I had not thought about him in years, someone I had essentially forgotten about. That shit made me straight up cry.  This transformation is the most humbling thing I have ever experienced.  I’m never going to die.

I really thought he was going to ask me out. He smiles at me and even licks his lips when he talks to me! I swear he's flirting but then I'm thinking I'm just reading into it too much. 

I even joked with him about him asking me out to coffee, but he then he said, ""no."" He definitely doesn't like me in that way. But, I'm delusional in thinking he does. 

Tonight I cried because I thought that we actually had amazing chemistry. But, I guess we're just not compatible. 

Plus, he admitted that he has asked out girls last semester from our university because he thought they were beautiful. If he was attracted to me, he would have asked me out. I get it. It just sucks.
