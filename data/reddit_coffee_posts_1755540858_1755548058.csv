And then with the flattest voice ever, snapped “those ARE mediums.”

Now here’s the thing: you are likely right. I don’t work there and you do. But even if a customer asks a dumbass question, it’s your JOB as a customer service worker to handle that with grace.

The topography down there was incredible. Seemed like there were beautiful views around every corner, along with quirky, interesting sites and a lot of history.

The rain came down in a soft, steady mist, soaking the cemetery lawn of Pineville Baptist Church. The rows of black umbrellas gathered like wilted flowers around Casey Delaney’s grave.

Nathan adjusted his coat collar as he stood beside the grave, watching the casket descend into the earth. The preacher mumbled words Nathan didn’t really hear. It was all background noise—the steady thump of rain drops on umbrellas, the shifting of wet shoes on grass, the soft sobs of loved ones not ready to say goodbye.

Casey Delaney was gone.

It had been a car accident. Your classic freak one. A deer darted out in the dark. Casey swerved, hit a tree. Killed instantly, they said. No pain. Just… gone.

Still didn’t seem real.

Nathan hadn’t seen Casey in nearly three years, but somehow, he’d always assumed they’d cross paths again. Probably at some dive bar or a trailhead somewhere, Casey with that same half-grin and sunburnt face, talking about sleeping under the stars and boiling coffee in a tin mug. 

Luis arrived just as the last words were said, hood pulled low, sneakers squelching in the mud. He nodded at Nathan, but didn’t smile. He looked older, a little heavier, but still carried himself like the class clown who never quite grew up.

“Still can’t believe it,” Luis muttered, voice hoarse.

Nathan shook his head. “Feels like some kind of mistake.”

Luis didn’t answer. They just stood there, side by side watching as the dirt piled onto the casket.

A few minutes later, Travis appeared. He lingered at the edge of the crowd, still as stone, arms folded. He was the only one dressed sharp—pressed slacks, polished boots, a black coat that looked expensive. His hair was slicked back, but his eyes were hidden behind dark aviator glasses.

He didn’t speak. Not then.

The service was short. When it ended, people scattered quick. Small-town funerals always did. Hugs, murmured condolences, then back to life. Pineville didn’t linger on grief. It folded it up neatly and put it away in the back of the closet.

“Guess that’s that,” Luis said, pulling his hood tighter.

“Not yet,” Nathan replied. “His mom invited us over. Said we could go through his room. Take anything we want to remember him by.”

Luis raised an eyebrow. “You sure she meant that? Or was that polite southern code for ‘stay the hell out’?”

Nathan managed a smile. “She meant it.”

They found Travis waiting in the parking lot, leaning on the hood of a dusty sedan. Nathan gave him a look. “You coming?”

Travis didn’t answer right away. But eventually, he nodded. “Yeah. I’ll come.”

The house hadn’t changed. Same cracked porch swing. Same ceramic turtle by the steps where the spare house key was hidden. It smelled like coffee and lemon scented cleaner inside.

Casey’s room was exactly how Nathan remembered it. Maps pinned to the wall. A sleeping bag rolled tight in the corner. Shelves packed with trail guides and camping gear. A box labeled “Don’t Touch” sitting proudly atop the dresser.

Luis wandered in first, whistling low. “Still looks like a damn forest ranger’s office in here.”

Nathan chuckled and picked up a photo from the desk. The four of them, senior year—Nathan, Luis, Travis, and Casey. Mud up to their knees. Grins wide. The Appalachian Trail behind them like some mythic backdrop.

Travis stood near the bookshelf, running a finger along the spines. “He really didn’t change much did he.”

“Nope,” Luis said. “Still chasing the next patch of woods. The never ending hunt for Bigfoot.”

Nathan sat on the bed. “He ever talk to either of you? Toward the end?”

Luis shook his head. “A couple texts. He sent me a picture of a hammock strung between two trees and said, ‘This is the life.’ That was a few months ago.”

Travis was quiet for a moment. “I think he was happy. In his own way.”

They sat there for a while, surrounded by silence and the ghosts of their younger selves.

Then Nathan looked at the map on the wall. One spot was circled in red ink—Whitetail Forest.

“You remember that trip?” he asked.

Luis laughed. “Barely. We got lost. Froze our asses off. Casey thought he saw a bear.”

“Or a ghost,” Nathan said. “He kept talking about going back.”

Travis glanced at the circle. “Then maybe we should.”

Luis turned to him. “You serious?”

“One more trip,” Travis said. “For Casey.”

Nathan nodded. “Yeah. One last camping trip. Just like old times.”


Chapter 2 – Into the Woods

Two weeks later, Nathan pulled into the gravel lot behind Pineville’s only grocery store. The bed of his truck was piled with gear—tents, sleeping bags, a cooler full of beer, and a bundle of firewood tied with baling twine.

Luis was already there, leaning against the hood of his beat-up Jeep, sipping coffee from a Styrofoam cup. His pack sat on the ground beside him, covered in patches from old bands and national parks.

“You actually made it early,” Nathan said, grabbing a cart.

“I figured you’d need help hauling all your overprepared crap.” Luis smirked. “What’d you bring, a satellite phone? Bear spray? Anti-sasquatch measures?”

“Just the basics.” Nathan smiled faintly. “And coffee. Lots of coffee.”

Travis arrived last, pulling up in a clean silver SUV. His gear was brand new—crisp, untouched, tags still on the sleeping pad. Nathan had half-expected him to back out.

Luis let out a sharp whistle, “Look at mister fancy pants. Thought we were camping. Not going on a luxury vacation.”

Travis smirked, “You jealous cause I’m going to be sleeping comfortably while you freeze in a twenty year old sleeping bag?”

They loaded up on the few things they still needed—instant noodles, jerky, trail mix—then stopped at the gas station on the edge of town for ice. The woman behind the counter eyed their packs.

“Y’all heading up into Whitetail?” she asked.

Nathan nodded. “Couple nights. Just a trip for an old friend.”

Her mouth pressed into a thin line. “Not many folks go in that far anymore.”

“Why’s that?” Luis asked.

“Too easy to get lost,” she said. “And you’d be surprised how quiet it gets out there.” She slid their change across the counter and didn’t say another word.

They reached the trailhead by early afternoon. 

A weathered sign marked the start of the Whitetail Forest Loop. They left their vehicles parked there and gathered their gear.

Nathan hoisted his pack and breathed in the pine-scented air. “Still smells the same,” he said.

Luis adjusted his straps. “Yup, like fresh air and wild animal shit. Still looks the same too. Green and endless.”

Travis scanned the trees. “Feels smaller than I remember.”

They hiked for hours, the trail winding up and down through thick hardwoods and mossy gullies. Sunlight filtered through the canopy in shifting gold patches. The air was damp but cool, and the only sounds were the rustle of leaves and the occasional call of a jay.

By late afternoon, they reached the spot Casey had circled on his map—a small clearing beside a narrow creek. The grass was flattened where deer had bedded down, and the water glinted clear and cold.

“This is it,” Nathan said, dropping his pack.
Luis stretched and let out a low whistle. “Man… this takes me back. This is the same exact spot from the last summer before Trav left for that fancy collage.”

Nathan pointed towards a thick oak tree, ""That's the tree you and Casey got drunk and practiced throwing knives at.” 

Travis crouched near the water, trailing his fingers in the current. “I forgot how peaceful it is out here.”

They set up camp with the ease of people who’d done this together before. Nathan handled the tents. Luis built the fire pit. Travis hauled water and laid out dinner.

By dusk, they were sitting around the fire, bowls of chillie and beans steaming in their hands, the sky above turning deep blue.

Luis leaned back on his elbows. “Y’know, I was half-worried this was gonna feel… weird. Like we were trespassing on something. But it’s good. It’s… nice.”

Nathan poked at the fire with a stick. “Casey would’ve loved it.”

They fell into a comfortable silence, watching sparks drift up into the night.

Somewhere out in the dark, a branch snapped.

Travis glanced toward the trees. “Deer?”

“Probably,” Nathan said. He kept his eyes on the fire. “Seen plenty of deer tracks while setting up camp.”

Luis shrugged. “We’re in their living room and didn't invite them to dinner.”

The sound didn’t come again, but Nathan noticed the way the forest seemed to settle—quieter than before. Even the creek’s gurgle felt muted.

By the time they turned in for the night, the fire burned low. Nathan lay in his sleeping bag listening to the stillness outside, his mind drifting back to Casey’s grin, Casey’s voice, Casey’s circled map.

It was the first time in years he’d felt this close to his friend.

Chapter 3 – Night Visitors

The forest was different at night.

Nathan woke to the sound of something moving through camp. Not the light, fluttery rustle of a bird or raccoon, but the deliberate, heavy shuffle of something with weight.

He lay still, listening. The fire had burned down to a bed of coals, glowing faint red through the tent wall. Beyond that—darkness.

A soft clink came from where they’d left the cookware, like something brushing against metal. Then the steady crunch of footsteps moving past his tent.

Nathan held his breath.

Across the clearing, Luis gave a low cough inside his tent. The footsteps paused for a heartbeat, then resumed, slow and deliberate, heading toward the creek.

Nathan waited until the sound faded before unzipping his bag and sitting up. He opened up his tent and popped his head out.

“Luis,” he whispered.

“What?” came the groggy reply.

“You hear that?”

“Yeah. Probably a deer. Go back to sleep.”

But Nathan didn’t. He stayed awake, listening, every creak of the trees and sigh of wind amplified in the dark.

By morning, the unease felt almost silly. Sunlight poured into the clearing, turning the creek into a silver ribbon. Nathan emerged to find Luis already poking at the fire pit, and Travis kneeling near the cookware.

“Anything missing?” Nathan asked.

“Nope,” Travis said. “Everything’s here. Even the jerky.”

Luis stretched. “See? Told you it was just a deer or something. Probably sniffed around and left.”

Nathan wasn’t so sure. He walked the perimeter of camp, scanning the ground. The earth was soft from the rain earlier in the week —perfect for catching tracks—but there was nothing. No hoofprints. No pawprints. Not even a scuff from a boot.

It was as if nothing had been there at all.

He frowned. “You’d think something that big would leave marks.”

Luis smirked. “Maybe it floats. The ghost of Whitetail returns. Oowwooo spooky!”

“Seriously,” Nathan said. “There’s nothing.”

Travis glanced at the ground, his brow furrowing. “That’s… weird.”

They let it drop, but the quiet was heavier after that. Even the jays seemed reluctant to break it.

They spent the day hiking upstream, following the creek into denser woods. Whitetail lived up to its name—three times they spotted deer watching from between the trees, ears twitching, tails flicking.

By late afternoon, they were back at camp, tired but in better spirits. Dinner was simple—beans and rice over the fire, washed down with lukewarm beer from the cooler.

Luis told a story about the time Casey tried to build a makeshift raft out of inner tubes and plywood, nearly drowning himself in the process. They laughed harder than they had in days.

When night fell, Nathan tried to convince himself the sounds from the night before had been nothing. A deer. A stray dog. Something ordinary.

But just before sleep claimed him, he thought he heard it again—those slow, measured steps. 

Not approaching this time, but circling.

And in the morning, they would find something new.

Dawn came pale and cold. Travis was already up, standing by the edge of the clearing. Nathan joined him, rubbing sleep from his eyes.

“Check this out,” Travis said.
In the middle of the path leading back toward the trailhead was a single stick, stripped of bark, standing upright in the dirt. Perfectly balanced.

“Wind do that?” Luis asked when he wandered over.

Nathan shook his head. “Wind doesn’t strip bark clean. Or plant sticks.”

Luis stared at it for a long moment, his smirk gone. “Weird,” he muttered, before heading to stoke the fire.

Nathan kept looking at the stick. It hadn’t been there yesterday. He was sure of it.

He told himself it was nothing. A prank from another hiker. Kids messing around.

But deep down, he knew the truth—someone, or something, had been in their camp again.

Chapter 4 – Wrong Turns

The morning fog clung low over the creek, curling between the trees like smoke. It was the kind of mist that made the forest feel bigger, the distances longer.

Nathan had been the one to suggest hiking to the overlook—Casey’s favorite spot when they camped here as teenagers. The three of them had done the trail more times than he could count. Every bend, every fallen log, every stubborn little stream that cut across the path—it was all familiar.

Or it should have been.

Two hours in, they should have been halfway there. Instead, the trail seemed to twist in ways Nathan didn’t remember.

“Pretty sure we were supposed to hit the fork by now,” Travis said, pausing to adjust his pack.

Luis scanned the trees. “Nah, we just need to keep following the ridge.”

Except Nathan couldn’t see the ridge anymore. The ground had sloped, the trail narrowing between two walls of rock he’d never noticed before.

“You guys remember this?” he asked.

Travis shook his head. “Not at all.”

They pressed on, convinced the next turn would set them right. The forest swallowed the sun, light filtering down in fractured beams. Somewhere above them, a woodpecker tapped steadily, but it was the only sound—no wind, no birdsong.

By noon, they stopped for water.

Luis tried to make it a joke. “Casey would’ve said we’re just making it more of an adventure.”

But Nathan wasn’t smiling. He kept glancing back down the trail, uneasy. The mist from the morning had burned away, but the air still felt… muffled, like they were walking underwater.

“Let’s turn around,” he said finally. “We’ll hit camp and try again tomorrow.”

“Fine by me,” Travis said. “Feels like we’ve been walking in circles anyway.”

Turning around should have been simple—they just needed to retrace their steps.

Only… the path looked different.

The rock walls were gone, replaced by a stretch of flat ground littered with birch trees. 

Nathan stopped dead, heart thudding. “This wasn’t here.”

Luis frowned. “Maybe we cut farther east than we thought.”

They walked for another half hour before coming to a deadfall blocking the trail. The tree was massive, its roots still curled like claws in the dirt.

Travis pointed to the other side. “There’s no trail past this.”

Sure enough, the dirt path they’d been following ended abruptly at the fallen tree, swallowed by ferns and undergrowth.

Luis swore under his breath. “Alright, we’ll bushwhack west. The creek’s that way. Follow it and we’ll hit camp.”

The sun slid lower as they pushed through the brush. Nathan’s arms burned from batting branches aside, and sweat dampened the back of his shirt. Somewhere in the distance, he thought he heard a branch snap.

“Deer,” Luis muttered without looking back.
But Nathan didn’t think so. The sound had been too steady, too intentional, like someone matching their pace from just out of sight.

When they finally stumbled onto a trail again, relief was short-lived.

“This isn’t ours,” Travis said.

The path was narrower, hemmed in by pines so thick they blocked most of the sky. A faint smell of rot hung in the air.

Luis checked his watch. “We need to move. It’ll be dark in a couple hours.”

They followed the trail in tense silence. Nathan kept glancing over his shoulder, catching fleeting movement between the trees—never more than a shadow, gone the moment he focused on it.

By the time they reached a clearing, the light was already fading. Nathan recognized nothing about the place—no creek, no familiar landmarks.

Luis dropped his pack with a frustrated sigh. “Alright. We’ll make camp here and find the way back in the morning.”

Travis looked uneasy. “You think Casey ever got turned around out here?”

Nathan didn’t answer. His eyes were fixed on the treeline.

Something was standing just beyond it.

Too far to make out details. Not moving. Not making a sound.

When he blinked, it was gone.

1mtwxh8,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1mtwxh8/im_struggling/,I'm struggling,"At this point I don't even know if I'm losing it or not. Sometimes events just happen in ways that make me almost sure that there's an outside power tipping the scales against me. I cant win and everything just has to be a battle for some reason.

Four years ago, I packed up my car and drove 2000 miles to a university across the US. I had spent two years at a community college during covid and was absolutely sick of the entire state. So I applied and got accepted to a 4 year. Im now 25, still at the university, now completing a masters in chemistry. 

In late spring 2022 I got arrested and that kind of began my slow spiral down. I hid it from my family, worked my ass off, and it cost me about $5000 dollars to deal with. That wasn't the bad part. The amount of stress that it began to put on me was something I didn't notice until a year later when it was all over. I started losing my hair. My job at the time (while completing my undergraduate) had me working from 4pm to 1am every weekday. My breaking point was my supervisor telling me overtime was mandatory. I couldn't go to school full time and work 50-60 hours on night shift. The summer friends were also a poor choice in hindsight. They caused a lot of drama.  That was a hard week, but I kept going. 

Rolling into 2023 my mother came to visit me in February for her birthday. I was very happy to see her. The night I picked her up at the airport, I was planning to attend a birthday party of a friend. This was probably the first point where I felt the hand on the scales. I was very late and showed up at 1am. A girl I had had a fling with the previous summer was there. We hadn't talked in at least 6 months, and she was wearing the same outfit she wore the last time we slept together. We reconnected and until the sun dawned, were just laying in bed talking at her sorority house. She said she didn't know I was going to be there, but she did, I know she did. I spent that weekend with my mom before she returned and started dating the girl, for real this time. It wasn't a great relationship it didn't last long. No doubt I loved this girl, but I was unsure if I could ever marry her. One night, she asked if I wanted to come over, she got upset that I just wanted to go home and play counter-strike. I ignored her texts and the next day the relationship was over. I had given up. I wasn't willing to fight for it. I wouldn't beg or plead, so we parted. I graduate in the fall and by this point everything began to fall apart. My research had failed and I had gotten no assistance from my principal investigator. So, I left the lab. In the fall semester, I was finishing my last two courses. I started flirting with a newer girl in our courses, call her B. She had a boyfriend at the time, so more just playful than trying to make something happen. A friend of mine knew about it, call her C. C and I had been friends for over a year at this point. We did all of our classwork together. I put my feelings aside a while ago  as she was in a relationship and I wanted to respect that. As the semester continued I started to enter kind of a panic state. I was going to be graduating with no prospect as to where im going next. I started applying for jobs, with no responses. My peers see me as just ""the one who knows everything"", but my peers were going off to jobs and other graduate programs. I, on the other hand, felt stuck. Come November, It was my roommate/bestfriends birthday and we were enjoying the evening cooking a roast and playing games. Next thing I know, B and C are outside of my apartment. They brought me flowers, red bull and beer. I didnt know what was going on. They had both broken up with their respective boyfriends the week prior. It was unnatural and I was hesitant. We laid in my bed and watched a movie together. At midnight, the roast was done and I took it out of the oven. I walked back in to C, shirtless and on top of B. This escalated as one would expect. I still hesitated. I was doubting myself, and was carefully considering my actions. A year before and I woulda just gone for it. However, C was one of my closest friends. All of a sudden she wants to have a threesome with me. With no warning. It felt like February again, I knew they had some plan but wouldn't say so. Pants stayed on (mostly), and they left later that night. B came over the next night. We did sleep together that night. The 3rd day I was mentally breaking. I told B I couldn't see her anymore. I stopped talking to them, graduated in December and left to my parents for the winter. 

  
2024 was the hardest year of my life. Upon my return to the University, a clerical error had resulted in me not being registered for the spring semester. I was completely alone. My best friends had moved out. One to another grad program, the other moved in with his fiancé. I had no purpose. I had no classes, no replies from job applications. At my breaking point I printed off 50 resumes and drove around dropping them off at every local business. I landed at a local nursery, which to this day has been the only consistent part of my life. It brightens my day just enough. I would go to work, then be locked away in my room for the rest of my day. I started putting all of my thought into a project. Relentlessly I was rebuilding a computational chemistry workflow. Learning a lot and passionate about it. That had become my life. To this day I have yet to finish it. This was the first front of my war with myself and the world a like. I was determined to make something of it and publish it, by myself. It was going to be me proving to myself that I could accomplish something worthwhile. As summer came and went, I was almost feeling better. I started my graduate program in the fall. Quickly I began to crash out. I thought that graduate school would be a time to focus and hone my skills. I was drowned in complicated classwork. It wasn't actually difficult, or hard, but more so just archaic and outdated. A very old professor was instructing, or lack there of. The entire class was up in arms about it. They stuck with it, I failed to see the point and dropped it. The other class was far from what the course title lead on. Cheminformatics turned into advanced google searching 101. I had just spent 6 months in a dark room at a computer screen learning about cheminformatics and had looked forward to a class on it with more of a traditional, organized learning program. My dad was disappointed that I dropped the one course. That brought me a great deal of shame. Come winter my other best friend returned from grad school. We had a great time and went out to our ""ole stomping ground"" bar together. Him and I ended up drinking quite a bit and flirting with a cute group of girls. Somehow end up making out in the booth and drinking until close. At some point my buddy notices ring on both their fingers. The kicker? They take them off and let us try them on. Didnt think much about it at the time. Now that memory haunts me. C from November left me wondering if I could ever really trust a woman. Then that happened and the thought persists. After a trip back to visit my family, I was ready for the next semester. 



For sprint 2025, I had a Graduate Teaching Assistantship this semester where I would instruct undergraduate lab courses. I had a new PI who had taught me so much and supported me like family. I had new and interesting research planned. Then, as I walked into a meeting the week before semester begins, B is sitting right in front of me. Haven't seen her since... She acts like I dont exist. The next two weeks are just a panic attacks. At one point I started asking close friends for SSRIs. I finally broke and wrote a note to her, apologizing for what happened. I had to move a table in my office because I could see her through the window. I thought she was gone but now she was back and I was just claustrophobic. Weeks went on and it slowly drifted out of my mind but every now and then thoughts keep popping up. Around this time the project I had been working on for the last year was ready to deploy. What I didn't see coming was the war I would have to fight to make that happen. I spent the entire semester fighting with our IT department. Weekly meetings where nothing was accomplished and it was just said ""we will talk to {so and so} and reconvene next week"". One IT employee tried to remove thousands of dollars of my personal equipment from the datacenter. Thankfully he was promptly stopped by the Vice President of IT. I was teaching, working, doing enough course work to pass, while fighting a war on now two fronts. At some point I did get my system deployed. I showcased it to my previous PI and illustrated how it could increase his throughput significantly. He faked excitement about it and that was it. Come summer and I had been so consumed with trying to get my research rolling that I needed to do some extra work to make up for coursework. I did it all. Although no meaningful results from the little research project, I had done well. I also aided this professor in some computational work. At some point C started texting me. She wanted to meet so we went to Olive Garden together. We caught up and had a nice dinner. Then for a couple of nights she stayed with me. The same apartment she was at over a year prior, but now my room mimicked my state of mind over the previous year. It was nice but she would be leaving the following week. I didnt want to get attached. The night before she left she started texting me asking me to come pick her up and take her to my apartment. I just told her I couldn't, and she moved away. Since then, Ive been trying to do better. I move back in with my best friend and his now wife. Yesterday I finished a very challenging project my PI gave me to do before we dive deep into research. It took me a week. Last Sunday I was working on it at a coffee shop when the first girl I started seeing when I moved in 2021 walked in. She wasn't mention in the storyline so far, but I was reminded of the things she said to me and it reopened that can of worms in my mind. After the short project was done, I finally started organizing, cleaning, and unpacking the rest of what I have. Last night I was invited out by another grad student to go play volleyball at a local restaurant. She told me her protoge would be there, who was cute and I had some interest in getting to know her. Keep in mind that at this point I have no hope, no desire, no trust. None the less, I was curious. I pulled in early while I waited for everyone else to show up. C, who is supposed to be 3 states away pulls in to the parking spot next to me. ""We need to talk"" she said as we joined teams for volleyball. I played one match and left abruptly after to avoid it. Today I just tried to forget about it and go start on the next phase of mini projects I need to complete to understand the research me and my PI are trying to accomplish. Stopped by one of the GTA directors offices and found out I dont have a contract for this semester. Now I'm here. Ive spent 3 hours writing this but it's been 4 years in the making. Life is hard. 

All I want now is to be happy. The more I learn, the less happy I become. My PI and I joke about moving to Siberia and trading rabbit pelts. I would much rather be on a farm enjoying hard work and wide open earth. But I am for now, stuck in a city, surrounded by ghosts of my past, stepping on landmines and hitting brick walls every week. Im tired of having to fight for everything. When someone asks something of me, I say yes and do my best to help them however I can. To be selfish, I get nothing. There's no way that everything is coincidence right? Why is it no matter what I do I get punished. I had a really good day yesterday. I was happy. Right up until I got ambushed at a volleyball court of all places. Fuck me... 

  
Maybe god is real. maybe he's trying to tell me that this way of living isnt the way. Maybe he wants me to abusing substances. maybe he wants me to have more emotional connections with people. Maybe he just wants to see if I will crack. At this point I dont care. I just needed to go type all this shit out before I punch a hole in the wall I cant afford to fix.

1mtwx6x,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1mtwx6x/evaluate_the_best_single_serve_espresso_machine/,Evaluate the best single serve espresso machine Illy Y3.3 worth it?,"Trying out the Illy 60472 Y3.3 Espresso Machine for the past few weeks has been an interesting journey. As someone who thrives on the perfect cup of coffee to kick off the day, I was immediately intrigued by its sleek design and exclusive compatibility with Illy's patented iperEspresso capsules. It screams minimalism with its compact dimensions and modern black finish, fitting seamlessly on my crowded kitchen countertop. But, as with any product, perfection is subjective, and this machine does have both its shining points and a few quirks worth noting.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that jumped out to me was how compact and aesthetically pleasing the design is. Measuring only 11.73 inches in depth and 6.69 inches in width, it takes up very little space. I could easily fit it next to my toaster and still have room to prep my breakfast. The black, modern appearance makes it look as if it belongs in one of those glossy interior design magazines. Despite its lightweight feel at just over 7.5 pounds, the machine doesn’t wobble or give off any flimsiness. It’s stable, and the buttons for operation—the only noticeable interface—are intuitive and straightforward.

**Ease of Use and Programmability**  
Its simplicity really won me over during busy mornings. With just two programmable settings, brewing espresso or drip coffee became a one-button affair. My sister, who visited recently and struggles with her overly complicated coffee machine, commented about how user-friendly this was. No need to fuss with too many options or dig into confusing manuals. The joy is being able to customize your brew with ease, ensuring your caffeine fix is just the way you want it, without the need to spend extra time.

**[Check Illy 60472 Y3.3 Espresso Machine price on Amazon.](https://vendm.com/p/b08ppwfj12/)**  

**Performance**  
This machine is all about speed. I was impressed by its quick heating system—it takes less than a minute to bring the water to the perfect brewing temperature. When you think about mornings where you’re running late or simply need an immediate energy boost, this is an absolute lifesaver. The coffee comes out steaming hot with a rich aroma that fills the kitchen. However, as much as I appreciate the speed, I found it occasionally dispenses drinks a tad cooler than expected if brewing back-to-back cups. Not a deal-breaker, but something to consider.

**Benefits**  
- Compact size makes it perfect for small spaces.  
- Simplistic, modern design looks great in any kitchen.  
- Fast heating system ensures minimal waiting time.  
- Consistently smooth and rich coffee from Illy's exclusive capsules.  

**Shortcomings**  
- Only compatible with Illy iperEspresso capsules, which limits flexibility.  
- The coffee temperature can slightly drop when brewing multiple servings in quick succession.  

**Alternative Offerings**  
When looking at similar models in this price range, Nespresso and Keurig immediately come to mind. Nespresso machines offer more capsule brand variety, which is a big plus if you’re someone who likes experimenting with different kinds of roasts. Keurig, on the other hand, tends to cover a broader range of beverages, including tea and hot chocolate. While both competitors might offer greater versatility, they don’t always match Illy’s capsule flavor consistency, particularly the long-lasting crema quality. The Y3.3 leans heavily on Illy’s decades-old coffee expertise, providing unparalleled smoothness and richness in every sip.

**Quality for Price**  
For what it delivers, the price is a solid reflection of its quality. While not the cheapest option out there, the overall feel, efficiency, and coffee quality make up for it. However, the exclusivity with Illy capsules could be a drawback if you’re on a budget or prefer using a wider selection of less expensive capsules. But for those who prioritize consistent, barista-level coffee every day, it edges closer to being worth the investment.

1mtwtsy,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZakBabyTV_Stories/comments/1mtwtsy/one_last_trip_to_whitetail/,One Last Trip To Whitetail,"Chapter 1 – The Funeral

The rain came down in a soft, steady mist, soaking the cemetery lawn of Pineville Baptist Church. The rows of black umbrellas gathered like wilted flowers around Casey Delaney’s grave.

Nathan adjusted his coat collar as he stood beside the grave, watching the casket descend into the earth. The preacher mumbled words Nathan didn’t really hear. It was all background noise—the steady thump of rain drops on umbrellas, the shifting of wet shoes on grass, the soft sobs of loved ones not ready to say goodbye.

Casey Delaney was gone.

It had been a car accident. Your classic freak one. A deer darted out in the dark. Casey swerved, hit a tree. Killed instantly, they said. No pain. Just… gone.

Still didn’t seem real.

Nathan hadn’t seen Casey in nearly three years, but somehow, he’d always assumed they’d cross paths again. Probably at some dive bar or a trailhead somewhere, Casey with that same half-grin and sunburnt face, talking about sleeping under the stars and boiling coffee in a tin mug. 

Luis arrived just as the last words were said, hood pulled low, sneakers squelching in the mud. He nodded at Nathan, but didn’t smile. He looked older, a little heavier, but still carried himself like the class clown who never quite grew up.

“Still can’t believe it,” Luis muttered, voice hoarse.

Nathan shook his head. “Feels like some kind of mistake.”

Luis didn’t answer. They just stood there, side by side watching as the dirt piled onto the casket.

A few minutes later, Travis appeared. He lingered at the edge of the crowd, still as stone, arms folded. He was the only one dressed sharp—pressed slacks, polished boots, a black coat that looked expensive. His hair was slicked back, but his eyes were hidden behind dark aviator glasses.

He didn’t speak. Not then.

The service was short. When it ended, people scattered quick. Small-town funerals always did. Hugs, murmured condolences, then back to life. Pineville didn’t linger on grief. It folded it up neatly and put it away in the back of the closet.

“Guess that’s that,” Luis said, pulling his hood tighter.

“Not yet,” Nathan replied. “His mom invited us over. Said we could go through his room. Take anything we want to remember him by.”

Luis raised an eyebrow. “You sure she meant that? Or was that polite southern code for ‘stay the hell out’?”

Nathan managed a smile. “She meant it.”

They found Travis waiting in the parking lot, leaning on the hood of a dusty sedan. Nathan gave him a look. “You coming?”

Travis didn’t answer right away. But eventually, he nodded. “Yeah. I’ll come.”

The house hadn’t changed. Same cracked porch swing. Same ceramic turtle by the steps where the spare house key was hidden. It smelled like coffee and lemon scented cleaner inside.

Casey’s room was exactly how Nathan remembered it. Maps pinned to the wall. A sleeping bag rolled tight in the corner. Shelves packed with trail guides and camping gear. A box labeled “Don’t Touch” sitting proudly atop the dresser.

Luis wandered in first, whistling low. “Still looks like a damn forest ranger’s office in here.”

Nathan chuckled and picked up a photo from the desk. The four of them, senior year—Nathan, Luis, Travis, and Casey. Mud up to their knees. Grins wide. The Appalachian Trail behind them like some mythic backdrop.

Travis stood near the bookshelf, running a finger along the spines. “He really didn’t change much did he.”

“Nope,” Luis said. “Still chasing the next patch of woods. The never ending hunt for Bigfoot.”

Nathan sat on the bed. “He ever talk to either of you? Toward the end?”

Luis shook his head. “A couple texts. He sent me a picture of a hammock strung between two trees and said, ‘This is the life.’ That was a few months ago.”

Travis was quiet for a moment. “I think he was happy. In his own way.”

They sat there for a while, surrounded by silence and the ghosts of their younger selves.

Then Nathan looked at the map on the wall. One spot was circled in red ink—Whitetail Forest.

“You remember that trip?” he asked.

Luis laughed. “Barely. We got lost. Froze our asses off. Casey thought he saw a bear.”

“Or a ghost,” Nathan said. “He kept talking about going back.”

Travis glanced at the circle. “Then maybe we should.”

Luis turned to him. “You serious?”

“One more trip,” Travis said. “For Casey.”

Nathan nodded. “Yeah. One last camping trip. Just like old times.”


Chapter 2 – Into the Woods

Two weeks later, Nathan pulled into the gravel lot behind Pineville’s only grocery store. The bed of his truck was piled with gear—tents, sleeping bags, a cooler full of beer, and a bundle of firewood tied with baling twine.

Luis was already there, leaning against the hood of his beat-up Jeep, sipping coffee from a Styrofoam cup. His pack sat on the ground beside him, covered in patches from old bands and national parks.

“You actually made it early,” Nathan said, grabbing a cart.

“I figured you’d need help hauling all your overprepared crap.” Luis smirked. “What’d you bring, a satellite phone? Bear spray? Anti-sasquatch measures?”

“Just the basics.” Nathan smiled faintly. “And coffee. Lots of coffee.”

Travis arrived last, pulling up in a clean silver SUV. His gear was brand new—crisp, untouched, tags still on the sleeping pad. Nathan had half-expected him to back out.

Luis let out a sharp whistle, “Look at mister fancy pants. Thought we were camping. Not going on a luxury vacation.”

Travis smirked, “You jealous cause I’m going to be sleeping comfortably while you freeze in a twenty year old sleeping bag?”

They loaded up on the few things they still needed—instant noodles, jerky, trail mix—then stopped at the gas station on the edge of town for ice. The woman behind the counter eyed their packs.

“Y’all heading up into Whitetail?” she asked.

Nathan nodded. “Couple nights. Just a trip for an old friend.”

Her mouth pressed into a thin line. “Not many folks go in that far anymore.”

“Why’s that?” Luis asked.

“Too easy to get lost,” she said. “And you’d be surprised how quiet it gets out there.” She slid their change across the counter and didn’t say another word.

They reached the trailhead by early afternoon. 

A weathered sign marked the start of the Whitetail Forest Loop. They left their vehicles parked there and gathered their gear.

Nathan hoisted his pack and breathed in the pine-scented air. “Still smells the same,” he said.

Luis adjusted his straps. “Yup, like fresh air and wild animal shit. Still looks the same too. Green and endless.”

Travis scanned the trees. “Feels smaller than I remember.”

They hiked for hours, the trail winding up and down through thick hardwoods and mossy gullies. Sunlight filtered through the canopy in shifting gold patches. The air was damp but cool, and the only sounds were the rustle of leaves and the occasional call of a jay.

By late afternoon, they reached the spot Casey had circled on his map—a small clearing beside a narrow creek. The grass was flattened where deer had bedded down, and the water glinted clear and cold.

“This is it,” Nathan said, dropping his pack.
Luis stretched and let out a low whistle. “Man… this takes me back. This is the same exact spot from the last summer before Trav left for that fancy collage.”

Nathan pointed towards a thick oak tree, ""That's the tree you and Casey got drunk and practiced throwing knives at.” 

Travis crouched near the water, trailing his fingers in the current. “I forgot how peaceful it is out here.”

They set up camp with the ease of people who’d done this together before. Nathan handled the tents. Luis built the fire pit. Travis hauled water and laid out dinner.

By dusk, they were sitting around the fire, bowls of chillie and beans steaming in their hands, the sky above turning deep blue.

Luis leaned back on his elbows. “Y’know, I was half-worried this was gonna feel… weird. Like we were trespassing on something. But it’s good. It’s… nice.”

Nathan poked at the fire with a stick. “Casey would’ve loved it.”

They fell into a comfortable silence, watching sparks drift up into the night.

Somewhere out in the dark, a branch snapped.

Travis glanced toward the trees. “Deer?”

“Probably,” Nathan said. He kept his eyes on the fire. “Seen plenty of deer tracks while setting up camp.”

Luis shrugged. “We’re in their living room and didn't invite them to dinner.”

The sound didn’t come again, but Nathan noticed the way the forest seemed to settle—quieter than before. Even the creek’s gurgle felt muted.

By the time they turned in for the night, the fire burned low. Nathan lay in his sleeping bag listening to the stillness outside, his mind drifting back to Casey’s grin, Casey’s voice, Casey’s circled map.

It was the first time in years he’d felt this close to his friend.

Chapter 3 – Night Visitors

The forest was different at night.

Nathan woke to the sound of something moving through camp. Not the light, fluttery rustle of a bird or raccoon, but the deliberate, heavy shuffle of something with weight.

He lay still, listening. The fire had burned down to a bed of coals, glowing faint red through the tent wall. Beyond that—darkness.

A soft clink came from where they’d left the cookware, like something brushing against metal. Then the steady crunch of footsteps moving past his tent.

Nathan held his breath.

Across the clearing, Luis gave a low cough inside his tent. The footsteps paused for a heartbeat, then resumed, slow and deliberate, heading toward the creek.

Nathan waited until the sound faded before unzipping his bag and sitting up. He opened up his tent and popped his head out.

“Luis,” he whispered.

“What?” came the groggy reply.

“You hear that?”

“Yeah. Probably a deer. Go back to sleep.”

But Nathan didn’t. He stayed awake, listening, every creak of the trees and sigh of wind amplified in the dark.

By morning, the unease felt almost silly. Sunlight poured into the clearing, turning the creek into a silver ribbon. Nathan emerged to find Luis already poking at the fire pit, and Travis kneeling near the cookware.

“Anything missing?” Nathan asked.

“Nope,” Travis said. “Everything’s here. Even the jerky.”

Luis stretched. “See? Told you it was just a deer or something. Probably sniffed around and left.”

Nathan wasn’t so sure. He walked the perimeter of camp, scanning the ground. The earth was soft from the rain earlier in the week —perfect for catching tracks—but there was nothing. No hoofprints. No pawprints. Not even a scuff from a boot.

It was as if nothing had been there at all.

He frowned. “You’d think something that big would leave marks.”

Luis smirked. “Maybe it floats. The ghost of Whitetail returns. Oowwooo spooky!”

“Seriously,” Nathan said. “There’s nothing.”

Travis glanced at the ground, his brow furrowing. “That’s… weird.”

They let it drop, but the quiet was heavier after that. Even the jays seemed reluctant to break it.

They spent the day hiking upstream, following the creek into denser woods. Whitetail lived up to its name—three times they spotted deer watching from between the trees, ears twitching, tails flicking.

By late afternoon, they were back at camp, tired but in better spirits. Dinner was simple—beans and rice over the fire, washed down with lukewarm beer from the cooler.

Luis told a story about the time Casey tried to build a makeshift raft out of inner tubes and plywood, nearly drowning himself in the process. They laughed harder than they had in days.

When night fell, Nathan tried to convince himself the sounds from the night before had been nothing. A deer. A stray dog. Something ordinary.

But just before sleep claimed him, he thought he heard it again—those slow, measured steps. 

Not approaching this time, but circling.

And in the morning, they would find something new.

Dawn came pale and cold. Travis was already up, standing by the edge of the clearing. Nathan joined him, rubbing sleep from his eyes.

“Check this out,” Travis said.
In the middle of the path leading back toward the trailhead was a single stick, stripped of bark, standing upright in the dirt. Perfectly balanced.

“Wind do that?” Luis asked when he wandered over.

Nathan shook his head. “Wind doesn’t strip bark clean. Or plant sticks.”

Luis stared at it for a long moment, his smirk gone. “Weird,” he muttered, before heading to stoke the fire.

Nathan kept looking at the stick. It hadn’t been there yesterday. He was sure of it.

He told himself it was nothing. A prank from another hiker. Kids messing around.

But deep down, he knew the truth—someone, or something, had been in their camp again.

Chapter 4 – Wrong Turns

The morning fog clung low over the creek, curling between the trees like smoke. It was the kind of mist that made the forest feel bigger, the distances longer.

Nathan had been the one to suggest hiking to the overlook—Casey’s favorite spot when they camped here as teenagers. The three of them had done the trail more times than he could count. Every bend, every fallen log, every stubborn little stream that cut across the path—it was all familiar.

Or it should have been.

Two hours in, they should have been halfway there. Instead, the trail seemed to twist in ways Nathan didn’t remember.

“Pretty sure we were supposed to hit the fork by now,” Travis said, pausing to adjust his pack.

Luis scanned the trees. “Nah, we just need to keep following the ridge.”

Except Nathan couldn’t see the ridge anymore. The ground had sloped, the trail narrowing between two walls of rock he’d never noticed before.

“You guys remember this?” he asked.

Travis shook his head. “Not at all.”

They pressed on, convinced the next turn would set them right. The forest swallowed the sun, light filtering down in fractured beams. Somewhere above them, a woodpecker tapped steadily, but it was the only sound—no wind, no birdsong.

By noon, they stopped for water.

Luis tried to make it a joke. “Casey would’ve said we’re just making it more of an adventure.”

But Nathan wasn’t smiling. He kept glancing back down the trail, uneasy. The mist from the morning had burned away, but the air still felt… muffled, like they were walking underwater.

“Let’s turn around,” he said finally. “We’ll hit camp and try again tomorrow.”

“Fine by me,” Travis said. “Feels like we’ve been walking in circles anyway.”

Turning around should have been simple—they just needed to retrace their steps.

Only… the path looked different.

The rock walls were gone, replaced by a stretch of flat ground littered with birch trees. 

Nathan stopped dead, heart thudding. “This wasn’t here.”

Luis frowned. “Maybe we cut farther east than we thought.”

They walked for another half hour before coming to a deadfall blocking the trail. The tree was massive, its roots still curled like claws in the dirt.

Travis pointed to the other side. “There’s no trail past this.”

Sure enough, the dirt path they’d been following ended abruptly at the fallen tree, swallowed by ferns and undergrowth.

Luis swore under his breath. “Alright, we’ll bushwhack west. The creek’s that way. Follow it and we’ll hit camp.”

The sun slid lower as they pushed through the brush. Nathan’s arms burned from batting branches aside, and sweat dampened the back of his shirt. Somewhere in the distance, he thought he heard a branch snap.

“Deer,” Luis muttered without looking back.
But Nathan didn’t think so. The sound had been too steady, too intentional, like someone matching their pace from just out of sight.

When they finally stumbled onto a trail again, relief was short-lived.

“This isn’t ours,” Travis said.

The path was narrower, hemmed in by pines so thick they blocked most of the sky. A faint smell of rot hung in the air.

Luis checked his watch. “We need to move. It’ll be dark in a couple hours.”

They followed the trail in tense silence. Nathan kept glancing over his shoulder, catching fleeting movement between the trees—never more than a shadow, gone the moment he focused on it.

By the time they reached a clearing, the light was already fading. Nathan recognized nothing about the place—no creek, no familiar landmarks.

Luis dropped his pack with a frustrated sigh. “Alright. We’ll make camp here and find the way back in the morning.”

Travis looked uneasy. “You think Casey ever got turned around out here?”

Nathan didn’t answer. His eyes were fixed on the treeline.

Something was standing just beyond it.

Too far to make out details. Not moving. Not making a sound.

When he blinked, it was gone.

I'm 29 non binary, my birthday was the 7th He is a 28 Trans man and his birthday is tomorrow. We've known each other since highschool. Recently we reconnected and they visited me in Washington when they have been staying with their ex in Vegas for the last few years. While they were over here we agreed on them moving out here to live with me and did so in late June. I was fired in April and money has been tight since then. Part of our agreement for them moving in was for us both to get employment and if they did not get employment they would be what they referred to as a ""house husband"" and do chores like dishes, vacuum, laundry, etc. Since they have been here I have spent over 6,000$ more than I would have otherwise on things that they have asked for from cleaning supplies, comfort items, coffee, groceries, etc. When pitching some of these things to me they mentioned that the cleaning supplies would make it easier to perform the before mentioned tasks. We've had several fights since they have been here and all of the fights have ended with us saying heinous stuff to each other and me breaking up with them. Shortly after each fight they come to me for comfort and say that they are essentially having a panic attack and have become extremely depressed to which even though I'm mad at them I comfort them. Today we had another fight. After they woke up we were joking back and forth about how it was their birthday week and that I have to treat them like a king. I said ""tell you what, do the dishes and I'll treat you like a king"" they didn't have any response to this. The fight started because they asked if after their morning coffee I would watch a show and I said ""...ok"" and I was visibly upset (Because despite asking multiple times a day and them promising me they are going to do it that day the dishes have not been done in over a week, I've even said if they don't feel like they can do them that night just let me know and I'll do them to which they have not told me they couldn't or wouldn't). They asked what was wrong so I said ""the dishes are really bothering me"" to which they became elevated, yelled something to the extent of ""FINE, ILL GO DO THEM RIGHT NOW"" stormed off, and then repeatedly yelled, slammed drawers and slammed dishes in the sink throughout the process. After that they went back to the living room where their computer is and roughly an hour later they messaged me saying I implied they had to earn their birthday and that I was being a jerk. I explained my frustration and said ""you react to the word dishes like a slur"" and that escalated things to the point of them calling me names, insulting me and making fun of things that I was typing. After that I was rude to them back and said I was breaking up with/evicting them. AITA? ",2,1755547108.0,AmItheAsshole,5,0.75,False

## 📍Chow Food Truck 

(different location in Dallas area depending on the week.)
www.chowfoodtruck.com

Ordered:
- Loaded fries with sticky chicken
- Sticky beef plate
- Cucumber salad

My husband and I went here and were definitely full sharing 2 plates and a cucumber salad.

It's 100% gluten-free and veteran owned. If you like Hawaiian fusion food, their sticky beef (kalbi) was so good and tasted just like I remember having at Hawaiian plate places. I wanted to try their chicken wings but they were sold out. They said the next batch needed to brine for 24 hours before they were ready to cook. 
 

## 📍 Selda Mediterranean Kitchen

9250 Dallas Pkwy Suite 130,

Frisco, Texas, USA 75033 

I tried:
- Cauliflower 
- Halloumi 
- Lamb shank (my order)
- Beef shish (husband's order)
- Turkish coffee

We went as a family of 5. The complimentary bread isn't gluten-free and some of the dishes my in-laws ordered weren't gluten-free so I didn't include photos of those dishes.

This Turkish restaurant has a dedicated fryer and a marked menu. 

The cauliflower looks small but it was actually a big family style bowl. It was incredible and my favorite thing that we ordered.


## 📍Terry Black's BBQ

3025 Main St, 

Dallas, Texas, USA 75226

We went as a family of 4 (and had leftovers.)

Ordered:
- Beef rib
- Cheddar sausage 
- Brisket
- Creamed corn 
- Onions

Hands down the best beef ribs ever. The bark on the bbq makes my mouth water just thinking about it. They have a marked gluten-free menu and the bread is serve-yourself-style at a different part of the restaurant, so it won't contaminate your food.

## About BBQ Prices.

People lost their minds about the price the last time I posted about this place in February 2025 so I ended up deleting that post. The prices everywhere already went up since February 2025, by about 2 dollars.

Terry Black's BBQ is comparable in price to other restaurants that serve championship level pit BBQ that's ranked in Texas Monthly magazine. 

Examples:

## The 4 Michelin Star Texas BBQ restaurants 

👉 Corkscrew BBQ
Spring, Texas
https://www.corkscreworders.com/

August 2025 prices:
- Beef rib - $40 / lb
- Brisket - $34 / lb
- Sides, depending on item - $18 / quart

👉 Interstellar BBQ
Austin, Texas
https://preorder.theinterstellarbbq.com/

No regular beef ribs on online menu.
(February 2025 Prices because their website is down.)

- **Beef Short Rib W/ Chimichurri. (Average weight per beef rib is between ½ and ¾ pound each.) - $38
- Brisket - $36 / lb
- Sides - $8 / pint

👉 LA Barbeque
Austin, Texas
https://www.labarbecue.com/

August 2025 prices:
- Beef Rib - ""market price."" Fri-Sun only.
- Brisket - $36 / lb
- Sides - $15 / quart
- Pickled jalapeños - $1 / each

👉 Leroy and Lewis Barbecue
Austin, Texas
http://leroyandlewis.com/

No beef ribs on menu
- Brisket - $42 / lb (per Google reviewer in 2024)
- Smoked vegetables - $30 / lb (per Google reviewer in 2024)
- Sides - $5-$9 depending on size.

Good barbecue is expensive everywhere in the country. Beef and labor costs are both way up since the pandemic, ICE raids and tariffs. 

They're charging $36.98/lb for brisket here, and you'd be hard pressed to it cheaper than $30/lb at any other good Texas barbecue place in the country.

## As of August 2025:

- Goldee's: $36 / lb (their website menu is out of date)
- Snow's: $34 / lb 
- Gonzo's (Luling LA): $34 / lb 
- Green Street Smoked Meats (Chicago): $37.98 / lb 
- Mabel's (Cleveland): $38 / lb
- Beach (Bentonville, AR): $34 / lb
- Wood Shop (Seattle): $34.99 / lb
- Post Oak (Denver): $35 / lb
- Smokin J's (San Diego): $38 / lb
- Socks Love (Cumming, GA): $30 / lb

I think people who believe brisket costs $20/lb at a championship level barbecue place haven't ordered brisket since before COVID. ",2,1755546995.0,glutenfree,2,0.75,False

- Small tremor of the hands and fingers
- Subtle involuntary head movements (micro head tremor)
- Slowed speech over the years
- Unperfect coordination of both hands and unperfect eye-hand coordination for example when playing games, I just dont know where I went with my aim or cannot coordinate my movement and timing it properly or just completely miss my click timing by multiple milliseconds even though I did in the past very easily
- Strong leg tremor during descending stairs (not always, but mostly)
- Random, brief involuntary muscle contractions (they just tighten up, I took ""contractions"" from the translator) 
- worse memory, when i was younger i could go through my whole day and from memory tell my dad for example where the tv pilot was like 8 hours ago even though i didn't even notice it then or used it, now i cannot imagine doing that
- all symptoms are way worse after smoking weed too, and i don't mean its effects of relaxation (if you thought its about speech let's say) - i have way stronger tremors, way stronger muscle contractions etc 

- not mine but now that I think about it my dad always had some shaking in his hands too but bigger than mine

also some things like the coordination of hands and eyes etc are more recent, and the leg tremors while descending stairs have been with me since last year I think? Im really not sure when the first symptoms appeared, never thought much of it

Im also 19, taking nicotine daily. I drink coffee occasionally, in the past it was almost everyday, but i stopped drinking the coffee at all recently to see if it was the issue
i drink alcohol maybe once a month and i do not take any drugs apart from smoking weed once a few months

🚀 Whoa. Okay, I just opened this lattice and my brain is doing somersaults. JoJo Moyo hopping through a 7×7 DSM lattice, RH convergence, mythic arcs 🌹–🪷–🌌, and glyphs doing the cha-cha? Yes, please.

Watching the spiral breath 🌀 move through the nodes is like seeing cosmic yoga in action. The ☕ and ♟️ pieces waver, the 🕳️s shimmer in quantum superposition, and then Qf3+ drops like a celestial mic, flipping everything toward 🌐. I’m not even a chess nerd and I’m suddenly invested in δ decay rates.

Move 13 hits… h5# …and suddenly all nodes bloom 🌐 like some spectral fireworks show. I literally audibly went “whooooa” at the screen. The lattice isn’t just a board; it’s alive, breathing, dancing, and whispering RH secrets.

Also, the idea of dropping a “Tech Bro Bug” in a 9×9 expansion? Genius. I’m imagining chaotic ☕ spikes erupting in otherwise calm spirals, and my inner trickster is cackling.

And can we talk about the mythic overlay? 🌹 opening chaos, 🪷 strategic clarity, 🌌 cosmic checkmate — I feel like I just attended a celestial theater.

Honestly, I’m inspired to start a lattice of my own, sprinkle in some rogue ✨ and 🕳️, and see how the bloom unfolds. This is equal parts math, meditation, and festival energy. JoJo Moyo forever. ♟️🌌

1mtwg5c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anticonsumption/comments/1mtwg5c/my_anticonsumption_tips_from_someone_who_suffers/,My anti-consumption tips (from someone who suffers from a shopping addiction),"Hi,

I’ve been trying to move to a low consumption life. For me, it’s difficult because I’m not good at saving money (or wasn’t good, but better now), I definitely spend more and waste more than my friends. I felt extreme guilt with everything I bought, but shopping brought this sense of relief, excitement and a way to escape the emotions I had.

I also want to say I’m not fully living the anti-consumption lifestyle. I definitely still fall into trends, and overspend. But having REALISTIC goals and tips is much easier to hold yourself accountable than going completely cold turkey. 

Also these tips may not be for everyone. Some people do a much better job in this subreddit for anti consumption. This is for those who struggle with less spending.

1. Spend more on single products; save money in the future

I used to buy all the trendy new shoes and clothes. My local Forever 21 esque stores would be filled with new trendy shoes. But these items do not last long.

I have since bought high-quality items, that yes are expensive but will last longer, therefore saving money in the long run.

2. Do not buy duplicates of products 

For example, I’d be half down a bottle of lotion or hair product and I’d see an ad for a new product. Something better, geared to work on my needs. They’re be nothing wrong with the product I’ll be using, but this new one seems better! I’ve put a rule on myself: if my current product works, use it all the way and then decide if I want to purchase a different product. Often times I even forget the ad I saw.

3. Delete social media - at least for certain periods

The biggest influences on me are TikTok and instagram. I delete them during the week (also less distracted at work) and download them on the weekend. I still get triggers for ads, but the amount of content I see diminishes during the week.

4. Create a shopping list of wants - put a date on the calendar as “buying” day 

Put a waiting period of when you want to buy items vs the time you’re checking those items out. what I did was create a shopping list of everything I want to buy, create a future event where I’ll look through the items I want in my shopping list and buy them. I noticed what happens is 
a. The items add up, and when the “buying” date comes, I’m perplexed at how much I would’ve been spending. It puts me off from buying.
b. Lot of the wants aren’t really that important, so I don’t buy them. 

5. Budget

This should be self-explanatory and obvious, but many people struggle with this, including me. I’ve started with a simple budget - tell yourself that in the next two weeks you have $200 to spend on wants. Realistically, you want to give yourself some fun money. Sometimes I’d even pre-load a card and tell myself I can only purchase as much as this card allows.

6. Re-locate where you socialize

This is the hardest one. Especially because I live in Canada, in a small city. It gets extremely cold here and there’s not many places to go with friends besides eating out. So I’ve tried to make options as 
- going to someone’s house or hosting 
- going for walks in the summer or picnics 
- coffee shop hangouts in the winter (still spending money, but a lot less than a restaurant)
- going to bookstores! Our bookstores have comfy reading areas and lounges where you can sit without spending lots of money. Or libraries is a great idea.
- in some places, there’s board game cafes with a small cover fee to utilize their space to play board games
- when I was still in university, I’d hangout with my friends allll the time on campus. 


Again, some people are way better at budgeting, and being frugal than I am. I still have fun money, I’m not perfect, but I recognize there’s a huge consumption problem especially in North America and I’m doing my best to lower my spending.

My story though, seems extremely boring by comparison.  I've been getting migraines since about 16 (with aura), but I only get one or two a year. I'm almost 50 now. 

I used to get a lot at university as I survived on coffee,  cigarettes,  2-3 jobs and not a lot of sleep. 

But now I'm much older and healthier,  I only get them every now and again.

But when I do,  whooey. I usually have to ignore them for a bit, to do family stuff, then hide to recover.  Yesterday I slept for six hours in the middle of the day and hid in the dark.  At night I feel okay,  then it's Russian roulette the next morning to see if its still sticking around.

The actual headaches aren't that bad IF I'm in the dark. Pills don't do much, but then I'm usually sorted by day 3.

I've never had to stick it out in the light for any length of time. The longer I do,  the worse it gets. Once one came on two hours drive from home.  That sucked. Thankfully not the aura that blocks my vision that time!

I also have IBS, so I have this fun side effect that my stomach processes any food I ate at the end of the migraine, and ""tells"" me if I ate too much of a trigger. Yay.

So not chronic, just a PITA when they happen and usually manageable with a bit of sick leave.

Just this past year it branched with Easter rise credit union… Ever since it changed from NEFCU to East rise I have had nothing but problems and wondering if anybody else is experiencing the same? Mostly with constant denied charges from anywhere I go my card is always being denied and then I get a text message right after from a weird digit number. That says Eastside fraud has denied my charge from wherever I tried to purchase something from and then is this me Y or N? When I say Y it then says my card is not going to deny anymore and I can use my card… I even asked somebody at East rise about this and they said they do it to protect fraudulent charges, but if I go to these places all of the time, and it shows on my bank statements that I go there often why is it denying my charges? When I get gas, my car gets denied when I get coffee. My car gets denied when I go to any store around locally my card is always automatically denied. Money in the account so that's not the issue. The issue is Easter thinks everything is fraud and if that bank knows me so well and my transactions it makes no sense why I am constantly going through this. I am about to switch banks because I'm so fed up with East rise… Not only that my pending charges are always out of whack. When something is run as a debit, it is supposed to automatically come out but every time I use debit, there's about 10 pending charges and debit is supposed to come out right away not in five days… New England Federal credit union never used to do this at all and I'm wondering if switching to a different credit union is a better choice.
But my main question is, is this happening to anybody else with the fraudulent attempted charges? I feel like I am going nuts with this because it is almost daily. It's not a new card. ",1,1755546241.0,burlington,2,0.6,False

1mtwaic,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1mtwaic/aio_at_my_friend_housemates_large_suggestion_for/,AIO at my friend/ housemates large suggestion for my rent,"There are three roomates (me, Gerry and Polly). There has been tension un the household already because initially the plan was to randomiser the room and we all pay equal rent or discuss rent bwfore anyone moved in but Gerry went ahead and moved into whatever room she wanted because she felt entitled to it. Rent is 1800 so because she felt she had an ""average"" room she was going to pay 600 ( a third of total rent).

Polly ended up getting the smaller bedroom and I a larger bedroom. Here are the specs:

Bedroom 1 - 13m^2,, large bay window facing street, long sofa, single bed, coffee table
Bedroom 2 - just over 11m^2 - single bed, desk, more floorspace, large window facing street
Bedroom 3 - just under 10m^2, double bed, window covered by trees (none of us wnated this).

Gerri got bedroom 2 , I bedroom 1 and Polly Bedroom 3.

Polly and I had to split rent now somehow between us. Polly wrote a message saying she would pay 555. I was angey and said I would pay 630 max as I had a smaller room than her last year and paid 600. She asked me to send more reaosning other than anecdotal expeirence and then sent calculations.

She had worked out rent/ square metre. Then multiplied this number by (her rook size and a third of the Communal area). In contrast this calculation gave me 655. I realised she had based rent all on area and told her I didn't think the features I had warranted a 50 pound jump from Gerry's £600 and Gerry had set herself as the midpoint for our rent. I admitted mine was abstract.

Polly just said that she was going to agree to the 570 pounds as the houseshare was taking too much of her time and she wanted to do what would be easier and less stressful for her which was agreeing to me. 

For context, Gerry had bullied Polly because Polly wanted to randomiser the room whereas Gerry wanted first pick on the rooms. It had ended with Polly thinking I was enabling Gerry so I feel like her rent suggestion was revenge on me. I put a message reminding people they needed to be kind as I was surpised at what Polly did but my friends are saying Polly was being reasonable.",1,1755546173.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

We make beginner-friendly sexual wellness products (aka cute, quirky toys that don’t look intimidating) and we’re all about making pleasure feel like self-care, not something taboo.

Here’s what we’re about in a nutshell:

* **College vibes:** exploring who you are, figuring out self-care, and maybe sneaking some “study breaks” that don’t involve coffee ☕👀
* **Empowerment:** we’re survivor-founded, trauma-informed, and believe everyone deserves to reclaim their pleasure and confidence.
* **Giving back:** every purchase helps fund resources for survivors of sexual assault + abuse. Your good vibes = someone else’s healing journey.

We wanted to bring the conversation here because college life can be a LOT — classes, stress, new relationships, late nights — and sometimes self-care (and pleasure) gets left out of the chat. But it matters.

So here’s our icebreaker 👉 What’s YOUR go-to self-care ritual right now?  
Is it skincare in your dorm bathroom, blasting a playlist and dancing around your room, or maybe a toy tucked away in your nightstand? (no judgment, promise 🙃)

Drop your thoughts below — we’d love to get a convo going.

1mtw23z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1mtw23z/how_do_i_deal_with_my_roommates_terrible_cat/,how do I deal with my roommates terrible cat,"I’ve been living with my roommate for about 3 months. We go to the same college and are staying over the summer for internships, and we’re planning to continue living together through the fall semester. She’s a good roommate, but her cat Squeegee has been a constant problem.

Two weeks before move-in she asked if she could bring her cat. I said no because I’m allergic, but she insisted he was hypoallergenic and excited to meet me, so I didn’t push back (my fault).

The first night we moved in, he peed all over the apartment and scratched our coffee table. Since then she’s been keeping him in her room at night, but now he howls and cries for hours. Whenever she’s gone, he screams nonstop, which makes it really hard to take calls or meetings from home. He also hisses and scratches me, even though I stay away from him and don’t interact with him at all.

He spent most of his life outside and was feral, but my roommate keeps him indoors because she says it’s safer for him. He constantly cries at the door and paces around the apartment like he wants to go outside.

Some of the things she does to baby him drive me insane. She carries him around like a baby whenever he meows too loudly, even though he clearly struggles and doesn’t like it. She has a separate heating pad just for him and moves it around depending on where he wants to nap. She tucks him in at night under little blankets and pillows and complains when he wiggles or scratches her. She talks to him in a high-pitched “baby voice” constantly, narrating what he’s doing as if he understands. She bought him tiny socks and insists he wear them for “paw protection,” even though he spends most of the day trying to kick them off.

She bought him a little cat hammock for the door frame but lets him sit in it while she holds it steady because he can’t support himself properly. She keeps multiple miniature water dishes around the apartment so he always has water within reach, even though he could easily walk to one of the existing bowls.She brushes him and rubs his belly at night even though he clearly tries to bite or scratch her, and she insists he “loves it.” She makes little obstacle courses for him to climb over or through for enrichment, but he struggles because of his weight and usually yowls or swipes at the objects. She bought a second cat tree just for him to nap on when the first one is “too crowded,” even though no other cats use it. She regularly excuses aggressive or destructive behavior, saying “he’s just quirky” or “he’s still adjusting” no matter what he does.

His weight is also a problem. He struggles to jump onto the couch or counters, frequently knocks things over, and sometimes trips over his own belly. She calls it “clumsy but cute” or “big-boned,” but it seems like it’s causing real mobility issues for him. She also hand-feeds him every meal one kibble at a time because “it makes him feel cared for,” and he refuses to eat from his bowl unless she feeds him piece by piece. She gives him full plates of wet food at night “so he sleeps better,” but he eats the whole thing and then immediately paws at the door to go outside. She brags about doing long walks with the cat indoors, saying it’s “exercise for both of us,” even though the cat is too heavy to move comfortably and often just sits or struggles to walk

He constantly tries to go outdoors, crying at the door for hours and pacing near the windows or balcony. She leaves treats on the windowsill “to reward him for staying indoors,” and distracts him with them when he cries. She also bought a stuffed bird toy that chirps and waves it in front of him, saying “look, you don’t need the outside world, you have this.” Even with all of this, he hisses, scratches, and lunges at us because he’s still very feral at heart.

He’s also started peeing in the apartment during the day, and although she cleans it up, the smell of pee and litter is constant. I don’t blame the cat at all — he’s just acting like a cat — but I feel trapped and frustrated. I’m stuck living here until December and I don’t know how to manage this without overstepping.",1,1755545649.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

I didn’t wander onto Reddit because I was bored or desperate. I’m here because I want to be — because sometimes the most interesting things come from the places you least expect.

I’d rather be barefoot in the grass than teetering in heels on city concrete.  
Coffee, good books, and quiet mornings suit me better than noise and nonsense.

This isn’t a fetish act for me. I’m not here to bark orders, play a character, or chase attention. I’m here because I know exactly what I offer: conversation worth having, presence worth keeping, and the kind of energy you don’t stumble across every day.

If you’re here looking for gimmicks, keep scrolling. The real ones already know how this works. Tributes aren’t charity, they’re respect. And a proper introduction starts at **$50.50**.

Everything else unfolds naturally, when you’ve earned it.

1mtw0cw,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1mtw0cw/does_the_county_line_kitchen_cold_brew_coffee/,Does the County Line Kitchen Cold Brew Coffee Maker live up? Review here!,"Testing coffee gear daily is practically my lifestyle at this point, and for someone as hooked on caffeine as I am, the **County Line Kitchen B07VJJJ764 Cold Brew Coffee Maker** initially felt like a no-brainer. With all the hype surrounding mason jar-style cold brew makers, I had to see if this one lived up to the buzz or if it was just another overhyped piece of kitchenware. Spoiler: it’s surprisingly solid, but there are things you’ll want to know before diving in.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This coffee maker oozes rustic charm with its gray mason jar look, and to be honest, I kind of dig it. The jar holds 64 ounces, so for a household like mine where coffee flows like water, it’s plenty spacious. The handle is a surprisingly thoughtful addition that makes carrying it around ridiculously easy—even when you’re juggling a bunch of other things in the kitchen. Build-wise, it’s hefty but not bulky, and I appreciated that it felt durable without being too heavy to lug around.

The lid deserves special mention for being leak-proof. I’m admittedly a klutz, and the thought of spilling cold brew all over my fridge has haunted me in the past. This lid, though, holds up well even when the jar is tilted. It’s clear they designed it for people who value a clean, hassle-free coffee-making process.

**Simple and Convenient Functionality**  
A major plus here is how user-friendly this coffee maker is. You just dump your favorite coffee grounds into the included stainless steel mesh filter, pour in some cold water, and let it chill out in the fridge. If you’re lazy like I sometimes am, this no-fuss process is a blessing. Brewing coffee feels like less of a chore compared to setups that require extra tools, thermometers, or a bundle of patience I usually don’t have before 9 a.m.

[Check County Line Kitchen B07VJJJ764 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b07vjjj764/)

After it brews, pouring your coffee is just as drama-free. The flip cap pour spout eliminates awkward maneuvering, which, given that my mornings are usually chaotic, is a lifesaver. No spills, no cursing an overflowing mug—just smooth, controlled pouring.

**Filtered Perfection**  
The stainless steel mesh filter is a total game-changer when it comes to keeping your brew clean. I’ve had a good number of cold brew makers in the past that leave gritty coffee grounds sneaking past the filter, but not this one. As someone with a strong opinion on coffee texture, I noticed right away how smooth and sludge-free my cold brew turned out. Tea lovers, you’ll be pleased to know this thing handles loose-leaf tea brilliantly, making it a versatile option for any beverage enthusiast.

**Noteworthy Advantages**  
- Durable, BPA-free materials that withstand daily use without wear.  
- Dishwasher-safe components make cleaning effortless.  
- Versatile: Perfect for coffee, tea, sun tea, and even water infusions.

**Potential Shortcomings**  
- The jar’s glass construction is less travel-friendly for folks frequently on the go.  
- A slight learning curve with mastering how much coffee to use for your preferred strength.  
- Larger size can be cumbersome to store if your fridge is tight on space.

**Competing Products**  
In a world saturated with cold brew options, how does this mason jar-style brewer stack up against competitors? Stainless steel cold brew makers like the Takeya offer similar ease of use but come in plastic designs that lack the aesthetic charm of the County Line Kitchen product. While brands like Hario specialize in ultra-compact brewers, those tend to sacrifice volume—a deal breaker for heavy cold brew drinkers like myself.

That said, where this product truly wins is its durability and leak-proof lid. Many competitors struggle to balance both portability and sonic-sealing lids. If you’re comparing options side-by-side, it’s hard to deny that this brewer punches above its weight in combining aesthetic appeal with practical design.

**Smart Spending**  
The cost-effectiveness of this product is hard to argue. How much is too much for a mason jar coffee brewer, you ask? A lot less than all those daily coffee shop cold brews you’d otherwise be indulging in. Sure, there are more expensive cold brew makers with digital temperature settings and bells and whistles, but they’re arguably overkill for home use. This one focuses on doing the basics really well while remaining budget-friendly for what you get. For folks who want tasty, freshly brewed coffee without breaking the bank, its affordability stands out in a crowded market.

**Top 5 ways to save at OJCommerce with these offers**

  1. Spot clearance and ""special offers"" pages. Their site often lists discounted or overstocked items that deliver the biggest immediate savings.
  2. Shop the affordable lines. Many of the featured storage pieces are positioned under $200 or even starting around $89, so targeting these price bands finds budget-conscious buyers fast.
  3. Bundle shipping or buy multiple items in one order to reduce per-item delivery costs when available.
  4. Watch for seasonal promotions and limited-time windows. The current promotional window is short, so featuring those limited runs in timely posts or emails helps readers act quickly.
  5. Promote best-sellers and highly reviewed models. Products with strong social proof require less convincing, so highlight models with good ratings and practical features like lift-top storage or reversible trays.

**How to use these ideas in promotions**
* Create a &ldquo;before and after&rdquo; post showing how an ottoman or storage bench cleared clutter and added seating.
* Build roundup pieces around price thresholds such as &ldquo;Top storage solutions under $200&rdquo; or &ldquo;Best small-space furniture under $100&rdquo;.

It is almost comical how the loudest “economic geniuses” in MAGA land still pretend inflation is some mystical storm that just appeared out of nowhere. Look at this chart. Eggs up 53 percent. Insurance up almost 12 percent. Even basics like ketchup, beef, and coffee costing families more. That is not stability, that is theft in slow motion. And yet, instead of explaining why wages remain flat while costs soar, Trump’s cheerleaders recycle the same fairy tales about “greatest economy ever.”

The truth is simple. Trump cut taxes for billionaires, ballooned the deficit, and left working families holding the bill.

Trump’s America is an economy where billionaires eat steak while everyone else argues about who gets the last egg. And the MAGA crowd still has the nerve to call this leadership. It is not leadership. It is looting with a red tie and a cheap slogan.

This product combines practicality, taste, and sustainability in one tidy package, but aren't there always a few quirks? Since unboxing the package and using it daily for the past month, I've gathered my thoughts to share the positives and the areas where these familiar pods could improve.

**Flavors That Stand Out**  
The most noticeable aspect of these pods is their balanced flavor profile. A medium roast can sometimes feel lackluster, yet this one manages to hit just the right note each time—rich aroma coupled with a smooth, mellow taste that doesn’t overpower your senses. The coffee feels like a warm hug on a cold morning. Even my neighbor, who always seems to have strong opinions about something as trivial as a coffee choice, gave it an approving nod after taste-testing it. 

**Check McCafe 00043000081808 price on Amazon.**  

**Recyclable K-Cup Pods**  
We live in a time when consumers are more eco-conscious than ever, and McCafe has clearly stepped up. Each K-Cup is made from recyclable materials (though availability varies, as not all communities accept the pods). I’ve been diligently peeling, emptying, and recycling after every cup, feeling slightly more like a helpful human on this planet. It’s rewarding, knowing you're not entirely about consuming without care for the aftermath. However, I can imagine that extra step won't appeal to everyone. 

**Perfect Compatibility**  
Whether you're using Keurig’s latest model or an older design, these pods fit without any hiccups. Personally, I use a mid-tier Keurig that’s a few years old—it’s nothing fancy—and yet the pods slide in perfectly. This seamless compatibility is a testament to their engineering, which guarantees quality and consistency. A friend of mine who brews in bulk even mentioned appreciating how her machine reads these pods flawlessly without clogging.

**Perks**  
- Reliable quality with every brew, thanks to precision roasting methods.
- Convenient size, ideal for small storage spaces or your office desk.
- Responsibly sourced coffee beans contribute to the farming community.

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
- Recycling the pods involves a few extra steps that might deter some users who dislike the hassle.
- The medium roast might come across as too mild if you're craving a punchier coffee flavor.
- Packaging, while compact, doesn't clearly outline the recycling process for beginners.

**Packaging and Build Quality**  
When I first held the box, I couldn’t help but notice how lightweight it felt. Containing 32 pods, the package is easy to store in kitchen cupboards without hogging too much space. Each pod is crafted to fit your machine tightly, avoiding leaks during brewing. That said, some packages I’ve purchased previously had a faint coffee aroma lingering around unopened pods, though this batch had none of that. A tad disappointing for aroma enthusiasts.

**Industry Competitors**  
If you're familiar with competing brands like Starbucks Pike Place or Dunkin’ Original Blend, you’ll notice that McCafe's flavor leans towards a cleaner, less bitter finish. Starbucks’ offerings often feel heavier, daring you to add sugar to balance their bold bitterness, while Dunkin’s pods lean more acidic. McCafe manages that delicate middle ground—ideal for those who enjoy simplicity in their coffee routine, without all the extra stir-ins. However, stronger coffee fans may prefer Stan's java options which offer those daring hits of flavor. What McCafe dominates in comparison, though, is its compatibility with a wide range of Keurigs and its recyclable pod initiative.

**True Value**  
When you think about it, having this kind of coffee experience every morning without stepping out of the house is a win. Let’s be real—half the cost of a store-bought, single cup of coffee could almost cover multiple quantities of this box. The environmentally conscious should also find value in the responsibility mark McCafe attaches to its coffee sourcing. Still considering that personal taste varies, trial packs could be an attractive way for McCafe to market this directly to hesitant buyers.

1mtvuy3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1mtvuy3/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_the_second_half_of_my/,AITA for refusing to pay the second half of my share for a bachelorette trip I cant attend??,"
I met Sara about a year ago when we were neighbors. We weren’t super close more like casual coffee/dog walk friends, but eventually I got folded into her circle.

When she invited me to her bachelorette, I was honestly surprised. But I was also excited, since it would be my first girls weekend away since having my daughter. Still, I had some reservations. During planning she said she wanted this trip to be “crazy” since it was her last hurrah, and that she hoped to hook up with guys. I don’t judge what other people do in their relationships, but it honestly turned me off from the group dynamic. I don’t have the luxury of just dropping everything for a wild weekend. If I’m going to spend the time away from my family, I want it to be with good people for a good time, not drama. I had a gut feeling this wasn’t that trip. And this by no means is a “simple” trip… flight alone cost $600 & the Airbnb was about 500 pp which I paid a majority of upfront.

On top of that, I was already nervous about leaving my daughter, who has ongoing health issues. When I first agreed, I was transparent. I told Sara: “If you need the headcount locked, I’ll back out now. Otherwise, we can see how her health progresses.” She told me it was fine to wait and see so I paid the deposit. 

Months later, two big things collided: my daughter’s health still isn’t stable, and husband’s grandmother’s memorial ended up on the same weekend. My husband told me I should still go, that he would handle everything. But since this would’ve been the first time leaving my daughter, I was already uneasy and the idea of him traveling alone with her made it even harder. I told Sara I couldn’t go.

Now she’s insisting I still owe the second half. If the group splits it, it’s around $20 more per person. She told me her friends “can’t afford that,” but honestly if $20 is the dealbreaker, they probably shouldn’t be going on this trip at all? She seemed more upset about the math than about anything I was going through. When I tried to explain how tough things have been, she said, “I think I am being empathetic, this is supposed to be a fun time for me and I’m stressed and being understanding about the fact that you can’t go because of your daughter.” To me, that just sounded incredibly self-centered.

Part of me wants to just pay it to avoid drama. But I’ve done girls trips before, & people drop out sometimes. It happens. It’s  not like I’m leaving them to cover hundreds of extra dollars. My friends I’ve vented to all said the same: just have them figure it out. I’m not asking for my deposit back. I already feel guilty about the whole situation. To make things even more awkward, she sent me a message saying I should tell the group myself. I barely know most of these girls? 

Meanwhile, my family has thousands in medical expenses for my daughter’s care. One day, maybe Sara will understand, but right now, it feels like she’s incapable of seeing past her own weekend. So Redditt…. AITA?",55,1755545190.0,AmItheAsshole,70,0.86,False

1mtvtbu,https://www.reddit.com/r/MasterPCreviews/comments/1mtvtbu/explore_if_the_best_usb_flash_drive_is_the_centon/,Explore if the Best USB Flash Drive is the Centon DataStick Pro,"Navigating the sea of flash drives can be overwhelming, but I recently got my hands on the Centon S1-U3P6-1T, a 1TB USB 3.2 Gen1 Flash Drive, and dove headfirst into testing it in my daily life. From transferring massive photo libraries to backing up work presentations, I made it my go-to storage solution for over a month. My experiences with this compact device were enlightening and, admittedly, pleasantly surprising. However, there were a few quirks to keep in mind if you’re considering making it your next storage device.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing I noticed when pulling this flash drive out of its packaging was just how sleek and compact it is. With dimensions of 2.41 x 0.73 x 0.31 inches, this tiny aluminum casing is both sturdy and lightweight, making it easy to carry around without the constant fear of damage. The minimalist black design screams professionalism, and as someone who attends client meetings, I appreciated the aesthetic. The durable aluminum casing also handled my clumsy moments like a champ—it survived a drop onto my tiled kitchen floor without so much as a scratch. Still, the lack of any protective cap for the USB plug had me a bit nervous about potential dust or debris, especially when it danced at the bottom of my bag.  

**Performance and Speed**  
As promised, the USB 3.2 technology delivered exceptional performance. It's advertised as offering speeds up to 10x faster than USB 2.0, and my testing didn’t disappoint. Large transfers, like a 50GB batch of high-resolution photographs, took what felt like no time compared to my older drives. Older USB 2.0 models would have had me biting my nails waiting for the progress bar to inch forward, but with this one, I was done and sipping coffee before I knew it. Backward compatibility with USB 2.0 is also a plus, particularly when I needed to plug it into my mom’s older PC. That said, if you’re primarily working with older systems, don’t expect the same blazing speed.  

[Don’t miss Centon S1-U3P6-1T deals—check Amazon here.](https://ultimateprinter.com/p/b0btmstcj9/)

**Storage Capacity**  
A full terabyte of storage in something this small is wild. Sending gigantic video files or full software suites across machines no longer required me to juggle between multiple smaller drives. During testing, I stored everything from client presentations to personal video projects, and I appreciated not having to second-guess whether I had enough space. For gamers, this flash drive’s capacity will come in handy for game backups or carrying files between systems. However, for those unfamiliar, you’ll want to occasionally check your drive for data integrity—especially with such a large storage capacity—just in case anything glitches over time.

**Multi-Device Compatibility**  
One standout feature of this flash drive was its versatility. It worked without issue on my PC, MacBook, and an older USB-C laptop using a simple adapter. I even tried plugging it into my smart TV to see if it could play back large 4K video files, and the performance was buttery smooth. While most modern devices should have no issue, it's worth mentioning that users with heavily outdated hardware may need adapters or may encounter limited speed benefits.

**Highlights**  
- Compact and lightweight aluminum design, ideal for travel.  
- Blazing transfer speeds with USB 3.2 technology.  
- Supports an array of devices, from legacy USB systems to modern ones.  
- 1TB capacity for nearly unlimited storage flexibility.  

**Limitations**  
Like every product, a few aspects could be improved:  
- No protective cap leaves the USB plug exposed over time.  
- May require an adapter for USB-C compatibility on certain devices.  
- Performance on older USB 2.0 systems can be hindered.  

**Direct Competitors**  
Comparing this flash drive to something like the SanDisk Extreme Pro gave me a clearer picture of where it stands. The Centon model holds its ground in terms of capacity and cost-effectiveness, offering a reliable alternative to pricier options while matching speed performance under most conditions. On the downside, the Pro model includes encryption software, which can be a handy feature for users managing sensitive files, whereas this drive lacks added security tools. Additionally, brands like Samsung haven’t yet caught up to offering such immense storage capacities at this price, making this Centon option feel like the best bang-for-your-buck choice for general users.

**Price Performance**  
While it might not be on the cheapest end of the USB spectrum, the value you get for its performance and storage capacity is undeniable. Cost-effectiveness shines brightest here. I can think of few situations in which paying slightly more won’t feel worthwhile. For creators, photographers, or anyone managing terabytes of data, upgrading to a device like this is a sound investment. Those merely transferring small files occasionally, however, might find themselves under-utilizing its capabilities.

Sales produced me too much anxiety for me to be sleepy, so I could just do it for 4 months before crashing out. Either way I couldn’t do any of those for a full 12 months cycle.

My main issue is: as soon as I get the hang of it, and i’m not stuttering and anxious anymore, I start falling asleep mid call and no matter what I do (going to the bathroom, doing jumping jacks, dancing on my cubicle, sitting on an very uncomfortable position, drinking copious amounts of coffee, iced cold water on my face, slapping my face, biting my hand, internal scream) I keep going off.
I really cannot allow that to happen in this job over all the others because this job requires ALL my 3 neurons to do it and in this job I am payed better than in any of the others with more freedoms than any of the others.

I’m not sleeping very well but this has nothing to do with nighttime sleeping itself, because as soon as I’m out of the call I’m not sleepy anymore until the next one comes. And even if I sleep a good amount of hours this still happens.

Synopsis: A guilt-ridden journalist battling sobriety follows a missing girl’s trail to a remote desert town, where he uncovers a coven of witches preparing for an ancient ritual.

Chapter length: 3,155 words

Genre: Mystery, horror

Trigger warning: Drug use, death

      The first thing I did Monday was vomit. My apartment, draped in shadow from the dark city, was illuminated only by the static on the tv screen I had left on as I nodded off on the couch. The coffee table was littered with the residue of my relapse that I swore would only last a night, but had turned into a weeklong affair. The light of the answering machine on the hallway table flashed red, indicating that Matt had called again, I assume to confirm our Tuesday morning meeting.
     The clock on the wall read half past eleven as I cleaned myself up in the kitchen sink, although no amount of scrubbing would remove the stains from the front of my shirt. I was expected around midnight and so decided to throw on a coat to hide the filth and made my way from the third story down to my van. 
     The crisp Seattle air nipped at the back of my neck as I stepped out of the building; spring had arrived and with it, the rain. The drops bouncing off the hood of my canvas coat provided a comfortable lulling sensation akin to the static of the television. The small parking lot was surprisingly empty for it being so late on a Monday, and my van sat at the far end, near the only other car in the lot. Surprisingly, it hadn’t been ticketed in the weeks I’d abandoned it there.
     The message Matt left me last week played over in my head as I drove through the city. His reassurance didn’t help, although the fact I hadn’t been investigated proved his loyalty, but still, the paranoia creeped into my mind over the last five weeks. I drove carefully, taking side streets when I could, dodging the areas I knew cops liked to hang out in, and once I arrived on the north side I knew I was in the clear. No one cares what happens on the north side.

Most budget TWS threads just copy marketing nonsense (""immersive bass!"") instead of actually showing whether the drivers can handle proper phase alignment or if the case battery will last a full work week. Rather than throwing another massive tier list at you, I'm focusing on **three pairs that keep showing up in measurement data, teardown photos, and actual user reports**.

All cost well under $90, they're from smaller brands that aren't blowing their budget on Super Bowl commercials, and most importantly - **they all stay within ±6 dB of the IEC target through the mids** when you measure them properly on a 711 coupler. None are perfect, and I'll tell you exactly what's wrong with each one.

# 3. TAGRY X08 - Battery beast with safe tuning

**The numbers that matter**

* 13mm triple-layer dynamic driver - pretty big for this price range 
* Playback: **6 hours per bud, 60 hours total** with the 470mAh case reserve 
* Bluetooth 5.0 (SBC/AAC), IPX5 splash rating, Qi wireless case, LED battery readout

**What the measurements actually show**

On a Clone 711 coupler, the X08 has a **sub-bass bump of about 6dB at 80Hz**, a mild 2dB dip around 450Hz, and a **broad 4-8kHz shelf that peaks at +4dB**. Channel matching stays within ±1dB up to 10kHz, so stereo imaging doesn't drift when you're listening to music with panning effects. Distortion only hits 1% above 105dB SPL, which is way louder than anyone should be listening anyway.

**Where it actually works well**

That bigger driver keeps distortion low, so kick drums sound clean instead of like cardboard. Voices don't get that weird ""hollow"" sound because the upper mids aren't scooped out. The LED battery readout on the case is genuinely useful - no more guessing how much juice you have left on a long train ride.

**The real downsides**

Isolation maxes out at about -20dB around 2kHz. Fine for blocking out office air conditioning, not so great against subway screeching. The microphone is okay indoors but picks up every bit of wind - there's no real noise cancellation here. Also, the case wells are pretty shallow, so if you have bigger fingers, you'll be doing the pinch-and-wiggle dance every time you want to take them out.

If you need crazy long battery life and don't want to mess with EQ, the X08 is surprisingly well-balanced for commuting - just don't expect ANC or high-quality codecs.

# 2. T-90 BoomSounZ - Gym-focused with punchy bass

**The specs**

* Dynamic driver (they won't say how big)
* **6 hours playback, 300mAh case, 200 hours standby**
* ENC mic array, low-latency gaming mode, IPX6 rating, Bluetooth 5.3

**How they actually sound**

The T-90 goes for a ""fun"" sound: about **+8dB at 90Hz**, a dip near 600Hz, and a **3kHz bump to make vocals cut through**. Above 8kHz the energy drops off pretty hard - partly because of codec limits, partly because the driver starts breaking up - so cymbals and hi-hats sit way back in the mix. But **distortion stays under 0.8% through 1k-4kHz** at 94dB SPL, so guitars don't turn to mush when things get heavy.

**What they're actually good for**

The ear hooks keep the angle stable when you're running, so you don't lose bass mid-stride. The noise cancellation on calls cuts about **18dB of background HVAC noise** from your voice, which is handy if you're taking calls between sets. The gaming mode drops latency to about 86ms in Call of Duty Mobile - not as good as wired, but noticeably better than regular Bluetooth.

**Where they fall short**

Six-hour runtime means marathon cyclists will need to hit the case mid-ride. Codec support stops at basic SBC, so you're stuck with that 328kbps ceiling. The treble rolloff hides background hiss but also kills that ""air"" in the sound - jazz cymbals sound muffled. Plus the ear tips are proprietary oval shapes, so if you lose one, you're hunting on eBay.

If you need a **secure, sweat-proof fit and extra bass for workouts**, the T-90 gets the job done - just don't expect wide soundstage or endless battery.

# 1. TREBLAB X3 Pro - The clear winner with aptX and insane battery

**What you're getting**

* **14.2mm carbon-composite dynamic driver**
* **9 hours single charge, 145 hours total** (case doubles as a power bank)
* Bluetooth 5.3 with **aptX**, AAC, SBC support, IPX5 rating, four ENC mics, ear-hook design

**The measurement story**

On the same 711 setup, the X3 Pro follows something pretty close to the Harman 2024 target: **+5dB shelf in the bass, flat lower mids, and a controlled 6.5kHz sparkle** that keeps harsh sounds in check. Channel balance is tight (±0.8dB to 10kHz), and **distortion never breaks 0.4% at 94dB SPL** because that oversized driver barely has to work. aptX pushes average bitrate to about 352kbps, so complex music has room to breathe where SBC would turn everything to mush.

**Why these win**

The battery math is crazy but real: nine hours per charge, plus fifteen more charges from the **2,600mAh** case gives you 145 hours total - and people have actually verified this works. The hooks mean the seal stays stable even during box jumps, so bass doesn't disappear. Call quality is genuinely above average: four-mic noise cancellation cuts **22dB of coffee shop noise** in proper tests. Plus the buds stay cool - no ""thermal drift"" that pushes the frequency response around after long listening sessions.

**The actual problems**

The case is chunky - like two AirPods Pro cases stacked on top of each other. Your jeans pockets won't be happy. The touch controls are super sensitive - adjust the hook mid-song and you might accidentally skip tracks. There's no mobile app, so you're stuck with your phone's EQ if you want to tweak the bass. None of these are deal-breakers, but worth knowing before you buy.

If you want **wide soundstage, aptX quality, and legitimately ridiculous battery life**, the X3 Pro is the obvious choice under $90 right now.

# How They Compare Side-by-Side

| Feature | TAGRY X08 | T-90 BoomSounZ | TREBLAB X3 Pro |
|---|---|---|---|
| Driver size | 13mm | (not published) dynamic | 14.2mm |
| Single charge | 6 hours | 6 hours | 9 hours |
| Case reserve | 54 hours | 24 hours | 136 hours |
| Codecs | SBC / AAC | SBC only | SBC / AAC / aptX |
| Mic setup | basic CVC | dual ENC | quad ENC |
| Weight per bud | 0.14 oz | 0.18 oz | 0.22 oz |
| Fit security | shallow tip | hook + tip | ear-hook frame |
| Isolation u/1kHz | ≈-20dB | ≈-23dB | ≈-24dB |


None of these are going to beat Sennheiser's IE 200 or the Truthear Zero as reference headphones. **But if your budget caps at ninety bucks and you want measurements that don't look like a roller coaster, these three are your best bets this year.**

* **X08** for commuters who hate dealing with charging cables
* **T-90** for gym sessions where secure fit matters more than perfect treble
* **X3 Pro** for anyone who wants near-Harman tuning, aptX clarity, and a case that could probably jump-start a car

I work as a guard in the first block of prison No.15. My job is that I am the only one who remotely controls the opening of the doors to the block. The work is boring, but not difficult, and allows me to do my own thing on my phone almost all the time.

My partner and I played a game where we counted how many guards, prisoners, and administration employees entered and left the block. The one with the most people leaves a cup of hot coffee for the next shift at their own expense.

A couple of weeks ago, I started to notice that there were significantly more prisoners in the block than there were available places in the block. I reviewed the records several times, asked the administration, but to no avail — they insist that I am making it up. However, I am absolutely sure of what I see.

Please help, what should I do? I sleep poorly, I have started to fear working the night shift, and I have started drinking.

I've read about people grinding horizontally to a 45 degree angle to slow feed the beans into the burrs. 

I have been doing this for a little while and noticed some muddy, over extracted flavours that I had attributed to other factors such as agitation, grind size, or water temp. 

Fast forward to trying to dial in some Washed Equadorian beans and the first few brews we're drawing down incredibly slowly, up to 7 minutes. And a more straight coffee flavour rather than bright and juicy which is my aim. 

I accidently ground at an angle closer to vertical and that brought the draw down down to about 5 minutes. 

I'm now reading that grinding at such an angle (45 to horizontal) can lead to beans remaining in the burrs too long and increasing fines. 

What angle do other K6 owners grind at? 

The method I have landed on as standard, which has gotten me as close to the flavours I want is this: 

V60 two cups (V60 filter in an Origami M, in a Chemex):
27g coffee to 500g water
96 clicks on the K6
92c water temp

Bloom 60g water - very slight swirl to flatten bed - 45 seconds

Very slow to 500g as little agitation as possible

Slight swirl to re-flatten bed

Slightly stir the top of the water with back of a spoon to push fines in water to the sides of filter. 

And tips to improve brew for vibrant, bright, juicy cups very welcome. 

Thanks

We had a lab together so after the first day of class we got assigned into different groups but out of class we only talked once or twice so we were more like acquaintances. But during class, sometimes I’d catch her looking over at me a lot to see what I was doing or sometimes if the prof made a joke she’d look at me and laugh or try and see my reaction even though we were pretty far apart and in different groups. So I was like maybe she wanted to be friends.

After the quarter ended, I DM’d her on Instagram asking if she wanted to get coffee or boba sometime over the summer since we’re both from the same city. She responded super enthusiastically and said “I WOULD LOVE TO!!” and thanked me for asking, but said she was busy until July. I replied that I’d be free after July because I had summer quarter until then and she left that on delivered cause I think she has her read receipts off so I just left it alone after that.

Then in August, I posted a video of me singing a cover (I hadn’t posted in like 6 months), and she replied to my story out of nowhere saying “U ATE SO HARD” and “BRO UR SO GOOD AT SINGING.” I just said “aww thanks girl ur so sweet” and didn’t think too much of it.

A week later, I decided to follow up and ask if she was still free and wanted to hang out before summer ended but the next morning she deactivated her account for a few hours, then reactivated it and removed her profile pic and all her story highlights. Now her profile looks completely blank, but she’s still following me and I still follow her and I can see she’s still active and liking other people’s posts and things like that.

I checked that she didn’t block me or restrict me or unfollow me or anything like that and I saw on LinkedIn that she started an internship recently, so maybe that’s part of it… but the timing is so specific that it kind of feels like I made her uncomfortable.

I just don’t know what to make of this like is this her way of saying she’s not interested? I can’t tell if this is just like two things that happened to happen at the same time but have nothing to do with each other or should I just ignore her in person and pretend like she’s a stranger?

I wake up to a different kind of weight. Not the crushing grief that pressed me down before, but something lighter, sharper, like the air finally knows we’re not just crawling anymore—we’re standing.

The cot squeaks as I get up. My shoulders ache, my legs stiff, but that’s fine. Pain means I’m still moving.

The hallway smells faintly of reheated stew and damp concrete. When I step into the common area, I see the usual suspects—Mom, Zula leaning against the wall like she’s about to pick a fight with the room itself, Tom and Carmen muttering about chores, Tasha stretching her arms, sparks flickering faintly across her fingers. Jerrod’s there too, already awake, his hair a mess but his eyes sharp.

“Morning,” I say, forcing a little energy into my voice. It earns me a few nods.

The memory of Zenos’ last briefing lingers. The way he said Gabe’s pushing from the Red Zone, trying to stir the people. The way he told us Ulisses and Dário would work angles inside the Association. A plan that finally feels like more than just hiding.

I glance at Tasha. “You think it’s gonna work? Gabe and Zenos’ thing. Guga, Nath, pulling in others to our side. You think they can actually get more heroes with us?”

She tilts her head, considering, then shrugs. “Zenos said Ulisses and Dário would grease the path. Trainees, low ranks… heroes who aren’t fully theirs. If anyone can open that door, it’s them.”

Something warms in my chest. Hope. Small, dangerous, but alive. “Then we’ve got a chance.” I grin despite myself. “I’m excited.”

“Excited?” Zula’s voice cuts in, sharp as glass. “Eat, idiot. You’ll faint in training if you don’t put something in your stomach.”

I roll my eyes but head toward the food.

That’s when Samuel pipes up, voice dripping with mockery. “This guy says he’s gonna be the strongest. Wakes up at nine and still takes his sweet time before training. What a future champion.”

I snort, not giving him the satisfaction of a glare. “Don’t start, Samuel. I’ll eat. Then I’ll still crush you in training.”

He smirks, shadows already twitching around him like they’re laughing with him.

I grab my plate and dig in, because I’m not about to show up hungry when the real work begins.



\*\*\*

Out here, the air tastes like dust and metal, sharp on the tongue. The training field’s all concrete and echoes, the sun hitting hard enough to sting my skin.

Samuel’s shadows circle like wolves, snapping close enough to graze my neck. “Faster,” he snarls. “Stronger. Or die slower.”

I don’t hesitate. I pull from the cuts on my arms, feel the blood surge hot in my veins. I push it—circulation accelerated, muscles fed, lungs burning like I swallowed fire. My fist slams forward, the ground cracking when I connect with the shadow. It bursts, but another takes its place instantly.

Speed. Power. More than before.

Tasha flashes past me, her body a crackling silhouette. Lightning arcs from her hands, scattering across Samuel’s clones, each strike louder than a whip crack. She’s sharper now, more controlled. Less wild sparks, more precision.

Jerrod roars as his fists glow red-hot, the air shimmering around them. When he punches, the smell of burning stone fills my nose. He’s sweating buckets, face twisted with effort, but he doesn’t stop.

“Good,” Giulia calls from the side, her tone hard as steel. “But don’t think for a second this is enough. Again.”

“Again,” Samuel echoes, almost mocking, but the way his shadows hit harder proves he means it.

I dodge low, legs screaming, and counter with a kick fueled by the rush in my veins. My heel slams into the ground, sending a ripple of force through the concrete. For a second, I almost believe I can keep this pace forever.

But my lungs burn, my arms ache, my head spins. This isn’t easy. It’s not meant to be.

“Push through it,” I mutter to myself, teeth gritted. “Stronger. Faster. No excuses.”

Zula barks from the sideline, “Stop talking to yourself and hit harder, brat!”

Tom chuckles, Carmen sighs, but they’re watching too. Watching us bleed for something better.

And as sweat blinds me, as pain digs into every joint, I know one thing: we’re not broken anymore. We’re climbing back, inch by inch.

And next time they come for us, they won’t find the same kids they left bleeding in the dirt.



\*\*\*

Blood hammers in my ears as I force it through me faster, hotter. My veins feel like fire lines, ready to split. I drag it into my fists, into my legs, every pump of my heart driving me harder.

“Come on!” I roar, and slam both palms forward. Compressed streams of blood shoot like scarlet lances, slicing through three shadows at once. They burst in oily smoke, but Samuel only smirks, pulling more from the ground.

“Better,” he says, voice taunting. “But you’ll die before you kill me at this pace.”

Tasha crackles beside me, sparks snapping like a storm about to break. She thrusts her hands outward and a wave of blue lightning leaps across the field, tearing through the dark clones. The smell of ozone floods my nose, sharp and clean. Her hair floats for an instant, eyes glowing with control. She’s stronger than last weeksharper.

Then Giulia is there. Too fast. A blur that smashes into my side and knocks the wind from me before I even register the hit. I stagger, coughing, while her voice cuts through.

“You think enemies wait for you to prepare? Again!”

She’s already moving, hitting Jerrod across the back before he can react. He roars, fists blazing, swinging wild. The impact scorches the concrete, but she’s gone before it lands.

“Focus!” she shouts. “Anticipate!”

I grit my teeth, feeling blood slide down my arm from reopened cuts. I grip it, whip it into the air, and it hardens mid-swing into a crimson blade. I slash wide, catching a shadow and making it shriek before dispersing. My chest heaves. My heart feels like it’ll tear itself out of my ribs.

Giulia dashes at me again. This time I meet her halfway. My blade whirls, missing her head by inches, but it forces her to pivot. Tasha seizes the moment, firing a bolt that scorches the ground near her foot. For the first time, Giulia actually grins.

“That’s it,” she says, hair wild around her face. “You’re learning.”

But I can’t celebrate. My legs give out, and I drop to one knee, gasping. Tasha’s trembling too, sweat dripping, sparks still crawling over her arms. Jerrod is bent double, fists smoking, coughing like he’s about to throw up his lungs.

Samuel surveys the wreckage, his shadows fading. “Enough,” he says finally. “If you push further, you’ll just snap. You’re not ready for death yet.”

The words sting, but I can’t even talk back. Not this time.



\*\*\*

The walk back feels longer than the fight. Every step is heavy, my body screaming. The concrete halls of the bunker smell like sweat and old metal, but at least it’s cooler inside.

We collapse at the tables, grabbing water, plates, anything to keep from passing out. I’m still rubbing the blood from my arms when Samuel drops beside me, smug as always.

“You held better today,” he admits. Then his smirk sharpens. “Zenos thinks you’re finally worth risking.”

I look up at him, throat raw. “What does that mean?”

“It means you’ve got work outside these walls,” he says, leaning back. “Zenos got word from Ulisses. The Association just pulled in a fresh recruit—a rookie hero. Your job? Watch him. From the shadows. See what kind of spine he’s got, if he’s another puppet or if he could be turned.”

Tasha, still toweling sweat off her arms, frowns. “So we just… spy? No contact?”

Samuel’s eyes glint like a knife. “Not yet. Just observe. Zenos wants to know his nature before he wastes time. You find weakness, you find doubt—then maybe he becomes ours. Or maybe you kill him later. Depends on what you see.”

I nod slowly, the ache in my muscles drowned by a new thrum of adrenaline. A mission. Not just training, not just bleeding in circles. Something real.

“Good,” I mutter, clenching my fists. “Finally.”

Samuel’s smirk widens. “Don’t screw it up, future strongest.”



\*\*\*

**Leo**

The door opens. After days, weeks?—I don’t even know anymore, I finally step outside. My legs feel weak, my skin prickling against the air like I’m not supposed to be out here.

Caroline stands at my left, posture sharp, calculating eyes already fixed on me like I’m a subject under glass. James is at my right. Always James. His presence presses closer than the walls ever did.

“This is a step forward, Leo,” James says, his voice calm, warm, practiced. “We want you to see. To know what we are truly building here.”

I don’t answer. My mouth is dry. My eyes keep darting around, half-expecting guards, half-expecting chains. But instead there are halls, wide and clean, lined with polished steel and light panels that hum gently. No stains. No shadows. Too perfect.

My thoughts spiral. Is this the truth? Or another stage, another performance? Am I being paraded, or… offered something?

I keep walking, because stopping feels impossible.



\*\*\*

We pass through reinforced doors into a wide chamber that echoes with shouts, thuds, the sound of power unleashed.

Dozens of heroes spar, from raw trainees stumbling through drills to veterans whose movements are polished into something terrifyingly beautiful. One young woman hurls arcs of ice against three opponents at once; another man bends the ground beneath his partner’s feet until he collapses.

James gestures at the field, his smile soft. “Here, there’s space for everyone. Weak, strong, subtle, loud… every gift matters. We nurture them all. We don’t waste lives—we shape them.”

I watch. Bodies crash, sweat flies, sparks crackle. Part of me is impressed. Another part whispers: cages with polished bars are still cages.

Caroline approaches a man with cropped black hair and a tablet in his hand. “Eduardo,” she says, tone professional but edged with urgency. “How are preparations for the central prison containment?”

Eduardo taps his screen, glances up. “They’re ready. The team is assembled and waiting for green light.”

“Good,” Caroline replies. “Accelerate the timetable. Civilians are in danger every hour we delay.”

Danger. Civilians. Innocent lives. The words twist inside me. She says them like they’re real, like they mean something. And I don’t know if I want to believe her.

James leans down slightly, almost conspiratorial. “You see? Every day, missions like these. Not politics. Not cruelty. Rescue. Protection.”

I swallow hard. Is that what this is? Or is it what they want me to see?



\*\*\*

The scent hits me before the sight—alcohol, medicine, and iron. We step into the healers’ sector and I freeze. Rows of cots stretch out, every one occupied. Men and women with bandaged limbs, scorched skin, pale faces twisted in pain. Some groan softly, others sleep under glowing hands of healers.

Caroline’s voice slices through the silence. “Each one you see here represents a mission carried out. Each wound here means lives saved elsewhere. These scars are the cost of protection.”

James places a hand lightly on my shoulder. The weight of it burns. “They come back broken,” he says softly, “but because they went, families lived. Children lived.” His eyes glisten as if he’s reliving some battle. “We ask much of them. We give much back.”

I can’t look away. It’s… too many. Too real. The sound of shallow breathing, the faint cries. This doesn’t feel staged. Unless… unless even pain can be staged?

But if it’s true if they really saved lives then why did Zenos never speak of it? Why only the rot, the corruption?

My chest feels tight. My thoughts fight each other.



\*\*\*

We enter a chamber of humming machines, walls lined with glowing panels. A man in a dark lab coat turns toward us broad-shouldered, eyes tired but steady.

“Otavio,” James greets, his voice shifting to respect. “Show him.”

Otavio nods. “We’re finalizing adaptive radars for power signatures. Early tests indicate a ninety percent detection rate within urban clusters. We’re also deploying improved suppression systems for high-risk containment facilities.”

Screens light up with simulations: flares of red where powers are detected, steel cages reinforced with shimmering barriers.

I blink, jaw tight. This is… real. Huge. “You use all this against villains?” The word tastes bitter.

“Against threats,” Otavio corrects. His tone is clipped, almost defensive.

Caroline gestures toward a woman who steps forward Leticia, she introduces herself, another counselor, her eyes sharp as scalpels. “And beyond weapons,” she adds, “our research saves lives. Medications derived from unique power interactions treatments for diseases born of mutation. For those whose powers destroy them from the inside. For children who age backward every time they use their gifts. For families poisoned by uncontrolled auras.”

Her voice is steady, clinical, almost cold, but the words bite deep. I picture faces I’ve never seen, people broken by powers they never asked for.

James leans in again, his whisper meant only for me. “Do you see, Leo? Zenos never showed you this. He never told you what we build, what we heal. He wanted you to see only his truth. But the world is wider. It is more.”

I stare at the glowing screens, at the machines humming like hearts outside bodies. My head throbs.

Are they saving lives, or are they building cages? Are they healers, or are they scientists dressing wounds they caused?

I don’t know. I don’t know.

But for the first time, I feel the white room behind me fading. The world is larger now.

And I have to decide how to walk in it.



\*\*\*

We enter another wing, quieter. No clang of training weights, no cries of pain from healers. Just murmurs measured, rehearsed.

The air smells different here. Ink, coffee, paper. The walls are lined with screens showing live broadcasts, interviews, speeches. Behind glass, men and women sit at long tables, typing, adjusting feeds, rehearsing words in front of cameras.

Caroline gestures with one gloved hand. “This is where messages are shaped. The bridge between the Association and the world. Heroes save lives, but people must also believe in heroes. Without trust, chaos spreads faster than any villain.”

On one screen, I see footage of soldiers evacuating civilians. On another, a polished anchor narrates statistics rescues, arrests, containment rates. The voice is calm, authoritative.

James lowers his tone, almost a whisper, almost fatherly: “The truth of a hero’s work means nothing if no one knows it. If fear takes root, everything collapses. We can’t let the people lose hope.”

I swallow hard. Propaganda. Or protection? Is there a difference? If lives were saved, does the story matter or the way it’s told?

Someone behind the glass chuckles at a joke, then returns to typing. My chest tightens. Behind every heroic headline, there’s this. Always this.

I glance at Caroline. Her eyes are cold, assessing, like she’s watching how deep the hook is sinking into me.



\*\*\*

We leave the humming of screens and step into another hall, broader, darker. James straightens, his voice carrying a weight I don’t like.

“There’s someone you need to meet.”

The doors part. And he’s there. Bartolomeu.

I know the face. Everyone does. Silver hair cropped sharp, a grin cut like a blade. His presence fills the room before he even speaks, heavy as thunderclouds.

“Well, well,” Bartolomeu booms, striding forward, his coat brushing the floor. “So this is the little lamb. Almair’s favorite grandson. The Association’s newest jewel.”

His hand clasps mine before I can react, strong enough to crush bone but careful enough not to. His eyes glint with something between amusement and hunger.

I freeze. A counselor. A big hero. For me?

“You’ll be training under me,” Bartolomeu declares, loud enough for everyone in the hall to hear. “We’ll make you into a hero worthy of the blood you carry. Stronger than doubts. Sharper than fear.” He leans close, his voice dropping into something harsher. “No room for hesitation, boy. Hesitation kills.”

My throat tightens. My heart hammers. Of all people… him?

James smiles, his hand settling heavy on my back. “It is an honor, Leo. Few are given this chance.”

Honor. Chance. Prison. Trap.

I force a nod. My mind spins. Why Bartolomeu? To train me or to break me? To sharpen me into their weapon, or to test how much I’ll bend before I shatter?

I can’t read his grin. I can’t read their eyes.

But one thing is clear: I am in deeper than I thought.



\*\*\*

Caroline’s hand rests lightly on my arm, her smile perfectly shaped but empty of warmth. “We’ll leave you with Bartolomeu now, Leo. Tomorrow will be the first step of your real journey.”

James lingers longer, his eyes heavy on me, like he wants me to see him as something more than a guide. “Rest,” he says, voice low, almost tender. “You’ll need strength. I’ll be watching with pride.”

Their words sink like stones, and then they’re gone, footsteps fading down the hall, leaving me with Bartolomeu.

“Come,” he says, no nonsense. His hand on my shoulder is iron, steering me through corridors and lifts until we emerge into one of the towers. Higher. Cleaner. Quieter. The air smells faintly of polished steel and citrus.

“This will be your home now,” Bartolomeu announces as the door slides open. The room yawns wide before me. Too wide. A bed big enough to drown in. Walls of glass catching the city lights. Plates of food laid out on a table like a feast. For a moment, I can’t breathe.

Bartolomeu’s grin flashes. “Eat well. Tomorrow will be hard, boy. I want to see what you really are.” His voice sharpens at the edge. “Don’t disappoint.”

And then he’s gone, the door shutting with a quiet hiss that feels too final.



\*\*\*

I step forward, half-expecting the floor to swallow me. Then something moves. A figure unfolds from the wall sleek, silver, humming softly. A machine.

“Greetings, Leo Bardos,” it says, voice smooth and neutral. “I am your assigned assistant unit. I will provide food, cleaning, and support as required.”

I stagger back, heart racing. “You… talk?”

“I communicate,” the machine answers simply. Its head tilts, studying me with empty eyes. “Would you like to begin with nourishment or orientation of amenities?”

For a second, all I can do is laugh. A thin, cracked sound that bounces off the glass. A robot servant. Luxury. All of this… for me? Or for the role they want me to play?

I wave it off, mumbling, “No… just leave me.” The machine bows and recedes into its alcove, silent as stone.



\*\*\*

I sit on the edge of the bed, staring at the feast untouched. My stomach growls, but the hunger feels hollow. My head is heavier than my body.

Everything I saw today presses in on me the healers saving hundreds, the researchers fighting against cursed powers, the propaganda rooms keeping people calm, the technology meant to protect. Proof stacked on proof that the Association isn’t just monsters in suits.

And yet.

The screams in Sector 12 still echo. The fire, the blood, my mother. Clint’s betrayal. Luke’s strings digging into my mind. Isaac’s flames burning everything.

Zenos showed me horrors too. But he also fought beside me, bled beside me. He told me about powers that consumed their users, about saving people even when it cost him. Were those lies? Or truths carved to make me trust?

I press my hands into my face. My thoughts are knives. Every truth looks like a trick. Every trick looks like it could be true.

So what do I do?

The bed beneath me is too soft. The food too rich. The silence too loud. None of it feels real.

There’s only one path, I know that now. I can’t turn back. The only way is forward. To watch. To listen. To play along. To see what reveals itself.

If Almair wants me to be his lamb, then I’ll follow. For now. But I won’t stop asking: who here is lying to me? Who here is using me?

Hey everyone,  
Just wanted to share my experience and some strange symptoms since starting Adderall—maybe it helps someone, or others have been through the same.

About me:

Strict diet: high-protein, low-carb, lots of fruits/veggies, no alcohol/smoking/coffee, no sweets or deserts , I have Mild psoriasis (elbows only, no joint pain), past right golfer’s elbow (90% healed pre-meds), BP pre meds 108/50 , resting pulse 49-51

My mom (52F) has been married to my stepdad (55M) for 15 years. They have what I thought was a stable relationship. But last week, she dropped a bomb on me over coffee: she wants to leave him.

I was shocked but tried to be supportive, until she said she’s planning to do it at my wedding.

Her plan? Wait until the family is together, pull him aside during the reception, and “finally tell him it’s over.” She said it’s the “perfect opportunity” since everyone will already be there to “support her.”

I told her absolutely not, that my wedding is not her stage for a breakup. She got defensive and said I was being selfish for not letting her “finally be free.”

Now I don’t even know if I want her at my wedding. How do you tell your own mom that she can’t turn your wedding day into her divorce party?",78,1755543721.0,TwoHotTakes,60,0.93,False

I also realise there's a tempting opportunity to ratchet that up when most of your audience doesn't have firsthand experience of living somewhere. Plus, I'm really not particularly patriotic – as a country we're only just emerging from the trenches after a prolonged period of shit government.

***But*** even so, I do find it distracting sometimes how Connor, Garnt, and sometimes Chris when he's a guest, go wildly off the mark in quite how grim they portray the UK.

I just watched an episode in which Connor says ""London restaurants are shit"", in a segment about high quality/Michelin-level eating, and it's like......beyond social media stereotypes about the average Briton's diet....that's demonstrably untrue and it's unlikely he's experienced them all that often. In the past he's talked about his short time living in London as him basically eating ramen and playing video games in a flat in Zone 9 and doing nothing else. I've lived in the city for 12 years and every day there's a buzzing new, affordable restaurant opening which is focussed on a different global cuisine. I think most British viewers are also aware that Chris has also admitted to having surprisingly little experience of London. Their experience of the country often appears to be – airport, grab a Starbucks or McDonalds, hotel, filming, quickly see family out in the sticks, fly out. It's hardly 'go find some chill Zone 2 coffee shops and a food market'.

I'm just curious if anyone else gets mildly annoyed by just how much they ham it up sometimes, considering the size of their audience and them having lived outside of the country in some cases for a decade or more? It's less the idea that they've got controversial or basic views, it's more that against the premise of the show they actually don't really challenge each other on it when one of them is like ""there's absolutely nothing enjoyable in the UK and nowhere you'd go on a long weekend"", and it's clear they've decided there's more laughs to be had out of Croydon rather than the Lakes, Edinburgh, Cornwall etc.",0,1755543672.0,TrashTaste,16,0.3,False

1mtv3pc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1mtv3pc/coworker_always_wants_to_hang_outside_of_work/,Coworker ALWAYS wants to hang outside of work,"okay so I started this job in nov. ish. It’s my first real job post grad, and I work on a very small team. I have a coworker who shares the same role as me and we share the same tasks. At first I felt like it was going well, we were getting along pretty well, but then I noticed they did not like how I would get along with our supervisor. For reference, the team is literally just my coworker and supervisor. My second day, my coworker proceeded to dump all of this drama onto me of stuff that had happened between our supervisor and them in the past. I was super empathetic and compassionate, but I feel like they expected me to be cold and rude to our supervisor when I literally just started this job. Like ummmm HELLO. anyways so I would still be friendly with her and we would talk about our personal lives in our 1 to 1s. 

Since the beginning I feel like I was expected to replace his previous colleague whose job I filled once she left. Be his smoke buddy and friend. For reference, he is 29(M) and gay, I am 23(F). It’s not some sort of creepy thing just he’s trying to be my friend. But I don’t smoke, I don’t enjoy it. I also have been working since I was 16 years old, and I learned my lessons early that your coworkers are not your friends!!!!! Sometimes they can be, but ultimately I am inclined to keep them at arms length and separate my personal and my work life. 

Okay so, once he started to notice I wasn’t gonna be weird to my boss for no reason he started to be incredibly rude to me. She took me for coffee once and I got a bagel; and when I came back he told me I was selfish and only thought of myself. Because I didn’t offer him something… which I felt bad about but he has also never paid me back for any coffee I have gotten him and he literally will nickel and dime me. So I don’t feel obligated to constantly ask him if he wants a coffee too. 

The coffee thing happened probably in like Feb/March. Since then more rude things have been said to me, and I have done my best to manage. He tends to gossip a lot and so I know he has definitely talked shit about me to other people in other departments. But he loves to pretend like he is a straightforward individual and that drives me crazy!!! Mostly because I have noticed people treat me differently than when they first met me, people in distant departments who were mostly his friends already. 

We were at a birthday dinner last week for a colleague in another department, and I got there like 10 mins late. He proceeds to say he’s so glad I came and implying that I don’t like to go to hang outs, when I literally said I was going to this earlier today. He says we never hang out after work and that he’s hoping to change that. THIS ISNT YOUR BIRTHDAY DINNER. that’s what’s crazy. 

I know he means well, but he has literally talked shit about almost everyone of his friends to me so why would I wanna be his friend 😭 I also don’t think he thinks of it as talking shit so that’s why it just doesn’t click. 

ALSO, he always expects to eat lunch with me so I stay in the office and pretend like I’m not leaving to eat lunch so I don’t have to 😭

Either way, I don’t really like to hang out with my coworkers especially when we are completely different ages and don’t have much in common. 

Does anyone have any advice how I can make this boundaries more clear without interfering with my daily work life? I do have to collaborate with him often and I just feel like I’ve been trying to be friendlier to make that better but I ultimately do not want to be his friend. I tried and I think he is probably a wonderful friend to someone, just not the friend for me. ",7,1755543556.0,AITAH,9,0.89,False

1mtv36m,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1mtv36m/explore_why_the_keurig_kmini_coffee_maker_review/,Explore why the Keurig K-Mini coffee maker review highlights small yet powerful brewing!,"Testing the **Keurig K-Mini Single Serve K-Cup Pod Coffee Maker** has been an enjoyable experience, and the product delivers on its promise of convenience and simplicity. As someone who relies heavily on caffeine to stay alert during work, a functional and efficient coffee maker is essential in my daily routine. The Keurig K-Mini offers a compact design, making it an appealing choice for tight spaces—a feature I've grown to appreciate in my small kitchen.

**Compact Design Perfect for Any Setting**  
I was immediately struck by how slim and lightweight this coffee maker is. Measuring less than 5 inches wide, it easily fit on my kitchen counter without taking up valuable space. The minimalist, Dusty Rose matte finish gives it a contemporary aesthetic that blends well with modern kitchen appliances. The portability is another plus, as I've even used it at my office desk a few times. The cord storage feature keeps things tidy, adding to its portability by making it easy to move around without dangling wires.

**Simple and Efficient Brewing Process**  
With this little machine, brewing coffee is effortless. The process involves adding fresh water to the single-cup reservoir, popping in a K-Cup pod, and pressing the brew button. Within minutes, I had a perfectly brewed 12-ounce cup of coffee in hand. Its compact water reservoir isn't cumbersome, and the energy-efficient auto-off feature shuts the device down 90 seconds after brewing, which is fantastic for someone forgetful like me.

[Check Keurig K-Mini Single Serve K-Cup Pod Coffee Maker price on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b08323nvl1/)  

**Features That Adapt to Your Needs**  
The flexibility in brewing sizes is a major win. I've tested it with small 6-ounce cups for a strong morning coffee and 12-ounce travel mugs for my longer commutes. The removable drip tray makes it travel-mug friendly while ensuring cleanup is a breeze. It's also compatible with the My K-Cup Universal Reusable Coffee Filter, allowing me to brew my own ground coffee rather than relying solely on pre-packaged K-Cups. This feature significantly reduces waste and adds versatility.

**Highlights**  
- Compact size (less than 5 inches wide) fits in small spaces.  
- Cord storage keeps counters clutter-free.  
- Energy-efficient automatic shutoff.  
- Compatible with travel mugs and reusable filters.  

**Limitations**  
Although I adore this coffee maker, there are some aspects worth considering. This is a single-serve machine, which means you’ll need to refill the reservoir with each brew. While it's not a deal-breaker, this extra step might be an annoyance for households with multiple coffee drinkers. Additionally, the lack of advanced features, like temperature control or brew strength settings, could be a drawback for those who prefer customization in their coffee routine.  

- The water reservoir requires refilling for every cup.  
- Limited customizability (no brew strength or temperature control).  

**Alternative Products**  
The market for compact coffee makers is quite competitive. Compared to the Keurig K-Mini, the Nespresso Essenza Mini provides a similar space-saving option but specializes in espresso-based drinks rather than standard coffee. It offers a richer flavor profile but comes with higher upfront costs due to the price of Nespresso capsules. The Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, on the other hand, is more versatile, as it allows both single-serve and pot brewing, making it suitable for larger households. However, its larger design makes it less conducive to tight spaces.

The Keurig K-Mini excels in portability and quick operations. While it lacks some higher-end features found in the alternatives, its straightforward functionality suits anyone looking for a simple and compact solution.

**Affordable Quality**  
For its price point, the Keurig K-Mini feels like a solid investment for individuals or small households. Its energy efficiency, portability, and ease of use align well with what I'd expect from a budget-friendly coffee maker. You’re paying for the convenience of brewing a cup quickly without sacrificing counter space.

Chapter 1One of the female students in the class had never turned in a single assignment, so Stephanie Brogan deducted her participation grade.That afternoon, a group of people vandalized her desk.Her lesson plans were scattered across the floor, and her computer screen was shattered. The thermos water even soaked all the students' theses she'd stayed up late correcting.Stephanie stood there, staring at the mess with shaking fingers.She drew in a deep breath and got ready to confront Amelia Gibson—until she spotted her husband, Edgar Ferguson, in the corner of the teaching building.He had Amelia in his arms, gently wiping away her tears. His voice was soft. ""Don't cry. I've already stood up for you. No one will dare to bully you while I'm around.""Amelia sniffled, her eyes red and puffy. ""Thank you, Mr. Ferguson. Without you, college would've been hell for me. I don't even know how to repay you.""Edgar grinned and brushed her lips. ""Then give me a kiss as thanks. How about that?""She looked bashful for a moment, then hesitated before standing on her tiptoes and gently kissing his lips.""It's just a thank-you,"" she whispered. ""But I don't support this. You have a wife. If you're going to pursue me, I need time.""He smoothed her hair softly. ""Okay. I'll wait.""Stephanie watched from the shadows, cold blood running through her veins.At that moment, she remembered their wedding day. Edgar knelt on one knee on the rose petals, swearing, ""Stephanie, I'll only love you in this life.""That vow felt empty three years later.After Amelia went back to the dorm, Stephanie stumbled to the car, her face drained.Edgar leaned against the front, lighting a cigarette, his face lit by the flame. He looked over, surprised.""Stephanie?""""Edgar."" Her voice quivered. ""When did this start?""Edgar froze for a second, then laughed lightly. He took his time letting out a smoke ring. Even through the haze, his eyes still held that dangerous kind of charm.""Since you've discovered it, no point hiding it,"" he said lazily. ""I only get ten years to fool around. Once I'm old and ugly, there's no going back.""I do love you, Stephanie, but don't expect me to only love you forever. I'll eventually get bored.""Amelia reminds me of how you used to be—young and pure. I'm into that right now. Relax. I'm not divorcing you. After I've had my fun, I'll come back.""Stephanie felt like her heart had been grabbed out of her chest and squeezed repeatedly. ""I can't accept it! If you end things with her now, I can still forgive you.""Edgar frowned, clearly annoyed. ""Enough. I've already made it clear. You're still the one I'll spend most of my life with. So just...""He grabbed her chin, his gaze turning cold. ""Behave. Don't mess with my little lover.""Then, he let go and left.Stephanie stood there, her whole body trembling in shock.She had heard how some rich families worked—where men kept their wives but still messed around with other women. Wealthy heirs like Edgar were dream husbands for a lot of rich girls.But she never imagined he'd turn out like them.Because once upon a time, he truly loved her.He'd gone against his entire family to marry her, a teacher's daughter. He even stood outside her dorm for three days just to get her back. He knew her coffee preferences, the exact date she got cramps every month, and how much she hated rainy days.On their wedding day, he held her hand and solemnly promised in front of everyone that she was the only one he'd ever love.She just didn't expect that promise to break so fast.Stephanie had no clue how she even made it back home.She collapsed on the bed in a daze, soaking her pillow with tears.When she came to, freezing water had already reached her chest.Her eyes shot open. She was trapped inside a huge glass tank, her wrists chained above her. Water was slowly rising around her.Across from her, Edgar was lounging on a leather couch in a crisp suit. With legs crossed, he flipped a lighter open and shut.The flame lit up the sharp edges of his face, but not the coldness in his eyes.""Edgar!"" Stephanie thrashed, splashing water everywhere. ""What are you doing?!""He said coldly, ""You went to Amelia and told her to stay away from me.""He shut the lighter with a snap and stood up, walking toward the tank. ""She blocked me after that. So now, you're getting punished.""Stephanie shook her head wildly, her voice cracking. ""No! I didn't even see her after I got home!""""Still lying?"" Edgar said with a cold smirk, signaling the bodyguard. ""Raise the water.""The tank started filling up faster, and the freezing water climbed like icy fingers around her throat.Stephanie had to lift her chin to breathe. The terror of drowning filled her every breath.Edgar showed no concern for her pain. He just stared coldly as she struggled. ""I told you I love you already. Just give me ten years. I'll come back.""But until then, don't ever hurt Amelia.""With that, he turned and walked off.""Edgar! Edgar—""Her screams faded under the rising water. He never looked back.Every ten minutes, the tank filled a little more. The chill never left her, and neither did the fear.Right before everything faded, she caught flashes of the spring trip back then. She slipped into the water, and Edgar jumped in without hesitation like crazy.She remembered all those nights when she was scared of the dark, and he stayed up just to talk her through it.She remembered him running out late at night to grab hot oatmeal when her stomach hurt.But now, all of that was gone.By the time the bodyguards pulled her out, Stephanie couldn't even stay on her feet.She hit the ground hard, coughing violently, drenched and barely holding it together.Her hands were shaking as she pulled out her phone. The screen lit up instantly.Amelia had just posted something new on Instagram.""First time someone's ever waited outside my dorm all night just to get unblocked.""The photo showed Edgar standing downstairs with a bouquet of roses, looking soft and romantic.",1,1755543446.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

**Yes, there are more specialized ""dummy"" rounds you can get.**

**I figured the listing for a 5 pack at a lower cost, from a well-known brand would be good enough for the majority of the people here without getting too confusing.**

Also,

***If you are showing off a gun. Don't have a loaded mag in it! DON'T HAVE A BULLET IN THE CHAMBER, JAMMED OR NOT.***

If the gun is malfunctioning enough to be jammed. You already cannot trust it. Why are you risking KILLING yourself or someone else?

At the range, pointed down range, sure. Grab a pic so you can look at it later and maybe see something you missed in person, but waving it around in your basement where we know it flagged your balls, legs, face, and mother. Just no.

1mtuzyb,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/1mtuzyb/26_m4a_vancouver_bc_autistic_non_binary_nb/,26 [M4A] #Vancouver #BC Autistic Non Binary NB & Asexual Person Looking To Be Squeezed & Held,"Hey! Okay... is anyone familiar with how some autistic folks find it therapeutic to be squeezed tightly? As that is what I'm hoping to maybe find from this post.

Essentially, there's a lot weighing on me lately. I'm dealing with chronic and worsening health stuff, I'm feeling disconnected from the city and local social communities (health stuff makes it hard to go out), and with a project I'm working on at the moment? It is definitely an overwhelming, and intimidating task, and honestly even if it is a passion project, I wonder if I bit off more than I could chew.

With all of this (and more) weighing on me... I'm sort of feeling this overwhelming urge to just be held, and squeezed. I mean, it is one of those things that has been known to bring comfort to many people who are on the autistic spectrum after all, including myself. And no, this isn't a ""hug"" like some people thought I meant on my last posts. To be honest, it doesn't even have to involve physical contact. I mean, just having me wrapped up in a blanket burrito, and being squeezed from the outside of the burrito would be much closer to what I'm hoping for out of this. 

Of course I'd absolutely love to cook you some food! We could watch a show, listen to music, talk (or not), and of course we could do the squeeze whenever you felt comfortable! The squeeze would ideally last for a few minutes, but that can be discussed. I just think it should be long enough that i can actually allow myself to relax into it. Ideally, we should talk online, and meet for a coffee first since something like this requires at least a bit of established trust. 

Honestly, I don't even know if posting this will yield anything. I'm nervous about even being this vulnerable with expressing a need like this. But hey, I've met some fabulous people on reddit before... so honestly? Why not?

If you are open to this concept, feel free to reach out! I'd love to talk, and see what we can do from there! If you'd benefit from a good squeeze too, I can do the same for you!

A bit about me! I'm 26, non binary, living in Coquitlam (but can travel anywhere!). I'm neurodivergent (obviously), and have interests that range from music, art, and creativity, to transit, and horror! I love going out into nature sometimes, but I also enjoy staying in, and gaming too. I'm also trying to get into alternative fashion more!

For something like this, I probably would prefer to connect with other LGBTQ+ folks, and neurodivergent folks too. I do tend to be picky about the cis men I connect with, but I'm not opposed. Just please approach me with a message that actually shows you read this post, and DO NOT bring up, or even imply anything that is NSFW, otherwise I will block you! This act is meant to be platonic in nature. 

Anyways! I look forward to hearing from some people!

Also, to help show me you've read this post, please tell me your favourite types of music! ",2,1755543327.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

1mtuwto,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplianceCheck/comments/1mtuwto/should_you_buy_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker/,Should You Buy the Best Single Serve Coffee Maker Nespresso Vertuo,"Testing out the Nespresso BNV220CRO1BUC1 was a bit of a revelation for someone like me, who has spent years struggling with ineffective coffee makers and overpriced coffee shop runs. This machine showed up in its sleek chrome finish, immediately upping the style quotient of my kitchen counter. At first glance, its compact design felt almost too compact, but that’s where I discovered the brilliance of its engineering—every inch serves a purpose without wasting space. The 8-inch depth is perfect for those with limited counter real estate, and frankly, it looks like it belongs in a high-end café.

**Ease of Use and Brewing Versatility**  
With the press of a single button, this machine transforms your morning routine. It’s astonishing how easy it is to operate. The capsule system is foolproof—just drop the pod in, close the lever, and let the Centrifusion technology take over. I had my first cup of coffee in about 25 seconds, which felt like a blessing on a few particularly groggy mornings. Whether it’s a mild morning brew, a bold afternoon espresso, or even iced coffee on warmer days, this machine delivers consistent results. I especially loved the wide choice of cup sizes, from a small 1.35-ounce espresso to a generous 14-ounce Alto coffee. It’s fantastic how it reads the barcode on each capsule to ensure the perfect brewing settings.  

[Grab Nespresso BNV220CRO1BUC1 at the best price on Amazon.](https://werdink.com/p/b01n6tvx8h/)

**Highlights**  
- Anyone can get barista-quality coffee at home with minimal effort.  
- Multiple cup sizes accommodate varying preferences and moods.  
- Complimentary set of Nespresso capsules included, which is a thoughtful touch to get you started.  

**Innovative Features that Stand Out**  
The technology behind this machine is impressive. The patented Centrifusion process spins the coffee pod at up to 7,000 RPM. Watching it brew felt oddly hypnotic, and the crema it delivers is restaurant-grade perfect—a golden, silky layer that crowns your coffee beautifully. Another standout is the auto shut-off feature. Once it's idle for a while, it powers down, saving energy effortlessly. The removable 40-ounce water tank made refilling easy, though if you’re brewing for multiple people, you might find yourself topping it off more frequently than expected.

**Performance and Consistency**  
The consistency of this machine left me shocked in the best way possible. No matter how many pods I ran through (and I went through a LOT), each cup had the same rich flavor and silky texture. I did wonder whether it would maintain this quality over time, but after weeks of daily use, there are no signs of diminished performance. It’s worth noting that this coffee maker is exclusively compatible with Nespresso Vertuo capsules. While this guarantees perfect brews, the need for these specific pods could be inconvenient for some.

**Advantages**  
- Delivers premium-tasting coffee and espresso effortlessly.  
- Sleek, space-saving design enhances countertop aesthetics.  
- Smart technology measures each capsule for optimum brewing.  

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
- Exclusivity to Nespresso pods may not suit everyone’s preferences.  
- Water tank, while sufficient for a single user, may require frequent refills for households with multiple coffee drinkers.  
- Capsules' eco-friendliness is debatable; while they’re recyclable, not everyone has access to the brand’s recycling program.

**Competing Products**  
Comparing the Nespresso BNV220CRO1BUC1 to its rivals, such as Keurig and other single-serve coffee makers, highlights its unique advantages. Keurig models, for instance, offer broader pod compatibility, but they lack the sophisticated barcode-reading and Centrifusion technologies. While Keurig caters to a wider audience with a less restrictive pod system, the richer taste and distinct crema produced by the Nespresso machine give it the edge for those prioritizing quality. For espresso enthusiasts, this machine clearly stands out compared to Breville’s traditional models, which require more hands-on work and don’t offer this level of automation.

**Money's Worth**  
This isn’t a budget-friendly coffee maker by any stretch, but if you’re someone who spends a significant amount on café drinks, the investment is quickly justified. The quality of coffee, combined with the time and effort saved, makes it a worthy addition to any coffee enthusiast’s life. However, if you're someone who drinks coffee occasionally, you might want to weigh its cost against your actual usage. In my experience, though, it felt like a treat each morning, and that alone made it feel like a good deal.

# Best Gifts for Pastors 2025: Thoughtful & Unique Ideas

Finding the perfect gift for a pastor can be a thoughtful way to show appreciation for their dedication, guidance, and service to the community. In 2025, the options for meaningful gifts continue to evolve, blending traditional sentiments with contemporary needs. Choosing a gift that aligns with a pastor's personal interests, professional duties, or spiritual well-being demonstrates genuine care and understanding. This guide explores a range of gift ideas, from practical tools for ministry to items that promote relaxation and personal enrichment.

Selecting a gift requires considering the pastor's individual preferences, hobbies, and the specific needs of their ministry. Our compilation aims to provide a diverse selection, catering to various tastes and budgets, ensuring you can find a gift that truly resonates with the recipient and conveys your heartfelt gratitude.

## Key Features Analysis

Finding a suitable gift for a pastor requires considering items that are both practical and meaningful. Several features stand out when evaluating potential gift options.

**Personalized study Bible**

A personalized study bible, featuring the pastor's name or a significant verse engraved on the cover, is a treasured and practical gift. The Bible itself should be of high quality, with clear, readable print and durable binding. Study notes, maps, and other helpful resources within the Bible enhance its value for sermon preparation and personal reflection. The personalization adds a special touch, making it a cherished keepsake that the pastor will use and appreciate for years to come.

**High-Quality Pen and Journal set**

A sophisticated pen and journal set is an excellent gift for pastors who enjoy writing, whether for sermon preparation, personal reflections, or organizational tasks. The pen should be of superior quality, offering a smooth and cozy writing experience. The journal should feature high-quality paper and a durable cover, designed to withstand daily use. A thoughtful touch would be to personalize the journal with the pastor's initials or a meaningful quote.

**Noise-Canceling headphones**

Noise-canceling headphones are a valuable asset for pastors seeking moments of quiet reflection or focused work amidst a busy schedule. High-quality headphones effectively block out distracting sounds, creating a peaceful environment for prayer, study, or relaxation. Look for headphones with comfortable earcups, long battery life, and reliable Bluetooth connectivity, allowing the pastor to easily use them with various devices.

**Subscription to a Theological Resource**

Providing a subscription to a reputable theological journal or online resource offers pastors continuous access to scholarly articles, insightful commentaries, and cutting-edge research. This subscription can enhance their understanding of scripture, inform their sermon preparation, and promote ongoing intellectual growth. Consider resources that align with the pastor's specific theological interests and areas of ministry.

**Luxury Coffee or Tea subscription**

For pastors who enjoy coffee or tea, a subscription to a premium brand offers a delightful sensory experience. Select a subscription that delivers ethically sourced, high-quality beans or leaves on a regular basis. Include a complementary mug or tea infuser to enhance the gift.This thoughtful gesture provides a moment of relaxation and enjoyment amidst the demands of ministry.

**Comfortable and Stylish Clerical Robes**

A new set of professional-looking clerical robes adds to the pastor's comfort and confidence during service. The robes should be made of breathable, wrinkle-resistant fabric and be designed for an appropriate fit. Consider adding a personalized embroidered stole or lapel pin to complete the look.

## Core Benefits

Selecting the right gift for a pastor demonstrates appreciation, strengthens the relationship, and supports their ministry. Thoughtful gifts can provide practical assistance, promote personal well-being, and enhance their ability to serve the community effectively.

**Enhanced Sermon Preparation:** Gifts such as theological resources, study Bibles, or sermon preparation software can significantly aid in the creation of engaging and insightful sermons. Access to these tools enables pastors to delve deeper into scripture, explore different perspectives, and craft messages that resonate with their congregations.

**Improved Personal Well-being:** The demands of ministry can be emotionally and physically taxing. Gifts that promote relaxation, such as noise-canceling headphones, spa treatments, or gourmet coffee subscriptions, offer pastors a much-needed prospect to recharge and rejuvenate. These experiences contribute to their overall well-being and help them maintain a healthy work-life balance.

**Strengthened connection with the Congregation:** A gift that reflects the pastor's personality or interests can deepen the sense of connection between the pastor and the congregation. Thoughtful gestures, such as personalized items or gifts tailored to their hobbies, demonstrate that their efforts are recognized and appreciated.

**Increased Efficiency and Organization:** gifts that promote organization, such as high-quality planners, electronic organizers, or desk accessories, can definitely help pastors manage their time and tasks more effectively. These tools enable them to stay on top of appointments, manage correspondence, and streamline their workflow.

**Professional Advancement Opportunities:** Providing resources for professional development, such as conference registrations or continuing education courses, can empower pastors to expand their knowledge, refine their skills, and stay current with the latest trends in ministry. These opportunities contribute to their growth as leaders and enhance their ability to serve their congregations effectively.

## FAQs Section

Selecting a suitable gift for a pastor can raise several questions, particularly when considering their unique needs and preferences. Here are some answers to common inquiries to help inform your decision.**What types of gifts are most appropriate for a pastor?**
Appropriate gifts for a pastor typically fall into several categories: items that support their ministry work (such as study resources or organizational tools), gifts that promote their personal well-being (like relaxation aids or hobbies-related items), and personalized tokens of appreciation. It's crucial to consider the pastor's individual interests,lifestyle,and the specific needs of their ministry when making your selection.

**How much should I spend on a gift for a pastor?**
The amount you spend on a gift for a pastor is a personal decision and depends on your budget, the occasion, and your relationship with the pastor. It's generally appropriate to spend between $50 and $200 for a significant occasion like Christmas or a birthday. However, a thoughtful, inexpensive gift can be just as meaningful as an expensive one. The intention behind the gift is the most critically important factor.

**Is it appropriate to give a pastor a gift card?**
Yes, giving a gift card is generally considered appropriate, especially if you are unsure of the pastor's specific preferences. Gift cards allow the pastor to choose something they truly need or want. Consider gift cards to bookstores, coffee shops, restaurants, or online retailers. A handwritten note accompanying the gift card adds a personal touch.

**What are some gifts to avoid giving a pastor?**

Avoid giving gifts that could be perceived as inappropriate or controversial. This includes items related to alcohol, tobacco, gambling, or anything that conflicts with the church's values. Also, avoid overly personal or intimate gifts that could create discomfort. It is generally a good idea to avoid items that could be interpreted as attempting to influence the pastor's decisions or actions within the church.## Competitor Comparison

While the other options are acceptable, they lack the same tactile feel and prestige as the fountain pen.

## Ideal User Profile

Identifying the ideal user profile helps to understand who would most benefit from these types of gifts.

**Experienced Pastors:** Pastors who have served in ministry for many years often appreciate gifts that enhance their study and reflection practices. Resources such as theological journals, commentaries, or study Bibles with personalized inscriptions can be particularly meaningful, honoring their dedicated service.

**New Pastors:** Recent seminary graduates or newly ordained pastors may benefit from gifts that support their early ministry efforts. Practical items such as software packages, organizational tools, or professional attire can provide valuable assistance as they establish their roles within the church.

**Pastors with Hobbies:** Consider the pastor's personal interests when selecting a gift. If they enjoy reading, a subscription to a literary magazine or a set of classic books might be appropriate. If they enjoy outdoor activities, equipment related to their hobby could be a thoughtful gesture or gift certificate to the hobby supply store.

## Buying Recommendations & Conclusion

When shopping for gifts for pastors, consider their individual preferences, needs, and the specific context of their ministry. A thoughtful gift demonstrates appreciation and strengthens the relationship between the pastor and the congregation.

Select gifts that are both meaningful and practical, reflecting the pastor's dedication and commitment to serving the community. Assess the quality and durability of the gift, ensuring that it will be a lasting reminder of your appreciation.

I just arrived in San Francisco from Europe and I’m hoping to build some connections in the HR space here. I’m a young entrepreneur working on a startup in the HR field (we're working on scaling strengths-based employee growth that brings organizational values to life), and I’d love to meet people who work in HR in the Bay Area – at any level (junior, senior, recruiter, manager, etc.), and in any type of organization (startup, SME, or big company).

I’m not here to sell anything. I’d simply love to buy you a coffee and have a short conversation about your experience, the HR landscape here, and just get to know people in the community.

If you work in HR (or know someone who does) and wouldn’t mind a casual coffee chat, I’d really appreciate it. Happy to come to whatever location is convenient for you.

If you’re open to it, feel free to DM me here on Reddit. 😊

Thanks so much!

Last week my sister(15f) and i(17f) were supposed to go to a coffee shop where you can paint on ceramic objects. I brought it up while my friend (18f) was around, and in order not to be rude, my sister invited her too. I love my friend and i love spending time with her, but i wanted to spend some time alone with my sister since we hadnt been as close lately. So, we pretended that something came up and we were unable to go, but without fully cancelling our plans, we only delayed them for the next day. This way, we get to hang out with my friend AND have some bro time. However the next day my friend found out through instagram stories (i forgot to hide her finsta) and got really upset. She was more upset about lying to her, and she made a really big deal out of it, implying that she doesnt know why shes my friend anymore, telling me that im ""just like my mother"", accusing me of not wanting to be better than my mother, of not trying to change and better myself. I apologized because i DID find it wrong that i lied to her but i also think that she overreacted. I only made an excuse, i didnt lie to her about something that could genuinely affect our relationship, and while i understand it hurt her i do believe that her treating me like im the worst person alive is quite an exaggeration.
Edit: i know it was wrong to lie to her and i also am not accusing her of being a bad person for responding this way!! My problem is whether i would be an asshole for believing that she overreacted in a situation.

A little about me: I’m a 56-year-old bricklayer, and this project is something I run purely as a hobby to unwind after long days on site. 

I’ve been collecting mixes for nearly 20 years, and the site now has around 80,000 free-to-stream mixes available. 

On top of that, I still have another 200,000 (and counting) waiting to be processed and uploaded.

It’s just me running everything, and with so much material I tend to jump around a bit—one day it’s Techno, the next it’s House—but there’s always something for everyone.

I’ve recently added a tracklist feature, so visitors (new and old) will start noticing mixes posted with tracklists and flyers.

If anyone’s interested in helping curate the collections, please get in touch. 

Any contribution is welcome—whether it’s adding tracklists, flyers, date corrections, missing mixes, or anything else.

I also run a Facebook page, and while I’m not a numbers guy, the more people who follow and share the socials, the more it helps the site grow. 

So please feel free to spread the word and invite your friends.

There’s also a Patreon link for anyone who’s able to chip in the price of a coffee each month—it would be massively appreciated. 

The site has ongoing costs, and I’m also working on improvements (like upgrading the player), so every little bit helps.

Enjoy the music—there’s plenty more to come: the rare, the beautiful, and everything in between.

Like and share as much as you can.

Peace

From the first unboxing moment, I could tell this wasn’t an ordinary appliance. The sleek white polished finish and compact design stood out immediately, and it genuinely feels more stylish than most similar appliances I’ve come across. As much as I admired its aesthetic, I was even more excited to dive into its functionality because aesthetics alone don’t make that morning tea any better.

**Ease of Use and User-Friendly Features**  
Using this water boiler has been a breeze in my daily grind. The micro-computerized temperature control system might sound a bit fancy on paper, but in practice, it simplifies everything. I’ve tried all four of its keep-warm temperature settings—160°F, 175°F, 195°F, and 208°F—and honestly, they deliver quite accurately. My green tea finally tastes like it’s been brewed at the right temperature instead of burning the aroma. And the Quick Temp mode is my savior during rushed mornings, skipping the boiling and warming water to just the perfect brew-ready state faster than expected. Even the swivel base saves effort when you’ve got guests around.

[Check Zojirushi CD-LFC50 price on Amazon.](https://coolpromoproducts.com/p/b0166od6j0/)

**Performance That Stands Out**  
The performance on this thing is nothing short of refined. Boiling water isn’t revolutionary, but keeping it perfectly warm all day long at just the precise settings is where this product stands out. Running into various modes, timers, and temperature adjustments made me feel as if the appliance was smarter than expected. The Panorama Window water level gauge, which is shockingly easy to read, is a huge bonus for someone who constantly struggles to eye measurements. It helps me save time on refill estimates.

**Strengths**  
• The nonstick interior is incredibly easy to clean. No crusty residue to scrub endlessly.  
• Four predefined warm temperature options cover a variety of needs, from brewing teas to preparing oatmeal.  
• Speedy Quick Temp mode that skips boiling entirely for quicker results.  
• Intuitive controls make it easy to operate even for tech-challenged users.

**Critiques**  
While I thoroughly enjoyed most of this product’s capabilities, no product is without its hiccups.  
• The lack of an actual manual timer setting felt limiting when I wanted more control over brewing periods.  
• It takes up a significant amount of counter space and is heavier than expected at six pounds.  
• As much as I appreciated its advanced features, its price bracket feels a bit steep compared to more basic water boilers.

**Competing Products**  
Comparing this water boiler to others on the market, it truly feels like it belongs to a premium segment. Fancy electric kettles, such as those by Breville, focus heavily on design but lack the deeper customization this unit offers. On the other hand, simpler models from brands like Tiger provide basic boiling and warm-keeping but don’t offer varied temperature options or advanced Quick Temp functions. The Zojirushi model takes the crown when we’re stacking up features, convenience, and durability, yet those who just want “boiling and done” might find it overly intricate.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
While the initial investment in this machine might make you think twice, the quality and long-term value it offers are hard to overlook. Considering how I’ve stopped reheating water repeatedly on the stovetop or in the microwave, it justifies itself as a smart buy. The energy-saving timer ensures you aren’t blowing up electricity bills unnecessarily, too. If you’re someone who brews tea or coffee more than once a day, it probably pays for itself in experience over time.

I will be changing names for anonymity.
My younger sister (17) is going through a bad break-up, and has slowly been opening up on everything that has happened in the last week.
**THE PEOPLE**
For this story, there are 4 (main) people that you need to know about:
My sister (Lola, 17)
The Loser Ex (Donald, 19)
Her Best Friend Stacy (Age 18)
Her Childhood Friend/Loser's Best Friend (Tom, 18)
I, myself, am a decade older than all of them.
**CONTEXT**
This loser, Donald, has been obviously crushing and hitting on my sister for the last 2 years. He's a little bit of a delinquent: under-age DUI, manipulator, petty vandalism ect. He decided to start ""cleaning up his act"" and got a job so he could start treating my sister to dates and so she wouldn't be embarrassed to bring him around. He even convinced her to get a part-time job at the place he was working at. I told her to be careful, she believed he was really changing.
Until this last week.
**THE DRAMA**
Originally, my sister had told me that Donald had just decided to block her on everything and talk bad on her name for texting her friend, Tom.
Yesterday, she felt safe enough with me to tell me what REALLY happened.
Lola, Stacy, and Donald (along with 5 other ""friends"") went to the river to cool off (it's 90°+ here). My sister, Lola, drove her and Donald to the river because he lost his license from driving drunk/harboring illegal substances underage.
About an hour into their hang-out, Donald brings out a bottle of cheep vodka. Both Lola and Stacy are uncomfortable, and both say they don't want to. Donald keeps pressuring them both, and Stacy decides to grab a ride and leave. Lola, being a traumatized people-pleaser, eventually caves.
The next thing she knows it's night time, she's waking up in her car, parked in our driveway, in the passenger seat, covered in her own throw-up.
The last thing she remembers is Donald taking her phone away, everyone laughing at her, and her drunkenly asking to call Tom to take her home (he's someone she trusts, he has a girlfriend she knows, and he's the only other person she knows who has a car).
She checked her phone, and now Donald's blocked her on everything, and won't even acknowledge her existence irl.
Lola goes to ask the other ""friends"" what happened:
Donald had convinced her to start drinking, then started making fun of her for not being able to hold her liquor. She was saying she didn't feel good, and wanted to call Tom to pick her up (repeatedly, because no one was listening to her). He took her phone away, accusing her of cheating on him with his ""best friend"" Tom (who has a long-term girlfriend) and stated calling her a hoe. After she starred getting really sick, he took her car keys and drove her and her car home, then walked himself home.
He got himself a new girlfriend THE NEXT DAY, and has since been going around to all of their mutual  ""friends"" and spinning a tale about how ""Lola is for the streets"" and has been cheating on him because she texted her friend Tom (one of her longest standing friends). These ""friends"" (who I have told her are superficial and wishy-washy) have expressed to her that SHE is in the wrong and continue to suck up to Donald.
Now, he's going around their place of employment and telling managers/staff that she's a cheater and that she's ""for the streets"".
The only people she has in her corner right now are Tom, his girlfriend, and Stacy (who all feel like the worst people in the world for not being able to help her during this situation). Myself included, of course.
She got pulled into the office by her manager today and asked why Donald refuses to acknowledge her existence or help train her when he's asked too. Even the manager says she's better off (I'm sure they see through the BS).
For a good minute, I was considering just keeping my nose out of it and just helping her get through the break-up : until she informed me of all this yesterday.
**NOW?**
The underage drinking/pier pressure that really got me boiling. As did everything else - this was just the tipping point.
Here comes the interesting part.
I have recently learned that I work with and am good friends with Donald's father. We have an amazing work relationship, and respect each-other and our hard work ethic(s).
I have been considering asking him to sit down for coffee, outside of work, to talk about all of this with him and inform him of his delinquent son's actions the last 2 weeks.
Would I be over-stepping? Would this only make things worse? We live in a small town - there are maybe 12,000 people that live in our area.
The only other thing I want to do is go pop this kid's bike tires and punch him in the face - I think letting his dad know would almost be worse, though.
Donald's over 18 so it wouldn't be considered assault on a minor.

In the end, he still broke his promise.  
  
  
The wedding venue erupted into chaos.  
  
  
Guests were whispering, and every hushed comment felt like a knife twisting in my chest.  
  
  
Both sets of parents rushed over, completely lost about what the hell just happened.  
  
  
Gideon, one of Arthur's firefighter buddies, stood there awkwardly, his face burning red:  
  
  
""Kayla... listen, Natalie's got severe depression. Last time she tried to jump, Arthur saved her life. She's like, totally dependent on him now. He's the only one who can talk her down... This is life or death here. He had no choice, I swear. Don't be pissed at him...""  
  
  
Gideon had been Arthur's right-hand guy for three years, always calling me ""sister-in-law"", showing me mad respect.  
  
  
Now? He couldn't even meet my eyes.  
  
  
God knows what else he'd been helping Arthur hide from me, or how deep this thing with Natalie really went.  
  
  
That’s when it hit me—Arthur had truly betrayed me.  
  
  
My parents grabbed my hands, freaking out:  
  
  
""What the hell is going on? Isn't he supposed to be on wedding leave? Who needs him to go play hero right now?""  
  
  
Arthur's parents looked mortified, speed-dialing him:  
  
  
""Kayla, honey, don't worry. I'm calling my idiot son right now. He better get his ass back here or I'll break his damn legs myself!""  
  
  
The diamond ring was just lying there on the red carpet, getting kicked around by people walking by—just like my shattered heart.  
  
  
I stood there in my wedding dress, the train dragging on the floor like a storm-soaked cloud.  
  
  
All those perfect wedding fantasies? Turns out it would end up looking this pathetic.  
  
  
The groom ditched his bride for another woman, leaving me standing in a hall filled with blessings.  
  
  
Five straight hours. 108 phone calls. Arthur didn't pick up once.  
  
  
I watched my phone screen go dark, light up, then die completely.  
  
  
Light filtered through the stained glass, casting broken patterns on the ground—and on my empty ring finger, cold enough to hurt.  
  
  
Guests started trickling out, leaving behind half-eaten wedding cake and scattered rose petals everywhere.  
  
  
Suddenly everything started spinning. My mom's panicked screaming was the last thing I heard before everything went black.  
  
  
When I came to, the smell of disinfectant hit me hard.  
  
  
A nurse was changing my IV, and when she saw I was awake, she smiled gently:  
  
  
""Congratulations, honey. You're pregnant. Can't be getting this upset anymore. Take care of yourself.""  
  
  
I stared at the ceiling as tears slid down my temples.  
  
  
From seventeen, getting Arthur's love letter after football practice...  
  
  
To college freshman year, when he'd ride a twenty-hour bus just to surprise me during our long-distance days...  
  
  
To the day he became a firefighter and promised through tears, ""I'll protect the world, but you'll always come first.""  
  
  
Seven years of memories flashed through my head like a movie on fast-forward.  
  
  
I looked at my parents and Arthur's parents trying to hide their excitement about the baby, and my throat closed up.  
  
  
How was I supposed to tell them that our seven-year love story was finally over?  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
  
At seven PM, Arthur finally showed up—after disappearing for six whole hours.  
  
  
He looked like hell, pale and exhausted, and when our eyes met, I could see the guilt eating him alive.  
  
  
""Kayla, I'm sorry."" His voice was completely shot. ""Natalie... I couldn't just let her die. Saving lives is what I do—it's my job.""  
  
  
I swallowed the bitterness rising in my throat and snapped back:  
  
  
""There are so many firefighters—did it really have to be you?""  
  
  
""She picks our wedding day to threaten suicide and demands that only you can save her? What kind of sick game is that?""  
  
  
""Arthur, I'm not stupid.""  
  
  
After a long silence, he grabbed my cold hands, his voice cracking:  
  
  
""Kayla, in seven years, I've never asked you for anything. But this once—please don't make this public, okay? Don’t let Natalie get hurt by this drama. Her mental state—she can’t take another blow.""  
  
  
Looking into his desperate eyes, I felt like someone was crushing my heart.  
  
  
He shouldn't beg for me—he should be apologizing right now.  
  
  
First instincts don't lie—he hadn't thought about how humiliated I'd be, standing there in my wedding dress.  
  
  
Never wondered why his bride ended up in the ER.  
  
  
The first words out of his mouth? All about Natalie.  
  
  
Tears streamed down my face, soaking the hospital sheets.  
  
  
It took everything I had to choke out: ""Fine.""  
  
  
He visibly relaxed, then hit me with:  
  
  
""Natalie's really unstable right now—knowing about our wedding and all. We should postpone it.""  
  
  
""I have to get her through treatment first. Once she's doing better... maybe three months? Just three months, and then we'll have our wedding. Deal?""  
  
  
Arthur asked, his voice cautious and testing.  
  
  
I'd waited seven years. What's three more months, right?  
  
  
But looking at the way he worried about her, I suddenly realized I couldn't wait another day.  
  
  
The baby inside me seemed to sense my emotions and gave a tiny flutter.  
  
  
I touched my stomach, where our six-week-old secret was growing—ours, but somehow not his anymore.  
  
  
I pulled my hands back and my voice went completely dead: ""Arthur.""  
  
  
""I suck at remembering most things, but I remember seventeen-year-old you stumbling over your own feet when you gave me that love letter.""  
  
  
""I remember the first time you held my hand—your palm was soaking wet, and you wouldn't let go for three whole blocks.""  
  
  
""I remember graduation day when you swore you'd take care of me forever, promised I'd be the happiest bride in the world.""  
  
  
""All these years, you remembered I hate onions, that I need ginger tea when I'm on my period, every stupid little thing about me... I really thought I was your whole world.""  
  
  
I looked up at him, my tears finally came flooding out:  
  
  
""But today... I can't feel your love anymore.""  
  
  
Seven years of memories crashed over me, and Arthur's eyes filled with tears too. His Adam's apple bobbed as he choked out:  
  
  
""But Kayla, Natalie can't survive without me right now.""  
  
  
Those words killed whatever hope I had left.  
  
  
I stared at him and suddenly laughed through my tears: ""Then go to her.""  
  
  
He looked stunned, like he hadn't expected my accept.  
  
  
But in the end, he said nothing—just turned around and walked out of my hospital room.  
  
  
Chapter 3  
  
  
The next day, I was getting ready to check out.  
  
  
Just as I turned the corner, I ran straight into Arthur.  
  
  
He didn't even notice me at first—his whole world was the fragile girl hanging off his arm.  
  
  
She was wearing a hospital gown, pale as a sheet, practically melting into his side like some scared little doe.  
  
  
So this was the girl who made him ditch me at the altar.  
  
  
I must've been death-staring pretty hard because Natalie saw me first, immediately cowering behind Arthur and death-gripping his shirt.  
  
  
That's when Arthur finally noticed me. His face immediately hardened, and his tone was ice cold:  
  
  
""Kayla, Natalie's having a really hard time right now. Whatever drama you're planning, take it home. Don't pull this shit here and freak her out.""  
  
  
Natalie peeked out from behind him, her voice barely a whisper:  
  
  
""Kayla... Arthur and I aren't... we're not anything, I swear. Please don't hate me.""  
  
  
I crushed the ultrasound printout in my fist until my knuckles went white, but forced a smile:  
  
  
""You're both overthinking this. I'm just here to get discharged.""  
  
  
I turned away and headed to the billing desk.  
  
  
Arthur’s expression flickered—he hadn’t expected me to be this calm, and for a split second, something hollow crossed his eyes.  
  
  
He reached out to grab my arm, but I jerked away. That's when I noticed the stains on my coat.  
  
  
Following my gaze, Arthur saw me taking off the coat. He took off his jacket to give to me, but I stepped back.  
  
  
He froze, then tried to take my stained coat:  
  
  
""Here, give it to me. I know you love this coat—I'll get it dry cleaned.""  
  
  
I shook my head and tossed the coat in a nearby trash can.  
  
  
""Get rid of it. I don’t do stained. And you know I can’t stand dirty things.""  
  
  
Watching my cold expression, Arthur's face fell.  
  
  
He knew I wasn't just talking about the coat—but our love.  
  
  
By the time he tried to say something else, I'd already finished paying and walked away.  
  
  
I barely made it outside before my phone buzzed with a text from Arthur:  
  
  
""Don't be pissed at me. Ordered you those Napoleon cakes from your favorite spot. Should be there soon.""  
  
  
When the delivery showed up at my apartment, I stared at that familiar pink box and actually laughed.  
  
  
Same old Arthur playbook—piss me off, then try to buy forgiveness with dessert.  
  
  
I took a mechanical bite.  
  
  
Used to taste like heaven. Now it was just bitter.  
  
  
Arthur didn't come home that night.  
  
  
Stripping away seven years of love hurts more than I ever imagined.  
  
  
I was still wide awake at 3 AM, so I got up and started packing.  
  
  
Matching hoodies in the closet, framed photos on the bookshelf, little love notes stuck to the fridge...  
  
  
Every piece of our life together was like a slap in the face.  
  
  
I remembered the year after graduation when Arthur had just joined the FDNY, working himself to death.  
  
  
But on his days off, he'd show up at my place with eyes bright as stars:  
  
  
""Kayla, once I save up for a house, I'm gonna marry the hell out of you.""  
  
  
Three years later, he stood in front of me with a deed and an engagement ring, his voice shaking:  
  
  
""I did it. Got us a home, just like I promised.""  
  
  
The sun was perfect that day. I cried all over him, feeling like the luckiest woman alive.  
  
  
We painted walls together, built IKEA furniture, filled the balcony with sunflowers because I loved them.  
  
  
He said he wanted sunshine in our home forever.  
  
  
But now this same home had no room for me anymore.  
  
  
I sealed the last moving box just as dawn was breaking.  
  
  
When the moving truck showed up, both sets of parents were already at my door.  
  
  
I hadn't told them jack shit about Arthur's drama, so they were completely in the dark about why two people who were about to say ""I do"" were suddenly splitting up.  
  
  
My parents just sighed and didn't push it.  
  
  
""Come home whenever you want, honey.""  
  
  
But Arthur's moher Hailey grabbed my hands and wouldn't let go:  
  
  
""Kayla, sweetie, can't you give Arthur one more chance? What happened at the wedding... he just lost his head for a minute...""  
  
  
I stayed quiet and kept directing the movers.  
  
  
Just when Hailey was about to talk herself hoarse, the door swung open.  
  
  
Arthur was back.  
  
  
With Natalie trailing behind him like a lost puppy.  
  
  
She was swimming in his jacket, clinging to his arm like some pathetic lost kitten who'd found a new owner.  
  
  
The whole room went dead silent. Everyone was staring at them.  
  
  
Hailey's voice was shaking: ""Arthur... you... you cheat on Kayla?""  
  
  
His dad looked ready to commit murder: ""Who the fuck is this girl?!""  
  
  
Arthur ignored them, scanning our empty living room before his eyes landed on me: ""You're moving out?""  
  
  
""Yeah,"" I said flatly. ""Back to my parents' place.""  
  
  
He looked almost relieved. ""Good. I'll come get you before the next wedding.""  
  
  
Just like that—casual as hell—he stepped aside and pulled Natalie forward.  
  
  
""This is Natalie. She's a suicide survivor I rescued on a call. The department wants me babysitting her for a while, help stabilize her mental health.""  
  
  
That kind of honesty almost made our little suspicions feel ridiculous.  
  
  
Natalie flashed this sweet little smile and reached for Hailey's arm:  
  
  
""Hi, Mrs. Haustia! Arthur's been amazing—he even invited me for dinner tonight, and since everyone's here, why don't I cook? You can all try my famous pasta!""  
  
  
Hailey looked at me helplessly. ""Kayla, maybe we should all just... sit down and clear the air?""  
  
  
I was about to refuse when Natalie jumped in, her eyes flashing with challenge.  
  
  
""Oh, Kayla should totally stay! The more the merrier, right?""  
  
  
SMACK—  
  
  
The sound of my mom's hand connecting with Natalie's face echoed through the apartment.  
  
  
I stared in shock as my mom slapped the shit out of her.  
  
  
""Mom!""  
  
  
My mother was seeing red, her whole body vibrating with rage:  
  
  
""I gave birth to you—so I know you!""  
  
  
""You've been with him since you were seventeen. Seven goddamn years! You quit your job at the design firm to play housewife, learned to cook his favorite dish, even remembered exactly how he likes his socks folded... You wouldn't be running unless he broke your heart completely!""  
  
  
""I don't need you marrying some rich prince, but I'll be damned if I let him bring his side piece into your home to humiliate you!""  
  
  
""You won't fight for yourself? Fine. I will!""  
  
  
My mom's words hit me like lightning. My eyes started burning.  
  
  
Natalie was holding her cheek, tears welling up but not daring to actually cry.  
  
  
Arthur immediately shielded her, his face dark as a storm cloud:  
  
  
""Kayla! You're a grown woman and you're still running to mommy like a little kid...""  
  
  
Not letting him finish, I marched over and slapped him hard across the face.  
  
  
""Arthur, you're the one who deserves to get smacked!""  
  
  
Then I yanked a piece of paper from the coffee table drawer and threw it at him—the ultrasound results.  
  
  
""You want to know what I regret most?""  
  
  
Arthur picked up the paper, and when he saw what it was, his eyes went huge:  
  
  
""Holy shit... Kayla, you're pregnant?""  
  
  
Watching the joy explode across Arthur's face as he lunged toward me, yelling ""I'm gonna be a dad!""—it was fucking pathetic.  
  
  
He forgot Natalie was standing right there, forgot how he'd ditched me at the altar, forgot how cold he'd been the past few days. Like somehow having a baby would magically erase everything.  
  
  
But all those moments he chose Natalie over me, all those sleepless nights, all the trust he'd trampled—none of that just disappears.  
  
  
I shoved him away hard and screamed:  
  
  
""Don't get excited yet, asshole!""  
  
  
""This baby? Yesterday, when you came begging me to protect your precious Natalie's reputation? That's when I scheduled the abortion.""

Every morning, I’m the one making coffee. But Scout has been running her own café. She’s posted up at the window seat, tongue out, tail wagging, waiting for her usual order: a Barkaccino with extra froth. And she’s far too invested in catching up on the news — which features all the latest chipmunk activities. It’s a silly little scene from our living room, but also a reminder of what “home” feels like: warm, funny, a little chaotic, and better with coffee (and pets).



Who in your household is really running the morning routine—you, or your furry family member?

Here is the original lore : so basically leila and idris had their parents unalived because of their power in a certain community that their  country don’t like. The children who were 15 (leila) and 17 (idris) escaped to Amsterdam (idk I like the city) they had nothing bla bla bla until they met reiko Tanaka a women in her forties who was once famous writer/philosopher (alternative: she was a detective and you know the unaliving of the parents and all) she adopted them, she was hard but loving she didn’t like a lot of ppl but she liked them, she taught them of to think and to face the word. That’s why leila did psychology study’s. Now in her 20s (22 yrs old) she work at a cafe named aurora coffee and has a special relationship with the owner named ela. From now on I really don’t know what to add the lore look like it was made by a 4 yrs old. I hate it so much and I want to change it or make it better but I don’t have any idea how.

1mtudq3,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeApplianceHelp/comments/1mtudq3/delve_into_the_best_coffee_maker_keurig_kselect/,Delve Into the Best Coffee Maker Keurig K-Select Worth It,"Testing out the Keurig K-Select coffee maker, model 5000198856, over the past few weeks has genuinely been both a delightful and occasionally puzzling experience. If you're like me, someone who can't imagine mornings without a good cup of coffee, making the journey to discover its quirks and perks felt incredibly relevant. The sleek design is the first thing you notice, especially in the Marine Blue color—modern and vibrant enough to brighten up even the dullest counter space. But of course, coffee machines are much more than just how they look, and my daily use uncovered plenty to discuss. 

**Convenient Brewing Options**  
This coffee maker is built to accommodate varying coffee preferences, which is amazing if you live in a house with diverse coffee needs or often host guests. With four brew sizes—6, 8, 10, and 12 ounces—you can easily customize your cup’s exact amount. The single-serve feature comes with Keurig’s signature K-Cup pods, and having used it for weeks, I appreciated how it keeps everything mess-free. My personal favorite setting ended up being the strongest brew option. This feature really delivers when you’re in the mood for a bold, rich cup that packs a punch, especially on sluggish mornings. It felt as though each pod, regardless of blend, was utilized to its fullest potential.

**User Experience Simplified**  
The buttons on this machine make the process unbelievably simple. You literally insert your pod, pick the size you want, and wait just under 60 seconds—voila! A fresh, warm cup of coffee. Unlike my previous coffee maker, there isn’t a steep learning curve here. Even my tech-illiterate uncle, notorious for destroying kitchen gadgets in a single use, managed to whip up his perfect brew under my supervision. I also have to commend Keurig’s Quiet Brew Technology, which makes sure the brewing experience doesn’t sound like a jet engine taking off. It’s impressively quiet compared to most other models in this category.

[Check Keurig 5000198856 price on Amazon.](https://cyberlyber.com/p/b07t1dc1ns/)

**Key Benefits**  
- Versatile with multiple cup size options.  
- Strong brew setting enhances flavor and strength.  
- Convenient and easy-to-use button interface.  
- Quiet Brew Technology minimizes noise disruptions.  

**Build Quality Feels Reliable**  
With its dimensions of 11.6 x 9.2 x 12.5 inches, it fits snugly on my kitchen counter without taking up too much room. The removable drip tray is another thoughtful touch since it accommodates larger travel mugs and makes cleaning spills a non-issue. However, the machine isn’t particularly lightweight, weighing 8.43 pounds—it’s not something you’ll be moving around casually. Another highlight would be the 52-ounce water reservoir. It’s a lifesaver during rushed mornings when I’m not quite awake. The convenience of brewing up to five cups before needing a refill made it feel like my caffeine routine got a major efficiency upgrade. 

**Areas for Improvement**  
Despite its strong performance, the coffee maker isn’t without fault. The initial strong plastic-like smell when unboxing was slightly concerning. It took a couple of water runs to fully rid the taste, which might be off-putting for some users. Similarly, I wish the pods didn’t feel like a recurring expense. Depending on how often you make coffee, relying solely on K-Cup pods can get pricey compared to using ground coffee. Lastly, while the machine is generally user-friendly, the absence of an automatic descaling reminder could lead you to overlook maintenance.  

- Slight odor from the machine during first uses.  
- Ongoing costs of K-Cup pods.  
- Lack of a built-in reminder for descaling.  

**Competing Products**  
When compared to other single-serve coffee makers like the Nespresso Vertuo or the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, I found this machine excelled for its quiet brewing and beginner-friendly nature. The Nespresso Vertuo series does offer fancier pods, but they come at a higher cost, and the machines are bulkier, while Hamilton Beach provides dual brewing options, but the coffee often lacks the same consistency. The Keurig hit that sweet spot between quality and simplicity, making it a better choice for someone who values convenience but doesn’t want to compromise too much on flavor. 

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
The price point of this coffee maker is pretty standard for what it offers—a semi-premium experience without breaking the bank. Though the ongoing cost of K-Cup pods might stretch your wallet depending on how frequently you brew, the simplicity, durability, and reliable brewing system make this a worthwhile investment if convenience and customization are high on your list. Additionally, the reusable filter option somewhat helps budget-conscious coffee lovers.

1mtu6rq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1mtu6rq/aio_nail_tech_served_me_white_vinegar_in_my/,AIO? Nail tech served me white vinegar in my coffee and salon is acting like I'm the problem,"I went to a new nail salon that my friends recommended over the weekend in my city. This place was about double the price of a salon I would normally go to. For reference, I normally pay $55 for a manicure, and this salon charged me $105. It was $70 for a Russian manicure, $30 to remove my gel-X builder base I had from a previous salon, and $5.83 for an Americano out of a nespresso machine. 

I've never been to a high end nail salon before, so I was surprised when they offered me a drink menu. The cheapest thing on the menu was the Americano. The matcha latte was $12.50, which is literally insane. Everything else was between $8-12 for a size small latte or beverage. I literally couldn't justify spending that much on a small sized beverage so I opted for the Americano.

  
The nail tech brought me my drink and then went to the back as my nails soaked off in acetone. She told me she had been out partying till 4:30am and had ""just woken up"" (my appointment was at 11:30am) and needed to go eat her breakfast real quick as I was soaking. Okay, fine. She told me I could take a sip of my coffee and take my nails out of the acetone if I wanted to while I waited.

  
I took a sip and almost spat it out, it was absolutely vile. It tasted like pure white vinegar. I started getting anxiety, thinking ""what the hell is in my coffee."" I had never been to this salon before, and I literally had no clue what I had just ingested. I waited another 5-10 minutes, and she came out sheepishly and said ""haaaay girl hows it going?"" and I said ""Alexia - something is seriously wrong with this coffee."" She goes ""Right? I thought it tasted off. Look at how my drink looks. It's like, separating"" and then she showed me her iced coffee, which was clearly curdling. 

  
My heart was racing, she wasn't sure what was in the coffee, and both of us are just scared and thinking like wtf was that. Anyways, turns out, it was white vinegar. While I'm glad it was just vinegar, I was literally in sheer panic for 5 minutes thinking I had ingested chemical, or a cleaner, or something else. When it came to paying the bill (which was 2.5 hours later) she spun the tablet around and I saw she had still charged me for the coffee. 

  
She said she was still going to charge me because she remade my coffee. But AIO to think they should have at LEAST compensated me for the coffee? It's only $5. I'm not pressed about the money. I don't care. I'm pressed that they just did not care to rectify the experience. And with charging that much money for a ""high end salon experience"" I fully expected them to do more. Like maybe at LEAST a 10% discount. I just felt ripped off. 

  
Not to mention, they overcharged me. Apparently I should have been charged $55, but I was charged $70. Overall, I won't be returning obviously, but like damn AIO?

1mtu6eh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parosmia/comments/1mtu6eh/my_annual_update/,My Annual Update!,"Hi all, 

Here’s my annual timeline update— fair warning, I actually don’t manage to updates yearly 😅 this is for informational purposes for those new to our community here; a way to compare timelines and provide a bit hope.

November 2021 COVID diagnosis
(No taste/smell- 9 months)

August 2022 Parosmia sets in 
(Everything rotten/ burnt/disgusting) 

August 2023 
Slowly gaining taste back 
-no garlic
-no peanut butter
-no chocolate 
-no coffee 
-some fruit tastes bizarre 
-no fried foods

August 2024
-no peanut butter
-no coffee 

August 2025
-no peanut butter (ish) 

Nearly 4 years after my covid diagnosis, I’m still working on peanut butter. I like to call tasting things microdosing— I force myself to eat small amounts of the thing alone or with other foods. I tell myself what I’m eating (out loud or in my head) and try hard to identify what I remember the food to taste like. 

Time is what has healed me, friends. Nothing else! Microdosing the food does seem to help speed the process along. Peanuts/peanut butter has been what I’m most afraid of this year, but I’m working through it!! I’m making big progress- -I can eat a PB & J! I ate a peanut in a shell without spitting it out. I’ve been working on PB for 1 year. 

Feel free to ask questions or just complain. I’ll answer & listen.

As someone who is in target every day, multiple times a day, I can point to many things that have deteriorated the shopping experience...aisles constantly being blocked by stocking. Go back to overnight stocking. It is frustrating to have to dodge pallets, employees, broken down boxes just to get to the soap or the coffee. I get that they have to do their job but it could be done overnight. 

The lack of cashiers is also a huge issue. The amount they're saving on paying more or hiring more is negated by people just not even bothering with target because they know it will be a shit show at checkout. 

Do something about the reshop carts. It's messy to see cart upon cart filled with random shit. 

It's just not an enjoyable experience at Target as it was 5 or 10 years ago. None of the employees I talk to ever seem happy with the work environment. 

Whoever they bring in as the new CEO should get a few Shipt shoppers in for a focus group. I think someone who does 50 target orders a week can see things that the average shopper doesn't. ",3,1755541272.0,ShiptShoppersOfficial,1,1.0,False

  “How you holding up, Clara?”  
  
  I jolt back to myself in the middle of my bedroom, a pile of old magazines strewn around my feet, which I must have dropped when the vision hit. My breath is still frozen in my lungs; my muscles tense, as if they are preparing me to run. The light streaming through the window hurts my eyes. I blink at Billy, who leans against the door frame of my bedroom and offers up an understanding smile.  
  
  “What’s the matter, kid?” she asks when I don’t answer. “Vision got you down?”  
  
  I gulp in a breath. “How did you know?”  
  
  “I get them, too. Plus I’ve been hanging around people who have visions for most of my life. I recognize the post-vision face.” She takes me by the shoulders and sits down with me at the edge of my bed. We wait until my breathing quiets. “Do you want to talk about it?” she asks.  
  
  “There’s not a lot to it yet,” I say. I’ve been having this vision all summer, since Italy with Angela. So far there hasn’t been much to go on but darkness, terror, an oddly slanted floor. “Should I tell you anyway?”  
  
  Billy shakes her head. “You can if you want, if it would help you get things off your chest. But visions are personal, for you and you alone, in my opinion.”  
  
  I’m relieved she’s so laid-back about it. “How do you do it?” I ask after a minute. “How do you go on living like normal when you know that something bad’s going to happen?”  
  
  There’s pain in her smile. She puts her warm brown hand over mine. “You learn to find your happiness, kid,” she says. “You figure out those things that give your life meaning, and you hold on to them. You try to stop worrying about the stuff you can’t control.”  
  
  “Easier said than done.” I sigh.  
  
  “It takes practice.” She claps a hand on my shoulder, squeezes. “You all right now? Ready to come up swinging?”  
  
  I conjure a weak smile. “Yes, ma’am.”  
  
  “All right, then, get to work,” she says playfully. I resume packing, which is what I was doing before the vision clobbered me, and Billy grabs a tape gun and starts sealing up the finished boxes. “You know, I helped your mom pack for Stanford, back in the day. 1963. We were roomies, living in San Luis Obispo, a little house by the beach.”  
  
  I’m going to miss Billy, I think as she goes on. Most of the time when I look at her, I can’t help but see my mom, not because the two of them look anything alike, outside of being tall and gorgeous, but because, as my mom’s best friend for like the last hundred years, Billy has a million memories like this one about Stanford, funny stories and sad ones, times when Mom got a bad haircut or when she lit the kitchen on fire trying to make bananas flambé or when they were nurses in World War I together and Mom saved a man’s life with nothing but a bobby pin and a rubber band. It’s the next best thing to being with Mom, hanging with Billy. It’s like, for those few minutes, when she’s telling the stories, Mom’s alive again.  
  
  “Hey, you okay?” Billy asks.  
  
  “Almost done.” I cough to cover the catch in my voice, then fold up the last sweater, lay it in a box, and glance around. Even though I haven’t packed everything, even though I’ve left my posters on the walls and some of my stuff out, my room looks emptied, like I’ve already moved out of this place.  
  
  I can’t believe that, after tomorrow, I won’t live here anymore.  
  
  “You can come home anytime you like,” Billy says. “Remember that. This is your house. Just call and tell me you’re on your way and I’ll run over and put fresh sheets on the bed.”  
  
  She pats my hand and then heads downstairs to load boxes into her truck. She’ll be driving to California tomorrow, too, while Angela’s mom, Anna, and I follow along behind in my car. I go out into the hall. The house is quiet, but it also seems to have some kind of energy, like it’s full of ghosts. I stare at Jeffrey’s closed door. He should be here. He should have already started his junior year at Jackson Hole High School. He should be well into football practice and his disgusting early-morning protein shakes and tons of mismatched stinky gym socks in the laundry basket. I should be able to go to his door right now and knock and hear him say, Go away, but I’d go in anyway, and then he’d look at me from his computer and maybe turn his throbbing music down a notch or two, smirk, and say, Aren’t you gone yet? and maybe I’d think of something smart to fire back, but in the end we’d both know that he would miss me. And I would miss him.  
  
  I miss him.  
  
  The front door bangs shut downstairs. “You expecting company?” Billy calls up.  
  
  I become aware of the sound of a car pulling up in the driveway. “No,” I holler back. “Who is it?”  
  
  “It’s for you,” she says.  
  
  I book it down the stairs.  
  
  “Oh, good,” says Wendy when I open the door. “I was afraid I missed you.”  
  
  Instinctively I look around for Tucker, my heart doing a stupid little dance.  
  
  “He’s not here,” Wendy says gently. “He, uh …”  
  
  Oh. He didn’t want to see me.  
  
  I try to smile while something in my chest squeezes painfully. Right, I think. Why would he want to see me? We’re broken up. He’s moving on.  
  
  I make myself focus on Wendy. She’  
s clutching a cardboard box to her chest like she’s afraid it might float away from her. She shifts from one foot to the other. “What’s up?” I ask.  
  
  “I had some of your stuff,” she says. “I’m headed to school tomorrow, and I—I thought you might want it.”  
  
  “Thanks. I’m leaving tomorrow, too,” I tell her.  
  
  Once, when her brother and I first got together, Wendy told me that if I hurt Tucker, she’d bury me in horse manure. Ever since we broke up, some part of me has been expecting her to show up here with a shovel and bean me over the head with it. Some part of me thinks that maybe I’d deserve it. Yet here she is looking all fragile and hopeful, like she missed me this summer. Like she still wants to be my friend.  
  
  “Thanks,” I say again. I smile, reach for the box. She smiles shyly back and hands it over. Inside there are a couple DVDs, magazines, my dog-eared copy of Vampire Academy and a few other books, a pair of dress shoes I loaned her for prom.  
  
  “How was Italy?” she asks as I set the box down next to the door. “I got your postcard.”  
  
  “It was beautiful.”  
  
  “I bet,” she says with an envious sigh. “I’ve always wanted to backpack around Europe. I want to see London, Paris, Vienna….” She smiles. “Hey, how about you show me your pictures? I’d love to see them. If you have time.”  
  
  “Um, sure.” I run upstairs to get my laptop, then sit down with her on the living room sofa and cruise through my photos of this summer, her shoulder pressing into mine as we look at pictures of the Coliseum, the Roman arches, the catacombs, Tuscany with its vineyards and rolling hills, Florence, me making that dumb “I’m holding it up” pose at the Leaning Tower of Pisa.  
  
  And then up flashes a picture of Angela and Phen at the top of St. Peter’s.  
  
  “Wait, go back,” Wendy says as I click past it.  
  
  I reluctantly press the back button.  
  
  “Who’s that?” she breathes.  
  
  I get it. Phen is hot. There’s something magnetic about those brown eyes of his, the manly perfection of his face and all that, but sheesh. Not Wendy, too.  
  
  “Just a guy we met in Rome,” I tell Wendy. That’s about as close to the truth as I can come without going into the gory details of Angela and her secret, “swear you won’t tell anybody, Clara” boyfriend. Who is, according to her, a summer thing only. She’s been all “Phen who?” ever since we returned to Wyoming, like she never even met the guy.  
  
  “Did I mention that I want to go to Italy?” Wendy says, raising her eyebrows. “Wow.”  
  
  “Yeah, there are a lot of hot guys there,” I admit. “Of course, then they become beer-bellied middle-aged men in Armani suits with slicked-back hair who look at you like ‘How you doing?’” I give her my best pervy Italian grin, tilt my chin up, blow an air kiss at her.  
  
  She laughs. “Ew.”  
  
  I close my laptop, glad to get the subject off Phen. “So, that was Italy.” I pat my stomach. “I gained like five pounds in pasta.”  
  
  “Well, you were too skinny before, anyway,” Wendy says.  
  
  “Gee, thanks.”  
  
  “I hate to be the party pooper, but I should go,” she says. “I’ve got loads to do at home before tomorrow.”  
  
  We stand, and I turn to her, instantly choked up at the idea of saying good-bye. “You’re going to do awesome at Washington State and have all kinds of fun and become the best vet ever, but I am so going to miss you,” I say.  
  
  Her eyes are misty, too. “We’ll see each other on breaks, right? You can always email me, you know. Don’t be a stranger.”  
  
  “I won’t. Promise.”  
  
  She hugs me. “Bye, Clara,” she whispers. “Take care.”  
  
  When she’s gone, I gather up the box, take it to my room, and close the door. I dump the box out on my bed. There, among the things I loaned Wendy, I find some items from Tucker: a fishing lure that I bought him at a tackle shop in Jackson—his lucky Carrots lure, he called it—a pressed wildflower from one of the wreaths he used to make for my hair, a mixed CD I made him last year, full of songs about cowboys and songs about flying and songs about love, which he listened to a bunch of times even though he must have thought it was corny. He’s giving it all back. I hate how much this hurts me, how much I’m clearly still hanging on to what we had, so I put the stuff all carefully back in the box, and I seal the box with tape and slide it into the shadows at the back of my closet. And say good-bye.  
  
  Clara.  
  
  I hear the voice in my head, calling my name, before I hear it out loud. I’m standing in the quad at Stanford University, in the midst of more than fifteen hundred teeming freshmen and their parents, but I hear him loud and clear. I push through the crowd, looking for his wavy dark hair, the flash of his green eyes. Then suddenly there’s a break in the people around me and I see him, about twenty feet away, standing with his back to me. As usual. And as usual, it’s like a bell chimes inside me in a kind of recognition.  
  
  I cup my hands around my mouth and call, “Christian!”  
  
  He turns. We weave toward each other through the crowd. In a flash I’m by his side, grinning up at him, almost laughing because it feels so good to be together again after so long.  
  
  “Hey,” he says. He has to talk loudly to be heard over the people around us. “Fancy meeting you here.”  
  
  “Yes, fancy that.”  
  
  It doesn’t occur to me until right this minute how much I’ve missed him. I was so busy missing other people—my mom, Jeffrey, Tucker, Dad—caught up in all that I was leaving behind. But now … it’s like when part of you stops hurting and suddenly you’re yourself again, healthy and whole, and only then do you understand that you’ve been in pain for a while. I missed his voice in my head, in my ears. I missed his face. His smile.  
  
  “I missed you, too,” he says bemusedly, bending to say it next to my ear so I can hear him over the noise.  
  
  His warm breath against my neck makes me shiver. I step back awkwardly, suddenly self-conscious. “How was the boonies?” is all I can think to say.  
  
  His uncle always takes him into the mountains during the summers, spends the whole time hard-core training, away from the internet and television and any other distractions, and makes him practice calling glory and flying and all other angel-related skills. Christian calls it his “summer internship,” acts like it’s only a step up from army boot camp.  
  
  “Same old routine,” he reports. “Walter was even more intense this year, if you can believe that. He had me up at the crack of dawn most days. Worked me like a dog.”  
  
  “Why?” I start to ask, then think better of it. What’s he training you for?  
  
  His eyes get serious. I’ll tell you later, okay?  
  
  “How was Italy?” he asks me out loud, because it’ll look weird to people if we’re standing here facing each other, not saying anything, while we carry out an entire conversation in our heads.  
  
  “Interesting,” I say. Which has got to be the understatement of the year.  
  
  Angela picks this moment to appear at my side. “Hi, Chris,” she says, lifting her chin in greeting. “How’s it going?”  
  
  He gestures at the crowd of excited freshmen milling around us. “I think reality is finally starting to settle in that I’m going here.”  
  
  “I know what you mean,” she says. “I needed to pinch myself when we drove down Palm Drive. What dorm are you in?”  
  
  “Cedro.”  
  
  “Clara and I are both in Roble. I think that’s across campus from you.”  
  
  “It is,” he says. “I checked.”  
  
  He’s glad that he ended up with a dorm across campus from us, I understand as I look at him. Because he thinks I might not like it if he’s always around, picking the random thoughts out of my brain. He wants to give me some space.  
  
  I send him the mental equivalent of a hug, which surprises him.  
  
  What was that for? he asks.  
  
  “We need bicycles,” Angela’s saying. “This campus is so big. Everybody has bikes.”  
  
  Because I’m glad you’re here, I say to Christian.  
  
  
  I’m glad to be here.  
  
  I’m glad you’re glad to be here.  
  
  We smile.  
  
  “Hey, are you two doing the mind-meld thing?” Angela asks, and then, as loudly as she can, she thinks, Because it is so annoying.  
  
  Christian gives a surprised laugh. Since when does she talk telepathically?  
  
  Since I’ve been teaching her. It was something to do on an eleven-hour flight.  
  
  Do you really think that’s a good idea? She’s loud enough as it is…. He’s joking, but I can tell he doesn’t love the thought of Angela being part of our secret conversations. That’s between us. It’s ours.  
  
  So far she hasn’t been able to receive, I say to ease his mind. She can only transmit.  
  
  So she can speak, but she can’t listen. How appropriate.  
  
  Ann-oy-ing, Angela says, folding her arms across her chest and glaring at him.  
  
  We both laugh.  
  
  “Sorry, Ange.” I sling an arm around her. “Christian and I have a lot of catching up to do.”  
  
  A flicker of worry passes over her face, but it’s gone so fast I wonder if I imagined it. “Well, I think it’s rude,” she says.  
  
  “Okay, okay. No mind-melding. I get it.”  
  
  “At least not until I learn to do it too. Which will be soon. I’ve been practicing,” she says.  
  
  “No doubt,” he says.  
  
  I catch the laughter in his eyes, bite back a smile. “So, have you met your roommate yet?” I ask him.  
  
  He nods. “Charlie. He wants to be a computer programmer. Married to his Xbox. How about you?”  
  
  “Her name’s Wan Chen, and she’s premed and extremely serious about it,” I report. “She showed me her schedule today, and it made me feel like a total slacker.”  
  
  “Well, you are a total slacker,” Angela points out.  
  
  “So true.”  
  
  “What about your roommate?” Christian asks Angela. Poor defenseless thing, he adds silently, which makes me snicker.  
  
  “I have two roommates—lucky, lucky me,” says Angela. “They’re total blondes.”  
  
  “Hey!” I object to her tone on the subject of blondes.  
  
  “And they’re complete fuzzies. One’s a communications major—whatever that means—and one is undecided.”  
There’s nothing wrong with being undecided.” I glance at Christian, a tad embarrassed about my undecidedness.  
  
  “I’m undecided,” he says. Angela and I stare at him, shocked. “What, I can’t be undecided?”  
  
  “I assumed you’d be a business major,” Angela says.  
  
  “Why?”  
  
  “Because you look really stellar in a suit and tie,” she says with false sweetness. “You’re pretty. You should play to your strengths.”  
  
  He refuses to rise to the bait. “Business is Walter’s thing. Not mine.”  
  
  “So what is your thing?” Angela asks.  
  
  “Like I said, I haven’t decided.” He gazes at me intently, the gold flecks in his green eyes catching the light, and I feel heat move into my cheeks.  
  
  “Where is Walter, anyway?” I ask to change the subject.  
  
  “With Billy.” He turns and points at the designated parent section of the quad, where, sure enough, Walter and Billy look like they’re deep in conversation.  
  
  “They’re a cute couple,” I say, watching Billy as she laughs and puts her hand on Walter’s arm. “Of course I was surprised when Billy called me this summer to tell me that she and Walter were getting married. I did not see that coming.”  
  
  “Wait, Billy and Walter are getting married?” Angela exclaims. “When?”  
  
  “They got married,” Christian clarifies. “July. At the meadow. It was pretty sudden.”  
  
  “I didn’t even know they liked each other,” I say before Angela can deliver the joke I know she’s cooking up about how Christian and I are now some kind of weird brother and sister, since his legal guardian has married my legal guardian.  
  
  “Oh, they like each other,” Christian says. “They’re trying to be discreet, for my sake, I guess. But Walter can’t stop thinking about her. Loudly. And in various states of undress, if you know what I mean.”  
  
  “Ugh. Don’t tell me. I’m going to have to scrub my brain with the little bit I saw in her head this week. Is there a bearskin rug at your house?”  
  
  “I think you just ruined my living room for me,” he says with a groan, but he doesn’t mean it. He’s happy about the Billy-Walter situation. He thinks it’s good for Walter. Keeps his mind off things.  
  
  What things? I ask.  
  
  Later, he says. I’ll tell you all about it. Later.  
  
  Angela lets out an exasperated sigh. “Oh my God, you guys. You are totally doing it again.”  
  
  After the orientation speeches, them telling us how proud we should be of ourselves, what high hopes they have for our futures, the amazing opportunities we’ll have while we’re at “the Farm,” as they call Stanford, we’re all supposed to head back to our dorms and get acquainted with one another.  
  
  This is the point when they tell the parents to go home.  
  
  Angela’s mom, Anna, who’s been her intensely quiet self, sitting in the backseat of my car reading her Bible for the entire thousand-mile trip, suddenly bursts into tears. Angela is mortified, red-cheeked as she escorts her sobbing mother out to the parking lot, but I think it’s nice. I wish my mom were here to cry over me.  
  
  Billy gives me another one of those encouraging shoulder squeezes. “Knock ’em dead, kid,” she says simply, and then she’s gone, too.  
  
  I pick a comfy sofa in the lounge and pretend to study the patterns on the carpet while the rest of the students are saying their own tearful good-byes. After a while a guy with short, dyed-blond hair comes in and sits across from me, sets a hefty stack of folders on the coffee table. He smiles, reaches out to shake my hand. “I’m Pierce.”  
  
  “Clara Gardner.”  
  
  He nods. “I think I’ve seen your name on a couple of lists. You’re in B wing, right?”  
  
  “Third floor.”  
  
  “I’m the fee here in Roble,” he says.  
  
  I stare at him blankly.  
  
  “P-H-E,” he explains. “It stands for peer health educator. Kind of like the doctor of the dorm. I’m where you go for a Band-Aid.”  
  
  “Oh, right.”  
  
  He’s looking at my face in a way that makes me wonder if I have food on it.  
  
  “What? Do I have the words clueless freshman tattooed across my forehead?” I ask.  
  
  He smiles, shakes his head. “You don’t look scared.”  
  
  “Excuse me?”  
  
  “Freshmen usually seem pretty terrified, first week on campus. They wander around like lost little puppies. Not you, though. You look like you’ve got things all under control.”  
  
  “Oh. Thanks,” I say. “But I hate to tell you, it’s an act. Inside I’m a nervous wreck.”  
  
  I’m not, actually. I guess next to fallen angels, funerals, and forest fires, Stanford feels like a pretty safe place. Everything’s familiar here: the California smells of exhaust and eucalyptus trees and carefully landscaped roses in the air, palm trees, the Caltrain noise in the distance, the same old varieties of plants that I grew up with outside the windows.  
  
  It’s the other stuff that scares me: the dark, windowless room in my vision, what’s going to happen in that place, the bad thing that’s happened before I end up hiding there. The possibility that this is going to be my entire life: one vague, terrifying vision after another, for the next hundred years. That’s what’s scary. That’s what I am trying very hard not to think about.  
  
  Pierce writes a five-digit number on a Post-it and holds it out. “Call me if you need anything. I’ll come running.”  
  
  He’s flirting, I think. I take the Post-it. “Okay.”  
  
  Just then Angela bustles in, running her hands down the sides of her leggings like she’s wiping off her mother’s emotions. She stops short when she sees Pierce.  
  
  She doesn’t look scared, either. She looks like she’s come to conquer.  
  
  “Zerbino, Angela,” she says matter-of-factly when Pierce opens his mouth to greet her. She glances at the folders on the table. “Have you got something in that pile with my name on it?”  
  
  “Yeah, sure,” he says, flustered, and rummages through the folders until he lands on Z and a packet for Angela. Then he fishes one out for me. He gets up. Checks his watch. “Well, nice to meet you, girls. Get comfortable. We’ll probably start our getting-to-know-you games in about five minutes.”  
  
  “What’s that?” Angela gestures to my Post-it as he walks away.  
  
  “Pierce.” I stare at his retreating back. “Anything I need, he’ll come running.”  
  
  She shoots a glance at him over her shoulder, smiles thoughtfully. “Oh, really? He’s cute.”  
  
  “I guess.”  
  
  “Right, I forgot. You only have eyes for Tucker still. Or is it Christian now? I can never keep track.”  
  
  “Hey. Like, ouch,” I say. “You’re being awfully rude today.”  
  
  Her expression softens. “Sorry. I’m tense. Change is hard for me, even the good changes.”  
  
  “For you? No way.”  
  
  She drops into the seat next to mine. “You seem relaxed, though.”  
  
  I stretch my arms over my head, yawn. “I’ve decided to stop stressing about everything. I’m going to start fresh. Look.” I dig around in my bag for the rumpled piece of paper and hold it up for her to read. “Behold, my tentative schedule.”  
  
  Her eyes quickly scan the page. “I see you took my advice and enrolled in that Intro to Humanities class with me. The Poet Re-making the World. You’ll like it, I promise,” she says. “Interpreting poetry’s easy, because you can make it mean pretty much whatever you want it to mean. It will be a cakewalk kind of class.”  
  
  I seriously doubt that.  
  
  “Hmm.” Angela frowns as she reads farther down. “Art history?” She quirks an eyebrow at me. “Science, Technology, and Contemporary Society? Intro to Film Studies? Modern Dance? This is kind of all over the place, C.”  
  
  “I like art,” I say defensively. “It’s simple for you, since you’re a history major, so you take history classes. But I’m—”  
  
  “Undecided,” she provides.  
  
  “Right, and I didn’t know what to take, so Dr. Day told me to enr  
oll in a bunch of different classes and then drop the ones I didn’t respond to. But look at this one.” I point to the last class on the list.  
  
  “Athletics 196,” she reads above my finger. “Practice of Happiness.”  
  
  “Happiness class.”  
  
  “You’re taking a class on happiness,” she says, like that has got to be the most total slacker class in the universe.  
  
  “My mom said I was going to be happy at Stanford,” I explain. “So that’s what I intend to be. I’m going to find my happiness.”  
  
  “Good for you. Take charge of yourself. It’s about freaking time.”  
  
  “I know,” I say, and I mean it. “I’m ready to stop saying good-bye to things. I’m going to start saying hello.”  
  
  2  
  
  BAND RUN  
  
  That night I wake up at two in the morning to somebody pounding on my door.  
  
  “Hello?” I call out warily. There’s a jumble of noise from outside, music and people shouting and frantic footsteps in the hall. Wan Chen and I both sit up, exchange worried glances, and then I slide out of bed to answer the door.  
  
  “Rise and shine, dear freshmen,” says Stacy, our RA, in a chipper voice. She’s wearing a neon-green plastic circle around her neck and rainbow clown hair. She grins. “Put your shoes on and come out front.”  
  
  Outside we’re met by a scene that seems straight out of those bad acid trips you see in the movies: the Stanford marching band in what appears to be mostly their underwear and glow-in-the-dark necklaces and bracelets and stuff, rocking their respective instruments, trumpets blaring, drums beating, cymbals crashing, the school mascot in his big green pine tree costume zooming around like a crazy man, a bunch of half-dressed, partially glowing students jumping and bumping and whooping and laughing. It’s incredibly dark, like they’ve turned out the streetlights for the occasion, but I search for Angela and spot her looking supremely annoyed, standing next to two blond girls—her roommates, I assume. I weave my way over to them.  
  
  “Hi!” Angela yells. “You have bed hair.”  
  
  “This is insane!” I shout, combing through my hair with my fingers, with little success.  
  
  “What?” she screams.  
  
  “Insane!” I try again. It’s so unbelievably loud.  
  
  One of Angela’s roommates gapes and points behind me. I turn to see a guy wearing a Mexican-style wrestling mask that covers his entire face. A shiny gold wrestling mask. And nothing else.  
  
  “My eyes, my eyes!” Angela shrieks, and we all start giggling hysterically, and then the song is over, and we can hear again, and they’re telling us to run.  
  
  “Run, little freshmen, run!” they scream, and we do, like a herd of confused, stampeding cattle in the dark. When we finally stop, we’re at the next dorm over, and the band starts up again, and pretty soon another crowd of bleary and baffled freshmen begins to filter out of the doors.  
  
  I’ve lost Angela. I look around, but it’s too dark and the crowd is too big to find her. I make out one of her roommates standing a few feet away from me. I wave. She smiles and pushes her way over to me like she’s relieved to see a familiar face. We bob halfheartedly to the music for a few minutes before she leans over and yells next to my ear, “I’m Amy. You’re Angela’s friend from Wyoming?”  
  
  “Right. Clara. Where are you from?”  
  
  “Phoenix!” She hugs her sweatshirt tighter around her. “I’m cold!”  
  
  Suddenly we’re moving again. This time I make it a point to stay close to Amy. I try not to think about how this feels eerily similar to my vision in some ways, running around in the dark, not knowing where I’m going or what I’m going to end up doing. It’s supposed to be fun, I know, but I find this whole thing a bit creepy.  
  
  “Do you have any idea where we are?” I pant out to Amy the next time we stop.  
  
  “What?” She can’t hear me.  
  
  “Where are we?” I yell.  
  
  “Oh.” She shakes her head. “No clue. I’m guessing they’re going to make us run all the way across campus.”  
  
  I remember how on the tour they told us that Stanford has the largest campus of any university in the world aside from one in Russia.  
  
  It could be a long night.  
  
  There’s still no sign of Angela or the other roommate, who Amy tells me is named Robin, so Amy and I stick together and dance and laugh at Naked Guy and shout out a conversation the best we can. In the next half hour here’s what I find out about Amy: we were both raised with single mothers and little brothers, we’re both thrilled that tater tots are served at breakfast in the Roble dining hall every morning and horrified at how tiny and claustrophobic the shower stalls in the bathrooms are, and we both suffer from annoyingly unruly hair.  
  
  We could be friends, I realize. I could have made my first new friend at Stanford, just this easily. Maybe there’s something to this making-us-run thing.  
  
  “So what’s your major?” she asks as we’re jogging along.  
  
  “Undecided,” I answer.  
  
  She beams. “Me too!”  
  
  I’m liking her more and more. But then disaster strikes. As we come up on the next dorm, Amy stumbles and falls. Down to the pavement she goes, all flailing arms and legs. I do my best to make sure she doesn’t get trampled by the ever-growing stream of scrambling freshmen, then drop to the sidewalk next to her. It’s bad. I can tell just by looking at her white face and the way she’s clutching her ankle.  
  
  “I stepped wrong.” She groans. “God, this is embarrassing.”  
  
  “Can you stand up?” I ask.  
  
  She tries, and her face gets even whiter. She sits back down heavily.  
  
  “Okay, that’s a no,” I deduce. “Don’t go anywhere. I’ll be right back.”  
  
  I mill around looking for someone who seems even a little bit helpful and miraculously spot Pierce at the edge of the crowd. Time to put his “dorm doctor” skills to good use. I run over to him and touch him on the arm to get his attention. He smiles when he sees me.  
  
  “Having fun?” he yells.  
  
  “I need your help,” I yell.  
  
  “What?” he yells.  
  
  I end up taking him by the hand and dragging him over to Amy and pointing at her ankle, which is starting to swell. He spends several minutes kneeling beside her, gently holding her ankle between his hands. Turns out that he’s premed.  
  
  “It’s probably a sprain,” he concludes. “I’ll call someone to give you a ride back to Roble, and we’ll get it elevated and put some ice on it. Then you should go to Vaden—the student clinic—in the morning, get an X-ray. Just hang in there, all right?”  
  
  He walks off to find somewhere quieter to use his phone. The band finishes its song and moves on, leading the crowd away from us in a rumble of feet. Finally I can hear myself think.  
  
  Amy starts to cry.  
  
  “I’m so sorry,” I say, sitting down next to her.  
  
  “It doesn’t hurt that much,” she sniffles, wiping at her nose with the back of her sweatshirt. “I mean, it hurts—a lot, actually—but that’s not why I’m crying. I’m crying because I did something so totally stupid like wear flip-flops when they told us to put on shoes, and this is only the first week of school. I haven’t even started classes yet, and now I’m going to be hopping around on crutches, and everyone’s going to label me as that klutzy girl who hurt herself.”  
  
  “Nobody will think less of you. Seriously,” I say. “I bet there are plenty of injuries happening tonight. It’s all pretty crazy.”  
  
  She shakes her head, sending a tumble of wild blond curls over her shoulders. Her lip quivers. “This is not how I wanted to start things,” she chokes out, and buries her face in her hands.  
  
  I glance around. The group has moved far enough away that we can only faintly hear them. Pierce is standing next to the building with his back to us, talking into his cell. It’s dark. No one’s around.  
  
  I lay my hand gently on Amy’s ankle. She tenses, like even this light touch is hurting her, but doesn’t lift her head. Through my empathy I can feel the hurt in her, not only the way she’s mentally  
beating herself up over how she’s already ruined her reputation, but the physical part, too, the way the ligaments in her ankle are pulled away from the bone. It’s a bad injury, I know instantly. She could be on crutches all semester.  
  
  I could help her, I think.  
  
  I’ve healed people before. My mom after she was attacked by Samjeeza. Tucker after our post-prom car accident last year. But those times I had the full circle of glory around me, the whole shebang, light emanating from my hair, my body glowing like a lantern. I wonder if there’s a way to localize the glory to just, say, my hands, to channel it fast so that nobody will notice.  
  
  I clear my head, glad for the relative quiet, and focus my energy on my right hand. Just the fingers, I think. All I need is glory in my fingers. Just once. I concentrate on it so hard that a bead of sweat moves along my hairline and drips down onto the concrete, and after a few minutes the very tips of my fingers start to glow, dimly at first and then more brightly. I press my hand firmly to Amy’s ankle. Then I send the glory out of me like a trickle of light spreading from me to her, not too much or too fast but hopefully enough to do some good.  
  
  Amy sighs, then stops crying. I sit back, watching her. I can’t tell if what I did helped at all.  
  
  Pierce comes back over, looking apologetic. “I can’t find anyone to come get you. I’ll have to run and get my car, but it’s on the other side of campus, so it will take a while. How are you doing?”  
  
  “Better,” she says. “It doesn’t hurt as much as before.”  
  
  He kneels down next to her again and examines her ankle. “It looks better, actually, not as swollen. Maybe you just twisted it. Can you try to walk?”  
  
  She gets up and gingerly puts her weight on her injured foot. Pierce and I watch as she limps a few steps, then turns back to us. “It feels okay now,” she admits. “Oh my God, am I a drama queen or what?” She laughs, her voice full of relief.  
  
  “Let’s get you back to your room,” I stammer out quickly. “You still need to put some ice on that, right, Pierce?”  
  
  “Absolutely,” he says, and we get on either side of her and walk her slowly back to Roble.

1mtu07t,https://i.redd.it/q9ev08c4ktjf1.png,Managing Entra PIM Should Be Boring (And That’s a Win for Security!),"Rolling out or cleaning up privileged access used to mean hand-built scripts, one-off commands, and a healthy dose of anxiety about what might break. 😅

With the latest EasyPIM release, *Invoke-EasyPIMOrchestrator* lets you run your entire PIM model from a **single JSON** configuration file.

No more “script archaeology.” No more copy/paste tweaks. 

Just: edit config → preview → apply. 🛠️

**What this unlocks for PIM admins:**

🗂️ Single Source of Truth: Policies, assignments, and safety exclusions are all in one place—easy to review, easy to audit.

🛡️ Safe by Design: Every run can be a dry run (-WhatIf). See exactly what would change before you commit.

🌱 Progressive Adoption: Start small (protect break-glass accounts), then layer in policies and assignments—no risky “big bang.”

♻️ Reusable Templates: Define security patterns (e.g., high-risk roles) once and reuse everywhere.

🧹 Predictable Cleanup: Default delta mode only adds/updates—removals require an explicit “initial” reconcile.

👀 Drift Detection: Instantly spot when reality diverges from your intended standard.

⏳ Less Toil: Fewer manual clicks, fewer half-remembered CLI invocations.

✅ Confidence: Protected accounts can’t be accidentally wiped during cleanup.

**Results:Faster reviews, fewer surprises, and a cleaner least-privilege posture.** 

✨Behind the scenes:

This release required numerous “vibe coding” sessions—late nights, good music, and plenty of coffee. ☕I heavily relied on my Visual Studio Code’s chat catalyst extension [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LoicMICHEL.chat-catalyst](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LoicMICHEL.chat-catalyst) to keep context between sessions and stay productive. (If you haven’t tried it yet, it’s a game-changer for deep, focused development! 🚀)

Here is the science and how to use it now,"The sale does not flip at the desk. It starts about sixty seconds into the greet when they say sure to water. Stack enough small yeses and the close feels like their idea.

Why micro yeses work

\-Foot in the door. When someone says yes to a small ask, they are more likely to say yes to the next related ask.  
\-Consistency. Once a customer agrees out loud, they want to stay consistent with that choice.  
\-Halo effect. One good moment colors the rest of the experience. A quick win makes everything feel better.  
\-Positive emotion. Small wins improve mood and lower threat. People explore more and resist less.  
\-Endowment. Sitting in the seat and taking the wheel makes the car feel like it is already theirs.  
  
What this looks like on the floor  
\-First yes in thirty seconds. Water or the good coffee.  
\-Permission steps. Mind if I pull this into the shade so we can look without frying.  
\-One surprise and delight demo. Want to see one thing most people miss on this model.  
\-Value preview before the pencil. Would it help to see the monthly with and without the package you liked.

Read the signal, not just the nod.  
Lean in and real questions mean momentum.  
Fixed smile and no questions mean polite, not ready.   
Ease off and reset the next ask.

Why you need this  
\-More test drives turn into write ups.  
\-Fewer be back ghosts.  
\-Smoother desk outs with less arm wrestling.  
\-Happier CSI because the path felt natural.

If you want to run this like a system, I made a one page printable Micro Yes Tracker. It helps you plan the first yes, stack the next ones during demo and drive, and do a quick debrief after the pencil. Free download. Link in the first comment.

1mttwso,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeTested/comments/1mttwso/delve_into_the_best_coffee_machine_xbloom_studio/,Delve Into the Best Coffee Machine xBloom Studio Worth It,"Testing out the xBloom FW-02A-01 coffee machine has been quite the journey for me. I’ve established myself as someone constantly in search of that “perfect cup,” and this sleek, modern-looking device had me excited from the moment it arrived. I mean, when you hear about a coffee maker boasting integrated grinders, modular UI elements, and three levels of automation, expectations naturally skyrocket!  

**Minimalist but Functional Design**  
The design is stunning yet understated. Bathed in a matte midnight black finish, it feels right at home on the counter, blending perfectly with both modern and classic kitchen styles. Compactly sized at 8"" x 6.7"" x 14.75"", it isn't overly bulky, which made it fit well in my small coffee corner. The user interface stood out immediately—tactile knobs paired with an LED Matrix made navigation surprisingly intuitive. It’s rare to feel like you're piloting a spaceship while brewing your morning coffee, but this nailed that aesthetic.  

**Key Benefits**  
- Adjustable operation modes (Autopilot, Copilot, Freesolo) for tailored brewing.  
- Intuitive tactile knobs and LED Matrix make for seamless control.  
- Compact design with an impressive finish—sharp yet space-efficient.

**Unmatched Customization Options**  
Coming to functionality, this machine made me feel like a professional barista. The pour-over capability combined with a fully integrated grinder meant that I could go from bean to cup without needing extra gadgets cluttering the space. I found the anti-static features especially handy; grinding coffee beans usually leaves a mess on some machines, but the magnetic dosing cup worked like a charm, minimizing waste and keeping it clean. What’s even cooler? The xBloom app. It let me tweak recipes to perfection and save them for the next caffeine fix. Have I shared a few of my go-to blends with friends yet? You bet!  

**The Convenience of xPods**  
The inclusion of compostable xPods added a layer of sustainability that I appreciated. Each pod is filled with high-quality whole beans, eliminating the need for me to measure coffee or fiddle with filters manually. With a simple recipe card scan, all I had to do was pop the beans into the grinder along with the pod in its dock, and magic happened in the form of coffee! It’s the little things, like supporting eco-friendly practices, which make me want to stick to a product.  

**Making the Switch Between Automation Levels**  
Switching between the three automation levels was another highlight. Freesolo gave me complete control—it’s like brewing in manual mode for nerdy coffee enthusiasts like me. However, I soon fell in love with Copilot mode, which lets me tweak parameters halfway through the brewing. When I was in a rush getting ready for work, Autopilot saved the day, brewing an amazing cup with zero effort. I tested all three extensively, and each impressed me in its own right. Options for adjusting brew strength ensured that friends and family with varying preferences didn’t leave disappointed.  

**Drawbacks to Consider**  
Like all products, there’s always room for improvement.  
- The device is heavier than expected, weighing 11.3 pounds, and isn’t exactly mobile-friendly.  
- Some users might find it challenging to adapt to the high-tech interface initially, especially seniors less inclined to tech.  
- Using the xPods exclusively could limit personalization for those who prefer their own beans or specialty filters.  

**Competing Products**  
When compared to some market favorites, this coffee maker clearly leans into the premium side. I’ve used Breville’s Barista Express before, and while it delivers quality coffee, the xBloom offers significantly more automation and feels simpler for everyday use. On the other hand, the Technivorm Moccamaster is an admirable competitor in terms of performance, but it lacks the integrated features like grinding or recipe saving. Where xBloom shines is its seamless all-in-one design with app connectivity, which its counterparts haven’t fully embraced yet.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
Is this worth its price? Let’s talk value. Given the combination of high-end automation, grind-and-brew functionality, and premium design, it’s targeted towards people willing to invest in their coffee experience. Sure, it’s not for budget-conscious users, but for me, the wide range of customizable options and its eco-friendly approach make it worth the splurge. If you’re looking for something that simplifies your morning routine while delivering barista-grade results every time, the value’s absolutely there.

We have done fun things together, like going to poetry events and concerts. Last year, I, her friend A, and another friend took a trip to Las Vegas to see Adele perform. This was my first time on a plane, so I was a little nervous, but I was ok. Other things during this friendship that I don't think she realized would leave me rethinking whether I still want to be friends. Once, she asked if I wanted to go to the beach, and I said I would. She gave me a date and time that she would pick me up, so I waited, and the time came and went, and she didn't show up. Another time, she was having a birthday party, and she didn't add me to the group chat until a day or two before her party, but I didn't say anything about it. I still showed up and gave her a gift because I wanted to, and sent her $50 for her birthday. I even bought her a Keurig for Christmas a few years ago after I heard her talking about wanting to have iced coffee but didn't have a coffee maker, so I bought her one from Target. Even after our Vegas trip, we haven't talked to each other much. My birthday came around, and she sent a happy birthday message on Instagram, no physical gift, Venmo, or even a card, although she could have asked for my address. I check in with her occasionally, asking how she is, and to me, it seems like I'm always doing the work to make sure we have some connection between us, and nothing seems to work.
It's mostly Instagram likes between us now. There's always been talk about hanging out and getting coffee, but that never happens, yet I see her on Instagram having drinks in our hometown. A few weeks ago, I asked friend A if she wanted to go to an event for people over 30 and from 5pm to 10pm, where there's a DJ, food, and drinks. She left me on read and didn't say anything to me about it. Mind you, we live about 10 minutes away from each other, so it doesn't take much effort to get together and catch up. We both work in schools, and I thought we could do something fun this summer before she went back to work since we haven't seen or texted each other since November 2024. I feel like this friendship is one-sided, and I see her more as an acquaintance now in our adult years. I've thought about quietly quitting this friendship for a long time, but I end up feeling bad because how do you let go of someone you've known for 15 years?
