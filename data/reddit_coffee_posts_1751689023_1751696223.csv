## What is Kronix Pulseva?

Kronix Pulseva is an **automated trading platform** that uses advanced algorithms to help users buy and sell assets like crypto, stocks, forex, and commodities. It’s designed to simplify the trading process by analyzing market trends in real time and sending actionable alerts or executing trades automatically.

It’s targeted at both beginners who want a hands-off experience and more seasoned traders looking to streamline their strategies. The platform claims to use AI to predict market movements and optimize trade entries. Honestly, it feels similar to other platforms I’ve tested — like Immediate Edge — but with some unique touches that make it stand out.

## Who Created Kronix Pulseva?

The team behind Kronix Pulseva isn’t exactly front and center on their site, which is a little sketchy, but not uncommon for platforms in this space. Based on my research and some LinkedIn digging, the software seems to be developed by a group of fintech professionals with backgrounds in machine learning and financial modeling.

While it would be nice to have more transparency, the platform itself feels professionally built. It operates similarly to how Bitcoin Era functions — offering an auto-trading bot with manual override features — which suggests a solid development backbone.

## How Does Kronix Pulseva Work?

Kronix Pulseva uses a combination of **machine learning algorithms** and real-time data analysis to identify potentially profitable trades. Once configured, the system can either notify users of trading opportunities or execute trades automatically based on pre-set parameters.

You basically plug in your preferences — like risk tolerance, asset type, and trading style — and the platform does the heavy lifting. It scans the market 24/7, looking for trends, spikes, and dips. You can trade manually if you want, but for those of us who don’t have time to babysit charts, the **auto-trading feature** is a lifesaver.

## Kronix Pulseva Pros and Cons

Let’s be real — no platform is perfect. Here’s what stood out to me:

**Pros:**
- **Beginner-friendly interface** with minimal learning curve
- **Real-time analysis** that actually feels current
- **Supports multiple asset classes**, not just crypto
- **Solid mobile support** for trading on the go
- **Demo account** to test strategies risk-free

**Cons:**
- **No info on the dev team**, which might be a red flag for some
- **Not available in all countries**
- **Requires a $250 deposit**, which is standard but still a barrier
- **Still dependent on market volatility** — not a magic money printer

## What Devices Can be Used to Access Kronix Pulseva?

You can access Kronix Pulseva on pretty much any device with a browser. It’s **web-based**, so there’s no need to install anything. I tested it on:

- **Windows laptop** – no issues, runs smoothly
- **MacBook** – same experience, no hiccups
- **iPhone & Android** – the mobile site is optimized and responsive

There’s no dedicated app, but honestly, the mobile site is good enough. You can monitor trades, adjust settings, and withdraw funds without needing a computer.

## Kronix Pulseva – Supported Countries

Kronix Pulseva is available in most countries across **Europe, Asia, Australia, and South America**. However, there are some **restrictions in the U.S. and Canada**, likely due to regulatory reasons.

If you're unsure whether it works in your country, the sign-up page will let you know pretty quickly. Just enter your info and it’ll either accept or redirect you.

## Kronix Pulseva – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

This is where Kronix Pulseva shines. The platform pulls data from multiple sources, analyzes it with its algorithm, and delivers recommendations in real-time. I’ve compared it with other platforms, and the speed and accuracy are actually impressive.

### User-Friendly Interface

The dashboard is clean, intuitive, and doesn’t overwhelm you with charts and jargon. Even if you’re totally new to trading, you won’t feel lost here. It’s like the Google Docs of trading platforms — simple but effective.

### Mobile Accessibility

No app? No problem. The mobile version of the site is fully functional. I checked balances, adjusted settings, and even executed trades while waiting in line for coffee. It’s that smooth.

### Customizable Alerts

You can set alerts for price changes, market trends, or even specific asset movements. It’s super helpful if you’re trading manually and want to stay informed without constantly checking.

This isn’t just a crypto platform. Kronix Pulseva supports **crypto, forex, stocks, and commodities** — so you can diversify your portfolio without jumping between platforms.

## Is Kronix Pulseva a Scam?

Short answer: **doesn’t seem like it**.

I didn’t find any red flags during my testing. The deposit and withdrawal processes worked fine. Customer service responded quickly. And the platform didn’t promise any “get rich quick” nonsense. That said, always proceed with caution. No platform can guarantee profits, and you should never invest money you can't afford to lose.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Kronix Pulseva?

The minimum deposit is **$250**, which is pretty standard for platforms in this space. It’s enough to get started but not so much that it feels risky. You can deposit via:

- **Credit/debit card**
- **Bank transfer**
- **E-wallets (depending on region)**

### Kronix Pulseva Customer Support

Surprisingly solid. They offer **24/7 live chat**, and I tested it twice — once during the day and once at 3am. Both times, I got a response within 5 minutes. There's also an email option, but live chat is definitely faster.

## How do you start trading on Kronix Pulseva?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Go to the official Kronix Pulseva site and fill in your name, email, and phone number. It takes less than 2 minutes.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

After sign-up, you’ll need to verify your identity. Then, make the $250 deposit using one of the supported payment methods. This step activates your trading dashboard.

### Step 3: Start Trading

Once funded, you can either use the demo account or jump into live trading. You’ll be guided through setting up your preferences, and the platform will do the rest.

## How to Delete a Kronix Pulseva Account?

If you ever want to step away from trading, you can request account deletion through customer support. Just hit them up via live chat or email, and they’ll walk you through the process. Make sure to withdraw your funds before deleting.

Like, every time, it's the same boring vanilla latte. It's predictable, you know? But the other day, I felt this weird urge to totally mix it up. I walked in thinking, ""Today, I’ll get something new!"" But as soon as I got to the counter, fear hit hard... my mind was racing with thoughts like, ""What if I hate it? What if it’s embarrassingly horrible?"" 

I ended up blurting out ""macadamia nut milk cappuccino,"" which sounds pretty cool in theory, but omg I was shaking a bit afterward. It's just so funny how a small thing like ordering coffee can feel like a huge step. Anyway, the cappuccino turned out to be surprisingly delicious, and I felt this rush of satisfaction afterward. 

Sometimes these baby steps in trying new things teach me how freakin' ridiculous my brain can be. I mean, ordering a different drink shouldn’t be terrifying, right? 😂

I’ve been carrying a lot of emotional weight for months, and I finally decided to write everything down to make sense of it. I’m in a relationship that feels completely unbalanced. I give a lot — emotionally, physically, practically — and I feel like I get very little in return, except confusion, pain, and disappointment.

I’ve documented a lot of what happened between us over time — things he did, things he said, and how they made me feel. Some of it is emotionally intense, but I’m sharing it here in case others can help me see more clearly:
Am I overreacting? Is this normal relationship conflict, or is this emotional abuse?
I’m exhausted and I just need some outside perspective.

(Here’s what I wrote ↓)

❤️❤️❤️❤️💔💔💔💔
We had a fight cause I cleaned the house and touched his belongings, change place for it. He gad mad and I went out. After a few minutes he went out to find me and start running and fell. He yelled at me and said 50 times it was my fault. Showing me blood on his hand. I was crying, apologizing, feeling vulnerable. He pulled my sweater, my arm, hit my forehead when telling me things like I’m selfish, so that would “enter” better in my head.

❤️❤️❤️💔💔
In my last apartment when he got angry, yelled, and pulled the blanket that was “protecting” me. He ended up leaving the apartment.

❤️❤️💔💔💔
He slept with other girls while asking me to get tested. At the same time, he was asking me to make efforts. That was the first feeling of betrayal I experienced — a betrayal I associate with cheating.
Messages I had with him on Whattsapp: 
“Did you see anyone in the meantime?”
“I saw girls again, so it’s not 100% safe (you can never be sure), but normally it’s fine since it was previously tested.”
“Yes, but you didn’t answer me.”
“Yes.”

8 March 2024
❤️💔💔💔💔
He was also sleeping with other women when he knew I was coming to his town (for him). While I had my job contract and was looking for an apartment. Second betrayal (cheating). And he told me he couldn’t just say goodbye to his hookups like that — basically, I came after them.

Messages: 
“Have you seen other women or not? 😅 You can tell me, really.”
“Yes, but I’m getting attached to you.”

“You arrived and shook up a lot of things in my life. Things are changing, but it doesn’t happen overnight.”
“Well when I arrived you were single, but you were still seeing other people. I didn’t say ‘leave’ because I don’t know what to expect with you and didn’t want to be left looking like an idiot.”

24 March 2024
– He allows himself things he would never accept from me:
• Carrying a “girl / friend” on his shoulders.
• Calling his ex, several times, even during romantic dates in Italy with me.
• Threatening to break up every time we have a small disagreement. He’s done it many times.
• Keeping objects from his exes at his place. Refuses to throw them away.
• Keeping condoms — apparently, he didn’t think that knowing that could hurt me.
• Insulting me in front of his friends, calling me stupid.
• Dismissing my needs: cat = whim. Wanting to hide under a blanket = “You’re not Cleopatra / you’re acting like a child.”

– When I say I hope we’ll find each other again, I mean I hope we can fix these 💔 before there are no more ❤️ left. Each broken heart stands for a moment where he deeply disappointed me.

– The small acts of care: massages, meals, cake, small gifts… They always come from me. I’ve been telling him for 3 months that I’d love a massage, and not once did he think: “Hey, I’ll surprise her with one tonight.” Flowers? I mentioned it once and the following week he brought me flowers a few times — even nice pink ones at his college. But since then, nothing. Because I stopped begging. He no longer takes initiative like at the beginning, doesn’t suggest date ideas or outings.
He often says I never initiate anything — but for me, it’s up to the man to show he’s capable. The woman reflects it.

“Women reciprocate, they do not initiate. Men initiate.”
https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNdPSPqoT/

– Today, I no longer feel like I’m living for myself. I came to his town for him, I found a job, and now I’m quitting it for him cause I think of our future together and my actual job is keeping me too busy. I got fooled because while I was doing all that, he was still sleeping with other women. And during that time, he was asking me to make efforts and get STD tests.
I’ve been waiting for spontaneous gestures of affection that never come, while I give everything: handwritten letters with love messages, massages, sexually I gave a lot, massage oil, sexy outfits, whipped cream, surprise meals, all meals in general, vanilla coffee, tofu, multiple cakes.
I said “I love you” first, talked about a civil union (he rejected me), did my nails, Pokémon mug, hair removal, created a website for his business, made personalized advent calendar for him, helped with his rental paperwork, gave countless gifts.
I’ve ignored my VITAL need to have a cat, endured co-living with his dad.

In short, I literally put my life on hold to try to build his with him.
And now I find myself having to fight just to get something as simple as affection or a massage.

(Even on Valentine’s Day, I got nothing. He let me choose the restaurant, pay for dinner, write a long love letter. A ring I made for him myself. And he gave me back… a ring he didn’t even want to make at first — thanks to gis friend for insisting.)

– I’m exhausted.
– I need a cat.

One morning, while sipping bitter coffee and scrolling aimlessly through social media, he made a rule: **“Just 15 minutes a day. No matter what.”**

He started writing — badly. Then reading. Then jogging. All for 15 minutes.

Months passed. His book idea took form. His body grew stronger. His confidence quietly returned.

Two years later, he'd published his first novel, lost 30 pounds, and started a YouTube channel teaching others how to “plant minutes.”

It sounds kinda straightforward, right? But whenever someone would ask me for a favor—be it too much work, a hangout when I'm tired, or even the smallest errand—I used to just automatically agree. There was this weird guilt attached to turning someone down, like maybe I'd be seen as rude or unsupportive. 

But today, I had this lightbulb moment. I was standing in line for my usual latte when a coworker texted, asking if I could cover their shift last minute. Normally, I'd cave and say yes, even if it totally wrecked my plans. But today, I took a deep breath and simply replied, ""Sorry, can’t do it this time."" 

You know what? The world didn't end! I finished my coffee, had some extra time to hang with my pet, and felt a tiny wave of confidence wash over me.

I feel like this is one of the most tiring things about my condition - being forced to always think about what I’m doing right now, remembering each little step, being really careful not to miss anything. I’m scared to make drivers license for example because people say it gets easier when you get used to this. And I feel like I’m not getting used to things. Ever. 
It also takes lot of my energy at work. My tasks are repetetive - which I love - but days when I’m not „in the zone”, not getting the flow state are forcing me to discipline my attention so hard to not miss something. I have checklists for every little stupid thing - like sending an email…

Not having any decaf or caffeine at all because I’ve found decaf to be a slippery slope back into caffeinated drinks in the past. This time is just water and maybe a fruit smoothie now and then. 

The hardest thing so far has been the daytime fatigue I feel. It’s like my body is tired immediately after waking up until sometime in the afternoon. I’m starting a new job in another week, so hopefully I can tough this out and feel better by then. I also have some anger I’m experiencing throughout the day, but I can’t stay if that’s better or worse than before. 

Positives so far have been subtle, but I think my digestion and reflux are both a bit better. I used to get awful reflux symptoms (LPR mostly), and that would give me postnasal drip, tight chest, and sometimes actual heartburn. I also feel a bit less anxious than before, and I think my skin is perhaps a bit less oily.

So, my nervous system got irregular back in 2022, the big one happened at a restaurant, I had no idea what was happening and of course, that developed agoraphobia for a while and each time I would be out alone or with friends at a new place, I would feel very uncomfortable. 

Fast forward now, I don’t live with the uncomfortable feelings 24/7 and they don’t pop up as often or strong like they used to. However, yesterday my boyfriend and I visited a coffee place where we met, back in 2023, that day I was anxious and all uncomfortable. Yesterday I was all fine, but I was feeling slightly uncomfortable as my head was achy and I felt like the food wanted to come out. 

I would freak out some time ago, but now I think that it’s my body picking up that old register of that place from when I felt uncomfortable and my brain is trying to take me to “safety” by making me feel like that.

And well, here comes the question, would you advice me to “confront” those places by dedicating some exposure??

Where are we going? Straight to the abyss, but thankfully the machinery designed to get us there is slow and barely works, so we have quite some time before we get there. If only I could hop off the infernal machine and take a spanner to its inner entrails, really show it a piece of my mind. When I'd be done with that thing there'd be only a heap of scrap metal left. Who was the idiot who decided to put the systems in charge of the meat cattle? When are we, the hairless cows, the docile apes, the flightless chickens, going to take action as one united body and demand an end to this absurdity of a system? The answer is never, since the people hate each other far more than they hate the ruler of their life, in fact they love him, or should I say it, for the calm it brings them, the serenity of knowing that there is no human at the helm, rather a jumbled mess of metal and wiring.


Any other genius ideas for escaping our fate, Sir? And please don't tell me to grit my teeth and accept it, otherwise I'll dedicate my life to doing the exact opposite just out of spite. I want answers, real answers that get right down to the liquid-cooled core of our existence. Don't waste my time with your made up fantasy just-so solutions that sound so hollow I wonder how you can keep a straight face as you say them. Tell me the fucking truth! I don't care if it hurts, just stop lying to me. Nothing hurts more than the knowledge that you are living in a lie with no way of distinguishing fact from fiction. That is the real dream world, & contrary to popular belief it is not fun or exciting to live in. Do you really want to be drugged up & sent to the quiet house at the end of the street to shuffle around in all day like a geriatric boomer? Or do you want to be dumped on the edge of the treeline and sent out directly into the unknown? You call me a dreamer, I call you a loser. Do something before time does you from behind, it is not a merciful god. We live by the clock & we die by the clock, don't be late for dinner! :)


Behold the hands on the circle face spinning, look at them long enough and you will see the face of God, reflected right back at you from a cheap plastic disk.

It dwells in a world of beauty and divinity, you dwell in the world of application forms and cheap horror movies. After internalizing all of this, after feeling it deep within your fleshy heart, after all that has been said and written by a veritable army of men, women, & children; do you really think that you will be the one to crack the code and open the doors of eternity?

Part of me is embarrassed that she probably thinks that’s the way I am and I’m dog sitting for her soon but I also feel like I shouldn’t feel bad because her own house is messy and also I don’t think leaving a chip bag and a candy wrapper on the island is bad or the fact that I and a water cup on the tv table.

We dropped Lou and Erica off first. On our way to Savvy’s she told me I was not driving home.,"I sat and ate my dinner, reflecting on my marriage. Jason swept me off of my feet. We had a whirlwind romance a year and a half ago. We met at the coffee shop that I worked at part-time. He came in every morning and every afternoon for a black coffee and a pan-seared blueberry muffin for years. He ate and then went to wherever he worked. Most of our conversations were, hi and how are you, but that was about it.



One day he came in looking a little stressed. I asked if everything was okay. He had been coming there long enough that we were on a first-name basis. He told me he had a big client that he had to meet, but he didn’t have a date, and the meeting was in three hours. So, I volunteered. I only had an hour left until my shift ended. I gave him my phone number and address and told him I’d be ready.



Since I knew it was a business meeting, I didn’t go all out. I picked a below-the-knee-length black dress that stretched across my size fourteen body. It had thick straps and I had a little red half jacket that went with the dress. I was big-chested with a size D and the jacket helped hide the cleavage that the dress emphasized. I put on black heels to help my 5’3” stature get to 5’8”, and put up my long black hair in a ringlet bun with some hair coming down from the temples to frame my face. I kept my makeup with neutral tones to compliment my rounded face and light brown almond-shaped eyes, but wore a bold, dark red wine lip stain.



When Jason picked me up, his eyes admired me in the dress, and he told me I looked beautiful. When we got to the restaurant, he introduced me to his client. An older gentleman who was looking for office space. That’s when I realized Jason was a real estate agent. Conversation flowed. I had charmed the older man, and he signed with Jason. When his client left, Jason was excited and he thanked me. After that, he called me for every client meeting. Then we progressed from there into real friendship and then became romantically involved. That all happened in three months. He asked me to marry him. I said yes and we eloped.



My mother and Nana were all I had. My father died when I was fifteen, and he was forty in a car accident with my grandfather. Our family was devastated.



My mom and Nana live in Las Vegas, and I was in Yearling, Colorado living my so-called independent life. The pressure my Nana was putting on me when I was eighteen to get married and start a family right away, made me beg my mother to let me have five years to myself. So when I turned twenty, and graduated with my associates in business, I was granted those five years. I was twenty-three when I married Jason. They hated him. My mom and Nana wanted a grand wedding. Jason said he didn’t want to wait. They had only met over face time, because Jason was too busy to travel and mom said traveling wasn’t good for my Nana’s health. They were very mad that we eloped. I felt guilty at the time, but I was in love.



For the last year everything was grand. I was happy, I had a loving husband who spoiled me in and out of bed. He wanted me to quit the café because, in his words, he could provide for his wife with anything I needed. So, again, being in love, I agreed. But in the last six months he’s become distant. He blamed it on this new client of his. A tech billionaire that wanted twenty acres in Yearling, Colorado population seven thousand. Our town was picturesque. The buildings were big and old with lots of charm. The stores from the grocery store, hardware store, and clothing were all owned by people around town. Same with our local mechanics. The town wasn’t corrupted by big box stores or franchises. We didn’t have fast food in our town. We had family-owned restaurants, bakeries and cafés.



So it was big news that a billionaire was settling here. Jason, being one of three real estate agents in town, was fighting hard to get this person as a client. I, unfortunately, was not invited to meet this billionaire. He said he didn’t need me to help close this deal. So he went to dinner meetings by himself over the months. He had texted me earlier today to boast that he had signed the billionaire, but I was not invited to the celebratory dinner and to not wait up for him.



So, here I was eating dinner alone. I was hurt, his distance was tearing me apart inside. It wasn’t just not being invited to the dinners or his late nights at work, but it was also the constant texts at all hours of the day on his days off. He hadn’t even taken me out on a date in the last six months. Not since our first anniversary as a married couple. The next day, he met with the billionaire and that was the first night he came home late. Over the next couple of months, I felt ignored and neglected. Right before our anniversary, he said he wanted to start a family, and I was excited. We made love constantly but it didn’t happen. I was disappointed when I got my periods. I tried to initiate s\*x the other night, but he rebuffed me, telling me he was exhausted. I tried to be sympathetic because he had been working so hard pulling twelve to sixteen-hour shifts. I just didn’t know what to do anymore.



I sighed, picking up my plate and washing it. I looked at my phone. No texts or calls since he told me he signed his big client. It was only eight, but he told me that three hours ago. Were they still celebrating?



I decided to take a shower and climbed into bed with my laptop when I was done. Unbeknownst to Jason, I had been writing spicy stories for a website that paid authors for their imagination. I had been bored one evening reading on my phone and the website I had been reading on had an ad that said they were looking for authors with an exciting imagination. I wrote a lot of short stories in high school. I took a creative writing course online when I was twenty and twenty-one. So I took a chance and it paid off. I am now an exclusive writer for the site and have been for the last four months. I wanted to tell Jason about it, but I hardly ever saw him, and being a little pissed about how he'd been treating me, I decided to keep it to myself. I opened my own bank account under my mother's name at her insistence. Her reasoning was that a girl should have her own money. I had rolled my eyes at her at the time. But I did as she insisted. In the last four months, I’ve made quite a little nest egg.



I heard the front door shut, and I looked at the time on my laptop. I had been writing for four hours. The time got away from me. I shut my laptop down and set it aside just as Jason walked through our bedroom door.



“Hey, I told you not to wait up,” he slurred.



My brows furrowed.



“Did you drive home drunk?”



“No, I got dropped off by Mr. Montgomery’s driver, left my car at the office. Mr. Montgomery insisted on it.”



“Okay. Well, congratulations,” I said.



“Thanks babe, I’m going to jump in the shower,” he said as he stripped, and left his clothes on the floor, and walked into the bathroom stark naked. I sighed when I heard the water turn on. The d\*mn hamper was in the bathroom. Why didn’t he take his suit in there?



I got out of bed and picked up his suit. I went through his jacket pockets and took out his wallet, car keys and phone and set them on our dresser. I fished through his pants pocket and felt a weird material in his left one. I took it out and inhaled sharply. I dropped the item to the floor. Lying there, at my feet, was a pair of red lacy underwear. Those were definitely not mine. Why would he have some woman's underwear in his pocket? My body started to sweat, and I felt nausea roll through me. No, no way has Jason cheated on me. I dropped his jacket and pants and sprinted out of our room to the hall bathroom. I luckily made it to the toilet and threw up my dinner.



My mind was reeling. There was no way my loving husband had cheated on me. But thinking about the distance the last six months, something in my mind said it could be possible. I stood to my feet. I rinsed my mouth out with water and washed my hands. I found some mouthwash under the sink and I swished the burning liquid around my mouth. Tears sprang to my eyes. I blamed it on the mouthwash.



I went back into the room and Jason was standing there with his suit in his hand, staring at the panties on the floor. When I stepped in, his eyes shot to mine.



“Don’t freak out, it’s not what you think,” he said.



“So you haven’t been having an affair?”



“God, no baby,” he said, dropping his suit on the bed.



He came towards me, hands outstretched to cup my face, but I dodged him and scooted by him to the other side of the bed, putting it between us.



He sighed and dropped his hands to his side.



“Look, Mr. Montgomery is an old-fashioned man. I’ve been taking him to Denver to eat in fancy restaurants, and sometimes we end up at a strip club or two. That’s where I was tonight. Those must be from a stripper. I don’t know how they got into my pocket.”



“So, you took your billionaire client to a strip club, and have been while you schmoozed him. That’s why I was never invited out with you? I’ve helped you schmooze other clients before, Jason?”



“Yeah, I know honey, but Mr. Montgomery is single, he’s older, and I was trying to be a man’s man. And to do that, I needed to cater to his needs. That’s how I landed him.”



I nodded, it seemed plausible. I stared at him looking for a lie, but I just couldn’t see it. He looked remorseful.



“Baby, I would never cheat on you. I love you. Please believe me. I’m sorry for keeping this from you. You are my life. It won’t happen again, I promise.”



“Okay,” I whispered. He visibly relaxed. He ran his hand through his hair. I climbed back into bed. “Please get rid of those panties.” I laid on my side, turning away from him. My heart still ached, but I believed him. I hope I wasn’t being naive and st\*pid.



Chapter 2

Isha



“There’s an awards ceremony in Denver. Tomorrow night. It’s for Realtor of the Year in the state of Colorado,” Jason said. We were sitting at the breakfast table.



Since we had woken up, he’s been keeping up a running commentary. I’ve been silent. He tried to make love to me in the middle of the night when he finally came to bed. I told him I was on my period, so he asked if I’d blow him. I said no. Then he whined about needing a release. So I gave him a hand job, and the whole time he was moaning in ecstasy and telling me how good it felt. All I could think of was that he was thinking about the stripper with the red lacy underwear. I squeezed him hard then, and he groaned loudly and jacked his hips until he exploded. He praised me for the best hand job ever. I got up and washed my hands, then went back to bed where he was passed out.



“Am I invited to it?” I asked.



He sighed loudly, “Isha, yes, you're my wife.”



“Just wondering, didn’t know if you needed to keep up appearances of being single and a man’s man.”



He groaned loudly this time.



“Isha. I apologized last night. Can you please forgive me?”



“Yeah, fine. What’s the dress code?”



“Fancy cocktail.”



“What time?”



“We have to be there at six.”



“Okay, are you going to be late tonight? Should I bother making dinner?”



“I’ll be here baby. No more late nights, I got the client what he needed.”



I nodded, hoping this was true.



He got up and leaned over to kiss me. I turned my face and his lips brushed my cheek.



“We’ll get us back,” he whispered.



He then left, and I let out a pent-up breath. My phone rang five minutes later.



“Nana, hello.”



“Hello my sweet girl. How are you today?”



“I am fine.”



“You don’t sound fine,” she said.



“I am Nana. How are you and mom doing?”



“We are good. Your mother is taking me to Arizona Charlie’s for breakfast. Then we are going to Bingo all day long.”



I smiled, my mom and Nana loved bingo. They were addicted, which I don’t blame them for. They won more than lost. It was a great pastime for them. Since the deaths of my dad and grandfather, they’ve glommed on to each other. I was grateful that my mom and Nana got along. Nana was my dad’s mom. She was seventy years old, still spry for her age. She was tall at 5’9. She was a model when she was younger. Her red hair was now gray, but she still had bright blue eyes. She was Irish like my grandfather. When they met my mother, they were enamored by her exotic beauty. My mom was full Filipina, and my dad fell instantly in love with her. She applied to be his secretary and was hired because of her looks alone. My dad took one look at her, and despite her lack of working experience, because of her young age, he hired her on the spot. My mom had great organizational skills and typed a hundred and twenty words a minute. She helped my father build his law firm to the success it was today. When he died, his best friend Mark Jensen took the firm over. I secretly think she and my uncle Mark have feelings for each other. She still works there and is the head admin. She is Uncle Mark’s personal assistant too. I’ve tried to encourage her to give him signals that she’s interested, but she just scoffs and blushes at me over face time.



“We are just friends,” she’d say to me. I once said friends with benefits, and I got scolded for twenty minutes. A pissed-off Filipina mother is scary.



“Bingo sounds fun. I wish I could be there.”



“We do too. You should come for a visit. Maybe bring that husband of yours, and we could finally meet him face to face.”



“Maybe he did just bag his biggest client, he should get a great commission from it. We could use a vacation,” I said. Maybe rekindle our love.



“Oh, that would be wonderful. Well, your mother is yelling at me to hurry. I love you sweet girl.”



“I love you too, Nana. You and mom have fun.”



I opened the freezer after getting off of the phone and pulled out two steaks. I decided to make twice-baked potatoes to go with it. I figured I could get it ready and put it in the fridge to pop in the oven when it was close for Jason to come home.



After prepping dinner, I went to the gym. I was still a size fourteen. No matter what I did, my curves never changed. I wasn’t complaining though. I was big br\*asted, had wide hips and a high-rounded butt. I got my curves from Nana’s side. Her mother and sisters were like me. She was the only one that took after her dad. I wasn’t fat. My arms and legs were toned, my stomach wasn’t flabby, but it wasn’t completely skinny and flat either. I thought I was cute, my confidence was positive, although after last night, I felt I needed a boost.



I warmed up on the treadmill for ten minutes and then went to a squat bar. I was in the middle of squats when I saw that Brad, the gym manager, was drooling over the statuesque blonde he was showing the gym to. She was beautiful, her honey-blonde hair was in a high ponytail, she had a very small waist, and she was perky all over. Her legs were long, and she looked to be just an inch or two shorter than Brad's six feet. They were coming my way, so I put the bar in place. I bent to grab my towel from a bench and wiped my face and hands.



“Isha, this is Madilyn Montgomery. She just moved to town. Her father is that billionaire tech.”



“Oh, hello, I’m Isha Baxter, Jason’s wife. He is your father’s real estate agent.”



“Oh, yes, I know Jason. I met him at some of the dinners I went to with my father.”



I felt my smile dim a little. “Oh, that’s nice. So are you looking to join the gym? No better one than Brad’s place. There’s even a pool, hot tub and sauna in the lower level,” I said. Brad beamed at me with appreciation.



“Yes, daddy’s gym won’t be ready for use for a while, so I need a place to stay in shape. Don’t want to get fat, my boyfriend wouldn’t like that,” she said, eyeing me up and down.



Brad furrowed his brow and took a step away from her.



“Well, if you choose my gym, we have no judgments here. We encourage, not discourage,” Brad said.



“Oh, I wasn’t discouraging anyone. Just saying my boyfriend likes me skinny. Well it was nice to meet you Isha, was it?”



I nodded. “Welcome to Yearling.”



She gave me a practice perfect smile. Her presence made me feel uneasy. But before I could get too much in my head, a friend called out to me.



“Yoohoo, Isha.”



I looked over at the gorgeous woman that called out to me.



“Savvy!”



Savvy was a woman I met three years ago on my twenty-first birthday. She was five years older than me, but you wouldn’t know it. We looked like sisters. We both had black hair and light brown eyes. We were both light-skinned with our half-white heritage, but she was half Spanish, and I was half Filipina. Her eyes were more rounded than my almond-shaped ones, and her face was thinner. Well, she was thinner all over. She had the cutest four and three-year-olds, and her two husbands, Jack and Mac, were Adonis'. They were former firefighters, but now they live on some land on the outskirts of Yearling and have their own homestead.



Savvy had come into the café on my birthday, and I was wearing a birthday sash. She tipped me a hundred dollars and told me happy birthday. She took her two kids, who were fifteen months and a newborn at the time, and went to sit down. When I brought her her order, her little girl was breastfeeding, and her baby boy was fussing. I sat her order down and asked if I could help.



She let me take little Axel out of his carrier and I rocked him while Willow fed on Savvy. She had thanked me fiercely and told me her husbands were just down the street picking up animal feed. She threw me for a loop with that statement. Then she told me her life story and how she and her husbands met.



“And they’re together also?” I had asked, fascinated.



She nodded and smiled. Then they walked in, and I gasped, and she let out the loudest laugh. Mac and Jack looked at her and smiled. I fell half in love with them. She teased me mercilessly. Jack and Mac were huge flirts and had me blushing the whole time. Savvy didn’t mind in the slightest.



Every time I would take an order to a table, and we got a lull with the crowd, I would sit with them, hold their kids and we would talk. I told them about my life story and then said that I hoped to find a love as strong as theirs. They all said that one day I would. Then I met Jason a year and a half later, and I thought I had. Now, I wasn't so sure.



“How are the kids, Mac and Jack? I haven’t seen you guys in a while.”



“Everyone is doing great. Willow is getting so big and bossy. She tells Axel what to do all the time, and he just nods and goes along with it.”



I chuckled. “I miss seeing those two.”



“How’s Jason?”



I lost my smile and her eyes got big.



“How about we go to the café? I can skip my workout today.”



“Let me take a quick shower, and I’ll meet you over there?”



She nodded and left. She was a good friend and I needed someone to talk to.



Chapter 3

Isha



I walked into the café where I used to work. I waved at Kevin, who was my old boss and the owner of the café. I saw Savvy already had our drinks and I walked over to her. I dropped my bag on the ground and sat across from her. She handed me my cup.



“Spill. I texted Jack to let him know that I was with you so he wouldn’t freak out when I wasn’t home in an hour. He and Mac get worried if I take a minute too long without texting one of them. It took me forever to get them to stop following me everywhere.”



I laughed, “They love you.”



“Yeah they do. Now talk. I can see something is wrong.”



“Well, maybe you can give me some advice. Since I know your history.”



She got a sympathetic look in her eye and I sighed.



“I think Jason is cheating on me. Now I don’t really have any real proof. It’s not like when you caught your husband kissing another woman and then later saw video evidence. But it is kind of like the neglect Brian put you through.”



“He’s helping a female neighbor too much? Getting attached?”



“No. He works late, staying out until midnight or later. There’s a lot of texting going on during his days off. He claims it was because of this big billionaire tech guy he was trying to land who wanted twenty acres of land. He hasn’t touched me in months. And then yesterday he texted me that he had finally got the billionaire to sign his land and housing contract, and to not wait up. I used to go to all his dinner meetings to help him schmooze the clients, and then when they signed I would celebrate with them. But last night he came home real late. He stripped and took a shower. I picked up his suit and found red lacy panties in a pocket. I had a reaction and ran to the hall bathroom to puke. When I came back, he was staring at the panties. He said it wasn’t what I thought and explained that this billionaire guy was a quote, “man’s man,” end quote, whatever that is supposed to mean. He took him to a strip club in Denver and a dancer must have shoved her panties in his pocket. It’s a plausible excuse, don’t you think?” I asked her desperately.



“It is. But what was his excuse for not bringing you to the dinners?” Savvy asked.



“Basically the same thing, that the billionaire was old-fashioned, and it wasn’t the first time they had ended up in a club. But this morning I met Mr. Montgomery’s daughter. That’s the billionaire, and she let me know that she knew my husband. They had met at client dinners.”



“Oh,” she said, shocked.



“Yeah, oh.” I said dejectedly. “She’s gorgeous, Savvy. Blonde, tall and slim. Everything is perky from her b-cup br\*asts to her pert little a\*s.”



“Hey, you’re gorgeous. Your body is to die for. Mac made a comment once that you had a nice a\*s. I agree with him. You do have a delicious a\*s Isha.”



I blushed. “Thank you.”



“Look, I’ll admit him not wanting s\*x for months and some of the other things do sound sus, but that man loves you. I’ve seen the way he looks at you.”



“Yeah, I would have thought that too. But he hasn’t looked at me in like six months. He says he’s exhausted. Okay fine, that could be an excuse for why there hasn’t been any s\*x. But Savvy, he doesn’t look at me. I think this morning was the first time he had in a long time because he knew he f\*cked up.”



“How about this? Mac and Jack can take the kids tonight. You and I can have a girls' night out. We’ll take an Uber to Denver, we’ll drink and dance. I’ll invite Louise and Erica. That way, Mac and Jack won’t have a conniption that we’re alone in the big bad city. And with the size of six foot Erica and all her two hundred pounds of pure muscle, that will ease their minds too,” she said, rolling her eyes.



I giggled. That sounded like fun. I hadn’t been out in ages and I loved Erica and Louise. They were married and owned Lou’s flower and bookshop called Sensation. Erica was a competitive bodybuilder. They were good people.



“I’d like that. What time?”



“How about seven o'clock, meet at my place? We can eat at a restaurant and then go clubbing?”



“Sounds great.” We chatted for a little while longer. She wanted to go shopping for a new outfit and I said I’d accompany her.



We had a blast trying on clothes. I settled on a really cute red halter shirt with a teardrop cutout that showed the girls well, and a pair of black tight skinny jeans. I had some boots that would go well with the outfit at home. Savvy got a pink mini-strapless dress that she said would drive Mac and Jack wild knowing what she was wearing at the club.



I said goodbye to her two hours later. It had been forever since I had so much fun shopping with a girlfriend.



I waved her off before I turned to my car to put my bags in. Something made me look down the street and I froze. Two blocks down, I saw Jason hugging Madilyn Montgomery. When they pulled back, he kissed her on the forehead. She turned from his embrace and walked the opposite way than me. I watched Jason as he watched her walk away. I pulled out my phone and dialed his number.



“Hey babe, I was just thinking about you.”



“Uh, huh, what are you up to?”



“Oh, I just had lunch with a client. She’s looking for her own place. She’s a little picky, so I might have to look a little farther out than town, but she wants to be close. So I have some bad news. I probably won’t make it home tonight. I have a lot of listings to slog through. This one might be tougher than Mr. Montgomery.”



“Right,” I said.



“Babe, please don’t be mad. I promise to be home by ten at the latest.”



“No, don’t worry. I won’t be home anyway. I’m going out tonight,” I said. I watched him jerk his head and a frown crossed his face.



“What? With who? Where?”



“Savvy, Erica and Louise. We’re going to Denver tonight to have a good time. We’re eating and then going clubbing. I don’t know when I’ll be home.”



“I don’t know if I want you doing that,” he said.



“I don’t care. You’re not going to be home anyway, right? I haven’t seen Savvy in a while. I need to go out.”



I saw him pinch the bridge of his nose.



“Fine. Just don’t get sh\*t faced drunk. And don’t take any drinks from strangers. And if you’ve put your drink down and come back to it, don’t drink it, just order a new one.”



“No need to sound so concerned.”



“I am, you’re my wife. You’re beautiful, and I know how men are.”



“Mhmm. I just bet you do.”



“What is that supposed to mean?”



“Whatever you want it to mean. I’ll see you when I get home, if you’ll be there.”



“Of course, I’ll be there. What’s gotten into you?”



“Nothing. I have to go.”



“Okay, I lo…”



I hung up on him. I watched him look at his phone like he couldn’t believe I had just done that. Then he smiled and started texting right away. I had a suspicious feeling I knew who he was texting.



I got in my car and drove home. When I pulled up into the driveway, I had no memory of the journey. One minute I was getting in my car the next I was pulling up the driveway. That was dangerous.



Did I just witness my husband cheat? Why would he hug and then kiss Madilyn on the forehead like that? Or even at all?



I walked into my house and dropped my bags in my room. My heart was beating hard and fast. I suddenly couldn’t breathe. I frantically looked at the bedside clock and saw it was 2 in the afternoon. I think I was having a panic attack. I grabbed my throat because it felt like I was choking. I broke out in a sweat. I slowly slid to the floor and laid down. As I gasped for breath and my vision darkened, all I could think was, he’s cheating.



Chapter 4

Isha



I looked at myself in the mirror, my black skinny jeans were like a second skin on my hips, a\*s and thighs. They looked painted on. The red halter shirt with the teardrop cut out showed my cleavage. I had a pair of high-heeled red leather boots to complete the outfit. For a while, I debated about leaving my hair down, it was straight and ended in the middle of my back, but if we were dancing I might get hot, so maybe I should put it up in a bun. If I put it up in a bun, my whole back would be exposed, and the tattoos of the zodiac constellations that represented my father and grandfather could be seen. There was a crescent moon with two wavy lines between my shoulder blades for my father. He was an Aquarius and above that was another small crescent moon with what looked like a Roman numeral for two with lines above and below that was an Aries sign for my grandfather. Jason hated them. He said tattoos are trashy. But when I told him what they meant to me, he was remorseful and apologized for his rude comment. At the time, being in love, I let it slide. So, with that thought in mind, I put my hair up in a bun, and brought some hair down in the front to frame my face. I curled those pieces and then did my makeup. I went flirty and fun tonight, with a light pink frosted eye shadow and over that some pink glitter. I used pink lip gloss that left a slight color on my lips, and I was ready. I put my ID and some cash in my back pocket. Just enough for dinner and a couple of drinks at the club, then I picked up my phone, contemplating if I should take it. I shrugged and stuck it in my other pocket.



Just as I started down the stairs, the front door opened and Jason walked in. I was surprised to see him. He stood at the open door and stared at me.



“You look f\*ck ing hot,” he blurted.



I smiled because I felt hot, but getting this reaction from my husband, who hadn’t looked at me in months, gave me a boost of confidence.



“Thank you.”



“Why are you dressed like that? I thought you were just having dinner and going dancing. Can’t you dress more conservatively like a married woman should dress?”



Was he f\*cking serious?



“No, this is what people wear clubbing, sometimes even less, you should see the dress that Savvy is going out in tonight. It’s going to drive Mac and Jack nuts.”



“Maybe you shouldn’t hang out with someone that’s encouraging you to look like that.”



‘“Like what Jason? Beautiful? S\*xy? Maybe I want to look like this. Maybe I need this, because the man I’m married to would rather put his hands on a woman that isn’t me.”



“What? What are you talking about? I’ve never touched another woman since marrying you,” he said, looking astonished.



“Oh? My bad, I guess it was just someone else that looked exactly like you that had his arms around a beautiful blonde today and kissed her on the forehead? Have a secret identical twin I don’t know about?”



His mouth dropped open, “Isha, I don’t know what you’re talking about. I had a meeting with a client today.”



“Mmhmm, maybe it was just my imagination then.”



“Is this because we haven’t been intimate in a few months? I’m sorry, I‘ve been really busy, and I know I just picked up another client that will keep me even busier. I’m just exhausted. I come home to relax, and I fall asleep on you. I swear it’s nothing else.”



“Whatever, excuse me, I’m going to be late. I need to drive to Savvy’s. We’re taking an Uber from her place, in case we drink too much tonight. Wouldn’t want to get in an accident, you know,” I said, c\*cking my head, waiting for him to move.



“Isha, what is going on with you?”



“Nothing, Jason, I just think I’ve been a little blind these last six months. Now, if you can kindly move, I wouldn't want my fat body to disgust you.” Okay, maybe that’s not what Madilyn said earlier, but it was implied and if Jason’s been having an affair with her, looking at her and me together it’s obvious, her words hit harder than I thought.



“What?” he said, shocked.



I just sighed, grabbed my keys from the table beside the door and skirted around him. He just watched me walk away, get in my car and drive off. I looked at him in the rearview mirror, he really looked shell-shocked. Why was he pretending? I know what I saw.



I pulled up to Savvy, Mac’s and Jack’s home. It was beautiful. It was in the middle of acres of land. They had a huge whitewashed barn that I remember Savvy saying housed their horses. There was a milking barn close to that for their cows and goats.



There was an elegant-looking chicken mansion, because really, that was a f\*cking mansion for chickens. It was pretty, and I never thought I’d say that about a chicken coop. There were two golden retriever dogs sleeping at the bottom of the wrap-around porch stairs. Their home was a two-story white and light blue farmhouse. There was a white rock walkway leading up to the front door. Before I could knock, it opened and Jack was gathering me into his big strong arms.



“Isha, it’s so good to see you,” he said with a warm hug. I squeezed him back because I really needed it.



“My turn,” Mac said as he took me from Jack and hugged me.



Then I felt two little bodies slam into my legs.



“Hi Isha,” Willow chimed.



“Issaaa,” Axel squealed.



Mac let me go and I crouched down. “Hi little ones.”



“You so pweety,” Axel said, rubbing the satin fabric of my shirt. “Pwetty in wed.”



“You’re right son, she is pretty in red,” Savvy said, as she came out in her dress that had my smile widening.



“You look smokin’,” I said.



“Not as smokin’ as you. Jesus, you’re going to set some hearts on fire tonight,” she said, grabbing me and hugging me.



“Isha, why come you look so pretty?” Willow asked.



“Because, babes, sometimes a girl needs to look her best,” I told her. She nodded like she knew what I was talking about.



“You do look gorgeous, Isha. You and my Princess better not talk to any men tonight. You may not be my wife, but I’ll still spank your a\*s for being naughty,” Jack said.



Savvy giggled as my face bloomed.



“Jack, stop teasing her, you’re going to make her cream her panties.”



“Oh God, jokes on you, I’m not wearing any,” we all laughed.



“How are you keeping those girls looking so perky?” Savvy asked.



“I have these cutlet like sticky b\*ob things. As long as you have a tight shirt on, you stick them to your b\*ob, lift, and they just stay.”



“Let me see,” Savvy said.



I looked at Jack and Mac. They were beaming at us, and looking like they wanted to see too.



""Um, maybe not in front of your husbands and children?”



She laughed, “Okay, maybe later than. You can show Erica, me and Louise at the restaurant or club. Okay, let’s go, the Uber is here.”



We got into the Uber, and she turned to me.



“You do look hot,” she said.



“Thank you. That’s exactly what Jason said when he came home for some reason, before I left.”



“Oh, he came home early. You could have canceled if you wanted to spend time with him.”



“No, I am pretty sure he didn’t come home early to spend time with me. I think he was hoping I was already gone.”



“Isha,” she said.



“I think he’s really cheating Savvy. When you left today, I was putting my bags in the car and I looked up and two blocks down I saw him coming out of a restaurant with Madilyn Montgomery. She was in his arms, they were smiling at each other, and then he leaned in and kissed her on the forehead. I called him, and do you know what he said?”

1ls2rkl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ls2rkl,"Thinking of building a smart coffee scale , would love your feedback! (renders are a bit far from the actual product)","Hey r/IndiaCoffee ,

Over the past few months, I’ve been diving deeper into home brewing and quickly realized how much of a difference timing, temperature, and ratio make in the final cup. I started searching for a smart scale that could help me track everything seamlessly… but honestly, I couldn’t find anything that hit the sweet spot between functionality and price. Is this what all of you guys have faced too?

Most of what I found was either *too expensive* ( Acaia 😅), or laggy, glitchy, and just plain frustrating to use. Taring issues, delayed weight updates , not exactly what you want mid-pour.

As an engineer (and a frustrated coffee enthusiast), I’ve been toying with the idea of developing a **smart, minimalist coffee scale** designed for people like us , especially for beginners who’d benefit from some guided help.

Here’s what I’m envisioning:

* **Live Temperature Tracking** (yes, while brewing)
* **Real-Time Weight Accuracy** (no lag, no freeze-ups)
* **BREU Assist** – a built-in, step-by-step brewing assistant with auto taring. (The scale will smartly detect which step of brewing you are on and then after you are done measuring, it auto tares. )
* **Multiple Recipe Storage** using an app**.**
* **A clean, info-rich LCD interface** (minimalist but powerful)
* **Multiple profiles** for aeropress,french press, espresso, pourover.
* Also, it can act as a **normal weighing scale whenever u want** in a single click.  

The goal is a **purpose-driven, frustration-free scale** — something sleek, smart, and beginner-friendly without compromising on quality.

What do you think?  
Would a scale like this be useful to you?  
What features do you wish your current scale had (or didn't have)?  
Anything that would make this a no-brainer addition to your brew bar?

I’d really appreciate your thoughts before diving deeper into prototyping! Also anyone who wants to seed fund this can DM.

1ls2r7n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ls2r7n/does_this_count_as_an_emotional_affair_is_it/,"Does this count as an emotional affair? Is it right for me to despise this man for what he did to me? Men, would you do this to your partner? Women, would you accept it?","(Please be kind if you decide to read through this and respond. I really am suffering from this situation I put myself in and do not need someone to tell me I am gullible, naive, or old fashioned. I know that already… It is a bit of a long read too, so thank you if you make it all the way to the end! I also included a TLDR, if not.) 

I met a man over a year ago at a work event we had both travelled to from our respective countries. After a very intense and emotionally-loaded initial conversation (during which I felt like the room emptied out and we were the only ones left there talking), we both acknowledged how wonderful and rare it was to engage with a complete stranger on such a deep level, genuinely wondering if we knew each other from some past we could not remember. He messaged me that same evening asking if he could see me again and so we ended up meeting for a few hours (over a very anodyne  coffee and croissant) before we parted ways. 

During that second meeting, I felt so comfortable around him that I opened up to him about my personal situation (soon-to-be-divorced mother of a 7 year old son). However (and this is at the root of all the suffering to come), I did not ask him about his personal life. He didn’t volunteer any details either. He was not wearing a ring and only told me that he did not have any children, so I assumed he was single. I also did not probe any further because I was not even mildly interested in a relationship or fling (I was not yet divorced, he lived in a different country, and to be honest he wasn’t even physically my type). I was simply happy to have met someone like him, even if all that was to come out of our bond in the future was a pure platonic friendship. 

He hugged me tight that afternoon, looked me in the eyes and said “I have no words to describe this, but you know”, and messaged me again before traveling saying he couldn’t believe how lucky he was to have met someone like me. I felt the same way too and told him so. 

Two weeks later, he sent me a first message saying that something he wrote to a friend reminded him of me and that he wanted to share, even though he could not fully explain why. He said it felt deeply instinctive. He then sent me screenshots of conversations that captured painful memories from his past mixed with some nostalgic recollections of our home country (we are both of the same nationality and had left our war-torn country decades ago). His message awakened some parts in me that I had long kept dormant so I ended up writing an even longer message back. I think he was not expecting me to reply the way I did, told me that it made him incredibly happy to receive my message, and with that kicked off what was to become a 6-months-long epistolary relationship that saw us writing long letter-like messages to each other every two to three days. It was beautiful. It was intense. It was like nothing I had ever experienced before. I ended up falling in love with the uniqueness of our relationship. I ended up falling in love with the density of the writing space we created. And somewhere along the way, I’m afraid I ended up falling in love with him too. 

Now I need to clarify here that none of those messages were sexual or flirtatious in nature, but they were heavily emotional and sometimes quite intimate too (drawing on our shared past, our trauma, our hopes, and mostly trying to help each other make it through some very rough patches in our lives). Our letters felt like snapshots of our present and past, but never a full chronological story. Never an account of our days. Never an answer to “how are you” or “what are you up to”. Never mundane. There were no questions asked. No sequence. No reason. No judgement. It was simply me writing whatever came to my mind, and him reciprocating with the same. Almost like an open diary. 

Through his writing, I came to know the names of some of his dearest friends, how fond he was of children, where and how he traveled, the books he was reading, the passages that moved him, how he handled (or could not handle) the death of his parents, his sensitivity to violence, and so much more… but never, ever, anything about his personal love life. 

I also (very stupidly) did not ask. 

I didn’t ask about his love life because it felt petty (given the nature of the things we were discussing), but I also genuinely suspected that he would take my question (are you married/ do you have a girlfriend?) as an offense, to which (I was almost sure) he would reply “How can I be married and write to you the way I do!?” 

I asked him a few times (indirectly) if someone in his life would be bothered by the intensity of our conversations or if I was being “too much” in the ways I wrote to him but every time he would only reply by saying that I should write the way I felt like writing and that my messages and our space made him incredibly happy and helped him power through his days. 

As our bond grew stronger, he started mentioning how I had become “essential” in his life, how the world would be very ugly without my existence, how he wanted our bond to “flow through everything”, and to become part of the real world (not just the virtual one). He also constantly told me that he admired me, that I impressed him so much, and that it was so rare for him to experience a relationship like ours that it often scared him, that he could not “name it”, and that it felt “unfair”. 

This carried on for months, until one night, I just could not take “not knowing” anymore. I just had to find out what his personal real life looked like. So I asked him the question (almost) directly. 

(Some days, I wish I didn’t ask. I still have open wounds from his reply, from the blunt coldness of it all.) 

“I live with someone I am in love with”, his letter back started. “We are expecting a child together”.

Possibly foreseeing my reaction, he immediately went on to tell me that he would not change a single word or a single feeling in our conversations even if his girlfriend were to read them one day. Apparently, he had told her about us, about how we met, and about the “importance of our bond”. But he also added that he has not showed her our conversations (because the intimacy in there was as much his as it was mine). 

As you might imagine, I went into shock for weeks and could not even get myself to reply. I wrote, erased, and rewrote a letter back until I lost track of what I really wanted to say. When I finally did reply, it was to give him a piece of my mind, to tell him that what he did was so unfair, and that even if I never asked him about his personal situation, he should have at least mentioned his girlfriend in some way, in any way, in his letters. He told me things about so many people in his life but he could not have at least once mentioned the most important one, the mother of his future child? There was no excuse for that. That was the end of our story. I was done. 

He immediately sent a huge letter apologizing and admitting that he was indeed very maladroit but still insisting he never meant to intentionally keep any information away from me, that he just did not think I would be interested in his love life. He insisted that his intentions were pure and different from what I had imagined them to be (although he did find me “immensely beautiful”, he said, and did wonder a few times who we would have been in a different world or if we had met in a different time). He then begged me to stay and to go on nurturing and growing our bond. He said it would be so sad for us to lose something so powerful and so unique… 

As horrible and naive as this might sound, somewhere deep down inside me, I do agree with him on that last point. He would have made such a wonderful and special friend. Almost on a soulmate-like level. If only I had the right information and truth from the start. If only he did not withhold his reality from me. If only I did not allow my imagination to run so wild, my limerence to grow such long legs. 

But despite all this, I still cannot get myself to forgive him and I don’t know if I should. He said his girlfriend is okay with our relationship and that he wants to introduce her to me, but if I were his girlfriend, I would be so heartbroken to see the messages between us. Also, I still have deep feelings for him, so it would be very unfair and disrespectful to her for me to go on being friends with him. 

I don’t know what to do. I believe he engaged in an emotional affair and then backtracked when I told him off, even though he denies it. I really despise him for leading me on and withholding his relationship from me, but I also cannot bear the idea of him not staying in my life as a friend (even if it will be pure torture, at least initially).

I have nobody I can talk to about this, so any advice or impressions would be much appreciated. 


TLDR: I somehow found myself engaging in a 6-months-long intense letter-writing (remote, largely platonic, yet heavily emotional and intimate) relationship with a man I met a couple of times and felt an incredibly strong bond with. All throughout these 6 months, I opened up to him about my personal situation but he never told me he was with someone (and expecting a child!!) until I finally asked him directly (6 months later) but it was already too late. I had fallen very deeply in love with him and had become addicted to our epistolary relationship. We have such a unique bond and while he admits he was maladroit in not mentioning his girlfriend to me and allowing my feelings to grow, he is insisting that he never had any romantic intentions and keeps begging me not to leave his life (suggesting he even introduces me to her) so that we can normalize it all. I am considering trying to get over him but I also feel it would be very painful and unfair to everyone involved (and disrespectful to his girlfriend), as much as I do want him to stay in my life. I am lost and confused and do not know if I should just stop talking to him (and hate him for what he did) or if I should somehow try to turn this into a platonic friendship and enjoy his presence in my life again.

1ls2r25,https://i.redd.it/0zvhbdfcvzaf1.png,The Secret Heiress Loved by Four,"I sat and ate my dinner, reflecting on my marriage. Jason swept me off of my feet. We had a whirlwind romance a year and a half ago. We met at the coffee shop that I worked at part-time. He came in every morning and every afternoon for a black coffee and a pan-seared blueberry muffin for years. He ate and then went to wherever he worked. Most of our conversations were, hi and how are you, but that was about it.



One day he came in looking a little stressed. I asked if everything was okay. He had been coming there long enough that we were on a first-name basis. He told me he had a big client that he had to meet, but he didn’t have a date, and the meeting was in three hours. So, I volunteered. I only had an hour left until my shift ended. I gave him my phone number and address and told him I’d be ready.



Since I knew it was a business meeting, I didn’t go all out. I picked a below-the-knee-length black dress that stretched across my size fourteen body. It had thick straps and I had a little red half jacket that went with the dress. I was big-chested with a size D and the jacket helped hide the cleavage that the dress emphasized. I put on black heels to help my 5’3” stature get to 5’8”, and put up my long black hair in a ringlet bun with some hair coming down from the temples to frame my face. I kept my makeup with neutral tones to compliment my rounded face and light brown almond-shaped eyes, but wore a bold, dark red wine lip stain.



When Jason picked me up, his eyes admired me in the dress, and he told me I looked beautiful. When we got to the restaurant, he introduced me to his client. An older gentleman who was looking for office space. That’s when I realized Jason was a real estate agent. Conversation flowed. I had charmed the older man, and he signed with Jason. When his client left, Jason was excited and he thanked me. After that, he called me for every client meeting. Then we progressed from there into real friendship and then became romantically involved. That all happened in three months. He asked me to marry him. I said yes and we eloped.



My mother and Nana were all I had. My father died when I was fifteen, and he was forty in a car accident with my grandfather. Our family was devastated.



My mom and Nana live in Las Vegas, and I was in Yearling, Colorado living my so-called independent life. The pressure my Nana was putting on me when I was eighteen to get married and start a family right away, made me beg my mother to let me have five years to myself. So when I turned twenty, and graduated with my associates in business, I was granted those five years. I was twenty-three when I married Jason. They hated him. My mom and Nana wanted a grand wedding. Jason said he didn’t want to wait. They had only met over face time, because Jason was too busy to travel and mom said traveling wasn’t good for my Nana’s health. They were very mad that we eloped. I felt guilty at the time, but I was in love.



For the last year everything was grand. I was happy, I had a loving husband who spoiled me in and out of bed. He wanted me to quit the café because, in his words, he could provide for his wife with anything I needed. So, again, being in love, I agreed. But in the last six months he’s become distant. He blamed it on this new client of his. A tech billionaire that wanted twenty acres in Yearling, Colorado population seven thousand. Our town was picturesque. The buildings were big and old with lots of charm. The stores from the grocery store, hardware store, and clothing were all owned by people around town. Same with our local mechanics. The town wasn’t corrupted by big box stores or franchises. We didn’t have fast food in our town. We had family-owned restaurants, bakeries and cafés.



So it was big news that a billionaire was settling here. Jason, being one of three real estate agents in town, was fighting hard to get this person as a client. I, unfortunately, was not invited to meet this billionaire. He said he didn’t need me to help close this deal. So he went to dinner meetings by himself over the months. He had texted me earlier today to boast that he had signed the billionaire, but I was not invited to the celebratory dinner and to not wait up for him.



So, here I was eating dinner alone. I was hurt, his distance was tearing me apart inside. It wasn’t just not being invited to the dinners or his late nights at work, but it was also the constant texts at all hours of the day on his days off. He hadn’t even taken me out on a date in the last six months. Not since our first anniversary as a married couple. The next day, he met with the billionaire and that was the first night he came home late. Over the next couple of months, I felt ignored and neglected. Right before our anniversary, he said he wanted to start a family, and I was excited. We made love constantly but it didn’t happen. I was disappointed when I got my periods. I tried to initiate s\*x the other night, but he rebuffed me, telling me he was exhausted. I tried to be sympathetic because he had been working so hard pulling twelve to sixteen-hour shifts. I just didn’t know what to do anymore.



I sighed, picking up my plate and washing it. I looked at my phone. No texts or calls since he told me he signed his big client. It was only eight, but he told me that three hours ago. Were they still celebrating?



I decided to take a shower and climbed into bed with my laptop when I was done. Unbeknownst to Jason, I had been writing spicy stories for a website that paid authors for their imagination. I had been bored one evening reading on my phone and the website I had been reading on had an ad that said they were looking for authors with an exciting imagination. I wrote a lot of short stories in high school. I took a creative writing course online when I was twenty and twenty-one. So I took a chance and it paid off. I am now an exclusive writer for the site and have been for the last four months. I wanted to tell Jason about it, but I hardly ever saw him, and being a little pissed about how he'd been treating me, I decided to keep it to myself. I opened my own bank account under my mother's name at her insistence. Her reasoning was that a girl should have her own money. I had rolled my eyes at her at the time. But I did as she insisted. In the last four months, I’ve made quite a little nest egg.



I heard the front door shut, and I looked at the time on my laptop. I had been writing for four hours. The time got away from me. I shut my laptop down and set it aside just as Jason walked through our bedroom door.



“Hey, I told you not to wait up,” he slurred.



My brows furrowed.



“Did you drive home drunk?”



“No, I got dropped off by Mr. Montgomery’s driver, left my car at the office. Mr. Montgomery insisted on it.”



“Okay. Well, congratulations,” I said.



“Thanks babe, I’m going to jump in the shower,” he said as he stripped, and left his clothes on the floor, and walked into the bathroom stark naked. I sighed when I heard the water turn on. The d\*mn hamper was in the bathroom. Why didn’t he take his suit in there?



I got out of bed and picked up his suit. I went through his jacket pockets and took out his wallet, car keys and phone and set them on our dresser. I fished through his pants pocket and felt a weird material in his left one. I took it out and inhaled sharply. I dropped the item to the floor. Lying there, at my feet, was a pair of red lacy underwear. Those were definitely not mine. Why would he have some woman's underwear in his pocket? My body started to sweat, and I felt nausea roll through me. No, no way has Jason cheated on me. I dropped his jacket and pants and sprinted out of our room to the hall bathroom. I luckily made it to the toilet and threw up my dinner.



My mind was reeling. There was no way my loving husband had cheated on me. But thinking about the distance the last six months, something in my mind said it could be possible. I stood to my feet. I rinsed my mouth out with water and washed my hands. I found some mouthwash under the sink and I swished the burning liquid around my mouth. Tears sprang to my eyes. I blamed it on the mouthwash.



I went back into the room and Jason was standing there with his suit in his hand, staring at the panties on the floor. When I stepped in, his eyes shot to mine.



“Don’t freak out, it’s not what you think,” he said.



“So you haven’t been having an affair?”



“God, no baby,” he said, dropping his suit on the bed.



He came towards me, hands outstretched to cup my face, but I dodged him and scooted by him to the other side of the bed, putting it between us.



He sighed and dropped his hands to his side.



“Look, Mr. Montgomery is an old-fashioned man. I’ve been taking him to Denver to eat in fancy restaurants, and sometimes we end up at a strip club or two. That’s where I was tonight. Those must be from a stripper. I don’t know how they got into my pocket.”



“So, you took your billionaire client to a strip club, and have been while you schmoozed him. That’s why I was never invited out with you? I’ve helped you schmooze other clients before, Jason?”



“Yeah, I know honey, but Mr. Montgomery is single, he’s older, and I was trying to be a man’s man. And to do that, I needed to cater to his needs. That’s how I landed him.”



I nodded, it seemed plausible. I stared at him looking for a lie, but I just couldn’t see it. He looked remorseful.



“Baby, I would never cheat on you. I love you. Please believe me. I’m sorry for keeping this from you. You are my life. It won’t happen again, I promise.”



“Okay,” I whispered. He visibly relaxed. He ran his hand through his hair. I climbed back into bed. “Please get rid of those panties.” I laid on my side, turning away from him. My heart still ached, but I believed him. I hope I wasn’t being naive and st\*pid.



Chapter 2

Isha



“There’s an awards ceremony in Denver. Tomorrow night. It’s for Realtor of the Year in the state of Colorado,” Jason said. We were sitting at the breakfast table.



Since we had woken up, he’s been keeping up a running commentary. I’ve been silent. He tried to make love to me in the middle of the night when he finally came to bed. I told him I was on my period, so he asked if I’d blow him. I said no. Then he whined about needing a release. So I gave him a hand job, and the whole time he was moaning in ecstasy and telling me how good it felt. All I could think of was that he was thinking about the stripper with the red lacy underwear. I squeezed him hard then, and he groaned loudly and jacked his hips until he exploded. He praised me for the best hand job ever. I got up and washed my hands, then went back to bed where he was passed out.



“Am I invited to it?” I asked.



He sighed loudly, “Isha, yes, you're my wife.”



“Just wondering, didn’t know if you needed to keep up appearances of being single and a man’s man.”



He groaned loudly this time.



“Isha. I apologized last night. Can you please forgive me?”



“Yeah, fine. What’s the dress code?”



“Fancy cocktail.”



“What time?”



“We have to be there at six.”



“Okay, are you going to be late tonight? Should I bother making dinner?”



“I’ll be here baby. No more late nights, I got the client what he needed.”



I nodded, hoping this was true.



He got up and leaned over to kiss me. I turned my face and his lips brushed my cheek.



“We’ll get us back,” he whispered.



He then left, and I let out a pent-up breath. My phone rang five minutes later.



“Nana, hello.”



“Hello my sweet girl. How are you today?”



“I am fine.”



“You don’t sound fine,” she said.



“I am Nana. How are you and mom doing?”



“We are good. Your mother is taking me to Arizona Charlie’s for breakfast. Then we are going to Bingo all day long.”



I smiled, my mom and Nana loved bingo. They were addicted, which I don’t blame them for. They won more than lost. It was a great pastime for them. Since the deaths of my dad and grandfather, they’ve glommed on to each other. I was grateful that my mom and Nana got along. Nana was my dad’s mom. She was seventy years old, still spry for her age. She was tall at 5’9. She was a model when she was younger. Her red hair was now gray, but she still had bright blue eyes. She was Irish like my grandfather. When they met my mother, they were enamored by her exotic beauty. My mom was full Filipina, and my dad fell instantly in love with her. She applied to be his secretary and was hired because of her looks alone. My dad took one look at her, and despite her lack of working experience, because of her young age, he hired her on the spot. My mom had great organizational skills and typed a hundred and twenty words a minute. She helped my father build his law firm to the success it was today. When he died, his best friend Mark Jensen took the firm over. I secretly think she and my uncle Mark have feelings for each other. She still works there and is the head admin. She is Uncle Mark’s personal assistant too. I’ve tried to encourage her to give him signals that she’s interested, but she just scoffs and blushes at me over face time.



“We are just friends,” she’d say to me. I once said friends with benefits, and I got scolded for twenty minutes. A pissed-off Filipina mother is scary.



“Bingo sounds fun. I wish I could be there.”



“We do too. You should come for a visit. Maybe bring that husband of yours, and we could finally meet him face to face.”



“Maybe he did just bag his biggest client, he should get a great commission from it. We could use a vacation,” I said. Maybe rekindle our love.



“Oh, that would be wonderful. Well, your mother is yelling at me to hurry. I love you sweet girl.”



“I love you too, Nana. You and mom have fun.”



I opened the freezer after getting off of the phone and pulled out two steaks. I decided to make twice-baked potatoes to go with it. I figured I could get it ready and put it in the fridge to pop in the oven when it was close for Jason to come home.



After prepping dinner, I went to the gym. I was still a size fourteen. No matter what I did, my curves never changed. I wasn’t complaining though. I was big br\*asted, had wide hips and a high-rounded butt. I got my curves from Nana’s side. Her mother and sisters were like me. She was the only one that took after her dad. I wasn’t fat. My arms and legs were toned, my stomach wasn’t flabby, but it wasn’t completely skinny and flat either. I thought I was cute, my confidence was positive, although after last night, I felt I needed a boost.



I warmed up on the treadmill for ten minutes and then went to a squat bar. I was in the middle of squats when I saw that Brad, the gym manager, was drooling over the statuesque blonde he was showing the gym to. She was beautiful, her honey-blonde hair was in a high ponytail, she had a very small waist, and she was perky all over. Her legs were long, and she looked to be just an inch or two shorter than Brad's six feet. They were coming my way, so I put the bar in place. I bent to grab my towel from a bench and wiped my face and hands.



“Isha, this is Madilyn Montgomery. She just moved to town. Her father is that billionaire tech.”



“Oh, hello, I’m Isha Baxter, Jason’s wife. He is your father’s real estate agent.”



“Oh, yes, I know Jason. I met him at some of the dinners I went to with my father.”



I felt my smile dim a little. “Oh, that’s nice. So are you looking to join the gym? No better one than Brad’s place. There’s even a pool, hot tub and sauna in the lower level,” I said. Brad beamed at me with appreciation.



“Yes, daddy’s gym won’t be ready for use for a while, so I need a place to stay in shape. Don’t want to get fat, my boyfriend wouldn’t like that,” she said, eyeing me up and down.



Brad furrowed his brow and took a step away from her.



“Well, if you choose my gym, we have no judgments here. We encourage, not discourage,” Brad said.



“Oh, I wasn’t discouraging anyone. Just saying my boyfriend likes me skinny. Well it was nice to meet you Isha, was it?”



I nodded. “Welcome to Yearling.”



She gave me a practice perfect smile. Her presence made me feel uneasy. But before I could get too much in my head, a friend called out to me.



“Yoohoo, Isha.”



I looked over at the gorgeous woman that called out to me.



“Savvy!”



Savvy was a woman I met three years ago on my twenty-first birthday. She was five years older than me, but you wouldn’t know it. We looked like sisters. We both had black hair and light brown eyes. We were both light-skinned with our half-white heritage, but she was half Spanish, and I was half Filipina. Her eyes were more rounded than my almond-shaped ones, and her face was thinner. Well, she was thinner all over. She had the cutest four and three-year-olds, and her two husbands, Jack and Mac, were Adonis'. They were former firefighters, but now they live on some land on the outskirts of Yearling and have their own homestead.



Savvy had come into the café on my birthday, and I was wearing a birthday sash. She tipped me a hundred dollars and told me happy birthday. She took her two kids, who were fifteen months and a newborn at the time, and went to sit down. When I brought her her order, her little girl was breastfeeding, and her baby boy was fussing. I sat her order down and asked if I could help.



She let me take little Axel out of his carrier and I rocked him while Willow fed on Savvy. She had thanked me fiercely and told me her husbands were just down the street picking up animal feed. She threw me for a loop with that statement. Then she told me her life story and how she and her husbands met.



“And they’re together also?” I had asked, fascinated.



She nodded and smiled. Then they walked in, and I gasped, and she let out the loudest laugh. Mac and Jack looked at her and smiled. I fell half in love with them. She teased me mercilessly. Jack and Mac were huge flirts and had me blushing the whole time. Savvy didn’t mind in the slightest.



Every time I would take an order to a table, and we got a lull with the crowd, I would sit with them, hold their kids and we would talk. I told them about my life story and then said that I hoped to find a love as strong as theirs. They all said that one day I would. Then I met Jason a year and a half later, and I thought I had. Now, I wasn't so sure.



“How are the kids, Mac and Jack? I haven’t seen you guys in a while.”



“Everyone is doing great. Willow is getting so big and bossy. She tells Axel what to do all the time, and he just nods and goes along with it.”



I chuckled. “I miss seeing those two.”



“How’s Jason?”



I lost my smile and her eyes got big.



“How about we go to the café? I can skip my workout today.”



“Let me take a quick shower, and I’ll meet you over there?”



She nodded and left. She was a good friend and I needed someone to talk to.



Chapter 3

Isha



I walked into the café where I used to work. I waved at Kevin, who was my old boss and the owner of the café. I saw Savvy already had our drinks and I walked over to her. I dropped my bag on the ground and sat across from her. She handed me my cup.



“Spill. I texted Jack to let him know that I was with you so he wouldn’t freak out when I wasn’t home in an hour. He and Mac get worried if I take a minute too long without texting one of them. It took me forever to get them to stop following me everywhere.”



I laughed, “They love you.”



“Yeah they do. Now talk. I can see something is wrong.”



“Well, maybe you can give me some advice. Since I know your history.”



She got a sympathetic look in her eye and I sighed.



“I think Jason is cheating on me. Now I don’t really have any real proof. It’s not like when you caught your husband kissing another woman and then later saw video evidence. But it is kind of like the neglect Brian put you through.”



“He’s helping a female neighbor too much? Getting attached?”



“No. He works late, staying out until midnight or later. There’s a lot of texting going on during his days off. He claims it was because of this big billionaire tech guy he was trying to land who wanted twenty acres of land. He hasn’t touched me in months. And then yesterday he texted me that he had finally got the billionaire to sign his land and housing contract, and to not wait up. I used to go to all his dinner meetings to help him schmooze the clients, and then when they signed I would celebrate with them. But last night he came home real late. He stripped and took a shower. I picked up his suit and found red lacy panties in a pocket. I had a reaction and ran to the hall bathroom to puke. When I came back, he was staring at the panties. He said it wasn’t what I thought and explained that this billionaire guy was a quote, “man’s man,” end quote, whatever that is supposed to mean. He took him to a strip club in Denver and a dancer must have shoved her panties in his pocket. It’s a plausible excuse, don’t you think?” I asked her desperately.



“It is. But what was his excuse for not bringing you to the dinners?” Savvy asked.



“Basically the same thing, that the billionaire was old-fashioned, and it wasn’t the first time they had ended up in a club. But this morning I met Mr. Montgomery’s daughter. That’s the billionaire, and she let me know that she knew my husband. They had met at client dinners.”



“Oh,” she said, shocked.



“Yeah, oh.” I said dejectedly. “She’s gorgeous, Savvy. Blonde, tall and slim. Everything is perky from her b-cup br\*asts to her pert little a\*s.”



“Hey, you’re gorgeous. Your body is to die for. Mac made a comment once that you had a nice a\*s. I agree with him. You do have a delicious a\*s Isha.”



I blushed. “Thank you.”



“Look, I’ll admit him not wanting s\*x for months and some of the other things do sound sus, but that man loves you. I’ve seen the way he looks at you.”



“Yeah, I would have thought that too. But he hasn’t looked at me in like six months. He says he’s exhausted. Okay fine, that could be an excuse for why there hasn’t been any s\*x. But Savvy, he doesn’t look at me. I think this morning was the first time he had in a long time because he knew he f\*cked up.”



“How about this? Mac and Jack can take the kids tonight. You and I can have a girls' night out. We’ll take an Uber to Denver, we’ll drink and dance. I’ll invite Louise and Erica. That way, Mac and Jack won’t have a conniption that we’re alone in the big bad city. And with the size of six foot Erica and all her two hundred pounds of pure muscle, that will ease their minds too,” she said, rolling her eyes.



I giggled. That sounded like fun. I hadn’t been out in ages and I loved Erica and Louise. They were married and owned Lou’s flower and bookshop called Sensation. Erica was a competitive bodybuilder. They were good people.



“I’d like that. What time?”



“How about seven o'clock, meet at my place? We can eat at a restaurant and then go clubbing?”



“Sounds great.” We chatted for a little while longer. She wanted to go shopping for a new outfit and I said I’d accompany her.



We had a blast trying on clothes. I settled on a really cute red halter shirt with a teardrop cutout that showed the girls well, and a pair of black tight skinny jeans. I had some boots that would go well with the outfit at home. Savvy got a pink mini-strapless dress that she said would drive Mac and Jack wild knowing what she was wearing at the club.



I said goodbye to her two hours later. It had been forever since I had so much fun shopping with a girlfriend.

Woke up early today to catch the sunrise at one of Sydney’s beautiful beaches 🌊 — the kind of morning where the sky blushes before the sun even peeks out.

Took a slow walk along the shore, bare feet in the sand, coffee in hand, watching the tide roll in and out like it's whispering secrets from the sea. 🐚 The water was calm, the breeze just right, and there were a few early risers doing their own morning rituals — surfing, jogging, or just sitting and watching.

Days like this make me think: there’s something magical about Sydney mornings. And honestly… wouldn’t mind sharing these kinds of walks with someone.

So here's a little tide video I captured this morning — peaceful, real, and a reminder to slow down and enjoy life.

1ls2p8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1ls2p8h/reckoning_with_zionism_a_jewish_critique/,Reckoning with Zionism: A Jewish Critique,"The catastrophes of the twentieth century carved themselves into Jewish memory with brutal permanence. The systematic extermination of six million Jews, the complicity of neighbors, the silence of nations—these traumas live not as distant history but as inherited wound. My own grandmother spoke of hiding in Polish forests, of cousins who simply vanished. For her generation, and for many who came after, the establishment of Israel represented not just a political achievement but a bulwark against oblivion.

Yet moral consistency demands that we confront an uncomfortable truth: the very people who gifted us our deepest understanding of displacement and dispossession have, in the name of security, created new refugees. The question that haunts me—and should haunt any Jew committed to ethical reasoning—is whether our legitimate need for safety can justify the permanent denial of dignity and sovereignty to Palestinians who have lived on this land for centuries.

This is not a question I pose lightly, nor one I approach from outside the Jewish experience. I write as someone whose family tree bears the scars of European antisemitism, whose Hebrew school education was steeped in the narrative of Jewish return. But I also write as someone who has spent years studying the archival record, interviewing Palestinian families, and grappling with the testimonies of Israeli historians who have documented what actually happened in 1948 and beyond.

# The Mythology of Historical Entitlement

The cornerstone of Zionist ideology rests on the claim that Jews possess an exclusive right to the land of Israel based on ancient habitation. This argument, while emotionally compelling, crumbles under scrutiny. Historical presence does not automatically confer modern political rights—if it did, the entire global order would collapse into chaos.

Consider the implications of this logic applied universally. The Lakota Nation could rightfully demand the return of the Black Hills, seized by the United States in violation of the 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty. Turkey would be obligated to cede Istanbul to Greece, given the city's Byzantine heritage. The Maori could claim sovereignty over all of New Zealand based on their status as tangata whenua. While these claims contain moral weight, few would argue they justify the mass displacement of current inhabitants.

The archaeological record confirms Jewish presence in ancient Palestine, just as it confirms Canaanite, Philistine, and numerous other civilizations. But Palestinians are not foreign interlopers—they are the descendants of the land's many inhabitants, including Jews who converted to Christianity and Islam over the centuries. The Israeli historian Shlomo Sand has documented how Jewish populations throughout history were largely composed of converts rather than descendants of the original Judeans. DNA studies by researchers like Ariella Oppenheim have shown that Palestinians and Jews share significant genetic overlap, suggesting common ancestry rather than competing claims.

What makes the Zionist historical argument particularly problematic is its selectivity. It emphasizes Jewish connection while erasing Palestinian rootedness. When Jewish settlers arrived in Palestine in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, they found not empty land but a society with established villages, agricultural systems, and cultural institutions. The Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi has documented 418 Palestinian villages that were depopulated during the 1948 war, many of which had existed for centuries. In Lifta, just outside Jerusalem, you can still see the stone houses and terraced gardens of families who were forced to flee in 1948—their keys still passed down through generations in refugee camps.

# The Nakba: Dispossession as State Policy

The events of 1948 represent the foundational moment when Zionist ideology translated into concrete dispossession. The standard Israeli narrative portrays the flight of Palestinians as voluntary—a temporary evacuation that became permanent due to Arab intransigence. This account has been thoroughly demolished by Israeli historians themselves.

Benny Morris, despite his own evolving political views, documented in ""The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem"" how Israeli forces systematically expelled Palestinians through intimidation, direct orders, and massacres designed to spread terror. The massacre at Deir Yassin on April 9, 1948, where Irgun and Stern Gang militants killed over 100 Palestinian civilians, was not an aberration but part of a broader pattern. Morris identified at least 24 massacres committed by Israeli forces during the 1948 war.

Plan Dalet, the Israeli military's operational plan during the war, explicitly called for the destruction of Palestinian villages and the expulsion of their inhabitants. Israeli military historian Yoav Gelber confirmed that the plan ""provided for the conquest of Arab villages and towns and their occupation, destruction or transformation into Jewish settlements."" This was not the fog of war but deliberate policy.

The personal testimonies are devastating. Khalil Sakakini, a Palestinian intellectual, wrote in his diary on May 13, 1948: ""The Jewish Agency has decided to uproot us from our homes and drive us out of our country."" His family, like hundreds of thousands of others, became refugees overnight. Today, over 7 million Palestinian refugees remain registered with UNRWA, many living in camps within sight of their ancestral villages.

# The Illusion of Generous Offers

The narrative of Palestinian rejectionism relies heavily on the claim that Israel has repeatedly offered reasonable peace deals that Palestinians irrationally refused. This story requires careful examination of what these ""generous offers"" actually entailed.

The 2000 Camp David Summit, frequently cited as evidence of Palestinian intransigence, proposed a Palestinian state that would have been anything but sovereign. The Israeli offer would have left Palestinians with approximately 91% of the West Bank, but this territory would have been fragmented by settlement blocks, military roads, and security zones. As negotiator Robert Malley later revealed, the Palestinian areas would have resembled ""a Swiss cheese"" with no territorial contiguity.

More critically, the Israeli proposal granted Palestinians no real sovereignty. Israel would have retained control over Palestinian airspace, borders, and the Jordan Valley. The so-called Palestinian state would have been unable to sign treaties, control its own security, or even prevent Israeli military incursions. This was not an offer of statehood but of glorified autonomy.

The Clinton Parameters, presented in December 2000, were more detailed but still fell short of viable sovereignty. They would have required Palestinians to accept permanent Israeli control over parts of East Jerusalem, including Jewish settlements built in violation of international law. The right of return for Palestinian refugees would have been limited to symbolic numbers, effectively nullifying what Palestinians consider a fundamental right.

On the right of return specifically, the Israeli position has remained consistent across all negotiations: Palestinian refugees cannot return to their homes in what is now Israel. This represents perhaps the most fundamental disagreement in the conflict. While Israel passed the Law of Return in 1950, granting any Jew worldwide the right to Israeli citizenship, Palestinians who were born in the territory now controlled by Israel are denied that same right.

# The Siege of Gaza: Collective Punishment as Policy

Gaza provides perhaps the starkest example of how Israeli policy has created the conditions it claims to be responding to. The territory has been under Israeli blockade since 2007, with Egypt participating in the siege at Israel's behest. The blockade controls not just weapons but basic goods needed for civilian life.

The restrictions are Byzantine in their detail and devastating in their impact. Israel has at various times banned chocolate, pasta, tea, coffee, and even crayons from entering Gaza. The Israeli human rights organization Gisha documented how Israel calculated the minimum number of calories needed to keep Gaza's population from starving, then set import restrictions accordingly. This is not security policy but collective punishment.

The consequences are measurable. According to the UN, 97% of Gaza's water is unfit for human consumption. The territory receives electricity for only 12 hours per day. Unemployment hovers around 50%, with youth unemployment exceeding 70%. The UN estimated in 2020 that Gaza would be ""unlivable"" by 2020—a prediction that has proven accurate.

Against this backdrop, the rise of Hamas becomes comprehensible without being excusable. The organization gained power not through ideological fervor alone but by providing services that the Palestinian Authority could not deliver under occupation. Hamas runs hospitals, schools, and social services for a population abandoned by the international community.

This does not justify Hamas's military tactics, particularly its targeting of civilians. But it does explain them. When people are caged without hope, violence becomes predictable. The cycle is self-perpetuating: Israeli policies create desperation, desperate people support violent resistance, and violent resistance justifies further Israeli restrictions.

# The Settlement Enterprise: Permanent Occupation

Perhaps no aspect of Israeli policy reveals the true nature of the occupation more clearly than the settlement enterprise. Israeli settlements in the West Bank are categorically illegal under international law—the Fourth Geneva Convention explicitly prohibits an occupying power from transferring its civilian population into occupied territory.

Yet settlement construction has continued under every Israeli government since 1967. The numbers tell the story: In 1993, when the Oslo Accords were signed, approximately 110,000 Israeli settlers lived in the West Bank. Today, that number exceeds 450,000. This represents the largest population transfer in contemporary history, executed under the cover of a ""peace process.""

The settlements are not random outposts but part of a systematic plan to make Palestinian statehood impossible. The Israeli settlement monitoring organization Peace Now has documented how settlements are strategically placed to fragment Palestinian territory, control water resources, and create facts on the ground that would be impossible to reverse.

The settlement of Ariel, for example, cuts deep into the West Bank, creating a permanent barrier between the northern and southern parts of any potential Palestinian state. The Jordan Valley settlements create a security zone that would prevent a Palestinian state from having any border not controlled by Israel. This is not temporary occupation but permanent annexation by stealth.

The Israeli human rights organization B'Tselem has documented how the settlement enterprise creates a two-tiered legal system. Israeli settlers in the West Bank live under Israeli civil law, with full rights and protections. Palestinians in the same territory live under Israeli military law, with no political rights and limited legal protections. This is not temporary military occupation but permanent apartheid.

# Jewish Voices of Dissent: A Suppressed Tradition

The critique of Zionism is not external to Jewish discourse but part of a rich tradition of Jewish ethical thinking that has been marginalized and silenced. From the movement's earliest days, prominent Jewish thinkers raised concerns about the moral implications of Jewish statehood in Palestine.

Martin Buber, one of the 20th century's most influential Jewish philosophers, advocated for a binational state where Jews and Arabs would share political power. Writing in 1947, he warned that ""the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine would be a disaster for the Jewish people."" His concern was not antisemitic animus but moral clarity about the implications of Jewish supremacy.

Hannah Arendt, writing in 1948, predicted that a Jewish state would either become a Spartan garrison state or would require the permanent subjugation of its Arab population. Her essay ""To Save the Jewish Homeland"" warned that ""the trouble with lying and deceiving is that their efficiency depends entirely upon a clear notion of the truth that the liar and deceiver wishes to hide.""

Judah Magnes, the first president of Hebrew University, argued for a binational solution until his death in 1948. He wrote: ""We have not come to Palestine to do unto others what was done unto us."" His vision of Jewish return was based on equality, not supremacy.

These voices were not anti-Zionist from ignorance but from intimate knowledge of Jewish values and the Palestinian reality. They understood that Jewish liberation could not be built on Palestinian subjugation without corrupting the very values that made Jewish survival meaningful.

# The Apartheid Analysis: International Recognition

The comparison between Israel's treatment of Palestinians and South African apartheid is no longer confined to Palestinian advocacy groups or radical activists. It has been embraced by mainstream human rights organizations and former Israeli officials.

Human Rights Watch, in its 2021 report ""A Threshold Crossed,"" concluded that Israeli policies toward Palestinians constitute apartheid and persecution as crimes against humanity. The report documented how Israel maintains an institutional regime of systematic oppression and domination by one racial group over another.

Amnesty International reached similar conclusions in its 2022 report ""Israel's Apartheid Against Palestinians."" The organization documented how Israel enforces a system of domination through territorial fragmentation, segregation and control, dispossession of land and property, and denial of economic and social rights.

Perhaps most significantly, Israeli human rights organizations have adopted the apartheid framework. B'Tselem, Israel's most prominent human rights organization, published a position paper in 2021 titled ""A Regime of Jewish Supremacy from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea."" The organization concluded that ""the entire area controlled by Israel is organized under a single principle: advancing and perpetuating the supremacy of one group—Jews—over another—Palestinians.""

Even former Israeli officials have embraced this analysis. Ehud Barak, former Israeli Prime Minister, warned in 2016 that Israel was ""approaching apartheid"" and could become ""an apartheid state in one or two decades."" Michael Ben-Yair, former Israeli Attorney General, wrote in 2002 that Israel had ""established an apartheid regime in the occupied territories.""

# The Moral Imperative: Choosing Justice

The question facing Jews today is not whether Israel should exist—it does exist, and millions of Israelis are not going anywhere. The question is whether Israel can continue to exist as a state that privileges one ethno-religious group at the expense of another.

The moral frameworks we apply to other situations demand consistency. When we condemned South African apartheid, we did not call for the expulsion of white South Africans. We called for equal rights. When we support indigenous rights movements, we do not advocate for the displacement of non-indigenous populations. We advocate for justice and equality.

The same principles must apply to Israel-Palestine. Palestinians are not demanding the destruction of Israel—they are demanding equality. The Palestinian call for boycotts, divestment, and sanctions explicitly calls for three basic rights: ending the occupation, granting equal rights to Palestinian citizens of Israel, and respecting the right of return for Palestinian refugees.

These demands are not maximalist but minimal. They represent the same basic rights that Jews have demanded throughout history: the right to live in security, the right to political participation, and the right to return to homes from which they were expelled.

# Conclusion: Beyond Tribal Loyalty

As Jews, we carry the weight of history—not just our own suffering but our responsibility to learn from it. The Holocaust was not simply a tragedy that happened to Jews but a warning about what happens when human beings are categorized as less than human, when discrimination becomes institutionalized, when the international community chooses silence over action.

We dishonor that memory when we apply its lessons selectively. We dishonor our ancestors when we use their suffering to justify the suffering of others. We dishonor Jewish values when we mistake tribal loyalty for moral responsibility.

The path forward requires courage—the courage to acknowledge that legitimate security needs have been perverted into systems of domination, that understandable fears have been manipulated to justify unconscionable policies, that the dream of Jewish return has become a nightmare of Palestinian displacement.

But it also requires hope—hope that Jews and Palestinians can live together in equality, hope that historical grievances can be acknowledged without perpetuating endless cycles of revenge, hope that the land that is sacred to both peoples can be shared rather than dominated.

The choice is ours. We can continue to defend the indefensible, to rationalize the irrational, to mistake criticism for antisemitism and justice for threat. Or we can choose to be worthy of our history, to honor our values, to build a future based on equality rather than supremacy.

The text of our tradition teaches us: ""Justice, justice you shall pursue."" Not justice for some. Not justice when convenient. Justice—period. The time has come to pursue it.",0,1751694434.0,IsraelPalestine,10,0.33,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Witty Analysis: Daegu FC vs. Ulsan Hyundai FC – A Clash of Titans (and a Desperate Underdog)**  
*July 12, 2025 | K League 1 | Odds: Ulsan -250, Daegu +450, Draw +350*

**The Setup:**  
Ulsan Hyundai FC, the K League’s version of a corporate-sponsored Hulk, rolls into this match with a résumé that reads like a LinkedIn profile for a serial champion. They’ve won the K League title *four times since 2019* and have the squad depth of a team that shops at the luxury end of the football transfer market. Daegu FC, meanwhile, is the underdog equivalent of a Netflix true-crime doc: “Can They Survive?” Spoiler: Probably not.

**Key Stats & Trends:**

* **Ulsan’s Recent Form:** Won 1-0 vs. Gwangju FC (July 2025), drew with Pohang Steelers in a 2-2 thriller. Their attack is led by **Nasser Al-Dawsari** (12 goals this season) and **Savić** (5 assists).
* **Daegu’s Struggles:** Lost 1-2 to Gangwon FC in the FA Cup and drew 1-1 with Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors. Their captain, **Cho Hyun-woo**, is a veteran, but the rest of the squad might be wondering if they accidentally joined a farm team.
* **Head-to-Head:** Ulsan has won 6 of the last 10 meetings, including a 2-1 victory in their most recent clash.

**Injuries & Absences:**

* Ulsan’s **Koulibaly** (Achilles) is back in training, while Daegu’s **Park Jin-seop** (2022 Hangzhou Asian Games hero) is questionable with a hamstring issue. Both teams have otherwise full rosters, which is a relief for Ulsan’s PR team trying to avoid another “collapse” headline.

**Odds Breakdown & EV Calculations:**

1. **Ulsan (-250):** Implied probability = 71.4% (100/(250+100)).
2. **Daegu (+450):** Implied probability = 18.2% (100/(450+100)).
3. **Draw (+350):** Implied probability = 22.2% (100/(350+100)).

**Expected Value (EV) Analysis:**

* **Ulsan’s EV:** Assuming their actual win probability is \~65% (based on form and head-to-head), EV = (0.65 \* 1.4) - 1 = **-0.11**. Not great, but they’re the safest bet.
* **Daegu’s EV:** If we split the difference between their implied 18.2% and the 41% underdog win rate for soccer, their adjusted EV = (0.295 \* 5.5) - 1 = **+0.62**. Tempting, but this assumes Daegu can somehow defy logic and Ulsan’s tactical genius.
* **Draw’s EV:** Implied 22.2% vs. historical draw rates (\~25% in K League). EV = (0.25 \* 4.0) - 1 = **0**. Neutral, but not worth the risk.

**The Verdict:**  
**Best Bet: Ulsan Hyundai FC to Win (-250)**  
Why? Because Ulsan is the K League’s version of a Wall Street hedge fund—overhyped but consistently profitable. Daegu’s +450 odds are a siren song for the desperate, and the draw is just the bookmakers’ way of saying, “We’re not *that* confident.”

**Witty Wrap-Up:**  
Daegu FC is like a last-minute birthday gift: you hope it’s not a sweater, but deep down, you know it’s a sweater. Ulsan, on the other hand, is the gift that keeps on giving… goals, trophies, and a very expensive sponsorship deal with your local coffee shop.

**Final Prediction:** Ulsan 2-1 Daegu.  
**EV Takeaway:** Ulsan’s EV is low but positive if you believe in their 65% win chance. Daegu’s EV is tempting, but only if you enjoy watching miracles fail. Stick with the bully. 🦁

1ls2j3o,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1ls2j3o/aio_boyfriend_27m_has_been_texting_another_girl/,"AIO Boyfriend (27M) has been texting another girl, and when I (26F) brought it up, he got extremely defensive. I don’t know what to think.","Hi Reddit,

I (26F) have been in a relationship with my boyfriend (27M) for 6 months. When we became official, I cut off all male attention, deleted Instagram, and really focused on building trust and loyalty in our relationship. Early on, he mentioned he doesn’t have female friends, that his circle is mostly male, and I respected that.

A few months ago, I found out he’s been in contact with a girl from another country. He said she’s a distant relative of his close friend, and that they met through that connection. I didn’t overreact — he told me they just talk occasionally.

One thing I’ve noticed (and maybe this matters, maybe not): every time we’re together, he always places his phone face down on the table. At first I brushed it off, but over time it’s started to feel intentional — like there’s something he doesn’t want me to see.

Fast forward to yesterday: we were out for coffee, and I went to the bathroom. On my way back, I saw him very focused on his phone, clearly messaging someone. I circled around so he wouldn’t notice me, and stood behind him for a few seconds. He was texting that same girl — let’s call her Anna — and he kept glancing toward the direction I had walked off to, almost nervously. He had no idea I was behind him.

When I walked up to him, he quickly switched the screen from chat to a random video. I asked what he was doing, and he said “just watching Reels.” I calmly asked if he was texting Anna, and that’s when he got weirdly defensive. He started saying things like:

> “She’s way younger than me, don’t worry about it.”
“She has a boyfriend anyway.”
“Do you want to see the messages? Go ahead.”



I said it would make me feel more at ease if I could see the conversation — and the moment I said that, he got extremely sulky. He sighed loudly, looked annoyed, and started acting passive-aggressively. When I tried scrolling through the chat, he sarcastically said, “Yeah yeah, scroll up, maybe there are nudes in there.”

I was so uncomfortable that I barely even looked. The whole atmosphere changed. He didn’t talk to me for the rest of the time.
He later apologized for his reaction and said he's been stressed out lately and shouldn't have reacted like that.

For context:
I’ve been cheated on in past relationships — one of them literally texting another girl while holding my hand. So yes, I do carry some trauma, and I’ve worked hard not to let it affect my current relationship. I don’t want to snoop or invade his privacy in the future. But seeing him act so secretive at that moment triggered all those old fears.

I don’t know what to think.
I feel guilty for checking, but I also don’t understand his reaction.
Why get so defensive if it’s “just a chat”?
Why always hide his phone screen — even when we’re just sitting, not talking?

Would love some outside perspective — what does this behavior sound like to you? Am I overthinking it, or is my gut trying to tell me something?

Thanks for reading.

She appears jealous when my boyfriend talks about me highly and compliments me and she often scoffs about her other son’s girlfriend. 

She also actively allows Lucy to deteriorate and then acts like such a stressed mother, talking about how much she has to deal with and it annoys me that she’s constantly phoning my boyfriend and complaining about how unstable Lucy is, yet allows all these things to happen. Anne also phones my bf and his brothers often and will go into her own trauma (that she’s spoke about hundreds of times) for close to 3 hours at times and it’s so draining. She’ll do anything but go to therapy despite it literally being offered to her through the government. I just can’t stand his family. They’re so close knit and they constantly want to be together and just pin it on being together for Lucy, which id understand if they were actually doing things to help her.

1ls2eb9,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucksbaristas/comments/1ls2eb9/had_one_of_those_customers_yesterday_on_the_4th/,Had one of *those* customers yesterday on the 4th…,"
Worked a 7 hour and 45 minute shift where my lunch and first 10 were very early into my shift. Just me, another barista, and my store manager working. Nearing the last hour of my shift, this woman comes through with what seemed like a simple order - an iced coffee with hazelnut. I didn’t actually hear her order perfectly, but my store manager who was listening heard it as iced coffee hazelnut, and I did too, as did the other barista.

There were a few cars ahead of her but finally she gets to the window. I almost always double check with customers at the window for confirmation and said “iced coffee hazelnut?” She said yes.

Then I asked her if she wanted a straw and she took a second to think about it then said yes. Pretty normal experience - she isn’t the most talkative when I ask how her day was, but I was honestly at a point where outside of customers I already knew and got along with, it was hard to have energy to really connect so to speak, so I was fine with that.

Then when I hand her her iced coffee she looks at it like she’s never seen one in her life and I said “it’s an iced coffee” and then she claimed she wanted a frappuccino. I just asked “you wanted a coffee frappuccino with hazelnut?”

At first I thought maybe this was me mishearing since that has happened to me in the past, and I forgot that my manager and other partner mentioned it was iced coffee too at that point. I mentioned the change to my store manager who was working cold bar at that point and she again reiterated she asked for an iced coffee.

And well in cases like this when it isn’t our screwup and even when it is, we charge the customer the difference. I go to ring up a refund for the iced coffee and the order of the coffee frap and mention to the customer I’ll be charging her for the difference and she acts confused. Then I say it again and she says “well it’s your mistake” then I get a bit defensive and just say “we all heard you say iced coffee” and I was gonna try to de-escalate a bit and maybe explain the difference between iced coffee and the coffee frappuccino just in case there was a genuine mix up since she was an older customer.

Then my store manager came around the corner and kind of yelled “you said iced coffee would you like whip on the frappuccino or not” (it was a long day).

And well the customer took the frappuccino and kind of aggressively set the difference in money down on the counter and sped off.

In hindsight I kind of wonder if we did genuinely all mishear her or if she was just gaslighting us, but she did seem genuinely confused when I think back on it. But I also know some people are quite good at playing things up when it comes to these things. I don’t necessarily think my store manager handled the situation as well as she could’ve (but given the situation of us all working a fairly long shift with very low staffing at the tail end) and all of us thinking she said iced coffee, I also don’t think we were in the wrong. Though I also wonder if I’m just assuming the worst as I think she was a semi regular I’ve seen before who could be a bit rude but never pulled anything like that before.

Anyone else have days like this?

[**Update**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1lqzexw/update_i_24f_want_to_break_up_with_my_magician/) **- 3rd July 2025**



**I (24f) want to break up with my magician boyfriend (27m) due to his inappropriate magic trick**



My boyfriend (27m) and I (24f) have been together for 1 year and 3 months. Our relationship has been very loving but has started to get bumpy ever since we moved in together for our 1 year anniversary.

A little backstory:

I'm in college right now pursing my master's degree in Archaeology while also working as a library clerk to earn money. Whereas my boyfriend works as a magician for parties and events. Despite our different career paths, I've never had a problem with his career choice because it makes him happy. He has always found a way to make every day magical which has been sweet. About 9ish months into our relationship I had the opportunity to go on a 2 month archeological excavation in another country for school. Despite us becoming long distance, he had no problem with me going and he was very happy for me. He would send me gifts, letters, and he even sent things for my colleagues in order to brighten up their days. While we were doing long distance we made plans to move into an apartment when I got back due to how much we missed each other. And a few days after I returned we moved in together which has been awful so far.

Before living together we would see each other a few times a week due to my busy schedule but now that we live together we see each other all the time. And he has started to do magic ALL THE TIME. He will make my keys ""disappear"" as I'm trying to go to work or school, he tries to practice his card tricks on me while I'm doing homework, he makes the cleaning rag ""vanish"" when I ask him to clean, and he has recently done something that makes me want to end the relationship. I have never been in this serious of a relationship before so I don't want to throw our loving relationship away just because of these bad few months.

Last month we were getting steamy and he went down on me which isn't unusual. While he was going down on me he was saying some dirty talk here and there. I was lost in the moment for obvious reasons but I snapped out of it when he said, ""Oh, how did that get in there?"" And I watched him pull a coin from my crotch. He found the coin moment hilarious but it just took me out of the moment and instantly made me annoyed so we stopped. Later I told him that him doing the magic in the bedroom made me literally dry up so I asked him to keep that kind of magic out of the bedroom. He explained to me that he was trying to make me laugh/have fun and he didnt apologize for it. I talked with some of my friends about it and they thought it was funny so I figured that I was overreacting and needed to lighten up a bit. But he didnt do any magic tricks in the bedroom for the next few weeks.

However, four days ago we were having sex and he suddenly started to yell ""OW!"" So I quickly got off of him and was asking what was wrong. He tells me, ""I think there's something in you. Let me check."" I laid on the bed like I was at the goddamn gyno because I trusted that if something was wrong then he would find it. After like two minutes he says, ""Oh, here it is."" And I watched as he was pulling up a long ribbon thing that kept going and going and going. It took a second for me to realize that it was one of his magic tools that he had purposely put in me while he was ""checking to see what he felt."" He found it hilarious and couldn't stop laughing while he was pulling the string more and more. I ripped the thing out while doing itand I yelled at him for doing another magic trick like that even though i told him not to. He told me that he was just adding more fun to our sex life and that he wanted to see what the magic trick would look like if it was coming out from a crotch. (The original magic trick involves putting the coil thing in your own mouth and pulling out the plastic string for a while.) I was pissed off so I made him go stay at his parents house for past few days. This morning, I talked with him some more but he still thinks that its not a big deal.

I get that he's a magician and that he loves magic but I'm still upset about him breaking that boundary I had set. I'm fine with his magic tricks 85% of the time but sex is where I draw the line. I am demisexual so I need to have a strong, trusting, and close relationship with someone before I can even think about having sex with them. So him breaking my boundary has really hurt me and I've lost my trust in him. However, everyone I have talked to about the situation says that what he did was hilarious. And I have been told by multiple people that I'm overreacting which is why I decided to go to reddit.

We have built a strong relationship and I really saw myself marrying him one day. I fully trusted him and now I dont know if I ever can again. Should we break up? Or can we fix this and stay together? I'm lost so I'd appreciate any advice. Thanks.

**Update - 3 days later**



First off no, this story isn't AI or fake. It's sadly true but I can understand why people would think that its AI due to the absurdity of it. Secondly, thank you everyone for the advice in the comments of my previous post. I was lost and looking for some advice because of the uncomfortable situation and people around me felt differently about it than I did. People in the comments were right and I should trust my own feelings rather than searching for answers from the people around me. That's something that I've struggled with my whole life because my family is very reliant on each other and my parents are both helicopter parents. So I learned from young age that I couldn't trust my own instincts because other people know better. Which is why I asked my friends and mom about the situation. I have a lot more work to do in trusting myself but at least I'm working on it now.

Here's the update:

After my previous post, I read through some of the comments and realized that what my boyfriend did would be considered assault. It wasn't something that I had even considered because I was only seeing it as him doing something stupid in the bedroom that broke my boundary and made me uncomfortable. But seeing those comments opened up my eyes a lot. If he was willing to break my boundary only after a year of dating and could do that to me in the bedroom than what else could he be capable of?

I met with him the next day at our apartment and I told him about my feelings which he didn't seem to care about. I showed him the reddit post so that he could see that other people were also uncomfortable with what happened. He read through your comments but when he saw the word 'assault' being used a few times he got really aggravated. I had never seen him that angry before but he was screaming nonstop and he even whipped my coffee mug across the room. I ended up crying because I was scared and I think that snapped him back to reality or something because he stopped yelling and was trying to comfort me. I made him leave our apartment again because I didnt want to be around him anymore. That night my friends helped me pack up my stuff and they took me to my parents house which is where I'm at now.

After I was out of the apartment and safe, I called him and broke up with him over the phone because I didn't feel comfortable doing it in person after his previous reaction. I'm so upset that I wasted over a year of my life dating him and even thinking about a future with him. Thank you all for giving me the courage to follow my feelings and break up with him for good. I really appreciate it. Also, thank you for all the jokes its lightened the mood and has helped me feel a bit better about this situation. Yes ezagreb, the magic is gone and its time for me to disappear.

*Don't be upset about ""wasting time"" on someone you're young and it was a year. These ""wasted"" times are so pivotal to us as adults. What you got from that relationship is a spine. You stood on your own two feet and said, not once but twice, this isn't an acceptable way to treat me and it isn't okay. This is a tool you will use for the rest of your life in many types of relationships. Don't feel sad, feel empowered.*

1ls2c82,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/1ls2c82/is_this_even_allowed/,is this even allowed ??,"i worked at this coffee shop/cafe for about 2 months before i left.

however i realised that there is some MAJOR red flags when i first started working there.

1. No FIFO the boss and staff there just anyhow replenish the stock without looking at the dates
2. Pay is ALWAYS short. Once my pay was 80 short. Boss paid me back but still paid 5 short but i closed one eye since its just 5
3. boss always making false claims like he will train the newbies on site if he places them on a weekend but then he just dips after like 10 mins
4. boss doesnt have any interest in coffee and just simply started this coffee chain for fun / money and doesnt really bother to learn about coffee. the way they pulls a shot,steam milk is all wrong.
5. always cancel your shift last min then dont bother telling you and just sends out the new schedule without stating whos shift got amended
6. same like the 5th point, boss will randomly add your shift without telling you also. esp the day before without confirming if you still can work that day or not.
7. constantly hiring new people then removing the shifts from the older workers.
8. they pay you your salary via their personal paynow ?? isnt that super sus ??

the 5 & 6th point really ICKED me because it has disrupted a lot of my plans as well, i have to cancel and reschedule some of my plans just because he randomly put me down on shift without even double confirming if im still able to work on certain days. I did try saying no but he just said that this is the last time he will be doing this and they will consult me before adding me into the schedule without double confirming (which they never did)

there was once i had 5 shifts in a week and he kept removing it and i eventually ended up with 1 shift for that week.",8,1751693009.0,SGExams,11,1.0,False

She is on a lot of medication, clozapine being one of them. It is strongly advised not to drink on clozapine. She is the centre of their family and she is priority for them and I get that, but here’s what I don’t get. 

His mum, let’s call her Anne, receives carers benefits from the government, but is always allowing her to drink and it’s clearly making her worse. As soon as she starts drinking, the symptoms clearly increase. 

Lucy becomes disorganised, talking quickly to the point none of it makes sense, is clearly delusional and frantic. Anne just continues to allow her to get more and more drinks, she even pays for them. Anne will say “well she’s an adult and I can’t tell her what to do.” While I get this to an extent, I can’t help but think about the fact she’s responsible for her? Why not go to coffee shops instead of bars? 

As well as this, they talk about triggering topics to someone with schizophrenia such as the ‘after life’ and spiritual shit that also clearly sends Lucy into a spiral. They entertain the illness too much imo and are aware of this too. My bf has called out the spiritual crap before but they just keep doing it. I find it so hard to be around them but at the same time I can’t just tell him I’m never gonna see them or come along when he’s meeting them ever again, but it all makes me so angry. 

I can’t stand the way Anne almost encourages Lucy to drink and I can’t stand the way she constantly wants her sons around too.

1ls29bb,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1ls29bb/unheard_voices_part_1/,Unheard Voices Part 1.,"Chapter 1: Echoes in the Evidence

""Hello, and welcome back to Unheard Voices. This time, we’ll be listening to Ashley Thompson.

On the late night of August 12, 1997, I went out on a date at Lockhart Smokehouse. I returned to my apartment — 2508 Ivy Brook, in Arlington — early on August 13. Later that morning, I called my boss to say I’d be late for work.

I never showed up.

On January 5, 1998, some hunters found my body in a wooded area near a creek, in the 6200 block of Baraboo Drive, Dallas. I’d been shot.

During that time, a homicide task force had been formed by the Fort Worth Police Department. Several female bodies had turned up across the region. Mine was one of the cases they investigated...

Stay tuned every Saturday for weekly episodes, where we give voices to those who can’t speak"".

David ended the recording, saved the file, and shut his laptop with a soft click. He slid into bed, exhaustion pulling at him. The room was still, lit only by the dim red glow of his audio interface.

In sleep, the memories crept in.

The air had smelled like rain. And something sweet, jasmine maybe.

There were flashes. Fragments.

A red scarf flapping in the wind.
Someone calling his name.
A scream sharp, then swallowed by silence.
He saw her. Maybe.

A silhouette at the top of the stairs. Her face turned. Or missing. Blurred like an old photograph left in the sun too long.

He woke in the dark, gasping. Heart hammering against his ribs like it wanted out.

His shirt was soaked. The sheets too. Cold sweat clung to him the kind that whispered something was wrong, even if you couldn’t name it.

He sat upright, unmoving. Just breathing. Fast. Shaky. Trying to piece it together.

Then, across the room, he saw on the wall.

Old newspapers. Crime scene photos. Handwritten notes. Pinned and webbed together by red string.

At the center, written bold and unrelenting:

Who did it?

Chapter 2: Whispers from the File

The night clung to the city in heavy silence. Outside, the occasional hiss of passing cars. Inside, only the low hum of David’s computer and the soft buzz of his desk lamp.

He sat at his desk, headphones around his neck, eyes on the screen. Ashley’s voice still echoed in his mind. Her story had rattled something in him not just sadness, not just anger.

Something else.

Familiarity.

He leaned back and stared at the ceiling for a moment, letting the stillness settle. Unheard Voices had started years ago, back when he was barely old enough to rent the apartment he now lived in. It was supposed to be about giving victims a voice. It still was.

But somewhere along the way, it had become something more personal.

Something unfinished.

He glanced toward the corkboard in the corner, his mother’s case still taking up the most space. A shrine of frustration and stubborn hope.

""MOTHER OF ONE FOUND DEAD IN FORT WORTH ALLEY – NO SUSPECTS""
The headline stared back at him, circled three times in red.

He rubbed the back of his neck, stood up, and stretched.

Just for a moment, he reached for a few older folders from his filing cabinet. Something in Ashley’s case had struck a chord, but he couldn’t name it. So he followed the feeling.

He laid out a few past episodes, the ones that had stayed with him longer than most.

Episode 1 – Natasha Lane (covered year one)

Episode 2 – Lana Walters (season two)

Episode 3 – Emily Monroe (last year)

Episode 4 – Ashley Thompson (just posted tonight)

He flipped through them without purpose, just letting instinct guide him. They were years apart different seasons, different moments in his life. He hadn’t thought of them as connected before. Still didn’t.

But something about them, it stirred that gut feeling again.

Same unease. Same weight behind the words.

Like they were circling the same storm, without ever realizing it.

He let out a breath and pushed the thought aside. There was no clear connection. Not yet.

Just a feeling.

He put the folders back and returned to his desk. Ashley’s waveform still glowed faintly on the screen.

With a few quick clicks, he closed the project and opened a new  blank folder.

He started digging around online, pulling up case files, local forums, archived police reports. That’s when he stumbled on her name:

Regina McClain.

Murdered in 2018. Found near a drainage ditch just outside Mesquite. Gunshot wound. Purse still on her. No signs of struggle. No suspects.

Barely covered in the press. One article. One photo.

He opened the file and leaned in.

She was smiling in the photo, a hand resting on her hip. A blurred brick wall behind her, maybe a restaurant. Nothing jumped out. Nothing obvious.

Then came the police report. Sparse. A timeline. Witness statements. The medical examiner’s note.

And then, at the very bottom of the scanned scene log, something strange.

""Found torn scrap of paper in victim’s jacket pocket. Handwriting: unknown. Says only: ""He hears you"".

David skimmed it once, made a mental note, then moved on-too focused on timeline inconsistencies to dwell on it.

It didn’t mean anything. Probably someone else’s note. Something misplaced.

He clicked over to the map—marked the scene.

Then closed the file for the night.

The room felt heavier somehow.

He didn’t know it yet, but that torn paper was never meant for Regina.

Chapter 3: He Hears You

Year 2018

It had been quiet for years.

Not peace. Not guilt. Just quiet.

After the girl dead in Dallas the one they called Ashley he stopped. Not out of fear. Not because he felt watched. It just... no longer served a purpose. There was no thrill in routine. He already knew how the story ended.

They never caught him.

They never came close.

The task force was a mess. Faces changed. Files shuffled. Interest died faster than the girls did.

So he faded.

New name. New job. New walls to hide behind.

But even in stillness, he listened.

Sometimes, in motel rooms or long stretches of highway, he’d scroll through newsfeeds or crime forums. Quiet curiosity. Nothing more. He liked seeing how far they'd drifted from the truth.

But one night, sometime in late 2018, the algorithm offered something new.

A podcast.

Unheard Voices.

The name alone made his jaw twitch.

He didn’t click right away. He let the title episode sit in his mind like an itch beneath the skin.

That name.

He remembered.

Not her face. Not what she wore. Just her name, caught in the back of his mind like something under a fingernail.

""Cassandra Serna"".

She had been one of the early ones. Before the task force. Before people started to notice.

He hadn't heard her name in years.

He closed his eyes and let the voice continue. It was near perfect recounting, some facts off, some pieces missing—but it was enough.

Someone was looking.

Someone was talking about her.

That... hadn’t happened before.

He felt it behind his ribs not fear, not thrill, just the slow tightening of a thread he thought had unraveled; Something woke up in him.

He went back to his car.

Didn’t sleep.

By morning, he had a plan.

Her name was Regina McClain.

She wasn’t important. Not personally. Not like Cassandra. Not like any of them.

But she was near. She was easy.

She would be enough.

He watched her from a distance for three days. She had patterns. She walked alone. Laughed with her phone against her cheek. Ate dinner late. Always tipped well.

The night he followed her, the air was cool. She didn’t scream.

It was never about chaos.

It was about control.

By dawn, she was gone.

Crime Scene Log — Mesquite, TX – 2018

""Found torn scrap of paper in victim’s jacket pocket. Handwriting: unknown. Says only: ‘He hears you.’”

He folded the note himself. Took his time.

It didn’t matter who found it.

What mattered was that it had been left.

Not for Regina.

For the voice.

The one speaking for them.

Chapter 4: Paper Voices

Back to 2023

The episode was live.

David leaned back in his chair, his eyes tracking the final upload bar as the Regina McClain case hit the feed. 

The numbers ticked up.

Regina's story weighed on him. There was something unsettling about the silence surrounding her death. Forgotten. Underreported. Almost as if someone wanted it that way.

He had nearly missed her name an accidental find during research. But now, her story was out there. Unheard no more.

He didn’t stop. The next case folder was already waiting.

Madison Rios – 2019

A college senior, art major. Found murdered in a downtown stairwell after a gallery showing. No witnesses. No leads.

David scanned the crime scene details with only half his attention until one line caught him:

“Torn sketchbook paper recovered from backpack. Handwritten: ‘Paint me in silence.’”

He blinked.

He copied the quote into his research notes.

""Strange..."" he muttered. It wasn’t part of the crime report. Not even mentioned by the media. Just... there.

He filed it away and moved on.

Deborah Ann King – 2020

A warehouse night worker, 46, lived alone. Found murdered behind an abandoned theater.

David read the report slowly, bleary eyes, black coffee in hand. Then another line stopped him cold:

“Folded note found in jacket: ‘The Echo That Bled.’”

He sat up straighter.

Three cases. Three years. Three victims. Three lines.

He returned to Madison's case and Regina's and read the phrase again:

""He hears you""
""Paint me in silence.""
""The Echo That Bled.""

Unsettling. Poetic. Specific.

He opened a fresh document, labeled it: Found Phrases.

He didn’t know why yet. It was just a gut feeling.

He’d been doing this long enough to know when something didn’t belong. And these... these weren’t just odd flourishes. They felt intentional. Like someone wanted them seen.

But why?

Jessica Nguyen – 2021

Quiet. Well-liked. Taught fourth grade.

She disappeared walking home from school. Her body was later found in a park.

David scrolled through the official report. Then he stopped:

“Message found on store receipt, tucked in her boot: ‘Echoes don’t lie.’”

David exhaled slowly.

""four"".

four victims. four years. four phrases.

He opened his note document again and added the new line.

A pattern was forming. The only connection? The lines. The tone. There was something deliberate here.

He turned his gaze to the wall of his office. The corkboard. The names, the pins, the timelines. His mother’s case at the center.

These women weren’t on that board yet.

Mia Bell – 2022

Aspiring musician. Twenty-six. Found outside a venue she never made it into.

The final note:

“Your voice woke me.”

David froze.

His voice.

That wasn’t coincidence.

It hit harder than the rest—like a whisper through a locked door.

The others had felt like cryptic poetry. This one felt... personal.

Still, no context. No explanation. Just a line, buried in a police file no one had bothered to read twice.

David didn’t know what it meant.

But he knew this wasn’t over.

He saved the files.

Opened a new folder.

Chapter 5: The One Who Listens

It had been bothering him for days.

David stared at the document open on his desktop: five names, typed in bold.

Regina McClain
Madison Rios
Deborah Ann King
Jessica Nguyen
Mia Bell

He wasn’t supposed to think they were connected.

Different Counties. Different backgrounds. Different years.

But it wouldn’t leave him alone.

He leaned back in his chair, eyes flicking between windows—maps, timelines, articles, police reports. A familiar symphony was building around him.

It had started as an itch. Now it was a rhythm.

The Method
All shot. All clean. All without signs of robbery or assault. All left somewhere public or remote, but late—just late enough to be missed.

The Notes
Each one strange. Almost poetic. Cryptic. Folded. Tucked away.

He reread them now, the words echoing louder in his mind:

""He hears you""
“Paint me in silence.”
“The Echo That Bled.”
“Echoes don’t lie.”
“Your voice woke me.”

They weren’t just odd. They were consistent. A voice trying to be heard but not by the police.

By someone else.

David pressed his palms into his eyes.

""By me? No.."" he whispered.

He pulled up a digital map and dropped pins: Plano. Garland. Denton. Grand Prairie.

Close. Spread just enough to be missed unless you were looking from far enough away.

The kind of distance the Police wouldn't see

He started pulling dates:

Regina McClain : 2018

Madison: 2019

Deborah: 2020

Jessica: 2021

Mia: 2022

One each year.

There it was—the rhythm. Precise. Controlled.

Not spontaneous.

Planned.

A killer with patience. With ritual. And now, apparently, with an audience.

He opened his research folder as he remember a phrase in one of the early episodes and found Natasha Lane-1995, one of first cases he’d covered back in the early days of the podcast.

He skimmed the files. That line. That terrible line.

“The silence is final.”

A chill ran down his spine.

A Seven phrase?.

The pattern was undeniable. Too tight. Too perfect.

He paused.

The voices. The clues.

This wasn’t random.

He turned away from the computer screen, his eyes locking onto the wall where his corkboard was pinned with case files; He reached over and grabbed a fresh piece of paper. With a red marker, he began drawing circles around the phrases. He circled the dates. The cities.

The rhythm.

And then the name hit him, sharp and sudden:

""The Whisperer"".

Not because he shouted. Not because he made himself known.

But because of how quiet he was.

How careful.

The Whisperer didn’t force his way into the world.

He crept into it.

Unseen. Unheard.

Until someone started listening back.

David stared at the name in front of him. ""The Whisperer"".

It felt right. Instinctual. The killer wasn’t loud. He wasn’t reckless. He had a pattern, a message, a ritual.

And for the first time in years, David felt like he was close.

But how close? and to what?

His eyes flicked back to his mother’s case file.

Had this been the same killer all along? Had the pattern existed before these women? Was his mother another name on a growing list?

David couldn’t be sure.

But one thing was clear: The Whisperer was Speaking. And now, so was he",1,1751692698.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

1ls24wh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Moccamaster/comments/1ls24wh/kbt_moccamaster_impressions_after_one_year/,KBT Moccamaster: Impressions After One Year,"I purchased the Moccamaster KBT Brushed Steel exactly one year ago and want to provide an honest review to anyone who might be considering.

TL;DR - Brews a good-to-great cup of coffee but is completely overpriced with similar machines delivering similar taste at half the price.  Stylish looks but build quality is cheap plastic, zero features that come standard on even the most basic coffee machines, thermal carafe does poor job keeping coffee hot, brew wand is quite narrow so poor blooming and water coverage over grounds.

More in depth below:

Build quality: Below Average.  There is so much plastic in this thing and parts do feel cheap and flimsy.  I know Moccamaster does its best to sell this as a ""feature"" on its site but I can confirm these parts do not feel durable at all (despite their claim) and the flow symbols on the brew basket have already completely rubbed off.  And, on a side note, the idea of using plastic in order to ""cut down on environmental impact"" seems a bit backwards in general.  

Taste: Above average.  It absolutely does brew a very nice cup of coffee - bold and strong.  I typically like darker, waxier roasts and the Moccamaster delivered delicious results.  By far the best part of this machine - that being said, I wouldn't say it was the best cup I've ever had or life-changing or anything like that but definitely a consistent, delicious brew.  However, overall the price-to-taste ratio is probably not there - I'm not sure I could really tell the difference between this and my old bonavita at half the price.

Features: Below Average.  Literally only an on/off switch and no basic features that exist on most $25 dollar machines.  Basket flow adjustment consists of manually adjusting a switch for a tiny plastic hole.  After the initial purchase excitement wore off, the lack of a auto-brew timer function really became an issue for me for my early morning wake-ups.

Temperature: Poor.  This one irks me the most - the water comes out of the wand at ~180 degrees and by the time it goes through the slurry and over the plastic cap on the carafe, it drops in temperature significantly.  The solution from the company was to pre-fill the carafe with hot water and then dump it upon brewing which is a difficult and time consuming request.  Again, an issue I never ran into on even the cheapest coffee machines.

Style: Above average.  The thing looks great, no doubt about it!

I'm a shut in. I've been a shut in most of my life. Even with a very active social life i was a shut in, as in, i only ever got out for social events and there were many weeks upon weeks where i didn't even take a walk. When i had no social life it was the same, and now that said social life is limited its no different.

Why? I just don't enjoy being outside by itself. I can't remember any walk i ever took as a fond memory, any time it uplifted my spirit to go to a park, bar or coffee shop. All of my interests, hobbies and pass times are either only online or preferable to do online.

I would prefer to blame this feeling on depression as it would be a lot simpler and there's plenty of avenues to approach that, but the truth is that i've felt this way in very fulfilling and happy moments in my life.

The reason i know this is because i was actually, at one point, very depressed. At that point i sought escapism from the internet ironically enough, so i took many walks, many hours outside, and yet, after all those days i always reached the same conclusion i did as a young teenager: about 1 hour of aimless walking and i was back in my room. Some days i stretched it to 3 hours. It didn't matter, i'd always be back, and it always felt pointless to even try anything else than just staying inside.

You grab a snack, you see the scenery, if you're absurdly lucky maybe some benign chit chat that means nothing and brings nothing to you. No connection is made. I honestly felt lonelier any time i went outside on my own than any time online.

It doesn't matter if im in my hometown, the big city, a rural area or a touristy party beach town. I always feel this way. I've had a life without screens, i did a semi long term dopamine detox. It was some of the most boring, loneliest times in life i've ever had. At least i got plenty of sun.

In fact, lets say i leave tomorrow at 2 pm sharp. No long term hobbies, no plans, no friends or family to go with. What am i doing, realistically speaking? Am i even going to last to 6 pm? I don't think i am.

Even negative interactions are pretty sparse, not that i'd prefer them, but thats what i mean by the world feels dead. There's nothing to engage with, nobody to interact with, even negative aspects themselves are few and far between. I just feel nothing when i go out. It's like watching paint dry.

I hope someone understands this rant, im praying someone at least replies to it. I rarely see this sentiment echoed online.",7,1751691907.0,GenZ,25,0.77,False
1ls1ybb,https://www.reddit.com/r/wearetogetherasone/comments/1ls1ybb/how_ai_is_transforming_the_dropshipping_landscape/,How AI is Transforming the Dropshipping Landscape,"Hey everyone, after the launch of ChatGPT in 2022, a seemingly laid back industry suddenly became alive. From TV channels to startups you could AI this, AI that. Since then AI has evolved immensely. However, being a dropshipping fanatic, can AI really help the industry, here is what i found out. 

1. **Product Research:** AI tools can analyze market trends and consumer behavior, helping us identify trending products faster than ever. This means we can make informed decisions about what to sell.  
2. **Inventory Management:** AI algorithms can predict inventory needs based on sales data and seasonal trends, reducing the risk of overstocking or stockouts.  
3. **Customer Service:** AI-powered chatbots are becoming increasingly sophisticated. They can handle customer inquiries 24/7, providing instant support and freeing up our time for other tasks.  
4. **Dynamic Pricing:** AI analyzes competitors’ pricing in real-time, allowing us to adjust our prices dynamically to stay competitive while maximizing profits.  
5. **Personalized Marketing:** AI such as Accio which works with wholesalers like Alibaba retailers and dropshippers creates targeted marketing campaigns by analyzing customer data. Normally, when a business targets a certain group of high quality customers, higher conversion rates are assured.  

# Questions for the Community:

* Have you integrated any AI tools into your dropshipping business? If so, which ones?
* What challenges have you faced while adopting AI solutions?
* Do you think AI will become essential for dropshippers in the future?

That's all for today. Let me sip my coffee as I read your comments.

I was thrown against the wall, slammed against the kitchen island, and dragged across the carpet. Over the years, I had gotten pretty good at hiding my bruises. But it wasn't until Otter, the Sargant at Arms for the Wild Kings, saw it all.......

# Chapter 1

Chapter One

Willow

I REALLY HAVE no idea how this shit happens to me. Every single day I get up early and go for my run. Once I’m done, I take a shower and get ready for the day. However, something always seems to happen to make me late no matter where I’m going. Especially when it comes to work. I don’t think there’s a single day since I started working at Inked Up that I’ve been early or on time. No matter how hard I try, something always seems to get in the way of how I want my day to go.

Today it’s everything breaking down on me. I went to get my tea and ended up having to clean my kitchen which was flooding. Something in the sink broke and I had to turn the water off so it would stop pouring out all over the place. None of the pipes under the sink appear to be broken, but that doesn’t mean anything. There’s obviously something really wrong if the water started spewing all over the place and turning off the faucet didn’t make it stop.

After changing, redoing my hair and make-up, and getting my things around to head out, the door wouldn’t lock. I never leave my house unlocked because I don’t trust my brother, Jared. Jared is an asshole and will come in and rob me blind if he knew I left everything open and unlocked. Even when I’m here, I don’t leave the doors unlocked or open the windows. In the summer, I have an air conditioner and make sure it’s in a window Jared can’t reach unless he pulls out the busted up ladder from the garage. Anyway, it took me almost twenty minutes to get my front door locked and that’s after messing with the alarm so it wouldn’t go off.

So, my day is starting out to be the same as every other day I wake up—not good or easy. Racing to my car, I almost trip over the edge of the cracked sidewalk. I’ve told myself for almost a year now that I’m going to rip it all out and fix it with new cement, but I never do. I’d probably end up stuck in the drying cement and not be able to get out or something. I am no use when it comes to projects around the house. I try and usually end up making more of a mess than what was originally there. The only thing I can do right around my small house is make sure the flowers are planted and blooming as my mom used to do.

My mom taught me from a young age to work in the gardens she has surrounding the home I grew up in. They line the front sidewalk, are in front of the house, and there’s a small flower garden at the back of the house where a swing has sat my entire life. I used to spend countless hours out there with my mom as she planted seeds, watered flowers, or we just spent time together on the swing rocking back and forth as she told me all about gardening and showering the flowers with love.

She died when I was about eight years old. I was told by my father it was a car accident, but I don’t buy his version of the story. He thinks I was too young to remember he never let her drive for any reason. My mom had to walk everywhere she went. Including the store to buy a month’s worth of groceries at one time. She was only allowed to go once a month and my father would get milk and other staples we needed weekly when he was out doing whatever it is he used to do. So, I don’t believe she died in a car accident, but I can’t prove something actually happened to her. I think about this every single day and wish I could have gotten her away from my father and brother before she lost her life.

My father wasn’t a good man. He drank from the time he woke up until he finally passed out each night, couldn’t keep a job, treated everyone around him horribly, and wouldn’t let me do anything outside of the house. If I even mentioned a friend from school, they soon were ignoring me for some reason. My father told me on a daily basis what a weak, pathetic, useless, piece of shit I was. He might not have beaten me, but he didn’t stop my brother Jared from beating the hell out of me on a daily basis. When I was old enough, my father tried to demand I steal him things from stores, our neighbors, and others in Cedar Bay. Jared would always beat me when I refused. Honestly, I’m surprised child protection services weren’t called into my home on a regular basis because of all the bruises covering my body at all times.

Jared’s favorite thing to do was torment and torture me in a variety of new ways he thought up. I swear, he’d spend hours of his time just thinking up new ways to beat and hurt me. His best friend David helped him on a regular basis. Not only did they pick on me for being extremely clumsy, but they beat me, chased away anyone who talked to me for any reason, and tried to pimp me out to the boys in their class. I didn’t go a day without one of them hurting me to the point I’d be curled up in a ball to protect myself or crying in my room where no one could see.

The happiest day of my life was when my father went out and never returned. I haven’t reported him missing because I don’t want him to be found. If someone, one of the neighbors usually, questions where he’s been, I come up with some lame reason he hasn’t been around. Though, I don’t think anyone is really mad or upset he’s not been in Cedar Bay for a while now. It’s also the same day Jared and David disappeared. They moved out of the house I grew up in and I hardly see them around. Yeah, my father let David move in when he got kicked out of his own house for beating the shit out of his mom. That’s who my father chose to surround me with. He never gave a shit about me because I didn’t bow down to his demands and do the horrible things he wanted me to.

These are the thoughts I have as I finally make my way to work. Almost a half hour late at this point. I swear, I could literally wake up as the sun rises and not go for my daily run or anything and still not get there on time. Otter, the manager of Inked Up, has checked on me more than once to make sure I’m okay when I arrive late. He always asks why and never raises his voice when I explain what’s happened. He’s a good boss. At least I think so. Even when he’s yelling at someone or barking out orders, Otter’s a good boss. Anyone else would have fired my ass already for always being late and having to replace as much shit in the tattoo shop as he’s had to because of me.

When I say I’m clumsy, I don’t just mean I trip over air and am always having days like today. Anything that can possibly happen or go wrong, usually happens to me. I’ve dropped entire boxes of sterilized needles and had to throw them out because they hit the floor and went flying in the storeroom when I’ve been putting orders away. No one in the shop will use a needle, even if it’s still sealed in the packaging, once it’s hit the floor or anything else. It’s a good system we have and I really try not to mess it up, but things happen when I’m around.

Pulling in the back of Inked Up, I park my car away from the bikes and other cars already here. As I shut off my engine, my phone pings from my purse. It’s an old cell phone I’ve had for years and definitely needs to be replaced. I just don’t have the money to replace it. I dig around my bag until my hands wrap around the small phone and pull it out. Opening it up, yes it’s a flip phone, I see Otter has sent me a message.

Otter: Are you okay? Coming into work today?

Me: I just pulled in. I had a small issue at the house this morning and had to deal with it before anything else. Be inside in a second. I’m so sorry!

Putting my phone back in my bag, I pull the keys from the ignition and toss them inside the mess as well. Getting out of my beat-up car that used to belong to my mom before my father banned her from driving, I look down at the ground as the silence is disrupted by the squeaking hinges of the door. It barely shuts and I have to fight most days to get the engine to turn over. This car isn’t going to last me forever, but it’s a good car and I’ll drive it until I can’t any longer.

Rushing across the parking lot, I pull open the back door of Inked Up just as someone goes to open it from the inside. I go flying backward and almost land on my ass. If it weren’t for the hands grabbing my arms, I’d be in a crumpled mess on the ground right now. Looking up, I find Trenton towering over me. He’s a member of the Wild Kings MC, but I can’t think of calling him by his road name. He’ll always be Trenton to me. Trenton and I grew up in Cedar Bay. I’ve known him my entire life. I’ve told him I’ll never call him Riggs and he seems to be okay with that.

“Are you okay, Willow?” he asks me, looking down my body to make sure I’m not hurt.

“I’m okay, Trenton. Today is just another day in my life. How mad is Otter?” I return, knowing I already messaged him from the car.

“He’s not mad. Worried, but not mad. You know he never gets mad at you. I’m headin’ out to grab some coffee. Do you want anythin’ while I’m out?”

“No, thank you. I’ll be okay until lunch.”

Trenton holds the door open for me before letting it shut as he goes to get coffee for everyone. Making my way down the hall of the shop, I give a small wave to Karsyn who’s already tattooing his first client of the day. Getting a chin lift in response, I continue on my way to the front desk. I can already see the computer on and waiting for me to get started. There’s also paperwork to be filed in the bin sitting on top of the counter. It must be from Karsyn’s client.

As I go to pull out my chair, I trip over nothing at all and stumble. Just when I have a tight grip on the chair I sit in and think I’ve got my feet back under me, the chair goes flying to the side leaving me to fall forward once more. I slam my head into the computer monitor before hitting the edge of the desk. Pain instantly ricochets through my head and I know I’ve bitten my tongue. Blood fills my mouth and I can barely hear anything around me as I slump to the floor. I try to shake the pain and fog filling my mind away, but only cause more pain to fill me. I managed to really hurt myself this time.

“Willow? Are you okay? What the fuck happened?” Otter’s voice penetrates the fog filling my mind.

“I-I’m o-o-okay,” I stammer out, my voice barely above a whisper as I force the bile back down so I’m not embarrassing myself even more.

“Let’s get you into the break room. I need to clean up your head and see how bad the damage is,” my boss says.

I hold out my hand fully expecting him to help me to my feet and walk behind me to the break room we have here. Otter bends down in front of me as my vision returns to normal and lifts me up in his arms. My bag falls to the floor at his feet, spilling the contents all over the floor.

“I-I-I can walk,” I tell him, my entire body tight as his arms wrap tighter around my body and I place my hands on his shoulders.

“I know you can. However, we’ve seen this mornin’ isn’t goin’ to be a good one for you. So, why don’t you let me carry you back there and see how bad the wound on your head is?” he returns, his voice gentle compared to when he’s barking out orders at us all.

I don’t bother responding. Otter isn’t looking for a response right now. He’s going to do what he wants to do and there’s no arguing with him. If I’ve learned anything about him since I got hired, it’s that Otter has a mind of his own and nothing will sway him once he’s made it up about something. Plus, I’ve seen way more of my boss than I ever thought I’d see. I’ve caught Otter in more than one compromising position when I’ve walked in a room to clean it. I thought he was done with his session and he was. He was just fucking the client in the chair after completing her tattoo. It’s hard to look at a man when you’ve seen parts of him you shouldn’t see.

Otter gently lays me on the couch after entering our break room. He rushes to the sink and grabs the towel I switch out every day to dry the dishes we may use. My eyes are locked on him as he wets the towel and rings it out before making his way back over to me. I lean back as he carefully wipes the blood from my face. So much for doing my make-up today!

“This looks horrible, Willow. I’m gonna call the club’s doctor in to have a look at things. Make sure you don’t need to go have your head checked or get stitches. I know head wounds bleed like a bitch, but this is really bad,” Otter informs me as he continues wiping the sticky mess from my face, neck, and upper chest. I guess I really did a number on myself this time.

“I don’t think I need stitches or anything, Otter. I appreciate it, but it’s not necessary. I’ll put a Band-Aid on it and get to work. I’m already late because of the mess at home,” I tell him, knowing I’m losing money every second I’m back here and not at the desk.

“Willow,” is the only thing he says, his voice a low warning for me not to argue with him.

Like I said, when Otter gets something in his mind, there’s no changing it. Stubborn man!

Once I’m cleaned up, Otter gets another towel and wets it before bringing it back over to me. He makes me lay down flatter on the couch before placing it over the cut I have on my forehead. At the same time, Trenton walks in the breakroom. I can smell the coffee he went to get.

“What the fuck happened to Willow?” he questions, his tone harder than normal. “This isn’t from the parkin’ lot, is it?”

“What the fuck happened in the parkin’ lot?” Otter returns, his voice cold and hard. Something I haven’t heard from him before.

“I was goin’ out as Willow was comin’ in. She almost went flyin’ but I stopped her from hittin’ the ground. I didn’t know she hit her damn head. Why didn’t you say anythin’?” Trenton responds, moving closer to me as I peek through the bottom edge of the towel covering my upper face.

“It wasn’t from that. I tripped on my way to my desk. Hit the monitor, the edge of the desk, and then collapsed on the floor,” I tell him, not wanting him to think this is his fault for any reason. “Just another day in my life.”

Neither man find this situation funny. I guess I really can’t blame them because I am bleeding all over the place. However, I’m used to this kind of stuff happening.

“I thought I was done dealin’ with this shit when I left home. I don’t know who’s worse, Willow. You or my mom,” Otter mumbles.

“Stay with her. I’m gonna call Doc in and check her desk out. Make sure we don’t need a new computer. Willow, don’t fuckin’ move from this couch,” Otter barks out his orders before leaving Trenton and me in the breakroom.

Trenton doesn’t say a word as he sets the tray of coffees on the table and brings a garbage can back over with him. I appreciate the gesture as nausea still fills me. I’ve definitely messed my head up this time. It’s been a long time since I’ve had a head injury bad enough where I felt as if I were going to be sick like this.

“Thank you, Trenton,” I murmur, my voice lower than normal as embarrassment and shame fill me.

I’ve learned to live with my clumsiness—it’s happened all my life. If Otter has to replace the computer and stuff because of me, I don’t know how I’ll ever look at the guys I work with on a daily basis again. They’ve seen my stellar falls and stuff, but this is a whole new level of clumsiness in front of them. One I hate anyone knowing about.

Trenton doesn’t try to talk to me as I close my eyes and try to focus on my breathing. In my mind, if I can control my breathing, I won’t get sick. At least that’s my hope. It doesn’t always work like that though. For now, I’m just going to lay here and see what the club’s doctor has to say. Hopefully Otter will let me stay late in order to make up the time I’m losing right now. I can’t afford to lose any money.



# Chapter 2

Chapter Two

Otter

THIS FUCKING GIRL! I don’t know what the hell is going on with Willow, but the girl can’t go one day without some catastrophe happening to her. She needs to come with a damn warning label or something. With the exception of my mom, I have never met another person in my life who is so damn clumsy. My mom and Willow take that shit to the extreme and I wish there was something I could do to make it better for them. Unfortunately, I can’t. Though, I will say, today is the worst Willow has ever been hurt and I wish I weren’t in my office in order to stop it from happening. Karsyn, Riggs, and I have all gotten used to making sure Willow stays out of trouble as much as we can. One of us is usually close by her as soon as she steps foot in the shop. It’s one of the reasons we also don’t let her go get our meals or anything. I can just see her making a mess of herself on the way back.

Walking into the main room of Inked Up, Karsyn looks at me in a silent question. He wants to make sure Willow’s okay, but can’t just leave his client on the chair in the middle of a tattoo. Shaking my head, I let him know I’m not sure if she’s okay or not. Pulling out my phone, I call Doc. Hopefully she’s not too busy and can get here quickly. Head wounds are always so hard to determine what needs to happen. Not just from the bleeding either. Willow could have given herself a damn concussion or something else.

“Otter, what’s going on?” Doc asks me as she answers her phone.

“Kind of hopin’ you ain’t busy right now. Willow needs to be checked out and I don’t want to take her to the hospital if she doesn’t need to go. She’s got a head injury and I can’t figure out how bad it really is. I know those always bleed the worst, but she could need stitches or other medical help,” I inform her as I make my way to the computer.

“Who’s Willow?” Doc returns, her voice rushed as I hear her moving around in the background.

“She’s the receptionist at Inked Up. Took a header into her computer monitor, hit the desk, and then the floor. Bleedin’ real bad. I cleaned her up and put a clean, wet towel on the wound so she’s not covered in blood again. I don’t know what else to do to make it better or help her. I’ve got her lyin’ down right now in the breakroom. She hasn’t been sick yet, but she’s even paler than normal. Riggs is back there with her right now,” I inform Doc as I try to turn on the computer.

“Okay. That’s good, Otter. Keep an eye on her. I’ll be there in ten or fifteen minutes,” Doc says before hanging up.

Setting my phone on the desk in front of the computer, I try again to turn the computer on. It’s not starting at all. Though, I really shouldn’t be surprised because I can see the cracks in the screen already. Shaking my head, I pick my phone back up and call Goose. He’s gonna lose his shit about this. I just had brand-new computers brought in here.

“What’s up, Otter?” he answers the phone.

“Need a new computer at Inked Up as soon as you can get it here,” I say, waiting for him to yell and lecture me.

“What the fuck happened in the last week since I installed the new ones? Are you guys goin’ on fuckin’ porn sites?” he questions, complete silence in the background with him.

“Had an incident this mornin’. Willow got tripped up and slammed her head into the computer before hittin’ the desk,” I state, knowing he won’t say a word about it to her.

“Is she okay?”

“Got Doc comin’ in to look her over. She’ll be here soon. Don’t wanna take her to the hospital if I don’t have to.”

“Okay. I’ll be there in a few minutes. Let me load this shit up and I’ll get everythin’ taken care of,” Goose states before hanging up the phone.

Bending down, I pick Willow’s bag up and toss everything back inside. I’m surprised she can find a damn thing in here with how much shit she carries on a daily basis. Picking up her phone last, I take a look at it. I know she’s got a piece of shit flip phone, but I didn’t realize how banged up and damaged the damn thing really is. The technology is outdated, the screen is cracked, and most of the numbers on the buttons are worn off. I don’t know how this damn thing still works. It’s a fucking miracle if you ask me.

Once I have all of her things picked up, the desk cleared off so Goose can replace the computer, and clean the edge of the desk off, I make my way back to the breakroom. Trenton is kneeling down next to Willow and a feeling of rage fills me as he smiles down at her. Willow isn’t mine, but part of me believes she is. This fucking girl pulls at every fucking piece of me she can reach and has no clue about it.

Standing back, I allow myself to take a long look at her. Willow’s vibrant red hair is fanned out behind her head like flames covering the black couch beneath her. The curls are all over the place and tangled together. A few pieces of her hair stick to her face from the blood and wet towel. Her eyes are closed showing how long her lashes really are against her pale skin. Freckles litter her skin and I want to find out how far down her body they go and count every single one of them. She’s wearing a black tank top today that does nothing to hide her ample chest. With the way she’s laying, I’m surprised the shirt hasn’t slipped and shown us more of the deep red bra she’s wearing. The long, flowing skirt Willow’s wearing today is a rainbow of colors. It’s fanned out around her legs and goes down to her ankles. I’ve never seen her wear anything that is above her knee, and her tank tops are the closest to form fitting clothing she wears. As always, on her feet are a pair of flip flops. Today’s are black and they show off her red painted nails. Willow always has her nails painted a different color. I swear she changes it on a weekly basis.

Ripping my eyes from Willow, I find Riggs watching me with a smirk on his face. He doesn’t say anything as I stare him down, waiting for a comment or something to leave his mouth. He might be the newest patched member of our club, but he can be a damn smartass. And, I’ve noticed, he’s very protective of Willow. I’m not sure what he feels for her on his end, but if it’s the last thing I do, he won’t be with her. I’m the only man Willow needs in her fucking life. Unfortunately, she’s caught me a time or two with a client here at the shop and I know she won’t give me the time of day. Willow only really speaks to me when she absolutely has to.

“Doc on her way?” Riggs finally asks me.

“She is. Should be here any second,” I tell him as my phone vibrates in my pocket. Pulling it out, I find my mom’s name on the screen. “Hey, Mom. What’s goin’ on?”

“Not much, Axel. How are things down there?” she answers, sounding out of breath.

“They’re good. Waitin’ on Doc to show up for an employee. Why are you out of breath?” I ask, hoping one of my dads aren’t home with her because that’s something I don’t need to think about.

“I was putting up some towels in the salon and well, the chair wasn’t as sturdy as I thought it was. I’m okay,” she rushes out, trying to add some laughter to her voice.

“Are you sure you’re okay? Or are you just sayin’ that shit to make me feel better knowin’ I’m not there?” I question her, knowing my mom has downplayed accidents in the past and really has been hurt.

“Well, I mean, I fell on the dryer so I didn’t hit the floor. That’s a win in my book,” she states and I know she’s more than likely hurt and won’t say anything to anyone. “Why is Doc coming to you? Are you hurt?”

“No. I’m okay. Like I said, it’s for an employee. She got hurt and I want to make sure she doesn’t need to go to the hospital,” I respond as Willow turns on the couch to face me with a glare aimed in my direction. Yeah, she’s got some claws at certain times.

“What happened to Willow?” Mom immediately asks, knowing already all about Willow.

“She got tripped up. Just want to make sure she’s okay. Doc should be here any second. Can I call you back in a little bit?”

“Of course you can. Let me know she’s okay. And, don’t tell you dads about this, Axel. I know you and if one of them show up, I’ll be making a trip to Cedar Bay,” my mom threatens as I tell her I haven’t talked to them yet.

Hanging up the phone, I turn to find Doc walking into the breakroom. She looks at me and turns her attention immediately to Willow on the couch. Doc steps up next to her as Riggs moves the garbage can out of her way.

“Willow, I’m Dr. Tallman. Everyone in the club just calls me Doc. How are you feeling?”

I lean back against the wall and watch everything being done to Willow. She answers Doc’s questions, winces when she examines the wound on her head, and listens to everything being said to her. I can barely hear what Willow’s responses are because her voice is barely above a whisper on a good day. Today, it seems as if her voice is even quieter and I don’t like it. Riggs stands next to me and watches the scene before us.

“I don’t believe you have a concussion or a need to go to the hospital, Willow. You don’t even need stitches. Head wounds always seem so much worse than they actually are. It’s done bleeding now and I will put some ointment on it and a bandage. I want you to change the bandage a few times a day and make sure the ointment goes on as well. It will help prevent any infection from setting in. Don’t get the bandages wet either, Willow. We don’t want this to open up for any reason. You’ll have a headache for a few days. If it becomes unbearable, I want you to go to the hospital immediately. Don’t wait or make excuses not to go,” Doc states, already knowing Willow more than likely won’t get medical help if she needs it.

“Thank you, Dr. Tallman. I told Otter he didn’t need to bring you down here for this,” Willow complains as Doc puts the ointment and bandage on her head.

“He did the right thing. So much can go wrong with a head injury and there’s no reason to take unnecessary risks or chances. So, if the headache becomes unbearable, don’t wait to go to the hospital,” Doc warns Willow in a stern voice she rarely uses.

Willow carefully nods her head and asks if she can still work today. What the fuck? She still wants to work after slamming her head off a damn computer and the desk. This woman is going to be the death of me! Doc lets her know she can work, but if her headache gets worse, she’s to go get some rest and not push herself for the next few days. Willow won’t be pushing herself for any reason if I have a say in the matter.

Doc leaves after I let her know I’ll make sure the funds get transferred to her as always. Riggs stays with Willow while I make my way out to see if Goose is here yet. Walking back out on the main floor, I find him already in Willow’s seat and setting up the new computer. He’s already taken care of the old one and I don’t even see it around anymore. The man works fast as hell and knows what he’s doing.

“Goose. Thanks for comin’ down so quick,” I greet him as I lean against the desk at his side.

“Can’t have you fallin’ behind on work because you can’t access anythin’. This will be ready to go in a few minutes. It already has all the software and shit you guys use here installed. I have a few more sittin’ at the clubhouse from the new setup. They’re all ready to go if you ever wanna expand the shop,” he informs me, not taking his eyes off what he’s doing.

“That’s good to know. I don’t believe I’ll be expandin’ anytime soon, but it’s always possible. You never know what the future holds,” I say, looking at Karsyn as he finishes up the tattoo he’s been working on.

“How’s Willow doin’?”

“She’s okay. Probably have a headache for the next few days and can’t push herself. Didn’t need stitches either. Got some ointment on it and Doc put a bandage on the spot on her head. She’s gotta change it out a few times a day,” I answer him, wanting to be back there with her instead of out here.

“That’s good to hear. I’ll take care of sendin’ over Doc’s payment as soon as I’m done here.”

Nodding my head, I make my way back to the breakroom. Goose doesn’t need any help and I’ll only be in his way if I stay with him. Karsyn is ready to cash his client out and then I’m sure he’ll be back here to check on Willow for himself. We all kind of have a soft spot for her. It bothers me, but there’s not anything I can do about them talking to her or checking on her when they know something is wrong. Hell, out of all of us, I’m keeping the biggest secrets from her and I don’t know how she’ll feel once she finds out the truth. Something we as a club should have told her when it happened. Plus, there’s the whole wanting her as mine thing she doesn’t know about. I try not to let anyone know, but I’m sure I’m failing at that as well.

I keep thinking about how she was so affectionate and so loveable; how she did certain things that nobody would believe if I had told them. She was such a special girl.  She lived a short life, but I'm trying to find solace in the fact that she indeed was a very, very happy girl.  It's just so unfair.

1ls1v9h,https://www.reddit.com/r/PVCs/comments/1ls1v9h/my_pvc_experience/,My PVC Experience,"Hey everyone, I'm quite new to Reddit but came across this thread a few months ago when researching answers for myself!

I'm a 27 year old doctor and began spontaneously suffering with severe PVCs seemingly out of nowhere about 2 months ago. This post is just my personal experience and not medical advice but hopefully can help someone and maybe give people some confidence on how to advocate for themself.

One day I woke up from a nap and there they were. About every 3-4 normal heart beats I'd get a massive pounding PVC radiating up into my neck. Initially I tried to ignore it and put it down to dehydration or poor sleep etc because I never find the time to drink enough water and do lots of night shifts etc. However, the following day the intensity had ramped up so much I was actually struggling to keep calm and my anxiety was through the roof.

I borrowed my friend's Apple watch and did an ECG on myself to see if I could confirm my PVC suspicion and there it was. Given the severity and sudden onset of the symptoms I went straight to ED for a proper ECG and some baseline bloods (mainly to check my electrolytes).

In my own practice, I genuinely do try really hard to do the best for my patients. I'm still relatively junior in my practice but finding solutions for people is a rewarding thing in life. However, with the best will in the world, it's not always easy or possible. To be on the other side of things for once felt shit. The ECG confirmed I had PVCs, I was on telemetry for a few hours and my bloods 'were fine' so I was sent home with a plan for ECHO and Holter. More waiting.

I recently moved from Scotland to Australia and was really impressed at getting my ECHO and 24hr Holter within a week. Thankfully for me my ECHO showed that structurally things were fine, but the PVC burden was 14% on holter.

I'm still awaiting a cardiology appointment as I write this, and because of the daily symptoms I needed to at least try and find a solution - it was ruining my life. A few days prior to my symptoms I had set a 5km PB and was frequently working out in the gym too. I was probably the healthiest I had ever been. I still did occasionally drink alcohol a bit too much at once (maybe monthly) but way less than as a student/living in Scotland. I also did smoke cannabis maybe twice monthly with friends to just less loose and laugh off some work stress (doctors are humans too!). Otherwise I was pretty close to perfect.

Unfortunately PVCs are not something many doctors know much about except cardiologists and even then, from my experience, medications such as beta blockers or verapamil are used to manage symptoms. I'm not saying this is the wrong decision (each case is different) but the thought of being on either of these options as a healthy young active guy is not something I'd like to go ahead with unless there was no other option and certainly not before doing everything I could to exclude an underlying cause.

Over the last few weeks I have researched extensively what could be causing this for me and ways to try and minimise my symptoms. Now whether this would have happened anyway or not, I honestly cannot say, but I slowly noticed a reduction in PVC intensity. Then, a few weeks later, a reduction in frequency. I still get multiple PVCs an hour - probably 100-200 but it's a vast improvement from >14000 daily.

I thought I'd share some things I've learned or tried which might be helpful to others. Again, not medical advice but relatively harmless interventions to try or things to discuss with a doctor:

1. Structural heart disease

\- A common cause of PVCs, usually more common in older people or those with pre-existing cardiac disease (e.g failure, valvular pathology, scarring). It needs to be excluded with frequent PVCs. Advocate for an ECHO.

2. Holter monitoring

\- For at least 24 hours is essential! Longer if your symptoms are more intermittent or less frequent. This quantifies the burden. Mine was 14%. Typically >10-15% is considered possibly concerning longer term as a persistent high burden can cause PVC induced cardiomyopathy over time

3. Blood tests

\- Won't find a cause for everyone but are an essential part of the workup.

\- Make sure to check your electrolytes/kidney function. Most important electrolytes are magnesium and potassium. Cardiologists like a magnesium and potassium within the normal range but over 0.9 and 4.0mmol/L respectively. If below maybe ask your doctor about ways to optimise suitable for you.

\- A full blood count to check haemoglobin (could you be anaemic?) and white cell/lymphocyte count (could you have an infection?) are also essential.

\- Thyroid function tests are also worth consideration to exclude hyperthyroidism.

\- If your symptoms are sudden onset and you have chest pain (you should be in the ED for immediate workup) but a troponin test (usually used to rule out heart attack) should perhaps also be considered for things like myocarditis/pericarditis (most common in younger people and may set off PVCs). I never had a troponin done and kind of wish I had advocated for one - It is a controversial test to do without chest pain or if not suspicious of heart attack but it can be useful if suspecting myocarditis since there isn't really a quick process to pick up more minor or atypical (lack of chest pain) cases. Cardiac MRI is the gold standard for myocarditis but good luck getting one of those quickly or with symptoms of uncertain aetiology e.g PVCs.

4. Supplements.

\- I supplement with 450mg magnesium glycinate daily and 144mg Magnesium L-threonate nightly. There are lots of types of magnesium. I think this is a harmless intervention in the vast majority of cases and can be very helpful if your magnesium is low or sub-optimal.

\- For my potassium I tried to increase potassium rich foods in my diet and also drink sugar free gatorade in the early days. I wouldn't recommend much more than that, especially if you have kidney disease you need to be more careful with potassium.

\- I also take 3g taurine daily - there are a few small studies suggesting taurine can reduce PVC frequency and the doses in these studies are even up to 12g daily. I never went this high with doses and probably won't because I don't know enough about the impact of such high doses over time - the evidence is also low quality by scientific standards. Some people also combine with L-carnitine but I haven't tried that.

\- I have also added an omega 3 supplement (with good DHA:EPA ratio, for cardiac function. Controversial and not great evidence but I'm trying anyway), vitamin D 4000IU (possible immune system benefit), Co-Q10 (possible cardiac benefit), slippery elm (gastric lining protection), Longvida curcumin (anti-inflammatory), zinc (possible immune benefit/anti-viral. Long term/very high dose use discouraged)

5. What about gastritis?

\- For me I developed significant gastritis symptoms (without reflux) when living in Australia. I'm unsure why as I naturally cut back on alcohol with the change in culture and was otherwise healthy

\- Roemheld syndrome is a poorly defined diagnosis but essentially describes the presence of cardiac disease secondary to gastric disease. Often symptoms get worse with positional changes e.g. lying on side or after eating. I first noticed my symptoms got better with fasting leading me to research this. Dr Sanjay Gupta is a British cardiologist who has some good videos on Youtube covering this.

\- I had endoscopically proven erosive gastritis and think this may have been my trigger

\- I treat aggressively with PPI + H2 blocker (hopefully short term - that'a a whole other discussion) to lower stomach acid and promote healing. I think this maybe helped me. I also use slippery elm supplement with meals - there is some evidence this can help protect the gastric mucosa

6. Could it be viral/infection/inflammatory?

\- I think this is also likely for me. My initial bloods showed a neutropenia and low lymphocyte count which is usually associated with viral infections if transient

\- Flares of autoimmune conditions could also be related to PVCs in susceptible people and managing the underlying condition optimally is key

7.  Sleep/Could you have sleep apnoea?

\- CONSISTENT sleep and avoiding night shifts is essential to trial. Sleep is an under appreciated 'treatment' for so many things. My PVCs got worse after nights and now I've transitioned off them I'm a little better. Coincidence? Possibly, but it can't have worsened things.

\- Sleep apnoea can cause PVCs but usually worse at night if waking up or in the morning. It would be less common to have constantly throughout the day for this to be the trigger.

\- I am considering a sleep study test. I wear a Garmin watch which suggests my SPO2 dips to 80% at night. I know these things are inaccurate but I have a family history, neck circumference >40cm and I'm male so there are a few risk factors for me. Check your STOP-BANG score if you think this might be relevant for you

8. Are you stressed/increased adrenergic tone

\- I was stressed daily. I work in an emergency department and trying to constantly do your best for people, juggling multiple patients at once, battling system inefficiencies, missing meal breaks etc etc. I'd come home and sleep and just re-live my entire shift again in my dreams. I don't think this was my trigger (as this is not new for me) but it could have contributed. I've tried putting less pressure on myself, deep breathing etc. I'm a bit of a perfectionist so it's hard sometimes

\- Other causes of increased adrenergic tone could be illness (possibly viral), anxiety, stimulant use (caffeine, alcohol, illicit drugs), beta agonist (e.g. ventolin) overuse.

\- I cut caffeine, alcohol and cannabis use entirely but for me I do not think these were my triggers directly but perhaps any alcohol or coffee wasn't helping my gastritis

\- I do not recommend jumping straight into a cold plunge especially if known heart disease or pre-ECHO! However a gentle build up to cold exposure I feel has helped me a little bit. You can even try in the shower by turning it down bit by bit. It's not a magic bullet and there are no large scale studies but some promising early or small research is out there. I like Susanna Soeberg and think she makes some good points

\- Magnesium can also help you to feel more calm and sleep well. It helps melatonin release from the brain. Magnesium L-threonate is the best type for crossing the blood brain barrier and is what I use.

9. Rest

\- I took a week off work and feel this is where I started to notice subtle improvements

\- Prior to PVCs I was trying to build muscle  and lose fat. I was putting a lot of pressure on my body and just taking it chill, perhaps even in a slight calorie surplus helped me a bit I think

10. Hydration

\- Any level of dehydration is irritating to the heart. Aim for 2-3L of water daily. Sometimes I will go for a gatorade (sugar free) now and then as well (I know this isn't 'healthy' but it helps me get to my hydration target). Don't overdo the water much past 3L unless working outside and sweating etc because you don't want to dilute your electrolytes (especially sodium) too far

11. Medications

\- Have you started a new medication recently? Worth checking with your doctor if you think it could be related. Some drugs are more likely than others

12. Genetics

\- Do you have a rare genetic structural issue or rare channelopathy? Cardiology input would be needed to risk assess your personal case and investigate further if needed

\- For me, I have no family history

13. Hormonal causes

\- More relevant for females, but perhaps hormonal fluctuations could contribute. It's worth correlating symptoms with your cycle to assess if things change with time. However, it would be unusual to just get PVCs as the only symptom. Any concerns should be discussed with your doctor and perhaps they can help investigate things more if there are concerns of this. As long as other tests are being done too this is not an unreasonable direction for investigation

14. Diet

\- There is no specific dietary cause of PVCs I know of but there may be things causing systemic irritation

\- Avoid trigger foods if you're lactose intolerant, gluten sensitive, have IBS/IBD, histamine intolerant, have gastritis etc etc

\- A healthy diet is essential. If you're unwell in ANY way, don't fuel yourself with crap. Optimise what you can control

To complete this long post, I'd like to say that whilst many things are labelled 'idiopathic' (no known cause) in medicine, I believe everything has a cause - we sometimes just fail to identify it. Sometimes it isn't possible - we don't know everything. Having suffered from PVCs for a while now and hopefully in the recovery phase I wanted to share what I've learned so hopefully less of you guys end up idiopathic and maybe can get some ideas about how to rule some easy things out!",9,1751691226.0,PVCs,10,1.0,False

""I'm warning you one last time—keep your mouth shut when you leave. Whatever happened in the past three years, bury it and forget it, got it? Don't think being the daughter of duke's estate means someone's going to back you up!""

""There never was anyone before, and there sure won't be in the future."" Athena Monson's face was expressionless, her voice hollow. She nodded meekly, not daring to defy the steward.

Leaning against the wall for support, she slowly made her way out of the camp.

She had once lit up Pidence City with her dazzling dance. Now her knees, ruined from years of injury, could barely hold her weight. Without medicine, even her skill in healing was useless.

Just outside the camp, she heard someone call her name. Flinching, she lifted her head hesitantly.

What met her eyes was a majestic steed, a royal gift, and astride it sat the Marquis of Somers—Michael Osborne. The famed war god himself.

He sat tall and poised, broad shoulders tapering to a lean waist, his face strikingly handsome. He still carried that same air of noble elegance.

This was the man she had loved for three long years. She had seen this scene in her dreams countless times—him finally coming to take her home.

Her eyes filled with tears, and she opened her mouth to speak, but no words came.

Because it was him—he was the one who had thrown her into this hellish camp, ordering others to ""teach her a lesson.""

The cold indifference in his eyes made her already shattered heart tremble again.

""I can take you home,"" Michael said, looking down at her from his horse, eyes like ice, his tone as sharp as a blade. ""But tell me—do you finally admit you were wrong?

""If you hadn't poisoned the pastries back then, Willow wouldn't be living with a chronic illness. She still needs daily medicine. You only suffered three years of punishment—she'll suffer for the rest of her life. You owe her forever!""

When Athena remained silent, Michael snapped, ""Answer me! Do you admit your guilt?""

The sudden sharpness in his voice made her jump. Reflexively, she shut her eyes, wrapped her arms around her head, and crouched down, crying out, ""I admit it! I was wrong! I'll never do it again!""

But the lash she expected never came. Only then did she remember—he was the Marquis of Somers. A man like him would never lower himself to beat someone like her.

Still, she truly had been wrong. She was wrong to care. Wrong to love. Wrong to give her heart to people who treated it like nothing.

When she'd first been thrown into the camp, she still clung to a shred of hope.

She had thought, 'My fiancé can't really be that heartless. He has protected me since our engagement—risking his life, even, to spare me from harm.

'And my parents in the duke's estate—surely, they would come for me. I have been framed.'

But she waited. And waited. And what came instead was nothing but torment—merciless, day after day, at the hands of the soldiers.

She was a noblewoman, not a camp whore. They didn't dare touch her, which only made them more creative in how they broke her.

Sometimes, they beat her with slender whips made specifically for disciplining women—tools that cut deep and left her flesh in tatters. Other times, they stripped her naked and tossed her into the snow.

They were waiting for her to beg. To give in. To offer her body in exchange for a bite of food or a few days of peace.

But she never did. So their torment grew nastier, more degrading, every time.

Eventually, she stopped fighting back—not out of obedience, but because she no longer had the strength to resist.

""Athena, what game are you playing now?"" Michael frowned, his tone sharp with disdain.

He wondered, 'Three years of discipline, and she's ended up this pathetic?'

The once-glowing beauty of her face was gone—now it was sickly pale and hollow. Her waist, once soft and full, had thinned so much it looked like it might snap under a strong breeze.

He thought, 'Trying to act pitiful? I am not falling for it. I personally ordered my men to take good care of her. There is no way she's truly been mistreated.'

Turning away, Michael dismounted. He reached out a hand toward her. ""Get in the carriage.""

But she recoiled like a wounded animal, clutching her head, eyes blank, voice trembling as she pleaded, ""No… please don't… don't touch me…""

""That's enough,"" he snapped. ""Still pretending to be pitiful?""

His voice turned colder. ""What, is this your way of making me feel guilty?""

Athena slowly came back to herself. Her voice was dry, hoarse. She gave a hollow laugh, laced with self-mockery.

In front of Michael—or her parents—she had never once had the right to feel wronged.

If they'd ever truly felt guilty, they wouldn't have waited until now.

Thirteen years ago, her birth parents finally brought her home to the duke's estate. That was when she found out the truth—she'd been swapped at birth.

The greedy couple who raised her had traded her away and left her to suffer five bitter years.

She'd thought that returning to her real family meant love and acceptance. But what she got instead was coldness.

Her parents and brothers barely looked at her.

Whenever Willow Monson—the girl who'd lived her life—felt sad or neglected, they rushed to comfort her, as if she were the real daughter.

Little by little, Athena was pushed aside.

They constantly reminded her, ""You're the older sister. You should be the mature one. Be patient with Willow. Don't fight. Don't compete.""

Wanting so desperately to belong, Athena did as she was told. She gave way in everything, always stepping aside for Willow.

Three years ago, she even made pastries by hand to try to please her.

But Willow ended up poisoned—vomiting blood.

Their parents were furious. They said Athena's years away had corrupted her to the bone. Said she wasn't worthy of being their daughter.

Egged on by Willow's whispers, they decided to send her away—banished from Pidence City forever.

Even the brothers who once adored her said, ""Willow might've enjoyed your life for over a decade, but she's innocent. How could you use such cruel tactics just to win attention? We don't have a sister as heartless as you!""

No matter how Athena tried to explain, no one believed her. Not once.

The moment Willow shed a tear, the blame fell on Athena.

In the end, it was Michael who stepped in to stop them from sending her away.

But he didn't save her. He simply had her quietly dumped in the military camp—believing that after enough suffering, she'd finally learn her place.

A gust of wind lifted the tangled strands of Athena's hair, revealing her emaciated, unrecognizable face.

Michael scowled. ""Get up. We're going back to the estate.""

Athena tried, but her legs gave out beneath her, and she crumpled to the ground again.

Michael turned back, his eyes flashing cold steel. ""If you'd rather not go back… then drag yourself back into that camp.""

Chapter 2 Realize Your Mistake?

Athena lowered her gaze, gritted her teeth, and forced herself to stand. She didn't say a word as she clumsily climbed into the carriage, using both hands and knees.

Her legs throbbed with pain, barely able to hold her, and she looked completely wretched.

Michael turned away, refusing to watch. He had assumed three years of punishment would be enough to wear down her spirit, but the moment they met again, she was already trying to play the victim—putting on a show to win his sympathy.

If it hadn't been for that person's orders, he wouldn't have come for her at all.

What baffled him was why someone of such high rank would even notice Athena—let alone give an order about her the moment he returned to Pidence City.

Michael was the first to get out of the carriage. Without a glance back, he instructed his men, ""I have business back at camp. After you drop her off, get rid of the carriage—I don't want to see it again. It's filthy.""

Filthy. The word hit her like a slap. Athena's chest ached with a dull, sinking pain. She sniffed quietly, face devoid of emotion, and stepped down from the carriage.

Outside the towering red gates of the duke's estate, a woman was already waiting. The moment she saw Athena, she rushed over, eyes full of urgency.

But the first thing she said was, ""My sweet daughter, it's been three years. Have you finally realized your mistake?""

""I have,"" Athena replied flatly.

Her mistake had been wanting love too much. This time, she would sever those ties—for good. Just… not yet. Not while Margaret Monson, her grandmother, still needed her care.

Eloise Monson looked at Athena, her daughter—so thin and pale, her eyes distant—and her expression faltered.

Three years of hardship had changed Athena completely. Just one look was enough to make her heart ache.

No matter how deeply Athena had erred, she was still her daughter—still her flesh and blood. And she had clearly paid the price.

""It's good you understand now,"" Eloise said softly. ""You mustn't be so willful again. Come on, get up."" She reached out to help.

But Athena immediately stood up on her own and took a step back, putting distance between them. Her eyes were guarded, cautious.

Eloise's heart twisted. ""You blame me for being too harsh? But I did it for your own good—for your future! What mother doesn't want the best for her child?""

Her eyes turned red, her voice trembling with a hint of tears. ""Don't hold it against me…""

Her face was full of sorrow, as though she were the one who'd suffered for three years.

Athena stood there, unmoved, making no effort to bridge the gap between them.

Just then, a slender figure stepped gracefully out of the manor and gently supported Eloise's arm.

""Mother, Athena's just come home. She's probably overwhelmed. Don't be upset if she seems distant—give her a little time, all right?""

The girl was delicate and fair, with porcelain skin and a sweet, innocent smile.

She turned to Athena and extended her hand, her eyes wide with sincerity. ""Athena, I don't hold anything against you. Let's forget the past, okay? We're still family—we should love each other, just like before.""

Her smile was as gentle and harmless as ever.

Athena almost laughed out loud. After everything she'd endured, she wondered, 'Do they really think a few nice words can just wipe it all away?'

""Love? Between you and me?"" Disgust flickered in her eyes.

That was when someone finally lost patience.

""Willow's already gone out of her way to be kind to you, and you're still acting like this? What's wrong with your attitude?""

Nicolas Monson had just come from court, still in his crimson official robes. He swung off his horse and walked over, clearly irritated.

""You think you're the only one who's suffered these past three years? Do you have any idea what Mother's been through? She's lost sleep night after night, her hair's turning white!

""If it weren't for Willow taking care of her and fulfilling your duties, who knows what would've happened?""

Nicolas had seen the whole scene earlier—Eloise's joy quickly deflated, Willow's soft voice met with Athena's cold rejection.

Nicolas thought, 'And all because of three years of punishment? What right does she have to act wronged? Willow almost died.'

Eloise frowned at Nicolas, her son, clearly disapproving. ""Don't exaggerate. She just got back. As her big brother, you should be gentler with her. Don't scare her.""

""Mother, you don't need to defend her. The Monson family owes her nothing. She's the one who made the mistake. And because of her, our entire household's reputation suffered.

""Everyone in Pidence City knows the Duke's family raised a vicious, manipulative girl. And Willow? She never complained—she's done everything she could to protect this family.""

Nicolas still hadn't calmed down.

""Athena! Willow even covered for you—she told everyone you never poisoned her, just to protect your name. Shouldn't you be grateful?"" he continued.

When Athena said nothing, his voice rose sharply. ""Say something! Are you mute now?""

Athena blinked, struggling to hold back the sting in her eyes.

Once upon a time, Nicolas had been different. Unlike her second and third brothers, he had been the one who truly cared for her.

He once told her he'd split the love he gave Willow and give half to her—and for a while, he meant it.

When the servants looked down on her, he gave out thirty lashes on her behalf. On her birthday, he carved a jewel pendant for her by hand. When she was sick, he stayed by her side through the night.

But all that kindness vanished the moment Willow acted hurt.

Love that could be so easily withdrawn—that kind of love, she no longer wanted.

The air between them turned stiff with silence.

Eloise quickly stepped in to smooth things over. ""What's done is done. Let's go inside—your father and grandmother are still waiting.""

Nicolas scoffed and gave a dismissive wave of his sleeve as he turned toward the estate.

After a few steps, he looked back, his voice suddenly soft. ""Willow, come here.""

""Yes, Nicolas."" She smiled sweetly, casting a glance at Athena. She said nothing—but somehow, it said everything.

Athena was used to it by now. She had always been the outsider in this family.

She had already made up her mind: she would let go. Let Willow have all of it—Michael, her parents, her brothers.

But even with that resolve, watching this unfold still made her throat tighten and her eyes sting.

Chapter 3 Oversized Clothes

Eloise led Athena through the gates of the estate, turning to the servants as they entered. ""Take Lady Athena to wash up first. After that, she'll go pay her respects to Lady Margaret.""

Then she looked at Athena with a gentle smile. ""Your grandmother's getting on in years. Her health hasn't been great—she's been relying on herbal tonics these past few years. When you see her, be sweet and respectful, and don't bring up anything about the last three years. It'll only upset her.""

Athena nodded quietly.

Margaret had always been the most fair-minded person in the family—but she was too old now to involve herself in household affairs.

Seeing Athena accept her words without protest, Eloise finally relaxed a little.

She continued, testing the waters, ""You're eighteen now—of marriageable age. What happened in the camp... let's not mention it again. If word gets out that you spent the last three years living among soldiers, day and night, people will start talking.

""That kind of gossip could ruin your chances of a good match. I've already come up with an explanation. We'll say you were away recuperating, and now you've just returned.""

Athena's face remained calm. She gave a soft ""Yes,"" then followed the maid assigned to her.

But after a few turns, she realized something was wrong. This wasn't the way to her old courtyard.

She asked, and the maid smiled brightly as she explained, ""Lady Willow has been in poor health for years. The doctor said the trees in your courtyard were too damp and affected her health. So they were all cut down.

""To help her recover, they leveled your courtyard and merged it with hers. They even diverted hot spring water to the new space for her treatment. But don't worry, Lady Eloise had this new courtyard cleaned and prepared for you before your return.""

The maid said it as if it were completely normal, perfectly reasonable.

As if everyone had conveniently forgotten that Athena was the true daughter of the house—while Willow was merely adopted.

The maid led Athena to a small, modest courtyard and pushed the door open. ""You'll be staying here from now on, Lady Athena.""

The space was much smaller than her original quarters, and with no greenery in sight, it looked bare and lifeless.

Two unfamiliar maids stepped forward and bowed. ""Lady Athena.""

Athena didn't recognize either of them. After three years away, most of the household staff had changed.

One had a round face, the other an oval one. Both were attractive and sharp-eyed—clearly selected for looks and cleverness.

""I'm Siena Hotham.""

""I'm Aliza Crofton.""

Together, they echoed, ""Hi, Lady Athena.""

Athena gave a small nod and motioned for them to rise.

Then she asked, ""Where are Thalia and Macy?""

Those had been her personal maids before she was sent away. But once she entered the military camp, all news of them vanished.

The maid smiled and replied, ""Not long after you left, they both got married. I imagine they're living quiet, peaceful lives now—looking after their husbands and raising children.""

Athena nodded. A peaceful life sounded good. Far better than serving others for the rest of your days.

The thought brought a faint sense of ease. She stepped inside.

The table was already set. The meal was generous—four dishes and a soup—but the plates were no bigger than a clenched fist.

She began to eat. One plate of pasta disappeared in just a few bites.

Her brows knit slightly. ""Is there more?""

Siena looked momentarily stunned, then quickly nodded. ""Yes, of course, I'll get it right away.""

Watching her eat so fast, Aliza spoke up gently, ""Lady Athena, please slow down. You'll upset your stomach if you rush like that.""

Athena's fork paused in mid-air. She had nearly forgotten—this wasn't the military camp anymore.

This was the duke's estate. No one here was going to snatch her food. No one would dump kitchen slop onto her plate.

The pasta was fragrant. The dishes were fresh. And the meat—it was real bacon. Not rat. Not snake.

Siena returned with two more plates of pasta.

Athena ate quickly and without grace. There was nothing delicate or refined in her manners—she looked more like a starving beggar than a noble daughter.

Siena opened her mouth several times to speak but held her tongue each time.

After the meal, the servants had already prepared hot water for her bath. Siena and Aliza followed her in. ""Lady Athena, allow us to help you bathe,"" Siena offered politely.

""That won't be necessary. You can leave."" Athena said.

Siena hesitated, clearly unsure.

Aliza added with concern, ""If Lady Eloise finds out, she'll punish us for not serving you properly…""

Athena didn't speak. She simply looked at them—calm, expressionless.

There was no anger in her eyes, no emotion at all. But the chill behind that blank gaze made both girls shiver.

Without another word, they backed out of the room and quietly closed the door behind them.

Only then did Athena step behind the screen and begin undressing.

Her body was gaunt, skin stretched tightly over bone. Her once-fair skin was now covered in bruises—some new, others long faded.

If she hadn't known medicine, she would have died in that place.

After washing, she reached for the fresh clothes laid out on the rack. The fabric was fine—soft, warm, and tailored to fit.

But on her starved frame, the robe hung loose and shapeless, making her look more like a walking skeleton than a noble daughter.

""Lady Athena, Lady Eloise and the Lady Margaret are waiting,"" Aliza reminded her from outside.

Athena nodded and made her way toward Starling House.

In just three years, the duke's estate had changed so much.

She paused at the edge of the pond, lost in thought. ""What happened to the lotuses?"" she asked.

""Lady Willow said there were too many mosquitoes in summer,"" Aliza replied. ""So Lord Nicolas had them all removed.""

Athena thought, 'Of course. Willow—again.' Athena felt a familiar ache in her chest.

When she had first arrived at the estate, she tried so hard to win everyone over.

She had planted those lotuses herself, hoping to make wine from the blossoms and gift it to Nicolas.

He had laughed at her back then. ""You're my sister. There's no need for all that. But if it makes you happy, I'll help you plant them.""

The proud, aloof heir of the house had actually gotten his hands dirty—for her.

At the time, Athena had thought, 'So this is what it feels like to be cherished.'

But now… it was clear. Whatever kindness they'd shown her didn't come close to how they treated Willow. Not even a tenth of it.

She arrived at Margaret's quarters. The room was already full.

Eloise looked toward the door—and frowned. She wondered, 'Why does the robe look so oversized on Athena?'

Chapter 4 The One To Blame

Before Athena could say a word, Nicolas stepped forward, blocking Margaret's view.

""Athena! Are you doing this on purpose?"" he snapped. ""Three years weren't enough to teach you some manners? Still playing your little games? You've really let me down!""

""I told you to present yourself properly. What are you wearing?"" His expression was full of disapproval, his tone unconsciously laced with the stern authority of a Justice Ministry official.

He looked at her like she was standing trial. ""If you've got complaints, direct them at me. Why come here and put on a show in front of Grandmother? Are you trying to make her feel sorry for you? Do you want to upset her so badly she falls ill?""

Athena almost laughed out loud.

She raised an eyebrow, her smile cool and detached. ""The clothes? Lady Eloise picked them out. What did you expect me to wear—what I came back in from the military camp?""

That shut him up. For a moment, Nicolas was at a loss. She had called Eloise ""Lady Eloise""—not ""Mother.""

Only then did it hit him: ever since Athena returned, she hadn't regarded him as brother once either.

A flicker of unease crept into his chest. The harsh words caught in his throat and never made it out.

His gaze narrowed, a thought nagging at the back of his mind. 'It's only been three years… how did she waste away like this?'

Eloise quickly stepped in to smooth things over. ""That was my oversight. Don't be too hard on Athena.""

Nicolas stepped aside, allowing Athena to enter.

Margaret's eyes lit up the moment she saw her.

""Come here, come,"" she called, voice trembling slightly. ""Let me take a good look at you.""

That warmth, that longing in her eyes—Athena felt her nose sting. She stepped forward and let Margaret take her hands and look her over from head to toe.

""How did you get so thin?"" Margaret pulled her into a hug, holding her tightly, voice choked with emotion. ""My sweet girl… you've suffered. It's all my fault. I'm too old, too useless… I couldn't protect you…""

Athena knew how things had gone. Back then, Margaret had stood by her, even if it meant alienating the rest of the family. Her health had already been fragile.

The fact she'd made it through these years at all was a miracle. If not for the empire's strict laws, no one knew what would've happened…

She wrapped her arms around Margaret, and whispered through a tight throat, ""Grandmother.""

Just one word—and Margaret broke down completely, tears streaming down her face.

Off to the side, Eloise watched the reunion, a pang of bitterness tightening in her chest.

Athena had been home for some time now… and still hadn't called her ""Mother.""

She dabbed at her eyes with a silk handkerchief, playing the part of the grieving parent.

Willow stepped up, gently hugging her. ""Don't be sad, Mother. Athena's home now."" Her voice was soft, comforting, obedient.

Eloise looked down at her beloved Willow and felt deeply comforted.

She nodded, eyes still wet, but a faint smile tugging at her lips. She thought, 'At least Willow understands.'

But just as she started to feel at ease, that smile froze.

Margaret's voice, quivering and confused, rang out, ""What's going on?""

Athena's once delicate fingers were now covered in scars—blackened bruises and jagged welts. When she lifted her sleeve, old knife wounds and fresh burns marred the skin along her arms.

Margaret's gaze faltered. She couldn't bear to look any longer. ""She was sent to do labor… how did she end up like this?""

Eloise looked genuinely shocked. ""These injuries—how did they happen?""

Surrounded by concerned faces, Athena buried the emptiness in her eyes and replied softly, ""They came from the overseers at the camp, of course…""

Gasps rippled through the room. Athena's lips curled into a faint, mocking smile. ""I was there to work, not to be treated like a young lady. Getting beaten was just part of the routine.""

She didn't say more. Even recalling it made her stomach turn.

But her few words had already shaken everyone to the core. They thought, 'Beaten—for three full years. How has she even survived?'

Margaret's hands trembled as she clutched Athena's. ""How could they? How dare they? You're the duke's daughter! That camp was under your fiancé's command—how could anyone there lay a finger on you?""

Athena's smile grew, cold and biting. ""Because someone gave the order.""

Nicolas's face turned red with fury. ""You really are useless. You let them beat you like that and didn't even fight back?""

Athena's voice stayed flat, almost detached. ""Do you think a place like that gave me the right to speak, let alone resist? Being quiet and obedient meant fewer beatings. That's the reality.""

She looked directly at him, that faint smile still on her lips. ""Isn't that what you wanted, Lord Nicolas? For me to behave? To finally be 'taught a lesson'? Well, I've learned it. I'm quiet now. Isn't that what makes you happy?""

Nicolas stared at her in silence.

She was smiling, yes—but it never reached her eyes. She hadn't said a single word of accusation, yet the guilt hit him like a knife to the chest.

His expression began to soften, just as he opened his mouth to speak—when Willow's voice suddenly broke in.

""This is all my fault. I'm the one who should be blamed. If my body weren't so weak—if I hadn't reacted badly to the medicine—Athena never would've been punished.

""I was never meant to belong to this family anyway. Maybe… maybe I should go live in the countryside with my birth parents…""

She dissolved into sobs, her voice quivering with each breath. Tears streamed freely down her face, as if she were the one who had suffered.

Immediately, Eloise rushed to her side, flustered, gently stroking her back. ""There, don't cry, darling. You'll make yourself sick.""

Nicolas jumped in too, alarmed. ""You know how fragile your health is—what are you doing, crying like this? If I'd known, I never would've let you come. Now look what's happened.""

Then he turned, casting a sharp look at Athena. As if to say, ""Why do you have to show those wounds? Now Grandmother is heartbroken, Willow is in tears, and Mother is riddled with guilt.""

Before long, everyone in the room was fussing over Willow—offering her coffee, passing her medicine, soothing her with kind words.

And Athena? She stood there alone, forgotten, as if she were nothing more than a bystander.

But of course… she wasn't a bystander. She was the cause. The reason for their guilt, their worry, their pain. The one to blame.

Chapter 5 Should Leave You There

Just then, the Duke of Suffield—Henry Monson—walked into the room.

His commanding gaze swept over everyone before lingering for a moment on Athena. Then, turning to Margaret, he bowed respectfully. ""Mother.""

Margaret quickly waved him up. ""No need for that, get up.""

After he rose, Nicolas and Willow both greeted him warmly. ""Father.""

Only Athena, calm and detached, said, ""Duke of Suffield.""

That one phrase froze the air in the room.

Henry frowned, as if he hadn't heard her right. ""What did you call me?""

A hint of anger crept into his expression.

Athena lowered her eyes and repeated softly, ""Duke of Suffield.""

Smack! The sound of the slap echoed through the hall as Athena's head snapped to the side.

""You ungrateful thing. Three years in the camp, and you still haven't learned a single ounce of humility?"" he roared.

He continued, ""Calling me 'Duke of Suffield'—what, you trying to cut ties with the family? If you still don't know your place, go back to the military camp and stay there! We don't need a disgrace like you in this household!""

Eloise rushed forward, throwing her arms around Athena protectively. ""Enough! If you have to hit someone, then hit me!""

Margaret rose to her feet, trembling with fury, and lifted her cane to strike Henry.

Tears streamed down her face as she shouted, ""Do you have any idea what she's been through these past three years? And now, right in front of me, you hit her? You might as well be hitting me!""

She had only just started to mend Athena's wounded heart. And now, with a single slap, he'd torn it wide open again. He was her father. Her biological father.

Margaret tried to fight for her—but her cane never landed. The moment she raised it, servants rushed in and stopped her. She didn't even touch his robes.

Athena stood silently off to the side, watching the chaos unfold, her expression cold and unreadable.

She thought, 'So this is the family that promises never to hurt me again. How absurd.'

Eloise turned in a panic to check Athena's face—but before she could, a sudden cry rang out. It was Willow.

Everyone turned. A thin trail of blood was trickling from her temple.

The room fell dead silent.

Henry's face twisted in alarm as he called out, ""Quick! Call the physician!""

Nicolas's eyes were red, his brows deeply furrowed. He looked like he'd rather have taken the injury himself. He said, ""Why would you rush in like that? What if it scars? She can handle it—she's used to it. But you? You're delicate. You shouldn't be hurt like this…""

Willow's voice was soft and trembling, her eyes filled with tears that clung to her lashes. ""I was just scared Father might get hurt… I didn't even think. I just moved.""

When Willow spoke, Henry's heart ached even more.

Everyone in the room hovered around Willow, fussing over her.

Meanwhile, Athena stood quietly to the side, her cheek visibly swollen—yet no one paid her any attention.

She said nothing. A flicker of cold amusement passed through her eyes.

When Henry slapped her, Eloise didn't even flinch.

But the moment Willow was accidentally hurt, that same ""mother"" had panicked like her life depended on it.

Anyone watching would've thought Willow was her real daughter.

Henry, still full of concern, didn't forget to glare at Athena.

He said, ""If it weren't for you, none of this would've happened. Honestly, we never should've brought you back thirteen years ago. Should've left you where you were.""

Nicolas also gave her a disapproving look—but when he saw the bruise on her face, he hesitated, and swallowed his words.

""Enough. That's enough. All of you, out,"" Margaret said with a headache brewing behind her temples.

""Yes,"" the others responded, withdrawing.

Margaret gently took Athena's hand and began applying medicine to her swollen cheek herself.

She said, ""Athena, don't hold it against your father. He's got a temper. But from now on, I won't let anyone hurt you again.""

Looking into Margaret's loving, weathered eyes, Athena couldn't bring herself to say the sharp words that had been sitting on the tip of her tongue.

""Of course not,"" she replied, forcing a quiet smile.

Margaret sighed. She wanted to say more, but fatigue overtook her. She waved Athena off to rest. ""We'll talk later.""

After helping Margaret lie down, Athena finally returned to her courtyard.

She had barely sat down when a familiar voice called from outside. ""Athena, are you asleep?""

Irritation flickered across Athena's face. She signaled for Siena to open the door.

Eloise stepped inside. Her gaze landed immediately on Athena's swollen cheek. She walked over, her voice gentle. ""Does it still hurt?""

Athena stared at her, silent, as if asking a question without words.

Eloise quickly realized how foolish her concern must have sounded. She hurried to continue, ""Athena, I brought you some wound medicine from Harmony Apothecary. This one's made by a famous physician—it's the best.

""The healer's been missing for three years now. His medicine is nearly impossible to find. Use it sparingly—it'll fade your bruises in less than a month.""

She reached out, tucking a loose strand of Athena's hair behind her ear. ""Athena, I've let you down. I didn't protect you when you needed it. If you're angry, blame me. Just… don't take it out on anyone else.

""From now on, I'll treat you right. I promise.""

She pressed the medicine jar into Athena's hand. Athena opened it—and saw right away that it was half empty.

She knew this medicine. She was the one who produced it. She knew exactly how much was supposed to be in a full jar.

Of course. It had been used already. Passed down to her only after someone else didn't need it anymore.

Eloise noticed her silence and felt a sting of disappointment.

Athena hadn't always been like this. She used to smile at everything she was given. Used to sweetly call her ""Mother,"" like it meant something.

Now, she was distant. Cold. A stranger.

'Willow would never act like this,' she thought. 'That child is so thoughtful, so gentle.'

""Well, I'll let you rest. I'll stop by again tomorrow,"" Eloise said.

Athena stood. ""Take care, Lady Eloise.""

She made no move to walk her out. Eloise hid her disappointment, turned, and left with slow, unsteady steps.

Athena watched her go, a faint crease forming between her brows.

She thought, 'If not for Margaret's illness… I wouldn't stay in this house another day.'

Chapter 6 Replace Her

The next day, Athena was summoned to Margaret's courtyard.

When she arrived, Willow was already there, kneeling obediently beside Margaret, gently massaging her legs.

The moment Athena walked in, Willow scrambled to her feet in a panic. She greeted her timidly, ""Athena,"" then quickly stepped aside to give up her spot, looking every bit the picture of meekness and quiet suffering.

Nicolas frowned, clearly displeased. His voice was low and stern. ""Willow, you're also raised under this roof. You don't need to act so pitiful in front of her.""

Then he shot Athena a sharp look, his eyes full of disdain. ""No one in this house owes you anything. Who are you putting on that sour face for every day?""

Eloise gave a light cough into her handkerchief. ""Nicolas, that's enough.""

Nicolas glanced at her, then held his tongue—but his expression remained cold, and his eyes, harsh.

Athena understood then—he was speaking up for Eloise. He must have heard that she'd turned Eloise away the night before.

She looked over at Eloise, who wore a stiff, embarrassed expression.

Eloise seemed to want to say something, but when her eyes met Athena's icy gaze, she lost her nerve and backed off. Annoyed, she turned and snapped at Nicolas, ""Go check if your grandmother's medicine is ready.""

He knew perfectly well she was trying to send him away—and truthfully, he had no desire to face Athena's cold stare any longer. With a flick of his sleeve, he stormed out.

""Such a temper,"" Margaret muttered once he was gone, then beckoned to Athena. ""Athena, come here. Sit with Grandmother.""

Athena came forward and sat beside her. Margaret took her hand, her voice warm and affectionate. ""You've had a hard time.""

Athena placed her hand gently over hers. ""As long as I have you, Grandmother, it hasn't been so hard.""

Margaret let out a long sigh, then got to the point. ""Athena, there's something I want to ask you.""

""Of course, Grandmother. Please speak.""

""Do you still care for Michael? Is he really the only one for you?"" There was hesitation in her eyes, and a deep, pained concern in her expression.

Ever since Athena returned to the estate, the Osborne family had sent someone—very discreetly—to suggest replacing her in the engagement.

Not wanting Athena to be humiliated, Margaret had sent them away under a pretense.

Athena understood immediately. ""They want to call off the engagement?""

She had spent three long years locked away in a military camp—her reputation utterly ruined. Of course the Osborne family would no longer want a disgraced woman as a daughter-in-law.

Margaret nodded, clearly struggling to say it aloud. ""It's not quite breaking it off… They just want to marry someone else instead.""

Athena's eyes shifted to Willow, who quickly looked away, guilt written all over her face as she lowered her head.

It all made sense now.

Her reputation was in tatters. If the Osborne family officially broke the engagement, it would offend the Monson family and create bad blood.

But they didn't want her anymore. Swapping her for Willow—pure, innocent Willow—would be the perfect compromise. And more importantly, Willow was willing.

Everyone in the room was focused on protecting the duke's estate's reputation—yet not one of them had asked Athena what she wanted.

No wonder their expressions had all been so tense. They were afraid she'd cause a scene. Too bad for them—she wouldn't give them that satisfaction.

""Grandmother, I agree,"" Athena said, her face blank, her tone as calm as if she were commenting on the weather. ""I agree to the change in engagement.""

Margaret and Eloise stared at her, stunned.

""But you were once so in love with Michael. What made you change so suddenly?"" Margaret asked, clearly baffled.

Athena had once cared for Michael so deeply she would've laid down her life for him. That was the only reason Margaret had bothered to ask her in the first place.

But Athena's expression didn't waver. ""That was a long time ago, Grandmother. People change. I stopped caring about him ages ago.""

At that, Eloise let out a visible sigh of relief. She turned to Willow and gave her a knowing, tender smile.

Willow clung to her arm, eyes lowered, face tinged with shy delight.

The quiet exchange between the two made the whole situation feel even more absurd to Athena. The decision had clearly already been made—so she wondered, 'Why the charade of asking me?'

Margaret looked at Athena with deep sorrow in her eyes. ""Athena, don't be afraid. Even if the Osborne family backs out, I'll do everything I can to find you a good match.""

But she knew in her heart—Michael had been the best they could hope for.

With Athena's name in tatters, there was no way they could arrange a match of equal status now. No noble family would consider her. Her life, as far as society was concerned, was over.

Margaret felt a stab of grief—her precious Athena had endured too much.

But Athena just smiled faintly, as if it no longer mattered. ""All I want is to stay by your side, Grandmother.""

""Don't be silly."" Margaret sighed. ""You can't spend your whole life looking after me.""

She hated to see Athena wronged, but this was the best outcome left. If the Osborne family officially ended the engagement, Athena's reputation would be in complete ruin.

Before long, Margaret grew tired. After helping her settle in for a nap, Athena quietly stepped outside.

As she walked out, she handed a folded slip of paper to Marquita Huynh. ""From now on, prepare Grandmother's medicine using this prescription.""

Marquita looked surprised. ""Lady Athena, where did this come from?""

""A friend gave it to me. If you're unsure, feel free to have a doctor look it over."" Athena didn't elaborate. She handed over the prescription and walked away.

Just as she stepped through the gate, she stopped abruptly—Michael was standing right in front of her.

Backlit by the sunlight, he looked like a cold shadow descending upon her.

""Athena,"" he said, coming to a halt in front of her. His tall frame instantly blocked the sun.

The chill that radiated from him made her shiver. Even after three years, being this close still left a dull ache in her chest.
Suddenly, Michael seized her thin wrist, his voice low and icy. ""This engagement was settled years ago. You don't get to walk away from it.""",1,1751691102.0,u_WeakResult6194,0,1.0,False

Decided to take another swing at poor man’s brisket .  This was my second smoked chuck roast on the Traeger, and it turned out better than I could’ve imagined I am still having mouth orgasm aftershock from the incredible juicy delight that I was rewarded with after a not so long but not so short 12 hour smoke.

I ended up using Rufus Teague’s Meat Rub (sweet, savory, a little heat) instead of mixing my own this time, but I’ve also used the coffee-based dry rub from Quiche My Grits before (recipe in the pics). Both options slap, just depends on the vibe you’re going for.

My process:
	•	~2.5–3 lb chuck roast
	•	Smoker set to 165°F to start (Traeger)
	•	Let it soak up smoke to 165°F internal
	•	Wrapped in butcher paper, then took it to 195°F
	•	Rested in a cooler for ~1.5 hrs
	•	Sliced and shredded — bark was solid, smoke ring was bold, meat was juicy

This thing fed the whole fam and disappeared fast. I’ll definitely be doing chuck roast more often; brisket flavor and feel without the time or price tag.

Lately, I’ve been scrolling through our subreddit and noticed so many posts from people, especially those new to our vibrant city, feeling lonely or searching for friends. I totally get it—when I first moved to Hyderabad, I felt the same way, craving connection in a new place. But over time, I ended up making some amazing friends in my PG and at the office, and it made me realize something: friendships are all around us, waiting to happen.

I truly believe finding friends shouldn’t feel like a daunting, solitary task. While connecting online through places like this subreddit is awesome, there’s something special about building bonds with the people we already cross paths with every day. Think about that colleague who shares your love for filter coffee, the gym buddy spotting you during a workout, the cabmate you share your daily commute with, your roommate binge-watching the same series, the neighbor you wave to, or even that badminton or TT partner you rally with at the local court. These folks are already in your orbit, and they might just be hoping for a friend too.I know most of you might have already tried this, but I’m sharing this thought just in case it sparks a little connection with the people around you. 

Maybe try to exchange a warm relationship—if not full-on friendship—with at least three people you meet regularly. Then, encourage those three to share the same warmth with three more people each. Before you know it, we could have a wave of kindness and connection spreading all over Hyderabad, if you know what I mean 😅. 

TL;DR: Felt lonely when I first moved to Hyderabad, but found great friends in my PG and office. Connecting online is fine (love this subreddit!), but also try sharing warmth with people around you—like your colleague, gym buddy, or neighbor.",4,1751690951.0,hyderabad,3,0.84,False

In Trawler’s Cove, no one dares to speak about Mummering in this small town.

It's a light hearted tradition in Newfoundland that starts in December, a way to connect with others during the long and cold winter. Folk would dress up in all kinds of strange and silly ways to hide who they are when going house to house to those they knew. Old lace curtains, bras worn over coats, tea cozies on their hands, many different ways to hide who you are just for those you visit to try and fool friends and family. It was a good way to come together and share a few drinks with each other.

That's how it’s supposed to be anyway, but not here.

Not in Trawler’s Cove.

Here, Mummering is banned and frowned upon for even talking about it. We don’t even celebrate Halloween from fear of the costumes that are used. Anyone catches you wearing any sort of costume and you would be dragged away before you even get your boots untied.

The ban had been in place for so long now that not a single person remembers when it really started, but why the ban was made was very clear.

Every ten years the town of Trawler’s Cove gets consumed by a fog that runs in from the shoreline.

You can see it coming in from the distance, thick as wool and heavy as rain, swallowing everything it touches as he creeps its way over the town. There are always signs of it coming in far before then, the way the sea goes quiet and how every gull in the town seems to vanish before the fog is spotted. It’s like a scene from a horror movie every time it comes.

Trawler’s Cove lets out loud sirens to warn those unaware of its approach, sirens that are so loud that standing near them would physically hurt you if you stayed there for too long. Shops shut down, schools close up, every house gets filled with folk all around even if they didn’t live there. It was to risky to be out there the moment the fog weaves its way through every inch of the town.

The moment the fog settled in the silence is deafening when all you can do is wait

It is only then they show up.

I was only six years old the first time I saw them for the first time. I remember standing at the front window, nose nearly pressed against the glass as I watched the mist pour in before the figures started to show up, groups of six every time as group by group they started to walk down the road, each group going off into their own direction down the road we lived on.

They looked like traditional Mummer’s yet at the same time they also felt wrong, something about the way they moved or the piece of clothing they wore just did not look right the closer they got to the house. No two dressed the same as each and every one of them stood out from each other. The only detail that was the same among all of them were the white bedsheet like masks they all wore, wrapped tightly around their heads with big enough holes cut out from them to see where they were going with hats on top. The way they breathed under those masks made the sheets move in and out at a slow rate.

At the time I was too young to know any better. My six year old brain saw everyone outside all dressed up and wanted to join them, even tried to run out there to join one of the groups when mother caught me by the collar and yanked me back from the front door before quickly locking it.

She didn’t shout at me, she just kept me close to her side in the living room where the rest of my family was all gathered to, quiet and tense as we all watched the windows into the unknown world outside.

I don’t think I ever heard my parents be this quiet, even my older sister had gone completely quiet as she too watched what was going on outside.

The only sound that was made at that moment was the sound of an old Screech bottle my father had was placed on the coffee table with a small glass resting beside it yet he didn’t dare to take a drink from it, leaving it there only to join my mothers side to comfort her as she watched in horror.

I didn’t understand why, not then at least.

But now I do.

I could tell my father was scared from the way his hand shook beside him, his eyes locked on to the window looking outside, everyone was scared. Even my sister was scared, the same person who was never scared of thunderstorms that could rattle the house with each strike or face up against bullies who tried to torment me at school. Fear has a way of soaking into you even when you didn’t fully understand what you were supposed to be scared of.

It must have been maybe a half hour when the fog and Mummer’s arrived that my mother let out a sudden and painful scream while she was sitting near the window. She had watched one of the groups wander up to one of the neighbors' houses just down the road. She grabbed me and pulled me away from the window with such force I thought I was going to be thrown to the floor, but she pulled me in close to protect me from what was going on outside. I only caught a glimpse of what she had saw, the group of Mummer’s leaving the house, all of them dragging something behind them as they all came together and made their way back into the thick fog.

It was the neighbors, all five of them dead and bloodied as their limp and lifeless bodies were dragged out of the house and pulled behind the Mummer’s into the fog, leaving nothing but streaks of blood on the street behind them. I didn’t know they were bodies at first, my sister filled me in on some of the details since she too also spotted it happening.

She had nightmares for weeks before telling me this.

At the time it was unclear how many houses were visited by the Mummer’s, the ones who survived kept quiet, not wanting to speak ill of any of the families or the Mummer’s themselves with fear that they would be next with visitors in ten years, ten years they wanted to live in peace and maybe be gifted with a peaceful death before then. The ones who did speak up about it tend to differ in the count, six houses all the way up to seventeen. What was clear was how many of them survived from their visitors which was none of them, a few of them breaking one of the few rules of denying them entry into the house.

This angered the Mummer’s and would send them rushing into the house they were visiting and killing everyone inside with no mercy. You could hide if you wanted to, but no matter what crawlspace, false floor or tiny little spot you think you were safe in, they would know where you are and it never mattered in the end. They would find you and kill you like the rest of the family or even visitors in the house. Fighting them was even more useless, my father told me once about a family who took shots at one of the groups, grabbing his hunting rifle and letting it crack in the fog to fight them off. Not a drop of blood or anything, they just walked up to the house they needed to be and waited to be invited in.

""You can't be killin' what’s already gone, my love."" I remember my mother telling me once, one of the only few times she ever spoke about them which was a rarity from her.

The next time I saw the Mummer’s again I was sixteen and the sound of the town's alarm going off scared me. I was outside when it went off and I can still remember how my father ran out and grabbed, dragging me back inside. Like before it took a bit before the fog rolled in, thick as smoke as it swallowed up the whole place and only left us with a sliver of the road in front of the house or for us to see. It was the same as before, everyone in the house gathering up in the living room, my father grabbing that old bottle of Screech again and placing it on the coffee table.

What had changed this time was how scared we all were now, my sister and I knew more about this now and even I could feel a coil of fear building up inside of me, threatening to burst and make me cry from just standing there.

The only person at the time who was doing their best to keep themselves together was my father who was sitting with my mother, comforting her the best he could.

We all watched in silence, more quiet than that house could have ever been as we looked out the front living room window, our eyes scanning for those groups of six to come walking out into the open road until they finally did. They were slow but they walked with purpose, instruments in hand for some of them while others followed along like they were meant to.

We weren't sure of the first house they went to, it was right on the edge when we saw one of the groups splinter off and head off beyond what we could see, but one of the groups made their way to our neighbor, Violet and her husband Cyril who were an older couple and right away you could her Violet screaming and shouting at the Mummer’s who did not react to her. It wasn’t until she slammed the door closed that they suddenly shifted from calmly standing there to violently rushing into the house, screams from Violet and Cyril echoing out from the now wide open door and scaring all of us as well. The only thing we could see were silhouettes of the Mummer’s rushing past one of the windows with hands raised and dropped down on the couple. Just as soon as the violence started, it ended in silence.

It was only then you could hear the rhythm of footsteps going from pavement to wood, making their way up the front patio steps until they all shuffled to a stop near the front door. My father was the only one who stepped up to that front door, his hand shaking as he slowly turned the knob and opened it. All of them stood there facing my father blankly and it was only then I realized just how discolored they all were. The normal bright colors you would have expected to see from their costumes were slightly dimmed down, almost like wherever they were coming from was slowly taking it away from them, making them seem more grey and white.

My father stepped aside, inviting them in and my mother guided us to sit down as all of the Mummer’s stepped into the living room to the opposite side of us, dead eyes looking down at us. One of them looked to my father like he was projecting a silent message to him as my father zipped out of the room and returned with two folding chairs, two of them gently taking it from him and unfolding them to sit on before my father could even join us.

Having to stare down a group of people wearing mismatched clothing, white clothed masks with hats, bras and other random things would be a lot better to see if your life wasn’t on the line, but our lives were on the line.

I sat on the edge of the couch closest away from the living room window, my mother sat in the middle with my sister to the other side. My father sat near me in his own seat, a loud thump from the way he sat down like his legs gave out before he could sit down properly, or maybe he was internally giving up. We must have sat there for a good five minutes without a single one of us making a peep, eyes locking on to each other from across the room.

Four of them had instruments.

The first one had an old guitar, fairly normal yet looked older than myself with a slight warp in its form as the Mummer holding it held on to it gently. The second one had an accordion, a once vivid red now dulled down by whatever affected the Mummer’s as well, like the color had been slowly bleeding out of it since one of them picked it up.

Two others had more different styles of instruments I guess you could say, especially if you're not from Newfoundland. One had what you would call Dory Dan Spoons, two metal spoons back to back on one rod to slap against your hand or knee to the rhythm of whatever song you played. The other garnished what we call a Ugly Stick, a broom handle with nails sticking out the side of it that held bear bottle caps on to, a boot on the bottom and what was supposed to be a tin can or even wooden head on top was now replaced what looked like bone of some sort, maybe the cap of someone's skull. They would tap the ugly stick with one hand while the other had a small wooden stick to tap on it, letting off a rattle to it when used properly with a song.

The last two had nothing, they looked like they were just there for the fun but even I knew that could be right as I sat there looking at them. I could feel their eyes on us, greyed and unfocused as they went from each of us over and over again, almost familiar in a way. “Alright listen to me and listen to me carefully.” My father finally spoke up, shattering the silence between us all. “All we have to do is guess who one of them is, that's it! Guess one of them and they’ll leave.”

“How are we supposed to know who they are?” I remember asking my father, confused about the rules of this game.

“They used to be family, all of them. So think of family members, long gone family members.”

They truly were the dead coming out to test us.

They weren't just murderous Mummers, we were sharing a room with the dead coming back to test us, to make us remember who they were from how they moved to what they wore. It was all just some twisted and sickening game not to save our lives but to remind us of those we lost as well.

Before my father could explain anything else the accordion player started, a sudden and loud note that made us all jump in our seats as he held on to that note much longer than we thought before starting into playing a familiar song called: The Mummer’s Song.

One by one they all started to join in, even the two without instruments played along, clapping and stomping their feet on the floor to the rhythm of the song, yet there was something just wrong about the song itself. It was being played a touch off tune, enough to make it sound wrong and put us all on edge the more they played, but there was something to the song I didn’t think about until we really got into it.

It wasn’t just a performance.

It was a countdown.

My father never had the chance to tell us that they would only play the song three times, nothing more and nothing less. If we guessed one of them correctly they would stop and take their leave. But if we didn’t and the song ended, they would kill us.

They hit every note with an eerie precision yet it still remained off tune and wrong as my family panicked and started to guess, wild guesses from the top of their heads to try and get through this as fast as possible. “Him!” my Sister was the first to speak up, pointing to the man who was simply clapping to the song as her finger shook wildly. “That’s Pop Desmond! He knew this song by heart.”

The way he stared at my sister was like he was angered by the first wrong guess yet he didn’t stop to the rhythm of the song, they all played on.

She got it wrong.

“Aunt Bridget.” My mother spoke up next, pointing to the one playing the accordion. ""She was the only one in the family ever good at playing the accordion.”

Same as before they played on, tears streaking down my mothers face as she sat there on the couch with us. My father was trying to guess who some of them were, mumbling to himself as he looked back and forth between a few of them when the first song came to a sudden end, leaving it quiet there for only a moment before the accordion started that same long note again and right back into the song, faster than before yet even less out of tune.

I could see the blood leaving my fathers face as he stared at them, we were running out of time and he was caught up on some of the names in his head. “You have to be my great-grandfather Noa!” he shouted, nearly standing up as he pointed to the one with the ugly stick tapping on the floor.

I was frozen in place by all of this, sitting there with my heart racing as the one with the guitar was staring me down, one eye normal while the other was almost bloodshot, almost completely filled with old blood that nearly completely darkened his eye. There was something familiar about it but I just couldn’t put my finger on it.

“Jerome!” I remember my father barking at me finally, snapping me out of the moment to look at him with a mixture of anger yet pure fear in his face. “Guess Jerome, guess!”

I never heard him speak to me like that before until then, it scared me even more with thoughts that if I didn’t guess we would all be killed because of my lack of guessing. I had to guess but I couldn’t think of anyone that would hit any of them, any of them except for the guitar player who kept staring me down.

Name after name they tried yet over and over the Mummer’s seemed to reject the names, playing on as they ended the second song, more abrupt then before before starting back up again even faster, more twisted than the other two times. “Make it stop, make it stop!” I remember my mother crying out finally, a scream letting out from her as my sister broke down as well, pulling her into a final hug to keep her close before the end came to us.

My father kept firing with name after name, pointing to each of them until he finally stopped, looking at me with defeat before he pulled me into a hug, his arms wrapped around me as my eyes were still locked on to the guitar player. “I’m sorry…I'm so sorry Jerome.” He told me, choking on his words as he tried to talk to me. “I want to let you know I’m proud of you, I’ve always been proud of you. I-”

I was unfocused in the moment to hear the rest of what he was saying, my eyes locked on to the Mummer playing the guitar as he looked right back at me like he was trying to tell me who he was.

Beyond his single bloodshot eye he wore a pair of overalls with what I thought were grease or oil stains turned out to be small patches of dried up tar. It was thicker than most with what looked like small patches of blood with the color faded to it around the sides of them like he bled out from his back.

It pulled my mind back, a memory coming back to me that haunted me to this day. It was impossible yet this entire scenario was impossible as well as the name swirled up to my lips just before the song was about to end. “Uncle John?”

Every instrument came to a sudden halt the moment I spoke that name out loud, my father turning to look at the Mummer’s before letting me go, looking at me with some confusion to what I even said as his cheeks were soaked from the tears he had shed.

The Mummer with the guitar didn’t speak a word, instead he gently placed his guitar up against the wall before taking his hat off and pulling the cloth mask from his face, revealing the rugged face of my Uncle John beneath it. Seeing him even like this brought back that terrible memory of the day he died and yet I still blamed myself for it even if it wasn’t really my fault.

It was four years ago during the summer time. It was just my sister, Uncle John and myself at home that day when my Uncle was working on the roof to replace the shingles. Mom and dad were at work and it was a blistering hot day to be doing anything outside, yet he wanted to get it done since we had been pushing it off for so long. He was half way done when he asked me to throw him a bottle of water from the fridge and to this day I still think I threw it too hard.

I was on the front lawn when I threw it, tossing it with all I could up to him. I don’t know if it was the way he caught it, if he slipped or what it was, but when his hand reached out for it I remember him stumbling to catch himself before falling out of view behind the house with a loud thump. Running around to find him I screamed seeing him dead on the ground. My father told me he died instantly by smacking the back of his head on one of the few large rocks sticking out of the ground behind the house.

I blamed myself for years, I still blame myself honestly. Seeing him then it just stirred something up inside of me to go and hug him, to tell him just how sorry I was he died because of me, but my father wouldn’t let me, he couldn’t as he grabbed me and kept me there on the couch.

I watched as my Uncle stepped to the coffee table, pouring himself a glass of Screech before downing it in one go like it was nothing. He looked at me. Not with warmth, not with anger, just emptiness before slipping his mask and hat back on as he picked up his guitar and started to head to the front door, they all did.

One by one they all stepped out of the house and back onto the road, my father quickly getting up behind them to close and lock the door with a loud snap. We all pulled each other into one big hug, shaken from what we had endured only to escape it by the skin of our teeth. The only thing to reunion the moment was my sister gasping as she looked to the window, her eyes on the neighbors house as we watched the Mummer’s, now covered in splatters of blood, drag the old couple out of the house by their feet and on to the road with the Mummer’s.

They dragged them out, streaks of blood on the road until they were out of sight and deep into the fog once again. Just like that, they were gone as the fog started to pull back from the town once again.

Ten years passed when they came again and that was my tipping point after I found out my sister was at one of the houses being visited. She didn’t make it along with the rest of the family.

I tried to leave and get away from this place, I didn’t understand why no one else did until I attempted to multiple times. No matter what road you take leaving Trawler’s Cove they somehow all lead back into town, I tried multiple times to leave and the more I pushed the faster I came right back to my hometown. I even tried just following a compass, reaching the furthest I could go in my truck and just ran into the forest thinking I could break free from this place by going straight north.

I just ended back up near the front part of town the moment I broke through the tree line and just gave up. There's no way of escaping this town, I wouldn’t even be surprised if this town didn’t exist at all to the rest of the world. Luring people in and locking them here for the rest of their lives.

I’m thirsty six now and I still live in my family house. My mother and father passed away years ago and it’s just me now. The town alarms are already going off and the Mummer’s will be back soon. If they visit me again, I’ll refuse them from entering.

I understand now why some people do and hopefully they kill me quickly.

I just don’t want the idea that one of them is my Mother, my Father or even my sister.

Building after building like huge walls or an acting metaphor. Though I find myself laughing at these silly thoughts not because I have them so often but just that sick realisation that I will never be able to do anything about it. I guess my prize in this world isn’t some promotion or a higher grade even though I did work my ass off, hard… every single day… every single fucking day. “Sorry” I said to myself, I trembled, my lips formed a crooked smile, not a sinister one but one where I fed myself full with delusion, I am the best.. No I’m not.. 

I looked down at the busy traffic, the constant honking, the sea of strangers I brush shoulders with everyday all with that same damn look. Just bitter.

 

The wind blew past me, I didn’t shiver. My way of accepting that is indeed the end, that is this fate. The curse of knowing that this isn’t place yet I have to pretend I’m getting by, pretending to like that coffee at some corner cafe, reading that self help book at the best-sellers shelf, pretending to be interested in THE life on screen and with people I meet but then I toss and turn constantly at night, fending off that beast, the pounding in my head I constantly that painkillers for. Trying to convince me always that this isn’t right, rejecting that inner freedom I longed for, the taste of real air instead of air conditioners or burning cigarettes or gas but it’s all just a joke, a story I made that I formed in my head to make myself stand out, I am the king of the land… 



“How ironic,” he mutters to me. 



I turned, with my dead set eyes and my damped curls. “Is this fate?” 



“What is?” He brushed his hair back, somehow with the heavy rain. He still looked better.. He looked like everything I wanted to be 



“I don’t know” I gaze down again wiping my eyes not knowing if it’s rain or tears, “I guess the fact that I’m on this roof, deciding..” My voice trails off



Deep down I knew that he knew too that I was afraid. I wasn’t deciding.. Just stalling, lying, giving in. I gripped onto that heavy cement and swallowed my breaths. I counted each heartbeat, sickiest symphony I ever heard. 



“Well buddy, it’s either you swim or fly” he interjected, letting out a dry laughter. 



I began laughing too, I didn’t know why I just did. “Guess there’s only one way out, right?” I turned to him. 



Something in me clicked, my fingers loosened, my joints relaxed and the colourful hues spiraled around me like a huge kaleidoscope, I was in my best clothes, ironed and crisp and my hair proportionately split. Pages from my books flung open, spread out like an angel's wing. I had no phone, no wallet. Just the air flowing quickly passed me, I saw lives ahead of me but I just shook my head. He looked up at me as he fell from his grace, he had chosen to swim with that innocent hope that “life’ was going to save him and he was.. Well he sank to the bottom believing he was still floating in all his luxuries, that life had salvaged him but not at all. 



The night went on, no one seemed to notice he was even gone. That’s when I felt like I could fly. Finally I was free, I could say goodbye. Letting go as my spirit soared, buildings and papers fading from my eyes. Only tears in my eyes, for I could see the sun for the very first time.

I mean, the idea of walking into a room full of strangers gives me the jitters. I'm more of a cozy sweater-at-home kinda person, chatting with familiar faces over a cup of coffee. But I figured it was time to challenge myself.

At first, I stood there awkwardly, fiddling with my phone like an awkward penguin. But then, this thought hit me: ""Why not just treat it like a casual conversation at my usual coffee spot?"" After all, everyone's there to connect, right? So, I took a deep breath and initiated a chat with someone standing close by. I was surprised by how natural it felt once I got going.

By the end of the night, I had chatted with several people and even swapped a few contacts. I realized that people are often just as nervous as I was, which somehow made it all seem less daunting. It made me question how often my comfort zone actually limits me. 😅

Honestly, the experience was liberating. It's funny how stepping into discomfort can end up leading to such personal growth. I learned that the stories we build up in our minds can be way scarier than the actual experience. Anyone else feel the same?",8,1751689789.0,edgeSteps,2,0.91,False
1ls1gc3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Banff/comments/1ls1gc3/banff_with_kids_low_expectations_edition/,Banff with Kids: Low Expectations Edition,"My kids, 5 (almost 6) and 8 years old, are not hikers. They are sometimes not happy taking a walk around our neighborhood. Please save the “why did you take them to Banff” — it’s been a bucket list item for me and not everything is always for the kids, ok?!

But with that in mind, I figured I could help out other families bringing their kids with similar outlooks by sharing our experience.

We are also not hikers, but we do appreciate the outdoors. This also means we were winging it on AllTrails reviews and gut instincts all week.

Lodging

We stayed in an airbnb in Canmore. This was mostly driven by the need to do laundry with two kids who spill a lot and attract dirt! It was the perfect location for our home base for 5 days. Note: we had a rental car.


Itinerary

Day 1: Icefield parkway from Canmore. 

Stopped at Bow Lake and Peyto Lake. Took lunch with us to eat at the top of Peyto lake view. Great way to have the kids get a taste of hiking. Felt completely safe. Pretty crowded!

Note: the bathroom at Bow Lake is in the day use area! You can go down by the water and put your feet in.

Day 2: Whitewater Rafting with Chinook Rafting

Super fun though a long process before getting on the water. Spent about 1 hr 45 mins on the water. Kids loved it.

Note: we woke up to book last minute park Canada shuttle tickets for lake Louise this day for day 4. No problem getting 4 tickets at 8 am.

Day 3: Grassi lakes and Blackshale Suspension Bridge

At Grassi lakes, we went up the interpretive trail and then down the easy trail. Great payoff! Fun trail for the kids. We had lunch at the top before hiking back down. Did not feel unsafe although there were bear sightings the days before. Got parking no problem.

Drove out to blackshale suspension bridge right after and did the hike to the bridge. This was not busy and because of that and maybe the overcast day it felt like we were in a bear’s den waiting to be eaten. But it’s a quick hike (made quicker by our nervousness) and we did not see a bear we are just inexperienced hikers. We did have bear spray though. Kids liked the bridge but it’s a ways out there. Pretty drive and it gave our kids a break after hiking Grassi lakes. 

Day 4: Lake Louise and Lake Moraine

Booked the 7am-8am shuttle, took about an hour to get to the lake Louise shuttle parking. We went to lake moraine first and headed to the cafe where they sell (outrageously priced) self serve drip coffee near the gift shop. And we got two of them. Then we went up to rock pile for the great views. Back to the bathrooms and we thought we would do some of the consolation trail because our kids like climbing rocks. We did not intend to do the whole thing (4 miles!) but we got in too deep (sunk cost fallacy, you know?!) to turn around now, so we kept going. Word to the wise, the boulders at the end of the trail look really cool but wow it’s hard to help your small kid go from rock to rock while telling your 8 year old to be careful and carry a backpack and your kids Pokémon stuffy. But we did it and it was our kids’ favorite hike the whole time. Bring your bear spray and try to stay with groups. It can feel beary scary at times. Also tons of mosquitos so bring bug spray or wipes.

After that we hopped on the bus (20 mins?) to Lake Louise. It was packed. We walked along the shoreline but say why the hell not and told our kids the Fairview lookout sort of looked like a treehouse so we should check it out. It was a con job, we knew it wasn’t a treehouse and they did not want to go but, yolo. There were complaints on the way up, it’s short but steep. Great views up top but very small area so we stayed for all of 2 minutes before heading down. That was much more enjoyable than going up. 

Day 5: sunshine village gondola + cave and basin
We went back and forth on doing the gondolas but decided to do sunshine village instead of the banff because it was an 8 min gondola followed by a chairlift. Kids 5 and under are free. We then hiked to the Standish view and took the selfies. Look for the button on the lower deck! And then we hiked down to rock isle view. Great hike down but a hell of a hike back - all uphill. 

We drove to the Banff train station parking and grabbed lunch. We then walked (foolishly) to cave and basin, it was too far. We knew it but it was only about a mile. Got there 15 mins before closing and saw both the cave and basin. Nothing too exciting - could have skipped this. Then we bribed the kids with ice cream to encourage them to walk another mile back. 

Dining
Rose & Crown (pub food, kids liked the chicken tenders) ⭐️⭐️⭐️
Rocky Mountain Flatbread (flatbreads and pasta - delicious!) ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Iron Goat (casual dining, duck wings were good) ⭐️⭐️⭐️
Famous Chinese Restaurant (huge portions, kids liked the fried chicken. Everything was sweet and really terrible) no stars
Eclipse Coffee (fine coffee, not kid friendly baked goods)⭐️⭐️⭐️ 
K Bakery (next to eclipse, walked over with our coffee and got the kids donuts and cinnamon rolls) ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Three Bears Brewery (banff) ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Old School Bus Ice Cream (no chocolate ice cream?!) ⭐️⭐️⭐️
Lovely life cream (pretty good not spectacular) ⭐️⭐️⭐️

Misc. 
get groceries in Calgary, Safeway had run out of a lot of things in Canmore
Gear up has bear spray for $10/day rental
First Wednesday of the month you can visit the Kananaskis Parks for free

Overall, kids really liked the trip. I had pretty low expectations and we really took our plans day by day. They complained less than I thought for being new hikers and that is a win. And I’m exhausted from telling them to not throw rocks into every lake, stop running, don’t touch that, those flowers aren’t for picking, and to be careful. But, I’d do it again.

Happy to answer any questions.

I’m (23M) meeting up for coffee tomorrow with a woman (38F) I met at a professional networking event. I’m attracted to her and I’m pretty sure she knows, when I first asked her out, I said I’d really like to get to know her better. She agreed but mentioned she was leaving for an international work trip the next day and offered to meet tomorrow before she left (I wasn’t able to). We couldn’t meet before she left, but we kept in touch while she was traveling, texting every few days with trip updates.

She just got back this week. We originally talked about doing something on the 4th (I suggested dinner or fireworks), and talked in the morning but later in the evening she said she was still jet-lagged and suggested we grab coffee this weekend instead so that’s where we’re at.

I’m looking for advice on how to approach this. I’ve been told I’m good at conversation, but I’m a little nervous. Specifically, I want to avoid bringing up anything that makes our age gap feel like a big deal, I don’t want to come off as immature or overly focused on the difference.

Also, I don’t have much dating experience. I’m only interested in something casual, which I’ll be honest about if things move in that direction. Is there anything else I should keep in mind or prepare for going into this?

Appreciate any thoughts!

Is being given a 2nd chance still possible for me?,"Everything between us happened just this year. We were Grade 12 senior high school classmates. I started becoming interested in her on February 14. I had a classmate make a self-crocheted keychain that I planned to anonymously give to her on Valentine’s Day. I didn’t want her to know it was from me.

When she received it, she used it and hung it on her bag. I was lowkey happy seeing her use it.

Then March came — that’s when everything started. We became mutual. We got grouped together for an event group work that lasted from the 1st to 2nd week of March. That gave me the chance to talk to her every day. I showed my intentions clearly.

Our prom was in the last week of March. I really tried to win her over before prom so I could dance with her. I prepared a gift for her and included a quote — the same one from the keychain. We danced. Things went well.

Graduation was the 2nd week of April. On graduation day, I introduced her to my mother. My mom even took pictures of us. We were hopeful about our future together because we were going to the same city for college, far from our hometown.

I arrived in that city around the 3rd week of April to look for scholarships. I didn’t find any. She followed in the last week of April for a one-week stay, just to take an entrance exam at the university she already planned to attend.

On her 2nd day there, she invited me on a date — with her mother. It was hard to find a way to go because my boarding house was far from the city center, but I made it work. We spent time together from around 12pm to 5pm, since someone had to pick me up and it wasn’t easy to commute. On the 3rd day, she invited me again, but I struggled to get permission and a ride. I was late, but we still bonded while ice skating. After that, we sat and reflected with her mom. I asked her mother’s permission if I could court her daughter. Her mom was happy and said it was good that I asked her first.

Same time again — I had to leave at 5pm because I rode with someone heading home.

On the 4th day, she had her exam. On the 5th, she returned to our hometown.

I stayed in the new city and did everything I could to convince my aunt (who would fund my studies) to let me study at the same university as her. I told my aunt before when she was asking who's inviting me to hang out and go ice skating that she was my classmate before, that she was studying there too. But the truth is, I really wanted to study there not just because of her. That university aligned with my dreams of taking BS Psychology, and I felt it was the right environment for me, it was also just a bonus that my course is on the same campus of the university as hers.

However, my aunt didn’t agree. She believed gossip that students from that university were being forced into activism. She didn’t want me to go there. I kept convincing her, but it reached a point where she got bothered and called my mom. My mom scolded me and said I should be thankful someone is willing to send me to school and not be picky. They both assumed that the only reason I wanted to study there was because of her.

Because of that, I stopped pushing. I was worried they’d turn against our relationship. I couldn’t even do video calls with her anymore because my aunt would assume she was manipulating me. But we kept sending each other voice messages. May was a happy month for us.

By the 3rd week of May, I returned to our hometown. Our interaction became purely through messages. On the 4th week of May, she went back to the city to get her uniform and school ID. The day before her flight, I invited her on a simple ice cream date. I wasn’t used to going out and I was cautious about spending, but I wanted to see her. We had fun. She stayed less than a week and returned before June.

We were still doing well in the first week of June. We constantly chatted, but I couldn’t video call because I didn’t have my own room, and my home was more toxic than my aunt’s house. I often opened up to her about my problems at home.

By the last day of June, she told me I was changing — that I wasn’t consistent anymore. She feared that I only put in effort before because I was chasing her. Now that I ""had"" her, she felt like I stopped trying.

We had a calm chat. I reassured her. I explained my situation honestly and told her my intentions were real. I told her I had plans for us, and I wanted to give her a future that wasn’t full of struggle. I hadn’t asked her yet if I could formally court her because I was saving that for when we were together again in the city, because I wanted it to be consistent.

We ended the conversation on a good note — or so I thought.

The next day, she became cold and dry. Her replies were short and delayed. I asked her daily if she was okay. She always said yes, but I could feel something was off.

At the same time, I was busy looking for a university very close to hers so I could fulfill my original plan, to finally take another step for us. I worked hard to convince my aunt — and I finally succeeded. I told her excitedly, but she didn’t seem interested anymore.

Three days later, I asked her, “Are you still okay with me?” That’s when she admitted she wasn’t sure anymore. She couldn’t see a future with me. She said she was bothered by what I told her about my current situation — that I couldn’t afford her what I wanted to give yet, that she didn't want to wait for someone who cannot risk for her. She said she didn’t want something extravagant, just something with real care. She felt like I wasn’t even making time to see her.

She said things that I was similar to her exes. She thought I was different, but maybe I wasn’t. She asked for space.

Before that, I had invited her to a friend’s birthday hangout. She refused. That was when I started to panic.

From then until June 13, I became desperate, but I hadn't realized this until after June 13. I didn’t give her space because I haven't really believed about the effectiveness of giving space before, I know it's due to my past experiences that I believed it. I messaged her constantly, trying to win her back. I even tried to call her. She refused at first, but I begged her to just listen, and she did. I poured out everything — my regrets, my sincerity, my hope.

I invited her to meet on June 10. She said yes. I planned everything. But she canceled on the day itself. I still wanted to do something, so I sent her flowers and a letter that night.

She messaged me. She said she was surprised and thanked me — but also said that it would change anything. That she had made her decision.

On June 13, I messaged again, saying about how much I'm hoping for us and for a chance, that's where she had enough. She finally told me everything. She said the flowers made her feel worse. That her ex did the same. It made her feel like I was just like them. I explained that while the action might be the same, the intention was different. But I couldn’t save what we had. We ended things — in good terms, she said that I should love myself more first because I can't give love to someone when I'm not confident about myself, but after that we're not cut off yet.

On June 16, I left her a goodnight note. She replied. Then we started exchanging notes daily.

On June 18, I went to the province for almost 2 weeks with my uncle. I learned a lot about self-love and reflection during that time.

When I got back, things were cold again. I reached out and asked if we could meet on July 1. She didn’t reply directly but asked if I was available on August 9 — her early debut. She reminded me that I was supposed to be her cotillion partner, and she's planning on doing it.

I asked if the event would be in our hometown because I had just learned my classes started on July 7, and I hadn't told her about my schedule, which has Saturday classes because I knew she'd not continue her plan for me. She said there would be practices days before. She told me it was okay if I couldn’t come. But I insisted. I said I’d go home every weekend, to book for ferry or flight. I even planned to work part-time to afford it.

On June 27, our university announced that classes would start on August 4 instead. I was so happy. I could save more and only focus on my flight to attend her event at August 9.

From then until June 30, I only sent her short notes. On June 30, I asked again if we could meet on July 1. She asked what for. I said to hang out and talk. She agreed.

When we met, I had planned for something light, it wasn't supposedly not to deep talk. But when I saw her, I could tell she was expecting something serious. I asked if she was okay. She said yes — but I knew she wasn’t.

I apologized, and we had a deep talk. I kept reassuring her that I didn’t want to give up. I admitted my faults. She told me she was exhausted. That it felt one-sided. That I wasn’t really risking anything for her.

I respected her feelings, but I admit that I also got respectfully defensive, about what I can give and I can prove because I wanted her to know I was changing. I told her I didn’t want her to just be a reason to become better — I wanted myself to grow and become better with her.

I reminded her of what she told me on June 13, how I got motivated by it — that I should fill my own cup first. I’ve been doing that. I kept saying that this will be worth it, that I'm willing for change, I assured my intentions. But her answer remained, “I don’t know, I just don't know anymore.”

She said she wanted to go home. I offered to walk her. She agreed. I asked if she had a bit of time left and invited her for cold coffee. After that, she said she’d take a taxi. I walked her to the taxi and said goodbye.

I messaged her and said thank you so much fot the time and told her to stay safe. She replied, “Thank you. You too.”

That night, I told her in a note that I’d give her space but that I’d still be here. On July 2, I left another note wishing her a good day. But she never replied anymore. She ended our TikTok streak that night too and reposted something about being in her “cutting off era.”

That’s when I knew it was really over.

The last hope I held on to was being her cotillion partner. But I couldn’t ask her directly anymore because of what recently happened. On July 3, I asked a friend who was invited and in the cotillion, about if she said something about the practice schedule, and said there's none yet, and also insisted that he'd ask her if I was still her cotillion partner. That friend asked her directly.

That’s when I learned — I was no longer her partner, and she replied it casually as if there's nothing happened.

I wasn’t home when I found out. My heart shattered. I walked aimlessly crossed roads a bunch of times, almost got hit by cars. That’s when I accepted it: it was over.

I regret being desperate. I regret not respecting the space she asked for. I dragged it out for so long when it could’ve ended it when it ended in peace between us.

But swore to myself that I'm changing. I’m growing, where I could've shown it to her. This change is for me, my growth, and could've been for the both of us.

Maybe one day. Maybe after years, we'll cross paths again, maybe she’ll see who I became. I still believe people deserve chances. But I know that’s not up to me.

The thing is I really loved her, she was my 1st time and I only loved her on the ways that I still know how to, I've been constantly learning because I wanted it to be better for us, for us to grow and learn together. It's so hard for me because what I feel is that I gave what I could give, haven't realized that it was considered as minimum effort. I will note it and will do my best to risk and love myself more.

Thank you for reading. I’m open to any thoughts or advice, please feel free. Because I believe thatPart of growing is learning from mistakes. I’m here for that.

Is being given a 2nd chance still possible for me?,"Everything between us happened just this year. We were Grade 12 senior high school classmates. I started becoming interested in her on February 14. I had a classmate make a self-crocheted keychain that I planned to anonymously give to her on Valentine’s Day. I didn’t want her to know it was from me.

When she received it, she used it and hung it on her bag. I was lowkey happy seeing her use it.

Then March came — that’s when everything started. We became mutual. We got grouped together for an event group work that lasted from the 1st to 2nd week of March. That gave me the chance to talk to her every day. I showed my intentions clearly.

Our prom was in the last week of March. I really tried to win her over before prom so I could dance with her. I prepared a gift for her and included a quote — the same one from the keychain. We danced. Things went well.

Graduation was the 2nd week of April. On graduation day, I introduced her to my mother. My mom even took pictures of us. We were hopeful about our future together because we were going to the same city for college, far from our hometown.

I arrived in that city around the 3rd week of April to look for scholarships. I didn’t find any. She followed in the last week of April for a one-week stay, just to take an entrance exam at the university she already planned to attend.

On her 2nd day there, she invited me on a date — with her mother. It was hard to find a way to go because my boarding house was far from the city center, but I made it work. We spent time together from around 12pm to 5pm, since someone had to pick me up and it wasn’t easy to commute. On the 3rd day, she invited me again, but I struggled to get permission and a ride. I was late, but we still bonded while ice skating. After that, we sat and reflected with her mom. I asked her mother’s permission if I could court her daughter. Her mom was happy and said it was good that I asked her first.

Same time again — I had to leave at 5pm because I rode with someone heading home.

On the 4th day, she had her exam. On the 5th, she returned to our hometown.

I stayed in the new city and did everything I could to convince my aunt (who would fund my studies) to let me study at the same university as her. I told my aunt before when she was asking who's inviting me to hang out and go ice skating that she was my classmate before, that she was studying there too. But the truth is, I really wanted to study there not just because of her. That university aligned with my dreams of taking BS Psychology, and I felt it was the right environment for me, it was also just a bonus that my course is on the same campus of the university as hers.

However, my aunt didn’t agree. She believed gossip that students from that university were being forced into activism. She didn’t want me to go there. I kept convincing her, but it reached a point where she got bothered and called my mom. My mom scolded me and said I should be thankful someone is willing to send me to school and not be picky. They both assumed that the only reason I wanted to study there was because of her.

Because of that, I stopped pushing. I was worried they’d turn against our relationship. I couldn’t even do video calls with her anymore because my aunt would assume she was manipulating me. But we kept sending each other voice messages. May was a happy month for us.

By the 3rd week of May, I returned to our hometown. Our interaction became purely through messages. On the 4th week of May, she went back to the city to get her uniform and school ID. The day before her flight, I invited her on a simple ice cream date. I wasn’t used to going out and I was cautious about spending, but I wanted to see her. We had fun. She stayed less than a week and returned before June.

We were still doing well in the first week of June. We constantly chatted, but I couldn’t video call because I didn’t have my own room, and my home was more toxic than my aunt’s house. I often opened up to her about my problems at home.

By the last day of June, she told me I was changing — that I wasn’t consistent anymore. She feared that I only put in effort before because I was chasing her. Now that I ""had"" her, she felt like I stopped trying.

We had a calm chat. I reassured her. I explained my situation honestly and told her my intentions were real. I told her I had plans for us, and I wanted to give her a future that wasn’t full of struggle. I hadn’t asked her yet if I could formally court her because I was saving that for when we were together again in the city, because I wanted it to be consistent.

We ended the conversation on a good note — or so I thought.

The next day, she became cold and dry. Her replies were short and delayed. I asked her daily if she was okay. She always said yes, but I could feel something was off.

At the same time, I was busy looking for a university very close to hers so I could fulfill my original plan, to finally take another step for us. I worked hard to convince my aunt — and I finally succeeded. I told her excitedly, but she didn’t seem interested anymore.

Three days later, I asked her, “Are you still okay with me?” That’s when she admitted she wasn’t sure anymore. She couldn’t see a future with me. She said she was bothered by what I told her about my current situation — that I couldn’t afford her what I wanted to give yet, that she didn't want to wait for someone who cannot risk for her. She said she didn’t want something extravagant, just something with real care. She felt like I wasn’t even making time to see her.

She said things that I was similar to her exes. She thought I was different, but maybe I wasn’t. She asked for space.

Before that, I had invited her to a friend’s birthday hangout. She refused. That was when I started to panic.

From then until June 13, I became desperate, but I hadn't realized this until after June 13. I didn’t give her space because I haven't really believed about the effectiveness of giving space before, I know it's due to my past experiences that I believed it. I messaged her constantly, trying to win her back. I even tried to call her. She refused at first, but I begged her to just listen, and she did. I poured out everything — my regrets, my sincerity, my hope.

I invited her to meet on June 10. She said yes. I planned everything. But she canceled on the day itself. I still wanted to do something, so I sent her flowers and a letter that night.
