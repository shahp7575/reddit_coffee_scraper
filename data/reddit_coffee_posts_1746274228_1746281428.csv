Okay, let's be real. If you're reading this, chances are you're in one of two boats: either you're staring down the barrel of a ""geriatric pregnancy"" (more on that delightful term later) or you're already weathering the storm of teenagehood…again. Maybe, just maybe, you're like me, and you've experienced both. Buckle up, buttercup, because this is going to be a wild ride.
Welcome to “Geriatric Teen Mom Oh Nooo"" a blog dedicated to the joys, the frustrations, and the sheer, unadulterated chaos of parenting later in life. We're talking about navigating the treacherous waters of teenage angst, social media drama, and burgeoning independence, all while trying to remember where you left your reading glasses and whether you took your vitamins.
This isn't your typical parenting blog filled with perfectly curated Instagram feeds and advice that sounds suspiciously like it was written by a robot. No, this is a space for real talk, for shared experiences, and for finding humor in the face of the utterly absurd. We're here to laugh, to learn, and to support each other as we navigate this unexpected chapter of parenthood.
So, grab a cup of coffee (or a glass of wine – no judgment here!), settle in, and let's embark on this journey together.
Geriatric? I Prefer…""Vintage Mom""
Let's rewind the clock about fourteen years. I was 37, I was convinced that my diaper-changing days were firmly behind me. My older children were well on their way to adulthood, and I was enjoying the relative peace and quiet of an almost-empty nest. Then, BAM! The universe decided to throw me a curveball in the form of a positive pregnancy test.
Now, I'm not going to lie, my initial reaction wasn't exactly not joy, but It was more along the lines of ""Oh. My. God."" Followed by a frantic calculation of how many years I'd be changing diapers, packing lunches, and attending school plays.
But the real kicker came at my first prenatal appointment. After the initial congratulations, the doctor casually dropped the term ""geriatric prenatal patient.""
Geriatric? GERIATRIC?! I nearly choked on my own saliva. I wasn't geriatric! I was…well, I was definitely closer to 40 than 20, but geriatric? That sounded like something you'd call your great-grandmother, not a woman who still occasionally rocked out to 80s music and could (almost) keep up with her kids.
Of course, being the inquisitive (and slightly offended) person that I am, I immediately Googled ""geriatric pregnancy."" Turns out, in the medical world, any pregnancy after the age of 35 is considered ""advanced maternal age,"" which is just a fancy way of saying ""geriatric.""
Thanks, science. You really know how to make a woman feel good about herself.
But after the initial shock wore off, I started to see the humor in it. I mean, come on, ""geriatric prenatal patient""? It's an oxymoron, almost comical. And besides, I decided, if I was going to be a ""geriatric mom,"" I was going to be the coolest geriatric mom on the block.
So, I embraced my ""vintage mom"" status and prepared for the arrival of my surprise baby. Little did I know, the real surprise was yet to come…teenagehood.
From Wonder Girl to Wonder…What Was That Attitude?!
Fast forward fourteen years. That surprise baby, that sweet little bundle of joy, that adorable toddler who used to follow me around like a shadow, is now a teenager. A teenager with opinions, with attitude, and with a seemingly endless supply of eye rolls.
My ""wonder girl,"" as I affectionately called her, has morphed into a remarkable young woman, full of intelligence, creativity, and passion. But she's also…challenging. Let's just say that the transition from sweet little girl to independent teenager has been a bit like riding a rollercoaster blindfolded.
One minute, she's hugging me and telling me she loves me. The next, she's slamming doors and declaring that I ""just don't understand."" It's enough to make a ""vintage mom"" want to crawl into a hole and hide until she turns 30.
But here's the thing: I remember being a teenager. I remember the feeling of wanting to break free, to assert my independence, to figure out who I was. And I know that underneath the teenage angst, my daughter still loves me, even if she doesn't always show it.
So, I'm trying to navigate these teenage years with a combination of patience, understanding, and a healthy dose of humor. I'm learning to pick my battles, to listen without judgment, and to offer advice only when it's actually requested (which, let's be honest, isn't very often).
And I'm also learning to laugh at the silly things. Like the time she dyed her hair bright blue without asking. Or the time she wore mismatched socks to school because ""it's a statement."" Or the time she tried to convince me that ripped jeans were actually a fashion trend (okay, maybe she had a point there).
These are the moments that make parenting a teenager both challenging and rewarding. It's about letting go, about trusting that you've instilled the right values, and about watching your child grow into the amazing person they're meant to be.
Flashbacks and Face Palms: Teenager Things, Then and Now
One of the most interesting aspects of parenting a teenager later in life is the constant comparison to my experiences with my older children. It's like a never-ending game of ""Remember When?"" with a side of ""Oh. My. God. Things have changed.""
When my older kids were teenagers, social media was barely a blip on the radar. We didn't have to worry about Instagram influencers, TikTok challenges, or the constant pressure to present a perfect online persona. Their biggest concerns were passing their driver's test and getting a date to the prom.
Now, it's a whole different ballgame. My daughter's world is constantly connected, constantly evolving, and constantly filled with information (and misinformation). She's navigating a digital landscape that I barely understand, and it's both fascinating and terrifying to watch.
I find myself constantly asking questions like:
 ""What's a WAP girl'?""
""Why are you filming yourself dancing in the kitchen?""
""Is that filter really necessary?""
And the answers are usually delivered with a roll of the eyes and a sigh that suggests I'm the most clueless person on the planet.
But it's not just the technology that's different. The social pressures, the political awareness, and the overall climate of the world have changed dramatically in the past decade. Teenagers today are more informed, more engaged, and more vocal than ever before.
And while that's a good thing, it also presents new challenges for parents. We have to navigate difficult conversations about social justice, political activism, and the future of the planet. We have to teach our children to think critically, to question everything, and to stand up for what they believe in.
It's a lot to handle, especially when you're already feeling overwhelmed by the daily grind of parenting. But it's also incredibly rewarding to see your child develop into a compassionate, engaged, and thoughtful human being.
Resources for the ""Vintage Mom""
Okay, so you're officially in the trenches. You're dealing with teenage attitude, social media drama, and the occasional existential crisis. What's a ""vintage mom"" to do?
Here are a few resources that I've found helpful along the way:
Books: There are countless books on parenting teenagers, but here are a few that I've found particularly insightful:
-The Teenage Brain: A Neuroscientist's Survival Guide to Raising Adolescents and Young Adults by Frances E. Jensen and Amy Ellis Nutt: This book provides a fascinating look at the science behind teenage behavior.
-Queen Bees and Wannabes: Helping Your Daughter Survive Cliques, Gossip, Boyfriends, and the New Realities of Girl World by Rosalind Wiseman: This book offers practical advice on navigating the complex social dynamics of teenage girls.
-How to Raise an Adult: Break Free of the Overparenting Trap and Prepare Your Kid for Success by Julie Lythcott-Haims: This book challenges the idea of overparenting and encourages parents to foster independence in their children.
-Websites and Blogs: The internet is a treasure trove of information on parenting teenagers. Here are a few websites and blogs that I recommend:
-Parenting Teens & Tweens (parentingteensandtweens.com): This website offers articles, advice, and resources on a wide range of topics related to parenting teenagers.
-Psychology Today (psychologytoday.com): This website features articles on a variety of psychological topics, including parenting, adolescence, and mental health.
-Your Teen Magazine (yourteenmag.com): This magazine offers articles, advice, and personal stories from parents and teenagers.
-Support Groups: Sometimes, the best thing you can do is connect with other parents who are going through the same thing. Look for local parenting groups or online forums where you can share your experiences, ask for advice, and find support.
-Therapists and Counselors: If you're struggling to cope with the challenges of parenting a teenager, don't hesitate to seek professional help. A therapist or counselor can provide you with tools and strategies to navigate difficult situations and improve your relationship with your child.
Remember, you're not alone in this. There are plenty of resources available to help you navigate the teenage years. Don't be afraid to reach out and ask for help when you need it.
Having Faith: A Guiding Light in the Teenage Darkness
As a Christian, my faith is an integral part of my life and my parenting. I believe that teaching my children Christian values, conduct, and resilience is essential for their well-being and their future. But let's be honest, instilling these values in a world that's increasingly secular and increasingly influenced by social media can be a challenge.
I'm constantly battling the influence of cell phones, television, friends, and the ever-present political discourse. It's a constant struggle to balance the desire to protect my child from the negativity of the world with the need to prepare her for the realities of life.
Here are a few ways that I try to incorporate my faith into my parenting:
Lead by Example: The best way to teach your children Christian values is to live them yourself. Show them what it means to be kind, compassionate, and forgiving. Demonstrate the importance of prayer, worship, and service to others.
Have Open Conversations: Create a safe space where your children can ask questions about faith, doubt, and the challenges of living a Christian life in a secular world. Be honest and open about your own struggles and triumphs.
Encourage Critical Thinking: Teach your children to think critically about the information they're receiving from the media, from their friends, and from the world around them. Help them to discern truth from falsehood and to develop their own informed opinions.
-Focus on the Fundamentals: Don't get bogged down in the details of doctrine or the controversies of the day. Focus on the fundamental principles of Christianity: love, grace, forgiveness, and service.
-Pray Together: Pray with your children regularly, both individually and as a family. Pray for their needs, for their struggles, and for their future.
I know that I can't shield my daughter from the challenges of the world. But I can equip her with the tools she needs to navigate those challenges with faith, hope, and love. And I believe that's the best gift I can give her.
A Note on Politics (or Lack Thereof)
Before we go any further, let me make one thing clear: this is not a political blog. While I believe it's important to be informed and engaged in the political process, I also believe that parenting should be a safe space from the constant barrage of political opinions and debates.
This blog is about the joys and challenges of parenting later in life. It's about finding humor in the face of chaos, offering support to other parents, and navigating the teenage years without losing your mind.
I'm not going to tell you who to vote for or what political opinions to hold. I'm simply going to share my experiences and offer my perspective as a ""vintage mom"" who's trying to raise a decent human being in a crazy world.
If you're looking for political commentary, you've come to the wrong place. But if you're looking for a supportive community of parents who are trying to navigate the teenage years with grace and humor, then welcome! You're in the right place.
Navigating the Teenage Years Without Losing Your Mind (or Your Cool)
Okay, so we've covered a lot of ground. We've talked about ""geriatric pregnancies,"" teenage angst, social media drama, and the importance of faith. But the question remains: how do you navigate these years without losing your mind or your cool?
Here are a few tips that I've learned along the way:
Practice Self-Care: This is crucial. You can't pour from an empty cup. Make sure you're taking care of your own physical, emotional, and spiritual needs. Get enough sleep, eat healthy, exercise regularly, and find time for activities that you enjoy.
-Set Boundaries: It's important to set clear boundaries with your teenager. Let them know what's acceptable and what's not. Be consistent with your rules and consequences.
-Pick Your Battles: Not every issue is worth fighting over. Learn to discern the important things from the trivial things. Let go of the small stuff and focus on the big picture.
-Listen Without Judgment: Create a safe space where your teenager can talk to you about anything without fear of judgment. Listen to their concerns, their fears, and their dreams.
-Offer Support, Not Solutions: Sometimes, your teenager just needs someone to listen and offer support. Resist the urge to jump in and solve their problems. Instead, offer guidance and encouragement.
-Find Humor in the Chaos: Parenting teenagers can be stressful, but it can also be hilarious. Learn to laugh at the silly things, the absurd things, and the downright ridiculous things that happen along the way.
-Embrace the Challenges: The teenage years are a time of growth and change for both you and your child. Embrace the challenges and see them as opportunities to learn and grow together.
-Seek Support: Don't be afraid to reach out for help when you need it. Talk to your spouse, your friends, your family, or a therapist. You don't have to go through this alone.
-Have Faith: Trust that you've instilled the right values in your child and that they will eventually find their way. Have faith in their ability to make good decisions and to become the person they're meant to be.
And most importantly, remember that this too shall pass. The teenage years are a fleeting moment in time. Before you know it, your child will be grown and gone, and you'll be wondering where the time went.
So, enjoy the ride. Embrace the chaos. And remember to laugh along the way.

So, let's embrace this journey together. Let's laugh at the silly things, embrace the challenging ones, and provide support in a non-judgmental ""safe space."" Let's navigate these teenage years with grace, humor, and a whole lot of love.

Not sure if this is a stretch, but I do find the use of a hair pin more than just serving a functional purpose, as opposed to contributing to the thematic whole. Hairpins were generally used by women in the 1960s (and obviously still now), and the protagonist’s dissatisfaction with short hair in Caroline, No implies that the hair was traditionally long in Wouldn’t it be nice, implying youth and naïveté. And through the course of the album, beginning with the very first song after ‘Wouldn’t it be nice’ (that also has an immediate tonal and thematic shift), there is a noticeable change in how the main character perceives the girl, beginning with this small change in the girl’s look.. the use of a hair pin, implying some small level of maturity, growth or change, from the previous song, contributing to the emotional instability in the song.. ending ultimately with the hair being cut off entirely, to the lament of our protagonist.

1kdtqzq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pottery/comments/1kdtqzq/a_speech_i_wrote_about_who_pottery_makes_me_feel/,A speech I wrote about who Pottery makes me feel,"**On Pottery — an open speech**

Speech speech speech I said in my bad mexican accent. Whenever I ask people to give a speech, they always try to turn tables around. But I won’t. *I am bad at Math* I said but they don’t believed me. *My mom does not allowed me* I said but they don’t believe me. *I don’t speak any english* I said, but they don’t believe me. I don’t believe them either.

I don’t want to speech but I try to think fast: pottery, the studio, pottery, the wheel, pottery, clay, pottery, glazes, pottery, is all mud at the end. Who would I be without it? Too permanent I think. Someone is drinking beer from a 1600 pottery glass. Is it called glass even when is made of clay? Am I potter? when do you become something? Some people say is when you get paid — professionals, like many sitting here. In that case, I am far from it, the book has always been in the red, except for January 2023. Maybe I was a potter then.

What are I am supposed to say? I love this place. I love the clay, I love the wheel, I love this tool, that tool and even that other tool, I love the oven and even when I hate glazing, I love the glazes — a strange mix of water and sand that sometimes crystallizes into beautiful colors and sometimes explodes in the kiln. I am not allowed to mix glazes anymore. I went to Madrid once, they had a chair made of clay but no one was allowed to sit on it. Is that pottery? Something you can see but has no use? Maybe I am a potter after all. Everyone eat from their plates and drink from their cups.

Why do you do so many devils? Is it because you are mexican? Maybe. I think so. Maybe.I guess is cause you are mexican. Maybe. I really think so. Maybe. Don’t you have this day of the dead in Mexico? Maybe. Maybe I am Mexican after all, I don’t like football but I did a skull.

I sell a couple of cups with a horrible glaze, I am glad they gone. I sell a mask, I am glad it’s gone, more than demon looked a ladybug, maybe that’s why someone bought, it was not scary enough. The devil lose fingers, but I attached them all. It’s been long since nothing exploded. Explosions are fun…. “NOOO” they scream.

I go down to the basement, I dip on one glaze, two glazes, three glazes, four glazes, use a cookie, maybe two cookies, the whole bottom of the bowl is glue to the cookies, I take it home, I ate the cookies. Please now only one glaze, we don’t have any cookies anymore.

If there is something that I owe to pottery is self-confidence. If you sell few, don’t take it personal, we all have bad days, if you sell a lot, don’t get too confident, we all have good days. At work I show what I do, so weird he says, so so weird, she repeat, someone in the corner that I barely know ask the price, I would pay 5 he says… maybe 4 she says, 2 someone else says, but is 50 I say, then he fells out of his chair. I never thought I would sold anything of those useless and strange things. One time someone arrived to the studio with the phone in a hand and asks, Is HE selling here? For everyone surprise she was talking about me. I often think about her. Nasa making the first contact, a whole universe opens. It’s not that someone bought a piece, is that they saw what I saw; Nothing. Because is not about them, it’s about the clay and all the shapes it can take, it’s about the glaze and all the colors it can make, it’s all about myself in that table trying to paint while someone violently wedge.

I owe so much to the clay, to the kiln that old pray: “Let the pots and all the dishes turn out well and be well fired: let them fetch good prices and be sold in plenty in the market” I drink my coffee in the cup I got, it taste better, I guess is not the coffee but is the cup. How did coffee tasted before I got this cup, before I made my very own cup? I don’t remember and I will never know because this cup, this cup will never breakup.

Thank you so much for this space. Thank you for the clay. Thank you for ignoring me when the only thing I want to do is to work, thank you for this and that, but more than anything thank you all for sharing the wheel with me. Sometimes I volume up the radio, sometimes I hide in the basement. Sometimes it explodes, sometimes not. Sometimes it detach, sometimes not, the amount of times someone teach me to attach, the slip has to be made of dry very very dry and very tiny clay.

Who am I going to lie? I will not going give a speech. I am shy, I just want to drink. I come with wine, they come with food. I ate all the wine, I drink all the food. It was a good year.

Enjoy all your rocks with shiny glass on the top.

We went to Tiffany’s newly renovated flagship store and enjoyed champagne and GORGEOUS jewelry and I picked out the most perfect ring ever! We spent a blissful few months planning out the perfect wedding, and I chose the most beautiful wedding dress inspired by my favorite high jewelry collection. When I saw myself in the dress along with my Tiffany Victoria® Vine Ring in Platinum with a Tanzanite and Diamonds, I cried so hard I nearly threw up. Luckily my MIL had a Tiffany Everyday Objects Sterling Silver Sick Basin on hand!

I still fondly remember that time. Oh, how I long for that ignorance back. I thought I had the world on a string. Then, a month before our wedding day, disaster struck. When I got home from work one fateful day, I received a call from my Tiffany’s Sales Associate, but it wasn’t to let me in on which stellar products they were going to get next. She brought with her the direst news. My Fiancé was cheating on me! With….MY SISTER (28f)!

My brave and loyal SA had caught them in the Blue Box Café, sipping their signature coffee and wearing matching T bracelets! I was so shocked that I fainted on the spot. When I came to, my now Ex-fiancé was standing over me, holding my hand. But he was *not* here to reassure me. He was trying to get my Tiffany Victoria® Vine Ring in Platinum with a Tanzanite and Diamonds ring off my finger to give to my philandering sister!

“But BAAAAAABE!” He cried as I backhanded him across the room. “You don’t understand! I got your sister pregnant and we can’t have a child out of wedlock! I need your ring to propose to her!!!!”

“You lying snake!” I screamed. “How could you bring another woman to the best jewelry store there is?!!?!?!”

I ran to the freezer to drown my sorrows in ice cream, but then I remembered I’m lactose intolerant so I settled for lobbing the cartons off his head. He admitted under dairy duress that they’d first hooked up at his bachelor party a week ago! Not only that, he’d slept with his groomsmen (all 28m) and several of them were also pregnant! He begged me to give up my entire Tiffany ring collection so he could propose to all of them as well!

Needless to say, I kicked him out of the house and have canceled the entire wedding. I've been crying and drinking wine out of my Tiffany Bone China Coffee Cups. My extended family have all taken my sister’s side and insist that a massive, unprotected orgy at a bachelor party is totally normal in this day and age. They even held a séance to ask great aunt Euphemia what she thinks and she’s in agreement that I should sacrifice my beloved blue boxes so that my ex and his polycule can have the 10-way wedding of their dreams. Is it wrong that I refuse to give in?

Edit: Oh, I totally forgot to include a link to my sumptuous wedding ring! It’s utterly GORGEOUS and such a steal at only 19,900 dollars! It’ll be a symbol of eternal love and devotion-as long as your spouse doesn’t have a ten-way affair. [Link.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vF26QG9he4)

1kdtlk9,https://www.reddit.com/r/WashingMachineReviews/comments/1kdtlk9/does_tide_liquid_laundry_detergent_truly_deliver/,Does Tide Liquid Laundry Detergent Truly Deliver a Deep Clean Review?,"Testing the Tide 80740247 Liquid Laundry Detergent has been quite the adventure in discovering both the impressive attributes and a few minor quirks of this product. The familiar original scent of Tide instantly stands out—it's nostalgic and fresh, just as one would expect from a well-loved brand that has been a household staple for many families.

**Distinctive Design and Size**

The packaging is practical yet robust, with a large 132 fl oz bottle ensuring it doesn’t run out quickly, lasting up to 100 laundry loads. Its size might be unwieldy for some, but the built-in ergonomic handle makes it relatively easy to pour, even when full. I love that it's not over-complicated, and all essential details are clearly labeled. However, storing such a bulky bottle in smaller laundry rooms could be a bit tricky. If you're juggling limited cabinet space like I am, you might find yourself shuffling other items around to make room for it.

**Performance and Cleaning Power**

The standout feature has to be its outstanding cleaning power. Tide’s claim of deep cleaning fabrics lives up to expectations every time. From work clothes splattered with food stains to kids’ muddy soccer jerseys, it tackles everything with ease, leaving fabrics spotless. This detergent excels at brightening whites and maintaining the vibrancy of colored fabrics. I’ve noticed my towels and sheets have a renewed softness and brightness, which is always a plus. Even though it’s phosphate-free, it still delivers powerful cleaning results while being mild enough not to damage delicate fabrics.

**[Curious about Tide 80740247? Check Amazon for the latest price.](https://mobilewasher.com/p/b0bnwctnyn/)**

**Advantages**

- Exceptional stain removal, proven by its ability to clear even dried coffee stains on white tops.  
- The original scent is nostalgic yet not overpowering—ideal for people sensitive to strong fragrances.  
- Highly concentrated formula ensures you use less per load, making it last longer than expected.  
- Suitable for both standard washing machines and HE washers.  

**Target Users and Versatility**

This liquid detergent feels like it was created with versatility in mind. If you’re someone who juggles varied laundry needs—like I do, managing linens, children’s clothes, and delicate items—then this product can seamlessly cater to all of those. Its formula is gentle, meaning it's kind to my daughter’s sensitive skin, yet tough enough to obliterate the grime on my husband’s work overalls. Whether it's routine laundry or tackling tricky stains, it holds up exceptionally well. However, the lack of more eco-friendly packaging might bother environmentally-conscious users.

**Limitations**

- Bulky packaging can be inconvenient for compact laundry spaces or for people with grip strength issues.  
- This detergent might not appeal to users keen on unscented or hypoallergenic options.  
- Some reviews from others mention difficulty measuring the exact detergent amount using the bottle cap.  

**Competing Brands**

When compared to similar products like Persil ProClean or Arm & Hammer Clean Burst, Tide's formula clearly stands strong in terms of cleaning efficiency and its lasting scent. Persil ProClean offers admirable stain removal capabilities but doesn’t quite match the scent that Tide brings to the table. Arm & Hammer might be a more budget-friendly choice, yet it lacks the whitening effect I consistently see with this liquid detergent. Tide’s ability to handle a variety of fabric types and stains, combined with its comforting fragrance, gives it a notable edge in the market.

**Cost Efficiency**

From my perspective, the price-to-quality ratio of this detergent makes it a smart buy. It balances cleaning power, scent, and efficiency—a trifecta that not all liquid detergents achieve. Although it may seem pricier upfront compared to generic brands, its concentrated nature means fewer refills are required. On the whole, I’d say it earns its spot as a reliable choice for a premium detergent without feeling like too much of a luxury splurge.

***""Wood processing, yadi yadi, I've got a lighter, axe and a knife, check"", now you think you've got it covered, are you so sure?***

When I say a proper fire I mean not one that just warms your coffee but one you can cook on and keep warm with, dry out your boots etc, start with no previously collected store just from kindling enough to start it with, it is seriously hard and very hard work. It may even make you consider your gear and encourage you to improve it, never underestimate how tough a challenge this really is.

1kdteek,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridgeFanatic/comments/1kdteek/can_the_icemage_hs22_ice_maker_countertop_truly/,Can the Icemage HS-22 Ice Maker Countertop Truly Deliver? Honest Review Inside,"Testing out the icemage HS-22 Ice Makers Countertop has been a rollercoaster of convenience and curiosity. As someone who hosts family gatherings, constantly has friends over for late-night hangouts, and enjoys iced coffee far too often, my life screamed for an efficient countertop ice maker. The idea of finally ditching those slow freezer molds or inconvenient bagged ice from the grocery store was appealing, and this product seemed like a no-brainer. Yet, like every product, it delivered the good, the great, and the not-so-perfect moments.

**Effortless and Intelligent Design**  
Right out of the box, this countertop ice maker impressed me with its stainless-steel finish. Its sleek and compact design fits perfectly on my moderately cluttered kitchen counter, barely taking up any space. The dimensions, 9.5""D x 13.4""W x 11.6""H, made it ideal for small kitchens or cramped RV setups, which would make even my minimalist friends approve. Plus, the included ice scoop was surprisingly sturdy, even after one of my nieces decided to use it as a drumstick during a party. Minor scratches? Sure. But overall, the materials screamed durability, and it didn’t feel like one of those cheap plastic appliances you regret after a week. Take a closer look here: [Grab icemage HS-22 Ice Makers Countertop at the best price on Amazon.](https://fridgefanatic.com/p/b0dhh214fd/)

**Speedy Ice Production**  
This ice maker brags about fast ice production, and honestly, it’s justified. It consistently chirped to life, churning out 9 small ice cubes per cycle in just about 3.5 minutes. I measured the average time during three separate afternoons, and the efficiency was unmatched. Testing the large ice mode took slightly longer, around five minutes per batch, but the trade-off was worth the more durable cubes designed for slower melting sessions in drinks. There's something oddly satisfying about staring at this machine during operation—it’s almost meditative watching the ice cubes form and plop into the tray.

**Merits**  
- The machine produces a whopping 38 pounds of ice per day. I mean, who can even use up that much ice unless you’re throwing a festival or something?  
- The dual-size ice options are perfect for versatility—small cubes for quick cooling and larger ones for, say, iced tea or whiskey nights.  
- Operation is incredibly quiet; at 45dB, I could barely hear it running in the background, even during a Netflix binge.  
- Its self-cleaning feature deserves a chef’s-kiss emoji. Maintenance becomes nearly effortless with its one-touch cycle, keeping my ice hygienically pristine.

**Caveats**  
- The reservoir seems a bit small for peak party hours. While it holds plenty for small gatherings, it may not keep up with back-to-back drinks during large events.  
- Occasionally, the ice cubes seem to clump together unless I physically separate them, especially if they sit a while before usage.  
- It’s slightly bulkier than a traditional coffee maker, so if your counter space is already too busy, it could feel cramped.  

**Quiet and Unobtrusive Operation**  
My night owl habits often mean late-night iced coffees while binging on shows, and, to my joy, the noise level wasn’t distracting or annoying in the least. This aspect was surprising because most ice-making appliances I’ve encountered—especially from other brands—are outright noisy, almost like having a jet engine land in your kitchen. Here, the soft 45dB hum is barely noticeable and doesn’t even interfere with casual conversations or phone calls.

**Direct Competitors**  
Having scoured the market before making this purchase, I had considered a few alternatives. Products like the GE Profile Opal Nugget Ice Maker caught my eye. Sure, the Opal might appeal to nugget ice enthusiasts, but the price tag often shoots up into the premium range, making it less accessible. On the flip side, I also tested a cheaper no-name brand from a friend’s place (let’s just call it Brand X), and witnessing its painfully slow ice production solidified my decision. The icemage HS-22 might lack the ""nugget"" style, but it far surpasses comparable models when it comes to speed, dual ice features, and reliability.

**Value Proposition**  
Affordability plays such a vital role nowadays when considering appliances. While it doesn’t venture into ultra-budget territory, the features offer serious value for the money. For someone constantly in need of ice but not wanting to shell out for overly expensive models, this countertop machine strikes the perfect balance. Plus, vibrant events like camping trips or outdoor BBQs can include this machine since all you’ll need is a power source.

Owning this ice maker undoubtedly made my life easier, especially for those spontaneous gatherings. While hardly perfect, it’s reliable, efficient, compact, and aesthetically pleasing. Whether sipping iced coffee solo or hosting an evening with friends, this machine performed consistently well without requiring constant maintenance, and that makes life easier in my kitchen.",1,1746280120.0,FridgeFanatic,0,1.0,False
1kdtdje,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1kdtdje/uncover_if_the_delonghi_magnifica_evo_espresso/,Uncover if the De'Longhi Magnifica Evo espresso machine justifies its high praise review,"The De'Longhi ECAM29063SB Magnifica Evo Espresso Machine immediately caught my attention with its sleek chrome finish and compact design. Measuring just 9.45 x 17.32 x 14.17 inches, it fits comfortably on my kitchen countertop without hogging too much space. It's perfect for someone like me who struggles with cramped kitchens but loves their daily dose of caffeine. I’m not just saying that—I tested the heck out of this machine. Over the course of several weeks, I experimented with its features, and while I’ve grown to appreciate its strong suits, there are definitely quirks that deserve mention.

**Ergonomics and Modern Appeal**  
This espresso machine doesn’t only look good—it’s designed with user convenience in mind. The buttons are well-labeled and sit on a digital panel that's intuitive enough to navigate without ever having to reach for the manual. I appreciated the ergonomic placement of everything. From the removable water tank to the drip tray, every component feels thoughtfully positioned. However, I couldn't help but notice that the overall build quality didn’t scream luxury. For the price bracket it falls into, I was hoping for a little more heft and fewer plastic elements.

[See De'Longhi ECAM29063SB deals on Amazon now.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0d1pkm898/)  

**LatteCrema System and Beverage Variety**  
Creating café-quality beverages at home has always been my goal, and I was intrigued to try the LatteCrema system. Let me tell you, frothing milk—or milk alternatives—was a pretty satisfying experience. The machine excels at crafting silky, long-lasting foam. From lattes to cappuccinos, the texture was consistent, and I almost forgot I wasn’t at my favorite café. It offers five one-touch recipes, including staples like espresso, cappuccino, and latte macchiato. Honestly, however, the variety does have its limits; those who enjoy experimenting might find the options somewhat basic.

**Grind and Dose Precision**  
The highlight for me was the built-in conical burr grinder with 13 customizable grind settings. It made dialing in the perfect cup pretty straightforward. I tried coffee beans of varying roast levels, and it handled them with consistent precision. That said, when the grinder kicked in, it was loud enough to remind everyone in the house that I was making coffee. Maybe it’s just me, but a quieter operation would have been appreciated here.

**Advantages**  
- Offers five one-touch beverage recipes.  
- Saves space with its compact footprint.  
- Reliable LatteCrema system for quality milk frothing.  
- Grinder with multiple settings for optimum customization.

**Cleaning and Maintenance Hiccups**  
Let’s talk maintenance. The removable and dishwasher-safe components promise convenience, and while the auto-clean feature works as advertised, I found narrow corners where milk tends to build up. A thorough manual scrubbing became necessary at least once a week. Also, given how sophisticated the system is, there’s the looming threat of functionality issues if cleaning isn’t done meticulously after each use.

**Drawbacks**  
- Louder-than-average grinder.  
- Manual cleaning sometimes required, especially for milk components.  
- Plastic-heavy build for the price.

**Market Rivals to Consider**  
Comparing this product to others in its league, two immediate contenders come to mind: the Jura D6 and the Philips 3200 LatteGo. While the Magnifica Evo wins for its affordability and compact nature, the Jura D6 offers a more premium build and arguably quieter operation. On the other hand, the Philips LatteGo system is even more low-maintenance when it comes to milk frothing, thanks to its two-piece design, which is dishwasher-safe and dead simple to assemble or clean. That said, the De'Longhi excels in delivering a fresher espresso thanks to its grinder precision. 

**Worth Every Penny?**  
Pricing puts this espresso machine in the mid-level range, and honestly, I’d say it’s fairly priced for its features. You’re paying for convenience, compact size, and a decent shot of espresso. That said, this isn’t the type of machine that a hardcore espresso purist might fall head over heels for. It fits better for households seeking reliable, no-fuss coffee solutions with a more casual approach.

So at my work there is a woman(late 50s, also married) who is not your typical old lady vibe type. She is very attractive and doesn’t look her age nor acts like it and she definitely takes care of her self. We work in different departments and buildings so I don’t see her everyday.

We aren’t particularly close but we get along and sometimes I can’t tell if she’s flirting. So here are some examples. One time I stopped by their office(4 other ladies in there) to print something as my printer was broken. As I was printing she gets up with her coffee cup to get more coffee, looks at me and says ‘anymore caffeine?’ and taps on my shoulder with her knuckles as she walks past behind me. Another time I stop by their office again, I was doing my thing and she and another woman was talking. As the other lady leaves the room for a bit she randomly tries to involves me in that conversation and says ‘right (my name)?’. With me not paying attention I say ‘what?’. She chuckled and says ‘oh nothing’ and briefly puts her hand on my shoulder and she walks past me.

Some more examples.. we often do work emails with her and 4-5 other people and I often have to report my work back to them. But sometimes she responds back just to me saying have a good day/weekend. She uses smile emojis, lols and lots of exclamation marks. She also comments whenever I get a haircut saying ‘you got a haircut!’. I tell her ‘yea, like 2 weeks ago’ and she shrugs and says ‘oh but I haven’t seen you’. One time I asked her if it looks ok and she says oh yea as she nods her head slowly.

You open TikTok, you talk to people, you scroll through comments — and it’s all just coffee, coffee, coffee. People are literally making videos exposing cafés that are still selling at 50DA and saying “we’ll call the police on them” like it’s some huge victory.

is this really the biggest issue? A 20DA reduction which is like 600 da a month reduction that won’t change anything about your life? People still don’t have running water in some areas. unemployment is high. Public services are falling apart. And yet, we’re celebrating cheaper coffee like it’s some national achievement.

What’s even more frustrating is how quickly people forget the bigger problems the moment a distraction like this appears. Everyone’s just going along with it, reposting it, arguing about it, and acting like the coffee shop owners are the devils and the greedy ones that every problem we have is beca of them not even thinking for a second that maybe they’re being dragged into the wrong fight.

It just feels like we’re so far behind when it comes to awareness. To me this whole thing says a lot about where we are as a society and that we are really far behind from being a conscious people who know how to spot these manipulations.",10,1746279171.0,algeria,12,1.0,False

Pros:
- Cute, safe neighborhood. Close to the park, walkable any time of day
- Great neighbors in the apartment. 0 issues over the past year.
- Rent stabilized until 7/2027, will go up by 2.2% each year + a 421a charge which compounds yearly (see below). Next year will be year 3 of the rent stabilized abatement, so 125ish from that
- I negotiated the year 2 $92 421a charge (each year is about 41 per month) off for this upcoming year, otherwise would have been 2763.
- Closer to work in Murray Hill, 50m by train and 25-30m by car when working odd/long hours
- Would not have to move and risk losing security deposit
- apartment wide WhatsApp with ppl regularly giving stuff away, 'lending' sugar, trash bags, etc

Cons:
- Heat/sound insulation to the outside could be better. I paid ~200 in electricity/heat in the coldest month this year, though could have plastic sealed the windows etc
- Studio

Equals:
- In unit washer/dryer
- Small gym in building
- Proximity to prospect park


Option 2: Move to a new 1bd1ba in Prospect Leiffert Gardens, $3300 16mo lease - 2 months = $2887 + $250 (which agent said could be negotiable to 100 monthly)

Pros:
- Likely same price as my studio for a 1bedroom for 16 months
- Brand new building, possibly more efficient
- Fancy finishes

Cons:
- Promo/concession will not apply next year, so minimum price would go up by is $413 to 3300. Parking could go from 100 to 250 (unclear), so $563 total change, then add in that it's not rent controlled, idk another 5% of 3300?
- Neighboorhood is less safe, I would stand out at off hours 
- Not cute vibes, e.g. no random coffee shops
- Longer commute, 55m-1h by train, 43-45m by car in traffic
- Maybe deserves crucifixion: offers housing lottery apartments, which could be totally fine, but one bad apple could ruin the bunch. The stories I've read on here about dog piss and crap in the hallways and no way to evict easily sort of turned me off to this
- Farther from friends in Manhattan

**TL;DR: I'm seriously meaning to start a genuine intentional friendship — someone I can call my constant, buddy, best friend, brother (or maybe a sister) for life.**

I've always wanted to have a solid guy best friend, like Joey-Chandler or Pepito-Patrick kind of bond hahaha Might sound cheesy, pero it hit me sometimes na kapag kinasal ako, no one really comes to mind to be my best man. And there's no one I can really call my best friend at this moment.

To be clear, I actually do have good friends, different circles, even a good circle at work. But lately, I’ve been feeling a kind of emptiness. Maybe because my current friendships don't really offer the kind of connection I’m looking for right now? I realize I don’t really have someone I can message at random without overthinking if I’m being a bother.

Many of my old friends are in the province, and it's been really long since we've seen each other as I rarely go home, or when I do, our schedule just never aligned. Most of them pa, may mga sariling families na. So nahihiya na rin talaga ako sobra to just open up or ask for meetups randomly, as life seems to have pulled us already in different directions. I also do have close work friends na housemates ko rin, but probably the age gap (me a '94, them '00s), my seniority at work, or because they have respective partners, that makes it really hard for me to be vulnerable with them and open up fully? And while I have siblings, we’re not really close, and growing up, our home wasn’t the most emotionally open space. So maybe that’s why I’m looking for that kind of connection elsewhere.

As the panganay in the family, one of the kuyas in my circles, and senior at work, I always tend to put up a strong front that I'm really not used to showing my vulnerabilities to other people. But life has been rough lately and the world is being too cruel, that I've realized the need for someone I can lean on without feeling judged, someone to just be real with, someone who sees friendship as a commitment and not just convenience.

That said, no, I’m not necessarily looking for a high-maintenance friendship, but a committed one. I totally get that we all have our own lives and responsibilities outside of friendship, and that’s okay. What matters to me is knowing we have each other’s backs when it counts.

Some may say that maybe what I need at this point in time is a girlfriend or a life partner. For the record, I also would love to, especially with the pressure of already being in my 30s, but honestly, I don’t feel ready atm. I’m still figuring my life out. I’m scared that I’m not enough, that I lack in so many things. Well, maybe a slow burn type would be possible? I’m still working on my confidence slowly, but maybe this is my first step.

**Some things about me:**

* 30, single, 5'4, straight (but not super masculine; just putting it out there because I sometimes get misread)
* Working professional, Civil engineer (but not in practice), based in Ortigas, from Laguna
* I love dogs, coffee, cooking, hanging out at cafes • Into night walks, interested in joining fun runs
* More of a bundok person than dagat. But haven't really tried hiking yet (too shy to be a solo joiner)
* Quite a workaholic but maybe because I really don't have a social life outside work, and it's something I'm really meaning to work out for myself
* INFJ. Super introvert. Posting this is already way out of my comfort zone
* Not great at starting convos, but I’m a good listener and love deep, meaningful talks. I can be a yapper only once I'm comfortable with the person.
* In contrast to this post, I'm not really the serious type. I have a great sense of humor at kengkoy din minsan.
* I’ve been told I’m genuine and an empath, but I’ll let you be the judge
* Kaladkarin for spontaneous trips or hangouts, but not the planner type
* My younger years were spent mostly sa school lang talaga. And while I'm really really introvert, most of my days were spent with my friends. I’ve always found more comfort in my friends than at home

Sorry pang OffMyChest na ata sa haba. But yeah. If you’re someone who also values genuine friendship and sees it as a commitment, whether you’re a guy who could be that brother-type best friend I'm looking for, or someone who resonates with what I’m saying, tara, let's connect and see if we vibe!

Please help me as I can’t pinpoint what I did wrong.. I am desperate,"I apologize in advance for how long this is- I am desperate and can’t seem to get girls I actually like to be interested. I have 5 women I’m talking to but none interested me like this one. I am lost here because this has happened twice..clearly I’m fucking up somewhere but I don’t know where 

I’ve read the book 6 times.

On the 1st date, we went to a coffee shop and just talked about life. We didn’t text too much beforehand, just basics. I set a date within a week of matching online. She was very receptive. Texted me when she got home and even texted  me again a few hours later that she enjoyed herself. I waited until the next day and set up a date for Friday. We have a lot of common interests, have the same religion and we both work really hard. I let her do 85% of the talking and kept things fun and flirty.

She is very studious and had an exam today before hanging out. Shes in an intense curriculum(I know because I was in a similar one). We had set up on date on Monday and exchanged flirty texts, I told her that she should come sit on my lap and kiss me and she said “stoppp” and then proceeded to say “instead of going out Friday, let’s just stay in at your place. I’m gonna be tired but we should do that if that’s ok.” 

I have a situation where I’m having family
Stay over at my house for a week so I gave them the house and I had been staying at a hotel. I told her that and she basically said “oh ok I can’t stay overnight at the hotel as I gotta be up early but we can still hang out.” I said ok I’ll see you Friday. 

I didn’t text her after that- she texted me yesterday, then didn’t respond until today before the date. I pick her up and I’m talking to her and flirting a bit. As we pull into the restaurant, I kissed her. She was kinda star struck and I asked her if she’s ok and she said she’s just a bit nervous. We sit.. She then tells me she’s really tired and running on two hours of sleep and that’s he has to study after our date. I get the hint she doesn’t want to do anything physical so I do my best to keep it fun. I asked a lot of questions and we seemed to have more things in common. 

I’m gripping her thigh while driving her back dorm and she said to me, “I just have to make something clear, I’m becoming more religious and I’m not a physically intimate person until we date exclusively. I’ve been hurt by men before and I’m choosing to stay celibate until i am official with someone.” 

I reply with “ok that’s fine, I respect you decision.” I get the hint she’s wishy washy about me and I ask her if she’s still interested in going out and she said she definitely would like to go out again. She then told me that whoever she ends up dating, she’s only dating for marriage. I told her that’s fine and she said she would message me when she’s back in town as her college semester ends and she’s going home which is 2 hrs away. I tried to kiss her again before she left my car and got rejected and hugged instead. I haven’t gotten a text from her since.

I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I flirt lightly without being a creep, if she teases me, I tease her back, I don’t take things serious, I’ve never brought up relationships or exclusivity

After a while, we did a video call, but she never wanted to show her face, always saying her hair was messy. Later, she told me she had autism. Our conversations were often one-sided. We planned to meet at the park, but she canceled, saying she hurt her leg. She often claimed I was treating her differently because she had told me about her autism.

She told me her ex abandoned her, that she’d been seeing another guy but was dumped. One day after I was mugged and almost lost her number, she barely reacted — she was indifferent and said she wouldn’t message me unless I messaged first. She talked a lot about her cats and how her nephews had autism. She got very upset when her cousin said she used to drink with her ex.

Later, I invited her to the movies because she had complained we never went out. At first, she said she was too embarrassed to go. After some insistence, she agreed, but the next day she asked, “Wouldn’t it be better if we were just friends?” Still, we went to the movies, bought snacks, kissed during the film, and had a cute date afternoon. She was always very reserved, wouldn’t let me see her phone, didn’t give me her Instagram — only after we broke up did she share it.

Another time, we went to the mall, she gave me chocolate, and we ended up going to a motel. Once there, she said she was too embarrassed to have the lights on. I said it was okay, but she quickly became reactive and her mood shifted. We stayed a while and then went home.

There was another moment at the park where we were affectionate, but when I tried to take her home, she clearly didn’t want me to meet her family. Another episode: her sister dropped her off at my place, and I commented that we never went out because she was “being difficult” — she got really mad at me. We played a game once, I criticized it, and she got mad and stopped playing. She gave me chocolate, we were affectionate, and right after she talked about breaking up.

She invited me to a party, then kept changing her mind about whether we should go together. I got annoyed and asked if she didn’t want me there. I ended up going early, but she was very clear that I should only arrive at 6 p.m. When I got there earlier, her sister saw me and invited me up. We went to her friend’s party, where she introduced me as her boyfriend, but at one point, she randomly said, “Should we download an app to find you a hot girl?”

Later, we went back to her place, and she wanted me to sleep over, but I went home. After all these ups and downs, I called her and broke up. She cried, blocked me, later told me I had “sent her to the psych clinic” and took away her happiness. Not long after, she messaged saying she missed me more than she expected.

We started talking again, but while we were chatting, I found her on a dating app. She told me to go find someone else. When I confronted her, she claimed she was looking for her friend’s ex. I told her I loved her, and she said she’d been out somewhere and wished I had been there.

Later, she called, inviting me to her mom’s birthday party. I didn’t go. Her mom called asking if I loved her, then later invited me over for coffee. We started talking again, but she told me her dad was angry with me. I got upset and vented about it online. She found out and told me I had deceived and used her, that she was insecure and autistic, that she had prayed for me every day — and then she blocked me and disappeared.",3,1746278811.0,AITAH,14,1.0,False

I sat at a coffee shop yesterday for 4.5 hours working on a manuscript. Afterwards, my left quad hurt, nearer to the knee. This morning, the back hurts now. In addition, my calves have sore spots, there is a spot on my left forearm and bicep. There is also a sore spot on my upper right back. It is painful to kneel down and stretch that quad. If I'm sitting for a bit and get up to walk, it is immediately very painful then calms down.

I could have drank more water yesterday, so I have had about 40oz this morning so far.  

My life is very sedentary now because I'm in grad school. I usually move more, but recently put on some weight due to this lifestyle. I'm usually about 140lb and am currently around 155. Stress is high. I wanted to start lifting again today but I'm scared to given the pain.

Are there particular 'seeds' you're nurturing in your own inner garden these days? How do you tend to them? Maybe it's just remembering to breathe deeply once in a while or jotting down a quick note of gratitude. 🌿",1,1746278760.0,InnerGardenStories,0,1.0,False

First, planning is absolutely key. I initially bought a bunch of smart bulbs assuming they'd all work seamlessly together, but quickly learned about different protocols like Zigbee and Wi-Fi and the importance of a good hub. Now I have a more unified system wiht a dedicated hub, which has made things much smoother.Secondly, don't underestimate the potential for things to...not work. I had one smart plug that consistently disconnected from the network, and troubleshooting it was a huge pain. I ended up returning it and going with a different brand with better reviews. Reliability seems to be worth paying a slight premium for.

think about the actual use cases. I was initially excited about automating everything,but I quickly realized that some things are just easier to do manually. Such as, automating my coffee maker seemed cool in theory, but in practice, it was simpler to just press a button when I walk into the kitchen. Focus on the automations that actually improve your life and don't just add needless complexity. Anyone else have similar experiences or rookie mistakes they wont to share?

I should state that the coffee beans are very freshly roasted (it’s less than 5 days old as of today) so I don’t know if that plays a role in it or not.

First I went to a cafe holding a special theme event for the Key 25th anniversary, and there were some Clannad goodies, drinks, decorations and even background music playing (as well as other key related stuff). I can't describe in words how happy I was there. The attendants were so kind, one of them was able to speak english, it was so nice to talk to him and interact with the others. There was a japanese girl there having some coffee, and I was at my table appreciating the place, and then out of nowhere she just came to me and said ""hora puresento"" (here, a present) and gave me the key 25th collab card (it's in the last picture). Bro that made my entire day, thank you so much random japanese girl! I went there again and was lucky to get some Clannad illustrations (it was random and only came with a themed drink). They had a notebook for writting and drawing stuff for the Key 25th anniversary, so I drew Nagisa and wrote some stuff about how Clannad is my favorite anime and how the cafe was amazing (my japanese is very basic, but I google translated and did my best to write the kanji). The prices were a little bit expensive ngl, but it was worth it, sitting at a cafe with key related music playing and key decorations is something that I wish could do every single day. Unfortunately the theme event is a limited time thing, but I will put the cafe account with the location in the comments just in case.

Secondly I went to a Clannad pop up store (also limited time 😭)
It was a little hard to find it, but eventually I was able to find it. Unfortunately the cooler cheap stuff was already sold out, but I managed to get a keychain. There was only 1 attendant there and he was super nice as well. He didn't speak english, but I tried my best to talk to him with my basic japanese.

1kdsmiw,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1kdsmiw/bong_appétit/,Bong Appétit,"Chapter 1: Smoke and Skill

Danny Moreno had been smoking weed since he was fifteen. He wasn’t one of those weekend warriors or the “take a hit before bed” types. He was an everyday lifer. Wake-and-bake before breakfast, smoke breaks instead of lunch, and nightly bowls that scorched the glass of his favorite bong, Veronica. She was cracked on one side but still ripped like a freight train.

Danny wasn’t just a stoner. He was a connoisseur. He’d smoked strains that were grown in caves, lit bowls on a mountaintop with nothing but sunlight and a magnifying glass, and even hit a blunt laced with powdered mushrooms at a desert rave. That one ended with him hugging a cactus he thought was his dead uncle. He didn’t regret it.

But with every hit, his tolerance climbed. What used to send him giggling into the clouds now barely made his eyes red. Lately, nothing hit the same. Not even that small-batch strain called Widow’s Grin that was banned in three states.

What Danny lacked in mass, he made up for in an iron stomach and sharp hands. When he wasn’t high, he was in the kitchen, cooking, experimenting with different food. His top skills involved infusing oils, grilling steaks and baking cakes from scratch. His fridge was stocked like a Food Network set, not a stoner den. He could deglaze a pan better than most chefs and turn leftovers into gourmet meals. But he never gained a pound—just a metabolism that ran hotter than his gas stove

His two obsessions—weed and food—ruled his world. But both were starting to feel dull.

Until he found the ad.

It was 2:37 AM. Danny sat in his smoke-hazy room, half-watching a cooking video while scrolling through Craigslist for weird kitchen gear or “ethically questionable” edibles. That’s when he saw it:

“Hungry for the best high of your life? Starving for something real? 

Email the Reaper. One taste and you’ll never be the same.”

Reply to: (starvingforthis420@cryptmail.com)

He chuckled. “Reaper, huh?” Still, the wording stuck with him. Starving for something real.

He hit up his best friend, Kyle—another heavy smoker with a stomach like a void.

10:41 PM
DANNY: Bro. Just found the sketchiest ad on Craigslist. Dude calls himself the Reaper. Wants to feed us “the best high of our lives.”

10:42 PM
KYLE: LOL that sounds like a trap. Send it to me.

Danny forwarded the email to his friend. Then, with a crack of his knuckles, he began to type:

Subject: That Starving Shit

Yo,

I saw your ad on Craigslist. I’ve smoked a lot, and I mean a lot. If this is legit, I want in. Let me know where to meet.

Danny M.

A reply came five minutes later.

No words. Just an address.

“123 Rotterman Ave – Back Entrance”

Danny Googled it. The place was listed as condemned. Used to be a chip factory. Now it was just a black mark on the map.

He screenshotted the location and sent it to Kyle.

10:44 PM
DANNY:

KYLE:

DANNY:

DANNY:

KYLE:

DANNY:
Perfect.


Chapter 2: Craigslist Curiosity

The next afternoon, the sky looked sick. Pale gray with ribbons of darker clouds like bruises across the horizon. Danny stood outside his apartment, hoodie on, vape pen in his pocket, and Veronica tucked in a duffel bag. Kyle pulled up in his beat-to-hell Civic, bass rattling like it was held together with duct tape and weed crumbs.

“You ready to meet the Craigslist crypt keeper?” Kyle grinned as Danny climbed in.

“I was born ready to die from questionable decisions,” Danny said, slapping Kyle’s shoulder.

They punched the address into Maps: 123 Rotterman Ave. No reviews. No photos. No listing. The GPS guided them out of the city, past the suburbs, and into the industrial edges where factories slept behind rusted fences and the only people around were strays or squatters.

They pulled up to a massive, rotting building. The sign was mostly torn down, just a warped metal frame and half the word CHIPS left dangling. But neither of them had heard of this place before.

“What even was this?” Kyle muttered.

“Factory of some kind. Looks like it’s been dead a while. You ever been out here?”

Kyle shook his head. “No clue this place existed. Feels… off.”

The back entrance was a dented steel door propped open with a broken brick. The inside was dark except for streaks of dying sunlight through shattered windows. They stepped in. The air smelled like old grease, mold, and something sweet and rotting.

“Dude… this is some Blair Witch shit,” Kyle whispered, looking around.

Footsteps echoed. From the shadows emerged a man.

He looked like he’d crawled out of a mass grave. Shirtless, skin sallow and patchy. Bite marks ran across his arms and chest—deep ones. Flesh was missing in chunks, raw meat glistening beneath. One eye was swollen shut, the other darted between them like it was starving.

He was chewing on something.

At first, Danny thought it might’ve been gum—but as the man stepped closer, he noticed the man’s fingers. Most of them were missing their tips. Gnawed down to the first and second knuckle, raw and glistening, with dark scabs clinging like barnacles. One stump twitched as he brought it to his mouth and gave it an absentminded nibble, like it was just a bad habit.

“You Danny?” the man rasped, licking his lips slowly with a cracked tongue.

Danny swallowed his nerves. “Yeah.”

“You got cash?” the man said. This time he stared off into the distance, as if spaced out in his head. 

Danny nodded, pulling out a wad. “You got the weed?”

The dealer reached into a sagging black sack and pulled out a vacuum-sealed bag. Inside was bud the color of sickly purple veins, sticky and thick with trichomes. A small tag on the bag read:

“Deadhead OG: One hit and you’ll eat your own heart out.”

Danny raised a brow. “That’s… bold branding.”

The man smiled wide, revealing teeth that looked chipped and red at the roots. “Only for those who can handle it.”

They made the exchange. But as soon as the cash hit his hand, the dealer’s smile collapsed into a snarl. He lunged at Kyle.

Kyle screamed as the man tackled him to the ground, gnashing at his neck, fingernails clawing like hooked bone. 

“FUCK!” Danny yelled, pulling the only weapon he had—his glass bong.

With a scream, Danny smashed Veronica down on the dealer’s skull. The thick glass cracked but didn’t shatter. He hit again. And again. The third hit made a wet crunch, and the dealer dropped.

Kyle pushed him off, panting, blood on his shirt but unharmed. “Jesus, bro…”

They stood over the twitching, ruined thing on the ground. One last bubble of breath gurgled from the man’s throat. Then nothing.

Danny looked down at the dealer’s hand, the mangled stumps of his fingers still twitching.

“…he was eating himself,” Danny said softly.

Kyle just shook his head in disbelief.

Danny grabbed the bag of weed and looked at Kyle. “We earned this.”

“…You’re seriously taking it?” Kyle questioned, a look of concern flooded his face.

“We came all this way,” Danny said, a wide smirk slithering across his face. He knew it was a selfish act but something crept into his head, promising a high that he’s never felt before. 


Chapter 3: The Chip Factory

They didn’t say a word for the first fifteen minutes of the drive back. Just silence, except for Kyle’s ragged breathing and the occasional wet drip of blood from his shirt onto the Civic’s floor mats.

When they got back to Danny’s place, they both sat in the living room, staring at the bag of weed on the coffee table like it was radioactive.

“Dude,” Kyle finally said, “we just fucking killed that guy.”

Danny lit a cigarette with shaking hands. “He tried to eat you, man. That was self-defense.”

Kyle nodded, but his leg kept bouncing. “Yeah. But still. What the hell was that place? And his body? Did you see it?”

Danny remembered. The open wounds. The missing flesh. Like he’d been half-consumed—and not by animals. By teeth.

“His skin looked chewed, bro,” Kyle said. “Like, gnawed on. Even his own arms.”

Danny didn’t answer. Instead, he grabbed his scale, broke the seal on the bag, and poured out the bud onto a tray. The room instantly filled with the pungent, musky scent—something like death slowly mixed with berries, both ripe and spoiled.

They both stared at the strain name again.

Deadhead OG

Kyle read the fine print out loud: “One hit and you’ll eat your own heart out.”

“Is that a joke?” he asked.

Danny laughed hollowly. “I mean, zombie theme is on-brand, right? ‘Deadhead’? Could be a gimmick. Edgy marketing.”

He started weighing it out, measuring with precision.

“14 grams each,” Danny said. “Fair split.”

They sat there for a while in the weed haze, trying to make sense of what had happened. Eventually the conversation got deep, like it always did after too many hits.

“What if we’re just chasing highs because nothing else gives us anything anymore?” Kyle said, staring at the ceiling. “Like… maybe we’re already dead inside. Maybe that guy? He was just farther along.”

Danny thought for a second. “Or maybe we’re not dead… just numb. And we keep trying to wake up.”

“Maybe,” Kyle said. “Or maybe we’re already in Hell, and weed just makes it more comfortable.”

They both laughed. A sad, tired laugh.

Eventually, Kyle stood, stretching his back. “I’m gonna crash at my place. I need to clean this blood off before it stains. You good?”

“Yeah,” Danny said. “I’ll chill, mess with the new strain. Let you know how it hits.”

Before heading out, they locked eyes and gave each other the hang loose—thumb and pinky out, the Shaka brah. Their hands met in a quick, practiced touch, fingers brushing just enough to feel familiar. It was their usual sendoff, half joke, half ritual.

Kyle nodded, grabbed his keys, and left.

A minute later, Danny spotted the other half of the split—Kyle’s weed—still sitting on the table.

“Stoner move,” he muttered. “I’ll give it to him tomorrow.”

He grabbed his grinder, broke up a fat nug. It was denser than anything he’d ever touched, sticky as syrup, and the grinder jammed twice trying to tear it apart. He packed Veronica’s slightly cracked bowl and flicked the lighter.


Chapter 4: Inferno in a Bong

The flame hissed as it touched the bowl, and Deadhead OG lit up like it was alive—orange fractures crackling through purple flesh, releasing a smoke that spiraled unnaturally, thick as fog.

Danny inhaled.

Hoooooooooo

The hit punched his lungs like a cinderblock. He coughed so hard he nearly blacked out, clutching his chest, eyes tearing, veins in his neck straining.

Then everything slowed.

His couch seemed to stretch ten feet. The walls rippled like heat waves. Colors reversed—blue became orange, red turned to ghostly white. Shadows crawled, but they weren’t cast by anything.

Danny grinned. His fingers tingled, buzzing. He felt light, like his bones were helium-filled. His heartbeat sounded like distant tribal drums—ancient and primal.

Then came the voices.

Not actual voices—more like urges, raw and insistent.

Eat. Eat. Feed.

He gave a shaky laugh and rubbed his temples. 

The munchies hit like an avalanche. His stomach twisted, a ravenous beast clawing to be fed. He stumbled into the kitchen, tearing open cabinets, the fridge, everything.

Cereal. Chips. Beef jerky. Even a banana. He tore through each one, waiting for something to land—but nothing hit. The flavors were just… gone. Foods that usually slapped now tasted like cardboard. No salt, no sweetness, no satisfaction. Just empty bites and a growing unease.

Danny dragged his haul into the living room, plopped in front of the TV, and started shoving more food in his face.

He ate fast. Unhinged. Cheeks bulging, crumbs everywhere.

He expected the flavors to explode—sweet, salty, something—but all he got was emptiness. Each bite felt like chewing air. The nothingness clung to his tongue, dull and stubborn, refusing to let anything through.

There was a strange, slick pop—quiet, almost delicate. Then came the warmth.

He looked down.

Blood.

His finger was in his mouth, and he wasn’t just biting it—he’d chewed through the skin. A small crescent of flesh was gone, torn clean from the tip.

Pain hit first, sharp and blinding. But right behind it, curling through the edges, was pleasure—warm, electric, and wrong. It lit up his brain like a struck match.

The taste was… divine. Better than anything. Rich, savory, layered—like the world’s best steak marinated in human instinct.

He licked the wound, eyes rolling back slightly. It bled freely, and he didn’t even try to stop it.

“What… the fuck,” he muttered.

Then, slowly, deliberately, he brought the finger back to his mouth and bit down again.

Tears streaked his face, but he chewed and swallowed.

His pupils dilated. Something changed. His hands started trembling, but not from fear. From excitement.

An idea formed.

He limped to the kitchen, still high, still shaking. Pulled out a cutting board and a cast iron skillet.

He yanked at his hoodie, tearing the sleeve at the seam. The fabric gave with a rough rip.

Then he rolled up his arm, slow and steady, exposing bare skin.

He picked up the paring knife—small, sharp, familiar—and pressed it to his forearm.

And he carved.

The gash bled like a faucet. Blood ran down his arm, splattered across the floor, smeared on the fridge handle as he moved. He went to the kitchen, rummaged through the spice rack with one shaking hand—pulled rosemary, salt, and a stick of garlic butter from the fridge.

Then he seared a chunk of forearm meat on the skillet. Flipped it like a pro. Medium rare.

The aroma filled the room—rich and savory, thick with garlic butter, rosemary, and salt. The herbs crackled in the skillet, clinging to the seared meat cut from his own forearm. He basted it as it cooked, spooning the sizzling butter over the flesh like he’d done with steak a hundred times before.

Blood still dripped from his elbow as he dug through the fridge, pulling out a half-used onion and a bottle of balsamic glaze from the back shelf. He sliced the onion thin, tossed it into the pan, and let it brown in the leftover fat.

He plated it carefully, almost reverently, with the caramelized onions and a drizzle of the glaze across the top.

He took a bite.

And wept—silent, shaking, the taste overwhelming.


Chapter 5: The Munchies

Danny had turned his kitchen into a chef’s playground.

The floor was slick with blood. The counters were stained with fat and tissue. He stood barefoot, shirtless now, his skin pale and glistening with sweat, chest rising and falling like a beast mid-hunt. He’d wrapped a towel around the worst of the bleeding on his arm, but it soaked through fast.

Every new dish was better than the last.

He’d carved meat from his thighs with the precision of a chef, searing it with a brown sugar rub. It tasted like pork belly kissed by hellfire.

Next he sliced off two of his toes with a kitchen knife—clean, careful cuts, just below the knuckles. Blood pooled around his foot, but he barely noticed. He was focused, methodical.

In the kitchen, he pulled out a bag of jasmine rice from the pantry, a bottle of rice vinegar from the back of a cabinet, and a half-used sheet of nori from the drawer where he kept random dry goods. He rinsed the rice, cooked it just right, and fanned it cool like he’d seen in videos.

He filleted the raw toe meat thin, arranging it over tight rolls with scallions, avocado slices, and a smear of wasabi. A splash of soy sauce on the side.

He ate at the table, cross-legged, using real chopsticks. Still plating like a pro—rolls lined up neatly, everything balanced. Like it mattered.

Blood gushed steadily from what was left of his feet, soaking into the floor beneath him, pooling under his ankles as he calmly chewed.

The high bent time out of shape. The clocks meant nothing. The light outside had shifted, but he hadn’t noticed when. Minutes bled into hours, or maybe it had been a full day—Danny couldn’t tell anymore.

The only thing he knew for sure was that dinner was done.

Now he needed something sweet. Something rich and warm, indulgent enough to drown out the hum still buzzing in his skull.

He needed dessert. 

He shuffled to the pantry, leaving sticky red footprints on the tile—ragged, uneven prints with toes missing, blood smearing where he limped. He grabbed flour, sugar, cocoa powder, and a half-used bag of chocolate chips. From a lower cabinet, he pulled out a muffin tin, a pie dish, and his old set of measuring cups—faded plastic, edges warped from years of heat.

Back at the counter, he took a breath, picked up the knife, and cut off his nose in a single, shaking motion. The cartilage crunched, blood gushed, but he barely flinched. He minced the nose finely and folded it into a rich brownie batter—melted chocolate, brown sugar, eggs, a splash of vanilla extract he found behind the olive oil. He poured the thick, glossy mix into a baking pan and slid it into the oven.

Next were the ears. He sawed them off one at a time, sliced them thin, and tossed them into a saucepan with butter and brown sugar. They simmered until soft, candied and coated in a sticky glaze. He spooned them over a vanilla custard tart he made with heavy cream and egg yolks, whisked together in a glass bowl he hadn’t used in years.

Then came the left eye.

He stood over the sink, breathing hard, and dug it out with the handle of a spoon. His vision blurred, blood ran down his cheek, but he held the slippery orb in his palm like something sacred. He diced it delicately and folded it into a dense almond cake batter—ground almonds from the freezer, sugar, eggs, and a bit of citrus zest he scraped from the last lonely lemon on the counter. He poured it into a ramekin and baked it until golden.

From the fridge, he grabbed the jar of maraschino cherries and drizzled the syrup across the finished desserts—brownie, tart, and almond cake. The final touch: a dusting of powdered sugar and a few curls of dark chocolate shaved from the last bar in the cupboard.

He sat at the table, blood running freely from his face, dripping off his chin and soaking the floor.

The brownies were rich and dense, the nose bits giving them a salty, savory chew. The tart was smooth and sweet, the candied ears melting slightly into the custard. The almond cake was perfect—moist, lightly sweet, with a subtle pop from the eye, like biting into a grape that had secrets.

He took bite after bite, his only eye fluttering shut.

Beautiful. Sweet. Enough.

Then the high began to slip.

It was subtle at first. A flicker of nausea. The whisper of pain getting louder. The smell of blood growing thicker, more metallic. The taste of himself—once divine—started to turn sour.

He looked down.

His legs were mangled. One thigh looked like it had been peeled like fruit. His feet were blue.

The hunger was gone. Replaced by horror.

The room spun, but it wasn’t the weed anymore. It was blood loss. Shock. The screaming pain finally caught up with him, and he started to panic.

He staggered toward the couch, legs trembling beneath him. His knees buckled, and he collapsed onto the floor, the impact jarring through his bones. Gritting his teeth, he clawed at the carpet, dragging himself forward inch by inch, each movement leaving a smear of blood in his wake.

Then—the front door creaked open, its hinges groaning in protest.

A sliver of light pierced the darkness, stretching across the room like a spotlight. The air shifted, carrying with it the scent of the outside world.

He froze, breath hitching, as the door inched wider, the sound of its movement echoing like a warning.


Chapter 6: Sobering Truth

Kyle stepped into the apartment, calling out half-assed.

“Yo, dude? You left the door unlocked—again.”

He kicked off his shoes, the soft thud reverberating in the stillness. A few steps in, his foot landed in something warm and slick. He froze.

Blood. Everywhere.

The stench hit him—a thick, metallic tang that clung to the back of his throat, mingled with the sourness of rot and the acrid scent of burnt flesh. His stomach lurched, the lucky charms cereal from breakfast started rising in his throat. 

He staggered back, hand covering his mouth. His voice trembled as he called out, “…Danny?”

He stepped deeper into the house, each footfall squelching against the sticky floor. The kitchen unfolded before him like a war zone—counters strewn with bloodied utensils, the air thick with the smell of burnt flesh and copper. The stove’s burners hissed, casting an eerie glow over the chaos. Pans overflowed with congealed fat and unidentifiable chunks, their contents seared into the metal.

Instinctively, he lunged forward and twisted the knobs to the off position, silencing the burners. The sudden quiet was deafening, amplifying the grotesque scene before him.

Amidst the carnage, remnants of baking were scattered across the countertops. A mixing bowl smeared with batter sat beside a tray of misshapen cookies, their edges charred. A dusting of flour coated the surfaces, now tinged pink from the blood that had seeped into it. Measuring cups lay overturned, their contents spilled and forgotten.

Out of the corner of his eye, he caught a flicker of movement. He turned his head sharply and saw Danny. 

He lay sprawled on the floor, barely conscious. His face was a mask of blood and bruises, but what made Kyle’s breath catch—was the gaping red wound where his left eye had been. 

“Dude…” Danny croaked, blood bubbling at the corner of his mouth. “I’m… so full.”

As Kyle stared in horror, Danny slowly lifted his mangled hand to his face and began to nibble at the stumps where his fingers had once been. His teeth worked meticulously, lips trembling, as if he were savoring the last bites of a decadent meal.

Kyle screamed, fumbling with his phone. His blood-slick fingers slipped across the screen as he tried to dial 911, the device nearly falling from his grasp.

“I need an ambulance! Now! My friend—he… he’s—oh fuck, he’s EATING HIMSELF!”

The operator tried to talk him through it, but Kyle wasn’t listening. He was pacing, sobbing, trying not to puke. He looked down at the coffee table and saw the bong—Veronica, still packed. Still warm.

“…fuck it,” Kyle muttered. “I need something to calm down.”

He lit it. Took a hit.

The smoke burned down hard.

Kyle exhaled slowly, the last tendrils of smoke curling from his lips. His eyes, half-lidded and glazed, scanned the room lazily.

A low rumble emanated from his stomach, breaking the silence. He blinked, a slow grin spreading across his face.

“Man,” he drawled, patting his belly. “I’m so hungry.”",2,1746277858.0,libraryofshadows,0,1.0,False

I got better though without any longer lasting symptoms. Then after a while, i think 4-6 months after my infection i couldnt smell right anymore. Everything food related smelled awful, onions were the worst. I think the smelling disorder is called ""parosmia"".
Also i felt really nauseas after eating and in the mornings.
I remember back then there wasnt a solution for my problem so i stopped looking for one and hoped it got better after couple weeks. Well it did get better after 10 months, i think 80% of my smell were restored and then the last 20% after 4 months.

But sadly the nausea after eating and in the morning or in stressful situations stayed

Later in winter 2023 i got covid again. I had a mild fever no other symptoms and i was fully recovered after couple hours.
Then in summer 2024 something weird happened.
I was working out as usual in my gym and i never struggled with hard workouts even. 
I did a typical hard workout and never felt this weird. I started to faint and breakdown, i started to shake and felt extreme nausea. It lasted for 2 hours. Luckily i had sweets to eat and water to drink.

After that i quit working out for about 2 weeks to fully recover and i didnt think much at the time, but since that workout i cant give my full 100% in workouts and i feel really tired after workouts. I just feel dizzy brainfog and tired like i could fall a sleep.
I also devoloped other symptoms in my day to day life that i never had before.
Like pollen allergy and the worst is heat intolerance. My body just doest tolerate heat anymore. I start to faint get extreme brainfog, its just aweful.
Oh and i cant trink Coffee aswell, i get brainfog dizzyness, which stopped when taking b vitamins, but i quit taking them because i think i got panic attacks from them, but im not sure at this point.
Im also anxious and really nervous, but maybe thats normal regarding how my life was before and how it is currently.

Do you guys think its LC or is it something else related to the last real workout i did? Maybe overtraining syndrom? Im going to check out a psycholigist for that one he also seems to treat a lot of LC patients. 

Today i want to try out an antihistamin, cetrizin, but im always so scared of side effects, like feeling anxious jittery and having panic attacks. These are the worst so im just planning to take a small dosage.

Diane stood outside DaVinci Pizzeria on 18th Avenue, just a couple of blocks from the Smoke Shop. The midnight air buzzed with the energy of Brooklyn’s nightlife—cars honking, people laughing, neon signs flickering. She was waiting for Ramon, her partner in crime, to hash out their next move. With Waldo’s ghost out of the picture, it was time to deal with Danny. They had two choices: frame Danny for Waldo’s murder by making it look like he spiked the coffee with oleandrin, or take him out the same way they did Waldo. Either way, the Smoke Shop would be theirs, lock, stock, and cigar. Danny was working the overnight shift at the shop, midnight to noon, while Diane had just finished her noon-to-midnight grind.
At 12:15 a.m., Ramon strolled up, his jet-black hair slicked back, his piercing brown eyes locking onto Diane’s like a hawk spotting dinner. They grabbed a couple of greasy pizza slices from the counter and slid into a booth at the back, away from prying eyes. Ramon, a few years younger than Diane, had a sharp, hungry look, like a guy who knew how to play dirty and enjoy it.
“So, what’s the plan?” Ramon asked, leaning in, his voice low but casual.
Diane toyed with her slice, her mind racing. “I’m not sure yet. Option one—pinning Waldo’s murder on Danny—feels so… wickedly clever. But we already put half the shop in my name, and we’re each other’s beneficiaries. Killing him would be simpler. Dead, we get everything.”
Her voice had a cold, scheming edge, like she’d stepped right out of a classic crime flick. Ramon chewed loudly on his pizza, DaVinci’s finest, and nodded. “Yeah, jail’s no good. If Danny’s locked up, he still owns half the shop. But dead? It’s all ours.”
He wiped his mouth with a napkin, then smirked. “What’s the deal with this ghost detective? This haunted nonsense at the shop is giving me the creeps.”
Diane rolled her eyes, picking at her crust. “This Julius Q. Bygone guy is supposedly chatting with Waldo’s ghost tonight. Last week, Waldo’s spirit knocked over a whole rack of magazines, which tipped a bucket of soapy water. Ruined half our stock—cost us a chunk of cash. Danny was Waldo’s best friend, so I bet the ghost’s got it out for him. Once Danny’s gone and Waldo feels avenged, he’ll float off to the pearly gates or wherever and leave me alone.”
She sighed, frustrated. “Bygone’s meeting us at the shop at 4 p.m. today to tell us how it went. I’m so over this—it’s driving me nuts. It’s not fair.”
Ramon leaned back, his grin turning playful, his eyes glinting with mischief. “Sounds like business is wrapped up for tonight. How about a little fun to take the edge off?”
Diane’s lips curled into a sly smile. “Yeah, I could use some fun after a day like this. Let’s get out of here.”
They tossed their paper plates, slipped out of the pizzeria, and vanished into the Brooklyn night, plotting and scheming with every step.",1,1746277739.0,u_glac1018,0,1.0,False

I have recently had a falling out with my mother, and it's something that I have been very vigilant and observant about, but also bit my tongue on for quite some time. Only recently have I lost my cool with her, which led to a falling out between her and myself.

When I come over to see my Mom (she works from home in the living room) during her working hours within weekdays (we are neighbours as I live one second away from her home), even when she's not busy and free away from calls and meetings within her working hours (which most of the time that's the case for her so she's chilling anyway), she either invites me in into her house or I will ring on her door to see if she's alright and just check in really, and instead of being an active listener and showing interest in our conversation, she immediately walks away and starts cleaning, hoovering, doing something without showing her face (but of course, she continues to drag the conversation by shouting over the rooms in her house as that's her way of communicating) directly at me that she is willing to listen. She then proceeds to go into the kitchen, and I have to raise my voice so she can hear me. In all honesty, it sounds a bit daft, but it feels like I am speaking to her ghost or the wall. Not very respectful, I think. And this is something that doesn't just happen with me, but also with my grandmother (since she and I share our home), and she also deals with a similar situation.

My mother (and I can't speak on her behalf) seems to be *always* busy and always on the go, but it can get out of hand, especially when you want to chill out with her and spend some quality family time, even when it's already been planned and is happening in the moment.

My mother was also very absent when I was born, she was extremely busy and away from the country due to her work demands and responsibilities. My father got up and went to the store to get some milk (ygm), and raising me was left to my grandparents (my mother's parents). So again, my mother was out of the picture for some time. She was only there temporarily, like blips in my memory banks, and then she'd go elsewhere.

One example here is - I took my Mom out for a coffee in a nice, fancy 5-star hotel restaurant a few months back. Within about sitting for roughly 15 minutes or so, my mother goes to me ""Drink up, we have to get going."" and I look at my watch and tell her ""What's the rush? Have you got to be someplace somewhere now?"" and she reponds ""No..."" and goes silent.

I have tried to tell her she has got to switch off because it seems like she's in a constant rush, 24/7, and then struggles to deal with stress management and her stuff. I guess that's how her mind works, and each to their own, but it feels sometimes very cold to just get to know her on a deeper level and spend some time with her, mother to son.

I'm 23 and she's 45, so she's relatively a young mother, but even then, when she isn't working or doing something that's in her diary/schedule or agenda for the day, she seems to be always caught up in something, or be ""aggressively"" interested in tackling another task out of thin air which hasn't been spoken about, for instance she's extremely impulsive with decision making on the spot, and each decision is always met with this *whooosh* of aggression and **IT NEEDS TO BE DONE NOW** kind of attitude, if you get me. She likes to be hard working, even when the time isn't there, but it's hard to socialize and bond with her.

My late grandfather (my mom's father), when he was alive, also had a very similar mindset and attitude as my mother, only he was more rational and sensible sometimes. I know my grandfather spent a lot of time with my mom whilst she was growing up, which might have had an impact on her personality in her later years, since he raised her more as a son than a daughter, and maybe this is my mothers' internal everlasting grievance towards him by her adapting her personality and attitude in life to him (she even tells me and my grandmother when she does things, for example ""it's what he'd do"", like trying to be a reincarnation or second version of him or something), which further escalates into situations like these where my mother isn't being very motherly, and it's very hard to bond and spend time with her.

Anyway, so a couple of days ago, I had a small ""crashout"" of sorts, by acting the same way and mirroring her behavior back towards her, when she came over to my house this time (to see my grandmother), and she then had a go at me and started asking me ""What's wrong?"", where I simply said ""I'm just acting and behaving the way you do, because I've had enough."" and I walked away. She, of course, was taken back by this and retaliated by talking to herself, and she walked off and left the house. That was the last time we spoke.

Apologies for this long-winded story, but I just don't know what I should do...

* **Affordable Base Fares**: Sun Country's ticket prices are often lower than those of major carriers, making it attractive to budget-conscious travelers.
* **Complimentary Non-Alcoholic Beverages**: Unlike some ultra-low-cost carriers (ULCCs), Sun Country offers free soft drinks, coffee, and tea during flights.
* **Local Snack and Drink Options**: The airline features Minnesota-made snacks and drinks, like Fulton beer and Dot’s Pretzels, adding a local touch to the onboard experience.
* **USB Charging and Streaming Entertainment**: Most aircraft come equipped with USB ports and provide streaming in-flight entertainment.

# ⚠️ Common Complaints and Drawbacks

* **Frequent Delays and Cancellations**: Passengers have frequently reported delays and last-minute cancellations, sometimes with limited support or notice.
* **Customer Service Issues**: Many travelers have cited poor communication and unhelpful service during flight disruptions or booking problems.
* **Additional Fees**: While the initial fare is low, extra charges for carry-on bags, seat selection, and other add-ons can quickly increase the total cost.
* **Inconsistent In-Flight Experience**: Some customers mention uncomfortable seats, limited amenities, and varying service quality across flights.

# 🧾 Overall Assessment

Sun Country Airlines is a reasonable option for travelers seeking low-cost flights—especially on direct routes. However, if reliability, seamless service, or baggage flexibility is a priority, you may want to consider full-service carriers. Always read the fine print and prepare for possible disruptions.",1,1746277451.0,AltitudeTalk,0,1.0,False

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it’s time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero’s journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can’t even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don’t wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

1kdsduh,https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearningjerk/comments/1kdsduh/youll_never_be_fluent_in_english/,You’ll Never Be Fluent in English,"When I first got to the US, I thought learning English would be a breeze. I downloaded apps, bought online courses, and even enrolled in a school that promised fluency in three months. But you know how it goes: memorizing grammar, parroting random phrases, and still freezing up when talking to a native speaker. It was frustrating. I felt stuck, like my dream of advancing my career was slipping through my fingers.  

After wasting time and money, I realized the problem: those methods were artificial. That’s not how people actually speak English. So, I started chatting with natives — friends, coworkers, even strangers at the coffee shop. Swapping stories, laughing at bad jokes, picking up slang. That’s what really helped me improve. Every conversation was a living lesson, and little by little, I stopped stumbling over words and started feeling confident.  

Now, I speak English fearlessly, and my career has taken off. But I know a lot of you are still in the same struggle I was: fed up with false promises and methods that don’t deliver. If you’ve ever felt this way, ever wondered “why is this so hard?”, I totally get you. You’ll never be fluent in English if you keep relying on those artificial methods that don’t prepare you for real life. Want to know how I actually learned, without robots or boring classes?

1kdsd6h,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1kdsd6h/aita_my_mother_is_avoiding_me_when_i_come_over/,AITA - My mother is avoiding me when I come over and visit her.,"Hey all,

I have recently had a falling out with my mother, and it’s something I’ve been very observant about, though I bit my tongue for quite some time. Only recently did I lose my cool with her, which led to our falling out.

When I drop by during her workday (we’re neighbours - my house is next door), even when she’s free from calls and meetings, she’ll either invite me in or I’ll ring her bell just to check in. Instead of listening, she immediately walks away to clean or hoover, shouting answers from another room. Sometimes she retreats to the kitchen, and I have to raise my voice for her to hear me. It feels like speaking to a ghost or a wall - hardly respectful. This happens not only with me but also with my grandmother, who lives with me.

My mother seems constantly busy and “on the go,” which makes planned quality time go out the window even when we’re together.

She was also largely absent when I was born - often abroad for work - so my grandparents raised me. She’d appear as brief blips in my memory, then disappear again.

A few months ago, I took her for coffee at a fancy hotel. After about 15 minutes, she said, “Drink up, we have to get going.” I asked, “What’s the rush? Do you have somewhere to be?” She replied, “No…” and went silent.

I’ve told her she needs to switch off. She seems to run on adrenaline 24/7 and struggles with stress management. That mindset feels cold when all I want is to spend time with her. 

I’m 23 and she’s 45, so she’s a young mother, but even when unscheduled, she’s impulsive and switches tasks on the spot with an “it needs doing now” aggression. She prides herself on hard work, even at the expense of socialising. She doesn't have many friends herself either, so she's quite lonely. 

My late grandfather (her father) had a similar drive but was more rational. He raised her “like a son,” and she often says, “It’s what he’d do,” as if trying to reincarnate him. Perhaps she internalised him and now loses her “motherly” side, making bonding difficult.

A couple of days ago, I lost my cool with her, mirroring her behaviour when she visited (to see my grandmother). She asked, “What’s wrong?” I replied, “I’m just treating you the way you treat me, and I’ve had enough,” and walked away. She talked to herself, left, and we haven’t spoken since.

Sorry for the long-winded story, but I don’t know what to do. Am I the A\*\*hole, or is she? Should I reach out first and apologise, or wait for her to break the ice?",13,1746277105.0,AmItheAsshole,22,0.93,False

My ex and i both got sober in college, got married after living together for a few years and have 2 kids. After she gave birth to our 2nd child,  things started changing. In 2022, we bought a house and 2 months later, she started having an emotional affair online with her college ex ( i found out because our phones uploaded data to our home server every night). The next year was her wanting to leave one week then crying and apologizing the next, while claiming her love for me and using sex as a manipulation tactic to smooth over everything, (realized this after the fact). This is all while she was a sahm as she chose to be.
Now we are separated, working on divorce, trying to coparent, but i mostly take care of our kids. I love my children and have them most of the time as she is living at her apartment and trying to relive her lost college days while putting the kids 2nd to everything.  She has her college ex as her bf who lives two states away, doesnt have a car or license, lives with his ex and her husband, and works pt at a coffee shop (she was happy to tell me all this). 
So, has anyone seen their spouse go through the same or just grenade their whole life while trying to chase a dream of yesteryear?? Or have the same kind of thing happened?",81,1746277072.0,Millennials,83,0.88,False

Most of the scaffold firms I’ve worked for are still using WhatsApp, paper, or random spreadsheets to manage jobs, track rental weeks, or send invoices — and stuff gets forgotten or done late.

I’m working on a web service tool that automates a lot of this, all the while integrating with your current accounting software as a scaffold centric extension to services like Xero to price things the way scaffolders price things. Here's what it would do:

*Attached is an early image of the dashboard during testing phase for visualization*

**From your side, it would let you:**

* Create a job in under 2 minutes with a simple form (what site, lump sum or rental, start date, extras etc.)
* Track every active job in a dashboard (like a board with cards — job name, how much it’s earning, when rent invoices are due etc.)
* Automatically handle the sending of those invoices by integrating with the accounting systems you're already using, so your Xero account is connected and sending an invoice in my site sends it in Xero
* Drastically improve cash flow by sending and following up invoices automatically
* Reduce missed billings to 0
* Localise your project management, financial data and invoicing process to one easy to use dashboard

**Automatically send invoices based on your chosen setup:**

* Lump sum (one-off)
* Rental (weekly invoices with start/stop dates)
* Jobs with phased payments (e.g., 50% upfront, 50% after dismantle)
* Even combination jobs, e.g., deposit>day rate> weekly hire and VO's all together across months of weekly invoicing
* And many more, flexibility is a priority for me, things change last minute and we can handle that

**It would also:**

* Have live job updates, to pause, cancel, review, change things, delay, all the flexibility that construction projects need
* Remind you when jobs are overdue or rental needs stopping
* Prevent missed payments by tracking every site, every week
* Let you mark jobs as completed/paused/cancelled
* Sync with Xero, QuickBooks, or Sage to send your **professionally formatted invoices from your email automatically**
* Work on your phone, not just desktop
* Automatically follow up email lay paying clients at regular intervals
* The above would allow you to massively improve cash flow, make forgetting an invoice a thing of the past and localise your entire project management and financial software to one dashboard that's easy to use and built specifically for scaffolders to have easy flexible admin anyone can use

**Why I’m building it:**

I’ve seen firms forget to charge 2–3 weeks of rental because someone forgot to stop it or lost track. That’s money gone.

I’m trying to build something that makes invoicing automatic and easy, so the lads can scaffold and the admin doesn’t pile up.

It’s aimed at 1–5 truck firms, small ops, owner-run companies where the boss is juggling the site and the office at once.

I have always known I will be my own boss and starting a firm seemed like too much investment cost for my circumstances so I stepped back, recognised a niche, targeted a market, learnt the skills and got to it, this way its less start up cost and more scalable anyway.

**Unique Strengths I bring to the market:**

This will knock hours off your admins schedule, whether its you or an employee. Many admins are also on the tools and this would free them up for more tool time, or to do other admin work.

It’s aimed at 1–5 truck firms, small ops, owner-run companies where the boss is juggling the site and the office at once.

I have always known I will be my own boss and starting a firm seemed like too much investment cost for my circumstances so I stepped back, recognised a niche, targeted a market, learnt the skills and got to it, this way its less start up cost and more scalable anyway.

**Unique Strengths I bring to the market:**

This will knock hours off your admins schedule, whether its you or an employee. Many admins are also on the tools and this would free them up for more tool time, or to do other admin work. Or if its you who does it for your own company, grab a coffee, dart home and see the kids or maybe do a bit more tool time yourself.  


This was built by someone who knows the trade and the industry, you don't want something like this that was built by someone who's never had to carry a bucket of doubles up 10 lifts, I'm not a swanky oxford grad I'm a young hard working qualified scaffolder taking my life into my own hands and building a business in the evenings, I've been working on it for just over 4 months already and I estimate to still be a few months away from launch.

  
My goal in pricing is to make my software save so much time it affords itself, if it saves you paying an admin £20 an hour even 1 hour a week that's £80 and add on top of that no missed billings and better cash flow, my projected price point of £45 should be a steal.  
  
  
I plan to expand, these are just the plans for launch, I plan on scaling it to handle absolutely everything from journey planning to kit management, to RAMS writing, Ai is incredibly capable already and I plan to use it to optimise every single part of your business.  
  
**What I’m looking for:**

Just want to know if anyone’s interested in using something like this when it’s ready, or if you'd be open to giving some feedback now while I build it.

If you do, I’ll give you lifetime free access to the software as thanks. No catch — I just need to make sure it's useful for real scaffold firms and not just in my head.

Planning to launch a lifetime free early access scheme to try it out no strings just to get some testimonials and feedback.

**Early contribution incentives:**

*Pre launch opinions and criticism* \- First 3 months free

*Early access users* \- Lifetime free access including updates and premium in the future

*Post launch early adaptors* \- First month free trial, free upgrade to premium upon release

Absolutely any feedback or input is like gold to me, your word is gospel as far as I'm concerned when building this, thank you for your time

Let me know if it sounds useful, or if you’d change/add anything. Appreciate it lads 👊",2,1746276826.0,Scaffolding,0,1.0,False

First off feudal Japan in AC? Sign me up immediately. I’ve been a fan since I first snuck a few minutes on my friend’s controller, marveling at rooftop runs and hidden blades. Yet somehow I’ve never actually owned a single AC title, wild I know. Then the Shadows trailer hit and I nearly spit out my iced coffee. Two playable heroes Yasuke the trailblazing samurai and Naoe the stealthy kunoichi exploring Edo’s temples and tea houses? My hype meter went off the charts.

So why can’t I just buy it myself? Well I’m a 19 year old student surviving on ramen budgets and overpriced textbooks and my household isn’t exactly handing out gaming consoles like party favors. I’ve literally never owned one. So now i turn to you guys in hope, wishing to experience this amazing game. With my part time job barely covering costs for me and stress of school, I know this game would be perfect for me to cool off. 

Also it’s on discount right now with the code **legend** for ten dollars off on Ubisoft Connect so if anyone is feeling extra generous and could gift it I would be beyond grateful.

1kds606,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kds606/my_mother_is_avoiding_me_when_i_come_over_and/,My mother is avoiding me when I come over and visit her.,"Hey all,

I have recently had a falling out with my mother, and it's something that I have been very vigilant and observant about, but also bit my tongue on for quite some time. Only recently have I lost my cool with her, which led to a falling out between her and myself.

When I come over to see my Mom (she works from home in the living room) during her working hours within weekdays (we are neighbours as I live one second away from her home), even when she's not busy and free away from calls and meetings within her working hours (which most of the time that's the case for her so she's chilling anyway), she either invites me in into her house or I will ring on her door to see if she's alright and just check in really, and instead of being an active listener and showing interest in our conversation, she immediately walks away and starts cleaning, hoovering, doing something without showing her face (but of course, she continues to drag the conversation by shouting over the rooms in her house as that's her way of communicating) directly at me that she is willing to listen. She then proceeds to go into the kitchen, and I have to raise my voice so she can hear me. In all honesty, it sounds a bit daft, but it feels like I am speaking to her ghost or the wall. Not very respectful, I think. And this is something that doesn't just happen with me, but also with my grandmother (since she and I share our home), and she also deals with a similar situation.

My mother (and I can't speak on her behalf) seems to be *always* busy and always on the go, but it can get out of hand, especially when you want to chill out with her and spend some quality family time, even when it's already been planned and is happening in the moment.

My mother was also very absent when I was born, she was extremely busy and away from the country due to her work demands and responsibilities. My father got up and went to the store to get some milk (ygm), and raising me was left to my grandparents (my mother's parents). So again, my mother was out of the picture for some time. She was only there temporarily, like blips in my memory banks, and then she'd go elsewhere.

One example here is - I took my Mom out for a coffee in a nice, fancy 5-star hotel restaurant a few months back. Within about sitting for roughly 15 minutes or so, my mother goes to me ""Drink up, we have to get going."" and I look at my watch and tell her ""What's the rush? Have you got to be someplace somewhere now?"" and she reponds ""No..."" and goes silent.

I have tried to tell her she has got to switch off because it seems like she's in a constant rush, 24/7, and then struggles to deal with stress management and her stuff. I guess that's how her mind works, and each to their own, but it feels sometimes very cold to just get to know her on a deeper level and spend some time with her, mother to son.

I'm 23 and she's 45, so she's relatively a young mother, but even then, when she isn't working or doing something that's in her diary/schedule or agenda for the day, she seems to be always caught up in something, or be ""aggressively"" interested in tackling another task out of thin air which hasn't been spoken about, for instance she's extremely impulsive with decision making on the spot, and each decision is always met with this *whooosh* of aggression and **IT NEEDS TO BE DONE NOW** kind of attitude, if you get me. She likes to be hard working, even when the time isn't there, but it's hard to socialize and bond with her.

My late grandfather (my mom's father), when he was alive, also had a very similar mindset and attitude as my mother, only he was more rational and sensible sometimes. I know my grandfather spent a lot of time with my mom whilst she was growing up, which might have had an impact on her personality in her later years, since he raised her more as a son than a daughter, and maybe this is my mothers' internal everlasting grievance towards him by her adapting her personality and attitude in life to him (she even tells me and my grandmother when she does things, for example ""it's what he'd do"", like trying to be a reincarnation or second version of him or something), which further escalates into situations like these where my mother isn't being very motherly, and it's very hard to bond and spend time with her.

Anyway, so a couple of days ago, I had a small ""crashout"" of sorts, by acting the same way and mirroring her behavior back towards her, when she came over to my house this time (to see my grandmother), and she then had a go at me and started asking me ""What's wrong?"", where I simply said ""I'm just acting and behaving the way you do, because I've had enough."" and I walked away. She, of course, was taken back by this and retaliated by talking to herself, and she walked off and left the house. That was the last time we spoke.

Apologies for this long-winded story, but I just don't know what I should do...

Am I being the A\*\*hole here, or is she in the wrong? Do I reach out to her first and apologize, or do I wait for her to come around and sit down with me? Who reaches out first to whom and breaks the ice?",1,1746276460.0,family,1,1.0,False

 ## Key Features Analysis

The defining features of quality Iced Mocha ASMR Porn revolve around sensory detail, technical production, and artistic direction. The most effective content prioritizes high-quality audio and visual elements to maximize the ASMR effect.

**Audio Fidelity:** The quality of the audio recording is paramount in ASMR content. The microphone sensitivity and clarity must be exceptional to capture the subtle sounds of ice clinking, liquid pouring, and whisks stirring. Producers should utilize professional-grade microphones with appropriate pop filters and noise reduction to minimize extraneous sounds and maximize the impact of the intended triggers.

**Visual Clarity and Composition:** High-definition video resolution (4K or higher) is essential for displaying the visual elements of the iced mocha preparation in detail. Sharp focus, balanced lighting, and thoughtful composition are crucial for capturing the texture of ingredients, the layering of the drink, and the overall aesthetic appeal. The use of macro lenses can enhance the visual impact by showcasing minute details like the swirling of cream or the condensation on the glass.

**Performance Artistry:** The performer's movements and interactions with the ingredients should be deliberate and graceful. Slow, controlled motions and gentle handling of objects are vital for creating a calming and sensual atmosphere. The performer's facial expressions and eye contact contribute significantly to the overall engagement and intimacy of the experience.

**Ingredient Selection and Styling:** The choice of ingredients and the styling of the final product significantly impact the visual appeal. Freshly brewed espresso, high-quality chocolate syrup, and aesthetically pleasing ice cubes are essential. The presentation of the iced mocha, including the choice of glassware and garnishes, should be carefully considered to create a visually enticing and stimulating experience.

**Editing and Pacing:** The editing process plays a crucial role in shaping the overall flow and impact of the ASMR experience. Seamless transitions, strategic use of slow motion, and careful selection of background music (if any) can enhance the sensory stimulation and create a more immersive and engaging viewing experience. The pacing should be deliberate and unhurried, allowing the viewer to fully appreciate each step of the preparation process.

# Best Iced Tea Spoons 2025: Reviews & Buying Guide

Iced tea spoons, often overlooked, are essential for stirring tall glasses of iced beverages. These elongated spoons are designed to reach the bottom of pitchers and glasses, ensuring even distribution of sweeteners, flavorings, and ice. The right iced tea spoon elevates the drinking experience and adds a touch of elegance to any occasion.

[[Browse top-rated iced tea spoons on Amazon]](https://petsknows.com/hot-selling-items/?kw=iced+tea+spoons)
 ## Key Features Analysis

The best iced tea spoons offer a blend of durability, style, and practicality. Key features to consider include the material, length, handle design, and ease of cleaning. High-quality options will enhance your iced beverage experience, making stirring and serving a pleasure.

**Material:** Stainless steel is the most common material for iced tea spoons, known for its durability, resistance to rust and corrosion, and ease of maintenance.

Stainless steel iced tea spoons are available in various grades, with 18/10 stainless steel offering the best combination of chromium and nickel for superior corrosion resistance and a lustrous finish. The thickness of the stainless steel also impacts the spoon's durability and weight, with heavier spoons generally feeling more substantial and long-lasting. Some spoons may feature a gold or silver plating for a more elegant appearance, but these options require more careful handling to prevent scratching or tarnishing.

**Length:** The ideal length for an iced tea spoon typically ranges from 7.5 to 9 inches, allowing it to reach the bottom of most tall glasses and pitchers.

Shorter spoons may be inadequate for stirring beverages in taller glassware, while excessively long spoons can be cumbersome and difficult to maneuver. Consider the height of your typical glasses and pitchers when selecting the appropriate length. Some manufacturers offer extra-long iced tea spoons specifically designed for larger pitchers or novelty glasses.

**Handle Design:** The handle design affects the comfort and grip of the spoon. Ergonomic handles provide a comfortable and secure hold, reducing the risk of slippage.

Handles can be rounded, squared, or tapered, and may feature decorative elements such as grooves, ridges, or embossed patterns. Some spoons have a simple, minimalist design, while others are more ornate. Consider your personal preferences and the overall aesthetic of your existing flatware when choosing a handle design. A well-designed handle will not only enhance the appearance of the spoon but also improve its functionality.

**Spoon Bowl Shape:** The shape of the spoon bowl influences how efficiently it stirs and scoops ingredients.

A slightly concave bowl with a smooth edge is ideal for stirring beverages and scooping ice or fruit. Some iced tea spoons feature a pointed tip on the bowl, which can be useful for piercing fruit slices or dislodging ice cubes. The size of the bowl should be proportionate to the length of the spoon, ensuring that it can hold an adequate amount of liquid or solids without being too bulky. A well-designed bowl will make stirring and serving iced tea easier and more enjoyable.

**Ease of Cleaning:** Iced tea spoons should be easy to clean, either by hand or in the dishwasher.

Stainless steel spoons are generally dishwasher safe, but it's important to follow the manufacturer's instructions to prevent damage or discoloration. Spoons with intricate designs or decorative plating may require hand washing to maintain their appearance. Look for spoons with smooth surfaces and minimal crevices, as these are less likely to trap food particles and easier to clean. Proper cleaning and maintenance will ensure that your iced tea spoons remain in good condition for years to come.

Key features of excellent iced tea spoons include:
    * Durable stainless steel construction
    * Optimal length for tall glasses and pitchers
    * Ergonomic handle design for comfortable grip
    * Well-shaped spoon bowl for efficient stirring
    * Easy to clean and maintain

**Efficient Mixing:** Iced tea spoons are designed to thoroughly mix ingredients in tall glasses, ensuring a consistent and enjoyable flavor.

Investing in durable iced tea spoons means you won't have to replace them frequently, saving you money in the long run.

1kds152,https://www.reddit.com/r/HireAGirlfriend/comments/1kds152/offer_looking_for_a_real_genuine_connection_with/,[OFFER] looking for a real & genuine connection with someone who wants to get to know me on a personal level♥️,"

Hey, I’m Mia! I’m “Gold Verified.” I’m offering a girlfriend experience that’s centered around authentic connection, not just a transactional dynamic. I’m someone who truly values real chemistry and meaningful conversations that feel natural and fulfilling. This isn’t about “going through the motions” for me. Im not looking to play a role, I wont put on a show and not interested in playing pretend. I love to laugh, and I want someone I can really laugh with, I’m talking about that real - genuine - stomach hurts - spit your coffee out - type of laughter 😆 . A girlfriend experience with me looks like those kinds of laughs, often. It looks like having someone you can talk to, confide in, and share honest, genuine experiences with.

Let’s be real, “spicy” content can be bought anywhere and most of it is free to look at anyway lol. I don’t want someone who prioritizes that over meaningful connection. connection is the real luxury, here. I’d like to do this with someone who understands that, and someone who wants to connect with me emotionally and intimately. Yes, we’ll have an “understanding” - but I’m looking for something that feels less like a transaction and more like a real connection. The kind where we both feel seen, supported, and appreciated.

Outside of this, my life is really fulfilling. Im career oriented, but in my spare time I’m probably enjoying an Italian dinner w/ family, on a hike w/ my pups, hitting the beach in the summer, binge watching a show, or curled up on the couch (in oversized sweats) reading a book or writing my novel. I thrive on good energy & spontaneous adventures. If you like a woman who’s full of life, a little bold, and always ready to lift you up, hey..we might just click. Im a social butterfly, but I also get along with people who are more introverted. It would be cool to do this with someone who matches my energy, but sometimes the best connections are the ones where opposites balance each other out. 

Overall..I’m down to earth, low drama, and I like to think I bring something different to the table. I pride myself on being real and one of a kind. If you’ve actually read this far, chances are you’re exactly the kind of person I’d love to hear from. 

Curious? Good.  😏 Send me a message to find out more.

That’s when I discovered **SLIM BOOST TEA** – a supplement designed to **restore metabolism health** (the energy factories inside your cells) and help fight fatigue, inflammation, and aging at the cellular level.

**⚡ What is SLIM BOOST TEA?**

Pre Workout: I drank black coffee & 2 Dates.

On the workout: I ate 9 Dates starting at minute 70 until the end of the EMOM + water.

Feelings throughout the workout:

  
Minutes 1-30: Felt nice, nothing more to add

Minutes 30-60: Hands were on fire, every set was mentally exhausting, minutes felt like hours, fingers were starting to feel numb and close themselves, I used an ice pack while resting to relieve the pain from now on until the end.

Minutes 60-100: My mind was broken, I cried like a bitch from now until the end, I doubted myself, wanted to quit, my hands were in the worst pain I ever felt, callouses were red at this point.

  
Minutes 100-120: The pain in my hands didn't change (still same than 60-100) I screamed to myself, trying to give me self confidence to finish the workout, every set was a victory from this point, counting every single one as if I had saved a puppy. 

  
Technique/Form: I adopted the same form David used for his record (link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrNgJTv-Qn4) And I have pride on the fact that I kept it and didn't cheat.

1kdry1r,https://www.reddit.com/r/RetirementReady/comments/1kdry1r/how_to_enroll_in_medicare_part_a_and_part_b/,How to Enroll in Medicare Part A and Part B Before Retirement: A Step-by-Step Guide,"**Hey, RetirementReady family!** 🌟

Ever found yourself staring at the massive pile of paperwork that comes with planning for retirement, thinking, “Is it really time for this?!” Trust me, you’re not alone! But let's tackle one of the big ones today: **enrolling in Medicare Part A and Part B.** 🎉

Picture this: you’re sipping your morning coffee, flipping through travel brochures, and suddenly realize—*wait, how do I sign up for Medicare?* If that sounds familiar, you’ve clicked on the right post!

### **Let’s break it down step-by-step, shall we?**

**1. Know Your Enrollment Periods**  
   - **Initial Enrollment Period (IEP):** This is your golden window, folks! It starts **3 months before** you turn 65 and lasts for **3 months after** your birthday month.
   - **Special Enrollment Period (SEP):** Got delayed? If you were covered by an employer plan, you might qualify for this. Just keep an eye out for the details!

**2. Gather Your Info**  
   Before you pull out the metaphorical confetti, make sure you’ve got:
   - Your social security number
   - Your tax information (just in case)
   - The dates of your current health coverage plans (if applicable)

**3. Decide on Benefits**  
   - **Part A:** This usually covers hospital insurance. Most people get it premium-free if they’ve worked for 10 years.
   - **Part B:** This one’s all about outpatient care like doctor visits and some preventive services. Remember, this one usually comes with a monthly premium, so budget accordingly!

**4. Sign Up!** 🎊  
   You can enroll online, by phone, or in person. Check this out:
   - **Online:** Head over to the Social Security Administration’s website. They’ve streamlined a lot of the process.
   - **Phone:** Not a fan of technology? Call the SSA directly. They’re there to help (even if you got on hold with elevator music for a bit)!
   - **In Person:** If you’re more of a face-to-face person, find your local SSA office and head over.

**5. Confirm Your Enrollment**  
   Don’t skip this step! You’ll want to make sure everything’s been processed. Keep an eye out for your Medicare card showing up in the mail—it’s kind of a big deal. 

**6. Get Educated!**  
   After signing up, dive into what Part A and Part B cover. It’s easy to think it’s a “set it and forget it” situation, but understanding your benefits can save you time, money, and *a lot* of headaches later on.

### **A Little Humor to Lighten the Load!**  
If enrollment deadlines were as easy to remember as your favorite TV show’s premiere dates, wouldn’t that be great? 🙈

---

Even if it seems daunting at first, just take it one step at a time. Just think: every small step you take today is one less thing to worry about later. Enjoy the journey to retirement; it’s going to be fabulous! ✨ 

And hey, whether you found this super easy or kind of confusing (or both!), you’re not alone in this. What part of the Medicare process makes you scratch your head? Or maybe you’ve got a hilarious story from navigating the system? Let’s chat!",1,1746275745.0,RetirementReady,0,1.0,False

1kdrp2y,https://i.redd.it/opdzsdmv7kye1.jpeg,This is so annoying,"Asked a coffee guy what machine I should buy to upgrade my cup. Told him I didn’t need any technology, wifi, Bluetooth crap, etc. he recommended this. Little things I find annoying are that the carafe has no markers on it. Making a pot of coffee was as easy as filling it to the line and dumping it in the machine. Now I have to ballpark it, go back to the sink to dump the rest. Just an added step. The real problem is when I try to make over 6 cups I have to watch the thing the entire time so that it doesn’t overflow. Today I had to shut it off twice to let it “catch up”. It makes a good cup of coffee, no doubt, but really I was told this was a “no frills” machine. Having to watch the entire brew cycles is quite annoying. 

For 6 cups I did 55g of ground beans, set at “25” on the rancilio rocky grinder.

I am currently looking for a roommate to take over the second bedroom in a 2-bed/1-bath apartment in Hell’s Kitchen. This apartment is really a gem and both my current roommate and I absolutely love it!

A little about me: I am a 25-year-old third-year law student (soon to be 26-year-old law graduate) and will working nearby. I’m easygoing, respectful, and big on creating a warm, supportive, and clean space. I will be working four days in the office and Fridays remotely! If you’re new to the city, I love meeting new people and doing new things together, so happy to help you feel settled in.

I'm hoping to find someone who is friendly, responsible, clean, and open to building a balance between a fun and chill vibe at home! I like being friends or friendly with my roommate, whether that’s a movie night together, going out to dinner, or just checking in at the end of the day and talking while we cook. I also love open communication, so guests, sharing things, etc. are totally okay with a heads up and I would do the same.

This apartment really is amazing and has a lot of charm. It’s in a great location, near the 50th C/E and 1 subway stops, and the 49th NWR stop, so very easy to get to other parts of the city. Central Park is about an 11-minute walk and the waterfront is only a few avenues over! There’s a lot of bars, restaurants, and coffee shops in this area as well as Trader Joe’s is only a 20-minute walk uptown. In terms of everything else:

\-The bedrooms are huge and are at opposite ends of each other, so there’s a lot of privacy. You would have two huge closets + gorgeous view of the city

\-There’s a true living room, kitchen, and bathroom space (everything is basically furnished – we would just need to get a couch + stuff for your bedroom)

1kdrjmg,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLettersRaw/comments/1kdrjmg/stop_squandering_me/,Stop squandering me,"     I didn't need to be up this morning because this is my hard earned day off. I would not mind taking you to work, in someone else's car or otherwise; I would not mind most any request at this hour- if you were actually nice and not aggressively attention- seeking and downright mean to me before i could even open my eyes. I know this is hard. Why do you insist on making it worse on us both?

     Do you know how long I've been unhappy? Do you know why I'm so often this way? Nobody wants to be squandered.  I have supported your personal development and this struggle we call life for over a decade.  It doesn't matter what i do or how long you keep that mask on, sooner or later you'll turn into a fucking jerk. 
Here's an idea: when someone supports you financially almost single handedly to help the the union get on their feet again, first by putting it all on the line for yours or their dream, then again for survival upon being confronted with how stuck they truly are, you don't rant at them while they're sleeping. You don't gripe them out at 2 a.m. for not successfully waking you for the dinner they helped make.  You didn't see that i cleaned the tub or made 2 trips to the store to ensure you had food for both night and morning, nice coffee first thing.  You don't ever get wake someone that way unless there's a legitimate emergency. You respect that your human needs sleep and does not ever want to wake up to being talked to like they're garbage. 

    I shouldn't even be up and alert right now. I should not have had to wake up to negativity being aimed directly at me, at full volume, only to be asked for a favour minutes later. Now you're quiet. Now you feel bad. And I'm sad and resentful. That's great for a healthy relationship, in'nit? 

     Stop squandering me. I know I'm pretty much all you have left. I never asked to be. I know you need someone to talk to. You, like everyone else on the planet, have to wait until the person you need contact with/ communication from needs to be prepared and willing to share their space with you. You don't get to disrupt someone's entire day from the very beginning- a most crucial part of how that day plays out-  then guilt that same person for enforcing that boundary. I bend over backwards for you on worn joints. I kiss your ass and this is my thanks. You fucking idiot.  I don't want to be a painful memory and another reminder of your failures. Why don't you start acting like you don't want that either.

      Happiness is only in dreams that I'm prevented from reveling in because of your screams.",2,1746274407.0,UnsentLettersRaw,2,1.0,False

1kdrjj3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1kdrjj3/might_the_melitta_64007_pour_over_coffee_maker_be/,Might the Melitta 64007 Pour Over Coffee Maker Be Worth Your Investment? Review Inside!,"I’ve been testing the Melitta 64007 1 Cup Black Pour-Over Coffee Brew Cone for a while now, and it feels like a compact revolution in how I approach my morning coffee breaks. Let’s dive into everything this little device delivers, and yes, what holds it back.

**Compact Design with Practicality at Its Core**  
This coffee maker caught my attention the moment I unpacked it. Weighing in at just 2.72 ounces, it practically disappears when stored, making it ideal for small kitchens, offices, or even travel. The durable plastic construction isn’t fancy, but it’s sturdy. The simple cone design doesn’t look overly complicated, and yet, its minimalism adds charm. Its dimensions of 6 x 5 x 4 inches make it feel like the espresso equivalent of those pocket-sized dictionaries you’d carry around in school. Bonus: No electronics to fail, which is always a win in my eyes.

**Experience the Brewing Process**  
Using a pour-over coffee maker is, let’s call it, a bit of an art form. With this model, I’ve learned to enjoy the ritual of pouring hot water in circular motions while the aroma slowly develops. The cone design feels intuitive; hot water extracts the flavors evenly through the coffee grounds. Not gonna lie, my coworker was impressed enough to mention it smelled like those boutique cafes we can’t afford during payday weeks. A small reminder, though: you’ll need #2 cone filters, so don’t forget to stock up.

**Perks**  
- Extremely lightweight and portable.  
- Simple and intuitive brewing process.  
- Perfect for a single cup without wasting coffee.  
- Dishwasher-safe, which is an underrated feature.

**Performance in Everyday Use**  
If you’re someone like me who values a fresh cup of coffee over brewing in bulk, this cone suits you perfectly. Each use gives you control over your coffee’s strength and flavor. The lighter blends let the fruity and acidic notes shine through, while darker roasts develop a bold richness. That said, if you expect it to magically turn low-quality beans into something spectacular, it won’t. This gadget respects the quality of ingredients you throw in.

**Favorable Features**  
- Adjustable strength based on water flow pacing and grind size.  
- Brews a full-flavored cup comparable to pricier systems.  
- Easy to rinse clean between uses.  

**Caveats**  
- It’s designed strictly for one cup; don’t expect batch brewing.  
- Plastic material might not appeal to eco-conscious individuals.  
- Heat retention depends on your mug's insulation, as the cone holds no heat itself.  
- Requires consistent practice for optimal flavor extraction.  

**Product Rivals**  
While testing the pour-over cone, I couldn’t help but benchmark it against other single-serve solutions like the Hario V60 and the Kalita Wave. The Hario feels a touch more premium due to its ceramic material and slightly larger opening for water flow. That said, the Melitta Brew Cone is far cheaper and much lighter, perfect for portability. Against the Kalita Wave, this one’s more beginner-friendly as you don’t have to think too deeply about technique. However, Kalita fans would argue the flat-bottom design provides more consistent extraction than the conical one.

**Money’s Worth**  
Cost-wise, this pour-over coffee cone is practically a steal for single-serve coffee aficionados. Simplicity and low maintenance are its two defining features. Some systems require hefty investments on accessories or replacement parts, but this elegant cone just needs hot water, coffee, and filters. Is it as glamorous as high-end pour-over equipment? No. But is it worth every penny for uncomplicated coffee brewing? Absolutely.

1kdrii2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kdrii2,"*MID-TWENTIES, FEMALE ROOMMATE FOR LEASE RESIGNING IN 2-BED/1BA HELLS KITCHEN APT*","Hi everyone! I am currently looking for a roommate to take over the second bedroom in a 2-bed/1-bath apartment in Hell’s Kitchen. This apartment is really a gem and both my current roommate and I absolutely love it!

A little about me: I am a 25-year-old third-year law student (soon to be 26-year-old law graduate) and will working nearby. I’m easygoing, respectful, and big on creating a warm, supportive, and clean space. I will be working four days in the office and Fridays remotely! If you’re new to the city, I love meeting new people and doing new things together, so happy to help you feel settled in.

I'm hoping to find someone who is friendly, responsible, clean, and open to building a balance between a fun and chill vibe at home! I like being friends or friendly with my roommate, whether that’s a movie night together, going out to dinner, or just checking in at the end of the day and talking while we cook. I also love open communication, so guests, sharing things, etc. are totally okay with a heads up and I would do the same.

This apartment really is amazing and has a lot of charm. It’s in a great location, near the 50th C/E and 1 subway stops, and the 49th NWR stop, so very easy to get to other parts of the city. Central Park is about an 11-minute walk and the waterfront is only a few avenues over! There’s a lot of bars, restaurants, and coffee shops in this area as well as Trader Joe’s is only a 20-minute walk uptown. In terms of everything else:

\-The bedrooms are huge and are at opposite ends of each other, so there’s a lot of privacy. You would have two huge closets + gorgeous view of the city

\-There’s a true living room, kitchen, and bathroom space (everything is basically furnished – we would just need to get a couch + stuff for your bedroom)

\-Huge windows, so a lot of natural light.

\-In-unit washer/dryer, which is in my room. Your room would be a little bit bigger.

\-5th floor-walk up and on top floor, so there’s no problem with sound above us. -Packages are easy to get in, we have a buzzer.

\-Live-in superintendent who is very responsive.

\-Monthly exterminator (no problem with bugs) -Management is very easy to work with and this landlord looks at more than just income. They really value good tenants. It would be a standard rental application process!

I've recommended her games in the past like animal crossing (had to go with the classic, I'll definetely convince her one day), but she didn't like how much reading she had to do. On top of that she's not really used to reading/listening english in general.

Secondary, she's showed interest in running her own shop, coffee, restaurant, clothes whatever, as long as she doesn't have reading to do and the gameplay loop is interesting enough.
