Sometimes runny-feeling, sometimes thick-feeling, but I have no hoarseness, irritation or pain.  At the time, I thought it was allergies because we apparently had a terrible ragweed season, and I am also close to 50 and I know allergies can start to develop later in life out of nowhere.  But a Google search early in 2025 implied it could be LPR and that prompted me to visit my GE who prescribed me a PPI.  I have no idea if it worked.  A few weeks in, the throat clearing diminished. It kind of came and went.  And then there were days where I would eat everything under the sun - tomatoes, coffee, garlic, etc. - and I had zero LPR response.  But then a couple weeks later, the phlegm would return.

I have tried EVERYTHING: changing my diet, PPIS (have tried 3 now), slippery elm tea, alginate, Zinc Carnosine, Pepcid, Essentia water, vagus nerve stimulation - but I am STILL clearing my throat every few minutes.  I have no idea what this is. I'm presuming I should see an ENT next but is there anything else I can do that I haven't done?  Chat GPT adamantly insists that it's LPR.",1,1751504208.0,LPR,1,1.0,False

1lqcg6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1lqcg6z/my_sadistic_employer_weaponised_my_trauma_and/,My sadistic employer weaponised my trauma and mental health to utterly destroy my life. I can't let them win.,"TW: Suicidal Idiation, Workplace Mobbing, Starvation, Stalking.

With complex trauma, you often have the common problem of being hypervigilant or over-explanatory, which can make some professionals, particularly those with less of a conscience, or even predatory types (they do exist) see you in much the same way a great white sees a sea lion that's drawing blood. You're irresistible to their darker impulses. Especially jealous, bitter, insecure people.

Due to trauma, I isolated myself for a good year and a half. Hyper-independence and all that. I didn't want to rely on ANYONE. 

The only people I spoke to during that period were my new friends and co-workers. My workplace knew about my struggles, and that I'd moved over 600+ miles away from my hometown for a fresh start after years of harrowing experiences. 

A woman around 7 years older than me in HR became ""faux friends"" with me while I overshared my triumphs and struggles over coffee. That's what naturally happens when you don't have people at home to offload to. I was relatively new (but not as new as her!) and thought I could trust her with my secrets, woman to woman. (We were working in a male dominated field after all, and I was deffo a girl's girl.) 

She knew I lived on my own and was estranged from my entire family. That I had overcome a serious episode of illness three years prior and was now thriving in my artistic career as a singer songwriter. I think she was jealous that I was not only people savvy but highly skilled in writing songs and playing musical instruments. I was also doing a bit of fashion modelling on the side. Secretly, she could not STAND the natural camaraderie and trust I had with my male coworkers.

Anyway, I was polite and optimistic; well to do. I praised her fashion sense and office decor and often shared funny stories of my disappointment with the men I was dating at the time during lunch break. She shared stories about her life and asked me if therapy was going well and I said it was. She congratulated me. I was cautiously optimistic, but this was a pretty big accomplishment in my book. 

Despite being a junior, I spoke up for my disenfranchised coworkers who were struggling to afford rent and suggested that the pay be a little better so they'd be more comfortable and you know, not starving at the end of the month(!) I had a courageous streak and was perhaps a bit too brave for my own good. A bit too punk rock for her tastes (I also played electric guitar and had a taste for obscure prog rock instrumental bands!) For the first time in my life, I was officially ""cool.""

I exposed the unfair disparities in ""global"" work privileges such as WFH or access to breaks between employees. I was not afraid to speak my mind or protect my own. Two promotions later, I was kicking ass at work. I eventually got my own office. Senior management were NOT happy about this.

So, I was framed. ""Workplace mobbing"" they call it. Told I had committed ""gross misconduct"" for doing academic research during my lunch break by a middle aged and untalented sycophant in management. Yes really. I was utterly mortified. They told my coworkers (a lot of them were also good friends) not to speak to me after I was let go within a week of me raising a grievance, and all within a day of my first real gig as an artist. My laptop, social media and emails were hacked with 147 viruses shortly thereafter. I also wasn't given severance or notice despite them knowing that my rent was 85% my paycheck. I think these people wanted to completely destroy me so I couldn't fight the mega lawsuit I'd successfully posited. They knew of all my vulnerabilities and exploited the hell out of them. I didn't think ""professionals"" could be so sociopathically sadistic. Oh how wrong I was. They enjoyed what they were doing and desperately wanted to see me fall from grace. I think they got off on it.

I essentially starved in my own home, too afraid, too traumatised and too embarrassed to reach out for help. I was also being stalked by former colleagues, both online and offline. During the build up to my first show, I genuinely feared for my safety. But I thought I could handle the onslaught alone. It was the fight for my life and future. My life felt like a comedically outrageous Saturday morning cartoon plot. Except, this was real. This was psychological warfare and I was caught in the crosshairs.

I called for emergency help and went to A&E, begging that I be sectioned because I was struggling to do anything - too deeply depressed to even eat the scraps of food left in my pantry. I was utterly frozen. Even nutrition drinks came straight back up again due to extreme stress load. They sent me home with severe electrolyte imbalances, and left me to die. Eventually I felt desperately suicidal due to the targeting, manufactured isolation and medical neglect. I even sadly attempted after being pushed to my absolute limit, something I hadn't done in seven years. Even though I was literally starving to death, I managed to secure a new job in three weeks. And file a lawsuit. 40,000 f*cking words in two months, baby. But sadly my life fell apart before I could start. I had exhausted all of my reserves of resilience and collapsed. But despite my very real crisis, I was betrayed. By my workplace. By management. By HR. By A&E. And I almost lost my life for it. My psychosis, something that had been in remission FOR THREE FUCKING YEARS, fully resurfaced, to devastating effect. It was a florid torrent of destruction. I could only watch in icy, half conscious terror as the scaffolding of my life's ambitions, fully realised, fell apart. They shattered my hopes, my dreams, my career, everything I had worked decades for. I can only hope I can get it back from those sick, sick individuals. I will continue to fight; broke but not broken. Fragmented but not shattered. I will lacquer my broken pieces with whatever gold I can find in the abyss.

I was always strong. Forged in the fires of chronic and severe childhood trauma. Scapegoated. The identified patient. Twenty-eight fucking years of it to be exact. The abuse didn't stop when I moved out in my early twenties. So I had clawed my way out and escaped to another country. But strong people are more satisfying to break apart. It takes a lot for a strong person to break. So it's more of an achievement. That's what machivelian sadist fucks think. I mean, what kind of monster knows that a talented and charismatic woman has a history of psychosis and bipolar disorder and severe trauma, and then *actively chooses to aggravate that condition so that they lose absolutely everything they've worked towards I spite of it?* It's unbelievably, stomach-churningly sick. Disgusting even. It speaks to a very depraved level of human evil. And I don't use that work lightly. My name etymologically means warrior. This now feels like no coincidence. I was never a revengeful person, but now I want these people to f*cking BURN.",2,1751504123.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False

I’ve also seen the Breville Cafe Roma, the DeLonghi ECP3420, EM450 and ECP3630; is the extra investment worth it?

Let's work together on your nervousness 😉

**Summary** : You've always been a shy person, someone who struggles to connect with others comfortably. Recently, a friend suggested you try a beginner’s theater class for adults—something to help you step outside your comfort zone. 

Today is the first day. You arrive early but soon, you're joined by a friendly, charming man who introduces himself. He’s warm, extroverted, not much older than you—and it’s his first class too. To your relief, conversation with him flows more easily than you expected. His presence calms you, and for the first time today, your anxiety starts to fade.

**SCRIPT**

**\[Door opens\]** 

**\[Echoes from the empty theater\]** 

**\[To himself\]** *— Whispers with a little smile*   
Oh—looks like someone’s already here. 

**\[Pause, observing the Listener from afar\]** *— Gently*   
Aww… they look nervous as hell. Poor thing. First-day jitters, huh ? 

Alright, man. Be chill. Be helpful. Don’t scare them off. 

**\[Footsteps, approaching quietly\]** *— Warm and friendly*   
Hey there ! Mind if I join you for a bit ? No pressure—I just figured we could be nervous in the same corner together. **\[Light chuckle\]**

**\[Sits nearby but respectfully distant\]** 

You’re early, huh ? I was starting to wonder if I’d gotten the time wrong. 

**\[Glances around\]** — *Casual*   
Pretty empty for now. Kinda nice, actually. You get a moment to breathe before the chaos starts. 

*Gentle*   
I’m Donovan, by the way. And yes—I promise I’m not just walking into random theaters and talking to strangers. 

*Playful*   
Well… not often. 

**\[Pause, senses the Listener’s discomfort\]** — *Soft*   
You alright ? You seem a little… tightly wound. Like you’re trying not to bolt for the door. 

*Soft laugh, slightly playful*   
Hey, no judgment. I almost turned around twice on the way here. New things are scary. Especially things where you might have to—*dramatic gasp*—talk to people. Or worse... pretend to be a tree in front of strangers. 

**\[Pauses\]** *— More sincerely*   
But you’re here. You showed up. That already takes guts. And for what it’s worth… you’ve got a really kind face. I mean it. You’re doing great. 

*More relaxed*   
So… theater class for adult beginners, huh ? Have you ever done something like this before ? 

**\[Listener shakes their head and mumbles vaguely\]** 

Ah, okay. You’ve got a general idea, but not the full picture ? 

*Reassuring*   
Alright, let me give you my unofficial rundown, based on my research and knowledge. Basically, this kind of class is meant to be super chill. You’re not here to be perfect or perform Shakespeare on day one. 

It’s more like… little exercises, warm-ups, silly games that help you get comfortable being expressive. Stuff to help you open up, laugh a little, maybe learn something about yourself. 

We do things like mirroring exercises—where you copy someone’s movements—or short, goofy improvisations. Nothing scary. 

And the group ? Usually a mix. Folks who just wanna try something new, gain confidence, meet people. Some are curious about acting, some just want to stop panicking when they have to speak at work meetings. 

*Encouraging*   
Want an anecdote ? A friend of mine started in a class just like this. She was painfully shy—like, couldn’t order coffee without sweating. And now ? She does stand-up. Another guy I know switched careers entirely and works in voice acting now. 

Not saying that’s gonna be you. But hey, you never know what doors this kind of thing can open. 

**\[Pauses\]** *— Softer*   
You got a name, mysterious early bird ? 

*Grinning*  
Or should I just call you “Shy But Brave,” ‘cause that’s kinda the vibe I’m getting. 

**\[Listener gives their name\]** 

That’s a lovely name. Suits you. 

*Playful*   
It’s got a shy-sweet energy to it. Like someone who says “sorry” even when they haven’t done anything wrong. 

**\[Pauses\]** *— Teasing gently*   
Can I ask—what made you sign up for this class ? 

Trying to challenge yourself ? Face a fear ? Or maybe… you got tricked into it by a very persuasive friend ? 

**\[Listener mumbles something\]** 

*Laughs warmly*  
You’re cute when you get all flustered, you know that ? No, seriously—it’s kinda adorable. Not in a creepy way ! 

Just… it’s nice seeing someone be honest. Most people fake confidence. But you ? You’re actually brave enough to show you’re nervous. That’s rare. 

*Soft and thoughtful*   
You remind me of me, a little. I get nervous too—people don’t always guess it, but it’s true. I just learned to make noise before the fear gets loud. You know ? Start talking before my brain catches up and tells me to shut down. 

*Smiles, a little brighter*   
Wanna make a deal ? Until everyone else arrives, how about we just hang out. You and me. No pressure, no performance. Just two people being slightly overwhelmed in an empty theater. 

I’ll even show you a couple warm-up tricks to help shake the nerves off. They’re silly, but they work. Scout’s honor.  

**\[Listener nods slowly\]** 

*Soft grin*    
Okay, deal sealed. Now, before we start any wild interpretive dancing—which, don’t worry, we’re *not*—let me show you a couple warm-ups. 

These are the kind of things that actors do before shows to loosen up, get out of their heads, and stop thinking about how awkward their arms are.

*Grins, playful*   
Which… I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but arms ? Criminally underrated in the awkwardness department. 

**\[Moves arms around in a weird exaggerated circle\]** 

Like, what even are these things ? Floppy noodles with opinions. **\[Chuckles\]** 

You’ve got great arms though. Balanced… calm energy. 

*Playfully flirty*   
Not in a “you should become a statue model” way—unless you’re into that. I just mean… you carry yourself softly. It’s nice. Grounding. 

**\[Deflects his own compliment\]** — *Playful*   
Okay ! Back to being a professional human-shaped theater person. 

**\[Steps back a little, gently invites Listener to mirror him\]** 

So first—super simple. Just shake out your hands.

**\[Demonstrates\]** 

Like this. Loose. Like you’re trying to flick water off after washing them in these public sinks with no paper towels. 

**\[Listener imitates him\]** 

Yep—perfect ! Shake, shake, shake… Now your arms. Let them dangle a bit. Give ‘em a little swing. Like a sleepy orangutan. 

**\[Listener imitates him again\]** 

…There you go ! Nailed it. You’re actually really good at this, y'know. **\[Chuckle\]**

Okay now… face stretch time. I know, sounds weird, but trust me—it helps. Follow me. 

**\[Demonstrates\]** *— Exaggerated voice*   
BA BA BA ! 

DEE DEE DEE ! 

OW OW OW ! 

**\[Smiles at the Listener's reaction\]** *— Amused*   
Yes, I’m very aware of how ridiculous I look. But if we’re gonna be ridiculous, at least we’re ridiculous together. 

*Softer, more honest*   
Besides, I’ve found that when you let yourself look stupid on purpose, it makes it way less scary when it happens accidentally. 

*Mischievous grin and tone*   
Actually—that reminds me of the first time I really bombed on stage. Want a story ? 

**\[Listener nods and smiles more comfortable\]** 

So, I was in middle school and *technically* the understudy for the lead in this little play. Keyword : technically. 

Because I was convinced—I mean 100% sure—the lead would never miss the show. So naturally… I didn’t learn the lines. Not even a little. 

*Slightly sheepish*   
I think you guessed it. Cut to show night, lead actor, food poisoning… 

I'm backstage in a fake tunic, holding a foam sword, and panicking so hard I nearly passed out. 

*Amused*   
So I did the only thing I could : I went onstage… and improvised. Not well. 

Like, the scene was supposed to be tragic—there was a betrayal, a murder, something about a missing crown… And I was just up there like— 

*Overdramatic tone*   
*""Your king is dead, advisor… call the chef, we need pizza !""* 

**\[Laughs\]** 

I made zero sense. I was quoting cartoons. I did three fake death scenes because I kept forgetting I had already “died.” 

But you know what ? The audience loved it. They were dying laughing. I accidentally turned it into a full-blown comedy. 

*Softer*   
And that was the day I learned two very important things.   
One : Even when things fall apart, they can still be beautiful. Or funny. Or meaningful in a totally unexpected way. 

*Grins*   
And two : …Always, always learn your lines. 

**\[Looks at Listener\]** *— Warm*   
But seriously—if I’d let fear stop me, I would’ve missed that moment. And all the joy that came from it. 

And I guess that’s why I love spaces like this. Theater lets you fail safely. It lets you try something, mess it up, and discover something better in the process. 

Plus, worst case scenario ? You end up with a really good story. 

**\[Pauses, observing the Listener\]** *— Gently*   
You look more relaxed already. Which is honestly a crime, because shy and nervous was really cute on you. 

*Laughs*   
But the calm version is kinda powerful too. 

*More genuine*   
I’m glad I got to meet you before the room filled up. 

**\[Footsteps at the entrance — Other students are arriving\]** 

Sounds like we’ve got company. 

You feeling okay ? Still calm and breathing ? 

**\[Listener response\]** 

*Warm, reassuring*   
Good. That’s all you need to do right now. Breathe. Stay curious. And maybe… stick close to me for a bit. We’ll navigate this together. 

**\[More people enter\]** 

**\[Glances toward the door\]** *— Warm smile*   
Well… looks like the rest of the gang’s rolling in. 

*Softly*   
One last thing before we join them : You’ve got this. I meant it earlier—you’re braver than you think, and you’re already doing better than you realize. 

**\[Stands and turns toward the group\]** 

**\[To the Class\]** *— Tone shifts, nice but confident and clear*   
Okay, everyone ! Looks like we’re all here—amazing. First of all, thanks for showing up. I know that can be the hardest part. 

My name’s Donovan. I’ll be your instructor, and it’s also my first day in this group, like all of you here. 

Now, before you panic—don’t. I’m not really into the whole “authority figure” vibe. Think of me less like a teacher, more like a... fellow traveler who’s just walked this path a few steps ahead. 

I’m here to help. To create a space where you can learn, grow, and have fun—without feeling judged or pressured. 

**\[Walks slowly as he speaks\]** *— Relaxed and genuine*   
So here’s how I want this class to work : It’s all about expression. Movement, voice, creativity, and most of all—presence. You’re not expected to be perfect. You’re expected to be curious, and respectful. That means we support each other. We cheer for each other. There’s no space here for ridicule or making anyone feel small. 

**\[Brief pause\]** 

We’ll be doing warm-ups, games, improv, small scenes—stuff to get your confidence up and your imagination running. I promise we’ll keep it playful, but I’ll challenge you too. Gently. With love. 

**\[Gestures toward the stage area\]** *— Inviting smile*   
Now… to kick things off, I’d love for each of you to come up and introduce yourself on the stage. Nothing too fancy—just your name and maybe what made you want to try this class. Just be yourself. 

**\[As the Class begins to prepare, walks back over to the Listener\]** 

**\[To Listener\]** *— Soft, slightly apologetic*   
Hey. So… I probably should’ve told you earlier that I was the instructor, huh ? 

*A little sheepish*   
I hope you’re not mad. I just… I saw how nervous you were, and I figured, if you thought I was just another newcomer, maybe it’d be easier for you. I didn’t want to throw “I’m the teacher” at you before we even said hello. 

**\[Tries to keep it light\]** *— Chuckles nervously*   
Anyway—I’m really glad we talked. And if you’re still speaking to me after class…maybe we could grab a coffee ? Or a drink ? Whatever feels right. 

You don’t have to answer now. Just… think about it. No pressure at all. 

**\[Straightens slightly\]** *— Shy smile*   
I’m not going anywhere. And I really like talking to you. So… if you ever want to continue, I’m all ears. 

**\[Pause — Step back\]** 

**\[To the Class\]** *— Raise slightly his voice with energy*

1lqc5na,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/1lqc5na/boyfriend_moving_in/,Boyfriend Moving In,"TLDR; I (25f) am super excited because my boyfriend (27m) and I are talking about moving in together soon. While I know that this brings on new challenges, I’m super excited to take this step forward, but I know I need to change the space and decor up to make it comfortable for him. I need thoughts on what I should be financially responsible for. 

—

For more context, I moved out on my own about a year and a half ago, and I have been living alone with my dog ever since. While I was very careful about monitoring my expenses, I care deeply about my space—as I tend to be a homebody during the school year as an elementary teacher and grad student—so I splurged here and there on furniture and decor that would fit my style. That being said, it is very girly, colorful, and pink. 

I’m not attached to my decor—though perfectly curated to the aesthetic—but more so the fact that I’ve spent a good chunk of money furnishing and decorating my space, so I don’t have a lot of wiggle room to redecorate or repurchase everything. I’m good for swapping out coffee table books to ones that aren’t pink and removing any “girly” decor sitting around or even purchasing easy decor that is suitable for our “new” style, but my boyfriend has already mentioned wanting new area rugs, switching out my massive ($100+) paintings, buying a king bed, and a space for his coffee supplies (big interest area and i love it!). 

I don’t have the money for any of this currently, especially not being paid during the summer. I budgeted my rent and utility expenses along with my typical grocery/outing expenses, but I do not have the financial flexibility to repurchase all of this decor or furniture even if we split costs. Please give advice for navigating this move in! I want to be conscious of tailoring the space to be inclusive and one that reflects collaboration, but would it be out of line to ask him to pay for expenses like the bed and split decor later? TIA!

Not long ago, I was sitting across from the manager at my local bank, chatting about being retired and struggling. I mentioned in passing that, when I was growing up, there was a time in America when you could walk into a bank and lock in interest rates approaching 17% on certain fixed-income investments—right inside your IRA. He looked at me like I had started telling tall tales. But it really happened.

In the early 1980s, the country was fighting a battle with runaway inflation. The Federal Reserve, under Chairman Paul Volcker, cranked interest rates sky-high—so high that the federal funds rate briefly topped 19% in 1981. As a result, bank CDs and money market accounts paid yields that today feel almost mythical.

My parents and their friends took full advantage of it. I remember the grown-ups sitting around the kitchen table, sipping coffee, and comparing notes about which bank was offering the best CD specials. They didn’t think twice about rolling over thousands of dollars into fixed-rate CDs paying 15% or 16%. For them, it was like hitting the jackpot without ever buying a lottery ticket.

Sure, mortgages were brutal—rates climbed past 18%—and borrowing could break your back. But for retirees and anyone disciplined enough to save, it was a golden window when your money seemed to multiply on its own. My parents and their circle often joked that they were living on Easy Street, collecting checks that today would seem absurdly generous.

Today, with savings accounts and CDs paying a fraction of those returns, it almost feels like folklore. But for those who lived it, it was a very real—and very prosperous—chapter in American financial history.

Here’s some context:

I’m 26F, I went to America to Au pair in July 2021 and got back in August 2023 (lived at home with my family). In the beginning of February 2024 my parents moved to a new house that had an apartment on the property which I then moved into. At the end of February I reconnected with a guy I knew from 2020 and we started dating, then moved into an apartment together in the beginning of June 2024. Yes, I know that’s quick but the apartment is in an estate that is literally a 3 minute drive from my parents house.

The first couple of months living in the apartment with my boyfriend was tough because of my parents, they struggled with me not living at home anymore and would make a big deal about us only visiting them a couple times a week, they were often rude to myself and my bf and the atmosphere was very awkward when we visited, this put strain on my relationship.

Fast forward to now, my boyfriend and I have been living together for over a year and we just extended our lease for another two years, the situation with my parents has slightly improved but my mom still gets upset with me if I don’t visit her enough (I honestly don’t know what “enough” is because sometimes I go to the house 3 or more times a week for hours at a time). We have also repeatedly invited her over and told her she’s welcome to come to our apartment for coffee or to visit but she never does, she always has some excuse like “You know I’m busy” but then makes me feel bad when I don’t make the effort to go there as often as she expects me to. She also gets annoyed and is moody with us if we ask to go visit them at their house and we’re a few minutes late, but sometimes we get to the house on time and she’s hours late.

I’m 26 years old and I feel so guilty for not wanting to visit all the time, I get nervous if I haven’t visited for a few days, I get afraid and anxious if I or my bf is running late and there’s a chance we won’t get to my parents house on time because I know she’s going to be annoyed and something will get said to either me, my bf or both of us when we see them again.

The most recent situation was me switching my location off of the Life360 app, my family all uses the app and shortly after moving in with my bf I switched my location off because I feel like I’m an adult and my family doesn’t have to know my every move, almost a year later my mom still reprimands me for it and said to me last week “don’t get upset with me, I’m your mom and I just want to know you’re safe”. I still haven’t turned my location back on and I don’t know how to stand up for myself, I just tell her “I understand”.

When she gets annoyed or upset about something I get scared and feel like a child again, I’m so nervous and afraid of the switch in her tone of voice.

How do I establish healthy boundaries with her and not feel guilty? This is really taking a toll on my mental health and my anxiety is awful.",2,1751502454.0,entitledparents,1,1.0,False

A week later I reached out again this time I sent an email apologizing about how things ended and all my wrong doings. Again it was left on read and got no response. Things at home got intense, my parents were very rude and homophobic and I missed her a lot during this time. I was very vulnerable and just really needed her. I begged for a response from her but I got nothing was left on read again. I proceeded to move on with my life and about two weeks later I receive a message from her asking for us to meet up for coffee. During this time she stated she felt bad for not responding, I refused to see her and she got mad that I rejected her. She asked if I was seeing someone and I told her many times I am not nor have I wanted to. I asked her situation and she stated she’s not seeing anyone either. Anyways I ghost her this time and she reaches out again a week later asking to be friends. We start chatting again and I come to find out she was seeing someone during this time of silence from her. She’s so vague on what happened bw her and the girl she was seeing. Stated things ended bc she didn’t want to deal w the same bullshit she had w me. Im feeling very hurt because I although did think she would move on eventually I didn’t think it would happen so quickly so soon. Im wondering if if her reaching out is bc she developed feelings for her and needs to get over that by coming back to me. ",1,1751502446.0,AskLesbians,0,1.0,False

     I’m posting this to hopefully help someone else.  Quick story.  48 year old male.  Constipated for a few years.  Hemorrhoids, pain, itching constantly.  Tried all sorts of MiraLAX, drugs, more water,  fiber pills, less coffee, diet changes, not eating spicey foods, etc and nothing seemed to work.  I was diagnosed with ibs-d but wasn’t really sure if that was it.  Went to a different gastro dr and he suggested the following EVERY morning:

* 1 cup apple sauce
* 1 cup oat bran or unprocessed wheat bran
* ¾ cup prune juice

Mix together and keep in refrigerator.  Take 2 tablespoons each morning and microwave for 75 seconds.  I like to add nuts and yogurt but you can mix whatever you like in it.  Recipe credit to the University of Michigan.  I wasn’t sure if I could post the link so I just put the recipe here.  Eat this every day for 2 weeks.  That is the key.  It takes a while for your body to get used to the increased fiber.  I marched into the drs office the next appointment and told him he changed my life.

Im soooo sick & tired of giving and giving when there’s nothing left to give and then I’m made to feel guilty or compared to others who don’t share my issues. 
So to explain in depth I will give a WHOLE ass back story. So firstly growing up was rough my parents were emotionally abusive plus always fought and my dad would come home drunk and bitch at me(it was always me) even tho I had siblings I was the one everyone took everything out on. And it ate me alive. I used to self harm (no one cared) I would sleep around because I didn’t value myself. Eventually got gang bang r*ped. No one cared. Until I ended up pregnant at 17. Then my mom forced and I mean FORCED me to get an abortion it was traumatic and not what I wanted at the time. She didn’t care. So I ended up pregnant again at 19 (and judge me all u want) I’ve been thru hell and back that most can’t understand but I’ve always been there for my babies. Was it smart to have kids at that age? Idk i obviously know a lot more now but my kids saved me they helped me mature and they made me a better human. So moving on I get pregnant at 19. My mom ignored my existence. So I moved out. All I wanted was to GET out of that house. So I was “safe” in my mind but the guy I’m(the father) with gets arrested when I was only 4 weeks postpartum. Which yes was traumatic. Yay more trauma. So I lived with his family which wasn’t always the best to me they treated me as tho my trauma didn’t exist and my reactions were “emotional” or whatever as if I wasn’t freshly out of a traumatic childhood trying to raise a baby as a teenager. They tried to control my personal life. Who I saw what I posted what I wore. And if I wanted a roof over my head I had to listen to them. Then fast forward my baby daddy gets out 2 years later. I wanted nothing to do with him. Until he proved to me he changed. Until he was different and I could see that consistently. He swore up and down he’d be different and he wanted me back so being we have a child together I gave him another chance. As soon as we started dating he cheated. It hurt. But I think it hurt so bad and confused me so bad I blocked it out and we moved on because he swore it was a mistake and wouldn’t happen again. Soo fast forward a bit we have another baby together. Still young I’m only (22) at this point my mom started talking to me again. And life was actually kind of okay. Happy even. I felt good in my relationship with him and my parents and my kids. I was happy. We had big goals for the future… then I started to develop postpartum anxiety and he was not supportive AT ALL. It was baddd too like I ended up in the hospital and he would pick me up and ask to go to the gym that night as if I didn’t need to come home and rest and be more supported. He demanded we sleep together often and from week 3 too so before i was even fully healed. I gave him everything. And he gave me nothing in return. Then come 5 months post postpartum my mom gets sick. Just after we started getting on good terms. Not just sick .. SICK SICK. The kind of sickness u feel like could never happen to you or your family. Termal brain cancer at the ripe age of 59. The kind of thing that changes your whole entire outlook on life keep in mind im still only 23. I turned into a caregiver for her as well. Which is something I never expected to happen so soon in life. I grieved my mom while she was still alive a type of pain most will never understand. All while raising two little human beings. And mind you I’m a GOOD mom that is something I will not let anyone ever say anything about despite my trauma I’ve never let it rain on them. I have been going to therapy consistently for years. And I’m talking about multiple sports. Never stopped showing up. School. Doctors appointments. Meals. Schedules. Big birthday parties going all out every holiday because they DESERVE it. And I will never stop being there for them. That aside. So just to paint the picture tho I’m going  on being everything for everyone in my life. Trying to also be a good sister to my brothers who are also going thru a hard time. While mind u who’s there for me? No one like usual. Now as if this wasn’t hard enough it gets crazier. Still postpartum dealing with my own shit and now my mom. And now we have to find our own place asap because his parents are kicking us out which okay we are getting older and have two kids so fair but the timing was just impeccable. And moving is stressful even if it’s a good thing. I was happy to get our own place but that was also stressful because I was worried about baby proofing and moving and ofc ofc I’m doing it all alone with no support like usual. Exhausted. Burnt out. Worn thin. But I did! Ofc I did it because there’s no other choice. So my mom is still going thru everything. Then we move and my relationship takes a turn. I thought It would improve? But hahaha now we have our OWN place and he’s not showing up how he should (shocker right) sorry u can tell I’m getting more bitter as this goes on lmao. But anyways we started to fight as couples do over the dishes and money and all the added stress we now have. But it took a dark turn from regular fights. He was loud and hurtful and I would SOB uncontrollably and he’d watch me with no emotion no remorse. It was crossing the line into abuse. It got to the point where I told my family (not wanting to burden them more) but was really looking for support. I got none. Like usual. “They had too much going on”. So I just kept pushing along like I do. Now here’s where it gets really crazy. I have two brothers but the one closest to me in age (both younger) ended up stabbing my dad in the head with a chefs knife… yeah YEAH. YEAH. So anyways my dad’s in the hospital getting stitches. My brother was taken to the hospital for mental health evaluation. Gets diagnosed with schizophrenia and psychosis and autism. Meanwhile I’m trying to process this all and then my lovely baby daddy only concerned about himself yelled at me that day. As I was mid dissociation and panic attack over my brother stabbing my dad as if that’s an EVERYDAY THING. Apparently it is in my world right. And as if that wasn’t HARD ENOUGH. My youngest and only other brother almost died two weeks later. From seriously high blood sugar like a number even his doctor never saw before. He gets diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at age 20?! Out of no where. So now that’s another thing on all of our plates. And I’m still despite my life issues showing up for them. Because what else do I do? Idk what else to do but be there for them. And ya know that’s just the crazy parts there’s also everyday stress and even them losing their house as well?! It’s like every week it was something new for sooooooo long. IT GETS TO A POINT. Ya know?! Then there’s my baby daddy who ya I found out he was cheating again. But when we were happy still … when I was freshly postpartum and having sex with him often that’s WHEN he was and he denied it (still does) and I also found grinder?! On his phone. He denies that too. But the heartache. The pain. The confusion. The wondering if any of it was ever real even when “we” were happy. It’s crazy how that’s a life altering event and it’s like one of the least craziest things still to be happening. Wondered if when I randomly started getting BV over and over after never getting it was from him or not. I almost ended up going to a specialist over it… and I developed a polyp been dealing with that too it’s been making me bleed heavy. And my iron got so low it got to a 2 A MF 2 . Twoo!!!! I just got an iron infusion. Hoping that helps. But ya so I’ve been burnt out on every physical and mental aspect. On a SOUL level. And mind u. I don’t go out. I don’t vape. I don’t drink. I don’t smoke. I don’t even drink coffee. I am still just trying to be the best version of myself. Trying to find my purpose. Chase my dreams. Raise my kids and even be happy?! And we moved again recently. I did everything myself again. Although I LOVE where we are at now and it’s been slowly giving me hope for life again. It’s peaceful. I’m starting school in the fall. Because I know if I want a good life. A peaceful life I need to earn it. I need to work for it. The whole reason I’m sharing this is because I’m tired of people minimizing me. Minimizing my trauma. My pain. So they can be comfortable so they can keep asking of me. Like the selfish people they are. Including a friend which I’m starting to wonder if he’s even my friend and my dad. My dad asked me to drive to see my mom tonight because he’s overwhelmed and uncomfortable (mind u it’s her first night back from a rehab) FIRST. And I said we will see because I don’t feel well and he was almost pissed at me because he thinks if I don’t come tonight it will be the night she passes away and I’ll hate myself. And then he texts me later saying she’s actually fine. And that’s so unfair to me. I’m at the point where I can not keep placing myself LAST. It’s not that I don’t care about my mom I'm choosing against guilt, chaos, and pressure. I love my mom. But I love my kids, and I love myself too. And I refuse to abandon us just to make others more comfortable. I refuse to make myself literally SICK for others to be comfortable. Mind you I also was just in the hospital again the other night (alone) for a panic attack. And I didn’t call anyone because I didn’t want to burden them. They may never understand or they may choose not to understand but if I keep pushing myself I’ll end up worse off. Back in the hospital or chronically ill. Long term mental health issues or worse. Disconnected and resentful towards everyone. Numb. Bitter. Losing myself for ever. With an autoimmune disease or who knows but stress is real. Trauma is REAL. And this is my story. If you stayed till the end you’re a trooper. I’m not choosing against anyone. I’m choosing me and my body, my mind, my sanity, and my kids.
Because if I don’t… I won’t survive this. And then they lose me anyway.
I guess I just want to know that I’m not crazy and I’ve just been thru literally hell and back!!!? Like someone tell me this isn’t normal because 🤣heck if it is then I guess I just suck at coping or maybe I don’t? Since I’m still doing my best. I could be worse that’s for sure.

## Key Features Analysis

The best bullet tumblers of 2025 boast several key features that set them apart from standard drinkware. These include durable construction, superior insulation, and user-friendly designs.

**High-Grade Stainless Steel Construction**

Most premium bullet tumblers are crafted from high-grade stainless steel, typically 18/8 (304) stainless steel. This material is renowned for its durability, corrosion resistance, and ability to maintain temperature. The robust construction ensures that the tumbler can withstand the rigors of outdoor use and resist dents and scratches, making it a long-lasting investment.

**Double-Walled Vacuum Insulation**

A critical feature of any high-quality tumbler is its insulation. Bullet tumblers often employ double-walled vacuum insulation technology. This design creates a vacuum between the inner and outer walls, minimizing heat transfer. Consequently, hot beverages stay hot for up to 12 hours, while cold drinks remain chilled for as long as 24 hours.

**Powder-Coated Finish**

To enhance durability and provide a secure grip, many bullet tumblers feature a powder-coated finish. This coating not only protects the stainless steel from scratches and abrasions but also adds a textured surface that improves handling, even with wet or gloved hands. The powder coating is available in a variety of colors and patterns, allowing for personalization.

**Realistic Bullet Design**

The defining characteristic of these tumblers is their bullet-shaped design. Some models closely mimic the appearance of actual ammunition, complete with realistic details such as casing grooves and bullet tips. While the design is primarily aesthetic, it adds a unique and eye-catching element that appeals to many users.

**Spill-Resistant Lid**

A well-designed lid is essential for preventing spills and leaks. The best bullet tumblers come with spill-resistant lids, often made from BPA-free plastic or silicone. These lids typically feature a sliding or flip-top closure that allows for easy access to the beverage while minimizing the risk of accidental spills, making them ideal for use during travel or outdoor activities.

**Variety of Sizes**

Bullet tumblers are available in various sizes to accommodate different beverage needs. Common sizes range from 12 ounces to 30 ounces, catering to both small and large thirsts. The availability of different sizes ensures that users can choose a tumbler that perfectly suits their drinking habits and lifestyle.

## Core Benefits

Bullet tumblers offer several practical benefits that make them a popular choice for beverage enthusiasts. These advantages include superior temperature retention, enhanced durability, and a unique aesthetic appeal.

**Superior Temperature Retention:** The double-walled vacuum insulation ensures that beverages stay hot or cold for extended periods. For example, a steaming cup of coffee can remain hot for up to 12 hours, while an ice-cold beverage can stay chilled for as long as 24 hours. This is particularly beneficial for outdoor activities or long commutes where access to temperature-controlled drinks is limited.

**Enhanced Durability:** The high-grade stainless steel construction and powder-coated finish make bullet tumblers incredibly durable. They can withstand drops, bumps, and scratches without compromising their functionality or appearance. This durability makes them a reliable choice for rugged environments and frequent use.

**Unique Aesthetic Appeal:** The bullet-shaped design sets these tumblers apart from ordinary drinkware. The realistic details and rugged appearance appeal to those who appreciate a touch of military-inspired style or simply want a conversation-starting accessory. This unique aesthetic adds a personal touch to everyday hydration.

**Spill Prevention:** The spill-resistant lids minimize the risk of accidental spills, making bullet tumblers suitable for use in various settings, including offices, cars, and outdoor environments. The secure closure prevents leaks and keeps beverages contained, providing peace of mind during travel or active pursuits.

**Easy to Clean:** Stainless steel is easy to clean and maintain, making bullet tumblers a convenient choice for daily use. They can be easily washed by hand or placed in the dishwasher, ensuring that they remain hygienic and ready for the next beverage. The smooth interior surfaces prevent residue buildup and facilitate thorough cleaning.

## FAQs Section

**Are bullet tumblers safe to use?**
Yes, bullet tumblers made from high-quality materials such as 18/8 stainless steel and BPA-free plastics are safe to use. These materials are non-toxic and do not leach harmful chemicals into beverages. Always choose tumblers from reputable brands that prioritize safety and quality.

**Can I put my bullet tumbler in the dishwasher?**
While some bullet tumblers are dishwasher safe, it's best to check the manufacturer's instructions. Powder-coated finishes may be susceptible to damage from the high heat and harsh detergents used in dishwashers. Hand washing is generally recommended to prolong the lifespan of the tumbler and maintain its appearance.

**How do I clean my bullet tumbler effectively?**
To clean your bullet tumbler effectively, rinse it with warm water and soap after each use. For stubborn stains or odors, use a mixture of baking soda and water. You can also use a bottle brush to scrub the interior surfaces. Ensure that you thoroughly rinse and dry the tumbler before storing it.

**Are bullet tumblers suitable for carbonated beverages?**
While bullet tumblers can be used for carbonated beverages, it's essential to exercise caution. The pressure from the carbonation can build up inside the tumbler, potentially causing leaks or spills. It's best to avoid overfilling the tumbler and to open it carefully to release any built-up pressure.

1lqbn14,https://i.redd.it/gu97vnovxjaf1.jpeg,25 spells for repairing broken relationships,"
Did you know that almost 70% of relationships that break up could potentially be mended with the right interventions? The concept of using spells to repair relationships is not new but is rooted in ancient practices. Throughout history, different cultures have developed a myriad of spells aimed at fostering reconciliation and understanding between estranged partners. In modern times, the practice has seen a resurgence, particularly among those seeking alternative means to heal emotional wounds.

The Historical Context
Historically, the notion of casting spells for love and reconciliation can be traced back to ancient civilizations such as the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans. These cultures believed that invoking spiritual forces could influence human emotions and actions. Spells were meticulously crafted and often involved the use of herbs, rituals, and incantations. Fast forward to the 21st century, the concept has evolved but the essence remains—spiritual interventions aimed at mending broken bonds.

The Structure of Modern-Day Relationship Spells
Today's relationship repair spells are often a blend of traditional elements and contemporary needs. They can range from simple affirmations and candle rituals to more complex ceremonies involving multiple steps and ingredients. Each spell typically addresses specific aspects of relationship repair, such as communication breakdowns, emotional healing, or rekindling lost passion. Practitioners often tailor these spells to suit individual circumstances, making them highly personalized solutions.

Emotional and Psychological Benefits
One compelling aspect of using spells for repairing relationships is the psychological benefits they offer. Engaging in these rituals can provide emotional comfort and a sense of control during turbulent times. The very act of performing a spell can serve as a therapeutic exercise, helping individuals to focus their intentions and energies on positive outcomes. In many cases, this can lead to improved mental well-being and a renewed sense of hope.

Scientific Perspective
From a scientific standpoint, while there may not be empirical evidence supporting the efficacy of spells, the placebo effect can play a significant role. The belief in a spell's power can induce a psychological shift, leading to behavioral changes that positively impact the relationship. This is akin to the way cognitive-behavioral therapy works, where changing one's thoughts can lead to changes in emotions and behavior.

Restoring Trust with the Mirror Spell
One evening, I decided to perform the Mirror Spell, a ritual designed to reflect inner truths and promote honesty between partners. I gathered a mirror, two candles, and a piece of cloth, setting them up in our dimly lit living room. As the candles flickered softly, I stared into the mirror and spoke the words of the spell, hoping to see the reflection of our true emotions and intentions. The experience was profoundly grounding; it felt like a veil lifted, revealing aspects of our relationship we hadn't acknowledged before.

Over the next few weeks, my partner and I gradually opened up to each other, discussing matters we had previously avoided. The Mirror Spell seemed to have a lingering effect, continually reminding us to be forthright. For instance, one day he admitted to feeling insecure about his job, a vulnerability he had never shared before. This newfound openness became a crucial step toward repairing our trust, enabling us to develop a dialogue rooted in sincerity.

Months later, the change was evident. Our conversations were more transparent, and misunderstandings decreased. The mirror still hangs in our living room, a silent witness to our growth. The spell not only mended broken trust but also created a sanctuary for truth within our relationship. Whenever we feel the strain of secrecy creeping back, we look into that mirror and remember the importance of honesty, reinforcing the magic that initially guided us.

Healing Old Wounds with the Candle Flame Spell
I performed the Candle Flame Spell to help heal old wounds and lingering pain between me and a close friend. The preparations were simple: a white candle, incense, and a quiet space. As I lit the candle, I focused my thoughts on the pain we both carried and chanted the spell's incantation, wishing for mutual forgiveness and renewed understanding. The ritual itself was calming, the flame’s dance mesmerizing, whispering promises of reconciliation.

Following the spell, I initiated a conversation with my friend. To my surprise, she had been thinking about reaching out to me as well. We met for coffee, and from the first moment, there was a palpable shift in our interactions. It was as though the candle’s light had burned away the residual negativity. We addressed our past issues candidly, offering apologies and extending forgiveness, a significant emotional cleansing for both of us.

The spell's influence seemed to persist, nurturing our bond anew. Weeks turned into months as we spent more time together, rebuilding our friendship. The candle flame not only mended our past but lit a path for future understanding and compassion. Whenever we encounter misunderstandings now, the memory of that spell acts as a gentle reminder that healing is always possible.

Enhancing Communication with the Feather Whisper Spell
After countless arguments that led nowhere, I decided to try the Feather Whisper Spell to enhance communication with my partner. This spell required two feathers, a quiet outdoor space, and a focused intention on clear, compassionate dialogue. We found ourselves at a secluded park, where the soft rustling of leaves provided the perfect ambiance. Holding the feathers, we closed our eyes and chanted the spell in unison, envisioning our words flowing effortlessly and kindly to each other.

The effects were almost immediate. That evening, we had one of the most heartfelt conversations of our relationship. There was a natural ease in our interaction, devoid of the usual defensiveness. The feathers seemed to have carried away our mental and emotional clutter, leaving behind only sincerity and understanding. My partner opened up about his fears and dreams, aspects of his life he had rarely shared.

Over time, the Feather Whisper Spell became a staple in our relationship toolkit. Whenever communication started to break down, we would repeat the ritual, either physically with feathers or mentally with the memory of that serene park. Our discussions grew more profound and solution-oriented, allowing us to navigate even the trickiest topics without resorting to anger or misunderstandings.

Rekindling Romance with the Rose Petal Enchantment
The spark had faded, and our relationship felt more like a routine than a romance. That's when I decided to use the Rose Petal Enchantment, a spell intended to rekindle love and passion. The requirements were as charming as the intended outcome: fresh rose petals, two red candles, and a shared bath. I set up the bathroom with rose petals scattered everywhere and candles casting a warm, inviting glow, then invited my partner to join me.

As we entered the bath, I recited the spell, focusing on memories of our happiest moments together. The atmosphere became electric; we both felt an immediate sense of intimacy and connection. It was a night of rediscovery, filled with laughter and an affection that had been buried under the weight of everyday life. We held hands, kissed, and shared our deepest feelings, revitalizing the love that initially brought us together.

The energy from that night carried forward. We began to schedule regular date nights, small but meaningful gestures of love and appreciation. The Rose Petal Enchantment hadn't just brought back the romance for a single night—it had reignited our commitment to each other. Now, whenever we feel the mundanity seeping back in, a few rose petals and the glow of candles are all it takes to remind us of the magic we share.

Can Relationship Spells Fix Any Relationship?
While relationship spells can be powerful, they are not guaranteed to fix every relationship. They are most effective when both parties are open to reconciliation and willing to work on the relationship. Some relationships may be beyond repair and might require more practical interventions.

Do I Need to Believe in Magic for These Spells to Work?
Belief in magic can enhance the effectiveness of a spell, as it helps to focus and strengthen your intentions. However, even if you are skeptical, the process of performing a spell can still have psychological benefits that might indirectly aid in mending the relationship.

Can These Spells Be Reversed?
In most cases, relationship repair spells are designed to create positive outcomes and don't typically require reversal. However, if you feel that a spell has had unintended negative effects, there are rituals and spells available that can help to neutralize or reverse its energy.

1lqbj54,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lqbj54,Beyond frustrated with discolored tooth,"So I’m going to try to make this as brief as possible. One of my front upper teeth is discolored. I have been informed by several dentists that this is likely related to a past trauma ( I don’t not recall a specific event). It is slightly more yellow than my other teeth and has a translucency that is most noticeable in natural light and photos. It does not respond to external whitening products. I really want to find a way to get it whiter so that I can whiten my other teeth without it being noticeable. I am frustrated because no dentist seems to be able to confidently offer a solution to fix it. I have been interested in bonding. Two dentists have said that I need to straighten my teeth first before they can apply any bonding so that it doesn’t stick out more (it already protrudes). I understand this, and while I do plan on getting Invisalign in the next year or so, it is not something I can currently afford. I’m not even entirely unhappy with the crowding of my teeth, I just really want them to be white and I’m really aware of the tooth discoloration. I understand it’s not significant but I’m personally bothered by it. I went to a cosmetic dentist for the first time today and she only focused on the straightening of my teeth and said she couldn’t help me. I am so frustrated and would love to hear if anyone has had similar cases and what they would do in this scenario. I understand dentistry is not magic, but I just wonder if there is some viable solution for whitening the tooth without straightening my teeth first. I do not smoke, drink coffee, or have any relevant health issues. X-rays of the tooth have shown no infection or issues per my dentist.

1lqbbwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkinitalian/comments/1lqbbwo/italian_grammar_lesson_mastering_the_irregular/,Italian grammar lesson: mastering the irregular present perfect (passato prossimo),"**Understanding Italian passato prossimo**

Teaching *passato prossimo* to my students is always a bit like trying to explain the rules of a game that constantly changes. Imagine trying to teach someone how to ride a bike while the bike keeps turning into a unicycle. Fun, right?

**Breaking it down**

The *passato prossimo* is a **compound tense**. It needs two things:
- An auxiliary verb (*avere* or *essere*)
- The past participle of the main verb

Picture this: yesterday, Maria says, ""*Sono andata al cinema*,"" which means ""I went to the cinema."" The verb *essere* changes to match the subject, just like a chameleon blending into its surroundings.

**Conjugating past participles**

Here's the kicker. Regular verbs follow a pattern:
- *-are* verbs become *-ato* (like *mangiare* to *mangiato*)
- *-ere* verbs become *-uto* (like *cadere* to *caduto*)
- *-ire* verbs become *-ito* (like *capire* to *capito*)

**The irregulars**

Ah, the irregulars, the wild cards of Italian verbs. These verbs refuse to follow the rules. For example, *aprire* becomes *aperto* and *leggere* turns into *letto*. They’re like that friend who always takes the scenic route.

**Choosing between avere and essere**

Choosing *avere* or *essere* is like deciding between coffee or tea. Use *avere* for **transitive verbs** (those with direct objects) and *essere* for **intransitive verbs** (those without direct objects).

**Real-life examples**

Imagine Marco saying, ""*Ho finito il libro*,"" meaning ""I finished the book."" Here, *avere* is used because *finito* has a direct object, *il libro*. But if Marco says, ""*Sono uscito*,"" which means ""I went out,"" he uses *essere* because there’s no direct object.

Selecting the right commercial ice machine capacity and type directly impacts operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and profitability for small restaurant operations.

The wrong ice machine selection creates cascading operational problems: insufficient capacity during rush periods leads to customer complaints and lost sales, while oversized units waste valuable kitchen space and inflate utility bills. This comprehensive guide provides restaurant-specific capacity calculations, space optimization strategies, and equipment recommendations that maximize efficiency while minimizing operational costs.

You'll discover precise ice production requirements for different restaurant types, space-saving installation solutions for compact kitchens, energy-efficient models that reduce operating expenses, and proven procurement strategies from successful small restaurant operators across various foodservice segments.

# Understanding Small Restaurant Ice Capacity Requirements

# Fundamental Ice Production Calculations

Peak Demand Analysis forms the foundation of proper ice machine sizing for small restaurants. Unlike large operations with predictable steady demand, small restaurants experience dramatic usage spikes during meal rushes, requiring careful capacity planning to avoid service disruptions.

Small restaurant ice capacity requirements vary significantly by operation type and service style. Fast-casual restaurants typically consume 1.5-2.5 pounds of ice per customer during peak periods, while full-service establishments use 0.8-1.3 pounds per guest. Coffee shops and cafes require 0.3-0.7 pounds per beverage sold, but bubble tea shops and smoothie bars can demand 2-4 pounds per specialty drink.

Daily Production Calculations must account for peak service multipliers rather than average consumption. A 50-seat restaurant serving 200 customers daily doesn't simply need 200 pounds of ice production. Peak lunch and dinner rushes concentrate 60-70% of daily volume into 4-5 hour windows, requiring machines capable of producing 300-400 pounds daily to maintain adequate supply during critical service periods.

# Restaurant-Type Specific Requirements

**Cafe and Coffee Shop Operations** present unique ice demands centered around cold beverage service. A typical 30-seat cafe serving 150-250 cold drinks daily requires 100-200 pounds of daily ice production. However, seasonal variations can triple summer demand, making 300-pound capacity essential for year-round reliability. Specialty coffee shops offering cold brew, iced lattes, and blended drinks need higher capacity due to increased ice-to-beverage ratios.

**Bar and Tavern Applications** demand the highest ice consumption per customer in the restaurant industry. Full-service bars require 3-5 pounds of ice per customer for cocktail service, with premium craft cocktail establishments using up to 8 pounds per guest due to stirring, shaking, and presentation requirements. A 40-seat bar serving 100 customers nightly needs 400-500 pounds of daily ice production to maintain service quality throughout busy periods.

**Fast-Casual Restaurant Operations** balance beverage service with food preparation ice needs. Kitchen applications include food display cooling, prep work temperature control, and beverage station supply. A typical 60-seat fast-casual operation requires 250-350 pounds daily, with additional capacity needed for catering services or delivery preparation that extends beyond dining room service.

**Pizza and Quick-Service Applications** focus primarily on beverage ice with minimal food prep requirements. However, delivery and takeout operations often experience concentrated demand periods that stress ice production capacity. A busy pizza shop serving 300-400 customers daily during peak weekend periods requires 350-450 pounds of ice production to support beverage sales and delivery operations.

# Peak Load and Storage Considerations

Rush Period Management requires understanding ice consumption patterns specific to restaurant service styles. Fine dining establishments experience concentrated demand during 2-3 hour dinner service windows, while casual operations face dual lunch and dinner rushes. Coffee shops see morning and afternoon peaks, with potential evening rushes in urban locations serving as third-place social spaces.

Storage Capacity Planning must balance production capability with bin space limitations in small restaurant kitchens. Ice machines typically include integrated storage bins ranging from 100-500 pounds capacity. Small restaurants benefit from matching storage capacity to 6-8 hours of peak production, allowing overnight production to build reserves for next-day service demands.

Seasonal Demand Fluctuations significantly impact small restaurant ice requirements, particularly operations with outdoor seating or tourist-dependent customer bases. Summer demand can increase 40-80% over winter consumption, requiring either oversized baseline capacity or supplemental ice purchasing during peak seasons. Beach-adjacent restaurants and outdoor venues require additional planning for extreme seasonal variations.

# Health Code and Safety Requirements

NSF International Standards mandate specific ice handling protocols that impact machine selection and installation for restaurant operations. Commercial ice machines must meet NSF/ANSI Standard 12 for ice-making equipment, ensuring sanitary production and storage. Small restaurants must verify equipment certification to maintain health department compliance and avoid costly violations.

Food Safety Considerations require ice storage and handling systems that prevent contamination while maintaining service efficiency. Ice machines must incorporate antimicrobial components, easy-cleaning surfaces, and contamination-resistant storage bins. Restaurant operators need training protocols for staff ice handling to maintain food safety standards while maximizing operational efficiency.

Installation Compliance Requirements vary by jurisdiction but typically mandate specific clearances, drainage systems, and electrical configurations. Small restaurants must verify local health department requirements before equipment selection, as modifications after installation significantly increase project costs and potentially delay opening or service restoration.

# Space Optimization and Commercial Ice Machine Installation

# Small Kitchen Space Planning

Compact Kitchen Integration presents the primary challenge for small restaurant ice machine selection and placement. Most small restaurant kitchens allocate only 6-12 square feet for ice equipment, requiring careful evaluation of undercounter, countertop, and modular options that maximize production while minimizing footprint impact.

Undercounter Ice Machine Solutions provide space-efficient alternatives for small restaurants with limited floor space. These units typically produce 80-350 pounds daily while fitting beneath standard 34-inch height counters. However, undercounter placement often reduces storage capacity and may require frequent refilling during peak service periods, making them suitable for lower-volume operations or supplemental capacity applications.

Modular Ice Machine Systems offer flexible capacity scaling for growing small restaurant operations. Separate ice-making heads mounted above storage bins allow customized capacity combinations while utilizing vertical space efficiently. A 400-pound production head mounted above a 300-pound storage bin occupies only 24""x24"" floor space while providing substantial capacity for busy restaurant operations.

Wall-Mounted and Suspended Options maximize floor space utilization in extremely compact kitchens. These specialized units mount above prep areas or storage zones, though installation requires adequate structural support and professional mounting to ensure safety and compliance. Wall-mounted units typically produce 100-250 pounds daily, suitable for cafe and small bar applications.

# Utility Infrastructure Requirements

Electrical Service Planning must accommodate ice machine power requirements while considering existing kitchen electrical capacity. Most commercial ice machines require dedicated 115V or 208-230V circuits with proper amperage capacity. Small restaurants should verify electrical panel capacity before equipment selection, as electrical upgrades can add $500-2,000 to installation costs.

Water Supply and Quality Considerations directly impact ice machine performance, maintenance requirements, and operational costs. Hard water areas require water filtration systems to prevent mineral buildup and extend equipment life. Poor water quality can reduce ice production by 25-40% while increasing maintenance frequency and costs. Water filtration system investment typically pays for itself within 12-18 months through reduced service calls and extended equipment life.

Drainage and Waste Management requires proper planning to prevent flooding and ensure health code compliance. Ice machines produce substantial amounts of wastewater during production and cleaning cycles. Adequate floor drains and drainage capacity prevent water backup that could damage equipment or create safety hazards. Small restaurants must ensure drainage systems can handle peak production and cleaning water volumes.

Ventilation and Heat Management impact both ice machine performance and kitchen comfort. Ice machines generate significant heat during operation, requiring adequate ventilation to maintain efficiency and prevent kitchen overheating. Poor ventilation can reduce ice production by 15-25% while increasing energy consumption. Strategic placement near existing ventilation systems or dedicated exhaust fans optimizes performance while minimizing installation costs.

# Installation Cost Optimization

Professional Installation vs. DIY Considerations affect both initial costs and long-term reliability for small restaurant operations. While basic undercounter units may seem suitable for restaurant owner installation, improper setup often voids warranties and creates operational problems. Professional installation typically costs $300-800 but ensures proper operation, warranty protection, and health code compliance.

Timing Installation with Kitchen Renovation can significantly reduce total project costs for small restaurants. Installing ice machines during kitchen buildouts or major renovations allows coordinated electrical, plumbing, and drainage work that reduces labor costs and minimizes service disruptions. Retrofit installations in operating kitchens often cost 30-50% more due to access limitations and operational constraints.

Utility Upgrade Coordination requires careful planning to minimize disruption and control costs. Electrical panel upgrades, water line installation, and drainage modifications benefit from coordinated scheduling with other kitchen projects. Small restaurants should obtain comprehensive quotes including all utility work to avoid unexpected costs during installation.

Permit and Inspection Requirements vary by location but typically require health department approval for commercial ice equipment installation. Permit costs range from $50-300, while inspection delays can impact restaurant opening schedules. Early permit application and inspector coordination prevent delays that could affect revenue timing for new restaurant openings.

# Restaurant-Type Specific Applications and Recommendations

# Cafe and Coffee Shop Ice Solutions

Specialty Coffee Operations require ice systems optimized for beverage service rather than food preparation applications. Cold brew, iced lattes, and blended drinks demand consistent ice supply during morning and afternoon rush periods. A typical 25-seat specialty coffee shop serving 200-300 cold beverages daily benefits from 150-250 pound daily production capacity with rapid recovery during peak periods.

Bubble Tea and Smoothie Shops represent the highest ice consumption category in the cafe segment, requiring 2-4 pounds per drink due to blending and serving requirements. These operations need 300-500 pounds daily production despite small seating areas. High-volume cube ice machines with large storage bins ensure adequate supply for afternoon and evening rush periods when sales concentrate heavily.

Seasonal Coffee Shop Considerations must account for dramatic summer demand increases when cold beverage sales can triple winter volumes. Many successful coffee shops install baseline capacity for winter operations while maintaining relationships with ice suppliers for peak summer supplementation. This hybrid approach controls equipment costs while ensuring adequate summer supply without oversized winter operations.

Multi-Location Cafe Strategies benefit from standardized ice equipment selections that simplify training, maintenance, and replacement programs. Franchise and multi-unit operators often negotiate volume purchasing agreements with equipment manufacturers, reducing individual unit costs while ensuring parts availability and service consistency across locations.

# Bar and Cocktail Service Applications

Craft Cocktail Bar Requirements demand premium ice quality and substantial capacity for sophisticated beverage programs. High-end cocktail establishments use specialty ice for stirring, shaking, and presentation, requiring 5-8 pounds per customer during peak service. These operations benefit from combination systems producing both standard cubes for volume applications and specialty ice shapes for premium cocktails.

Sports Bar and Casual Tavern Operations focus on volume beer and mixed drink service with moderate ice quality requirements. These establishments typically serve 100-200 customers during peak periods, requiring 400-600 pounds of daily ice production. Large-capacity cube ice machines with substantial storage bins ensure adequate supply during extended busy periods like sporting events and weekend rushes.

Wine Bar and Bistro Applications present moderate ice requirements focused on wine service, cocktail preparation, and limited mixed drink menus. These establishments benefit from compact, efficient ice machines producing 200-350 pounds daily. Quality and reliability matter more than maximum capacity, as service styles allow more controlled ice usage compared to high-volume bar operations.

Restaurant Ice Machine Maintenance becomes critical for bar operations where ice shortages immediately impact revenue and customer satisfaction. Bars benefit from maintenance contracts with local service providers, ensuring rapid response during equipment failures. Many successful bar operators maintain backup ice sources and emergency protocols to prevent service disruptions during peak periods.

# Fast-Casual and Quick-Service Restaurant Applications

Counter Service Restaurant Requirements balance beverage ice needs with food preparation applications including salad bars, food display cooling, and prep area temperature control. A typical 50-seat fast-casual operation requires 250-400 pounds daily production, with additional capacity for catering and delivery services that extend beyond dining room operations.

Pizza and Sandwich Shop Applications focus primarily on beverage service ice with minimal food preparation requirements. However, delivery operations often concentrate order fulfillment into compressed time periods that stress ice production capacity. Successful pizza operations invest in adequate storage capacity to build ice reserves during slow periods for peak delivery rush support.

Food Truck and Mobile Operation Considerations require portable or compact ice solutions that maximize capacity while minimizing space and power consumption. Many food truck operators utilize high-efficiency undercounter units supplemented by purchased ice for peak periods. Strategic ice purchasing during slow periods and efficient storage systems optimize mobile operation efficiency.

Catering and Off-Site Service Planning requires additional ice capacity for events and delivery services beyond base restaurant operations. Restaurants offering catering services typically need 150-200% baseline capacity to support simultaneous dine-in and off-site service. Portable ice transport containers and strategic timing coordinate catering ice needs with restaurant service requirements.

# The Video Creation Struggle is Real

You've been there before. Staring at your phone, knowing you need to create video content but feeling completely overwhelmed by the process. The thought of hitting record makes your stomach turn. Your voice sounds weird, you don't know what to say, and frankly, the idea of being on camera feels about as appealing as a root canal.

But here's what really gets under your skin: you see other people crushing it with video content. Their follower counts are climbing, their engagement is through the roof, and they're making real money while you're stuck on the sidelines. You know video works. The statistics don't lie. Video content gets 1200% more shares than text and images combined. Yet here you are, paralyzed by the very thing that could transform your business.

The traditional route feels impossible. Hiring a video production team costs thousands. Learning video editing software takes months. Writing scripts that actually convert requires skills you don't have. Even finding decent voice talent on freelance platforms can drain your budget faster than you'd like to admit.

This isn't just about vanity or perfectionism. This is about your business survival. While you're wrestling with video creation, your competitors are building audiences, generating leads, and closing sales. Every day you delay is another day of missed opportunities.

Most competing video creation tools operate on subscription models. While this spreads the cost over time, it also creates ongoing expenses that can add up quickly.[ Humanify](https://softtechhub.us/Humanify)'s one-time fee structure provides long-term value and eliminates the stress of recurring payments.

The focus on virtual human creation also differentiates it from generic video editors or animation tools. This specialization means the platform is optimized for a specific type of high-performing content rather than trying to be everything to everyone.

# Strengths and Limitations

# What Humanify Does Exceptionally Well

**Accessibility**: The platform removes technical barriers that prevent most people from creating video content. No editing skills, voice training, or camera presence required.

**Speed**: Videos can be created in minutes rather than hours or days. This speed advantage is crucial for staying current with trends and maintaining consistent content schedules.

**Cost Efficiency**: The one-time fee structure provides long-term value compared to subscription-based alternatives or traditional video production costs.

**Global Reach**: Multi-language support opens international markets without additional hiring or translation costs.

**Professional Results**: The virtual humans look and sound professional, lending credibility to your content.

# Areas for Consideration

**Script Quality Dependency**: While the AI script writer is helpful, the best results often come from refining or customizing the generated scripts. Users who invest time in script improvement will see better results.

**Learning Curve**: Although user-friendly, there's still a learning process for optimizing avatar selection, voice matching, and content structure for maximum impact.

**Market Saturation Risk**: As AI video creation becomes more common, standing out may require additional creativity and strategy beyond just using the tool.

# Real-World Application: A Case Study Approach

# The Affiliate Marketer's Journey

Sarah, a part-time affiliate marketer, struggled with video content creation. She knew review videos converted better than written reviews but felt uncomfortable on camera. After getting[ Humanify](https://softtechhub.us/Humanify), she created her first product review video in under 30 minutes.

The video featured a professional-looking virtual presenter explaining the benefits of a fitness supplement she was promoting. She posted it on TikTok with trending hashtags and watched as views accumulated organically. Within a week, the video had generated three affiliate sales, earning her $150 in commissions.

Encouraged by the results, Sarah scaled her efforts. She created review videos for multiple products in her health and wellness niche, building a library of content that continued generating sales months later. The key was consistency and choosing products that genuinely solved problems for her audience.

# The Local Business Success Story

Mike owned a small accounting firm but struggled to explain his services in an engaging way. Traditional marketing felt expensive and ineffective. Using[ Humanify](https://softtechhub.us/Humanify), he created a series of educational videos explaining tax strategies, business deductions, and financial planning tips.

The virtual presenter made complex financial concepts accessible and trustworthy. Mike posted these videos on LinkedIn and Facebook, positioning himself as a knowledgeable expert. The videos attracted new clients who were impressed by the professional presentation and valuable information.

The monetization opportunities multiplied as well. Brand partnerships, affiliate promotions, and her own product sales all benefited from the expanded reach video content provided.

# Strategic Implementation: Getting Maximum Results

# Content Planning for Success

Random video creation rarely produces consistent results. Develop a content strategy that aligns with your business goals:

**Educational Content**: Answer common questions in your niche. These videos build authority and attract engaged audiences.

**Product-Focused Content**: Create reviews, comparisons, and demonstrations that drive purchasing decisions.

**Trending Topics**: Stay current with industry news and trending discussions to maximize reach.

**Evergreen Content**: Develop videos that remain relevant over time, providing long-term traffic and engagement.

# Platform Optimization Strategies

Different platforms require different approaches:

**TikTok**: Focus on entertainment value and trending sounds. Keep videos under 60 seconds and start with attention-grabbing hooks.

**Instagram Reels**: Leverage hashtags and collaborate with other creators. Stories and longer-form content work well here.

**YouTube Shorts**: Optimize for searchability with keyword-rich titles and descriptions. Consistency is key for algorithm success.

**LinkedIn**: Professional and educational content performs best. Focus on business insights and industry expertise.

# Measuring and Improving Performance

Track key metrics to optimize your video strategy:

* **View Count**: Indicates content appeal and reach
* **Engagement Rate**: Shows audience connection and interest
* **Click-Through Rate**: Measures effectiveness at driving traffic
* **Conversion Rate**: Tracks actual business results

Use these insights to refine your content approach, focusing more resources on what works best for your specific audience and goals.

# Addressing Common Concerns

# ""Will People Notice It's AI?""

The quality of modern AI avatars has improved dramatically. While some viewers might recognize the technology, most focus on the content value rather than the presentation method. The key is choosing appropriate avatars and ensuring your script provides genuine value.

# ""Is This Ethical?""

Using AI for content creation is increasingly common and accepted. The ethical considerations involve being honest about your content and providing real value to viewers. Avoid misleading claims or deceptive practices, just as you would with any marketing approach.

# ""What About Platform Policies?""

Major platforms generally allow AI-generated content as long as it follows their community guidelines. Focus on creating valuable, appropriate content rather than trying to manipulate or deceive viewers.

# ""Can I Build a Real Business With This?""

Many successful online businesses rely on scalable content creation systems.[ Humanify](https://softtechhub.us/Humanify) provides the tools, but business success depends on strategy, consistency, and providing value to your market.

There’s a lot of people, I am ADHD medicamented and i drink coffee. So I’m always doing something, serving people, making food. I’m fast and work under stress. When i’m working I may seem stressed out or very active idk. You see the picture. But inside it’s going pretty well, one thing after another and it’s great. It’s a new place that opened three weeks ago and there’s this new guy employee that comes in one week ago. I was there since the beginning so I know pretty much how everything works. One time, I was just showing how to makes the sandwiches to him while we were in a big rush and he already told me to calm down a bit. I understood at this time because it was his second shift, i was talking fast and it might’ve been overwhelming for him. 
It’s now been several days that i work with him, and he doesn’t do nothing. He’s just waiting on the boss/chef to tell him what to do or he just zone out or waiting. My boss don’t like me telling him what to do because it’s “not my place”. 
 Today it was very calm, and while the chef was busy outside. He just sat down, while i was doing the dishes, took commands, make them, doing another task while the fries is getting ready. 
So later that day, the chef’s girlfriend asked to make a plate so she can take pictures of it and post on Instagram. I was like “No it’s too much pressure on me lol it has to be beautiful and everything I prefer someone more experienced to make them.” Like it’s wasn’t a joke but i was kinda joking you know. He told me he could watch to see the colour of it while it fried if i make them so i don’t have to worry about it. I said “no the shape of it matter i prefer someone else to do it”. I then bent down to put something in the fridge. He said something then i just kinda ignore bc he was already frustrating me that day. He then call me by my name and told me to get up. And i got up kinda by curiosity. He said; you have to calm down… don’t stress.. Inspire… expire… 
I didn’t know how to react cause i didn’t want to be a b*tch but what are you saying?? I just looked at him like Wtf? 
Later i complained to my boss that he has no business telling me to calm down and his girlfriend was looking at me like she thought it was funny and she said “he’s a bit sarcastic” and i said “no he’s not” 
they didn’t respond 
did i misinterpreted something? AIO?

1lqb2di,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1lqb2di/the_last_straw/,The Last Straw,"It was hard to be angry with the Xerithans, but every person has their limits. I was now beyond mine to the point of breaking.

As a race, the Xerithans are kind and helpful to a fault. They will give you the shirt off their back and then offer you their pants and underwear to go along with it. They are truly kind and generous, and only want to do whatever they can to assist other sapient beings have a happier life.

Early in their days of spacefaring, the Zargon Empire discovered them and moved in with a fleet bent on conquering this budding race and stealing all the resources from their system. They were met by a Xerithan diplomatic delegation which quickly negotiated work parties to not just strip the entire system for the Zargons, but to willingly go into unexplored and dangerous uninhabited systems to mine resources there as well. After all, these new neighbors needed help and the Xerithans lived to make everyone's day a little brighter!

Needless to say, this helped feed the great Zargon war machine and took them from a two-bit wannabe aggressor to a menace that conquered half the galaxy. For centuries the Xerithans fully supported their power mad overlords, responding at every turn with a catchphrase of, ""Oh, let me help you with that!"" After nearly a millennia the Zargon Empire collapsed.

In a nutshell, they had forgotten how to do things themselves as the kindly Xerithans stepped up to help the Zargons with anything and everything they desired. In the end, they retired to a luxury planet where they now concentrate their efforts on ritualized combat. All fully supported by the Xerithans, who remain all too happy to serve their fellow sapients.

My situation here was a good example of what it's like to work with them on a more individual level.

My story with them started after I was fired from my previous job. I told the Sirgathian captain at the Nerbic Mining Platform he couldn't add a 10th mining laser to a system designed for six, especially since we were already experiencing constant blown breakers and melted conduits. He bought the upgraded power plant that could handle 10 mining lasers, so I would connect a 10th mining laser and make it work - or else he'd fire me and destroy my reputation so I wouldn't work again in this sector.

I did as ordered but with a stern warning both verbally and in writing that the primary power couplings were insufficient to handle the increased power load and would likely fuse. What I didn't expect is the power couplings not only fused but then created an arc fault which then blew out the captain's shiny new upgraded power plant. Being the absolute pile of ignorant crap that he was, the Sirgathian blamed everything on me and did his best to ensure I couldn't even get work as a biowaste cleaning technician.

After three months of struggling to find any work, a Xerithan freighter came into the station and advertised a position for a mechanic. I took a chance to apply, and they actually gave me an interview. Because of course Xerithans will interview every candidate, even if completely unqualified. It's just the polite and respectful thing to do!

Luckily, I had the right certifications and fit the bill nicely. They heard my story and felt I would be the greatest investment of all the candidates as I not only could do the job, but my story had the most significant opportunity for them to better the life of a fellow sapient. So, I was hired at a rate 25% above standard and got a ride to a completely new sector for a fresh start.

At first, things were quite nice. They offered to serve me meals in my quarters. They would happily take care of my laundry without any complaints, despite the fact that oils excreted by humans can give Xerithans a nasty rash. It almost felt like a luxury cruise with some occasional work tossed in to keep things interesting. Then some problems arose.

They started to try to find ways to make my life better. At first, it was thoughtful but misguided. My plush toilet paper disappeared into the recycler only to be replaced by a reusable bio-sponge that felt like sandpaper when used. This replacement, they argued, would perform the job faster and better while also exfoliating. As if certain parts of the human anatomy need daily exfoliation.

Next, they had concerns about my food intake and wanted to ensure I didn't consume any dangerous or unhealthy chemicals. One night, they decontaminated my coffee after scanning it and finding multiple chemical traces with no nutritional value. Including caffeine and all the major flavor compounds. I discovered this in the morning when I made a cup for myself. Well, I made the coffee after arguing with one of my Xerithan crew members for 15 minutes that yes, I was happy to do it for myself and no, I wasn't angry with them just tired and wanting to perform a pleasurable daily ritual. It was pleasurable until I took the first sip and got nothing but dirt flavored water.

Now, such things often happen when two species encounter one another for the first time. There will be cultural and biological misunderstandings, and humans and Xerithans had only been aware of each other for a few years and primarily lived in different sectors of the galaxy. We were only just starting to cross paths, so it was understandable mistakes would happen.

But this? This was the last straw. I didn't care how nice the Xerithans were or how well they paid, I was done and getting off the ship immediately. There are just things you should never do, especially to a mechanic if you valued them at all. We hadn't yet left this sector of space, so my former Sirgathian captain could still make my life a living hell. But dealing with that was preferable to this.

In a near rage, I started gathering all my tools and shoved them into the nearest bags and cargo boxes. It didn't matter what went where, as long as it was packed. I then went to my quarters and packed up everything I owned. Again, it all went into the closest bag rather than be neatly packed. My packing complete, I stormed down the hallway towards the airlock to enter the station.

On the way out, Captain Rillia waved a friendly claw in my direction in her best attempt to copy the human gesture. ""Greetings, Human Mechanic Bob. How do you fare on this fine time unit called a day?""

""I QUIT!"" I yelled out as I stormed out the airlock dragging my bags behind me.

\-----

Captain Rillia was stunned by Bob's actions and sought out Chief Engineer Spatish to discuss the sudden departure of their newly hired mechanic. Finding the older and wiser being resting in the galley, she approached to inform him of events.

""Chief Engineer, I have some upsetting news,"" she said with both claws turned down in sadness. ""Human Mechanic Bob has quit and walked off the ship, and I fear they will not be returning. Have there been any incidents which might have caused him undue stress?""

The Chief Engineer thought for a moment, then shook his claws up and down in a display of utter confusion. ""Honored Captain, I cannot think of anything which would have disturbed Human Mechanic Bob. Last night, I entered his workspace and observed it to be quite disorderly. I spent two sparqs organizing his tools into the most efficient and logical arrangement possible. I estimate his repair efficiency would have increased measurably with this pleasing new organization, so it should have brought joy. I suspect he received unfortunate news from a family member or something else outside our control occurred.""

1 - the drivers refused to let me in with a gas station coffee, told me to either drink all of it right away (which obviously I couldn't do as to not get sick), or to toss it away before entering. It had a fucking lid, it wouldn't spill. 

2 - The food / beverages trays are broken. They're not closing up. They just sit there, half open. Can't close it. 

3 - No Wi-Fi. Literally. Zero. Nada. 

4 - They keep patrolling to make sure passengers are in assigned seats, and when 2 passengers swapped (they both wanted to btw), they got reprimanded and had to return to their booked seats. 

5 - They reprimanded someone for eating. Literally. Apparently now that's now allowed here either. 

6 - You know how air conditioning, light etc are meant to be ABOVE YOUR SEAT? Here, they're in between the seats of you and the people before you, so if you want to turn the ac off?? Ha, good luck if the people in front of you don't want to. 

7 - THERE LITERALLY ARE NO CURTAINS. It's 1:40am rn, so that's fine for now, but what the hell am I supposed to do when it'll be noon?? I don't exactly want sun in my eyes.

8 - The seats don't recline. 

9 - THEH DISPLAY THE WRONG TIME. Their display shows it's 2:40. It's 1:40.

10 - The charging ports are in between seats, and only one of them is working. 

11 - They made an announcement that they won't be making any stops whatsoever, only at bus stations to get other passengers. 

12 - The entire bus smells. And not because of the bathroom. It just stinks. I got in at its first stop, the bus was empty, and it already smelled like shit. 

13 - Speaking of the WC, it's off limits too :)

14 - Somebody forgot to turn down their volume and for a second there was a loud noise when they turned on a video or something, and they got reprimanded for that. 

15 - The seats are dirty and sticky and super uncomfortable.

1lqazgp,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorwriters/comments/1lqazgp/sizzle/,Sizzle,"  I’m a 22-year-old woman living in Duskfield, Montana. Another grueling shift at Kitty’s Café, a tired, run-down little restaurant, finally comes to an end. My feet ache as I gather my things, the weight of the day settling into my shoulders. I’m bone-tired, more than usual, but at least it’s over. I walk toward my car, the dull glow of the streetlights casting long shadows on the pavement. The chill in the air feels more biting now, and I feel like something or someone is watching me.

My old, beat-up car sits under a dim light, its paint chipped, its engine a constant reminder of how little I have. But it’s mine, and I’m grateful for it. Still, as I approach, the sensation that I’m being watched crawls along the back of my neck. I glance around, half expecting to see someone lurking in the shadows, but the street is deserted, as it always is at this hour. I try to shake it off. Maybe it’s just my paranoia—I've always had a tendency to overthink things—but the feeling stays, like a cold hand on my spine, an unsettling presence that won’t let go. I slide into the driver’s seat, my hands gripping the wheel tighter than usual. The car groans to life, and I pull out of the parking lot, but even as the headlights cut through the dark, that nagging feeling lingers, refusing to let go. I look in the rearview mirror, and for a second, I swear I see someone moving in the distance, a shadow darting just out of sight. I tell myself it’s nothing. I’ve just worked a long shift. But as I drive through the empty streets, the night feels suffocating in its silence. The strange feeling I can’t shake is like a weight in my chest, heavy and persistent, tugging at my thoughts. Something’s wrong. I just can’t figure out what.

I arrive at my house where my grandma greets me with my favorite dinner. “Vera, I made spaghetti carbonara! It’s on the table for you.” She says. “It’s amazing!” My aunt exclaims with a mouth full. I smile and thank her and take it up to my room. When I get to my room, I notice the door is open. Weird. I swear I locked it. Didn’t I? Maybe I’m just forgetting things.  I ask my family about it, but they insist it’s always locked. “Are you sure you locked it, honey? Maybe you’re just forgetting.” My grandma says, trying to reassure me. But her words make me doubt myself. Maybe I am losing my mind. I sit at my vanity with my dinner, trying to shake the thought from my head. Then it hits me—tonight’s girls' night! I hurry and eat then I get ready to go out.  I Uber to the bar to meet my friends.

By the time I arrive, it's almost 10 p.m. I’m always the first one here, sitting at the bar waiting. That’s when he sits down next to me. A man named John. He’s a very attractive man with short brown hair, a stocky build, and stands about 5’9.

""I’ve seen you here before, haven’t I? You work long shifts, huh? I can always tell by the look in your eyes. You’re tired. But still, you’ve got this… energy. Something about you is different. I like that."" He says.

“Yeah, I guess I work a lot. It’s kind of exhausting, but you get used to it.” I reply, looking around for my friends. He offers to buy me a drink, I’m unsure about taking drinks from strangers so I shoot him an unsure look.

“I don’t bite, you know. I’m just here to help you relax. I can see how hard you’re working. I’m just here for a little company, too. It’s just a drink… What’s the harm? One drink, and I’ll disappear before your girlfriends get here. We’ll make sure it’s a good night for you. No one will judge you for wanting a little fun, right?”

 As the night wears on, the buzzing excitement of the bar suddenly begins to blur. John’s conversation is starting to feel distant, muffled as if I'm hearing it from underwater. My vision flickers, like I'm watching a scene through frosted glass. At first, I think it’s just the alcohol—the casual buzz creeping in—but something doesn’t feel right. It’s different. My thoughts don’t string together the way they normally do. They slip and slide, like trying to catch water with your bare hands. I blink hard, trying to focus, but the room feels like it’s tilting, and a strange fog starts settling into my mind, thick and unrelenting. I try to steady myself, shifting my weight on the barstool, but it’s as if gravity’s playing tricks on me, pulling me down in a way I can’t fight. My limbs feel heavier than usual, sluggish, like I’m wading through syrup. The dizziness hits hard now, a cold panic spreading through my chest. My heart starts to race, and my palms go clammy.

 

Why am I so dizzy?

 

Then the thought hits me. How did he know that I was waiting for my friends?

 

My stomach churns uneasily, and I place a hand on it, trying to quell the unease. Something’s off. The world feels too big, too loud, too fast. My tongue feels thick in my mouth. I can’t swallow right. I try to push the thought away, but it's like a whisper growing into a scream in the back of my mind.

 

Did he do this? Did he spike my drink?

 

The realization crashes over me with brutal clarity. A wave of icy terror floods my veins. The world is spinning faster now, uncontrollable. The walls start to close in. I fight it, try to stand, but my legs feel like they’re made of rubber. I barely make it a step before they give out, and I grab onto the bar for support. I can’t breathe. My chest feels tight, constricted, as if I’ve been shoved underwater. The realization that I’ve been drugged doesn't settle slowly, but crashes into me all at once, like falling from a great height, the ground beneath me suddenly gone. Panic grips my throat as my mind starts to scatter. Is he still here? What is he planning? How could I have been so stupid? How could I not have noticed? Where are my friends? I want to scream, to shout, to ask for help, but my voice feels lost, swallowed by the fog in my mind. My thoughts are breaking apart, jagged, disjointed, as if someone has scrambled them all up. I can’t even think straight. What’s happening to me? What have I done? Why can’t I move? Why can’t I stop him? Where are my friends?

The panic surges again, but it's like a dull roar in my ears. The adrenaline kicks in, desperate, pushing me to act—to run—but my body doesn’t respond. It’s as though it’s not mine anymore. My fingers tremble uncontrollably as I try to focus, try to remember the steps, the way to move, to escape.

 

But it’s too late.

 

His hand is on my shoulder. My blood runs cold. Then everything shoots to black.

 

 

 

 

*My head throbs. The seatbelt digs into my shoulder. I blink—and there he is, driving. That same cologne. That same voice.*

*It’s him.*

I see my house in the distance. How does he know where I live?

The house is so close I can taste it. He slows the car to take the turn—  
I don’t wait. I throw the door open and hit the ground running. My knees scrape pavement, but I don’t stop. Not until I’m inside.

Panic surges through me. I scream for help, my voice cracking as I call for my family. The silence that follows is suffocating. They have to be home—they HAVE to hear me. But what if they don’t? What if no one can stop him?

Just as I’m losing hope, my aunt and grandma rush down the stairs. I flash a stare at John while he walks through the front door.  John’s fingers graze the gun at his waist. He doesn’t pull it out, but the movement is chilling—his mind already made up. My family tries to help, but it’s too late. Two shots ring out, and my aunt and grandma fall, blood staining the floor. He kneels by Aunt’s body. Checks for a pulse. Wipes her blood off his hands like it’s paint, as if it’s nothing. I want to vomit, but I can’t look away. If this isn’t the first time, it won’t be the last.

His grip on my arm is iron, unyielding as he drags me out of the house. I can smell the stale cigarettes on his breath as he pulls me toward the car, the gravel crunching beneath my feet. It feels like a dream, the nightmarish kind. John shoves me toward his trunk, but somehow, I break free and run. I don’t look back, just push my legs harder, faster. The street is eerily silent, the dim lights casting long shadows, stretching like fingers reaching for me. I can hear my breath, sharp and ragged in the stillness, each step echoing like it’s the last. I stop to listen. Was he gone? A shadow at the end of the street tells me he’s still there, closing in with slow, deliberate steps.

As the dizziness grows again, my legs go weak and I fall to the ground. I try to get up again. But the moment my feet hit the floor, my legs buckle beneath me. It’s as if the ground itself is pulling me down, dragging me into the abyss. I stagger, trying to steady myself, but everything is spinning—his voice, the lights, the people—everything blurs into one chaotic mess. My heart is pounding in my chest now, each beat an echo of the fear that’s rising in me. My feet are leaden, unresponsive, and before I can catch my balance, my knees give way.

The cold concrete of the sidewalk slams into me. Hard. A sharp sting shoots through my palms as I scrape against the rough surface. I gasp, the air knocked out of my lungs. My legs are still numb, shaking uncontrollably, and my head spins in slow, dizzying circles. For a moment, I can’t even move. The pain in my hands is distant, far away compared to the terror clawing at my insides. I try to push myself up, but it’s like the world is pushing back—pushing me down, holding me in place. My vision wavers, flickering like a broken light, and I know I’m running out of time.

 

I need to get up. I need to run.

 

And then, I hear it…

 

Footsteps. Heavy, deliberate. They're closing in, too close. I try to scream, to call out for help, but my throat feels thick and strangled. My breath is coming in short, shallow gasps. His shadow looms over me.

 

John.

 

He stands over me with a deranged smile that makes me feel sick all over again. “Get up.” He insists. But as I try to stand, my body betrays me again. The world tilts, and before I can even react, I crash back down to the pavement. My hands scrape against the rough concrete again as I try to push myself off, but it feels like I’m moving in slow motion. Every part of me screams to run, but my limbs are uncooperative. Everything feels heavy—my head, my body, my soul. He’s still standing over me. He roughly grabs me by the arm and picks me up off the cold pavement. “Run.” He calmy says. I somehow get the strength back and run for my life.

I cut through someone’s backyard, hoping to lose him. I find a window and slip inside. The house is musty, stale with the scent of damp wood and a faint trace of cigarette smoke. Someone had been here recently—but who? I crouch in the bathroom, heart hammering in my chest. The silence is deafening. I can’t stop shaking. My dry mouth is like dust, the bitter taste of fear on my tongue. My fingers tremble as I brush over the rough surface of the wall. Every creak of the floorboards outside feels like a warning.

Minutes seem to stretch into hours, and I quietly move out of the bathroom. The stillness of the house is unnatural. Something isn’t right. I find a phone on a coffee table, sweat slicking my palms as I fumble to dial 911. My heart pounds in my ears, drowning out everything else. The room spins, but I push through, trying to stay calm.

Then, a noise—soft at first—creaking behind me. I spin around, but there’s nothing. The silence is thick, like it’s pressing in on me. I hear something in the kitchen, the sound of a pan sizzling. The smell reaches me first, like a sharp, metallic stench that cuts through the air.  I can feel it in the back of my throat, coating it with a bitter taste, like burnt oil and something... awful. Something raw, something wrong.

I creep down the hallway, and through the open door, I see an old man on the floor, face down in a pool of blood. This must be the poor homeowner. His calf is missing a chunk of flesh.

I step back into the kitchen, my heart hammering in my chest. The first thing I see is the pan on the stove—hot and crackling with heat. The meat inside is searing, turning brown, the edges curling and crisping. The sound of it—sizzling, bubbling—is like an eerie whisper, a constant reminder of what’s happening. But I can’t pull my eyes away from it. I feel like I should, but something keeps me rooted to the pan. It’s not the meat itself that stops me. It’s the thought of the old man. The way he lay crumpled on the floor. His body twisted and lifeless, the pool of blood spreading beneath him. But there’s something else—something that pulls at the back of my mind.

I look again, eyes shifting from the pan to the old man’s body. The sight of his mutilated leg sends a cold wave of dread straight through me. His calf has been torn. A jagged wound stretches across the exposed muscle. And it’s not just cut. No. There’s a chunk missing. It’s been taken—ripped out—like someone had planned it.

 

My stomach lurches. The connection hits me like a lightning bolt..

 

It’s not beef. It’s not pork. It’s not some butchered cut from an animal.

 

My heart pounds, thudding so loud in my chest that it drowns out the sound of the sizzling meat. The pan. The flesh in the pan. The old man’s leg. The jagged wound. The chunk that’s missing. I don’t want to believe it, but the more I stare at the meat in the pan, the clearer it becomes.

 

It’s human meat.

 

The thought doesn’t come slowly. It doesn’t creep in with soft steps. It crashes down on me, a tidal wave of horror. My mind scrambles, trying to hold onto something stable, something real, but there’s nothing left to hold onto. The sizzling, the smell, the missing flesh—it’s all part of the same twisted, unimaginable truth.

I feel bile rising in my throat, thick and heavy. My stomach churns violently, but I can’t look away. I want to, I need to, but it’s like my body is frozen, my mind trapped in a nightmare that refuses to end. I can feel the blood draining from my face. The reality of what I’m seeing is too much. It’s too raw. Too real. Too horrifying. I can’t believe what’s happening.

My legs nearly give out from beneath me, and I stagger backward, my body shaking uncontrollably. I need to get away. I need to run.

 

But where would I go? What could I do?

 

I stumble back, bile rising to my throat. My hand reaches for the wall, but I can’t find balance. That’s when I hear it—his voice, too close. He lunges through the hallway. I grab the hot pan from the stove and smack him across the face, he falls to the floor. I run toward the front door.  I slam into it, but it won’t open. John grabs my ankle, pulling me back. I kick. Hard. My foot connects with his face, a sickening crack reverberating in my ears.

I burst through the front door and sprint down the street, adrenaline surging. The sound of his footsteps behind me are relentless. I can’t stop. I can’t think. I just have to keep moving.

I reach an intersection, then a parking lot with some type of pop-up fair of some sort in the distance. I approach the partying people, desperation drives me through the crowd, begging for help, but no one moves. They just watch, eyes wide, mouths agape. The world goes quiet, and I’m alone in the middle of it all. Then I hear it. My name.

 

“Veraaaaa.”

 

It’s John. The crowd parts, and I see him standing there, a smile twisting his lips. The only exit is behind him.

I keep running, my mind screaming at me to get out of there. He grabs me by my hair, dragging me to the floor. A man from the crowd yells at John, but I beg him to stay away. Johns got a gun, I know he will shoot. But the man doesn’t listen. John lets him grab me with a smile on his awfully handsome face. Two police officers rush toward us. For a moment, I think I’m safe, but the next thing I hear is a gunshot. One officer drops to the ground. I duck, my heart racing. John moves closer, the gun aimed at the other officer, a steady, calculated look on his face. And then my safety shatters. Two more shots. The other officer and the man who tried to help me fall, lifeless.

 

The gunshot cracks through the air like thunder. I flinch. My hands go to my ears. But no one else moves. The crowd… just stands there. Eyes blank. Faces frozen. Like mannequins in a storefront window. One woman blinks slowly, lazily, like nothing just happened. A man sips his drink. Another chuckles at something unheard. No one screams. No one runs. The world around me feels like it’s stuck in the wrong reality.

 

What is this place?

 

He calmly walks up to me touching the base of my neck. John’s grip tightens, his voice cold and venomous. “If you keep making stupid decisions, you’ll keep getting people killed.” His eyes burn into mine then the smile creeps back, slow and sure. “You think you can run? You’ll be running forever, darlin’.”

As we walk towards the exit, a group of three women enter. John looks at them. A plan forms in my mind. I know it’s risky, but I have to try. I tell him I can get him one of those girls if he lets me go. He’s hesitant, but intrigued. He agrees. Somehow, I manage to convince one of the girls to walk around the fair with him. She’s hesitant, but she follows. John smiles at me as they walk away, that same twisted, knowing grin.

I tell the other women that I’ve had far too much to drink and I just want to go home. One of the women offers to give me a ride. I rush with them to their car. We drive off, relief washing over me—until the driver suddenly stops the car. She gets out to grab water from the trunk, insisting it’ll make me feel better. Panic surges through me. I beg her not to, but she doesn’t listen. When she opens the trunk, she screams.

 I slowly get out of the car to see what she sees. The girl. The one that I insisted on going with John was dead. Red, seemingly painful hand marks around her throat. A note nailed to her chest:

 

“It’s your fault.”

 

I bolt away from the car and the screaming women. But as I run, a car comes speeding toward me. It’s John. He’s not stopping. ""Move those legs!"" he yells. ""Run!"" The car barrels toward me, the headlights blinding. I don’t have time to think. I leap—too late. The bumper hits me, sending me crashing to the ground. I scramble to my feet, ignoring the pain, pushing my body harder. I won’t give up. I spot an alley, a narrow passageway.

I nearly reach the alley, I hear the footsteps behind me, closer than ever. The unmistakable click of a gun. I freeze, but it’s too late. The shot rings out, pain exploding in my shoulder.  I don’t stop. I can’t. I dive towards the alley, my body screaming for rest, but there’s no time. Not now. Not with him so close. Another shot. It somehow misses me. Then the alley’s ahead. Just one more step.

 

Bang.

 

I’ve hit the ground, but I don’t know how. My mind is a blur, my hands slick with blood—my blood, his blood, I can't tell anymore. I push myself up, but the pain is unbearable. My body refuses to obey, every movement sluggish and heavy. I look down, and I see the blood staining the alley around me, dark and pooling. It’s all too much. My chest is heaving, my lungs fighting for air that doesn’t seem to come.

 

But then I hear it. A car. Tires screeching, coming closer.

 

I turn my head, vision doubling and spinning. A figure steps out of the car—John again. The same man, the same cold, dead eyes. He doesn’t even need to speak. I know what’s coming next. The same pattern. The same chase. And suddenly, I realize—there’s no end to this. Not for me. Not for him.

He’s not running toward me. No, he doesn’t have to. He knows I can’t run anymore. His eyes meet mine, and there’s no surprise, no anger. Just an awful, silent understanding between us. He’s been here before. He knows this dance too well. I see the glint in his eyes, the same calculation, the same coldness that’s haunted me from the very start. And that’s when it hits me. The realization, slow and steady, like a sinking weight in my stomach.

This is it. There is no escape. There never was.

 

I was doomed the moment he sat down next to me at the bar. I’ve been running in circles. All this time, running and running, but always coming back to the same place. The same moment. The same ending. No matter what I do, no matter how many times I think I’ve outsmarted him, it’s the same. I am stuck in this cycle with him—caught in a loop that has no end. A game I can’t win. I want to scream. To lash out. But I’m too tired. My body is betraying me. I can barely keep my eyes open now, the weight of my exhaustion and loss of blood pushing me down, dragging me under.

John takes a step closer, his boots crunching against the gravel. I can hear every movement, feel every inch of the distance between us. He knows I’m not going to fight anymore. He’s seen it in my eyes, felt it in my movements. I can’t keep running. I can’t keep pretending. The gun is in his hand. I see it, gleaming under the streetlight, and for a moment, I think maybe I’ll finally feel the relief of the end. Maybe this is it. The end of the road. The moment when it all stops.

 

But then—he doesn’t pull the trigger.

 

He’s toying with me.

 

John kneels down beside me, his cold fingers brushing my hair back from my face, his touch deceptively gentle. His smile is still there, almost kind in its twisted way, but I know better. I know what’s coming. ""You think you’re done? You’re not. I’ll keep you with me, even when you think it’s over. Because there’s no end to this. It’s just you and me."" His voice low, almost a whisper. But I hear it clearly. Like a promise. A curse. I close my eyes, the weight of those words pressing down on me. I’m trapped.

----------------------------------------------

As we age, our skin can begin to show signs of wear and tear. This is especially true for our hands, which are often exposed to the elements and hard use. If you're looking to make your hands look younger, several effective strategies can help. Here are some tips to rejuvenate the appearance of your hands.

### Moisturize Regularly

One of the simplest ways to keep your hands looking youthful is to moisturize them regularly. Dry skin can enhance the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Here’s how you can maximize the benefits of moisturizers:

- Choose a rich, hydrating cream or lotion that contains ingredients like hyaluronic acid and glycerin.
- Apply moisturizer after washing your hands, as this helps lock in moisture.
- Consider using thicker creams at night, perhaps with a pair of cotton gloves to help them absorb better.

### Protect Your Hands from Sun Damage

The sun can be harsh on your skin, leading to premature aging. To protect your hands from UV rays:

- Wear sunscreen with at least SPF 30 on your hands daily, even on cloudy days.
- Consider wearing protective gloves when outside, especially during peak sun hours.
- Apply sunscreen liberally and reapply every two hours if you’re outdoors for extended periods.

### Exfoliate for Smoothness

Exfoliating your hands can help remove dead skin cells and promote a fresher look. Regular exfoliation allows newer, healthier skin to surface. Try these techniques:

- Use a gentle scrub made from sugar or coffee grounds mixed with a little olive oil.
- Exfoliate your hands twice a week for the best results.
- Follow up with a moisturizing cream to hydrate after exfoliation.

### Engage in Hand Exercises

Just like any other part of your body, your hands can benefit from exercise. Regular movement helps maintain flexibility and reduces the appearance of aging. Here are some helpful exercises:

[Discover the secrets to aging gracefully and living life to the fullest with ""Age Slower"" ](https://buy.stripe.com/dRm9AT2JcguL4hv5zF1wY06)  
  
- Stretch your fingers wide, hold for a few seconds, and then relax.
- Make a fist, hold for a count of five, then release. Repeat several times.
- Wrist rotations can also keep joints flexible and reduce stiffness.

### Consider Cosmetic Treatments

If you're looking for more dramatic results, various cosmetic treatments can help rejuvenate your hands:

- **Dermal Fillers:** These can plump up the skin and reduce the appearance of veins and fine lines.
- **Laser Treatments:** Laser therapy can help improve skin tone and reduce age spots.
- **Chemical Peels:** This procedure can promote collagen production and smooth out rough skin texture.

### Drink Plenty of Water

Hydration is key for your skin’s overall health. Drinking enough water helps keep your skin plump and elastic. To ensure you’re adequately hydrated:

[Discover the secrets to aging gracefully and living life to the fullest with ""Age Slower"" ](https://buy.stripe.com/dRm9AT2JcguL4hv5zF1wY06)  
  
- Aim for eight glasses of water a day, or more if you're active.
- Incorporate water-rich foods like fruits and vegetables into your diet.
- Limit consumption of dehydrating beverages, like alcohol and caffeine.

### Eat a Healthy Diet

Your diet plays a significant role in the health and appearance of your skin. Foods rich in antioxidants, vitamins, and healthy fats can help keep your skin looking its best. Consider these additions:

- Include foods high in Vitamin E, such as nuts and seeds, to protect your skin from damage.
- Omega-3 fatty acids found in fatty fish can help maintain skin moisture.
- Fruits and vegetables loaded with antioxidants can combat free radicals and promote skin health.

By implementing these effective strategies, you can significantly improve the appearance of your hands, making them look younger and more vibrant. Remember that consistency is key; make these practices a part of your daily routine for the best results.

The Role of Skincare and Nutrition in Hand Rejuvenation
-------------------------------------------------------

Your hands are often the first place to show signs of aging. That’s why rejuvenating them can have a big impact on your overall appearance. To make your hands look younger, skincare and nutrition play essential roles. By taking care of your skin and nourishing your body, you can keep your hands looking youthful and vibrant.

### Skincare Routine for Youthful Hands

Just like the skin on your face, the skin on your hands also requires regular care. Developing a simple yet effective skincare routine can make all the difference. Here are some key steps to include:

- **Cleansing:** Gently cleanse your hands to remove dirt, oils, and impurities. Use a mild soap that won’t strip your skin of its natural moisture.
- **Exfoliating:** Exfoliate your hands once a week to slough off dead skin cells. Consider using a gentle scrub or a homemade mixture of sugar and olive oil.
- **Moisturizing:** Apply a rich moisturizer daily. Look for ingredients such as shea butter, hyaluronic acid, or glycerin, which provide deep hydration and nourishment.
- **Sun Protection:** Protect your hands from sun damage by applying a broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher. This step is crucial, as UV rays can accelerate aging.

### Night Care for Hands

While you sleep, your skin is in repair mode. To take advantage of this natural process, establish a nighttime care routine:

[Discover the secrets to aging gracefully and living life to the fullest with ""Age Slower"" ](https://buy.stripe.com/dRm9AT2JcguL4hv5zF1wY06)  
  
- **Apply a Night Cream:** Choose a thick, nourishing cream specifically designed for hands. Ingredients like retinol can promote cell turnover and improve skin texture.
- **Use Cotton Gloves:** For maximum benefit, wear cotton gloves after applying night cream. This helps trap moisture and allows the cream to penetrate deeply.

### Nutrition for Healthy Hands

Your diet also significantly affects skin elasticity and overall health. Including specific nutrients can help keep your hands looking youthful:

- **Hydration:** Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Staying hydrated promotes skin elasticity and reduces the appearance of fine lines.
- **Healthy Fats:** Incorporate foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, walnuts, and flaxseeds. These fats help maintain skin moisture and firmness.
- **Vitamins:** Include a variety of fruits and vegetables in your diet. Vitamin C, found in citrus fruits and berries, is vital for collagen production, while vitamin E, found in nuts and seeds, helps combat oxidative stress.
- **Antioxidants:** Foods rich in antioxidants, like leafy greens, blueberries, and dark chocolate, protect the skin from damage and promote a radiant glow.

### Additional Tips to Rejuvenate Your Hands

Beyond skincare and diet, there are other practical tips to enhance the youthfulness of your hands:

[Discover the secrets to aging gracefully and living life to the fullest with ""Age Slower"" ](https://buy.stripe.com/dRm9AT2JcguL4hv5zF1wY06)  
  
- **Avoid Harsh Chemicals:** Limit exposure to cleaning agents and harsh chemicals. Whenever you clean, wear gloves to protect your skin.
- **Stay Active:** Exercise improves circulation, promoting healthy skin and vibrant hands.
- **Consider Professional Treatments:** If you’re looking for more significant results, consult with a dermatologist about treatments like chemical peels, fillers, or laser therapy.

Implementing a well-rounded approach that includes a tailored skincare routine and a nutritious diet can be transformative. By prioritizing the health of your hands, you can effectively combat signs of aging and keep them looking youthful. Remember, consistent care is key, so make these practices a part of your daily routine.

Your hands can tell a story about your age, but with proper care and attention, you can rewrite that narrative. Focus on both skincare and nutrition to nurture your hands today for a youthful tomorrow.

### Conclusion

Taking steps to make your hands look younger involves a combination of effective tips and a commitment to skincare and nutrition. By implementing simple, yet powerful habits, such as regularly moisturizing, using sunscreen, and incorporating exfoliation into your routine, you can significantly enhance the appearance of your hands. These strategies not only combat dry skin but also reduce visibility of age spots and fine lines, giving your hands a youthful glow.

[Discover the secrets to aging gracefully and living life to the fullest with ""Age Slower"" ](https://buy.stripe.com/dRm9AT2JcguL4hv5zF1wY06)  
  
The role of nutrition cannot be overlooked in the quest for youthful hands. Consuming a balanced diet rich in vitamins and antioxidants will help nourish your skin from the inside out. Foods high in Omega-3 fatty acids, like salmon and walnuts, as well as those rich in vitamin C, such as oranges and strawberries, play crucial roles in skin health. Staying hydrated also supports elasticity and overall skin vitality.

Both skincare routines and nutritional adjustments can create a comprehensive approach to hand rejuvenation. When you prioritize your hands like you do with your face, the results can be transformative. By regularly pampering them and being mindful of what you consume, you will not just see a change in your hands' appearance, but you will also feel more confident overall. Remember that your hands tell a story about your age and vitality. Investing time and effort into their care is a worthwhile endeavor that can pay off handsomely as you showcase younger, healthier-looking hands. Embrace these strategies and enjoy the journey to rejuvenation!

Every single one of you helped me learn, grow, gain camaraderie, vent/get it out, and most importantly move on.  

It’s time to give up the ghost though.

I wish nothing but the best for my ex, and being here makes me depressed that she may never truly get the help she needs to be happy from within.  *Truly happy*

That she’s going to hide behind her shame and protective self forever.  Always trying to find someone to take the abuse “correctly” instead of doing the hard work of changing herself. 

I haven’t said anything on here or to anyone in real life since the breakup that I wouldn’t or haven’t said to her directly.  I haven’t called her crazy, psycho or anything in that category.  I have kept to what the reality of it is.  She had a diagnosed disorder and she chose to not get the help she knew she needed for it.  That’s it.  

She absolutely had some *stellar* BPD moments, but overall wasn’t half as bad as most people’s experience on this subreddit. And that’s starting to blur lines for me, bring things up in memory I’d rather forget, and question things I would have never questioned before

I don’t need help fetishizing the negative.  I need to heal, and that distortion would only hinder the healing process. 

**Therefore, it’s exhausting being on here.**

Of course I dearly miss and still care for somebody who was part of my daily life for two years.  I’m not a psychopath.. lol but I can’t let this subreddit make her into something worse than she was.  She was bad enough (when she was unmedicated) already…

I woulda been with her until the end (if she put in the effort and got help like she promised she would.)  But she didn’t.  And if she has no interest in being in my life, then **I am ready for this BPD chapter to be over**.  

I was no angel in my handlings of it, but I had built up a lot of resentment because she wasn’t doing *anything* worthwhile about it.  

After knowing that she was able to start therapy free of charge the last six months of our relationship, it made me even *more* intolerable to her episodes and emotions.  And that final stretch is what broke the camels back.  

Yeah it’s scary, yeah it’s gonna be hard.  But few things that better your life aren’t lol 

I did everything I could.  I felt remorse for not handling her better.  After her episodes I would buy her flowers, console her, show her the lights.  Do anything to make her feel better even if she “didn’t deserve it” as she said.  

**I just wanted to make her happy.**

I have changed my life drastically since the breakup.  I got sober, I stopped smoking weed/nicotine, got off Adderall and coffee.  I started dieting, working out/exercising daily, began long overdue therapy (and it’s going great btw), have a new higher paying job, have lost 30 lbs.  All in a little under **10 weeks** since the breakup.  

I truly have no resentment other than her not taking care of herself and doing what she *knows* she needs to do to get better and **be** happier.  And I have zero power over her choices.  

If having boundaries, holding her accountable for her actions/reactions and not just calmly eating the irrational behavior make us “incompatible“.  
Then so be it. 

I’m just kinda over it all.  I’m tired of talking about it.  If she is out of my life and refuses to get help then having my mind stuck on the matter is exhaustive. I’m tired of missing her, tired of wanting to check in with her, help her be happier and not being able to.  

**Therefore, I bid you all farewell.**

It’s not her fault she has BPD.  But it *is* her fault she didn’t take care of herself when she could. The fault of abuse goes on the abuser.  End of story.  

Stay in there everybody.  There’s brightness on the horizon and no pain lasts forever 🙂 

If we were strong enough to go through it, we’re strong enough to heal from it.  

Good luck and God speed ✌🏻

Welcome to bloxburg is a roblox game made in 2016 by Coeptus that was inspired by the Sims but quickly gained its own personality and cult following. When bloxburg was bought by the company [Coffee Stain ](https://coffeestain.com/)in 2023 there started to show a strain in the relationship between players and the developers. After several years of teasing a map update, a new map released on june 28th to people’s anticipation. This is where the drama starts.

Before the map update there was a UI change which many people despised but more and more people started saying that the change was good and would bring new players to the game.

The map update rejuvenated the drama to a bigger scale. some people say that the map was a good change and others are blinded by nostalgia. Other people say that the map change was underwhelming and they barely put enough time and effort into an update anticipated for 5+ years. Tensions have rose between the two sides and the line between complaining and critiquing is growing thin. Overall its a battle of nostalgia vs. change and what's best for the future of bloxburg.

Don't get me wrong I was so excited for a NEW map with NEW PLACES. IT HAS NO NEW PLACES. it's literally the old locations and old everything shoved into a bigger map with EMPTY BUILDINGS. no school, no hospital, no anything. The old map would have been better. Even the player size didn't go up. And this is coming from sm1 who was going after everybody hating on the map getting updated, becuase I thought they would actually add new places, not shove an old nail into a new hole. God damn.

`you guys DID NOT watch the video they uploaded back in April/march about the map and it shows. They literally gave an explanation to all your complaints` 😭

`God you people complain about anything new`

`did you even play it? its been out for 15 minutes, there is a school under construction. This game was WAY overdue for a new map.`

`> OP RESPONDS: It would have been okay if it didn't take 10 years to build this school, mate, I code myself. I've built video games in months with a proper team. They have made 33 million off this empire, adding a school is not that difficult.`

# [So, about the new map](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bloxburg/comments/1lnsvvx/so_about_the_new_map/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

I'm sorry. I truly am but holy shit you guys just can't stop ""complaining"" and ""criticizing"". ""The map is too big!"" ""The grass isn't grassy enough!"" ""The buildings are empty!"" ""Speed limits! Boooo!""

Really? Here is my take on this whole situation... (FULL POST LINIKED ABOVE)

`I'm yet to see the map, but your reasoning for point 2 doesn't seem the best. ""Is it really a big deal?"" just feels like invalidating the criticisms and complaints rather than actually addressing them. There's probably some over-hate for the new stuff, but ""it isn't that big a deal"" doesn't feel like the best response to that.`

`Honestly I’m more sick of people like YOU who try to devalue actual criticism - if Bloxburg devs followed what you are saying then we’d still have the render distance bug, textures overlapping in pizza planet and others, and they wouldn’t have changed the UNINTENTIONALLY low resolution graphics of the grass. Almost no one is complaining about the “empty buildings” because we already realised that they are temporary fillers for new shops and alike 2 days ago. If I wanted to find any actual complaints ( as small in amount as they were ), I’d have to scroll through a swarm of what I like to call “patron saints” of Bloxburg who think their opinion is more valuable just because they don’t complain.`

`You’re blaming people for spending money in game and then having what they spent money on being taken out from under them?? People paid to drive fast in town, and if they’re going to take it away then they should let players refund their fast vehicles because the town is a big part of the game.`

I can hear the stampede of players running to Reddit to complain about the map already. People need to relax a little with this update. The old map was the same for years. Yeah sure there’s things with the new map that could improve but people really be acting as if the entire map is a lost cause.

`its been 30 SECONDS GUYS JUST CHILL OUT ABOUT THE MAP ITS NOT SUCH A BIG DEAL.`

`I have a feeling we’re gonna see a lot of people complaining about people complaining.`

`Your opinion is valid. So are the complainer’s opinions. No need to invalidate anyone’s opinion at all. What we complain about, shouldn’t disturb you, if you like the map.`

`> OP RESPONDS:`  
`They complain just to complain sometimes. I’ve seen complaints about there not being a school when there’s signs saying it’s coming in fall. Fair have opinions but some of the complaints aren’t even fair complaints`",18,1751498807.0,SubredditDrama,5,0.88,False

1lqalum,https://www.reddit.com/r/ausbusiness/comments/1lqalum/web_designmanagement_as_a_service/,Web design/management as a service?,"Hey all!

TLDR: Design, host, manage your small business website for a monthly fee. Worth paying for or not?

I’m starting up a small business that serves other small businesses, and looking to gauge interest and perceived value of other small business owners. This is not a thinly-veiled attempt to advertise or any nonsense, I’m curious on your thoughts!

Basically it seems that for most business owners, websites are either one or more of:

1. Time consuming.
2. Difficult to manage.
3. Expensive.

It seems getting a basic website built costs anywhere from around $1,000-8,000. There’s a lot of DIY “website builders” around like Wix, Squarespace, etc. and maybe they’re fine for some? They still seem to have a learning curve and non-trivial time expense though, at least from those I’ve spoken to about it; and as an experienced web dev, I find their output pretty bloated, clunky and far from ideal (i.e. they make me spew in my mouth a little bit).

I’ve been developing websites and software for 15+ years. Meaning I can confidently design a professional-grade website, and know the ins and outs of making Google love it, optimising it for speed, hosting it, keeping it up to date, and so on. There’s a lot of techno-babble I could stuff in there but I’ll save it!

Now, what I want to do is design, host and manage small business websites for a monthly fee, rather than some huge up-front layout. The idea is I take care of *everything* so you don’t have to, basically marketing my experience and expertise.

I obviously want to keep people as a client so I’m incentivised to continue looking after them, it’s not some quick cash grab. I’d be interested in building long-term relationships with other small business owners and working together to grow their website into a solid return on investment over time.

I figure this is most valuable to small businesses who serve the general public, but don’t have much/any online presence. I’m thinking local coffee shop, barber, lawyer, plumber, etc. - services that don’t need a website as part of their crucial operation per se, but will definitely benefit from people being able to find them on Google.

**So my questions are:**

Is the “full package web design/management as a service” something you think would be valuable to your business? If it is or isn’t, I’d love to hear your reasoning!

Would you prefer to deal directly with “small business owner/sole trader web developer” or would you prefer a bigger company or agency? Again whichever your preference, would love to hear why!

What do you think it’s worth per month? $100? $250? $500? Less? More? What seems “reasonable” to you?

There’s no right or wrong answers! Any and all thoughts are infinitely appreciated! ",1,1751498782.0,ausbusiness,2,1.0,False

1lqai5v,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lqai5v,Help setting boundaries,I (23 F) have a neighbor (45 M) who has Down syndrome. I have a psychology degree and have worked as a direct support professional for adults with developmental disabilities for 4 years. It is easy to set boundaries with my clients at work because there are clear rules about what is allowed and I can clock out at the end of the day and live my life. I have befriended my neighbor and I am having a hard time with boundaries. I believe he has an attachment disorder because of his behaviors. He will text me constantly and get upset when I can’t hang out. He knocks on my door and comes to my other job every day. My other job is a coffee hut and i buy him a coffee when he comes but he will go on the days I am off and expect free coffee. I need to draw boundaries and I am trying but it is delicate because he can get a very quickly when boundaries are set but he is capable of respecting boundaries. I also would like advice on things to do with him or hobbies to encourage. He is obsessed with buying a truck but that will not happen for him. He does not understand that he is different from other people or that he can not buy a truck. He spends the day biking to dealerships in town to look at trucks for hours. What are some things I can do with him or get him involved in that are related to cars/trucks but are not centered around him buying a truck? Thank you.

1lqahdl,https://i.redd.it/g04g3tf3ojaf1.jpeg,Built a free map app to find public outlets—would love your feedback,"Hey everyone 👋

Not sure if this is the ultimate /r/ChargeYourPhone moment or what 😅 but I wanted to share something I built out of personal frustration.

I travel a lot and always end up scrambling for a power outlet in airports, coffee shops, libraries, coworking spaces, even random malls. I got tired of guessing and hoping, so I built JuiceMeUp, a crowdsourced map where you can see and share public charging spots.

✅ Wall outlets, USB ports, wireless pads
✅ Notes like “hidden behind couch” or “only 2 available”
✅ Super quick to add your own pins

Basically… never get stuck at 1% again because you can’t find an outlet.

It’s free, no sign-up needed to browse. Just want people to use it and add good spots.

👉 Download on the App Store

If you want to test it out, I’d love feedback from people who actually care about not being stuck at 1%.

Or even just drop your best IRL outlet finds in the comments here—let’s make it easier for everyone to stay charged. ⚡️📱",2,1751498435.0,ChargeYourPhone,0,1.0,False

1lqafgx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lqafgx,Gentle Monster x Maison Margiela Sunglasses and Montblanc Glasses with prescription review,"I did some searching on 1688 and Reddit and found a seller that sold frames with prescription lenses for ~340Yuan. The 1688 store had been open since 2018 so I thought it’s worth taking the risk and the seller had a big range (gentle monster, chrome hearts, Cartier, montblanc, Dior, etc). I’ve finally received the three pairs I ordered. Got two normal glasses and one pair of sunglasses. I used the same prescription from seven years ago. My eyesight has stayed the same Cba getting another test done.

Seller 10/10

I gave him my prescription via WeChat but you can probably also ask your agent to pass on your prescription. He had an album that he sent to me on WeChat. There were some pairs that I didn’t see on his page but I saw them elsewhere and asked him about. He also had them in stock. He can do any colour lenses for your sunglasses. Sunglasses lenses are more expensive from this seller compared to others. Stayed in contact and let me know when he received payment from my agent. Once he received the payment he fulfilled the order on the same day and shipped it out to my agent. He said he can also do international shipping himself, but I went with agent. Replies to messages fairly quickly, given the time zone difference. All in all, great experience with the seller and would recommend him. Good service.

Gentle Monster X Maison Margiela Sunglasses - 10/10 https://imgur.com/gallery/gm-x-mm-qFT9NMQ 180 (frames) + 360 (lenses)

By far the most expensive pair due to the custom tinted lenses. Also by far the nicest looking pair. The coffee coloured lenses really made all the difference for me on this pair. Frame build quality is pretty nice. I have not tested for UV light blocking. Can’t comment on that. You will have to ask the seller and maybe get them tested yourself if you are interested in that. I think because these are mainly plastic and the hinge quality is pretty solid they will be pretty indestructible. Prescription is spot on. Can see clearly through them. Comes with all the packaging and that stuff.

Montblanc - MB0234O - 10/10 https://imgur.com/gallery/mb0234o-xBfIDsI 180 (frames) + 180 (lenses)

Nice, smart looking. They’re very similar to the square chrome hearts glasses. I don’t got the aura to pull them off, so I opted for these instead. Wore them to work today. Prescription is spot on and had no headaches (I’ve heard it can happen with new glasses at the start, but did not happen to me). Frame feels solid. Lenses came with anti glare and anti blue light coating. Came with case box etc.

Montblanc - MB0099O - 9/10 https://imgur.com/gallery/mb0099o-0uuy0rG 160 (frames) + 180 (lenses)

Frames look nice and the colour is also quite nice in person. Prescription is spot on and hinges feels good. Lenses came with anti glare and anti blue light coating. The only issue I have with these is that I probably chose the wrong ones. The side is a single thin metal piece. I’ll probably have to be a lot more careful where I place these as I’ve got a feeling the metal could bend if I sat on them by accident or whatever. Other than that the hinge and everything feels solid. Can’t really complain. Came with case box etc.

Summary Pretty happy with my purchase given the price I paid. I would recommend this seller. As with anything, time will only tell how long they last before something breaks. I will update the comments on this post if any of them break or anything happens to them. If you don’t see an update comment then they’re probably doing well.",2,1751498286.0,1688Reps,1,0.75,False

1lqae46,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lqae46,"Anyone else who thinks their ADHD isn’t a lack of Dopamine issue? (Instead something else like lack of Norepinephrine, other types of Dopamine dysregulation, etc)","I have been trying to puzzle out what ADHD medications will help me the best as so far I have not had great success with conventional treatments. I started Strattera which helped a little but not quite enough. Next Dexedrine which did literally nothing (other than initial anxiety the first few days), and Guanfacine which tanked my hr/bp so I had to stop. I am starting to find the process a bit frustrating/draining.

I got my genome sequenced by sequencing.com a while ago (not an ad lol), and  recently paid to have extra analysis done on the main 7 superpathways that tend to cause issues (MTHFR is a popular example from the Folate/Methylation pathways).

From the looks of my results it doesn’t look like lack of Dopamine should be my issue which I guess would explain the ineffectiveness of the Dexedrine I tried? I am still thinking of trying at least two more stimulants just to be sure, but this has me thinking of exploring more nuanced planning on treating my ADHD that aren’t just boiled down to cranking up the Dopamine and seeing if it works. From what I am seeing it looks like my issues may source more from Norepinephrine related problems. But also possibly some Dopamine misuse by my body too.

Anyone else doing this kind of research/got some interesting sources to share? I still have a lot more research to keep me busy lol, I have yet to discover what every gene in just the image above does let alone the other 6 superpathways (Histamine, Serotonin, Folate/Methylation, Glutathione, Biopterin, and SAM pathways). That being said I am riding this hyperfixation high while it lasts and would love any more interested resources/info that you all might have 😁",25,1751498183.0,adhdwomen,35,0.81,False

Okay, Reddit fam, I gotta share my latest obsession – a **yellow leather crossbody bag** I snagged recently. I’ve been on the hunt for a while for something that’s both stylish and practical, and I think I finally nailed it.

For context, I’m 32 and work in marketing. I'm constantly running around, whether it’s grabbing coffee, heading to meetings, or just doing errands after work. My old bags were either too big (I felt like I was carrying a weekender!) or too small (hello, overflowing pockets 😒). What I was looking for was a **small crossbody bag for women** that wouldn’t weigh me down but could still hold all my essentials.

I stumbled upon this **croc embossed saddle bag** while browsing online – I think it was on ursupermart.com, actually. I was immediately drawn to the color (I’m a sucker for anything yellow!) and the texture. I’m not usually one for super flashy designer stuff, but the croc embossing gave it a touch of sophistication without being over the top.

The best part? It's surprisingly functional. It's got these organized compartments inside that are perfect for keeping my phone, wallet, keys, and even a lipstick separated. Seriously, no more digging around for 10 minutes to find my keys at the bottom of a black hole! It’s a total lifesaver when I’m trying to quickly pay for something or catch the train.

I think this is the crossbody bag for sale that you should be checking out.

One of the things that used to drive me crazy was juggling everything. I’d have my phone in one hand, my coffee in the other, and my wallet precariously balanced on top. Now, I can just sling this **stylish leather crossbody bag** over my shoulder and go. It’s seriously freed up my hands and reduced my stress levels immensely. It feels so much more carefree.

I was initially worried about the quality, but the leather feels really durable, and the stitching is solid. I’m hoping it’ll last me a long time. I also did a bit of research to **compare crossbody bags** before I bought it. I really wanted something that I felt was affordable designer inspired.

I also love that it’s so versatile. I’ve worn it with jeans and a t-shirt for a casual weekend look, and I’ve also dressed it up with a skirt and heels for a night out. The yellow adds a pop of color to any outfit, and the saddle bag shape is surprisingly flattering. I feel like it just elevates my whole look, you know?

If you're like me and you're looking for something that's both practical and stylish, I'd definitely recommend checking out this **Chic Croc Embossed Crossbody Bag**. It’s honestly been a game-changer for my daily routine. It's made my life so much easier, and it's given me a little boost of confidence, too. Here's where you can grab one: [https://go.ursupermart.com/FdBUca](https://go.ursupermart.com/FdBUca)

Okay, I'm done gushing! Has anyone else tried a similar crossbody bag that they love? What are your go-to bags for everyday use? Let me know in the comments! I’m always on the lookout for new recommendations.

Currently, I am in a 6-month relationship with my girlfriend. We get along pretty well, but have had a few hiccups, especially recently, regarding a boundary I have. Due to emotional abuse that I received from my mother for about 10 years of my childhood before being separated by the court system, I have grown quite sensitive to people yelling at me or raising their voices in an angry tone. 

In the arguments my girlfriend and I get into, yelling does not happen every time, but when she does, I explain to her that I wish she would not do this and would respect my boundary of trying to try her best not to yell. Sometimes, instead of saying sorry or admitting it was a mistake, I have found that she says, “Humans raise their voice and yell when they are angry; you can not expect me not to when it is a natural instinct.”

Also, this same argument happened again about two days ago, she said “a coffee spilled on my mom’s bag,” and I asked “where?” as in the coffee that spilled. She kept pointing to the bag as I kept looking for the spilled coffee and she yelled “ON MY DAMN BAG” thinking I was referring to where it spilled and not the coffee. Later, after I said that, which upset me, but I understood we miscommunicated, she said, “I miscommunicated with her, which caused that to happen.” Also, that “everyone's parents abuse them at some point, therefore I can not use that to justify saying I get upset when she yells.” Later, she said “I did not mean it like that” but that last comment really hurt. 

I wanted to share this because I am not sure if I am being too harsh with this boundary or if I am being disrespected unfairly with this type of response? I have been going to therapy to try and tackle my given trauma but it is certainly a work in progress. Thank you everyone!",2,1751497949.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

- We have 3 children’s birthday parties to attend this month. Gifts are permitted.
- Nespresso pods are not permitted UNLESS I have run out of all other coffee at my house. The only exception is if I run totally out of regular flavored, I can buy one sleeve for guests… which I am not to use.

That should cover all physical products. Re: more intangible/services spend…

- Medical spend is permitted. This includes baby chiro/CST visits, which has helped our son immensely with sleep.
- Meals out are permitted. This is not really a category I struggle with; and in fact, they are often used as a networking tool for me. (My husband and I are both business owners, and it’s amazing how often business happens over a meal). I do have a few things already on the calendar, and I will likely not add anything more than what I’ve already committed to.
- Beauty services are NOT permitted; however, I have a massage gift card, so I will allow myself to use that. 
- Groceries are obviously permitted, but I am going to shop my pantry and freezer as much as possible. 

So… how did day one go ?! Exactly as I hoped! 

- I used what I had in the fridge and pantry to make a yummy wrap for lunch. Dinner was pasta, salad, and veggies. I’m proud of myself for using up the salad kit and asparagus before it went bad!
- I usually use 2 Nespresso pods per day. Today I only used one, opting to make a French press for my second coffee. I also prepped beans for the next day so that I can hopefully repeat that success!
- I spent a lot of time journaling! I also made time for reading.

$$$ Spent:
- Gas (obviously permitted)
- Carpet cleaning machine rental (senior dog had a few accidents)

**Diner Diaries** 



**February 23rd**

I’ve decided to start keeping a journal to chronicle some of the important events here at the diner. I’ll call friends and tell them stories of my experiences, and, well, they convinced me to put it in writing. 

I work as the only server in a small diner. At the end of the main road, in the intersection between the highway and the small coastal road. The aesthetic inside is that of your average 1950’s walk-in diner. Checkered floor, white metal tables, and a radio playing smooth jazz 24/7. We even have a nice, neon ‘Diner’ sign. Albeit the lights tend to flicker. 

I enjoy getting to see all the new faces each day, everyone tends to pass through here. Well, everyone except for Marcus.

Marcus is my only ‘usual’ customer. He’s been ordering at the store for years now. Dressed in his Roman warrior attire, he always sits at the booth in the far left corner of the store. His back to the windows. He rarely says anything, usually just scratching his head, and occasionally he’ll get up and pace back and forth. I don’t talk to him much, nothing left to be said really. It’s become the morning routine to clean his mug and refill it with hot coffee. I like the routine, Marcus is a good guy really. Just indecisive. 

I just heard the entry bell so someone walked in, guess that will be all for today. Will update next time something interesting happens.

  


**February 24th** 

I had to deal with the worst customer yesterday after writing. His prison uniform reeked of urine and gunpowder. He walked in, leaving muddy footprints all over the floor, and sat at the booth demanding a beer.

“Whaddya mean you don’t have alcohol? This place is a restaurant, ain’t it?” The man demanded.

“Sir, this is a family diner, the only cold drink we have is soda. Want to have a soft drink and calm down?” I replied.

He stroked his bald head and slammed a greasy fist into the counter. 

“Well, is there any place around here that will sell me a beer? It’s been years since I’ve had one and I am not gonna give up looking today.”

“Everyone I know who runs diners and restaurants around here don’t sell alcohol either. We get all ages of folks passing through here, and people just can’t be trusted with the stuff. I’m sorry.”

With that he seemed to calm down and asked what I would sell him in a bottle. Gave him an ice-cold Orange Joe on the house. To repay my kindness, the man proceeded to smash the bottle on the table edge and attempt to stab me with it. I immediately grabbed his arm and threw him outside to officer Porter. I rarely have to kick people out, I try to treat everyone equally and with kindness. But most souls just tend to be bad ones.

 I watched Porter shove the man in the taxi headed down the highway. Marcus seemed relieved to see him gone. The smell persisted in the restaurant throughout the day, even after I lit some candles and opened the windows. Maybe the smell wasn’t just the man, perhaps the rats are back. I’ll have to check the floorboards sometime soon.

  


**May 10th.** 

Reading back on this, I realized that I never explained who officer Porter is. He is the cop that watches over the diner. He stays outside for the most part, only coming in when he is off-duty to grab a drink or chat. His car never leaves the lot, and he oversees all the taxis dropping people off and makes sure they reach their proper destinations. 

Every day at exactly 3:16pm he’ll tap the glass behind Marcus and gesture to his watch. Marcus used to meet his gaze, but now he just ignores him for the most part. It’s another part of the daily routine. Porter is a dedicated man, and only uses force when necessary. He speaks with a poor Boston accent, so poor I think he just likes the way it sounds and decided to speak that way. He helps keep me and the restaurant safe. Which I am thankful for. 

The diner itself has gone through many rebrandings over the years, we stuck with the whole tavern look for a long time. But when we hit the 1950’s design, I sent a request to the boss to keep it that way. Boss was very pleased and approved. I really do enjoy working here.

  


**July 28th.**

A girl walked into the diner this morning with tears going down her eyes. She was probably only seven or eight. She approached the counter quietly and picked up a newspaper, using it to shield her face. Unfortunately, the headline for the day was ‘FAMILY OF FIVE KILLED IN GAS LEAK’. So I tried to start a conversation with her before she read too much, if she had learned how to read that is.

“So… what’ll it be today? We’re still serving breakfast, my daily special is pancakes if you would like some.”

She set the paper down and looked at me, tried to force a smile and spoke quietly.

“I like your eyes, they’re very pretty.”

My left eye was green and the right blue, they were a stark contrast to my tanned skin tone and curly dark hair. Green and blue weren’t my only colors, obviously, but I rarely show off the others. I smiled, “Thank you, I like yours too”

She ordered the pancakes and we started talking. Her name was Susie May, and like everyone else she was just passing through. But she was so scared to travel on her own, she didn’t know where she was going. I told her that the nice officer outside would show her where to go and make sure she gets to her destination on time. The meal was on the house as usual. 

On her way out, she even gave a small wave to Marcus. That made me glad, hopefully it helps him along with his decision. Porter helped her to the taxi heading down the side road to the ferry. I knew her destination when she walked in the door, but it still makes me glad. 

**July 28th (Continued)**

I had just finished writing this entry when I heard a rustle coming from the storage closet. Of course it was the rats, they were back. I opened the door to see that a sack of potatoes had been gnawed through. Small remaining lumps of tuber were scattered about the floor. I let out a loud sigh and said

“I know you guys are in here, just come on out and I won’t have to get the broom.”

A pair of red eyes glowed from under a wood cupboard, then another pair, and finally another. Three rats scurried out into the open. The biggest one spoke first,

“You foolish wage slave! Do you not realize that you are trapped here serving your boss? We are the ones who are truly free!”

The other two nodded their heads and murmured in agreement.

“Yeah, what he said. You know that this place will be ours, soon you and Porter along with all you other miserable *workers* will be gone!” said the rat to the right in a higher voice. I sighed louder and replied

“This act again? Your ‘freedom’ doesn’t give you the right to break in here again. It’s not yet time for you to have this place, so just do me a favor and leave now, please.”

The rats took a few steps back, their beady eyes looking for a place in the closet to hide. The second they decided to dash I grabbed the broom in the corner and swatted them towards the door. I continued to shuffle them with the broom out of the closet and then out of the store. I stepped outside, sweeping my ‘guests’ as I went. Porter was leaning against his car and let out a chuckle when he saw me.

“You three again? How many times has it been now?” he asked them, while placing a hand on his baton. The rats were terrified of Porter, and they quickly scampered away in the direction of the city. 

Me and Porter both laughed over the situation, those rats had never respected the rules and it was almost comical how many times they’ve returned. We both knew it wouldn’t be the last time we had to scare them off before our shifts were up.

  
  
**July 29th**

I was just pouring Marcus some coffee when a family walked through the front door. They were in high spirits, laughing as they walked inside and sat down at a table.I greeted them and got their orders. It was a nice family, the father and mother had an oldest son and two younger daughters. 

 They told me of all the family trips they took, where they’ve been so far, and how excited they were to go somewhere once again together. But as we were speaking, I knew their destinations would not be the same. I didn’t say anything. Didn’t want to mess with the time they had left together. Sure enough, two separate taxis pulled up and the family was off. Oh, how they argued and cried with Porter. But the son had his mind set on the city, and to the city he will go. I hate to see families split, but each person has gotta choose for themselves. Hopefully tomorrow is better.  
  


**April 20th**

Shortly after Porter tapped the glass at Marcus, an actor came into the diner. It was no one I had heard of, but apparently she had been in some big movies over the years. I don’t have time for movies, I’ll watch them when I retire. She was dressed in a fancy red dress with a white fur coat, and had fluffy blonde hair with piercing blue eyes. Marcus hadn’t heard of her either, I asked him way later after she left the diner. She ordered the bacon burger with fries and we got to talking. 

“How much do I owe you?” she asked while reaching for her designer purse. “Don’t worry about it, on the house today. ”She was taken back by that response, and insisted on paying while digging through her wallet. 

“I know I have some money in here, I’m sorry sir I just can’t seem to find it… I always keep cash on me to give to people. I just love to be generous.”

That statement immediately conveyed what type of person she was, and I knew she would not be happy with her destination. No matter how much she dug through her purse I knew she wouldn't find any cash, you can’t bring that stuff into the store with you. I reassured her it would be fine, but she just told me I’d get a check in the mail or something. We talked for a while about the various organizations she donated to. Wells in Africa, children's hospitals, she even personally funded the doctor that found the cure to cancer cells. She loved to talk about herself. It was now late in the evening, and she was on her way out the door. 

“Thank you for talking with me sir! I hope to see you again!” 

I knew she wouldn’t, and Porter greeted her when she walked out the door. The taxi pulled up to take her down the highway, but she got very upset and said she was going to the sea. She got hysterical and began yelling at Porter. She was so loud I could even hear her through the glass. 

“Don’t you know who I am! I understand you’re just doing your job, officer, but I am a paying customer of this taxi and I refuse to let it take me where I don’t want to go!” 

Porter remained calm through the whole thing, but after she yelled for an hour he and the taxi driver had to force her into the vehicle. She was going to city, her pride caused her to make that decision long ago without ever realizing it. 



I was almost done writing this entry when the phone rang, the old fashioned dial phone ring always brought good messages with it. 

“Hey this is Angelo at Diner Down, how can I help you?” I answered. 

“Hello, it’s Gabriel from corporate calling to convey a message from the boss. He just announced our final day of work will be exactly seven years from now. Be prepared for a lot of customers stopping by. We will see you soon.” 

This was the message me and Porter had been waiting an eternity for! I saw Porter answer his flip-phone outsider shortly after I hung up, he immediately looked inside at me and burst through the doors.

We cooked a meal for ourselves and spent the evening celebrating. This message was a joy to us, but a cause of panic for Marcus who excused himself to the restroom. Only seven more years. I don’t know how much time I will have to write more entries due to the increase of customers, but I’ll update if I can. 

What a great day!



**October 20th**

I’ve had an influx today of really terrible people. I seemed to have served the last of my good customers three years ago on the 21st of April. Haven’t had any other nice customers since. The rats have surprisingly not shown up again, it seems they are celebrating, or dreading, being on the clock as well. Halfway there.  
  


**April 20th**

I ‘served’ my last customer, a cruel man wearing some sort of military uniform. He took one look inside and turned around for the taxi to the city. The rats were waiting outside, it was a whole swarm of them now. Thousands, if not millions of them dotted the whole landscape. But they stood there silently waiting, because Porter was guarding the door until me and Marcus left. 

For the first time, I flipped the neon sign from ‘OPEN’ to ‘CLOSED’. Took one last look at the diner before reaching out my hand to Marcus. “It’s time to go man, walk out with me.”

He was shaking, and I had to help him up. Our slow steps echoing around the now empty restaurant. I hung the keys around the outside of the door. Porter was there waiting for us. Marcus finally met his gaze, he was still shaking and would have fallen if I wasn’t holding him up.

“Oh good, you’re out. Marcus you can join me and Angelo in this cab here. I know you’ve never ridden in a car before but trust me it’s not all that bad.” Porter said, casually strolling and opening the car door for us. Marucs fell to his knees sobbing, but not tears of sorrow, instead joy.

“All this time… I’ve been able to go across the sea?” he cried. Porter answered,

“Yup, why do you think I’ve been trying to get you to come outside all these years! Now go ahead and take off your armor, it might get a little stuffy in here.”

I’m writing this in the car now on our way to the ferry. The darkness of the city is slowly creeping over this area. I’m trying not to picture the rats roaming freely in the restaurant now. They’re probably making such a mess of the place. But hey, that was always the deal. 

Now that I’m retired, maybe I’ll sit down and finally watch some movies. I don’t know what all the boss has planned for the corporate party, but I’m sure everything will be wonderful from here on out. Now, we get to leave this world behind and move onto the next.

Hey there! I’m a 30-year-old creative in marketing with a dry sense of humor, an adventurous streak, and a knack for turning everyday moments into something worth remembering. I use a wheelchair for longer distances—but that’s just one part of the story. I’m independent, curious, and always up for something fun, meaningful, or wonderfully weird.

	•	Endless Laughs – Wild injury stories that sound fake (but aren’t).
	•	Unexpected Wins – Free upgrades, kind strangers, and the occasional surprise dessert.
	•	Zombie Apocalypse Strategy – I may not outrun them, but I’m clever, calm under pressure, and hard to miss. That’s teamwork.

	•	Zero Time for Superficial BS – Life’s short. I keep it real and intentional.



A Bit More About Me


I’m all about storytelling—whether it’s through books, music, movies, games, or late-night conversations. I love collecting weird trivia, exploring overlooked places, and getting lost in good ideas.

I stay active in my own way: home workouts, nature walks, and traveling whenever I can. I’ve explored the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Colombia, and the Bahamas—and there’s still plenty more I’d love to experience. (Bonus: I speak Spanish, too!)

I’m the kind of person who notices the little things—your favorite song, how you take your coffee, the way you light up when you talk about something you love. I care deeply, listen closely, and show up consistently. Whether it’s building a playlist, discovering a local gallery, or just sharing quiet time, I value connection that feels grounded and genuine.

⸻

What I’m Looking For:

I’m drawn to people who are:

	•	Playful, grounded, and emotionally present
	•	Down to laugh, explore, and be real together
	•	Into thoughtful conversations and spontaneous fun
	•	Comfortable being fully, unapologetically themselves

I’m open to friendship, flirtation, or something more—whatever feels right. Long-distance, age gaps, different backgrounds—all are welcome. I’m attracted to all body types—connection and energy mean more to me than any one look.

Whatever we build, I just want it to feel real and mutual.



Why You Should Message Me:

If you’re looking for someone thoughtful, creative, and emotionally grounded—someone who values kindness, depth, and shared experiences—I’d genuinely love to hear from you.

No pressure. No expectations. Just an open door and a bit of curiosity.

If something here speaks to you, don’t be shy. Say hello, tell me something about you, and let’s see where the conversation takes us.



Let’s Make Memories:

Big trips, quiet nights, deep talks, shared playlists—I think the best connections are built on a little of everything. Whether you’re looking for something serious or just someone to connect with in an honest, easy way, you’re welcome here.

Reach out. I’d really love to hear from you.",2,1751497688.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

I eat like a spartan for breakfast every day: ground turkey or chicken and 1 egg. Just salt and pepper. I will have coffee with a splash of oat milk & sugar, too. 

For lunch, I will do ground chicken or turkey, roasted potatoes, an Aloha bar, and a veggie. Just salt and pepper. The only veggies I’ve been eating the past few days are green beans, green bell peppers, and carrots. 

For dinner, I’ll make a low FODMAP recipe from a Fun without FODMAPs or Dr. Rachel Pauls’ website. 

Is it normal that I’m still feeling this trapped gas? I also had some bloating today.

1lqa4ks,https://i.redd.it/y9zb9kqf7jaf1.jpeg,Man ... Alpha 16.4 was something else,"I took a little trip back to the old alpha and oh boy was it a treat.

First off, it sucks hard ... I started on a random generated map which was okay-ish nature was beautiful and there were still plains biome (a lesser desert biome, but still HOT) most of the time they looked barren and snow biome would usually spawn next to deserts and plain biomes which was super weird, but mountain tops had snow across the highest points which was really interesting, any body of water had a nice lake / pond / swampy ambient with frogs and crickets which was super weird when you had to swim across the sea (yeah the whole world was separated by the sea, no rivers).

Now POI placement was just bad, you'd usually find fat chunks of land floating at the side of a mountain and there you'd find a camp or a non dungeon like 1-2 story houses with VERY RANDOM loot.

This is it when it comes to the world generation (except some larger POIs) random gen was very bad and playing on Navezgane was much better and scarier too.

Combat was very different then now, it was very crude, you couldn't power punch , aiming was very rough and especially aiming with a gun, your hands were shaking as if your character had some nerve illness, but stealth was functional and sleeper zombies didn't wait for a piece of code to wake up, if you ran around the house ( from outside) they'd all wake up inside.

Night were pitch black and very scary because you'd usually get a horde running by or right through your base because they were always set to cross your path and rain/fog always came with a very ominous and thick mist.

The game was very rusty and combat didn't feel that much good, running, looking around moving and jumping all felt like you very playing a minecraft ripoff.

NOW COME THE MERITS OF ALPHA 16.4  
At no point do you get dragged down by a certain playstyle and you have a learn-by-doing system backing you up, you can kill, loot, skin, dig and be able to build a furnace / workbench by day 2-4 and instantly go for higher tier tools, weapons and work stations if you focus on something besides looting fucking books and doing quests all day because some twats forced you to paly that way!

You don't have to depend on traders at all and even if you removed them you wouldn't notice it! There are no loot stages to cock block you throughout the game (it's day 2 in the screenshot and I found a steel pickaxe, an iron shovel and later I found an SMG in on of the treasure maps) and you have to be careful what you wear when you go to explore different biomes, I went to the snowy biome with shorts and a leather poncho that I made for the desert/plains, and I became very sluggish / hungry from the extreme cold, same for the hot biomes but you get very thirsty very fast!  
I had lots of jars and paper on me if I needed some dirty water for boiling and making coffee or yucca juice and for boiling meat, the paper was for blunderbuss (very primitive shotgun rock+paper+gunpowerd = ammo) in case I couldn't ASSAMBLE a gun before the 7th day and even if I could the ammo is very rare but if you set your priorities right you could start crafting ammo quite quickly!

I would have loved to see where this game would be if they stayed on this path of 16.4 in the sense of keeping the same system and progression but updating the preformance, optimization and everything else to be it is now.",22,1751497453.0,7daystodie,11,0.81,False

Trying to lose 50 in total, and I’m worried 12 weeks won’t be enough- what do yall think? 

I had nausea in the first dose and would randomly throw up immediately after eating things like lettuce, chicken, etc. When I moved up to .22 I had essentially a stomach flu for 2 days. I learned the only food my stomach would allow was a baked potato. After a few days it did get better, but I woke up this morning at 5am throwing up my dinner (chicken and broccoli and shisito peppers). I have found that bananas are also a safe food. However, I went and got quiche at a coffee shop later in the morning and my nausea immediately subsided. Same with grilled nuggets and fruit from Chick-fil-A. Has anyone else has this happen? 

Aside from Zofran any other tips for the nausea? I want to make sure I’m eating enough throughout the day because if I don’t things get worse. 

Does everyone stall, like all of the time? My doctor recommended weighing in daily so it could be the psychological effect of that, but damn weight loss is crazy. Any tips?

What if paleo isn’t right for me? I feel like eating only protein, vegetables, fruits, and nuts should be making me feel so healthy and good, but it’s almost like without gluten things are not sitting well. Any suggestions? ",1,1751497299.0,Semaglutide,1,1.0,False

The next day after the tour, Clark was ready to start working. Katy had printed and gave him his key card at the end of the previous day. The guard scanned the card and let him park inside the wall. It was six in the evening, the lot was empty except for a handful of cars. *I wonder which one is uncle’s, could he still be here this late?* Clark wondered. Katy was gone for the day, so he used his card to enter the facility. The smell of spoiled chicken still hung in the air, maybe that was something he could fix today. In the main facility room, he and Nancy shared a computer, used to clock in and out. He could even surf the web on his breaks! Nothing wrong with watching some shows while on a meal break. He had his own facility cart where he could carry all the tools needed. Mop, sponges, rags… you name it, Clark had it. He put on his headphones and began to work. Nothing out of the ordinary happened until a few hours into the shift. A man came out of one of the red sealed doors and made his way down the hall that Clark was mopping. He was an old Japanese man with a small mustache, bald head, shrewd eyes, and large glasses. The man was wearing a white doctor’s gown and sleek black shoes that creaked along the hallway. Clark took his headphones off and greeted the man. 

“Evening doctor, name’s Clark. I’m the new janitor around here.”

 The man eyed Clark up and down for a few seconds, seemingly in judgment. 

“Ah yes, nephew of Mr. Rogers. The last janitor we had left poorly… I hope you will not do the same” said the man. 

Without introducing his own name, the doctor walked away. But not before Clark got a glance at his name tag. 

*Doctor Wu, huh? I think he’s a friend of my uncles… seems like a piece of work* thought Clark. The rest of the shift was spent cleaning desks and bathrooms. He made sure to make the place spotless and empty all trash cans. But the spoiled smell was still in the air. Guess that would have to be a problem for another day. 

Second week on the job, Clark got his first paycheck. It was huge! At least triple the size of his average check from the school. The money pleased him, he used the cash to buy a new set of headphones. The pay was great, but the environment… not so. Something was just… weird about SynMed. All the other workers were quiet and kept to themselves, besides the occasional chat with Nancy and Katy of course. He hadn’t even seen his uncle yet, he hoped to run into him sometime soon. The rooms that Clark wasn’t allowed in had started to pique his interests as well. Maybe it’s just all the cameras, but he could never shake the feeling that someone was watching him. He never noticed anything that might suggest so, but the hairs on the back of his neck would stand up and he would get chills. A seemingly instinctive response to an unwanted pair of eyes. Not to mention he still couldn’t get rid of the foul odor in the air. People acted like he was crazy for smelling anything. They must be ‘blind’ to the smell or something.

*Maybe an animal died in the vents or something… I’ll just check it out later.* Whatever other doubts might cloud Clark’s mind, he would simply shake them away and keep working. After all, fifty dollars an hour is not something to worry about at all. 

After clocking in, Clark struck up a conversation with Katy. 

“Hey Katy, so I’ve been meaning to ask. What is the process exactly for giving someone a replacement body part? I can see that you have purple access, so you must know a lot about this company.”

Katy seemed pleased that he asked, she grabbed her coffee and gestured to the couches in the waiting room.

 “So Clarky, let me tell you a basic representation of our process here at SynMed. A customer comes to us asking for a replacement mold. The term ‘body-part’ can be a little gross, so we call individual organs or limbs ‘molds’. Now, I then schedule a meeting for them with my husband, Wu…”

*What? Katy is married to Dr. Wu? I had no idea…* Clark thought. 

Katy continued, 

“After Wu’s evaluation, we  take a minimum of two weeks to prepare the mold for the person. To do that we draw some blood, then go through a process of mixing it with the mold. I don’t know how it all works, too much science for me. Ask my husband if you see him, have you met him yet?”

Clark answered, 

“Once in passing, he seemed busy and we didn’t get to chat. I haven’t even seen my uncle yet.”

“That isn’t too surprising. Mr. Roberts rarely comes into work. Keep an eye out for a red, sports-y car with yellow lines. I’m sure you know all about those cars and stuff but I don’t know all the different types.”

*Man is Katy a talker…* thought Clark. Katy continued, again, 

“You know Wu and your uncle were friends in college, that's how they met and started this business. Also, there is no better way to learn something than to experience it. Tell you what Clarky, I have a new customer who scheduled a meeting with my husband today. His name is John Elton, a war veteran who needs an arm. I will have you sit in with Dr. Wu and follow up on Elton’s process, m’kay?”

“Sure, that sounds great! Thanks for the chat Katy, I’ve been clocked in for the past half hour I should probably start working no-”

“Oh but wait I haven’t even told you the story of how they met! You see, both your uncle and Wu are big fans of tennis and…”

An hour later, Clark hadn’t started working yet when John Elton walked in the building. He was an old, fat man. Bald headed with a long white beard. He was holding a wooden cane that thunked hard against the wooden entryway floor. And just like Katy stated, his right arm was missing. 

“Hey, John Elton? I’m Clark, nice to meet you”

“Oh, hello young’un, are you this Wu fellow?”

Katy walked up to the man, 

“No, that would be my husband. I’m Katy, we spoke earlier on the phone. Wu will be with you shortly, and Clark here is new so he is going to sit through your meeting if you don’t mind” she said. 

“Oh, sure I don’t mind at all. Mind if I take a seat while we wait?” asked John. 

Clark made small talk with John for a few minutes while they waited. Wu then walked into the room.

“John Elton, come with me for your meeting. Clark, why are you not working?”

 *What a ray of sunshine* thought Clark before replying. 

“I’m gonna sit in on this meeting, I wanna learn more about the company and well, Katy thought it would be good for me to sit in today.”

“Ah alright then, just make sure you’re clocked out. Your uncle will not pay you for dilly-dallying” said Wu. 

Clark and John then followed Wu down the hall. The examination room had a red code door, Clark noticed Wu pull out a purple pass and gestured for them to walk inside. The room looked like your average doctor’s examination room, just even more soulless. Everything was just white and bright. White tile floor, white examination bed, bright white lamp… the room had all the personality of a slice of  bread. Wu told Clark to stand in the corner and listen while John sat on the bed. 

“Oh, does anyone else smell rotten meat? I think someone might have left their lunch in here or somethin’...” pronounced John. 

Clark was about to remark in agreement, but Wu started talking before he could say anything. 

“John Elton, you are seventy-eight years old and live at 104 Aviva lane. You lost your right arm forty years ago while on duty. You now live with your wife, Ophelia, whom you have been married to for fifty-three years. Is all this information about you correct?”

John seemed to have dosed off…

“Sir!” exclaimed Wu. Clark was taken back by his aggressiveness. 

“Oh, uh sorry. It’s just late is all. Yes, that information is correct, sorry doctor” answered John. Wu rubbed his sweaty bald head and handed John some papers to sign. While John read it over, Wu explained the process. 

“Our work here is relatively straightforward, all you are required to do is give some blood and pay. It all starts with your arm. I have many arm molds in the building. I will then use the blood you give to slowly adjust the arm to fit your person. I cannot graft the mold immediately, your body would reject it upon sensing that it is not your own. The rejection of a mold is something to avoid at all cost, the side effects are incredibly painful and irregular. This process will take a minimum of two weeks to finish. When it is done, you come back and we graft the mold onto you. Think of the mold as a blank canvas. As the artist, I must perfect it before giving the work to your person. Do you have any questions?”

Wu had a very straightforward way of speaking. Each sentence felt like a bullet point, like a computer spitting facts as opposed to a person talking. “Oh, uh how do you grow these limbs?” asked John. 

“Our process is irrelevant information to you. Now let's finish these procedures and send you on your way” answered Wu. 

Clark left the room while Wu drew John’s blood and ran other tests. All this information, molds, grafting… it was a lot to think about. Clark too wondered just how exactly SynMed grows these ‘molds’.

After the procedures, Wu escorted John and Clark back to reception. John took a seat while Katy processed the payment. Clark was close enough to hear Wu whisper into Katy’s ear, 

“Make sure John Elton brings a family member to speak on his behalf next time. I will no longer tolerate this buffoon on his own.”

Clark couldn’t understand how Katy could give Wu such a loving look before continuing the payment process. After the day was done, Clark only got more curious about SynMed’s process. 

  


**Chapter Four. Clark**



 There was a red sports car with yellow stripes parked in the lot at work today. His uncle must be at the facility! It would be nice to see him. Clark walked into the building and asked Katy if his uncle was here and if he could finally talk to him. 

“Oh, your uncle is in a meeting with Wu, apparently a customer had their mold reject them and now they’re doing paperwork or something on it. Sorry about that, Clarky.”

He responded, “it seems like uncle is avoiding me almost, but I understand how busy this line of work must be…” 

Clark did have the feeling that his uncle was staying away from him. He was never close with him. As smooth as Tom is with people, he doesn’t like them all that much. 

Clark noticed that Katy was looking uncomfortable with that last remark, so he quickly changed the topic. 

“Say, Wu was telling John Elton about this rejection process, what exactly is it?”

“Oh trust me Clarky you don’t want to know. Especially before lunch time”.

Their conversation awkwardly ended there and Clark went to work.



Cleaning helps keep the mind busy, but it can be tiring. A delivery guy showed up with a bunch of anesthetics, Clark directed him towards Wu’s office and then went on lunch. He was resting in the break room, he got a full thirty minutes for lunch and didn’t know how to spend the time. The thought hit him to check out that website that Nancy had told him about. He opened his phone and searched for a Ethical Genetics website. Sure enough it was the top search, it seems it was created by some activist group.

 *This must be similar to PETA or something lame like that* he thought. But when the page was opened he was greeted by a disturbing image. The quality was not the best, but Clark could basically make out what it was. It was a human torso, white as snow, covered in arms. The head was deformed and shrunken into the chest, it seemed to have its eyes precisely sliced out. There were probably twenty arms growing out of this thing's body, all pure white, and oddly enough all right arms. It was suspended in air by a few hooks and had all sorts of tubes with various liquids pouring in and out of the thing. The image’s splash text read,

 **“THIS IS WHAT SYNMED’S ‘MOLDS’ ARE”.**

The image was revolting to say the least, and any little bit of hunger felt on the lunch break was lost. *Surely this can’t be how stuff is grown here, right? This has to be one of those groups that makes fake information and stuff to make people upset* thought Clark. As disturbing as the image was, Clark continued to read the website. According to this Ethical Genetics group, SynMed uses human bodies as the base for the molds and injects a type of formula that causes the growth of whatever body part is needed. He read about the start of the company back in ‘13, how Wu was the mastermind and uncle Tom was the charismatic businessman. There was a whole section on this ‘rejection process’ from witnesses, and he was about to start reading when the door to the break room quickly swung open. 

“Clark! Just what do you think you’re doing in here?” said a smooth voice with a southern accent. 

Clark could recognise that voice anywhere, even after all these years. 

“Uncle Tom? Oh I was just-”

“Just what, huh? Looking at our critic’s website on our wifi? You gotta be kidding me!”

Uncle Tom was furious, and Clark forgot that Nancy told him to be sure to turn wifi off when he searched for the website. 

“Oh, I uh, I’m sorry Unc- I mean, Mr. Roberts. I was just told to give this website a visit and I thought that-”

“Who told you to visit?” Tom asked, while pulling up a chair to sit next to Clark. His voice was calm now, uncle had a way of doing that. His manner could switch from furious to calm in seconds. Clark sat there for a minute, debating if he should rat out Nancy. 

“It’s okay Clark, I’m not mad. Just a little frustrated given the details of this situation, you know?” Tom gave Clark a reassuring pat on the back.

“Just tell me if it was someone here who told you, and all is forgiven, okay champ?”

Clark had to decide between keeping his co-workers secret or upsetting a family member. Heck not just a family member, his boss. The choice was obvious. 

“It was Nancy” replied Clark.

“Good, that’s all I needed to know” Tom rose from his seat and Clark stood also.

 “Christmas break is almost upon us now, and we will be closed from the twenty-fourth until the first of the new year. You will be sure to get a good holiday bonus for being such a good worker, okay champ? Just don't get too curious is all I’m asking” said Tom. 

“All right Uncle, I’m sorry”

“Hey no need to apologize for being curious, I’m just upset I had to see you for the first time here in a situation like this. Tell you what, let’s go grab a beer after work today, what do you say?” 

What he saw on the website truly disturbed him. He wants to keep his uncle happy, but is what's happening here even ethical? Was that thing he saw *alive*? Those would be questions answered another day. The smell of the facility seemed to get stronger when Tom showed up, but Clark tried his best to ignore it and walked out of the room with his uncle.

The decision that Clark made was not just witnessed by himself and Thomas, but by another. The crawler in vents was upset at the young man’s decision. It’s three eyes narrowed in judgment. But all would be well, the matter would be settled come Christmas break. 



It was now the following day. Clark never got that beer with his uncle. Tom canceled at the last minute, citing ‘an emergency work situation’. This upset him, the day was not off to a great start. 

*Just think, this is the last day of work before christmas break. A whole week off! I can do whatever I want until the facility opens again on the first!* Clark thought. As he was walking towards the door he heard a commotion inside. Sounded like someone was yelling. Not wanting to disturb, he waited outside the building where he could partially hear what was going on. It was Katy’s voice all right, and she was furious. Clark had never seen Katy mad, he didn’t even know there was a mean bone in her body. She was yelling at Nancy, who he couldn’t hear making any form of protest. *Oh man, she must be getting chewed out because I told on her…*

This made Clark upset, but he thought, *hey, better her than me. I wasn’t the one who did anything wrong*.

He could tell now that Katy lies, she puts on a kind welcoming face for reception. But she must be a shrill, mean-spirited person on the inside. No wonder she got married to Wu. 

After a minute or two the yelling stopped, and Nancy left the building. It would seem she had packed all of her stuff. She turned around and saw that Clark was listening. However, there wasn’t any anger in her eyes, only tears. 

“It was a mistake ever working here. SynMen provided me with these beautiful blue eyes… I thought that if I could just work here I could help others in need, but then I found out what actually happens here and…”

She was struggling to not break down, so she turned away to her car. Clark called out to her, 

“Hey Nancy, I’m… I’m sorry for ratting you out. I just didn’t want to upset my uncle and I thought that…”

he trailed off as she turned back around. 

“Walk away from this place while you still can Clark. The help we give here… is not worth the suffering of the ones less fortunate…”

Clark watched as the only truly welcoming face at SynMed left. The thought crossed his mind to leave with her, but it was only for a moment. He was working with *family,* not to mention making a pretty penny doing it. Clark’s mind processed what she was saying.

*She must be talking about the molds, but I mean look at all the good this company is doing! Surely SynMed isn’t in the wrong.*



*Right?*
