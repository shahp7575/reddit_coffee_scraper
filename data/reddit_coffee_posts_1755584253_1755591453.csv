1mucghd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mucghd,Dialing grind for small Vietnamese phin (G7) with Indian robusta - weak/fast brew issue,"**Goal:** Get the classic **strong, punchy iced latte** from a **small Vietnamese G7 phin** using **Indian robusta (Ainmane “Robusta of Coorg”, medium roast)**.

**Setup**
- Small G7 phin (~4 oz basket)
- Coffee: Ainmane “Robusta of Coorg” (medium roast robusta, pure powder)
- Method I tried: two-pass phin, ~16 g coffee + 80 g water each, ~45 s bloom, brewed hot over ice + milk + condensed milk.

**What happened**
- Both passes finished *too fast* (≈2–3 min total).  
- Flow was not centered, it dripped from the **sides** of the basket.  
- End result: weak, watery taste (not creamy or punchy).

**Ask**
- With this **small G7 basket**, do I just need to grind *much finer* (closer to moka/near-espresso, table-salt texture) to slow it to ~4:30–5:30 total drip?  
- Or is the filter size itself the real limitation — meaning I should switch to a **larger phin** if I want a strong 400 ml iced latte?  

**Attachments:**

- Coffee packet photo (Ainmane robusta)

He was supposed to be in a business meeting.

My eyes darted to the background of the video-a hospital.

The screen blurred as I scrolled to the next video.

Hallie, her lips ghosting over Chase's.

And when Hallie turned slightly,I caught it—the smirk.

Hallie had won.And Chase?He had let her.

————————

The wedding binder sat open on the coffee table, untouched for days. Pages of carefully chosen floral arrangements, venue options, and dress designs blurred together, mocking her. It had been two months since her birthday. Two long, lonely months. Not once had Chase acknowledged it. No belated wishes, no thoughtful surprises to make up for it—nothing. The man who once made her feel like the center of his world had suddenly forgotten she existed. She had tried to be understanding. Tried to believe it was just work. Ben had mentioned the Blackwood Group landing a massive deal, which had supposedly kept Chase buried in long hours and endless meetings. But work had never stopped him before. No matter how busy he was, he always made time for her. Now? Now she lived in their penthouse alone.

The silence was deafening. She couldn't even catch traces of his aftershave in the air anymore. The faint scent of cedarwood and spice that used to linger in their sheets had been replaced by the lonely sweetness of her strawberry shampoo. She sat on the edge of their bed, fingers gripping her phone, staring at the only message he had sent that morning.

Chase: You're going to look beautiful in anything you choose.

Emilia exhaled sharply, pressing her lips together. A text. That's all she got. No offer to go with her. No excitement. Just a bland reassurance as if he were talking about what brand of coffee she should buy. With a huff, she grabbed her keys and coat. If he wasn't going to be here, then fine. She had things to do. Her heels clicked against the marble floors as she exited the penthouse, her mind a storm of frustration and aching disappointment. The cold air bit at her skin as she stepped out of her car, staring up at the gleaming glass building of Nexus Care Hospital—one of the most prestigious medical centers in the city. Funded entirely by the Blackwood family. Emilia had been here countless times before. For charity galas, meetings, and to check on patients she had grown fond of during her residency. But today, her steps felt heavier. She needed a distraction. Anything to pull her away from the gaping hole Chase had left in her life. Walking through the pristine hallways, she nodded at passing nurses and doctors, her mind still spinning. Maybe she had been too patient. Maybe she had let this go on for too long.

Maybe Chase had already made his choice—she just wasn't the one he had chosen.

Emilia had tried to ignore the whispers. The lingering stares. The way people hesitated before speaking to her, as if they knew something she didn't. But the tabloids had made it impossible to pretend.

Blackwood Heir and First Love Reunited?

Spotted: Chase Blackwood and Hallie Rogers – Just Friends or Something More?

Late-Night Visits, Private Dinners – Is the Wedding Off?

Picture after picture flooded the internet. Chase and Hallie at restaurants. Chase opening the car door for her. Chase standing just a little too close to her outside a hotel.

Emilia had forced herself not to care. She buried herself in work, convinced herself they were just rumors. But then Roxanne had called. ""Em,"" Roxanne's voice was cautious, like she was handling fragile glass. ""Are you okay?"" Emilia had gripped the phone tightly, swallowing past the lump in her throat. ""Yeah, I'm fine. Just tired.""

A pause.

""Em...""

""I said I'm fine, Roxy."" Her voice was steady. Too steady. ""I'll call you later."" She hung up before her best friend could press further.

But she wasn't fine. Not even close.

Walking through Nexus Care's halls, Emilia kept her head down until she overheard a group of women chatting excitedly near the waiting area. She recognized them instantly—Hallie's friends.

""God, it was so romantic,"" one of them gushed. ""Hallie was totally surprised!""

""I mean, after everything they've been through? It's like a full-circle moment.""

""She deserves it,"" another friend added. ""And that ring? I mean, have you seen it? Literal perfection.""

Emilia felt her pulse pound in her ears.

What ring?

Curiosity clawed at her insides as she pulled out her phone with trembling fingers. Her heart hammered as she searched Hallie's Instagram. There it was. A fresh post. A perfectly manicured hand. A diamond ring—her ring. The one she and Chase had picked out together three months ago. The one that was supposed to be on her finger. Her vision blurred. The world tilted. Before she knew it, she was sprinting down the hallway, shoving past people, her heels clicking furiously against the tile. She barely made it to the ladies' room before stumbling into a stall and locking the door. Then, she broke. A ragged sob tore through her chest as she pressed her forehead against her knees, her body trembling. Hot, silent tears spilled down her cheeks as she struggled to breathe.

He gave her our ring.

He gave Hallie our future.

Emilia clamped a hand over her mouth, stifling the sobs, but it didn't stop the pain from ripping through her like a blade. She sat hunched in the bathroom stall, her body trembling as silent sobs wracked through her. The betrayal burned—hot, suffocating, inescapable.

He gave her our ring.

The thought kept stabbing at her, deeper and deeper, until it felt like she couldn't breathe. She wiped furiously at her tears, trying to piece herself back together, but her hands wouldn't stop shaking. A sharp gasp tore from her throat as she pulled out her phone and took a screenshot of the tabloid article—the images of Chase and Hallie glowing on her screen like a cruel joke.

With a deep, ragged breath, she typed out a message and hit send.

Emilia: Tell me this is fake.

Seconds passed. Then minutes.

No response.

Her chest tightened as she forced herself to stand. She wasn't going to fall apart in a bathroom stall. Not here. Not over him. She splashed cold water on her face, took a deep breath, and straightened her shoulders. Her reflection in the mirror looked calm, but her eyes—God, her eyes. They were dark with fury, with heartbreak, with the kind of pain that settled deep in the bones and never really left. She turned, walked out, and headed straight for the one place she knew she'd find him.

The moment Emilia stepped into Hallie's hospital room; the air turned thick with tension. Chase stood near the bed, arms crossed, his jaw clenched. Hallie was lying back, looking frail, a blanket draped over her legs. Her lips parted slightly when she saw Emilia, and she sat up just a little, feigning concern.

""Em,"" Chase sighed, already exasperated. ""Not here.""

Emilia held up her phone, shaking with rage. ""You have nothing to say?"" she demanded, voice sharp, barely above a whisper. Chase ran a hand down his face, looking more annoyed than guilty. ""It's not what it looks like."" Emilia let out a bitter laugh. ""Oh, really? Because it looks like you proposed to another woman with my ring while I was at home—alone—planning our wedding!""

Hallie gasped softly, placing a hand over her chest like she was shocked by the accusation. But her eyes glimmered—just for a second—before she quickly looked down, playing the part of the wounded woman.

""Em, lower your voice,"" Chase muttered.

""Lower my—? Are you serious?"" Emilia seethed, her heart slamming against her ribs. ""Do you even hear yourself?"" Chase exhaled sharply, stepping toward her, his expression cold. ""Hallie's been going through a lot, okay? Her ex—"" he hesitated before finishing, ""—he left her. And she's pregnant."" Emilia blinked. ""And that's your problem why?""

""Because she has no one,"" he snapped. ""You don't get it, Em. She needed someone, and I wasn't just going to turn my back on her."" Emilia felt the ground tilt beneath her. ""So you're pretending to be engaged?"" Her voice cracked. ""You're seriously doing all this to play hero?"" Chase's jaw tightened. ""It's complicated.""

""No, it's not,"" she shot back. ""You made a choice. And it wasn't me."" Silence stretched between them, thick with everything left unsaid. Then Emilia laughed—a hollow, bitter sound. She reached for her hand, slipping off the engagement ring—the very one that was supposed to symbolize their forever—and held it up between them. ""Tell me,"" she whispered, eyes burning. ""If this was just an act, then why did you give her my ring?""

Chase said nothing.

His silence was deafening.

Emilia's fingers tightened around the ring before she threw it at his chest. ""I hope she was worth it."" She turned to leave, her heart shattering with every step. Behind her, Hallie let out a soft, pitying sigh. ""Oh, Em,"" she murmured. ""I'm so sorry you had to find out this way."" Emilia froze for a split second, knowing well Hallie wasn't sorry at all. And when she turned slightly, she caught it—the smirk.

Small. Quick. But there.

Hallie had won.

And Chase?

He had let her.

\-

The way her voice sounded so smug yet fake made Emilia want to slap the smirk off Hallie's face, but she was at her place of work. She needed to be professional. The moment the words left Hallie's mouth, Emilia's stomach twisted violently, and her vision blurred with unshed tears. Immediately, she grabbed her phone from her coat pocket, her fingers trembling as she typed out a few texts-saying she was sick, giving her assistant the go-ahead to cancel all her appointments or reassign them. Almost instantly, a flood of get-well messages lit up her screen, but none of them could pierce the numbing agony consuming her.

She walked out of the hospital, head low, her face glistening with tears as she rushed home to the penthouse she shared with Chase. The moment she stepped inside, the weight of the truth collapsed on her shoulders, and she crumpled against the door, sobbing into her trembling hands. All those 'I love yous,' all those 'I'm working late' excuses-lies. Every single one of them. He had been sleeping with an actress who never truly cared about him, while she had been home, loving him, trusting him.

Her mind spiraled back to when she first met Hallie-at a college function, Chase introducing her as his girlfriend for the first time. Hallie had barely acknowledged her, had looked at her as if she were insignificant. And now? Now Chase had chosen her. Emilia looked down at her ringless finger. How could she have been so blind? Shame and fury warred within her as she stood, tearing off her jacket and tossing it onto a kitchen chair.

A loud knock shattered the silence.

""Em! Em! Are you home?"" Chase's voice rang through the apartment, followed by the sound of keys jingling. A moment later, the front door unlocked. She stiffened. What was he doing here?Her body moved on instinct, retreating into their bedroom as she furiously wiped away her tears.

""Emilia!"" His voice boomed, a force like an earthquake splitting her world apart. She turned as he entered the room, his face a mix of frustration and something unreadable. ""It's not what you think,"" Chase started, his tone almost exasperated, as if her heartbreak was an inconvenience. ""Hallie-she needs help. That's all this is."" Emilia let out a humorless laugh, shaking her head. ""Help? You were helping her while you were supposed to be with me?"" He ran a hand through his hair, clearly agitated. ""She doesn't have anyone else, Em! All she has is me. I couldn't just abandon her.""

""Bullsh-it,"" Emilia spat, her voice rising. ""You've been lying to me! Sneaking around with her while I waited for you like an idiot! I loved you, Chase! And you-""

""Loved?"" he cut her off, his lips curling into a smirk that sent ice through her veins. ""Don't be so dramatic, Emilia.""

Tears burned down her cheeks as her hands clenched into fists. ""Dramatic? You cheated on me! You threw away everything we built for-for some washed-up actress who needed a man to fix her problems?""

""She needed me,"" he corrected coldly. ""And maybe if you weren't so obsessed with your job, you would've noticed that I needed something, too."" Her breath caught in her throat. The cruelty in his words struck deep, the final nail in the coffin of whatever love she thought they had. How could he say such a thing? Em had worked hard to provide a good life for her and him. She also always made time for him, how can he say such things? ""I can't believe I ever loved you,"" she whispered, voice shaking. Chase sighed, shaking his head. ""You're overreacting, Em. We can still get married. Be a good girl, let me handle this, and once Hallie has the baby, things will go back to normal."" Emilia stared at him, her body trembling with rage. ""Are you serious right now?""

""Of course, I am,"" he scoffed. ""You and I-we're supposed to be together. You know that."" For a moment, she couldn't move, couldn't breathe. Then, her fingers reached for the engagement ring he had placed back on her finger just moments ago during their fight. With one final, sharp inhale, she ripped it off and hurled it at him. ""It's over!"" she screamed, her voice raw with heartbreak. The ring clattered against the floor, the sound echoing like the shattering of her heart. Chase's expression darkened. ""You're crazy,"" he sneered.

Before she could respond, his phone rang. He glanced at the screen, and a smug smile curled his lips. ""It's Hallie,"" he announced as if to twist the knife deeper. ""The press is on her again-she's having a panic attack."" Fake. Emilia knew it was fake. Knew Hallie was playing him like a puppet. And still, Chase turned his back on her, answering the call as he strode toward the door.

""Yeah, baby, I'm coming. I know, I know. I won't let anything happen to you,"" he cooed into the phone. Then, in front of Emilia, he called the press and said, ""You've got the news wrong. My ex and I broke up a while ago. Hallie and I have been together for months now. I'm the father of her baby, she loves me, and I love her. Those lies you're printing about her and that director are not true. So please publish correctly.""

Emilia's stomach dropped. The earth tilted beneath her feet, and before she could process the betrayal slicing through her, everything went dark.

The last thing she saw was the flicker of regret in Chase's eyes before she hit the floor.

\-

When Emilia woke, the world was a blur. The familiar scent of their sheets wrapped around her, her mind struggling to catch up. She was in their bed.

A note rested on the pillow beside her.

With shaky hands, she picked it up and unfolded it.

Em, you need to stop being ridiculous. You're the love of my life. We're still getting married after Hallie gives birth. I just need to help her keep her image intact. I know you'll understand.

Her blood turned to ice as she read his final words.

I know you'll understand.

Quickly crumpling up the paper, Emilia hurled it across the room before ripping the covers off her. Reaching for her phone, she blinked at the flood of messages lighting up her screen-dozens of texts asking if she was okay, calling Chase a jerk, or demanding to know what was going on. Without hesitation, she blocked every single number from people she knew were team Chase.

To her real friends, she sent a simple text:

""He's been cheating... I don't know for how long, but it's over. Hallie can have him. After all, she's all he's ever wanted.""

Tears welled in her eyes as she allowed herself to see the cracks that had always been in their relationship-the secrets she'd brushed aside, the excuses she'd swallowed, the gut feelings she'd ignored. Oh, how it hurt. But she was done hurting for a man who never truly loved her. Taking a deep breath, she focused on the steady stream of supportive texts filling her phone, warming her chest. She smiled-a real, small, but genuine smile. It felt as if, for the first time in weeks, the heavy storm clouds were beginning to part.

Lost in thought, her phone buzzed again. This time, it was a message from her Aunt Rose:

I miss you, sweetie. How are you? When are you planning on visiting? Also... I found you a handsome gentleman who I think is just perfect for you.

A laugh bubbled from Emilia's lips. Leave it to Aunt Rose to try and set her up when her life was in shambles. But maybe... just maybe, she was onto something. If Chase could move on without a second thought, why couldn't she? As if summoned by her thoughts, her aunt's name flashed across the screen. Emilia chuckled, wiping away the last of her tears before answering.

""Hi, Aunt Rose.""

""Emilia, darling! It's been too long! How are you? I saw something about-""

""Had a beautiful moment with a family at work today,"" Emilia interrupted quickly, forcing a lightness into her voice. ""I'm fine."" Aunt Rose hummed, unconvinced but choosing to let it slide. ""That's wonderful, dear. Nothing more rewarding than bringing a life into the world. Now, I wanted to ask-""

""Auntie..."" Emilia bit her lip, hesitating. ""Do you remember that perfect guy you wanted me to meet?"" There was a pause before Aunt Rose practically squealed. ""Why yes, I do! And may I add, the man is still single! Why? Are you finally interested?"" Emilia chuckled softly, heat rushing to her cheeks. ""Would it be okay if you gave him my contact? Or maybe... his to me?"" Aunt Rose gasped dramatically. ""Well, it's about time, Emilia! I'm going to assume you finally tossed out that useless boy, right?"" Emilia let out a laugh, shaking her head. ""Yeah, we ended a while ago... I just... I think I'm ready to turn a new leaf, you know?""

""About da-mn time."" Aunt Rose sniffed. ""I never liked him, always knew he was using you. But never mind that-let's talk about Henry!""

Henry. His name was Henry. Three years older than Emilia, stable job, kind-hearted. The more Aunt Rose spoke, the more Emilia found herself intrigued. As they continued chatting, Emilia quickly texted her friends, asking if they knew a place she could crash while she figured things out. Within seconds, Travis responded: I have a penthouse three miles from you. Stay as long as you need. She sent him a grateful emoji, jotting down the address and entry code. By the time she hung up with Aunt Rose, her heart felt lighter. Change was terrifying, but for the first time in a long time, it also felt... exciting. Determined, Emilia grabbed her suitcase and began packing. She refused to leave a single trace of herself in this penthouse. Chase had taken enough from her-her love, her trust, her time.

He wouldn't get another second. As she zipped up her suitcase, her phone buzzed again. One new message...",1,1755591177.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

1muce1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBigPicture/comments/1muce1p/fun_heat_1995_thought_experiment/,Fun Heat (1995) thought experiment,"Like everyone at the Ringer, Heat is my favorite movie of all time. I’m also a huge fan of John Cassavetes, both as an actor and director, and one of my favorite movies he starred in is Mikey and Nicky with Peter Falk. I started thinking about a version of Heat that stars Cassavetes as Neil and Falk as Hanna, and became obsessed with creating this imaginary, alternate universe version of Heat. 

I decided it would have to be in 1975 for them to line up with De Niro and Pacino age wise, and since Cassavetes would never direct something this large, I mentally recruited Don Siegel (friend of Cassavetes who previously directed him in The Killers). I have a whole cast list for this imaginary version. 

Then it got me thinking; what if other prominent directors took on Heat, who would be their McCauley and Hanna? I have some suggestions below, but I wanted to put this experiment to this sub as I thought others might have fun with it as well.

It’s also worth noting that while the easiest solution is usually to pick from the directors’ “guys”, the casting doesn’t necessarily have to include actors the director has worked with, but could maybe be prominent actors at the time the director would have plausibly made the film. After all, neither De Niro nor Pacino had worked with Mann before Heat.

Here’s what I got so far:

Steven Spielberg:

Tom Hanks steps into the role of Neil McCauley to face off against Harrison Ford’s Vincent Hanna. This version is far more concerned with the way crime disrupts the family unit; Ford’s Hanna is just as driven but far more racked with guilt about the toll his work takes on his relationship with his wife and kids. HIs daughter’s (actual daughter, not step, and actually, he probably has a couple kids in Spielberg’s version) attempted suicide leads to a moment of mutual understanding and reconciliation with his wife, where before departing to catch McCauley, Hanna and his wife conclude they can be together and make it work.

Unlike De Niro’s McCauley, Hanks’s version is actually friendly and personable. His everyman charm is skeleton key to get into rooms he’s not supposed to be in and to get information he’s not supposed to have. Yet, Hanks’s McCauley is constantly reminded of what he’s missing by keeping to his creed of being willing to drop anything if he feels the heat coming around the corner. This McCauley is alone, and lonely. He doesn’t get upset when the woman at the restaurant asks him what he’s reading, he instead sees immediately an answer to the terrible longing growing in his heart.

Timing wise this for this to fit, Spielberg would probably have to make it in the early 2000s. There’s also a bit of an age gap between Ford and Hanks, and I generally think Hanna and McCauley should be closer in age to each other, but I think in the early 2000s it wouldn’t feel like as huge a gap. 

You could maybe convince me the right move is for Hanks to be Hanna (you can practically here him shouting “I had coffee with McCauley HALF AN HOUR AGO!”) and Ford as McCauley (his natural cool being well suited for Neil) but something about this configuration works better in my mind.

Brian DePalma:

DePalma’s sicko Heat is obviously far more perverted, and one of the leads almost certainly gets a peak at another mid-coitus through a pair of binoculars during a stake out (“Is this guy something, or is he something?”) 

I’m placing this one around the same time as the original came out, so mid 90s or so. For the leads I have DePalma reuniting with John Travolta, hot off of Pulp Fiction, playing McCauley, and for Hanna, I have Michael Douglas, who I think would inject the sleaziness into the role that DePalma would demand. DePalma never worked with M.D., but he did work with his father Kirk Douglas on The Fury, so there’s a little continuity there. Sean Penn could probably slide in here as Chris as well, ratcheting up the aggression and exasperation Chris feels while in the throws of his gambling addiction.

David Lynch:

I’d imagine Lynch would be the director least interested in taking on this kind of film, but maybe he’d find something worthwhile in digging into the yin and yang of McCauley and Hanna. I could see him finding something in Eady’s misguided attraction to Neil, and her inadvisable choice to flee with a criminal instead of continue her regular life as a graphic designer. Waingro would be a much bigger presence for sure.

You know we have to have Kyle MacLachlan in there, and I’m choosing to make him McCauley. Going opposite him is David Duchovny as Hanna. I know MacLachlan’s natural energy as a performer is better suited for the antic law man rather than the cool criminal, but I think he can play restrained rather well and this way he’s not just playing a more edgy Dale Cooper. But to be honest, I could be talked into having them switch roles.

Rounding out the rest of the cast is Laura Dern as Eady, Naomi Watts as Justine, Justin Theroux as Chris and Sherilyn Fenn as Charlene. I’m putting this in the early 2000s, right after Mulholland Drive.

Quentin Tarantino

This one’s tough because you know Tarantino would have a very specific thought process about this. He’s talked a lot about the potential pairings he had for OUATIH, and he was definitely getting at a similar idea to the De Niro/Pacino pairing in Heat. 

I’m gonna recycle one of his potential OUATIH pairs for this one and say Tarantino makes this in the early 2010s, and a resurgent Robert Downey Jr plays Hanna opposite Tom Cruise as McCauley, who was in a bit of a slump and could use a home run at this time.

I could also see him doing this in the late 90s or early 2000s with an older, gruffer pairing like Kurt Russell (McCauley) vs Harvey Keitel (Hanna). 

David Fincher:

Ben Affleck (McCauley) vs Brad Pitt (Hanna). I’m not confident in this one at all but Affleck vs Pitt is a pairing we’ve never seen that would make some noise and Fincher has a history with both.

Wes Anderson:

Noted Heat fan Wes Anderson makes his version in the early 2010s. Adrien Brody as McCauley sits in the booth of perfectly symmetrical diner across Edward Norton as Hanna.


Robert Altman:

Some time in the late 70s Elliot Gould’s laconic McCauley stares down Donald Sutherland’s affable Hanna with Kieth Carradine as Chris and Shelly Duvall as Eady.

Spike Lee:

Late 90s, Denzel Washington (McCauley) vs Samuel L Jackson (Hanna) with Anthony Mackie as Chris.

Nicolas Winding Refn

Mid 2010s, Ryan Gosling (McCauley) vs Mads Mikkelson (Hanna). Jena Malone is in there somewhere. Maybe as Eady? 

Clint Eastwood:

Mid-80s, Clint Eastwood (McCauley) vs Gene Hackman (Hanna). 

Richard Linklater:

Ethan Hawke (McCauley) vs Matthew McConaughey (Hanna) with Glenn Powell as Chris.

Christopher Nolan

Nolan has literally made his version with The Dark Knight but if we’re starting fresh I’d put Cillian Murphy as McCauley and Tom Hardy as Hanna. 

Howard Hawks:

Robert Mitchum (McCauley) vs Humphrey Bogart (Hanna)

Akira Kurosawa:

Toshiro Mifune (McCauley) vs Tatsuya Nakadai (Hanna)

Some notable absences from this list are Martin Scorsese, Matt Damon, and Leonardo DiCaprio, because they basically did this with The Departed.

👉 Cela peut-il venir d’un problème de firmware, d’un autre capteur ou d’un souci de calibration caché ?

Merci d’avance pour vos retours et vos expériences 🙏

Title: Rocket R Nine One – Error after replacing motherboard and pressure transducer

Post:
Hi everyone,

I own a Rocket R Nine One (code 01R9122C03). I’ve been struggling with a recurring error and I’m looking for advice from anyone who has experienced something similar.

When I start a coffee extraction, the machine suddenly displays the following error on the screen:

XPV35 Rocket R91V FW ver. 01.14  
Controller board FW ver. 1.11

Here’s what I’ve already done:

Replaced the main control board (motherboard)

Replaced the pressure transducer (pressostat)

Cleaned the probes and checked basic maintenance points


Despite all of this, the same issue still occurs. Before the motherboard was replaced, the machine would show the error immediately and no operation was possible. Now it works up until I launch a shot, but then the error appears again.

I will attach a video to show exactly what happens.

👉 Has anyone here had the same error with the R Nine One?
👉 Could this be related to firmware, sensors, or another hidden calibration issue?

Any help or shared experience would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance 🙏

1mucci2,https://www.reddit.com/r/spiders/comments/1mucci2/spider_relocation_question/,Spider Relocation Question,"Hi everyone. I’m a flight attendant in the air right now and just found a small spider (about the size of a dime) walking on the floor of the plane. I don’t know what kind of spider it is or whether it’s a small adult or a baby, but I didn’t want to leave it on the plane to inevitably get smashed when someone else saw it. I managed to catch it inside a paper coffee cup with a lid and I poked a bunch of tiny holes in the cup to make sure it can breathe.

Question for the spider experts out there: where should I release it to give it the best chance of survival? I’m flying from Los Angeles to Boston. My guess is that it got on board in LA or someone else would’ve probably killed it already. Would it survive if I released it outside in Boston? I’m flying back to LA tomorrow so I can also keep it with me and release it back in LA. Or if it’s an indoor spider, would it die if I release it outside?

1mucbw7,https://www.reddit.com/r/bestdentistinKolkata/comments/1mucbw7/which_teeth_whitening_treatment_works_best_expert/,Which Teeth Whitening Treatment Works Best? Expert Insights,"A bright, white smile can boost confidence and make a lasting impression. But with so many [teeth whitening options](https://drsofiahawelia.in/teeth-whitening-treatment/) available—both at home and in dental clinics—how do you know which one truly works best? In this guide, we share expert insights from **Dr. Sofia Hawelia**, the best dentist in Kolkata, to help you choose the safest and most effective teeth whitening treatment for your needs.

# Understanding Teeth Whitening

# What is Teeth Whitening?

Teeth whitening is a cosmetic dental procedure that removes stains and discoloration from the teeth, making them several shades lighter. It can be done professionally in a dental clinic or through at-home treatments.

# Why Do Teeth Get Discolored?

* **Food & Drinks:** Coffee, tea, wine, and dark berries can stain teeth.
* **Smoking:** Nicotine and tar leave stubborn yellow stains.
* **Aging:** Enamel thins over time, exposing yellow dentin.
* **Poor Oral Hygiene:** Plaque and tartar build-up can dull teeth.

# Top whitening methods: comparison and expert insights

# 1. In-office professional whitening 

**What it is:** High-concentration peroxide gel applied by a dentist, often with an activating light or laser.**Pros:** Fast — multiple shades in one visit; controlled by a clinician; excellent for deep stains.**Cons:** Higher cost; transient sensitivity possible.**Best for:** Events, heavy staining, or patients who want immediate, reliable results.**Expert tip (Dr. Sofia):** We combine desensitizing gels and post-op fluoride varnish to minimize discomfort while maximizing shade improvement.

# 2. Dentist-prescribed take-home kits

**What it is:** Custom trays fitted by your dentist plus professional-grade whitening gel to use daily for 1–2 weeks.**Pros:** Balanced between cost and effectiveness; gentler on enamel; good control over shade.**Cons:** Results take longer than in-office but are often more even.**Best for:** Patients with mild–moderate stains or those prone to sensitivity.

# 3. Over-the-counter (OTC) strips & whitening toothpaste

**What it is:** Ready-to-use strips, gels, or whitening toothpastes available at pharmacies.**Pros:** Affordable and convenient.**Cons:** Lower peroxide concentration → slower or limited results; uneven whitening; not ideal for restorations.**Best for:** Maintenance after professional treatment, or mild surface stains.

# 4. Natural or DIY options (activated charcoal, lemon, baking soda)

**What it is:** Home remedies like activated charcoal, lemon, and baking soda you can use.**Pros:** Cheap and accessible.**Cons:** Often abrasive or acidic — can damage enamel and increase sensitivity.**Expert warning:** Dr. Sofia strongly advises against harsh DIY methods; enamel loss is irreversible and undermines long-term whiteness.

# Who should avoid whitening or take precautions?

* People with active tooth decay, gum disease, or exposed roots should treat those issues first.
* Pregnant or breastfeeding patients are usually advised to postpone whitening until after pregnancy.
* Teeth with large restorations (crowns, veneers) may not whiten uniformly — restorations may need replacement to match the new shade.

Dr. Sofia performs a full oral exam before recommending any [teeth whitening plan](https://drsofiahawelia.in/teeth-whitening/) to ensure safety and best outcomes.

# How to reduce sensitivity and maintain results

* Use a toothpaste for sensitivity starting two weeks before treatment.
* Follow dentist's instructions on wear time for trays and strips.
* Avoid staining foods/drinks (coffee, red wine, turmeric) for 48 hours after whitening; use a straw for dark beverages.
* Schedule touch-up maintenance: short at-home applications every 6–12 months or as advised.

# Cost & value: what to expect in Kolkata

Professional in-office whitening typically costs more than OTC options but delivers faster, more reliable outcomes. Take-home kits prescribed by a dentist offer a middle ground — better results than OTC at a moderate price. For transparent pricing and a customized plan, consult a qualified local dentist.

# Why choose Dr. Sofia Hawelia for teeth whitening in Kolkata?

Dr. Sofia Hawelia at Brace Up Dentistry combines up-to-date whitening technology with a gentle, patient-centered approach. Her clinic in Sector 1, Bidhannagar, Kolkata, focuses on tailored treatment plans that consider sensitivity, existing dental work, and long-term oral health — which is why many patients regard her as the [**best dentist in Kolkata**](https://drsofiahawelia.in/) for cosmetic and restorative care.

# Conclusion

The best teeth whitening treatment depends on your needs: **in-office whitening** for fast, dramatic results; **dentist-supervised take-home kits** for gentle, customizable outcomes; and **OTC products** for budget maintenance. Avoid abrasive DIY remedies and always get a dental examination before bleaching. For a safe, effective, and personalized whitening plan in Kolkata, book a consultation with **Dr. Sofia Hawelia at Brace Up Dentistry** — where expert care meets beautiful results.

Ready to brighten your smile? Schedule a consultation with Dr. Sofia Hawelia to find the whitening option that’s right for you.

1mucatf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1mucatf/help/,Help!!,"Hi everyone, I need some perspective on this.

For context, I’m 17 (F) and my boyfriend is older (I know what people are going to think, but still I want to be honest). We’ve been in a long-distance relationship for almost 2 years now, and we’ve never met in person. But we’re extremely comfortable with each other—he’s the only person I trust completely. I don’t really have close friends; I do talk to people around me, but I’ve always been unlucky when it comes to friendships and relationships. He’s the only truly close person in my life.

Now about the incident: I joined a new study center just 3 days back, and this happened on my 2nd day there. This was actually the first time I ever talked to a guy face-to-face.

I had a small chat with this guy, and then he asked me if I drink tea. I giggled and asked him why, and he said, “Wanna go for a cup of tea?” I said yes, but I felt it would be awkward with just the two of us since we’re strangers, and on top of that he’s a guy. So I asked the girl sitting next to me to join us, and she agreed.

We first planned to go to a tea shop, but when we reached there, he didn’t go inside. Then we decided to go for coffee instead. I suggested a café near the study center, but the girl said their cold coffee isn’t good, so we went a little farther (not too far). We had cold coffee there and then came back to the study center.

The whole time, I maintained proper distance from both of them. Before going, I even tried to call my boyfriend multiple times to inform him, but he didn’t pick up my calls.

Now the issue is: my boyfriend is really upset and keeps saying, “How could you go out with a stranger?” I’ve told him that I accept my mistake. I should have known the person better before going out with him, but it’s done now. I’ve promised my boyfriend that from next time, I’ll be more careful. Still, he’s stuck on it. He even told me to post this here to see what people think.

1muc8mk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1muc8mk/aging_parent/,Aging Parent,"One of my folks we figure is in the early stages of dementia. It’s been a tough battle. They spent a week in the hospital this month to due to a A Fib episode, but while in between the hospital and us finding out they had been cancelling appts and tests because they simply didn’t want to leave the house, or the other excuse was “they can’t do anything for me”. 

So while they were in, the doctors decided to catch them up on everything they had been neglecting. They did find a few things that will require more tests. 

But anyway when released due to cognitive impairment, they were told not to even think about cooking for yourself or boil water, carry anything etc. 

They were fine for a day or two before they now decide to wake up at 6am so they can eat the garbage they usually eat for breakfast making it themselves so they could eat what they wanted. 

(Slice of toast with a 1/4” slab of butter melted on top with a tablespoon of sugar dumped on too and another tbsp of cinnamon) then have this awful instant coffee, cocoa and other junk added, with a full glass of grape juice and their NoGurt

If we feed them it’s basic toast and an egg and a protein shake. 

When asked why they keep defying our request and the doctors orders, their reply is always I’m hungry, or I dunno. 

It’s been getting worse and worse. They hardly ever come out of their den, has found a way not to make any decisions if asked what they want. They simply decide to argue to sway the topic and us just walk away. 

They were sent to a therapist, who they just lied to, said they were doing what they wanted but nope. They also spend 95% of their day either reading, or playing games on computer or table. Either way it’s an electronic device in their face all day, even when they eat. To avoid conversation. 

I’ve had to pretty much take over all cooking and shopping duties. I finally had to say enough, I need at least one night I can do whatever. And I do and sometimes 2 nights but parent 2 isn’t real kitchen able so they just grab and go. 

In the last week I’ve just not hardly said a word to them. I acknowledge them but don’t want to even start a conversation as they just mix it up and jumble it up and try arguing about it. 

Just the lies and deception.  Cant trust anything they say is true. Some stuff is so left field it blindsides me. Parent 2 is totally burned out on it as well. They just can’t understand it. There are times parent 1 has used it to their advantage to get out of doing something. (We had to hire a house keeper, house was getting to be an absolute mess of dust and filth.)

I’m burned out mentally and physically from it. No place will take them currently, so we are on our own till we can prove otherwise. You cannot talk to them anymore. What’s said today is gone by tomorrow. 

But what really burned me before this got really bad was I was in need of some important information, they had.  In order for me to finish a training event and get a certification I’ve been wanting. Gave them plenty of time, months. As the due date drew near I’d ask about it to get it’s almost done. Due date,  nothing and only a shrug why it’s not done. I was the only one that didn’t get Certified, it hit me hard. But I came home from the class to see it on the table. Horribly rushed and missing just about everything needed. With a was that what you needed? Too late, I didn’t get it. No apologies nothing, they actually pitched a fit, that I wasted hours of their time. Still has yet to apologize totally. 

This has now happened a few more times. If it’s something myself or another family member needs its procrastination city. And asking about it only makes it worse. 

It’s anxiety and depression driven but the more we try and help the more of a turtle they become.  They have even. Had doctors drop them because of this. 

So I ask this. How do you help someone, that A doesn’t want it, wants just to be left alone to die.
B lies to get out of just about anything , and C refuses to do what the doctors want because they “can’t” help them. 

And what bugs me the most is the act they put on when my sibling and their kids are here. 

I’m stuck here taking care of them, and knowing if I leave. Parent 2 would not be able to handle it on their own.

Fresh I.T Grad here and after ng graduation ko nag start nako mag job hunt. Today is my 2 Months of pagiging Unemployed or pag jo job hunt.Struggle mag apply talaga ngayon lalo na madami din fresh grad na kasabayan at iba pang mga senior. 

Nakaka land naman ako ng mga Interviews pero wala pa din and now nasa 130+ job applications nako yung iba dito shotgun lang ginawa ko (Mema apply lang ) pero now tinailor ko na yung pag apply ko. Pinaka masaklap pa is yung ung Rejection letter ko is sa mismong Birthday ko pa natanggap haha. Sobrang nalungkot ako that time haha.

 The next week, May Family Gathering kami to celebrate yung mga nag birthday ng july. I have this cousin na ComSci from Private School  na nag graduate nung April. So habang kumakain na kami ayon kwentuhan with Tito's and Tita's syempre kamustahan saming mag pipinsan then ayon siya naka land na siya ng work as a Soft Dev with the help of my tito. Happy ako para sakanya kasi deserve niya naman. Pero na pressure ako that time kasi napunta sakin ang attention kinamusta ako then sabi ko wala pa and puro interview palang sabi ko. Then I have this tita na nagbiro na sabi niya sakin na Gayahin ko daw yung babaeng lumabas sa imburnal at nabigyan ng worth 80k , edi tinawanan ko nalang siya. Hindi naman ako na offend pero medyo na feel ko lang na nahiya ako at parang gusto ko magpalamon sa lupa. So ako ayon dinaan ko nalang sa pagkain yung tipong hindi nako makakain ng maayos kasi kinakausap ako at na pe pressure nako sakanila.

After ng celebration, Lumipat kami sa SB para mag coffee and natuloy yung topic about sa pag apply ng work ko then I have this tito na lumapit sakin na huwag daw ako pakampante ( Sa isip ko ano yung sinasabi niya Pakampate eh naghahanap naman ako ng work ) akala niya hindi ako nag apply and chill lang ako. At huwag daw ako hiya-hiya sa tito ko na magpatulong maka land ng trabaho thou may point na naman siya pero ako kasi yung tipo ng tao na ayoko umasa sa iba at ayaw ko magkaroon ng utang na loob. Kasi kaya ko naman mag apply.

Pauwi na kami at eto ako tulala kakaisip sa mga nangyari nung oras na yon. Parang nahihiya nalang akong harapin sila.  I know ginagawa ko naman yung best ko na makahanap ng work pero sadyang mahirap talaga at kakayanin. Pero hindi ko parin maiwasan isipin yung mga sinasabi nila sakin. Bumaba tingin ko sa sarili ko at nahiya ako mismo sa sarili ko. Sa family namin ako yung tahimik at simple lang. Sila may mga magagandang gadgets sila at ako Android lang. Madali nilang makuha gusto nila dahil mayayaman parents nila at ako tamang sideline lang bago ko mabili at itreat ang sarili ko. 
 
Kaya mas sinisikapan ko makahanap ng work para makabawi din ako sa tinulong nila sa parents ko at sa pag aaral ko.

1muc73i,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyStoryDump/comments/1muc73i/the_soulless_architect_part_2/,The Soulless Architect Part 2,"Back at my apartment, I was heading up the stairs when i ran into Greg, my neighbor. he was a middle-aged, average build, a guy who lived off his Veteran's welfare checks, and rarely said much unless he had to. His wild grey hair stuck out in combed tufts, and sharp restless eyes always gave the impression he was holding onto secrets he'd never say aloud. Still, we got along well enough.

“How are you now?” he asked with a nod.

“Living the dream,” I said dryly. “One nightmare at a time.”

He chuckled.

“If we could all be so lucky. Anyway, heads up, the landlord’s coming around tomorrow. Routine inspection of the units.”

""thanks for the heads-ups' I said, shifting the keys in my hand.

""all good"" Greg replied, he was already down the next flight of stairs. he paused, looked back at me with a strange look in his eyes."" make sure place is.. is in order""

I furrowed my brow.

""its just a routine check, isn't it?""

he didn't answer right away. His gaze flicked down the hallway, as if he was checking to see if we were alone.

""Yeah... but you know what he's like"" then disappeared around the corner.

The awkward conversation lingered in my mind as I unlocked my apartment door. I flicked on the light, everything was just as I’d left it. The unwashed dishes on the counter. The half-read book on the coffee table, and the usual quiet that hung in the air.

I tossed my keys down and made my way to the fridge. Grabbed a drink. Sank into one of the armchairs in the living room.

My eyes drifted to the side table, where I picked up an old picture frame, its edges worn smooth with time. It was a photo of my family, my wife and son. It’s been almost three years since the crash. A T-bone collision that stole them away. I lost more than them that day… I lost a part of myself.

I rubbed my temple. Maybe therapy was right. All that grief, all that stress, tangled up in my head like a knot I couldn’t undo. Messing with everything.

I sighed and started to put the photo down,

But before I could, my phone buzzed..

it was a message, from and unknown number.

""The Architect is watching""

I blinked, then it was gone 

had I actually seen it? Or was the stress form today session catching up with me.

I rubbed my eyes. maybe I just needed to sleep.

Sleep came a little easier than expected, 

and so did the dream.

just like always, i was back in the surreal chamber, The formless space streched around me suspended it the nothingness. the thirteen chairs, looming in the far right corner, their formation sharp and deliberate.

and then I felt it, behind me. I turned already know what to expect. the creature towering over me, yet something seemed off this time.

I wasn't afraid, it presence felt changed, softer, almost familiar. I didn't feel threatened, if anything I felt safe.

it stepped closer, now I could get a better look at it, it wasn't a creature at all it was a... women.

she stopped a few feet in-front of me, her form shimmering slightly, as if she was both here and not, then she spoke not the usual phrase. her voice more soft, and feminine, but edged with urgency. 

""The Architect is here, seek the man with the star on his neck before its too late my child"" 

I tried to speak, to ask what she meant.

but I woke, her words still lingering in my mind.

I look over to my clock 3:15 a.m. 

I sighed and got up to get a glass of water, and my medication id been on it for a year and a half now, but it never seemed to work the grief, pain and dreams were all still there.

As I walked pass the window something caught my attention

Three men stood on the street, staring directly at me. each held either a bat or a baton. a chill ran down my spine.

Then a knock at the door

""Hey John, it me Greg, can I talk to you real quick""

I looked back at out the window and the men were gone.

Cautiously, I open the door 

""what's u-"" before I could finish he grabbed me and pulled me into the hallway.

""What the fuck man? What are you doing?"" I snapped jerking my arm back.

Greg looked around  wildly, his voice low and urgent ""they're going to kill you if you stay, come with me now""

I stared at him, heart racing ""what the fuck is going on?, Whos going to kill me?""

He turned to me, pale as a ghost. ""your dreams aren't just dreams, John. They are far more than that. if you come with me now, I'll explain everything""

And that's when they appeared.

The Three men stepped into view at the far end of the hallway.

""we've been looking for you John""

His voice cold, then he shifted his gaze to Greg

""sorry about your brother, he fought well""

Greg stepped IN front of me, and that's when I saw it.

A star tattooed on his neck.

Now I'm showing you the stories of Sachiko, Riho, and Ono. I'll make an important clarification: it's about Ono's story, which you'll see is cut short. It's not 100% complete, but at least you can get an idea of what Ono's story is about. For those asking if Ono's story has a kiss, the answer is yes. Hayato is the one who ends up kissing her. All the girls' stories have a kiss, but it seems like the video is cut short, so it's not visible. However, at the end of the animation, you can see that they are both kissing.

Here's the video of Riho and Ono: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHE-FXFC8Bo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHE-FXFC8Bo)

A brief explanation of the machine regarding the game's animations. In the game, once you reach the girl's story animation, you must quickly press a large button for the animation to complete. If you are very slow, sometimes the golden heart that is seen on the screen can even break and not show the complete animation, or the final animation can change. This is the interesting thing about this style of new pachinko machines: they have different animation fragments depending on the player's response time. In addition, the game styles can be customized, as I mentioned in my article.

1muc5xn,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1muc5xn/my_mum_and_i_were_homeless_twice_now_my_kids_will/,My mum and I were homeless twice. Now my kids will never know that fear. Here’s what I learned.,"I had literally never met anyone with a job until I was in my late teens. 

I grew up in a rural home schooling community. Not particularly religious, but definitely ideologically extreme. 

My mum raised me, and my two brothers, alone after ditching my dadwhen I was 11. We were homeless twice while he stalked her. One time we had to live in a half renovated house with no running water. Another time in a women's refuge. 

Because I was home schooled, I had never been in a class room until I opted to sit my end of school exams - I had to teach myself the content. It was at an FE college (for Americans, these are exams you normally take at 16 and FE is like to community college - I think). 

Honestly, I was - for whatever reason - expecting 'college' to be like Hogwarts. Instead it was peeling wallpaper and distracted students. Most of my classmates had been kicked out of school. Some were brilliant. I even started a band with one of them.

Next came A-levels at another college that mostly trained mechanics and hairdressers. No shade, but I was the weird kid wanting to study sociology, philosophy, and literature. I had never met anyone who had gone to university, so I had to figure out what it was and how to get there. I once caught a 2am bus from our tiny town to visit a campus across the county, because there was no one to take me and I couldn't afford a train.

Fast forward: I studied political science and philosophy, worked myself crazy, scraped a First, won a student award. But then the world of work hit. Hard. 

It was 2012, deep in the recession. I spent six months applying for roles and getting rejected. Eventually I landed an internship at a tiny, sleazy firm. The guy interviewing me kept picking in his ear and smelling it. They paid £250 a week in London, when rent was £200. 

Two breakdowns later, I’d climbed into bigger jobs, made it to Account Director, and at 28 was elected to the local council - a part time political role. Imposter syndrome crashed back in. I remember messaging my politics lecturer like a proud kid. But I also realised I couldn’t make the scale of change I wanted at that level. 

Now I work in a safe corporate, my kids will never know the fear I did. 

I want to share what I've learned to help others.

What actually moved the needle wasn’t raw talent. It was a what I think of as an 'ascending mindset'. Ask early and ask specifically. No one was coming to hand me a map - the advice I got when I said I was going to uni was 'you'll get into too much debt'. Every step forward started with a direct ask: information, a meeting, a chance. 

Trade perfection for progress. I didn’t wait to feel ready. I took the 2am bus. I applied before I had the right language. Then I learned fast and adapted to new environments once I was in them. My first corporate job nearly broke my brain. 

Turn fear into prep. Hyper-vigilance can eat you alive. If you come from a dysfunctional background like me, note it. Point it at preparation and it becomes an edge. Make your case in their terms. Whether admissions, politics, or corporate, I moved further when I linked my goal to their priorities. 

If you grew up without a map, you can still build one. Start by asking for what you need in clear words. Then take the smallest next step you can’t take back. Send that application, ask for that coffee, message that potential mentor. 

TL;DR Grew up far outside the system. Got a good  degree, a political role and now a corporate role. The lesson is simple: don’t wait to be picked. You have to ask for what you want. You have to start small. If you had to build your own map, what’s one ask that changed your path?",7,1755590173.0,selfimprovement,0,0.89,False

Alexa Spilled My Husband's Dirty Secrets
👉 CONTINUE READING 👈
Chapter 1
The day after my husband left for his business trip, I was cleaning the house and casually said to the smart speaker, ""Alexa, play some music.""

But instead of the usual response, a strange, sultry female voice came through the speaker.

""Sure, my little luna. By the way, remind Ethan not to forget the birthday surprise for Jessica tonight~""

My whole body froze. The music suddenly sounded jarring. My husband's name is Ethan Miller—who is Jessica?

I immediately dialed his number. ""Did you tamper with the smart speaker?""

There was a brief silence on the other end, followed by his casual laugh. ""Oh, a friend came over a few days ago and might have connected their account. What's wrong?""

I forced a smile and said it was nothing, hanging up. Afterward, I pulled up the speaker's login history and immediately hailed a cab to the company registered to that unfamiliar account.

...

The taxi stopped in front of ""Stellar Design.""

I looked up. The glass curtain wall glinted under the sunlight, making my eyes dizzy—just like the company's aggressive rise in the industry over the past couple of years.

They were the primary competitors to our firm, ""DreamWorks Design.""

The receptionist was highly professional. She didn't show any disdain for me being the rival company's CEO; she merely made the internal call by the book.

A few minutes later, a girl in a white dress hurried out. Her long hair reached her waist, and her bare face appeared fresh and innocent.

Jessica Collins.

The moment she saw me, her expression flashed with panic, like a deer in headlights, but she quickly regained composure and forced a shy smile.

""Hello, may I help you?""

I went straight to the point, my gaze steady as I looked at her. ""About the smart speaker. The login history shows it was your account.""

""Ah, the speaker!"" She suddenly realized and then scratched her head awkwardly. ""That's my roommate's. She used my phone a few days ago to log in since her membership expired. I'm sorry if it caused you any trouble!""

Her words were flawless—both distancing herself from the situation and sounding innocent.

Had I not known Ethan's character, I might have believed her.

That man was proud and sensitive—there was no way he'd let a random intern log into our home devices with a personal account.

My gaze slowly shifted from her innocent face to her delicate wrist.

She wore a silver bracelet, two irregularly-shaped rings interlocked, one of which had a small ""E"" engraved on it.

That was the gift I had made for Ethan on our wedding anniversary last year, designed by me and crafted by a friend.

""E"" for Ethan.

One of a kind. Jessica noticed my gaze and instinctively tried to hide her hand behind her back.

I smiled and took a step closer, my tone unexpectedly gentle. ""The bracelet's quite unique. Was it a gift from your boyfriend? He has great taste.""

Her face instantly turned pale, her lips trembling, and she couldn't say a word.

That was enough.

I didn't look at her again and turned to leave.

Once back in the taxi, I immediately called my best friend, Rachel Anderson. She's the best divorce lawyer in the industry.

The moment she picked up, her loud voice came through. ""Hey, Ava, our star designer, what's up? Finally remembered I exist, huh? ""

""Do me a favor,"" I said, staring out the window at the rapidly passing street, my voice unusually calm.

""Check on someone, an intern at Stellar Design, Jessica Collins. Also, dig up all of Ethan's financial transactions and hotel records for the last six months. Don't leave anything out.""

There was a brief silence on the other end, and then she dropped her teasing tone. ""…You planning to take him down?""

""Far worse than that.""

I hung up the phone, and the car fell into complete silence.

Soon, Ethan's call came through.

Looking at the screen with the word ""My Sweetie,"" I found it incredibly ironic. I took a deep breath before answering.

""Ava, what's wrong?"" His usual, gentle voice came through, laced with just the right amount of concern. ""I heard from Rachel that you had her check something for you. Is everything okay with work?""

See, he even planted spies so quickly.

I swallowed my swirling emotions down and spoke in the most casual tone. ""Nothing. Just really missed you all of a sudden.""

There was a moment of relief on his end, followed by a gentle laugh.

""Silly, I miss you too. Once I finish this project, I'll fly back to be with you, my little luna.""

""My Little Luna""—those three words clearly pierced my ears.

My grip on the phone tightened suddenly.

Turns out, I wasn't the only luna.

Or maybe I never was.

Chapter 2
Rachel was impressively efficient. Less than half an hour later, my phone vibrated.

A link appeared, accompanied by a message: ""Congrats to Miss 'Who-Me?' for winning Best Homewrecker in a Leading Role. The receipts are juicier than a Netflix documentary. I almost feel bad charging you full price. Enjoy.""

I clicked on it. It was Jessica's social media account, set to public view.

The latest post was a close-up of her wrist, adorned with that familiar E-shaped bracelet, accompanied by the caption: ""Here comes your little Luna, Mr. M.""

My ""little luna"" nickname, my E-bracelet—now, they had become another woman's trophies.

I scrolled down impassively.

One photo showed the background of our study, with Jessica holding her face and smiling innocently. Behind her was a rare architectural collection I had bought from Italy. ""Absorbing knowledge in Mr. M's study, feeling smarter already~""

Another photo showed her holding a pen, sketching on blueprints. It was the limited-edition pen I gave to Ethan for his 30th birthday. ""The pen Mr. M gave me is amazing. He says I deserve the finest.""

There was another one from our favorite restaurant, with dishes I always ordered. ""At Mr. M's secret base, he says I'm the only one who makes him feel completely at ease.""

Every photo, every word, felt like a surgical knife, cutting into my sweetest memories.

Until I reached a post from three days ago.

In the photo, Jessica held up a printed design draft, smiling with self-satisfaction.

The caption read: ""Mr. M stayed up late helping me revise the design. He says I'm the most talented designer he's ever met, and I'll definitely land the 'Skyline Tower' project. Cheers!""

""Skyline Tower.""

That was the project we at DreamWorks had poured our hearts into for the past six months. It was the most important milestone in my career.

I suddenly shot up from the sofa, grabbed the car keys, and rushed out the door.

The office was empty late at night. I used my fingerprint to unlock the door and went straight to Ethan's office.

His computer screen was still on, with our wedding photo as the screensaver. In the picture, he looked so gentle, so affectionate.

I suddenly felt nauseous.

I typed on the keyboard, and the screen lit up with the password prompt. I tried my birthday. Wrong. I tried our wedding anniversary. Still wrong.

I sneered and typed in Jessica's birthday.

""Welcome.""

The desktop was neat and clean. I immediately spotted the encrypted folder. I opened it to find the final plan for ""Skyline Tower,"" every detail a culmination of months of hard work by me and my team.

Next to it lay another folder, named with just one letter—J.

I opened it. The plan inside was almost identical to ours, with slight adjustments to a few key structural components and design highlights. The core patents had been avoided, but the essence of the design remained.

The plan's signature read two delicate characters: Jessica Collins.

Not only did he cheat, but he also stole my hard work and our company's future, paving the way for his mistress.

A wave of nausea surged through me. I gripped the cold desk tightly to keep myself from collapsing.

Jealousy and betrayal, I realized, could truly make a man unrecognizable.

Chapter 3
The atmosphere at the ""Skyline Tower"" project bidding event was bustling with voices.

I sat in an inconspicuous corner, watching the representative from Stellar Design step onto the stage.

It was Jessica.

Today, she wore a well-tailored professional suit, her long hair tied up, and her face expertly made up. The pure, innocent look she once had was now replaced by the sharpness of a career-driven professional.

She took a deep breath and began presenting her design concept.

""My design inspiration comes from the 'City's Eye.' We hope it's not just a cold building, but a living entity that breathes with the city and witnesses its growth...""

Every word she said felt like a knife to my heart. These were the same words I used to share with Ethan during countless late nights, sipping coffee, eyes reddened from exhaustion.

I once believed it was the most profound connection between us—our souls resonating together.

Now I realized, it was just my one-sided monologue, and he was the most patient thief.

The cruelest irony was that Ethan was sitting in the special guest seat on the judging panel.

Dressed in a perfectly tailored suit, his hair neatly combed, he looked every bit the elite I knew so well.

He listened intently, nodding from time to time. The look in his eyes as he gazed at Jessica was one I had never seen before—admiration, as if he saw her as a precious gem, eager to flaunt her to the world.

He completely ignored me in the corner of the audience, as though I were just an insignificant backdrop.

My phone buzzed in my palm—it was a message from Rachel.

""I can roll up heavy - you want backup or what?""

Looking at the screen, the corners of my mouth tightened into a faint smile. I replied with two words: ""Let's see what happens.""

On stage, Jessica's presentation reached its peak. The final renderings were displayed on the screen, the exact ones she had stolen from my computer.

A low murmur of awe spread through the audience.

When the presentation ended, thunderous applause followed.

The host stepped onto the stage. ""Thank you, Miss Collins, for your wonderful presentation. Next, let's hear from our distinguished guest, a senior figure in the industry, Mr. Miller from 'DreamWorks Design,' who will give his thoughts on this proposal.""

The microphone was handed to Ethan.

He cleared his throat and looked at Jessica with a warm gaze before speaking.

""To be honest, I'm quite impressed.""

""Miss Collins's design perfectly balances artistic beauty with practical functionality, especially with the bold tweaks in several key load-bearing structures. It's very daring, and very full of spirit.""

He used the word ""spirit.""

The same word he used to describe Jessica, the word hurt me.

He paused and scanned the entire room.

""I believe this work is undoubtedly the best of today.""

The applause erupted again, louder than before.

In that moment, the world around me went quiet, leaving only the dull pounding of my heart in my chest.

The host smiled and took over. ""Thank you, Mr. Miller, for such high praise! It seems that Stellar Design is bound to win this one! Now, does anyone from the audience or the judges have any questions for Miss Jessica?""

The room fell silent.

After Ethan's ""expert'' stamp of approval, it seemed like there was nothing left to ask.

Jessica bowed on stage, her face full of pride and joy.

I put my phone away, and in the brief moment when the audience prepared to clap again, I stood up.

The movement was subtle, but it immediately captured the attention of everyone in the room.

The host was taken aback. ""Excuse me, ma'am, may I ask who you are?""

Ethan's smile froze.",2,1755590046.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

# Chapter 1 He Left For A Rich Girl

Aria's POV

I stood in front of the chapel.

Pink roses and white lilies decorated every corner. My favorite flowers.

The guests were already seated. Soon, at the end of the red carpet would stand the man I once loved, waiting to marry his bride.

Everything was perfect.

Except I wasn't the bride.

“I really need to see Jace today.”

I begged the bodyguard blocking the door. A beat-up suitcase and two boxes sat at my feet. Everything I owned in the world.

""No you don’t. Get out of here,"" the bodyguard said icily.

I saw disgust in his eyes. Yeah I get it. No one has sympathy for the crazy ex who shows up at the wedding.

But I have my reason to be here.

""If you don't let me see him, I'll just stand here and all the guests will see me,"" I threatened under my breath.

Jace wouldn't want that. Especially not today.

Because today, he was marrying Delilah Hart.

She is the sister to Alpha Grayson Hart of Redstone Pack. A 100% high-society darling.

All the guys in the world knew that marrying Delilah would totally change their lives, including Jace.

So he made the easy call—marrying the lady who could turn him from a small-town nobody into a golden boy. And dump the girl who stayed by his side for last 4 years when he had nothing.

He didn’t want any guests to see me here. Because I represented his broke, embarrassing past. He wanted me nowhere near his glittering new world.

Tears stung my eyes as I thought of that. Like a knife was twisting in my chest.

“Let me in or I’m starting to yell.” I choked.

The bodyguard frowned. ""Wait here.""

He finally called somebody. A few minutes later, he waved me in.

I wiped my eyes and struggled into the hall with my suitcase and boxes.

Instantly, I felt out of place.

Everything reeked of wealth here. Expensive perfume. Manicured nails. Not a hair out of place. It was everything you imagined about the upper-class and way more.

And me?

I was wearing a baggy T-shirt and jeans. My sneakers had holes.

""God, a homeless. She stinks."" A woman mutter as I walked by.

No it couldn’t be. I just showered this morning. My hair still smelled like strawberries and coconut.

But poverty had a scent, apparently.

""Mr. Carter is inside."" The guard took me to a closed door and warned, “Make it quick.”

“Thank you.”

The room inside looked like something out of a movie. Marble floors. White carpet. A chandelier that probably cost more than my apartment.

And there he was.

The man I used to love.

Adjusting his bowtie in front of a mirror.

Jace was still heartbreakingly handsome. No wonder Delilah fell for him.

When he turned and fixed his gorgeous blue eyes upon me, I still felt my heart race.

""Hey, Jace,"" I said quietly.

And immediately, I wanted to punch myself.

Hey, Jace?!

That’s the best I could do?

His face was ice cold.

""You shouldn't come, Aria.” he said with a frown. “Your ratty suitcase, your ripped jeans, your Vans. None of that belongs here.""

Well if you wanted to be brutal and vicious, that’s how it’s done.

""Don’t you think I deserve an explanation? You dumped me over a fucking email!"" I snapped.

He shrugged. ""Look around you. The wealthiest people in the world came for me today. This suit I’m wearing cost more than you can make in your entire life. What more explanation do you want?""

Wow.

I always knew he was a cold, calculating bastard.

I just didn’t realize how deep it ran.

""Maybe chasing Alpha’s sister got you here faster. But you know what? When she finds out how shallow and cold you are. You’ll lose it all.""

Anger flared across his face.

""I know how to love someone! I just won't waste that on a small-town girl like you.” he said freezingly, “Are we done here?""

“No.”

I took a deep breath and got into the real reason I came.

""You're marrying a rich girl. Fine. But why did you have to get me fired?""

Yeah. I used to work for this jerk.

From intern to full-time at Apex Corp, he was my supervisor.

Our office romance was a secret. And just days ago, I found out he was getting married with Apex CEO’s sister. And I was out of a job thanks to him.

""Right, your job.” The jerk shrugged, “You got your job all thanks to me. Now that I’m not around, maybe they finally saw how incompetent and stupid you are. Problem?""

Was he fucking kidding me?!

""I graduated top of my class. Made it through 7 rounds of interviews. My performance exceeded every quarterly target. I earned that job!"" I snapped.

“Come on, Aria. You really gonna be so naïve?”

He walked closer, smirking.

""You passed the interviews because I said so. Your sales? I contacted those customers for you. Without me, you'd be nothing but a pretty face.""

He seized my chin and looked me over with a disgusting look. I slapped his hand away.

""Give me my job back,” I hissed, my voice slightly trembling. “My dad’s debt. My grandma’s medical bills…I need the money. You of all people should know what it’s like to be poor. Don’t. Make. Me. Beg.""

I was throwing my pride at his feet.

But he just laughed.

""Well, how about I offer you a deal?"" he said as though he’d been waiting for this moment.

He brushed my hair back, fingers trailing down to my collarbone. I shivered in disgust.

""You and I. We never fuck. You were so clinging to that pathetic no-sex-before-marriage rule. Maybe it's time to grow up. Let me fuck you once and I’ll write you very handsome check. How does that sound?""

I widened my eyes in shock.

Then I slapped him. HARD.

“FUCKING HELL…What the hell are you doing?! I’m getting married in front of everyone in fucking 10 minutes!” He roared covering his swollen face.

""Fuck you, Jace!” I yelled, “You're a spineless freeloading puss! And hey—congrats on the wedding. Hope your junk is soft like a fucking spaghetti tonight!""

Then I stormed out dragging my suitcase and boxes, ignoring his angry curses behind me.

Hot tears poured down as I dashed across the hallway.

God this couldn’t be any worse.

I was prepared to drop all my self-esteem and begged with my life. Because I needed the job and money.

But I still let him get to me.

Now what do I do?

My salary barely covered my rent, my father’s debt and grandma’s bill. Now with my job gone, I already got kicked out by my landlord. I probably had to sleep in a park tonight.

So do I go back and let that jerk win? Let him humiliate me...No. I’d rather die than that…

""Hey, watch where you're going!"" someone yelled.

Too late.

I slammed right into the man in front of me.

He was tall. So tall I felt like I’d just walked into a brick wall.

His diamond cufflink was sharp like a blade. When we collided, it sliced clean through my thin T-shirt with a loud rip.

In one second, the front of my shirt was torn open, exposing my white lace bra.

“Ah!” I gasped and looked up.

This was the most handsome man I’d ever seen. His face was like a statue carved by a master artist. And his expression was so cold and distant.

When he looked down at me, I swear I was about to drown in those stormy gray eyes of his.

Suddenly, I recognized who he was.

This was Alpha of Redstone Pack. CEO of Apex Corporation.

Jace’s brother-in-law.

THE legendary. Grayson Hart.

“Aria Collins?”

His voice was sexy and velvety.

He lowered his head and his eyes dropped to the exposed part of my bra. Maybe it was just my imagination, but the color of his eyes seemed to darken as he stared.

Wherever his gaze landed, my skin started burning up.

But wait.

How did he know my name?

# Chapter 2 With Ex's Brother-in-law

Aria’s POV

Of course I recognized him. God, who didn’t?

I’d met him at the Apex gala. His face was on every finance magazine cover, and any time you turned on a TV, there he was—linked to the latest scandal with some actress or model.

But there was no way he’d know who I was.

“I-I…Hello, Alpha Grayson,” I stammered.

He turned his eyes away and said to a nearby guard, “Escort Ms. Collins out.”

“Yes, Alpha.”

The guards stepped in immediately, stretching out their arms like I was some kind of contaminant that might taint Grayson’s perfectly tailored suit.

“Wait a minute. You’re not going to say something about my shirt?” It’s torn beyond repair and was showing my breasts.

He paused. Just for a brief second. Then flicked something down at my feet.

I looked down. A blank check.

“I need a shirt that can cover my front. Not your hush money.” I gritted with humiliation.

But he didn’t even glance back and just walked away.

“God,” I muttered under my breath.

Can you believe these rich bastards?

They think they can buy everything with money.

People nearby were all staring, snickering under their breath. I tried to cover my chest and grab my things to escape, but it was hard to do all that with just two hands.

“Oh my god…Aria Collins?”

Three girls emerged from the whispering crowd. I took one look at them and sighed internally.

Great. Just when I thought today couldn’t get any worse.

“Hello. Layla. Sabrina. Brielle.” I said dryly.

I used to work in the same team with these girls back at Apex. We were all under Jace.

These girls adored Jace. They spent more time flirting with him by the coffee machine than actually working. Which left me doing most of their work.

After I got fired, and when news of my secret relationship with Jace got out, they decided I was public enemy number one.

“What are you even doing here, Aria? Trying to win back your ex at his wedding? That’s a new low even for you,” Layla snickered.

“I’m not here to win anyone back.” I tried to push past them.

But they blocked me.

“What happened to your shirt?” Brielle snickered. “Did you seriously walk in here with your bra out? Is this like some low-budget fashion statement?”

They burst into laughter together.

“You could be completely naked and Jace still wouldn’t give a damn,” Sabrina squeaked. “Because he’s marrying Lady Delilah. THE Delilah Hart! Redstone Pack’s sweetheart. And you…well you’re just a poor-ass small-town girl.”

I stopped in my track and gave them a cold glare, “Oh yeah? Well at least this smalltown girl actually dated Jace. And you all got nothing. Do you know how many times I had to listen to him complained about your screechy voices and cheesy perfume after we got home? Apparently he rather be with me than any of you.”

Their jaws dropped.

“Jace would never say that!” Brielle cried.

“And my perfume isn’t cheesy!” Sabrina screamed.

“Word for word,” I rolled my eyes. “Now move. Or I’m rolling this suitcase over your pretty little skirts.”

They looked like ruffled chickens, but they parted. I quickly shoved my dingy luggage ahead like a weapon and stormed out of the church.

Rich people were assholes.

Grayson, Jace, and their whole damn minions.

I struggled to get my suitcase down the steps, and once I hit the street, cold wind slapped me in the face.

It’s almost night. But I had no idea where to go.

I could crash in the hospital with my grandma, but she’d ask too many questions. Like why I hadn’t brought Jace around recently, or why I wasn’t staying at my apartment. I didn’t want her to know how bad things had gotten.

I thought about the park. Sleeping on a bench. But in a ripped T-shirt that exposed my whole front? Horrible idea.

So I texted my best friend, May, asking to stay at her place for a few days. She was my rock. If the whole world turned against me, at least I still had her.

She texted back right away inviting me to come over.

Dragging my suitcase across the street toward the bus stop, I told myself it was going to be okay. This horrible day was going to end.

Then I heard them.

“Hey, nice shirt!”

A group of street wolves were loitering near the stop.

I hugged myself tighter and curled into the bench, hoping they’d get bored and leave.

“C’mon baby, drop your hands. Let us see what you’re working with.”

Go away. Go away. Go away.

“You rip that shirt yourself? Damn that’s wild. I like that in a girl.” One of them moved closer, reaching for my shoulder.

“Fuck off!” I snapped, my voice shaking.

But it only fired them up.

“Oh, feisty. Shake those tits for me!”

They grabbed my wrists, yanked my arms down. My T-shirt gaped open completely, revealing my lace bra. The cold air made my skin pebble. They laughed even louder.

I struggled and screamed. My wolf growled in rage.

Shifting in the city was illegal…but right now, I didn’t have a second choice…

Just then. Blinding headlights. Followed by screeching tires.

A silver car skidded to a stop inches away.

The door flew open. A deep voice thundered:

“Get in.”

I was too shocked that I didn’t think twice and obeyed. The car peeled away the second I shut the door.

“My suitcase!” I cried.

“Someone will get it,” he said darkly. “Address.”

I told the driver May’s, my body still shaking. Then he pressed a button. A privacy screen slid up between the front and back seats, sealing us in the back.

That’s when he turned toward me and leaned in. Like a beast ready to pounce.

His scent hit me. It’s sharp pine mixed with cold metal.

My head started to get dizzy.

“Walking on the street in that shirt was a mistake,” he said darkly.

“It got like this because of you,” I mumbled.

He snorted.

Then there’s the sound of rustling fabric. A heavy jacket landed across my shoulders. It was still warm from his body and carried his scent.

I held my breath.

Wearing his coat almost felt like…he was wrapping himself around me.

“Alpha Grayson…do you know me?” I whispered.

My gut told me that he would never do this for a strange girl. But if he knew who I was, he must know that I was his sister’s husband’s ex. That didn’t explain why he would help.

“We’ve met,” he said simply.

I stared at him, searching those icy gray eyes. He was staring at me too, with those cold, hungry, possessive eyes. I felt like I was completely naked in front of him.

“Aria,” he warned, voice thick and husky.

But I couldn’t control myself.

I was leaning forward.

Shit. Why did my body become so weird?

My skin was on fire. My panties were wet. All I wanted was more of his scent. More of his heat.

The next second his lips crashed onto mine. Hard. Rough.

I gasped and opened my mouth for him. His tongue slipped in and explored every inch of my mouth, making me shiver. His hands pushed into my torn shirt and grabbed my breast. I couldn’t control my moan when he touched my naked skin.

This…This was crazy.

He was a stranger, and most importantly, my ex’s brother-in-law.

And I was making out with him at the back of his car.

The crazy part was I didn’t even want to stop.

He lifted me onto his lap like I weighed nothing. I straddled his thighs and yanked at his tie as he bit my collarbone.

Then, suddenly, the car stopped.

“Alpha, we’ve arrived,” the driver said behind the screen.

That’s when it all froze.

His lips paused at my neck. I was still squirming on his lap, flushed and throbbing. But he shoved me off.

“We can’t do this,” he said coldly.

# Chapter 3 You're Special To Him

Aria’s POV

“So you’re telling me this guy made out with you in the backseat of his car… and then just shoved you off like nothing happened?” May asked in shock.

20 minutes later, I was sitting at her place, wrapped in one of her oversized hoodies, a steaming mug of tea in my hands.

But I was still reeling from everything that had just happened.

“Yup,” I muttered. “Who knows what’s wrong with him.”

“What an asshole,” she huffed. “But honestly, this really isn’t like you. You dated that jerk Jace for 4 years and didn’t even sleep with him—which, by the way, was a brilliant choice—and now you're suddenly making out with a complete stranger in his car?”

I opened my mouth but had no idea what to say. Yeah, she had a point.

“I—I don’t know. Maybe it was the whole Jace-getting-married thing. Maybe I just snapped and wanted to screw around with someone hotter just to get back at him…Honestly, it was so stupid now that I think of it.”

She grinned and wiggled her brows. “So… he was hot huh?”

My cheeks flushed and my mind drifted back.

Those stormy gray eyes, his perfectly shaped lips on my neck, and those arms that could pick me up like I weighed nothing…Shit I need to stop.

“Yeah. VERY,” I whispered, hiding my red face behind the mug.

May burst out laughing. “Now we’re talking! That’s exactly what you need right now—a drop-dead gorgeous rebound to get that loser Jace out of your system. Screw your ‘no sex before marriage’ rule. Life is short.”

I gave her a weak smile.

Honestly, I didn’t need a rebound. I needed a job, money, and a place to live. Grayson Hart was like dessert when you can’t even afford dinner.

“So… do you even know who this guy was?” she asked.

I hesitated. Right at this moment, the doorbell rang.

She jumped up to get it and came back a few minutes later, hauling in my luggage, her face frozen in disbelief.

“OMG. You are not gonna believe what just showed up outside.”

“Umm… my luggage?” I joked.

“Two fucking muscular guys in black suits and guns! And a freaking stretch limo! They called me ‘ma’am’ and said they hope Miss Aria has a wonderful evening. Now, you—”

She leapt at me and shook me by the shoulders.

“—you tell me right now who the hell you hooked up with!”

I squealed and dropped into the couch with her, laughing and giggling breathlessly.

“Okay, okay—I’ll tell you. It was… Grayson Hart.”

I practically whispered his name.

Because honestly, I still couldn’t believe it either.

May froze, eyes wide as saucers. “Grayson—THE Grayson Hart?! As in our Alpha? The CEO of Apex?!”

“And Jace’s soon-to-be brother-in-law. Now you know how stupid I was earlier?”

She let out a full-on scream. Then she grabbed my hand, her face flushed with excitement. “Oh my God! Aria, do you know what this means? Alpha Grayson never even lends his jacket to his model girlfriends. He likes you. You’re special!”

“No,” I said firmly. “If I was special, he wouldn’t have thrown me off his lap when I tried to take off his shirt.”

“Maybe he had somewhere to be—”

“Don’t, May. Let’s be real. Guys like him don’t fall for girls like me.” I took another sip of tea, hiding the ache in my chest.

Hell even Jace thought I was beneath him.

What chance did I have with Grayson freaking Hart?

“Don’t be silly, Aria. You’re gorgeous. And smart and amazing and—WAIT! I just had the best idea ever.”

“What?”

“That arrogant jerk Jace thinks you’re just some small-town prude who wasn’t good enough for him right? But what if you ended up with Alpha Grayson? It’ll be easy to get him because he’s already obsessed. Oh, it would destroy Jace. That dickhead would never recover.”

OKAY.

I’d be lying if I said that exact scenario hadn’t crossed my mind when Grayson kissed me back.

What girl hasn’t daydreamed about dating the perfect guy and getting revenge in the most dramatic way possible?

But right now, I couldn’t afford to daydream. Reality was already breathing down my neck.

“Tempting. But right now I need a job and enough cash to keep Grandma in her hospital bed. Dating rich dudes isn’t exactly high on my to-do list.”

May looked at me with soft eyes. “So…any plans? I can try to hook you up with a job, but you know I just work at a coffee shop, and with your degree, you deserve so much more.”

I hugged her. “Thank you. Really. I’ll figure something out. Apex promised me severance when they fired me, so I’m going to HR tomorrow to get it sorted.”

If I could get that money, at least I’d be OK for the next round of Grandma’s medical bills.

—

The next morning, I showed up at Apex right on time.

But the second Brielle walked in with the HR manager, I had a bad feeling.

“What’s she doing here?” I asked coldly.

“I’ll explain in a minute,” HR replied with a polite, rehearsed smile as she sat across from me. “So Ms. Collins, I understand you’re here to discuss severance?”

“Yes. So let’s not waste time. Just give me the check and I’ll be out of here.”

“Unfortunately, severance only applies when the company terminates a contract without cause. In your case… it appears you were let go due to misconduct.”

Misconduct?

What the freaking hell.

“Jace made a snap decision and booted me. What misconduct are you talking about?”

“But that’s not what Mr. Carter said. He provided evidence that you made a costly error on a sales quote—omitting a few zeroes, to be exact. Cost the company millions. Here’s the email record.”

She handed me a printed sheet.

I swore I had never sent this email in my life. But there it was—my name in the sender field.

No freaking way.

Jace forged this.

“And Mr. Carter reported that you had a difficult attitude toward your coworkers. Quote: ‘impatient and arrogant.’ Brielle’s here to verify that.”

Brielle twirled her hair and smiled smugly. “Yeah. Aria was a horrible team player.”

I stood so fast my chair screeched. “The only thing I didn’t ‘teamplayed’ with you was flirt with the boss in the breakroom!”

“Liar!” she yelled. “And I asked Jace. He never said my voice was screechy!”

Oh my God. I couldn’t believe how stupid she was.

“Sit down, Miss Collins,” HR warned. “As of now, not only are you not getting severance, but we’re also considering legal action to recover the losses. If you understand the situation here, sign this acknowledgement—”

“Does Alpha Grayson know about this?” I asked.

Both of them froze. After a long pause, HR finally found her voice. “What does Alpha Grayson have to do with any of this?”

“He owns Apex, doesn’t he? Does he know his team is abusing their power and firing hardworking employees illegally?”

HR frowned. Brielle let out a loud snort. “Please. Don’t act like you know Alpha Grayson.”

“What if I do? What if I go to him and then it’s you who gets fired?”

She laughed in my face. “Oh, you mean you know him on TV?”

“Let’s find out.”

I shoved my chair back and stormed out, heading straight for the CEO’s private elevator at the end of the hall. HR scrambled after me, shouting my name.

I was too furious to care how this ended. All I wanted now was to blow the whole damn place up.

Two guards stood by the elevator.

“I need to see Alpha Grayson,” I told them.

“Appointment?”

“No, but I swear he knows me. Just tell him it’s Aria—from yesterday. He’ll remember.”

“You aren’t the first girl here saying that,” one of them mocked.

“Come on, Miss Collins,” HR snapped, trying to drag me back. “This is getting crazy. Go back, sign the paper. Take responsibility for your own mistake.”

“I didn’t send that email. It was Jace—he’s framing me! I will report all of you.”

“Alpha Grayson doesn’t have time for your report, or your visit, or any of your little drama!”

“I believe no one but me has the right to decide that,” a cold voice said behind us.

# Chapter 4 Take Me, Please

Aria’s POV

A large hand grabbed my arm and pulled me away from HR’s grip.

I looked up and my heart almost stopped.

Even I couldn’t believe he just showed up here. It felt like a dream.

“A-Alpha Grayson,” HR stammered, her face frozen with shock and fear.

“I don’t need employees who think they can make decisions for their boss,” he said freezingly while wrapping his arm around my waist. “If I see something like this again, you’re fired.”

“Y-yes, Alpha. I’m terribly sorry…”

HR’s expression was priceless, but I was in no mood to enjoy it. His icy pine scent consumed me again, making my body weak and hot. My wolf let out a soft purr, urging me to lean into him. But before I could even move, he let go.",2,1755589820.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False
1muc1ju,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1muc1ju/when_sadness_feels_like_home/,When Sadness Feels Like Home,"Addicts to sadness aren’t officially recognized enough to form a support group (yet), but I think many could really use one. We’re the ones who, even when something beautiful happens or we find ourselves in a stretch of happiness, somehow find a way back to our safe, gloomy corner of the mind. It’s not that we don’t like happiness, we just find it… suspicious. Too bright, too unstable. Sadness is consistent. We know it inside and out, it’s our old couch: sunken, worn, but ours. Here’s one example of what it’s like to live with a mental illness, to live as an addict to sadness.
My husband, who despises my taste in music, steals the kid's computer, shoves the dresser out of the way, connects the cables, wrestles with the remote, and sets up the lighting for a better vibe, all just to play an ancient concert CD on the TV for me. The kids are jumping, dancing, screaming with joy. This should be one of those “perfect family moments.”
But I’m sitting there on the couch like just a bystander in my own life, with coffee gone cold and thoughts even colder.
Living with a mental illness suck. When life serves you a scene to remember, and you can barely fake that you care in the moment, then you feel that painful realization and it makes you feel even worse. The guilt of not being able to control your feelings and thoughts, of hurting the people around you. That cursed addiction to sadness I just can’t shake. There are days when everything is suffocating me, when no one and nothing can change it.
Those days pass me by like a rainy weekend, and I just watch the rain tapping on the window as if it’s running from lightning in the distance, waiting for the sun to fight for its patch of sky and reveal a rainbow polishing its own colors so it can be even brighter and more beautiful this time.

They remembered the first time their owner brought them home, eyes bright with excitement as they imagined morning runs through the golden - lit streets of Los Angeles.  
That night, as a soft breeze drifted through the open window, the sneakers whispered to each other. They dreamed of exploring the rugged trails of the Pacific Northwest, feeling the crunch of gravel underfoot and the fresh mountain air. They talked about being worn to a local 5K race, cheering on friends and soaking up the community spirit. A tiny dust mite, invisible to the eye, “listened” as the sneakers hoped to be part of countless adventures, big and small.  
As the first rays of dawn peeked through the curtains, the sneakers fell silent, filled with anticipation. They knew that soon, they’d be laced up again, ready to carry their owner through a new day of memories, one comfortable step at a time.

If you’re around Pristina or Prizren and could host us — even just giving us a corner of your floor — we’d be incredibly grateful. And if hosting isn’t possible, we’d still love to meet up for a coffee or a chat!

But given all the notes I was able to gather I am pretty certain that it was a Jamaican brand of rum with molasses. Any help in tracking down the specific brand of rum that he's looking for would be most appreciated. For reference the liquor had: (1) At least 40 to 60 alcohol content. (2) Green or black labeling with green edging. (3) The middle or stout of the bottle had a texture similar to a Cuban chain. (4) The bottle was dark, small, bulging at the bottom, and had a curvy middle with a small stout. (5) It was corked and had italized font that he couldn't read at the time.

1mubsvy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskForAnswers/comments/1mubsvy/a_question_about_life/,A Question about life,"Hello reddit. I am 27 year old adult male. I’ve been a genuine worker my whole life. I have a great job, a family, we have two beautiful children. 
For 2 years I’ve worked on a production plant as plant operator and for 4 years as inert material lab technician. I’ve earned good money as plant operator and I am starting to feel like life is getting better in terms of stability and affordability. But unfortunetly the job has huge shift hours. I’ve done a couple of projects that emotionally and mentally have drained me. I’ve started smoking just to have a break at work and now it is a regular process for me.
My hobby (volleyball) has taken a back seat. I mostly work 4 days a week with shifts of at least 10-12 hours that all together with going home is at least 15 hours away from home and right when holidays start I just take one day to turn myself off from the world by playing video games all day immersing myself in RPGs like Skyrim.
It takes me ~1 hour to go to work with my car, because I live in countryside home that we own.
I am drained of life.
Holiday trips are fun, we’ve been to Austria, UK. But I’ve chosen a lifestyle where it feels like I am not being seen by my children. I don’t get to see them grow. I don’t get to be home.

Work is also slowly becoming a mess and the stress and responsibility of operating a production plant is… well… taking a toll… 
On the other hand the company I am working for gives monthly/quarterly/yearly bonuses, insurance, free coffee, high safety standarts, christmas partys and summer festivals. I mean that is my bread and jam of things I would want a company to offer a worker.

I am slowly questioning value of money compared to time that I have to enjoy everything else.

I feel like I have a few options:
1. Rent an room close by and live only during shift days to have at least some decent sleep

2. I have found a job opportunitty nearby, less pay, smaller but similar benefits, but night shifts.

3. Talk to a psychologist

4. Talk to my supervisor

Started this job with a lot of motivation, I am still seen as one of the best workers. I learned everything quickly. But now when my routine has established I am working everyday with the message in my head of “just through until weekends start”",1,1755588780.0,AskForAnswers,0,1.0,False

1) Where should I buy my beans from, so for the first set of beans I got them from Starbucks cause they grind and give it but I know now that grinding your own beans depending on use is better so yeah, should I get beans from sleepy owl? It looks good or just stick to Starbucks or is there some other brand 
2) what grinder should I get? My mom and I can’t had grind coffee cause we both have back and hand issues, so looking for an electric grinder, the ones I have seen online have the same build as my mixer grinder so should I just use that? I don’t wanna drop 2k on something I already own, so your reccos on good coffee grinders really help my budget is max 3k cause I already spent a lot on beans and the espresso machine.

Detox and withdrawals were HARD, thankfully I had medical help to safely get through it. Right now it feels like I’ve woken up from a very long sleep.

I find it easier to do everyday things, I find enjoyment in little activities. It’s early days and my journey is just beginning, but for the first time in ages I feel some level of hope for the future. I know the cravings will come and they will hit hard, it’s not my first rodeo unfortunately. But this time I have a better support network. I’ve learned something from each relapse. 

My appetite is slowly returning, my doctor says I’m somewhat malnourished with inflammation in the liver, but that with good diet and continued sobriety my levels should return back to normal in about 3-6 months time. After 10 years of heavy drinking I count myself very lucky. 

I struggle with what to do with my time, there’s so much more time in the day now. Evenings are the hardest, but I’m taking little steps to change my routine. Any tips for what to do when you’re feeling lost and bored? It’s like having to learn who I am as a person all over again. 

So far my favourite things have been: restful sleep, not waking up in cold sweat at 3am and throwing up every morning, not having to haul out bags and bags of empties every other day, not having to rotate stores and constantly stress when and where I will get my next drink and not feeling constant shame and guilt. 

I will cheers today with a sparkling lemonade, go for a walk and pick up my favourite coffee.

What I’m not sure about is what type of light to get along the center portion. 

I saw a YT video that recommended multiple layers of light, so I’m thinking:

- wall sconces over each window (as drawn)
- one sconce in the middle of the wall where floating shelves will be (the coffee bar side)
- under cabinet lights
- recessed/can lights throughout and/or drop lights

The look I’ve seen online mostly is drop lights along the middle but the galley kitchens pictured are usually smaller. Thing is this galley kitchen is kind of wide but not wide enough to put an actual island. So I don’t know if drop lights is enough for this wide of a space. Also, I’ll most likely have to add a rolling island so would like some focused lighting over that. 

So, would you do recessed lights only? Drop lights only? Or both?

Until he remembered a very distinct liquor he had when he and his family went bar-hopping in the Bahamas. He described the flavor as ""coffee-like"" and ""sweet"", and described it as being rather smooth despite tasting like a type of rum. I had asked him for more details, but since it has been so long, he can only remember so much about the bottle and flavor. But given all the notes I was able to gather I am pretty certain that it was a Jamaican brand of rum with molasses. Any help in tracking down the specific brand of rum that he's looking for would be most appreciated.
For reference the liquor had:
(1) At least 40 to 60 alcohol content.
(2) Green or black labeling with green edging.
(3) The middle or stout of the bottle had a texture similar to a Cuban chain.
(4) The bottle was dark, small, bulging at the bottom, and had a curvy middle with a small stout.
(5) It was corked and had italized font that he couldn't read at the time.

\----

Rules for Use-

 1: Feel free to fill however you like and post anywhere! Monetize away! Just toss me the link so I can listen too! I want to see what you all create!

 2: Credit me if you do decide to use my scripts. Veiled\_Rose is the psuedo I use for these scripts - (but you're welcome to use AsryaKino as well, it's my main online handle and I can be found in other places under that name)

 3: If you need to make edits, feel free. But please keep it reasonable. I know pacing, language, and localization can be a bit difficult sometimes. Plus, gender doesn't really exist; any gendered language I use is just so I can keep a clear image of the character in my head.  
3.A  - I'm asking respectfully that you do not insert hate speech, racist remarks, or political speech into my scripts. I do my best to be inclusive and generally neutral but I am a queer, disabled, creator and I include a lot of those themes into my works - if you're not comfortable with that, you should skip my scripts. I won't change my work to kowtow to hate.

 4: There's likely going to be more of the story! So keep in mind what parts of the plot are in place if you do need to edit. If you want the continuity, keep the plot and story intact. Not all scripts will have more to the story, but I tend to world build, and return to my sandboxes in the future.

 5: I don't know how open this script is to being genre changed, but I'd love to see how it's used. Please just send me a link or the like so I can see how you do it! You are free to make these NSFW if you want, again, I'd love to see what you make!

 6: I relish feedback! Please feel free to give me critique, I'm still learning as always and I want to improve the offerings I have. Just be respectful, and don't be cruel about it. I do appreciate frank and open feedback, just don't be mean. Honesty doesn't mean you can be cruel or mean.

 7: I prefer using human artists. So don't use an AI voice for my scripts. And while I understand the draw of AI artwork, I don't support it. I'd prefer kitbashed bad photoshops and a blank background or stock image over AI ""art"" any day of the week for thumbnail art. I know I'm not established enough to ask performers to never use AI artwork or music for my scripts - but I do ask that you support human artists whenever possible - You can even ask me if you want what I can't make myself I have artist friends all over! 

8: If you're interested in more information about the characters or the plotline for context, please feel free to ask! My DM's are open! I love talking, especially about my creations! I can -always- tell you more about the character.

I know reception in here is a little wonky on a good day…

And it seems to be acting up pretty badly today.

But -this- rang through so that irritating ringtone you use should -definitely- have gotten your attention - even if my texts aren't doing the job.

So this is me making your phone ring super loud and annoying so you'll check it and call back!

And since you didn't pick up, I'm gonna call again.

Dork.

*\*chuckling playfully\**

So yeah- I'll be here like another… thirty?

*\*thoughtfully\**

Maybe more, someone keeps trying to take my gym and I'm kicking their ass.

I'm gonna stick around until they give up or run out of pokemon.

*\*mocking seriousness\**

Team Instinct forever.

*\*as if reminding\**

Oh! Hey, pop a message or something if you already headed home and want me to just pick something up.

Otherwise I choose for you.

\*cartoonish\*

Muahahaha\~

Okay Nerd-a-sarus Rex.

I'll meet you back at the house.

Hey, I'm standing by your car in the garage.

You're not still in the megaplex, are you?

I must've pinged your phone like…

A dozen times or something by now.

You -had- to have heard at least one of them.

By now you'd've sent me a half a dozen flipped birds, a bunch of pissed off memes, and cussed me out for blowing your phone up so much.

*\*quietly scared/worried\**

Call me back.

Please.

My gut is telling me something's wrong.

And I'd rather you'd call and let me know directly that you're all good.

Talk to you soon.

*\*mockingly angry, but genuinely worried\**

Gaz, I fucking swear if your phone died and that's why you're not answering, I'm kicking your ass when I find you.

I'm only leaving this message so when you DO get your phone turned back on this is what you'll see in your visual voice mails and you'll know -why- I'm kicking your ass.

I got you that power bank with the built in cable for your phone -specifically- for situations like this.

If the spare battery is dead too, I'm kicking your ass -twice-.

*\*exasperated, trying to not be overly angry or scared\**

It doesn't do you any good if you don't keep the backup battery charged.

Hell the power bank plugs into the wall directly!

There's outlets all over the place you could use!

There is NO excuse for your phone dying while you're out.

\*teasing, but irritated\*

Know what?

I might just kick your ass for fun at this point.

Just for worrying me so much.

*\*genuine concern, mild fear\**

Gaz…

*\*calming breath, trying to keep their words even\**

I'm really worried now.

I know you don't like me checking your location tag without good reason.

But it's been a few hours now and I haven't heard back from you even once.

I'm not gonna feel bad for pulling it up.

This isn't like you.

You've -always- responded - even if it was just that stupid ass thumbs up emoji to let me know you got the messages.

*\*increasingly worried, attempting denial\**

My gut says something's definitely wrong now.

So I'm throwing this into your voice mails for the timestamp.

Your car location is listed as here at the center…

I'm standing by it, so that's no surprise.

But -your- location's off.

If your phone's dead, that sorta-kinda makes sense, but it's only showing that your last known location was -here-.

Even your bag tag isn't throwing a current signal.

Both of them stopped sending location when you left the megaplex.

*\*genuine fear, trying to mask it, quiet\**

Where are you, Squirt?

There's only a few reasons I can think of that your bag-tag wouldn't show up and all of them involve me getting called as your emergency contact…

And I haven't gotten a call from the hospital or the police station that says you're currently sitting somewhere with them.

*\*forcing self to be calm\**

Timestamping this.

I talked to the security guard and they said no one matching your description came across their desk for any reason.

Good, bad, or indifferent.

The megaplex is closing for the night now though.

Your car is still in the garage and I don't have the spare key on me.

Security said it'd be fine overnight but that I have to get it home before tomorrow evening or they tow it.

*\*aside, to the security guard\**

I got that right, right?

 

***{Action - The security guard repeats that it's okay to leave the car for the night and it won't be towed unless it's not picked up before closing the next day}***

 

\[PSY\]

*\*assured\**

So this is recorded audio proof that the car shouldn't be towed tonight or tomorrow.

Just in case some asshole tow company decides to do it before I get back with the key.

*\*worried, denying the increasing evidence that something happened\**

I don't know where you are or why you're not answering, but I'm gonna go get the spare key and come back to get your car.

I really, -really-, hope you just forgot you drove here and you caught the bus and fell asleep on the long route or something stupid like that.

*\*distraught, somewhat hopeless\**

But my gut says that's not the case…

You'd better be okay, Squirt.

*\*quiet, pleading, almost desperate\**

Please be okay…

Psy?

I didn't think you'd be coming here -immediately-…

I didn't even get the chance to warn Jazz you might be visiting soon.

I only -just- sent the message off to River that you wanted the address and that I gave it to you.

\*impressed\*

How'd you get here so fast?

*\*Mild panic seeping into speech\**

I dunno.

I dunno…

I -don’t- know.

I dunno if something's actually happened or if all of the shit you said about Obscura and Lightkeepers just has me paranoid.

But my gut says something is -wrong-.

That something bad happened.

There was -something- that felt weird about the megaplex today.

It…it's always kinda weird there so I.

I Don't. Know.

*\*almost pleading\** 

I might be overreacting…?

 

\[RUMI\]

*\*worried, with genuine empathy and care\**

Weird how?

If your gut says something’s wrong, trust it.

Something probably did happen, but it's fine we'll figure it out.

*\*trying to be reassuring\**

But I don't understand what you're talking about right now.

So I need you to sit down.

Okay, now, start from the beginning…

How sweet is that?

That's some pretty good friends you have there.

*\*sincerely\**

Sorry for leaving you alone in here for so long.

I had to go finish up my reports to the higher ups….

*\*mild concern\**

It's -really- late now though…

Are you -normally- this much of a night owl?

Or are you just an insomniac?

*\*caring, as if genuinely concerned\**

I know for a fact that chair's comfy;

I figured you'd've caught a nap at the very least.

But it doesn't look like you slept a wink…

*\*just as if the phone should feel bad for going off so often\**

Did the phone keep you up?

 

\[LISTENER\]

Why the hell would I sleep here?

You -kidnapped- me.

 

\[MISHA\]

*\*matter of fact, a bit mocking\**

Well… of course I kidnapped you…

We need your buddy to come here -and- be willing to work with us.

Using -you- as bait just makes sense.

Duh.

*\*very mild concern\**

But being kidnapped shouldn't keep you from taking a nap in a comfy chair.

You probably need the sleep after the stressful day you've had.

*\*helpfully\**

Besides, I catch Z's in that chair all the time - I know first hand how comfy it is.

That's why I put you in it.

Cuffing your hands behind you is just a precaution so you can't get into trouble.

*\*proudly, self-satisfied\**

I even snagged the comfy cuffs for you.

And they're loose enough your shoulders shouldn't even hurt… much.

*\*chipper\**

Hey, if you're flexible enough you could pull your hands in front of you, you know?

I don't think you'd be able to do too very much if you got your hands in front of you…

But you'd be more comfortable, at least.

\**resigned*\*

But, it's up to you in the end.

I mean… it's not like you're a threat.

So… I don't care one way or the other how your hands are cuffed.

1mubge4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mubge4,not a single one is a clone 🤯🤯,"last week blindbought Swiss Arabians Essence of Casablanca 
and everyone else was talking about how the entire cities line is fire 
so had to go to the store and check them out 
and ended up buying the remaining 4 🤤🤪

i have 160+ fragrances so
here’s what i can tell you about each fragrances:
also all of them are made by master perfumers from brands like Firmenich and Givaudan 

Essence of Casablanca- starts with a slight fruity punch , a sexc vanilla in a dry down 
it does sound like it leans feminine but it’s perfectly unisex and works well in summers

Soul of Bali - The newest out of all, honestly the best tropical and summer fragrance
it did last 12 hours in skin for me , it lists mango but don’t really smell it? but definitely do get the pineapple, spicy ginger and citrus 
the dry down is long lasting 

Opulence of Dubai, being born and stayed in dubai my whole life 
id agree that it’s dubai in a bottle,  such a well blended fragrance with a bit of chocolate , spices and cardamom, arabic coffee , slight citrus opening 
and a hint of rose too 
i’d say this is what royalty smells like 


Spirit of Valencia - is quite interesting made by perfumer Hamid Merati- who made majority Parfums de marly including althair and layton
Goldfield and banks - ingenious ginger , pacific rock moss, Initio , Kayali and the OG mercedes benz 
When you look at the notes you may say it’s feminine 
it’s a perfect fresh , citrus and a bit floral and the projection is crazy on it 

Passion of Venice - for me it’s the most underrated fragrance cause i don’t hear any influencers talking about it
it’s spicy but sweet 
it has peppers but also vanilla and musk 
and the patchouli in this really fits well 
and a very woody touch too!!

(Part 3),"The sliding doors hissed open and the storm followed me in, sheets of rain slapping the glass as if they wanted in too. I was soaked through, trembling with cold and adrenaline, my teeth almost chattering from the fury I’d been chewing on the whole drive.

I stomped to the nurses’ station.
“Cancer ward,” I barked.

The woman behind the desk barely looked up. She had that glassy-eyed, shift’s-almost-over look. “Visiting hours ended several hours ago. The ward is closed.”

I tried again. ""But miss, I'm supposed to...""

She popped her gum and looked up at me, exasperated. ""Did I stutter, visiting hours are over. The. Ward. Is. Closed."" She looked back at the screen. ""Good evening, sir."" I'm her mind, I was dismissed. 

That was it. The lid blew.

“No, no, let’s try this again,” I snapped, leaning over the counter. “Hi, I’m the grandson of the hundred-and-eight-year-old cancer patient you somehow misplaced. I didn’t just drive through God’s own pissstorm because I wanted to play chess in the waiting room. I’m here to talk to the cops, because somebody in this building let a bedridden geriatric waltz into the night!”

Her lips thinned. The click-clack of her keyboard didn’t even slow. ""Do I need to get security?"" 

And then I was wrapped in arms. Soft, pale, familiar arms. They wrapped around me from behind, stopping the rant dead in my throat. A small body pressed against my back, cheek nuzzling between my shoulder blades.

“Thank the depths,” she breathed, voice quivering with relief. “You’re safe. I was so worried.”

I turned into the embrace without thinking, without even looking. I didn’t need to. I’d know my wife's arms anywhere. She tilted her face up and brushed a kiss against my cheek. Even now, I can’t get over how lucky I am.

Aria is gorgeous in that way that never feels real. Her skin is pale & flawless. Moonlight made flesh. Her lips were naturally red and full. Her hair falls fiery red and straight all the way to her waist, framing a body sculpted like some ancient ideal... a narrow waist flowing into hips men would have started wars over. 

Helen of Troy was a county fair queen next to her.

But her eyes… God, her eyes were a gift. 

She had heterochromia too, but hers outshone mine by leagues. Her right eye burned gold-amber, sharp and lupine, while her left shimmered a violet so deep it looked alive, gleaming with its own secret knowledge. Looking into them was like falling into a well. And being ok with it. 

“How you holding up?” she asked softly, running her fingers through my damp hair. 

I kissed her again, needing the contact, and forced myself to be honest. “Not great. Today’s been… weird. I’m all over the place. I think I’m starting to crack up.”

She smiled, that crooked little smile that always cut through my worst days. “Oooh, can’t have that. If you have to crack, crack down. You won’t hit the tile as hard. Less pieces for me to put back together when I fix you.”

We pushed through the halls, walking arm-in-arm, ignoring the screech of the nurse behind us. 'Fuck her,' I thought. 'Fuck anyone who can’t spare an ounce of kindness for people who are obviously bleeding inside.'

The elevator doors yawned open. Aria squeezed my arm tighter as we stepped in. She hates elevators, calls them “floating death coffins.” Says she always imagines the cable snapping every time she has to use one.

I wrapped an arm around her and kissed her hair. “I got you.”

To distract her, I just… started talking. Everything I’d discovered so far tumbled out of me in a rush: the hidden box, the sharkskin journal, the mines, the song. She listened the way only Aria can, like every word was a glass ornament she had to hold carefully.

“Man,” she murmured when I finally ran out of steam, “you have had a weird day.” Then, more serious: “You gonna keep reading it?”

“I have to,” I said. “It was what Pop wanted. Heck, he asked me to write about it. But Christ… how the hell I’m supposed to make a reader believe it is beyond me. It’s insane.”

“You think it’s true, then?” She asked, her two-tone eyes locking on to mine. 

The elevator dinged and the doors opened onto a pale, humming corridor. We stepped out into the cancer ward, fluorescent lights buzzing overhead.

I nodded. “Pop didn’t hold much truck with fiction. And it doesn’t read like he was just making it up. Plus there’s maps, photos, other stuff I haven’t even dug through yet. Feels like corroborating evidence, maybe. Kind of like he wanted proof, in case anyone ever called him a liar.”

We rounded the corner and the first thing I saw was a uniformed cop standing in front of yellow tape, one hand out to keep back a knot of gawkers. For a second it felt surreal, like I’d walked straight into an episode of Castle.

Except the smell wasn’t stage smoke and popcorn. It was brine.

The cop spotted us and gave me a polite nod. “Family?”

“Yeah,” I muttered. “Grandson. Eryk Fauster.”

He checked our IDs and yelled to someone over his shoulder. 

That’s when another man stepped out from behind the tape. Not a uniform, plainclothes. He was tall and scarecrow-thin, a long coat hanging off him like it didn’t quite belong. His cheeks were hollow, his jaw sharp, and his thinning hair looked like it had been fighting the comb since the Reagan administration. He had the kind of face that made you think of an old ivory cameo, all angles and shadows.

“Detective Clyde Grimsby,” he said, voice smooth but stretched thin, like parchment ready to tear. He reached out and shook my hand. “You’d best come in, Mr. Fauster. Bring your wife, too. There are 'things' we'd like you to look at. Maybe see if you can't help us understand what we're seeing.”

The way he said “things” made my stomach tighten. This wasn’t just an old man who'd up and vanished. 

We stepped inside and the smell hit me first. Not antiseptic, not the faint tang of bleach and sickness. Salt. Rotting seaweed. The stench of low tide trapped in four whitewashed walls.

Then I saw it.

Kelp.

Everywhere.

It wasn’t just littered across the floor. It clung to the walls, drooped from the ceiling tiles like wet streamers. But it wasn’t random. No, the strands were arranged. Interlaced and woven into sprawling geometric patterns that made no sense to the eye and yet… almost did. Shapes that wanted to be letters, curling together into an alphabet I almost recognized.

I tried to focus, and the whole mess seemed to shiver, shifting just enough to make my stomach turn. The longer I stared, the more certain I was that it wasn’t just decoration. It was record-keeping. Words written in a language nobody on earth was supposed to read.

And God help me, something about it tugged at me. A sense of déjà vu. Like the runes were whispering I’d seen them before, in dreams, or somewhere deeper.

“Stay in the box, Mister and Misses Fauster.”

Grimsby’s voice snapped me back. The detective gestured with one long finger to a square of red tape marked on the linoleum. “Please. Evidence control. Don’t disturb the scene.”

I stepped into the taped-off square with Aria at my side, heart hammering. My grandfather’s hospital room looked less like a crime scene and more like the inside of a drowned cathedral.

No... not cathedral... That's too grandiose. But it  was a shrine.

Pop’s deathbed had been made with impossible precision, sheets tucked into sharp military corners as if an inspection was due. At the foot of the bed lay a neatly folded flag... the kind they hand to widows, creased triangles of silence and grief.

And on the pillow, right where his head had rested for the last year, sat his dog tags. The chain looped around a single envelope.

The envelope was sealed with red wax, stamped with that same swirling symbol I’d already seen once, the one from the zebrawood box, the one that made my stomach twist and my head hurt if I looked too long. My name was written across the front in a flowing script I didn’t recognize. Elegant and deliberate.

My hands shook.

This wasn’t a kidnapping scene. There were no signs of struggle, no overturned furniture, no blood. It looked like a send-off. A ritual. A man’s last message arranged with care by hands that weren’t his own.

I didn’t know what to think.

Grimsby’s voice cut through my thoughts. “Yeah… we don’t know what to make of it either.”

I flinched, half-convinced the scarecrow detective had just read my mind. Then I realized I must’ve spoken out loud.

He folded his long arms, the cuffs of his coat dangling like loose sails. “It’s obviously some kind of ritual. Maybe a kidnapping, though I’ll be damned if we’ve got anything like it on record. Nothing even close. And the blackout?” He shook his head. “Not an accident. Somebody cut the power. We pulled the logs. Timed it to the minute.”

He glanced at the sealed envelope on the pillow like it might spit venom. “Whoever did this wanted the lights out. Wanted privacy for… whatever this was.”

“They did all of this…” My voice cracked as I swept an arm toward the kelp-stained walls. “In a five-minute blackout? In the middle of a hurricane? How the hell did they even get in?”

Grimsby shook his head, the motion awkward on his thin frame. “That’s another weird thing. Closest guess is the window.” He let that hang a second, like he knew how insane it sounded. We were on the 8th floor...

“But we’ve had teams crawl over every inch of this place,” he went on, voice dry as the Sunday paper. “No trace of kelp in the hallways, no seawater anywhere else in the building. If they dragged it in, they did it without leaving so much as a drip trail. And if they did carry it in?” He gestured at the walls, at the ceiling laced with weeds. “They’d have needed a wheelbarrow. Maybe two. Not something you sneak past security in the middle of a goddamn hurricane.”

“Has anyone read the letter?” I asked. My throat felt dry, like I’d just swallowed a mouthful of sand.

Grimsby shook his head. “No. We were waiting on you. Offered to let your wife look first, but she declined.” His hollow eyes flicked toward Aria. “Said it should be yours. In case it was your grandfather’s last words.”

""It would have felt like prying..."" She said softly, and patted my arm. ""I didn't want to see what was meant just for you."" 

My voice trembled. “May I see it?”

Grimsby was already pulling a pair of latex gloves from his coat pocket. He handed them over.

“Yeah,” he said. “Go on. Just… don’t touch it barehanded. And once you’re done, I’ll need to bag it for evidence.”

The envelope sat on the pillow like a relic in a reliquary, wax seal glistening faintly under the fluorescent lights. It was waiting on me. I could feel it. Some malignant force was going to strike me from inside that simple vellum encasement. I knew it. 

My hands shook as I slipped the gloves on.

Grimsby crossed the room with those long, deliberate strides of his, stepping around the kelp like it might bite, careful not to disturb a single strand. He plucked the envelope from the pillow with two fingers and carried it back to me, holding it as though it might shatter.

“Be careful,” he warned. “Thing’s soaked through.”

I took it gingerly, heart pounding. It was far too heavy to contains simple paper. 

I slid a finger under the wax seal. To my surprise, it parted with almost no resistance, crumbling away like it had been waiting for me.

I was right, inside wasn’t paper.

It was slate. A smooth, black shard, cold against my skin even through the gloves. Etched across its surface in delicate, perfect strokes were words that stopped my breath cold.

""Eryk,

Don’t cry, boy. I’m gone. But I go to rest now with the dead and dreaming one beneath the ice. The city of my dreams waits for me. My wives and daughters are waiting there.

Love,
Pop""


The lines glinted faintly, like they were flecked with micha or something. 

I started to slip the slate back into the envelope, when something else slid out.

A photo.

Old, curling at the edges, the kind of sepia tint that said 1940s without needing a date stamp. I caught it in my hand before it hit the floor, and when I turned it over my chest locked tight.

It was Pop.

Not the frail, wasted figure I’d watched fade away this past year, but young and brutal. Built like a tank, a cigar clamped between his teeth. He wasn’t dressed for parade or patrol... he was dressed for war. Flak jacket, dive suit and web gear. Grenades were strapped to his chest like grim jewelry. And in his hands, a Browning Automatic Rifle like it belonged there.

But it wasn’t the Clay’s deck he was standing on. Or any destroyer for that matter. No... The lines of the vessel where this photo was taken were unmistakable even to me. For in the background rose the conning tower of a Balao-class submarine.

And standing beside him…

A man I didn’t know and yet recognition hit me like a wave. Shorter than Pop, leaner, but no less dangerous. His face was carved from stone, calm and calculating even in frozen sepia. The kind of man who could vanish in a phone booth and make you swear he’d never been there at all.

Mercer.

Ice floated behind them. 

It was real. The mystery song, the secret mission, that awful suicide... Some part of me was hoping for a gotcha moment, I guess. That I had misjudged Pop. That this was all just one last grim gag...

I don’t remember leaving the room. All I remember is the taste of bile clawing up my throat, my stomach trying to turn itself inside out. I staggered into the hall, gagging, and the next thing I knew I was on the floor.

That was when the first dream came.

I was floating in dim, frozen water. Sightless, breathless. The cold pressed into me from every angle, heavy as stone. My chest burned, lungs spasming, but no air came.

Out of the dark, a sound rose.

Singing.

Not muffled, not distorted by wave or distance... impossibly clear, carried through the water as if the ocean itself were a speaker. Every note was sharp as glass and sweet as honey. Beautiful and dreadful, like sweetened arsenic. 

And I was caught in it. Caught in a rolling tide of pain and ecstasy that tore through me in waves. Pleasure and agony, braided together so tightly they became the same thing. My soul was burning, freezing, shattering and all of it issued from that one, impossible voice.

Except it wasn't one voice. 

It was dozens. Hundreds.

All singing in impossibly perfect harmony. 

They rose all around me, threading together into a chorus that filled the sea and the marrow of my bones. They weren’t just singing to me... they were singing through me, dragging my pulse into their rhythm. My body vibrated with it, as if I’d become another instrument in their choir.

I spun in the water, thrashing for the source. 

And I saw.

Beneath me sprawled a city.


Ruins but not wreckage. A living place, improbably vast and improbably empty. Towers stretched upward in crooked majesty, their angles both perfect and impossible, mind-rending and magnificent all at once. Streets coiled like serpents, avenues widened into plazas that could have swallowed entire towns. It sprawled for miles, vanishing into a horizon of darkness.

And at its heart, a gate.

A massive stone arch, older than language, older than the sea itself. Eldritch and eternal. The moment my eyes touched it, I knew. If I crossed beneath that arch, I would never know the world of land and light again. I would be remade. Claimed by something horrid and wonderful.

It pulled at me with a gravity stronger than any current.

I kicked, fought, clawed at the water like a child drowning in a pool, but the tide was inevitable, and it was drawing me in.

And the voices changed. They became a chant and an exultation. 

I froze as the ancient gate cracked. Just a hairline split in the nothing of the water, and from it poured light as black as ink... thick and liquid, darkness so bright it burned my eyes.

What I glimpsed through that fracture would have claimed my mind if I could have but understood it. 

Something moved beyond the arch. Vast and wrong. Taller than any artificial construct or any mountain. No god could have made such a beast. Not one that loved the world of men.

Then, from the gap, it came.

A single tentacle, one strand of the monster’s beard, slid through, lashing out with impossible speed across the miles between me and that wicked and twisting gate. It wrapped around my leg, cold and slick, and began to pull.

I screamed and kicked, thrashing in vain as the city fell away beneath me and the gate loomed closer.

In desperation I opened my mouth, sucking water into my lungs, praying for the release of drowning.

But the sea betrayed me!

The water became air as it filled me. My chest expanded. My scream came out whole.

The beast would not even let me die! Its will was iron and I was to be his! 

Then there were hands on me, soft and comforting. But it was wrong! 

Wicked writhing things! 

The fingers curled too far, bending at joints no human bones should have. Skin that felt smooth at first touch rippled like fish scales beneath as I fought them. The hands cradled me the way a mother holds a struggling and frightened child, and for a heartbeat I wanted to believe in them. 

The song changed again...

The chorus swelled, too perfect, too harmonious, voices braided into a sound that was both lullaby and command.

'Be not afraid,' they said. Their words were not spoken but pressed directly into my mind, warm as breath against my ear. 'We will not harm you, beloved. He wants only to meet you.'

The hands stroked my face with a tenderness that made bile rise in my throat. I tried to wrench away, but their grip was gentle and unbreakable, a prison dressed as an embrace.

I jolted awake on the hospital hallway floor, convulsing. My stomach clenched and I heaved, a ragged scream tearing from my throat as seawater thick, and pure poured out of my mouth in choking gushes. It splattered across the linoleum, spreading into a slick, dark puddle.

Aria scrambled back from where she’d been cradling me, her hands lifting from my chest as though burned. Her eyes were wide, reflecting the harsh fluorescent lights.

“Eryk…” she whispered, voice thin with fear.

I wiped my mouth with a shaking sleeve, the salt sting clinging to my lips and tongue. My lungs felt raw, as if I’d truly drowned and been dragged back by something that didn’t want to let me go.

And in the echoes of my own retching, I swore I could still hear them, the voices, vocalizing faintly at the edge of hearing.

I wept into my hands. ""Stop... Stop. It's too much... I can't take it."" 

Aria rushed back to my side, and began humming softly, stroking my hair. Touching my shoulders. ""It's alright, Eryk. How can I help? Just tell me..."" 


I was scaring her and she was trying to help. That settled me, somehow. It's weird isn't it? The way people are sometimes? We can't handle things alone but we can be tougher, stronger for somebody else. 

I would have cried for hours if I had been alone on that floor, but in front of Aria and all these people I didn't want to be weak. I shoved the terror, the confusion, and the hurt down into a box somewhere inside. 

""I'm ok, I'm ok,"" I rasped, dragging air into my lungs as if it had to be mined from stone. ""I just... Today’s been too much. I want to go home.""

Aria’s arms slid around me, helping me to my feet, before the last word left my mouth. She didn’t flinch from the brackish stink. She just held me, tight and steady, her voice soft against my ear.
""I can take you home,"" she whispered. ""Let’s get you out of here.""

Over her shoulder, Grimsby crouched to retrieve the letter and the photograph, tucking them carefully into an evidence sleeve. His expression was unreadable for a moment, all shadows and bone angles, he examined the bile and expelled seawater then he gave me a look. 

Horrified curiosity is the only way to describe it. 

Weirdly, he didn't comment. He only straightened and gave me a nod.

""Sorry for putting you through that,” he said, tone clipped but not unkind. “I know it wasn’t easy. We’ll take it from here.”

The words should have sounded routine, a line from any case file, but in that moment I almost believed him. Almost.

“Just call me once you’re settled and we can talk this thing out once you’re stable, kid.” Grimsby held out a card. His hand didn’t waver. Mine did, just a little, when I took it.

Aria guided me out, her arm never leaving my back.

Home. 

God, I’d never been so glad for that word. 

Our place was a modest beachfront condo, third floor of a walk-up, sand-stained railings and all. It used to be a vacation rental before the owner passed away, then the place slipped onto the market. 

Aria and I had always dreamed of living by the ocean, and somehow, between her YouTube song covers, her Twitch streams, and my stubborn tapping at a keyboard, we made it happen.

When we pushed through the door, the familiar scent of sea salt and coffee grounds wrapped around me like a quilt. For the first time all day, my shoulders dropped. I could relax. 

I flopped onto the couch, half-tempted to let sleep take me. But the memory of that nightmare snapped me upright. I couldn’t risk sliding back into it. Instead I showered, and cleaned myself up, washing away the stink of the day. 

I slipped into another fugue state in the shower, letting the water just wash away all the horror from today, only getting jolted back to reality once it had turned frigid. I shuddered, praying that wouldn't keep happening. 

Outside, the storm had spent itself down to a lazy drizzle, rain tapping the glass in soft, steady rhythms. In the kitchen, Aria busied herself with dinner, our unspoken truce of trading off nights at the stove. The familiar clatter of pans was comfort enough.

I put on my slippers and housecoat and wandered out to the back deck. The sea air was sharp, and clean. No hint of rot or darkness to it. My coat, which was filthy from the days misadventures went over the far chair to air out.  From its pocket I drew Pop’s journal. I lowered myself into the chair opposite with a sigh, packed my pipe, and lit it. Smoke curled up into the wet air.

Then I opened the old sharkskin cover again, this time not as a grieving grandson, but as a man desperate for answers.

I (22F) am genuinely confused and hurt and need internet strangers to tell me if I’m being a terrible person.

So here’s the situation: I dated this guy. Let’s call him Jake (23M) for about 12 months. Really thought we had something special - he was sweet, we had great conversations, and honestly I was starting to think he might be “the one.” My best friend since high school, let’s call her Emma (22F), always hung out with us and I loved that my boyfriend and best friend got along so well.

About two months ago, Jake started acting distant. Less texting, canceling dates, seemed distracted when we were together. I asked Emma for advice since she knows Jake pretty well too, and she was like “maybe he’s just stressed with work” but seemed weird about it.

Then three weeks ago, I saw them together at a coffee shop across town when Jake had told me he was “too busy” to hang out. I confronted them both and Jake broke up with me on the spot, saying he’d “realized some things about himself” and that he and Emma had been “connecting on a deeper level.”

I was devastated. Emma tried to apologize but also defended it saying “we can’t help how we feel.” I told them both I needed space and blocked them temporarily because I was so hurt by the betrayal.

Here’s where it gets complicated: Yesterday, Jake texted me from a different number asking if we could talk. When we met up, he told me he’s gay. 

He said being with me made him realize he was forcing something that wasn’t authentic, and spending time with Emma helped him figure out he was attracted to her *brother* (who apparently has been visiting a lot lately). He said Emma was just being a supportive friend during his sexuality crisis, and there was never anything romantic between them - they were just planning how to help him come out.

He apologized for how he handled everything and said he should have been honest sooner instead of making it look like Emma “stole” him. Emma texted too saying she’s sorry for the secrecy but Jake asked her not to out him before he was ready.

Now here’s my dilemma: All my friends are saying I should congratulate Jake for coming out and that I’m being “homophobic” for still being upset. But like… I’m happy he figured himself out, but I’m still hurt about how it all went down? The secrecy, the lies, thinking my best friend betrayed me, the way he broke up with me in public…

Emma wants things to “go back to normal” and Jake wants to be friends again. Everyone’s acting like I should just be thrilled about his coming out journey and forget about how crappy the whole situation made me feel.

AITA for not being ready to congratulate him and for still feeling hurt about how this all played out? I’m not upset that he’s gay - I care that I was lied to for weeks and put through emotional hell thinking my best friend stabbed me in the back.

EDIT: Wow, thanks for all the responses. Some clarification since people are asking - Jake is now dating Emma’s brother and they seem really happy together. Given the seemingly hasty timeline, I’m feeling great pressure from Emma and Jake to come out in support of the new relationship so people don’t think too hard about the timelines, or else I’m “unconsciously homophobic.”",113,1755587121.0,AmItheAsshole,86,0.92,False

I told him and I didn’t really have any thoughts I was mostly shocked, after a few conversations he stated he didn’t want to be a father and I reluctantly agreed with him. I’m not sure why I did agree with him because I didn’t I just felt like I had to. I had to fly in to a major city to get the procedure done and had a friend come with me and when I got wheeled into the room I asked to see the ultrasound and my heart just sank I saw the tiny thing about 11 weeks he was so cute and I knew I wanted to run away because this was a mistake but within 20 seconds I was wheeled in and put under anathesia it all happened so fast and I really regret it, to this day. I just wanted to know if this is normal my current partner doesn’t want kids but this has plagued my mind for so long I’m still upset I did it.

(But I'd told the agent the previous day it was around 9 p.m.) So I told my colleagues I'd finish my work and head back to the office.

As I was about to leave, it started to rain heavily, like a sleet. After buying coffee, I went to hail a taxi. From a distance, I saw a woman with long braids in front of me. As I got closer, I noticed another woman in a white shirt. She told me the taxi we'd just stopped wasn't taking passengers, saying, ""Five people can't fit in a four-seater car."" The rain intensified, so the three of us stepped into a small shelter. The woman in the white shirt said, ""You can definitely report the driver."" I replied, ""He's just a jerk."" The woman with the long braids looked at us and said nothing. The woman in the white shirt asked, ""Would it be faster for them to take the bus? I don't even know where they are. I was just passing by on my way to go swimming, so I wanted to help them."" I looked around, but there were no other passengers (there should have been four more).

Another round of traffic passed, and no cars stopped. The girl with long braids looked at me and said in English, ""Can I call the police?"" I asked, ""Why?"" She turned her phone screen over, and I saw a lucky phrase on the wallpaper in simplified Chinese. She continued in English, ""Because we are late for our flight."" She didn't hesitate, which I found quite unexpected. I looked at the woman in the white shirt and said, ""She said she'd call the police."" The woman also looked puzzled.

I decided to leave and take the subway instead. I walked a few steps to the left, trying to see where the other four passengers were, but all the way to the end of the street, I didn't see any of the four people who looked like passengers/tourists.",1,1755586662.0,randomstories,0,1.0,False

I started late in life because well life happened. I work really well with special needs children and children generally like and receive me pretty well.  

I started at a new school district coming out of my non public teacher aide position for at risk youth. They were emotionally disturbed children.  From the very beginning, I've noticed the teacher I am working with as a para for TK has favored her morning aides. She makes comments such as my morning aides are trained, and I really only need my morning aides. my morning aides are awesome. My morning aides bring me coffee, and I appreciate it.  She has also implied that her morning aides are educated. Now we had a meeting at the beginning and everyone said what it is they do,  education level and training level. Of everyone, I have the most education and experience. I've watched her morning aides when we all had to come in on minimum day, and honestly, all they do is fool around with her gossiping and yell at children to sit down and be quiet. One is a man para, and honestly, he can be scary when he yells at them.  Not that all men paras are scary, but this one is. 

My problem isn't so much that she favors them. My problem is that she says these things in front of other people, parents and teachers.  Like she is trying to demean me, and I don't know why.  I've done nothing but try to assist her.. should I ask her what I'm doing wrong? I honestly don't want to work with her anymore. But I don't want to quit the district either.  Any advice. Am I just being sensitive? Should I not care and just do my job and ignore her? We are in a group chat, and she will text things to us, and if the morning aides responds, she will like or heart their response, and I go left unnoticed.

Naturally I get the fuck on. I've visited many cities in Bosnia in the last decade, and have enjoyed every one, from Livno to Maglaj.

I took this trip without making any reservations, and barely packing a bag, because Bosnia always provides.

I considered hopping off the bus in Doboj, where I've never been, but I wanted to return to Sarajevo, and see it healing. So I stayed a while longer, and partied with the others on the bus.

i get off the bus, change some moneys, and head to the train station. No trains seem to be running, which makes me sad, but the station is still open, I can drink some good coffee, and it's great to check out the empty platforms. I hope they start going again soon.

I need a tram to Bascarsija, and ridiculously, a 130 year old tram shows up. It was some celebration of the history of the network. I'm stoked, I get to take what is probably the world's oldest operating tram into town. Things that used to be broken are now being fixed. I see Festina Lente bridge, clearly the greatest bridge ever designed, and I feel like I wanna move here.

Anyway. Talked to some randoms, they set me up with accommodation, even during peak tourist season. Turn on the TV, see tourists flocking to Bosnia. Protests in Serbia. I eat, I drink, I see Palestinian flags. I meet some cool people. I can just chill. WTF is gonna go wrong?

Worst thing that happened: I don't use a phone, only a computer. And my computer is old, uses a really obscure power adapter thing. Part of this adapter broke on the bus. This troubles me, but not too much, because Bosnia provides.

I head to SCC, find no computer shop. Head across the street to the other big mall. Nothing there either, but the awesome guys at the quasi-apple store make some calls for me. Turns out there is a Lenovo store in SCC, it's just in the underground level, which I didn't realize even existed. (If you don't speak Bosnian and don't use the lift, there's basically no way of knowing it's there).

So, head down there, but guy doesn't have what I need. So he calls some colleagues, and gives me a list of places to try. Note that in W\*stern Europe, nobody would give a shit, and nobody would offer to help, unless it was gonna make them money. But now I've got a list. So I walk from one to the other. I have no computer and no phone, so I need to ask for directions each time, but it's cool, because Bosnia provides. People happily direct me, and ask where I'm from. But no luck.

Last place on the list, Merkator, Ask some guys for directions, and they ask ""why the fuck you wanna go there, man?"". 36 degrees later, I arrive, and this shop is actually just a shitty little kiosk. But because Bosnia provides, the guy had a universal adapter,  which I'm literally using right now. Costs half what it would in the W\*st.

After some great experiences I made it back ""home"" safe. But home is lame and boring and full of unfriendly people and Bosnia is literally the greatest nation in the world.

1muaxuz,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1muaxuz/i_just_wanted_to_eat_snacks_while_using_my/,I just wanted to eat snacks while using my computer,"I just wanted to eat snacks while using my computer.  
That was the starting point. Not some grand vision for the future of productivity, just me, a bag of chips, and not wanting to smear my keyboard with crumbs.

For years I relied on shortcuts. App launchers, window managers, clever hotkeys — they all felt like a secret layer of power. I could open anything, move windows, control media, all without touching the mouse. It was smooth and efficient… until my hands were covered in chip dust.

That’s when I realized something important: efficiency tools are usually designed for the “ideal” scenario. Two clean hands, full focus, no distractions. But real life is messy. One hand is holding food, the other is holding coffee, and suddenly your so-called “efficient workflow” doesn’t feel efficient at all.

So I tried gestures.

* ✊ Play / Pause
* 👉 / 👈 Volume up / down
* ✋ Switch screens
* 👍 Fullscreen

It wasn’t about speed records. It was about **removing friction in the moment**. And for that context — working while snacking — gestures worked beautifully. No keyboard, no crumbs, no pause in flow.

Of course, I’ll be honest: it’s still rough. Recognition fires too often, and the usability isn’t polished enough for me to feel good about releasing it widely. That’s why I pulled the public download and set up a waitlist instead. I’d rather improve it before asking people to really use it. (If anyone’s curious, I can drop the link in the comments.)

But the bigger lesson for me is this: productivity tools follow a cycle.

* At first they feel magical.
* Then they normalize.
* Eventually, they become friction themselves.

Shortcuts once felt revolutionary. Now they sometimes feel like overhead. Gestures feel magical right now, but I know they’ll have their limits too.

Looking forward, I can see productivity expanding into different input modes:

* **Voice** — natural, quick, great when hands are busy.
* **Eye-tracking** — fluid, context-aware, almost invisible once it works well.
* **Gestures** — casual, physical, perfect when you don’t want to touch anything.

Maybe one day we’ll combine all of them, switching seamlessly depending on context. Productivity won’t just be about finding the “fastest” tool, but about matching the right tool to the right moment — whether that moment is deep work, multitasking, or just eating snacks at your desk.

For now, I’ll keep waving at my computer. And maybe that’s the fun of it: laziness and small annoyances often push us into exploring the future before we even realize it.",3,1755585641.0,SaaS,2,1.0,False

## What is Helder Kredix?

Helder Kredix is basically an **automated trading platform** aimed at helping everyday folks jump into the world of crypto and financial markets without needing to be expert traders. Think of it like having a digital assistant that monitors trends, executes trades, and (theoretically) increases your earnings potential using smart algorithms.

The platform uses **AI-driven software** that follows market signals in real-time and places trades based on pre-set parameters. This means it can potentially buy low and sell high while you’re doing something else—like working your 9-5 or binge-watching Netflix.

## Who Created Helder Kredix?

Here’s where things get a bit vague. The creators of Helder Kredix aren't exactly front and center. There’s no Elon Musk-style figure tweeting about it, and the dev team stays behind the curtain. That’s pretty standard for platforms like this—**Bitcoin Era** and similar tools also keep their creators anonymous.

What we do know is that Helder Kredix claims to be developed by a team of fintech and crypto professionals with experience in **machine learning**, **blockchain**, and **financial analytics**. While the lack of transparency may raise some eyebrows, it’s not a deal-breaker if the platform performs well and users are getting results.

## How Does Helder Kredix Work?

Okay, let’s break it down simply. Helder Kredix works by using **automated trading algorithms** that analyze the market 24/7. You sign up, deposit funds, set your trading preferences (like risk level, trade amount, etc.), and the bot takes over from there.

The AI constantly scans the market for profitable opportunities, executes trades, and (hopefully) grows your balance. You can monitor everything through your dashboard, and in most cases, you can switch to manual mode if you want more control.

Here’s a basic workflow:
- Analyze market trends using AI
- Execute trades automatically
- Monitor performance from your dashboard
- Withdraw profits when ready

It’s designed to be **set-and-forget** for beginners, but also offers enough customization for advanced users to tweak strategies.

## Helder Kredix Pros and Cons

Let’s be real—no platform is perfect. Here’s my honest take:

**Pros:**
- ✅ Easy for beginners to use
- ✅ Real-time trading updates
- ✅ Supports multiple asset types, not just crypto
- ✅ Fast withdrawals (1–2 days in most cases)
- ✅ Good balance of automation and manual control

**Cons:**
- ❌ Limited transparency about founders
- ❌ Still relatively new and not heavily documented
- ❌ Requires minimum $250 deposit up front

This is the big question, right? From what I’ve seen and experienced so far, **Helder Kredix doesn’t appear to be a scam**. It works as advertised, processes withdrawals, and has decent support. But let’s be real—automated trading always comes with risks.

There’s no guarantee of profits, and markets are volatile. That said, I didn’t see any red flags like shady withdrawal policies or fake testimonials. Just be cautious, do your own research, and **only invest what you can afford to lose**.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Helder Kredix?

The minimum deposit is **$250**, which is pretty standard for platforms like this. That gives the algorithm enough capital to start making trades. It’s not free, but it’s not outrageous either. Just make sure you’re comfortable with that amount before diving in.

Support is available via:
- **Live chat** (during business hours)
- **Email** (24/7)

In my test, I got a response within a few hours via email, and live chat was actually helpful—not just a bot. That said, support isn’t instantaneous, so patience is key.

## What is Vortion Platform?

Vortion Platform is a **web-based automated trading platform** designed to simplify the process of trading cryptocurrencies, forex, stocks, and commodities. It uses **algorithmic trading strategies** and real-time market data to help users make informed decisions—or let the system do it for them.

It’s made for both newbies and seasoned traders, which is pretty rare. You can either let the platform **auto-trade based on its algorithms** or go full manual and do your own thing. The idea is to take out the complicated backend of trading and give you an intuitive, efficient tool to make money smarter—not harder.

For context, I (24, F) and my friend (24, F) speak very candidly and very open-minded kami, and we're open to have more liberal discussions. And this post is not an avenue to shame sugar babies or ano man.

My friend and I met up at a cafe after work (we work at diff companies). Ako mag-isa lang, but she brought a friend (F) along with her, bagong kawork daw na siya ang nagtetrain. Hinayaan ko nalang din kasi wala naman masama sa meeting new people.

As we were eating, nagchichikahan kami ng friend ko, and she showed me a new bag na binili ng jowa niya na from US. I said something along the lines of 'ikaw ha, last week lang new sneakers tsaka airpods binigay sayo. last month bagong iphone. everyday ka pa halos may pa coffee. very sugar baby ang atake mo ha'. This wasn't the first time din na nasabi ko yun sa kaniya, although in the past ay sa more worried context ko sinabi sa kaniya yun nung bago palang sila ng jowa niya. Pero nung sinabi ko recently a more sa joking side ako, dahil honestly malaki na siya and kung ano man trip niya, bahala na siya dun.

Anyway, ayon I didn't mean it in a negative way. Pero itong si new friend eh parang nagiba ang trato sakin, may times pa na nahuhuli ko siya na parang ang sama ng tingin sakin. Then this morning, nakachat ko friend ko and naopen ko yung friend niya. And turns out since nung nagmeet kami eh binabash na ako nung new friend niya. Kesyo daw ang sama daw ng ugali ko kasi tinawag ko yung friend ko na pakarat (NEVER SAID THAT BTW). Na dinidisrespect ko daw rs niya ng jowa niya. Na baka daw ang totoong tingin ko sa kanya eh palagamit ng tao.

Syempre ako naman, I denied immediately. Kasi first, wala ako strong opinions abt sugar babies or ano man. Second, lahat ng jokes namin alam ng friend ko ang pinanggalingan. Third, she was just putting words in my mouth. Lastly, it feels like pinoproject niya yung own thoughts niya sa akin and covering that up with fake wokeness. 

I also feel like I have to say na my frien dand I laughed nung sinabi ko yun, and she assured me naman na gets niya daw sinasabi ko and alam niya na di ko naisip yung ganon tungkol sa kaniya.

Pero ayon, I still feel guilty kasi parang ang ending naiipit yung friend ko. Mali ba na nagjoke ako ng ganon sa harap ng d namin kaclose? Or mali lang ba talaga sinabi ko?

I was a bit disappointed as I would have like to go although I was working midnights. (I expressed that and we moved on). The plan was to have her stop at my work and put the items in my car to avoid duty. 

They finishing shopping and only spend 50$ therefore she decided to not stop at my work. She ended up going to chipotle for dinner. I ask her what she got for me and she replies with a 1/2 eaten bowl. I thought she was joking at first. I let it go. On the way home she drove within 1 min of my work. She ended up not getting me anything at all and drove right past me. 

I really thought stopping in to say hi, bringing a coffee or offering to pick me up something to eat would be a thoughtful and caring thing to do. She said I was being unrealistic and unfair ",1,1755585271.0,AmIOverreacting,2,0.67,False
1muatyk,https://i.redd.it/66jyla347xjf1.png,Decade-Long Market Cap Dynamics in Consumer Staples: Coca-Cola vs. PepsiCo (2015–2025),"[Coca-Cola market capitalization](https://www.marketcapwatch.com/company/coca-cola-marketcap) grew from $186.8 billion in 2015 to $297.5 billion this year, a 1.59× increase and a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.76 percent. During the same period, [PepsiCo Inc.’s valuation](https://www.marketcapwatch.com/company/pepsico-marketcap) rose from $145.6 billion to $204.8 billion, marking a 1.41× gain at a 3.47 percent CAGR.

Coca-Cola’s stronger performance reflects a series of strategic initiatives. The global rollout of Coke Zero Sugar and limited-edition flavor launches reinvigorated core sales. Acquisitions such as Costa Coffee added high-margin revenue streams, while an aggressive share-repurchase program boosted per-share metrics.

PepsiCo’s decade of growth was driven by its balanced beverage-and-snack portfolio. Recovery in food-service channels since the pandemic supported volume gains. However, currency headwinds in emerging-market operations and a more diversified cost base weighed on overall valuation expansion.

Analysts note the resilience of consumer staples in a low-growth, high-inflation environment. Both companies passed higher input costs to consumers without eroding margin profiles. Meanwhile, rising interest rates compressed sector-wide valuation multiples, but robust free-cash-flow generation provided a valuation floor.

Looking ahead, investors will watch how sustainability commitments and digital-commerce investments translate into future market-cap growth. Emerging-market penetration and health-and-wellness trends may reshape revenue mix and valuation drivers for both beverage giants.",1,1755585244.0,economy,1,1.0,False

1muasa7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1muasa7/on_the_other_side_pt1/,On The Other Side PT.1,"
The bathroom mirror was a severe judge. It's cheap, with a plastic frame that held a sheet of glass that seemed to highlight every flaw. The paint on the wall behind it, a dull, off-white, was chipped in places, with small flakes stubbornly clinging to the edges like dry, peeling skin.


  I splashed cold water onto my face, the sudden shock doing little to clear the persistent fogginess that clung to my thoughts, a haze that seemed to have settled permanently behind my eyes.
  

  My reflection, a gaunt, unremarkable man with perpetually tired eyes and hair that always looked slightly disheveled, stared back. I lifted my left hand, poised over the basin, fingers splayed. My reflection mirrored the movement, but then, a flicker—a subtle, almost unnoticeable hesitation. My hand completed its arc, but the reflection’s hand seemed to stutter, a fractional beat behind, like a poorly synced video playing on a cheap screen.


  A cold prick, like a tiny insect crawling, prickled the back of my neck. I froze, my breath catching in my throat. I blinked hard, then rubbed the sleep from my eyes with enough force to make them water.


  Fatigue, I reasoned, was simply a byproduct of another restless night spent staring at the ceiling, chasing the faint hum of the refrigerator or the distant drone of motorway traffic, anything to distract from the louder, more unsettling hum of my anxieties. I tried again, this time more slowly, deliberately raising my right hand. The reflection, now, was perfectly synchronized. Just tired, I told myself, a whisper of a lie I repeated often, a desperate attempt to explain away the unsettling occurrence. But the unease lingered, a faint, sour taste in my mouth, like yesterday’s coffee.


  My apartment, a rental I’d found online in a rush a year ago, was less a home and more a temporary stopping point. It was a monument to the plain and uninspired, a testament to a life lived on the sidelines, carefully avoiding any real connection or emotional investment.


  The living room, a sparse space painted a dull beige, held a perpetually dusty sofa that had long lost its shape, sinking inward as if tired of existence. Across from it, a small, old television sat on a wobbly stand, feeling more like a piece of unused furniture than a source of entertainment; I rarely bothered to turn it on.


  The windows, thick with a fine layer of urban dust that seemed to laugh at my half-hearted attempts to clean them, filtered the already weak morning sun into an everlasting twilight, casting long, dull shadows across the thin, worn carpet.


  There were no personal touches. No framed photos on the walls, no bright cushions on the sofa, no stacks of well-loved books on the cheap, imitation-wood coffee table. My few belongings, a couple of faded T-shirts, worn jeans, and a scattering of unopened mail, were hidden away in drawers or closets, as if even they were too personal to be openly displayed. Each room merged into the next with the same oppressive sameness, the same faint scent of stale air and disuse, proof of a life I merely inhabited rather than truly lived.


  The morning commute was a daily assault on my senses. The constant blare of car horns, the choking exhaust fumes from older vehicles, the frantic weaving of traffic, it was a chaotic symphony, a fitting warm-up for the noise and tension awaiting me at the warehouse.


  My workplace, a vast, echoing space filled with the endless clatter of forklifts and the drone of conveyor belts, felt as impersonal and draining as my apartment. Conner, my boss, was already in full swing when I clocked in, a deep red flush creeping up his neck as he waved a stack of delivery manifests in my direction.


  Conner was a man built like a fire hydrant, broad-shouldered and solid, with a permanent frown etched into his face from years of frustration. His voice, a low, rumbling bellow, could cut through the loud hum of the machinery and make even the toughest guys flinch.


  ""Dayton, are you even paying attention?"" he barked, his words slicing through the industrial noise like a sharp knife. ""This isn't rocket science! Pallet number seven, you put it on the wrong truck! Do you even look at what you’re doing, or do you just wander around like a zombie?""


  I mumbled an apology, my shoulders dropping automatically in a practiced gesture of surrender. It was always something with Conner— a misplaced item, a form filled out incorrectly, a minute too long on a break. Each small mistake, no matter how trivial, was blown out of proportion under his unforgiving gaze, turned into a serious offence. My previous attempts to explain myself, to quietly defend my actions, had long since faded into silence. It was easier, I had learned, to accept the blows, to let his anger wash over me like a toxic wave. Confrontation made my stomach knot up, leaving me trembling and unable to speak. It’s a weakness I despise in myself, but one I seem utterly unable to overcome.


  As he continued his rant, his face twisting with what looked like fake anger, little bits of spit flying into the air around him, I heard it. A faint whisper, like dry leaves scraping across hot pavement on a windless day, just at the edge of my hearing.


  It was unsettling, a low murmur that sent a fresh shiver down my spine, colder than any morning breeze. The words were a jumble, an unintelligible heap of words, but the tone was undeniably chilling, carrying a hint of something ancient and slightly malevolent.


  I flinched, my head snapping up, my eyes darting around the cavernous warehouse floor. Was it just the machines, the echoes bouncing off the high ceiling? Was I imagining things? Conner paused, mid-sentence, his face hardened, his eyes narrowed suspiciously. ""What was that, Dayton? You got something to say now? Something smart to add to this mess you made?""


  ""No, sir. Just... sorry,"" I stammered, my voice barely a whisper, my throat suddenly dry. He grunted, a dismissive sound, turning back to the manifests, his attention already shifting to the next potential problem.


  I grabbed the chance, moving past him, a sudden, desperate urge to escape the sound, to find a quiet corner where the phantom whisper couldn't reach me.


  My heart hammered against my ribs, a frantic drumbeat of unexplained fear. It's just stress, I told myself, more like a prayer than a declaration. The pressure of work. That's all it is.


  The rest of the workday passed in a daze of forced focus. Every clang of metal, every distant voice, every hum of machinery seemed to carry the possibility for that chilling whisper to return. I kept my head down, trying to become invisible.


  I ate my lunch alone in the break room, picking at a cold sandwich, acutely aware of the hushed conversations of my colleagues, imagining their hushed judgments, their complaints about my slowness, my perceived incompetence.


  My isolation, usually a strange comfort, now felt like a heavy burden, a vast, empty space into which I might disappear entirely.
By the time I drove my old, sputtering sedan through the busy evening traffic and unlocked the familiar, uninviting door of my apartment, exhaustion had settled deep in my bones, heavier than any physical labor.


  My muscles ached, but it was the dull throb behind my eyes, the persistent buzzing in my ears, and the tightening knot in my stomach that honestly wore me down. The drab living room, usually a comfort in dullness, felt strangely suffocating tonight. A thick, unseen weight seemed to press down on the air, making each breath feel shallow and complex.


  My steps led me, almost without thinking, towards the bathroom for some reason. I pushed the door open cautiously, my hand hovering on the knob as if expecting something to jump out and devour me.


  There was nothing there, and the mirror, thankfully, looked normal. Its chipped edges, which usually irritated me, now felt like it was mocking me. But the memory of that stuttering reflection this morning, plus the ominous whisper at work, clung to me.


  Then all of a sudden, intense fear bloomed in my chest, a cold, spreading dread that made my skin crawl. I couldn't explain it, couldn't put into words the vague eeriness that had taken root, but I knew, with a certainty that chilled me to the core, that I couldn't leave that mirror uncovered tonight, but Icouldn’t explain why.


  I fumbled through the small linen closet, my fingers brushing against stiff, unused towels, finally pulling out a faded, moth-eaten blanket, a leftover from a previous tenant, forgotten and unwanted, much like myself. With trembling hands, I draped it over the mirror, the thin fabric a flimsy barrier, a poor excuse for a shield.


  I carefully tucked the edges behind the frame, trying to make sure it was covered entirely, hoping its worn weave would truly deter whatever unseen presence I now imagined.
I left the bathroom light on for the first time. It made me feel childish, but it felt like the right thing to do.


  Sleep, when it finally arrived, was a broken jumble of shadows and half-formed fears. The blanketed mirror, even though covered, seemed to loom in my mind, a dark, pulsing portal to unknown terrors.


  In the dream, I found myself standing before it, though the blanket was gone, and the glass shimmered with an eerie light. And there, for the very first time, I saw her.


  She stood behind the shimmering, translucent barrier of the mirror, her silhouette faint but distinct. Her face was etched with a profound despair, lines of sorrow radiating from her eyes, pulling down the corners of her mouth. Her gaze, wide and full of an aching sadness, was fixed on something just beyond my sight, as if pleading with a hidden observer. Her hands, pale and slender, pressed against an unseen wall, yearning for an escape, her fingers spread, as if trying to claw her way through an invisible membrane.


  She looked lost, utterly trapped, a prisoner in a glass cage. I was suddenly filled with a great sense of pity, even in the depths of my uneasy slumber.


  Her silence was more chilling than it would have been if she were screaming or yelling at me, and her stillness more terrifying than any frantic movement. I watched her, transfixed, a bystander to agony.


  The dream felt too real. And I was unaware that I had unconsciously made my first connection to the other side.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The morning sun, still a weak filter through my grimy apartment windows, felt colder than usual. I pulled the blanket from the bathroom mirror, the flimsy fabric offering no comfort now. The glass stared back, blank and still, but the chilling memory of the dream, of the woman’s trapped face, lingered like a faint scent in the air.


  I splashed water on my face again, hoping to wash away the lingering unease, but it clung stubbornly to my thoughts. The faint hum of the refrigerator seemed louder than usual, a constant, low thrum against the fragile quiet of my apartment.


  Work the next day was a repeat of the last, only amplified. The warehouse air felt thick and heavy, each breath a struggle. Conner was on me again, this time about my bathroom breaks.
""Dayton, are you taking a nap in there? Breaks are for five minutes, not fifty! We’re not paying you to meditate in the john, Winslow. We got product to move!"" His voice, irritating, scraped at my already frayed nerves. My feelings of inadequacy, a familiar ache that had lived inside me for as long as I could remember, began to swell, threatening to burst.


  Each word from Conner felt like a physical blow, shrinking me further, making me feel smaller and more useless.


  I retreated to the break room, needing a moment away from Conner's relentless gaze. A couple of my coworkers, Mike and Sarah, offered sympathetic glances. Mike, a burly guy with a kind smile, clapped me on the shoulder. ""Don't mind, Conner, Dayton. He's just a grump on Wednesdays. Happens to everyone."" Sarah, quieter, just offered a slight, knowing nod. Their gestures were kind, but they did little to soothe the sting of Conner's words. I forced a weak smile, mumbled a thank you, and went to grab a paper cup for some lukewarm coffee from the machine.


  As I poured the bitter liquid, their voices, normally a background murmur, drifted to me from behind the snack machine, hushed but clear. ""Honestly, he’s so slow,"" Joanna’s voice, sharp and thin, cut through the low hum of the vending machine.


  Joanna was Conner's right-hand woman, always hovering, always whispering in his ear. She had a tight, almost permanent smile that never reached her eyes, which were often narrowed, observing everyone with a calculating gaze.


  ""And honestly, the way he skips steps on the packing line… almost cost us a client last week,"" Mike mumbled something I couldn't quite catch, but Sarah’s voice was unmistakable. ""Yeah, he’s got no hustle. Conner's right to be on him. Everyone else pulls their weight.""


  My hand tightened around the flimsy paper cup, nearly crushing it. The coffee sloshed over my fingers, but I barely felt the warmth. Skipping steps? Hustle? They did the same things.


  Mike forgot to double-check pallet numbers all the time. Sarah often came in late after her lunch break. The blatant hypocrisy, the casual betrayal in their voices, burned hotter than any coffee spill. It wasn't just Conner, then. It was them too. All of them. The injustice of it all, the feeling of being judged and talked about behind my back for the very things others got away with, twisted my stomach into a hard, cold knot.


  I couldn't stand it anymore. The stale air of the break room suddenly felt suffocating. I needed to get away, to find a place where I wasn't being watched, where I couldn't hear their whispers. I retreated to the bathroom, the only place I felt I could truly breathe in this entire building.


  The cool tiles offered little comfort against the burning shame in my cheeks. I splashed cold water on my face, again, as if trying to wash away the feeling of being exposed, of being found wanting.


  The stale air in the bathroom pressed in on me, making my skin prickle. The fluorescent lights hummed with a low, constant buzz, highlighting every speck of dust on the grimy floor. I looked into the mirror above the sink. My reflection stared back, my eyes wide, pupils slightly dilated with a fear I couldn’t quite name.


  And then, a prickle at the back of my neck. That familiar, chilling sensation, as if eyes were boring into me from the other side of the glass. I glanced around the empty bathroom, but there was nothing, no one. Still, the feeling persisted, an intense, unsettling awareness of being watched, an invisible gaze pressing against my back, just from beyond the reflective surface. I hurried through the rest of my break, eager to leave the unsettling stillness behind.


  Back home, after a long, hot shower, the steam filled my small bathroom, fogging the mirror. I reached for my towel, my hand brushing against the misty glass. A distinct handprint was there, perfectly formed against the condensation.


  It was clearly a man's hand, large and with thick fingers, a perfect match for my own. I assumed it was mine, a simple condensation mark from when I'd reached for the soap or the shower knob.


  But as I went to wipe it away with my towel, it wouldn’t budge. My towel slid over the glass, the handprint stubbornly remaining, as if it were a stain. I pressed harder, then harder still, scrubbing at it, but it was fixed, unmoving, mocking my efforts.


  My breath quickened. A cold dread, far more potent than the unease from the morning, seeped into my bones.


  This was different. This wasn't fatigue. This wasn't stress. This was something else entirely. I pulled my hand away from the mirror, slowly, as if afraid it might bite. As I stepped back, my eyes fixed on the unchanging handprint, a faint mist began to gather on the mirror, blooming from the center outwards. It wasn't just the steam from the shower now. This was fresh condensation, forming rapidly, like someone was breathing directly onto the glass from behind it, a slow, deliberate puff of warm air.


  A wave of intense cold washed over me, despite the residual warmth from the shower. It was the kind of chill that settled deep inside, making my teeth ache. Every hair on my arms stood on end. My mind screamed at me to run, to get away.


  Without thinking, I pivoted on my heel and slammed the bathroom door shut, the sound echoing through the silent apartment like a gunshot. The flimsy wood vibrated under my hand, a poor barrier against the fear that now gnawed at me.


  That night, sleep was a battle I was losing. The memory of the handprint, the strange, breathing mist, and the trapped woman from my dream swirled in my head. I lay in bed, staring at the dimly lit ceiling, listening. The apartment was quiet, quieter than usual.


  Then, from the direction of the bathroom, I heard it. A faint murmur. Not the sharp whisper from work, but a low, indistinct mumbling, like someone talking to themselves just beyond a closed door. Then, a distinct voice, soft but clear, speaking words I couldn't quite make out, but undeniably there, coming from the other side of the mirror. It continued, off and on, a quiet, unsettling presence that turned the silence of my apartment into a living, breathing thing. I pulled the blankets up to my chin, my body rigid, wishing for the dawn.

The beginning: Back in May i was having stomach/chest pain and urge to burp but i was not able to. Also stomach burn and some of the liquid from stomach coming up. The symptoms lasted for 2 weeks which i saw a doctor who prescribed stomach protector (aka PPI) without endoscopy since i had a bussiness trip the next day. i took the pills for 3 weeks. Symtomps didnt go away so i went to the doctor one more time this time for endoscopy.

Right after the endoscopy he gave me another PPI, different brand. My results come in and i dont have H.Pylori but the entire surface of  my stomach is inflamated, reddish. The exact description is called erythematous pangastria, according to translate.

Anyways the doctor was not the best so he didnt give me any further info or meds to move forward so i started drinking a little milk in the morning which was way better than the PPI’s and almost all the symptoms went away…. Except, the GAS… (i have no problem with lactose btw)

Its been 3 months which i am constantly burping and god they are not small burps. I release gas for couple of seconds, back to back, non stop, all day long.

I am a smoker (which i took some weeks break, no avail) and used to drink beers on weekend which i also stopped, i just go with some whisky on weekends now. Dont drink soda, soft drinks, i cook at home mostly rice, pasta, chicken, beef and salad with no souce or spice. Just yogurt on the side. I dont eat fast food or packaged stuff. Only boiled eggs and a banana and drip coffee in the morning as breakfast.

But constantly burp, hundreds of times a day… with a little stomach burn right after meals but they dont last long. 

I couldnt find any solution for months and its giving me hard time at work and at the gym.

Any advice on that is appreciated since i am fed up with this and i have never had any problems with my stomach in the past (31 years)

## What is Immediate Rudo2U?

**Immediate Rudo2U** is an automated trading platform designed to help users trade crypto and other financial assets with minimal manual effort. It uses algorithms and real-time market data to execute trades on your behalf. Think of it as a smart assistant that watches the markets 24/7 and acts based on set parameters or signals.

But it’s not just for crypto. One thing I found pretty cool is that it also supports **forex, commodities, and even stock indices**, which makes it more versatile than many other platforms I’ve used. Whether you’re just starting out or looking to automate part of your trading strategy, it seems like Immediate Rudo2U is built to make things easier.

## Who Created Immediate Rudo2U?

There’s a bit of mystery around the actual creators of Immediate Rudo2U, which is pretty common in this space. What I gathered is that it was developed by a team of **financial analysts and software engineers** who have experience with similar platforms like Bitcoin Code and Immediate Edge.

The creators claim to have designed the platform to bridge the gap between powerful trading tools and user-friendly design, especially for newcomers. So, while there’s no celebrity endorsement or Elon Musk connection (thankfully), it looks like the team behind it knows their stuff.

## How Does Immediate Rudo2U Work?

At its core, Immediate Rudo2U runs on a **trading algorithm** that scans market trends and executes trades based on pre-programmed strategies. You can set your risk level, asset preferences, and other parameters, then let the bot do the work.

Here’s how it rolls:

- First, you sign up and fund your account (minimum $250).
- Then, you either switch to demo mode to test things out or jump straight into live trading.
- The AI bot starts analyzing market signals in real time and places trades automatically.
- You can monitor everything in the dashboard and tweak settings any time.

It’s not magic, but it’s pretty close to autopilot. That said, **you still need to keep an eye on it**—markets are volatile, and even the smartest bots can’t predict black swan events.

## Immediate Rudo2U Pros and Cons

Let’s break it down with the good and the not-so-great:

**Pros:**

- ✅ **Beginner-friendly** with a smooth interface
- ✅ **Supports multiple asset classes** beyond crypto
- ✅ **Fast account setup** and easy funding process
- ✅ **Demo account** to test before going live
- ✅ **Customizable trading settings** for more control
- ✅ **Responsive customer support**

**Cons:**

- ❌ **No mobile app** (yet), only browser-based
- ❌ **Lack of transparency** about the development team
- ❌ **Risk of loss**—same as with any trading platform
- ❌ **Not available in all regions**

Overall, the pros outweigh the cons, but it’s important to manage your expectations and not treat it like a guaranteed money-making machine.

## Immediate Rudo2U – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

One of the standout features is its **real-time data feed and analysis engine**. The trading bot scans thousands of data points per second to identify profitable trades. It’s like having a Wall Street analyst in your pocket—minus the suit and caffeine addiction.

- ✅ It uses **SSL encryption** to protect user data.
- ✅ Funds are held in **partner broker accounts** that are regulated.
- ✅ Customer support actually responds (shocking, I know).

That said, **trading is risky**. You can lose money. The platform is legit, but it doesn’t guarantee profits.

The minimum deposit to activate your account is **$250**. This is pretty standard among trading bots and gives the platform enough liquidity to start placing trades.
