We’ve been through a lot, but the biggest strain on our relationship was the death of my father in 2021. It was extremely unexpected. He had a massive heart attack out of no where. At the time of his passing he lived about 2 hours away from me, and I didn’t have a car. I had been in a bad accident the year prior and was too afraid to drive. He was my only means of transportation as his car is a manual and I couldn’t drive it myself even if I was brave enough. We drove back and forth 3 times to make his arrangements, clean his rental house out and host his memorial service. His memorial service was 11 days after his passing as I had to wait for his ashes to return. My dad was my only active parent. My mother was never involved in my life. He did everything a mother and father should do for me. I was devastated. I still am. On the way home from his memorial service my husband looked at me and asked “so like are you going to keep crying all day or at least make an effort to be okay?” And he played his game the rest of the night when we got home while I cried in silence in our bed. He’s not good at providing emotional support for situations he’s never felt. Today is the 3rd anniversary of my dad’s passing. He held me last night and told me he would understand if I was upset today. That I didn’t have to try and be happy. It was okay. I’m not okay today. I’m sad. I cried. I asked him to make me coffee this morning so I could stay in bed a bit longer and he said “don’t know how. Sorry” and closed the door. He has been very cold and distant all day. I paused and asked him “not in an attempt to fight, but because you don’t know my needs if I don’t ask. I’m telling you I need you to be nicer to me today than you are and asking you to try and be” and he went on a rant about how much he hates today. How much he hates how I act today. How he can’t stand that I lose my shit on this day every year. That he’s sick of hearing about him and dealing with this day. It hurt me so bad. He’s supposed to be person. I should be able to let my guard down and express my true emotions around him. I don’t mean to inconvenience him on this day. I don’t want to be alone today, but I don’t have someone other than him that I feel comfortable crying around. I don’t want to make him feel bad by telling him he’s not supportive enough. I don’t want to make him feel like he’s falling short as my significant other, but I don’t know how to tell him I need him to be more supportive and patient on this one day of the year. It’s the only day I allow myself to fall apart if I need to. Not Father’s Day, not his birthday, not a random Thursday. Just today. How do I talk to him about this without making him feel bad?

1hjhxjq,https://www.reddit.com/r/thelongdark/comments/1hjhxjq/idea_of_adding_sugar/,Idea of adding Sugar,"In the world (and also maybe via teader) you couldve been able to find either can of sugar or box of sugar cubes. Later then you could add this sugar to all kinds of crafted drinks (i mean coffee, herbal tea and all other kinds of tea you could make) and maybe even some kinds of food (e.g. pies) to make them worth a bit more calories (at least in case with drinks you could add sugar up to 2-3 times per item). As a side effect i think it can slightly lower insomnia/cabin fever risks depending on how much of sugar was consumed e.g. drinking whole cup of herb tea with 2 cubes dropped cabin fever risks by 20% but with only 1 cube it would be 10%. Also can be a good idea to hardlimit the total amount of sugar you could consume in some time period - this might be turned into extra invisible bar which is initially empty, gets filled each time you consume sugar and depletes over time (from 100% to 0 in around 0.5-1.5 days), if this sugar bar gets filled too much then you cant eat sweetened food until it wont deplete a bit, but even then eating would stop if bar got completely filled during that process",1,1734811494.0,thelongdark,0,1.0,False
1hjhxds,https://www.reddit.com/r/danganronpa/comments/1hjhxds/the_feud_parts_five_and_six_fanfic/,The Feud: Parts Five and Six (Fanfic),"The next day, Himiko had spent the entire morning and afternoon replaying in her mind how she was going to tell Tenko to leave her alone. She wanted to be firm without sounding too harsh. She spent all her time worrying that she didn't notice that the day had flown by. The girls were now getting ready for their monthly slumber party. This month, they were holding it in Himiko and Tenko's room. They were already in their pajamas, giving each other makeovers while waiting for their pizza. Kaede sang along with the music that was playing on Miu's stereo that she had brought from her room while Angie braided Kaede's hair. Kirumi was painting Maki's nails. Miu was applying heavy makeup to Tsumugi's face, repeating over and over to Tsumugi that she desperately needed it, much to Tsumugi's annoyance. Tenko was eagerly choosing a nail polish color for Himiko.





  ""Oh, my gosh!! Pink would look good on your nails!"" she said.





   ""Pink isn't really my favorite color,"" Himiko mumbled with a small shrug.





   ""Oh! Well...what is, then?"" Tenko asked. Before Himiko could answer, Tenko reached for a forest green. ""Aahh!! How about this green? It'll compliment your hair!""





   ""I don't like green that much, either,"" Himiko sighed. ""Um...maybe I should put nail polish on myself. I don't need help.""





   ""Are you sure?"" Tenko asked, feeling her heart deflating. ""Because I can help! I'm really good at putting nail polish on!""





   ""I'm sure.""





   ""Are you afraid that you'll have shaky hands when I put it on?"" Tenko asked. ""That's okay! I can hold your hand...*steady!* Hold your hand steady!"" Himiko sighed.





   ""I can do it,"" she insisted.





   ""Well...okay..."" Tenko said. ""Would you like me to do your hair, then?""





   ""No...you don't have to,"" Himiko replied. 





   ""Hey, I think I heard the doorbell ring,"" Kaede said. ""That's probably our pizza.""





   ""I'll get it...since I'm not really busy,"" Tenko said, flashing Himiko a hurt expression. Again, Himiko felt that guilt. Tenko left, leaving Himiko to bury her face in her hands in frustration. 





   ""Himiko?"" came Angie's voice as she gently knocked on Himiko's head. Himiko looked up to see Angie smiling at her. Himiko smiled back.





  ""Hi, Angie,"" she said. 





   ""Would you like me to braid your hair the way I did Kaede's?"" Angie asked. She gestured over to Kaede, who's braid resembled that of Elsa's. 





   ""Ohh! That's pretty good, Angie!"" Himiko exclaimed.

 



  ""All thanks goes to Atua!"" Angie chirped happily. ""He made it possible! He can make it possible for you, too, Himiko!"" 





   ""Well...I guess it wouldn't hurt,"" Himiko replied hesitantly. However, as much as she wanted an Elsa braid, her guilt prevented her from accepting. She sighed. ""But...I dunno.""





   ""It'll be really quick, since you have such short hair,"" Angie promised.





   ""Nyeh...okay,"" Himiko said, then turned around so Angie could get to work on her hair. Before Angie could start parting her hair in sections, Tenko came back, carrying five boxes of large pizzas. 





   ""Okay, there's pepperoni, sausage, Hawaiian, cheese, and meat lovers,"" she said, setting the pizza down on her desk. 





   ""Excellent,"" Kirumi said. ""Allow me to grab the remaining refreshments from downstairs. We have water, of course, all flavors of Panta, I can make smoothies, coffee, hot cocoa, or any other beverage of your choosing. Snacks include-""



 

  ""ANGIE!!"" Tenko cried suddenly. Angie, Himiko, and the others looked at her in surprise. Tenko rushed over to Angie. ""What are you doing?! *I'm* supposed to be doing Himiko's hair!!""





   ""Oh, but...I didn't know,"" Angie said. 





   ""Yeah, right!"" Tenko spat. 





  ""Tenko, it shouldn't be a big deal, y'know,"" Kaede said. ""We're just here to have fun.""





   ""Himiko, you told me that you didn't want me to do your hair!"" Tenko said, ignoring Kaede. ""Why are you letting *Angie* do it?!""





  ""She did Kaede's braid, and I wanted her to do the same to mine,"" Himiko replied in a small voice.





   ""Whatever Angie can do, *I* can do better!"" Tenko said. The room fell silent. Himiko looked around her at the other girls, who were staring in stunned silence back at her. She didn't know whether to tell Tenko what she wanted to in front of everyone, or in private. She needed more advice from Kokichi.





   ""I-I'll be right back,"" she mumbled, standing up.





   ""Where are you going?"" Tenko demanded.





""Who do you think you are, her fuckin' mom?!"" Miu said. Tenko crossed her arms.





""I said where are you going, Himiko?"" she repeated.





   ""I just need to talk to Kokichi about something,"" Himiko said. 





   ""Why? So you can ignore me more?"" Tenko asked bitterly. Himiko stopped dead in her tracks, and turned back to Tenko. 





   ""Oh, shit! It's about to get real,"" Miu muttered quietly as she munched on some popcorn. Tenko's fists were clenched, and she was glaring at Himiko with tears streaming down her face. 





   ""Yeah, go run to Kokichi, like you always do!! Since he's your knight in shining armor, and you apparently can't live without him!!"" Hearing that, Himiko couldn't contain her frustration any longer.





   ""So what if he is?!"" she cried. ""And, it's just like Miu said, you're not my mom!! I don't have to answer to you!!""





   ""Well, excuse me for trying my dead-level best to look out for you!!"" Tenko shouted. 





   ""You're not trying to look out for me!! You're trying to get me all to yourself, even though I've told you time and time again that it makes me uncomfortable!!"" Himiko said. 





   ""I'm not making you uncomfortable!! I care about you!!"" Tenko shot back.





   ""Nyeeeh...there's a difference between caring about someone and *obsessing* over them!!"" Himiko said. ""If you cared about me at all, you'd realize that you make me uncomfortable all the time!! But, you don't care!! You only want what you want!!""





   ""That's not true!!"" Tenko yelled.





   ""YES, IT IS!!"" Himiko screamed as tears streamed down her face, gasping through her sobs. ""YOU THINK I ENJOY YOU PEEPING AT ME WHILE I'M TAKING A SHOWER?!"" The other girls gasped quietly, and turned to Tenko with astonished expressions. ""YOU THINK I ENJOY YOU TELLING ME TO LAY MY HEAD IN YOUR LAP SO YOU CAN GIVE ME A MASSAGE, OR RUB YOUR SPIT ALL OVER MY FACE, OR HEARING YOU SAY THAT YOU KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT ME WHEN YOU OBVIOUSLY DON'T?!?! THE ONLY REASON I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING IS BECAUSE I ALWAYS FELT GUILTY!! GUILTY THAT I WAS A BAD FRIEND!! GUILTY FOR WANTING TO HANG OUT WITH KOKICHI AND ANGIE INSTEAD OF WANTING TO BE AROUND YOU!! YOU'VE ALWAYS MADE ME FEEL GUILTY, AND UNCOMFORTABLE, AND I HATE IT!! I HATE FEELING GUILTY!! AND I HATE FEELING UNCOMFORTABLE!! I WANT IT TO STOP!! I DON'T WANNA BE YOUR FRIEND IF ALL YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS MAKE ME FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE AND GUILTY FOR WANTING TO BE AROUND OTHER PEOPLE!!"" 





   ""SO, YOU JUST WANT ME OUT OF YOUR LIFE FOREVER?! AFTER EVERYTHING I'VE DONE FOR YOU?!"" Tenko screeched. 





   ""SEE?! YOU DID IT AGAIN!! YOU'RE TRYING TO GUILT TRIP ME!!"" Himiko screamed with anger. 





   ""FINE!! IF THAT'S HOW YOU SEE IT, THEN MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T BE FRIENDS ANYMORE!!"" Tenko shouted. 





   ""WE WERE NEVER FRIENDS TO BEGIN WITH BECAUSE YOU TREATED ME LIKE I WAS SOME STUFFED ANIMAL THAT SHOULD ONLY BELONG TO YOU!!"" Himiko cried. ""I HAVE FREE WILL!! I DON'T BELONG TO YOU, SO STOP ACTING LIKE I DO!!""





   ""WELL, SORRY FOR WANTING TO BE YOUR FRIEND IN THE FIRST PLACE!!"" Tenko said. ""GO SEE YOUR STUPID DEGENERATE BOYFRIEND, BUT DON'T COME CRYING TO ME WHEN HE LIES, CHEATS, AND DUMPS YOU AFTER YOU END UP PREGNANT!!"" The other girls gasped in pure shock. Himiko's insides twisted in knots with anger, sadness, frustration, and indignation. She ran out of the room, but instead of heading to Kokichi's room, she rushed out of Casa V3, into the cold, crisp evening. Sobbing, Tenko rushed to the girls bathroom, locking herself in. The remaining girls just sat there in silence, wondering what had just happened. The only sound was the music from Miu's stereo. The only one not fazed was Miu.





   ""Huh...I, for one, enjoyed that!"" she said, before tossing a piece of popcorn into her mouth. 

  




**Part Six**

  




Himiko ran down the street as fast as her feet could carry her. The cold wind stung her tear-stained face, but she didn't care. She wanted to run far away from the pain, the guilt, and most of all, from Tenko. She came to the intersection that separated the dorms and the rest of the neighborhood from the park. So caught up in her own thoughts was she that she didn't notice Kaito calling her name from his car as she crossed the road. Himiko proceeded to run into the park, while Kaito turned the corner towards the dorms. She ran towards one of the gazebos that were dotted around the park. Kids and other passersby looked up in confusion at her, but didn't interfere. Himiko sat down on one the gazebo benches and threw her head into her arms, sobbing for quite some time. 





   *Stupid Tenko!* she thought to herself. *What gives her the right to try and take over my life?! Who does she think she is?!* Gasping for air, Himiko lifted her head, her reddened face wet with tears and snot. She gripped her head tightly as her sobs lessened and became soft crying. Goosebumps peppered her skin. She shivered violently as the bitingly cold wind tore through her pajamas, causing her to wrap her already freezing hands around her arms. 





  ""Himiko!"" Himiko turned around to see Kokichi running up to her, a baggy hoodie draped over one of his arms. He was wearing one himself. He sat down next to her and helped her put the hoodie on. He reached underneath the collar of his and pulled his scarf out, holding it up to Himiko's nose.





  ""Blow,"" he said. Himiko blew her nose into his scarf. Afterwards, he bunched it up and placed it into the front pocket of his hoodie. 





   ""Sorry about Scarfy,"" Himiko mumbled miserably. 





  ""Let's go,"" Kokichi said softly, pulling Himiko up from the bench. He led her to Kaito's car, opening the passenger door for her. Once Himiko was inside, she immediately felt the warmth of the heater. Kokichi drove away as soon as he sat down and the closed the driver side door, but he wasn't going back to Casa V3. Himiko looked out the passenger window at the approaching ocean. Thoughts of her altercation with Tenko began to disappear faster than the setting sun dipping below the horizon. The drive along the beach was silent, save for Himiko's occasional sniffling. Finally, Kokichi pulled into a parking space near the beach. Together, they sat quietly as they watched the sun set completely, painting the evening sky an ombre of purple and orange. 





   ""Kaito told me he saw you running to the park on his way back from getting some pizza,"" Kokichi said, breaking the long silence. 





   ""I didn't see him,"" Himiko responded quietly. Kokichi chuckled.





  ""He said that, too,"" he said. Himiko nodded silently in response, acknowledging his statement. ""He thought that us guys should also have a sleepover every month,"" Kokichi continued, rolling his eyes. ""That's why he went to go get pizza. He says it'd be faster than having it delivered.""





  ""Where are you having it?"" Himiko asked, suddenly curious. 





   ""Kaito and Shuichi's room,"" Kokichi replied. ""The door was closed, in case we...well, Kaito and I...got too loud from playing video games. We didn't wanna disturb you and the other girls."" Himiko lowered her head.





   ""So...you didn't hear what happened?"" she mumbled. 





   ""Nope!"" Kokichi replied, then gently nudged Himiko. ""So, what happened with you-know-who? I'm guessing she didn't take the news very well?"" Himiko rolled her eyes.





  ""Nyeh...she's such a..."" Himiko began in a shaky voice. She had to pause as more tears crept their way to the corners of her eyes. Her lip quivered as she opened her mouth to speak, but all that came out were gasps. Shutting her mouth again, she covered her mouth as a way to stifle her approaching sobs. 





   ""Stop repressing it, Himiko,"" Kokichi said firmly. ""Scream if you have to.""





   ""I CAN'T STAND HER, KOKICHI!!!"" Himiko screamed. ""SHE THINKS THAT JUST BECAUSE SHE GAVE ME ADVICE ON HOW TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS AND THAT SHE WAS TRYING TO BE NICE TO ME AND TRYING TO *'PROTECT'* ME THAT SHE HAS THE RIGHT TO ACT PERVERTED TOWARDS ME, AND THAT SHE CAN JUST TRY TO TAKE OVER MY LIFE?! AND WHEN I FINALLY DO TELL HER HOW I FEEL, SHE MAKES *ME* OUT TO BE THE BAD PERSON?! WHO IS SHE TO TRY TO GIVE *ME* ANY KIND OF ADVICE WHEN SHE TREATS THE BOYS LIKE CRAP JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE BOYS, AND SHE TREATS ANGIE THE SAME WAY BECAUSE I'D RATHER BE *HER* FRIEND?! I HATE THAT SHE ALWAYS TRIED TO GUILT TRIP ME!! I HATE THAT SHE ALWAYS MADE ME FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE!! I HATE THE WAY SHE ALWAYS WANTED ME TO AGREE WITH HER, AND HOW SHE WANTED TO ALWAYS BE AROUND ME AND ACTED LIKE SHE KNEW EVERYTHING ABOUT ME!! AND I HATE THE THINGS SHE SAYS ABOUT YOU!! SHE ALWAYS EXPECTS EVERYONE ELSE TO CHANGE EXCEPT FOR HER!! SHE'S SUCH A PAIN!!"" 





   Himiko buried her face into her hands, sobbing once more. With an impressed smile, Kokichi sat back in his seat and rested his hand on the steering wheel, staring out at the ocean while allowing Himiko some time to cry. After a while, her sobbing subsided, signaling to Kokichi to reach into his pocket and pull his scarf back out. He wanted to keep her from falling asleep, which she usually would immediately after a long cry.





   ""Blow,"" he said, holding Scarfy up to Himiko's nose. Like before, Himiko blew her nose into his scarf. After stuffing Scarfy back into his pocket, he grinned at Himiko. ""That was badass, Himiko! Feel better?"" Himiko wiped some of the tears from her face.





   ""A little,"" she said, then sighed heavily. ""Nyeh...I'm also tired. But, I don't wanna go back home. Especially after what happened. I'm sure the slumber party is ruined now."" She looked up at Kokichi. ""Kokichi, can we just go up to Hokkaido, or something?"" Kokichi smirked.





   ""You gonna drive all the way there and pay for the ferry ride from Aomori to Hokkaido?"" he asked. Himiko rolled her eyes in thought.





   ""Nyeh...can I borrow some money?"" she asked with a small smile. Kokichi laughed and wrapped his arm around her head, pulling her in to give her a soft kiss on her forehead. 





   ""Sorry, babe, no Hokkaido tonight,"" he said. ""Besides, Kaito's probably gonna start squawking soon, wondering why I'm taking so long with his car."" Immediately after, Kokichi's phone buzzed, indicating he received a text. He looked to see who it was, then showed Himiko. ""Speak of the devil.""





  *KAITO: Did you find her, yet?*





  Kokichi gave Himiko a mischievous grin. ""Think I should lie to him?"" Himiko giggled.





   ""Sure,"" she said, nodding eagerly.





  *KOKICHI: No! Are you sure she went to the park?!*





  Kokichi and Himiko waited in silence for Kaito to respond.





  *KAITO: She's not there?! I swear I saw her go into the park!!*





  *KOKICHI: You'd better not be lying to me!*





  *KAITO: I'm not!! She went into the park!! You want me to call the police?*





   Kokichi smiled. ""Don't wanna get the po-po involved,"" he said. ""I'll go ahead and let him know you're with me.""





  *KOKICHI: Oh, wait! Lemme ask Himiko. She's right next to me.*





  *KAITO: Dude, seriously...fuck you!!*





  Kokichi and Himiko burst into laughter. Kokichi then placed his phone in his back pocket before starting Kaito's car back up and backing out of the parking space.





   ""Kokichi?""





  ""What's up?""





  ""Can we sleep in our pillow fort again tonight?"" Himiko asked. ""I really don't wanna deal with...you-know-who.""





   ""Sure, Monkey Buns!"" Kokichi said. Himiko sighed in relief, but she wasn't prepared for the surprise waiting for her back at Casa V3.",1,1734811479.0,danganronpa,0,1.0,False

my girlfriend and i have been together for around 3 years, and we almost never have sex/intimacy anymore. this is very frustrating for me a lot of the time, as sometimes all i want to do is fuck the shit out of her!! i’ve tried to initiate slowly, kissing her neck, touching her body before even saying or suggesting anything. i’ve tried showing her how much i love her by doing nice gestures throughout the day, but it’s so tiring.

for context, she suffers from depression/anxiety and is medicated for it. i always try to help her as best as i can having gone through these issues myself. i know how tough it can be to get out of bed even! she has also had some physical issues down there which i totally get. i do 100% of the housework day to day. i wash, i clean, i do laundry, i cook whatever she wants, i hoover, i tidy up. i’ll make her a cup of coffee when she wants one, i’ll cuddle her in the morning and at night before we go to sleep. i always do my best to take care of her because i love her so much, but the bedroom is lacking severely

i think i’m lucky to have sex once very 2/3 months. we are both 22(m) and 21(f) so i believe we should still be going at it a lot of the time. we don’t even do anything else sexual like finger play or oral. i just want to feel something

i know depression can be a huge factor, but when i think about it i just think- if she wanted to have sex with me she would? i also think that these problems started 2 years ago and have only gotten better in short spells of a week or two. i also totally understand her physical issues have 100% limited her desire to have any sexual contact at all

sometimes it’s not even about the sex, it’s about feeling wanted still. sometimes i just want to make out with her and it stop there? just something?

i’ve raised these issues to her before, and she’s always said she hates herself for it, she’s not good enough for me because she doesn’t have sex with me enough and usually starts crying. i feel this is a mechanism to get me to stop talking about it. i feel as though if she wanted to deal with the issues at hand, she would try but i’ve not seen any real attempts/progress

to be honest, i don’t even feel like initiating anything anymore, as i know my advances will just get rejected. i’m not even sure if i want to have sex with her because of it. there have been a couple of occasions where she has asked me and i’ve rejected her because i just remember how i won’t get it again for months, so i’ll be stuck in the same position- wanting and never getting 

it makes me feel like i’m not good enough as well, like why am i not good enough to have sex with? 

i’m just lost tbh",1,1734811462.0,DeadBedrooms,1,1.0,False
1hjhx0y,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1hjhx0y/the_radio_said_my_name_this_morning/,The Radio Said My Name This Morning.,"I wake up early, every day, to my routine. Coffee brews, and the radio plays softly. The station—96.7 FM—is familiar and predictable. The DJs laugh, and the music flows. But one thing always stands out.

Every morning, they pause. Then, they say a name.

“David Miles,” they might say. It’s quick, out of place. They don’t explain. Afterward, the show continues, normal as ever.

I never thought much about it. Maybe it was a joke or a community announcement. The names meant nothing to me—until this morning.

As I poured coffee, I waited. The pause came. Then, I heard it:

“Rebecca Gray.”

My hand went cold. I managed to catch the cup as it tilted slightly. My entire name echoed around the kitchen. As if the air itself had stopped, the moment dragged on heavily.

The station went on. Then came typical, happy weather updates. However, I was unable to let it go. I felt like I was being watched, and my chest clenched. Why my name? Why now?

The sensation persisted. My mind was all over the place at work. I kept hearing the voice on the radio. The hours passed slowly, and at last, I went home. My sanctuary, the apartment, seemed different. Long stretches of shadow were accompanied by a dense, deafening quiet.

By 10 PM, I gave in. Something pushed me—urged me—to turn on the radio again. I hesitated, but my fingers moved. Static buzzed, then music returned, slower than usual. The rhythm unsettled me. My breathing quickened.

A pause interrupted the song. I braced myself.

“Rebecca Gray,” the voice said again.

This time, it was sharper. The sound felt closer, like it wasn’t just in the radio. I froze, waiting, listening. The air turned colder. My pulse pounded in my ears.

Then, the knocking started.

It was soft, tapping on the window. My head snapped toward the sound. Nothing was there. I held my breath. The tapping came again, louder this time.

With my pulse pounding, I edged closer. Outside, the grass was covered in the shadows cast by the swaying trees. There was no one, yet the wind whispered. Still, the knocking persisted, steady and insistent.

I stepped back. My legs felt weak. The room darkened, though the lights remained on. The radio crackled, and I turned toward it instinctively.

“Rebecca Gray,” the voice hissed. This time, it didn’t feel human.

The wind howled louder, and the knocking turned to banging, violent and desperate. My chest tightened, and I backed away. The radio buzzed, the music distorting. Shadows seemed to shift, reaching toward me.

“Rebecca,” the voice said, softer now, almost gentle. “You’ve been called.”

The banging stopped. The silence was worse. My name echoed in my mind. I couldn't tell if the wind outside was real or if I was losing control as it shrieked. I fell to the ground when my legs gave out.

They had called me. And I wasn’t [ready](https://unseenofficial.blogspot.com/).",1,1734811450.0,libraryofshadows,0,1.0,False

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We've all been there, standing in the pet store aisle, overwhelmed by the sheer variety of dog treats. From crunchy biscuits to freeze-dried liver, the options seem endless. But lately, one treat has been stealing the spotlight: collagen sticks. They promise shiny coats, healthy joints, and happy pups. But do they live up to the hype? More importantly, do vets actually recommend them? This article will dig into the nitty-gritty of collagen sticks for dogs, exploring their potential benefits, possible drawbacks, and everything in between. We’ll examine the science, consider vet perspectives, and help you decide if these chewy treats are right for your furry friend. So, grab a cup of coffee, settle in, and let's unravel the mystery of collagen sticks.

### What are Collagen Sticks, Anyway?

Before we dive into the vet recommendations, let’s clarify what collagen sticks actually are. These aren’t just glorified rawhide chews. They're typically made from processed animal hides, often bovine or porcine, that are broken down into collagen and then reformed into stick shapes. Think of it like a concentrated dose of the protein that makes up your dog's connective tissues, including skin, tendons, ligaments, and cartilage.

### The Purported Benefits: Why the Hype Around Collagen?

Collagen sticks have gained popularity due to the touted benefits for dogs, particularly regarding joint health, skin and coat condition, and even dental hygiene. Let's break these down:

- **Joint Support:** Collagen is a crucial component of healthy joints. As dogs age, their natural collagen production can decline, leading to stiffness and discomfort. Could supplementing with collagen sticks help keep those joints lubricated and agile? We’ll explore this further.
- **Skin and Coat Health:** A glossy coat is often seen as a sign of a healthy dog. Collagen plays a role in skin elasticity and hair growth. Proponents of collagen sticks suggest they can contribute to a shinier coat and healthier skin.
- **Dental Health:** Chewing on anything can help scrape away plaque and tartar buildup on a dog’s teeth. Collagen sticks, being relatively hard and long-lasting, are often marketed as a way to promote dental health through this mechanical action.

### Do Vets Recommend Collagen Sticks for Dogs? The Veterinary Perspective

So, the million-dollar question: do vets actually recommend these chewy treats? The answer isn’t a simple yes or no. It's more nuanced than that. While many vets acknowledge the potential benefits of supplemental collagen, they also emphasize the importance of choosing high-quality products and being mindful of potential risks.

Some vets may recommend collagen sticks as a supplemental source of collagen for dogs with joint issues, especially older dogs or those with arthritis. However, they would likely stress that these treats should not replace prescribed medications or other treatments. They are seen more as a supportive measure rather than a primary treatment.

Other vets might be more cautious, pointing to the lack of conclusive scientific evidence supporting the benefits of collagen sticks. They might also raise concerns about potential choking hazards, digestive upset, or the calorie content, particularly for overweight dogs.

### Do Vets Recommend Collagen Sticks for Dogs? Considering the Potential Downsides

While collagen sticks can have potential upsides, it's crucial to consider the flip side of the coin. Just like any treat, there can be drawbacks:

- **Choking Hazard:** This is a significant concern, especially for small dogs or aggressive chewers. Larger pieces can break off and become lodged in the throat. Always supervise your dog when they're enjoying a collagen stick.
- **Digestive Issues:** Some dogs have sensitive stomachs and may experience diarrhea or vomiting after consuming collagen sticks. Start with a small piece and monitor your dog's reaction.
- **Calorie Content:** These treats can be calorie-dense. If your dog is already battling the bulge, collagen sticks might not be the best choice.
- **Quality Control:** Not all collagen sticks are created equal. Some may contain questionable ingredients or be sourced from less reputable suppliers. Opt for high-quality products from trusted brands.

### Alternatives to Collagen Sticks: Exploring Other Options

If you’re hesitant about collagen sticks, several alternatives can offer similar benefits without the same potential downsides:

1. **Collagen Powder:** Adding collagen powder to your dog's food is a more digestible alternative. It bypasses the choking hazard and allows for better portion control.
2. **Glucosamine and Chondroitin Supplements:** These are often recommended by vets for joint health and can be more effective than collagen alone.
3. **Fish Oil:** Rich in omega-3 fatty acids, fish oil can contribute to healthy skin and coat, as well as joint health.
4. **Chew Toys:** For dental health, consider durable chew toys designed to promote dental hygiene.

### Do Vets Recommend Collagen Sticks for Dogs? Making the Right Choice for Your Pup

So, we've covered the pros, the cons, the vet perspectives, and the alternatives. Now, how do you decide if collagen sticks are right for *your* dog? Consider these factors:

- **Size and Chewing Habits:** Is your dog a delicate chewer or a power chewer? If they tend to gulp down treats whole, collagen sticks might be too risky.
- **Overall Health:** Does your dog have any existing health conditions, such as allergies or digestive issues? Consult your vet before introducing new treats.
- **Dietary Needs:** Is your dog overweight or on a restricted diet? Consider the calorie content of collagen sticks.

Ultimately, the best approach is to chat with your veterinarian. They can assess your dog's individual needs and advise on whether collagen sticks are a suitable addition to their diet. They can also recommend appropriate alternatives if needed.

### Decoding the Labels: What to Look for in Collagen Sticks

If you decide to try collagen sticks, remember that not all are created equal. Look for products that are:

- **Single-Ingredient:** Ideally, the only ingredient should be collagen. Avoid products with added fillers, artificial flavors, or preservatives.
- **Sourced from Reputable Suppliers:** Choose brands that are transparent about their sourcing and manufacturing processes.
- **Sized Appropriately for Your Dog:** Offer smaller sticks to smaller dogs to reduce the choking risk.

### Conclusion: A Treat with Potential, but Proceed with Caution

Collagen sticks have carved a niche in the pet treat market, promising a host of health benefits for our canine companions. While they hold promise, especially for joint support and skin health, it’s crucial to approach them with a balanced perspective. They are not a magic bullet and shouldn’t replace veterinary care or a balanced diet.

Talking to your vet is always the best first step. They can guide you in making an informed decision about whether collagen sticks are a suitable treat for your furry friend and suggest appropriate alternatives if needed. Remember, a happy, healthy dog is the ultimate goal, and making informed choices about their diet and treats plays a crucial role in achieving that.",1,1734811251.0,DogRhino,0,1.0,False

>[](https://www.reddit.com/user/YoshiFan96/)Hey, I had an idea for an obscure fun fact on Sims 2 you could cover - it’s about objects that can break in an unmodded game :D  
  
Like, most people know sinks, showers or TVs can break…  
  
But did you know that hot tubs can also break and spray water all over the place?  
  
Did you know the expensive wall TV can fall off and turn to debris? (You can save the TV from falling down by putting something under it, like a coffee table.)  
  
Did you know that after three Sim months (90 in-game days) have passed, a video game console can randomly turn into debris when a Sim turns it on?  
  
Maxis also planned for lamps to be able to break (there are leftovers for that in the code), but I think this was glitchy as lamps can’t break in the finished game.  
  
You can easily simulate all of these except for the video game console by shift-clicking a Sim -> Spawn… -> The Break Inducer.

My (F27) friend Kelly*(F29) have been friends for about 3 years now. I met her through my ex (who happened to cheat on me with Kelly’s twin sister) who was best friends with her husband.

When my ex and I were together, Kelly and I had only met a couple of times and at that time I didn’t really consider her a friend. When I discovered my ex had been cheating on me it was from reading his chats between him and her husband who had both been going back and forth about their most recent adventures into the world of infidelity on both myself and Kelly. Needless to say I got out of that relationship and went about my life and left him and his friends behind… until 3 years ago when Kelly reached out to go for a coffee date. Slowly over time we became a lot closer. 

Now, I had obviously never forgotten about those messages but I have never told her about them and I knew there was a stage her marriage was on the rocks and assumed it could be due to her husband cheating. We live in a very small coastal town so usually word gets around quick enough to anticipate couples breaking up after someone cheats so I summed it up to that and decided to not bring it up. 

Whenever we would meet up for a coffee she would tell me stories about her husband and I would constantly cringe inside knowing what I know and not telling her. I felt so guilty… until one day my hair stylist was telling me about her spicy hook up she had over her weekend and I realised she was talking about Kelly’s husband. This time I decided to tell Kelly what I knew and it just blew up in my face.

Kelly told me she reached out to my hair stylist and asked her for the full story which my incredible stylist (she’s a girls girl) was more than happy to share to give Kelly the whole run of everts. I thought that was great until she said she didn’t believe her because her husband apparently has “never met that girl”. My hairstylist said that he showed her a copy of his divorce papers to convince her he was single and shared enough details to me to make me believe there was no shadow of a doubt that this really happened. Somehow Kelly’s husband put on such a show that she eventually hated my hair stylist for “lying”. 

I felt really bad for getting involved but both ladies in our own private conversations thanked me for supporting them both even if the outcome wasn’t what I was hoping for.

Another important thing to note, Kelly is the sole breadwinner between her and her husband and they have a 4 year old son and a daughter on the way. Husband is currently unemployed and studying to get his top level as a paramedic (THAT SHE IS PAYING FOR)

Since all of this has happened, I realised that without proof she will simply always choose to believe her husband. 

A year after this all went down, I made friends with another girl in our town who has never met my hairstylist and had no connection whatsoever to myself and Kelly before. One day I went for coffee with this new friend who brought up a story of her having a threesome with two guys, one of them being Kelly’s husband. When I told her that Kelly was married to the one guy, my friend very matter-of-factly stated “they’re not married anymore, he showed me a copy of their divorce papers” - the EXACT thing he did to my stylist….

I’ve been sitting on this information for about 1 year now and it eats me up not saying anything to her, especially now that she’s expecting her daughter. The only reason I haven’t said anything is because firstly, I feel like I’m going to be seen as someone causing drama, and second, based on her first reaction, what are the chances she’s actually going to believe me this time? 

So strangers on the internet, AITA for not telling her? Should I just stay out of it? What do I do? ",1,1734811071.0,AITA_Relationships,0,1.0,False

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth bleaching has become a popular option for those looking to achieve a brighter smile. Many people turn to dentists for professional teeth whitening treatments, seeking not just a cosmetic boost but also a confidence lift. Understanding the impact of dentist teeth bleaching before and after the procedure can help you decide if this treatment is right for you.

### What to Expect Before the Treatment

Before undergoing teeth bleaching, it's important to prepare. Here are some steps typically taken by dentists:

- **Initial Consultation:** Your dentist will assess your dental health and discuss your whitening goals.
- **Teeth Cleaning:** A professional cleaning may be recommended to remove surface stains and plaque.
- **Color Assessment:** The dentist will match your current tooth color against a shade guide to determine your starting point.
- **Recommendations:** Depending on your dental health, the dentist will suggest the most suitable bleaching method—whether in-office treatment or take-home kits.

### The Bleaching Process

During the bleaching process, the dentist applies a whitening gel to your teeth. This gel typically contains hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide as active ingredients. For in-office treatments, a special light may be used to enhance the effect of the gel, allowing for faster and more effective results. This process can take around 30 to 90 minutes, depending on the method chosen.

- **Whiter Teeth:** Most patients achieve between 3 to 8 shades lighter teeth.

- **Maintain Good Oral Hygiene:** Regular brushing and flossing will help keep your teeth bright.
- **Use Whiteners as Directed:** If prescribed a take-home whitening kit, follow the instructions to prolong the effects.

### The Psychological and Social Impact

The outcome of dentist teeth bleaching does not just affect your appearance; it can transform your social interactions and self-image. Many individuals report feeling more outgoing and confident after their procedures. This newfound confidence can lead to better engagement in social situations—people often feel more comfortable smiling and laughing.

Additionally, studies have shown that a bright smile can make a significant difference in how others perceive you. People with whiter teeth are often viewed as more attractive, friendly, and successful, which can influence everything from personal relationships to job opportunities.

Understanding the Science Behind Teeth Bleaching Treatments and Their Results
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth bleaching has become a popular cosmetic dental procedure, with many individuals seeking brighter and whiter smiles.

Understanding this can help you make informed choices about your dental care.

### The Causes of Tooth Discoloration

Tooth discoloration can occur due to a variety of reasons:

- **Extrinsic Stains:** These stains form on the outer layer of teeth, usually from food, drinks, or habits like smoking. Common culprits include coffee, tea, red wine, and certain fruits.
- **Intrinsic Stains:** These occur beneath the enamel surface, often due to factors such as aging, trauma, or exposure to certain medications like tetracycline during childhood.
- **Poor Oral Hygiene:** Inadequate cleaning can lead to plaque and tartar buildup, causing teeth to appear yellow or brown.

### How Teeth Bleaching Works

The process of teeth bleaching typically involves using a whitening agent that contains hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide. Here’s how it works:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Penetration:** The bleaching agent penetrates the tooth enamel and reaches the discolored molecules inside the tooth.
- **Chemical Reaction:** Once inside, the bleaching agent breaks down stains through a chemical reaction, effectively whitening the tooth.
- **Light Activation:** Some treatments use special light to enhance the effect of the whitening agent. This can expedite the process and achieve more noticeable results.

### Types of Teeth Bleaching Treatments

You have several options when it comes to teeth bleaching treatments:

- **In-Office Treatments:** These are performed by a dentist using professional-grade products, typically resulting in faster and more effective results. Sessions usually last about an hour and can lighten teeth several shades.
- **At-Home Kits:** These kits include trays and bleaching solutions that you can use at your convenience. While they may take longer to reach desired results, they are generally more cost-effective.
- **Whitening Toothpaste:** Although less intense compared to other options, these can help remove surface stains and are a simple addition to your daily oral care routine.

### Results: Before and After Teeth Bleaching

The transformation from before to after teeth bleaching can be remarkable. Most patients notice a significant shade change, often seeing results that are up to 5-10 shades whiter. Here are a few key points about results:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Initial Results:** Many patients see immediate improvements after the first treatment. However, full results may continue to develop for several days following the procedure.
- **Longevity:** While teeth whitening is effective, it’s not permanent. Depending on your diet and oral hygiene, results can last from several months up to two years.
- **Maintenance:** To maintain your bright smile, consider using touch-up kits or whitening toothpaste regularly.

### Side Effects and Considerations

Though teeth bleaching is generally safe, there are potential side effects you should be aware of:

- **Tooth Sensitivity:** Some individuals may experience temporary sensitivity after treatment. This sensitive feeling usually subsides shortly after treatment.
- **Gum Irritation:** If the bleaching agent comes into contact with your gums, it can cause irritation. Dentists often provide protective measures to minimize this risk during in-office procedures.
- **Uneven Results:** Some individuals with existing dental work, like crowns or veneers, may not achieve even results, as these materials do not respond to bleach the same way as natural teeth.

Understanding the science behind teeth bleaching treatments can empower you as a consumer. Whether you're considering in-office treatments for a big event or looking for at-home options, knowing what to expect and how to maintain your results ensures you get the smile you desire.

### Conclusion

The journey of teeth bleaching can lead to remarkable changes, as evidenced by countless before-and-after stories. These transformations not only enhance the appearance of teeth but also boost confidence and self-esteem. By witnessing real-life results, you can better appreciate the transformative power of professional dental bleaching. Those who undergo treatment often express satisfaction with their dazzling new smiles, sharing their experiences as a testament to the effectiveness of modern dentistry.

","

I remember playing a game I downloaded on my Ipad from the Appstore for free, but I don't remember its name, here's the informations about the game: 

**Platform(s):** I downloaded the game in my Ipad from the Appstore for free. But it's possible that it was also released on other platforms as Android.

**Genre:** The game was about a miner exploring the underground, I think the goal of the game is just exploring but I'm not really sure.

**Estimated year of release:** Unfortunately, I don't know when was this game released, but I can say that I was playing it between 2016-2017 (hope this is helpful).

**Graphics/art style:** The game graphics were similar to those from Super Mario Maker, the gameplay was in 2D but with 3D models (character, animations, background... )

**Notable characters:** The only character I had was a miner with a blue shirt (or a coat I'm not sure), and he was one block tall and he could jump one block high (when I say block I say the blocks from the game), I also remember the sound effect when he jumps, it was some sort of ""ughh"" which resonates if you were undergound, but the biggest notable detail was that he looks a lot like the guy from Jetpack Joyride  
Note: The game in not from HalfBrick co. I verified)

**Notable gameplay mechanics:** The game has the same mechanic as Terraria, the deeper you explore the underground the darker it goes, you could also use torches if necessary, I'm pretty sure that there was some  other items to break blocks but I don't remember them.

**Other details:**  
\_The blocks of the undergound were colored, most of the time with pink and blue but there was other colors for sure.  
\_The game has a day/night cycle.  
\_There was a money counter on the top left of the screen, and the number were written in a very medieval writing style, the number 2 was written as Z and 3 looked like a side reversed M.  
\_The money counter was colored in coffee like brown.

I hope this post will help you finding my game, sorry if some of the infomations are incorrect and I wish it's not going to be a problem in your researches, and if you have any questions I am open for answering it.",1,1734810760.0,tipofmyjoystick,0,0.99,False

And the dev + team is always active.


Awesome website to buy merch and learn about the coin! 

FROM THE WEBSITE (ITS LEGIT)

“Welcome to the world of SHIBUSSY, a project born from exhaustion.
Built on Base, powered by a tired community of sleepyheads and degenerates.
We're not here to make promises or hype empty plans.
SHIBUSSY is a comunity-driven, decentralized project where tired hands and tired minds decide what comes next.
No nonsense. No fluff. Just $SHIBUSSY and a movement for those who are tired of everything.”

Why $SHIBUSSY?
* Base Chain:
Fast, secure, and built for next wave of new tokens.
* LP Locked:
Liquidity tokens burned for trust.
🤝 Community First:
Driven by tired hands and minds.**
* Deflationary Supply:
16.7B Tokens burned to date - over 24% of supply.
* Renounced Contract:
No single entity controls the contract.

Liquidity Pool Details
 • Liquidity Locked
The original liquidity pool created by the team is fully locked, with liquidity tokens burned forever. This ensures trust and stability for the project.

 • Community-Funded Liquidity Pools
Some community members have created additional liquidity pools to support trading. These pools are entirely optional, decentralized, and outside of team control. Because of this, the percentage of ""locked liquidity"" can fluctuate based on the total combined liquidity in all pools.
Team Commitment to Locked Liquidity
The team is dedicated to growing the locked liquidity pool as the community grows. We will continue to find ways to strengthen the liquidity base, ensuring long-term stability and trust.

• What this means:
The team’s original pool remains locked and untouchable.
Community pools can grow or shrink based on individual contributors, and this impacts the overall percentage shown for ""locked liquidity"" on platforms like Token Sniffer or DEX scanners.

•Why this matters:
This is a sign of growth and decentralization. More liquidity pools = healthier trading and a stronger project.

 •Key Takeaway:
The team’s liquidity is locked forever. Community contributions and the team’s commitment to growth are part of the open and decentralized nature of $SHIBUSSY.

This is not a rug pull. This is a project that will be in everyone's wallet. It's only a matter of time...
Until then. 
I'm going to take a nap & get some sleep.
I am extremely exhausted trying to make this post, thank God for coffee ! ☕️

1hjhmt8,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1hjhmt8/amazon_will_eventually_go_out_of_business_when/,Amazon will eventually go out of business When consumers realize there are better alternatives ,"This is unpopular because people love Amazon. They could not possibly fathom Amazon going out of business. For $139 per year, you get free one day or two-day shipping. They are thinking utopia. Right? Not so fast. 

But there are a couple of factors involved that makes Amazon much more expensive than shopping at a Walmart.

One can purchase items at Walmart and get same-day delivery from their  local Walmart store. And that is when selecting the regular SHIPPING option. Some items are local and Walmart will deliver them in a plastic Walmart bag. The only requirement Is a minimum $35 order.

Other items, when selecting the SHIPPING method, will arrive next day. Again, the only requirement is a minimum $35 order. items come in a box.

The other downside of Amazon is dynamic pricing. The prices vary wildly. as an example, 1 kg bag of whole coffee bean might fluctuate between $23 and $17. And that's just a regular price fluctuation. Then sometimes it'll go on sale for less than 17. To use Amazon, one really needs a price tracker like camelcamelcamel. Walmart pricing, on the other hand, is fairly stable. Prices generally go down with the rollback because it's a sale. But the price is not all over the place like Amazon.


So why would anyone continue to pay $139 for Amazon subscription When they can get faster delivery service, and for free, in addition to cheaper prices and more stable pricing, by using Walmart? 

Eventually they'll smarten up and ditch Amazon and tell Amazon to shove their crazy pricing and obscene subscription cost up their butt

Looking for platonic friendships only, any gender welcome but 30+ only please. I have actually made a great friend from Reddit after posting on a sub before so hopefully can be lucky again!

I live by myself and work remote and my social circle has just dissipated over the last few years. I also attracted really terrible friends as used to be a heavy weed smoker and realised when I stopped that people just wanted somewhere to get baked and someone who would feed them! 

I am wanting an online friendship that can hopefully turn into a face to face one so if you live in NE England that would be preferable. Have a typical working class British sense of humour so need someone who will let me take the piss out of them and feel free to return the favour. I generally get on better with lads than lasses but not really sure why tbh as always enjoyed the company of women.

I work two jobs so not a lot of free time but if you have capacity to hang out like once a month further down the line that would be grand.

I like going for walks, the seaside, museums, coffee shops, cinema and theatre. At home I like reading, bingewatching, cooking/baking, painting landscapes and home improvements. I know this list makes me sound boring as fuck but I am alright I swear.

I’m back asking for your advice on my school decision! I’ve spoken to friends, family, alums, current students, and the schools, but I’m hoping some fresh perspectives from this community can shed new light on my situation.

Here’s a quick breakdown of my background:

* Creative professional with ~11 years of experience in arts and entertainment management

* Went to top U.S. art school.

* NYC-based, with lots of friends and family here. Would want to be in NYC after graduation.

* Married and expecting my first child this spring (baby will be ~3 months old when I start school). A bit crazy, but I'm older than the average MBA student and this baby is very much wanted. We’re committed to making it work.

* Money is not an issue as I'm fortunate to have family support for my MBA

* I’ve had 8-10 coffee chats with students and alums from each school, and I’ve got more lined up.

Now, for the fun part: my pros and cons for the two schools I’m deciding between.

#**Yale SOM**

**Pros:**

* My heart is with SOM right now. I've really liked all the students and alums I've spoken to, and SOM's mission-driven focus speaks to me. As a nontraditional applicant with an arts background, I feel like I would fit in more at SOM.

* I'd love to continue working with artists and creatives after school. Yale’s strong MFA program adds extra weight to their brand in that community - maybe more than Stern?

* SOM has definitely made an effort to connect with me as a prospective student, while Stern has felt more detached. This is a small factor, but it does stand out.

* Seems like there's a strong NYC-Yale pipeline and a lot of SOM people are both from, and end up in, New York - which is where I want to be.

* The SOM cohort seems super tight-knit. Given that I’ll be juggling a new baby, I think I’d really benefit from a close, supportive community.

* As much as I love NYC, New Haven could be a quieter, easier place to raise a baby for couple years.

* SOM gave me a Forté Fellowship and a Dean's Scholarship, which are small gestures but potentially nice to have on the resume.

**Cons:**

* It feels objectively crazy to move 2 hours away from our family and friends with a newborn.

* Unclear how childcare would really work. I'm reaching out to Yale about this to see if they have any connections or suggestions, but it would be harder no matter what.

* While my partner’s job is flexible, he’d be much more isolated in New Haven, which is something we’d both need to adjust to.

* SOM network is smaller than the Stern network.

#**NYU Stern**

**Pros:**

* Stern is in NYC, where I already live and want to stay after graduation. It’s perfect for internships and long-term opportunities in arts and entertainment. 

* The number of arts and entertainment employers in NYC is unmatched compared to New Haven - it’s not even close.

* Being in the city makes childcare and managing my family-school balance infinitely easier.

* Though Stern's more finance-heavy focus is irrelevant to me, it's still an amazing program. I know I’d find my tribe inside of Stern, even if I wouldn't have much in common with most of the cohort.

* Stern’s network is bigger and deeper, especially in NYC. This could be really helpful for my post-graduation goals.

**Cons:**

* To be really honest, I’ve had a variety of interactions with Stern students and alums and I usually don't feel like I fit in, or much of a connection there at all. I think this is simply because of my nontraditional background and having less in common with most of the folks I've talked with. I have definitely enjoyed speaking to a few Stern people, but for whatever reason I feel like I mesh better with SOM people overall.

* I've heard that many Stern students already have their NYC social lives set, and therefore aren’t as eager to bond with the incoming class. I’m in the same boat - already having my own social circle in the city - but with a baby on the way, I’m worried this could make it harder to make deeper connections within the Stern network.

* Stern didn't give me a Forté Fellowship, which is a little annoying. (I could potentially reach out to them about this.)

If there weren't a baby on the way, I would choose SOM in a heartbeat. With the baby, Stern seems like the obvious choice in many ways.

I spend around $700 a month on groceries here and don’t pay a dime in taxes. Hawaii would tax you about $30 but that same grocery load would run you closer to a grand so make it $45. 

The other day i went to the grocery store and saw 30 cents in taxes. It was for the dog treats I bought. 

So even though SoCal has 8-10% sales tax, it doesn’t affect families struggling and spending majority of their budget on food. By the way California also doesn’t charge taxes on services, so a drink from a coffee shop and even a Disneyland ticket has no taxes. (We pay much more in real estate taxes though). 

I know grocery taxes has been mentioned before, but perhaps not enough as my family and friends there have never mentioned taxes on groceries and often praise the “lower” sales tax that Hawaii has. I visit 3-4 times a year and it gets me every time when i buy groceries there. 

The “lower taxes” is a bit deceiving as Hawaii is one of the 13 states that tax groceries and most of those states have limits. Sure, it’s nice when you want to buy a car or a TV, but not when your biggest expense is groceries.",1,1734810480.0,u_stock_oclock,0,1.0,False

I’ve been collecting eggshells from a local café at the same time I pick up used coffee grounds for composting. I crush them and mix them into my 4 “hot-composting” Geobins so that they have a chance at least begin breaking down over the following 6 to 9 months while the compost is “maturing.” I use that compost to amend the potting soil in my large grow bags every spring before planting “heavy feeders” such as tomatoes, peppers, eggplants, squash and so on.

Since I started using them two years ago, I’ve had almost zero BER (blossom end rot.) But, “real life” being what it is, I’ve also made other changes/improvements in the care of those plants, such as using significantly larger grow bags and being more careful about consistent watering. If it were a lab, I would only change one variable at a time.

So, what I’m wondering is whether I’m kidding myself by thinking the crushed eggshells actually help, even though they do indeed seem to. Would appreciate your experience and thoughts. Thanks!",2,1734810163.0,vegetablegardening,3,0.75,False

when i bought the car i knew it had its problems, but it has a new hybrid battery and the engine is healthy. I figured it would be a cheap project car to occupy my time. I drove it to pick up some prescriptions into town, about a 20 mile drip, everything was fine, the next day i topped off the coolant and made sure it was burped \\ bled properly, and started my 60 mile round trip to the DMV. it had lost very little coolant on the first trip so i thought i would be fine getting it registered. About halfway there i could hear something that sounded like a pressurized leak, like a steam leak, then the car started to overheat (i kept a scantool plugged into it to monitor temps) once it hit 205 i stopped and shut it down, had it towed home, almost all the coolant was gone.

  
the next day i refilled the system and burped it again, took over a gallon. i put my pressure tester on it and pumped it to 13psi and could find no signs of leaking. so i tried again after getting the engine up to operating temperature. still no signs of leaks. both hoses were hard and pressurized like you would expect, but they were barely warm, and i know the tstat had opened. i would want my coffee to be hotter than this. the radiator cap was cold.

1hjhdhx,https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/1hjhdhx/sleeping_better_with_spirituality/,Sleeping better with Spirituality ,"Found something that actually works after years of struggle.

I'm a anxious M(35) with long time 10+ years of sleep problems. Never getting more than a few hours of sleep per night, always struggling to fall asleep or stay asleep.

This is what I've been doing medication free to tame the anxiety, fall asleep faster, stay asleep and slowly recover:

Start reading about enlightenment -Jed McKenna Trilogy -The Untethered Soul -Ask and it is Given -Love yourself like your Life Depends on it. -The Short Path to Enlightenment -The Sleep Book

For starters these books are a good base and can be read several times, and come in audio books for walks/work/travel/rest.

2. Quit all stimulants, nicotine, coffee, and anything that disrupts sleep such as alcohol and sugar.

3. Don't eat before bed, last meal should be early and at least 4 hours before bed.

4. Cut down on social media, it stimulates me personally and keeps me over thinking when I'm tired.

5. Start a passion project to distract and occupy my brain.

6. Meditation should be added here but I've been pretty relaxed about it.

Biggest thing as been separating myself from my thoughts, being more mindful, not trying to fight and control my brain, anxiety and sleep.

Basically surrender. I found constantly trying to fix myself was causing almost all the extra anxiety that would keep my brain working when it needed to rest.

Still a work in progress but easily 60% better that it has been in 10 years.

I hope it helps someone on their journey to letting go to better sleep.",1,1734809899.0,spirituality,0,1.0,False

Nope. Last night we went to our usual game night with my sister's family and my poor son had a meltdown for most of the time until he fell asleep. I'm very thankful for them by the way. There was no judgement as to why my sone was crying and at one point he attempted to explain to my sister why he was upset. However, his verbal language is still lacking so we couldn't understand it, but he attempted!

He also hasn't been sleeping well and has been up at 4 am most every day this week. They also had a Polar Express party in his class yesterday and he knows there's not school for the next couple of weeks. Added that we are trying an AirBnB about an hour away to avoid in laws in Christmas Day. All this has led to an overtired, dysregulated 5 year old who hasn't learned how to communicate his feelings yet.

The setting and art direction would be darker than any of the previous in the series and more cyberpunk driven. 

You get an apartment that you can fill with winning races. This can be anything from a teddy bear that sits on your bed that would be like the Aphex twin teddy bears. A holographic statue. Posters. Different coffee tables.

To join multiplayer races, you walk in the third person and sit down at a table that has open seats, that other players will sit at.

You can customize your craft with liverys and put stickers on your helmet, change colors of suits, etc. elite helmets would have tubes coming off the back like predator. Upgrades for longer thrust, longer temporary shields, etc

If you wanted to challenge someone to one vs one, you can sit at the bar next to someone that has an open seat.

The tracks will all be on asphalt, rather than metal or other material that look like serving trays. This adds to the grit. 

It would make the Omega collection look like a kid's game.

Kingpin boss battles where they have completely different weapons that you must evade and use your brakes wisely to get behind them and fire upon.

Classic tracks to be included.

Soundtrack to feature:  
Future Sound of London  
Aphex Twin  
Skeemask  
Adam Pits  
Spray  
Konduku  
Polygonia  
Reeko  
Priori  
Spekki Webu  
James K (menu music)

1hjhabm,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1hjhabm/sleeping_better_with_spirituality/,Sleeping better with Spirituality ,"Found something that actually works after years of struggle.

I'm a anxious M(35) with long time 10+ years of sleep problems. Never getting more than a few hours of sleep per night, always struggling to fall asleep or stay asleep.

This is what I've been doing medication free to tame the anxiety, fall asleep faster, stay asleep and slowly recover:

1. Start reading about enlightenment
     -Jed McKenna Trilogy 
     -The Untethered Soul
     -Ask and it is Given
     -Love yourself like your Life 
        Depends on it.
     -The Short Path to Enlightenment 
     -The Sleep Book

For starters these books are a good base and can be read several times, and come in audio books for walks/work/travel/rest.

2. Quit all stimulants, nicotine, coffee, and anything that disrupts sleep such as alcohol and sugar.

3. Don't eat before bed, last meal should be early and at least 4 hours before bed.

4. Cut down on social media, it stimulates me personally and keeps me over thinking when I'm tired.

5. Start a passion project to distract and occupy my brain.

6. Meditation should be added here but I've been pretty relaxed about it.

Biggest thing as been separating myself from my thoughts, being more mindful, not trying to fight and control my brain, anxiety and sleep. 

Basically surrender. I found constantly trying to fix myself was causing almost all the extra anxiety that would keep my brain working when it needed to rest.

Still a work in progress but easily 60% better that it has been in 10 years.

First reddit post so I hope it helps someone on their journey to letting go.

1hjh9ka,https://www.reddit.com/r/onexindia/comments/1hjh9ka/im_tired_of_the_career_advantage_girls_get_over_us/,I'm tired of the career advantage girls get over us,"This is something I want to talk about but I'm afraid to get called a misogynist IRL, but I need to get it off my chest since it's been weighing on me, it's gonna be a long one so here goes.

I'm in the US pursuing Ms right now, but it's the same if not worse in India (because of the guys smping) 

To begin there are 2 types of advantages they have:

1) Official: The one where they have reserved quotas, special programs which gives them access to courses, events, conferences, training and resources for free. The exclusive scholarships, fellowships, grants and the DEI hiring system. 

2) Unofficial: The smping they receive from guys. Let it be help from their classmates, seniors, older bfs, husbands, heck the random people on LinkedIn who are more responsive to girls.

Not the official advantage can be easily quantified since there is a record. But the unofficial advantage (which I believe is more crucial) cannot be quantified or proven, nor most of them will acknowledge it. 

Last year I was the class I was in had girl with 40k followers on insta. We were told to explain some Instagram algorithms and the amount of misconception she had baffled me. I did an excellent job of explaining it in the class and even our professor was impressed with me. But you can guess who secured a social media strategists internship. Now she does have 40k followers unlike my 250, but then again how did she get those 40k followers? When I got the news of her getting an internship I congratulated her and asked her which company and she was reluctant to answer (which I didn't notice at first) saying ""it's a new company, it's a start up"". But after I asked repeatedly she gave me the name. I looked up the company and it was a new company, and didn't even have a careers page. 

Marketing of personal brand: A lot of influencers these days say that in this market having normal resume doesn't work anymore and you gotta market your own personal brand so recruiters can see you. Now tell me who's getting those 40k followers, certainly not me.

I saw a reel where this girl said ""I guarantee you,  you'll get a job/internship if you do coffee chats"". I've been doing coffee chats for 18 months (12 tbh cause kinda lost the hope and will after 12) and let me tell you the response rate a guy and a girl has on LinkedIn differs astronomically, lol I didn't even know/think of that and used to think LinkedIn is a professional place and not like Instagram. But my own females friends showede their LinkedIn accounts and I understand the difference we have. Those who have worked in corporate probably don't need any explanation for this. 

There's another Indian influencer girl who graduated with me (different university) and got a job at a big company as a product marketing manager.  If she advertises herself as a data scientist and a product management expert and creates content on how to start a career in this. I only have one question, if you really are expert on those subjects then why are you working as an pmm and not those roles? 

One of my friend was in his placements and the company had 2 coding questions in the test. My friend solved 1 and the 2nd partially. He got rejected. His 2 female classmates (who didn't solve even 1) were selected cause of the 'quota'.

Another friend of mine said in his freshman year/first year of college he and a girl (toppers) were called on stage to give a speech in English to thank the student committee who organized the event. He said it was on the spot and he managed to give an okay at best speech and then the other girl gave her speech and it was sooo good. ""I thought she must be very smart and have great public speaking skills to come up with such a speech in the spot. But later I found out that her bf is a senior on that committee and had told her to prepare a speech beforehand"". Now I don't care about the clout (or try not to) but these type of things set your image/performance/resume. 

Guys are 100% at fault for the unofficial advantage. Boys will smp head over heals for girls (mostly good looking ones or the ones who give them enough attention). Once my friend was making resume for his 'bestie' who he had feelings for. I mean creating it from scratch. And I liked the template he was using so I asked him that send the link to the template to me, ""khud dhundle ja"" no he wasn't joking. 

Just now I so a post on relationshipindia which prompted me to write this, 

"" I'm there for her 24×7. I've helped her emotionally, mentally, physically, sxually, financially and by all the other possible means. I've done her internship work. I've helped her secure internships at top notch places where one cannot even think of. But after all this, she's like, let's live in present. Marriage sounds claustrophobic for me, I'm just 23 etc etc. I've helped her make good connections in the field. Her CV is now best in her college. And now I feel that once she gets placed, she will kick me out from her life. ""

They have their seniors helping them who have more connections, experience, insider knowledge and overall a lot of factors which we just can't compare to. 

It's the same in my current class, it being a ms class has a lot of married people. And the girls get all sorts of perks from their husbands who are 2 3 years older than them and have been though this process first hand and are settled. If I had a wife who was junior to me I'd help her too, but this just ain't fair. 

I would have said ""we need to stop smping lvda lasn this that blah blah blah"" but we know that ain't happening. Even a small amount of smps will do enough for them, career boost to denge hi, ego boost denge vo alag. And we'll pay the price of both. 

Now the glass ceiling for women they talk about is real but that usually arrives at the base senior roles and not early to mid career. But they only cry about it and never acknowledge the advantages they have. 

I'm just tired of this shit, I don't want these privileges, I just want my honest work to reflect in my career. 

TL;DR: Frustrated with how women seem to have both official (quotas, scholarships, DEI hiring) and unofficial (help from smps, LinkedIn responses, social media clout) advantages in education and early careers. Shared personal examples of women benefiting from these perks despite less effort or merit, while men often struggle for recognition. Acknowledges that men contribute to this dynamic through smping but feels the imbalance is unfair, especially when women don’t acknowledge these advantages.",18,1734809574.0,onexindia,6,1.0,False
1hjh8eb,https://urlc.net/M-HD,My boyfriend has broken up with me but we are still living together until my new apartment is ready in 2 months does anyone have any advice on how best to manage this as I am really struggling?,"I’m sorry to hear you’re going through this, but remember there is a light at the end of the tunnel.

I agree with others that the most important thing to do is to set boundaries. Make it clear that this is a confusing and awkward situation and you just want to figure out some rules to make the best of it until you can go your separate ways. Hopefully, he is respectful of that.

I would think about the things that are causing you to struggle the most and go from there. Do you feel like you don’t have your own space? Do you feel like it is awkward to be in the same room and not talk? Do you feel like a guest in your own home? Is he brining other women home?

Maybe you ask him to not invite people over or you set up times for both of you to use the kitchen or be in the communal areas so you’re not on top of each other all the time. Maybe you need to talk and clear the air so you don’t feel so off kilter. But determine what you need and ask him to respect those in this frustrating and difficult time.

I would also find places you do feel comfortable in and be there as often as you can. If home doesn’t feel safe and comfortable, limit your time there as much as possible. Go to coffee shops, take a walk, do some self care outside of the home. Have as many positive and calming experiences as you can. But also try and find a personal space at home that is comforting. Don’t go out of your way to decorate, but if buying 30′ of string lights makes your space feel better so you’re not so overwhelmed at home, do it!",1,1734809475.0,EmilyFord2,0,1.0,False

I’ve been handling a crisis at hand that quite honestly, has reached its boiling point. You see, I couldn’t lie to myself and call myself a New Yorker unless I rode the subway or ate chopped BECheese at least four times a week, but something that my Deli Guy said to me yesterday really stuck on to me for longer that it really should have. 

So I waltzed into my go-to Deli like how I normally do, dripped out in my Tommy and J Crew, and ordered a Chopped BEC.
Now my deli guy and I go way back, ever since I moved to the hard and humbling streets of New York eight weeks ago. The guy doesn’t speak amazing English so I gesture and talk slowly to make sure he understands. 

He slid my BEC across the counter and looked me dead in my eyes and said in perfect English “you know, real New Yorkers don’t call it a BEC”

I stopped in place and really thought this guy was pranking me. “What do you mean? Everyone calls it a BEC my guy”.

He shook his head, pity in his eyes. “Nah. That’s how we know who’s not from here. It’s ‘baconeggandcheese,’ one word. No acronyms, no pauses. You’ve been outed, kid.”

I stood there, clutching my coffee cup, the reality sinking in. My whole life had been a lie. All the times I proudly said “BEC” like I was in on the lingo, and this whole time, I was just marking myself as a tourist with a Yankee cap.

And now? Now I’m stuck in existential dread, wondering if I’ll ever be accepted. Do I start saying “baconeggandcheese” now, or would that just make it worse? Is there a support group for this? I don’t know, but I sure as hell can’t show my face at that deli again.",12,1734809192.0,circlejerknyc,7,1.0,False
1hjh3ky,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1hjh3ky/a_taste_of_egypt_by_friendlyplanet/,"""A Taste of Egypt"" by FriendlyPlanet","Hi! I was interested in booking a group tour to Egypt a year ago and really struggled to find a comprehensive review of the options out there. I ended up booking FriendlyPlanet's ""A Taste of Egypt"" tour and I told myself I'd write everything out in case anyone was ever in my seat in the future. All in all, I really enjoyed my time but there were some real sticking points I'd like to highlight to people.

FriendlyPlanet itself: The website is easy to use and prices seem pretty competitive. Relative to comps, it's ""midtier""-- it's no Viking Cruises or whatever but it doesn't feel like econotour either. The handy document guides they put out do a nice job prepping you for what to expect when you hit Egypt. I did have a couple of annoying things about them to mention:

* The package includes flights on EgyptAir from JFK to CAI. I live five minutes from EWR, so I asked if I could swap out the JFK flight for an EWR flight. I offered to pay the difference in fare (if there was one) myself. FP said no and said they get bulk discounts on the flights which makes the whole package affordable. I dunno about this one. My group had 5 people in it (which is a positive!) but it made me wonder exactly what kind of bulk discount they were getting. I also offered to pay the difference. Like just transportation to JFK alone from where I live cost 200 bucks. Anyway...
* They booked all five members of the group on the same PNR. This made it really difficult for me to edit the reservation, such as to add my UA frequent flyer number or attempt to upgrade myself or even check-in online. Everything has to be done at the counter. On top of that, I could see the personal information (i.e. full names) of all the other people on the reservation. This really doesn't make sense to me.
* I did have one potential issue come up about a month away from the tour start date where I would need to be elsewhere (i.e. not NY) for work the day the tour would leave. I asked if I could just meet the tour same day after getting my own flight from elsewhere, I just asked if it meant my whole itinerary would be cancelled. They said it would be and was not possible. I asked a clarifying question and they never responded at all. I don't mean to be a diva and I am sounding more needy than I am but not responding to emails is really inexcusable.

They contract everything locally to a company called Wings and everything was pretty smooth. I'd say if I had one thing I really disliked was their tipping guidance. They gave a table with people's roles and a suggested tip per day. They did not tell me how many days, for example, I'd have an Egyptologist. So it was not helpful to know what I tip per day when I didn't know how many days. I know Egypt is place where tipping is important so I'd much rather them just tell me, ""Please send us $200 and we'll take care of everything.""

Then EgyptAir itself: yikes. On the JFK leg, I ended up upgrading myself to Business for $600. The food and service was actually pretty good. My seat in Business was broken and did not recline fully, but it was comfortable. The plane was hot AF. I couldn't stand it. And there is NO WIFI on the 77W they fly between JFK and CAI. This is insane to me. It's like going back to 2002.

Speaking of 2002, the app...dear god, the App. I know the US majors have great apps and US travelers get spoiled, but this app is just next level bad. Like it randomly stops working for weeks at a time.

Customer Service is awful. Like I am pretty sure it's 1 person working 9-5 M-F in an office in New York. I can only imagine what would happen if you really needed help; I just called because I wanted to add my Frequent Flyer Number. I called 2x, spent 25 minutes on hold, and got disconnected at least once per attempt.

I took 6 flights (JFK -> CAI, CAI -> ASW, ASW -> ABS, ABS -> ASW, LXR -> CAI, CAI -> JFK) and MS was on time for exactly 0 of them. The CAI -> JFK flight is a 4:30 AM (yes indeed) flight to JFK. The night before, at like 2 or 3PM, they delayed it to 7AM. Then they delayed it again until 8AM. Then we finally left at 8:35. But seriously. 0 for 6. They don't make announcements, they don't post notices, they don't have anything.

The itinerary: FP's itinerary feels like it could be optimized a little. It's packed and it feels like there are some things you could do to space things out a bit. It looks like this:

Day 1: Arrive to Cairo, nothing planned (I booked a food tour on my own and I loved it)

Day 2: Pyramids, Egyptian Museum, fly to Aswan at night. This may be unpopular but I kinda wish they replaced one of these flights with the sleeper train. That would be an experience. And six flights is a LOT. Especially on  EgyptAir. The other interesting thing is I went during the week daylight saving time changed so we went from GMT + 6 to GMT + 7. Getting adapted to the time was an experience.

Day 3: Optional excursion to Abu Simbel. You basically have to do this, it is so amazing. Everyone in the group did it. So I wondered-- why fly CAI -> ASW to sleep for like four hours and then fly ASW -> ABS (and back) instead of just flying CAI -> ABS? Then I checked and it's because there is nothing direct. So that kinda stinks. But this period just feels so hectic. You fly from CAI to ASW, then get to the hotel at like 10 or 10:30PM (surprise surprise, the flight was delayed). Then you get up at like 4:30 or 5AM to catch the ride to the airport. Then you fly and within 2 hours you are on your way back to the airport. Then they put you on a Nile Cruise. So in 3 days you've slept in 3 different beds and never really unpacked. We were going to do a felucca ride and some other stuff in Aswan but we got hit with a sandstorm (which honestly looked cool) so we were kinda trapped on the boat for the afternoon. The boat does not move this day.

Day 4: Some sightseeing in Aswan. The granite quarry is not really interesting. Phillae Temple, however, is. You have tea with a Nubian family in ""their house."" Pretty sure it was a coffee shop (the place said coffee shop on it) but I liked this a lot. The boat sails north a little bit to Edfu and then basically docks there overnight. You do see Kom Ombo and that is very neat. Night on the boat.

I should talk about the boat, by the way. They are very unimpressive. Like they're OK, and fun, but you should expect like a 2 or 3 star type hotel thing. The rooms are small. The amenities are pretty limited. Food is tasty but it's buffet style; you're not going to be blown away by what you're eating. Entertainment is like three dancers a night. There is an Egyptian themed night where everyone is encouraged to go buy Egyptian clothing from the store. There's an on-board jewelry store. I can't even imagine going on vacation and being like OMG JEWELRY FOR ME TO BUY but people in my party were hoovering it up. OK whatever lol. The massage guy is aggressively chasing you around the boat trying to get you to book a massage.

Day 5: Nothing all morning, boat sailed from Edfu to Luxor. This was a super enjoyable ride. It's 3-4 hours and you can watch the boat go through the lock and just relax before Karnak and Luxor temple. These are mind-blowing complexes and it will be 90000 degrees at each of them so rest up. Bring one of those wide brimmed hats. At Karnak, people were following me around trying to take my picture. I was ready for this but didn't think once and let someone take my picture. He insisted on a tip. 

Day 6: We did a hot air balloon ride in the morning. Oh my god it was amazing. Like really revelatory. But hope you are ready to wake up at 3:30 in the morning for the CHANCE. The guide said the prior 2 days the tour had been cancelled. Then you've got Valley of the Kings and Hatshepsut's temple. Both great.

Day 7: Go back to Cairo. You have a free day here but you should 100% do the optional excursions to Memphis and Sakkara. Sakkara in particular is really cool. There's a ""art gallery walking tour"" of the neighborhood in the evening...um you just walk down the street with the tour director (who admittedly was quite a bit of fun) and go to a restaurant for dinner. It was fun but note it costs $70! So I recommend doing all three packages and getting the discounted rate.

My thoughts on Egypt overall:

* The ""aggressiveness"" of the people was oversold before I got there. I was never REALLY harassed. Just walk forward and ignore the merchants. Like it is annoying that they purposefully direct you through the market at EVERY STOP but the government is trying to help feed these people. Just walk forward. Do not engage. If you do, that's it. Blood in the water.
* If you think you're going to be afraid of bargaining and you DO want to buy something, get it out of your head. I found it fun. Just know that the guy shouting ""habibi"" at you is not your friend. He's there to feed his family. That magnet he's trying to sell you for $25 is worth $1. Say $3 and settle on $8 and feel happy about it. You got a memory. If you are someone like one of my traveling companions so devastated by the anxiety of having to do this, then ask the guide to bring you to a place with fixed prices.
* My party was only 5 people. That's pretty good attention for your money. Our Egyptologist felt like part of the family and he was good company. When we went to the bazaar in Cairo on the last day and it was like meh ok who cares, we all just sat at a stand and he ordered Egyptian food for us and we sat there and ate and drank. That is what I want from my vacations.
* You need like SPF 9000 sunscreen. I don't care how well you tan or how dark you are, being in the desert with the sun bearing down on you for hours and hours is brutal. I brought one of those big floppy hats but I hated wearing it because it made my hair look messy for all my Instagram Influencer photos I wanted to take (kidding) but it did help to have it on.
* Go inside the great pyramid. Don't you want to say you did it? There's nothing to see in there by the way and you will come out COVERED in sweat (and people will have farted on you inside the pyramid for 20 minutes) but for posterity just do it. And smile.
* The Egyptian Museum felt kinda felt like it was in need of investment. I guess now the new one is opening. In the old one, there was no air conditioning and a lot of the displays and cabinets felt like they really needed touching up. 
* I was walking down the street in Zamalek when a moped / motorcycle grazed my leg right off the curb (I had actually just lost my balance and was in the street ""shoulder"" for a second). I was OK but he was barking at me for...I dunno, being in the way of his motorcycle.
* I think I might try to group the cities together better. That trip back to Cairo at the end just feels so exhausting by that point.

 first I will start with the way they arranged the enrolled subjects who the hell will enroll in 11 subjects to take them in 4 months with labs literally me and other students with me go to college 5 days a week and stay there for 7 hours taking classes non-stop and some people live away from college needing 2-3hrs just to get home and when we get home we continue taking online classes and I can't just skip a subject and enroll it in the next semester I can't this will make me wait a whole year without being able to enroll in other subjects  cause I skipped a subject (I hope for anyone reading this long yap to understand).

Second thing is we literally started taking exams at the third week of the semester I've been taking exams non stop I'm literally making this post while thinking of this week's exams and they don't have mercy at all they love to do a writing exam what is this MCQ exam this is for idiots(my professor's POV not mine) and it's not like they are good at teaching they just make us go to classes just to see how good they are at reading one of the professor's he give three classes in these 5 days of the week he didn't give use materials he just gave us links for books to read and it's not just one book or two they are five I don't hate the idea that I need to read and study them he is actually right but I hate how the arranged the subjects how they make lectures and exams schedules and we can't complain to anyone cause they don't give a damn 

There is that Dr she is very annoying she did a lot of things that I want to say but I wrote a lot (sorry and thank you) she took 75 students for a trip to a farm it was one of the useless trips I have ever had I couldn't skip it its worth is 10 marks out of 100 (I hope I don't fail her subject) we went at ""12pm I got home at 6:30pm and the next day I have a hard exam(the subject of the 5 books) I went to the exam without sleeping or eating with 4 coffee cups I felt like throwing up I was about to faint even though I studied really hard i didn't pass the exam 

They think we are robots and then they say that we don't study I as a human I have a personal life I have responsibilities other than studying I barely find time for my self the only thing they do is keep making us fail I really I had an exam with materials that no body taught us cause the Dr forgot to update the material on moodle and she didn't bother her self she literally asked us to make presentations in exam week and once I finish midterm exams(i didn't pass them) I will be starting my final exams as if I was a robot I want to die I feel like am suffocating 

There's lots of things that I didn't say but I will only write this for now ",0,1734809038.0,veterinaryschool,1,0.33,False

1hjgzc3,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultingph/comments/1hjgzc3/cutting_ties_with_my_longtime_discord_friend/,Cutting ties with my long-time discord friend. ,"I’ve been thinking about this decision for so long but I think there are really choices that linger in your mind, taking root, yet still feel impossible to act on. 

A little backstory, tambay kasi talaga ako sa discord. I live alone, away from my family and sometimes, it really does feel lonely and Discord was there to save the day. I made a lot of friends until I entered this one voice call where we met each other. 

Back in December 2022, I was 18 and I met this guy on a server on discord who eventually became a part of my everyday life. I shared so many things to him, may mga bagay na siya ang unang nakakaalam kesa sa main circle ko, may mga sikreto din akong siya lang ang may alam and that just shows how comfortable and open I was to him. He wasn’t just a friend; he was a constant. We’d talk every day, call for minutes or hours, and send each other the most mundane photo updates. This became our rhythm everyday.

But here’s the catch: we don’t know each other’s names, I don’t know where he studies (though he knows where I study, since I’ve been open about it), or even what we look like. By all conventional measures, we’re strangers. We never even exchanged socials—no Instagram, no Facebook, no connection outside of Discord. Our bond has existed entirely in that bubble, for two years. Yes, two years. 

Yet, when I think of everything I do know about him, I realize just how much he’s not a stranger. These are just among others but he’s from Cavite, has four siblings, a dog named Dashy, and is taking up radiologic technology. He has trypophobia, doesn’t drink coffee, but has developed a growing love for matcha—something I proudly take full credit for! And similar to me, he’s also drawn to the quiet of late-night walks and finds comfort in the simplicity of strawberry-flavored food. He plays the electric guitar, has a passion for streetwear, ukay, and above all, his personality mirrors mine in ways that are almost uncanny. He has told me several stories of him too!

Ang daming nangyari sa loob ng dalawang taon na yun and even though he was never there physically, he was present. He was there during the quiet moments of my life and the loud ones, too. We saw each other graduate from senior high school, step into college, and grow into the person we are now. Through heartbreaks and rainbows, we had each other’s backs.

We’ve thought about meeting up, of course. But I think that is one thing that excites and terrifies us both. But neither of us has been ready to take that step, and that’s okay. Ang dami lang tanong na naglalaro sa isipan ko. What if magbabago ang lahat if nagkita kami? What if yung connection pala na nabuo namin online ay iba pala sa totoong buhay? Pero paano din if magkita kami? What could be ahead of us? 

So why do I plan to cut ties with him? I don’t have an answer that feels good enough. But maybe because as I grow older, the idea na wala naman sigurong patutunguhan ito hits me hard? Or maybe there doesn’t have to be a reason. What I only know of is that he’ll always hold a special place in my heart, one stitched together with matcha-flavored memories, late-night calls, and all the small, unspoken ways he made life lighter.",1,1734808756.0,adultingph,0,1.0,False

1. Take pictures at all the tables and of the table not the back of people's head as the bride and groom visit. Let the photographer know you are doing this to keep you on schedule.

2. If you are getting hair and make-up done consider a pretrial for everyone. If your mothers' or bridesmaids' don't want their's done that is better because it avoids a time crunch.

3. The garter and bouquet toss might be arcane but it lets people know who is single--enhances the mingle.

4. If you have a sit down dinner, be sure to put chicken, beef or fish on the place cards. People don't remember and its rude to the wait staff. Also tell caterers you want coffee pots on the tables.

5. A venue that also serves and provides food makes things simpler, like renting chairs, tables, ect.. Also get a day of the event planner....not fair to bridesmaid/groomsman and family to put everything in their lap. THey want to have fun too. 

6. Keep the rehearsal dinner as light as possible, buffet or hors doeurvres you don't want people super wasted before the wedding.

7. Keep toasts and speeches to a minimum, and check them prior. 

That's about it. Be sure you set yourself up to have a great time. ",3,1734808577.0,weddingplanning,0,1.0,False

I (17F) recently broke up with my boyfriend, Jake (18M), and now he’s telling everyone I’m overreacting and ""making a big deal out of nothing."" I’m starting to wonder if I handled it wrong, so I need some outside opinions.  

Jake and I had been dating for about a year. At first, things were great—he was super sweet, always texting to check in and planning cute dates. But over time, his behavior started to feel…intense. He’d get upset if I didn’t respond to his texts immediately or if I spent time with my friends without him.  

A few months ago, Jake asked me to share my location with him “so he’d know I was safe.” I thought it was a little weird, but he framed it as being protective, so I agreed. At first, it wasn’t a big deal, but then he started using it to question me constantly.  

For example If I went to the mall with my friends, he’d text, “Why didn’t you tell me you were going to the mall?” Or If I stopped at a coffee shop after school, he’d call and ask who I was with. Once, I went to a family dinner, and he got upset because I “didn’t tell him in advance.”  

It got to the point where I felt like I couldn’t go anywhere without explaining myself to him. When I brought it up, he’d say things like, “I just worry about you because I love you so much” or “If you have nothing to hide, why does it bother you?”  

The final straw came last week. I was at a friend’s house working on a group project, and he texted me asking why I was “still there” because it was “late” (it was 8:30 PM). When I didn’t respond immediately, he showed up at my friend’s house uninvited. He said he “wanted to make sure I was okay,” but I was embarrassed and felt humiliated in front of my friends.  

After that, I told him we needed to talk. I explained that I felt like he was crossing boundaries and that I wasn’t comfortable with him tracking my every move. He got defensive and said I was being dramatic, that he was just “trying to be a good boyfriend.” 

When I said I wanted to end things, he started crying and begging me to stay, saying he’d “never do it again.” But I was done. Now, he’s telling our mutual friends that I broke up with him for “caring too much” and making me look like the bad guy.  

So, AITA for breaking up with him?  ",2,1734808498.0,AITAH,6,1.0,False

Yesterday, I had a call with my paid community that was a great example of why I love the Calendar so much.. it was a bit chaotic or thanks to John Felice a bit ZESTY, but really packed full of gold.. (their words not mine lol)

But I had a couple pause moments where I had that realization of how grateful I am for [Skool](https://honeysyed.com/skool), especially the fun factor and how much FREEDOM it gives me.

One of the moments was where I was explaining that there may be noise in the background for a few seconds, because I was making a balloon animal (technically, a balloon sword) for my little one. Like this is a paid community call and I have set up my life in a way that allows me to pause and make sure my little one is still feeling like his mommy is here for him too. Being a present mom is part of why I do this and it was great to have that awareness moment. (I've had it once before when I was having a coffee chat standing on top of a dump truck load of sand/dirt.)

The other moment was when one of the members was listing off a recap of what we had gone through and they used the nickname the group has created for me which is GOATmother. Now.. I don't fully know how this nickname came about. I just woke up one day and saw I was getting called the ""GOATmother"" in comments and posts. But it's a reminder that one of the fun parts of a community is these inside jokes or nicknames, and this is likely something that would not happen outside of a fun platform like Skool.

Today, I saw that a member had made a Loom sharing his level 5 key takeaway, while playing the guitar because someone else challenged him to do it. It was so cool to me that I threw it on my About Page. Why not?

Then a pop up coffee chat led to one client practicing a pitch and it led to them getting their first $99/m paying member. All while I had kids begging for more peaches in the background lol There are no chiseled in stone rules of how to make this ""work"". You have freedom to be creative and be fun. To test things out and to show up authentically.

Skool is the perfect place to really grow something that is fun, while creating a life that you want. Living the lifestyle you couldn't have elsewhere. I think that comes a lot from the calendar feature... but what do you think?

What is your Skool GOATfeature?

Karan, twenty and perpetually fueled by instant coffee, navigated the chaotic hallways of his college hostel. Books clutched to his chest, he was a typical second-year engineering student, until he stumbled into Dr. Rajeev Sharma’s introductory thermodynamics lecture. Rajeev, a junior lecturer with a thoughtful gaze and a knack for explaining complex concepts with disarming simplicity, was instantly captivating.

It wasn't Rajeev's impressive knowledge alone that drew Karan in. There was a warmth in his voice, a gentle humour that surfaced during lectures, making even the most daunting equations seem approachable. Karan found himself lingering after class, asking questions, the genuine curiosity masking a deeper fascination. Rajeev, in turn, responded with patience, occasionally sharing anecdotes about his own college days, a hint of a shared past bridging their student-teacher divide.

The college became their unintentional cupid. Late nights studying in the library saw them occasionally share a table, the silence punctuated by soft whispers about coursework that slowly morphed into discussions about music, movies, and dreams. The campus cafeteria became another familiar meeting ground, the shared tables a stage for shy smiles and stolen glances over lukewarm coffee.

Slowly, subtly, the initial admiration blossomed into something more profound. Karan found himself looking forward to Rajeev's lectures with an eagerness that surprised him.

Let's face it, nobody enjoys the embarrassment of bad breath. It can make social interactions awkward, and it can signal underlying health issues. One common question people have is: can tooth decay cause bad breath? The answer isn't a simple yes or no, it's a bit more nuanced than that. This article will delve deep into the connection between tooth decay, oral hygiene, and halitosis (the fancy medical term for bad breath), exploring the causes, symptoms, and solutions. We'll also cover related topics like gum disease, dry mouth, and the role of diet in maintaining fresh breath. Think of your mouth as a miniature ecosystem – everything is interconnected, and a small problem in one area can have ripple effects throughout. So, let's dive in and unlock the secrets to a healthier, fresher smile!

Can Tooth Decay Cause Bad Breath?
---------------------------------

The short answer is: absolutely! But to understand *why* tooth decay leads to bad breath, we need to look at the bigger picture. Tooth decay, also known as dental caries or cavities, happens when bacteria in your mouth feast on the sugars and starches from the food you eat. This bacterial feast produces acids that attack the tooth enamel, creating those pesky little holes we all dread. Now, these holes provide the perfect hiding place for more bacteria, and as they multiply, they release volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs). These VSCs are the real culprits behind that unpleasant odor. Think of it like a tiny garbage dump in your mouth – the more decay, the more garbage, and the worse the smell.

### How Cavities Contribute to Bad Breath

Here's a breakdown of how cavities contribute to bad breath:

1. **Food Trap:** Cavities create tiny crevices and pits in your teeth. These act as traps for food particles, which then become a buffet for odor-causing bacteria.
2. **Bacterial Growth:** The trapped food provides a breeding ground for bacteria, leading to a build-up of plaque and further decay.
3. **VSC Production:** As these bacteria break down the trapped food, they release those dreaded VSCs, the primary source of bad breath.
4. **Infection:** In severe cases, untreated cavities can lead to infections, further exacerbating bad breath. This is where that metallic, almost sickly sweet smell can come from.

### Beyond Cavities: Other Oral Health Culprits

While cavities are a significant contributor to bad breath, they aren't the only culprit. Other oral health issues can also play a role:

- **Gum Disease (Periodontal Disease):** This infection of the gums can create pockets between the gums and teeth, also trapping food and bacteria. Gum disease often has a distinct, and rather unpleasant, odor.
- **Dry Mouth (Xerostomia):** Saliva is a natural cleanser, washing away food particles and bacteria. When your mouth is dry, this cleaning process is hampered, leading to bad breath.
- **Oral Thrush:** A yeast infection in the mouth, often characterized by white patches, can also cause bad breath.
- **Tonsil Stones:** These small, calcified deposits that form in the crevices of your tonsils can harbor odor-causing bacteria.

""SECRET of Fresh breath https://freepage.pro/samutores/freshbreath""

Can Tooth Decay Cause Bad Breath? A Deeper Look at the Connection
-----------------------------------------------------------------

We've established that tooth decay can indeed cause bad breath, but let's dig a little deeper into the *why*. Imagine your mouth as a bustling city. When everything's running smoothly, the sanitation department (saliva) keeps things clean, preventing garbage (food particles) from piling up. But when a pothole appears (cavity), it disrupts the flow, creating a breeding ground for, well, let's just call them ""unpleasant residents"" (bacteria).

### The Role of Bacteria

Bacteria are single-celled organisms that live everywhere, including your mouth. Some are beneficial, helping to break down food and maintain a healthy oral environment. Others, however, are opportunistic little troublemakers. When given the chance – like a cozy little cavity to hide in – they multiply and wreak havoc, producing those foul-smelling VSCs. It's like letting a teenager loose in a kitchen unsupervised - bound to be a mess!

### Why Are VSCs So Smelly?

VSCs contain sulfur, an element known for its pungent odor (think rotten eggs). These compounds, including hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan, are the primary source of the unpleasant odor associated with bad breath. Interestingly, the type of bacteria and the food they're feasting on can influence the specific type of VSC produced, leading to variations in the smell of bad breath.

Can Tooth Decay Cause Bad Breath? Preventing and Treating the Issue
-------------------------------------------------------------------

So, what can you do about it? Fortunately, there are plenty of effective strategies for preventing and treating bad breath caused by tooth decay and other oral health issues.

### Preventing Bad Breath

- **Brush and Floss Regularly:** This is your front-line defense against bad breath. Brushing twice a day and flossing daily removes food particles and plaque, depriving those odor-causing bacteria of their sustenance.
- **Use Mouthwash:** An antimicrobial mouthwash can help kill bacteria and freshen your breath. Choose an alcohol-free version to avoid drying out your mouth.
- **Stay Hydrated:** Drinking plenty of water helps to wash away food particles and keep your mouth moist, promoting saliva production.
- **Eat a Healthy Diet:** Limiting sugary and starchy foods reduces the fuel for bacteria. Crunchy fruits and vegetables can also help to naturally clean your teeth.
- **Regular Dental Checkups:** Visiting your dentist for regular cleanings and checkups is crucial for detecting and treating cavities early on, before they become a major source of bad breath.

### Treating Bad Breath Caused by Tooth Decay

- **Fillings:** Your dentist can fill cavities to seal off those bacterial hideouts, preventing further decay and eliminating the source of the bad breath.
- **Root Canals:** For more severe cases of decay, a root canal may be necessary to remove the infected pulp and save the tooth.
- **Extractions:** In some instances, a severely decayed tooth may need to be extracted. While this is a last resort, it can eliminate the source of infection and bad breath.
- **Treatment for Gum Disease:** Your dentist can perform deep cleanings and other procedures to treat gum disease, reducing inflammation and eliminating pockets where bacteria can thrive.
- **Addressing Dry Mouth:** If dry mouth is a contributing factor, your dentist can recommend strategies for increasing saliva production, such as using saliva substitutes or chewing sugar-free gum.

Lifestyle Choices and Bad Breath
--------------------------------

Beyond oral hygiene, your lifestyle choices can also impact your breath. Smoking, for example, not only stains your teeth but also dries out your mouth and increases your risk of gum disease, all of which can contribute to halitosis. Certain medications can also cause dry mouth, so it's important to discuss this with your doctor. What you eat plays a role as well. Foods like garlic, onions, and coffee can linger on your breath long after you've finished eating.

### The Link Between Diet and Breath

Think of your digestive system as a long tube. When you eat something with a strong odor, those odor compounds are absorbed into your bloodstream and eventually released through your lungs when you exhale. This is why brushing your teeth alone won't completely eliminate the smell of garlic or onions. While these odors are temporary, they can be quite potent!

Conclusion: Breathing Easy Again
--------------------------------

So, can tooth decay cause bad breath? Undoubtedly! But the good news is that by understanding the connection between oral health and halitosis, you can take proactive steps to prevent and treat bad breath. By practicing good oral hygiene, visiting your dentist regularly, making healthy lifestyle choices, and addressing underlying medical conditions, you can breathe easy knowing your smile is healthy and fresh. Remember, a healthy mouth is more than just a pretty smile; it's a vital part of your overall well-being. Don't let bad breath hold you back – take charge of your oral health and enjoy the confidence that comes with a fresh, clean smile.",1,1734807659.0,FreshBreathChampion,0,1.0,False
1hjglax,https://www.reddit.com/r/singing/comments/1hjglax/last_night_while_singing_christmas_carols_my/,"Last night, while singing Christmas carols, my limited voice suddenly went BIG. I'm confused.","I've always enjoyed singing, but I only sang with others or in private because my voice has a limited range with little control. Fine for pop music and showers, but not in any way a solo voice.  
  
Yesterday evening I attended a community caroling event anchored by a choir, where I placed myself at the very back of the crowd, just like normal, so any mistakes I made wouldn't compete with the choir. I was shocked when my voice sounded better than I can recall it being for literally 50 years, since I was briefly in a choir at age 18 (yes, I'm 68 now). What amazed me most was when I sang the full range of ""O Holy Night"" with good volume, without any dropouts, and without consciously straining for the high notes. It felt like it just flowed out of me. But it gets even weirder: I was belting a few of the songs, with more power and clarity than I can recall ever having before. Still more weirdness: Not only did folks around me notice (making me worry I was off-key), but even the choir director turned around! My voice has never projected so well (and it doesn't carry far when I shout). No, I don't have a recording of the evening, so all this is subjective. But it sure felt real at the time!

What the heck? I simply showed up and sang. No warmup (which I don't really remember how to do). Perhaps the songs were ordered to implicitly provide a warmup? I don't know. The evening weather was nothing special for winter in San Diego, about 55F and 60% humidity. I hadn't yet eaten dinner, and I had no alcohol in my system. Everyone was standing.

I had next to no voice when I woke this morning, but no soreness either, and my speaking voice fully returned by the time I finished my first cup of coffee. My neck felt slightly tired, but not significantly. I did have a little phlegm in my upper lungs, but that's not unusual for me the morning after any workout (I'm a triathlete). At the moment (11 AM), my voice feels like its old, limited self. Whatever happened last night hasn't persisted.

Was this just ""a really lucky day"", a ""one and done"" experience to file as a fun memory then move on? Or does this mean I should take my voice more seriously, and consider putting some time and effort into exploring it? I don't really ""need"" a better voice, as I'm not musically inclined: I can't read sheet music, I'm clueless on music theory (I can't intuitively harmonize), I can't play an instrument (unless you include banging out chords on a ukulele). I have zero musical ambition. It would be nice to sing better, but I wouldn't want anything more than that.

Thoughts? Advice? Should I find another caroling event to see if lightning strikes twice?

1hjgjbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/yogurtmaking/comments/1hjgjbt/todays_experiment_with_a_lowish_cost_canadian/,Today's experiment with a low(ish) cost Canadian winter method,"Step One -- Yesterday evening, in the metal inner pot of an instant pot, (for these purposes, I'll call it a ""pot liner""),  I mixed 3 litres of water with 300 grams of non-instant skim milk powder and 200 grams of non-instant whole milk powder. I used my immersion blender to mix it as well as I could, but since the powder is non-instant it was hard to get all the lumps out at this stage.

Step two -- I used the boil feature of the yogurt function on the instant pot to heat the water until the machine went beep. My machine seems to beep at about 80 C.  I used the immersion blender to mix the milk again to remove any remaining lumps.  I forgot to let it stay at that temperature for 20 minutes today, but I usually try to do this.

Step three.  I filled the kitchen sink with cold water and plunged the pot liner of heated milk into it.  I monitored the temperature of the milk constantly until it got down to about 45 C.  This took about 10 minutes, maybe.  While doing this, I took about 1/3 cup of commercial yogurt and put it in a cup, mixed it with a couple of ladle-fuls of the cooling milk, and whisked it until smooth.

Step 4 -- When the milk had cooled to about 45, I put the potliner back into the instapot and stirred the mixture a few times.   Then I dumped the commercial yogurt/milk mixture into the batch of cooled milk and used my immersion blender to incorporate.

Step 5 -- I covered the potliner and turned on the yogurt setting of the instant pot to 24 hours. I sometimes cover with an ordinary pot lid, sometimes with the tight-fitting lid that comes with the Instapot.  Either one is fine with me, but yesterday I happened to use the tight-fitting instant pot lid.  Then I went to sleep.

Step 6 -- In the morning.  I checked to see whether the mixture had thickened.  It had, so I put the lid back on and took the entire instant pot outside and placed it on my front porch so that the mixture could cool down. During inclement weather I put it in our unheated garage. It was -13 C today so I kept the pot outside for 2 hours. I probably could have kept it out there for another hour.

Step 7 -- I have a fine mesh splatter shield that I put over my frying pan when cooking bacon. Today, after I brought the pot back inside, I decided to try putting the splatter shield over the top of the pot liner and inverting them both over a salad bowl.  It worked!  The whey trickled from the pot, through the shield, into the salad bowl.  I let it strain for only two hours because I was impatient.

The end result was a bit lumpy but a brief whisking solved that easily.  The end result was not too tart (which I prefer) and had a pleasant custard-like texture.

Lessons learned -- 1) I used 100 more grams of milk powder for the same amount of water than any of my previous batches, and I think this contributed to the pleasant texture.  I think using some whole milk powder helped too. I wonder if I should try even more next time. 2) I would definitely put the instant pot outside again to cool the mixture after incubation. I generally hate winter but like finding positive uses for it.  3) The splatter shield was a far more pleasant straining method than my previous method -- a not-very-fine mesh strainer lined with coffee filters.  If I decide to continue with the splatter shield method, I might buy a shield to use only for yogurt making. Ikea sells one for 8 bucks.",1,1734807506.0,yogurtmaking,0,1.0,False

Plus we all know the stereotype of redditors but I want to be positive and optimistic. And here goes, my current show is entering post early in 2025 and I’m looking for a Post PA. Have gotten some recs but a lot of them are either a nepotism or political hire. Looking for someone, new, hungry and eager to learn. No experience is necessary. I mean come on it’s a PA position it’s supposed to be entry level. Kind of irks me when people say they’re looking for a PA and then want someone with 5 projects under their belt. I’ve always found that someone’s desire to learn and hard work is a lot of times better than experience. Duties below:

- lunch runs 
- the occasional coffee run (we’re on a studio lot so won’t require driving)
- Accounting stuff (reconciling receipts, cashed)
- Copying and printing material
- knowledge of FileMaker, aspera etc.

There’s a few other things but that’s the general overview. Also be personable. Hours are long but the team is chill. The last thing I wanna do is bring someone in who doesn’t get along with our team. Believe it or not but the whole post team actually like each other.

Most important, be discrete. The material is pretty high profile so you have to be trusted with discretion and not talking about the material. Also you will deal with some high profile people so being able to be professional is very important.

If any of this sounds interesting to you or you know someone who might be a good fit, please DM.

Who knows this could be a cool story. A Reddit or begins their career off a Reddit post.

At the end of this post is a link to my blog, where this story was originally posted. 

*For the authors and educators who taught me and inspired me:*  
*Laird Barron, Tim Hickson, and Brandon Sanderson, Thank you.*  
  
I woke up and wished I hadn’t. The white popcorn ceiling of my apartment stared back at me as baleful morning light spilled in through the window, leaving the shadows from my blinds to dance against the wall and floor.

I lay there for what felt like hours, struggling to process, but it couldn’t have been more than a few minutes. Habit pulled me from bed, but the usual morning routine couldn’t pull me from my mental funk.

The warm rhythm of my shower was more oppressive than comforting, breaking the fog only long enough to get me through a breakfast I didn’t taste, and a cup of coffee, which tasted terrible. The caffeine brought with it enough thought for me to call into work, but not so much for me to realize I didn’t need to. They wouldn’t be expecting me.

When my boss picked up the phone on the second ring, I was only mildly suprised. He was the type. “Superior Imprints.” His voice, usually animated and full of enthusiasm, was dead this morning. It told me all I needed to know.

“It’s John. I can’t come in today. Sorry.” My words were stilted. Unbalanced. He should have asked if I were okay. If I was sick. Normally he would have. But this morning, he didn’t ask for an excuse, and I didn’t offer one. Was he fingering the gun he kept in his drawer? If he was, I wondered what he’d use it for.

“That’s fine. Probably going to be slow, anyway.” The response was curt, and stung a little. It wasn’t goodbye. No farwell. Just the click as he hung up.

I stared out the kitchen window, eyes looking at nothing, and taking in everything. It felt like I was watching the world through someone else’s eyes. Like “John” had taken the back seat to his own life. Like he was third person in a first person story. All sense of control was gone. There was only a sinking feeling in my chest, and the vague but powerful fear that the couch might swallow me if I sat down on it.

“Resistance is futile.” The words felt honest, but they broke through my fugue and brought a faint smile to my lips. Star Trek had always held a special place in my heart. Men like Kirk and Picard were men of action. Men of hope…

Before the gloom could overwhelm me again, I moved towards the front closet and and the inevitable tubs of personal history one collects over a lifetime.

Rays of sunlight spilled in from the front window and illuminated the clear plastic boxes, revealing their contents. I’d inherited most of these from my grandmother, who had insisted on keeping every damn homework assignment, science project poster, baseball trophy, and merit badge. ‘you’ll appreciate it when you get older.’ she’d said. At the time I’d believed her, but now, looking over the piles of half-forgotten memories and achievements, all I saw was junk.

I left the pile of memorabilia scattered across the floor instead, pulling out the box of camping equipment. I’d thrown out the tent and sleeping bag years ago, after a raccoon had clawed its way in looking for food. When it hadn’t found any, it left a pile of feces behind, presumably to mark its displeasure. Despite my best attempts, I’d never managed to get the smell out.

The memory brought another faint smile to my face. All I’d been able to articulate then was a series of curses. Now, though, I could see the humor.

I double checked the box’s contents before changing into something appropriate for the outdoors in late October and I didn’t bother to lock the door behind me as I left.

The city was unnaturally quiet as I wove through the streets. Traffic was light, the usual pattern of Tuesday morning gridlock was broken, reduced to a few vehicles slowly meandering between lanes, unmolested by the sounds of police sirens and honking horns.

My old Toyota was the loudest thing on the road, coughing and spluttering the way cars do after a few hundred thousand miles. It was an ancient old lady of a car, more noble of spirit perhaps than its rust and dents would suggest. Frail in a way most cars never got, but with more life inside than most would suspect. Another inheritance from my grandmother, though this one was more welcome.

The gas stations were all closed, so I settled for a small neighborhood market with a fuel pump on the other side of the parking lot. It was open, though a glance at the rows of empty spaces would have suggested otherwise. The only signs of life were a beige Ford Fiesta, and a panhandler slumped in a green camping chair near the front doors.

The vagrant was filthy, his clothes ragged. His long beard and hair gave him the look of a shipwreck survivor, a year or two into his exile. The six-pack of beer at his feet, and the lost, glazed expression on his face, did nothing to help his sloven appearance. A beaten sign over his chest read “THE END IS NIE” in bold sharpie. The irony, and the misspelling, tugged at some dark recess of my soul and I snorted as I walked inside.

The market was empty except for the lone cashier who sat drooping behind her checkout counter, phone clutched to one ear while tears ran unrestrained down her face. I didn’t approach, instead shifting my focus to the aisles of food. Black marks crisscrossed the floor, the graffiti of the inanimate. The closest a shopping cart could come to saying, “I was here.” I followed them, collecting what I needed before making my way back to the clerk.

Her eyes were bloodshot and puffy, but she wasn’t crying anymore. She finished her call with, “I’ve got to let you go, mom. I’ll call you back in a few minutes. Yeah. I love you too.” before sniffling for a moment. “Sorry. Not a good day.”

“Not a good day.” I agreed. It was the understatement of the century.

She began scanning the items in my cart. The mild bleeps interrupted the soft buzz of fluorescent lights.

“Want to talk about it?” I asked.

She shook her head, and I tried not to let relief show on my face.

“Not really.” she said, smiling a fragile, sad sort of smile. “Thanks though.”

“No problem.” We packed the food away into plastic bags, and I offered her a twenty.

“Don’t worry about it. It’s on the house.” she said.

“You sure?”

She nodded and tapped the name tag that marked her as a manager. “You’ve been the only customer this morning. Besides, I needed the distraction.” She tried to smile, but the effort filled her eyes with tears.

“You sure… Cheryl?” I asked, after another glance at her name tag. This time, I wasn’t asking about the items.

Her eyes didn’t meet mine, but she glanced at something beneath the counter. A gun probably. “I’m sure. Just pass it along.”

“I’ll do that.” I placed the bagged items in my cart and turned to leave before hesitating. *What would Picard do?* It was a silly thought, completely irrelevant. But still, I couldn’t bring myself to do nothing.

“Maybe I’m overstepping, but if my family were still alive, I’d be with them right now.” I said. Then I shuffled out the electric doors into the parking lot and told myself it wasn’t my business.

The fresh morning air kissed my face with its chill, though the touch wasn’t invigorating. The panhandler didn’t share my disposition toward the cold. He was more aware now, and his eyes followed me as I walked out. Some hateful and bitter impulse caused me to toss the twenty into his cup. He stared at it for a moment before meeting my gaze, eyes dancing with mirth. Then he began cackling. His choked, wheezing laughter followed me across the parking lot and to the gas pump, only ending as I drove away with a full tank.

The city let me go without further incident, and the hours ticked by in a comfortable haze. As the temperature warmed, I rolled the windows down and breathed in the crisp, clean October air. The forest on either side passed in a hypnotic blur of green, orange, and brown as I made my way down the abandoned highway.

It had been years since my last joyride. Since college at least and the miles upon miles of empty road beckoned me forward like a lover, tempting me to put the pedal to the metal. I didn’t go above seventy. Laws are there for a reason, and I’m not an animal. Besides, my Toyota couldn’t handle those speeds anymore.

I followed the road, turning off at random as the whim took me and mostly obeyed the speed limit. My tank was half empty before I saw anyone else.

She was walking on the shoulder in tired tennis shoes, blue jeans and an olive blouse that neatly contrasted her pale skin and red hair.

She didn’t put her thumb up, but I slowed to a halt a few yards ahead and waited for her to catch up. “You need a ride?”

She stared at me for a moment, then nodded. “I’d appreciate it.” Her soft soprano had the same distant and exhausted quality that Cheryl’s had. That I suspected mine had. I unlocked the doors, and she got in without hesitation.

“Going anywhere specific? Nearest city is about ten miles from here, I think.”

She shook her head. “I’m just wandering. Where are you going?” She didn’t have a bag with her.

“Camping. Can’t bring myself to care where at.”

She smiled, and sunlight glinted off her white teeth. “I haven’t been camping in years.” she said.

“Would you like to come along?”

The smile fell. “I’m not sure. Would it be okay if I just rode with you for a while? I just…” Her voice trailed off.

“Need to get away?” I finished. She nodded. “I won’t mind the company. I’m John.”

“Rachel.” she replied, holding out a semi-calloused hand for me to shake. Her grip was delicate but firm.

“Pleased to meet you, Rachel.”

We rode in silence, letting the afternoon pass in a melancholy kaleidoscope of fall hues. I kept the windows rolled down. Rachel didn’t seem to mind, instead resting her arm there while she stared into nothing; lost in thought. I liked the way her curls danced when the wind ran through them.

Evening was approaching by the time the fuel light came on again. “Do you want me to drop you off somewhere?” I asked. She looked momentarily confused by the question. “I’m not looking to get rid of you, but I think we’re about to run out of gas.”

“Final call, huh?” She smiled, but it seemed weak. “I’m good, if you are.”

We drove the last few miles until at last the Toyota wheezed and died. “End of the road.” I said, pulling over and parking the car on the shoulder. Rachel unbuckled and slid out, stretching her legs to help the circulation.

I opened the back door and removed the box of camping equipment, putting the remaining jerky, trail mix, and a few bottles of water inside. With the plastic tub firmly in hand, I gestured to our surroundings. “Pick a hill.”

There were only two. The last handful of miles had led us onto a stretch of highway and into a gorge. Blue shadows clashed with orange light painting us in contrasting hues. Rachel looked around before settling on the hill facing towards the setting sun. “I hope you don’t mind a hike.” she said.

“I’m the one wearing boots.”

She looked at her feet and made a face, and I laughed. After a few seconds, her face eased into a smile and she laughed too.

My arms ached by the time we reached to top. The hike hadn’t taken long, maybe ten minutes, but the box of equipment was heavy and I was glad to be rid of it.

We settled in a small clearing on the opposite side of the hill from the road. Together, we gathered branches and twigs, dousing them in lighter fluid and setting them alight. With the first match, the flames sprung to life, dancing victoriously over the wood.

She fed the fire bits of the paper plates while I rolled out the blanket. It was a massive red scraggly thing, made of wool and polyesters. I owned more comfortable, softer, and less ragged blankets, but in my stupor I hadn’t thought to bring them.

“God, it’s been years since I’ve done this.” she said.

“Since you’ve done what? Got in a car with a stranger and joined him on his impromptu and ill advised camping trip?”

She snorted. “You are an ass, aren’t you? No, that part is new. I meant camping in general. Last time I went was probably in highschool with my dad. Pass me the trail mix?”

I tossed her the bag, grabbing a bottle of water for myself before sitting with my back to a gnarled oak. “Sorry, I didn’t bring anything else. I figured there wasn’t much need.”

“It’s fine. I didn’t think to bring anything with me when I left home this morning.” Rachel said as she moved to sit next to me. Our humble camp overlooked a valley with a river running through it. In the light, the water resembled Japanese kintsugi, holding the fractured land together.

As she sat down, she rested her head on my shoulder, and with only a moment’s hesitation, I wrapped my arm around her waist. She didn’t mind, instead scooting closer. We watched, eating our jerky and trail mix, as the sun sank behind the distant mountains and painted the sky orange and pink.

I broke our comfortable silence. “When did you know?”

She took a deep breath and let it out. “When I woke up. You?”

“The same. I almost didn’t get out of bed.”

“I couldn’t stay home. I couldn’t process, couldn’t think.”

“First thing I did after breakfast was call into work. My boss was there.”

She laughed, but it was a sad thing, born of pity. “End of the world, and you go to work. At least he’s dedicated.”

“Yeah.” I agreed. “I feel bad for him. His family too. I wonder if he wasn’t in shock. Maybe we all are.” Silence crept in as we watched the sun begin its final descent. The last it would ever have.

“You have any family?” Rachel asked.

I shook my head, not looking away from the sunset. “Mom died when I was young. Dad was never in the picture. Both of my grandparents passed a couple of years ago. You?”

“None I wanted to spend my last day with. Do you miss them?”

“Every day. As a kid, I did this a lot. Mom worked hard, but we never had much money. Camping was a cheap. At least, it was if we could borrow my grandfather’s equipment.”

“How’d she die?”

“Breast cancer. I was twelve.” We didn’t speak for another few minutes. She clearly didn’t want to discuss her family, and I had more tact than to pry. The sun fell behind the horizon, leaving only purple and blue. Even that faded, and stars peeked out, illuminating the night.

“So many stars, I wonder what will happen to them.” she mused.

“No idea.” I replied. The soft current of the wind rustled the leaves and blew the smoke of the campfire away from us. The flames danced and whirled in the breeze, bathing us in an orange glow while the logs hissed and crackled.

“Why did you pick me up?” she asked.

I considered for a few minutes before responding. “There was store manager, Cheryl. This morning she gave me the jerky and trail mix, asked me to pass it on.” I stoked the flames and added another branch. That wasn’t the real reason. “Why did you get in the car with me?”

“I didn’t want to die alone.”

“Yeah. That too.” I turned my head to the sky and watched as the last bits of sunlight surrendered to the night. The trillions of lights in the Milky Way twinkled in silent contrast. “Did you ever come to terms with this? On your walk, I mean. ”

“No. I’m not sure you can process the end of everything.” Her face hid in the shadow of her hair, but there was a wistful, amused quality to her voice. As though she thought the idea of the world ending a kind of sad joke. Maybe it was. “What about you?”

“No. Do you think it’s always been like this?” I asked.

“Like what?”

“So much time wasted. So many things left undone. And then it’s over.”

“Probably. Sad as it is. What do you wish you’d done?” she asked.

“That’s the thing. I don’t know. I guess I just want *more*.” I snorted. “It makes me sound greedy.”

“Not greedy. Just human.”

The moon rose in all its luminescent glory, and we watched as the river in the valley below morphed into a vein of liquid silver. The distant snow-covered peaks appeared crystalline in the light, and I wondered what miracle of physics could have caused such a beautiful scene.

Rachel shifted next to me, snuggling even closer. She was soft and warm. The flickering shadows cast by the flame gave her a mystic quality, and her emerald eyes sparkled as they met mine. My throat tightened, and my heartbeat thumped faster in my chest. I took a deep breath, and asked in a soft low tone, “May I kiss you?”

It was a selfish thing to ask, said as much out of fear, desperation, and loneliness as desire. She didn’t hesitate and kissed me softly. We made love with only the stars as witnesses. When we stopped, I held her close and breathed in the scent of her hair. My back scrapped against the bark as she lay on top of me, facing the sky.

One by one, the stars began vanishing into the black. “I guess that’s what happens to them.” I said into her ear.

“Guess so.”

“Do you think God exists?”

“Someone’s turning off the lights.”

I let out a hollow chuckle.

A few heartbeats later she asked, “I wonder if it was a cruelty or a kindness to let us know the end was coming.”

I didn’t know how to respond to that. It could have been either, or both. “Maybe for us it was a kindness.”

“Oh dear, you’re a romantic.”

I laughed. “It’s the first time anyone has accused me of that before.”

She turned, pressing her body against mine, looking for any comfort I might offer. “Do you think… Do you think we’ll wake up when this is over?”

‘No.’ I thought. But I didn’t say it. Her eyes were desperate, pleading. She wanted to hear the lie, but I couldn’t muster the effort. “I don’t know. I hope so.” A lump settled in my throat.

She shuddered and made a motion that wasn’t quite a nod. I felt my heart beat faster as she grabbed my hand and held it over her bare chest. I could feel her heartbeat beneath my fingers.

A tear rolled down my cheek before being caught in her hair. The stars were disappearing more quickly now, and the inky shadow webbed its way through the night sky, strangling the light it came across. Each vanished pinprick sent another chill down my spine, until I was shaking uncontrollably.

“I wish,” I fumbled over the words. “I wish we’d had a life together. That this wasn’t the last night we had. I want more.” I spoke the last words with a clenched jaw. She placed her hand on mine, fully covering her chest, and I realized how tense, how angry, I was.

“Me too,” Her voice was a calming whisper on the wind. “I wish we had more time, too. Stay with me?”

I felt my anger slip away as my muscles slowly relaxed. “Of course.” I said. “Couldn’t run if I wanted.” She relaxed into my arms as best she could and began to cry. I joined her, and we wept for the time we would never have.

The tears in our eyes briefly caused the stars to duplicate. Then we watched as the darkness choked out even that last bit of hope and the black tendrils stretched over the moon. It was horrifying, even as it was beautiful. Tears rolled in streams down my face as I began sobbing into her hair. Her body curled into mine, and I felt her tears soak my shirt. The writhing shadows devoured the moon before falling upon the crystal peaks and consuming them. We clutched each other in vain, as the shadow smothered the river, and the valley, and the light of our campfire. At last, we were left in the black. The only sound our quiet whimpers, until even that ended.

Gotta say I was worried when I bought the wingtips that they might come across too formal. I bought them with the intention of wearing them for my wedding next fall, but wanted to try them out now. I figured I’d not wear them much because I wasn’t sure if they’d look good dressed casual. I gotta say, they are incredibly versatile and look good with several different pairs of pants I have. Threw three outfits in the photos so you can see. Some “peach” colored chinos, some hunter green denim, and some regular blue jeans. 

The “black coffee” roadster jacket is exquisite. I had to take some pics out in the sunlight so you could truly appreciate the rich color tones. 🤌 This is the first leather jacket I’ve owned so I was really afraid of buying online and it not fitting and having to go through the process of exchanging. I’m 5’10, around 260lbs, with very broad, muscular shoulders, chest, and arms, so I was torn between the regular fit and the athletic fit. I wear a size XL shirt, so originally I had the XL regular in my cart and made the purchase. After measuring my chest immediately after purchasing, I panicked and sent an email to customer service to adjust my order for the athletic fit, but sizing up to an XXL. It’s perfect for me. It fits snug when zipped fully, but not uncomfortably so and doesn’t restrict movement. 

Anyway I just wanted to drop these pics and share my experience with sizing of the jacket for any bigger guys like me!",9,1734807301.0,ThursdayBoot,1,1.0,False

I once told him that i dont like to be given flowers as I dont want to see them dying inside a vase. Hearing this he said that he also shares similar thoughts. But guess what!?
He brought flowers for me!!

I had told him that i hit the gym regularly and he replied that he also has been a gym guy for over 6 yrs.. But judging by his appearance i can clearly conclude that the last time he walked pass a gym was definitely way earlier than the day hasina nani fled.

He ordered coffee for us saying that the coffee offered by the restaurant is one of the best in town. And guess what he had told me earlier that he dont take coffee, its unhealthy bla bla..

Those are just the tip of the iceberg. Everything that he said to me durning the meeting contradicts his online persona. I wonder how one can say this many lies to someone.. I'm kinda heartbroken rn. I haven’t blocked him yet. Haven’t replied any of his texts.. I dont know how to get rid of him. Maybe i'm overreacting or maybe i expected too much from a ramdom unknown person.

1hjg8c2,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterNarcissism/comments/1hjg8c2/i_once_said_something_narcissiatic_to_a_relative/,I once said something 'narcissiatic' to a relative 20 years ago and it has haunted me ever since ,"I was at a college party with some friends and one of my relatives happened to be there. It was a costume, and this relative was wearing very revealing clothing. 

Now, I was drinking, and it was a very cute outfit, but for some reason in the moment, when we crossed paths I said casually 'you can't wear that!'

It horrified me immediately. Obviously, I was projecting prudish Catholic and patriarchal shame that I purged after coming out as transgender (mtf) and bisexual. 

Now, I actually have the self-awareness to at least try and unpack what happened in my brain. 

I'm going to set aside a lot of social commentary that a lot of us are already familiar with. There are things like conditioned patriarchal ownership over women's bodies and decisions that we can say are themes here. I'm not going to deny that. Through listening to women and trying to understand myself better for the last 20 years, I can stay with confidence I've at least made a little bit of progress!

But I want to focus on unpacking what I think could be a glimpse into the narcissistic projection. Because I think what I said was super weird, super uncomfortable, super wrong. But in therapy, we are always having to try and reframe the things that narcissists say to us If we're going to decode them and function around them and not talk to the actual words they are using, cuz that only results in weird and bad outcomes. (If that day My relative would have told me I can wear whatever the f*** I want, she would have been absolutely right and I would have probably apologize immediately saying I don't know why the f*** I said that I am so damn sorry.)

Okay! All that being said, time to unpack.
 - relative was dressed sexy 
 - I had never seen a relative dress sexy before 
 - here, some sort of cognitive dissonance had to be reconciled. The conflicts could be...

 - maybe I thought I was supposed to be sexually attracted to everyone who dresses 'attractively', and I thought it was HER responsibility to make sure to not accidentally make me aroused or something like that (obviously she did not do that, but you get what I'm saying here. This is the same type of logic male politicians and religious leaders use when they say that women shouldn't wear short skirts. It's way wrong) 
 - MAYBE because we were similar age, I hadn't grasped the fact that she was an adult now, and she was still a child in my mind. 
 - I envied her (definitely something that I encountered a lot throughout my life since I'm transgender, Ive had a lot of envy for women while not having an outlet to explore and express myself authentically until I came out a long time later)

Anyway, we could go on for the possible reasons for the cognitive dissonance. What really matters is the fact that I acted on it and said something that didn't actually express whatever it was that I was actually thinking or feeling. 

There is something unresolved within me and rather than me take on the responsibility to resolve it within myself, The immediate reaction was to put the entire responsibility on someone else (and, not even saying what the reason for this responsibility was). 

That sounds SO much like the relationship that led me to join these narcissistic abuse recovery subreddits and support groups in recent years. The exception is, of course, The narcissist is stuck in that mindset. They cannot grow or evolve or apologize. They are permanently in cognitive dissonance, permanently unable to realize that they're not taking responsibility for whatever is unresolved within them, always forced to tell others that it's their fault, their responsibility to do better. 

As a result, they are forced to attack anything that causes cognitive dissonance within them, and even though they can't explain or identify what actually triggers cognitive dissonance, when it happens they immediately react to it and shut it down. So it's impossible to ever discuss boundaries or expectations with a narcissist because every single thing you say and do during those healthy conversations is something that, to them, you 'shouldnt' do because of how uncomfortable it makes them. 

Whenever someone asks a narcissist, especially a covert narcissist, to take responsibility for their actions, in their mind, The person asking them to take responsibility is doing something that they just somehow believe is wrong in society to do. 

People without narcissism might have moments like what I experienced, but we are flexible. We can be confronted and we can empathize with another person and accept that we've done something wrong and move on. 

When I try to think about the things I might have said if I were permanently stuck in the mindset that I had in that moment, we would have ended up with some crazy making conversations: 

'hey aadziereddit, I can wear whatever I want'
'Well no you're not supposed to wear sexy outfits around me'

(Obviously I don't know what I would have actually said cuz this isn't a real scenario, I'm just trying to go from what I've learned about narcissism)

And if pressed on trying to explain why that is, because I haven't reconciled the cognitive dissonance, there would be no straight answer. It would end up with something like 'Well everyone knows that' or 'You should know that already'. 

It's almost like... If we were to experience the same thing narcissist do... Being invited to a friends because they had some extra pizza, and you get there and the pizza has hot dogs on it. And you don't believe it's real but you're told that's just how this place makes it. And then it happens again and this time it's a pizza with dog food on it. And the next time it's a pizza with coffee spilled all over it. It's hard to not believe that either this person is messing with you, or lying to you, or pranking you. But instead of weird pizza, it's someone kindly saying to you 'your actions and your words have impact on other people and they matter'. Instead of weird pizza, it's someone in your relationship wanting to have autonomy and independence and be able to speak for themselves'.

I’m a 33-year-old guy living in Canada, and I find it challenging to connect with people who share a similar mindset. Here’s a bit about me and my perspective:

	•	Not religious: I don’t follow any religion and find it tough to get along with people who are deeply religious, especially if they impose their views on others.

	•	Relationships/marriages aren’t my vibe: I don’t relate to people who prioritize these things or have kids—they’re usually too busy, and our lives don’t overlap much.

	•	Child-free by choice: I’ve decided I never want kids. I don’t want to bring them into this messed-up world or take on the responsibilities that come with parenting.

	•	Not interested in dating: For me, relationships often feel transactional, so I’ve chosen to stay away from that scene entirely.

I spend most of my time alone, which I’m mostly fine with. I enjoy walking around, listening to podcasts, going to bars or coffee shops, and just being in my own company. I do know I could benefit from developing more hobbies.

I have acquaintances, but finding good, long-term friends with a similar mindset who put equal efforts has been difficult.

A tactic that YouTube employs for newsworthy stories or figures is to categorize searches for them as ""news"", and only show or prioritize content from certain channels. If you look at the search results for Brett Cooper, it seems that this is what happened. Telltale signs of this are:

1. The only results are from established podcasts or channels with lots of channels or ones that are part of a network (which is why searching for her pulls up Comments Section videos and shorts that don't even have her in them)

2. Older videos only tangentially related to the search term showing up (which is why searching for her pulls up old clips from the Iced Coffee Hour podcast and the trailer for Disney's Snow White movie)

Now sometimes if a video by an independent creator about the search term is very popular, it will appear, but these search results won't include many of those types of content in most cases.

The way to get around this is always to apply a filter to your search. If a search is applied, the whole ""news"" thing doesn't apply. This is why if you search by type, her channel appears. Whenever I suspect this type of sensorship, I always filter by this week and sort by views.",5,1734806168.0,BrettCooper,3,0.86,False

In the noble pursuit of healthier sugar alternatives, inulin and yacon syrup have emerged as stars of the show, captivating the attention of health enthusiasts everywhere. These delightful options not only appease your sweet tooth but also bestow a plethora of health benefits and nutritional advantages upon your palate. This article will delve into the myriad benefits of these natural fibers' sweetening abilities demonstrating how to seamlessly incorporate them into your diet as effective sugar replacements, while also highlighting essential precautions to bear in mind. Whether your goal is to elevate your recipes to new culinary heights or to embark on a journey toward improved health, let us uncover how inulin and yacon syrup can revolutionize your approach to sweetening—one spoon at a time!

# What are Inulin and Yacon Syrup?

Inulin and yacon syrup have emerged as two delightful plant-based sweeteners, gracefully stepping onto the stage as healthier alternatives to traditional sugars. These sweeteners come with a charming array of properties that not only tantalize the taste buds but also enhance digestive health and support weight management.

Inulin, a prebiotic fiber extraordinaire, nourishes beneficial gut bacteria, while yacon syrup, derived from the humble yacon plant, has earned accolades for its low glycemic index, potential prowess in blood sugar management, and prebiotic effect. Together, these natural sweeteners offer a delightful and nutritious option for those eager to reduce sugar intake without sacrificing flavor.

Tracing the origins of inulin reveals its roots—quite literally—in various plants, such as chicory root and Jerusalem artichokes, which have graced traditional medicine for centuries, showcasing their health-promoting qualities. This sweet natural fiber doesn't just support digestive health by fostering a harmonious gut microbiome; it also enhances mineral absorption, making it a valuable, if not essential, addition to one’s diet. Its prebiotic properties make it food for the good bifidobacteria in your gut, which then turn it into lactic acid and short-chained fatty acids, elevating your mood and intestinal flora.

On the flip side, yacon syrup, extracted from the tuberous roots of the yacon plant, boasts a treasure trove of fructooligosaccharides (FOS), a unique carbohydrate that doubles as a low-calorie sweetener. Those prebiotic fibers feed your good gut bacteria because of their indigestibility they contain only ⅓ of the calories of regular sugar. 30 to 50% of yacon sirup is made of FOS. This remarkable compound plays a vital role in regulating blood sugar levels, making yacon syrup a splendid choice for the sugar-conscious. 

Whether it’s drizzled over pancakes, blended into smoothies, or employed in baking masterpieces, both inulin and yacon syrup stand ready to enhance culinary creations while contributing to one’s overall health. Who knew sweetness could be so clever?

# Benefits of Inulin and Yacon Syrup

The health benefits of inulin and yacon syrup are as diverse as they are remarkable, presenting an array of nutritional advantages for those wishing to elevate their dietary game.

Inulin, primarily sourced from chicory root, functions as a soluble fiber that nurtures the flourishing of beneficial gut bacteria, thereby enhancing overall digestive health and nutrient absorption. This clever little mechanism not only champions a healthy microbiome but also helps in curbing appetite, making it a secret weapon for those on a weight management journey.

Yacon syrup rivals honey in taste while boasting a low glycemic index and a comparably high fiber amount. This makes it particularly appealing to those who are vigilant about their blood sugar levels.

[Chicory roots, one of the main sources of inulin, are also used to make substitute coffee.](https://unimother.de/a/blog/solution/household/grow-your-own-coffee-alternative-healthier-and-sustainable-lupine-and-chicory)

Their ability to maintain balanced blood sugar levels while offering a delightful source of low-calorie sweetness and feeding the good gut microbiome positions them as an exceptional addition to any health-conscious regimen.

Inulin and yacon syrup not only provide sweetness but also enhance overall health.

After all, who wouldn’t want a little sweetness with a side of healthy wellness?

# Health Benefits and Nutritional Value

The nutritional merits of inulin and yacon syrup are quite remarkable, presenting a delightful array of health benefits when woven into the fabric of a balanced diet.

These natural sweeteners go beyond merely serving as sugar substitutes; they actively promote digestive health through their prebiotic fibers, bolster insulin sensitivity, and assist in weight management. They work against constipation and reduce hunger. They also reduce the growth of harmful bacteria like clostridium. Due to the high fiber count, they slow down sugar absorption and stabilize blood sugar. [Studies show improvement in insulin sensitivity with inulin supplementation.](https://gut.bmj.com/content/68/8/1430) Also, improvements in blood lipid levels were observed. This sweet water-soluble fiber swells up in the stomach and increases the feeling of satiety. The oligofructose in inulin is also able to stop the hunger hormone ghrelin and help reduce weight.

[Inulin intake of 10g per day has also been shown to increase calcium absorption and increase bone density.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33611985/#:~:text=An%20inulin%20intake%20of%20least,postmenopausal%20women%20and%20adult%20men.)

Together, these natural ingredients not only serve as healthier alternatives to conventional sweeteners but also possess unique properties that contribute to holistic well-being. Thus, they emerge as stellar choices for anyone looking to elevate their health outcomes with a touch of flair.

# Potential Risks and Side Effects

While inulin and yacon syrup may parade around with a dazzling array of health benefits, one must remain vigilant about the potential risks and side effects that accompany their consumption.

Like any food additive or dietary fiber that struts into your diet, it’s important to slowly increase the amount for your body and gut microbiome to adapt. Moderation is the name of the game; overindulgence could lead to digestive discomfort or high gas output and might feel like an upset stomach, especially for those not accustomed to high-fiber fare.

Thus, it's imperative to grasp safe consumption levels and adhere to dietary guidelines, ensuring one can savor the nutritional rewards without suffering the inevitable pitfalls.

After all, nobody wants their health kick to end in a dietary disaster!

# Precautions and Warnings for Using Inulin and Yacon Syrup

When integrating inulin and yacon syrup into one’s diet, it is prudent to consider certain precautions and warnings even though the benefits truly outweigh any potential side effects. While these natural sweeteners generally enjoy a reputation for safety among most individuals, it would be wise to commence with small quantities, thereby allowing the digestive system to adjust without undue distress.

For those with specific dietary restrictions or health conditions, a consultation with a healthcare professional can provide tailored insights into safe consumption practices.

Consumers should remain vigilant regarding potential interactions with other dietary fibers and medications, as these may exacerbate digestive discomfort or disrupt medication absorption—an unfortunate twist in the plot of one’s health narrative. It is also advisable to monitor overall fiber intake when introducing these ingredients, as an excess of fiber could lead to the rather uncomfortable consequences of bloating, gas, or diarrhea.

Individuals on medications that affect gut motility should proceed with caution, as alterations in fiber consumption may impact the timing of absorption and efficacy of these drugs—a plot twist no one wishes for.

Employing an informed approach not only bolsters digestive health but also maximizes the beneficial properties of inulin and yacon syrup, ensuring that one’s foray into these natural sweeteners is both fruitful and enjoyable.

I've been using my nespresso vertuo for awhile now, I use it soely to make 7.77 fl oz cups of coffee (I don't think I've ever made an actual espresso shot through it lol). Anyhoo; while I do love the flavor and ease of use - economically it's just not making sense - I drink about 3 cups a day and am burning through these expensive pods like a mad man. 

  
I'm thinking I should just move to a drip machine, brew like a 6 cup pot using my own grounds (more flavor choices is always fun), however - do also want the choice to throw in a K-cup on occasion while running out the door.

  
I'm torn between these two machines:

* *K-Duo**^(®)* *Hot & Iced Single Serve & Carafe Coffee Maker (Gen 2)*
* *K-Duo Plus**^(®)* *Single Serve & Carafe Coffee Maker*

  
While the K-Duo Plus is much sleeker looking, it seems like it's an older machine? The Duo Gen2 has this ""MULTISTREAM TECHNOLOGY"" - Now I won't pretend to know what that even means ... but it does sound nice.

  
My question; is the DUO PLUS (the sleek looking one) on the horizon for a re-design with this newer ""multistream technology""? Should I just hold out a little longer for a GEN2 of that machine? It is much more aesthetically pleasing and looks to have a better carafe. I don't mind waiting - any insight?

- Hyper empathetic. I cry a lot because I feel everyythingggg 100x more than most people. I've been at the grocery store, and laid eyes on a stranger and was brought to tears just because I ""felt them,"" like the things they've been through and endured. I cry over every little happy/sad/heartwarming thing, because I FEEL for these people.

- Deep(er) understanding of everything. And yet I'm still seeking knowledge of everything. Filled with questions. But I'm able to connect the dots, and see things that other people wouldn't even begin to think about. Usually I'm pretty good at writing essays, like straight A's on them, and once I got a 60 (nearly FAILING) because I connected too many points and I'm pretty sure I lost my teacher's attention lol. And yes I did cry.

Recently my aunt has been diagnosed with cancer. They're still doing the work to find out exactly what cancer it is, what stage it is and what they can do for her. I grew up extremely close to my family so this is adding a big mental strain to my already overloaded brain. It's also resurfacing feelings from losing other family members.

A typical weekday starts at around 6:30am when I get up with the kids, make them breakfast, sort out their lunches, get them washed and dressed then get them out the door for around 8am. By the time I return from the school run at 9, my wife still hasn't moved from bed.

I work from home and my schedule is quite flexible so I usually work from 9am to around 11:30 when I have to pick one of the girls up from nursery. I then come back, work through until around 2:45 when I go to pick up my son from school. After everyone is home, I cook for everyone, play with the kids and get them ready for bed. I take the girls up to bed around 7pm and my son stays up until 8pm but he goes on his own. There are also specific weekday activities to fit into this as well (swimming lessons etc) so I spend a lot of time I should be working looking after the kids meaning I often have to carry on after they've gone to bed to get caught up.

  
At some point my wife will come downstairs and sit on the sofa. She'll stay there until it's time for bed again, only getting up if she needs to use the bathroom. I often stop multiple times through the day to make coffee, prepare food for lunch etc.

  
Things have taken a downward turn (I didn't think things could get much worse but I was wrong) since we got married.

A few weeks before the wedding, she started playing a game on her phone. This game, along with the social aspect of it on Discord and WhatsApp has completely taken over her life. She will spend as much as 16-20 hours a day on her phone either playing or talking about this game. On top of this, she's sunk a lot of money into it; it must be into the thousands by now.

I don't mind what she spends her money on, it's hers but I pay for everything. Every single bill comes out of my salary. After all bills are paid I'm left with quite literally nothing. I haven't bought anything for myself in months because I have no money left. 

  
We've had multiple arguments and her family know about this and have told her to sort it out, but the more people tell her, the more stubborn she becomes. I've tried getting angry, being kind - I just don't know how to get through to her.

  
The kids draw pictures for me, but never for her. They don't ask her to do anything for them or show her anything. Even the school have started reminding our son to read to dad.

Honestly if it were the other way around I'd be mortified and so ashamed, but she just gets angry at people for getting on at her.

  
We managed to get her to go see a doctor about it and she went in and just told them how tired she is all the time (which is no wonder when she spends so much time in front of her phone) so she's displaying classic addict behaviours now.

  
I'm at the end of my rope, I just can't deal with this and everything else I have going on.

  
Apologies for such a long post but I have to get all of this out of my head in the hope it'll help.

  
I'm not really looking for advice, I've sort of resigned myself to the fact she needs to realise she's got a problem but nobody can force her to do that. I just have to do what I can to make sure my kids' needs are met.",144,1734805657.0,offmychest,55,0.96,False

i've been in a relationship with my boyfriend for three years now. all my previous relationships have ended in me finding someone ""more exciting"" - really just looking for attention from one more person. but for this relationship... it's too good to give up on for a moment of dopamine. i've never been so happy in my life.

but something in me feels sorrow. after the initial honeymoon phase ended (it lasted about 1.5 years), i've lost all my sex drive. i have to get him off every few days because he gets anxious and moody without it, which is absolutely not his fault and he is very sorry about it.

sometimes i think about other men, fictional or not. and i can't help but think, is this all there is? i should be happy to be with a man i love, who makes me coffee and sandwiches in the morning and cuddles me to sleep at night, but i don't feel a single thing for him sexually. i feel so guilty. he absolutely adores me and i need to think about other people just to enjoy sex. i've tried talking about it, we've tried new things in the bedroom, but nothing works. even when he does things i know would usually turn me on, it only makes me cringe.

it's not like i've fallen out of love with him and should find ""a better relationship"", because i love him. i don't want to be in a relationship with anyone else. and it would just be the same in any other relationship. i've heard so much about long-lasting relationships, but how come i've never heard about how people deal with all the sexual stuff? how do you get rid of the guilt and sadness and just accept the fact that you'll never again feel the touch of someone you want? maybe i just shouldn't have any relationship with anyone. all this makes me feel like there's something wrong with me. hearing about people in long happy relationships makes me cry myself to sleep at night.

and no, i don't have any crushes or anyone else in my life who i'd be attracted to, who i would ""need to get over"".",0,1734805564.0,relationship_advice,22,0.5,False

1hjfo2h,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hjfo2h,Yezdi Adventure appreciation post,"After more than a year of riding this machine on every rideable surface possible, and clocking close to 9k km, I finally have the words to describe my experience and my journey.

When I asked around while I was making my decision on which bike to buy, I was presented with several options. Here’s what I started with:
1. Honda CB 350 Hness
2. Suzuki Vstrom 250SX
3. Yezdi Adventure
4. Yezdi Scrambler
5. Triumph Speed 400
6. Himalayan 411
7. Honda 300F
8. Yamaha FZ (Cuz my dad liked it)

It was a close call between the H’ness and Yezdi Adventure, but somehow, I kept gravitating to the Yezdi Adv. Why? I felt the bike when I rode it. Like, I felt a connection with it. It was loud, revy, full of character, and looked really appealing. After pondering over my decision, I finally went with my heart and got the bike, and couldn’t be happier!

Life with this machine has been so wonderful! I took it on a short ride around Pune on the day of delivery (where my friend dropped the bike after stalling it on a U turn, lol). Since then, I’ve been on rides as short as 50km to as long as 200km in one day. On tarmac, concrete, dirt, mud and pebbles. I commuted almost every day averaging around 30km, and more recently for the last 5 months 60km. Daily commutes have become much more fun and adventurous! I remember countless days when I’d take a detour while coming back from work to explore new trails around the city or take a longer route just to have a mini ride.

It’s come to a point where I’ve become so accustomed to the bike that I lean it really hard in ghats, trust the brakes and tyres and the engine to take the beating. It takes everything I throw at it, and more. Not once has it broken down on me (despite of what people have been telling me).

Coming to the service and maintenance experience, the Jawa Yezdi service centre has always been helpful. They’ve changed my gear indicator and fuel sensor under warranty which had some issues, and have helped me with wheel alignments, chain adjustments and some other minor repairs free of cost. I just got my bike serviced after a year, and they’ve done a great job addressing most of my issues.

I maintain my bike other times, washing it weekly, cleaning, lubing and adjusting its chain every 3-500 kms, and polishing it every month. Now, whenever I sit on the bike to do to work or even just to grab a cup of coffee nearby, I just can’t help but smile when I feel the engine roar, the typical wispy noise it makes is music to my ears.

Overall, I’m really happy with my bike and hope others find similar joy in their bikes too!

And just as a reminder: Please ride safely. Don’t speed for no reason. Wear a helmet. And respect traffic rules.

Ride safe! #ATGATT",5,1734805071.0,indianbikes,3,0.86,False

I’m a 33-year-old guy living in Canada, and I find it challenging to connect with people who share a similar mindset. Here’s a bit about me and my perspective:

	•	Not religious: I don’t follow any religion and find it tough to get along with people who are deeply religious, especially if they impose their views on others.

	•	Relationships/marriages aren’t my vibe: I don’t relate to people who prioritize these things or have kids—they’re usually too busy, and our lives don’t overlap much.

	•	Child-free by choice: I’ve decided I never want kids. I don’t want to bring them into this messed-up world or take on the responsibilities that come with parenting.

	•	Not interested in dating: For me, relationships often feel transactional, so I’ve chosen to stay away from that scene entirely.

I spend most of my time alone, which I’m mostly fine with. I enjoy walking around, listening to podcasts, going to bars or coffee shops, and just being in my own company. I do know I could benefit from developing more hobbies.

I have acquaintances, but finding good, long-term friends with a similar mindset who put equal efforts has been difficult.

# Side Effects and Safety Considerations

Java Burn is a natural supplement that helps with metabolism and weight loss. The ingredients in Java Burn are usually safe. But, it's key to think about possible side effects and safety before adding it to your routine.

She had fatigue, couldn't exercise, and had jaundice, needing a liver transplant. This case doesn't involve Java Burn but shows risks of certain ingredients in weight loss supplements.

Dietary supplements can have big effects. Some have hidden harmful ingredients, like prescription medicines. The FDA found many weight loss products online and in stores with hidden drugs, which can be dangerous.

Java Burn's safety depends on how each person reacts. No major side effects have been reported. Still, it's wise to talk to a healthcare provider before starting any new supplement, especially if you have health issues or take medications.

A study with 70 adults with obesity showed a weight loss supplement helped them lose 4.2 pounds on average. This was more than the placebo group, which lost 0.9 pounds. It's important to remember that losing weight should be done through a balanced diet and exercise, not just supplements.

|:-|:-|
|Caffeine|Jitteriness, anxiety, insomnia|
|Green tea extract|Stomach discomfort, nausea|
|L-theanine|Rarely, dizziness or headaches|
|Chromium|In high doses, skin irritation, headaches|

To stay safe with Java Burn or any weight loss supplement, follow the dosage instructions. Be aware of any interactions with medications or health conditions. If you have any bad reactions, stop using it and talk to your doctor.

Looking for no-pressure friends to vibe with","I have a dog and lots of houseplants. My dog is alive and well - my house plants? not so much. I love reading, video games, listening to music and playing my guitar. I’ve recently taken up crochet, which is going about as well as my plant care, but it’s fun, so I’m sticking with it.

I used to be chronically online, but now not so much. If you're okay with a sporadic friend or an accountability partner just to check in and pick up whenever convenient, maybe do our own thing but hang out on a call, then this would work. Even better if you're close to North of England as we can hang out in person! I frequent a lot of gigs, mainly indie alt / indie pop, really into electronic dance music (specifically house). I'd consider myself a mild alternative kind of lad.

Personality-wise, I’m quiet and shy at first, but once I warm up, I’m like an annoying fly—persistent, curious, and (hopefully) charming. I’m passionate about self-discovery and understanding mental health, so if you’re someone who enjoys introspection or deep convos about how people work, we’d probably click. I am an ENFJ personality trait so if you're an introvert then I could adopt you :)

I spend my time working (computers), hitting the gym, hanging with my dog (he’s the best) & my friends (they come after), or diving into a good book. I’m really into gigs—mostly indie alt, indie pop, and electronic dance music (house). I’d consider myself a mild alternative kind of lad.

If you’re into video games, books, or music, tell me your favourites! Or maybe we can just vibe and trade life updates when the mood strikes. If you’re in the North of England, let’s hit up a gig or grab a coffee sometime.

1hjfjgh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hjfjgh/update_aitah_for_calling_my_mom_out_on_her_bs_and/,UPDATE: AITAH for calling my mom out on her BS and standing up for my wife?,"First time updating, so not sure if this is the right way to do it, but it's been 2 months and things have progressed, so I figured it's worth an update.

About a month after everything went down with my family, my mom called me while I was working. I couldn't answer at the time, but she followed up with a text, asking to stop at my house over lunch (she assumed I was WFH, but I was not that day). The text said she wanted to sit down just her and I, and that she was very ""fragile"" right now, so if I was angry, she wouldn't come.
When I had a moment, I called her back, mostly because we have elderly family members on her side, and if they passed I wanted to know. 
When we talked, she said she had had a health scare, and that things have been very difficult lately (no one died). She was upset that we were ""punishing"" her by keeping the kids away for a ""misunderstanding"". I stopped her multiple times on the call and said I would not tolerate excuses around what had happened, or her blaming me or my wife. In the end, I ended up cutting her off while she was saying we were punishing her and said I wasn't going to listen to this, and hung up. 
Later that day, I got a call from my dad. No surprise. This is the usual series of events if my mom and I ever disagree. I talk to her, tell her I don't agree, then she calls her enabler to back her up. 

When I talked to my dad, it was a 20 minute conversation with a typical clueless dad/husband. He says it was disrespectful of me to hang up on my mom when she was trying to apologize. I laughed and said that wasn't what had happened, and explained what had been said on the call. He was clueless, said he wasn't sure about any of that, and that they missed the kids (grandkids). He wanted to sit down with us and my mom and have a conversation about what happened. 
I finished the call by saying I would talk to my wife about it, and get back to him.

For some additional context, my mom is in her mid 60s, and my dad is in his mid 50s. My mom has always ""worn the pants"" in my family, and anyone who challenges her is on the outs.

Last night, we met with them at a coffee shop while my MIL watched the kids.
It was an hour+ conversation, and by the end, several things were clear.
1. My parents do not respect me as an adult or parent. They would not apologize for any undermining of our parenting, as they say it's a ""difference of opinion"".
2. My mom IS having issues with her memory. She is seeing some specialists for issues with her brain, because she is unable to recall details about things.
3. My dad just wants this all to go away. 
4. My mom says she is a ""big picture person"", which is why she doesn't remember all the ""little details"" of conversations.
5. My dad is the one who cut contact with us. My mom wanted to reach out, but he told her not to, and that we ""needed time"".

My wife and I talked afterwards and we agreed that the conversation went as well as it could, but that there were still alot of persistent issues. 

We know that my parents do not take me seriously. They don't see me as a parent, they still believe they can dismiss my opinions or beliefs and it's perfectly within their rights.
We know my parents feel bad about creating an issue, but they feel bad mostly because of the consequences. She said that she says things she doesn't mean sometimes because she's angry. I pointed out that she never apologizes for those things or comes back later to clarify what she does mean, and she no answer to that.
And finally we know that my mom has no clue how manipulative she is. She whipped out so many things in that conversation that were manipulative as hell, but when we called her on it she just seemed confused.

So here's where we're at: my wife says that we should start doing things with them again slowly, and have them see the kids. The kids miss them and they are not bad people overall. I am not necessarily against it, but I don't want to just let this go. This event took 2 months of no contact to resolve, and really upset my wife, kids, and myself. I have realized that my parents are too old to change, but I can't just accept that they are going to do these things when they end up causing problems. 

Advice needed: how do I move forward with my parents while still maintaining my integrity as a parent and address the persistent issues they present?",14,1734804712.0,AITAH,9,1.0,False
1hjfj9m,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hjfj9m/advice_please/,Advice please 🙏,"**Long story short:** I met a guy, and after a few weeks, he started pulling away. I told him that if he’s not feeling it, it’s cool—let’s call it quits. He insisted he was definitely into it and set a cinema date for a week away. I asked him to let me know the details closer to the date. Cool!

The day before the date, nothing. The day of the date, still nothing—until the afternoon when he texted to say he was sorry for being quiet; he’d had a bad week, with no mention of the date. I was sympathetic 🙄. Later that evening, I texted him to say let’s call it quits since I was wasting my time. He apologized for making me feel that way and said that if it weren’t for his current mindset, he wouldn’t object to calling it quits 🙄. I replied that it was cool and offered friendship, thinking about his mental health.

Fast forward five weeks, and he gets in touch—""Hi, how are you?"" blah blah. We chatted for a couple of weeks, and he got flirty, but I didn’t respond to it. Then he asked if I would object to meeting for coffee. I said no, I wouldn’t, but no date was set. A few more weeks went by, and I kind of gave in to it 🙈, but not too much.

Last week, he suggested we meet for a drink. I told him to suggest a time, and he suggested this weekend but didn’t confirm a day. By that point, I felt him pulling away again, following the same pattern as before. So, I decided to leave him alone, and I haven’t texted all week. I expected him to confirm a day by yesterday (Friday). Today (Saturday)—NOTHING!

I'm just so f**king annoyed that I allowed this to happen again! Now, I know I should forget him, and I will. But I need advice: should I just leave it and never text again, or if he texts, let him have it? Or should I text him on Monday and say something?

My usual response to ghosting is to leave it and delete all contacts, but I have this urge not to let him off lightly again. Thoughts? Be nice! 😉
