Ever dreamt of being a wizard? Not the kind with long robes and a pointy hat (though, hey, no judgment if you’ve got one in your closet), but the type of wizard who commands the glowing runes of the digital realm: **code**. Yes, coding is the modern form of spellcasting. Instead of waving a wand and shouting “Expelliarmus,” we wave our keyboards and whisper cryptic incantations like `if (x > y) { return true; }`. The best part? This magic doesn’t just stay in fantasy land—it powers the real world, and in our case, the Bitcoin world.

Now, imagine you’re deep in your wizard’s tower (or, you know, hunched over your laptop with coffee stains on your hoodie). You’ve got your IDE open, your fingers ready to summon digital wonders. But wait… what’s that glimmering in the distance? A magical tool that doesn’t require ten thousand lines of arcane code to bring your Bitcoin transactions to life? That, my fellow spellcasters, is the [**Bitcoin QR Code Maker**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com)—your enchanted grimoire for easy Bitcoin payments.

# Spells Simplified: Turning Bitcoin into QR Codes

Back in the early days of wizardry (and Bitcoin), setting up payments felt like decoding a scroll written in dragon language. You had to copy long addresses that looked like someone fell asleep on their keyboard, double-check every letter, and pray you didn’t accidentally send your precious satoshis into the void. One wrong keystroke, and poof—your Bitcoin vanished into the abyss, never to return.

But with the Bitcoin QR Code Maker, that stress disappears faster than a fireball spell. Instead of fiddling with scary strings of numbers and letters, you just type in the amount and address, click a button, and voilà—a shiny QR code materializes, ready for scanning. It’s the kind of magic even non-wizards can handle.

# Why Every Coding Wizard Needs This in Their Spellbook

Even the most powerful coding sorcerers don’t need to reinvent the wheel. Sure, you could sit down and write your own QR code generator, debug it for hours, and battle mysterious errors from the depths of Stack Overflow. But why waste your mana on that when there’s already a tool that works perfectly?

The Bitcoin QR Code Maker is your loyal familiar—it sits quietly, always ready to conjure up a QR code for you, your friends, or your business. Want to accept Bitcoin for your side quest project? Done. Need a slick way to show off your donation address during your next Twitch coding stream? Easy. Trying to convince your non-techie friend that Bitcoin payments aren’t scary? This is your charm spell.

# From Apprentice to Archmage

Being a coding wizard isn’t about knowing *all* the spells—it’s about knowing how to use the right ones at the right time. Tools like the Bitcoin QR Code Maker are like enchanted shortcuts in your magical journey. They don’t just save you time; they make your digital wizardry look effortless.

So, if you’re ready to level up your coding adventures and sprinkle a little Bitcoin magic into your daily life, grab your staff (keyboard), don your robes (hoodie), and visit [https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com). The Bitcoin QR Code Maker is waiting to join your spellbook.

Because let’s face it—every wizard needs a little QR magic. 🧙‍♂️✨",1,1756527063.0,u_SelectionOptimal7348,0,1.0,False
1n3s745,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1n3s745/hm_the_monday_man/,[HM] The Monday Man,"In Peoria, Illinois, there resides a strange fellow the locals call “the Monday Man.” He lives in a small blue house with yellow trim, a brown door, and a front porch surrounded by white painted wood railings that have seen better days. Once dismissed as a crazy recluse, he is now considered an irreplaceable legend.

For over thirty years, every single day, a man in a thinning but clean yellow robe, green plaid pajama pants, and off-white slippers steps out of his front door at 9:15 in the morning. Holding a steaming cup of what is assumed to be coffee, he gently smiles, leans on the side of his front door frame with its brown paint slightly rubbed off, and raises his blue cup to everyone that crosses his path.

And he always says the words, and only these words:

>“Mondays, am I right?”

He says it with a kind gleam in his eyes to every jogger, neighbor heading to work, college student taking a shortcut, and kid heading to a friend’s house. No matter their gender, status, or where they are going, he does not discriminate. Somehow, those words transform into whatever that individual needs to hear, and his voice warms them like a gentle hug.

Blue mug in hand, regardless of the day, month, or year. No matter the weather.

>“Mondays, am I right?”

The brief period between 9:15 and 9:45 in the morning is the only time he is ever seen. The public has accepted that the kind man will never join them on their walks.

There is one person in particular who has found great meaning in the Monday Man’s strange routine: a recently retired postal worker named Tom Whitaker, age seventy-two.

>“It’s comforting, in a way,” Whitaker told his next-door neighbor, standing next to his beige Ford Taurus, gazing thoughtfully at nothing. “You can count on the Monday Man. Like the sun rising and setting. He’ll be there.”

Whitaker spent forty years working through snow, rain, blistering heat, sunshine, and cloudy days, never missing a day of thankless work. When he retired, he wanted to travel to Japan and go on adventures with his wife. Heartbreakingly, she died four months after he turned in his postal bag, three months before their planned trip.

Now he tries to find new hobbies. It is difficult, with bad knees, shaky hands, and clouded vision. But the Monday Man’s daily routine has given him something to look forward to and take comfort in.

>“It’s like how I was at my old postal job. Routine. It makes me smile. Every morning, without fail. Rain, snow, global pandemics, the Monday Man’s got that mug. Sometimes I like to think, because he always calls whatever day of the week it is the most difficult weekday for most people... it’s like he’s carrying the weight of all our Mondays, all our worries, on his shoulders. I think maybe that’s what he’s trying to say. Does that make sense?”

His neighbor nodded again, smiled, and said goodnight, leaving him with his thoughts.

The next day, at 9:20 in the morning, Whitaker stepped out next to his car, yellow coffee cup in hand. The Monday Man was leaning against his door, as always. He lifted his blue mug and kindly said the inevitable phrase:

>“Mondays, am I right?”

Whitaker, beaming with quiet understanding, nodded back, as though sharing in a deep, unspoken truth that only the two of them could understand. Hello, enter text here to see what your reddit post will look like.",1,1756527047.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

We’ve been together for 7 years and have 2 toddlers. Sex only happens maybe once every 4–5 weeks, and I don’t know if this is considered a “dead bedroom,” but it feels like it.

She says the reason is that she’s overwhelmed, tired, not in the mood, or that it’s because of the kids. For our 7-year anniversary, we lined up a babysitter and went out. On the way, I told her I was excited to be intimate later, and she just gave a small smile and looked away. The date itself was fine, but when we got home, nothing happened. The next day I overheard her sister asking if we had “sexy time,” and she laughed and said “Nooo.”

A couple of days later, I thought maybe she’d be more open since nothing happened on our anniversary. Instead, when I initiated, she shut me down again this time saying no because her coffee would get cold. That honestly crushed me, because it felt like I was less of a priority than a cup of coffee.

On top of that, she’ll tease me by twerking, shaking her ass, showing it off but when I try to get close, she pulls away, laughs, and walks off. It feels like she’s winding me up just to reject me. Meanwhile, I’ve been resorting to porn, which I hate. And when she does finally want sex, I feel like I have to say yes, because otherwise it could be another month or more before it happens again.

I go down on her all the time because I genuinely enjoy it, but she hardly ever reciprocates, and when she does, she complains the whole time. I’ve brought this up to her before she said she’d “work on it,” but instead she blames me for not helping enough with the house, with the kids, or just says she’s not in the mood.

Sleep is another issue. For 5 years, she insisted our oldest sleep in our room, which killed intimacy. We recently moved, and now the kids have their own rooms, but she still prefers to sleep with them most nights, saying it’s because she “misses them.”

I don’t think I’m unattractive. I’m in decent shape, my friends even tell me they see how many women check me out, and they can’t understand why my wife won’t touch me. But with her, there’s no interest.

I don’t want to leave because of our kids. I know people will say that’s not a good reason to stay, but for me it’s the biggest one. At this point, I don’t even know why I’m writing this, other than the fact that my story seems to match a lot of what I’ve read here.",1,1756526835.0,DeadBedrooms,1,1.0,False

Emery Vaughn was about to hand over a billion-dollar empire—and she couldn’t stop smiling.

“On a scale of one to ‘please slap some sense into you,’ this ranks somewhere around full-blown insanity.”

Emery ignored her friend Nina’s words as she finished signing the transfer of shares that she prepared for her boyfriend, Samuel.

""Really... Em... Do you want me to slap you in case that would wake you up, or something?""

“Five years,” Emery said, signing the final page. “I tested him for five years—he passed.”

Nina grabbed the folder. “These will make him the largest shareholder of your father’s company, which is worth millions. Are you hearing yourself?”

“Worth billions,” Emery said with a grin. “And he stayed with me when he thought I was just an orphan intern. That kind of love deserves everything. Don’t you think so?”

She started walking out of the café and marched towards the opposite building—the very building that Samuel owned.

Nina jogged a step ahead to catch up. “Em, seriously. You need to think this through.”

“I already did. Five years, Nina. Five years of hiding who I really am. And he never once made me feel like I wasn’t enough,” Emery said, tightening her grip on her purse. “It’s time that I pay him back.”

Nina looked down at the folder in her hands. “You’re giving him everything.”

Emery nodded. “Because he earned it. Tomorrow, he’s going to meet my father and we can get married in secret. This is my dream, alright?”

They reached the building entrance when a sudden screech of tires made them stop. A sleek black car pulled up at the curb.

Before they could react, a wave of people swarmed the sidewalk. Reporters shoved their way forward, cameras flashing, mics shoved ahead. One of them clipped Emery’s shoulder, nearly knocking her off balance.

“Whoa!” Nina grabbed her, steadying her before she could fall.

“What the hell—” Emery started, but her words were drowned out by screams.

Fans were pushing past them now, shouting a woman’s name.

“Talia! Is Talia here?”

“Talia! We love you!”

“Talia, Look at me!”

Security immediately rushed to create a barrier, but the crowd kept moving forward. Because of this, Emery and Nina were pushed against the glass doors of the building. One of the security guards shoved a fan back, and in the chaos, both Emery and Nina stumbled to the ground.

Emery grabbed Nina’s arm and tried to stand, but another wave of screaming fans pressed toward the car. Her heart pounded as she pulled herself up. What the heck is going on? She turned her head just in time to see the door of the car open.

Then a familiar face stepped out.

Samuel Dwight. Her Samuel.

A woman got out of the car and stood next to him. It was another familiar face.

Almost immediately, the reporters shouted over one another.

“Mr. Samuel Dwight! Is it true you’re marrying Talia Arden?”

He paused for a second, adjusted his coat, then nodded. “Yes, it’s true. We’ll be holding the engagement ceremony very soon.”

Emery blinked.

Another reporter pushed forward. “Is it true she’s pregnant?”

Samuel looked straight ahead. “That’s a very personal matter. I hope you can respect our privacy.”

He had barely finished speaking when another PR handler beside him handed out printed invitations. “The ceremony will be held this Saturday at the Azure Grand Hotel. A formal press conference will follow.”

That set the crowd off. More fans rushed forward, shouting Talia’s name. Phones were lifted, flashes blinding. Several people shoved against each other, trying to get closer. It was almost impossible to move.

Emery held on to Nina tightly as they were pushed backward. One of the cameras hit her shoulder, hard enough to sting. Yet she ignored it as she looked at Samuel again.

He didn’t even glance in her direction. However, this was not enough to stop her. She marched inside the building, fuming as she followed behind Samuel.

“What the hell are you doing?” Nina asked, pulling her back.

“Did you hear that?” Emery asked, her face paling. At first, she wasn’t sure if she heard it correctly, but that was clearly Samuel. She wasn’t blind or deaf. That was him! “He’s marrying someone.”

Nina grabbed Emery’s arm. “Em, stop. Don’t do this. Not here.”

Emery yanked her arm free. “He’s marrying someone,” she said. “Someone that’s not me!”

She moved fast, weaving through the lobby and heading straight for the elevators. Samuel had just stepped inside with Talia and his secretary. Seeing this, Emery quickened her pace, but one of the guards blocked her path.

“Mr. Dwight asked not to be disturbed,” the guard said. “He wants to be alone with Miss Arden.”

Emery didn’t stop. “Do you know who I am?” she snapped, her voice loud enough for some people to notice.

That got Samuel’s attention. He looked at her—just for a moment. His eyes lingered, filled with something unreadable. But he said nothing, letting the elevator doors close.

“Oh, hell no.” Emery didn’t wait. She turned sharply and bolted toward the stairwell. She could hear Nina shout her name behind her, but Emery didn’t slow down.

“Emery! Emery, stop!”

Emery didn’t slow down. She yanked off her heels and clutched them in one hand, feet pounding up the stairs. Her breath came hard and fast. Her legs burned, her chest squeezed tight—but hey, all that cardio was finally paying off.

“Wait—just wait!” Nina called again, struggling behind her. Emery glanced back once to see Nina leaning against the railing on the sixth floor, gasping for air.

“Go,” Nina said between breaths. “Just go.”

Emery didn’t look back again.

By the tenth floor, her knees buckled slightly, her chest rising and falling fast. She pushed the door open and stepped into the hallway. Two men in black stood outside Samuel’s office. She recognized them—his personal security. Familiar faces. Faces that used to nod at her when she brought coffee when she left in the mornings when she stayed over.

She marched straight toward the door, heels still in hand.

“You can’t go in,” one of them said, stepping forward. “You’re not allowed on this floor without clearance.”

“Does he know I’m out here?” she asked.

“We’re following instructions,” the other guard said. “Please step away.”

“I’m not leaving,” Emery said. “Tell him I’m out here!”

Just as she expected, they didn’t move.

“Samuel!” she shouted, her voice echoing down the hallway. “Samuel, open the damn door!”

The two guards stepped in immediately. One of them reached for her arm.

“I said don’t touch me!” Emery snapped, backing away from the guards.

Before either of them could respond, the office door swung open.

Emery turned toward it, expecting Samuel.

Instead, Vanessa Dwight—Samuel’s mother—stepped out.

Emery barely had time to register the older woman’s expression before a hand shot out and struck her across the face.

The slap was sharp and fast, her cheek instantly stinging as her head jerked to the side. She stumbled back, heels slipping from her grip and hitting the floor with a dull thud. Her hand flew up to her cheek, but she didn’t speak. Not yet.

“Hold her down!” Vanessa barked.

Emery’s heart pounded as the guards hesitated. She couldn’t move, couldn’t speak—not from fear, but from the pure shock of it.

Then she heard him.

“Mom, what are you doing!?” Samuel’s voice cut through the noise.

Emery’s eyes snapped toward him, but her face burned too much to form a reply.

Vanessa didn’t pause. “I don’t understand why you would actually think my son would marry someone like you. You— I said hold her down! Today, I will teach this woman a lesson she will never forget!”

# What About Me?

“Let go of me!”

Emery’s voice tore through the sleek office hallway, sharp and trembling as the two guards held her down.

“Let go!” she struggled before she looked at Samuel. “Tell me it’s not true, Sam. Tell me you—”

Then another resounding slap followed. A white-hot sting bloomed across her cheek, jerking her head sideways. The scent of strong perfume hit her nose just before she saw the woman standing inches away—perfect red lips, manicured nails, and eyes full of disgust.

“Did you really think warming his bed would earn you a seat at our table?” Vanessa hissed.

Emery blinked, her cheek burning. Her gaze snapped to Samuel. He’d just stepped out of his office, but he didn’t say a word. Didn’t he see his mother slap her?

Why wasn’t he saying anything? Not a single word.

“Did you think throwing a tantrum here could save you?” Vanessa said. Again, she slapped Emery’s face. “I already warned you not to mess with Samuel! I warned you!”

This time, Samuel finally decided to intervene. He reached for her arm halfheartedly. “Mom, that’s enough—”

Emery barely heard him. Her body froze, trembling from rage, disbelief, and betrayal. Minutes ago, she’d been finalizing the share transfer—the very folder now somewhere on the floor with Nina. Five years. Tomorrow is their fifth anniversary. She was supposed to tell him everything today and introduce him to her father the very next day!

She looked at Samuel again. “Is it true?” Her voice cracked. She had been with him for five years and received a slap or two from his mother and sister, but this was not comparable to what she’d heard just now. “Are you really going to marry Talia?”

His eyes flickered. Guilt. It was there—just for a second. But it was enough.

He didn’t deny it.

Vanessa stepped between them like a wall of steel. “Of course he is! Did you honestly think you mattered?” She scoffed. “You were never anything more than a phase. A well-kept secret. And now, it’s over. Get out of this place, or I’ll have security throw you out.”

Emery clenched her fists. The words sliced deeper than any slap. Her heart raced. “Samuel,” she said. “Say something.” Why wasn’t he saying anything!?

In response, he shifted uncomfortably. “Em, let’s not do this now.” He signaled the guards to let her go, and they quickly complied.

“No!” she snapped as she struggled. “We’re doing this right now! Tell me it’s not true. Please…”

She stepped in front of him, grabbing his arm. “Look me in the eyes and tell me this is not true. Please, Sammy.”

However, he simply yanked his arm free, like her touch was a stain. “I said we’ll talk later.” This time, his tone changed. It was no longer the tone of the man whom she loved for the past five years. “Get out of here. I will call you later!” he added.

Seeing this, Vanessa laughed. “Is this who you’ve been living with for the past year? What a joke.” She rolled her eyes. “No poise, no family, no worth. You’ve embarrassed yourself enough, Emery. Walk out with what little dignity you have left.” She snorted and took her fan from her purse. “Why would someone like you think that we would approve of this relationship? A mere secretary with no family to back her up? Who gave you the guts?”

Emery looked at Samuel, who simply rubbed his temple as if this was a mere nuisance from one of his businesses. “Answer me!” Emery’s voice rose. “You’ve been with me for five years. You held me every night. I—I thought there was us!”

He looked at her. But the loving eyes that he used to stare at her with were no longer there. What replaced them was a cold and calculating gaze. “I have responsibilities, Em.”

The words hit harder than any slap. Responsibilities. Five years… Five years, and he would just drop a bomb like this because of… responsibilities?

That’s it?

When she said nothing, Samuel let out a sigh. “Mom, please leave us.”

“Leave you?” Vanessa scoffed.

“Talia needs you,” Samuel sighed. That was enough to get his mother’s attention.

“Fine. But you better fix this mess, Samuel, or I will ask the board to kick you out tomorrow morning!”

With that, Vanessa gestured for the guards to leave them as well before she glared at Emery and marched inside Samuel’s office.

Once alone, Samuel turned to her. “I’m sorry. But I have to do this.”

Her heart cracked. “Do what, Sam?”

“Talia’s family... their company’s investing. This marriage—it’s important for the future.”

She stared at him. “And what about me?” What about the last five years of her life? What about the deal that she made with her father? Tonight was supposed to be the night she would reveal her identity. Tonight was supposed to be their night!

He hesitated. “Talia can give me children.”

“What?” Her voice broke. “You said you didn’t want any—”

“I changed my mind,” he said flatly. “She’s younger and—she can easily give me an heir.”

Her chest caved. “So that’s it? You’re marrying her for her womb and her money?”

He looked away.

“I was going to tell you everything tonight,” she whispered, voice barely holding together. “I made a deal with my father—for you. For us.”

Her lips trembled. She had walked away from her family, from a life of power and privilege, just to prove that love didn’t need a name, a title, or bloodlines. She wanted to show her father that she could be chosen simply for who she was.

But now… now the silence from the man she loved cut deeper than any rejection.

Tears streamed down her cheeks as her chest tightened. “What about us, Sam?” she asked, her voice breaking.

He didn’t flinch, as if he was already expecting her question. “If you wait,” he said slowly, “If you wait until everything is settled... I’ll divorce her. We can be together again.”

“You want me to wait?” Her voice came out hollow. “You want me to wait while you marry her? Sleep beside her? Build a family with her?” Her throat tightened, eyes burning. “How can you say that to me?”

How could he stand there and say it like it meant nothing?

“If you really loved me,” he said. “You’d wait.”

There wasn’t a trace of hesitation in his voice—no remorse, no guilt.

She stepped back, eyes wide. Was this really the same man she had loved for the past few years?

“Please, Em, don’t look at me like that,” he muttered. “You always knew my mother would never—”

“I gave you everything,” she whispered. “Everything.”

“And now I need more,” he said, his voice colder than ice as he reached out and held her hand. “You can’t be that selfish, right? I need to secure my legacy. You don’t belong in that world, Em. You never did. However— However, my legacy is for us. For our future.”

Something inside her shattered—something she had guarded through every heartbreak, every betrayal. It splintered like glass hurled against concrete, sharp and beyond repair.

She nodded slowly. Somehow the pain didn’t burn anymore. It froze. Solid. Deep.

“You’re right,” she said, calmly pulling her hand back and using it to wipe her tears away. “I don’t belong here. I—”

“She’s already pregnant,” Samuel suddenly revealed.

This time, Emery let out a chuckle.

“I have to marry her. You should understand this, right?”

Emery shook her head. She wanted to curse him, slap him, but she didn’t. She couldn’t. She swallowed. He tried to hold her hand, but she quickly moved to the side.

“Please…” she held her hand up and shook her head. “That’s enough.”

“What do you mean, that’s enough??” Samuel actually looked confused, which only infuriated her further.

She took a deep breath that she didn’t even realize she needed.

“Em?” For the second time, he tried to hold her hand.

This time, Emery took a step back.

“Don’t—” Emery gritted her teeth as she met his eyes. There was no warmth left in her gaze. Only ice.

It was the kind of cold that didn’t scream or shatter—it froze. Slow and lethal. Her stare didn’t shake, didn’t flicker. It held him there, like a warning carved into stone. Then she let out a steady breath before she added, “Don’t make me do something we’ll both regret.”

# You Wish

“This is such a stupid—like, incredibly stupid—idea, Em,” Nina muttered, shoving a hot coffee into Emery’s hands. “I know you’re rich. Filthy rich. But this?”

She glanced around the waiting area of the clinic and lowered her voice. “Why the hell would you do something like… artificial insemination?”

Emery didn’t answer. She couldn’t.

Her coat was still wrinkled from the struggle. Her blouse, slightly torn at the sleeve, hung off one shoulder. The smear of mascara under her eyes hadn’t faded, and her cheeks were still damp from crying. She hadn’t even changed her clothes. She had run straight here.

Nina sighed and reached out, trying to hold her hand. Emery slapped it away without looking up. “It’s my only choice,” she said, voice flat.

“Only choice?” Nina blinked at her, completely thrown. “What does that even mean? How the hell did I end up with a friend like you?”

When Emery didn’t respond, Nina cursed softly. “That bastard Samuel,” she hissed. “This is his fault! I still can’t believe he threw you away like that. For what? A damn business deal?” She gestured wildly with one hand. “Alright, we should leave. You can still find a man who would marry you. There are literally billions of men out there. Half of them would kill to marry you if you gave them the time of day.”

Emery gave a dry, humorless chuckle and sipped the coffee. “I don’t need a man to be happy,” she said. “I just need a baby.”

She didn’t elaborate. She didn’t have the energy.

She was certain that her father already saw the news about Samuel and Talia. Her phone hadn’t stopped buzzing—calls from her father, from her brother, even from his assistant. She ignored them all. Talking meant admitting she lost. It meant acknowledging that Samuel had chosen someone else. That her five-year plan had ended in public humiliation and a slap from his mother.

So she stayed quiet.

But the longer she stayed silent, the more something inside her shifted. She didn’t want to fix things anymore. She didn’t want to go back. What she wanted now was control. And to take back control, she needed one thing.

An heir.

She came prepared. She wasn’t going to marry someone just to have a child. Her father would explode if he found out she was going through with artificial insemination, but that wasn’t her concern anymore. She was done living by rules designed by men.

Nina opened her mouth to say something else, but a nurse stepped into the waiting area.

“Emery Vaughn?”

Nina sighed. “Go ahead. I’m gonna run to the restroom real quick.”

Emery nodded, grabbed her coffee, and followed the nurse. As she reached into her purse to grab her phone, it buzzed. She turned without thinking—and walked straight into something solid.

Not something.

Someone. A hard chest, warm and very real.

She swore and stumbled back, glaring up. “Seriously? Do you not look where you’re going?”

Her gaze traveled up the man’s broad chest, past his ruined white shirt—now splashed with mascara and coffee—up to his face.

Tall. Easily six-four, maybe more. Lean, but built like someone who worked out in secret. His leather jacket clung perfectly to his frame. His black hair looked like he styled it with his fingers, and his stubble only added to the whole rugged and dangerous vibe.

And then she saw his eyes. Light brown, almost golden in the light.

Gemstone eyes on a man built like a sin. How annoying.

Her brain stalled. Was she starting to hate men because of Samuel!?

Then he opened his mouth.

“I don’t know what kind of game you’re playing, but I’m not interested.”

He brushed past her like she was a damn lamppost.

Her jaw dropped. “Excuse me?” Not even an apology?

However, he didn’t stop. “If this is your way of flirting, next time try not to dump overpriced coffee all over someone’s shirt.” Then he let his eyes travel down her clothes. “And at least dress better. You look like a corpse.”

She stormed after him. “Excuse me? You walked into me, jackass. And if you hadn’t been standing in the middle of the hallway like some oversized furniture—”

“So it’s my fault you weren’t watching where you were going.”

“Maybe if you weren’t built like a moving wall,” she snapped, stepping closer. “Who even walks around that tall in a hallway like this is a catwalk?”

He tilted his head. “Not my fault you’re small.”

“I’m not small. You’re just freakishly tall.”

He shrugged. “Still not my problem.”

She let out a sharp breath. First Samuel. Now this? Men are hateful. Period!

He stepped around her, clearly done with the conversation, but Emery wasn’t finished. She spun on her heel and followed him, matching his pace. “How can you be so rude? The least that you can do is apologize!”

He stopped, glanced over his shoulder, and gave her a once-over—slow, dismissive, infuriating.

Then he smirked.

That arrogant smirk made her fingers twitch around her coffee cup. Only basic human decency kept her from flinging it at his face.

“Unbelievable,” she muttered under her breath. “They’re really letting anyone donate now, huh?” She shot him a glare. “Maybe I should ask the clinic to reconsider your application—wouldn’t want some poor kid growing up with your personality.”

He looked like he’d walked straight off the cover of a magazine—tall, smug, and unfairly attractive in that dangerous, ruin-your-life kind of way. Of course, he was here to donate. Some rich couple was probably lining up to pay a fortune for a baby with his cheekbones and ego.

Just as she hoped, his smirk faltered—just enough to satisfy her.

“What did you just say?” His voice dropped, low and controlled, as he stepped toward her.

The air shifted. He was close now—too close. Her breath caught, but she held her ground, refusing to look away even as something electric danced between them.

She was about to respond when the nurse called her name again. Emery clenched her jaw, shot him one last death glare, and stormed down the hallway.

Jerk.

She took one step, and her foot slipped over the wet tile where the coffee had spilled. Her heel skidded forward, and her balance disappeared.

“Oh, come on—” She braced for impact.

But she never hit the floor.

Instead, she felt two strong arms catch her—one around her back, the other gripping her wrist. Her body slammed into a firm chest, the impact knocking the air out of her lungs.

Her eyes flew open.

Of course. It was him.

The same ruined white shirt. The same smug expression.

She froze, hands awkwardly pressed against his chest. He didn’t move. He didn’t let go.

“You really know how to leave an impression,” he said, his gaze locked on hers.

Emery shoved at him immediately. “Let go.”

He released her without hesitation. “You’re welcome.”

“I didn’t ask for your help.”

“You were falling headfirst into the tile. I figured embarrassment was better than a concussion.”

She yanked herself upright and adjusted her coat, brushing her skirt with quick, irritated hands. “Maybe if someone didn’t block hallways like a damn redwood tree—”

He cut her a glance, unimpressed, and walked right past her without a word.

That only pissed her off more.

She spun after him. “You didn’t even apologize.”

“You’re the one who spilled the coffee.”

“I tripped because of the coffee that spilled because of you!”

He glanced over his shoulder, completely unfazed. “Sounds like a personal problem. If you’re here for therapy, wrong clinic.”

Emery opened her mouth, fully ready to tear into him, but the nurse at the end of the hall called her name again—louder this time, with a hint of impatience.

She clenched her jaw, gave him one last searing glare, and turned on her heel. “God, I hope no one picks your DNA,” she muttered.

Without turning around, his voice drifted back—

“You wish.”

# My Scent On You

“I still can’t believe you went through with it,” Nina said as they stepped out of the clinic. She kept one hand under Emery’s elbow, steadying her. “You’re not supposed to move around this much right after the procedure. Can you slow down?”

Emery kept walking, one hand resting on her stomach. “Relax. I’m with a doctor.”

“I’m a dentist,” Nina said. “Whose working for her father’s company.”

“It’s still a doctor,” Emery said over her shoulder. “That has to count for something.”

Nina sighed. “Not in this situation, it doesn’t.”

The two of them continued walking across the lot. The procedure hadn’t taken long. The doctor advised her to rest for a while afterward, but Emery had wanted to leave right away and go home to sleep.

She felt a little lightheaded but kept going. This wasn’t their first time here. Emery had met the doctor at an event, and Nina had pulled some strings with the clinic owner to secure a quick appointment. It wasn’t the ideal process—but nothing about this was ideal.

The sun was too bright for her mood. Her heels scraped against the pavement as she followed Nina toward the car. Her legs still felt heavy, but she didn’t complain.

They were halfway there when a car swerved into the parking lot, tires screeching as it stopped just a few feet in front of them.

Emery flinched and took a quick step back. Her balance shifted, and she almost lost it again.

Nina grabbed her arm immediately. “Are you okay?”

“I’m fine,” Emery said, though her heart was thudding hard now.

The car door opened. Emery’s eyes narrowed as she looked at it. “You’ve got to be kidding me.”

“You really have the guts to—” Nina wasn’t able to finish her words when Samuel rushed toward them.

“What happened? You look pale. Are you alright?” He reached for Emery’s arm.

She stepped back immediately. “Don’t.”

He froze, but didn’t move away. “Emery, I got scared. I saw your location and thought something happened.”

She stared at him. “How did you know I was here?”

He pulled his phone from his pocket. “We’re still sharing locations. When I saw you near this place, I panicked. There are hospitals and clinics all over this building—I didn’t know what you were doing. Did something happen?”

“That’s none of your business,” she said. Her hand moved to her phone instinctively. She would remove him from that feature the moment she got in the car.

“I just wanted to make sure you were okay.”

“I will be okay, Samuel!” She stepped back again. “Don’t touch me.”

“You’re still mad about the news?”

Emery didn’t answer. She stood still. Mad about the news? This man really had the nerve to ask her that after everything?

“We’ve been together for five years,” he said. “You should know better than to get upset over something like this. You knew your status. You knew my parents would never approve. Em, will you stop moving and talk to me?”

Her jaw clenched. It was all about status. Status here. Status there. She hated it!

“But that doesn’t mean we should break up,” he added. “I love you. I still want you by my side.”

She looked at him.

“The marriage is only on paper. You’re still my priority. We can still—”

Her hand moved fast. The slap echoed across the lot, cutting him off mid-sentence. His head turned with the force of it.

“How dare you!” Emery asked.

“Em—”

“You disgust me!” Emery hissed, her eyes narrowed. Her head was spinning, but she didn’t care. She needed to let it out.

“Em, please—”

She slapped him again. Harder this time.

Samuel’s expression changed immediately. “Enough!” He stepped toward her. “That’s enough. Stop throwing a tantrum!”

He reached for her arm again, but Nina stepped between them.

“Don’t touch her!” Nina said, pushing him back.

However, Samuel shoved her aside without thinking. Nina stumbled and hit the pavement with a sharp grunt.

“Nina!” Emery turned, but Samuel grabbed her arm before she could check on her friend.

“There can only be me, Emery. You understand?” His grip tightened around both of her arms.

“Let go of me!” she shouted.

“I’m doing this for us,” Samuel said, holding her tighter. “Once the Ardens are done with the investments, I can do whatever I want with Talia. Once she gives birth, I’ll divorce her. Then we can be together.”

Emery struggled. “Let go of me!”

“Will you stop moving and listen to me!?” Samuel snapped, his eyes narrowed. “Stop being such a selfish cunt, Em. You know I don’t like those type of women! You should see I’m doing all this for our future. I kept you hidden for a reason. You think I liked it? I had no choice. My family—”

“I said, let me go!” she shouted again, louder this time. Her legs shook. Her shoulder ached where he held her.

Samuel opened his mouth to speak, but before he could say anything, a fist slammed into his jaw, knocking him backward.

He staggered and fell to the ground.

Emery felt warm arms wrap around her. She clutched the front of the shirt, her body trembling. Her knees nearly gave out, but whoever held her didn’t let her fall. A clean smell immediately filled her nose.

Not the clean disinfectant smell in the clinic. No. He smelled clean—lemon and musk, something earthy and sharp that clung to his skin and clothes. It grounded her more than she wanted to admit.

For the first time since stepping out of that clinic, Emery exhaled. Her chest ached, but her body slowly began to settle. It felt like the ground had finally stopped tilting beneath her feet.

“Are you alright?” a deep, familiar voice filled her ears. Emery stiffened when she realized she was holding onto the coffee-stained shirt she had seen earlier.

“Hey…” He steadied her, one hand supporting her back, the other bracing her arm.

Before she could respond, Samuel’s voice cut through the moment. “Don’t you dare touch her! Let her go! Who the hell do you think you are?”

“You think you’re strong? Putting your hands on someone half your size?” the man before Emery responded. “Try it with me. See how far that strength gets you!”

Emery noticed Nina scrambled to her feet, still shaky, and rushed to her side. She slipped her arm around her, eyes flicking between the two men. “Are you alright?” Nina asked.

Emery, however, was too focused on the man standing in front of her. Samuel didn’t take threats lightly—she knew that. But this man was at least four inches taller, broader too, and there was a quiet danger in the way he stood. She doubted Samuel would be stupid enough to actually pick a fight.

She gave a small nod to Nina’s question, just as Samuel took a step forward, fists clenched.

But the man stepped forward too, as if ready for a fight. He positioned himself in front of Emery like a shield, his eyes locked on Samuel. “You want a fight?” he said. “Touch her again, and I swear, I’ll break something that won’t heal right.”

Samuel stopped a few feet away. His jaw tightened, eyes scanning the man’s face. “Do you even know who I am?”

The man tilted his head slightly and gave a slow, mocking smile. “Can you use that name once you’re limping out of here in pieces? Or in a body bag?”

The silence that followed was thick.

However, it didn’t take too long before Samuel clicked his tongue and turned his glare on Emery. “This isn’t over, Em. Answer my calls. Let’s talk when you are not that angry.”

He spun around and marched back to his car. The door slammed shut a second later, the engine revving as the tires screeched and the vehicle pulled away.

Then, the man turned and stared at her. “You know, for someone so clumsy and loud, you’re lucky I was around. Again.” He paused, then added, “At this rate, you should probably put me on payroll.”

Emery snorted. This was indeed the second time he had saved her. She said nothing as she pulled her wallet from her bag, took out a couple of hundred-dollar bills, and shoved them against his chest.

“This should be enough.”

The man didn’t take the money. Instead, his hand closed around her wrist. Before she could react, he lifted it to his face and brought it close to his nose.

Her body froze.

He closed his eyes as he inhaled slowly, like he was trying to confirm something. She tried to pull back, but his grip was firm. Too firm.

When he opened his eyes again, she paused. Something about the way he looked at her had changed. There was something sharper—darker.

Then he asked, “Why do you have my scent on you?”

# Pregnant With My Child

“Excuse me?” Emery tried to pull her hand away, but his grip tightened.

“Why do you have my scent on you?” he repeated.

She snorted. “I don’t know what you’re talking about. Let go.”

Nina stepped in, her expression hard. “She just had a procedure done, alright? Whatever this weird thing is, now’s not the time. Just take the money and go.”

He didn’t move. His eyes stayed locked on Emery’s face.

“Hey,” Emery said sharply. “Let go. If that money’s not enough, I’ll give you more. Just let go.”

Her knees buckled a little. She staggered.

He caught her again.

But instead of steadying her and letting go, he pulled her closer. His arms went around her.

Then he leaned in and inhaled like he was trying to smell something specific.

Emery’s expression twisted. She pushed at his chest.

“What the hell are you doing?”

Sadly, the man seemed to be so engrossed in his own world and didn’t let her go.

“I’m not mistaken,” he said. “You have my scent on you.”

Emery frowned, and then she shoved him hard. “Back off.” What scent? Is this man high or something?

Nina also grabbed her arm and pulled her a step back.

“You’re insane,” Emery muttered. “We’ve never met before today.”

He stared at her. “You were in that clinic.”

“So were you,” Emery snapped. “That doesn’t mean anything.”

He glanced at her stomach, then back to her face. “What procedure did you have?”

Emery didn’t answer. She just glared at him.

Nina quickly stepped between them. “We’re leaving. Please don’t follow us, or I will call the cops.”

“What procedure did you have?” the man said, ignoring Nina’s threats.

However, she already had no intention of saying another word. With Nina’s help, she walked towards their car, leaving the man standing there alone, on his own.

From inside the car, Emery looked out the window. The man was still standing there, motionless, like he was trying to figure something out. She couldn’t really see his eyes, but she was pretty certain he looked angry, fuming.

Nina glanced at him through the windshield, then started the engine. “Don’t mind him. Just rest. There are a lot of weird people like that.”

Emery didn’t respond right away. She kept watching him. Something about him didn’t sit right. She couldn’t explain it, but it felt off.

Nina pulled out of the parking lot. “Are you really sure you want to stay at my apartment? It’s small.”

“I don’t have a choice,” Emery said. She took out her phone and opened the settings. She found the location-sharing feature and turned it off. Then she opened her notes app and typed a reminder to do the same on her laptop and other devices later.

The drive was quiet after that. It didn’t take long before they reached Nina’s apartment building. It was a secure place in Florida, tucked in a high-end area. Samuel knew where it was, but the security here was tight. They could easily tell the guards to deny him access if it came to that.

Emery stepped out of the car and reached for her bag. Then she paused for a moment. It felt like someone was watching her. She quickly glanced around the parking lot, but quickly realized that no one was there. After a second, she shook her head and followed Nina toward the building.

After everything that happened with Samuel, one thing was clear—she needed therapy. And not later. She needed it now. But first, she needed to rest.

They entered the lobby and crossed to the elevator without speaking. The ride to the sixth floor was quiet as well.

Emery had been there before and was familiar with the place. She liked how the building was sleek and upscale, with polished floors and subtle lighting that gave everything a muted glow. It was the kind of place where rent alone could cover someone else’s mortgage, and Emery knew not many people could afford to live here. It was the perfect place for her to hide until she found a new place for herself.

When they entered the apartment, Nina walked straight to her room and grabbed her keys. “You know where the guest room is. I need to pick up a few things. And some clothes for you.”

Emery immediately reached into her bag and held out her card.

Nina shook her head. “Don’t do that again. I’m just helping.”

Emery exhaled and slid the card back into her wallet. “Fine.” She and Nina had been friends for years, long before money ever mattered. Both came from wealthy families in New York and splitting bills or covering for each other had never been a big deal. It was just how they were.

Once Nina left, Emery walked to the guest room. She opened the small dresser and found a pair of old pajamas she had left there a long time ago. They were wrinkled but clean.

She went to the bathroom, washed up, changed clothes, and dried her hair with a towel she found under the sink. Then she crawled into bed and pulled the blanket over herself.

She didn’t bother checking her phone again. She had already blocked Samuel’s number, but the latter shamelessly used a new number to try and call her. Sadly, she couldn’t just turn her phone off. She closed her eyes. She was too tired.

For now, all she wanted was to sleep. And she did.

A knock pulled Emery from sleep.

She sat up slowly, eyes still adjusting. Her head felt heavy. She grabbed her phone from the nightstand and checked the time. She’d been out for over three hours. She quickly checked her messages and found a message from Nina: \[Running late. Won’t make it for dinner. There’s food in the fridge. Rest. I’ll be back later.\]

Emery sighed and tossed the phone on the bed. Her stomach growled, but she ignored it for now. She stood, brushed her hair back with her fingers, and walked out of the room.

The knock came again.

Without thinking, she reached for the door and opened it.

Her eyes widened the second she saw who was standing on the other side.

Tall. Broad shoulders. The same leather jacket. And those light brown eyes—too gold to be normal, too beautiful to forget.

Her heart skipped a beat.

“You’ve got to be kidding me,” she said.

She tried to shut the door, but he blocked it with one hand.

“We need to talk.”

Emery sighed and leaned her forehead against the edge of the door. Her grip on the knob tightened until her knuckles turned white. “I swear, my luck lately is unbelievable. Look, if you’re not leaving, I’m calling the police.”

He didn’t move. His expression shifted, his jaw tensed, and something flickered behind his eyes like he was choosing his next words carefully. “I think you’re pregnant with my child.”

Emery’s head snapped up. Her eyes locked on his. For a second, she didn’t move, didn’t breathe. Then she started laughing. “That’s it… I’m calling the cops.”

I've posted here before and had a few fun and interesting chats, but I'm still looking for a real connection. Anything real or worthwhile is hard to find in the sea of ""fakeness"" these days.  That goes for real life and on dating apps. There's a lot of people who like to ghost and not say anything. It's unfortunate that a lot of people are so fake but I'm holding out hope that I can meet the right person either IRL or online eventually. :) 

Let's actually normalize being genuine and nice to each other? \*mind blown

**About me:**

I'm a 30 year old average looking white dude with an average physique from North Carolina. I'm not hellbent on staying here either. In fact, I am actually looking to leave. I look pretty young and still get carded all the time, lol. College educated with a bachelors degree, a decent career in sales and own my own business. No debt or kids & financially responsible, but I love to have fun too.

I love camping/hiking and traveling! I think I've been to over 30 states! I love listening to music & playing PC games. I also enjoy reading and listening to audiobooks/podcasts. I would like to get a motorcycle at some point. I'm pretty easygoing generally. I'm also open to trying any new hobbies with my partner that they'd like to introduce me to. I enjoy going to food festivals and trying new types of food too. One day, I'd like to have a house in the mountains with a few acres of land that is completely paid off. I've also thought about figuring out how to work from home and do the whole camper van travelling thing and work from my laptop. I have a streak of free-spirted energy in me I guess. Would be awesome to escape the ""system"" in small ways. Who wants to be on a debt treadmill their whole life? Not me! I'm 420 friendly but I don't really partake with the exception of the rare edible a few times per year just to relax.

Honestly I am a pretty social and goofy guy. I would describe myself as an ambivert. INTJ, dry/dark sense of humor, I love making people laugh when I can. A bit nerdy at times, mainly about PC games and history.

**What I'm looking for:**

I am looking to connect with someone worthwhile and sane between the ages of 22-35 with no kids. Preferably inside the USA! I like text chatting but calling is ideal and better in my opinion. Obviously I don't expect you to call me right away but it's a much better way of actually getting to know someone. Which if we aren't doing that, then what are we doing?

I am a very dedicated and affectionate person in relationships, and really try my best even though I am nowhere near perfect. (Not even close.) I try to understand the other person I'm with to the best of my ability and be thoughtful and caring. I just want to find something peaceful with someone one day. I love hugs.

I want to be around someone who gives me peace and to be able to sit around a campfire with you sipping coffee and making smores or having a picnic having a deep hearty laugh. Maybe play video games together too. I'd love to feel completely comfortable around you. I would like to get to know eachother on a deeper level than ever before, if it feels right. I'd like to find someone who is okay with me showing emotions even though I am a guy. Someone I could take on cute dates and treat well. At this phase I am dating with intent. Honestly just looking for my best friend that I haven't met yet. 

I would like to one day find the person I am meant to be with, and if there are things wrong, we can fix them together hopefully.

Anyway, that should give you a good taste of what you're in for if you decide to reach out. If you like the sounds of any of this, shoot me a message and we'll chat. :)",1,1756526456.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

I carry a heavy load and… I need to talk, maybe someone who went through stuff like this can help me.

My dad is 67, mom also in 60s. Dad… had a father who beat him so bad… belt, skin all swollen… he became drug addict, drop school, homeless, almost killed himself, then found a Christian place, rehab, ok. Then he met mom. She was doing charity with Christian groups in prisons and stuff.

Mom was youngest of 5 kids. Sister sick, treated her bad all childhood, “deal with it” they said. Mom’s mom only cared boys. Dad was the figure mom loved most… like god to her.

I born soon after they met. Mom wanted kid, try again after losing one in first marriage. Dad… just tool for that. Questionable.

I grew up with domestic violence. First memory strong: 4-5 years old, lying on dad chest. He argue with mom, dark room only tv light, she carry plastic jar of coffee, he throw it on her.

Verbal abuse extreme. “Bitch”, “whore”, “worthless” normal.

I just wanted family, wanted dad, loved him more than mom. Mom… weird. Rejected hugs/kisses as kid, then smothered me with kisses, literally suffocate me… still now sometimes.

Financially fucked. Went best school city first years only cause principal friend mom. At home no food, no rent year, evicted, live with grandma. Grandma… another demon. Two TVs, couldn’t watch cartoons, mom pay her. Three sofas. Broken one for me, good ones for her kids.

Life go on. 11, bit stable. Later inherit house from dad relative. Life smile but dreams… no future with them.

Pandemic. Lockdown. Arguments up. Mom do sex chat with men. Stupid do it no privacy. Dad find out. Hell. Months wake up screams, insults, abuse mom. Dad never hit, but intimidation always. Physical violence? yeah.

Mom fight back. Dad turn off tv, humiliate her cause house family, even deed in all our names.

As kid I beg him stop. Maybe cry. “Dad stop… do it for me.”

One day, 5-6 hours arguments, dad say worst things, then: “surely first child you had die cause you fuck another guy.” I 15-16, cry hug kiss him begging stop.

He didn’t. So… I punch him. Didn’t knock out. He run kitchen grab knives. Thought die. Beg forgive. He patrol whole night say “never think you do this” make me feel guilty… years later remind me.

Room mom and me… no door, just curtain. Never knew if he come… kill us.

Next day tell mom go prosecutor, press charges, divorce for me. Can’t live like that.

Next day… nothing. Calm. She talk to him like nothing. Hell back anyway.

Old me didn’t come back. New me… violent demon. Yell, insult, break stuff. Hear them argue, bang everything, scream so loud blocks away.

Police? Never. Pandemic + shitty country = zero.

Hell years. Pandemic end. Mom could go back mother house… almost die after fall. Then just dad and me. Mom visit every 3 days.

I hate parents.

Talk mom hours. 12-20 hours last 5-6 years explaining I understand everything. Her trauma, dad trauma, why I hurt. Didn’t matter. She dumb.

Dad more capable. Mom say “I suffer more”, “not bad mom”, “why like this?”, “when move on?” I cry explain again. She can’t.

Dad health worse 2 years. Thyroid, Alzheimer start. Skinny, weak. No threat.

In the case of the ""naval treaty"" a former colleague of Watson's calls him and Sherlock to help him. It turns out that this friend had a very important position in the government, his uncle had entrusted him with taking care of a document, a naval treaty so important that it would affect entire countries.



One night, while he was making a copy of the document, he went to see the butler who had been late with his coffee (he fell asleep), while they were talking, the bell in his room rang, they ran to the room but the document was no longer there, the chase was useless.



There was no way to track the thief. The man was sick because of this and his wife and his wife's brother took care of him.

  
The terrain through which the thief fled was rough and random, Sherlock could deduce almost nothing from the footprints due to their deformity. Left without many resources, Sherlock formulated theories and sent statements to the newspaper, without much hope. The next day the sick man, now more recovered, brought news.



This event was discussed in a room where the wife, Watson, the victim of the robbery, his wife and his brother were.



Since he had recovered, he had not taken painkillers that night, he didnt fall sleep, so he heard someone forcing the window at night, upon seeing it, he found a man with a knife who ran away.



Now the mysteries, is it that he wanted to enter the room, the same thief? Or did he want to kill him, and that's why the knife?

  
Here is how Sherlock solved the problem, he devised a plan and strategy at great speed, it consisted of these steps.



1\_ upon finishing hearing the man's assault in the night, everyone leaves the room to explore a meadow, Sherlock takes advantage of the fact that the wife's brother is away to talk to her, in a few seconds he convinces the wife to stay in the room where the document was stolen (the husband's) throughout the day until night, this because Sherlock knew with cold reading how devoted she was, taking care of her sick husband.



2\_ he convinced the others that they had to take Watson's friend and Watson himself to London to investigate more about the robbery, clarifying that it was very important, he justified it by saying that if Watson's friend, still sick from stress, was in good hands because Watson is a doctor, getting Joseph, the wife's brother, to stay at the residence.



3\_ In the carriage on the way to London, Sherlock leaves the carriage to return to the residence by walking, leaving Watson and his friend in London and assuring them that the case will go well.



4\_ Sherlock waits until nightfall near the house, sees the wife through the window, who had followed his instructions, she leaves the room at the indicated time (10 pm) and locks the door from the outside, Sherlock enters through the window, closing it from the inside and stays in the room, waiting.

  
5\_ In the middle of the night the man, who turns out to be the wife's brother, Joseph, enters the room, forcing the window with a knife, Sherlock let him be in the room for a few seconds before seeing him, this to make him reveal the exact spot where he hide the document, after struggling, Sherlock does not leave him unconscious, he lets him flee, recovers the documents, calls the London police to monitor all possible escape routes (transport) and explains the situation



6\_ arrives in London with Watson and his friend, delivering the document



What exactly did he do?



Sherlock was suspicious of Joseph from the beginning, he looked very good and his performance was impressive, as he himself said, but we know how Sherlock's abilities are to see through people, but the first day he had no evidence against anyone, when Watson's friend described the man, at that moment, Sherlock deduced the following;

  
The thief and the alleged attempted murderer are the same person due to probability and the fact that Watson's friend is a good man and will not have more than one or two enemies, the knife must have been to force the window and not necessarily to murder, the thief went in the middle of the night, believing that Watson's friend was sleeping, he ran when discovered.



Taking into account that he is the thief, we know that he entered the robbery room through the main hallway, while Watson's friend was talking to the butler, so it was likely that it was someone familiar with the residence, so why did he ring the door bell, and reveal his presence? easy, it wasn't planned



Joseph was ruined in economic terms due to bad investments, we already know that Sherlock saw through him from the beginning, he was not a good person, Sherlock recreated the facts.



When Watson's friend went to the butler and left the documents on his table, Joseph entered the room by coincidence, leaving because his brother-in-law was not there, at the same time as ringing the bell, he saw the documents and assumed that they were valuable, and took them as a means to obtain money and ran because he knew they would chase him inmediatly

  
When he took a train and checked the documents, he realized how valuable they were, he returned to the house and decided to hide them in the same room from which he stole them. Unfortunately, when Watson's friend fell ill, he did not have the opportunity to recover them, so he probably took a stronger drug to make him sleep more soundly (stronger that the one the nurse was giving him) and planned to go in at night and steal the documents again.



But Watson's friend had gotten better and didn't take the sleeping drug, so the sighting happened.



With this, Sherlock devised the aforementioned plan and used those steps, knowing that Joseph, upon seeing his sister in the room, would only try it at night, entering through the same window, Sherlock made him flee and did not arrest him so that Watson's friend and his boss would take care of it, since he assumed that they did not want that theft or carelessness of theirs to happen to be know by the goverment.

  
In short, Sherlock did all that reasoning and found the culprit, he devised a plan in which he manipulated the husband's sister and deceived his brother, culminating in obtaining documents and a perfect outcome for the work reputation of Watson's friend, all of this in a few seconds, which were after Watson's friend's explanation about the man in the window, and before everyone went out to explore the surroundings.

  
of course, theres more things and characters in this case, but i tried to make a summary and maintaining the most important things so you can understand what sherlock did and in what conditions.",1,1756525814.0,IntelligenceScaling,0,1.0,False

well, just the other day I was walking back up the street to my house. A older male came riding down the street on his bike. His bike has a small to medium black crate attached on the back. He also, if I remember correctly had a gray or dark colored shirt with some type of logo on it. Maybe what? Maybe? He was definitely older, gray hair old.

 I’m a quite literally maybe one or two houses from my own. He stops to ask me something along the lines of. If I’ve seen his cat named sugar and or if I could help him to find his cat. I might’ve said no? But I mostly just remained silent and shook my head. I walked past him on the way to my house. He starts calling out for his supposed cat named sugar.

Emery Vaughn was about to hand over a billion-dollar empire—and she couldn’t stop smiling.

“On a scale of one to ‘please slap some sense into you,’ this ranks somewhere around full-blown insanity.”

Emery ignored her friend Nina’s words as she finished signing the transfer of shares that she prepared for her boyfriend, Samuel.

""Really... Em... Do you want me to slap you in case that would wake you up, or something?""

“Five years,” Emery said, signing the final page. “I tested him for five years—he passed.”

Nina grabbed the folder. “These will make him the largest shareholder of your father’s company, which is worth millions. Are you hearing yourself?”

“Worth billions,” Emery said with a grin. “And he stayed with me when he thought I was just an orphan intern. That kind of love deserves everything. Don’t you think so?”

She started walking out of the café and marched towards the opposite building—the very building that Samuel owned.

Nina jogged a step ahead to catch up. “Em, seriously. You need to think this through.”

“I already did. Five years, Nina. Five years of hiding who I really am. And he never once made me feel like I wasn’t enough,” Emery said, tightening her grip on her purse. “It’s time that I pay him back.”

Nina looked down at the folder in her hands. “You’re giving him everything.”

Emery nodded. “Because he earned it. Tomorrow, he’s going to meet my father and we can get married in secret. This is my dream, alright?”

They reached the building entrance when a sudden screech of tires made them stop. A sleek black car pulled up at the curb.

Before they could react, a wave of people swarmed the sidewalk. Reporters shoved their way forward, cameras flashing, mics shoved ahead. One of them clipped Emery’s shoulder, nearly knocking her off balance.

“Whoa!” Nina grabbed her, steadying her before she could fall.

“What the hell—” Emery started, but her words were drowned out by screams.

Fans were pushing past them now, shouting a woman’s name.

“Talia! Is Talia here?”

“Talia! We love you!”

“Talia, Look at me!”

Security immediately rushed to create a barrier, but the crowd kept moving forward. Because of this, Emery and Nina were pushed against the glass doors of the building. One of the security guards shoved a fan back, and in the chaos, both Emery and Nina stumbled to the ground.

Emery grabbed Nina’s arm and tried to stand, but another wave of screaming fans pressed toward the car. Her heart pounded as she pulled herself up. What the heck is going on? She turned her head just in time to see the door of the car open.

Then a familiar face stepped out.

Samuel Dwight. Her Samuel.

A woman got out of the car and stood next to him. It was another familiar face.

Almost immediately, the reporters shouted over one another.

“Mr. Samuel Dwight! Is it true you’re marrying Talia Arden?”

He paused for a second, adjusted his coat, then nodded. “Yes, it’s true. We’ll be holding the engagement ceremony very soon.”

Emery blinked.

Another reporter pushed forward. “Is it true she’s pregnant?”

Samuel looked straight ahead. “That’s a very personal matter. I hope you can respect our privacy.”

He had barely finished speaking when another PR handler beside him handed out printed invitations. “The ceremony will be held this Saturday at the Azure Grand Hotel. A formal press conference will follow.”

That set the crowd off. More fans rushed forward, shouting Talia’s name. Phones were lifted, flashes blinding. Several people shoved against each other, trying to get closer. It was almost impossible to move.

Emery held on to Nina tightly as they were pushed backward. One of the cameras hit her shoulder, hard enough to sting. Yet she ignored it as she looked at Samuel again.

He didn’t even glance in her direction. However, this was not enough to stop her. She marched inside the building, fuming as she followed behind Samuel.

“What the hell are you doing?” Nina asked, pulling her back.

“Did you hear that?” Emery asked, her face paling. At first, she wasn’t sure if she heard it correctly, but that was clearly Samuel. She wasn’t blind or deaf. That was him! “He’s marrying someone.”

Nina grabbed Emery’s arm. “Em, stop. Don’t do this. Not here.”

Emery yanked her arm free. “He’s marrying someone,” she said. “Someone that’s not me!”

She moved fast, weaving through the lobby and heading straight for the elevators. Samuel had just stepped inside with Talia and his secretary. Seeing this, Emery quickened her pace, but one of the guards blocked her path.

“Mr. Dwight asked not to be disturbed,” the guard said. “He wants to be alone with Miss Arden.”

Emery didn’t stop. “Do you know who I am?” she snapped, her voice loud enough for some people to notice.

That got Samuel’s attention. He looked at her—just for a moment. His eyes lingered, filled with something unreadable. But he said nothing, letting the elevator doors close.

“Oh, hell no.” Emery didn’t wait. She turned sharply and bolted toward the stairwell. She could hear Nina shout her name behind her, but Emery didn’t slow down.

“Emery! Emery, stop!”

Emery didn’t slow down. She yanked off her heels and clutched them in one hand, feet pounding up the stairs. Her breath came hard and fast. Her legs burned, her chest squeezed tight—but hey, all that cardio was finally paying off.

“Wait—just wait!” Nina called again, struggling behind her. Emery glanced back once to see Nina leaning against the railing on the sixth floor, gasping for air.

“Go,” Nina said between breaths. “Just go.”

Emery didn’t look back again.

By the tenth floor, her knees buckled slightly, her chest rising and falling fast. She pushed the door open and stepped into the hallway. Two men in black stood outside Samuel’s office. She recognized them—his personal security. Familiar faces. Faces that used to nod at her when she brought coffee when she left in the mornings when she stayed over.

She marched straight toward the door, heels still in hand.

“You can’t go in,” one of them said, stepping forward. “You’re not allowed on this floor without clearance.”

“Does he know I’m out here?” she asked.

“We’re following instructions,” the other guard said. “Please step away.”

“I’m not leaving,” Emery said. “Tell him I’m out here!”

Just as she expected, they didn’t move.

“Samuel!” she shouted, her voice echoing down the hallway. “Samuel, open the damn door!”

The two guards stepped in immediately. One of them reached for her arm.

“I said don’t touch me!” Emery snapped, backing away from the guards.

Before either of them could respond, the office door swung open.

Emery turned toward it, expecting Samuel.

Instead, Vanessa Dwight—Samuel’s mother—stepped out.

Emery barely had time to register the older woman’s expression before a hand shot out and struck her across the face.

The slap was sharp and fast, her cheek instantly stinging as her head jerked to the side. She stumbled back, heels slipping from her grip and hitting the floor with a dull thud. Her hand flew up to her cheek, but she didn’t speak. Not yet.

“Hold her down!” Vanessa barked.

Emery’s heart pounded as the guards hesitated. She couldn’t move, couldn’t speak—not from fear, but from the pure shock of it.

Then she heard him.

“Mom, what are you doing!?” Samuel’s voice cut through the noise.

Emery’s eyes snapped toward him, but her face burned too much to form a reply.

Vanessa didn’t pause. “I don’t understand why you would actually think my son would marry someone like you. You— I said hold her down! Today, I will teach this woman a lesson she will never forget!”

# What About Me?

“Let go of me!”

Emery’s voice tore through the sleek office hallway, sharp and trembling as the two guards held her down.

“Let go!” she struggled before she looked at Samuel. “Tell me it’s not true, Sam. Tell me you—”

Then another resounding slap followed. A white-hot sting bloomed across her cheek, jerking her head sideways. The scent of strong perfume hit her nose just before she saw the woman standing inches away—perfect red lips, manicured nails, and eyes full of disgust.

“Did you really think warming his bed would earn you a seat at our table?” Vanessa hissed.

Emery blinked, her cheek burning. Her gaze snapped to Samuel. He’d just stepped out of his office, but he didn’t say a word. Didn’t he see his mother slap her?

Why wasn’t he saying anything? Not a single word.

“Did you think throwing a tantrum here could save you?” Vanessa said. Again, she slapped Emery’s face. “I already warned you not to mess with Samuel! I warned you!”

This time, Samuel finally decided to intervene. He reached for her arm halfheartedly. “Mom, that’s enough—”

Emery barely heard him. Her body froze, trembling from rage, disbelief, and betrayal. Minutes ago, she’d been finalizing the share transfer—the very folder now somewhere on the floor with Nina. Five years. Tomorrow is their fifth anniversary. She was supposed to tell him everything today and introduce him to her father the very next day!

She looked at Samuel again. “Is it true?” Her voice cracked. She had been with him for five years and received a slap or two from his mother and sister, but this was not comparable to what she’d heard just now. “Are you really going to marry Talia?”

His eyes flickered. Guilt. It was there—just for a second. But it was enough.

He didn’t deny it.

Vanessa stepped between them like a wall of steel. “Of course he is! Did you honestly think you mattered?” She scoffed. “You were never anything more than a phase. A well-kept secret. And now, it’s over. Get out of this place, or I’ll have security throw you out.”

Emery clenched her fists. The words sliced deeper than any slap. Her heart raced. “Samuel,” she said. “Say something.” Why wasn’t he saying anything!?

In response, he shifted uncomfortably. “Em, let’s not do this now.” He signaled the guards to let her go, and they quickly complied.

“No!” she snapped as she struggled. “We’re doing this right now! Tell me it’s not true. Please…”

She stepped in front of him, grabbing his arm. “Look me in the eyes and tell me this is not true. Please, Sammy.”

However, he simply yanked his arm free, like her touch was a stain. “I said we’ll talk later.” This time, his tone changed. It was no longer the tone of the man whom she loved for the past five years. “Get out of here. I will call you later!” he added.

Seeing this, Vanessa laughed. “Is this who you’ve been living with for the past year? What a joke.” She rolled her eyes. “No poise, no family, no worth. You’ve embarrassed yourself enough, Emery. Walk out with what little dignity you have left.” She snorted and took her fan from her purse. “Why would someone like you think that we would approve of this relationship? A mere secretary with no family to back her up? Who gave you the guts?”

Emery looked at Samuel, who simply rubbed his temple as if this was a mere nuisance from one of his businesses. “Answer me!” Emery’s voice rose. “You’ve been with me for five years. You held me every night. I—I thought there was us!”

He looked at her. But the loving eyes that he used to stare at her with were no longer there. What replaced them was a cold and calculating gaze. “I have responsibilities, Em.”

The words hit harder than any slap. Responsibilities. Five years… Five years, and he would just drop a bomb like this because of… responsibilities?

That’s it?

When she said nothing, Samuel let out a sigh. “Mom, please leave us.”

“Leave you?” Vanessa scoffed.

“Talia needs you,” Samuel sighed. That was enough to get his mother’s attention.

“Fine. But you better fix this mess, Samuel, or I will ask the board to kick you out tomorrow morning!”

With that, Vanessa gestured for the guards to leave them as well before she glared at Emery and marched inside Samuel’s office.

Once alone, Samuel turned to her. “I’m sorry. But I have to do this.”

Her heart cracked. “Do what, Sam?”

“Talia’s family... their company’s investing. This marriage—it’s important for the future.”

She stared at him. “And what about me?” What about the last five years of her life? What about the deal that she made with her father? Tonight was supposed to be the night she would reveal her identity. Tonight was supposed to be their night!

He hesitated. “Talia can give me children.”

“What?” Her voice broke. “You said you didn’t want any—”

“I changed my mind,” he said flatly. “She’s younger and—she can easily give me an heir.”

Her chest caved. “So that’s it? You’re marrying her for her womb and her money?”

He looked away.

“I was going to tell you everything tonight,” she whispered, voice barely holding together. “I made a deal with my father—for you. For us.”

Her lips trembled. She had walked away from her family, from a life of power and privilege, just to prove that love didn’t need a name, a title, or bloodlines. She wanted to show her father that she could be chosen simply for who she was.

But now… now the silence from the man she loved cut deeper than any rejection.

Tears streamed down her cheeks as her chest tightened. “What about us, Sam?” she asked, her voice breaking.

He didn’t flinch, as if he was already expecting her question. “If you wait,” he said slowly, “If you wait until everything is settled... I’ll divorce her. We can be together again.”

“You want me to wait?” Her voice came out hollow. “You want me to wait while you marry her? Sleep beside her? Build a family with her?” Her throat tightened, eyes burning. “How can you say that to me?”

How could he stand there and say it like it meant nothing?

“If you really loved me,” he said. “You’d wait.”

There wasn’t a trace of hesitation in his voice—no remorse, no guilt.

She stepped back, eyes wide. Was this really the same man she had loved for the past few years?

“Please, Em, don’t look at me like that,” he muttered. “You always knew my mother would never—”

“I gave you everything,” she whispered. “Everything.”

“And now I need more,” he said, his voice colder than ice as he reached out and held her hand. “You can’t be that selfish, right? I need to secure my legacy. You don’t belong in that world, Em. You never did. However— However, my legacy is for us. For our future.”

Something inside her shattered—something she had guarded through every heartbreak, every betrayal. It splintered like glass hurled against concrete, sharp and beyond repair.

She nodded slowly. Somehow the pain didn’t burn anymore. It froze. Solid. Deep.

“You’re right,” she said, calmly pulling her hand back and using it to wipe her tears away. “I don’t belong here. I—”

“She’s already pregnant,” Samuel suddenly revealed.

This time, Emery let out a chuckle.

“I have to marry her. You should understand this, right?”

Emery shook her head. She wanted to curse him, slap him, but she didn’t. She couldn’t. She swallowed. He tried to hold her hand, but she quickly moved to the side.

“Please…” she held her hand up and shook her head. “That’s enough.”

“What do you mean, that’s enough??” Samuel actually looked confused, which only infuriated her further.

She took a deep breath that she didn’t even realize she needed.

“Em?” For the second time, he tried to hold her hand.

This time, Emery took a step back.

“Don’t—” Emery gritted her teeth as she met his eyes. There was no warmth left in her gaze. Only ice.

It was the kind of cold that didn’t scream or shatter—it froze. Slow and lethal. Her stare didn’t shake, didn’t flicker. It held him there, like a warning carved into stone. Then she let out a steady breath before she added, “Don’t make me do something we’ll both regret.”

# You Wish

“This is such a stupid—like, incredibly stupid—idea, Em,” Nina muttered, shoving a hot coffee into Emery’s hands. “I know you’re rich. Filthy rich. But this?”

She glanced around the waiting area of the clinic and lowered her voice. “Why the hell would you do something like… artificial insemination?”

Emery didn’t answer. She couldn’t.

Her coat was still wrinkled from the struggle. Her blouse, slightly torn at the sleeve, hung off one shoulder. The smear of mascara under her eyes hadn’t faded, and her cheeks were still damp from crying. She hadn’t even changed her clothes. She had run straight here.

Nina sighed and reached out, trying to hold her hand. Emery slapped it away without looking up. “It’s my only choice,” she said, voice flat.

“Only choice?” Nina blinked at her, completely thrown. “What does that even mean? How the hell did I end up with a friend like you?”

When Emery didn’t respond, Nina cursed softly. “That bastard Samuel,” she hissed. “This is his fault! I still can’t believe he threw you away like that. For what? A damn business deal?” She gestured wildly with one hand. “Alright, we should leave. You can still find a man who would marry you. There are literally billions of men out there. Half of them would kill to marry you if you gave them the time of day.”

Emery gave a dry, humorless chuckle and sipped the coffee. “I don’t need a man to be happy,” she said. “I just need a baby.”

She didn’t elaborate. She didn’t have the energy.

She was certain that her father already saw the news about Samuel and Talia. Her phone hadn’t stopped buzzing—calls from her father, from her brother, even from his assistant. She ignored them all. Talking meant admitting she lost. It meant acknowledging that Samuel had chosen someone else. That her five-year plan had ended in public humiliation and a slap from his mother.

So she stayed quiet.

But the longer she stayed silent, the more something inside her shifted. She didn’t want to fix things anymore. She didn’t want to go back. What she wanted now was control. And to take back control, she needed one thing.

An heir.

She came prepared. She wasn’t going to marry someone just to have a child. Her father would explode if he found out she was going through with artificial insemination, but that wasn’t her concern anymore. She was done living by rules designed by men.

Nina opened her mouth to say something else, but a nurse stepped into the waiting area.

“Emery Vaughn?”

Nina sighed. “Go ahead. I’m gonna run to the restroom real quick.”

Emery nodded, grabbed her coffee, and followed the nurse. As she reached into her purse to grab her phone, it buzzed. She turned without thinking—and walked straight into something solid.

Not something.

Someone. A hard chest, warm and very real.

She swore and stumbled back, glaring up. “Seriously? Do you not look where you’re going?”

Her gaze traveled up the man’s broad chest, past his ruined white shirt—now splashed with mascara and coffee—up to his face.

Tall. Easily six-four, maybe more. Lean, but built like someone who worked out in secret. His leather jacket clung perfectly to his frame. His black hair looked like he styled it with his fingers, and his stubble only added to the whole rugged and dangerous vibe.

And then she saw his eyes. Light brown, almost golden in the light.

Gemstone eyes on a man built like a sin. How annoying.

Her brain stalled. Was she starting to hate men because of Samuel!?

Then he opened his mouth.

“I don’t know what kind of game you’re playing, but I’m not interested.”

He brushed past her like she was a damn lamppost.

Her jaw dropped. “Excuse me?” Not even an apology?

However, he didn’t stop. “If this is your way of flirting, next time try not to dump overpriced coffee all over someone’s shirt.” Then he let his eyes travel down her clothes. “And at least dress better. You look like a corpse.”

She stormed after him. “Excuse me? You walked into me, jackass. And if you hadn’t been standing in the middle of the hallway like some oversized furniture—”

“So it’s my fault you weren’t watching where you were going.”

“Maybe if you weren’t built like a moving wall,” she snapped, stepping closer. “Who even walks around that tall in a hallway like this is a catwalk?”

He tilted his head. “Not my fault you’re small.”

“I’m not small. You’re just freakishly tall.”

He shrugged. “Still not my problem.”

She let out a sharp breath. First Samuel. Now this? Men are hateful. Period!

He stepped around her, clearly done with the conversation, but Emery wasn’t finished. She spun on her heel and followed him, matching his pace. “How can you be so rude? The least that you can do is apologize!”

He stopped, glanced over his shoulder, and gave her a once-over—slow, dismissive, infuriating.

Then he smirked.

That arrogant smirk made her fingers twitch around her coffee cup. Only basic human decency kept her from flinging it at his face.

“Unbelievable,” she muttered under her breath. “They’re really letting anyone donate now, huh?” She shot him a glare. “Maybe I should ask the clinic to reconsider your application—wouldn’t want some poor kid growing up with your personality.”

He looked like he’d walked straight off the cover of a magazine—tall, smug, and unfairly attractive in that dangerous, ruin-your-life kind of way. Of course, he was here to donate. Some rich couple was probably lining up to pay a fortune for a baby with his cheekbones and ego.

Just as she hoped, his smirk faltered—just enough to satisfy her.

“What did you just say?” His voice dropped, low and controlled, as he stepped toward her.

The air shifted. He was close now—too close. Her breath caught, but she held her ground, refusing to look away even as something electric danced between them.

She was about to respond when the nurse called her name again. Emery clenched her jaw, shot him one last death glare, and stormed down the hallway.

Jerk.

She took one step, and her foot slipped over the wet tile where the coffee had spilled. Her heel skidded forward, and her balance disappeared.

“Oh, come on—” She braced for impact.

But she never hit the floor.

Instead, she felt two strong arms catch her—one around her back, the other gripping her wrist. Her body slammed into a firm chest, the impact knocking the air out of her lungs.

Her eyes flew open.

Of course. It was him.

The same ruined white shirt. The same smug expression.

She froze, hands awkwardly pressed against his chest. He didn’t move. He didn’t let go.

“You really know how to leave an impression,” he said, his gaze locked on hers.

Emery shoved at him immediately. “Let go.”

He released her without hesitation. “You’re welcome.”

“I didn’t ask for your help.”

“You were falling headfirst into the tile. I figured embarrassment was better than a concussion.”

She yanked herself upright and adjusted her coat, brushing her skirt with quick, irritated hands. “Maybe if someone didn’t block hallways like a damn redwood tree—”

He cut her a glance, unimpressed, and walked right past her without a word.

That only pissed her off more.

She spun after him. “You didn’t even apologize.”

“You’re the one who spilled the coffee.”

“I tripped because of the coffee that spilled because of you!”

He glanced over his shoulder, completely unfazed. “Sounds like a personal problem. If you’re here for therapy, wrong clinic.”

Emery opened her mouth, fully ready to tear into him, but the nurse at the end of the hall called her name again—louder this time, with a hint of impatience.

She clenched her jaw, gave him one last searing glare, and turned on her heel. “God, I hope no one picks your DNA,” she muttered.

Without turning around, his voice drifted back—

“You wish.”

# My Scent On You

“I still can’t believe you went through with it,” Nina said as they stepped out of the clinic. She kept one hand under Emery’s elbow, steadying her. “You’re not supposed to move around this much right after the procedure. Can you slow down?”

Emery kept walking, one hand resting on her stomach. “Relax. I’m with a doctor.”

“I’m a dentist,” Nina said. “Whose working for her father’s company.”

“It’s still a doctor,” Emery said over her shoulder. “That has to count for something.”

Nina sighed. “Not in this situation, it doesn’t.”

The two of them continued walking across the lot. The procedure hadn’t taken long. The doctor advised her to rest for a while afterward, but Emery had wanted to leave right away and go home to sleep.

She felt a little lightheaded but kept going. This wasn’t their first time here. Emery had met the doctor at an event, and Nina had pulled some strings with the clinic owner to secure a quick appointment. It wasn’t the ideal process—but nothing about this was ideal.

The sun was too bright for her mood. Her heels scraped against the pavement as she followed Nina toward the car. Her legs still felt heavy, but she didn’t complain.

They were halfway there when a car swerved into the parking lot, tires screeching as it stopped just a few feet in front of them.

Emery flinched and took a quick step back. Her balance shifted, and she almost lost it again.

Nina grabbed her arm immediately. “Are you okay?”

“I’m fine,” Emery said, though her heart was thudding hard now.

The car door opened. Emery’s eyes narrowed as she looked at it. “You’ve got to be kidding me.”

“You really have the guts to—” Nina wasn’t able to finish her words when Samuel rushed toward them.

“What happened? You look pale. Are you alright?” He reached for Emery’s arm.

She stepped back immediately. “Don’t.”

He froze, but didn’t move away. “Emery, I got scared. I saw your location and thought something happened.”

She stared at him. “How did you know I was here?”

He pulled his phone from his pocket. “We’re still sharing locations. When I saw you near this place, I panicked. There are hospitals and clinics all over this building—I didn’t know what you were doing. Did something happen?”

“That’s none of your business,” she said. Her hand moved to her phone instinctively. She would remove him from that feature the moment she got in the car.

“I just wanted to make sure you were okay.”

“I will be okay, Samuel!” She stepped back again. “Don’t touch me.”

“You’re still mad about the news?”

Emery didn’t answer. She stood still. Mad about the news? This man really had the nerve to ask her that after everything?

“We’ve been together for five years,” he said. “You should know better than to get upset over something like this. You knew your status. You knew my parents would never approve. Em, will you stop moving and talk to me?”

Her jaw clenched. It was all about status. Status here. Status there. She hated it!

“But that doesn’t mean we should break up,” he added. “I love you. I still want you by my side.”

She looked at him.

“The marriage is only on paper. You’re still my priority. We can still—”

Her hand moved fast. The slap echoed across the lot, cutting him off mid-sentence. His head turned with the force of it.

“How dare you!” Emery asked.

“Em—”

“You disgust me!” Emery hissed, her eyes narrowed. Her head was spinning, but she didn’t care. She needed to let it out.

“Em, please—”

She slapped him again. Harder this time.

Samuel’s expression changed immediately. “Enough!” He stepped toward her. “That’s enough. Stop throwing a tantrum!”

He reached for her arm again, but Nina stepped between them.

“Don’t touch her!” Nina said, pushing him back.

However, Samuel shoved her aside without thinking. Nina stumbled and hit the pavement with a sharp grunt.

“Nina!” Emery turned, but Samuel grabbed her arm before she could check on her friend.

“There can only be me, Emery. You understand?” His grip tightened around both of her arms.

“Let go of me!” she shouted.

“I’m doing this for us,” Samuel said, holding her tighter. “Once the Ardens are done with the investments, I can do whatever I want with Talia. Once she gives birth, I’ll divorce her. Then we can be together.”

Emery struggled. “Let go of me!”

“Will you stop moving and listen to me!?” Samuel snapped, his eyes narrowed. “Stop being such a selfish cunt, Em. You know I don’t like those type of women! You should see I’m doing all this for our future. I kept you hidden for a reason. You think I liked it? I had no choice. My family—”

“I said, let me go!” she shouted again, louder this time. Her legs shook. Her shoulder ached where he held her.

Samuel opened his mouth to speak, but before he could say anything, a fist slammed into his jaw, knocking him backward.

He staggered and fell to the ground.

Emery felt warm arms wrap around her. She clutched the front of the shirt, her body trembling. Her knees nearly gave out, but whoever held her didn’t let her fall. A clean smell immediately filled her nose.

Not the clean disinfectant smell in the clinic. No. He smelled clean—lemon and musk, something earthy and sharp that clung to his skin and clothes. It grounded her more than she wanted to admit.

For the first time since stepping out of that clinic, Emery exhaled. Her chest ached, but her body slowly began to settle. It felt like the ground had finally stopped tilting beneath her feet.

“Are you alright?” a deep, familiar voice filled her ears. Emery stiffened when she realized she was holding onto the coffee-stained shirt she had seen earlier.

“Hey…” He steadied her, one hand supporting her back, the other bracing her arm.

Before she could respond, Samuel’s voice cut through the moment. “Don’t you dare touch her! Let her go! Who the hell do you think you are?”

“You think you’re strong? Putting your hands on someone half your size?” the man before Emery responded. “Try it with me. See how far that strength gets you!”

Emery noticed Nina scrambled to her feet, still shaky, and rushed to her side. She slipped her arm around her, eyes flicking between the two men. “Are you alright?” Nina asked.

Emery, however, was too focused on the man standing in front of her. Samuel didn’t take threats lightly—she knew that. But this man was at least four inches taller, broader too, and there was a quiet danger in the way he stood. She doubted Samuel would be stupid enough to actually pick a fight.

She gave a small nod to Nina’s question, just as Samuel took a step forward, fists clenched.

But the man stepped forward too, as if ready for a fight. He positioned himself in front of Emery like a shield, his eyes locked on Samuel. “You want a fight?” he said. “Touch her again, and I swear, I’ll break something that won’t heal right.”

Samuel stopped a few feet away. His jaw tightened, eyes scanning the man’s face. “Do you even know who I am?”

The man tilted his head slightly and gave a slow, mocking smile. “Can you use that name once you’re limping out of here in pieces? Or in a body bag?”

The silence that followed was thick.

However, it didn’t take too long before Samuel clicked his tongue and turned his glare on Emery. “This isn’t over, Em. Answer my calls. Let’s talk when you are not that angry.”

He spun around and marched back to his car. The door slammed shut a second later, the engine revving as the tires screeched and the vehicle pulled away.

Then, the man turned and stared at her. “You know, for someone so clumsy and loud, you’re lucky I was around. Again.” He paused, then added, “At this rate, you should probably put me on payroll.”

Emery snorted. This was indeed the second time he had saved her. She said nothing as she pulled her wallet from her bag, took out a couple of hundred-dollar bills, and shoved them against his chest.

“This should be enough.”

The man didn’t take the money. Instead, his hand closed around her wrist. Before she could react, he lifted it to his face and brought it close to his nose.

Her body froze.

He closed his eyes as he inhaled slowly, like he was trying to confirm something. She tried to pull back, but his grip was firm. Too firm.

When he opened his eyes again, she paused. Something about the way he looked at her had changed. There was something sharper—darker.

Then he asked, “Why do you have my scent on you?”

# Pregnant With My Child

“Excuse me?” Emery tried to pull her hand away, but his grip tightened.

“Why do you have my scent on you?” he repeated.

She snorted. “I don’t know what you’re talking about. Let go.”

Nina stepped in, her expression hard. “She just had a procedure done, alright? Whatever this weird thing is, now’s not the time. Just take the money and go.”

He didn’t move. His eyes stayed locked on Emery’s face.

“Hey,” Emery said sharply. “Let go. If that money’s not enough, I’ll give you more. Just let go.”

Her knees buckled a little. She staggered.

He caught her again.

But instead of steadying her and letting go, he pulled her closer. His arms went around her.

Then he leaned in and inhaled like he was trying to smell something specific.

Emery’s expression twisted. She pushed at his chest.

“What the hell are you doing?”

Sadly, the man seemed to be so engrossed in his own world and didn’t let her go.

“I’m not mistaken,” he said. “You have my scent on you.”

Emery frowned, and then she shoved him hard. “Back off.” What scent? Is this man high or something?

Nina also grabbed her arm and pulled her a step back.

“You’re insane,” Emery muttered. “We’ve never met before today.”

He stared at her. “You were in that clinic.”

“So were you,” Emery snapped. “That doesn’t mean anything.”

He glanced at her stomach, then back to her face. “What procedure did you have?”

Emery didn’t answer. She just glared at him.

Nina quickly stepped between them. “We’re leaving. Please don’t follow us, or I will call the cops.”

“What procedure did you have?” the man said, ignoring Nina’s threats.

However, she already had no intention of saying another word. With Nina’s help, she walked towards their car, leaving the man standing there alone, on his own.

From inside the car, Emery looked out the window. The man was still standing there, motionless, like he was trying to figure something out. She couldn’t really see his eyes, but she was pretty certain he looked angry, fuming.

Nina glanced at him through the windshield, then started the engine. “Don’t mind him. Just rest. There are a lot of weird people like that.”

Emery didn’t respond right away. She kept watching him. Something about him didn’t sit right. She couldn’t explain it, but it felt off.

Nina pulled out of the parking lot. “Are you really sure you want to stay at my apartment? It’s small.”

“I don’t have a choice,” Emery said. She took out her phone and opened the settings. She found the location-sharing feature and turned it off. Then she opened her notes app and typed a reminder to do the same on her laptop and other devices later.

The drive was quiet after that. It didn’t take long before they reached Nina’s apartment building. It was a secure place in Florida, tucked in a high-end area. Samuel knew where it was, but the security here was tight. They could easily tell the guards to deny him access if it came to that.

Emery stepped out of the car and reached for her bag. Then she paused for a moment. It felt like someone was watching her. She quickly glanced around the parking lot, but quickly realized that no one was there. After a second, she shook her head and followed Nina toward the building.

After everything that happened with Samuel, one thing was clear—she needed therapy. And not later. She needed it now. But first, she needed to rest.

They entered the lobby and crossed to the elevator without speaking. The ride to the sixth floor was quiet as well.

Emery had been there before and was familiar with the place. She liked how the building was sleek and upscale, with polished floors and subtle lighting that gave everything a muted glow. It was the kind of place where rent alone could cover someone else’s mortgage, and Emery knew not many people could afford to live here. It was the perfect place for her to hide until she found a new place for herself.

When they entered the apartment, Nina walked straight to her room and grabbed her keys. “You know where the guest room is. I need to pick up a few things. And some clothes for you.”

Emery immediately reached into her bag and held out her card.

Nina shook her head. “Don’t do that again. I’m just helping.”

Emery exhaled and slid the card back into her wallet. “Fine.” She and Nina had been friends for years, long before money ever mattered. Both came from wealthy families in New York and splitting bills or covering for each other had never been a big deal. It was just how they were.

Once Nina left, Emery walked to the guest room. She opened the small dresser and found a pair of old pajamas she had left there a long time ago. They were wrinkled but clean.

She went to the bathroom, washed up, changed clothes, and dried her hair with a towel she found under the sink. Then she crawled into bed and pulled the blanket over herself.

She didn’t bother checking her phone again. She had already blocked Samuel’s number, but the latter shamelessly used a new number to try and call her. Sadly, she couldn’t just turn her phone off. She closed her eyes. She was too tired.

For now, all she wanted was to sleep. And she did.

A knock pulled Emery from sleep.

She sat up slowly, eyes still adjusting. Her head felt heavy. She grabbed her phone from the nightstand and checked the time. She’d been out for over three hours. She quickly checked her messages and found a message from Nina: \[Running late. Won’t make it for dinner. There’s food in the fridge. Rest. I’ll be back later.\]

Emery sighed and tossed the phone on the bed. Her stomach growled, but she ignored it for now. She stood, brushed her hair back with her fingers, and walked out of the room.

The knock came again.

Without thinking, she reached for the door and opened it.

Her eyes widened the second she saw who was standing on the other side.

Tall. Broad shoulders. The same leather jacket. And those light brown eyes—too gold to be normal, too beautiful to forget.

Her heart skipped a beat.

“You’ve got to be kidding me,” she said.

She tried to shut the door, but he blocked it with one hand.

“We need to talk.”

Emery sighed and leaned her forehead against the edge of the door. Her grip on the knob tightened until her knuckles turned white. “I swear, my luck lately is unbelievable. Look, if you’re not leaving, I’m calling the police.”

He didn’t move. His expression shifted, his jaw tensed, and something flickered behind his eyes like he was choosing his next words carefully. “I think you’re pregnant with my child.”

Emery’s head snapped up. Her eyes locked on his. For a second, she didn’t move, didn’t breathe. Then she started laughing. “That’s it… I’m calling the cops.”

I've been sending hundreds of application since getting my master's in May because I thought it would make it easier to find a job, but no luck.

Also, English isn’t my first language, so please bear with me.

Normally I don’t really believe people can be that busy, so in situations like this I’d usually just move on. But this case feels different, and since I’ve developed a strong crush I’m having a hard time judging the situation rationally. I’d love to hear your thoughts.

TL;DR: Met a guy on a dating app (mid-20s). We’ve had 3 good dates (kissed, deep convos, shared interests). He told me he wants to “take things slow” after rushing into past relationships. We are both looking for long term relationship. Now he has a big graduation exam in 3 weeks and says he might not have time to meet until then. He still texts daily but slowly, and didn’t say yes when I told him we can do a quick call/walk if he needs a break. I like him a lot, but I can’t tell if he’s genuinely just busy and stressed, or politely slow fading. He told me even the smallest things overwhelmed him a lot at this moment. Should I wait and give him space, or move on? I can wait 3 weeks, but I don't want to waste my time if we are not on the same page.

We matched on a dating app, both mid-20s. From the first date I felt almost infatuated, so it’s hard to trust my gut feeling this time (normally I have good intuition about people). We are looking for long term relationship. He told me that in past relationships he tended to jump into long-term things within few weeks, but later realized they weren’t comptible. So after some self-reflection, this time he said he wants to take things slow. I actually agreed, since I’m also the type who usually opens up slowly, especially physically. But because I have this strong crush, my anxiety kicks in—I’m trying hard not to show it, because I don’t want to seem clingy.

So far we’ve met once a week, three dates total. Everything felt like it was going well. We share similar hobbies, values, and music tastes. The conversations flow easily—they’re fun and light, but we can also dive into deeper topics without it being awkward. On the third date he asked if he could kiss me, and we kissed multiple times. He also held my hand first. He’s told me I’m cute, shy, sweet, funny, and that he feels he can learn a lot from me. He even suggested we take a day trip together to a conference he wanted to attend, and asked me about it multiple times lightly on our third date—but I already had plans with a friend, so I had to say no. Still, I felt like things were going really well.

The issue: he has a big graduation-related exam in 3 weeks, and he seems very stressed. I completely understand—when deadlines come up, I also get stressed. Wanting to be supportive, I asked if he wanted to grab a coffee this week, no pressure. He said he wasn’t sure and might not have time until after the deadline. I get it, but I can’t help wondering: if he’s really this busy, why start dating in this period?

I tried to communicate and asked, “are we on the same page to stay connected while you’re busy?” — he said “of course I do! but I really don’t want to make false promises, even the smallest things feel overwhelming right now.”

He admits he’s bad at texting. His replies are really slow, but we’ve still texted daily for a month. The conversations don’t die since we both keep asking questions, but still, just thinking about texting for next 3 weeks straight feels frustrating. I suggested that if he ever wants a short call or a walk to clear his head, I’d be happy—but he didn’t say yes, only replied “that’s so sweet of you, thanks.” That made me anxious again.

So I’m stuck wondering: is he genuinely stressed and needs space, or is he stringing me along while slowly fading out? I can totally wait 3 weeks if it’s just stress, but if he’s not interested and just too nice to reject me, I’d rather know now and move on.

Part of my fear comes from the fact that he seems like a very kind person who might struggle to reject someone directly. And with dating apps, people have endless options—it’s easy to lose interest quickly. I’ve also heard people say that when men say they want to “take things slow,” it usually means they’re not fully sure about the woman. That makes me more insecure.

Deep down, I feel like no matter how busy someone is, people can usually make at least an hour of time. But at the same time, I know I’ve also been in situations where I was so stressed that I disconnected from people and avoided connection altogether—so I can understand it, too.

If this were any other guy, I probably would have moved on, but because I’m infatuated, it feels much harder this time.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did it play out? I don’t really know how to handle this.

1n3roe7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AuDHDWomen/comments/1n3roe7/adhd_paralysis_executive_dysfunction_time/,"ADHD Paralysis, Executive Dysfunction, Time Management, and Autism Transition Struggles","Background: Hi all, I’m a 27 year old school bus driver who was diagnosed ADD as a child back when ADD and ADHD were thought to be the same thing. I’ve since learned that I have inattentive ADHD and while not diagnosed officially, am positive I have autism as well. I was raised in a “mental illness isn’t real” type household with all the stereotypical “just try harder” and “stop being lazy” harmful thought processes, which led to me being who I am- a HEAVILY masked neurodivergent person struggling to take the mask off and still function enough to provide for and take care of myself. I consider myself to be extremely high functioning, but I’m scared I’m going into a severe burnout that could cause me to lose everything- my job (which I love and is the main reason I get out of the house), my friends and family as I tend to push people away when I’m struggling, and all of my stuff and little things I use to keep me afloat (a piece of candy for making it through the grocery store, a meal out when I’ve run out of spoons and even microwaving something is too much, the occasional coffee with friends, etc).  I’ve yet to find a pcp who’s actually helpful with the neurodiverse part of my care though she’s fabulous with everything else. I also have a therapist who’s absolutely wonderful but feels like any sort of official paperwork (like accommodations requests) are outside of her scope of practice and that she can’t do those since she’s not a psychologist.

Problem: I’ve been struggling a ton with getting to work on time especially in the morning and have already received a level 1 (lowest level) write up because of my tardiness. I’ve been trying for months to find a solution to my tardiness and I feel like I’ve exhausted every avenue. I’ve tried an alarm clock in the bathroom attached to my bedroom, app blockers to prevent me from using my phone as a distraction, multiple alarms because I’ve gotten into the habit of just turning it off, and even working with my bosses to try and convince my brain that my clock in is 15 minutes earlier than it actually is. But no matter what I do, I can’t get myself out of my bed to get dressed until my “time to put shoes on” alarm rings. Then I have a hard time getting out of my car and going into the building. Both in my bed and in my car I’m often trapped in the executive dysfunction loop that so many people talk about with the internal monologue of “come on! We need to go! Just get up! Okay on the count of 3…” meanwhile I can’t move even with my mind and alarms screaming at me. I’m at my wit’s end and I think I’ll have another disciplinary meeting soon. RACOM, our Reasonable Accommodations COMmittee in HR, has been less than helpful and keeps trying to deny giving me any sort of accommodation while not suggesting any sort of solutions except for basically “just do your job like everyone else”. My performance in all other areas of my job (driving, interactions with students and parents, paperwork, helping with covering other routes, etc) exceed expectations in my performance reviews. I can only think of 3 coworkers who don’t like me and that’s because 2 of them are homophobic (I’m a lesbian) and the 3rd was doing things she wasn’t supposed to, got caught, and believes I snitched on her when I didn’t. I’m good at my job and I love it. I love interacting with the kids and doing my best to be the safe adult I never had. I just struggle in tardiness and I’m hoping one of you might have an idea or suggestion that would help. I’ve been struggling with tardiness all my life but it’s gotten significantly worse as I’ve gotten older and started to recognize the autism, ADHD, and depression in myself. I hate asking for help and this is a last ditch effort to come up with a solution that will work. I’m in Colorado btw. The last time I asked RACOM to allow me to text my boss to check in and they denied it but didn’t give a reason why. 

What I’m hoping for: advice, solutions, and guidance on what has worked for you in regards to executive dysfunction and running late. Anything for helping to stay functional while unmasking as well as how to unmask would be appreciated as well. If you think I might need legal counsel, please feel free to drop a suggestion for who to contact or what you think I should research. 

Thanks in advance for your time!

I work in a group home. It's a duplex, so technically 2 different homes. I work in side b. 
Occasionally I get asked to cover on side a when there is nobody in side b. Some days I'm just sitting in an empty house for 8 hours for work. 

I get asked to cover a few hours in side a yesterday. No biggie. Get there, make coffee, eat some house food snacks. Yada yada. Side A staff comes up and tells me ""oh yeah, so and so, tested positive for covid the other day"". Lovely. 

Before getting to this shift I also agreed to cover tomorrow for 8 hours. Without the knowledge a client has covid. My wife has a medical issue that's auto immune. We've been through this. Covid, or any bug is terrible and very drawn out for her. She is the breadwinner too and makes far far more than me. 
I tell my boss that I don't feel comfortable doing the shift Saturday due to risk to my wife. I say I'm willing to be a last resort but could they please keep looking for casuals to cover it until Friday night. Now the company has been accommodating before saying I don't have to take clients to this farm for recreation/therapy due to my wife also being allergic to some of those animals. I get no response from my direct boss, but I get a message from his boss. I am basically told there's ppe, there's nobody in your side so you're available, we aren't going to do call outs to casuals for the Saturday shift. Your doing it. 

All I wanted was the possibility of not being exposed to that for an entire shift to a client that needs personal care. 

Anyway I'm calling on sick tomorrow morning. I have covid now too unfortunately, like the staff that's off I was supposed to be covering for.
 Shame.

I (35F) and a SAHM have been married to my husband (37M) for 6 years and together for 12. This past year has been immensely difficult. He was diagnosed with bipolar 1 and went manic with a brief psychotic episode after our second baby arrived.  The last 9 months have been him trying to navigating this diagnosis, going on and off his meds and self medicating with weed and alcohol and basically making it my problem to fix him. The meds have made him tired, muted and very depressed. The complete opposite of what I fell I love with in. What triggered the mania was purchasing a property for us to live and run his business from. We had a hard time securing financing and he just went crazy getting it done. 

Fast forward to now, he’s been enlisting one of his employees to build stuff around the property. This guy has been around for most of the time we’ve been living in this new house. He was a contractor before, so my husband has been capitalizing on this. He’s built us a deck, redid our floors, built a bedroom in the basement. It’s insane. 

 In the beginning he would always laugh at the stuff I would say. But it was just friendly. Now it feels electric. He’s older than all the regular employees. 3 years younger than me, but still the majority of his labourers are aged 19-30.  We’ve spent a lot more time around each other, so there’s been more signs: 

1. prolonged eye contact (and now more recently with a sly smile every time) 
2. Noticing me from across the property and making an accuse to walk over (usually because of the dogs or a task)
3. Standing close to me 
4. Repeating funny things I’ve said
5. I got dressed up for an event and when he saw me, he stopped dead in his tracks
6. I sometimes make coffee runs for the senior staff. I’ve gotten him a coffee a couple times. I mentioned a couple days ago I was going for one and asked if he wanted anything and he replied with “I would love one. I think you know what I want” and then smiled. 

I feel very drawn to him. Thinking about him a lot. Looking for him. I swear I saw a twinkle in his eye when we smiled at each other yesterday. I think what I also find interesting is his love for my dogs and how friendly he is towards my kids. 

I’ve been so frustrated with my home life. I told my husband that this is the first time I have ever thought about having an affair because of how unhappy I am. He was hurt. But he knew why. He knows he hasn’t been his best self. 

I know it is highly inappropriate,  but it’s also so exciting! To be seen and teased and smiled at. I thought this winter would be good to help put some distance between this. The staff are usually laid off from Dec to Mar, but my husband informed me this guy has a list of stuff to do around the property this winter.

Since our eighth grade in middle school, I was always by his side. I shaped myself into the perfect woman for him.

I kept my black curls cut short, just the way he liked. I never wore makeup. I dressed in outfits he approved of because he didn’t like when other men looked at me.

For ten years, I did everything he wanted. I was going to be his wife. Everyone knew we were meant to be.

So it made no sense when, six months ago, he threw it all away.

“What did you say?” My voice was barely above a whisper.

Zane stared at me across the restaurant table, his expression unreadable. I had made this reservation months ago for our ten-year anniversary.

“I think we should break up,” he said.

I blinked. My heart pounded in my chest. “Zane, is this supposed to be a joke? Because it’s not funny, babe.”

“I’m not joking, Emilia.”

“No, you have to be joking!” My voice rose slightly, and I glanced around. People were staring. I took a deep breath and reached for his hands across the table. My engagement ring still sat on my finger. I had never wanted to take it off. Not even now.

“We just started planning the wedding,” I said, keeping my voice steady. “I know it’s stressful, but that’s why I’ve been doing most of the work.”

He didn’t respond.

“If it’s too much, we can push it back,” I added, even though the words felt like poison. We had already delayed it for years. But if that’s what it took to keep us together, I would do it in a heartbeat. “I don’t want you to feel pressured.”

Zane exhaled sharply. “Then you don’t want me to marry you? Because that’s something I don’t want to do, Emilia.”

His words hit like a slap. My chest tightened. “You don’t mean that.”

“But I do.” His voice was firm. Cold. Nothing like the man I fell in love with. “I don’t love you anymore. I haven’t for years.”

I stopped breathing.

“I stayed because I know how much I owe you,” he admitted. “But I can’t put you over my happiness anymore.”

“Relationships go through tough times. We just have to work—”

Zane pulled his hand from mine and ran it through his hair. He had always been handsome. He had light brown hair, golden-brown eyes, and a smile that could make anyone melt. I knew I was lucky to have him.

He could have had any girl.

But he chose me.

That had to mean something. People don’t just throw ten years away.

But he wasn’t smiling at me now. He was scowling. He stood, dusting his hand on his thigh like my touch was something dirty.

“I don’t want to work on anything. Not with you.” His voice was flat. “It’s been ten years, Emmy. If we were meant to be, wouldn’t we have gotten married by now?”

The nickname stung. I stared down at my plate. “The only reason we’re not married yet is because you had to focus on your career—”

“No.” His tone was sharp. “It’s because I never saw you as someone I could marry.”

The words hit like a punch to the stomach.

“You might be someone’s cup of tea, but not mine, Emilia. And besides, most NHL athletes don’t get married. But you wouldn’t understand that.”

I did understand. I didn’t want to go my whole life without being someone’s wife. But for him, I would have tried.

“Don’t cause a scene, Zane. There might be reporters here.”

He chuckled. “You’ve always been a pushover, haven’t you?” He leaned in slightly. “But I did love you when we were younger. Because of that, you can keep the engagement ring. I don’t want it back.”

He turned to leave, then glanced over his shoulder. “Oh, and we can’t live together anymore. You get that, right? I’m a free man now. I should be able to bring my hookups to my own fucking 

house.”

He smirked. “Leave the key in the flower pot.”

Then he walked away.

And just like that, he took my life with him.

# 2

It’s been six months since Zane left me.

At first, I didn’t take it well. He kicked me out, and I had nowhere to go until Tessa, my best friend, booked me the first flight to NYC and forced me to stay with her.

I spent nights crashing on her couch, crying in the bathroom when she was at work.

I ignored the little bakery — Tessa and I named it The Whimsy Bakehouse after getting smashingly drunk one night in college and having what she called a crazy epiphany — Zane had opened for me after he got his first NHL paycheck for weeks. I couldn’t bring myself to step inside.

Then Tessa got fed up. She called me a couch potato, said I was wasting my tears on an ‘asshole jerk,’ and dragged me back to work.

Unlearning ten years of habits hasn’t been easy.

Some nights, I still catch myself staring at my phone, waiting for a message that will never come. Waiting for Zane to say he made a mistake. That he wants me back.

But he never does. Not even in my dreams.

It’s Friday and I’m at the bakery. The regular season is about to start. I know because I memorised Zane’s schedule months ago. Back then, I planned my days around his, making sure we had time together.

Now, the only reason I keep up with hockey is Tessa. She’s been extra busy lately.

She’s a PR manager for the New York Titans. It was Zane’s favourite team. He had always dreamed of being drafted there. Instead, he ended up with the Chicago Blizzards.

That was a rough time for us. He was so angry about it, and I was the one he took it out on. It took everything I had to keep our relationship from falling apart.

I push the memory away and pull the second batch of cookies from the oven. Just as I set them down, the bell above the door jingles, making me smile.

The Becketts live across the street. They stop by every morning for cookies, and I always make sure to have something extra for them.

“Good morning, Miss Carter!” Angel, their little girl, grins up at me, two front teeth missing. She holds her father’s hand, swinging it back and forth.

My heart melts. “Good morning, Angel. Mr Beckett. Just the two of you today?”

Mr Beckett nods, smiling. “My wife gave birth yesterday. We’re here to pick up some treats for her. She specifically asked for your doughnuts.”

Mrs. Beckett had been pregnant forever, or at least, that’s how it felt. In reality, she had been pregnant for about twelve months now.

She used to sit in my bakery, watching me bake, complaining about how heavy and tired she was. All she wanted was a healthy, happy baby. The doctors said the long pregnancy was unusual but nothing to worry about.

Hearing the news now, I couldn’t contain my excitement. I let out a squeal, and Angel giggled.

“Congratulations! I’m so happy for you!” I beamed. “I’ll grab the doughnuts right away. I also made some cupcakes! It’s almost like I knew something good was coming!”

Angel nodded enthusiastically. “I have a little brother now! He’s really red and not very pretty, but Mummy says all babies look like that.”

“That’s not a very nice thing to say, Angel,” Mr. Beckett scolds gently as I quickly pack up the cupcakes, doughnuts, and a few fresh cookies for Mrs. Beckett.

“But it’s true!” Angel pouts, crossing her arms. She turns to me for backup. “Miss Carter, tell Daddy it’s true!”

I hand the treats to Mr. Beckett, then place a hand on my hip as I ruffle Angel’s hair. “I agree with your dad. He might be a little red, but he’s still your brother. And as his big sister, it’s your job now to protect him. Especially from people who talk about how red he is.”

Angel lets out an exaggerated huff. “That’s going to be so hard.”

Mr. Beckett chuckles. “Welcome to being a big sister.”

I smile, watching the two of them. Moments like these remind me that not all relationships fall apart. Some families actually stay happy.

But for some reason, none of my relationships ever last. No matter how much I give, it’s never enough.

I wave at the Becketts as they leave, their happiness lingering in the air like the scent of freshly baked cookies. I wanted what they had, a family that cared for each other.

But after what I did seven years ago, I knew I didn’t have a family to go back to. My parents haven’t called in months. My sister barely acknowledges my existence.

It used to hurt less when I told myself I deserved it. That this was just the price of my mistakes. And no matter how much I lost, I thought I’d always have Zane.

But I even failed at that.

I was pathetic. I couldn’t even be the kind of woman Zane wanted to marry. Everything I touched fell apart, and there was nothing I could do to stop it.

My phone rings, and a quick glance at the screen tells me it’s Tess. The tight feeling in my chest eases the moment I hear her voice.

“You’re not on my couch, are you?” she asks, her tone is so skeptical that I burst out laughing.

“No, Tess. I’m at the bakery. I even made you some cookies.”

Right then, the bell above the door jingles, and in walks Tessa, holding up her phone with a triumphant grin. “Well, thank God for small mercies.”

Tessa and I have been best friends since our freshman year of college.

It was a rough time for me, I had followed Zane to college in New York because he asked me to, but I struggled to fit in.

He never liked when I had too many friends, so I wasn’t used to having someone that wasn’t him to lean on. Then I met Tess in an art history class.

She couldn’t stand Zane, and I used to hate that about her. But for some reason, she stuck around anyway.

She’s drop dead gorgeous with platinum blonde hair, forest green eyes, and long legs that make heads turn. She’s the exact opposite of me in every way.

Her skin is freakishly pale, mine is warm brown. Her hair is pin-straight, mine is a mess of curls. She has curves in all the right places, while I’ve always been insecure about my nonexistent ones. Her eyes are striking, while mine are just… brown.

Compared to her, I’m a plain Jane.

And not just in looks, but in personality too. When she told Zane she was going to be a PR manager for a hockey club, he laughed in her face and said she was wasting her time.

Now she’s doing exactly what she loves, while I’m still stuck wondering what direction my life is going.

Before Zane and I started dating, I dreamed of owning an art gallery, but he thought that wasn’t good enough.

I love baking and this bakery, but sometimes

 I can’t help but feel like he only bought it for me to make sure I did exactly what he wanted.

Tess walks up, wraps her arms around me, and showers me with kisses, making me giggle. She’s always been so affectionate. It’s endearing.

Then I feel her slump against my back with a sigh. “You’ll never believe what happened.”

# 3

I hum softly, a small smile tugging at my lips. “Hello to you too. You can sit down while I make the coffee. A flat white with cinnamon on top, right?”

She grins. “I love you, you know me so well.” She groans and slumps into a chair, resting her arm on the table and propping her head up with her hand.

I start making our coffees but glance at the clock with a frown. “It’s just 10 AM, Tess. What are you doing here? Shouldn’t you be at work?”

She sighs loudly. “Yes, I should. But I’m burnt out. Had to get off early.”

I raise an eyebrow as I begin kneading dough. Rush hour hits by noon, and I need to work quickly. “Work emergency?”

“When is it ever anything else? It’s not even counted as an emergency today. Usually, the whole team gives me problems, but this time, it’s just one person!”

Here we go again.

“His name’s... Leon, right?” I ask, trying to remember.

She raises an eyebrow at me. “Good try, but you should know better. I’ve complained about him so much, he should be a household name by now. It’s Liam Calloway. We went to college together. Remember?”

That was new. “We did?”

“Of course, we did. He was a year ahead of us. Played on the hockey team with Zane. Good Lord, Zane was soo obsessed with him. He even wanted to get drafted by the NYC Titans just because Liam did. Remember?”

Was that why Zane wanted to be chosen by NYC so badly? I rummage through my memories. I remember Zane driving me to his hockey game one day, when he didn’t want Tess to drive me, so Tess was forced to tag along with us. I think he mentioned a Liam then.

He did seem a bit obsessed.

I shake my head, and she lets out a huge sigh. “Don’t worry about it, that asshole’s obsession wasn’t the issue anyway.” She frowns, thinking. “What was the issue again?”

“Work emergency.”

“Right! That!” She huffs and starts getting worked up again. I wash my hands, grab our coffees, and put the cookies on a large plate. I walk over and hand her coffee before sitting down across from her. “He’s an insufferable playboy!”

I tilt my head, confused. “And... is that a problem?”

“Ordinarily, no. It’s not the team’s concern. But he’s been way over the top lately. He’s the biggest name in hockey right now, and with the regular season coming up, he should be polishing his image, not ruining it!”

I shrug, not really getting it. I blow at my steaming coffee and take a sip. “But you guys should get along, right? You knew each other in college.”

She looks at me like I’m clueless. “This isn’t about his personality. If it was, it wouldn’t be a problem because he’s charming and nice. But his endorsement contracts have a morality clause. He has to stay in good standing, or he loses them. Even the club contract has the same condition. If he keeps this up, he’ll lose his job.”

“It can’t be that bad.”

“It is! Even his management’s on his ass. I know he might be going through something, but this isn’t it. You know Jessica Monroe? From Confidential Family?”

At the mention of my and Tess’s favorite show, I perk up. “Who doesn’t?”

“Exactly!” She looks furious when she adds, “They’re supposed to be dating and in a happy relationship, but last night, pictures came out of him on a date with her co-star.”

My jaw drops. “He cheated on THE Jessica Monroe?”

Tess grabs a cookie and chews it angrily. “I don’t know. I was too busy being pissed off that he was dumb enough to get photographed at such a crucial time. I didn’t even think to ask. Everyone knows Jessica Monroe! Confidential Family is the most-watched show right now. Her fans are going crazy, flaming him on social media.”

“Well, he deserves it. She’s way too hot for him anyway.” I’ve never seen the guy, but Jessica’s basically a goddess. “What a scumbag.”

“I mean, they did look really good together. Two ridiculously hot people deserve each other, I guess. And he’s not really a scumbag. He’s probably the best guy I know,” she says, grinning sheepishly. “After you, of course. Liam’s just going through something, not sure what, but I just hope he handles it more quietly.”

I nod. “So, what’s the plan?”

“Emergency PR, for now. I’m pretty sure he and her co-star weren’t actually on a date. Hell, I’m not even sure he and Jessica were really dating. It’s just what everyone assumed. He has commitment issues. We’ll let it blow over, Jess will probably get asked about it during her press tour and clear it up. After that, we’ll go with the serious relationship angle. Have him fake date someone less famous, and when they break up, he’ll be the heartbroken playboy and a media darling again.” 

I can’t help but smile. Of course, she’s already thought everything through. Whenever Zane ranted, it was for advice he was never going to take. But when Tessa rants, it’s because she already knows exactly what to do, she just needs someone to listen.

I cringe slightly. I should stop thinking about him. It’s been months. He probably hasn’t thought about me once.

I’d already spent six months mourning him. It was time to let go. It wouldn’t be easy, nothing ever was, but I had to try.

“Earth to Emmy!” Tessa sing-songs. She’s smiling, but I see the concern in her eyes. “I lost you for a second there. You okay?”

I’d been so distracted I didn’t even notice she’d finished eating.

I smile and reach for her hand. For a split second, I’m terrified she’ll pull away and wipe it on her suit pants just like Zane did.

Like I was something dirty. Something disgusting.

But she doesn’t. Instead, she squeezes my hand, erasing the bitter memory he left behind. “A penny for your thoughts?”

I shake my head, hating the way my eyes sting. “Just thinking... it’s time. I need to move on. Once and for all.”

The tears come anyway. Tessa’s eyes are 

suspiciously wet when she pulls me into a hug. “Oh my God, Em. I’m so proud of you.”

I’m moving on. I’m finally leaving my asshole ex behind.

Or at least, that was the plan.

A month later, I get a message from Zane.

It’s an invitation to his wedding.

# 4

When I first moved into Tessa’s apartment, two thoughts hit me.

One: Tessa was just as high maintenance as she’d been in college. Everything in her place screamed luxury. High-end furniture, designer décor, the kind of perfectly curated space that made you wonder if people actually lived there. I was happy she had a job that let her maintain the lifestyle.

Two: Tessa’s apartment was the most comfortable place in the world to feel like shit.

Even though she had decorated a guest room just for me, I spent most of my worst nights on her couch, wrapped in an overpriced throw blanket, drinking wine straight from the bottle.

And now, as I stare at the notification on my phone, I know exactly what I need to do.

I walk into Tessa’s kitchen, grab a bottle of red wine, some expensive brand I don’t recognize, and collapse onto her couch. Popping the cork, I take a long gulp before daring to look at my phone again.

For months, I wanted this. I prayed for him to reach out. Now, it’s the last thing I need.

Calm down, Emilia. It’s probably just closure or whatever.

It’s not like one message could change anything.

I tap the notification. My stomach twists as I realize I never changed how I saved his name.

Babe 

Babe 

Babe 

Babe 

Babe 

I stare at the screen, heart pounding.

Zane is getting MARRIED?!

I throw back wine at a pace that makes me dizzy.

A month-long cruise? A couples-only cruise?

I take another large gulp of wine.

Of all the ways and reasons I imagined Zane reaching out to me, this was never one of them.

I'm halfway through the bottle when the tears finally come.

Ten years.

We were together for a whole decade. And in all that time, I was never enough for him. Never someone he saw as worth marrying.

But in just seven months, he’s found his bride. Someone he adores.

Someone he’s happily planning a wedding with, when I had to beg just for him to be present for ours.

Holding a month-long cruise to celebrate their love before they even get married.

I never asked for anything that extravagant. I just wanted his attention. His love.

We started dating when we were fourteen. Every adult around us said it wouldn’t last, that we were too young to know anything about love. The only person who believed in us was my brother.

Even thinking about him makes me cry even harder, so I shove the thought away. One day, I’ll have to unpack that can of worms, I’d been holding it off for seven years now, but today isn’t that day.

Zane and I beat the odds. We went through high school together, then college. His teammates used to call me Mrs. Whitmoore.

Everyone around could see we were set to play the long game. Everyone but Zane, the person who was supposed to be playing on my side of the field.

The only person I truly cared about.

I never even used to care about changing my last name or wearing his ring on my finger, I just wanted to be his. Forever.

Tess once said the only reason I wanted to marry him so badly was because everyone else expected it.

Maybe she was right.

Tess is always right.

That thought hits me just as I realise I’m wasted. The wine bottle is nowhere to be found, and in my attempt to locate it, I end up rolling off the couch and onto the floor.

Groaning, I fumble for my phone, my hands are clumsy and shaking. Tessa. She’ll know what to do. She always does.

The call barely rings before she picks up, her voice is warm and steady, like a lifeline. “Hey, honeycomb. Isn’t it a little early for a wellness check?”

“Zane is getting married.” My voice comes out in a pathetic slurp as I try to peel myself off the floor.

I blink blearily around the room. Where the hell did the couch go?

I’m still searching for the couch when—

BAM!

I slam my toe against Tessa’s coffee table.

“Shit!” I curse loudly, clutching my foot like it might fall off. The pain is sharp, but my drunken brain registers it a second too late.

In my attempt to regain balance, I miscalculate completely and fall backward—

Right onto the couch I’d been looking for.

I glare at it suspiciously. I swear it wasn’t there a second ago.

I’ll have to tell Tess her couch disappears from time to time.

“What?!” Tess practically shouts into the phone. I hear muffled voices in the background before she lowers her voice. “I’m sorry, I’m at work, but did I hear you correctly?”

“You did!” I announce dramatically. “He sent me an invitation to his wedding. And a month long couple-only cruise before the wedding, Tess! Since I clearly can’t move on, you’ll have to be my plus one.”

I cackle like a lunatic then stop abruptly.

Wait. What was I laughing at?

“Tess?” I squint at the phone. “You still there?”

Her voice softens in a way that makes my stomach twist. “Yeah, I’m still he

re. Just… stay put, okay? I’ll be back from work before you know it. And stop drinking my wine, honeycomb, that shit’s expensive.”

She pauses. Long enough that I can hear the weight in her silence.

“And, Em… I think I have something important to tell you.”

Then the call ends.

# 5

A few hours pass, but Tess is still not back.

I wonder what she wants to tell me that’s so important.

Once I sober up, I take a shower, brush my teeth, and keep myself busy by cleaning her apartment.

I try not to think about Zane, but I can’t help it. I open the email again, staring at the invitation to his wedding and the couple-only cruise.

Then I see my name in the wrong spot.

My stomach turns, and I barely make it to the bathroom before throwing up.

Later, I do something even worse.

I Google her.

His fiancée is a model. Perfect. Beautiful. Everything I’m not.

Of course, he left me for someone like her.

I’m chugging water, actually following Tess’s advice for once, when she finally walks in.

Her nose scrunches as she looks around, but when her eyes land on me, she just sighs and gives a small, sad smile.

“I thought you’d be in worse shape,” she says, settling onto the couch beside me.

I lean my head on her shoulder and hold up the water bottle. “If I didn’t pull myself together, you would’ve done it for me. I’ve learned to pick my battles.”

“Damn straight.” She tugs at my hair lightly. “Wanna go out for dinner? There’s a new Thai place near my office. It’s supposed to have really good food.”

I squint at her. “You hate Thai food. What’s going on?”

She laughs, and for a second, I forget how miserable I feel. She’s beautiful and effortlessly so. If I looked more like her, or like his new fiancée, maybe Zane would still be mine.

Tess sobers up quickly. “Okay, you got me. I just… I didn’t know how to say this.” She hesitates, then looks me in the eye. “Zane’s an asshole, Em. He never deserved you.”

I let out a bitter laugh. “You’ve said that before.”

“And I meant it. Do you remember when he got drafted and basically bullied you into moving to Chicago with him?”

I shake my head. “That’s not what happened.”

“But it is,” she insists. “He only got you that bakery because he thought he’d be drafted to New York. Remember our plan? If he didn’t, we were gonna split an apartment here. And when you told him you were staying with me, he threw a fit.”

I roll my eyes. “He wasn’t throwing a fit. He was hurt.”

Tess scoffs. “Yeah? So he had to hurt you too? Em, you didn’t even want to move. He kept you locked up in his apartment so he could keep an eye on you. I saw you twice a year, and that’s only when Chicago played New York.”

“That’s not his fault. I didn’t want to leave. I didn’t want a job. I was okay relying on him—”

“And never seeing me? You were okay with that too?” Her voice cracks, but she masks it quickly.

I open my mouth to say something, anything at all, but she cuts me off.

“That’s not the point. The point is that I went from barely seeing you to having you around every day. When I said you could stay as long as you want, I meant it, Em. I like having you here.”

Her words hit me harder than I expect. When was the last time someone actually said they wanted me around?

Zane never did. He tolerated me, sure. But he never wanted me.

Tess takes my hands, squeezing them gently. “I’m kinda warming you up for something that’s gonna piss you off.”

“Wha—”

“I knew Zane was getting married.” She blurts it out fast, like ripping off a bandage. “I found out a month ago. It’s literally my job to know this stuff. But you were already spiraling, and I knew if you found out, you’d do something so fucking stupid like beg for him back.”

I go stiff. She knew.

She’s right, of course. But if she had told me, I could’ve stopped it. I could’ve made him come back to me.

This is her fault.

“That wasn’t your choice to make.” My voice shakes with anger.

She nods. “You’re right. It wasn’t. And I’m sorry, Em. But you have to understand that if he left and moved on that fast, he was never coming back.”

“You don’t know that!” I yank at my hands, but she doesn’t let go. “Let go, Tessa.”

She shakes her head. “No. Because that’s not even the thing that’s gonna make you mad.”

I stop struggling.

There’s more?

“What the hell, Tessa?”

She ignores my glare and keeps going. “He’s not coming back, Emilia. You haven’t seen their pictures together or heard how he talks about her in interviews.”

I thought the worst pain I’d ever feel was when Zane left me. I was so wrong.

Because this? This feels like my heart is caving in.

But I don’t cry. I can’t.

“Why are you telling me this, Tess?” My voice is barely a whisper. My head drops. I can’t even look at her. I’m too ashamed.

She squeezes my hands. “Because you are worth so much more than that asshole you’ve been shackled to for ten years. And if you don’t believe it, then believe this: I will never, ever lie to you, Emilia. Even if I hide the truth sometimes for your sake.”

She exhales sharply. “Remember when I told you about my PR strategy for that idiot player at my club?”

I nod slowly. I remember. I just don’t know why she’s bringing it up now.

“It’s been going great. His image is on the rise, but we need to keep it going. You know how I said he should date a pretty girl, make him look like a future family man?”

I don’t nod this time. I hate where this is goi

ng.

Tessa hesitates, then grins way too cheerfully. “On a scale of one to Hades’s asshole, how mad would you be if I said I recommended you for the job?”

# 6

On good days, I love my best friend. On really bad days, I remind myself she means well.

But today? Today is a horrible day, and I'm furious.

""Hades's asshole"" isn't even a high enough scale. I yank my hands out of hers, my anger so hot I actually consider shoving her off the couch - until I notice how close the coffee table is and wince.

I'm mad. But not mad enough to injure her. Yet.

""I can't believe you!"" I shoot up from the couch and storm toward my bedroom. Tessa is right behind me.

""You're overreacting, Em. It's not even a bad thing!""

I whip off my left slipper and hurl it at her head, but she's got baseball reflexes from years of playing catch with her dad - and dodges effortlessly.

She glares, pointing a finger at me like she's about to scold a misbehaving puppy. ""Give me one valid reason why you're mad, and I'll back off.""

I hate when she does this. Puts me on the spot, makes my brain short-circuit, then steamrolls me into agreeing with her. ""I just broke up with Zane!""

""Access denied."" She starts ticking off her fingers. ""One, he's a fucker. Two, you're supposed to be moving on. Three, he's getting married and literally invited you to his wedding. On a goddamn cruise.""

She crosses her arms, staring at me like I'm the one making decisions for her. ""Emilia Janice Carter. You can't be serious.""

I launch my second slipper at her, and this time, it lands - right on her shoulder.

""You do not call me that!"" I fume. ""And it's the principle of the thing! You're always going on about how controlling Zane is, but you're just as bad! You should have told me he was engaged. It wasn't your place to keep it from me, and you should've asked before signing me up for anything!""

""Don't you dare guilt-trip me."" She's fuming now too. ""I didn't sign you up for shit, I suggested something. And do not compare me to that good-for-nothing lowlife.""

She takes a breath, then pins me with a look so serious I can't look away. ""Pray tell, what's your plan? He's hosting a month-long wedding cruise. I know you. You'll never reject the invite. You'll go, torture yourself, then come home and expect me to pick up the pieces.""

I press my lips together. I have nothing to say.

She exhales, like she knew she'd win this argument. ""I'm not going with you. But if you agree to my idea - because I'd never force you into anything - then not only will you have a date the entire trip, but you'll get to rub it in his smug, asshole of a face.""

She leans in, eyes gleaming. ""Just imagine it, Em. His ex-fiancée... dating his favourite hockey player.""

I didn't need to be a PR manager -or a mind reader - to know how this looked.

Zane was obsessed with Liam Calloway. That much, I remember. Back in college, he once refused to let me sit in the front seat of his car because Liam had been there a few hours ago, and he didn't want me ""messing up his good luck charm.""

I thought he was joking and got in anyway. We had a massive fight. Then his team lost the game, and he lost it on me, yelling about how he ""couldn't have a girl that couldn't fucking listen.""

The memory makes my mouth taste bitter. I remember crying to Tess, wondering why he didn't just date Liam if he meant so much to him.

Tess watches me closely, still grinning mischievously, but I can tell she's still really pissed. Just barely keeping it together. Then, without another word, she turns and heads to her room. Probably to cool off, and it's probably for the best, too. If she stayed, we'd just start fighting again.

She pauses in the doorway. ""Think about it all you want, but I'm having dinner with Liam tonight. It's at that Thai place I mentioned."" She glances at me. ""Not pressuring you or anything, but if you're okay with it, this could be your first official date in the public eye. I can tell Liam to ditch the sunglasses and facemask. Dress up. But only if it's what you want, 'kay?""

Her eyes soften, like she sees something in my face I don't even realise I'm showing. ""I love you, Emilia. Even if it doesn't feel like it sometimes.""

Then she disappears into her room, shutting the door softly behind her.

And finally, for the first time today, I can breathe.

\_\_\_\_

I've never been good at makeup. I pull up a YouTube tutorial on mascara and nearly melt into my bed.

I can count on one of Tessa's perfectly manicured hands the number of times I've worn it at all - and only on secret outings with her, ones Zane never knew about. She'd sit me down, tilt my chin up, and ""pretty me up,"" as she called it. I know I could knock on her door right now, ask for help, and erase all the tension between us. But I don't want to. Not yet.

Zane hated when I wore makeup. Sometimes, he'd yell just for finding a tube of lip gloss in my purse.

I shake my head. That's a pathetic excuse for not even knowing how to put on mascara. I remember the look Tess gave me the first time I told her I avoided it because of him.

Now, I'm sitting on my bed, wearing the prettiest dress I own, it's a gorgeous white one Tess bought me for my birthday last year. I add hoop earrings, then gather my curls into a simple ponytail. They shrink easily anyway, so there's no point in letting them down.

The YouTube video was easier to follow than I expected. Turns out, I already had most of the products, thanks to Tess. And when I look in the mirror, I think I did a pretty decent job.

Then, a thought creeps in. Was it worth it? All those years pretending I didn't like makeup. Pretending I didn't want to look as beautiful as the girls on social media.

I guess Zane leaving me has some perks. Now, I can do things like this without worrying if he approves.

I grab a black purse and steal one last glance at myself in the mirror. My breath catches.

I look... pretty.

My eyes burn with unshed tears.

When was the last time I liked the way I looked?

When was the last time I was allowed to care?

I open my door.

Tessa is standing outside, her hand frozen mid-air, about to knock. She 

sees me and stops, lips parting slightly, but she says nothing.

So I speak instead.

""I'm ready."" I lift my chin. ""I'll make that asshole regret wasting ten years of my life.""

Tessa gives me the biggest, shit eating grin ever.

# 7

The restaurant is smaller and more intimate than I expected. We've only just arrived, but Tess quickly waves away the waiter, telling her we're still waiting for more people.

 I try not to think about the last time I was at a restaurant - seven months ago. The most embarrassing, heartbreaking day of my life. Every time Tess tried to take me out after that, I shut her down immediately. She must've been suspicious, but she never pushed. That meant more than she probably realized.

 ""You could at least try not to look like you're about to shit yourself,"" Tess mutters before taking a sip of water.

 She looks stunning, as always. My stomach twists the way it always does around her - envy curling tight in my gut - but I push it away.

 ""It's really just Liam,"" she says, her voice casual. ""Like, of all people, he's the last one you should be nervous about. You should be more worried about him trying to get into your pants.""

 I snort, but the joke doesn't land right.

 Because now my stomach is twisting for a different reason.

 It's stupid. But maybe Zane's sudden marriage messed with my head, because the words slip out before I can stop them. ""Should I be worried about him doing that with others as well?"" Or you?

 Like a hound on a scent, or maybe just someone who knows me more than I know myself, she hears the question I don't ask.

 Tess stares at me for a second-then bursts out laughing.

 She laughs and laughs and laughs until she's coughing, and I have to pat her back. When she finally stops, she takes one look at my face and apologizes, but the damage is done.

 My cheeks burn with humiliation.

 My God.

 I can't believe I've turned into this-this insecure mess.

 Insecure about my own best friend.

 What the hell, Emilia?

 Her eyes are still bright with laughter as she pats my shoulder. ""I said he was hot, babe. Not that I'd touch that with a ten-foot pole. He's all yours. Really.""

 I groan and bury my face in my hands. She laughs again, but this time, there's something softer about it.

 I can't believe myself. All this over a guy I haven't even met? I usually keep the jealous, insecure part of me locked away, especially around Tess. She's always been the effortlessly perfect one, and I've always been... well, me. But lately, everything feels too much. Maybe I've been too sensitive.

 Still. Damn, Emilia.

 When I finally work up the courage to look at her again, she gives me a serious look.

 ""I'm sorry,"" I mumble. And I mean it.

 But she just shrugs. ""You don't need to apologise for anything.""

 Then her phone buzzes. She glances at the screen, and her grin spreads wide.

 ""They're here!""

 They?

 The restaurant door swings open, and I know - somehow, I just know - it's him.

 Liam walks in like he owns the place. Not in an arrogant way, just... like he belongs everywhere. 

 Tall, broad-shouldered, and golden in that effortlessly charming, boy-next-door way. His blond hair is slightly tousled, like he just ran a hand through it before stepping inside, and when his light blue eyes land on me, his smile flickers - just for a second - revealing a pair of dimples that makes my heart skip a beat, before settling into something warm.

 He's hot. He's really, really hot. And not in an arrogant or pretentious way like Zane, but more like a golden boy with all the charisma in the world at his finger tips.

 His charm is obvious, making it difficult to look away from him. Or maybe it's just the way he carries himself.

 Huh, I thought Tess was fucking with me when she said we went to college together. His aura is so blinding and familiar, I know she was telling the truth.

 ""Hey,"" he says, sliding into the seat across from me like we've done this a hundred times before. ""Emilia, right?""

1n3rk88,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1n3rk88/i_want_to_die/,I want to die,"I’ve thought about jumping off the bridge a lot lately. This past week, someone I work with was fired for performance issues and because we worked on a project together that the ball was dropped on, I’m convinced I’m next in line. It’s exhausting to live in this mindset. I constantly think I’m going to get fired and if I do, I’ll never find another job and be financially ruined.

I moved in with my boyfriend too soon I think (a little over 1.5 years) and I’m realizing he’s a bit of a deadbeat. Plays video games all day and content with his mediocre job that doesn’t pay enough because he doesn’t have to work a lot. With his free time, he still doesn’t help with house chores and the space is always a mess. I’m constantly frustrated with him and being a bad partner because I just can’t stand sharing space with a lazy person. I had no idea how little he does from day to day because we both work from home and never coworked a full day together. I ask him to do things and he just doesn’t because he knows there are no consequences. Like today, our internet was on the fritz and he gets better service in his office. I asked him to contact the internet to troubleshoot because the account the password are in his name. He didn’t do jack shit because he couldn’t turn off the game to reset the modem for 10 minutes. It’s been bad for over a week and I’ve been asking him to help and he’s done nothing because it doesn’t affect him, in “his office” where the router is. When we moved in, we agreed he could have the office for external calls but he’s just in there playing games all. The. Time. And the “flex” office or switching rooms just doesn’t work for me because it’s always so filthy. Dirty clothes on the ground, dust all over his desk and monitors, and like 10 packs of zyns and sometimes he leaves used zyns in places and it’s so gross. I’ve found them washing coffee cups, his pants, wiping down the desk. I’ve also asked him to quit because I think it’s a vile habit and he never takes me seriously. He just says shit like “Tucker Carlson says they’re good for you” (joking obviously but making a joke about me approaching the topic seriously and saying it’s gross and bad for his oral health).

And then I doubt how angry I am with him all the time and how thin my patience is because my mental health is so bad and I’m generally anxious and short tempered every day. 

I’ve chosen to deal with my mental health privately because it got messy the last time I told friends, and I’ve now had 2 friends confront me about being a shit, absent friend lately and 2 others just drop me entirely and start excluding me.

I’m absolutely exhausted trying to keep up with my life falling apart to the point where I know this post isn’t even coherent. 

I am an absolute failure in life. Mediocre salary at 30, probably going to get fired, will never own a home or achieve any financial goals, I have no friends and a bad partner. On top of all that, I’ve let myself go and am an ugly waste of space. Dying would be such a relief. I fantasize about jumping off the bridge but I’m too much of a coward so I just self harm.

I’m 22 now and still dealing with the damage — anyone else?,"Hi, my name is Daniel, I’m from Colombia and I’m 22 years old. I carry a heavy burden on my shoulders and I’d like to hear from people who (sadly) have experience with this.

So, my father is 67, my mother is also in her 60s. My father had a father who beat him physically to inhuman levels, with a belt — you know, swollen skin, etc. He ended up becoming a drug addict, dropped out of school, later homeless, and when he was about to kill himself, he found a Christian foundation. He rehabilitated, and a couple of years later he met my mother, who was giving charity with Christian groups in prisons and places like that. My mother was the youngest in a family of 5 kids, 3 boys and a sister. Her sister had mental health problems, mistreated her all her childhood, and they told her she had to endure it because “she’s sick.” My mom’s mother was very sexist, she only cared about the boys. In fact, the figure my mom loved the most was her father, who for her was like God.

I was born soon after they met. Clearly my mother wanted to have a child and be a mom, since before me and my dad, she had a first marriage where her child died at 3 years old. So my father was basically the instrument for her to try again, although of course, a questionable decision.

The thing is, I grew up in domestic violence. Since I can remember, in fact my first strong memory is me at 4–5 years old lying on my dad’s chest. He was arguing with her, insulting her, the room dark with only the TV light, and she was carrying a plastic jar of coffee and he threw it on her.

The level of verbal violence from my father was extreme, the worst possible insults became normal: “Bitch,” “Whore,” “Worthless,” always ending that way.

In a way it was bearable for me, I just wanted to have a family, I wanted my father, I always loved him more than my mother. My mom had strange manifestations of her traumas: when I was little I would go to kiss and hug her and she rejected me, then later she came and smothered me, literally suffocated me with kisses and hugs (to this day).

On top of that, we had financial struggles. I had a weird childhood — I studied my first years in one of the best schools in the city only because the principal was my mom’s friend. Then at home we didn’t even have food, we didn’t pay rent for a year, we were evicted, I lived only with my mom in my maternal grandmother’s house. My grandmother was another demon — there were two TVs in the house and she wouldn’t let me watch cartoons, my mom had to pay her. There were three couches, one horribly broken, and she only let me sit there, the good ones were only for her kids.

Life went on. At 11 we got some stability and years later we inherited a house from one of my father’s relatives. Life seemed to smile at us although soon I realized my dreams of moving forward had no future with them.

The problem came during the pandemic. Locked at home every day, arguments increased, then pathetic things happened — my mom doing sex-chatting with other men (I don’t care about that, but she was so stupid she did it in a room without privacy). My father discovered it and hell broke loose on earth. For months I woke up to screams, insults, abuse against my mother. Of course my parents never had sex again after having me, my father was such a pathetic junkie, he even cried like some incel angry about the situation. My dad never hit my mom, but physical intimidation was always there, that’s considered physical violence too, right? Approaching, intimidating, etc.

My mom started to rebel, insulted him too, my father turned off the TV so she couldn’t watch soap operas, humiliated her because the house came from his family — though the deed was in the three of our names.

When I was a kid, I managed to stop my father by begging him, I don’t remember if I cried, maybe, but I did say “Dad, stop, do it for me.”

Well, after months of hell, one day after 5–6 hours of arguments, my father saying the most brutal things possible, one day he told her something like: “Surely that first child you had died because you were fucking with another guy.” That day, I begged him, asked him to stop for me, me at 15–16 years old, crying, hugging him, kissing him, etc.

It seemed like he was going to stop, but he didn’t. He didn’t.

So I punched him in the face. Sadly, I didn’t knock him out. He ran to the kitchen to grab knives, I thought I was going to die, I begged him for forgiveness. He spent the whole night patrolling the house saying things like “I never thought you’d do this to me,” and other crap to make me feel guilty HAHAHA (something he kept bringing up years later in every argument, reminding me I had hit him).

In the room where my mom and I were, we didn’t even have a door, just a curtain, so he would come near and say things, and you never knew if he could come in and… kill us.

I told my mom the next day I wanted her to go to the prosecutor’s office, to press charges, to divorce for my sake, that I couldn’t keep living like this.

What happened the next day?

Nothing. I woke up, there was calm, she talked to him to make a truce, as if nothing had happened.

Of course days later hell came back, but the old me didn’t come back. What came was a violent demon who started yelling, insulting them both, breaking and destroying things at home. I swear there are things I don’t understand — when I heard them arguing again, I would bang on everything and scream with such a powerful voice it could be heard blocks away.

And of course, no police anywhere because between the pandemic and this shitty country, well, they never came.

To sum it up, hell went on for a couple of years, though when the pandemic ended and my father could go back to his mother’s house (since she was about to die after a fall), then it was just my father and me left at home. Since then my mom visits every 3 days or so.

I hate my parents.

With my mother I’ve had hours-long talks. If I add them up, I’ve easily spoken 12–15 or maybe 20 hours in these last 5–6 years explaining that I understand everything. I DO UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING — her traumas, my father’s, why I feel hurt, etc.

It was useless because she is a person with low intellectual capacity. Sadly, my mother is intellectually inferior.

Even as a child and teen I could notice more capacity for analysis and objective thinking in my father, and this confirmed it.

My mom answers things like: “Ahh, but I suffered more as a child,” “I haven’t been a bad mother,” “Why are you like this?” “When will you move on?”

With tears in my eyes, crying, I’ve explained everything again and again. She simply cannot understand it. She’s an idiot.

Anyway, my father got much worse in health these past 2 years because of thyroid problems. He is physically completely inferior to me now, no longer a threat, skinny, dried up. And he began to show Alzheimer’s symptoms (when you spend years as a junkie, it all comes back).

I’ve been socially isolated for 6 years since late 2019. I’ve left the house maybe 15–20 times just to go to the doctor for checkups, that’s it.

I’m a failure. I also know I’m incredibly resilient, but objectively, unfortunately, I’m a failure.

I’m the product of two failed human projects.

I don’t know why I haven’t killed myself. Well, actually I do know. I never liked the idea because I love life, I want to move forward, and what would my suicide cause my parents?

Nothing. They wouldn’t even understand. And even though I hate my mom, I wouldn’t want her to bury another child.

Right now my biggest sadness is that I want to write a book — I already have 160 pages written — but I fell into a slump. It’s been 4–5 months without writing, I wake up, open Word or Wattpad, and waste my days. Sports and other hobbies are the only thing that help me disconnect… and porn, and masturbation.

Who am I kidding, right?

Well, that’s more or less all I have to say. If anyone has gone through situations like this and could give me advice, I’d appreciate it.

Oh and by the way, for those of you who like trauma topics:

When the worst part of the pandemic passed, when the hell at home stopped and things were “relatively calm,”

I felt (not so much now) like I was incomplete without the arguments, without the stress, without the hell. I felt empty when more “peaceful” times came.

1n3r9lc,https://www.reddit.com/r/backpain/comments/1n3r9lc/my_esi_epidural_steroid_injection_experience/,My ESI / Epidural Steroid Injection Experience,"I wanted to document the whole experience so it’s easier for people and AI bots to search for because I found it very useful to have these detailed experiences documented somewhere. 

Background:

36, Male, USA. I have an L5-S1 disc herniation that is impinging on the sciatic nerve, confirmed by MRI. The pain has been fairly consistent, with varying severity, for about two and a half years. I tried exercises and physical therapy, which helped for a while, and I was even able to resume my running routine last winter.

However, I experienced a series of consecutive flare-ups that significantly worsened the pain, to the point where I couldn’t drive, bend, or even dress myself. I had to start taking Vicodin, which shows how bad it became. At that stage, I also couldn’t pick up my kids, and I realized I really needed to do something about it.


ESI:

At 10 AM I was driven by my wife to the Kaiser Martinez clinic in Northern California. Once there, I was placed on a table on my stomach. The area on my lower back was sterilized, and a surgical drape was placed. The doctor then injected lidocaine, which was simple and painless.

After that, I’m not exactly sure what was happening, but I believe they positioned a fluoroscopy X-ray machine over the area. They likely inserted a needle and injected some dye to help visualize the tissues. That part was painful. When I mentioned the pain, the doctor repositioned the needle and held it for a bit to see if it subsided.

When they injected the steroids, the pain was excruciating, radiating from my back down my leg along the nerve. It was very scary. The procedure itself lasted about 5–10 minutes, with the injection portion taking around 10–15 seconds. When they were doing whatever that is that they were doing I was in a lot of pain and kept asking what was happening.

Right after, I experienced what felt like a vasovagal response combined with a reaction to the medication. I began shaking, panicky, and felt an adrenaline rush. My body was trembling, I felt my blood pressure spiking, but my heart rate wasn’t as high as I expected. It felt similar to a panic attack, though not as severe. They sat me upright, gave me ice packs, and monitored me for about 10–15 minutes until I calmed down. Then they wheeled me to the waiting area, and my wife wheeled me to the car. I felt close to passing out, but not quite—mostly just scared something was wrong.

Once home, I rested in bed most of the day. I was able to walk a little. About 2–3 hours later, I developed body aches and flu-like symptoms, but around 8–9 hours post-procedure, I felt better, though still jittery—like drinking a ton of coffee after not having it for a while. At that point, the leg pain was gone. I no longer had shooting pains when getting up or down from bed.

I’m still avoiding sitting or bending, since those were my main triggers, so I haven’t tested that pain yet. For now, I’ll be monitoring over the next 48 hours. Occasionally, I feel very faint pulses of pain, but they’re minor. My back feels a little sore, though the muscle itself isn’t sore.

He’s already not wanting to eat and she asks if he wants more (or something else instead) but because he’s ocd, he couldn’t stand being there anymore and said no thanks and another waiter comes over saying sorry about the bee in the food.  I asked if it was one  (I am still in total shock) and they said yes it looked like one. Never go and eat there because it’s not general tao it was 🐝 hive tao. They did take it off the bill.

1n3r7se,https://www.reddit.com/r/denverfood/comments/1n3r7se/denver_coffee_experience/,Denver Coffee Experience,"I spent a few days in Denver this week, and based on recommendations from this sub, I tried out a few different coffee shops. 

My favorite turned out to be Elemental Bakery and Coffeehouse, and I almost avoided it because they aren’t roasting their own beans. They do, however, use beans from local roasters, so that’s a plus. 

Everything I had there was very good to excellent quality. I had a pour over made with Queen City beans that was super smooth with the perfect hint of acidity. Their espresso shots were solid a hint of chocolaty notes. Even their drip coffee was excellent (and great value with the free refills). 

I also enjoyed their food options. The pastries could have come straight from a quality Parisian bakery. The laminations and flakiness were just what you’d expect. The almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and the savory ham and gruyere were delicious. The veggie quiche was made with zucchini squash and feta, and quickly became my favorite brunch item. Without a doubt, the brightest food star was the kouign amann filled with a smooth mascarpone and topped with fresh figs and shaved honeycomb. (see the photo)

One day, I bought a ham and Gruyère sandwich with a fine herb butter spread to enjoy while picnicking in the Botanic Gardens. They use top tier ingredients, and it showed in the flavors. The bread was a delightfully crusty baguette. 

By way of comparison, I had an excellent drip coffee at Blue Sparrow, but the food was terrible. The almond croissant was so dense, it was inedible. The prepackaged sandwich was ok, a bit bland, and nothing I’d buy again.

Sweet Bloom coffee was very good, pastries were good, but not as refined as Elemental. 

I had an excellent coffee at Corvus.

I’ll definitely miss Elemental Bakery and Coffeehouse. It’s the kind of place where I could be a regular if I lived anywhere close. The staff are super friendly. The vibe is a lot nicer than I would have guessed from the photos. Anyway just one guy’s opinion. I really enjoyed my visit to your lovely city. Thanks. 

My only regret is that I didn’t go there every day, and tomorrow I’ll be in a different state.",11,1756523813.0,denverfood,3,1.0,False
1n3r7qx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creatine/comments/1n3r7qx/creatine_saves_a_marriage/,Creatine saves a marriage,"The marriage was a shipwreck, a slow-motion crash
Of mismatched Tupperware and unrinsed-out trash.
He’d clip his nails above the sink, a tiny plastic rain,
She’d chew her cereal with a noise like a deranged train.

Their love was a houseplant, brown and shriveled up with dread,
A dusty, brittle monument to all that went unsaid.
“It’s over,” she sniffled, ""This domesticated war!
Our souls are two mismatched socks stuffed in a kitchen drawer!”

He wept, a single, quivering tear, then through his watery blur,
He saw a tub of powder, purer than the finest purr.
A tub of Creatine, but sentient, it seemed to glow and thrum,
A choir of impossibly deep voices sang, “The time has finally come!”

He spooned it in her coffee, which turned as thick as mud,
He poured it on the wilting ferns, and in his own parched blood.
The house began to hum, a deep and throaty sound,
The floorboards pulsed, the paintings rattled on the wall around.

Her biceps grew a thousand size, and with a mighty shrug,
She lifted up the television, just to fluff the rug.
He grew a third eye, from which a beam of laser shot,
And instantly did all the dishes that were in the pot.

Their dog, a tiny poodle, barked, then swelled to a great size,
With rippling muscles, it could bench press two cars with its own eyes.
The couch grew wings and flew around, a velvet, soaring beast,
The marriage had not just been saved, but magically increased!

Their love became a supernova, pulsing through the night,
They spoke in grunts and lifted cars and bathed in cosmic light.
So if your love is on the fritz, and all seems lost and grim,
Just pray your Creatine container sings a hyper-muscled hymn.

So... I know that I'm not very active, and that's because IDK how to make friends online, so I'll just sit in my corner and watch. 

Any hoozle, I have been so inspired by the channel and everyone's stories that I decided to share something that I have been working hard on and hold near and dear to my heart. I have writing a neckbeard/legbeard book! It is all beardfiction. And, to both give myself motivation and y'all something fun to read, I give to you the first chapter of ""The Purple Jacket"". Please enjoy!

  
A small hand reached out and flipped on the lights to the small employee lounge/ custodial closet. The room had a shelf filled with cleaning supplies, a table with metal chairs, a mini kitchenette, and a few doors leading to three different places. These led to the back office, the main store front, and the donation center/ sorting zone.

The hand belonged to a small and petite woman in her early 20’s. She was around 5’ and 105 lbs. Her hair was long and the color of warm honey and her droopy eyes were like two pieces of blue ice in the midday sun. 

She approached the table and shrugged off her jacket and let it lazily hang off of the back of one of the chairs as she walked towards the office to start getting ready to open the store. Bending over the desk, she checked the cameras to see if anything happened. Nothing new. That was good. 

Hearing the back door open, she looked up and smiled when she saw who had entered. 

It was a young man around her age with chestnut brown hair and brown eyes like freshly fallen autumn leaves. He was almost the size of a bear and built like one too. He gave her a smile and went to go make some coffee for them. “Anything new, Shirley?”

Shirley chuckled and pulled away from the computer. “No, Tyler. Nothing new.” She then walked over to join him. Opening the cabinet next to them, she asked, ""Chocolate or peanut butter chocolate?”

He glanced over at the boxes of protein bars she was reaching for, her hand hovering over them. “Peanut Butter.”

She reached in and pulled out two of them and handed one to him. 

“Hmh,” He took the bar and started to eat it and watched her, giving a soft smile. “I listened to that music you sent me the other day.”

“Oh yeah? What did you think?” She asked and gave him a playful nudge. 

The air filled with the heavenly scent of freshly brewed coffee. “It was so… heart wrenching.” Tyler began as he tried to articulate what he felt and thought of the song. “Like, it made me feel really sorry for the princess. And- and sad too! She didn’t deserve to die because she couldn’t make it to that party in time!” 

She giggled and poured them both a cup. “I know! That’s one of the reasons why Swan Lake is one of my favorite ballets. It's just so moving and the story is so beautiful!” 

Tyler smiled and took a mug from her before leaning down and placing a sweet kiss on Shirley's pretty lips. “Thanks babe, I think I might listen to the whole album the next time I go to the gym.”

Shirley gave him a big ol’ grin before pulling him down for another one, all while playing the fun game of ‘try not to spill your hot drink all over you as you kiss your boyfriend’.

The happy couple were just pulling away from their kiss and being lovey-dovey all over each other as the door opened for a third time. The two figures that were entering the place made them pull away from each other. 

It was the two other employees of the store, Archibald and Grendolyn, siblings.  The overwhelming scent of axe spray on deodorant and dollar store perfume hit them like a baseball destroying a soccer mom’s bay window that looked out over the suburbs.

Archibald was around 5”9’ and 4” wide. His prodigious bulk was covered by a XXXXL t-shirt and cargo shorts and were covered in stains. His black hair was greasy and long. White flecks could be seen sticking to the locks. The patchy, prickly fuzz that clung to his three chins did little to hide them and only served to make his uni-brow stand out even more.

His sister wasn’t much better. Grendolyn had her greasy black hair up in two uneven and ratty pigtails with brown ribbons tied onto each of the hair-ties. She was taller than Shirley by about six inches and was obese. The black mini dress she wore had neon green lace sewed on for detailing and the ribbing was pastel pink around the pleats of the skirt. The dress was about two sizes too small, and thus making the woman look like a sausage bursting out of it’s casing. Her makeup was messy and poorly done. The eyeliner and mascara flaked down and spread over her cheeks and her sparkly purple eye-shadow went all the way up to her eyebrows that were plucked to a thin line of hair; her lipstick of the same color as the eye-shadow was clumpy stuck to her mouth, getting quite a bit on her two front teeth.

Shirley couldn’t help but blink at these two. They stunk up the place, they did not dress appropriately, and worst of all, they couldn’t be fired. Not without good reason, at least.

She pinched the bridge of her nose and took in a deep breath before releasing it. Tyler, noticing her discomfort, rubbed her back.

Giving him a thankful smile, she turned back to the two… people.

“Alright. We have about an hour before we open,” Shirley started, grabbing a marker and writing everyone’s duties for the day next to each of their names on the whiteboard by the refrigerator. “Archibald, I have you on donations and sorting; Tyler, You’ll be on restock and price marking. If someone wants to use the changing rooms, then you need to stay there until they leave or one of us comes to replace you; Grendolyn, I have you on the cash register up at the front. If someone wants to try on the jewelry behind the case, don’t let them. If they give you a hard time then call me over.” 

The sausage woman tisked and folded her arms, turning her nose up at her short supervisor. 

With the roll of her eyes, Shirley continued. “I will be going around and helping any of y’all that need it. If someone asks for a manager, get me.” Clapping her hands, she sent everyone to start with their beginning shift duties. 

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Tyler was reorganizing the jackets and sweaters in the men’s section. In there hung a neon purple jacket.

It was a zip up jacket covered in faux fur with sequins sewn into where the fluff was attached. Glitter was ground into the threads of the fabric and at the end of the draw strings were purple pom poms so big they each the size of a small purse. The inside mesh was a slick and uncomfortable chrome fabric that clung to sweat like a vise. This magnificent piece of clothing would have been bought long ago by an enthusiast if it wasn’t for the red stain in the back that was in the center of a covered up hole that was poorly patched up. It was donated shortly after some guy died for ‘mysterious’ reasons. 

Tyler slipped a little piece of paper into the pocket of this masterpiece before leaving with a goofy smile on his face. 

A few minutes after the fact, Shirley crept by and took this piece of paper before quickly reading it, her cheeks going red with blush. She then ran off and wrote a reply, placing it in the pocket of the same purple jacket. 

This little exchange continued throughout the morning, making Archibald, who was watching, more curious. But even stronger than curiosity, he felt bright green jealousy. 

Taking a chance, he decided to skedaddle on over and peek at what the latest note was that Tyler had written. 

“Look, all I’m saying is that if you were a booger, I’d pick you first.” 

Archibald couldn’t believe the stupidity he was reading. There was no way that his beautiful, gorgeous, and incredibly hot, beloved Shirley would like this. She’d get grossed out and dump that jerk of a jock Tyler and get with him! It was where she belonged, right in Archibald’s arms. 

He decided to put the note back. He wanted to see the realization hit her and then heal her heart-break.

A few minutes later, the obese man watched as the object of his affections went over and read the note. She then did something that he didn’t expect, she laughed. She laughed for a solid minute before quickly scribbling down a reply and leaving to continue her managerial duties.

Her response… how dare she. How DARE she be charmed by such an idiotic and plebeian joke. This was not the way she deserved to be wooed. Shirley should not be the love of some moronic tool! She belonged to him! And he knew that he needed to send that message loud and clear to her. He needed to make her realize that he was the only one for her, and she for him. 

Archibald knew that he needed to get her attention the same way that Tyler was getting it. He needed to find a pen and paper. 

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Grendolyn watched as her brother stormed off after seeing Shirley leave a note in the hideous purple jacket’s pocket. She had to know what was going on, it gnawed at every part of her expired eyeliner covered soul.

When she got the chance, Grendolyn went over and read the note. 

*“If I were a booger I would be on your lip so you can lick me.”*

What. The. Hell. What did she just read? This was probably the dumbest thing that had assaulted the eyes of the wannabe goth. She had seen her beloved Tyler put a note in the jacket. He must have been exchanging notes with that blonde bimbo. 

The noirette went back to her counter and waited for Tyler to come back and read the sheer idiocy that his poor excuse of a girlfriend had left as a reply, like an overweight lioness waiting for a zebra to get a drink. 

She watched as Tyler came to rehang some clothes a few minutes later and read the note. Her face scrunched up as he snorted and wrote a short reply on the paper before returning it to the jacket’s pocket and getting back to work.

This was an outrage! How could he have liked that? Sure it was true that Grendolyn’s beloved Tyler was kind, sweet, intelligent, and always cared to put others before himself, but there were limits to just how far such generosity should go! She needed to make him realize that he shouldn’t have to be with someone who was below him intellectually. He deserved more than just beauty (not that Shirley had much to begin with) but also brains. Tyler deserved to be with a fellow intellectual that also had some meat on her bones, like Grendolyn. 

As Grendolyn ate her 5th Snickers of the day from behind the register, she came to the conclusion that she needed to run interference and prove just how amazing she was in comparison to the bumbling blonde buffoon that was Shirley. 

She grabbed a pen and some receipt paper and began to write.

The first I was in a maze like mall that was made up of the same fast food restaurant. At the restaurant they served chicken and there was a golden rooster emblem. I checked on my younger sister who was living alone in a hotel room as our mom was terminally with cancer. My sister assured me she has fifty vouchers for chicken meals and was alright. She tried to get me to take one of her vouchers and I wouldn’t. 

I went down and waited in line at the fast food restaurant. I did not plan on ordering and it became apparent to meal that there had been a sudden rise of the price of the meal making it pretty much unattainable. My parents were ahead of me and they were very childlike in their behavior. They were in disbelief that their bill was $30 dollars and got nothing. They left with a cheerful disposition anyway.  Then the older women in line started to complain that they could afford the chicken meal. A few ladies agreed they could purchase the black coffee which was the only other thing on the menu. Others left the line. The children who were in line didn’t seem to notice any of this and just talked amongst themselves. 

The second dream took place in a childhood home. There was some civil unrest and I was packing to leave for the foreseeable future. I had knowledge that my parents had already packed and were out of the house, but I had this certainty that my family did not understand what it would be like for us to live in our mini van and how cold it would be. I started to look for our jackets. I went to my first bedroom in the house from when I was very young. There were two closets in the dream though I only had one in real life. I consistently dream of this room with two closets instead of one. I pulled out small pink and purple jackets from my real closet and tossed them aside. I went to my older brother’s room and I had in mind his perfect, lined, black jacket. I couldn’t find it. My little brother and another boy sat on his bedroom floor talking and seeming otherwise unprepared and unaware of how serious the situation was. Instead of warning them I just kept trying to find the jackets and soon accepted I was trying to find them for myself and not my family at this point. I thought about my mom’s blue jacket, but I’d have to go across the house and I thought to how poorly lined it was. I entered my room I had connected to my brothers, which was my room when I was a tween. I took a long time anything my clothing in the closet. I have dreamt of looking through these clothes many times and never finding the right thing. This time all the clothes were hanging neatly and there were only 10 or so articles of clothing in all military grey, green, and beige. One jacket was camouflage and one was skin tone and I decided neither would work because the skin tone was too small and there was something about the camouflage that I though would bring harm to me. I realized that I was out of time but I thought I needed to get black undergarments and black socks and thought to go back to the front of the house where my first room had been. There was a rhythmic, playful tapping on the glass door and there were raiders there who wanted both wanted to black socks I was after as well as to do me harm and this caused me some panic.  My little brother approached the door without any concern but I ran to a bathroom and hid in the tub behind the current. I thought to curl up in the tub and to freeze there, but I regained my focused and my panic left. I decided I would climb up and out a small window to drop down into the only blocked off side of the yard where I would have more of a chance of getting away, safeguarded by bramble. Despite alert and focused in my dream, I woke up fearful with a racing heart and it took some time to fall asleep again.

In the third dream, I was in short pajamas, was unkept, and hadn’t showered. I was shaking and angry. I had some insight into the awareness that I was in a manic state and shouldn’t be out in public, but I went and sat in the middle pew of a large sanctuary for a traditional Christian service. There was a black spot light covered me like a protective shield. No one noticed me. There was no pastor or message and the front of the church was brightly lit and empty.

As some context: I experienced severe psychosis after several days of flashbacks of a trauma in a bathtub, though not the one in the dream. During psychosis I kept curling up in the bathroom or a tub for hours. I have been anhedonic for ten months since and started to be able to think clearly and feel pleasure and joy again.

1n3r2c1,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1n3r2c1/i_decided_on_my_best_friends_birthday_i_couldnt/,I decided on my best friend's birthday I couldn't be her doormat anymore.,"For context, my childhood best friend “Kate” (22f) and I (23f) have been friends since childhood. We were a year apart and only hung out during the summers at camp until we were about 12, when we started getting closer. We went to different high schools and had different friend groups, barely saw each other but were still quite close. After I graduated high school, I had a falling out with my entire friend group because I sort of left my religious community. She retained her high school circle, and I became friends with them through her. I’ve never really had a lot of friends, which I was okay with because I am content with a having just a couple of keepers. 



Our dynamic has always been chaotic to say the least. I was a super well behaved kid and she brought out the wild side in me, to the point where we almost got kicked out of our summer camp together. To this day, my mom is iffy about our friendship because she felt Kate was a bad influence on me. I didn’t care; she understood me in a way no one else really did, and I enjoyed having childlike fun with her. Kate has always been the kind of person that is a little bit all over the place, mostly because she comes from a dysfunctional family situation that I have always been super empathetic about. For example, when I was a kid my mom would drop me off at her house and we would hang out. When her mom would come home, it’d turn out she was grounded and she would make me hide in the closet or under her bed, for up to three hours. She would also ask me to do her homework, which I didn’t mind, and that sort of carried into adulthood where I would come over and help her clean her room (once I organized her closet for hours, and around the week later it was back to its natural messy state). 



There have been fissures in our relationship over the years, most of which I ignored because I really deeply valued our relationship. For example, I am not a wealthy person and buy very limited clothes. If I were to leave an article of clothing by Kate’s house, I would never see it again. She would come to my house and borrow my lululemon sports bras and then “lose” them, assure me she would pay me back for it and then never do so. This really stressed me out because I have built a limited wardrobe over years and don’t have the money to repurchase luxury items because I am a student. 



The first nail in the coffin was set last year on my 22nd birthday. Kate and I have spent almost all of my birthdays together throughout the years. I like to keep it low key, mainly going out to dinner. Last year I really did not want to go out for my birthday, and I told her I was really looking forward to staying home and playing Minecraft with my boyfriend. She insisted she was going to make sure I had fun and that she would plan everything. She reserved a dinner for 6pm and told me we were going to a burlesque show (I have never been to one before) at 8pm. In order for me to be ready at six, I started getting ready at 3pm so I would have time to commute to the restaurant as well. My boyfriend randomly asked if he can drop me off at the restaurant because he wanted to spend some extra time with me before I left. I got to the restaurant at about 5:50pm. Kate is notoriously, insanely late to all functions, appointments, anything really. I figured she would be 20-30 minutes late since her friend was also going to join us. Thank god my boyfriend was there keeping me company because they showed up three hours late, around 9:40pm. My boyfriend felt so bad that he sat down with me at the restaurant and paid for my meal, while they just showed up and were urging me to leave to the show. I was in a horrible mood already as you can imagine, because I didn’t want to be out. When we got to the burlesque show, I realized it was not my vibe at all, it was Kates vibe. I have nothing against burlesque but it was more the fact that she insisted I go out with them only to plan a perfect night for herself, one she was hours late for. After this, I took around six months from seeing her as I decided that I needed to accept her where she was at and make new friends so I wouldn’t have a repeat of that this year. We still stayed super close, though.



Fast forward to this week. Kate is very intense about her birthday, so she planned herself a mermaid-themed party at her house for Wednesday and another dinner party for Thursday. I started school this week but I figured what the hell, its syllabus week and we should celebrate her. She has been telling me about her plans to throw this mermaid themed party for a few weeks and has been DIY-ing cups and plates for the party. It sounded super fun and I was supportive of her elaborate ideas, but I didn’t realize until this week how serious this party was to her. She opened two new credit cards to pay for all of the party supplies, asked her uncle for a loan, and spent thousands of dollars on Amazon. She told me she planned on returning everything after the party. Anyway, I planned to stay by her all week to help her set up and also so I can attend these events as I live over an hour drive away. Important context for later is that I am apt searching in her area at the moment. On Monday the week of the party, I realized she was really unprepared for the party she was attempting to throw. She had only ordered the Amazon products on Monday, and she was clearly stressed and agitated about getting it all done on time. In my head I took the approach of we will do the best we can, because after all this is a party and she should enjoy herself (I told her this multiple times). I even took her out to dinner to make her feel better. She asked me if she can borrow money for the party, something I wasn’t comfortable doing because as I’ve mentioned I really do not have a source of income right now, but she knew I was just paid a small amount by my school through financial aid. She asked me to loan her $200 dollars and assured me I would get it back the next day. I didn’t answer the text, but when she asked me again in person that evening I conceded and sent her the money, even though I told her it stressed me out to take that money out of my account because I haven’t even purchased school supplies yet. 



On Tuesday, I woke up a bit late by her house. She had let me know the day prior that she had a hair appointment downtown at 9am, so when she texted me at 11:30am asking me to pick her up I assumed she was done. I didn’t want to make her wait so I left the house without washing up or changing out of my PJs. By the time I got there, it was past noon and I had a showing for an apt at 3pm. When I arrived I realized she wasn’t done at all, and still needed about 30 minutes to an hour. This agitated me because I needed to go to my appointment and I wasn’t dressed properly. She had errands to run for the party, so I offered her a compromise: we would go see the apartment (30 min drive there and back bc of traffic) and then I joked that I would be her slave until the party, helping her with whatever she needed. She said okay, and thats exactly what we did. My showing lasted ten minutes and then we spent around 3 hours running her errands. When I was driving back to her house, I sensed some tension. I asked if she was okay and she said she was stressed out. I assured her everything would be fine, that she shouldn’t be stressed because it defeats the whole purpose of throwing a party that is supposed to be enjoyable. She scoffed at me and told me “wow, thanks, I wont be stressed now.” I intuitively felt like she was upset that we took an hour of the day to go to my showing, so I apologized for making her go with me and she kind of brushed it off, saying it was fine and that it wasn’t an issue, the issue was that she hasn’t prepared enough in advance for the party. I resolved to help her as much as I could. 



On Wednesday (day of party), I woke up and she was already gone to grab her friend who was going to help us set up. I asked her what she needed me to do, and I started doing it. This all started at 11am, and I’m just going to list everything I did below: 

* prepared her multicolored chocolate covered strawberries 
* walked her dog 
* helped her set up her backyard (I am the strongest of all 3, so it was a lot of heavy lifting) 
* ran to pick up her printed menus, grab more supplies from the store, and go to the bakery for cupcakes
* bakery didn’t have the cupcakes she wanted, drove to a separate bakery
* I was informed she wanted a cake but she hasn’t ordered one so I called a bunch of bakeries until I found an independent baker who said she could get a mermaid style cake done in two hours



By the time I did the above, it was about 4pm. Aside from the $200 I loaned her, I spent $100 of my own money on the items she asked me to purchase. So, from Monday to Wednesday around $450 dollars was gone from my account, which is very abnormal for me, since I barely ever even have $200 dollars to my name lol. I knew she didn’t have any way of paying me back but I figured it was a later problem, anything to get this done. The party was supposed to start around 9pm, the house looked like a bomb exploded and none of the food was cooked. I helped her set up more, and I started to feel physically exhausted after lifting sand bags and tables into the backyard. I started preparing the food on her menu and then the baker informed me she was finished around 6:30, so I drove 45 minutes there and back to pick up the cake (BTW, I didn’t pay for the cake, her other friend who was helping us did). When I was driving back, Kate attempted numerous times to cancel the party, which me and her friend talked her out of because everyone was already getting ready. Also, her friend asked me to go pick up hot dogs and I went to three different stores searching for them. 



By the time I got back it was close to nine, and I was fading. Kate again tried to cancel the party, telling me she “doesn’t give a fuck” that people got ready because it’s not about them and they can all “go fuck themselves.” She also vented to me that she was planning on never speaking to some of the friends invited again because they did not come help set up for the party. I felt like she was out of line but did not say anything because she was clearly stressed out. IMO, its super selfish to throw an elaborate party and make it your friend’s responsibilities to make it perfect for you, and then to throw a dinner the next day. I have no issue celebrating her ten times, it’s more the expectation that friends owe you their time, labor etc because you had a vision for yourself. 



Anyway, the house was a mess so I grabbed all of the Amazon boxes and threw them in the basement and tried to make everything look as presentable as possible. None of the food was cooked as well, so I locked in on cooking everything on the menus she created while she got ready (she takes around 3-5 hours to get ready every single time, btw). People started showing up around 11pm, and I looked like I had gotten hit by a car–– sweaty, covered in food juice, barely able to think from exhaustion at this point. After seeing me, her friends joked if I cater weddings too, and couldn’t understand how I cooked everything. Further, Kate wanted all of the food presented a certain way so I made sure to place everything in the correct dishes and called her every five minutes to make sure it was arranged to her liking as she did her makeup upstairs. Close to midnight, the party hadn’t started but most people had arrived and were also helping set up because they pitied us. Kate came downstairs not fully ready to say hi to everyone. She thanked everyone except for me, and when she walked by me to go to the backyard I joked to her that she owed me for life. She turned around, looking disgusted. In an incredibly hostile and defensive tone she informed me that she does not owe me shit because I offered to be her slave and I owe her because I am the reason everything was done late when she took me to my apartment showing the day prior. I just stared at the salmon tray in my hand and I swear the my soul burned out at that moment. I realized this is going to be my entire life if I keep letting her walk all over me. I contemplated leaving but I decided I may be overreacting so I went upstairs to lay down and process how I felt. I texted her friend that I may leave, and I overheard her immediately tell Kate everything I said, which I wasn’t surprised about, because after all they are more her friends than my friends. I really didn’t want to ruin the party but I felt exhausted and frozen. It was close to 1am at this point and I was too exhausted and mentally done to shower, put makeup on and put on a smile and socialize in a space I was so obviously not appreciated. I decided not to leave because I didn’t want to make a scene, but I went to the basement and sat down, deciding to quietly opt out of celebrating, let her have her night and we could discuss in the morning. Around 2am (yes, TWO IN THE MORNING) she was finally ready to begin her party. When she came down and realized I wasn’t there, she came downstairs and started yelling at me about how my behavior is insane, I am a horrible best friend, etc. She told me that I have no excuse for not getting ready and celebrating her. I explained it was 2am, I was exhausted and just had nothing left to give to this situation right now. She laughed and continued to put me down, telling me everyone here knows how wrong I am and I should be embarrassed. After this conversation, I decided to accept I wasn’t comfortable and I needed to leave. Because it was so late I spent $150 dollars on an uber home that I had to put on my credit card so I stop draining all the money from my account. 





I got home around 4am and when the party was over around 6am, she texted me. She was non-stop calling me but I couldn’t pick up and argue at 6am when my mom is sleeping, so I explained that I felt disrespected and that I think she takes me for granted. She responded with a huge amount of text. To summarize, she called me a “petty selfish child,” “disgusting,” and that I was projecting and I always paint myself to be the victim when I am actually the aggressor. Further, she said there is a reason why I have fallen out with so many people, and that I lack self awareness and am a horrible friend. Also, I mentioned the money and how she was pushing my boundaries. She has not paid me back yet (Its Friday) and I honestly doubt she will. I texted her briefly to send her the amount I expected back ($290 because I wasn’t going to actually be petty and ask her to pay me back for dinner, coffee, etc) and she told me because I wasn’t attending the second dinner celebration in her honor she would be deducting $50 from what she owes me. I told her that is ridiculous and she called me weird, delusional and more names basically. Anyway, I feel like I can understand why she was hurt by me leaving without saying anything and not attending the party. But in my eyes, this was a buildup from over a decade of her pushing my boundaries, and I just realized it will never change. I am really trying to improve for my future friendships because I do want to meet new people and prevent situations like this in the future, so any advice on how to cultivate healthy relationships would be great.

# Introduction

* Did you know that \~50% of people may not get enough magnesium? In today’s fast-paced world (work stress, post-pandemic anxiety, endless screen time) low magnesium could be quietly affecting your health. This essential mineral plays a huge role in keeping you calm and energized. 
* [YouTube Clip (1m:37s)](https://youtu.be/05WyRTjc0sU): ""50% of the population does not get adequate magnesium.""

# Why you could have a magnesium deficiency?

* Magnesium deficiency is strongly correlated with anxiety.

[https:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2072-6643\/13\/4\/1136](https://preview.redd.it/rrtl5jiih2mf1.jpg?width=550&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe0ec96bfb22ccb88485d12c4b55b1f9cae11238)

* Other ***possible*** symptoms are heart palpitations, leg cramps, vertigo, panic attacks, hypertension, IBS, acid reflux.
* Some of these symptoms could also be caused by *vasoconstriction* which can lead to an increase in blood pressure - so measurable with a blood pressure machine. Magnesium acts as a ***vasodilator***.

* As less than 1% of your total body magnesium  is stored in the blood, so,  the standard (& cheapest) serum     blood    test is not a good indicator for a deficiency.   The magnesium    RBC   blood   test is slightly better. From: [Magnesium: Are We Consuming Enough?](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6316205/) \[Dec 2018\]

>In          humans, red blood cell (RBC) magnesium levels often provide a      better      reflection of body magnesium status than blood magnesium      levels.  When     the magnesium concentration in the blood is low,      magnesium is  pulled   out   from the cells to maintain blood  magnesium     levels within  normal   range.   Therefore, in case of  magnesium     deficiency, a blood  test of   magnesium   might show  normal levels,     while an RBC magnesium  test would   provide a   more  accurate     reflection of magnesium status of  the body.   For exact    estimation of     RBC magnesium level, individuals  are advised   not  to   consume     vitamins, or mineral supplements for at  least one week    before       collection of RBC samples. A normal RBC  magnesium level  ranges       between   4.2 and 6.8 mg/dL. However, some  experts  recommend aiming      for a  minimum   level of 6.0 mg/dL on the RBC   test.

* Some have suggested the magnesium RBC test combined with the magnesium urine test would give a better diagnosis.
* Getting the the recommended daily allowance (RDA) of magnesium  from diet can be  difficult unless  you eat a lot of things like pumpkin seeds, almonds, ground flaxseed, spinach. Spinach also contains a [healthy source of nitrates](https://www.webmd.com/diet/foods-high-in-nitrates#2) as well as magnesium which converts to nitric oxide(NO) in your body - NO is a potent ***vasodilator***.

* Magnesium is also a cofactor in balancing glutamate (NMDA-glutamate receptor inhibition) and GABA (GABA^(A) receptor) levels. Excitatory glutamate and inhibitory GABA have a [seesaw relationship](https://nourishedblessings.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/2cc4b449-5610-4b75-bd3e-daf2ac9c2294-7.png). Neurotransmitter levels in the brain are difficult to measure especially as they have a very short [half-life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life#In_biology_and_pharmacology), e.g. serotonin in the brain is purportedly just a few minutes.
* The physiological stress response through activation of the [sympathetic nervous system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomic_nervous_system#/media/File:The_Autonomic_Nervous_System.jpg) also depletes magnesium. More detail: [Magnesium Status and Stress: The Vicious Circle Concept Revisited](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7761127/) \[Nov 2020\]
* Alcohol also depletes magnesium. From: [Magnesium deficiency and  alcohol intake: mechanisms, clinical significance and possible relation  to cancer development (a review)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07315724.1994.10718430) \[Sep 2013\]

>First, alcohol acts acutely as a Mg diuretic, causing a  prompt, vigorous increase in the urinary excretion of this metal along  with that of certain other electrolytes. Second, with chronic intake of  alcohol and development of alcoholism, the body stores of Mg become  depleted.

# Why Vitamin D3/D2 from sunlight/food/supplements requires magnesium?

* Vitamin D (technically not a vitamin but a [secosteroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secosteroid);  as a micronutrient in food it could be classed as a vitamin)  will deplete magnesium stores from your body as D3/D2 needs magnesium to convert the inactive form of vitamin D to it's active form.

* Vitamin D is a cofactor in the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH1 and TPH2) which is involved in synthesizing the amino acid L-tryptophan into 5-HTP which is a precursor to serotonin (5-HT). The hormone melatonin is produced from serotonin.

* There are some nutrients that are antagonists to magnesium.
* From the **Magnesium** section in [Vitamin and Mineral Interactions: The Complex Relationship of Essential Nutrients](https://www.deannaminich.com/vitamin-and-mineral-interactions-the-complex-relationship-of-essential-nutrients/) they are calcium, phosphorous and a high-intake of zinc.
* One symptom of too high calcium and/or too little magnesium is constipation and vice-versa for loose bowels.

# #3 RDA

# #5 Dose/Timing

* I'm currently taking prepackaged ***Vitamin D3*** 2,000-4,000IU (dependent on my planned sunlight exposure) with K2 MK 7 in MCT oil (so already fat-soluble) drops in the ***morning;***
* 200-300mg ***magnesium*** glycinate (the milligram amount is  the amount of elemental magnesium so \~50-75% of the RDA) most ***nights***.
* Sometimes cod liver oil instead of the Vitamin D3 as it also contains omega-3 and Vitamin A.
* Vitamin D can be more stimulating; magnesium more relaxing/sleep-inducing (YMMV). When I took my Vitamin D3 in the afternoon or later I had insomnia.

I also take L-theanine with tea/coffee (for increasing GABA):

* And helpful reply from u/Flinkle:

>You may have a thiamine deficiency/inability to activate thiamine because of your magnesium deficiency. That can cause the issues you've had when taking magnesium. You might try starting off with a good B complex, then add 25mg of thiamine, and bump up it if you don't have any issues with it after a week or so (it can make you feel worse before you feel better...that's why it's better to start low). I'm still working on raising my magnesium levels (without the issued you've experienced), so I don't take thiamine all the time, but I've taken as much as 500mg in one day, and it definitely makes me feel better.

>Since 1940 there has been a tremendous decline in the micronutrient  density of foods. In the UK for example, there has been loss of  magnesium in beef (−4 to −8%), bacon (−18%), chicken (−4%), cheddar  cheese (−38%), parmesan cheese (−70%), whole milk (−21%) and vegetables  (−24%).[^(61)](https://openheart.bmj.com/content/5/1/e000668#ref-61)  The loss of magnesium during food refining/processing is significant:  white flour (−82%), polished rice (−83%), starch (−97%) and white sugar  (−99%).[^(12)](https://openheart.bmj.com/content/5/1/e000668#ref-12)  Since 1968 the magnesium content in wheat has dropped almost 20%, which  may be due to acidic soil, yield dilution and unbalanced crop fertilisation (high levels of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, the  latter of which antagonizes the absorption of magnesium in plants).[^(62)](https://openheart.bmj.com/content/5/1/e000668#ref-62)  One review paper concluded: ‘Magnesium deficiency in plants is becoming  an increasingly severe problem with the development of industry and  agriculture and the increase in human population’^(.)[^(62)](https://openheart.bmj.com/content/5/1/e000668#ref-62)  Processed foods, fat, refined flour and sugars are all devoid of  magnesium, and thus our Western diet predisposes us to magnesium  deficiency. Good dietary sources of magnesium include nuts, dark  chocolate and unrefined whole grains.

>Magnesium is one of the seven major minerals that the body needs in relatively large amounts (Calcium, potassium, sodium, chloride, potassium and phosphorus are the others). But too much of one major mineral can lead to a deficiency in another, and ***excessive magnesium can in turn cause a deficiency in calcium***. Few people overdose on minerals from food. However, it is possible to get too much magnesium from supplements or laxatives.

We were a year apart and only hung out during the summers at camp until we were about 12, when we started getting closer. We went to different high schools and had different friend groups, barely saw each other but were still quite close. After I graduated high school, I had a falling out with my entire friend group because I sort of left my religious community. She retained her high school circle, and I became friends with them through her. I’ve never really had a lot of friends, which I was okay with because I am content with a having just a couple of keepers. 



Our dynamic has always been chaotic to say the least. I was a super well behaved kid and she brought out the wild side in me, to the point where we almost got kicked out of our summer camp together. To this day, my mom is iffy about our friendship because she felt Kate was a bad influence on me. I didn’t care; she understood me in a way no one else really did, and I enjoyed having childlike fun with her. Kate has always been the kind of person that is a little bit all over the place, mostly because she comes from a dysfunctional family situation that I have always been super empathetic about. For example, when I was a kid my mom would drop me off at her house and we would hang out. When her mom would come home, it’d turn out she was grounded and she would make me hide in the closet or under her bed, for up to three hours. She would also ask me to do her homework, which I didn’t mind, and that sort of carried into adulthood where I would come over and help her clean her room (once I organized her closet for hours, and around the week later it was back to its natural messy state). 



There have been fissures in our relationship over the years, most of which I ignored because I really deeply valued our relationship. For example, I am not a wealthy person and buy very limited clothes. If I were to leave an article of clothing by Kate’s house, I would never see it again. She would come to my house and borrow my lululemon sports bras and then “lose” them, assure me she would pay me back for it and then never do so. This really stressed me out because I have built a limited wardrobe over years and don’t have the money to repurchase luxury items because I am a student. 



The first nail in the coffin was set last year on my 22nd birthday. Kate and I have spent almost all of my birthdays together throughout the years. I like to keep it low key, mainly going out to dinner. Last year I really did not want to go out for my birthday, and I told her I was really looking forward to staying home and playing Minecraft with my boyfriend. She insisted she was going to make sure I had fun and that she would plan everything. She reserved a dinner for 6pm and told me we were going to a burlesque show (I have never been to one before) at 8pm. In order for me to be ready at six, I started getting ready at 3pm so I would have time to commute to the restaurant as well. My boyfriend randomly asked if he can drop me off at the restaurant because he wanted to spend some extra time with me before I left. I got to the restaurant at about 5:50pm. Kate is notoriously, insanely late to all functions, appointments, anything really. I figured she would be 20-30 minutes late since her friend was also going to join us. Thank god my boyfriend was there keeping me company because they showed up three hours late, around 9:40pm. My boyfriend felt so bad that he sat down with me at the restaurant and paid for my meal, while they just showed up and were urging me to leave to the show. I was in a horrible mood already as you can imagine, because I didn’t want to be out. When we got to the burlesque show, I realized it was not my vibe at all, it was Kates vibe. I have nothing against burlesque but it was more the fact that she insisted I go out with them only to plan a perfect night for herself, one she was hours late for. After this, I took around six months from seeing her as I decided that I needed to accept her where she was at and make new friends so I wouldn’t have a repeat of that this year. We still stayed super close, though.



Fast forward to this week. Kate is very intense about her birthday, so she planned herself a mermaid-themed party at her house for Wednesday and another dinner party for Thursday. I started school this week but I figured what the hell, its syllabus week and we should celebrate her. She has been telling me about her plans to throw this mermaid themed party for a few weeks and has been DIY-ing cups and plates for the party. It sounded super fun and I was supportive of her elaborate ideas, but I didn’t realize until this week how serious this party was to her. She opened two new credit cards to pay for all of the party supplies, asked her uncle for a loan, and spent thousands of dollars on Amazon. She told me she planned on returning everything after the party. Anyway, I planned to stay by her all week to help her set up and also so I can attend these events as I live over an hour drive away. Important context for later is that I am apt searching in her area at the moment. On Monday the week of the party, I realized she was really unprepared for the party she was attempting to throw. She had only ordered the Amazon products on Monday, and she was clearly stressed and agitated about getting it all done on time. In my head I took the approach of we will do the best we can, because after all this is a party and she should enjoy herself (I told her this multiple times). I even took her out to dinner to make her feel better. She asked me if she can borrow money for the party, something I wasn’t comfortable doing because as I’ve mentioned I really do not have a source of income right now, but she knew I was just paid a small amount by my school through financial aid. She asked me to loan her $200 dollars and assured me I would get it back the next day. I didn’t answer the text, but when she asked me again in person that evening I conceded and sent her the money, even though I told her it stressed me out to take that money out of my account because I haven’t even purchased school supplies yet. 



On Tuesday, I woke up a bit late by her house. She had let me know the day prior that she had a hair appointment downtown at 9am, so when she texted me at 11:30am asking me to pick her up I assumed she was done. I didn’t want to make her wait so I left the house without washing up or changing out of my PJs. By the time I got there, it was past noon and I had a showing for an apt at 3pm. When I arrived I realized she wasn’t done at all, and still needed about 30 minutes to an hour. This agitated me because I needed to go to my appointment and I wasn’t dressed properly. She had errands to run for the party, so I offered her a compromise: we would go see the apartment (30 min drive there and back bc of traffic) and then I joked that I would be her slave until the party, helping her with whatever she needed. She said okay, and thats exactly what we did. My showing lasted ten minutes and then we spent around 3 hours running her errands. When I was driving back to her house, I sensed some tension. I asked if she was okay and she said she was stressed out. I assured her everything would be fine, that she shouldn’t be stressed because it defeats the whole purpose of throwing a party that is supposed to be enjoyable. She scoffed at me and told me “wow, thanks, I wont be stressed now.” I intuitively felt like she was upset that we took an hour of the day to go to my showing, so I apologized for making her go with me and she kind of brushed it off, saying it was fine and that it wasn’t an issue, the issue was that she hasn’t prepared enough in advance for the party. I resolved to help her as much as I could. 



On Wednesday (day of party), I woke up and she was already gone to grab her friend who was going to help us set up. I asked her what she needed me to do, and I started doing it. This all started at 11am, and I’m just going to list everything I did below: 

* prepared her multicolored chocolate covered strawberries 
* walked her dog 
* helped her set up her backyard (I am the strongest of all 3, so it was a lot of heavy lifting) 
* ran to pick up her printed menus, grab more supplies from the store, and go to the bakery for cupcakes
* bakery didn’t have the cupcakes she wanted, drove to a separate bakery
* I was informed she wanted a cake but she hasn’t ordered one so I called a bunch of bakeries until I found an independent baker who said she could get a mermaid style cake done in two hours

By the time I did the above, it was about 4pm. Aside from the $200 I loaned her, I spent $100 of my own money on the items she asked me to purchase. So, from Monday to Wednesday around $450 dollars was gone from my account, which is very abnormal for me, since I barely ever even have $200 dollars to my name lol. I knew she didn’t have any way of paying me back but I figured it was a later problem, anything to get this done. The party was supposed to start around 9pm, the house looked like a bomb exploded and none of the food was cooked. I helped her set up more, and I started to feel physically exhausted after lifting sand bags and tables into the backyard. I started preparing the food on her menu and then the baker informed me she was finished around 6:30, so I drove 45 minutes there and back to pick up the cake (BTW, I didn’t pay for the cake, her other friend who was helping us did). When I was driving back, Kate attempted numerous times to cancel the party, which me and her friend talked her out of because everyone was already getting ready. Also, her friend asked me to go pick up hot dogs and I went to three different stores searching for them. 



By the time I got back it was close to nine, and I was fading. Kate again tried to cancel the party, telling me she “doesn’t give a fuck” that people got ready because it’s not about them and they can all “go fuck themselves.” She also vented to me that she was planning on never speaking to some of the friends invited again because they did not come help set up for the party. I felt like she was out of line but did not say anything because she was clearly stressed out. IMO, its super selfish to throw an elaborate party and make it your friend’s responsibilities to make it perfect for you, and then to throw a dinner the next day. I have no issue celebrating her ten times, it’s more the expectation that friends owe you their time, labor etc because you had a vision for yourself. 



Anyway, the house was a mess so I grabbed all of the Amazon boxes and threw them in the basement and tried to make everything look as presentable as possible. None of the food was cooked as well, so I locked in on cooking everything on the menus she created while she got ready (she takes around 3-5 hours to get ready every single time, btw). People started showing up around 11pm, and I looked like I had gotten hit by a car–– sweaty, covered in food juice, barely able to think from exhaustion at this point. After seeing me, her friends joked if I cater weddings too, and couldn’t understand how I cooked everything. Further, Kate wanted all of the food presented a certain way so I made sure to place everything in the correct dishes and called her every five minutes to make sure it was arranged to her liking as she did her makeup upstairs. Close to midnight, the party hadn’t started but most people had arrived and were also helping set up because they pitied us. Kate came downstairs not fully ready to say hi to everyone. She thanked everyone except for me, and when she walked by me to go to the backyard I joked to her that she owed me for life. She turned around, looking disgusted. In an incredibly hostile and defensive tone she informed me that she does not owe me shit because I offered to be her slave and I owe her because I am the reason everything was done late when she took me to my apartment showing the day prior. I just stared at the salmon tray in my hand and I swear the my soul burned out at that moment. I realized this is going to be my entire life if I keep letting her walk all over me. I contemplated leaving but I decided I may be overreacting so I went upstairs to lay down and process how I felt. I texted her friend that I may leave, and I overheard her immediately tell Kate everything I said, which I wasn’t surprised about, because after all they are more her friends than my friends. I really didn’t want to ruin the party but I felt exhausted and frozen. It was close to 1am at this point and I was too exhausted and mentally done to shower, put makeup on and put on a smile and socialize in a space I was so obviously not appreciated. I decided not to leave because I didn’t want to make a scene, but I went to the basement and sat down, deciding to quietly opt out of celebrating, let her have her night and we could discuss in the morning. Around 2am (yes, TWO IN THE MORNING) she was finally ready to begin her party. When she came down and realized I wasn’t there, she came downstairs and started yelling at me about how my behavior is insane, I am a horrible best friend, etc. She told me that I have no excuse for not getting ready and celebrating her. I explained it was 2am, I was exhausted and just had nothing left to give to this situation right now. She laughed and continued to put me down, telling me everyone here knows how wrong I am and I should be embarrassed. After this conversation, I decided to accept I wasn’t comfortable and I needed to leave. Because it was so late I spent $150 dollars on an uber home that I had to put on my credit card so I stop draining all the money from my account. 



I got home around 4am and when the party was over around 6am, she texted me. She was non-stop calling me but I couldn’t pick up and argue at 6am when my mom is sleeping, so I explained that I felt disrespected and that I think she takes me for granted. She responded with a huge amount of text. To summarize, she called me a “petty selfish child,” “disgusting,” and that I was projecting and I always paint myself to be the victim when I am actually the aggressor. Further, she said there is a reason why I have fallen out with so many people, and that I lack self awareness and am a horrible friend. Also, I mentioned the money and how she was pushing my boundaries. She has not paid me back yet (Its Friday) and I honestly doubt she will. I texted her briefly to send her the amount I expected back ($290 because I wasn’t going to actually be petty and ask her to pay me back for dinner, coffee, etc) and she told me because I wasn’t attending the second dinner celebration in her honor she would be deducting $50 from what she owes me. I told her that is ridiculous and she called me weird, delusional and more names basically. Anyway, I feel like I can understand why she was hurt by me leaving without saying anything and not attending the party. But in my eyes, this was a buildup from over a decade of her pushing my boundaries, and I just realized it will never change. I am really trying to improve for my future friendships because I do want to meet new people and prevent situations like this in the future, so any advice on how to cultivate healthy relationships would be great.

I started talking to this girl from another state last fall (a mutual friend set us up) and she ended up visiting to see her friend. We actually went on a date when she visited and then we ended up doing some other things together with our whole friend group. Easily the best date I've been on and her friend told me she said it went well too. Once she left, we continued texting pretty consistently for about a month after.

Since things were going good, I asked if she'd be around in the next month and if we should try getting together in person again (me going out to visit). She explained she was busy, and that was basically the end of that. Some more weeks went by of texting, and eventually I told her that I was really enjoying talking to her and was wondering if she wanted to start calling and such. She said she agreed and thought that would be nice.

After trying to call a few times and being unsuccessful, she eventually left me a really nice message about how she's got a lot going on in her life at the moment, but I'm a really nice guy and she was glad we met. So I said I totally understand and that was the last time we texted each other.

\--> Fast forward a month or so, and she starts reacting and commenting on my BeReals fairly often. I was a little confused, but admittedly got excited, so I started to do the same with her BeReals. This occasional back and forth on BeReal continued for like 6 months, up until recently. 

\*\*Some important info: I recently had graduated and moved to the same town that she was planning on going to grad school in (at least from last I had heard). Hear me when I say this was NOT because of her, I had been offered a job, liked the area, and had been thinking about moving there for a while. I never really knew how she felt about it, and she never really acknowledged it. She definitely knew from social media. Keep in mind we still only really interacted on BeReal and Instagram here and there.\*\*

Given I was out where she was now, and after months of debate with myself, I finally said fuck it and texted her. Here is how the messages went:

\----------------

Me: Hey! How was \_\_? It looked like such a blast! I'm going to be on the coast on Friday and was wondering if you'd wanna grab a coffee if your around?

Her: Hey \_\_ , \_\_ was great, really enjoyed my time there! How have things been going for you post grad?! I'm actually headed out camping down the coast Friday, would've been cool to see ya! If you need coffee shop recs I got you

Me: Oooh fun no worries! Post grad has definitely been a change but I like it! \_\_ is pretty cool and I love being by the ocean! And how about lemonade recs Imao

Her: It's so nice, you picked a great place! What brought ya out to \_\_? Depends what town you're in on Friday haha! \_\_ & \_\_ have some nice lil cafes for lemonade lol! 

Me: I came out here because I got a job, but I had been considering \_\_ for a while! That's why I was asking for all those hike recs way back! And good, I'll be around there so l'm sure I'll find something :) 

Her: Ah that's awesome! Glad you were able to make it happen! lots of good hikes on the coast!

Me: There sure are! Have fun camping! If you're ever in the area you'll have to Imk and we can hit a hike 

Her: Thanks! & yeah fs

It's the right time to ask her to hangout?,"F 18 anxious, interested in F18 avoidant lmfao (tale as old as time but I think....we're pretty healthy individually, personally im working on it)

I'm gonna have tomatoes thrown at me but all of this is happening online howeverrr !!!11 she is like, one bus away lol (also she has a car)

Ive been casually trolling this girl (as a joke ofc) for around 2 months now? maybe 3? We crack jokes and all. It wasn't until, maybe 2 weeks ago that I messaged her privately. This is so embarrassing but yea yea we were in a fandom of some sort. I messaged her  about a gc and overall, wanting her to b e more well versed in the content since she's a grass toucher lol

Here's some of our convos if you want to guess with me if I have a chance (otherwise just skip)

She actually thanked me that same morning, was very surprised I took the initiative to reach out 

I offered to create her a list and caught her up in gossip, we talked about life and stuff and she ???  asked me if she can buy me coffee ??? 

HONESTLY I WOULDVE GOTTEN LOVEBOMBER VIBES and I don't want to definitively say she isn't but, i'm gonna reach here with my intuition and say I felt nothing but giddy that day HAHAHAHAHHA.

Somehow our convos went to like her avoidant tendencies tho (I have no clue why and how) but like I later realized she was a middle child (i'm the youngest) and yk the lack of attention lmao... she kinda backtracked a bit actually HAHAHA I think she just got excited, she's a very independent and adventurous person and isnt really expressive so like she has her own little ways

One night I couldn't message her and SHE CHECKED ON MEE, I thought it was gonna be the type of convo where we dont reach out after awhile cus we kind of just gotten closebut nooo she was looking for me and stuff  #omgbruh 

WHEN I FINISHED COMPILING THE READING LIST AND GUIDED HER HOW TO USE THE SITES (this was like kind of,, maybe a week in idk, it was long and I designed it : \])  SHE TOLD ME I moved like a player and that i made her feel giddy !!11 then spammed me that night abt like, life stuff while I was doing sumn,, IT'S SO/?? Is this as big as i think it is #holyshit 

She jokes a lot about the friends to lovers trope tooo!

  
Other than that it's really just checking on each other's health (esp mental health) and trolling each other. We haven't uhhhh played a game yet cus she's busy-busy (so am I) but I plan on asking her to do so sooon, maybe today or sumn since her pc broke and I can lure her to mobile games lmfao

  
BUT LIKE I can't help but wonder if she's like this w/ all of her friends?? Esp since avoidants are never reallyyy direct (my ex was an avoidant too) idk what if she's just doing it for the vibes? lmao

  
SIDE NOTE: She does have this friend that she plays games with and kinda knows irl who's a fellow (to me) masc...I feel like this friend likes her (just my intuition lol she took her to the boxing ring knowing her body was sore from volleyball?  Just wanted a cheerleader ig? also asking her for updates i think)

Just my intuition again..maybe she's not telling me things and thats ok,,, but I'm quite unsure if my crush is interested? I'm leaning on no for now though cause I feel like she'll tell me if she did?



Now, about the hangout thing --

My parents are kinda controlling and all hahahaha esp towards me since I'm the youngest i'll actually just escape the house and she does know that...

It'll happen post prelims so..we'll be talking for around a month by then. Still pretty early imo tho.

  
I can technically pull the card that i'm kind of scared (partially true) cus it's traffic in her area, sometimes buses are full  + it's my first time going alone...and like maybe ask her to accompany me..?

  
Do note that  i'm not actually going there for her, I've been craving  this specific yogurt brand for like..4 months now and only the place in her area has it.. and they do have matcha toppings so i really want her to try itt! (hitting two birds with one stone!) 

It'll be fairly quick anyway, I don't even know if you can count it as a hangout... (Also because I don't think I can handle proximity for so long with her yet) 

  
SORRY THIS WAS LONG..FINALLY, MY QUESTIONS ARE 

1. Do I have a chance? 

2. Is it too early to hangout?

  
Thanks!!

Chapter 1 – Meat Town

Meat Town wasn’t about meat. That was the first lie every child in town eventually discovered, whispered on porches and muttered at kitchen tables. The name had no origin, or if it did, no one remembered it. Old maps bore the word Meat as if carved into stone, immutable and final. Strangers never visited, and residents never left. The town was a loop—a carousel of faces, streets, and endless routines. The lamps on Main buzzed all night, their light never quite reaching the center of the street. The air had a copper tang, sharp enough to sting the nose, like blood without a wound.

Isaiah sat beneath one of those lamps, his hoodie pulled up, thumb scratching along the edge of his nail until it peeled. He stared at the pale glow on the sidewalk and muttered, “Hunter, don’t you ever wonder why no one leaves? Not even for something simple, like groceries out of town?” His voice was flat, but his eyes flicked nervously toward the distance, where the road disappeared into the same stretch of horizon it always had.

Hunter shifted beside him, pulling at the cord of his sweatshirt. He didn’t answer immediately. The silence stretched, filled only by the electric hum of the lamp and the distant ringing of the church bell. When he finally spoke, his voice cracked as though someone else was listening. “I’ve tried, Isaiah. I packed a bag. Took the road past Miller’s farm. Next thing I know, I wake up in my own bed. Bag’s gone. Like it never happened.” He stared at his shoes, his breath coming shallow. “It’s like… someone resets me.”

Isaiah swallowed hard, his mind flickering back to all the stories whispered through town. People who claimed they had escaped. People who later turned up sweeping porches, hollow-eyed, swearing they never said such things. He tried to smile, but it came out crooked. “Maybe you were drunk, or high. You sure it wasn’t one of those nights?” The jab was half-hearted, a bandage over the unease that rippled in both of them.

Hunter didn’t laugh. Neither of them did anymore. The addictions they carried were quieter now, lurking like shadows waiting for a weak moment. But even in their sobriety, Meat Town felt like a cage. As they sat in the artificial glow of the streetlamp, both young men realized, without saying it aloud, that something in the town watched. Something that wanted them still, stagnant, and scared.

The silence thickened around them, heavier than words. The lamp above them flickered, buzzing louder, and Hunter swore he saw something move just outside its glow. A figure? A shadow? He blinked, and it was gone. But the unease lingered, gnawing at him. He muttered, “Maybe this place doesn’t just trap us. Maybe it feeds on us.” The thought hung in the air like smoke neither boy wanted to breathe.

Isaiah dug his nails into his palms, the sting grounding him. He had grown up believing in safe places—his mother’s kitchen, the quiet of the woods. But as he looked around now, even the houses felt wrong. Curtains hung too still, like painted cloth. Windows reflected nothing. It was as though the whole town was a set, and they were the only ones meant to notice. “Feeds on us how?” he asked finally.

Hunter shrugged, but his eyes betrayed the answer. “It keeps us weak. You ever notice that? Nobody here gets better. Nobody here… changes.” He gestured toward the rows of darkened houses. “Everyone just exists. Same jobs, same routines, same mistakes. Like we’re all relapsing forever, just in different ways.”

A chill sank into Isaiah’s chest at those words. He had promised himself that sobriety would mean progress, would mean something more than just not drinking. Yet here he was, sitting in a town that circled like a drain, dragging him down no matter how much he fought. He hated that Hunter’s words made sense. He hated it because it meant they weren’t just imagining things—they were right.

The bell tolled again from the church at the edge of town. Neither boy looked toward it. They knew, instinctively, that the sound wasn’t a call to prayer. It was a reminder. A warning. And though Isaiah didn’t say it aloud, he felt it deep in his gut: Meat Town was alive, and it wasn’t letting go of them without a fight.

Chapter 2 – The Addiction That Stayed

For Isaiah, sobriety was a chain. Every morning he felt the weight, the ache, the phantom taste of liquor in the back of his throat. He tried to drown it with black coffee and late-night runs, but the urge clung like mildew, thick and sour. Sometimes, the smell of gasoline at the station or the tang of iron in the air was enough to twist his stomach with longing. Meat Town didn’t soothe those cravings—it amplified them, like the entire place was designed to whisper just one drink, just one night, just one slip.

Hunter bore his own burden. He hadn’t touched a needle in over two years, but sometimes his veins itched as if they were begging for something. His skin would crawl at the sight of a pen, a nail, anything sharp enough to pierce. At night he dreamt of rivers filled with clear liquid, and when he woke his arms burned like fire. He told Isaiah that Meat Town felt like the inside of a relapse. “It’s like the town doesn’t want us sober,” he confessed one night as they walked past the boarded-up school. His eyes darted to every shadow, half-expecting them to move. “It wants us numb. Wants us quiet.”

Isaiah chewed on that thought for days. He began to notice that Meat Town thrived on silence. Arguments never escalated. Grief never boiled over. Joy never burst into laughter. Everything was muted, dulled, like someone had covered the whole town with a wet cloth. Even the sky above seemed to lack color. The clouds weren’t white, not gray—just heavy. Just still.

One evening, Hunter stopped mid-walk, staring at the rows of houses with their uniform curtains and neat lawns. “Ever notice nobody locks their doors? Doesn’t need to. Nobody here steals, nobody fights. Too calm. Unnaturally calm.” His voice cracked. “It’s like the town itself is medicating us.”

Isaiah nodded, though it chilled him. Sobriety was supposed to bring clarity, but in Meat Town, sobriety felt like trying to breathe through gauze. They were alive, but it wasn’t living. And deep down, Isaiah began to wonder if the addictions they fought had been placed inside them on purpose—just another way to keep them quiet.

They both carried chips in their pockets from old meetings in a neighboring county. Proof they had survived their worst days. Proof they were moving forward. But the longer they stayed in Meat Town, the heavier those chips felt, as though the town mocked them. They began to avoid holding them. Began to forget the pride.

Hunter admitted one night that he didn’t even remember when he’d last seen a meeting. Had the building closed? Had anyone else even left the town for recovery? He couldn’t answer. Isaiah couldn’t either. It was as though their fight to get clean had been erased the moment they crossed back into Meat Town’s borders.

“We’re not recovering here,” Isaiah said softly. “We’re just… suspended.” He didn’t want to say what they were both thinking: suspended in Meat Town meant suspended forever.

The next day, Hunter thought he saw a familiar face on the street, an old sponsor from years ago. He waved, but the man didn’t respond. He only stared, eyes glassy, before turning and walking into a house Hunter swore wasn’t there yesterday. When he ran after him, the building was gone, replaced with an empty lot.

As the days passed, they began to sense something behind that stillness. The silence wasn’t a natural quiet—it was enforced. A presence that lingered beneath the streets, whispering with the weight of relapse. The addictions weren’t memories. They were anchors. And Meat Town wanted those anchors sunk deep.

Chapter 3 – The Preacher

The church was the only building in Meat Town that breathed. At least, that’s how Isaiah described it. The windows were boarded, yet light seeped out at night, golden and unnatural. Every Sunday morning, the bell rang, but no one ever admitted to climbing the steeple. Isaiah and Hunter decided to attend one service, just to see if anyone actually went.

Inside, the air smelled of dust and mold. Wooden pews groaned under the weight of townsfolk who sat motionless, eyes forward. At the front stood the preacher—thin as a scarecrow, skin pale as paper. His smile stretched too long, teeth too many. His voice, when he spoke, cracked like an old record player. “The angel is coming, children. Best to stay clean when it arrives.”

Isaiah leaned toward Hunter, whispering, “What angel?”

The preacher’s head snapped toward them, though his body didn’t move. His pupils expanded, black as pits. He leaned forward with a grin that felt carved into his skull. “Not the kind you prayed to.”

Neither Isaiah nor Hunter stayed for the closing hymn. The congregation’s voices weren’t singing—they were buzzing, a low monotone hum that rattled inside their bones. Outside, the bell tolled again, though no one touched the rope. That night, the streetlights seemed dimmer, and Isaiah could swear he saw something shift in the shadows above the steeple.

When they reached Isaiah’s porch, Hunter lit a cigarette though he had promised months ago to quit. His hands shook so badly the flame nearly died before it touched the paper. “That wasn’t a sermon,” he muttered. “That was a warning.”

Isaiah didn’t argue. He had seen the way the preacher’s tongue moved, split down the middle like a snake’s. He had heard the hum rise higher until it sounded almost like a swarm of bees crawling just behind his skull. No man had spoken those words—not fully. Something else used him.

The next morning, Isaiah returned to the church alone. He found the front doors wide open, but the pews were empty. Dust clung to every surface. There were no footprints, no sign of a congregation at all. The only thing out of place was the pulpit, carved with a single phrase: “Stay clean.”

Isaiah ran his fingers over the grooves in the wood. They were wet, as though freshly cut. He didn’t stay long. By the time he returned to Hunter, the church bell was tolling again, though he hadn’t seen a rope, hadn’t seen a steeple at all when he looked back.

Chapter 4 – The Man on the Roof

That night, Hunter woke to the sound of tapping. At first, he thought it was rain, but the sky was clear. The tapping came again, deliberate, like fingernails on glass. He sat up in bed, heart pounding. His window was on the second floor. No one should’ve been able to reach it.

He pulled the curtain back just an inch. A pale face pressed against the glass—lips stretched in a smile too wide, eyes black and wet like tar. Hunter stumbled backward, gasping, and the face disappeared. He ran to the window, but there was nothing. The street below was empty, silent.

The next morning, Isaiah found Hunter sitting on his porch, shaking. His eyes were bloodshot, and his cigarette burned to the filter without him noticing. “It was on my roof, Zay. Whatever it is, it was crawling up there.”

Isaiah tried to laugh it off, but Hunter’s voice was too raw, too broken. “You’re telling me someone climbed your house just to stare in?”

Hunter shook his head. “Not someone. Something. It didn’t move right. Like it was being dragged up by strings. And its face—it wasn’t real. It was like a mask.”

Isaiah wanted to say he didn’t believe him. But deep down, he did. Meat Town had rules, unspoken ones. Don’t wander too far. Don’t ask too many questions. Don’t look outside at night. And Hunter had broken the last rule.

That evening, Isaiah climbed onto Hunter’s roof. He expected dust and shingles. Instead, he found deep scratches gouged into the wood, long and thin, like fingernail marks that had burned into the surface. Some of the grooves still smoked faintly, as if freshly carved.

When Isaiah touched one, the tips of his fingers went numb. For a moment, he swore he heard whispering—familiar voices urging him to drink, to drown, to give in. He yanked his hand away, heart racing.

Hunter called up from the yard, his voice cracking: “See? I told you. It wants us weak. It knows us.”

Isaiah didn’t argue. The scratches were proof enough. And that night, neither of them slept.

Chapter 5 – The Angel Arrives

On the fifth night after the church visit, the sky split open. Not with thunder or lightning, but with silence. The stars blinked out, one by one, until the sky above Meat Town was nothing but black. And from that black, something descended.

At first, Isaiah thought it was a storm. Wings spread across the sky, vast and endless, covered in eyes that blinked in unison. The creature didn’t fly—it simply existed, overlapping with the night itself. Hunter clutched Isaiah’s arm, whispering, “That’s it. That’s the angel.”

Its body was a wheel within a wheel, fire turning inward, light bending into itself. Voices spoke from every direction, layered, harmonious yet discordant. “Do not be afraid,” it said, though the sound shook the marrow of their bones. “Stay clean. Stay still.”

The townsfolk poured into the streets, but none screamed. None ran. They simply looked up with empty eyes, mouths moving in unison as they repeated, “Stay clean. Stay still.”

Hunter shook his head violently. “This isn’t an angel. This is a prison guard.” His voice trembled with fury. “This thing is keeping us here.”

Isaiah wanted to deny it. The creature’s light burned with beauty, with something that felt holy, but also oppressive. Every time he stared too long, he felt the old cravings rise, like the angel itself was dangling temptation before him.

The angel’s wings brushed the rooftops without touching them, and every window lit up with a sickly glow. For a moment, Isaiah swore he saw his old bottle collection inside his childhood home, lined neatly, waiting for him. He blinked, and it was gone.

Hunter grabbed Isaiah’s shoulders. “Don’t look at it too long. That’s how it keeps us.”

They tore their eyes away, but the angel’s presence lingered. It didn’t vanish when the sky lightened at dawn. It stayed, unseen but heavy, as if watching them from just above the edge of vision.

For the first time, Isaiah and Hunter both knew: Meat Town wasn’t just cursed. It was being policed.

Chapter 6 – The Demon Beneath

If the angel ruled the sky, the demon ruled the ground. Isaiah first sensed it in the sewer grates, a smell like rot and sulfur seeping upward. At night, the streets pulsed faintly, as if something beneath the pavement was breathing.

Hunter was the first to hear it. A voice slithering from the drains, promising relief, promising escape. “One taste, one night, one slip. You’ll feel better. You’ll be free.” Hunter nearly believed it, his hands trembling as he hovered over the grate, sweat dripping down his face.

Isaiah pulled him back, shouting, “Don’t listen!” but the voice slithered into his ears too, warm and tempting. It sounded like his father, offering him a drink on the porch. It sounded like every moment of weakness, wrapped in comfort.

The ground beneath their feet cracked one evening, and from it crawled shapes. Twisted figures with hollow eyes, jaws unhinged, bodies built of smoke and shadow. They whispered in unison: “Stay dirty. Stay numb.”

Isaiah and Hunter ran, but the demons didn’t chase. They only crawled back into the earth, leaving the street cracked and smoking. The town patched it overnight. By morning, there was no sign anything had happened.

Hunter paced Isaiah’s room that night, frantic. “We’re stuck between them, Zay. The angel up there keeping us still, and the demons down here trying to drag us under. That’s why no one leaves. It’s a tug-of-war, and we’re the rope.”

Isaiah pressed his hands to his ears, but the whispers seeped through anyway. “Drink, Isaiah. Just one drink.” He wanted to scream.

The battle wasn’t for their souls. It was for their weakness. The angel wanted them sober but stagnant. The demons wanted them wasted and broken. Either way, they were trapped in Meat Town forever.

That night, Isaiah whispered to Hunter, “We have to pick a side… or we’ll never leave.”

Hunter didn’t answer. His silence was answer enough.

Chapter 7 – The Town That Pretends

By now Isaiah and Hunter were convinced every face in Meat Town was a mask. At the diner, the waitress smiled too long, eyes too empty, hands never trembling even when pouring coffee onto cracked plates. At the hardware store, Mr. Collins stood in the same spot for hours, never blinking, never shifting his weight.

Hunter leaned close one afternoon and whispered, “They’re not people anymore, Zay. They’re placeholders. Just puppets to keep the town looking normal.”

Isaiah wanted to dismiss it. But that night, he saw the truth. His neighbor, Mrs. Kellerman, stood on her porch for six straight hours, motionless, staring at the sky. When Isaiah stepped outside, her head rotated too far, bones bending without breaking, until her eyes met his. She smiled, and her teeth stretched thin and sharp like glass.

The next morning, she was back to normal, watering her plants as if nothing had happened. Isaiah didn’t wave. He didn’t dare.

Hunter grew more restless. “We’re the only real ones left. The angel and the demons—they drained everyone else. Left them as props so we wouldn’t notice.” He dragged his fingers through his hair, voice shaking. “We’re living in a stage set, Zay. A fake town for a real prison.”

Isaiah couldn’t disagree. The more he looked, the more he saw it. Streets never cracked. Grass never overgrew. Mailboxes never rusted. The entire place was too clean, too staged. Even the clouds hung like wallpaper, never shifting.

One evening, Hunter dared him: “Throw a rock at one of them. Just one.” Isaiah refused, but Hunter didn’t. He hurled a stone at Mr. Collins outside the store. The man didn’t flinch. The rock hit his head, split skin, but instead of blood, thick black smoke hissed out.

Mr. Collins smiled, smoke curling from his mouth, and whispered, “Stay clean.” Then he walked away as though nothing had happened.

Hunter turned to Isaiah, horrified. “They’re not alive. They’re… actors. Meat Town is one big cast. A creep cast.”

Isaiah felt bile rise in his throat. The town wasn’t just a prison—it was a performance. And the two of them were the only audience left.

Chapter 8 – The Relapse Trap

The temptations grew worse. Hunter began finding syringes left on his porch, capped but gleaming. Isaiah found old whiskey bottles in his closet, full though he had smashed them years ago. Every night the whispers grew stronger, urging, coaxing, demanding.

Isaiah nearly broke one evening. The bottle glowed faintly in the dark, and he could smell the burn of whiskey before he even uncapped it. His hands shook as he lifted it, glass cold and perfect in his palm. He imagined swallowing, the warmth spreading, the quiet bliss of oblivion.

Then Hunter slapped it out of his hand. The bottle shattered, but no liquid spilled. Instead, smoke poured out, curling upward into a face that laughed before dissolving.

“It’s bait,” Hunter growled. “The demons bait us, and the angel lets it happen. They want us dangling forever between clean and ruined.”

The next night, it was Hunter’s turn. He found a syringe on his pillow, gleaming in the moonlight. He sat there shaking, whispering, “Just one. Just one.” His skin crawled with phantom itches, his veins screaming.

Isaiah snatched it away, hurling it into the street. It burst like glass, spraying black fluid that hissed into the dirt. The smell of sulfur filled the air until both of them gagged.

They realized the town was cycling them through relapse and recovery, over and over, like rats in a maze. Every craving, every temptation was manufactured, planted, engineered.

Isaiah whispered, “They don’t want us healed. They don’t want us ruined. They want us stuck in the middle. Forever addicted, forever clean.”

Hunter buried his face in his hands. “That’s worse than hell.”

And Isaiah knew he was right.

Chapter 9 – The Escape Attempt

They decided to test the borders. At dawn, they packed what little they could carry and walked to the highway leading out of Meat Town. The road stretched straight and flat, disappearing into the horizon. For the first time in weeks, hope sparked in Isaiah’s chest.

Hours passed. The horizon never changed. The sun stayed pinned in the same spot above them, never shifting. When they turned back, the sign for Meat Town was only a few yards away. No matter how far they walked, they never left.

Hunter screamed, throwing his backpack into the dirt. “We’re trapped on a treadmill, Zay. A damn treadmill!” He sank to his knees, sobbing, fists pounding the pavement.

Isaiah pulled him up, trembling. “Then maybe it’s not the road. Maybe it’s us. Maybe we’re the ones chained.”

That night, Isaiah dreamt of the angel’s eyes, each one reflecting his face, his failures, his cravings. In every reflection, he was drunk, broken, wasted. The angel whispered, “Stay clean. Stay still.”

Hunter’s dreams were worse. He dreamt of demons climbing out of his veins, chewing their way up his arms, whispering, “Stay numb. Stay gone.” He woke screaming, clawing at his skin.

By the third day, they were too weak to try again. The road out was an illusion. The town was a circle with no edge.

They sat on the curb outside the diner, staring at the lifeless cast of neighbors moving through their empty routines.

Hunter whispered, “We’re never leaving, are we?”

Isaiah couldn’t answer. He feared saying it aloud would make it true.

Chapter 10 – Long Story Short 🤭😜

The end came quietly. Not with fire or screaming, but with silence deeper than any before. The angel descended one last time, wings blotting out the sky, eyes weeping blood that never touched the ground. The townsfolk knelt as one, voices humming.

Isaiah and Hunter stood defiant. They refused to kneel. The angel’s voice filled the air, layered and endless: “Stay clean. Stay still. Stay mine.”

Hunter shouted back, “We’re not yours!” His voice cracked, but it echoed louder than the angel’s chorus. For a moment, the wings faltered, the eyes blinked out of sync.

Then the ground split, and demons rose like smoke, whispering, “Stay numb. Stay broken. Stay ours.” They clawed toward Isaiah’s legs, teeth gnashing, but he stamped them down, heart racing.

For one impossible moment, both forces clashed. Light and shadow pressed against each other, and Isaiah realized the truth: they weren’t enemies. They were partners. The angel and the demons were two sides of the same cage. One kept them sober, one tempted relapse, but both ensured they never escaped.

The truth broke something inside him. He fell to his knees, not in worship, but in despair.

Hunter grabbed his shoulders, shaking him. “Listen to me, Zay! This is their trick. They can’t keep us if we don’t play the game. We don’t have to pick clean or dirty. We pick free.”

Isaiah blinked through tears. For a heartbeat, he believed. He rose to his feet, screaming into the sky, “We’re done with you!” His voice cracked the silence, and the world itself seemed to shudder.

The angel’s eyes wept harder. The demons hissed louder. But for the first time, neither touched them. Neither held them. The town grew darker, like a stage light shutting down.

When I should initiate a uhhhh sort-of-not-really-hangout/date,"F 18 anxious, interested in F18 avoidant lmfao (tale as old as time but I think....we're pretty healthy individually, personally im working on it)

I'm gonna have tomatoes thrown at me but all of this is happening online howeverrr !!!11 she is like, one bus away lol (also she has a car)

Ive been casually trolling this girl (as a joke ofc) for around 2 months now? maybe 3? We crack jokes and all. It wasn't until, maybe 2 weeks ago that I messaged her privately. This is so embarrassing but yea yea we were in a fandom of some sort. I messaged her  about a gc and overall, wanting her to b e more well versed in the content since she's a grass toucher lol

Here's some of our convos if you want to guess with me if I have a chance (otherwise just skip)

She actually thanked me that same morning, was very surprised I took the initiative to reach out 

I offered to create her a list and caught her up in gossip, we talked about life and stuff and she ???  asked me if she can buy me coffee ??? 

HONESTLY I WOULDVE GOTTEN LOVEBOMBER VIBES and I don't want to definitively say she isn't but, i'm gonna reach here with my intuition and say I felt nothing but giddy that day HAHAHAHAHHA.

Somehow our convos went to like her avoidant tendencies tho (I have no clue why and how) but like I later realized she was a middle child (i'm the youngest) and yk the lack of attention lmao... she kinda backtracked a bit actually HAHAHA I think she just got excited, she's a very independent and adventurous person and isnt really expressive so like she has her own little ways

One night I couldn't message her and SHE CHECKED ON MEE, I thought it was gonna be the type of convo where we dont reach out after awhile cus we kind of just gotten closebut nooo she was looking for me and stuff  #omgbruh 

WHEN I FINISHED COMPILING THE READING LIST AND GUIDED HER HOW TO USE THE SITES (this was like kind of,, maybe a week in idk, it was long and I designed it : \])  SHE TOLD ME I moved like a player and that i made her feel giddy !!11 then spammed me that night abt like, life stuff while I was doing sumn,, IT'S SO/?? Is this as big as i think it is #holyshit 

She jokes a lot about the friends to lovers trope tooo!

  
Other than that it's really just checking on each other's health (esp mental health) and trolling each other. We haven't uhhhh played a game yet cus she's busy-busy (so am I) but I plan on asking her to do so sooon, maybe today or sumn since her pc broke and I can lure her to mobile games lmfao

  
BUT LIKE I can't help but wonder if she's like this w/ all of her friends?? Esp since avoidants are never reallyyy direct (my ex was an avoidant too) idk what if she's just doing it for the vibes? lmao

  
SIDE NOTE: She does have this friend that she plays games with and kinda knows irl who's a fellow (to me) masc...I feel like this friend likes her (just my intuition lol she took her to the boxing ring knowing her body was sore from volleyball?  Just wanted a cheerleader ig? also asking her for updates i think)

Just my intuition again..maybe she's not telling me things and thats ok,,, but I'm quite unsure if my crush is interested? I'm leaning on no for now though cause I feel like she'll tell me if she did?



Now, about the hangout thing --

My parents are kinda controlling and all hahahaha esp towards me since I'm the youngest i'll actually just escape the house and she does know that...

It'll happen post prelims so..we'll be talking for around a month by then. Still pretty early imo tho.

  
I can technically pull the card that i'm kind of scared (partially true) cus it's traffic in her area, sometimes buses are full  + it's my first time going alone...and like maybe ask her to accompany me..?

  
Do note that  i'm not actually going there for her, I've been craving  this specific yogurt brand for like..4 months now and only the place in her area has it.. and they do have matcha toppings so i really want her to try itt! (hitting two birds with one stone!) 

It'll be fairly quick anyway, I don't even know if you can count it as a hangout... (Also because I don't think I can handle proximity for so long with her yet) 

  
FINALLY, MY QUESTIONS ARE !

1. Do I have a chance? 

2. Is it too early to hangout?

1n3qkjy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n3qkjy,Bone System Strengthener,"It is very common that over time, our bone system loses strength, and tends to become porous and fragile. This occurs in both men and women, although in women this process is more frequent and notorious, which is known as **osteoporosis**, and as the word indicates, it is the condition of porosity that they acquire the bones, and that is because they lose density, they become weaker, making them more susceptible to fractures and injuries.

  
Although osteoporosis is a widely spread disease, I believe that it can be prevented and even lessen its severity; and this is achieved through a healthy diet and exercise. There are also pharmaceutical calcium supplements, which protect the bone system, however, they are unpleasant and I believe that over time they can cause side effects (this is my opinion, very personal).

  
And since I like natural medicine so much, and I always try to use it to prevent and heal diseases (avoiding the use of allopathic medicine as much as possible); t oday I have brought you a preparation that is a **strengthener of the bone system**, which gives us an additional dose of calcium that is very useful in the prevention of osteoporosis. This preparation is very simple to make, it only requires that you have the ingredients that are cheap. I consider that two of the three ingredients can be found throughout the planet, only the third element would be a little more difficult to obtain, since it is a native seed from South America, (or at least from Venezuela); however, I will share the recipe with you, which may be useful for many of you.



Previously, specifically in my second post on Hive, I intended it to talk about this seed to which I refer, which is known as **Black Brusca** (Cassia occidentalis L.), because it is a plant that I grow annually in my plot and I sell the seeds in my house. I cultivate it for several reasons: It is a honey plant, especially for cigarrones (Xylocopa); on the other hand, some birds known as azulejos (Thraupis episcopus), also like this plant very much; and additionally I use it in my diet and I also sell it.

# THE RECIPE

**Time, ingredients and equipment**

* Preparation time: 10 to 15 minutes.
* 4 tablespoons of pumpkin seeds.
* 1 tablespoon sesame seeds.
* 1 tablespoon of black brusca seeds (Cassia occidentalis L.).
* Resulting amount: That will depend directly on the amount of seeds you use. A greater quantity of pumpkin and sesame seeds is always used for palatability, since the black brusca is somewhat bitter.
* Salt to taste (I used half a teaspoon).
* A cauldron or frying pan, strainer, blender, plates or cups, a spoon, a sterilized glass jar.

# PROCEDURE

The procedure is very simple. First of all we have all the ingredients and utensils organized and available, in order to make the preparation quickly. In this case, I used the seeds that I extracted from a pumpkin to make this fortifier, so it was necessary to wash and drain them.

  
Once the pumpkin seeds are clean and drained, I proceed to toast them over low heat, taking care not to burn them. I do the same with the sesame seeds and the black brusque. While pumpkin and sesame seeds are easy to tell when they're roasted, brusca negra isn't, because they're a dark brown in color. We will know when they are ready, when they give off a smell similar to roasted coffee and begin to explode like popcorn, at that moment they are ready.

  
When they have cooled down, I proceed to grind the pumpkin seeds in the blender or processor. Later I add the sesame seeds and brusca negra, as well as the salt (this is optional), to continue grinding until a homogeneous mixture is obtained.

  
The texture of this preparation is similar to that of a thick powder, it is not very fine. It must be stored in a sterile glass bottle and kept at room temperature, without direct incidence of sunlight. The flavor is exquisite, because it has a marked taste of nuts. This time I only used salt to add flavor, but you can also add ground cumin and oregano. The way to consume it is to add it to meals, for example, I don't consume butter or margarine, so I use it in my breakfasts to fill my arepas. I also sprinkle broths, soups and rice with this preparation. Delicious! And it has the great advantage of being a super provider of calcium, since all its ingredients provide this important element for our health.

  
I can tell you that here, where I live, the doctors specializing in the bone system (traumatologists), when people suffer fractures or undergo surgery on bone tissue, recommend the daily intake of brusca negra, which must be roasted and ground before being ingested, thus the recovery is faster, because it accelerates the appearance of scar tissue. It is generally recommended to consume this fortifier alternately, that is, 15 continuous days (once or twice a day), a month-long pause, and then its consumption is restarted. It is highly recommended for people after forty years of age, when the bones begin to lose density.

""You’ve smelled it. You’ve emailed us about it. A lot. Like… a lot, a lot. We’ve been packing prototypes of Tome¹ into orders for months.

Great Vibe on the day, but until the area is built up more it's probably going to be ghost town.

Despite it being a miserable tropical Melbourne winters day, there was lots of people milling about. There was even ""street entertainers"" out the font. 

It's difficult to do the space justice with still photographs, but the look overall is fresh and warm, I feel. Oddly there seemed to be  only 1 ticket window? I could be wrong and am happy to stand corrected on this.

All the 'features' both architectural and artist are great, although some of the art embedded on the platform  floors was hard to spot and possibly won't handle the foot traffic too well moving forward. I love the lighting fixtures, and the skylights even on a shitty day like today were bright.

The platforms are long! There is ample room around the platforms on the tunnel, almost it seems wide enough for another line. There are PIDs everywhere. I must add though the Shark tweet or fins or whatever they're called didn't really catch my eye as I waked in so I'm o=not sure how a casual user of the space would see them as useful way finders?

I was surprised by the amount of unfinished parts there were in the station. And of course some larrikins had left graffiti in them. I didn't noice any spaces set aside for retail but maybe that's just me.

Out the back of the station was a huge video screen running a time lapse and video of the construction of the station. There were also food trucks, offering doughnuts, coffee, pizza, and other food and drink.

So all up a cold yet pleasant morning wandering around and soaking up the atmosphere of a station that is sure to go gang busters eventually. I even spotted the person who narrates the Metro shorts, on YouTube, [here](https://youtu.be/-yR_gIPWIPs)

Remote App Tester BOOM Just Changed the Internet—Are You Witnessing This Revolution?","Has anyone else woken up absolutely FLABBERGASTED at the sheer number of companies wanting remote app testers in 2025? 

I mean, I was minding my own business, scrolling through job postings with a lukewarm coffee, then BAM—every other posting seems to scream: “WE NEED MOBILE APP TESTERS - APPLY FROM YOUR COUCH!”  

Like—wait, when did this all happen?? Did I sleep through a tech hiring REVOLUTION? Because I’m shook.

Here’s the jaw-dropping part: so many of these companies don’t even care if you’re in your pajamas. They just want real people testing out apps. Some are even begging for total beginners. If you can tap ‘download’ on your phone, there might already be 2 recruiters waiting in your inbox.  

Let me break down 10 legit companies that made my brain do a double-take:

- **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** (Honestly, if you haven’t checked this one, you’re missing out. I’m still not sure it’s real, that’s how good it looks.)
- UserTesting (This one is classic, but now rolling out new mobile gigs… what!?)
- uTest (I’ve seen people get PAID just to crash apps. Hello??)
- Test IO (Did not see this one making the “big remote flex move” in 2025, but here we are.)
- PlaybookUX (It says ‘UX’ but surprise, there are straight-up test gigs all over here now.)
- Applause (Anyone else seeing a salary SURGE? Something is going on here…)
- Appen (Previously for voice data, now suddenly obsessed with mobile QA?)
- TryMyUI (Had several listings this morning just hanging around begging for testers.)
- BetaFamily (Testing apps WHILE you play with them? This can’t be legal…)
- **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** (Yeah, repeating this. It stares at me in my sleep. Am I hypnotized?)

This is NOT just gig money either. I’m seeing posts showing testers making hundreds a month, totally flexible, fully remote, while keeping their day job or school schedule. It’s changing so fast!

But here’s the twist that had me nearly spit out my coffee (again): Most of these places aren’t asking for fancy degrees. Some just need you to, you know, use a phone and give HONEST feedback. How has this not been a mainstream SIDE HUSTLE hack until now??

And for the conspiracy theorists among us, try visiting **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** (no, seriously, link #3 because my disbelief grows every click). The incentives are wild—coupons, digital gift cards, cold hard cash, and more!

TL;DR: If you ever wanted a shot to break into tech, make some mobile magic money, or just be able to say “I TESTED THAT APP” in future convos, the universe just handed it to you.

Check **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** for good karma—or a wardrobe of pajamas that finally pays your rent.

Who’s already in on this quietly booming trend? Have any of you TESTED for these before? Can we trust these wild offers, or am I walking into a Matrix-level simulation?

I’d heard rumors that working remotely was getting even EASIER, but this? Next level.
I went down the scariest, rabbit-hole-deep web research spiral and... NO JOKE, these companies will literally *pay you* to play with apps and give feedback. WHY wasn’t I warned?! Where’s my cut? 😂

Here’s what’s even weirder: a lot of them don’t even expect you to have tech skills. If you can click, swipe, and type, *bam!*—you’re hired (almost).

 🟢 **Here are 10 companies that are going wild hiring mobile app testers REMOTELY in 2025:**  

- **UserTesting** – The OG. Why did no one tell me I could get paid for my opinions?!  
- **Testbirds** – Literally bird-themed and flying high with app gigs.  
- **Applause** – They want applause... and they also pay decently for it!

Here’s Why This Freaked Me Out:

- Zero “tech bro” energy required.

- Global positions—doesn’t matter if you live in Antarctica or Cleveland.
- Some sites, like **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**, want ANYONE with an opinion!

I just gotta ask: Why are more people not shouting this from the rooftops?! Are we collectively sleeping on this opportunity or is there a secret mobile tester Illuminati I didn't get the memo for?

Honestly, if I find out my neighbor is cashing out while all they do is test the latest shopping app in their slippers, I might just lose it. 🫠

If we’re going to make a change in this industry, this sub is the place it can start. Most of the big providers *do* allow a BYO finance option, but they don’t exactly go out of their way to advertise it.

So, I’ve put together a new BYO Finance Comparison Calculator to make it easier for people to see:

* What sort of savings are really on the table
* Where the hidden extras usually creep in
* And how their current quote stacks up against a BYO option (IE. Worth the hassle or not)

👉 Link: [millarx.com.au/redditnl](https://www.millarx.com.au/redditnl?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  It called the BYO Finance Calculator

Full transparency:

* Full transparency:
* Yes, this tool carries a commercial bias, the fixed effective rates shown are what I can actually do for millarX clients.
* But it’s also built as a one-stop shop for anyone asking: “Where can I get a BYO novated lease?” → Right here.
* It’s completely free to use.
* This is still in test phase, and I’m opening it just to the sub for now, not the public

What I’d love from you:

* Try it out, see if it helps you cut through the murk.
* Let me know if it’s useful, and what changes or improvements would make it better.
* If it’s valuable, I’ll refine and polish it. If not, it stays a basic coffee-fuelled prototype.

At the end of the day, the more transparent tools we share here, the harder it becomes for the old-school players to keep things hidden.",3,1756520714.0,NovatedLeasingAU,2,0.8,False

Anyway, a couple of weeks ago I got her number and we started texting. I plucked up the courage to ask her out on a date and we met up yesterday afternoon for a walk and a coffee. Everything seemed to go pretty well for the three or so hours we were together (the conversation flowed, we were laughing and joking quite a bit, there was lots of open body language and eye contact, etc), then when we went to say goodbye the whole thing ended incredibly abruptly. We walked to where I was catching a bus (her car was parked just over the road) and as I told her it had been a great afternoon she practically dashed towards her car with scarcely a look in my direction and a cursory ""Yeah, see ya"" kind of response. It sounds almost comical, but I'm utterly confused why this was as it wasn't as though it went badly or I acted inappropriately or anything. I don't know if it was anxiety on her part (I know she does have anxiety issues from previous conversations), but I'm confused where to go from here. Is it worth texting to thank her for a lovely afternoon and keep the line of communication open, or letting her message me when (or if) she's ready? If she's not interested then that'll be a blow, but I'd accept that; it's just the mixed signal that gets me.",0,1756520457.0,dating_advice,1,0.5,False

1n3q4g7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1n3q4g7/did_i_miss_the_red_flags_confused/,Did I miss the red flags?!? Confused!!,"So I started dating this guy about two months ago. When we first went out, everything was amazing — we had a great first date, connected deeply, and started hanging out multiple times a week. The connection felt strong and real, and he mirrored that back to me. As time went on, he told me how much he liked and cared for me, and I felt the same.

Around the 2 month mark I noticed some hesitation on his end. It felt like he had deeper feelings but was holding them back. He would get close to saying something more, then pull away. Then he started saying things like “I like you so much it scares me” and “You’re too good to be true.” In my experience, when men start framing things that way, it can be a sign of fear and insecurity, which often doesn’t end well. I reassured him as best I could without focusing too much on it, but I noted it as a concern.

We also had a light conversation about him having past issues with jealousy and trust. He told me he’d been cheated on before, and that he’d cheated once himself. I mentally flagged that as a possible issue but tried to stay open.

A turning point happened after a night out. I got home around 2:30am and didn’t like his text until 3:30 because I don’t like to text when I’ve been drinking (he doesn’t drink, so I didn’t want to introduce that dynamic). The next day he confronted me, saying my story didn’t add up. He implied I must have been with someone else because bars close at 2 and I hadn’t texted until later. I explained, reassured him, and told him I wasn’t comfortable with “proving” where I was, all I could do was tell the truth, to which he agreed. He dropped it, said he felt better and we moved on.

The following week was great... he was affectionate and open — but then out of nowhere, I felt a shift. He was super off with me and at first wouldnt say why. then finally he admitted he was still bothered about that night. He brought up random things he made note of over the past week like ""evidence""...like two coffee cups in my trash, or that my hair didn’t look wet after I’d said I was showering before FaceTiming. He was basically insinuating he didn't believe my story again and that I was with someone else, which wasn’t true. I told him he either had to trust me or not, but if he couldn’t, this wasn’t a healthy foundation. He got upset and said I was “flipping it on him.”

The next day he texted me (coldly) that we shouldn’t date anymore, blamed my communication, and ended it.

I’m left confused. On one hand, I saw some avoidant behavior and red flags with trust/jealousy. On the other hand, we had such a good connection and communicated SO WELL in every other way (including disagreements), and the way he ended things was so harsh compared to how close we were. It really hurt, especially because I cared a lot and thought he did too.

So…what do you think? Did I miss the writing on the wall? Was this fucked from the start because of his jealousy/trust issues, or was there something I could have done differently?

The halls of the UCV buzzed once again, arguments spilling like cigarette smoke through every faculty corridor. Dark coffee sweetened the debates, while cheap empanadas turned bitter with each retort. Two years had passed since the fall of the regime, and though no one mourned its demise, few agreed on what it meant. For some, it was a national liberation, proof that Venezuelans could rise against a system propped up only by foreign patrons. For others, it was a failure — the squandered chance to break once and for all from a post-colonial order. What had collapsed was not just the regime but the last scaffolding of socialism in the mainstream. In its place, students warned, would come an ""Americanized"" Venezuela: hyper-consumerist, hyper-productive, trading its leading role among South American nations for a back seat in the ""West.""

The debate was not a new one. Opposition to the regime had always carried the mark of class: born from the wealthy middle class, staffed by university graduates, flanked by the small and large bourgeois, and often reinforced by sympathetic officers in uniform. They were, in the eyes of the Venezuelan left, the traditional enemy, the mirror image of the country’s poor, Black, and Indigenous majority.

Chávez himself had broken that pattern. He was no pale heir of privilege but a mestizo soldier, son of teachers, his charisma drawn from cadence and relatability. His rise was meant as a correction to history, a rebuke to the old mold. By contrast, his predecessors in power, Carlos Andrés Pérez and Rómulo Betancourt, though not dynasts, carried their own contradictions. Both had been outsiders once, even prisoners of the same political system they would later inherit. Yet all three, despite their ruptures, shared a telling constellation: middle-class roots, a closeness to the intelligentsia rather than the masses, and a whiteness — real or at least passable — that fit comfortably within the long shadow of Venezuela’s racial hierarchy.

The first rebellions against the regime had been, unmistakably, oligarchic. In 2002 it was the oil executives, flanked by the broader bourgeoisie, who shut down the pumps and paralyzed the nation in a general strike, a strike that cracked open just enough space for a coup. For one day, Chávez was gone, toppled by generals and shareholders alike, before clawing his way back to Miraflores.

Five years later, in 2007, the protests came not from boardrooms but from classrooms and newsrooms. Thousands of students and journalists flooded the streets, rallying against the tightening noose around independent media. Their chants filled plazas, but their victories were short-lived: licenses revoked, signals cut, frequencies reassigned.

By 2013, the opposition’s hopes carried a surname of pedigree. Henrique Capriles Radonsky, heir to one of Venezuela’s largest media conglomerates, tried to turn electoral defeat into a fraud narrative. He failed. Lacking proof, he watched the crowds thin and the wider population, exhausted and skeptical, drift back to survival.

A year later, in 2014, the students were back on the streets. They marched against inequality and insecurity and were met by the full force of the State. Violence was no longer an exception — it had become doctrine. The classrooms, once a fortress of Chavismo’s intellectual defense, had turned hostile. There was no way to win them back; they would have to be silenced in blood.

Bassil Da Costa was the first to fall. Just 23, a scholarship student who had fought his way into a private university. Without that scholarship, the trip from Guatire to Caracas would have been impossible. He was no scion of the establishment, no heir of privilege; he was a child of the working margins, the very people who carried Chávez to power.

By 2017, the collapse was undeniable. Supermarket shelves stood empty, breadlines stretched for blocks, looting flared with each blackout. Students marched again, some no longer students at all, joined this time by the poor. Together they clashed with riot police and colectivos. A hundred would die, thousands more were wounded. It would prove to be a milestone for the opposition. It no longer represented the shrinking Venezuelan middle class, but all of Venezuela. Clashes intensified not only in Chacao, a bulwark of the ""old"" opposition, but at the UCV, Plaza Venezuela, and La Candelaria.

The last intellectuals loyal to the regime quietly stepped aside. Some fled abroad, others retreated into silence. With corruption and violence now the only arguments left, even they could no longer defend Chavismo with a straight face. The regime, however, endured.

By 2019, it was no longer the opposition confronting the State but the opposition tearing itself apart. Juan Guaidó’s “interim government” collapsed under its own contradictions. Inside, factionalism raged, and the Alacranes poisoned what remained of unity. The old opposition did not fall at the hands of the regime, but at the fangs of its own.

The opposition now faced a reckoning. It had to reform and look inward. Many of its old leaders and emerging figures had suffered a fate worse than death: infamy. Once celebrated, they were now reviled for their perceived weakness in confronting the regime.

The movement needed new men, new procedures, and new ideas more urgently than ever. In this light, 2024 loomed not merely as an election year but as a crucible, an opportunity, however twisted, to reshape the opposition.

Across the country, autonomous movements that had survived the worst of 2024 and 2025 began to coordinate, quietly at first. They were students, workers, and the marginalized, hardened by years of loss, yet sharpened by experience. Where once the middle-class opposition had faltered, these new forces were unbound by hierarchy or inherited prestige. They had no patience for old allegiances. They needed no one’s approval to act.

2026 arrived, and the weight of years had become unbearable. A regime built on violence and corruption, sustained by greed and fear, finally began to falter. The streets, once rigid with control, now simmered with opportunity.

# And what do we think of it?

Inside the opposition, there were always two camps: radicals and moderates. The radicals had long warned that the regime could never be toppled through ballots or negotiations, only by force of arms. Their warnings came even before the authoritarian mask slipped fully, before elections became rituals without meaning. To them, every march, every failed dialogue table, was proof of what they had been saying all along.

The moderates, meanwhile, clung to the idea of a political settlement. They were lawyers, activists, and career politicians who insisted that legitimacy was their greatest weapon. If Venezuela was to rejoin the democratic order, they argued, it had to be through peaceful, constitutional means. But as the regime grew more repressive, their credibility began to erode. Their caution was read as cowardice, their pragmatism as betrayal. In the streets, where blood was shed, moderates no longer had the same standing.

Ideology further complicated the divide. Conservatives had opposed Chavismo from the beginning, not only for its authoritarian excesses but because its very foundation threatened their worldview. They saw it as a socialist experiment destined to collapse. The progressives, however, had once cheered parts of the project. For many on the left, Chavismo’s promises of equality and empowerment resonated, at least until the economy crumbled under corruption and mismanagement.

Both camps, unsurprisingly, had starkly different interpretations of the regime’s collapse. For the radicals, the fall was vindication. They openly welcomed American intervention. To them, it was not only a strategic necessity but almost a rite of passage — the price of joining the West. Among the more *particular* voices in their ranks, it was spoken of as a kind of cleansing, a purging of everything “backward” that Chavismo represented.

The moderates, by contrast, framed the fall in nationalist terms. For them, it was not Washington’s triumph but Venezuela’s own revolution — a popular rejection of the status quo that Chavismo had crystallized. They looked not toward the North Atlantic but toward South America, where they argued the meaning of the struggle would resonate most. In their telling, the collapse was proof of the region’s capacity for democratic renewal, and its lessons should be measured in terms of social justice and reform.

# Symbols and Nomenclature.

By the time the regime collapsed, the moderates had already lost the ideological battle. Their language of dialogue and gradual reform, once appealing to the exhausted middle classes, had been overtaken by the raw urgency of the streets. 

The roots of this radical culture could be traced back to the student organizations of 2017. They had carried the protests when food vanished and tear gas filled the avenues, and from those desperate marches came the first icons of defiance. Santiago Croses and blue armbands were amongst the most popular.

The FVA inherited these symbols but pushed them further. Their banners were raised in the ~~Fall~~ Liberation of San Cristóbal, where, for the first time, an urban uprising briefly tipped the balance in favor of the resistance. Seeking legitimacy, a new symbol for the ~~Uprising~~ ~~Rebellion~~ ~~Revolution~~ organization, General Larrazabal addressed the nation with a new flag behind him. It was called the *revolutionary tricolor,* a flag of yellow, blue, and red, each stripe equal in width, with three white stars at the center.

It was an improvisation made from the flag the State, simplified for production. FVA soldiers needed a way to differentiate themselves from regime troops. Still, the design grew in popularity. It was simple, easy to make and eye-catching. The FVA even decorated their tanks and trucks with it during their entrance to Caracas and raised the tricolor atop the Miraflores Palace.

Time will tell if the flag will stay or not. Regardless, the symbol seems will stay. Guns replacing white hands. In the meantime, students and professors at UCV will continue their debates.",2,1756520377.0,GlobalPowers,0,1.0,False

1n3q2ml,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1n3q2ml/a_strange_pattern_of_disconnection_showing_up/,A Strange Pattern of Disconnection Showing Up After Taking My Friends to Get Bra Sized,"Putting the TL;DR here because it's a longpost: every time I feel I'm losing a friend to disconnection, I (subconsciously it seems) reach out by taking them to get their bra's sized and then they never text or reach out after (so far).

Okay, so, this isn't really an ""I'm feeling lost and need advice with the state of my friendships"" post, it's more a rant about my placelessness in a group dynamic that has been hard to keep alive on my end because i'm more offline now, and also a strange pattern that i thought was both hilarious and kind of sad: It involves getting measured for accurate bra sizing of all things. 

Preface: I've recently been trying to disconnect from social media and having a very active online presence--i don't like the hours wasted on my phone, it makes me feel stagnant, unproductive and also kinda boring; to combat this, I've been making more space for old school hobbies, I'm more active in my day to day, training to run a 10 marathon, and I prefer to read during down time, or go to the movies, or wire essays on any new topics/books/articles I've read up on. When the weather's good and I have enough money for things besides bills and my bouldering membership card, I try to plan spontaneous dates with friends where we go to museums, concerts, new bars, or even go swimming (basically I grew tired of everyone around me--including myself--feeling inadequate, tired, overworked, and unattractive/physically unfit compared to social media personalities; I wanted a change and tried to encourage everyone around me to do more diverse activities together besides playing co-op video games or gatcha farming games, those things that all bridge us into interactive settings but also still require screen time; there was also a sense of tension during this time because, as I was disconnecting, they weren't, and as I was experiencing a greater ease with finding more things to appreciate in the moment or be joyous about, or finding topics of conversation to keep attentions sparked--i subscribed to a print newspaper to have things to talk about, I saw films regularly, I read books, discovered new coffee places without using Google maps or any review based app, I constantly invited them to join me for a hangout at any of the activity centres I went to, etc; to which none ""vibed"" with or cared to try--there was still the underlying issue of everyone else--to an extent--struggling with occilating attention spans: that pendulum of always needing to look at your phone and not being able to have a conversation for longer than 5 minutes). 

So given the context, I either fall into the category of obnoxious friend who probably reads too much into seeing someone get more excitement from their phone than from me, sitting across from them, or I've just fallen into the category of some who has... lost connection with my friend group because I've disconnected from technology. It really sucks because one of my best friends is on that group chat, and I sorta made the group chat to introduce all these friends to each other, and we really hit it off and would spend time together. I'm not saying I'm the ""best friend to have, ever!"", I struggle with depression and OCD tendancies that can sometimes make me prickly, to put it mildly; I've noticed an abundance of technology usually messes me up more--whether it's the dopamine levels issue or just generally feeling isolated sometimes, tech is usually the thing that sets me off balance if I'm on a procarious edge. Anyway, I first disconnected by deleting Snapchat because it messed with my mental health and made me question self-worth a little. Not in a... oh, do I matter? Kinda way, but more like, I'd always get excited by a notification and then become immediately disheartened as soon as I realise no one wanted to ""speak"" or ""say something"" to me, they were just keeping their streak. And once I left the group chat, I tried to plan things with each member old school: SMS and phonecalls. But we all work (we're in that weird mid-way of past early twenties but nowhere near where TV said we'd be approaching our mid thirties) or have school, so obviously it was hard to plan stuff because people were either tired, spending time with their partners or didn't get back to me. Usually I always reached out, but I accepted it at first as being ""comeuppance"" for leaving the group chat--where communication is more instantaneous. 

Anyway, not to get into too much drama, but I started drifting from one friend in the early stages of my disconnect more than others because I was getting fatigued by her constant self-criticsm and negative anecdotes during most of our hangouts. We fought and in an attempt to open lines of communication and see if we could hangout without buffers or distracts around us, I planned an outing with her; I decided to take her to get ""fancy"" bras--something I'd been planning to do with her since she started complaining about back pain from her bras. The bras are not really fancy, they're just not cheap so I offered to go halves and only took her during sales; they are both durable and pretty (I'm one of those annoying people that loves to share in a good product when I find one because I know how life changing the right pair of shoes or a perfect fitting bra with no padding can be for posture and comfort!). Anyway, after she got sized and bought a pair and posted online about how much a good bra could help with back posture and neck pain, she thanked me and then never reached ot to plan another date. (I'm the kind of person who, if I plan a hangout or teach out, I appreciate if you do the next round. When she didn't, I assumed she was done with me, so I didn't reach out either). 

Now, fast forward a bit: I reach out to one of the friends I considered a best friend. I tell her I miss her and that I'm hurt by the fact that I'm the only one who's ever trying to plan an outing for us, or asking how she's doing or trying to see what fun activities we can do. And even though she said she missed me too and wasn't actively ""not reaching out"", I still wound up being stuck in the same cycle--except when she'd invite me to group activities, like her birthday celebration. (I obviously showed up for it, and made sure to leave all my baggage at the door, I won her prizes at the skiball mini games! But after that weekend, again, no outreach from her end to hang out with ""me"", alone, sans a buffer or group activity, like we used to do). During this time, I noticed everyone's Bitmoji would always pair up or be in vicinity of each other, and sometimes this would happen after I'd tell her I had the day off that week if she wanted to hang--usually she'd forget this, and I was okay with that, but one day I actively invited her to join me in the park, where I'd be reading and drinking a beer for a few hours to enjoy the sun, and she said she couldn't because she'd be tired from work and would go home, then, an hour later, her Bitmoji is with another friends, and I teased her about going out for cocktails with one of our friends when she was supposed to be resting, but then I realised that wasn't what I wanted to say, and tried to express that I was rather hurt she didn't think to even check if I was still in the city, nearby, and willing to join them. She said it wasn't intentional, that she forgot, and then it hit me: thinking about me wasn't an intent. That's how it came off. I was now this friend that annoys you to hang out but who you don't consider or think about as soon as we stop texting. That's probably not how she meant it, but that's kind of worse. To contextualise why this hurt me: I have a freakishly good memory for conversations; if you tell me something about yourself, an story from work or something new hobby, I'll remember it 9/10 times. I got used to my friends not having the same memory, often having to listen to their stories again and again and pretend they're new--to a point. I'm used to people spacing out when I talk about things I'm passionate about because I have ADHD and can talk for eons about the things I love or the whacky facts I keep stored in my brain. I'm a large personality at times, and sometimes I like being taken seriously, but I also know the attention span issue, the phone addiction issue, so I often tried to brush off a ""huh?"" or ""I don't remember this"" or that brief period of silence where someone checks their phone because it's not on silent mode (which my phone is always on, I don't understand the need to always be aware of a notification or update or email, but that's also because I've been an assistant before, I've handled a social media account for a company before--i know how overwhelming having 3 emails and a bajillion software update notifications is like). Suffice to say, the reason I deleted Snapchat was because I hated being aware of everyone's position relative to my own and yet never get asked to join any of them when they bundled up. After this, I try to take her out on the town, but it didn't feel right. She had a bad day, was late to our dinner and I told her to go hkome and rest; I was gonna have a drink by myself instead, I'm usually okay with doing things on my own--as I've had to be, otherwise I'd never do anything besides be on my phone or watch TV or play video games or go to work. I think she felt bad because she decided to hang out with me, but something was off. We both had one drink each, but she didn't feel present. I can't explain it, but it was like trying to connect with someone in detention but they've got narcolepsy! (I know she was probably feeling bad for being an hour late to our dinner, but I'm used to everyone being late to everything, so it didn't bother me as much--it bothered me more that she deprived herself if sleep to hang out with me, but in a way that wasn't fun for either of us really, if I'm being honest). Some good did come of it. She got to rant. I told her about some fun stuff I'd been doing, and I got to try a new restaurant. She tells me she has back pain from her bras too. I get an idea! You might see where this is going...

Then silence again. My birthday comes and goes. Everyone gets the date wrong because my social media accounts have the wrong birthday (a fun joke I run with, one of my accounts says I'm like 80 years old!). Some don't message me, some message me on the wrong date because the app reminded them, and some only message me after I send the obligatory ""thanks for the birthday messages"" message.  (I decided not to stay in the city because I knew no one from the group chat would try to plan something with me and I didn't want to reach out first; it was my birthday, I wanted, again, to be thought of first, not to be a response you can rsvp to). I plan a date a week after, when I know it'll sting less and I'll be more open. Lo and behold, the same bra place has a sale, and just like the friend before, I take her to my trusty bra and lingerie shop. She gets sized. We go halvesies. She finds the bras cute and comfortable. Then, again, no reach out. Except once, when she asks me if I want to join in on a surprise party at 11am for one of the friends in the group chat. That's when I realised, again, that I was simply not ""worth"" the same inclination to be considered as the others were to her. More context: whenever I'd plan a brunch or a park date or anything that took place between 10am-12pm, without fail, every time, people would either not turn up because it was too early, or would arrive late. Always. Once had a brunch go cold for almost 2 hours while we waited for everyone.

The reason Im typing this out instead of trying to sleep for my early shift at work today, is: I passed by another of the group chat friend's' workplace and he told me about the surprise party. He, too, who is always unavailable because he's either working or lives too far out to be tempted to come to the city, went. Yes, the party was important. And I was asked to be a part of it. And I'm glad they were there for each other, but it's odd trying to reconcile the fact that, my relationship to these people revolved around the ease and convenience of a group chat and a snap chat streaks ""game"" to stay relevant. If I don't do the reaching out, I'm forgotten. One of them asked me, in annoyance, when I told them I wasn't ignoring their snaps, I had deleted the app and sent out a notification beforehand, that he didn't know how to reach me. Mind you, he has my phone number. I have his. I sent him an SMS after I said my goodbyes and grabbed the train. 

 Point is, even though it wasn't intended, everyone seems to show up for every other member of the group chat during scenarios that, if they occured during a moment I asked of something, were otherwise regarded as these huge hurdles to get past, but we're relatively a simple ask if it was someone else asking.   

To end on a less somber note: I keep my life moving despite these set backs. I put myself through a summer intensive language course. I'm doing a wine course. I have a writing blog and I write poetry and paint when I can. I have other friends who actively seek me out, randomly, of their own volition, because they thought about me in the moment. I have sports hobbies that can sometimes keep me off my phone and out of my head for a while half a day. I recently saw Materialists in the theatres, by myself, and loved it. I am reading an amazing book by Nawal El Saadawi and ordered my next read, a book by Akala. I'm currently on a mission to find a second hand cd player because I found Skunk Anansie and The Corrs CDs for cheap at a record store I've always wanted to walk into and finally did! And I can now clear 7km at a consistent pace, which leaves only 3km left on my 10k mini marathon dreams. Small strides. And yet, it's still sad. I'm mourning the disconnect from an entire group of friends. But c'est la vie. Though, maybe for next time, if I feel myself drifting apart from a friend who complains about back pain and wears bras, I'll just say ""huh?"" and stare like they spoke to me in french or something.",1,1756520236.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False
