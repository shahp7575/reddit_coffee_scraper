Feel free to leave a review. Criticism is accepted as I am an amateur writer, and I would appreciate the feedback. Thank you for reading.

Note: This story takes place on the perspective of a civilian outside of Kivotos, so there wouldn't be too much mentions of Blue Archive students

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's been weeks now ever since the scandal of about the daughter of the owner who is supposedly the next successor of Saint Nephthys Company turned out to be a scumbag who not only betrayed their teacher for a handsome man, but apparently she committed several crimes like attempted murder, assault, destruction of private property and whatnot. The incident has been such a juicy scandal for journalists to cook and milk everything they can from the situation for attention, a quick buck or whatever reason they had. Even when the teacher who has been living in hell because of the students returned to Kivotos, journalists would do whatever they can to get a scoop out of it.

*(Sighs)* ""Don't these blast journalists ever get tired? I've been interviewed by the same journalist for 3 days now! I'm starting to think he might be targeting me on purpose, should I file a harassment case?""

""Oh come on, you have good looks, any man would do whatever trick they have in their sleeve to be able to talk to you!""

""Shut it! You know damn well I have a standard for my dream man!""

""There to you again with the high standards, you should learn to be realistic""

The two female workers laugh, it's been a long day after all and everyone needed their well deserved break, especially now that their office was starting to stink of sweat. While many of the workers were able to head home despite the constant pestering of the journalist and media outlets, it was the poor managers who has to stay behind and deal with the issue of PR management. Some of them hasnt left the building for weeks, too busy with the constant calls and apologizes they're doing, reaching the point they ask their subordinates to buy them food from outside while they bath in the restroom with make do equipment.

""It's been a long week, why won't these journalists go to Kivotos instead? Pester the teacher? Why us out of all people""

""Hey, cut him some slack, he's been falsely accused of r@p3, blackmail, sexual harassment and whatever false accusations thrown at him without basis. If anything, he deserves a break more than us.

""I guess you're right, and to be fair, he did survive that 6 months of hell of being starved, kicked, dehumanized and running away from people who want to kill him.""

""And entire schools with guns too... It's crazy how he survived that long when he can just be popped to the ground dead by some long range shooter.

""Everybody- look, what we're experiencing right now is nothing compared to what he experienced. In another week or two, the media will grow tired of this and eventually drop the topic.""

The workers give each other a tired laugh, trying to ignore their own manager on the other side of the room, desperation etched in his voice.

""I- look- we're doing what we can to investigate the issue, we are- no! Please! We already have plenty on our plates! We can't afford to lose another stockholder-! ....I understand, on behalf of the Company, we respect your decision, and we sincerely applogize for the mistrust you see on the company""

The manager with a shaky breath, sighs as she puts down the telephone before rubbing her temples.

""This is not good... Another stockholder is pulling their investments out from the company, claiming that they can't trust us anymore after the incident of Kivotos and the Izayoi daughter... Damn her! If she just used her brain than spreading her legs for cheap thrills, we wouldn't be in this mess!""

""Calm down department head Keichi, take deep breaths and keep your head cool. Pointing fingers is not going to help us with our situation""

""Sorry chief, it's just that... Damn it... How could she be so stupid? Choosing her own lust over logic? I can't even fathom how much that teacher is feeling, all those hardwork and memories just to be discarded like a lollipop stick? It just makes me sick.""

""All of us feel sick from it, which is why we have to keep moving to distract ourselves so we wouldn't waste time on hating someone, learned that from my anger management classes. Hah!""

""Sorry to burst your bubble, but that's not what's happening right now. The media all around us, business partners cutting ties, stockholders pulling out their investments and other corporates refusing dialogue with us is literally making us remember what she did.""

""I... Can't argue with that.... Ok you win, I'll give you a beer later.""

The company workers chuckle, despite telling themselves that they can work through this, it was getting harder not to blame Nonomi Izayoi, the daughter and supposed successor to the company. They know her, she's visited them in the past, checking up on them and offering a helping hand as training for the future when she becomes the new company president. But now, all of those were nothing more but memories, their opinion towards her was now altered in a way that could never be changed. They no longer saw her as the once helpful and kind girl that would help them in the officer by offering to give them coffee, scan papers, or take their job of shredding documents. All they saw in her was a scumbag who willingly threw away her teacher who helped her in times of need and repayed him with ungratefulness because she couldn't control her lust. Despite their opinion on her, some office workers still held on to the hope and belief that the girl they once knew is still there and it's not too late, they know they're fooling themselves, but they can't help it. Because without hope, they won't be able to function as a cog in a workforce, and if they can't function, they'll be replaced, and if they're replaced, they would be out of employment. They can't have that, which is why they delude themselves to have hope.

""Ok everyone! We had a long day, so let's call it quits for tonight and rest easy, me and the other managers will take care of the work here, so please be good little kouhais and head home and rest.""

Sighs could be heard around the office. They were aching to stop doing what they were doing and just head home to rest, many of the workers give their higher ups last looks of pity before heading out. They were going to remain and continue to control the situation which seemed more and more like a losing fight. Investors were calling them ""not trustworthy"" and pulling out left and right. Workers leave the building and is once more swarmed with journalists asking for an interview on their opinions. It took a lot for the workers to resist punching them in the face and breaking their cameras, they were already in hot water for simply being a worker for Saint Nephthys Company, they don't need to increase the heat further because otherwise it's their livelihood on the line. Once home, the workers sleep, tomorrow was a weekend so they're not going to work tomorrow, none of them intends to because for the past weeks, they've given their weekends to the company to help alleviate the damages done by Nonomi to its name, this time, they're staying home and just like on the bed and pretend this was all just a nightmare.

**(The next morning)**

...

*Ring-ring-ring ring!*

...

*Ring-ring-ring ring!*

...

*Ring-ring-ring ri-*

""What do you want?! It's 7 in the morning and I don't plan to go to work today!""

""No, turn on your TV""

""What?""

""Just turn on your TV, it doesn't matter which channel""

*Confused, the worker stands up and walks over to the living room where the let cat lies on the couch.*

""Heh, lucky bastard. How much I wish I can just be a cat, no work, no issues to think about. Just worry about what disgusting food your owner gives you.""

The TV is turned on and much to the worker's surprise, it was the owners of the company they work it, the Izayoi Family, there was going to be a scheduled press conference on 10AM, all of them wearing business suits for later, the daughter, Nonomi had a bandage over her cheek. Many questions pop one after another as the worker attempts to understand the situajton. Was she hurt? Did her parents hit her? Will rival companies take advantage of this? The worker shakes those thoughts aside as they prepare coffee and breakfast. The cat meows and they laugh.

""Understood you little scheiße, I'll give you breakfast first, because the almighty omnipotent who works and buys all the food you eat is a slave to a you who will destroy my home if I don't do anything.""

*(Opens a can of tuna)*

""Damn it... just this once, I'll give you something fancy since we're out of cat food""

The worker opens a can of expensive tuna and the cat immediately perks it's ears from it before jumping off the couch and waits on its food bowl. The cat usually waits until the food is on its bowl, but today, it was patiently waiting like an eager kid waiting for chicken nuggets.

""Eager today aren't we?""

The worker laughs as he gives the cat it's tuna. It was an early Saturday morning after all, so why not do something for a change? The worker puts on their shoes before heading out for a morning jog at a nearby park. For once, it felt nice, not being chased by data hungry journalists and just embracing the cold morning air in the park. Spotting a nearby playground, they decided that why not? Do some exercises on it. The worker does pull ups on the monkey bars, and does push-ups and planking on the hard sidewalk, people were also going out for a morning walk or jog, so a few people joined in on his exercise. After an hour or so, he decided that he's had enough for the morning and heads back to his apartment. The cat was sleeping, it's face happy from it's expensive feast, with a chuckle the worker closes the door and cooks himself the breakfast he deserves, starting with coffee and a plate of bacon and eggs with a side of cake from the other night. While cooking, he looks at the clock and noticed that it's now 9:50AM, perfect timing, he could eat breakfast and watch the public press conference. It takes a few minutes for their breakfast to finish cooking and the coffee to stop boiling before he finally sits on the kitchen table and turn on the TV. The office worker couldn't help but feel a twinge of pity for the owners as they watch the apology of the Izayoi Family. None of them were at fault, yet here they are apologizing for the actions their daughter caused. As the worker eats his breakfast, he continues to watch the TV, the family then spoke about saying that they failed as parents because they didn't supervise their own daughter on her actions. As the media journalists shoot them with question after question, the blame ultimately falls on the daughter and Highlander Railroad Adademy (HRA). She was expected to be the next successor and showed herself to be unable to trust by others. The student council was also blamed for the actions of all of HRA because they failed to report the incidents to the higher ups of the Saint Nephthys Company, implying that the company doesn't know any of it until the news about sensei returning did they learn the extent of the damages.

As the press conference continues, the worker who was now washing the dishes if their  breakfast listens as the Izayoi Family disavow their own daughter. Nonomi was the next successor, but she wasn't an employee of the company, meaning she was being thrown under the bus by her own parents.

""While our daughter was the next successor, she has shown herself incapable of such position. And her actions does not represent Saint Nephthys Company because she is not an employee, most of her actions are of her own individual doing, including the students of Highlander Railroad Adademy.""

The worker stops before slowly looking at the TV, she could see the face if the daughter, full of despair, guilt and acceptance of her situation. The worker knew that Nonomi deserves to be punished, but this... this was just too cruel, making them feel bad for her as the owners on TV speak about severing ties with HRA and showing their intention to pay compensation for the teacher Nonomi hurt and many others, including repayment of every terminated contract Saint Nephthys had with Schale because of the incident. And all of this said out loud on live television as well...

""Damn... that's... just messed up... being forced to acknowledge your sins and crimes for all to see... And on TV too""

The worker sighs as they finish putting the last plate onto the plate rack to dry. They step outside the balcony and lights up a cigarette, they would be turning up their resignation letter on Monday, after all the stuff he had to go through on this company, this felt like a wake-up call for him to leave and find a new job before things go even worse. They already have a new company in mind and has a resume for it. With a nod, they take an inhale of the burning nicotine stick before heading back inside to continue his life. Because after all, life doesn't wait for others, it goes on, leaving those stuck in the last behind, and the worker has life goals too, he can't stay in the past and loathing about a company scandal.

1kdnxpw,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthTrendz/comments/1kdnxpw/my_comprehensive_review_of_yourbiology_collagen/,My comprehensive review of YourBiology Collagen+ (4.5/5 Stars): Is this the best marine collagen with multi-vitamins?,"I give YourBiology Collagen+ a solid 4.5/5 stars. As someone who's tried over a dozen collagen supplements over the years (from powders to pills to liquid shots), I've become pretty discerning about what actually works versus what's just clever marketing. This one genuinely impressed me.

## What Makes YourBiology Collagen+ Stand Out

The first thing I noticed was the quality of the main ingredient. Unlike many collagen supplements that use cheap bovine sources, [YourBiology uses Naticol® Marine Collagen](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/ybcollagen.php) from fish, which my body seemed to absorb much more efficiently.

If you've tried collagen before without seeing results, this higher bioavailability marine collagen might be the game-changer you need.

What really sets this apart from other collagen products I've tried is the comprehensive formula. Instead of just throwing collagen in a tub and calling it a day, they've included 10 targeted **ingredients that work synergistically:-**

Based on some data from people I recommended it to (including some clients I coach):s-

- **Marine Collagen**: Within 3 weeks, some noticed fine lines looking less pronounced
- **Hyaluronic Acid**: My typically dry skin stayed hydrated much longer throughout the day
- **Vitamin C**: This boosts your natural collagen production (something many brands overlook)
- **Biotin**: Some of my clients’ nails stopped breaking and splitting within the first month
- **Magnesium & B12**: I experienced a noticeable energy boost, which was an unexpected bonus

## My Experience

In my first month, the changes were subtle but noticeable. By week two, my chronically dry skin felt more hydrated and bouncy.

By week four, some people I recommended it to who complained about hair shedding had it reduced significantly, and their nails were growing stronger without the brittleness.

The most impressive result came around the 8-week mark form one client who commented that when the nasolabial folds around her mouth (those annoying smile lines) appeared visibly softened. Her husband actually commented on it unprompted, which is when we knew it wasn't just wishful thinking on her part.

If you're dealing with early signs of aging, dull skin, or brittle nails, I'd recommend giving this at least 60 days to see the full effects. The changes happen gradually, but they're definitely real.

## How It Compares to Other Collagen Brands

Having previously tried popular brands like Vital Proteins and Ancient Nutrition, I found YourBiology to be superior in a few key ways:

- **Taste**: Unlike the fishy aftertaste in many marine collagens, both flavor options (Mixed Berry and Lemon & Pineapple) are genuinely enjoyable. I actually looked forward to drinking it.
- **Texture**: It dissolves completely with no gritty residue. **I've tried** [**Great Lakes**](https://amzn.to/4c7EjHT) and Sports Research collagens that left a sandy texture, but this blends seamlessly into my morning smoothie or even plain water.
- **Formula**: While [**Vital Proteins**](https://amzn.to/4lnkS2e) **offers** just plain collagen peptides, YourBiology's added vitamins and minerals address overall skin, hair, and joint health from multiple angles.
- **Results**: My clients saw more dramatic improvements in skin's elasticity and nail strength than with Ancient Nutrition's Multi Collagen, which they had used for 6 months prior.

## Where It Falls Short

No product is perfect, and I want to be completely transparent about the drawbacks:

1. **Price Point**: It's definitely at the premium end of the market. However, considering you're getting 10 active ingredients versus just plain collagen, the value is still there.
2. **Not Vegan-Friendly**: Since it uses marine collagen, this isn't suitable for vegetarians or vegans. If that's you, you might want to look at **Ora Organic's plant-based collagen** booster instead.
3. **Limited Flavors**: While both flavors are excellent, having more options would be nice for variety.

## Who Will Benefit Most From YourBiology Collagen+?

If you're like me and have tried other collagen supplements without impressive results, this formula might be worth the upgrade. I would especially recommend it if:

- You're in your late 30s or beyond and noticing fine lines, crepey skin, or loss of firmness
- Your hair is thinning or your nails break easily
- You experience joint stiffness, especially in the morning
- You want a one-and-done collagen with multi-vitamin supplement that addresses multiple beauty concerns
- You're willing to invest a bit more for quality and comprehensive ingredients

I would not recommend this if you're looking for an overnight miracle or if you're on an extremely tight budget. This is a premium product that works gradually over time.

## My Daily Routine

What worked best for me was mixing one scoop with cold water first thing in the morning (I prefer the Mixed Berry flavor). It became part of my morning ritual – I'd drink it while checking emails, then follow with breakfast about 30 minutes later. The subtle energy boost from the B12 and magnesium was perfect for starting my day.

Some days I'd mix it into my smoothie instead, but I found taking it on an empty stomach seemed to maximize absorption.

## Bottom Line

[**YourBiology Collagen+**](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/ybcollagen.php) **earns its 4.5/5 rating** by delivering noticeable results across multiple fronts – skin elasticity, hair strength, nail growth, and even energy levels. Is it the cheapest option? No. But is it worth the investment if you're serious about addressing age-related beauty concerns? Absolutely.

If you've been disappointed by other collagen supplements or want to simplify your routine with one comprehensive formula instead of multiple products, I'd highly recommend giving YourBiology Collagen+ a 60-day trial.

With their money-back guarantee, you can see for yourself if it works as well for you as it did for me.

## What is YourBiology Collagen+?

## Key Ingredients and Their Benefits

It’s a blend of **10 proven nutrients** that work together to support **skin, hair, nails, joints**, and **overall vitality**.

**1\. Naticol® Marine Collagen**

Sourced from sustainably harvested fish, this collagen is a game-changer. Why? Because it’s **highly bioavailable**, meaning your body absorbs it much more effectively than other collagen types (like bovine).

If you’re dealing with **wrinkles, sagging skin, or weak nails**, marine collagen helps restore elasticity, making your skin **firmer** and **plumper** while strengthening hair and nails. Plus, it also supports **bone density** and **joint mobility**..

### **2\. Vitamin C**

C**ollagen production** doesn’t just “happen.” Your body needs **Vitamin C** to trigger the process. This vitamin is like the best friend that makes collagen more effective by boosting its production naturally.

On top of that, Vitamin C is a **powerful antioxidant**, which means it protects your skin from **free radicals** caused by pollution, UV rays, and stress. If you’re seeing dull skin or fine lines creeping in, this is one ingredient you _really_ want in your corner.

### **3\. Hyaluronic Acid**

Ever feel like your skin is dry no matter how much moisturizer you slap on? Enter **Hyaluronic Acid**. This magical molecule acts like a **moisture magnet**, pulling water into your skin to keep it hydrated and **super supple**.

The benefits don’t stop at your skin. **Hyaluronic Acid** also **lubricates your joints**, making it easier to move without feeling stiff or achy. If you wake up feeling creaky or experience discomfort during exercise, this ingredient can make a noticeable difference.

### **4\. Biotin**

By adding Biotin to the mix, YourBiology Collagen+ helps you achieve that **silky-smooth hair** and **fierce, healthy nails.**.

### **5\. Potassium**

Ever deal with annoying **muscle cramps** or general fatigue? That’s where **Potassium** steps in. It’s an essential mineral that helps balance electrolytes, ensuring your muscles work smoothly.

Plus, Potassium supports your **vitality and energy levels**, making it especially important if you’re staying active or just want to feel your best as you age.

### **6\. Magnesium**

**Magnesium** is involved in over **300 processes** in your body. Yet, most of us don’t get enough of it through food alone.

In **YourBiology Collagen+**, Magnesium works to:

- Boost your **energy levels**.
- Support a healthy **heart**.
- Improve your **mood** and relaxation.

If you’re constantly tired, stressed, or sore after workouts, Magnesium can be a _lifesaver_.

###

### **7\. Calcium**

You probably already know how important **Calcium** is for your bones, but here’s the kicker: when paired with **collagen**, it’s even more powerful.

This is crucial for maintaining mobility and avoiding that “fragile” feeling that can happen over time. Think of it as the perfect partner for your collagen—working together to keep you **strong from the inside out**.

### **8\. Vitamin D3**

If you’re someone who doesn’t get enough sunlight (and let’s be real, most of us don’t), **Vitamin D3** is a must. It helps your body absorb **Calcium**, keeping your bones and muscles **strong and healthy**.

But here’s the best part: Vitamin D3 also supports **muscle strength**, which means less fatigue and better recovery after exercise.

### **9\. Chloride**

1kdnxpk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kdnxpk,Restaurant Zeik Hamburg (1 Michelin Star) - By Maurizio Oster),"This was my first time having dined in a one Michelin star restaurant. I was having a great experience! The first bites ahead of the first courses presented cabbage turnip in various ways with great focus on bringing out strong and savoury umami-flavours of it. - My favourite of it had to either be strong flavoured, delicious soup of cabbage turnip alongside the crisp with a fine mousse and smoked elements of cabbage turnip. This was followed by a delicious dish of tarragon hollandaise, Safran foam, dill and marinated fennel, just to name the most prominent ingredients. The bread course was straight forward with a nice rustic loaf of bread and some savoury herbal butter. For the next dish we were presented with different varieties of beetroot and a really exciting, superb „Mizuna mousse“ - fantastic! Following up was the carrot course, incredibly savoury and an utter explosion of carrot - literally the platonic essence of a carrot. This dish paired really well with a nicely aged Riesling and its acidity. The next course consisted of white asparagus with a beautiful texture, some crunch, a cream of hemp and some lardo - super interesting and utterly delicious. Up next was a fish dish of pickled char with an intensely smoked sauce and a fantastic and uplifting, really clean char tatar with an onion ceviche and fried buckwheat - nice textures. As for the next course we enjoyed a menu extension „The lamb - celebrated“: skewers of lamb, a lamb taco, a fragrant broth of lamb with mint oil, lamb belly, glazed jus and brioche of lamb shoulder - absolutely stunning and savoury all the way, but never too heavy or overpowering. This was was served with a German Frühburgunder, a genetically related grape variety Pinot Noir - lovely. Next: Lamb - again. But we didn’t mind, it was just too good: A delicate lamb flavour, very nicely grilled, beautifully pink. It was accompanied by a lamb jus, parsley jus, lemon zests and a varnish of apple and celeriac plus an onion reduction. Again, intense and hearty but also uplifting. The pre-dessert was made up of a sorrel sorbet, a vanilla-vinegar gel, and espuma of elderflower, kumquats and a ragout of mirepoix (?) - very acidic, but also very refreshing after the savoury lamb dishes - nice! The dessert revolved around rhubarb - a sorbet, a sauce, a ragout, a gel etc. for me, it was just a little bit too acidic and I had wished for something a little sweeter. Luckily, it was accompanied by some sweeter ice cream, some nut brittle, and a vanilla cream. All in all, the dessert wasn’t a disappointment but the weakest course of the menu, for my taste. The Petit Fours, however, were very much to my likings: a parfait of coffee and cardamom, a praline of vanilla and cheesecake, and, last but not least, a wild berry sorbet with parsley oil and rosé champagne. 

This was a great and absolutely delicious experience! I loved the creativity on the vegetarian dishes especially, good atmosphere in the restaurant, kind and warm service and a very good wine accompaniment. I recommend to give restaurant Zeik a visit. ",1,1746259922.0,finedining,0,1.0,False

I shouted at them and left mid-party(despite my friends convincing me to stay).As it was the first time, he was so consumed by the effect that I had to balance him towards the car.He was in no state to drive.I know how to drive the car though have never driven long distance.So I decided to take him to the my flat where I stay as it was much closer than his house.After reaching my flat I made him rest in my bedroom who was blabbering and rolling there(which I felt was cute).Then happened the worst possible thing I never thought I'd do.Before him I never was in any kind of relationship(as studies and building a good career was always my first priority).So with a man(who is my husband to be) in my flat and the alone moment with him clouded my judgement.I became physical with him while he was not in a good state of mind.I don't know why I did it.But it happened.There were moments I heard him say in a stammering tone,*""after marriage di..""* but I was too consumed by the moment and things happened between us.When he woke up he was so confused and we both couldn't see our faces properly.There was silence for a few minutes until he asked me about what happened.I couldn't able to tell him the truth.I lied that while drunk he initiated the physical thing and we ended up doing the deed.My fiancé was startled,then apologized,had a coffee and left within an hour.But I am the one who need to be sorry;not him.The guilt of hiding what happened is killing me inside.At the same time I fear about him remembering the actual incident and thoughts like,""What will he think of me if he remembers?"";""Will he think low of me?"",""Will it leave a dent in our relationship?"" etc., often pester me.So far he never talked about that day.But I really want to apologise to him,but I couldn't gather thr courage to reveal the truth.

1kdnwlm,https://www.reddit.com/r/McDonaldsEmployees/comments/1kdnwlm/i_feel_like_leaving_nz/,I feel like leaving (NZ),"Hi there, this is gonna be a long one, so thank you if you stick around till the end. I just started applying for new jobs today and although I haven't heard anything back yet, I am getting ready to write up a resignation letter to hand in once I do find a new job. But for now, I really need to rant this out with people who will understand my pains and struggles.

For context, I am a McCafe Barista/Cleaner of my resturant. My official title is McBarista, I am also the 2IC barista in my store, I work Mon-Fri 6am-2pm (best shift in my opinion)and I worked my way up for the past three years and gained the owner and RM respect and trust enough that they had me become the 'unofficial' cleaner.
-Our resturant was built in the 60s? And the original building was demolished and replaced around the 90s, and that is the building I currently work in. It has had many renovations over the years, including the most recent Lobby reno which I was present for, but in general we have what is considered an 'old' store. So sometimes the upkeep on things is a bit harder than in a newer built resturant.
-The owner I work under also only acquired the store 2 years before I started, so in total he has owned the Franchise for a little over 5 years now, that being said, we have only just gotten our staff under control, with a turnover rate of only 2 employees every 4-6 months. This is due to our younger staff who were in High School now leaving to study at University.

Okay now onto why I'm leaving.

Along with continuing to be a Barista My duties will also include FC & D-T bagging/Window Presenter and Lobby Host, I am expected to keep the Lobby(including windows, playland and meeting room) Toilets and certain parts of the back area (Beverage cell, second cafe, drive thru area and fc counter area) clean, (and I mean CLEAN like deep clean, looks like its never been used, this including the inside of machines like the Ice cream machine, coffee grinder etc..) This includes using electric scrubbing machines, steamers, magic sponges etc...
Now, mind you I volunteered to do this 'extra' work, because I enjoy cleaning things and I take absolute pride in my work and my workplace. I also understand that if I don't do it, either, no one else will, or they'll do it, but it'll look shit and be done with low effort.

Most of this work is done throughout the day with me alternating between cleaning and service, and on very rare occasions when it is quiet asf and I can be off floor for the entire day.
I am constantly having my customers compliment my work, including quiet days where I have blocked off areas of my resturant to get under tables that cannot be moved and scrape the gum off the underside, they have gone out of their way to tell me how much of a great job I'm doing. I feel so appreciated by the customers in my area (smallish town in NZ, so a lot of the same people come through every week).

For the last 2 years (about the time I started doing the extra cleaning jobs BEFORE being asked to do them as the unofficial cleaner) we have won awards for our store being the one of cleanest in the country. Everytime HQ comes through it is about halfway through my shifts, generally on a Friday or Tuesday, I have been complimented and congratulated by the representative for multiple things around the restaurant, including when I was only a small crew member, doing Batch and Grill products and was the only one to not get told off for something, I got a thumbs up fron the guy, no, like literally gave me a thumbs up physically.

However, the three years I mentioned working my way up to where I am now, was never actually awarded to me. It was begged for and forced to be given to me.

Our RM is still pretty new to being an RM, he started at the franchise the same time as the new owner taking over, if I remember correctly, he bought him from another McDonalds store in a different town that the owners daughter worked in. So within saying that, you'd think he would want to get training in as a priority, but sadly anything but, when I asked for my Crew Trainer book and course, it was promised to me for months and never given (he had it in the office he just couldn't be assed doing it with me, so he 'forgot' about it.)
Then when I actually got it, I was expected completely to do it at home by myself, no supervision, no training or oversight.
I had to Google it, and thank God for all yall in the USA, CAN and AUS because some of you guys put all the answers up with enough detail that I could learn what I needed by taking the answering and searching my workplace for things stuck up on the walls.
I then had to beg for a crew trainer uniform, so I could be taken seriously by some of the kids who wouldn't listen because 'you have the same shirt as me, so I don't have to listen to you' *eyeroll* bruh.
This continued for my Barista training as well, currently I haven't actually completed the official online training. I had to beg to be given a McCafe uniform because my Crew Trainer one was being ruined by the coffee grounds and milk spillage etc. (Our McCafe uniform tops have a different material -also this is just my store because we had a trial of different uniforms and although never implemented, we were allowed to keep them and wear them because our store did enjoy the look and feel of them compare to the other one)

Now, with all of this considered, you'd imagine at some point I would have been recognized by my bosses right? Employee of the Month? No.
People Month? (Dunno if that's an NZ thing or not) Nada, Zilch, Nothing.
Badges? (You guys get those? We do, cute wee little pins for your uniform) each one I have has been begged for because I was the best in an area by miles and everyone else thought so, but the RM that gives them out didn't think so until I begged for it.
General thanks or recognition when higher ups are coming? Nope, I get forgotten actually, I know how do you get forgotten when your somehow so important? I think it's because they don't have to stress about these things I do anymore, so they just generally forget that I'm there doing them, I'm quiet when not being spoken too directly, I don't generally like to start conversations as I'm autistic.

The cherry on top, that broke the champagne tower...

Just recently, past few days it was my birthday, and for some reason, it really got to me that this year, almost my entire store disregarded me barr a few people I'm very close too.
The Assistant RM, she loves any reason to make a big fuss, put up decorations, bring in baking etc... This year after all the really hard work I've done, and her knowing how much I sacrificed of myself outside of work for this business, did nothing for me, not even a message. 
Mind you, she's the one I go too about all my problems that may affect my work, so you'd think she'd be the one to do something for me, like she does for everyone else...

Anyways yeah, I think it just made me realise not only is my work under appreciated, but I really am as well.which is sad because they spent so long making me feel really great about myself in a personal way, that it overshadowed how I felt in a professional way... 
Is that the perfect representation of ""We're a family here"" that toxicity of, we love and take care of each other while also carving the knife deeper into your back each day?

Thank you for making it to the end, I appreciate any comments, advice or just stories of similar feelings that may grace the comments.

But I am a bit clueless, I was diagnosed with Schizoid Personalty Disorder, but from reports of my psychologist I might be misdiagnosed and I might be on the autism spectrum, Asperger probably, many people with Asperger are misdiagnosed with SPD. 

My psychologist says if someone doesn't have a direct and straightforward conversation with me I might misunderstand and take in offense what's said and even take action regarding this. This in the past caused me a lot of trouble. 

I had women interested in me in the past when I was younger, but most of the time back then I wasn't interested on those people, because of their attitude (those people remembered me of my mom and I don't want to ""marry"" my mom). 

I once had a girl asking me if I wanted to go out for a coffee, she was pretty and I was super into her, but took me more than 10 years to realize she wanted more than a coffee. People really need to be direct with me. 

Anyway my last relationship was a long distance relationship in 2021, but later she felt in love with someone else. 

What do you recommend me to do to find someone to get a serious straight relationship at my age? In Portugal the dating scene is not as developed as in another countries, people often have thigned groups and it's really difficult for someone to get a relationship outside of their groups. Also, and without offense to any woman, men in Portugal often find Portuguese women hard to get. There was even once a joke (again it was just joke) that said that Portugal was the women's ""Champions League"", meaning that Portuguese women are so hard to get that one could compare getting a woman in Portugal to play in the ""Champions League"". 

Just one quick thing I work remotely in a small town in Portugal, my salary is average but I am not rich. I normally can get a surplus of 400€ of money every month. But I am definitely not rich and this is because I live in a small town with a very small rent.

For the purposes of this post I'll refer to my ex as ""A"" , my girlfriend before her as ""B"" and our common gay friend as ""C"", they are also important to the story.

Long post ahead, there's many important details in the post so I'd appreciate it if you would read the whole thing but there's a TL;DR at the bottom.

#Context

I met A in the first year of university. Now we're in our second year. We're in film school, both of us in the film directing department, meaning we had to work togheter on a lot of our early assignments and exams. We became friends quickly and had chemestry. To be honest, I was really into her from the very moment I saw her, but the time I was in a 1 year long relationship with B and I'm not the type to cheat (also I was convinced A was 100% lesbian, she's bi).

A few months before the beginning of our second year of university I broke up with B. The relationship ended up being very unhealthy so we broke it off. I blocked her on everything.

A month and a half after the breakup C revealed to me that A really liked me, a week of talking and flirting later me and A ended up in a relationship. It's a little awkward to admit but C kind of acted like Cupid in this whole situation, if it wasn't for him I wouldn't even have considered A liking me since she was really bad at giving signs.

Right now C continues to be my wingman in this situation, since he used to be much closer to A than me for a while, but now he's closer to me because A hangs out with prople he dosn't like.

Me and A were togheter for 5 months and broke up a little over a month ago. I still love her a lot and she's the only thing I can think about.

#My depression and A's insecurities 

My depression and A's insecurities (which I found out about only yesterday, through a late night chat with C) were the primary issues that casued the breakup.

About 3 months into our relationship I started having depressive episodes again. I was having troubles going to university and working on uni work. When I told A about this she told me that I can ""be depressed after exam season ends"" and doubled down on that statement when I brought up that I didn't like what she said. 

My depression continued until recently, after the breakup, when I started getting better, but I never felt like I could talk to A about it, since she had a cold and dismissive attitude towards it.

I messed up *badly* when I couldn't help A with a common exam we had and ended up skipping that exam entirely.

Something that A really didn't like was that, throughout our relationship, I still had B's things in some boxes in my apartment. The reason I had them was purely logistical. I was still figuring out how to give her the things back, as B lives 12 hours away by car and I didn't want to unblock her to figure out how to give them back. I had no feelings left for B.

Yesterday, through that chat with C, I learned that A became extremely insecure and frustrated in a lot of ways. She thought I still had feelings for B (never knew about this) and was comparing herself to B lot. They are quite different in their style. A is more of a hippie chill girl while B was elegant and posh. I never found this to be an issue though and loved the hell out of A's quirks and style.

I also learned that A had the impression she was a rebound and that I stayed in the relationship with her just to not upset her. This was never the case.

#Before the breakup

Right before the breakup I had reached what I could call the peak of my depression. On a wednesday I stayed up all night since I couldn't sleep. On thursday I went to bed at 8 A.M. and woke up at 7 P.M. to 10 missed calls from A, she was extremely worried and pissed off. We decided to meed on friday. 

Friday I decided to do some university work I was heavily behind on so I called off our meeting and decided to meet on saturday. Another major mistake I had made. 

Saturday comes and A arrives at my place with a backpack of my stuff, that's when she broke up with me.

When we broke up I felt defeated. She said she wants us to stay friends as to not make things awkward in class and I genuinely thought she wanted that.

#After the breakup

After the breakup I tried my best to act like a friend to A and keep things casual. 

Yesterday I found out from C that A found that weird and expected me to fight more for her and our relationship.

Eventually A told me that talking to me hurts her so I stopped engaging with her entirely. I still felt her when she'd stare at me from a distance and could easily read her behaviour and body language (she didn't like what was happening) but I figured that that was just her proccessing the whole situation.

We saw eachother almost daily at university since our main film directing class lasts as long as 6 hours but I kept interaction to saying ""hello"" and ""goodbye"".

At one point she started hanging out with some girls she used to hate in the past, one of which used to have a crush on me. C knows A on a deeper level than me and says she's easily influenced like a child. He says the way she's acting now definitely has something to do with her new ""support group"", the girls she hangs out with, especially the one that used to like me.

#Two days ago

Two days ago I finally made up the courage to talk to A. I kept my expectations to a minimum and tried to be casual and friendly.

We skipped our last class of the day to go to a coffee shop we used to visit in the past. We spoke about how we've been doing and the whole thing ended up with her hugging me and initiating a kiss after which we we made out some more.

At one point she also confessed going to an orgy or something like that to try and forget about me.

That night we spoke on the phone and she told me she's actually not ready for us to get back togheter. She said that our relationship came after a a period of healing of hers and that, after the breakup, something in her broke and she dosn't feel like she can ""keep up with the rythm of a commited relationship anymore"".

It's clear that she dosn't really know how to handle the situation or what she wants either. I try to call and text her but she's very dry in texting.

#I want to fix this

I really want to fix this but don't know how to proceed. I love A and can't get her out of my head. Before meeting up with C yesterday I had a panic attack because all I could do was think of A and our breakup.

TL;DR: My ex's coldness and indifference lead to me not being able to open up to her about my depression and distancing myself. Because of this she started building up frustrations that she never told me about. She broke up with me 1 month ago after a 5 month long relationship. Our common friend has revealed a lot of things to me that she never told me about. I finally found the courage to talk to her 2 days ago after which she kissed mr which makes me want to fix things, but I'm not sure that's what she wants anymore because she said she's not ready to get back togheter.",1,1746259324.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False

Ready to see her rise?","Chapter 1

""Come on! Just kiss!""

""Don't be shy now, Casey. Isn't Andrew your first love you've been waiting for in the past five years?""

Casey Newton beamed amidst the crowd's teasing and kissed Andrew Lowell on her own accord.

I stood outside the door with my fists clenched, seeing red as I watched the scene unfold.

In my past life, I got into a minor accident on my way to this gathering. As such, I was completely unaware that this had happened.

I took a deep breath and pushed the door open. I looked at the kissing couple and coldly asked, ""What are you guys doing?""

Casey finally noticed me after getting nudged by her friend. There was no remorse on her face as she calmly replied, ""We're just playing a game. What are you doing here?""

She slowly removed herself from Andrew's arms as she spoke.

I let out a cold chuckle and sneered. ""Weren't you the one who asked me to come? Was it just to let me witness the intimacy between you and the other man?""

Andrew was offended by the way I called him ""the other man"". He grabbed Casey's hand and confidently said, ""You need to get something straight, Mr. Ranford—the person who isn't loved is the real other man here.""

Casey did not pull her hand away. Judging by her expression, it was obvious that she agreed with what he said.

I laughed bitterly. It was ironic how I was the one being labelled as ""the other man"" when she would be marrying me in ten days.

Casey had directed the same look of disgust at me in my past life. Back then, she had mocked, ""You're truly a useless doctor, Jace. Not only can't you perform a surgery, but now you're telling me you can't even write a thesis now.""

Later on, I finally came up with a groundbreaking discovery and wrote my thesis, yet Casey took my painstaking research and handed it to Andrew.

She even mocked me when I confronted her. ""You're someone who can't even hold a scalpel—you'd need someone to make your research a reality anyway. You should be thanking Andrew instead, Jace.""

What infuriated me even more was that after Casey got her hands on my family's fortune, she angered Dad so much that he had a heart attack. As a result, he abandoned the treatment for Mom, who was suffering from cancer.

The hatred within me surged when I recalled everything that had happened in my past life, almost overwhelming me.

Perhaps it was the coldness in my gaze that made Casey frown. For once, she softened her tone and said, ""Stop making a fuss, Jace. Don't be a wet blanket and just take a seat!""

Andrew glanced at her and smiled. ""See? I knew Mr. Ranford would get upset, Cass.""

He then continued, ""We're just playing a game earlier, Mr. Ranford. Please don't take it to heart.""

He walked over to pull me over, but I pushed his outstretched hand away without hesitation. My eyes were red as I yelled, ""Fuck off! Don't touch me!""

In my past life, all I wanted was justice to be served after my research was stolen. I started causing a scene at home and online, but the public opinion overwhelmed me to the point of suicide.

No one believed in me—they refused to believe I had the ability to write the thesis.

Casey and Andrew came looking for me when I stood at the rooftop that day. Andrew acted like he was there to save me, but as he got close, he reached out and shoved me off the roof.

I would never forget the smugness in his gaze as he looked at me. He said, ""Everything that's yours now belongs to me, Jace. Just enjoy your time in hell.""

I trembled involuntarily out of fury.

Andrew fell to the ground, hitting his head against the edge of the coffee table.

I had been staring at him, and in that split second, I clearly saw him turning his head on his own to hit the edge.

Blood started trickling from Andrew's head. Casey teared up and immediately rushed over to help him up, her heart aching as she gently wiped away the blood.

He smiled pitifully. ""I'm fine, Cass. You don't have to worry about me. I'm sure Mr. Ranford didn't do it on purpose—I was the one who lost my balance.""

Andrew was playing the same old trick again. Whenever we got into a conflict, he would always play the victim and put the blame on me.

But most importantly, Casey always bought into it. She unconditionally believed in everything he said. To her, I was nothing but a jealous, cold-hearted person.

My gaze turned cold as I spoke icily. ""Andrew was the one who deliberately fell on his own. I have nothing to do with it.""

Casey said, ""Would you cut that out already, Jace? Not only is your attitude so awful, but you're even trying to blame him. You'd better apologize right now!""

I listened to the way she scolded me harshly as she defended Andrew.

Smiling mockingly, I coldly replied, ""Let's just call off the wedding, Casey. There's no need for us to get married anymore.""",1,1746259052.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

I know I have a big heart, and it breaks. It's broken. 

17 years of holidays and birthdays and just because days that he never spoiled me on.  

17 years of arguing and being toxic, but my toxicity is frustrations.

17 years of raising five kids, whom are awesome but he's so damn rude to them.

17 years of wanting him to change into a better man. Quit being so rude to me, the kids and strangers alike.

17 years of keeping a house. Feeding the fam. Feeding the dogs and cats. Making his lunches. Getting coffee ready. Doing the laundry. Buying groceries and household items. I even learned to make him his favorite sour dough effin bread.

17 years of covering all Christmas, birthdays, holidays and all he does is try to take credit because he drove.

17 years of fantasies and dreams that have led nowhere.

17 years of feeling unappreciated. Unloved. Under valued. That I don't deserve anything.

17 years of wasted youth.

17 years of me asking, name one thing you love about me, and getting a reponse of ""you take care of everything""

17 years has been long enough. 

I deserve to be spoiled. Appreciated. Loved. Swept off my feet. Being taken care of. 

I deserve random road trips. Camping nights. Kissing in the rain. Thrift shopping. 3am fucking tacos. Communication. Concerts. 

I deserve to dance with someone willing to teach me a new step or anything because in 17 years, I haven't danced. Let's put it this way, the last time I danced was to copperhead road, 17 years ago and I don't even remember the steps to that let alone all the new ones that have come out. 

I deserve random texts stating they are thinking of me and wanted to send me a smile. Random memes. GIF, you know, stupid shit. 

I deserve to come home from work to a clean house and dinner cooked, not always the other way around. I deserve someone that will wash the dishes after I cook not say that's what we have kids for 🤦‍♀️

But the bigger your heart, more likely it will be broken I guess. So after 17 years, I asked him to leave.

# TL,DR:

what should i look to remove a periodic click ""generated"" by a Yamaha MODX when i engage the +48V on  the mixer (all channels), given that this is the first time it happened and there was no problem for years before?

# Long explanation:

I'm an amateur ""technician"" helping amateur musicians (a better description in [this old post](https://www.reddit.com/r/livesound/comments/1bzqjgn/newbie_struggling_with_input_levels_in_a_mixer/) from me).

Yesterday was the first live of this season, and we setupped our gears as always (everything is owned by the band, so we always setup the same things in the same way in every live).

The relevant part for this post is the mixer (a [Mackie ProFX22v3](https://mackie.com/en/products/mixers/profxv3-series/ProFX22v3.html)), a Yamaha MODX6, the drums mics (i can't remember what they are), and maybe this thing (i don't know the name in english)

https://preview.redd.it/x1al2ls4riye1.png?width=540&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e34324fe4b7d6644288e58535be5bdb06d689c4

First ""sound"" done was the drums, which has 4 mics (Kick, Snare and two panoramics): they requires the +48V and i engaged the phantom power button on the Mackie. Done the levels, everything's ok: we've done this 10-15 times per year, after all.

When the keyboards were ready, we've checked them and problem arises: a periodic (around 1 sec) surge in  the MODX channel (i mean: i can see the input green LED full on for about half a second, then full off for the same time) and when i unmuted the channel we heard a clear ""click""  each time the LED go on.

Weird looks between me and the guys:

Pick another cable, problem still there. 

Concerned looks:

swap the MODX cable with the Electric piano, the problem tranfers on the E.Piano channel.

Brain fumes starts to raises:

turn off the keyboards, pick anoter power cable and plug it in another socket to isolate the keyboards (we sometimes had problems from industrial fridges, professional espresso coffee machies, semi-pro kitchen stuffs generating noises on the power line). Problem still there.

Plug another cable on the ""R output"" (the keyboards are in mono, usually): the led blink disappears. So plug that added cable on the mixer and test the sounds: everything is distorted and ""bad"".

plug the keyboard directly to the player monitor: everything's ok. 

plug the keyboard directly in the mixer (not using that ""thing"" in the middle): problem's there.

PANIC.

We use the mixer and the keyboard in our reharsals room, but not the drum mics and the ""thing"", so i thought to start unplugging one mic at time, and for some reason i thought i should turn of the phantom power before. Disengage the button: problem disappears.

We ate up all the time reserve we had, we were in a closed room, so i managed to get some of the hi-hat on the Snare mic and then told the drummer to hit hard on the cymbals (which he was more than happy to do), and we got a successful live.

Now i need to investigate and solve the problem, but i don't know what should i look for. So here i am, asking for tips, previous experiences, suggestion, clues, lessons in electronics or whatever you see fit.

  
Thanks.

I instantly got a sample and it was truly a love at first sniff that I promised myself to get a full bottle. 

This is such a beautiful scent, and I truly get the hype. It opens up with caramelized peaches and creamy tuberose with a slight hint of citrus. The citrus is just there to balance everything. Without it, the opening will be a cloying, extremely sweet mess. 

After a while, the white florals and the vanilla comes through while you can still catch a whiff of the caramelized peaches scent every now and then. On my skin, the white florals and the vanilla really stood out - but both of them are not competing for attention but rather playing together in harmony. 

This gets compared to Black Opium a lot because they smell similar. Except BO has a coffee note that makes it earthier and slightly ‘drier’. I find that Hundred Silent Ways works better on me. This projects more. This lasts more. And it’s more well-blended than BO - at least on me.

I’m working on a small project and wanted to get your thoughts before going too deep into it.

The idea is simple:  
What if you could order everyday things like coffee, snacks, energy boosters, etc. — *straight from your terminal*?

Think of it like a CLI-based shopping experience tailored for Indian developers. Inspired by [terminal.shop](https://terminal.shop/), but built for India with Indian products and preferences in mind.

I know not everyone is comfortable using the terminal — but since this is r/indiandevs, I figured many of you might actually *enjoy* something like this.

I’m trying to validate:

* Would you ever use a terminal-based store like this?
* What kind of things would you want available on it?
* Is this something you'd want to test out or tinker with?

I’m still in idea phase, so open to thoughts, suggestions, or brutal honesty 🙏

The only reason I can think of for this extreme response. 3 days before I had derma rolled. Also I am in the top 5% slim guys and probably carry less blood and am thus more sensitive to meds and things like that. One coffee keeps me on edge for 12 hours usually..

# 1. Run 30‑Minute Networking Sprints

Ping an alum, ex‑coworker, or meetup speaker:  
“Mind a 15‑min virtual coffee? I’m curious how you solved *X* at *Company*.”  
Track follow‑ups in a Google Sheet so no thread dies.

# 2. Salary‑Anchor with Real Numbers

Before your first call, pull median pay for the exact metro in the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ *Occupational Outlook Handbook*:  
[https://www.bls.gov/ooh/]()  
Add the “Employment & Wage” table to a note—walk in knowing the 50th & 75th percentile.

# 3. ATS‑Proof Your Résumé

Use a single‑column doc, no text boxes.  
Run it through OPM’s free résumé scanner (same engine USAJOBS uses):  
[https://usajobs.gov/Help/how-to/account/documents/resume/build/]()  
Tweak verbs & keywords until the score pops green.

# 4. Auto‑Alert + Track Like a Pro

* USAJOBS for federal roles: [https://www.usajobs.gov/](https://www.usajobs.gov/) (set “Saved Searches”).
* CareerOneStop’s “Job Finder” for state postings: [https://www.careeronestop.org/Toolkit/Jobs/find-jobs.aspx](). Pipe confirmations into a “Jobs” Gmail label; check once nightly.

# 5. Micro‑Upskill the Recurring Gap

Keep seeing “Power BI” or “SQL Basics”? Knock out a free certificate at the Department of Labors’ Apprenticeship portal or FedVTE (for tech roles):  
[https://www.apprenticeship.gov/](https://www.apprenticeship.gov/)  
[https://fedvte.usalearning.gov/]()  
Post the mini‑project on LinkedIn Featured—recruiters love seeing applied skills, not just course badges.

**Final Pro‑Tip**  
Log every outreach → interview → offer in a simple Kanban (Notion, Airtable, whatever). Consistency beats shotgun‐applying every time. Good luck out there—drop wins or questions below!

I assumed he meant no and didn't bring it up again; then one afternoon just out of impulse, I called him, he picked up, I asked him if his silence was really disinterest or he just didn't receive the text (I told him it's fine to say no, and that I would respect his decision). He told me he was busy with his work, that he was a bit shy too (being asked out), and that he was still thinking of how to respond to me. Right then, he asked me whether I was free that night. I said yes, and we scheduled that first date then and there. 

On that first date, surprisingly he told me a lot of personal things, e.g. about his financial struggles, job-related problems that only people within his industry would know, some bad experiences with his ex-girlfriends, and just very private things in general (things that we normally wouldn't disclose on first dates). It was very different to how he normally is at work. To be fair, I wasn't a big talker, thus maybe he felt the need to keep the conversation going somehow. The vibe I got was more similar to that of a therapist, not necessarily a potential partner - he seemed to want to vent to someone who would listen. He actually said (later on into the date) that he was an introvert, and when I expressed surprise (over how much he disclosed about himself), he said he only shared with me ""funny little things"" that don't matter much. Around the end of the date, he was getting distracted and was looking at his phone a lot. I asked if he needed to leave at any specific time, and he asked if we could leave now (that gave me the impression that he probably wanted to leave for a while already, but maybe out of politeness, he didn't tell me that straight). Neither of us mentioned a second date.

Next morning, I got a text from him saying ""the things I told you are just for fun, so don't tell anyone else, yeah?"" (It was probably sent late last night, but my phone was off then). I texted back, reassuring him. Now, I was a bit unsure myself about his behavior and why he acted the way he did (there were incongruent details), but I figured since it was just the first date, and I was still interested in getting to know him more, I also sent another text proposing a second date. 

He responded later, but with very short sentences (with obviously less care than the texts I have received from him before); he asked where I had in mind. I texted back asking if there's anywhere he would like to go/do. He texted back: ""I don't know. What do you think?"".

At this point, I'm very confused. I'm more of a straight-shooter, and I did tell him many times that anytime he feels like he doesn't like me/can't see us being together, he can always tell me and I would respect that. He never did that, but his signals are all over the place. Right now, I'm rather torn on what to do next; I don't think I should initiate more, for I've always been the one to do that, and the imbalance is getting too much for a relationship to work long term. I would really appreciate it if you had any idea why he acted the way he did, or your advice on how I should proceed regarding the situation.

The sun had barely risen, but the hustle was already in full swing. I had to get to work by 8:00 AM, but in Nairobi, nothing is ever that simple.

First, I waited for 15 minutes at the bus stop, watching the Matatus zoom by, packed to the brim with people. Every time one came close, I would step forward, only to see it full—no space, no chance. The constant shouts of the touts, waving their arms, made it feel like I was part of a circus.

Finally, one Matatu slowed down, and I squeezed in between two strangers, hoping not to get too squashed. We started moving, but I quickly realized that the traffic was already unbearable. The roads are always packed, no matter the time of day. It’s like the city never sleeps. It took us 45 minutes to cover a distance that would’ve usually taken 15, and by the time I arrived at work, I was already late.

The real fun came when I tried to pay for my coffee during my break. I walked up to the counter, ready to pay with mobile money, but of course, the system was down. I couldn’t even get a refund for the ""transaction"" I had already sent.

Frustrated, I sat down, but my thoughts were interrupted by the sound of constant honking outside the office windows. The city never stops—people are always rushing, pushing, fighting for space, time, and opportunities. And yet, somehow, nothing ever seems to change.

By the time I got home in the evening, the power went out, just like it does every other night. The whole day felt like a series of little obstacles—things we all just accept because, well, what choice do we have? It's the reality of living in a place where we hope for a better tomorrow, but often end up just getting through today.

At least on its own accord, I could force an eection as I was worried and that was ok, but other than that I woke up everyday with no boner for the last 2 weeks which is rare, and didn't have any occur during the day. My partner says its usually hot down there but on this shampoo she said its not hot at all. The last few days seem to be improivoing though..

The only reason I can think of for this extreme response. 3 days before I had derma rolled. Also I am in the top 5% slim guys and probably carry less blood and am thus more sensitive to meds and things like that. One coffee keeps me on edge for 12 hours usually..

On the 10th of next month, I got married. You come and try to steal the bride.



Upon hearing this, Beckett Zeller finally lifted his head and glanced at Katrina Wilson, who was sitting across from him, with a slight surprise flickering in his slightly raised eyes.



The bony hand with distinct knuckles lightly tapped on the table, carrying an indescribable and inexplicable meaning in its tone.



""Married without consent? Do you know what your identity is and what my identity is?""



In the face of his questioning, Katrina remained calm and composed, her tone unruffled.



""Of course, I was Jamir Lancaster's fiancée, and you were his archenemy.""



""You just needed to tell me, are you coming or not?""



Seeing her speak so calmly, Beckett's lips curled into a slight smile.



He leaned back on the chair, reverting to the relaxed posture he had when he first sat down.



""Come, what are the benefits?""



I heard that your grandmother's health wasn't very good and she has been urging you to get married. You coming to propose not only can embarrass the Lancaster family, but also fulfill your family's expectations. It's a win-win situation.



When talking about this, Katrina still had no expression and spoke casually, as if discussing today's weather.



Seeing her indifferent attitude, Beckett became even more interested.



He raised his right hand and reached out towards her.



""Deal.""



Two hands lightly clasped in the air.



The contract was finalized, and Katrina stood up decisively to leave.



Beckett raised his hand and examined it closely for a while in front of his eyes, then called her.



""Everyone in the circle knows that Jamir loved you to the core, considered you his life. If you eloped with me at the wedding, would he go crazy on the spot?""



Katrina did not answer him.



Her footsteps paused for a moment, and then she left without hesitation.



Passing by the square, a interview was being played on the central screen.



On the screen, Jamir, wearing gold-rimmed glasses and a suit, appeared, instantly attracting the attention of all the girls in the square.



Katrina also stopped in her tracks, listening carefully to the familiar sound that reached her ears.



Host: ""Mr. Jamir, why did you hastily acquire the brand Floralmuse?""



Jamir: ""Because a few days ago, I just proposed to my girlfriend and I need a professional floral team to take care of the wedding venue decoration.""



Host: ""...""



Host: ""It is said that the Lancaster Group recently acquired dozens of snack factories. What does this have to do with the Lancaster Group's future strategy?""



Jamir: ""No, I bought them purely because they were my future wife's favorite snacks.""



Host: ""...""



In a less than ten-minute interview, no matter what the host asked, he never strayed from talking about marriage, never strayed from talking about his wife. Listening to him, everyone couldn't help but feel moved. Jamir, the president of the Lancaster Group, such a powerful figure in the business world, turned out to be a romantic at heart.



It started drizzling lightly from the sky, and after listening for two minutes, Katrina silently turned around and walked into the nearest store.



Just as she entered the door, the phone rang and she picked it up to hear Jamir's gentle and doting voice.



""Katrina, the servant said you went out? It's raining outside now, where are you? I'll come to pick you up.""



She slightly clenched her phone and after a while, she said, ""Don't you have an important meeting today? You're busy, I'll just take a taxi by myself.""



There was no hesitation on the phone, and his voice came through again.



""No, nothing is important without you. Send me the address, I will come over right now.""



Katrina did not refuse anymore.



After the phone call ended, she had just sent the address when two new message notifications appeared on the screen.



A few days ago, she hired a private detective and received the latest update.



""Mr. Jamir didn't go to the company today. He went to the hospital to accompany a woman for prenatal check-up. He has just come out of the hospital.""



Underneath the message, there is a high-definition photo.



In the photo, Jamir was helping a woman push open a door with the words ""Obstetrics and Gynecology"" written on it.



Several girls on the side were still discussing how happy it was to marry Jamir, fearing that they would be spoiled to the heavens.



Katrina listened and looked at the people in the photo, a sarcastic smile appearing at the corner of her mouth.



She and Jamir knew each other since childhood and grew up together as childhood sweethearts.



At the age when other boys were mischievous and teasing girls, Jamir became her guardian, not allowing any opposite sex to approach her.



From the innocence of childhood to the awakening of teenage love, he was always by her side, giving her whatever she wanted, as if he could pluck the stars from the sky and give them to her.



She was curious to learn how to ride a bicycle, but accidentally fell and scraped her skin. He was extremely worried and since then, he didn't let her use any means of transportation and personally picked her up and dropped her off wherever she went.



Katrina also thought that she would always be the only one in his heart.



Until a sudden invitation came, she cancelled the prearranged date with Jamir for work and went abroad for a performance.



A week later, she returned to her home country, only to find that everything had changed.



On the night she left, Jamir had been planning to propose to her.



The meticulously prepared grand proposal scene did not wait for the hostess. He was heartbroken and got drunk, mistakenly entering the wrong room in the hotel, and spent a night with a colleague from the company, Mariela Sullivan.



Two months later, the news of Mariela's pregnancy spread unexpectedly, alarming Jamir's grandmother, Valeria Lancaster.



Valeria forced him to save this child by threatening to die.



It was said that Katrina was obsessed with her dance career and was unwilling to have children. Jamir was advised to leave some bloodline for the Lancaster family.



Jamir was filial and didn't want to hurt Valeria's feelings, so he had to make an agreement with Mariela.



He exchanged a large sum of money and demanded that Mariela leave after giving birth to this child.



Later, after Katrina returned to her home country, he couldn't wait and proposed to her again.



He thought that as long as he did this, everything would be able to return to the way it was before. He thought that he had handled it without anyone knowing.



But little did he know that his beloved Katrina had already found out everything.



She couldn't accept betrayal, nor could she accept flaws.



So, she decided to completely cut off the relationship of over a decade and planned to run away from the wedding a month later, leaving him for good!



Chapter 2

""Katrina, were you hungry after waiting for so long? I prepared some snacks and coffee, would you like to have a little something to eat first?""



The person who suddenly appeared in front of the glass window interrupted Katrina's thoughts.



She shook her head and walked over to him.



Jamir reached out and took her hand. She instinctively looked down and immediately noticed the stain on his coat, which she didn't know when it had gotten there.



His gaze followed her as she moved, seeing her take off her windbreaker and also taking off his own coat to put it on her, but she dodged away.



He hesitated for a moment, then walked up and wanted to take the windbreaker.



Give it to me. You like this piece of clothing so much, I'll take it back and have it cleaned.



Katrina shook her head and directly threw the clothes into the roadside trash bin, her tone indifferent.



Give it up, I don't like things that are stained, you know, I have OCD.



Seeing her cold expression, Jamir's smile froze on his face.



He knew that what she said was not just about clothes, but also about emotions.



After that night, he was completely immersed in pain.



He was afraid that Katrina would leave him because of this, afraid that she would break up with him, afraid that the two of them would never be able to go back to the way things were.



So he could only secretly hide it.



Yes, as long as he keeps it a secret, waits for the child to be born, and then hands the child over to the grandmother for adoption, everything will be fine.



He didn't dare to know Katrina's reaction after she found out. He could lose anyone, except Katrina.



He changed his expression, but Katrina didn't look at Jamir's face. She just quietly looked out the window.



Recalling the moment I first learned about this, I remembered the years of emotions, remembering Jamir, whom I loved dearly. She did try, hiding all the pain, pretending as if nothing had happened.



But she couldn't do it.



She couldn't accept any flaws.



So, after struggling for two months, she decided to let herself go.



Katrina knew that no matter what, Jamir would not accept the proposal to cancel the engagement.



After all, in the past, for the sake of her dance career, she had once proposed a breakup.



That time, Jamir relentlessly followed her, pestering her for a month to reconcile.



She didn't want to repeat the same mistakes.



So, that's why she planned this elopement.



If anyone in this circle could take her away from Jamir, there was only one person, his archenemy - Beckett Zeller.



So, she approached him today.



Fortunately, he also agreed.



Along the way, Jamir remained the same as usual, finding different topics to make her happy.



Katrina, however, couldn't muster any enthusiasm and fell asleep by the window.



When she woke up, she found herself lying on the bed in the bedroom, and the nanny beside her brought her milk.



""Ms. Wilson, this was just prepared by Mr. Jamir for you to drink when you wake up. He is currently selecting fresh flowers in the garden, should I ask him to come up?""



Katrina shook her head, got up and walked to the window. As soon as she glanced down, she saw him holding a rose and carefully placing it in a vase, completely focused.



Half an hour later, Jamir brought the freshly inserted flowers upstairs and handed them to her, asking if she liked them.



She nodded lightly, and a smile instantly appeared on his face.



At night, Katrina stared at the ceiling for a long time unable to fall asleep.



At eleven o'clock, there were two knocks on the door. Jamir walked in, holding a pillow, and insisted that he couldn't sleep and wanted to sleep with her.



Katrina did not refuse and made half of the bed available, allowing him to put his arm around her shoulder.



Half an hour later, there came a shallow breathing sound beside me.



She reached out her hand, found his phone from under the pillow, unlocked the password, opened WhatsApp, found Mariela, and scrolled all the way to the top.



From March to April, Mariela would report the children's situation to him every day, with a respectful and humble tone.



Jamir, however, never turned back.



On April 17th, a green message finally appeared on the right side.



""Stop it, don't you know what this child means to me? Everyone was looking forward to his birth, except for me!""



Mariela only said one sentence, ""I'm sorry.""



Over a month later, the two of them did not chat again.



By mid-May, Mariela had started reporting on time again.



Scrolling down further, the green messages increased slowly from 0, the word count started to become more, and the tone was no longer as harsh.



""When I saw you after work, you had lost quite a bit of weight. Eat more, the child also needs nutrition.""



""Did I hear someone in the company gossiping and bullying you? Are you a fool? Being bullied every day, if there's a problem, come directly to me.""



A typhoon is coming in a couple of days. Stay at home and don't go out. I will have my secretary deliver some supplies.



If I remember correctly, for the whole month of May, she was rehearsing the latest dance drama abroad.



The private detective said that during that time, Valeria brought Mariela back to the Lancaster's house, hoping to bring the two people closer.



So, since then, did Jamir start to care about Mariela?



Katrina's eyelashes trembled slightly, her fingers continued to slide down, and finally settled on today.



What time was the prenatal check-up? Send me the address.



""Mr. Jamir, weren't you supposed to accompany Ms. Wilson today?""



""You don't need to worry about it, address.""

Is this a good VERY first game concept?","Hello! I've begun learning for the very first time how to make a game. I've barely dabbled in the very basics of GDScript a few years ago, but dropped it because the updates they were making would break my code. I figure it's stable enough now to try again!

Cozy games are absolutely flooding the market right now, so I don't want to get lost in the sea of cozy games. I wanna stand out, make something appealing, since obviously, those games are making sales, but I don't want to do the same thing everyone else is doing.

So ultimately, I have some BIG sprawling ideas, but I figure that would be near impossible at my stage. So, like people have suggested, I was gonna pick up Pong, flappy bird, a Mario level. But none of that interested me, and I thought that the only way I'd actually be able to get into this, make progress, and actually pursue it like I want to, is to do something I genuinely want to make.

So the concept is simple, I want to make a ""cozy"" coffee game. Cute, hand drawn art styles, orders and timers, menu's for each ingredient, single screen 2D game. Maybe that'd help me get a lot of basics down.  
I have a lot of long term ideas though, ones to help me improve while I make the game bigger and cooler.

so, coffee games are supposed to be ""cozy"" ""relaxing"" ""cute"", right? That's the general idea. I was gonna break away from that, throw you to the wolves like a real café would do. Short patience timers, very snappy and quick animations to make drinks, and while you're dealing with these short patience meters, you also have to handle the maintenance of your machines.  
Wipe down the steamer nozzle, clean steamer cups, wipe the counter of spilled milk and espresso, grind more beans, etc. And in order to stay on top of it all, you'd have to time when to do this maintenance, either between customers, or while you're waiting for espresso to pour, or spaces of the like.  
At the end of the day, the more money you make, the more perfect orders, you can upgrade your machines to lessen the workload. Every day or so, you'd unlock new ingredients and new types of coffee, and eventually boba, much like Papa's games.  
Essentially, trick you with the art style and how these games nearly always look, then throw you to the wolves lol.

And to keep you out of the boring monotony of making coffee and boba repetitively, I'd have some horror element in the background. Something that does not directly effect you, but something to unsettle you. Police cars consistently speeding past the window in front of the counter, music cutting completely and orders pausing entirely for a few seconds, making you think ""wtf is going on, what is this"" and then going back to rush, maybe an unusual amount of birds hitting the window at once, and things of the like.  
I haven't gotten to get into these ideas yet, so unfortunately, I don't have much of a concept to give you in that regard.

Obviously all this would come later. But the beginning concept, the café simulator in a fast paced environment with quicktime minigames for your machines, is this actually feasible for someone who's practically never picked up game development before? And is the concept even fun, or worth it enough to pursue? And lastly, how would I even learn the basics of this?

But what exactly is **chicory**?

* It’s a root from the chicory plant
* Roasted, ground, and often mixed with coffee
* Adds a deep, earthy, slightly bitter body to the brew
* Contains **no caffeine** and is **not a coffee bean**

Historically, it became popular during times when coffee was expensive or hard to source. Over time, it became part of the flavour profile people love in traditional filter coffee — **comforting, strong, and bold**.

On the other hand, **specialty coffee** (like the wild-grown Arabica from Northeast India) uses:

* 100% pure coffee beans
* Clear, traceable origin
* Tasting notes like citrus, chocolate, honey
* No blending — just the bean’s natural character

 I just got off the phone with you and decided to take this time to write you something. Where do I even start, seriously. The way you make me feel…let’s start with this. If I could describe this feeling it would have to be “you give me wings” you make me fly. Describing this may throw you off a little bit but my god do I feel untouchable when I’m with you. Your love, affection, touch, and kisses take me high above the clouds. I sometimes forget what’s going on around me and what stressors are in my life. Today, I brought up a few trips I’d like to take in my lifetime and in my head I pictured you with me on every single one. I pictured me holding your hand as the plane takes off to Maine, kissing you on the jetties as the lighthouse shines on the ocean and the sound of seagulls are Behind us. I pictured Laughing with you at a famous restaurant as we gobbled down luxury fish and lobster. I thought of looking at you as we walk in an old town, with tall street lights, your bitter cold hands touching mine and us kissing under the moon light as the different shades of leaves fall to the ground. 

When I brought up New York I thought of both us in big coats walking in Central Park with a mouth full of pizza. I began to look at you while you’re not looking and I hear hundreds of peoples voices in the back ground but all I see is your beautiful face. We take a walk to see a HUGE Christmas tree but on the way you asked if we could get some coffee. We make it to the tree and this moment couldn’t be more powerful…I turn to look at you and the dozens of lights from the tree ricochet from your beautiful black hair. You smell off coffee beans and expensive lotion lol and I can’t get enough of you. I kiss your forehead and we stare at the green colorful beauty.

When I spoke of Bahamas I thought of your sexy dark skin in a black swimsuit. You have your big face shades and you look heavenly. We are on the beach, toes in the sand and the kids are just laughing as they play with a kite. We’re both a little buzzed with drinks in our hands. You smile at me and ask me why I’m looking at you that way. I say “no reason babe” but I’m really thinking how beautiful you are. We stay on the beach for hours and play in the water. I take it a little too far and tackle you, pick you up and throw you in the water. Then swim to you and give you a big salty kiss. 

We’re on a cruise now and both of us are complaining about how small the rooms are and how we really don’t like the food. But you and I always make the best out of these type of situations so we decide to go to a country club on this big ass boat . I ask you for a dance and hold my hand out and you grab it with a huge buck tooth smile lol. I swing you around and we two step to some George Strait and Jason Aldean. Meanwhile we’re still In our swimming gear and we look like a hot mess. After this we walk to the end of the boat. And as gay as this sounds I’ve always wanted to kiss here just like the titanic. I grab you from behind and my chin is on your shoulder with my arms completely wrapped around you . We hear nothing waves crash against the walls of the boat and see nothing but darkness in front of us. I kiss you on your neck. 

Vegas! Now both of us are trying to let out some steam from working so hard and it’s a getaway without the kids. We pack our LV and Supreme luggage and jump on the first flight to sin city. We get tot he hotel and change into our best fits and step out on the town. We have dinner at some fancy restaurant, you look gorgeous as you take a sip of wine. I smile at you and you say what? I respond with “nothing babe” but I’m just thinking of how lucky I am.. we head to a few gambling spots and we play a few slot machines. You sit on top of me while I’m barely winning Pennies on the damn thing but you turn your head and I kiss you as the sounds of the music, laughter of people, and slot machines fill the room. 

I figured this might bring a smile to your face. I wanted you in my world for a minute ..think heavy on these moments because you will forever live In my mind and heart. I love you forever, MK. I mean that .

1kdmxm7,https://www.reddit.com/r/eurovision/comments/1kdmxm7/erika_vikman_ich_komme_in_ipa_international/,Erika Vikman - Ich komme in IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet,"Well, I hope everyone who's going to Eurovision enjoys Eurovision because ich komme nicht...

Anyway, here's ~~Wonderwall~~ Ich komme in IPA.

Characteristics of Finnish:

* Finnish has a lot of features in common with Estonian, which is to be expected as sibling languages, and some features one language the other doesn't (if you're curious, I did [NNETMKM](https://www.reddit.com/r/eurovision/comments/1dkb1zg/5miinust_puuluup_nendest_narkootikumidest_ei_tea/) in IPA last year). Also, despite that status, it often serves as a challenge for one speaker to understand the other language. Here's 2 jokes I found I can't remember where I found them about how Estonian and Finnish understand each other
      * Estonian: I'm going to clean (koristama) in the room (ruumis)
      * Finnish: Do not cover (Ei saa peittää).
* But the things they share in common are gemination of all phonemes (distinct sounds in a language's sound inventory), agglutination (adding suffixes after suffixes to attain meaning) to extreme levels, and a shallow orthography that represents the spoken language 99% of the time. We'll get into that 1% later.
* So, one of the things Finnish has Estonian lost is **vowel harmony**. Vowel harmony is the concept that suffixes must match the front/back quality of the word for ease of pronunciation. And so, **a** \[ɑ̝\], **o** \[o̞\], **u** \[u\] are **back** while **ä** \[æ\], **ö** \[ø\], **y** \[y\] are **front**. And that leaves e \[e̞\] and i \[i\] as ""**neutral vowels**"" that don't determine vowel harmony by itself. But if a word contains only ""neutral vowel,"" the front vowel harmony is used.
   * s**yö**d**ä** (to eat, infinitive, all front vowels)
   * j**uo**d**a** (to drink, all back vowels corresponding in placement of the front vowels in the example word above despite both being infinitive)
   * t**u**lev**a**inen (upcoming) + UUs (nominalized characteristic, capitalized U means either ”u” or ”y” based on harmony) = tulevais**uu**s (future)
   * s**ää**st**ä**v**ä**inen (frugal, prudent) + UUs = säästäväis**yy**s (a good thrift, yys is the **front** variant of -uus)
   * **e**d**i**kt**i** (edict) + ssA (inesssive, location ""in/at"") = ediktiss**ä** (in the edict)
      * Loanwords don't follow this rule, such as ”analyysi” (analysis, a - back, yy - front, i - neutral)
* Just a note before we continue one, many -i at the ends of words turn into -e- in declension.
   * Nim**i** = name; nim**e**ni = my name
* I didn't mention this in my NNETMKM post, but Finnish and Estonian have **consonant gradation**. In a way I can explain easily, take the follow words, and pay attention to the consonant(s) before the final vowel : joki (river) = jo / **k** / i; sukka (sock) - su / **kk** / a; kenkä (shoe) = ke / **nk** / ä
   * The following words have an ending stem with a ""strong"" grade consonant (cluster), meaning they don't end with a consonant or the syllable has a geminated vowel maybe (not) accompanied by a consonant at the end. If you're Dutch, you may recognize this pattern as open/closed syllables, except affecting the pronunciation of the consonant before the vowel rather than the vowel. When we add a consonant at the end, such as the plural ”-t”, these words change to: **joet** (rivers, missing K to be explained), **sukat** (socks), **kengät** (shoes). Weakening also happens when added suffixes consist of more than one consonant, including doubled consonants (kau**pp**a (store) → kau**p**a**ss**a (in the store)).
   * This can work conversely, as in weak grade consonant (clusters) becoming strong. Take the word ”kuningas” (king) = kuni / **ng** / as. In this particular word and words of its declension type (lipas, hammas), final -s is replaced with the vowel preceding it in declension, opening up the syllable with a geminated vowel and giving a theoretical \*kuni**nk**aa-, the form used for further declension such as ""king's"" (kuninkaan) and ""kings"" (kuninkaat). The GENERAL gradations between strong and weak are as follow (singulars → plurals):
      * pp ↔ p (kauppa → kaupat; lipas → lippaat)
      * tt ↔ t (katto → katot; suutin → suttimet)
      * kk ↔ k (markka → markat; savuke → savukkeet)
      * p ↔ v (läpi → lävet; kaavin → kaapimet)
      * t ↔ d (rauta → raudat; säde -> säteet)
      * k ↔ Ø (nothing), v, j (joki → joet, luku → luvut, hylky → hyl(j)yt; varas (\*varaa) → varkaan, lahje → lahkeet)
      * mp ↔ mm (kampa→ kammat; hammas → hampaat)
      * nk ↔ ng (kuningas → kuninkaat; 
      * nt ↔ nn (lento → lennot; muunnin → muuntimet)
      * lt ↔ ll (ilta → illat; puhallin → puhaltimet)
      * rt ↔ rr (parta → parrat; aarre -> aarteet)
   * It's not uncommon that one gradation causes another part of the word to gradate.
      * Take the word ”näyttää” (to show). The syllable after ”-tt-” is open, either single without consonant or geminated with(out) an consonant at the end. We can add the ""frequentative"" suffix to make näyttää - ää + ellA = \*näyttellä → näytellä (to act, play as), and we see ”-tt-” became ”-t-” as the replacing suffixing -ellA consists of a doubled consonant that sandwiches ”-e-” between the gradating ”-tt-” and the doubled ”-ll-”. However, the conjugation of -ellA verbs in the present tense (minus the passive) replaces the -lA of -ellA to corresponding forms for person (-en, -et, -ee, -emme, -ette, -evät). For example, (s)he acts is ”hän \*näytelee”. However, we see the first ”-e-” is no longer squished between 2 consonant, therefore ”-t-” can become strong again as ”hän nattelee”.
   * There's also a weird case of words ending in ”-si” actually being t ↔ d in disguise. The word for ""water"" is ”vesi”, but ""my water"" isn't ”\*ve**s**eni”, it's ”ve**t**eni”. Similarly, ""in the water"" is the ssA suffix is ”vedessä”.
* Here's the final 1% why reading Finnish is also just as much as a pain as learning it in general. While Estonian has hinted gemination length, Finnish has **hidden** boundary gemination, meaning certain categories of words can cause the proceeding word with a consonant to geminate. These words include, but not limited to:
   * Negative present tense: En haluu tanssia hitait (I **don't want** to slow dance) = En haluu‿ttanssia hitait
   * Negative passives: Ei voida jatkaa (**No continuing**) = Ei voida‿jjatkaa
   * Imperatives
      * Positive: Tule tänne (**come** over here) = tule‿ttänne
      * Negative: Älä tee musta presidentin (**don't make** me president) = Älä tee‿mmusta presidentin
   * Infinitives: En voi vastata siihen (I can **answer** there) = En voi vastata‿ssiihen
   * Allative case (towards): Kerron lapsille sadun (I'm telling **the children** a fairy tail) = Kerron lapsille‿ssadun
   * Third-person possessive suffix ”-nsA”: Hän tuli äitinsä kanssa ((S)he came with **his** mom) = Hän tuli äitinsä‿kkanssa
   * A mrjotyi of words ending in -e, even in compouds: Tervetuloa (Welcome) = Terve‿ttuloa
   * Adverbs with a certain ending
      * \-sti
      * \-nne
      * \-tse
      * sometimes -i
      * arguable -lti
   * Participles ending in -tU: Talo on **rakennettu** kolmessa viikossa (A hourse **was built** in three weeks) = Talo on rakennettu‿kkolmessa viikossa
   * Participles ending in -(n)ut (colloquially): Oon jo **ottanut** kahvia (I already have **had** coffee) = Oon jo ottanu‿kkahvia
   * Any gemination causing word category mentioned here also geminates clitics: Mullekinko? (To me, too?) = Mulle‿kkinko?
   * Oh, yeah, and a bunch of other mschellaneous words because Finnish apparently wanted to be like [Italian](https://www.reddit.com/r/eurovision/comments/1ho9ekk/la_noia_in_ipa/). /j
* Not a note, but some of these odd occurences like lahje →  lahkeet, where lahje should be the weak grade, but doesn't have a consonant ending its syllable, or imperatives causing boundary gemination can somewhat be explained as ""Finnish evolved to lose a sound, but retain its pressence."" Calling this imaginary letter ""Q,"" we can somewhat see the the gradation between lahjeQ → lahkeet and the hidden geminations.

Miscellaneous (because this characteristic section wasn't already long enough...):

* So, it turns out Erika pronounces the first syllables of her names long (like Eerika Viikman), as seen in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apak06FJhiw).
* It's good thing I planned this ahead of time. I did [Baller ](https://www.reddit.com/r/eurovision/comments/1k7g7dq/abor_tynna_baller_in_ipa_international_phoentic/)last week, and now I did an IPA post with German as a second language, so we should know what German is like. However, Erika, and the backing chorus for that matter, pronounces the phrase „ich komme“ as \[ˈiçko̞mˌme̞\] (Finnish pronunciation) rather than \[ˈʔɪç ˈk^(h)ɔmə\], and this might be a stylistic choice as all lines rhyme with the Finnish pronunciation of this line. The actual German pronunciation will be in paratheses.

1kdmx5h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1kdmx5h/my_life_is_a_really_long_movie_theres_hope/,My life is a (really long) movie (there’s hope!!!),"TL;DR spent three entire years yearning and pining over a cute boy and it was mutual the entire time

I’m procrastinating an essay that’s due in a day so I thought, because I owe it to lurking on this subreddit for keeping me delusional enough to keep hoping, I would tell y’all about my boyfriend.

SO. WITHOUT FURTHER ADO.

I (24F) met this guy (28M, I’ll call him Z) start of 2021 on a group trip. I was super shy and just starting to get to know people, it was kind of mystifying to me that I was invited at all, and I’d never been on anything like it before. He’d been on heaps, but was also pretty shy but very well liked in the group. I thought he was kinda cute, but I was kind of afraid of men (long sad story) so I avoided the guys for most of the trip.

End of it, friend A, who is trying to get her ex back, and friend B who had a thing for another guy decided they wanted to convoy back with the two guys who happened to be sharing a car with Z — and I get dragged along because I didn’t have my license yet and had carpooled with them. We made several stops on the way home, the six of us, and I would kind of drag my feet behind everyone while we looked at the sights. Z knew a lot about just about everything so they were treating him like kind of a tour guide. 

Final stop, we go for some McDonalds. I end up, predictably, the last to order and the last to get my food. Z says “I’ll wait with you”, just because he’s considerate like that. I predictably get awkward and shaky, and when we end up sitting right across from each other I’m even more crazy awkward. I basically couldn’t finish my food, I was so tense. So I pull out my receipt and start doodling on the back of it to avoid conversation… and he leans over what I’m doodling, just watches. And after a while he’s like, narrating what I’m drawing. And I turn the receipt round and pass him the pen, and he’s like “yes great use of the space!” and I manage to choke out a “nono I mean it’s your turn”

So we end up making a little story together on the back of the receipt about a sailor boy and his hairy houseboat and his magic cigar, and all the while he’s telling me all about himself and I open up too so he doesn’t feel awkward, and I realise I’m starting to get comfortable, and we look up at each other and his eyes go wide and my eyes go wide and I feel my heart sink and I shut down because oh no no no no no I’ve caught Feelings. So I turn to the other friends who are absorbed in their own chats and I’m like, I wanna go home? And we do. 

Guys I avoided him for two years.

TWO YEARS.

I just couldn’t — every time he would come up to help me with something, or make a sweet comment, or just play cards while I happened to also be playing cards I would feel my heart amp up and I’d start visibly trembling and I’d get twitchy and terrified and red. So I started running away, but I still wanted to be in the same room with him because he just radiated light to me, and I felt horribly creepy but I couldn’t stop looking for him everywhere I was. When I tried to ask my friends if maybe I had a chance and brought up all the evidence, like all the eye contact and him letting me win cards and being so nice all the time even though I kept ignoring him, and also going very red when I did try to talk to him (maybe…? Maybe….?) they dismissed me and said he was just a really nice guy, really awkward and a little clumsy but really nice. And he was, he is, so I would sulk and then I’d open r/crushes like a huge loser and just scroll for other people like me.

During that time, there were rumours of him being “about to” enter talking stages with a couple of other girls, which just gutted me — it was like every new thing I found out about him was more reason to like him so so much but I just could not talk to the man.

During this time I started getting therapy for my fear of men. I kept working at it, and a little into the third year I tried inviting him randomly to a play some of us were going to. It was stupid, he’d already been invited in the group chat and ignored the message — but from me, he said yes. Win! Except when we were there, I was back to ignoring him again. And I was so convinced I’d blown it, being so weird and inviting him obsoletely and then fully avoiding him… except I kept inviting him to things after that like I was Gatsby or something, I was so whipped. I threw an entire Christmas party hoping he would think I was cool and mature and responsible etc etc etc…

He’s a plant guy. I started an eco team and hoped he’d come to the cleanups. He’s into art. I painted a community mural and asked for his help.

He kept showing up, I kept embarrassing myself. Eventually, I fly overseas to see my sister. It’s weird how having an ocean between you makes you braver — so I asked him in his dms if he would be keen for a coffee, and he said yes absolutely, tomorrow maybe? And I said oh that’s awkward I’m actually out of the country but I’m back next weekend, and he said great!

So we got coffee. He shouted. We walked and talked for maybe two or three hours before I realised I had to be somewhere, or else we fully would have stayed longer. I thought, YES. I’M IN. I PULLED.

No y’all

Three dates in, he said he wasn’t ready for a relationship. I was Heartbroken. I was Whipped. I asked if we could keep hanging out anyway. He said yes, but only if I was okay with it. I was maybe a little too okay with it. I am a confident woman at this point but I was very ready to forgo my self respect for this one man.

One entire year of Will They Won’t They. I am telling you my friends were on the edge of their seats — like Z and I were meeting every month or two and having the most ridiculously romantic moments and then just moving on all chaste and platonic like we were in a PERIOD DRAMA. I could tell you guys the little stories I could go on forever. I could tell you about the climbing trees out in the middle of nowhere and the knowing each other’s entire life stories off by heart and the poems I wrote and the drinking flower nectar but there’s not enough room in your head so I’ll fast forward again

This new year’s, our friend group went on another trip, our last one before a couple that had just recently met on that first trip got married (full circle…?). We had a ton of fun. I asked him if he could drive me up in his van he’d done up, and he said yeah. I was pretty sure by this point he at least liked me, but he hadn’t given me any real words for it. So anyway we showed up together and people started talking.

His friends, the two who I’d almost dated during the long three years (two also long stories), cornered him. They said why haven’t you asked her out yet? You know she likes you? He’s like. What?

He asks me out. It’s been pretty much a dream this past three months — I was right — our communication styles align so well and we have so much in common, we’ve been doing almost all our spare time together. We’re THAT annoying couple. 

The best part is that it has been mutual obsession this entire time. We were lying together one evening and he says, totally unprompted, remember that receipt? I think that’s where it started for me. It was like a bomb went off in my head. I convinced myself you were out of my league, so I left it, but when we started hanging out more a couple years later I remembered again. I think I thought about you every single day last year.

:|.

So.

Anyway.

He’s drawing pictures of fish right now, for the children’s book he’s illustrating about beach biology. We’ll call later — I’m sick right now — and I’ll make apples out of clay while he tells me about his day. This weekend we’re running an eco group cleanup together. 

He was there when I finished the mural. It’s still there

I'm a student planning to move to Australia soon to study Computer Science and wanted to get a realistic view of what the tech job market looks like—both for part-time work during uni and full-time jobs post-graduation.

Some questions I'm hoping to get insight on:

* How's the demand for CS grads, especially in fields like AI/ML, web dev, and cybersecurity?
* Are startups hiring fresh grads or is it mostly big firms?
* How hard is it to land internships or part-time roles while studying?
* Is the pay decent, or is it more ""coffee money"" until you get some real experience?
* If I get into a G8 school or a well recognized CS school like UTS, Monash,etc, does that make things easier?

I'd really appreciate some firsthand experiences—whether you're a student, grad, or already working in the industry.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The ice cube chocolate market boasts a range of products, each with unique features designed to enhance the experience. Key aspects include the chocolate's composition, the ice cube design, the addition of flavorings, and packaging.

**Chocolate Composition:** The type of chocolate used significantly impacts the final product. High-quality ice cube chocolates often use premium cocoa beans, resulting in a richer, smoother flavor profile. Some brands incorporate single-origin chocolates to showcase specific regional characteristics. The percentage of cocoa solids also plays a vital role, affecting the chocolate's intensity and bitterness. Dark chocolate, milk chocolate, and white chocolate variations offer diverse taste experiences for different preferences.

**Ice Cube Design and Size:** The physical form of the chocolate is crucial. Well-designed ice cube chocolates have consistent shapes and sizes, ensuring uniform melting and easy handling. Some brands offer intricate molds with decorative patterns, adding visual appeal. The size of the ice cube also matters; smaller cubes melt quickly and provide a burst of flavor, while larger cubes offer a more sustained chocolate experience. The design also needs to consider easy removal from the mold to avoid breakage.

**Flavor Infusions and Add-ins:** Many brands enhance their ice cube chocolates with various flavor infusions and add-ins. Popular additions include mint, espresso, sea salt, chili, and fruit extracts. These infusions add complexity and create unique flavor combinations. Add-ins like nuts, caramel pieces, and cookie crumbles provide textural contrast and enhance the overall sensory experience. The quality and balance of these additions are critical to the success of the final product.

**Packaging and Presentation:** The packaging of ice cube chocolate is essential for maintaining freshness and visual appeal. High-quality packaging protects the chocolates from moisture, light, and temperature fluctuations, ensuring optimal flavor and texture. Attractive packaging enhances the gifting potential and adds to the overall premium experience. Sustainable and eco-friendly packaging options are also becoming increasingly important for environmentally conscious consumers.

**Melting Properties:** Ice cube chocolate is designed to melt in the mouth, offering a creamy, smooth sensation. The melting point of the chocolate is carefully controlled to ensure that it doesn't melt too quickly or too slowly. Some brands incorporate techniques like tempering to create a stable cocoa butter structure, resulting in a more desirable melting profile and a glossy appearance. The texture upon melting is a key factor in the overall enjoyment of the product.

**Ingredients Sourcing and Quality:** The origin and quality of ingredients significantly influence the taste and ethical considerations of ice cube chocolate. Brands committed to sustainability often source cocoa beans from fair trade or direct trade farms, ensuring fair compensation for farmers and environmentally responsible practices. The use of organic and non-GMO ingredients is also a growing trend, appealing to health-conscious consumers. Transparency regarding ingredient sourcing and production methods builds trust and enhances brand reputation.

 ## Core Benefits

Ice cube chocolate offers a unique combination of refreshment and indulgence, making it a versatile treat with several key benefits.

**Refreshing Indulgence:** The combination of cool temperature and rich chocolate flavor provides a refreshing and satisfying experience, particularly appealing during warmer months. It鈥檚 a delightful alternative to traditional hot chocolate or ice cream, offering a lighter and more nuanced indulgence.

**Versatile Dessert Option:** Ice cube chocolate can be used in various desserts and beverages, adding a touch of elegance and flavor. It can be dropped into coffee or milk for a flavored beverage, used as a garnish for ice cream or cakes, or even enjoyed on its own as a sophisticated treat. Its versatility makes it a perfect addition to any dessert repertoire.

**Controlled Portion Size:** The ice cube format provides a convenient way to control portion size, allowing consumers to enjoy a small amount of chocolate without overindulging. This makes it a guilt-free treat option for those watching their calorie intake or simply seeking a moderate indulgence.

**Unique Sensory Experience:** The melting sensation of ice cube chocolate is a unique and enjoyable experience. The cool, firm texture initially transitions into a smooth, creamy liquid, providing a delightful contrast that stimulates the senses. This distinct sensory experience sets it apart from other chocolate products.

**Enhanced Beverage Flavor:** Adding ice cube chocolate to beverages like coffee, milk, or even cocktails can significantly enhance their flavor profile. The chocolate melts slowly, releasing its aroma and taste, creating a richer and more complex drink. It offers a convenient and flavorful way to customize beverages to individual preferences.

 ## FAQs Section

**How should ice cube chocolate be stored to maintain its quality?**

Ice cube chocolate should be stored in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and heat sources. The ideal temperature is between 60-70掳F (15-21掳C). Proper storage prevents the chocolate from melting, blooming (developing a white coating), or absorbing odors from the surrounding environment. An airtight container or resealable bag is recommended to maintain freshness.

**Can ice cube chocolate be used in hot beverages?**

Yes, ice cube chocolate can be used in hot beverages like coffee, hot chocolate, or tea. It will melt and dissolve, adding a rich chocolate flavor to the drink. Adjust the number of cubes according to your desired level of sweetness and chocolate intensity. Stir well to ensure the chocolate is fully dissolved.

**Are there any vegan or dairy-free options available for ice cube chocolate?**

Yes, several brands offer vegan and dairy-free ice cube chocolate options. These products typically use plant-based milk alternatives like almond milk, soy milk, or coconut milk, and dairy-free chocolate made with cocoa butter and plant-based sweeteners. Look for products labeled as ""vegan"" or ""dairy-free"" to ensure they meet your dietary requirements.

**How long does ice cube chocolate typically last?**

The shelf life of ice cube chocolate varies depending on the brand and ingredients used. Generally, high-quality ice cube chocolate can last for several months if stored properly. Check the expiration date on the packaging for the manufacturer's recommendation. Over time, the chocolate may lose some of its flavor intensity, but it is usually safe to consume if stored correctly.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) Ah, the classic showdown between the Philadelphia Phillies and the Arizona Diamondbacks, where the stakes are as high as the cheesesteaks in Philly. We've got a matchup that's more unpredictable than a cat on a hot tin roof, with both teams sitting at an identical 17-14 record. It's like watching two identical twins duke it out, except one has a slightly better ERA and the other hits more home runs.

Let's break it down: The Phillies have been favored 23 times this season and have managed to win 13 of those games. Not exactly a record that screams ""trustworthy,"" but hey, it's baseball. They average 0.9 home runs per game, which is about as exciting as a lukewarm cup of coffee. Their 3.91 team ERA is decent, ranking 14th in MLB, which means their pitching staff is like that reliable friend who always shows up, but never brings snacks.

On the other hand, the Diamondbacks have been the underdogs nine times and have won five of those games. They're like the scrappy underdog in every sports movie ever, except with a penchant for hitting home runs, ranking sixth in MLB with 42 dingers. Their 4.39 ERA, however, is a bit like a leaky faucet—constantly dripping and slightly annoying.

Now, let's talk pitchers. Aaron Nola is having a rough start to the season, with a 0-5 record and a 5.40 ERA. It's like he's pitching with a blindfold on. Meanwhile, Brandon Pfaadt is on fire with a 5-1 record and a 2.78 ERA. He's the guy you want on your team when the chips are down.

The odds are leaning towards the Phillies with a moneyline price of 1.83, but let's not forget that Pfaadt has been a revelation this season. The Diamondbacks are priced at 2.02, making them a tempting underdog pick. If you're feeling adventurous, you might want to ride the Diamondbacks' hot streak.

For the best bet, consider the Over on the total runs at 9.5. With both teams having their share of offensive firepower and Nola's struggles on the mound, this game could easily turn into a slugfest. So, grab your popcorn and get ready for a game that's sure to be more entertaining than a reality TV show.

1kdmp7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxietyhelp/comments/1kdmp7l/my_first_positive_week_on_lexaproescitalopram/,My first (positive) week on Lexapro/Escitalopram,"It’s been 8 days since I started taking escitalopram and I thought I share my experiences with you. Because a lot of experiences on reddit are negative, I thought I might give some of you a bit of hope by sharing my positive experiences. 

Last 8 months I completely destroyed my nervous system. I was constantly in fight or flight, couldn’t sleep and didn’t feel like my usual bubbly and social self. I felt physical symptoms of anxiety, like a heavy feeling in my chest and restlessness. The worst was not being able to sleep. Just being fully “on”. That was the point that I decided to try medication. 

I talked to a several psychiatrists and friends who have taken antidepressants and my conclusion was this. Your brain is an organ. If your liver wouldn’t work properly would you start medication? Yes. So why not for my brain? Why continue being not my usual self and hope that one day it’ll change? I saw medication as a cast. I’ll heal, but I’ll heal better and faster if I use temporary help. 

So I started taking 5mg of escitalopram. It’s been a week and I haven’t had any side effects. Yesterday was the first night that I’ve actually slept like I used to sleep, deep and relaxed. The last three days I have even drank coffee, which makes me happy now instead of anxious. 

Sometimes I still have moments when I feel anxious, but I remember that I am healing now. And maybe it’s placebo, but knowing that I am healing helps me find ground under my feet during those moments. 

I read that antidepressants make you gain weight and that some people see it as an obstacle. Ironically, I feel like my appetite got less. 

Today I started 10mg and maybe I’ll notice some side effects later. But so far it’s been a good decision to take medication. I feel already better and I hope it helps some of you if you’re doubting. ",2,1746254777.0,Anxietyhelp,1,1.0,False

I'm doing this from my throwaway account just in case this gets posted outside Reddit l but I had to share the experience I just had with a Karen in the wild with you guys. 

So some important backstory context for this a couple weekends ago in my city and we were having really nice weather and I decided since I had the day off it would be really nice to go get a tea and snack from my favorite coffee shop and take a walk. When I was walking back I was coming across the crosswalk and when I was halfway across a car came out of nowhere into the intersection and hit me straight on as she was turning into the crosswalk. I had to go to the hospital in an ambulance, but overall I was really lucky I dislocated shoulder, rotator cuff pretty much obliterated, and the top of my foot is fractured. Not great obviously, but it could have been much worse so I'm very grateful. I cant really get around well because of my injuries and so I've been pretty much glued to my bed with the occasional trip to the bathroom. 

Now onto the Tea! 

I've been going slightly insane because pretty much all I can do is read, watch TV, or stare at the ceiling. And trust me there is only so much you can read and watch before you want to physically rip the hair out from your scalp. Today my sweet boyfriend had an idea to bring a temporary end to my insanity, he's a student in one of his last semesters at a University that I live nearby. He knows how much I love music and that I enjoy a lot of different genres including classical, and he found out that today there was going to be a student concert from some of the music majors on his campus and students could go for free and bring a guest. So he got us tickets, he figured it would be a good way for me to get out of the house and it's something I could sit for so it shouldn't be an issue, or at least that's what we thought. He picked me up that evening, brought me to the auditorium and helped me get settled and then sat beside me. The auditorium we were in was nothing super fancy, pretty much just a standard auditorium, the seats were plywood pews with some staining and the part you sat on was another piece of ply wood with some cushioning you pulled down like you would in a movie theatre and there wasn't a lot of space between each row. My boyfriend and I didn't want people accidently stepping on my foot  or bumping it by accident during the concert so the way I was sitting was kind of half crisscross apple sauce with my foot sideways on the seat slightly propped up with the knee of my other leg. I want to make it clear it was just the fabric side of the shoe I managed to get on touching the seat, not the bottom of the shoe, not the rubber, and not my dirty foot either, just the fabric side of my shoe which was clean. The first half of the concert was great and I was enjoying being outside of my apartment for the first time in a good while. Then we got to intermission, a man needed through but I couldn't stand, I lifted my other foot really quickly so he could get through and a couple second later I hear yelling from behind me of EXCUSE ME EXCUSE ME HOW DARE YOU. It was Karen. I was extremely confused because I was literally just minding my own business and didn't know who the hell this lady was or what I had done, but I very clearly was the new target of Karen's wrath. She doesn't give me any sort of chance to respond she just continues screaming at me like I'm some sort of five year old PUT YOUR FOOT DOWN PUT IT DOWN!! THIS IS SO DISRESPECTUL TO THE EXPENSIVE FURNITURE IN THE THEATRE HOW DARE YOU! (Yes the seats made of ply wood very expensive I'm sure \*rolls eyes) I have no clue why she was screaming because she was sitting right behind me, I put the foot I had just lifted up maybe five seconds ago for the gentleman down because I was going to do that anyways since I had just moved it for a second to let him pass. I thought maybe this is what she meant and hadn't seen him go past me. But nope, she continued screaming at me like I was five about how dare I be so disrespectful to the expensive furniture and I demanding I put my foot down. I realized she was talking about my injured foot (Which again only the fabric side of the shoe was touching the chair) I really calmly told her Ma'am I'm injured that's why I'm sitting like this and before I could even finish my sentence she just started screaming NO EXCUSES. I tried to explain to her again that I was injured and tell her the top of my foot was broken and she wouldn't let me finish a sentence or hear I word I would say she just kept screaming at me NO EXCUSES and demanding I put my foot down, finally my boyfriend has had enough of and can't stay quite anymore and says Ma'am she just got hit by a car a couple weeks ago, and her foot is injured that's why she's sitting this way. She needs to keep it up. And before my boyfriend can even finish his sentence she begins screaming at him as well before her friend that is with her (That's right Karen wasn't even an employee of the auditorium) pulls her down by the arm and tells her really quickly that she was causing a scene over nothing and that I had been hit by a car and was injured. Karen just kept screaming at me and demanding I put my foot down she tried getting up several times only to be pulled back into her seat by her friend. I could hear her friend behind me saying she she needed to calm down, that I was injured and how I was sitting wasn't hurting anyone or causing any damage to the theatre so she needed to calm down. Finally the lights flicker for intermission to be over and the concert begins again, but neither me or my boyfriend can really enjoy it anymore because I'm uncomfortable and he was pissed off. At the end of the show I was putting on my jacket and boyfriend was helping me get up so we could exit and Karen is just staring daggers at us, my boyfriend is trying really hard not to lose his patience with her and tells her Ma'am we have all the respect in the world for music, but she is injured and we tried to explain this to you multiple times. She just started screaming No excuses at us again (unfortunately Karen's reasonable friend had already left the theatre). Unfortunately for her I'm a fire sign and had had enough, I came to enjoy music not get harassed, so I told her the next time she is sick and injured I hope someone shows her at the least half the amount of empathy and compassion she lacks so she can learn a thing or two and to have the evening she deserves. My boyfriend helped me walk out of the theatre and we didn't see Karen again. ",4,1746254663.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,1,0.84,False

The DLC had the narrative flow, emotional weight, and meaningful mechanics that the base game promised but never fully delivered. It was what I wanted from the start: a focused, paced story with actual character development. It made me realize how much potential Forspoken had, and how backwards the overall structure felt.

And then it hit me that they could’ve had a true alternate ending that rewarded players making the choice to return home.

Imagine this:
If you choose to go home, Frey wakes up on her couch in New York. Homer is curled up next to her, purring, doing a little kitty stretch. On the coffee table lies a book titled Forspoken: The Tale of Athia—open like she fell asleep reading it. Before dismissing it as a dream trope cop-out, we have to keep in mind that some dreams can be truly transformative, not just mental-movies of our brains categorizing data.
So when she looks around, things are different. Her mundane world feels new or refreshed, because she’s changed. She sees potential where she once saw dead ends. This gives the voosh home actual weight instead of a narrative where she dismisses all her growth along the way, leaving Athia and it's people to ensured destruction. Because choosing to return to Homer should be fulfilling, and that can't happen when you have the annihilation of an entire people on your mind while petting Homer.

Alternatively, if you choose to stay and fight Susurrus?
Then it was all real. You’re the Hero of Athia, forging a future with Auden, mourning Robian, remembering Olivea. The dream wasn't a dream—it was destiny.

That would’ve been a true branching finale.
No ""bad"" ending. No magical telepathic reach-around/love-letter to Homer that made no damn sense. Just two realities, both valid, both powerful, reflecting who Frey has become based on what you chose.

Instead, we got a moment that pretends to be heartfelt but feels hollow. Like the story wanted to have it both ways and ended up giving us neither.

I loved Frey. I loved Cuff, even after the betrayal. Athia deserved more. And Homer? Homer deserved better than a voiceover into the void. By the time In Tanta We Trust was done, I was so amped to go to meet the Tanta of the Rheddig, but then the credits rolled. I truly wish this game got another chance.

1kdmlb3,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1kdmlb3/22m_no_friends_no_motivation_college_drop_out/,22m. No friends. No motivation. College drop out.,"Man I just want a few friends, part of a friend group again..
When in school, they teach you to be quiet. Sit down, do the work. scolded for talking. Nothing good to say don't say it at all. I think I internalized that and never really developed any social skills.. Had a few good friends in middle school during recess at lived in a lively suburb neighborhood with lots of kids.

- Moved to new town for highschool. Never really connected with anyone. Participated in class just fine. Coasted by highschool before covid. Watching tv on my phone in studyhall because I was not challenged. Content with my life being YouTube and videogames..
- Just before COVID I kind of ""snapped out"" of this, realized I need to change my life and be more social. Not being face to face with teachers and classmates really didn't help. I had a plan and really tried but still failed.
Journaled my life and looking back almost nothing has changed. 

- I fell for the advertising of a small University and found it had barely any decent clubs. Cliquey social atmosphere. Many terrible Part time professors barely teaching us.
Later computer science classes that start easy then throws us off the deep end with complexity. Lazy online modules. Endless soulless discussion boards..
Took my money and drive. 
- random roommate didn't want anything to do with me and barely talked.
- 2 years pretty much completely isolated despite really trying my best to get involved.
- learning literally nothing in business minor class for 8 weeks. Fed up trying to get involved.
- go to videogame group club playing Mario Kart on Switch (I've never had one so I suck) with strangers, in between a freshman trying to rizz up one of the two girls there.
- trying to fix my diet and some exercise I lost like 60 pounds.
- Made a lighthearted joke on one of the many school Instagram pages and they blocked my account. 
I didn't know about this and missed even more of the few opportunities they had for my major.
- frustration, isolation, weight loss and ADHD meds (led to my first) hypo-manic bipolar crash out and left.

Currently:
I'm making $13 retail. Midwest.
A lot of the time I feel like I have nothing to say. Nothing to add. Nothing in common. 
Or I'm not really interested. 
Do a lot of people just keep asking questions? Feign interest?
I can barely process what they're saying sometimes.. 

How to go deeper? 
How to build familiarly when your an anxious and depressed homebody in other places? Volunteer? Coffee shops? Clubs? Bars? I don't have the energy (or money.)

I've been clocking into my retail stocking job in grocery store produce dept. and it's all just basic pleasantries. I try to start something, joke around with the older folk the handful of times I'm invited to the conversation. 

I've literally got nothing to talk about; make comments on the state of the department.

Maybe I should have been more bubbly when I started. I was just struggling to learn the job and everyone's name.

It's been almost 10 months. 
Gained back a lot of the weight I lost with the help of ADHD meds.
 I'm an average stocky guy. Little short. 
Negative self talk. Anxious. 

Things are awkward. I know nothing about 2  new hires around my age in my department. Its been like two months+. Should I just be like:

""Hey, tell me about yourself?"" Randomly out of the blue? 
When we've all just been focusing on work.?
Even then they barely respond to me. I've stopped trying. I can barely even coordinate with them and it is almost like they avoid being in the backroom with me. Its awkward..

It's a little better with older people I seems. But I still struggle..
Older 40 something lady:
""Hey do you have any kids?""
""Nice hair, do they call that a bob right?""
(I know nothing about women.)
It's been so long wouldn't it be strange?

..

I tried to reconnect with an old friend in a similar place.
Although he never went to college. Smartest guy I know, got straight-A's in middle school. He fell into some hard substance abuse unbeknownst to me..

We played a lot of video games during that time before I moved away to different town and after.

I've kinda depressed and not really had interest in videogames for a year+. Even then it was solo gaming..
We don't really play the same types of games anymore. I've never touched Fallout or Elden Ring. 
He doesn't even have a mic. He drinks a lot. I don't.
Both lost. No friends. ""Losers"" I've kinda just ghosted when it came to gaming. It became so draining trying to talk, play, and understand Elden Ring with this multiplayer mod. It's laggy he isn't explaining anything.

Doesn't seem to have an interest in doing anything IRL.

It just isn't like it used to be playing games like Gmod together. Lost all skill haha..

Always making excuses for myself.. and my mental health hasn't been best.

I knew I had to be more social in college.. I took advantage of everything I could. Still sat alone in cafeteria 89% of the time. Tried to get into a few frats. Even though paying for friends doesn't seem right. One guy just met me and pretends like he knows me all my life immediately. Gets me to follow on instagram and we never talk again.
Played Jackbox with strangers a few times.. Shot hoops for the first time in 6 years. Couldn't make a single shot..
I tried man. I really tried. I feel like a social lombotomite after awhile man.


If I can't ""find my people"" in college will I ever?
I just feel so lost. 


70/120 college credits, some in business and math econ.
14k in loans.. I have no idea what major. I just don't have any drive anymore and am tired of writing essays. 
It's been ~ 2 years since I left. I feel like I don't remember anything. I didn't get anything out of it. 

Should I just give try and push through some college program at a community college that partners with a college for a 4 year degree?

I can't keep working.. ",1,1746254337.0,findapath,1,1.0,False

I was waiting at Ralph’s and an order came in for some sparkling water, 1 salad, 1 giant coffee creamer, and 11 Haagen Daz. Immediately my senses went up because I’ve seen multiple reports (ahem Long Island) and YouTube videos of people stealing that brand of ice cream in droves for resale. I honestly have no idea why. Then I realized the delivery was 700ft at an apt complex behind Ralph’s, 3rd floor. I was getting no other orders and there was a $6 tip so I took it, but still feeling uneasy. When I started shopping I realized it was a prepaid order through a secondary app.

Anyway, I get to the apt complex and you need the person’s last name to request to be buzzed in. There was no name on the order (as usual with prepaid/3rd party). Delivery instructions specifically said to ONLY go up to third floor and leave at door, and not to knock or ring doorbells, and do not leave out front. (Pretty common for me). So I message the customer asking for their last name.

They don’t respond so I call, get no answer and leave a voicemail. I wait and they message me back saying to just hit “delivery” because they can’t buzz me in. They said multiple times they were trying but it wasn’t working. I thought this was immediately weird, because how can you buzz me in if I never requested to be??? There was no way to search by apt to get buzzed in, only last name. I tried hitting delivery twice with no luck, it just rang. So again I asked for last name. They said to try a neighbor. I told them I just needed their last name and if it didn’t work I could try a neighbor. (Although technically I would need the neighbor’s name too). I actually mentioned that I was sorry, but it was a common scam. I’m not really sure if it is, it was just weird and I just needed their last name!

They completely ignored me and said to dial a neighbor. I said okay, just give me a second so I can talk to support by which they told me to NOT contact support. The last image was their response while I was waiting on support. They told me to try another apt number, clearly not knowing how the system works (I cannot pick a random number, there are only names). Anyway, support tried contacting them with no answer. Because I could not get into the building, they told me they would cancel the order, I would get paid, and to trash the groceries. I went back to Ralph’s and found a nice city worker getting off work and gave him the order. I’m unfortunately both vegan and extremely lactose intolerant so I’m glad I could make someone’s day and not waste so much food.

Have you guys experienced anything like this? My theory is that it was a stolen card, they had it delivered right next to the store so they could come grab it. They clearly did not live in that apt as they knew nothing about the system to get in. Perhaps they didn’t want to grab it from me for fear of being on camera. Or it’s possible they’re just really lazy and wanting 11 pints of ice cream?Idk, it honestly spooked me (especially as a female at 10pm) and I just went home after that.",7,1746254255.0,InstacartShoppers,20,0.89,False

Okay, this bag? \*Chef’s kiss\*. The retro hardware and tassel details are straight-up luxury vibes. It’s way roomier than I expected, and the adjustable strap is perfect for crossbody or shoulder wear. Lowkey obsessed with how it elevates even basic outfits. 9/10 for daily use!

When in school, they teach you to be quiet. Sit down, do the work. scolded for talking. Nothing good to say don't say it at all. I think I internalized that and never really developed any social skills.. Had a few good friends in middle school during recess at lived in a lively suburb neighborhood with lots of kids.

- Moved to new town for highschool. Never really connected with anyone. Participated in class just fine. Coasted by highschool before covid. Watching tv on my phone in studyhall because I was not challenged. Content with my life being YouTube and videogames..
- Just before COVID I kind of ""snapped out"" of this, realized I need to change my life and be more social. Not being face to face with teachers and classmates really didn't help. I had a plan and really tried but still failed.
Journaled my life and looking back almost nothing has changed. 

- I fell for the advertising of a small University and found it had barely any decent clubs. Cliquey social atmosphere. Many terrible Part time professors barely teaching us.
Later computer science classes that start easy then throws us off the deep end with complexity. Lazy online modules. Endless soulless discussion boards..
Took my money and drive. 
- random roommate didn't want anything to do with me and barely talked.
- 2 years pretty much completely isolated despite really trying my best to get involved.
- learning literally nothing in business minor class for 8 weeks. Fed up trying to get involved.
- go to videogame group club playing Mario Kart on Switch (I've never had one so I suck) with strangers, in between a freshman trying to rizz up one of the two girls there.
- trying to fix my diet and some exercise I lost like 60 pounds.
- Made a lighthearted joke on one of the many school Instagram pages and they blocked my account. 
I didn't know about this and missed even more of the few opportunities they had for my major.
- frustration, isolation, weight loss and ADHD meds (led to my first) hypo-manic bipolar crash out and left.

Currently:
I'm making $13 retail. Midwest.
A lot of the time I feel like I have nothing to say. Nothing to add. Nothing in common. 
Or I'm not really interested. 
Do a lot of people just keep asking questions? Feign interest?
I can barely process what they're saying sometimes.. 

How to go deeper? 
How to build familiarly when your an anxious and depressed homebody in other places? Volunteer? Coffee shops? Clubs? Bars? I don't have the energy (or money.)

I've been clocking into my retail stocking job in grocery store produce dept. and it's all just basic pleasantries. I try to start something, joke around with the older folk the handful of times I'm invited to the conversation. 

I've literally got nothing to talk about; make comments on the state of the department.

Maybe I should have been more bubbly when I started. I was just struggling to learn the job and everyone's name.

It's been almost 10 months. 
Gained back a lot of the weight I lost with the help of ADHD meds.
 I'm an average stocky guy. Little short. 
Negative self talk. Anxious. 

Things are awkward. I know nothing about 2  new hires around my age in my department. Its been like two months+. Should I just be like:

""Hey, tell me about yourself?"" Randomly out of the blue? 
When we've all just been focusing on work.?

Even then they barely respond to me. I can barely even coordinate with them and it is almost like they avoid being in the backroom with me. Its awkward..

It's a little better with older people I seems. But I still struggle..
Older 40 something lady:
""Hey do you have any kids?""
""Nice hair, do they call that a bob right?""
(I know nothing about women.)
It's been so long wouldn't it be strange?

..

I tried to reconnect with an old friend in a similar place.
Although he never went to college. Smartest guy I know, got straight-A's in middle school. He fell into some hard substance abuse unbeknownst to me..

We played a lot of video games during that time before I moved away to different town and after.

I've kinda depressed and not really had interest in videogames for a year+. Even then it was solo gaming..
We don't really play the same types of games anymore. I've never touched Fallout or Elden Ring. 
He doesn't even have a mic. He drinks a lot. I don't.
Both lost. No friends. ""Losers"" I've kinda just ghosted when it came to gaming. It became so draining trying to talk, play, and understand Elden Ring with this multiplayer mod. It's laggy he isn't explaining anything.

Doesn't seem to have an interest in doing anything IRL.

It just isn't like it used to be playing games like Gmod together. Lost all skill haha..

Always making excuses for myself.. and my mental health hasn't been best.

I knew I had to be more social in college.. I took advantage of everything I could. Still sat alone in cafeteria 89% of the time. Tried to get into a few frats. Even though paying for friends doesn't seem right. One guy just met me and pretends like he knows me all my life immediately. Gets me to follow on instagram and we never talk again.
Played Jackbox with strangers a few times.. Shot hoops for the first time in 6 years. Couldn't make a single shot.
I tried man. I really tried. I feel like a social lombotomite after awhile man.

# Where can I learn ASL online for free?

My personal favorite is easily [http://www.lifeprint.com](http://www.lifeprint.com/) (which is mirrored at [http://asluniversity.com](http://asluniversity.com/) as well). The guy who built the site, Dr. Bill Vicars, is Deaf and is a phenomenal teacher. He teaches primarily west-coast dialect (California, Washington common signs) but makes mention of other dialects (east-coast, Texas) when he can. In addition to teaching vocabulary, he teaches about Deaf culture (more on this in a moment). His Youtube channel is https://youtube.com/@sign-language. Other notable resources are:

* [ASL That](https://www.youtube.com/@ASLTHAT) on Youtube
* [Handspeak.com](http://handspeak.com) and their ASL sign [lookup tool](https://www.handspeak.com/word/asl-eng/)
* [Oklahoma School for the Deaf](https://courses.osd.k12.ok.us/) offers free classes starting every spring and fall

# Where can I pay to learn ASL online?

* [http://www.signlanguage101.com/](http://www.signlanguage101.com/)
* [ASLpinnacle.com](http://aslpinnacle.com) [and their Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/aslpinnacle)
* [https://www.queerasl.com/](https://www.queerasl.com/) Donations are strongly recommended

# What's the sign for ... ?

The short answer is ""it depends."" Sometimes. It depends sometimes.

The long answer is that signs will vary. Signs can be different depending on region, as I mentioned before, so just because you see it one way doesn't mean that it's the *only* way. (Don't make this mistake; a lot of hearing students can get cocky and start correcting others.) Signs can also change depending on context. The signs for ""back"" in ""My back hurts"" and ""Let's go back home"" are completely different.

Also, this is very important: **ASL is not English!** It is its own language, as different from English as is Klingon. ASL has its own grammar structure, own idioms, own slang. Signs are also *not words* like in the English sense. Signs are a lot more about intent, concepts, and ideas. For example, if you're trying to learn how to sign ""Back off!"" I can promise you that you will not need any sign for ""back"" nor ""off."" You're learning how to speak, and think, in another language, and using English just won't do.

Now, with all that said, here are some online dictionaries (I suggest you look at them all so you're familiar with the different variations of your sign):

* [http://www.lifeprint.com/dictionary.htm](http://www.lifeprint.com/dictionary.htm) This dictionary has the added bonus of including the etymology for some signs.
* [https://www.signingsavvy.com/](https://www.signingsavvy.com/)
* [http://www.handspeak.com/word/](http://www.handspeak.com/word/)
* [startasl.com/american-sign-language-dictionary](https://www.startasl.com/american-sign-language-dictionary.html)

# Does it matter what hand I sign with?

Yes. Consistently use your main, dominant hand. If you're right-handed, use your right. If you're left-handed, use your left. If you're ambidextrous, then pick one and maintain it. Switching dominant hands while signing would be like alternating screaming and whispering while speaking.

# Are American Sign Language and British Sign Language the same?

Are English and Japanese the same? ASL is not English, so stop thinking of it like English! :) In fact, ASL is derived from French Sign Language, which evolved independently of British Sign Language, and the two are mostly different (in fact, less than 30% of the signs are even remotely similar). There are hundreds of sign languages in the world. Even in the United States, there are several distinct dialects of ASL, including Black ASL.

# Why do you keep capitalizing ""Deaf""?

We use ""little-d"" deaf to mean someone who physically can't hear well. We use ""big-D"" Deaf to mean someone who is *culturally deaf*. Now an interesting bit: someone who is Deaf does not have to be deaf, and someone who is deaf does not have to be Deaf! For instance, children of deaf adults (CODAs) are very often Deaf but hearing. Many people are physically deaf but aren't part of Deaf culture. It's about how a person self identifies and where their culture lies more than it does with anything physical.

# What's this ""Deaf Culture"" you keep mentioning?

It'd take me hours to explain it all, and I usually spread it over my entire 12-week class. In short, many deaf people, specifically those who identify as Deaf, live in a different culture than you do. Yes, they're from your country, they drink Starbucks and they sit in traffic, but they have their own distinct culture. Obviously this includes language (and communicating in real ASL is so different than talking in English that it's hard to describe), but that different method of communication, that different way of thinking, is only part of Deaf culture. Things that are normal in one culture can be very strange the another. (My favourite, probably, is talking with your mouth full. In hearing culture, that's a big no-no and your mother will look at you very cross. In Deaf culture, that's totally acceptable! Stuff your face and then free your hands for conversation, it's great! So much more efficient!) Morality and ethics are shaped by our cultural values. There are aspects of Deaf culture which would be considered blunt or rude in hearing culture, and conversely there are a lot of things normal in hearing culture which are strange or disrespectful in Deaf culture (such as talking to someone's back, or looking around during a conversation). It's important to be aware of and respectful of other cultures, including Deaf culture, and, when possible, to learn about them. Not only will it ingratiate you to people of that culture, but it'll better yourself as a person as well.

# Isn't it wrong to say ""deaf""? Shouldn't I say ""hearing impaired"" or ""hard of hearing""?

Nope, and nope. Now, before I continue, I'll let you know that not everyone agrees with me, and I'm speaking in a *general* sense. Big-D Deaf people prefer the term ""deaf"" above any other. (It's how a US Senator might feel being called ""American."" Some people would take it as an insult, but it's just a matter of fact or pride for the Senator.)

Whether people identify themselves as ""deaf"" or ""hard of hearing"" (often seen as HoH) is often a matter of self identity, and while it can correlate to level of ability to hear, it isn't caused by it. I'll explain later. Deafies who are a part of Deaf culture will almost always call themselves ""deaf,"" and those who aren't a part of Deaf culture will usually go by ""hard of hearing"" (or more rarely ""hearing impaired""). In general, those who are less physically deaf, or who were raised strictly in hearing culture, will tend to gravitate toward hearing culture, despite the numerous difficulties. These people will commonly say they are ""hard of hearing"" since ""deaf"" still has a social stigma in hearing culture. Those who are less capable of integrating with hearing culture, or who were introduced to or raised in a Deaf environment, will usually prefer to be called ""deaf"" and can sometimes take one of the other terms as a slight offense.

In general, it's almost never correct to say ""hearing impaired."" I was taught that it was coined by a US Senator who wanted to protect deaf people's feelings from something that didn't offend them in the first place, and it was never accepted by Deaf (the core reason being that we don't believe being deaf is an impairment; it'd be like if I said you were ""Deaf impaired."" You don't feel impaired, do you, however much I might think it's true?) in general. In fact, it's safe if you never use this phrase again.

When in doubt though, just ask! ""Hey, do you prefer 'deaf' or 'hard of hearing'?"" See, it's not that hard. :)

# I saw a sign that looks like this ..., what does it mean?

We're happy to help with these kinds of questions. I treat it like a quiz show game. However, if you're new to this, you may not know how to describe a sign very well, so let me introduce you to signs!

A sign consists of five parts:

1. Hand shape: Are the fingers making an ""O""? Were the thumb and middle-finger touching? If you know some basic ASL, you can use hand shape identifiers, such as ""A hand shape"" or ""8 hand shape"".
2. Position: Where in relation to the body was the sign? Near the chest? Near the eyes? Was the palm facing up, down, toward the signer?
3. Movement: How did the sign move or change? Was it pushing away from the body? Was it a small circle in space?
4. Non-manual markers: What else was happening with the signer's body? What did her face look like? Was he moving his body, or shrugging? What was the emotion the signer was portraying?
5. Context: What else was happening before or after the sign. Were there other signs you recognized? Do you know the subject that the signer was communicating about?

# Where can I find a Deaf group in my area?

Where's your area? Most major cities have Deaf hubs. San Francisco, Seattle, Austin, and New York all have strong, vibrant, rich Deaf communities. Smaller cities may have meet ups or the like, but they can be harder to track down. Your best bet is to turn to Google or Facebook and search for Deaf events in your area. ""Deaf coffee night"" is an event held nationwide. People in the community get together for a night or two each month, usually at a coffee shop with good lighting and ample seating, just for the purpose of seeing friends and making new ones. Local colleges or universities will often have ASL/Deaf clubs and usually host student-friendly ASL events, so check with the ASL teachers or the ASL campus group, if it exists.

# Can I still ask questions here?

Yes! Yes! 1000 times yes! Many of us are here to help, and anything we can do to help teach you about the language and the culture we're happy to do.

# Will you do my homework for me?

Nope. Nope. 1000 times nope. It's obvious when students are looking for someone to do their homework for them, and we're not gonna help you out. If you're here to learn instead, then welcome! Come make some new friends. :)",3,1746253205.0,asl,2,1.0,False

Okay, this bag? \*Chef’s kiss\*. The retro hardware and tassel details are straight-up luxury vibes. It’s way roomier than I expected, and the adjustable strap is perfect for crossbody or shoulder wear. Lowkey obsessed with how it elevates even basic outfits. 9/10 for daily use!

This thing is THICK. The cotton quality surprised me, and the graphic hasn’t faded yet. Zero loose threads—feels like it’ll survive a zombie apocalypse. Perfect for grunge fits.

Hate to admit it, but… I’m kinda into these clown shoes? 😂 They’re stupid comfy, the sole stitching is art, and the secret 5cm lift? \*Chefs kiss\*. Downsides: 1) Shipping cost hurt my soul, 2) My friends roasted me. IDGAF though—they’re growing on me.

The ""I'm a Cool Mom"" ​​uniform she designed for Target. The cotton is so soft she ""accidentally"" ripped the tag off. Tip: If you forgot her birthday last year, get this.

Basic but iconic. The fabric is buttery soft, and black hides coffee spills like a champ. Runs TTS, but size up if you want that oversized gym-core look. Already my go-to for errands.

If cozy were a person, this is it. The fabric is heaven, and the logo print hasn’t cracked after two washes. Pro tip: Size up for that slouchy, streetwear aesthetic. Instant lazy-day uniform.
