Without missing a beat, he raises an eyebrow and says, ""Well, I've got a latte jokes if you're espresso-ly interested in hearing one.""

In January I found out my mom had lied about who my biological father was thanks to a cousin matched on 23&me and a half uncle on ancestry. My NMom has claimed quite literally my entire life that my birth certificate father had a DNA test done on me from infancy. However obviously she either lied or faked it. The only person who could allegedly prove her story (my BCFs lawyer) died in 2017 and she refuses to provide documentation for this test. She also claims my BF assaulted her, but she's changed her story multiple times and everyone else I talk to said they had an affair. I think the closest I'll ever get to the truth from her is when she said that if she knew he was my biological father, she wouldn't tell me. And I guess she didn't. Thank God websites like Ancestry exist.

Now today, I finally proved my brothers (same mom, different dads) grandfather isn't black like our NMom has claimed for a decade. She claims she met up with his biological grandfather back in 2014 and he was ""dark like coffee"". However after doing some digging on ancestry and talking to matches of my brothers, his biological grandfather is the walking definition of white male and he died in 2010. She didn't believe ancestry when my brothers results showed up 100% European. She's still holding onto the lie she met up with a man who abandoned his child at birth, never met his 5 grandchildren but for some reason met up with the mother of his youngest grandchild? 

Honestly I can't help but laugh. She has been caught in one of multiple lies, at least these we have definitive proof that she lied. However she is still sticking to her guns and tending like she is right. I don't understand the mentality of people like this. How can you have tangible proof in front of you and still deny it?",1,1748405243.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

Here’s my story: 
My husband and I live in an apartment with 8 units. My husband started getting huge hives all over his body and at the same time we started finding bed bugs around the house. None in our bed or bedroom, only in our kitchen and living room. In a matter of 3 days we started finding 8 live bugs walking in broad daylight. The landlord wasn’t doing anything about it. We decided to leave the apartment — dry heated some clothes on high, got butt naked in the parking lot, put clean clothes on and came straight to his grandparent’s house. (Thanks to ChatGPT for the plan). Got butt naked again before entering his grandparent’s house. We got the car treated a day later. 

We found out (by talking to a neighbor) that this has come from a neighboring unit - and she has had it for a year now. She left her apartment a week before we started getting bitten. What i’m thinking is they left her house because there’s no one to bite there anymore and made it to all neighboring units. Because apparently all our neighbors have them now. The landlord has called his friend to come and spray the apartments - as if that’s enough. We are talking to a lawyer and will sue his as* (sorry for the language. I have lost my mind.) 

We’ve been in this apartment for 10 months, everything we have is new and we want to put them all in the trash. I am reading about how to treat my huge collection of books because I am too sad to throw them away, but I will if it guarantees me a 100% freedom from these little monsters. It’s all just breaking my heart to be throwing my entire life away. 

We took out important documents and have them in sealed ziplock bags in his grandparent’s backyard. I want to keep them there as long as I can. 

I don’t know how to save other items like my laptop, tv, our VERY newly bought pillows, coffee tables, tv tables… They’re very new and we can’t afford to buy everything from scratch. Anything else will go…bed, mattress, couches, bar stools, shoes, towels…. 

Both of us are mentally losing it reading all these posts online. Those things hitch-hike and drying clothes or treating the car is still giving us anxiety because what if ONE survives? 

It’s our first time experiencing this. How do people get over this mentally? We are heat drying our clothes every day! We have bug traps all over his grandparent’s house. Are we safe? Will we be bed bug free again? I feel suicidal. ",1,1748405193.0,Bedbugs,1,1.0,False

1kx7mrq,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kx7mrq/ended_an_almost_2_year_relationship/,Ended an almost 2 year relationship,"I’m hurting, and I just want someone to listen. I don’t need responses.

Tl;dr! on bottom

I (28f) met a guy (31m) at a community event.

In my culture, it’s really common for young adults to get proposals for marriage. You view their picture, you hear details about them. If you’re interested, you meet up and get to know them. If both are happy and families are happy, then they get engaged and become married.

This man and I were told about the other person, but didn’t pursue it.

Fast forward, there was a community event and we met. We exchanged instagrams and were inseparable ever since. We had a lot of stuff in common. We talked a lot (either text/call/ft).

He told me he wanted to wait before he thought or agreed about being engaged. I was on board because I recently was in a relationship. I didn’t really like the cultural tradition of immediate marriage. I was born and raised in the west. It’s a foreign concept. I asked if dating is okay, and he said yes.

Over the course of 1 year and 8 months, I developed feelings for him. I never experienced love like this. But it felt one sided. I felt like I would want to do anything and everything for him, but I felt like an afterthought.

Throughout us talking, it never left the talking phase. He changed his mind about dating. He said he got hurt a lot and wanted to make sure the next person he was going to be with was his last person.

He would tell me constantly, me and him aren’t in a relationship, he can do anything and I can’t be mad because I agreed to doing this.

I felt really used by him as well. Always asking me for favours for work. And I did everything I could do to help him, even if it really was hard for me. I wanted to make his life easier. If I didn’t do something, or wasn’t able to, he would get extremely mad at me, say I was selfish. And then go back to normal the next day.

He made things really hard, he would make comments about girls, he would give me details of girls in his life and details about his ex-girlfriends. (sexual,physical,general). I never judged him for his past, but he had so many issues about my past, he would barely speak to me for months over one part of my past. He acted like my past was done against him.

I feel like he hurt me a lot but I chose to stay because I wanted to be with him.

He would tell me he wanted certain things done from me, it would “help him say yes”. Like favours, nudes, help for work, etc. but after all this time he still couldn’t tell me he wanted a relationship with me.

I would ask him every month or 2, if he thought about the relationship, he said no. It always ended in a fight. I wouldn’t go in fighting with him, he just would get angry.

If something was upsetting me that he did, he said I find faults in everything he does. Why should he keep talking if I find a fault in everything?

10 Months into our “situation” he was dealing with work and he was really upset, he took out his anger on me 3 different times in 3 different ways on the same day. He was 1) interrogating me about my exes. 2) he took his anger out on me during sex (I felt used) 3) he was saying bad stuff about my family. After that I started to see him completely differently. My feelings started to fade.

He said he’ll be there for me always, I’m the type of person that I don’t need anything from anyone, I don’t talk about my problems, I don’t ask to be comforted. I just deal with it. But I saw how he was for other girls in his life (he would go out of his way to meet up with friends and grab coffee/bubble tea so they feel better). I didn’t need for him to buy me anything, I just wanted him on the phone to listen to me and I just wanted to feel cared for. He acted uninterested and would barely say anything. I wish I didn’t tell him anything at all.

Then it was followed by nothing was going right in his life, so he wouldn’t come see me for 3 months. When he did eventually come to see me, it didn’t feel like same, he would be very secretive with his phone but I always had to let him see my phone.

He didn’t follow through with his promises. Over time I started getting angry instead of hurt/upset. He would say I always get mad for everything.

These past few weeks, I asked him again, if he thought about us. 2 weeks ago he said no. Yesterday he didn’t even respond, he just turned his back to me. I was trying to hold it together but my eyes were watering.

I just wanted him to love me. I want someone to be my best friend. I don’t need materialistic relationship. I just want someone I know without a doubt he loves me and he always thinks of me and how his actions affect me.

For the past few months, I talked to chat ai to help break it off with him. It was a mental hurdle. I was going to end it if it reached 2 years without a relationship. I didn’t need an engagement. I just wanted a relationship. But the ignoring me when I was asking him the status of him deciding, it pushed me over the edge.

I just ended things now. My heart was pounding, he was upset. I made sure not to blame him on anything. I just told him, it’s just talking too long to still be in the phase. I was crying so much.

I just keep telling myself, it’s only hard now, it will be better later on. You’ll be miserable if you keep being in this same place.

But I’m hurting. Why wasn’t I good enough for him?

Thank you for listening.

I would say they’ve been together for about 3 months.  Long enough to both know they are interested but still quite new. We were at dinner and I was doing what any good friend would do asking questions about new boyfriend and what he enjoys about their time together etc etc? Showing interest in my friend’s life. Bully. 

At one point he asks if I want to see a picture, I say sure and he pulls up an instagram profile, and let’s just say he wasn’t short on options. It was an onslaught of gym/bathroom/bed/ morning coffee/office desk selfies. And while I fully take someone’s social media persona with a grain of salt, I think there was little ambiguity about what this guy wanted to communicate. 

Now, we are in our mid 30s, and while my wish is to affirm and celebrate, I cannot help but be a little critical and concerned about who this person is portraying. I will admit, there is a base level of judgement. I just think it’s weird and a little sad. But that’s my baggage. Zooming out I worry a little bit about this persons need for attention and potentially even maturity?

I left it at ‘I’m happy for you and I hope the relationship continues to grow.’ Ultimately I haven’t met this person and my friend seems excited. But internally I’m raising an eyebrow.

I fully own that at its core it’s just not something I would do, perhaps because I lack that confidence, or some other reason. But I was wondering, given how common this seems to be now, how others feel about it and how might you advise a friend if asked? Am I just being a hater?

You were 28 and I was 19 when we met. I was a fresh college student when you came through my lane at the grocery store that I worked at. I thought you were so handsome, charming. Six months went by and I finally saw you again, I nervously scribbled my number on the back of your receipt and told you:

""Your gonna want to keep that"". 

You turned it over and saw my number, your eyebrows shot up in surprise. I didn't think you would text me. But you did. 

The first two weeks were insane. You seemed like an amazing ""boyfriend"". But then you quickly got distant. Over the years I felt like I had to fight for your attention and love. I loved you and wanted you to love me. Even when you cheated, lied, played with my emotions, and even when you didn't want to go to my father's funeral with me. You took pieces of me, little by little. And I am no better, because I let you do it. 

I always thought I'd go back to you. But every time I did, something would hurt me in some way. Eventually I just became numb, a shell of the independent woman I was. I knew you were never going to love me, move in with me despite my advances, marry me...

I eventually gave up. 

A year and a half ago you came back again, wanting us to work out. You had grown up and became mostly a better person but we were no good for each other. We brought out the worst in each other. 

You wanted to talk things through, so I met you at a coffee shop. Somewhere public because we always ended up having sex. It was the thing that bonded us. 

Somehow, dispite the numbness, you struck a chord while trying to talk about the past. I was crying and needed to leave because I hated crying in public. 

We went to my place. I was so emotionally drained so of course we defaulted to sex. 

After that you thought we were dating. But we had never actually defined that. And that became very apparent when we were hanging out a few weeks after that when some kid I was friends with was texting me. 

You got jealous, I told you I'm not interested in him or anyone, or dating in general. 

""But WE'RE dating.."" you looked betrayed. 

I told you that we had never talked about that. 

And I saw you break. For the first time I saw you break down and cry. I comforted you the best I could. But afterwards when I was home, I couldn't help but feel like what just happened was manipulative. 

I finally texted you that I never wanted to see you again. I said some things that I had held in for years. I called you a narcissist. Mentioned every hurt, every piece you took. I was factual, but also cruel. 

And I moved on. 

And so did you. 

It's been a year and a half and out of nowhere I see you. You're dating someone now, she has kids and is a nurse like you. Your dad just died and for that I'm sorry. I know he was sick for so long. 

You live with her. And in the obituary it says ""accepted grandchildren"".... 

I remember you telling me how your family wouldn't approve of us living together after 4 years of dating. I remember you telling me that you didn't want kids... 

I don't want to be with you. But it still hurts. 

Even now, I wanted to send flowers for your father. But I won't. I don't believe in God, but I pray to some cosmic being that you get all the happiness in world that we were never allowed to have. I pray that you have a long happy life with good fortune, that you feel fulfilled in life, that you don't suffer too long with the loss of your father, that you get married and feel loved by your girlfriend, and that you get to be the best dad to her kids. And I pray to fucking God that you never know that I wish that for you, because I am your past. 

And life moves on.

1kx7ffm,https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/1kx7ffm/is_it_just_me_or_is_kaneki_terrible_against_very/,Is it just me or is Kaneki terrible against very good survivors?,"Against newer or average survivors Kaneki is a very strong killer that can easily injure 3-4 people in seconds while being able to destroy survivors in chases. You can prove that by playing against bots or lower mmr players, it's extremely hard to lose those matches. 

Now, against good players with thousands of hours in swfs, seriously, I've never felt so frustrated playing a videogame. It is just unfair. Unless you're yourself a godtier player, you're just going to feel like shit for getting 0 kills in five matches in a row while trying your best. Not every player HAS to ''git gud'', some people just want to have fun playing a few matches every day with their favorite killer, but that just turns into a terrible experience.

I could argue that ''swfs are too strong'', or that ''there are too many pallets close to each other"", or any other argument people talk about every single day, but dude, I just wish my power wouldn't go on cooldown after breaking a pallet, seriously, it's that simple.

Good survivors will loop you around a pallet for as long as they can, drop them, then run to the next pallet and repeat, in the meanwhile, there are at least two (or three) other players doing objectives or free to do so. ""Just vault the pallet, bro"", sure, the survivor will just keep looping me around that pallet until I break it anyways, unless either they fuck up, or it is one of the few loops I can actually get to them before they vault again, it is not consistent. If I break the pallet, they'll use the time to reach another pallet, or a place with two to three nearby windows.

""Just git gud, bro"", that is not a valid argument when the game is placing me against survivors far beyond my skill level, or people whining about the killer because it is ''too op'' against new players, there is hardly a balance, it either feels very strong, or very weak, depending on who you get matched against. Sure, the ghoul can easily injure survivors, but if they're very good, you'll spend minutes trying to finish the job, while the rest of the survivors win the game.

Matchmaking is complicated, I'm aware of that, so I just wish the power wouldn't go on cooldown after breaking a pallet, it feels terrible, and by the time I have my power again, I'm breaking another pallet, so I'm either forced to drop the chase and get nothing, or keep chasing and have this happen again on another survivor. If I vault, I'm not getting a hit most of the time due to the slowdown, so I'll waste even more time on a loop that should be over with. Very few of his add-ons are actually useful in non hyper-specific builds, like Centipede, Coffee, or Handkerchief, the others are just not usable in 90% of matches. Perks that buff vault speed do not affect his power, so you can't vault a window or pallet faster with it.

The only way I can think of that would make this killer more viable against very good swfs is either making perks affect vault speed in his power, making it faster or with less downtime by default, or making his power NOT go on cooldown after you break a pallet, this way the killer can actually use his power in chases before the survivor reaches the next pallet and repeats the process again. Newer players will have a harder time, but they already do, so that won't change much for them, because they don't reach the next pallet in time consistently, but against good players, that might just give average players a better fighting chance, instead of being forced to watch yet another swf getting out without a single kill.

Any other solution to this that doesn't involve changing or buffing the ghoul would have to affect the matchmaking or loop structure overall, that isn't viable and would affect other killers in unpredictable ways, so that is my solution to this problem. Does anybody else feel this way lately? I'm having the worst time of my life just trying to play the game with the killer I have the most fun, and there doesn't seem to be a consensus around a good counter to this problem other than ''git gud'', which doesn't fucking explain a thing.

1kx7cfz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Felons/comments/1kx7cfz/a_free_easy_business_for_felons/,A FREE Easy Business for Felons,"I was going to do this immediately upon release but my life has gone in a different direction so I hope someone else gets some use out of this obvious business concept 

In prison I’m sure you saw people making cheesecakes, rather from creamer, or powdered milk, real cheese, crème from the insides of duplex cookies, and whatever else. If you have no idea what I’m talking about, it’s just a fake cake made from 80% creamer that you don’t have to bake or even use real cheese. And it’s delicious 

In prison you are limited by the ingredients you can get, but on the streets you have everything at your disposal

You could use similar ingredients, but in the spirit of reducing costs as much as possible, we’re not going to use real coffee creamer

Instead you buy bulk vegetable shortening for baking, which is the same crap they use in creamer anyways. It’s basically Crisco. This will be your fat, no cheese needed

For the “body” of your cheesecake you have a few options, and I will note that this is just my theory-oh and nothing I’ve done IRL. I think a combination of rice flour and gelatin would be your best bet. Rice flour will provide chewiness, weight, and a good neutral flavor profile. Imagine cooking rice but overcooking it and not using enough water, that’s what it will turn out like. The gelatin is to balance that out, and is more light and fluffy. The ratio might be 70% gelatin for a light “cheesecake”, or much lower if you want to create something like a pie or heavy crème cake. Both of these ingredients cost nickels. 

Then you have sugar, and whatever flavoring you want to add. If I was to do this, I would be using drink packets like we had in prison. For example, a Hawaiian Punch lemon drink mix creates a lemon crème cake. A strawberry drink mix makes a “made with real strawberries” strawberry cake. You could do all sorts of different flavors, and adjust the amount of real sugar to the sweetness of the drink packets. 

And for the record, I’m not into having illegal business practices. If you state you use real fruit, you need to use at least one strawberry per whole cake. Could you be sued? Sure, I guess, if someone sent your cake to a laboratory. More on this later

After your cake filling is made using your food processor/blender, you need to make a crust. You don’t want to have to use an actual oven because that’s an extra step, so just buy the cheapest crackers you can find, add a small amount of water, sugar, and Crisco, add to your food processor and you’re off. It won’t be hard like a normal crust, but it will harder up as it dehydrates over time. Lay this down in a plastic bowl with tinfoil wrapped over the bowl, fill it up with filling, and remove the complete product with tinfoil from the plastic bowl. Stick in your fridge for a day or whatever and it should be good to go. 

Now you have a home made cake, ready to sell at your food cart, roadside stand, festival, or anything you can think of. You will 3-4x your money on every cake sold, and you will have a delicious, cancerous yet affordable treat. You can play with the ingredients a lot to create different textures, flavors, and reduce costs as well. 

Can’t guarantee you won’t be fined by the city for violating food cart ordinances and shit, but I can guarantee you won’t be indicted and that’s all we really care about.

I was side swiped in a hit and run accident and when I called him he was most concerned about getting a police report,"So today I was side swiped by a pickup truck while I was sitting on the right hand lane in traffic. I was making a right turn onto the expressway and the right lane was backed up. A guy flew down the left lane swiping my car and taking out my left side mirror. He didn’t stop. My first thought was “My husband is going to be so mad. Because all he talks about is money. I was able to get a picture of the truck but it was too far away to pick up the plates unfortunately. I did get the make model and color. But the police weren’t able to get a camera shot of it
The real problem is my relationship with my husband. I was not hurt, but when I called him he didn’t even ask me. I was shaken up pretty bad and then I had to find the police station and it took forever 
I got home a few minutes before my husband and he ripped into me saying that I yelled at him (I know he was speaking to me in a mean voice). Then he proceeded to tell me that the reason he hasn’t had sex with me in 15 years is because I am nasty to him and yell at him all the time. Keep in mind that the kids (who are now 21 and 25) have had to stay in motels numerous times over the years because he drinks and gets really mean and scary. Yet he says he never yells. I’m an attractive woman who I feel has wasted my life on him because I feel guilty for being a SAHM. He would have to give me half of everything. That’s the biggest reason I haven’t left. He’s obsessed with money. We own 2 houses. I worked in business for the first 5 years we were married and then we had our son 
I know he doesn’t love me. He pretended to be interested in the same music as me etc. to get me to date him. He love bombed me over a long time. He doesn’t want to lose any money by divorcing me. I’m desperate to be free of this relationship! It’s literally killing me. He agreed with me staying home and now he holds it against me
I have brought up the no sex thing about 10X over the last 7 years. He has no interest. I know he doesn’t have a girlfriend. I brought it up again yesterday and I think that is why he is using that. Again, I am an older (56) but attractive woman and I take good care of myself 
I am afraid of his temper and don’t know how to proceed 
He did an odd thing this morning as well. Our 21 year old daughter was home for the weekend and left early this morning. He made her coffee and gave her my only travel mug which I just got back. Because I left it at a home where I was dog sitting. I get paid to stay with dogs in their homes. I told him I was glad that I found it and he literally gives it to our daughter the next day so she could have coffee on her hour long drive back to college. She drinks Starbucks every day. I have never spent money on Starbucks in my life

Please help me! Ask me questions as I know this is long and confusing. I will clarify. I’m locked in my son’s old bedroom rn. That’s another issue.

I lived in an apartment with black mold for 7 months and moved out in September. What led to all of this was, two months into living there, I started to get eczema. Nothing crazy, just a tiny speck on my neck. I used a steroid cream to get rid of it. But over the next few months, it only got worse… spreading to my hands, arms, legs, face, etc. Pretty miserable and terrifying, especially since I live a really healthy lifestyle, and all of this felt so out of nowhere.

I’ve had a few friends who dealt with black mold and got sick from it. After ruling out so many other things (and even putting myself on an extreme diet—no caffeine, alcohol, processed sugar, high-histamine foods, gluten, dairy), my symptoms improved a bit, but eczema kept popping up in new areas. Eventually, I got my place tested and the inspector found black mold. Huge relief, honestly finally understood why my health was in such a bad place.

Long story short: landlord “remediated,” didn’t do a good job, I moved back in, and symptoms came back 10x worse. I ended up getting out of my lease.

I felt good for about 6 months after moving out. For the most part, I was doing better. Detoxing regularly—sauna 5x a week, glutathione IVs, monthly colonics, avoiding trigger foods (but slowly reintroducing some because eating that strict long-term isn’t realistic), and taking zinc, vitamin C, spore-based probiotics, magnesium, binders… the whole thing.

To calm down the stubborn eczema, I tried UVB treatment. It doesn’t heal the root cause, but the itching was driving me nuts.

Then, end of March, my eczema slowly started creeping back. It’s showing up in new places and returning in old spots. I’m still so new to all this—is that normal? I know eczema can be triggered by so many different things. My biggest triggers are processed sugar, alcohol, and coffee. Which obviously SUCKS. So I’m back on an elimination diet just to try to calm my symptoms down again.

I’ve tried all the creams, etc. But what are some holistic things *you* have done for mold toxicity and eczema that actually helped? Doctors haven’t been super helpful. I’m considering seeing a functional medicine doctor, but it’s hard to find someone who actually knows their shit.

🟢 Sold **digital planners** on Etsy using free Canva templates  
🟢 Found a **remote virtual assistant** job through Reddit

FFF/ff, Consensual, Slavery, Bondage, Humiliation. Part 3. Nora Makes Sheila Do A Sequel To Her ""Blowjob Interview"". Sandy Finally Gets Her Revenge On Cindy, And Her Watch Back. Slave Cindy.","Sandy's perspective-Ari's Mansion

Dumps like a truck. Big porn star breasts. Ridiculous botox duck lips. My best friend has eagerly turned my sister and her other mentor into obscene NSFW cartoon porn stars. I try to tell myself it is for the mission. Like striding around Ari's as a domme again. But that feels weird and a slap in the face to them, too.

See, as soon as Nora found out about bio-gel filler, there was no stopping her into sculpting our slaves into obscene caricatures of themselves. Her rationale was since it wasn't surgery, was temporary, and easily reversible there shouldn't be an issue. And of course it was convincing to Ari how we just saw our former friends as ""our little moneymakers"" now. All good reasons, but I think it's just Nora's inner sadist coming out. She has to punish ""her girls"" for daring to defy her, even for the moment, about the lip filler injections. Punishing them I can understand. But obscenely deforming them, like Ari seems way too far. Again I wonder if taking down Ari is futile, when sometimes it seems we are literally creating a new one to replace her.

Right now she's forcing Sheila to do a sequel to the Blowjob Interview. She thought it was hilarious Wendy Chang aka Slave DASS (Dumb Ass Slope Slut) is usually only allowed to quack, and imposed the same restrictions on Border Bunny and Slave Head, aka Sheila.

Speaking of Border Bunny, she's going to be part of the interview. Tied face down to a table head hanging over, in front of them Nora is making Slave Head quack and gurgle around a dick for her interview. Layla got mouthy to day, so Nora overstuffed the poor girl's mouth with dirty panties eagerly supplied by Ari's minions, and sealed it shut with two around the head winds of duct tape. Also several dudes are lined up to fuck her pussy and obscenely augmented brown butt. Sheila is wearing her zipper hood, arms bindered behind her back and of course, other wise nude. Sheila is hooded, Layla isn't, so Nora can pull her head up by the hair during the interview.

Nora is wearing the standard domme outfit of peaked cap, black blouse, black silver studded skirt, black fishnet and Prada heels.

Sheila is slobbing some white dude's ten inch schlong.  Nora will ask her a series of questions, with one quack for yes, and two for no. Of course all her answers are scripted, and Mistress drilled the script into her with her usual casual brutality. Nipple flicks, slaps upside the head and rolling up the paper script to slap Sheila across the face with.

I'm watching, rapt on the monitor, in one of the observation rooms set up specially for us. I want to turn away, but I can't just yet. I'm fighting PTSD and flashbacks from my own trauma here, it doesn't help that my best friend kind of looks like a younger version of Ari, as well as behaving like her. Ruthlessly humiliating two brave women who took her under their wings when she was just a little blond waif.

The only bright spot is Logan. He survived the gunshot wound and ended up working for Dave. He's technically my bodyguard. Despite Ari's assurances that we're allies now and her casa is our casa, Dave doesn't want any of us walking around alone here. Guess who's always flouting that? Little Miss Nora, getting way to chummy with some of Ari's minions, and even Ari herself.

Anyway, Dommes generally aren't allowed to carry weapons beyond the standard whips, crops, and other tools of the BDSM trade around Ari's mansion. Ari of course magnanimously allowed us to bring our own security. They can't carry guns, but they can carry ASP batons and pepper spray.

When I found out Logan was working security for Dave, I insisted he be my bodyguard. Dave was dubious, he respected the young man for helping fight our way out of here last time. But he wasn't sure I wouldn't end up being the one having to save Logan again if something hit the fan.

I brought up the point, like me, having been here before, he was the best choice as a personal bodyguard going back in. Logan clinched it by looking him in the eye and saying ""Mr. Henson, the only way anyone is hurting a hair on this little lady's head is over my dead body, swear to God, sir."" Dave looked at him long and hard for awhile. Logan twitched a little nervously but didn't break eye contact. Then he stated ""Young man, I really believe you. Normally my little princess here gets her way, as I'm sure you know. I was prepared to override her on this. No offense, young man, but I had to take into account the part of her story where your old buddies made you freeze up at a critical moment.""

""But I've seen you grow and mature. I'm not expecting trouble at Ari's while she believes in our supposed new alliance. But if it happens I think you two will be a good team."" His head swung back and forth between us with a stern expression.

""No stupid heroics, either of you. If something does happen, run or hide and call for backup, no fighting unless you have no other choice."" I noticed he was looking pointedly at me, not Logan. We both affirmed our assent. We left Ari's in a fighting retreat last time, we both believed we could do it again. I ran around the desk to kiss his cheek and say ""Thank you, Daddy Dave, you're the best!"" Much to the embarrassment of both men.
Yeah, Logan knows about Dave and I. You might be thinking his old crush on me could be a liability. It's a fair point. But both Dave and I agreed he'd matured enough since our escape it wouldn't be an issue. He accepted what was, while remaining a good friend.

Too his credit, he was pointedly not looking at the screen, even though I couldn't blame him for doing so. The crude violation of two hottie subs abetted by a younger hot blondie domme would be tempting for any young man. But he was watching NASCAR videos on his phone while monitoring the door to our little observation nook. Since coming back here, he'd shown nothing but clear disgust for the slave trade he used to participate in so readily.

I knew the feeling. Though as much as I hated how this mission brought out Nora's cruel side to the two women who probably loved her the most...it was still a little...tittilating.

Mistress Nora: Slave Head, are you enjoying your demotion back to where you started, Bottom Slave interviewing with your mouth around a dick?

(Sheila has been licking the huge cock from base to head, swirling her tongue around the glans. Her eyes shift nervously to Mistress Nora)

Sheila: Quack.

(The guy forcefully turns her head back to his dick and pushes it between her huge botox lips)
Nora: Do you ever deserve to be in a position of leadership in the Fetish world again?

Sheila: (Muffled) Squack (Gurgling) quack.

(Despite a guy's big dick in her mouth making her slobber and gag, her eyes are locked on Mistress Nora)

Nora: Do you like your body mods?

Sheila (Gogle, eeeeep, slurp) Quack. 

Nora: Is Mistress Nora the best Mistress you've ever had?

Sheila: Quack! (Muffled by the guys dick, she still tries to sound as eager as possible. She actually blows a couple of saliva bubbles on the guys shaft inadvertently).

(Nora giggles and grabs Border Bunny's head by the hair, pulling it up roughly. I can see where her bio-gel filled breasts are squashed cruelly against the table. It has to hurt. Her cheeks are bulged like a nasty squirrel, and you can see the outline of her botox lips through the white duct tape double wrapped around her head. The pained look on her face makes me certain the guy behind her is sodomizing her)

Nora: Slave Border Bunny, how do you like being a nasty little Beaner Blow Up doll?

I've had enough. I'm going to the kitchen for Carmelita's coffee. I insisted our observation nook be right down the hall from the kitchen, so we could get food and drinks from Carm easily. And of course so I could catch up with my old guardian angel and protector. I stand up.

""Logan, I'm getting a cup of coffee from the kitchen, do you want anything?"" Logan lowers his phone. ""Either ring for a servant or let me go with you. You know Mr. Henson don't want you going no where here alone, Sandy.""

I put my hands on my hips. ""Logan, you know Carm is shorthanded today, all the servants are cooking or serving, and she doesn't have a kitchen slave. It's right down the hall. Don't argue with me, Mister! Constance and Lara told you an order from me is like an order from one of them. You can only override it if there's a clear and present danger. There isn't any, so sit your butt down and watch your NASCAR!""

He looks ready to object, but closes his mouth at my glare. He sits back and says ""Holler or call me if there's trouble."" I nod ""I will, Logan.""  I walk out.

When I say right down the hall, the scale is a little different in Southern Mansions, more like two blocks, still not far.

It seems like the trip will be uneventful until Cindy steps out of the back kitchen door in ladies cowboy boots, jeans and a white blouse. At first she seems as shocked to see me as I am to see her. Then my old Mistress folds her arms and smirks.

""Well it's about time you showed up, slave. I've been having to get my own donuts and coffee all day. Get in there, strip, and get gaffled up by Carmelita, slave. Maybe if you're quick I won't punish you.""

I goggle at this dumb bitch for a long moment. I always knew this bitch was stupid and clueless (Though smarter than Joey, obviously) But is she really this stupid and clueless? Or is she making a dumb joke? Then I see my black Gucci watch on her wrist, the one she took from me when I was made her slave.  Suddenly it doesn't matter anymore. I start advancing on her.

""Cindy, give me my watch back. This is the only time I'm going to ask nicely."" She starts backing up until she's cornered herself against a wall. Suddenly she realizes I'm not gaffled up, and we both know I can take her in a fair fight.

""Uh, Sandy, maybe we can-"" Then we both see Carmelita and two servants step out of the kitchen to watch us. She yells ""Carmelita, call security or send a runner, qyickly!"" The two servants make as if to act as runners. Carmelita holds her hand up to stop them and keeps quietly watching us. Cindy's eyes widen in shock.

Her eyes focus on me when I say: ""Cindy, you have to a count of three to give me my watch back, one-"" Then I bounce my famous Sandy Left Hook off her jaw. Not fair at all, but when was she ever fair to me? I've sent strapping boys twice my size to the ground with that hook, a fluff wimp like Cindy crumples to the ground like a used Styrofoam cup. My knuckles sting a little but I've never felt finer.

Carmelita has her phone out. ""Mistress Ari say good shot, Mistress Sandy."" I look around and spy the security camera she was probably monitoring us on. Of course, the cunt was watching. I wonder if she set this up for her amusement. Probably, she did, though Cindy's look of suprise when she saw me seems to indicate she wasn't in on it.

""Drag her into the store room with the cot and call the nurse. If she's medically cleared, strip her naked and rig her up as a kitchen slave. Mistress Ari say Cindy graciously volunteer to be kitchen slave today.""

I wince. I feel a little bad for her, and wonder how long her temporary kitchen slave gig will be. Ari told me my gig was temporary, and I ended up doing two fucking years and a bit of change.

Then I realize, I don't fucking care. Just like me, Cindy had plenty of time to realize she was playing with fire when she works for Ari. Now just like me, she's getting burned. Karma, bitch. I can't be the bigger woman. Not today. ""This slave has something that belongs to me.""

I say it to Carmelita, knowing I'm talking to Ari. Carm looks at her phone and nods. ""Mistress Ari say feel free to recover it."" I crouch down, take the watch off her right wrist, and put it on mine. This day is looking up already!

The two servants grab Cindy and drag her off. Maybe she'll get lucky and I gave her a concussion. She'll have to rest, and hopefully for her Ari will forget about making her the kitchen slave. I really hope not.

Carm looks at me. ""Come in kitchen, I got coffee made for you and the boy. If Slave is  cleared I send her down with Carne Asada for you and boy. If not, I bring them myself. Either way, you're both still too skinny, need to eat!""

I walk into the kitchen with her. When we get to a spot we know there are no cameras she hugs me. ""My little girl, big deal now. Gonna have rich man's baby soon. Do a lot of good things. Don't forget God spared you for a reason,  Chiquita.""

I just hug her back, long and hard. Whenever I slipped into darkness and despair as a slave, she always brought me back to the light. She still has that talent.

Forty minutes later.

Two of the assholes that fucked Layla are now playing a game of spades on her back while she's still tied and gagged facedown to the table. Couple of dicks. I guess literally.

Against the tape sealing her mouth the fucked out Hispanic girl moans. Sounds like no one is really home in that lovely noggin for the moment. One of the guys swats her naked bio-gel bloated rump. ""Shut it, sweetheart, you're disturbing my concentration."" The pretty Mexican goes silent, even dazed, Nora's training to obey her betters holds in her brain.

I go back to reading my book on the Internet Archive. Nora and Sheila are no where to be found, which worries me. Though Nora texted me to tell me she's giving Sheila aftercare, then she'll come back to Layla. It bothers me she'd just leave the hot military veteran to be used as a card table by two assholes, even with me watching them. She's just so indifferent (sometimes she seems gleeful) about her former mentors getting disrespected. It's getting...upsetting.

Then I hear ""Iswees Andy, Aster oga, Armeleta ent eee ith ood."" Mistress Sandy, Master Logan, Carmelita sent me with food.

I look up to see Logan staring wide eyed at the doorway. I look and recognize Cindy, even though she has a hood mask over her face and a red ball gag in her mouth. She's naked and her arms are bindered behind her back. A tray is strapped to her waist and anchored to her nipples. She's wearing plain brown around the house slave shoes. I smile and look down at my feet, wearing my new ladies cowboy boots. Carm asked me if I wanted anything before I left the kitchen. I said I wanted the new Kitchen Slave's boots. Carm had a servant bring them to me as I was heading out the door.

Ooops, I guess I forgot to tell Logan about my encounter with Cindy. Hehehe. He tentatively asks ""Is that Miss Cind-"" I cut him off. ""Logan grab the drinks, I'll get the food."" Logan grabs two glasses of what looks and smells like Horchata, Mexican Rice milk. I grab the steaming plate of foil wrapped Carne Asada. It smells so good, but I've got some business to attend to first.

""Logan, say grace and dig in, I have a slave to calibrate. Just be sure to save me some, buddy boy!"" I'm gratified when her beautiful eyes go wide with terror when she sees me pick up a crop from the monitor desk. ""Slave, left face! march to the third door on the right, stop, and wait for further instructions. I'll be right behind you."" She awkwardly turns left and starts walking. I follow her out.

She stops at the third door on the right and waits, clearly nervous. ""Slave, About Face!"" She seems to be struggling to process what that command means. I sigh exasperatedly and crop her bare butt. ""Turn around, slave."" She clumsily turns to face me.

""Don't you fucking eyeball me, slave, cast them down, now!"" When her eyes drop I say more reasonably ""First problem I want to address. You never stare at your betters unless told to. You have some nerve staring at Master Logan and I.""

""Second Problem, your message. You should have approached the doorway with your eyes down. Initially, all you needed to say is ""Greetings, Master Logan, Mistress Sandy."" Even in Ari's household, men always get addressed first, the only exception is Mistress Ari. Even you should know that.""

""Anyway, when you had our attention, you should've said ""MISTRESS Carmelita sends her regards and this slave presents the food she made. For as long as you're a slave, I better not ever hear you call her Carmelita again without ""Mistress"" in front of it.""

""We didn't get to this part, but once we took the food, you ask ""May this slave have permission to depart, Master and Mistress."" I take a deep breath.

""That's all for now, you get all that slave?"" She mumbles ""Ess, iswess Sandy."" around her ball gag. I reply ""Good.""

""One more thing, slave. How do you like my new cowboy boots?"" I tap her boots on my feet with the crop.

One brief glance up at my face with rage filled eyes. I match it with rage of my own and her eyes drop back down. ""Uh wuv um, iswess andy!"" I love them, Mistress Sandy! with forced enthusiasm. She could be more obsequious, but she's a new slave. I'll let it go. This time.

""Thank you, slave. I rather like them myself. Now stop lollygagging and get back to the kitchen, I know Carmelita has lots of work for you."" She turns awkwardly around. I smack her bare butt hard with my hand and yell ""Move!"" No real reason, she just has that scrumptious little white girl butt my Sapphic side craves. She toddles clumsily to the kitchen. I remember my first day as a real slave in Ari's household. I never thought it was going to be me. Until it was. I imagine she feels much the same. Like I care.

I turn back to dig into Carmelita's delicious cooking with my bodyguard and bro, Logan. I do realize I have to find some pity for Cindy, or risk falling to the darkness Nora's struggling with. I will. Just not today.

Think about what they enjoy doing in their free time, what types of products they typically use, and what their overall aesthetic is. For example, if they are a skincare enthusiast, a high-quality skincare set would be a thoughtful choice. If they are a foodie, a gourmet food set would be more appropriate.

**What should I do if the recipient has allergies or sensitivities?**
Carefully check the ingredient list or product descriptions to ensure that the gift set does not contain any allergens or irritants.If the recipient has known sensitivities to certain skincare ingredients, fragrances, or foods, choose sets that are specifically labeled as hypoallergenic, fragrance-free, or gluten-free.

My father’s health seemingly randomly took a turn for the worst about 10 years ago, after I had moved out to live with my mother. My father around this time lived in a mobile home on my grandmothers property. My aunt also had a home built on this property. While it was technically my grandmothers property, she has land set aside that will be passed town to her two children (my father and my aunt) but she allows them to use their own separate property as they please while it is still in her name. My father’s health decline included nausea, diarrhea, vomiting and eventually frequent twitching in his arm and in general not being able to control his movements. He would constantly shake. He saw an array of specialists but mainly gastrointestinal and neurological. After a week long stay at a well known state hospital and an assortment of tests he was finally told that he had tested positive for arsenic poisoning. The doctors believe that he was being poisoned slowly for a period of 1-2 years. A team had to come to his home and try to find the source, which they failed to do. My father suspects that it was his sister, as she had spent years trying to convince him to let her use his land or convince my grandmother to sign it over to her. My father still suffers from the long term effects of the poisoning, as it damaged parts of his brain. He has alien hand syndrome, and damaged nerves in his back that he has to have burned every year or two because they cause him immense pain. My father refuses to tell his mother and has made me promise not to, because he believes it will break her heart. The only reason he told me is because he has made me executor of his will and does not want my aunt to try and get anything from me after his death. 
He had a girlfriend at the time who also suffered health problems and still does because she was also poisoned. My brother who lived there at the time did not, so we suspect it could have been put in tea or coffee, something that he would not use regularly. I suffered from some stomach pain frequently as a teenager which has subsided but I suspect it had something to do with ingesting arsenic during the times I was visiting with my father. I have to have biopsies done on the lining of my stomach every 2-3 years as I have intestinal metaplasia (aka prime real estate for cancer).  It’s nothing compared to what my father feels every day. My aunt is still a no good scheming leech. She’s reached out to my older siblings and tried to make “business deals” with them and essentially offered to buy them a business (to have a means of her disabled daughter supporting herself after she passes) and let them run it for her and in turn she would build a home for them. But of course to do this they would have to convince my father to sign over a piece of land to her lolol. It feels comical how stupid she is. ",4,1748402098.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

I’m a 39-year-old guy with a beard, some decent tattoos, and a whole lot of restless energy lately. Life’s full, sure—there’s work, travel, people who rely on me—but somehow, it still feels like something’s missing. Maybe you’re feeling that too.

By day, I juggle meetings, deadlines, and way too many “circling back” emails. Sometimes that comes with travel, so there’s always a chance I might pop up near you. When I’m not working, I write (mostly poetry and short fiction), read a ton, and make questionable music on a guitar and piano. I’m a metalhead at heart, so singing is really more growling with feeling.

I’m serious about coffee, casual about cooking, and overly enthusiastic about mixology. Scotch is my go-to, but I’ll mix you whatever you’re in the mood for—virtually, for now. I love a night where good conversation pairs well with a great drink and some solid background music.

You? Hopefully someone who likes to talk—about books, music, life, or absolutely nothing at all. I’m not looking to blow up anyone’s life, just carve out a little space to be myself and connect with someone cool.

1kx6rak,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Kovalenko_Glacier/comments/1kx6rak/rusartuk_a_new_conlan_extended_in_one_place/,Rusartuk a New Conlan+ extended in one place,"Rusartuk an an declassified language for operation in combat or secret

Rusartuk is a constructed operational language blending Russian, Arabic, and Turkish influences into a fully speakable, learnable code for field operatives. It was designed for combat clarity and resilience under stress, evolving from simple code phrases into a complete naturalistic language. Like historical “code talker” systems, Rusartuk uses unique lexicon and grammar for secure tactical communication. For example, Navajo code talkers famously described a “submarine” as “iron fish” – similarly Rusartuk builds compound terms and concise expressions. (In linguistics, even a 14th-century conlang Balaibalan was “influenced by Persian, Turkish and Arabic”, much as Rusartuk draws on its source languages.)

Rusartuk is written in the Cyrillic script, extended with a few extra letters for Turkish-style vowels (e.g. Ӧ, ӧ for /ø/, Ү, ү for /y/). For field use we show it in a romanized form here, but operatives learn the Cyrillic-based alphabet as given below. Its spelling is phonetic (one sound per letter). Consonants mostly follow Russian values; vowels are short and clear (like Turkish vowels). Word stress is largely unpredictable (as in Russian), but most two-syllable words are stressed on the first syllable.

Alphabet & Pronunciation

Rusartuk uses a Cyrillic-based alphabet. Key letters and sounds include:

Rusartuk Letter	Sound (IPA)	Example (Rusartuk)

A a	/a/ as in father	kar “car”
E e	/ɛ/ as in bet	zem “earth”
I i	/i/ as in machine	pit “drink”
O o	/o/ as in more	dom “home”
U u	/u/ as in boot	gun “weapon”
Ö ö	/ø/ as in French peur	görd “worth”
Ü ü	/y/ as in French lune	süt “milk”
B б	/b/	bar “open”
V в	/v/	vel “fast”
G г	/g/	gol “head”
K к	/k/	kaf “coffee”
M м	/m/	mir “world”
N н	/n/	na (prefix “to”)
P п	/p/	patron “ammo”
R р	/r/ (trilled)	vrag “enemy”
S с	/s/	slep “sleep”
Sh ш	/ʃ/ as in ship	shaib “error”
Ch ч	/tʃ/ as in chip	char “forth”
Y й	/j/ as in yes	ya “I”
X х	/x/ (like ch in Scottish loch)	xarl “bitter”
Z з	/z/	zaz “again”

Consonant clusters are pronounced clearly (Rusartuk avoids silent letters). Example: “skorost” [skɔˈrost] (“speed”) exactly spells out each sound. Unfamiliar combinations (like Russian Ы, Turkish Ğ) have been simplified: e.g. vur /vur/ (no distinct Уэ) and karun /karyn/ for Arabic غ. Vowels ä, ö, ü are extended from Turkish; sälü /sælʏ/ means “hello” (see below).

Grammar Overview

Rusartuk syntax is Subject–Verb–Object (SVO). Sentence order is fixed and unambiguous for clarity. For example, “Ya vperyod davayu komand” literally means “I forward giving command” (i.e. “I give the command forward”). Many grammatical features come from its source languages, with adaptations for brevity:

Tense Prefixes: Verbs take simple prefixes to mark tense. (This is similar to how Russian uses prefixes for aspect.) Rusartuk uses pa‑ for past and sa‑ for future. E.g. ya go‑pram (“I go now” present), ya pa‑pram (“I went” past), ya sa‑pram (“I will go” future).

Negation: A negation prefix ne‑ precedes the verb (like Russian ne or Arabic lā). For example, ya ne pa‑pram = “I did not go.” (This parallels Arabic forming negation by prefixing lā and Turkish -ma/-me suffix.)

Pronouns: Subject pronouns (ya “I”, tu “you”, on/ona “he/she”, my “we”, vy “you(pl)”, oni “they”) usually precede the verb, though in radio comms they are often dropped as context permits.

No Articles: There are no articles (“a/the”). Plurals are marked with ‑lar/ler (from Turkish) or by number context.

Aspect & Mood: Basic aspect is indicated by context or by simple verbal affixes (e.g. ‑set for progressive). Complex mood or passive forms are rarely used; brevity is prioritized.

Adjectives & Adverbs: These are invariable (no gender agreement). For example, “veliki rembo” means “a big report” (both adjectives follow English pattern).

Example: Ya pa‑dimal bazu. – “I entered the base” (lit. “I past-entered base”). Tu ne go‑misya. – “You are not on mission.”

Dialogue Sample

Alexei: Meraba, Farid. Plan tak?
(English: “Hello, Farid. Is the plan ready?”)

Farid: Da, Alexei. Zadaneya prinima.
(English: “Yes, Alexei. The orders have been received.”)

Alexei: Vraga est’? Opasnost budet.
(English: “Enemy present? Danger is coming.”)

(English: “Ambush! Grenade!”)

Alexei: Vzrev! Ya ranen!
(English: “Explosion! I’m wounded!”)

(English: “Take cover! Medic!”)

This brief exchange shows practical use of Rusartuk in combat. The lines are short and clear, with tactical terms (“Opasnost”, “Granata”, “ranen”, etc.) and commands (“Pokriv”, “Medik”). Each phrase is immediately understood by operatives, even under fire.

Daily Rusartuk (Casual Slang)

In relaxed settings, operatives use Rusartuk like a colloquial tongue. Casual phrases and slang let them chit-chat or joke. Examples include:

Kaj tak? – “What’s up?” (informal greeting)

Brat, net! – “No way, bro!” (surprised refusal)

Istina? – “Seriously?” (as a question)

Haha! – “LOL / haha!” (laughter)

Ya utros. – “I’m tired.” (slangy complaint)

Poedim. – “Let’s eat.”

Spiko! – “Good night!” (short for “Spokoynoy nochi”)

Razloi. – “Chill out.” (calm down)

Khe! – “Alright!” (enthusiastic “yeah!”)

Chort! – “Oh no / damn!” (mild expletive)

Dakusta! – “As if! / No way!” (mock disbelief)

Super! – “Great!” (approval)

These short “slang” particles and interjections let operatives express attitude or emotions quickly. For example, “Dakusta!” is a shocked “No way!”, while “Razloi” tells someone to “relax.”

Slang & Expletives

Rusartuk includes a spectrum of expressive words and curses to convey emotion. Speakers use these much like natural languages do – adjusting strength by context. Typical examples (all original Rusartuk) are:

Fen – “dang!” (mild filler used jokingly or in minor annoyance)

Chert – “damn!” (moderate curse for frustration)

Lotsa! – “no way!” (surprise)

Shtul – strong expletive (equiv. “f---!”) used under heavy stress or anger

Chyort – “hell!” (mild shock)

Usage guidelines: In light conversation or under low stress, a mild interjection like “Fen!” or “Chert” is used casually. Under fire or anger, stronger curses (e.g. “Shtul!”) can be shouted. (Psychological studies note that swearing is often used to express emotion and urgency.) Rusartuk’s cuss words are mostly unique creations, so they carry force without revealing personal identities. Mark Rosenfelder’s Conlang kit even advises including such slang and swearing for realism.

In all cases, tone matters. A soldier might quietly mutter “Chert” when frustrated, but only scream “Shtul” in life-or-death moments. Comrades learn these cues: a “Fen!” from a buddy is taken lightheartedly, whereas a “Shtul, pomosh!” signals dire trouble requiring immediate action.

Sources

Key features of Rusartuk draw on linguistic principles and historical practice. Constructed languages often borrow patterns from real tongues. For example, Rusartuk’s tense prefixes echo how Russian adds verb prefixes for aspect. Its negation by prefix mirrors Arabic lā and Turkish -ma/-me. The inclusion of slang and expletives follows conlang advice to add realistic pragmatic particles. Finally, Rusartuk’s tactical purpose is akin to the WWII code talkers – soldiers using special vocabularies for clear, secure comms. These influences ensure Rusartuk feels natural yet finely tuned for operatives’ needs.)

Usually it'll be around 60% when I have driven around 3-4k miles which is usually when I change the oil upon recommendation. I am due for one according to the sticker from last service, but the orange dipstick is around 70% full, but the oil itself is a coffee brown on the paper towel. Which is right?

1kx6qs9,https://i.redd.it/6n62h6bnwf3f1.jpeg,Remember when this show had actual love stories like Rick and Maya’s relationship,"The best love story from my era of Bold was Rick and Maya, which had actual build-up, angst, and growth. 

The relationship wasn’t always easy as Rick was in a relationship with Caroline when he met Maya and had a struggle making an income, which is why he joined the Coffee shop Maya was working at in the first place. 

Plus, Maya had secrets of her own like her being trans, being separated from her family, and the struggles that she has gone through like losing her daughter and going to jail. 

Eventually, once all the secrets were out both were able to move on from their past and find love through each other and slowly build a life and family of their own. 

 Couples in the current era don’t get that and most of them either feel forced with no build-up or lack actual chemistry, unlike Rick and Maya did, and that’s a problem. 

Relationships like Carter and Hope or Electra and Will are having a problem growing a fanbase because they lack any form of storytelling, and even old couples like Brooke and Ridge, Taylor and Ridge, and Steffy and Finn are all failures because they aren’t receiving the storytelling that they deserve. 

There needs to be a change. ",20,1748401947.0,boldandbeautiful,14,0.95,False

I’m a 39-year-old guy with a beard, some decent tattoos, and a whole lot of restless energy lately. Life’s full, sure—there’s work, travel, people who rely on me—but somehow, it still feels like something’s missing. Maybe you’re feeling that too.

By day, I juggle meetings, deadlines, and way too many “circling back” emails. Sometimes that comes with travel, so there’s always a chance I might pop up near you. When I’m not working, I write (mostly poetry and short fiction), read a ton, and make questionable music on a guitar and piano. I’m a metalhead at heart, so singing is really more growling with feeling.

I’m serious about coffee, casual about cooking, and overly enthusiastic about mixology. Scotch is my go-to, but I’ll mix you whatever you’re in the mood for—virtually, for now. I love a night where good conversation pairs well with a great drink and some solid background music.

You? Hopefully someone who likes to talk—about books, music, life, or absolutely nothing at all. I’m not looking to blow up anyone’s life, just carve out a little space to be myself and connect with someone cool.

So how about it? Let’s share a drink over chat and see if we can make the boredom a little less boring.",2,1748401932.0,r4r,1,1.0,False
1kx6py2,https://i.redd.it/daw3u7sehf3f1.jpeg,A Noob Collects Beans (Day 7) MrBeanz (#3791734),"I FINALY FOUND IT! The beans, they whispered to me of its existence, they knew of what I had dared not even hoped to be true! \*Ahem\* Sorry about that, lost myself for a moment there. What did I do today? (furiously digs through notes, ignoring the scribblings of the word beans over and over) Right! Day seven.

**Day 7:**

The day started as most have as of late, by correcting the time anomaly that is Sayomi Kuronuma. I gathered the time residue, as has become my routine, and set about to the Highland Lord's tower. The council said that he was in need of my specific brand of assistance. (The fighting things kind) Arriving at the highland lord's tower, he informed me that he needed me to light the beacons along the neighboring peaks. I started with a-boo peak, because I ain't afraid of no ghosts, but as it would turn out, there were far worse things there than ghosts. (Fandoms!) Blasting my way through wave after wave of the ghosts, letting my magic do the talking for me, I finally reached the beacon, an ignited it. I then moved to the oil peak, the beacon was immediately available to me, but the oils pressure was far too high for me to be able to ignite it. I began letting off the pressure the old fashioned way, with violence. Pressure relieved, I ignited the second beacon and made my way to the third. As I approached the twin peak I began to have a splitting headache. I must have passed out shortly after, because I awoke in a hedge maze, with a gold ring in my hand, and the beacon lit. All's well that ends well I suppose. Beacons lit I made my way back to the highland lord, I received a misty robe for my trouble, and was sent on my way. Returning to the council, they informed me that giant garbage was beginning to pile up on the nearby plains, and that it was my job to investigate its origins. Looking around the plains, inspecting piles of giant garbage, I came across a mound of old coffee grounds. (a waste of perfectly good Beans if you ask me) Upon seeing the mound I felt a thought buzzing in the back of my mind, ""Plant the Bean."" the intrusive thought commanded. The more I looked at the mound the louder the thought grew, pounding away at my mind like the drums of war, raging at my refusal to do as ordered. I relented, fished an enchanted Bean from my pocket, and planted it. Before my eyes, as if spurred onward by some sort of unknowable force, a mighty Bean stalk shot heavenward. The buzzing in my skull subsided, but I knew without a doubt that I had to climb the stalk, I needed to know what was at its end. As it turns out, it was an airship, an airship filled with some of the strangest and most dangerous lunatics I'd had the misfortune of coming across. Dealing with the ships crew, I encountered four spirits, each handing me a piece of immateria. Giving the immateria to the engineer onboard, he gave me a S.O.C.K. and I was able to make my way to the nearby giant castle floating in the sky.

  
**Beans Earned:** 

Yeah.... I donated all of the beans I earned today without writing down exactly how many that was... Good thing the loathing postal service keeps track of all of the donations you guys make, or else I'd feel terrible for forgetting who gave me what, and not being able to thank you guys properly.

**Beans Donated:**

81 Enchanted Beans, 631 hills of Beans, 161 Bean burritos, 12 insanely spicy Bean burritos, 10 insanely spicy enchanted Bean burritos, 10 insanely spicy jumping Bean burritos, 82 enchanted Bean burritos, 106 jumping Bean burritos, 1 jumping Bean taco, 5 plates of frigid norther Beans, 5 plates of pork 'n' pork 'n' pork 'n' Beans, 4 green and red Beans, 10 spicy Bean burritos, 11 spicy enchanted Bean burrito, 129 yummy tummy Beans, 1 spicy jumping Bean burrito, 1 skeleton Beans, 13 plates of tesla's electroplated Beans, 5 plates of trader olaf's exotic stink Beans, 10 plates of heimz fortified kindney Beans, 10 plates of mixed garbanzos and chickpeas, 2 rainbow jellyBeans, 1 western slang vol. 2: cooking

**Tofu Donated:**

1 essential tofu, 35 wads of tofu

**Non Bean Donations:**

5 kick me signs, 100 sets of crafting plans, 1 11 leaf clover, 9 filthy knitted dread sacks, 1 tiny barrel, 6 prismatic wads, 16,222 meat

  
Thank you Amagalan, ishootthings, spramen, and Big Daddy Grimm for the generous donations. Because of all of the amazing people who have been donating to the bean collection, I now hold second place in 2 categories (Bean burritos, and insanely spicy Bean burritos), and third place in 4 categories (spicy Bean burrito, enchanted Bean burrito, spicy enchanted Bean burrito, and insanely spicy jumping Bean burrito.) I don't think I would have ever gotten this far by myself, especially not so quickly. So once again, thank you all for your continued support, and more bean related nonsense to come. After all, I just found the biggest bean based thing in the game.",7,1748401872.0,kol,2,1.0,False

In highschool I was heavy due to being on steroids for asthma, starting to have my first bipolar manic and depressive episodes at 15 and comfort eating from being bullied.   

After I graduated is eventually came off the steroids and started losing weight.   I was still undiagnosed bipolar.   Wound up working graveyard shift drinking pots of coffee a day and taking about 8 over the counter diet pills a day, a long with hyper dieting and being in near constant manic or mixed episodes, even after I eventually got off grave yards.   That's when I was at my thinest as an adult size 36 waist medium shirt at 6 foot tall.

Then eventually wound up in hospital for a severe psychotic mixed (think mania and depression thrown in giant blinder) episode and finally diagnosed.   Long story short tye first combination of meds I was on especially my first anti psychotic made me balloon up to a size 46-48 and 4xl shirts in the span of two years before my psychiatrist had to take me off it because of the weight gain.   A second hospital stay few med changes later and I got down to a size 42 and 2-3xl depending on shirt.  

 I've gotten into hypomanic obsessive crash diets and gotten down at my lowest over a year ago to 268lbs to only crash out of that into a depression and gain it all back up to 294lbs 

I struggle I try to use my Fitbit as a tool but it can easily drive myself into a hypomanic episode (which has the risk of spiraling quickly and) if I get to hyper fixated on counting calories.

I also struggled with some of my meds making me feel hungry a lot.   And being in a food environment that can make it hard to eat the ""right"" things all the time.

I try to love my body, but I constantly see G/B influencers with much much thinner bodies then mine who simply aren't ""riped/fit"" have what might be called a dad bod in straight circles, get called tye nastiest things and have super derogatory things said about them and their bodies.   I've had such things said about me before because of profile pictures so now on Facebook my picture is my car and one Instagram and threads it's my dog that passed last year. 

How do I tune these people out

Short always struggled with weight especially after being diagnosed bipolar and started on meds.   Watch much thinner people then me riped to shreds on social media have been to before changed profile pics to my car/my passed dog.

1kx6irf,https://www.reddit.com/r/hypertension/comments/1kx6irf/seeking_advice_before_doctors_visit/,Seeking advice before doctors visit,"So for context. Currently 32. Had a stroke (medular rupture) in 2023. Since then I've been on a mix of medications to get my health under control, however i have some concerns they might be causing a cycle. I'm speaking with my doctor about it soon, but wanted to hear what others thought as well.

I'm on atorvostatin for cholesterol, and aspirin and carvedilol for blood pressure.
However, there's another factor. One of my blood tests showed elevated liver enzymes indicating fatty liver.
I've been dieting, trying to exercise more. I've even lost some weight lately. Was in the 240s, but weighed myself earlier and have gotten to around 228.
I've completely cut out sodas, and the most caffeine i have is 1 premier protein coffee drink a day. (Considering weening myself off those, though).
Despite all this, I'm still having trouble with occasional periods of hypertension. Sometimes lately 140/90, but earlier it was as high as 147/103. I understand that this may be a thing i must learn to live with, but i have questions. 

Recently, another blood test i had indicated high BUN levels which i read can be caused by liver problems. It was in the green, but literal right on the upper edge. I also read that high BUN and liver enzymes can contribute to hypertension.
And apparently statins, like atorvistatin, cause things like fatty liver inflammation.

So I'm concerned that the atorvostatin is contributing to my high BP in spite of the carvedilol.

I'm gonna ask my doctor for another blood test tomorrow to see if my cholesterol has improved, in which case maybe she'd be willing to rethink my meds. At the very least, maybe there's a less harsh statin (like rosuvastatin) she could switch me too instead.

But, I'm curious if anyone here has experience with this kinda thing. Maybe yall have suggestions i should bring to my doctor?",1,1748401251.0,hypertension,0,0.67,False

I know I’m supposed to be rational but the damn heart, it truly hurts. I once heard that abandonment and disappointment can be terrible feelings but we ought not to renounce love since we would be missing one of the truly greatest experiences of life. But I just feel completely defeated, I really really liked this person. When I first saw her she was fixing her curly hair behind her ears and smiled as someone passed her by and said hello, it was a year ago or maybe a little more. I mustered the courage to finally approach her some months ago and since then I looked forward to seeing her and chatting. My friends talked me into asking her out and somehow I did it and this was the result. I just don’t know what to do now, I don’t know how long they've been together. I’ve been with people, I’ve experienced grief and heartbreak but this one just feels so different. I just want to cry and to tell this damned heart to never bet again. I’ll drink that coffee and hope this never happens again. ",1,1748401223.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

for the past few months, I’ve been kind of an asshole to people for literally no reason - just being really rude and short and impatient for no reason. It’s gotten so bad that even people asking simple questions like “where are you going?” make me so irritated that I end of being really rude and short with them. I am a nurse, so it’s really not okay for me to be like this. I thought maybe it’s been stress, so I started eating healthier and working out more consistently to see if that would help, started being more intentional with my free time to ensure I have self-care time, and have been super diligent with taking my meds, as they really help me manage stress. 

However, partly because I’ve been so diligent, I have been super inconsistent about eating. Some days, I forget to eat until 4 or 5 PM after only having a decaf coffee or tea that morning. It’s honestly because my meds cut my appetite so bad that I don’t feel hungry, so I forget to eat. Lately, I started to wonder if my “personality change” is really just hanger in disguise (because I don’t feel hungry)? Has anyone else experienced anything like this? Also what are ways I can “hack” eating (go to snacks, easy meals, ways to remind myself)? ",1,1748401188.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

1kx6elv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1kx6elv/disturbing_dreams_where_others_are_affected_not_me/,"Disturbing Dreams Where Others Are Affected, Not Me","Hey everyone,
I’m someone who rarely dreams or at least never remembers them. But recently, I’ve had two vivid, unsettling dreams that are really messing with me. The weird part? I’m not the one being affected in them,it’s always someone else and I wake up feeling disturbed, even scared.


Dream 1 (yesterday night):
I dreamt I was sleeping beside my wife under a bedsheet. Suddenly, i wake up in dream as she was talking to something on the roof(on top of us). It felt eerie. In the dream, I scolded her, saying, “How many times have I told you not to take your face out of the bedsheet?” (as if in dream it felt like i already encountered the same situation)Then I pulled her back and covered her face again.
That’s when I woke up in real life. But I was so scared that I didn’t open my eyes at all. I just stayed frozen in place, pretending to sleep, until morning. It felt too real.


Dream 2 (last night):
I visited a married friend who lives with her husband and daughter. After I left, the dream followed her husband’s POV,he was making tea or coffee in the kitchen. My friend was changing clothes in another room, and suddenly started speaking in a weird, abnormal way as if she was talking to someone invisible. At first, the husband thought she was doing something random, but when it didn’t stop, he got concerned and went to check.
Right as he knocked on the door, I woke up again, feeling uneasy.


Both times, I’m not the one being “attacked” or affected directly, but I feel the fear deeply. I also always wake up with this weird sense of dread, like something spiritual or unknown is lingering.

I don’t know if these dreams mean something, or if my brain is just overactive. But I’ve never had dreams like this before, and now I’m anxious and sleeping badly.


Has anyone else experienced dreams like this? Where others are affected but you’re just watching? Could this be symbolic, spiritual, or psychological? Any help or insight would be really appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

I am taking a roasting course online that Scott Rao helped with, and today I learned about three main areas of defect and how to manage them. Details outlined below.

# BAKED

* This is typically when ROR drops rapidly after first crack and then flattens or begins to rise
* This is due to a sudden energy absorption and the rapid release of moisture and CO2, which dampens the internal rise of temperature
* Too low power and too long Maillard phase can contribute
* Decreases sweetness, roundness and juiciness
* As coffee cools the coffee will taste more hollow and flat
* To avoid, monitor the temperature and momentum going into first crack and maintain or slightly increase power until first crack is well underway to avoid large dip

# UNDERDEVELOPED

* This is when the center of the beans is not developed fully
* This is due to ending development after first crack too soon, too low heat (especially during Maillard phase), or too much airflow early on (mainly in drum roasters)
* This will add a grass, vegetal, woody, or peanut butter flavor
* Lacks sweetness, weak body, and sometimes tastes brothy
* To avoid, ensure enough time for coffee to develop after first crack, increase heat during Maillard phase if needed, watch for even bean color

# FLICKED

* This is when the ROR rises or accelerates rapidly towards the end of the roast, typically after the ROR crashes or stalls
* This can happen when too much heat is applied near the end of a roast or dropping the heat at an appropriate time during/after first crack is delayed
* The coffee will taste more roasted than it should for the level of development it is at, and flavors can be burnt or muted
* To avoid, you may need to reduce heat just enough 15-30 seconds prior to first crack, do not try to stretch development by re-introducing heat late in the roast, and increase the fan and airflow after first crack to off-set tendency to flick by pulling heat off the beans
* Do not drop heat too much when doing this or you will cause the ROR to crash and bake the coffee",2,1748400838.0,FreshroastSR800,2,1.0,False

25 weeks; failed 1 hr at 179 😬 then passed my 3 hour (fasting was 94, cut off was 95),1 hr was high rest within limits. Then had severe hypoglycemia after (in the 40s!)

Spoke with my OB and agreed to start texting my glucose for a week around 28 weeks to see how I was doing to maybe rule me back in for GD. I applied a freestyle CGM I had left over to watch my glucose in response to what I’m eating closely. 

Here’s today’s for example:
Fasting 103 

Had a drinkable yogurt and coffee, spiked up to highest 140 but was at 123 at 1 hr post 

Lunch was cheese quesadilla with a normal Dr Pepper, spiked up to 140s again but was 118 at 1 hr post 

Currently eating dinner but was hypoglycemic down to 65 before started eating. 

My questions: 
If I wasn’t diabetic, wouldn’t my glucose not spike up after a meal at all? 

What time am I suppose to take my fasting? I looked at my freestyle app as soon as I opened my eyes and was in the 80s, got dressed brushed my teeth and checked it and it was 100, my finger poke was 103. Am I dumping glucose in the AM? 

If just my fasting are high do I have GD? How can I drink a regular soda and not be in the 200s, or is it because I’m still on the earlier side of my pregnancy?

1kx694t,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1kx694t/goodbye_wedding_dress/,"Goodbye, wedding dress","Hey guys. This is just a vent and not much of an update, though I just wanted somewhere to spill my guts and get my thoughts in order. 

So on another thread a while back, I did share that my wedding gown was purchased by JNMIL and I had complex feelings of sadness over it. It’s a beautiful ballgown dress with hints of blush between the layers and it was perfect for me. I loved it, but always felt odd and even uncomfortable at the fact that it wasn’t truly my dress, but something someone who disliked me purchased to make themselves look good to others. That being said, every now and then I would feel sad that I didn’t have my dress with me at home since we left it at the ILs, and that nobody had reached out to get us to pick up the dress. I know it was stupid of me to leave it there and forget about it for a while, though the timeline between the wedding and the big fallout was rather short; as to say, I didn’t really have much of a chance to pick it up once the bad blood got too bad. In my mind back then, decorum was still in the equation between both parties, and I never expected something like this to happen, so picking it up wasn’t a thing I felt hurried on. Well..

Today JNMIL texts DH asking what she should do with my dress and his tuxedo. They have a guest coming over for JNMIL’s birthday soon and they want to make room for their belongings. Which is fair, of course, though the dress and tux don’t take much room in their rather large home in my opinion. The text didn’t acknowledge the tension or the fact that their last talk devolved into her calling us names, but just a “Hi DH, how have you been?” Along with the dress thing. DH approached me about it with a “I’d like to talk to you about something and get your input”, then gave me the option to back out if I wanted to. When he said it was about my dress, I knew it was a convo I had to speak to him about.

Well, the end result is that while I liked my dress a lot, loved it, even, whenever I see pictures of it or anything about it, all the gross feelings and negative emotions come bubbling back up. This dress was purchased by the biggest hater of my marriage, now (i supposed) being used as an item to get her son to visit her on or around her birthday, just like various other attempts where she’d offer him coffee makers or his mail to get him to go there. This woman doesn’t acknowledge anything and would rather lord over items in hopes DH sees her. And he was about to do it until I suggested he ask his FM sister deliver it to us since JNMIL made her the official messenger between both parties. But once I reflected on how much grief this dress would give me, and the icky feeling of strings attached this dress has, I decided to let the dress go. 

What matters to me more than material possessions is my marriage. I can buy a dress at any time. 

I know I was really foolish for leaving my dress with them. I won’t live that down. But even before the big fight, I already felt complicated about the dress. So I think I did right by myself. DH sent her a text that was unusually assertive to her, which I supported, saying: “You’re the one who purchased it, it’s up to you on whether or not you toss it.” All she responded was “Wow. Ok.”

It was a nice dress. But I’d like to form better memories without the aid of someone who hates our marriage so much. ",48,1748400434.0,JUSTNOMIL,10,0.96,False
1kx68qe,https://i.redd.it/wgd65k99qf3f1.jpeg,"A Day From Wes Hildreth's Diary.... Saturday April 6, 1968","This one day entry of Wes Hildreth's diary is so well written and contains so much history, I hope you humor me in sharing this. Wes and Jack were hiking from Supai Village in Havasu Canyon to the Hopi Salt Trail that April. They had intended to hike to Nankoweap and exit Saddle Mountain but the water in the river was too cold. Hope you enjoy this read.

Saturday 6 April \[1968\] 

Used half the 41/2 qts. we had each filled at Boucher Creek, so our loads were as light today as at any point on the trip - no more than 30 lbs. on my back. Dawn was pretty - wild clouds moving fast and solar rays piercing the mist upriver. Ra, Set, Cheops, etc. are very imposing across the gorge. I’ll explore them someday. Early, 2 jets roared down the canyon no higher than the middle Redwall - lowest we’ve seen this trip. Fairly easy going (after initial gullies) got us to Hermit Camp in 2 hours. Approaching, I jerked up to see 12 boy scouts leaving the camp ½ mile across the canyon - first humans we’d seen in 15 days - all lined up and trooping off like sheep. Old fences of chicken wire remain about ½ mile along the Tonto each way from Hermit, no doubt to restrain pack animals in the days this was a tourist center. I later found that antelope were kept here as a trial herd in the 1920s - segregated from the burro range, which was badly overgrazed. Several old beds at Hermit Camp, lower part, and many foundations on the grassy slope above. Found a can of beans which we ravenously devoured, having skimped on a Cream of Wheat breakfast. Quite a fascinating spot, with many trails and built-up rock walls leading down to water in the ravines, which were flowing weIl. A much more scenic spot than Phantom, and with easy river access. Too bad they didn’t keep this one instead - but the cross canyon trail route was no doubt the deciding factor. Heading out onto the Tonto again, just as we passed the gate in the fence beyond the trail jct. to Cathedral Stairs, we were caught by a sharp 15-minute rain which soaked us thru. Drying out was almost as fast, so when rain came again in Salt Crk we had forgotten we were once wet. Moving faster now than at any time since meeting Jack at G.T. Spring, we roared around the Monument Creek, counting on a late afternoon milkshake! The Monument itself was an impressive Tapeats obelisk 200’ high on a pink granite base. And old NPS tellephone sign, wire, beds and the normal campsite debris of tea pots and pitchers made an interesting scene. Both this and Salt Crk. had old green + white NPS enamel signs announcing themselves. Hermit had a couple plus a trail jct. sign and a rusty old thing saying Tonto Trail. Little burro evidence out here now, but a fair number of hikers make this the best trail I’ve seen since Supai. Saw no water at Cedar Spring but all the creeks were running, even Horn a trickle - very wet weather here lately.

Finally caught the boy scouts, sitting down to lunch at the head of Salt Creek just as it began to rain again. They had made good time for 14-year-olds - we gained barely 45 minutes on them in almost 4 hours. Initially apprehensive at our wild appearances, they soon warmed up and took a real interest in our journey. All were GC residents - either NPS or Fred Harvey families. We saw them twice the next day in Babbitts and at the Ranger Station. Good kids - wish more would get out and about. One had even read Colin’s book and knew approximately what we were doing. The adult leader, an NPS employee (driver?) named Clyde Fauley, was pleasant but mildly embarrassed at contact with such outlandish creatures.

We really are quite astonishing to behold - wretched and tattered ragamuffins. The kids gave us each an excess can of tuna and some bread, which probably in the long run supplied the energy to make it to Babbitts by closing time. Rounding Horn Creek, we had a good view of the mine tower on the rim and the telephone line \[Ed note: High Tension line\] swinging free nearly 1,500’ down and out from the Redwall, connecting to poles on the Tonto which round the Battleship to Indian Gardens, safely out ofsight of tourist eyes. Went out to the point E. of Horn rapid, one of the worst on the river, for the last pixs for Marston this week.

Jack went rapidly ahead and I didn’t catch him until the base of the Redwall above Indian Gardens. In my haste, I took on no water there, and Jack soon consumed my half-quart as well as a quart of his own in the ascent. He did well but it really hurt - such an effort should round out what is becoming excellent physical condition. I bet he’s lost 15 lbs. and doubled his endurance. All it takes is regularity. With plenty of encouragement and time predicting I coaxed him on schedule past each 1/2 mile post, feeding him snow and ice from shady spots and my last can of dried beef. An additional boon was finding a full pack of lifesavers on the trail and two elephant legs from an otherwise empty box of Animal Crackers.

The burro dung trail ice may have been responsible for the poor and very gaseous condition of my intestines for the next 24 hours. Far more gaseous than usual - and this has been a loudly crepidatory journey. We rimmed out at 5:45, having left I. Gdns. Rest House at 3:37 - good time - and stormed into Babbitts at 5:55 only to find a sign on the door that it will also be open Sunday (tomorrow) for the first time this year! As we once said, it’s an ironic trip.

No one should ever shop for 5 future days on the trail half-overcome with thirst and fatigue from charging full blast out of the G.C. I bought three giant Hershey’s, a quart of orange juice, four boxes of cookies, and a six pack of beer before settling down to things I could realistically carry in a pack. Jack drank a quart of milk while pushing a shopping cart up a single aisle - abandoned the carton amidst soup cans. Worst irony is the Soda Fountain and Snack Bar were both closed from 5 PM, so no milkshake until tomorrow.

We sat on the floor of the empty Post Office drinking beer and reading letters from our sweet faraway wives. One lady peeked in but bolted, afraid to enter an empty room with such sprawling riff-raff. Took the Ranger Station by storm - even Lloyd Hoener was impressed with how tough we looked and even possibly with the exploit itself. Ken Hulick is again down at Phantom, but a note said our gear is on his desk. Signed in and out for the next lap making it Little Colorado instead of Nankoweap. Too cold in that river!

Then staggered with packs and grocery bags to the B.A. Lodge where we were lucky enough to get a room, again ironically in Powell Lodge. Took a long hot beautiful bath while Jack showered, and felt much better, except for the footsoreness. While sorting food and gear, I felt my Achilles tendon begin tightening for the first time on the trip. It must be a function of hard extended uphill work. Threw away one pair of socks and washed the rest of my cloths in the bath tub.

Appeared clean but wild in the dining room for a 9 PM dinner of hamburger steak, lemons, much bread, onions, soup and salad, tea + coffee and a relish plate. All the bus boys and girls really dug us, served us many little extras, and solicited pot and peyote! We really look “Far Out.” Phoned Di and Nancy at Fulton’s after dinner - really good to talk to my sweetie pie - she sounded enthusiastic and happy if just a bit lonely, but not martyred: a good sport and gutsy. Made all A’s and B’s too! Home in two weeks for all too brief an interlude before flying to Juneau.

Got a card from Colin \[Fletcher\] wishing me that I find all that I am after - which suggests a recurrent, interesting, but I think unanswerable, question. Stayed up in bed ridiculously late, writing Nance, Marston, Butchart, Jim and Mother. Even at 3 AM I couldn’t sleep - coffee at dinner? Too many thoughts and details to attend to? Too hot in the room? Or just too radical a change in environment? It actually seems strange to see all these irrelevant people.

Worst irony here was emerging from the trailhead to see several couples in tuxedos and full length gowns going to the N.A.U. spring prom. Incredible. Ludicrous. Infinite juxtaposition. Two kids on the trail whom I overtook at Kolb studio said you are not going to pass us now, but looked blank when I said I didn’t need to. Scouts going down looked similarly blank when the reply to their question of how long I’d been down was 15 days. No, not the Kaibib Trail, the Topacoba Trail. Supai. Nobody. 15 days. Disbelief. Blank.

In the B.A. lodge, a couple realized we haven’t seen any news in some time and effervesced with the astonishing stories of LBJ’s demurrer, peace talk possibilities, and above all the King assassination. There was no better man in America. I’d seen the NPS flag at half-staff - Wayne Cone passed through my mind and Smirkingly Elbie, but in my stupor I had forgotten to ask at the Ranger Station. What a world to return to - nearly three weeks without news of one of the eventful periods in recent years. Wilderness or the revolution? On such a note I washed the world’s filthiest T-shirt, went to bed, and ended the first stage of my journey.

1kx63mh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskGaybrosOver30/comments/1kx63mh/am_i_overreacting/,Am I overreacting?,"\[TL;DR\]: My partner claims that he doesn't feel welcome at Leather events because of his fetish (one that we both share and had before we got together). But, he insists on coming to events because he also claims that he ""likes them"" and ""is interested"".

So, my partner and I are coming upon 3 years and it hasn't exactly been easy so far. I love him, but sometimes I wonder if the meaning of that word is being stretched to its end in this situation. We are in an age-gap relationship, I'm 33. (I'll call him 'C') C is 57. Before you make any assumptions, let me clear some things up.

1. I've been in the gay community longer than him. He says that he was taken advantage of and bullied by the bitchy gays when he was out in the 80's, and coupled with the AIDS epidemic he just left the community and sought cis community and was in long-term gay relationships. 8-12 years on average.
2. I'm a member of the Leather community. I am polyamorous, and made it clear I was not going to change that at all. I do not have any other committed partners than him, and I do have a few intimate friends and lovers, but I've made it clear that I do not want to build a life with them. Some of them have other primary partners, are solo-poly, etc.

When we have attended Leather events he complains that they're ""all about sex"" and that nobody wants to talk to him because he ""isn't as attractive as me"".

But, he always gets nervous beforehand, and doesn't bring the open attitude and kind confidence that I fell in love with. And then complains that nobody wants to talk with him. We both have a foot fetish, but I am more open about it. He is very secretive about it but seems upset with the community because opportunities to engage in that fetish aren't WIDELY advertised. But, I tell him that I get invited to foot-fetish events all the time, because I'm willing to talk about it and create the experience I want to have instead of needing someone else to bring it to me.

This community has been a part of my life for a long time and I have friends here (more non-sexual than sexual) but C and I often get into conflicts around these events, but he insists on going.

This past weekend we went to a local Burning Man event (PDF) and he was so happy that he made friends that he, ""feels like will go to hang out and get a coffee and be responsive."" And said, ""I definitely feel more comfortable here than at Leather events"". But, when I brought up the fact that he had a completely different attitude at PDF than he brings to leather events - he wouldn't acknowledge it and still asserted that he wants to attend Leather events.

Am I overreacting in considering just telling him that after our planned Leather events for this year, I don't want him to come along anymore?",2,1748399975.0,AskGaybrosOver30,11,0.67,False

 I don't really think that there is a good way to start my story, so I'm going to begin with the part that really caused this. I'm an adult in my twenties who, like many young adults, feels like my life doesn't have any purpose. Ever since I graduated high school, I have been roaming around North America, trying to find a place to call home-to find people to call home.
  My family is great, if a bit strange, but they weren't the type of family I wanted to have for my own. I wanted to find like-minded friends and maybe even someone to fall in love with, to make our own little family. I moved from state to state, hoping that the next place would have what I was looking for, but I was never so lucky.



Part one: I need a break


    I had just moved into my new apartment in Cedar Hollow, Maine-a place so obscure I wasn’t even sure I’d heard of it before. But I needed somewhere to stay, and this cheap Craigslist find would have to do. It wasn’t the worst place I’d lived, but it was far from anything to brag about.

  Nearby, I landed a job at a small company called “Cryp-tee-d Co.”, which made quirky T-shirts featuring cryptids-those mysterious creatures from folklore. The shirts were amusing but hardly destined for big sales outside Maine. Little did I know, this job would mark the start of the darkest chapter of my life.

  At first, everything seemed normal. The company had a handful of long-time employees, and there was a steady flow of people coming and going. Over the first year, I met someone special, and by the end of that year, we decided to start dating.

  We had fun going on little dates, trying out odd restaurants, and venting about the ridiculous shirts we made-shirts no one ever seemed to wear. We dreamed of escaping the job, especially since our boss was a verbally abusive nightmare, constantly yelling about how we failed to capture the ""essence"" of cryptids in our designs.

  Both severely underpaid, we decided to move in together to split rent. That’s when things started to unravel.

  Spending every moment together should have been a blessing, but my old habits of self-sabotage crept in. Growing up in a strange family, I struggled with genuine affection. I thought gifts were the way to show love, but I forgot to be emotionally present. My girlfriend often told me this, but instead of opening up, I shut down and isolated her.

  Over two years, things worsened until she packed up and left. I never knew where she went. Attempts to reach her failed-she likely blocked me. I sank into a pit of despair that bled into my work, and the quality of my shirts plummeted.

  My boss’s anger grew with every recycled or worse design I submitted. Depression took hold. My last friend from high school grew distant, caught up in his own life. I started calling out of work, using family emergencies as excuses to take time off, but I never visited them. I feared their judgment and rejection.

  I stayed home, draining my savings, playing video games on my oblivious neighbor’s open Wi-Fi. My apartment was cold and lonely, even with the heat on. I never slept in the bedroom anymore-I wanted my things to still smell like her. Instead, I crashed on the awful couch she hated but I had insisted on keeping. It was a cruel joke how right she’d been about its discomfort.

  Things got so bleak I began searching for an escape-whether through drugs or something darker. One night, before sleep, I prayed to any god that might listen. I just needed a break.


Part 2: Learning to dream

  I started spending more and more time online, searching for ways to help myself. I tried everything-from psychedelic drugs to one of those online therapy apps. Honestly, those apps almost did more harm than good. The people never seemed all that professional, and after a few sessions, I felt even worse. One night, after another disappointing therapy call, I lay in bed feeling like I’d nearly run out of options. That’s when a memory from my school days floated up: lucid dreaming. If you don’t know what that is, it’s when you become aware in your dream and can control everything about it. You could be a knight in a castle, a hero fighting Godzilla, or even create your own Garden of Eden. I made a mental note to call out of work the next day and dedicate myself to learning about lucid dreaming. As I drifted off to sleep, the last thing I remember was the faint sound of sorrowful laughter, then darkness.

  I was never one to sleep long, so a few hours later I woke up and decided to get coffee to jumpstart my research. I never really believed coffee made me more productive, but with enough sugar, at least I’d be wired enough to keep searching for answers. On my way home, I called my boss to say I was feeling sick and would be bedridden all day. As fate would have it, I was standing at a red light when my boss pulled up right beside me. We made eye contact-me on the phone, him in his car. He rolled down his window and yelled through both the phone and the open window that I’d better see him in his office as soon as I got to work, or I’d be fired. Frustrated with my own stupidity, I spiked my half-finished coffee onto the sidewalk, rushed home, changed into my work clothes, and headed in.

  When I got to my boss’s office, I knocked on the door. No answer. I waited, knocked again, still nothing. Slowly, I pushed the door open. He was sitting with his back to me, staring out the window. My heart sank-this was exactly how movies showed someone right before they were found dead. Was I about to be framed? Would I go to jail for something I didn’t do? Was today the end of my free life?

  I skirted around the edge of the room, careful not to touch anything. I didn’t want to leave any evidence behind. When I finally saw his face, I let out a breath I didn’t know I’d been holding. He wasn’t dead. But he wasn’t right, either. He sat there, unblinking, tears rolling down his cheeks, a huge smile plastered on his face. A strange, ominous laugh leaked out of him. As soon as I moved into his peripheral vision, he snapped back to his usual angry self. He barked at me for not knocking, told me to sit down, and when I just stood there, stunned, he grew red in the face and demanded I sit immediately. I backed around his desk and sat, never taking my eyes off him, wondering if I’d imagined the whole thing.

  The conversation went about as well as I’d expected. He told me I was on my final strike. My shirt designs were slipping in quality, I’d been calling out too often, and I’d lied to him that very morning. If I didn’t shape up, I’d be out of a job. The whole time he yelled, tears kept streaming down his face, as if he didn’t even notice. I thought to myself that this might be the most uncomfortable situation I’d ever experienced.

  After that strange encounter, I went back to work and actually managed to come up with a few decent shirt ideas. The weirdness of the morning seemed to spark my creativity. When the day was over, I hurried home, eager to put the whole ordeal behind me. I didn’t have to work the next day, so I could stay up as late as I wanted researching lucid dreaming. Everything I read said I needed to get into a meditative state before dreaming. That was going to be tough, but I was determined. I sat on my uncomfortable couch, put on relaxing music, closed my eyes, and tried to meditate. I had no idea what I was doing, and before long, I just fell asleep without any results.

  Over the next week, I scoured YouTube for meditation guides and found a ton of options. But I didn’t pay for ad-free content, so every time I started to relax, a loud ad would jolt me out of it. I realized I’d need to make more money if I wanted to meditate without interruptions. So, I started showing up to work more often, and my boss seemed to ease up on me.

  After that day in my boss’s office, nothing weird happened between us, and I didn’t notice anything strange with anyone else. Gradually, I forgot about it. By the end of the month, I’d upgraded my streaming services so I could meditate without ads. I kept practicing, and little by little, my sleep improved.

  A week into my new routine, my dreams started to return. At first, they were just scattered fragments-disjointed ideas and themes-but it was better than nothing. I couldn’t remember them clearly, but just knowing I’d dreamed at all felt like progress. My life began to take a turn for the better. It’s amazing what a full eight hours of sleep can do, even if the motivation is just to avoid getting fired.

  A month in, I noticed the first signs of being able to control my dreams. I could make things happen on purpose and remember them when I woke up. It felt like directing a movie, though I was a pretty bad director. I could fly around the world, but since I’d never left the United States, my world was basically just a giant globe. I jumped off the Empire State Building and landed unharmed, like in that scene from The Matrix. I knew that with more practice, I could become a true lucid dreamer.

  The first time I had a dream where I was fully in control was incredible. I created a world of endless meadows and wildflowers, the sun shining bright and warm. I wandered through fields, feeling the grass brush against my legs, smelling the flowers. I set up a picnic and ate my favorite foods, which tasted better than anything I’d had in years. It was as if someone had turned up the color saturation in my life. For the first time in a long time, I felt okay. After eating, I wandered further, until I reached the edge of a dense, mysterious forest. It was thick but somehow inviting. I heard a stream trickling just beyond the trees. I tried to will the forest away, to return to the meadows, but nothing changed. Just as I gathered the courage to step into the forest, my alarm went off, pulling me back to reality. I decided that if I ever found myself at the edge of that forest again, I wouldn’t hesitate-I’d step in and explore the unknown corners of my dream.



Part 3:Hopeless Romantic 

  Something about the edge of that forest must have really messed with my subconscious, because after that dream, I couldn’t control my dreamscapes the way I had before. It was as if the border of that imagined woodland had erected a barrier in my mind, keeping me from returning to that place of wonder and possibility. Frustrated, I decided it was time to take a break from chasing dreams and focus on real life for a while.

  I figured some fresh air might do me good, so I actually applied for vacation time-legitimately, for once-and got it approved. I packed a bag, got in my car, and drove west for a couple of hours until I reached a quaint little town nestled beside a sparkling lake. The place felt like a secret, a pocket of peace tucked away from the world, and I decided I’d spend at least one night there.

  Wandering the town’s winding streets, I stumbled upon a shop that stood out from its sleepy surroundings: “Conspira-See,” the sign read, adorned with a psychedelic eye. The place looked so out of place, I couldn’t resist stepping inside. Given my own line of work, I was curious to see if the people here were as odd as the ones back home.

  Inside, the store was a treasure trove of the bizarre and the old-books that looked a century past, shelves crowded with objects I couldn’t even begin to name. There were cryptid references everywhere, familiar and strange all at once. But the oddest thing by far was the complete absence of a shopkeeper. I waited at the counter, called out, and heard nothing but the creak of old wood. Suddenly, a shuffling noise behind me made my skin prickle. I spun around, heart pounding.

  Standing just two paces away was what I thought was a statue of Mothman, looming over five feet tall. But then it moved-a young woman, dressed in a full Mothman costume, grinning at me with the satisfaction of a prank well played. She slipped out of the costume, laughter bubbling up as she saw how thoroughly she’d startled me.

  She was strikingly beautiful, with dark hair cascading down her back and eyes that sparkled with mischief. Her skin glowed with a warm, sun-kissed hue, and her smile-crooked, goofy, utterly endearing-caught me completely off guard. She moved with a charming clumsiness, and her voice, soft and lilting with an Irish accent, made me feel instantly at ease. Her name was Helena, and in that moment, I felt a strange, immediate connection.

  We chatted for a while, and she managed to convince me to buy a couple of odd trinkets. When I asked for her number, she laughed-a laugh that sounded oddly familiar, joyful but somehow forced at first, before settling into something more genuine. I brushed it off as my imagination, chalking it up to not having heard real laughter in too long.

  I left town the next day with a lighter heart and Helena’s number saved in my phone. We started texting, and I was surprised by how easy it was to talk to her. She told me about her love for painting and comics, and her enthusiasm made me realize I needed a hobby of my own-something more than just video games and meditation. I wanted to be a part of the world again, if only to have more to share with her.

  When she asked what I did for fun, I awkwardly tried to explain lucid dreaming. To my relief, she already knew all about it-more than I did, actually, which made sense given her job in that shop of curiosities.

  One evening, she suggested we talk on the phone. The thought gave me butterflies, and I dialed her number right away. As the phone rang, something strange happened: a raspy, ancient voice seemed to answer, whispering the word, “Holi’andr.” The name made me smile involuntarily, filling me with a sudden, inexplicable joy so intense that a tear rolled down my cheek. Then, just as quickly, the sensation faded, and Helena answered, her voice grounding me in reality. Relief and disappointment mingled inside me-I was happy, but a little wistful that I couldn’t always feel that euphoric.

  We talked late into the night, until I drifted off to sleep with the phone still pressed to my ear. It was the first time I’d slept in my own bed since my ex had left, and it felt like a turning point-a step forward into something new.

  The next morning, I woke up energized. At work, my creativity soared-I designed shirts better than I ever had, good enough that my boss actually complimented me for the first time. It was so out of character that I texted Helena about it right away. She replied with a joke about spreading positivity, and I couldn’t help but smile.

  That afternoon, I went on a cleaning spree at home, clearing out old junk and making space for something better. I scheduled an appointment to finally get my own internet connection, and even went grocery shopping instead of ordering in. Sitting in my freshly cleaned house, I realized how much lighter everything felt-the oppressive shadow of my past was finally gone.

  That night, I played some games and then settled in for meditation. For the second time ever, I slipped into a dream where I had full control. I couldn’t help but wonder if it was Helena’s presence in my life that made the difference. Maybe, just maybe, I was starting to dream again-both asleep and awake.

About a month ago she mentioned that her mom wanted to introduce her to a guy to try and arrange for their marriage, and i thought it would end up like every other guy she was introduced to: uninterested. she even told me a few months back that she was frustrated with her mom trying to set her up since she was trying to focus on her career right now. last week, she asked me to get coffee with her, and since we hadn't been talking much since she had said she was busy, i gave her some space. we were only able to talk for about an hour before she had to go, but during that conversation she told me she's certain about marrying this guy, and that she this hangout was probably going to be the last. i was confused and asked her how come. she said she wanted to respect her fiance and not talk to other men just like he was expected to not talk to other women. i told her that made sense for the most part, but i didnt really know if that applied to me or not since, I'M GAY. i suggested next time we hung out, she could bring other friends along, or even just her new husband if it made her feel more comfortable. i even joked she's be an auntie soon enough and she could throw parties where we could spend time together. she didn't seem that amused at that, and just laughed awkwardly and avoided eye contact. we talked about other things until it was time to go. the conversation left me feeling uneasy, and i asked her for a hug before she left, and we hugged. we even called a bit while we both drove home, and she brought up how she was nervous about how to approach people who she thought were going to be upset that she may not be able to spend time with anymore, and i told her that her real friends would be there alongside her even if it wasn't as often as it previously was. maybe i'm just stupid, but i didnt really think she was talking about me.

  
fast forward a week later, and i asked her when we were going to go to the park for a walk, since it was something i'd been wanting to do with her for a while and she'd mentioned it while getting coffee. she didn't respond for a few days, up until a couple hours ago. she said that she was confirmed getting married, that she was moving into a new chapter of her life, that ""out of respect"" she was going to stop sharing her location with me, and that she wasn't going to make plans with me anymore. 

  
i don't even know how to process this right now. one of the few people who's stuck with me through thick and thin, who've i've supported and who's supported me, is pulling away. just like that. i don't know whether to feel betrayed or to mourn. i feel so hurt, and yet i can't get myself to cry. i even tried to do some research on how these practices work for Muslims, and i'm even more heartbroken after reading that it's not considered proper/appropriate for men and women to be friends, especially after marriage. i've lost so many friends in the recent past, and just like that i've lost the one i think i cared about the most. i don't even know if i should text/call her and ask her outright what i need to do to be able to stay in her life, or if it's just already over and she's trying to let me down easy. just last month we were talking about maybe going on a trip, and i was even planning to watch Wicked Part 2 with her when it gets released since we'd seen the first part together in theaters. at the beginning of this year, we celebrated her passing her certification exam for her job by getting hotpot (and yes it was halal), and now... nothing. i'm just sitting here contemplating whether to rip down her letters she'd sent me while i was in college from my wall and delete her off of everything, or get myself a drink, lay on the ground, and pretend this isn't real. our last hangout was only an hour, and it was spent with her trying to let me down easy about how we weren't probably weren't going to be friends anymore. why couldnt we at least have gone to the park, somewhere scenic for our last hangout? 



I feel so stupid. i thought we'd be friends forever. we shared so many of the same struggles, so many of the same hopes and dreams. i've been to her house multiple times before too, and her family and siblings have always seemed cool with me (and yes they all knew i was gay). i guess i thought maybe i'd be an exception to the rule, that i wouldn't be considered a threat, especially since she's never going to be in my dating pool. i now wonder if i was just being used until she found a husband, and now that she has, i'm just being discarded. it's so unfair. i wish i was a girl right now, just so we could continue making happy memories. i hate this :(",3,1748399649.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False
1kx5z9j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1kx5z9j/divorcing_my_husband_of_six_years_he_ignored_my/,Divorcing my husband of ~six years. He ignored my express / clear ‘NO’ for intimacy six months ago among other things I cannot get over.,"My husband and I met around 2014. It was pretty intense in the beginning. He asked me to move in within a few months and showed me affection I never experienced before. I was in my 20s then, much less inclined to listen to my gut. Yet, my gut was.  there. It was rumbling; there were things I ignored. 

When we got married six years ago, he expressed strong desires to move to a state far away where we had no friends/family and he had no job prospects or a clear concise plan for us to move. He hated life where we lived; the culture; the people; his job; everything. He complained about it every single day. Drunk and smoke a lot. Moving became a point of contention. He wanted a change of lifestyle to live near the wilderness and I loved my job and my life where we met. Two years later, I ended up getting pregnant. My husband really really started putting the pressure on me to move to this fairly remote state/area. It was intense, every day 2 x a day, he would ask. I would express my same reservations. I felt so alone, yet tried to support his many trips there during my pregnancy and throughout our marriage. It would get ugly and he would repeatedly call me selfish and threaten to leave. He had multiple angry outbursts throughout. 

One day after our child was born, a little over a year ago now, he told me to move out of “his” house so he could sell the house and move. I was scared and nervous but I started to look for houses closer to my family, where our child and I would have support. However, he continued to try to pressure me to move with him, he made threats of self harm, called me names, etc. We ended up trying counseling and when he didn’t like what he was hearing, he quit in anger and committed to moving. I continued my efforts to move closer to my family. He would not go on his own  though. 

About a year ago now, he ended up relocating closer to my family with me. Yet, his misery continued. He still complained. He still wanted to move and repeatedly made threats to leave. I felt bad and guilty; my path and vision was not aligned perhaps his but I asked him to please leave, that I would not hold hard feelings and he should go, he didn’t. 

We signed up for counseling again. Shortly after signing up for counseling, I found his phone on the kitchen counter and found messages between him and another woman. He said awful things about me and entertained highly sexual messages from her. I told him I felt very exhausted and lacked motivation to go to therapy. He insisted the texts were “a joke” and got extremely mad. In November, he packed up his things to move out only to come back only two days later. 

When he came back, he was clearly under the influence of something. He expected us to welcome him with open arms but I was tired/annoyed and didn’t care to see him. Our child was having a fit that evening he came back. He told them he was ashamed to have them as their child. I was horrified and grossed out by his behavior. He tried to get intimate with me when he returned. I told him no repeatedly I wanted none of it - that I need to feel emotionally connected and I did not at all. He kept on and on and ended up pleasing himself right next to me.

The next day, I was trying to work at my desk. He asked to be intimate. I told him no. I was clear. I explained again that it was not personal or punishment, but rather I could literally not get into it because I didn’t feel connected to him at all. He ignored me and picked me up proceeded to do his thing and I just lay there, quite detached from reality and my surroundings. My eyes teared up. This was in December. 

Since that time, about six months ago now, I have been going to therapy yet I still haven’t been able to look at him the same, much less give him a hug or touch his hand. When I am near him, my entire body shuts down and I am angry. After weeks of him acting like I was playing a victim, he tries to apologize / reconcile but felt over the top. He was trying so hard buying me coffees in the morning leaving notes. And something told me none of it felt genuine. I explained how I felt, he called me a bitch/cunt and said I was playing with my life. 

When I said something he didn’t like the other day, we were in front of our child, he completely lost all control and slammed his head repeatedly in anger in front of our child to the point my husband gave himself a large goose egg. 

A couple of weeks ago, I made the decision to file for divorce. Something in me tells me there is more to this life than this and like I can love myself better than this. Yet, I am nervous. I don’t want to be a victim of “grass is greener” syndrome, my husband seems to think I am melodramatic. I am in my mid-30s and worried about the impact all of this will have on our child. 

Hoping for brighter days ahead!

1kx5w5w,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_SRRSFakeStories/comments/1kx5w5w/my_sisters_haunted_duplex/,My Sister's Haunted Duplex,"In the early 2000s a man murdered his wife by shooting her with a shot gun through their front door as she was holding it shut. I remember that day because our school went on lockdown as the husband ran from the police and I was stuck in the school cafeteria with my band class, staring at the outside doors and hearing the police sirens in the distance. One of the first responders, my stepdad, said that the wife refused to die until she knew her children were safe (they went to my school and I didn’t see them anymore after that day) and that her forearm was shot apart but she still had enough attached to hold onto the phone, waiting for confirmation. When she knew the children were safe she let go of the phone and her life.

Ten years later my sister and her 3 year old daughter moved into the duplex where this murder occurred. It was a small 2 bedroom, 1 bathroom place but it was affordable and fit their situation. She is superstitious and didn’t love living in a place with such a tragic history, but the rent was too good to pass it up.

They had many subtle experiences, unusual noises and visions at the corner of their eyes. Her daughter still remembers seeing people standing in the shadows of her room when she was trying to sleep. One story she always told, though, is how one morning she woke up to find every drawer and cabinet opened in her kitchen. She knew her daughter couldn’t have done it because some of the cabinets were too high for her to reach even if she managed to climb onto the counters. She told this story for years, even after moving to a new place, as one of her favorite anecdotes and best evidence for the existence of ghosts.

I’m not the biggest believer in ghosts but I have my own story of that place I was too afraid to tell her about for a long time. One evening I was babysitting her daughter and accidentally left my laptop charger. I returned in the middle of the night to retrieve it, she lived a few blocks away so I just walked there, and was as quiet as possible when entering the place. I found my charger on her coffee table. The place is so small that you can see every doorway and room from the living room. I remember peering into the small hallway that led to the two bedrooms and bathroom and seeing a thick, unnatural darkness, and then I looked to the kitchen where pale moonlight glinted against the cracked tile floor. The darkness of the hallway scared me into the lightness of the kitchen. The refrigerator, old but lovingly covered in child drawings and postcards, drew my attention because it reminded me of a recent incident at my work. Then each cabinet door and drawer, even the high ones my niece couldn’t reach, carefully opened one-by-one before my eyes, not making a single creak or rattle. I could feel a bitter, vengeful giddiness in the air as each door and drawer opened. My throat closed in fear like invisible hands were wrapped around it and I had a hard time breathing and swallowing as my own, very visible, hands shook with every careful movement. After all, wouldn’t you be shaking with giddiness and fear if you didn’t want to get caught pulling a revenge prank on your sister? I know I was.

At the time my sister and I were working at the same restaurant and she and one of our co-workers put something that humiliated me on the fridge (something embarrassing that I had written and thrown away.) To this day I’m still so mortified by what I wrote that I’m not even going to tell you what it was. My anger at her, however, has long subsided. I told her the truth about my little prank about five years later when she was retelling the story at a family campfire. She wasn’t upset at me (we have turned the anecdote into a funny story instead of a scary one) but I am still upset at myself for being so petty. I don’t know if I’m the reason she moved out of that duplex (I think it was her second pregnancy that led her to wanting a bigger place) but I still regret being so insensitive to her stressful situation and I know today I wouldn’t do such a thing to her. Still, I feel a little bit of pride from pulling it off so successfully.",1,1748399360.0,u_SRRSFakeStories,0,1.0,False

Blood pressure: 122/72
Total Cholesterol: 229
HDL: 63
Triglycerides: 78
LDL: 150

I am someone who is relatively active and had always had in my head that would keep any bad numbers down but I was definitely wrong. I know I ate a lot of processed foods and my weakness is my snacking, especially late night. I am in the process of identifying these issues and changing my diet. I believe my toughest to change is going to be breakfast as I typically eat a bagel or eggs along with an iced coffee. My doctor told me to cut down coffee even though I only have one a day but it does have the sugar in the flavors I get. Lunches, I typically eat a turkey and cheese with a bag of chips. Dinner was my most troublesome where I’d pack in the trans fats and saturated fats out of laziness for cooking and would eat Trader Joe’s frozen products etc.

For breakfast now, I am starting to eat steel cut oats, some fruit, flax seeds and oikos triple zero yogurt.

I’m curious to hear what others success stories are and if you think it’s possible to lower my LDL to under 100 in 6 months to a year. This is the first time I’ve had bloodwork in 3 years and had never ever gotten high results in my life.",2,1748399206.0,Cholesterol,3,1.0,False
1kx5ubv,https://i.redd.it/qkn69nwgof3f1.jpeg,The Last Day of My Rite Aid Pharmacy Before Permanent Closure,"I've been a pharmacy tech at Rite Aid since the fall of 2021. Back then, the place still had a pulse. I remember when Heyward Donigan, our CEO at the time, started rolling out these “Stores of the Future” and talking up this RxRevolution like she was unveiling the cure for old age. The idea was to blend traditional and western medicine at the pharmacy counter, her big pitch for the future. Most of the pharmacists just thought it was a waste of money. To be honest, it was. All we got were new uniforms, some over-designed signage, and a logo that looked like it belonged on a toothpaste tube. Corporate burned millions rebranding everything, and all it did was make the higher-ups feel like they’d done something important.  

Despite all the chaos above my pay grade, I liked my job. The regulars who came in for their meds were decent people. The staff felt like family, especially Bob, our pharmacy manager. He was in his sixties, with a white mustache and this jolly way of telling bad jokes while counting pills. Sometimes it felt like we were the only steady thing in the neighborhood. But even then, I could sense something underneath the surface, a kind of rot.  

It started with the earnings reports. Every quarter was worse than the last, no matter how much the CEO tried to spin it. Then Donigan quit out of nowhere. We all knew she was just the first rat off the sinking ship. The next CEO, Busy Burr, didn’t even unpack before Jeffrey Stein came in. He was a bankruptcy guy, one of those suits who comes in, cuts everything to the bone, and walks off with a fat bonus. Stein didn’t care about the stores, or the people. He just wanted his $20 million and a clean exit.  

By the time the company crawled out of bankruptcy in fall 2024, there was nothing left. The shelves were empty. I used to watch the front-end staff try to flex the few items we had, turning them sideways, spreading them out, trying to hide the gaps. But you can’t hide a void like that. Customers stopped coming. Those who still needed their prescriptions started transferring them out. The shipments got slower and slower until we were lucky to get a box a week.  

Today is our last day. The breakroom smells like old coffee and cardboard. The lights flicker even more than usual, but maintenance stopped showing up months ago. I’m standing behind the counter, watching the clock, feeling the slow creep of dread in my chest. We’re ghosts already, just waiting for the doors to lock behind us.  

Bob came in this morning, moving slower than usual. He looked at the shelves and just shook his head. There’s nothing left to say. We’re all being replaced, thrown away like empty pill bottles, while the C-suite and their consultants pick apart the company’s bones for whatever cash is left.   

It’s the little things that hurt the most. The sound of the receipt printer, once a constant hum, is gone. The pharmacy phone barely rings. I realize I’ll never see the regulars again, the old lady who always brought in hard candies, the young dad who joked about baby-proofing his house. They’re gone, scattered to other stores, other routines.  

I keep expecting to feel relief, like I’m waking from a nightmare. But it’s more like falling into one. As the sun sets, the shadows in the aisles stretch out, long and thin. The place feels colder, as if the heat’s already been turned off.  

I step out from behind the counter to take one last walk through the aisles. Every footstep echoes. I swear I hear voices behind me, just out of sight, but when I turn, there’s nothing, just the empty shelves and the dust. I run my hand along the cold metal, remembering when these aisles were full and alive. Now, every corner feels wrong. Like the store itself is holding its breath, waiting for something to finally put it out of its misery.  

I don’t know if it’s just exhaustion, or the way the dying fluorescent lights play tricks on the mind, but I keep catching glimpses of movement out of the corner of my eye. A shadow where there shouldn’t be one. The heavy hush of a store that’s been stripped of everything but memory. I wonder if the building remembers all the people who passed through, if it feels the loss the way I do.  

At closing time, Bob locks up for the last time. The key turns heavy and slow in his hand. I linger by the doors, staring out into the empty parking lot, the sky bruised and dark. There’s no ceremony, no send-off. Just the silence of a place that’s been hollowed out, picked clean by greed and neglect.  

I leave my badge on the counter. As I walk out, I look back one last time. For a split second, I swear I see someone standing at the far end of the pharmacy, someone watching, impossibly still, where the shadows are thickest. But when I blink, the figure is gone, and all that’s left is the cold, unblinking stare of the empty store.  

They say places can’t be haunted, only people. But I’m not so sure. Some ghosts are made of memories, and some are made of everything you’ve lost and can’t ever get back.

1kx5u1p,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kx5u1p,WE FINALLY MET FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 3.5 YEARS [part 2],"Continuation of my [m23] trip to visit my girlfriend [f23] for the first time last month! About 2 days before I was supposed to leave the UK to go back to the US, we went to the aquarium in Birmingham and had a blast. We got to feed the giant sea turtle and the black-tip sharks in their giant tunnel aquarium (pictured in my previous post), and they had an Animal Crossing event going on, we got to meet Isabelle and take pictures with her at the very end of the experience (we had to pay for the pictures but we got to meet her and feed the sharks for free, which was super cool)! 😄🦈🥰💗

The last couple pictures were taken maybe 2 hours before we had to get in the Uber to go to the airport, our last snuggle before I had to say goodbye and go back to the US. We were bawling our eyes out and trying to comfort each other and telling ourselves this goodbye won't be forever (because I'll be damned if it is) trying to be as close as we could for as long as we could before we had to go back to being half a world apart. Once we got to the airport, it was easy getting boarding passes/checked bags and had about an hour before I had to pass through security and board my plane, which was just enough time to share one last coffee together. My biggest regret that day (other than not staying forever, of course) was that our final kiss at the security gate wasn't nearly as long as I would've liked it to be. 

As I said in my first post, that trip was the best 1 week of my life 🥹💝 Nothing else has ever come close to it. We shared a lot of firsts together while I was visiting; we were each other's first kiss, first dinner date, first cuddle, and so many other things. I cannot wait until we're able to see each other again. I love her and I miss her so much, I haven't gotten a proper night's sleep since I've been back.

1kx5tzm,https://i.redd.it/mdpzb7adof3f1.jpeg,Fritz (Hazbin hotel oc.),"Nickname: Fritz

True Name: Vincent Sensivero

Biological age: 28 

Gender: Male

Pronouns: He/him

Sexuality: Pansexual

Date of birth: July 7th, 1984 

Place of birth: Brevard County, Florida

Death: August 16th, 2012

Relationship status: Single (and ready to mingle ;>)

Height: 5ft 10in

Life on Earth: At a young age, he always liked to keep to himself, mostly relying on hours and hours of TV, books, and any game imaginable. He would excel not only in school but in college as well. Vincent always wanted to take things apart and put them back together to fully understand them and possibly make them better in the process. After getting their bachelor's in mechanical engineering, he eventually enlisted in the United States Air Force. Vincent would start designing, building, and testing new, state-of-the-art aircraft there. Vincent and the rest of the group he worked with never necessarily made any groundbreaking discoveries, but they were a group of hard-working and determined groups fixed on perfection. By this point, most people would refer to Vincent by his call sign, “Fritz.” No one knew where the name came from, but everyone knew it was a perfect fit for the sporadic, intelligent, and lazy kind of guy Vincent was at his core. After an accident involving a faulty ejection seat landed Fritz in the hospital, he began to suffer the effects of untreated damage to his amygdala and sensory cortex, most likely due to inadequate treatment and examination. It wasn't long before Fritz was discharged from the Air Force and his pilot license revoked due to an insufficient mental state. After Fritz was discharged from the Air Force, he became a lonely but somewhat successful AC and heat pump repairman. This job would be the closest he would ever get back to engineering, and he would continue to go down from there. Weed would quickly become a new addiction for Fritz. Along with mostly short and chaotic relationships and getting into fights over the smallest grudges, Fritz wasn’t going anywhere. He never had the guts to end it all; he knew his heart wouldn't be able to take that, and he thought too fondly of his family, who supported him through everything. The day he died was like any other for Fritz; on his way to work, he got himself into a major car wreck on the highway that ended up in a massive explosion. By the time rescue workers got to him, his body had been completely dismembered.

Life in Hell: Fritz was never a believer, despite how much his parents forced him into Christianity. The guy was on the verge of going mental when he was first dropped in Hell, but he feared even more what would happen to him if he died a second time, so Fritz listened to his head and kept going. Fritz was quick to learn how the pride ring worked, and a small part of him enjoyed how chaotic it was. It was as for the first time in his existence; he was outnumbered by crazy people, making him look like a normal person or something like that. As luck would have it, he would quickly find a new job in the local sanitation department working various jobs. Fritz would also find an outlet for his mental aggression through a side hustle, specifically being a bodyguard/bouncer, mostly during the night. Despite the challenges he faces, Fritz has started to become more of a social butterfly, and every day feels a little bit freer in this crazy, crazy world he can't help but love.

He was kind of facing away but I was like 95% sure it was Elijah Wood. He was with others so I didn't want to bother him and fan-girl when he wasn't alone, especially since I wasn't 100% sure, so I let it be.

Eventually, I decided to go get a bottle of water because I was getting thirsty and I wanted to hydrate before boarding. While waiting to pay, there he was again but he was talking. Once I heard his voice, I was 100% sure. I debated interrupting to say hi, but decided against it because I really didn't want to intrude when he wasn't alone. It was a hard decision, but I let it be.

A bit of back story before I go on. I lost my dad in 2012 and my mom in 2015. Prior to my mom passing, I always fit the extended cuts of LotR in during the Christmas holiday period and once she passed away it became my firm tradition. I've spent every Christmas day with Elijah, Sean, Billy, Dominic, and the gang for over a decade now. On a day when nothing was open and I had nowhere to go, and all my friends were busy with their families and I couldn't talk to anyone, I was with these guys, some leftover Chinese food I bought the day before when restaurants were open, coffee, and hot chocolate. I turned an otherwise pretty sad day for me into something really enjoyable that I look forward to every year now.

Cut back to today, I went to a Starbucks to grab a coffee while still waiting for my flight to board and one of his party walks in. She was only a minute behind me and alone so I worked up the nerve to just request she pass on the message of how much those movies mean to me. She was so kind and patient and said she would. Her response really filled my heart, and I figured whether she did or not, her patience and openness to just accept the words I wanted to share even though she had no obligation to was already more than enough.

As luck would have it, they were on my flight! While boarding, the person I had spoken to pointed me out to Elijah. He came over with a smile on his face, I stumbled all over my words, he engaged me and asked my name, where I was going, and let me tell my story again. I made a fool of myself a bit, but this was still the highlight of my year so far. Elijah also practiced such kindness with a big smile on his face and let me take a picture with him. Even if he didn't want to do it, as I understand he is a rather private person, he indulged me and he just let a fan have a moment.

While I'd love to share the photo, I know he keeps his life private so I'm going to keep it to myself, and that's also why im keeping a lot of the details more vague.

For all the people here who are even bigger fans than me, people say you shouldn't meet your heroes. This was an instance those people would be wrong. It was the briefest, most klutzy encounter on my part, but it kind of meant the world to me right now as I'm going through quite a rough patch. I'd like to say, if it matters to anyone as much as it does to me, he really strikes as one of the good guys. I can watch these movies with a newfound fondness in my heart knowing one of my Christmas Day pals gave me a moment of his day to put a stupid smile on my face.

It led me to a major decision about myself and my career that I've never forgotten.

I transcribed it here so I wouldn't forget.

""I don't think this is a contentious notion - that the self is an illusion. Importantly though, the self is a helpful function, illusory or otherwise, like digestion, or sneezing. It brings coherence to the chronological happenstance of our lives. If the self cracks and confuses then everything from employment to parenting could be affected. That is of course for  involuntary cracking. 

What about deliberate chiselling?

We do this already and call it learning, adapting, or growing. Experience introduces new colours and carvings to our evolving selves, as we discover new canvases and rock. Experience may even embolden us to look beyond our current tools and wonder about stones we've never seen. 

Perhaps whole caves of selves wait for us out there, unshapen.
 
We may further realize that our current self is not something entirely of our making. Genetics, upbringing, and just individual circumstances have shaped our selves into, if we are fortunate, something coherent and aligned to the demands of our respective environments. If we consider the self then as a kind of continuous optimization process, then whole swathes of our inherited selves could be supplanted by new selves of our conscious making.""

For those not fully caught up, here’s the gist:  
On a recent *Taylor Watch* episode, Kelly briefly referenced “the guy everyone hates” in a discussion about fans listening to “stolen versions” of Taylor’s music. Based on the context, she was likely referring to Swiftologist, who has gotten pushback in the past for expressing a preference for Taylor’s original versions over the re-recordings. Importantly, it didn’t seem like Kelly was saying *she* hated him—more that he gets hate online, which... he does. A lot. He even acknowledges this in his own content and says he blocks/report people for hate regularly. So, I interpreted it more like commentary than a personal attack.

But then Zach responded with this TikTok:   
Let’s break it down.

He opens with, “This is a message for the *Barstool Sports* Taylor Swift podcast,” with a noticeably loaded tone. Now, whatever your feelings are about Barstool, *Chicks in the Office* and *Call Her Daddy* came from there and are massive platforms. Dismissing them as a way to indirectly minimize *Taylor Watch* felt unnecessary.

Then, Zach accuses the girls of repeatedly talking about him and demands they stop. But from what I’ve heard, it was a single off-hand comment. Not a segment, not a rant—just a nod to a polarizing figure in the fandom. Which, if we’re being fair, he is.

But then the real problem: he calls Kelly and Gia “ghouls” and “beasts.”  
That *crossed a serious line*. As a fanbase (and a feminist one at that), we *should* be hyper-aware of the misogynistic undertones behind attacking women’s appearances or dehumanizing them—especially in a public, performative way. Zach, who makes a name for himself analyzing Taylor’s PR decisions and the media’s treatment of her, *should* know better. He’s well-versed in how women are picked apart, scrutinized, and dismissed for things that wouldn’t even raise an eyebrow if a man did them.

What’s ironic is that this could’ve been a classy moment for him to say:  
“Hey, I saw I was mentioned—I get that I’m polarizing, but just a reminder I’m a real person with a name and a point of view. Let’s keep things respectful.”  
But instead, he went full condescension mode, took cheap shots, and then pivoted into a “humble brag” about being on tour. Except… the numbers don’t exactly support the superiority he was implying. *Taylor Watch* has a strong online presence: 77k followers, with Kelly at 88k and Gia at 27k. *Evolution of a Snake*, which he referenced in his clapback, has 18k followers, and his personal account sits around 20k. So if the message was “I’m more relevant,” that feels… questionable.

This all left a bad taste in my mouth. I used to enjoy Zach’s content—it’s structured, informative, and often offers deep dives into Taylor lore that you won’t find elsewhere. Sure, he reads off a prompt and sometimes sounds like ChatGPT, but I appreciated the research. That said, I *unsubscribed* after this.

Because here’s the thing: *Taylor Watch* feels like hanging out with your best friends, chatting Taylor lore over iced coffee, unstructured and real. It’s girlhood, it’s vibes. Swiftologist is polished and scholarly. Both have value. But you can’t come after someone for being fun and casual just because it’s different from what you do. Especially not with *personal insults*.

And finally—yes, criticism is fair game in media. But the way you engage with your critics says everything about your character. If you want respect in this fandom, you have to give it too. It made me reflect on how different fan voices interact. There's room for both well-researched, structured Swiftology and light, casual fandom chats. They don’t have to compete. But when creators take offense and respond with aggression—especially when it involves women being mocked—it shifts the tone from fun to mean.

Curious what others thought. Did anyone else catch this? Would love to hear your takes.",4,1748398726.0,swiftiecirclejerk,14,0.83,False

I am a 22 year old woman. I keep seeing two apparitions.

I had a medium come over for my boyfriend’s birthday and the medium brought up this woman that I keep seeing, I couldn’t believe that she knew who i was talking about. she told me the woman was lost. She was sad and she didn’t know why she was there. She wasn’t sure if she knew me, but for some reason, this medium knew that I keep seeing this apparition of this woman. 
I haven’t seen her in my dreams only in person sometimes she comes behind people and stands there . 
The medium said that women been trying to reach me in her dreams 
but she keeps failing. 
my whole friend group knows about her. no one else has seen her but me. 
Sometimes she will open her mouth and point like she’s trying to tell me something . 
She’s about 5‘8“ tall she has blue jeans on almost like a bright colored long sleeve shirt
she has dark shoulder length hair, and a longer nose . 
She will pop out of nowhere I haven’t seen her anywhere else besides my home. just standing in different locations of the house. 

i don’t feel threatened. i don’t think she is harmful. 
I don’t know how to contact her. 
i don’t know if she’s strong enough for me to even communicate with her. 

There is also a male figure that lives in my home he just comes as a shadow. 
He loves blue grass and country. he will often turn on my tv or alexa and play random country music. 
he’s angry. 
that’s all i know is he’s angry he died 
i hear foot steps 
weird noises 
while me and my boyfriend were watching tv in my bedroom. i heard loud music in the living room(my roommate) was not home at the time, we were alone. we stopped the tv show we were watching and the music was blasting in the living room. He grabbed a knife thinking someone was in the house and i opened the bedroom door, we walked down the hallway to the tv. The tv was blasting 96 volume playing a youtube video that was just country. (i don’t listen to country). As soon as i turn the corner to record the video stops and goes to youtube screen with all the accounts that are shown on it. Then we hear the same music start over in my bedroom. i didn’t know what to do or where to go but i felt it walking around the room with me. the remotes were in a glass container in the middle of the coffee table. 
to connect to my youtube you need a code and to be on my wifi. 
I checked my history and there was no such video on it. no country no music no video. 

that was abt 6 months ago. 

2 months ago the alexa turned on blasting country music too. 
i could have sworn i unplugged it. 

i learn to live with them but i don’t know why they are here and i know it’s not the home it’s self that is haunted. 

i have video of the Tv.
